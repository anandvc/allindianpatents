NATURAL RUBBER LATEX EAVING REDUCED ALLERGENICITY<br>
ND METHOD OF MAKING<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a natural rubber latex composition having reduced<br>
allergenicity and a method of making the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of Hevea brasiliensis natural rubber latex (NRL) as a protective thaterial has<br>
a long history of usage dating back to the 1800s. The widespread use of barrier NRL<br>
articles like gloves and condoms increased tremendously in the 1980s primarily due to the<br>
"universal precautions" policy outlined by the Centers for Disease Control NRL's<br>
popularity and longevity can be attributed to several factors. The physical properties of<br>
NRL are superior to non-latex synthetic products. Field latex, the feedstock thaterial for<br>
NRL that continues to be readily available in Malaysia and Thailand, is now available in<br>
several new regions around the world including India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Liberia,<br>
Guatemala, and China. NRL is significantly less expensive than most petroleum-based<br>
synthetic thaterials whose cost continues to fluctuate with the cost of crude oil<br>
Additionally, the reduced environmental impact of natural rubber latex compared to<br>
petroleum-based synthetic thaterials continues to be the preferred thaterial of choice in an<br>
environmentally conscious society. The availability, ease of production and the<br>
performance of NRL products continue to make NRL the chosen thaterial by manufacturers<br>
and users among industry and medical professionals. Today, there are over 40,000<br>
commercially available products made from NRL A concern with NRL continues to be its<br>
petential involvement with adverse health effects due to the antigenicity of NRL products.<br>
An intuitive means of controlling this parameter in the NRL source thaterial is by de-<br>
proteination / protein modification. Validation of tins process can be achieved by specific<br>
methods of protein quantification.<br>
Although the first description of an allergic reaction to latex gloves appeared in the<br>
American Literature in 1933 when usage was slight, the majority of latex allergic reactions<br>
were documented in the late 80s and throughout the 90s and 2000s. Published data indicate<br>
 <br>
17% of American healthcare workers and up to 73% or more of frequently exposed patients,<br>
such as those with spina bifida, were sensitized to latex proteins.<br>
Several attempts, including new source crops, synthetic lattices and various<br>
treatment methods, have been made to eliminate these problem proteins from Hevea NRL<br>
by biological, physical and/or chemical methods that affect the complex acid-base behavior<br>
of proteins. One approach has been to introduce the latex articles to multiple leaching steps<br>
and chlorination. This approach does reduce the protein levels in the finished product;<br>
however it weakens the latex film thus compromising the physical properties of the product<br>
Another attempt to reduce proteins in NRL is the use of proteolytic enzymes to degrade the<br>
proteins in the latex solution. The issue with this approach is the introduction of another<br>
protein (the enzyme) to the latex, which may itself be allergenic. The most logical solution<br>
is the use of low-protein latex, such as the treated NRL of the present invention as this<br>
approach will more than likely reduce the possibility for an allergic response in the end user<br>
of the finished product If high levels of protein are not present in the raw thaterial they<br>
cannot appear in the manufactured product.<br>
Two other non-Hevea NRL thaterials have been attempted to be commercialized in<br>
the US; guayule rubber latex and Taraxacum kok-saghyz, also known as the Russian<br>
dandelion. These thaterials are reported to be higher in cost compared to natural rubber and<br>
presently are available only in limited quantities. Hevea NRL has been around for more<br>
than a century and its antigenic proteins have been thoroughly researched. The allergenic<br>
properties and economic viability of latex from the guayule &amp; Taraxacum kok-saghyz have<br>
yet to be scrutinized in the way that Hevea has been. Being natural products, both of these<br>
thaterials have their own unique set of proteins with potential allergenic behavior not yet<br>
understood.<br>
Recently, it has been shown that allergens are distributed into few protein families<br>
and possess a restricted number of biochemical functions. The allergen functions found<br>
most frequently were limited to hydrolysis of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids; binding<br>
of metal ions and lipids; storage; and cytoskeleton association. The limited number of<br>
protein families that are allergenic and the narrow functional distribution of most allergens<br>
support the existence of yet unknown factors that render proteins allergenic. Many of these<br>
specific protein functions play into the chemistry used to manipulate them yielding a<br>
modified NRL source thaterial.<br>
 <br>
The last decadrf and a half lias seen a great change in latex use as a result of publicity<br>
concerning these allergies. Today in the U.S. there is almost universal awareness of the risks<br>
associated with repeated latex exposure, particularly in the healthcare fields where exposure<br>
is more profound. Awareness of the risks, however, extends into the industrial glove<br>
market, and even to the general public, who have received risk warnings from various<br>
government and health-watch groups. As a result mere exists much interest in the market,<br>
fueling a strong trend to reduce exposure to latex-associated allergens.<br>
Manuiacturers nave responded in several ways: I) reduction or elimination of<br>
donning powder, 2) utilization of chlorinated glove washing and additional processing steps<br>
to reduce antigenic protein load, 3) use of coatings to reduce actual contact with latex, and<br>
4) introduction of alternative thaterials that mimic, natural latex performance characteristics.<br>
Each of these industry reactions represents compromises either from ease of use,<br>
performance, or cost standpoint In short, nothing beats the tactile, comfort, and barrier<br>
protection that is provided by natural latex products.<br>
In the last ten years there has been an increasing awareness of the possible<br>
immunologic and other reaction risks associated with the use of latex gloves. This<br>
awareness is the result of the proliferation in glove usage among healthcare workers in order<br>
to avoid potential exposure to HIV/AIDS transmission sources.<br>
An increase in the reported incidence of latex allergic sensitivity and other skin<br>
reactions has been concomitant with increased glove usage. This has spurred an effort by<br>
industry leaders and manufacturers to reduce exposure to latex. Glove makers have initiated<br>
latex substitution in the manufacture of gloves, limited use of donning powder so as to<br>
prevent antigenic proteins leached into the cornstarch powder from becoming airborne (a<br>
source of respiratory exposure and subsequent sensitization), and the introduction of low<br>
'protein methods for latexes to reduce the overall protein content of gloves.<br>
Latex rubber in its natural form consists of polymeric, long chain molecules<br>
consisting of repeating units of isoprene:<br>
When it is harvested from the rubbertree, Hevea brasilieasis, the liquid, sticky<br>
substance also contains proteins like heavarnine, hevein, and rubber elongation factor.<br>
Although the basic isoprene polymer is non-antigenic, the associated proteins are highly<br>
 <br>
antigenic. It is important to note this difference in order to minimize the antigenic impact of<br>
natural latex without destroying its underlying structure.<br>
In its natural state, natural latex does not possess characteristics that are<br>
commercially useful. In order to achieve utilitarian value, including strength, elasticity, and<br>
memory, the chains of isoprene must be cross-linked to one another. Depending on the type<br>
of rubber end product desired, this is achieved with either application of heat and sulfur, or<br>
in the case of latex rubber used in the manufacture of gloves, various chemical accelerators<br>
that donate or bind sulfur, thus speeding the cross-linking process. The major accelerators<br>
are thiurams, mercaptobenzothaizoles (MBTs) and carbathates.<br>
In addition to accelerators, latex glove manufacturers utilize another class of<br>
additives, called sensitizers, which most frequently consist of substituted phenols. These<br>
substances are used to impede oxidation, and resultant degradation, of natural latex.<br>
Foreign thaterials, natural latex proteins, accelerators, and sensitizers can all provoke<br>
human reactions, but the allergenic reactions due to the proteins are considered to be the<br>
most problethatic in the healthcare field. The following briefly describes three major types<br>
of foreign thaterial reactions most commonly associated with latex use:<br>
Irritant derthatitis is skin irritation that does not involve the body's immune<br>
response, that is, it is not an allergic response. Frequent hand washing and inadequate<br>
drying, aggressive scrubbing technique or detergents, mechanical abrasive effect of powder,<br>
clithatic irritation, and emotional stress can all cause this condition. Even though this is not<br>
an allergic reaction, irritant hand derthatitis can cause breaks in the skin which can facilitate<br>
entry of the sensitizing latex protein or chemicals found in the commercial product, and in<br>
turn lead to latex allergy.<br>
Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity (type PV allergy) is contact (hand) derthatitis<br>
generally due to the chemicals used in latex production. It is mediated via T-cells causing a<br>
skin reaction that is typically seen 6-48 hours after contact The reaction is local and limited<br>
to the skin that has contact with the glove. While not life threatening, those with type IV<br>
allergy are at increased risk to develop type I allergy. As in irritant derthatitis, the broken<br>
skin barrier can provide an entry site into the body for foreign thaterials. This can produce<br>
sensitization to latex proteins leading to a more serious type of reaction.<br>
 <br>
The third and potentially most serious type of reaction associated with latex use is a<br>
true IgE/histamino-mediated allergy to protein (also called immediate, or type I<br>
hypersensitivity). This type of reaction can involve local or systemic symptoms. Local<br>
symptoms include contact urticaria (hives), which appear in the area where contact<br>
occurred, Le., the hands, but can spread beyond that area and become generalized. More<br>
generalized reactions include allergic rhinbconjunctrvitis and asthma. The presence of<br>
allergic manifestations to natural latex indicates an increased risk for anaphylaxis, a rare but<br>
serious reaction experienced by some individuals who have developed an allergy to certain<br>
proteins (e.g., insect stings, natural rubber, penicillin). This type I reaction can occur within<br>
seconds to minutes of exposure to the allergen. When such a reaction occurs, it can progress<br>
rapidly from swelling of the lips and airways, to shortness of breath, and may progress to<br>
shock and death, sometimes within minutes. While any of these signs and symptoms may be<br>
the first indication of allergy, in many workers with continued exposure to the allergen,<br>
mere is progression from skin to respiratory symptoms over a period of months to years.<br>
Some studies indicate that individuals with latex allergy are more likely than latex non-<br>
allergic persons to be atopic (have an increased immune response to some common<br>
allergens, with symptoms such as asthma or eczema). Once natural latex allergy occurs,<br>
allergic individuals continue to experience symptoms, which have included life-threatening<br>
reactions.<br>
There are several classes of people known to be at increased risk for latex allergy.<br>
Medical patients who have had multiple hospitalizations and have been exposed numerous<br>
. times to latex medical products, healthcare workers, and atopic individuals comprise this<br>
high-risk group. Current estithates are that 8-17% of healthcare workers become sensitized.<br>
Despite the recent emphasis on universal precautions, the marked increase in glove usage<br>
due to commutable disease prevention is largely blamed for the increase in latex allergies<br>
among these groups. Atopic individuals (those with other allergies or asthma) are at<br>
significantly greater risk to develop latex allergy than the general population. It is estithated<br>
that as many as 25-30% of atopic healthcare workers may become sensitized.<br>
The problems presented by allergic reactions to latex are exacerbated by the<br>
proliferation and widespread use of latex-based products. Latex presents great risk to<br>
persons in the health care industry where latex products are used extensively in the form of<br>
gloves, casts, dressings, tapes, catheters, tubes, drains, airway management devices, med<br>
delivery, tourniquets, monitoring devices, and others. One persistent threat lies in the<br>
 <br>
cornstarch powder used to lubricate and ease donning of rubber gloves. The proteins absorb<br>
onto the powder and become aerosolized during use and when the gloves are donned and<br>
removed.<br>
Products containing latex are also found throughout the home in the form of<br>
balloons, art supplies, toys, swimming equipment, contraceptive devices, cosmetics, bottle<br>
nipples, pacifiers, clothing, chewing gum, rubber bands, and others. Groups at risk include<br>
particularly children with spina bifida, those who have been shown to have a very high risk<br>
of latex sensitivity, patients with congenital urologic abnormalities, healthcare providers<br>
and rubber industry workers.<br>
Since the severe allergic reactions to latex are due to their naturally occurring<br>
proteins, the prior art offers little in the way of solutions. For example, ammonia treatment<br>
of the NRL proteins can cause breakdown and precipitation of some latex proteins, but the<br>
allergeniciry appears to be preserved and other antigenic latex proteins are unextractable. In<br>
short, the literature recommends that the only treatment available for latex allergy is<br>
avoidance.<br>
The Food and Drug Adrninistration (FD A), as well as other state and federal<br>
agencies, has received requests to ban the use of glove powder. It has been suggested that<br>
experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that glove powder on medical gloves can<br>
enhance foreign body reactions, increase infections and act as a carrier of natural latex<br>
allergens. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently<br>
issued a safety alert recommending the use of powder-free, reduced protein content latex<br>
gloves to reduce exposure to natural latex proteins (allergens).<br>
Experimental and clinical data demonstrate that some NRL proteins are allergenic.<br>
Further natural latex proteins bind to cornstarch while aerosolized powder on. NRL gloves<br>
is allergenic and can cause respiratory allergic reactions. Published studies support the<br>
conclusion that airborne glove powder represents a threat to individuals allergic to NRL and<br>
may represent an important agent for sensitizing non-allergic individuals. There are also<br>
published data (although limited) and clinical experience that cornstarch powder on NRL<br>
gloves may also be a contributing factor in the development of irritation and type IV<br>
allergy.<br>
 <br>
In addition to dusting powder, other lubricants may also be used in the<br>
manufacturing process. Latex and some polymers, are tacky and dipped products such as<br>
condoms and gloves made of these thaterials stick to the mold or former. A mold-release<br>
lubricant such as calcium carbonate or a mixture of calcium carbonate and cornstarch is<br>
used to enable the removal of these dipped products like condoms and gloves from molds.<br>
The other aide of the dipped product may be coated with a donning lubricant, such as<br>
cornstarch or silicone oils, to make donning easier and to prevent dipped products from<br>
sticking during the manufacturing process.<br>
Over the past three years, the FDA has received requests to ban the use of all glove<br>
powders. These requests have been based on repeated clinical and experimental studies<br>
reporting that cornstarch on surgical gloves can damage tissue's resistance to infection,<br>
enhance the development of infection, serve as a potential source of occupational asthma,<br>
and provide a source of natural latex protein exposure to natural latex allergic individuals.<br>
The issues regarding the use of glove powder, except for the transport of natural latex<br>
protein allergens, apply to the use of glove powder on both NRL and synthetic gloves.<br>
Several states, acting on their own initiative have banned the sale and use of glove powders.<br>
Thus, mere is a need to develop a NRL composition and method of making the same<br>
that can provide reduced allergenicity. It is an object of the present invention is to teach a<br>
method of reducing the allergenicity of NRL prior to vulcanization to enable the creation of<br>
a commercial product relatively free of allergenicity with no apparent loss of physical<br>
properties.<br>

As briefly described above, the present invention provides a NRL composition<br>
having reduced allergenicity. The present invention also provides a method of making such<br>
a reduced allergenicity NRL, the method comprising contacting a NRL composition with an<br>
aluminum hydroxide, optionally agitating the resulting mixture, and then vulcanizing the<br>
resulting mixture. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that under certain<br>
conditions and in accordance with the instant disclosure, NRL can be treated with aluminum<br>
hydroxide to produce protein complexes. Further, the formed protein complexes can then<br>
be removed from a treated NRL composition.<br>
In one aspect, the NRL of the present invention can be produced by exchanging<br>
and/or complexing at least a portion of the proteins from, for example, a field latex sap<br>
emulsion with aluminum hydroxide. Aluminum hydroxide can be stable under most<br>
conditions. Various ionic forms of aluminum hydroxide can bond with proteins of<br>
complementary charge which are driven toward ionic equilibria or an isoionic point.<br>
. Aluminum hydroxide is an amphoteric substance, meaning it can act as either an acid or a<br>
base and can readily share electrons with proteins. Amino acids, the blocks that build the<br>
proteins, are both very weak acids and very weak bases, thus creating the basis for both<br>
ionic and covalent bonding to aluminum hydroxide. Aluminum hydroxide is commonly<br>
used as an absorbent, emulsifier, ion exchanger or antacid. Aluminum hydroxide can also<br>
be used in the purification, of water because it can form a jelly-like structure, suspending<br>
unwanted thaterials in water, including bacteria.<br>
 <br>
METHOD OF MAKING REDUCED ALLXRGENICITY NRL<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention involves a method of reducing allergenicity<br>
of NRL comprising contacting a NRL composition to an aluminum hydroxide and agitating<br>
the resulting mixture to produce an intithate admixture. The individual concentrations of<br>
latex and aluminum hydroxide can vary depending upon the process parameters and the<br>
desire properties of the resultant product The individual concentrations of latex and<br>
aluminum hydroxide can also vary depending on variations of, for example, protein levels<br>
in raw thaterials. In one aspect, the present invention comprises any amount of latex<br>
combined with any amount of aluminum hydroxide^and is not intended to be limited to any<br>
particular concentration range of one or more components. In various exemplary<br>
embodiments, latex comprises from about 27 phr (parts per hundred rubber) to about 30 phr<br>
and aluminum hydroxide comprises from about 0.01 phr to about 5 phr, for example, about<br>
0.01,0.02,0.04, 0.06,0.08,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8, 0.9,1,12,1.4,1.6,1.8,2,<br>
2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5, or 5 phr, or from about 0.1 phr to about 1 phr, for example, about 0.1,0.2,<br>
0.3, 0.4, 0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8, 0.9, or 1 phr. In a specific embodiment, at least about 0.1 phr<br>
aluminum hydroxide is admixed with the NRL composition. In another specific<br>
embodiment, about 0.4 phr aluminum hydroxide is contacted with a NRL composition. In<br>
another specific embodiment, about 1 phr aluminum hydroxide is contacted with a NRL<br>
composition.<br>
Any duxoinum hydroxide suitable for contacting with a NRL composition can be<br>
utilized in the present invention. The average particle size and distribution, the chemical<br>
purity, and/or the density of a particular aluminum hydroxide can vary depending upon the<br>
specific process parameters and/or the requirements of the desired final latex article. In<br>
various embodiments, the aluminum hydroxide has an average particle size of from about 1<br>
to-about 100 niicrometers, foe example, about 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8,9,10,12,14,15,16,20,<br>
30,40,50,60,70,80,90, or 100 micrometers; from about 1 to about 20 micrometers, for<br>
example, about 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16, or 20 micrometers; or from<br>
about 5 to about 15 micrometers, for example, about 5,6,7, 8, 9,10,12,14, or 15<br>
micrometers. It should be noted that aluminum hydroxide particles having a smaller size<br>
and/or increased surface area can typically provide greater levels of protein reduction man<br>
larger sized particles. In one embodiment, the aluminum hydroxide has a molecular weight<br>
of about 78.00 and a density of about 2.42 g/cm3.<br>
 <br>
The aluminum hydroxide of the present invention can be contacted with the NRL<br>
composition at any time prior to vulcanization. NRL compositions are frequently<br>
centrifuged to concentrate the composition with the added benefit of purifying the thaterial<br>
by removal of a portion of water soluble protein thaterial contained therein. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the NRL composition is not centrifuged. In another<br>
embodiment, the NRL composition is centrifuged to remove at least a portion of the protein<br>
thaterial contained therein. If a NRL composition is centrifuged, aluminum hydroxide can<br>
be added to the composition prior to or subsequent to centrifugation. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, aluminum hydroxide is contacted with the NRL composition prior to<br>
centrifugmg, and the resulting mixture is then centrifuged.<br>
In another embodiment, the aluminum hydroxide can be admixed with a NRL<br>
composition for a period of time, such as, for example, from about less man an hour to<br>
about 72 hours, for example, about 0.5,1,2, 3,4, 5, 8,10,12,15,20,22,24,26, 28,30,36,<br>
40,45,50,55,60,65,70 or 72 hours, and optionally agitated. la another embodiment, the<br>
admixture is contacted for a period of time from about 18 to about 36 hours, for example,<br>
about 18,20,22,24,26, 28,30,32,34, or 36 hours with agitation. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the aluminum hydroxide is contacted with the NRL composition for about 5<br>
hours. In another embodiment, the aluminum hydroxide is contacted with the NRL<br>
composition for about 36 hours, m yet another embodiment, the aluminum hydroxide is<br>
contacted with the NRL composition for about 72 hours. While not wishing to be bound by<br>
theory, it is believed that contacting the NRL composition with aluminum hydroxide<br>
modifies at least a portion of the antigenic protein within the NRL composition.<br>
It should be noted that other components, such as, for example, fillers, additives,<br>
Theological and/or processing aids can be added to the NRL composition before,<br>
- simultaneous with, and/or after addition of the aluminum hydroxide.<br>
In various embodiments, one or more Burfactants can be mixed with the NRL<br>
composition. A surfactant, if used, can be contacted with and/or mixed with a NRL<br>
composition at any time prior to vulcanization. In a preferred embodiment, a surfactant is<br>
mixed with a NRL and aluminum hydroxide composition prior to the optional removal of<br>
aluminum hydroxide. Addition of a surfactant can, while not wishing to be bound by<br>
theory, facilitate the association and/or removal of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic<br>
proteins from the NRL composition. In addition, a surfactant, if used, can, in various<br>
 <br>
embodiments, result in facile removal of proteins from the composition by a subsequent<br>
leaching and/or extraction step. A surfactant, if used, can be any surfactant suitable for use<br>
in a NRL composition. In various embodiments, a surfactant can comprise an anionic<br>
surfactant, a catiomc surfactant, a non-ionic surfactant, or a combination thereof Further, a<br>
surfactant, if used, can be added or contacted in any concentration suitable for use in a given<br>
process and/or for producing a desired latex article.<br>
The combination of an aluminum hydroxide/surfactant treatment can, in various<br>
embodiments, result in significantly improved removal of protein from the NRL<br>
, composition. The addition of an optional surfactant can facilitate liberation of proteins<br>
-, absorbed onto the latex particle layer. In such a treatment, the liberated (hydrolyzed)<br>
proteins can associate with and/or bind to the aluminum hydroxide present in the solution.<br>
At near neutral pH values, aluminum hydroxide is not substantially water soluble and can be<br>
removed via centrifugation, as described above. The use of a surfactant can provide<br>
additional benefits upon aging of a latex solution and/or article. In one embodiment,<br>
proteins in a latex composition that has not been treated with a surfactant can remain<br>
absorbed onto latex particles and can be subsequently released upon aging. In various<br>
embodiments, a NRL composition not treated with aluminum hydroxide can have an<br>
antigenic protein value of from about 32 to about 96 % higher than a composition treated<br>
with aluminum hydroxide and surfactant after 21 days storage. While the specific<br>
improvement of a composition can vary depending on, for example, the properties of the<br>
feedstock thaterial, it should be appreciated that the addition of a surfactant to a treatment<br>
process can result in reduced antigenic protein levels, even after storage, and thus, improved<br>
stability of the resulting latex solution or article.<br>
Once the admixture of NRL and aluminum hydroxide is contacted and optionally<br>
. agitated, thus complexhig and/or modifying at least a portion of the antigenic protein, the<br>
treated latex containing modified protein can be vulcanized to produce a latex article. In<br>
one embodiment, a vulcanizing step can be performed without substantially disrupting the<br>
physical and/or chemical properties of the NRL.<br>
After treatment with aluminum hydroxide, the aluminum hydroxide and any<br>
antigenic protein that has associated with and/or bound to the aluminum hydroxide can be<br>
optionally removed. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the aluminum hydroxide is<br>
removed from the NRL composition after contacting and agitation. In another embodiment,<br>
 <br>
substantially all of the aluminum hydroxide is removed from the NRL composition after<br>
contacting and agitation. Removal of aluminum hydroxide from a treated NRL composition<br>
can be performed by any suitable technique. In various embodiments, removal of<br>
aluminum hydroxide can be performed by filtration techniques, centrifugation, or a<br>
combination thereof. Treated NRL compositions can also be subjected to a treatment step<br>
comprising exposure to hot water and/or chlorine or a chlorine containing solution, such as,<br>
for example, chlorine containing solutions commonly utilized in latex manufacturing<br>
processes.<br>
After the optional removal of aluminum hydroxide from a NRL composition, the<br>
resulting latex can exhibit improved optical properties, such as, for example, a cleaner color<br>
and/or appearance, reduced color, and/or increased translucency. Such improvements,<br>
while not wishing to be bound by theory, are believed to be due to the removal or proteins,<br>
lipids and/or lutoids, or a combination thereof from the NRL composition. While not<br>
wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that untreated NRL containing these thaterials<br>
can hydrate quicker, thus compromising the resultant articles tensile strength and chemical<br>
barrier, especially for example, upon aging.<br>
In another aspect, a portion of, substantially all of, or all of the aluminum hydroxide<br>
can remain in a treated NRL composition. In yet another aspect, an excess of aluminum<br>
hydroxide can be used and/or additional aluminum hydroxide added to the composition<br>
such that a residual amount of aluminum hydroxide remains, for example, suspended in a<br>
liquid latex solution. Such an amount of aluminum hydroxide can be added prior to,<br>
simultaneous to, or subsequent to the addition of any other amounts of aluminum<br>
hydroxide, and optionally after removal of at least a portion of any earlier added aluminum<br>
hydroxide that can be complexed to protein. Residual aluminum hydroxide can be useful in<br>
various aspects due to the fact that some protein that is covalently bonded to a rubber<br>
particle can persist, but in the continued presence of an alkali pH, and in some aspects,<br>
especially when compounded, the backbone of such a protein can break and the<br>
protein/peptide subsequently go into the aqueous phase of the composition. Thus, the<br>
presence of aluminum hydroxide can, in various aspects, complex proteins, creating an<br>
insoluble precipitate known as an organic lake.<br>
Further, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that as water is<br>
removed during production of a latex article, a salt of the protein and aluminum hydroxide<br>
 <br>
can be formed that displaces water as a byproduct Once such a salt is formed, the protein<br>
will have no available reactive sites. Such a protein can remain present in the composition<br>
or produced article as part of a neutral and non-reactive molecule, without resulting in<br>
allergenictty.<br>
Digestion of any remaining protein can be thermodynamically driven and can be<br>
well suited to achieving low protein levels in, for example, dipping applications such as<br>
gloves and condoms. Further, such a digested precipitate can be easily washed and/or<br>
extracted using common industry techniques.<br>
Removal of proteins and unreacted compounds from a composition can be<br>
performed by a variety of suitable methods. In one aspect, a wet-gel leaching technique can<br>
be used to remove, for example, excess calcium nitrate and/or other water-soluble non-<br>
rubber thaterials, such as, for example, proteins and added compounding ingrethents.<br>
Literature references describe protein removal by wet-gel leaching to be ineffective due to<br>
the fact that a significant portion of such proteins have typically not migrated to a surface<br>
when, for example, a film was healed to attain the wet-gel state. In one aspect, since the<br>
techniques of the present invention can remove significant portions of protein during NRL<br>
creation, the typically expected increases in protein at various stages of article (e.g., glove)<br>
production do not occur, allowing manufacturers opportunities to reduce the complexity of<br>
and/or the number of steps in the manufacturing process.<br>
In one embodiment, the methods of the present invention provide an advantage over<br>
traditional latex processing methods can be easily integrated into the current processing<br>
scheme without the need to acquire and/or install additional capital equipment<br>
TREATED NRL HAVING REDUCED ALLERGENICTTY<br>
The NRL composition formed by the method described herein can provide reduced<br>
allergenicity over traditional latex rubber products and can be suitable for use in a variety of<br>
applications. While not intending to be limited, applications for products produced from<br>
treated NRL can include medical, health care, and personal care products, such as, for<br>
example, examination and surgical gloves, condoms, breather bags, latex tubing, probe<br>
covers, and catheters, along with other applications such as threads, foams, cold seal and<br>
pressure sensitive adhesives, and balloons.<br>
 <br>
Products produced from the treated NRL composition of the present invention can<br>
demonstrate excellent resistance to aging compared to untreated NRL (e.g., Hevea) samples.<br>
In one embodiment, and while not wishing to be bound by theory, the use of aluminum<br>
hydroxide can bind and/or remove antigenic protein from a Latex composition and can also<br>
assist in the removal of species vulnerable to free radical breakdown. Removal of such<br>
species can prevent, reduce, and/or delay degradation of rubber articles produced form<br>
NRL. For example, the presence and/or contacting of aluminum hydroxide with a NRL<br>
composition can provide increased stability of freshly harvested latex. The aluminum<br>
hydroxide treatment can thus be used as a partial and/or complete replacement for<br>
surfactants. In one embodiment, a NRL composition is treated with aluminum hydroxide<br>
and is not treated and/or contacted with a surfactant In another embodiment, a NRL<br>
composition is treated with aluminum hydroxide and is treated and/or contacted with a<br>
surfactant The combination of aluminum hydroxide and surfactant treatment and/or<br>
contacting with a NRL composition can, in various embodiments, provide enhanced<br>
stability and protein removal<br>
Film samples and products made from a NRL treated in accordance with the<br>
methods of the present invention can provide a significant reduction in protein levels over<br>
products prepared using traditional methods.<br>
A treated NRL composition can have any level of antigenic protein present that is<br>
suitable for an intended application. As tolerances for antigenic proteins can vary<br>
depending upon the intended application, method of use, and human factors, the target level<br>
of antigenic protein in a treated NRL composition can also vary and the present invention is<br>
not intended to be limited to a treated NRL composition having antigenic<br>
protein level In one aspect, a treated NRL composition is free of or substantially free of<br>
- antigenic- protein. In other aspects, a treated NRL composition can-have less than .about 100<br>
µg, less than about SO µg, less than about 30 µg, less than about 20 µg, less than about 10<br>
µg, less' than about 5 µg, or less than about 2 µg of antigenic protein per gram of<br>
composition. In still other aspects, a treated NRL composition can have less man about 100<br>
µg/dm2, less than about 50 µg/dm2, less than about 30 µg/dm2, less than about 20 µg/dm2<br>
less than about 10 µg/dm2, less than about 5 µg/dm2, or less than about 2 µg/dm2 of<br>
antigenic protein.<br>
 <br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
with a complete disclosure and description of how the reduced allergenic NRL<br>
compositions and associated processes and methods are constructed, used, and evaluated,<br>
and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the<br>
scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure<br>
accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, film thickness, etc.) but some<br>
errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts<br>
by weight, temperature is in °C (Celsius) or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or<br>
near atmospheric.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A series of films were created, a first being a control sample of NRL not involving<br>
the teachings of the present invention. This thaterial was applied to a glass plate.<br>
A series of three additional films were created, in each instance, using the same<br>
NRL which was employed to make the above-reference film. 0.05% aluminum hydroxide<br>
by weight having a density of 2.42 g/cm3 and molecular weight of 78.00 was mixed and<br>
agitated with the NRL for 72 hours. Next, this sample was processed into a film on a glass<br>
plate and labeled "RA-8". A second film was created labeled "RAL-1,2". Sample RAL-1-2<br>
differed from sample RA-8 in that 0.5% lignin by weight having a density of 0.6 g/ml was<br>
mixed with 0.06% by weight aluminum hydroxide having a density of 2.42 g/cm3 and NRL<br>
for 72 hours. Next, this sample was processed into a firm on a glass plate. A third firm was<br>
created labeled "RAFS-4" Sample RAFS-4 differed from the other samples in that 0.5%<br>
fumed silica by weight having a density of 22 g/cm3 and surface area 255 mVg was mixed<br>
with 0.06% by weight aluminum hydroxide having a density of 2.42 g/cm3 and NRL for 72<br>
hours. Next, this sample was processed into a film on a glass plate. Films RA-8, RAL-I -2<br>
and RAFS-4 were analyzed by conducting LEAP assays. The following results were<br>
measured noting that, in addition to the films, the control sample of latex film was also<br>
scrutinized.<br>
ELISA Inhibition Assay (ASTM D6499-03). The data is expressed as antigenic latex<br>
protein in micrograms/gram of sample. The untreated liquid latex contained 636.3 µg/g<br>
while the control film from untreated liquid latex contained 33.0 µg/g of antigenic protein.<br>
 <br>
The RA-S liquid latex sample contained 12.1 µg/g of protein and latex film from the same<br>
sample contained 17.1 µg/g of antigenic protein. The RAL-1-2 liquid latex sample<br>
contained 12.3 µg/g of protein and the latex film from the same sample contained 0.4 µg/ml.<br>
The RAFS-4 liquid latex sample contained 12.3 µg/g of protein and latex film from the<br>
same sample contained 1.1 µg/g. Two additional samples, identified as RAP L-10 and<br>
RAPL-11 were prepared.<br>
RAPL-10 had a sample weight of 11.5g, an .extract volume of 58 ml, an inhibition<br>
assay concentration of less than 0.03 mg/ml and a surface area 2.9 dm2 when spread upon a<br>
planar surface. RAPL-10 consisted of NRL that was premixed with 0.15% (wt) Al(OH)3 in<br>
concentrated KOH and 0.50% (wt.) hgnin, for 72 hours.<br>
RAPL-11 had a sample weight of 10.5 g, an extract volume of 53 ml, an inhibition<br>
assay concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and a surface area of 2.9 dm2 when spread upon a planar<br>
surface. RAPL-11 consisted of NRL that was pre-mixed for 72 hours with 0.20% (wt)<br>
AI(OH) 3 in concentrated KOH and 0.50% (wt.) lignin prior to vulcanization.<br>
The antigenic protein levels of RAPL-10 and RAPL-11 were measured. RAPL-10<br>
exhibited a level of less than 0.2 mg/g or 0.8 mg/ml and RAPL-11 exhibited a.level of<br>
approxithately 0.8 mg/g or 2.7 mg/ml.<br>
It is quite apparent from the test data which was developed and reported above that<br>
drathatic reduction in protein levels is achieved by the relatively simple processes of<br>
denaturing protein found in natural latex rubber with, ahnnmum hydroxide alone or with<br>
lignin and a fumed silica. All of these processes are employed prior to vulcanization of the<br>
NRL. In doing so, products can be produced while reducing risks imposed upon users of<br>
NRL products, including healthcare professionals, as a result of type I hypersensitivity.<br>
Most importantly, this is accomplished without diminishing the physical properties of NRL<br>
which makes commercial products made from this thaterial so desirable.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - HEVEA VS TREATED NRL PROTEIN DETERMINATION<br>
In a second example, Hevea NRL proteins are measured by accredited test methods.<br>
The most frequently used test methods include the Modified Lowry ASTM D5712-05<br>
(Lowry) and ELISA Inhibition ASTM D6499-03 (ELISA). These test methods have unique<br>
sensitivities and specificity. They measure total protein and antigenic protein, respectively.<br>
 <br>
The Lowry test involves the reaction of latex proteins with an alkaline copper<br>
tartrate compound and the subsequent reaction of the protein-copper tartrate complex with<br>
Folin reagent, resulting in a blue color read using a spectrophotometer at 700 nm. The<br>
Lowry test is subject to interference by chemical accelerators, such as carbathates, thiurams,<br>
benzothiazoles and guanidines, used in the production of latex gloves and phenolic<br>
chemicals naturally found in latex. The Lowry test has been standardized as an ASTM test<br>
method D5712-05 for the analysis of protein in NRL and is recognized by the FDA for<br>
determination of protein levels in medical gloves.<br>
The ELISA inhibition test measures NRL antigens by using latex-specific antibothes<br>
collected from hyperimmunized rabbits. This immunochemical method is much more<br>
sensitive and reproducible than the Lowry test It also does not suffer from the limitations of<br>
interferences as does the Lowry test. The FDA does not allow protein level claims below 50<br>
micrograms per dm2 of glove. This value has no established biological relevance but is used<br>
because of the reportable limit of detection of the Lowry method.<br>
The ELISA test is designed and performed to quantify native NRL proteins in an<br>
ammoniated state. NRL film extracts, prepared in accordance with the methods of the<br>
present invention, consistently yield low total protein and antigenic protein content using<br>
the ASTM methods, however reproducibility issues and divergent values were commonly<br>
observed due to protein modification. The Lowry does not have the required sensitivity and<br>
the ELISA is prone to variable protein hydrolysis occurring during treated latex formulation<br>
which causes anomalies in antigenic protein detection. It is worth noting that donning<br>
powder can create false positives and interfere with enzyme assays (ELISA) to some degree<br>
in research laboratories.<br>
In an on-going effort to further describe treated NRL throughout its formulary<br>
process, we subjected several treated NRL unleached film extracts to direct<br>
spectrophotometric testing at 280 nm. At this wavelength, absorbed proteins can be read<br>
directly from the extract This assessment of protein has the ability to measure all proteins<br>
including any morphed proteins no longer immuno-reactive (recognized by the ELISA<br>
antibothes). The utility of this method will rely on acceptable sensitivities and freedom<br>
from interferences. Preliminary 280 nm data are consistent in a downward trend in<br>
measured protein content demonstrating reasonable reproducibility.<br>
 <br>
Table 1: Spectrophtometrk testing of 280nm and antigenic protein in treated NRL<br>
films versos untreated Hevea NRL films.<br>
 <br>
(Results provided are an average of four test film samples)<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - thatERIALS AND METHODS<br>
One metric ton each of two treated NRL variants was prepared using a scale-up<br>
process ready for commercialization and distributed to selected industrial working partners.<br>
Both treated NRL variants used for production included the same amount of Al(OH)3 with<br>
the difference being fresh vs. aged and when Al(OH)3 was added to the latex. These<br>
samples are designated as "Treated NRL A" &amp; 'Treated NRL B" respectively. It is<br>
important to note that the treated NRL was prepared on a commercial scale and was<br>
scrutinized against a double cenirifuged untreated Hevea NRL sample designated as<br>
"Control". The double centrifuge process is a popular approach taken by suppliers of latex<br>
rubber seeking to separate latex protein from latex rubber. This method is reported to<br>
reduce proteins levels by 50% compared to single centrifuged latex. The double centrifuge<br>
process yields a highly purified Hevea latex concentrate prepared by re-ceritrifuging the first<br>
centrifuged latex which has been suitably diluted. Films prepared from double centrifuged<br>
latex typically exhibit excellent clarity, low water absorption and high thelectric properties.<br>
The colloidal properties were tested on the freshly prepared treated NRL and the<br>
control Hevea NRL then again after the lattices had thatured for 21 days. The results of<br>
Treated NRL A, Treated NRL B and the control are listed in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
Table 2: Colloidal properties on fresh and aged Treated NRL and Hevea NRL.<br>
 <br>
The colloidal property results from the treated NRL pilot trial were deemed acceptable by<br>
industry standards, and therefore the lattices were compounded by standard additives, which<br>
are commonly used to produce surgical gloves.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 - SURGICAL GLOVES MADE FROM TREATED NRL<br>
Surgical gloves were coagulant dipped from all three compounds and were evaluated (Table<br>
3) for physical property measurements according to ASTM standards.<br>
Table 3: Physical properties of surgical gloves made from Treated NRL and Hevea<br>
NRL.<br>
 <br>
The physical properties of both Treated NRL A &amp; B were within industry specifications.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, again, it is believed that the surgical gloves made<br>
from Treated NRL demonstrate good stability upon aging due to the removal and<br>
deactivation by aluminum hydroxide of those molecular species that can be vulnerable to<br>
free radical breakdown. Protein results listed below in Table 4 appear to support this<br>
theory.<br>
 <br>
Table 4: ELISA ud Lowry test results for surgical gloves made from Treated NRL<br>
versos Hevea NRL.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE 5 - CONDOMS MADE FROM TREATED NRL<br>
Hevea NRL condoms are produced in very, large numbers on highly autothated<br>
production lines. This industry relies almost exclusively on Hevea NRL since its ability to<br>
form smooth, continuous films on drying and exhibits high strength.and elasticity when<br>
vulcanized and leached. A straight dipped production process is typically used for the<br>
production of condoms where a suitably shaped former is immersed in a latex mix and<br>
withdrawn, usually twice dipped, to produce a uniform layer of latex on the former. The<br>
latex deposit is dried and vulcanized before removal from the former.<br>
A suitable mixture of compounding ingrethents was used for all samples to ensure<br>
colloidal stability of the latex during processing. These properties are expressed in Table 5<br>
below:<br>
 <br>
Table 5: Influence of compounding ingrethents on Treated NRL and Hevea NRL.<br>
 <br>
To prepare for dipping, the latex compounds were adjusted to 50% total solids.<br>
Using a clean straight wall condom former for two straight dips for each sample, the former<br>
was dipped into the respective latex compound and dried for 5 minutes @125° C. Next, the<br>
former was cooled at room temperature for 2 minutes then dipped again into the latex<br>
compound. This dip was followed by a drying time of 2 minutes @125° C then the bead<br>
was rolled. After drying, the new created condom was cured for 25 minutes @125° C. The<br>
leaching was performed in hot water (93° C) for 1 minute. After leaching, the condoms<br>
were dried for 3 minutes @125?-C, then cooled at room temperature for a brief period.<br>
Next, the condoms were stripped from the former using dry starch powder. Finally the<br>
condoms were tested for physical performance (Table 6) and for EUSA and Lowry protein<br>
testing with results expressed below in Table 7.<br>
Table 6: Physical properties of condoms made from Treated NRL and Bevea NRL.<br>
 <br>
Table 6 illustrates that condoms made from Treated NRL were 30% stronger than<br>
condoms made from Hevea NRL when aged and demonstrated much better resistance to<br>
aging compared to Hevea NRL condoms.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
EXAMPLE 6 - ADHESTVES MADE FROM TREATED NRL<br>
NRL was the first polymer to be used to produce pressure sensitive adbesives (PSA).<br>
NRL has inherent advantages when used in pressure sensitive and contact adhesive<br>
formulations. NRL has a very low glass transition temperature (Tg) and also low surface<br>
energy which enables it to flow over surfaces very effectively, a key attribute of PSA.<br>
Furthermore, NRL's extremely high molecular weight gives it high internal strength<br>
preventing it from splitting during removal. The high molecular weight of NRL makes it<br>
the only thaterial that can function as a "cold seal" contact adhesive at room temperature.<br>
This is made possible because the low Tg and surface energy allow rubber films to flow<br>
cold very well while the mixing of the polymer chains is retarded by molecular weight.<br>
Some disadvantages of NRL are its ability to oxidize and become embrittled, loosing<br>
its tack and adhesion properties over time and its ability to "sensitize" skin as a result of<br>
allergic reactions. Oxidation is dealt with through use of anti-oxidants. Sensitization can be<br>
overcome with the use of a low protein starting NRL such as treated NRL, as it is<br>
understood that if high levels of protein are not present in the raw thaterial they cannot<br>
appear m the manufactured product<br>
The objective of mis phase of testing was to formulate cold seal (contact) and<br>
pressure sensitive adhesives using treated NRL and a Hevea NRL sample formulated for an<br>
adhesive compound and to conduct appropriate comparative testing for each sample. Test<br>
results are expressed in Table 8.<br>
During the formulary process, one particular observation regarding treated NRL and<br>
the/Hevea control NRL samples was the smoothness of the treated NRL sample, which is<br>
 <br>
attributed to improved stability. This can eliminate the need for filtering during<br>
compounding and assist in the adhesive coating process downstream.<br>
Table 8: Physical properties of cold seal and pressure sensitive adhesives made from<br>
treated and Hevea NRL.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
It is concluded that low protein treated NRL can be substituted for versions of<br>
untreated Hevea NRL whether treated or not in the production of cold seal and pressure<br>
sensitive adhesives without compromising the physical performance of the resultant<br>
products. The use of the low protein NRL for adhesive applications is of particular<br>
importance because post leaching techniques commonly used for the removal of water<br>
soluble thaterials are not applicable for these product applications.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 - BREATHER BAGS, TUBING AND PROBE COVERS MADE FROM<br>
TREATED NRL<br>
Several additional medical products have been produced from treated NRL. The aim<br>
of this work was to coagulant dip breather bags and tubing and to straight dip probe covers<br>
using treated NRL under manufacturing conditions used to produce products made from<br>
Hevea NRL. The protein results are illustrated below in Table 9.<br>
Table 9: ELISA and Lowry test results for projects made from Treated NRL.<br>
 <br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced: The disclosures of<br>
these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this,<br>
application.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 - FOAM MADE FROM TREATED NRL<br>
-Natural latex foam has been accepted by consumers and retailers as a premium<br>
bedding component For example, due to the impact on soundness of sleep and the<br>
increased education of consumers, one-sided thattresses that do not require flipping are<br>
 <br>
becoming an industry standard. The performance and silky, luxurious feel of latex have<br>
separated latex from other foam source materials in the marketplace.<br>
limited inforthation exists regarding antigenic protein values in foam made with<br>
Hevea latex. Total latex proteins have been analyzed in Hevea latex foam that was prepared<br>
in a manner similar to that of the present invention for the production of NRL. Table 10,<br>
below, provides a comparison of protein data for foams made with the inventive NRL and<br>
with Hevea NRL.<br>
Table 10: ELISA and Lowry Protein Test Results for Foam made from Treated NRL<br>
and Hevea NRL<br>
 <br>
In addition to having significantly fewer total proteins than foam produced with<br>
Hevea NRL, the inventive NRL foam was less odorous. This beneficial feature can be<br>
attributed to a lower level of biodegradable proteins in the inventive NRL. Other beneficial<br>
properties of the foam produced from the inventive NRL included noticeably higher opacity<br>
and whiteness.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 - PREPARATION OF TREATED NRL FILMS<br>
In another example, a series of films were prepared from field latex. The<br>
preparation of each film sample included the addition of 0.5 phr of Al(OH)3. Since Al(OH)3<br>
is insoluble, it was added to a quantity of field latex (27 % TSC) in the form of a slurry.<br>
The Al(OH)3 slurry was a combination of 1 phr of 10% ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and<br>
0.5 phr Al(OH)3. m addition, 0.1 phr of ammonium laurate was added to the field latex<br>
composition.<br>
The prepared mixture was added to the field latex and agitated for 24 hours under<br>
typical industry mixing conditions (for example, 30 rpm for 24 hours). A calculated amount<br>
of diarnmonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP), based on the amount of free magnesium<br>
present, was added to treat free Mg2+, followed by a period of 16 hours for desludging. The<br>
field latex composition was men centrifnged to obtain desirable TSC of from about 63 % to<br>
about 64 %. The composition was then diluted to about 30 % TSC with ammoniated water,<br>
 <br>
followed by a centrifuge step to reach a TSC of from about 60 % to about 62 %. Films for<br>
antigenic protein testing were then prepared according to ASTM D6499-07. Protein levels<br>
of the treated and untreated control samples are detailed in Table 11, below.<br>
Table 11 - Proteia levels of Treated and Untreated Control Samples<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE 10 - PREPARATION OF TREATED NRL FILMS<br>
In a tenth example, a foam compound was prepared having reduced amounts of<br>
antigenic protein, relative to a non-treated foam compound. The ingrethents of the natural<br>
latex composition are listed in Table 12.<br>
Table 12 - Foam Compound Ingrethents<br>
 <br>
The foam mixing process comprises first stirring Fart A to homogeneity. Next, the<br>
desired amount of Part A is weighed out into a mixing port. Part A is then added to Part B;<br>
Part B is shaken or stirred prior to the addition of Part A. The resulting mixture is kept<br>
under slow stirring for about 2 hours at ambient temperature. The mixture is then transferred<br>
into the foam mixer. The whipping speed is increased to moderate, and this speed is<br>
maintained for about 4 minutes. The whipping speed is increased above moderate, and then<br>
50% ZnO is slowly added into the foam, ZnO, in various aspects, can be added to .<br>
destabilize the liquid NRL and assist in the foaming process. After the addition, whipping<br>
is continued until a very fine foam is obtained. 50% SSF is then added, followed by<br>
whipping for another 40-80 seconds. The foam is then immediately transferred into the<br>
mould. The foam is then gelled for about 5 to 10 minutes. Once the foam is gelled, the<br>
 <br>
mould is transferred into a steam chamber, and steamed at 110 to about 120 °C for at least<br>
about IS minutes. The foam is then removed from the mould washed with water. The foam<br>
is then cured at about 50 °C for about 10 to 12 hours.<br>
