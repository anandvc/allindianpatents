FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This present invention relates generally to hot gas cleanup system used for<br>
cleaning the coal gas from ash particles and impurities at high pressure and high<br>
temperature for protecting the turbine and downstream components in advanced<br>
coal based combined cycle power generation. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to an improved hot gas filter system for filtration of fine ash particles of<br>
coal fuel gas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coal is an abundant cheaper source of fossil fuel energy for electric power<br>
generation. The present thermal power plants burn coal to generate electric<br>
power at efficiency around 30% and the polluting emissions affect the<br>
atmosphere. Hence there is a necessity to burn coal in a more efficient way with<br>
a higher environmental performance.<br>
In the newer coal based combined cycles, the coal is burnt partially to gasify at<br>
high pressure and high temperature to generate coal fuel gas, also called syn<br>
gas to drive the toping Brayton gas turbine cycle and then a bottoming Rankine<br>
steam cycle in the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) to achieve<br>
higher efficiency and lower emissions.<br><br>
3<br>
In the above coal gasification process, the high pressure high temperature coal<br>
fuel gas of carbon monoxide and hydrogen fuel has ash particulates which can<br>
adversely damage the costly turbine. Hence the coarse particles in the fuel gas<br>
are removed in cyclones and fine particles are removed in a wet venturi scrubber<br>
or dry hot gas filter having ceramic filter elements. The use of hot gas filter with<br>
ceramic filter elements can filter fine particles in the range of 0.1 - 20 microns to<br>
a very low concentration around 1 mg/Nm3 to meet the stringent demands of<br>
turbine requirements without cooling the gas.<br>
The existing hot gas filter system has a plurality of ceramic filter elements<br>
supported on a metallic tube sheet in a filter pressure vessel with an inlet on the<br>
filter side for the entry of dusty coal fuel gas and an outlet for the exit of filtered<br>
clean fuel gas. When the particles accumulate on the filter surface during<br>
filtration, the pressure drop increases and the filter surface is cleaned by a<br>
reverse pulse jet in an opposite direction through the filter elements at a<br>
pressure two to three times the operating pressure using a conventional jet pulse<br>
venturi to dislodge the dusty cake formed on the outer surface of the filter. The<br>
filtration process occurs at low velocities in the range of 50 - 200 metre/hour<br>
and at these low Reynolds number the flow induced vibration failure of filter<br>
elements do not occur. But the filter elements undergo a momentum shock<br>
during reverse pulse cleaning depending on the magnitude of the pulse pressure<br>
and the duration including a thermal shock due to cold pulse jet gas coming in<br><br>
4<br>
contact with the hot ceramic filter elements. This phenomenon lead to occasional<br>
breakage of brittle ceramic filter elements and consequently the dust<br>
concentration in the clean gas can increase above the required level and damage<br>
the turbine. This contingency leads to costly unscheduled shut down of power<br>
plant.<br>
In the prior art of US Patent 6312490, a fibrous filter has been described to serve<br>
as a failsafe device in the event of main filter damage. But this design involving<br>
a fibrous filter may not have sufficient strength to withstand the momentum<br>
shock during the pulse cleaning cycle, and may not further withstand the force<br>
required for effective sealing of the fibrous filter element in the assembly.<br>
Fibrous filer is susceptible to breakage easily. Further this art does not provide a<br>
secure assembly of the fibrous filter with the main filter.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an improved hot gas filter<br>
system which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved hot gas filter system<br>
which enables a secured assembly of a sintered porous ceramic filter with the<br>
main filter of the system.<br><br>
5<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose an improved hot gas filter system<br>
which reduces the pulse cleaning pressure and provides uniform cleaning<br>
intensity along the main filter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved hot gas filter system in which a safety<br>
filter made of sintered porous ceramic is mounted on the main ceramic filter by<br>
means of at least one high density ceramic gasket seal within a secure filter<br>
holder assembly. Such a safety filter is more porous and does not interfere with<br>
the normal filtration process by the main filter. In a situation of failure of the<br>
main filter due to breakage, the dusty gas passes through the safety filter and<br>
the dust quickly clogs the pores of the safety filter due to its deep bed filtration<br>
characteristics. The clogged safety filter does not allow the dust from the broken<br>
main filter to mix with the clean gas and thus protect the turbine and<br>
downstream components due to particle damage in the event of a main filter<br>
failure. This porous safety filter also modulates the pressure pulses during the<br>
cleaning cycle to output a higher and uniform cleaning intensity along the length<br>
of the main filter element because the porous safety filter is placed directly<br>
above the main filter and thus the dust on the main filter is dislodged with lower<br>
pressure pulse requirement.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 shows a hot gas filter system according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows assembly of the safety filter with the main filter<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Hot gas filter system used in advanced coal based combined cycles has to be<br>
designed to operate at a pressure around 30 kg/sq. cm and temperature around<br>
300 to 500 degree Celsius for removing fine ash particles in the range of 0.1 to<br>
20 microns present in coal gasified fuel gas stream.<br>
As shown in figure - 1, the hot gas filter system (15) comprises of a ceramic<br>
insulation lined carbon steel pressure vessel (10) with an alloy steel or stainless<br>
steel metallic tube sheet (04) for supporting a plurality hundreds of ceramic filter<br>
elements (02) in groups. The high-pressure ash laden coal fuel gas stream<br>
enters an port (11) of the vessel (10) and the ash particles are filtered by said<br>
plurality of main filter elements (02) in groups and the filtered clean fuel gas is<br><br>
7<br>
allowed to exit out of the filter system. When the pressure drop of the filter<br>
system increases and reaches a particular value, due to the increasing ash dust<br>
layer on the filter surface, a pulse flow of nitrogen or of the cleaned fuel gas<br>
itself is activated through a pulse gas inlet (13) into a pulse gas plenum (14) and<br>
then through the group of filter elements (02) to dislodge the dust on the filter<br>
surfaces of the group and restore the pressure drop. The different groups of<br>
filter elements (02) are cleaned alternatively so that when one group is under<br>
pulse gas cleaning, the other groups will supply filtered clean gas to ensure<br>
continuous flow of clean gas for the process.<br>
The main filter elements (02) are porous ceramic like sintered silicon carbide or<br>
sintered aluminosilicate tube with a fine particulate coating of particular pore size<br>
distribution for removing fine ash particles on the surface of the filter itself so<br>
that fine particles do not enter deeply into the pore structure of the main filter,<br>
as otherwise it will not dislodge out easily during pulse cleaning.<br>
Figure - 2 illustrates a secure method of mounting a safety filter (01) made of<br>
sintered porous ceramic which is assembled above the main filter (02). The<br>
safety filter (01) is a porous ceramic annular tube of short length and is placed<br>
above the main filter (02) which has a sintered fine particulate coating (03) for<br>
filtering fine particles and such a coating is not required for the safety filter. The<br>
main filter (02) is supported on a metallic tube sheet (04) and is housed in a<br>
filter holder assembly (05) with a cushion of at least-one high-density ceramic<br>
fiber packing seal. (06). The filter holder (05) is welded to the tube sheet (04).<br><br>
8<br>
The safety filter (01) is placed above the main filter (02) with an annular ceramic<br>
fiber gasket (07) interposed therein. A ceramic fibre packing seal (06) and the<br>
annular ceramic fiber gasket (07) act as a leak proof seal for the gas and also act<br>
as thermal expansion cushion. The main filter element (02) is below the tube<br>
sheet (04) in the dusty gas stream and the safety filter (01) is above the tube<br>
sheet (04) in the clean gas stream. The safety filter (01) is a porous annular<br>
filter made of sintered silicon carbide or sintered aluminosilicate with a high<br>
apparent porosity of around 50 to 60 % to offer low pressure drop during<br>
normal filtration and have sufficient mechanical strength. This porous safety filter<br>
is also of short length, for example, around 100 mm compared to the main filter<br>
having length around 2000 mm. During normal filtration, the gas filtered by the<br>
main filter (02) passes through the safety filter (01) with a low-pressure drop.<br>
When the main filter (02) fails due to breakage, the dusty gas enters the porous<br>
safety filter (01) and quickly clogs the pores in the safety filter (01) with dust<br>
particles and soon the clogged safety filter (01) does not allow the passage of<br>
dusty gas from the broken filter element (02) into the clean gas stream. The<br>
safety filter (01) thus acts like a fuse, cutting off the flow of dusty gas due to the<br>
breakage of the main filter (02) below it. This protective method prevents costly<br>
unscheduled shut down of power plant and the broken filter elements can be<br>
replaced during planned shut down and maintenance period.<br>
A metallic cover (08) is disposed at the top of the safety filter (01) to locate and<br>
close the safety filter (01) and form a leak proof seal using the annular ceramic<br>
fibre gasket (07) placed between the safety filter (01) and the top metallic cover<br>
(08).<br><br>
9<br>
At least two bolting screws (09) are provided which securely hold the entire<br>
safety filter assembly (01, 07, 09) in place over the main filter (02) and fastened<br>
into the threads of the filter holder (05).<br>
Since the safety filter (01) is directly disposed above the main filter (02), during<br>
the cleaning cycle the pulse gas passes through the safety filter into the main<br>
filter without any loss of pulse energy and this gives additional advantage in<br>
offering higher uniform cleaning intensity along the filter tube and the filters can<br>
be cleaned with lower pressure pulse magnitude than the conventional pulse jet<br>
cleaning with venturi and nozzle design. In the conventional jet pulse cleaning<br>
method, a venturi nozzle is positioned with a gap in the surrounding conical<br>
plenum above the group of filter elements to serve as clean gas path and there<br>
is a loss of pulse energy through this gap requiring higher pulse jet pressure.<br>
For example if the operating pressure is around 30 kg/sq.cm., the pulse pressure<br>
is of the order of 1.1 to 1. 4 times the operating pressure in the case of pressure<br>
pulse cleaning through the porous safety filter but in the conventional jet pulse<br>
venturi and nozzle case, the pressure pulse required is of the order of 3 to 4<br>
times the operating pressure. Thus the safety filter design additionally brings<br>
down the pressure rating of pulse gas pressure vessels, pulse blow down valves<br>
and pulse gas lines, all leading to lowering of capital cost of the hot gas filter<br>
system.<br><br>
