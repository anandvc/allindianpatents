The invention relates to a device for supporting an object of the kind as set forth in the preamble of claim 1, as well as to a method for supporting this object.<br>
It is known to support or mount spheres by means of a film of water, so that these usually very heavy spheres can be turned with relatively little exertion. Thus, etg. in Carrara, Italy a so-called "floating sphere" has been on show since decades which is supported on such a film of water and can be rotated by relatively little exertion, for instance by hand. Such a sphere was also on show at the 1983 IGA Exhibition in Munich.<br>
A device for mounting or supporting and for driving such a floating sphere is described e.g. in DE 38 02<br>
561.<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a supporting arrangement, in which the object supported on a fluid film is intended to be rotatable and not featuring a spherical shape. In addition, the intention is to propose a method for supporting such an object.<br>
This task is solved by a device having the features as set forth in claim 1, as well as by a method as set forth in claim 16.<br>
Expedient embodiments of the invention read from the sub-claims.<br>
According to the invention, due to the rounding of the edge at the portions adjoining the side surface areas of the obj ect the disk-shaped obj ect is able to<br><br>
return to its resting position from a slight deflection. Were the object to have sharp edges, this would result in the object tilting from a slight deflection, thus making it impossible for it to return to its resting position.<br>
in a preferred embodiment the fluid for supporting the disk is waterf so that the disk is supported, i.e. "floats", on a thin film of water.<br>
Preferably the disk comprises an approximately horizontal axis of rotation coinciding more or less with the axis of symmetry of the disk.<br>
The gap formed by the disk and the recess in the holding device in which the disk is supported has a width which is in the range of approximately 0.1 to 2 mm, more particularly approximately. 0.2 mm. The fluid present in this gap represents the film of fluid for supporting the disk.<br>
In a preferred embodiment roughly 10 to 50% of the diameter of the disk is arranged in the recess of the holding device, i.e. approximately 50 to 90% of the diameter of the disk is not in the recess of the holding device. It is especially preferred that roughly 20% of the disk height is supported in the recess.<br>
It is of advantage to provide the fluid supply centrally in the recess since this promotes uniform outflow of the fluid on both sides of the object.<br>
Advantageously at least two devices for fluid supply are provided so that the fluid film for supporting the disk is fed to advantage by two separate<br><br>
supplies.<br>
Preferably the at least two fluid supplies are arranged juxtaposed in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the disk. This then enables the generation of a torque of the disk e.g. via one or more fluid nozzles disposed slanted. The fluid supplies may also comprise valves so that fluid is able to flow only in the direction of the disk.<br>
Advantageously the at least two fluid supplies comprise independent pumps, the supplies being arranged so that when the disk is slanted one port of the two supplies is closed more than the other, as a result of which less water is able to pass through this port. This results in an elevated pressure being generated at the port which is more closed due to the pump arranged under this port, this elevated pressure acting on the disk so that the slightly slanted disk is returned to its resting position by the force generated by the pump, both supplies then again having the same opening and an equilibrium of forces exists. Due to the openings of the supply ports being covered unequally the slant of the disk thus results in the pump supplying the fluid through the more covered port exerting a greater force on the disk than the pump supplying the fluid through the port not covered as much or not at all so that the pump supplying fluid through the more covered port exerts a force on the disk which causes the slightly slanted disk to be urged back into its resting position.<br>
It is possible to arrange the fluid supply so that a torque is generated in the disk.<br>
Preferably the radii of the rounded edges of the<br><br>
disk are in the range of 5 to 50%, preferably 10 to 35% of the width of the disk.<br>
The surface areas of the disk may be configured flat or plane.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the rotatively supported disk may be configured also slightly conical at the side surface areas, i.e. the disk featuring maximum thickness at its axis of symmetry or rotation, this thickness gradually diminishing towards the edge.<br>
Preferably together with the device for supplying the fluid a reservoir is also configured below the rotatable disk so that the water flow is uniformly distributed in the recess.<br>
In the method in accordance with the invention for supporting the rotatable disk-shaped object in the holding device the movably supported object is arranged on a fluid film provided between the object and a recess provided in the holding device. In this arrangement the recess and the movably supported object are configured so that due to the special shape of the object or recess in conjunction with the fluid film and/or the fluid supply a return force is generated when the movably supported object is deflected from its resting position.<br>
Preferably the fluid film features a certain flow which affects the movably supported item i.e. the rotatable disk, so that it rotates without a force needing to be applied additionally from outside.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a supporting arrangement comprising an object in a holding device, wherein: (a) said holding device comprises a recess which receives said object; (b) said holding device comprises a device for supplying water in the region of said recess; and (c) said object is rotatably supported on a film of water in said holding device, characterised in that: (d) said object is substantially disk-shaped; (e) the peripheral edge of said object is supported in said recess; and (f) said surrounding peripheral edge is rounded in the regions adjoining the side areas of said object.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail on	<br><br>
the basis of a preferred embodiment with respect to the drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1   is a section in vertical direction through the<br>
supporting arrangement in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a magnified view of the supporting arrangement of the device as shown in Fig. 1, with ths disk slightly slanted;<br>
Fig. 3   is a perspective side view of the device in<br>
accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 4   is a section in vertical direction through the<br>
supporting arrangement in accordance with the invention with two separate supplies; and<br>
Fig. 5   is a plan view of the arrangement as shown in<br>
Fig. 4.<br>
As evident from Fig. 1 a disk 1 is supported in a holding device 2. The disk is arranged so that its axis of rotation or symmetry 4 is located approximately horizontal. The disk has a left-hand side surface area 1c and a right-hand side surface area lb which in the example embodiment shown are configured flat. The peripheral surface area la of the disk 1 is configured so that the transition from the peripheral surface area la to the side surface areas lb or 1c comprises a curvature 6.<br>
The holding device 2 comprises a recess 5 corresponding in shape more or less to that of the disk 1 peripherally, so that a gap can be configured between the recess 5 and the disk 1, this gap having more or less the same thickness all over in the resting position of the disk 1 in the absence of a water flow.<br>
Arranged in the holding device 2 are several means<br><br>
for a water supply aS in the peripheral direction of the disk 1, only one owwhich is shown in Fig, 1 so that by a suitable arrangenfifnt of the water supply a torque can be generated in thefdisk 1. In the upper portion of the water supply 3 a reservoir 5' is formed juxtaposing the recess 5.<br>
The reservoir 5' is preferably configured elongated so that the water supply is uniformly distributed in the recess 5.<br>
Illustrated in Fig. 2 is again the lower section of the support in accordance with the invention, with the disk 1 slightly slanted. Such a slant resulting, for instance, due to external effects is automatically cancelled in the configuration in accordance with the invention, i.e. the disk returning to its vertical position when subject to a flow from underneath.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the disk 1 which is able to move within the recess 5 of the holding device 2 in the directions as indicated by the arrow.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment of the invention without a disk 1 located in the holding device 2. In this arrangement the water supply 3 in the holding device 2 is configured so that two separate water supplies are provided which supply water via the respective reservoir 5'. The recess 5 may be configured as shown. However, as indicated by the broken lines it may also represent a port opening upwards so that the portion of the recess 5 is located with the smallest cross-section directly above the water supply 3. When a disk 1 is located in the recess 5 the disk 1 is subjected to the same forces due to the two supplies via the two separate<br><br>
pumps arranged under the supplies when in a perpendicu-lar position, causing it to remain perpendicular.<br>
When, however, the disk 1 is deflected from its resting position, causing it to be slightly slanted, one port of a water supply 3 is more covered so that not as much water is able to flow through this covered port as through the other non-covered port. This results in the pump located under this port producing a higher pressure since the water flow through this pump is obstructed. Due to this higher pressure a force is exerted via the water on the slightly slanted disk 1 which counteracts the deflection of the disk 1 so that the disk 1 is returned to its resting position.<br>
As evident from Fig. 5 the water supply 3 must not be arranged centrally in the reservoir 5' . The water supply 3 may have a slightly oval port extending along the direction of rotation of the disk. The broken lines indicate, the same as in Fig. 4, that the recess 5 may comprise a port with an upwardly increasing opening.<br><br><br>
