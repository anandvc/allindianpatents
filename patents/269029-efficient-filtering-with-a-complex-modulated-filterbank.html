TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a filter apparatus and a<br>
method for filtering a time domain input signal, a filter<br>
generator and a method for generating an intermediate<br>
filter definition signal, especially for the field of<br>
encoding, decoding, manipulating and filtering of audio<br>
signals, e.g. in the field of HRTF (head related transfer<br>
function).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been shown in [P. Ekstrand, "Bandwidth extension of<br>
audio signals by spectral band replication", Proc. 1st IEEE<br>
Benelux Workshop on Model based Processing and Coding of<br>
Audio (MPCA-2002), pp. 53-58, Leuven, Belgium, 2002], that<br>
a complex-exponential modulated filter bank is an<br>
excellent tool for spectral envelope adjustment of audio<br>
signals. One application of this feature is audio coding<br>
based on Spectral Band Replication (SBR). Other fruitful<br>
applications of a complex filter bank include frequency<br>
selective panning and spatialization for parametric<br>
stereo, see [E. Schuijers, J. Breebart, H. Purnhagen, J.<br>
Engdegard: "Low complexity parametric stereo coding",<br>
Proc. 116th AES convention, 2004, paper 6073] and<br>
parametric multichannel coding, see [J. Herre et al.: "The<br>
reference model architecture for MPEG spatial audio<br>
coding", Proc. 118th AES convention, 2005, paper 6447]. In<br>
those applications the frequency resolution of the complex<br>
filter bank is further enhanced at low frequencies by<br>
means of sub-subband filtering. The combined hybrid filter<br>
bank hereby achieves a frequency resolution that enables<br>
the processing of spatial cues at a spectral resolution<br><br>
which closely follows the spectral resolution of the<br>
binaural auditory system.<br>
In some applications, however, the resolution of the<br>
filter bank is still insufficient, in the sense that<br>
simple gain modifications in each subband do not suffice<br>
to truthfully model the action of a given filter. For<br>
binaural rendering of multi-channel audio by means of HRTF<br>
(head related transfer function) related filtering, the<br>
intricate phase characteristics of the filters are<br>
important for the perceived audio quality. It is of course<br>
possible to apply fast convolution methods based on the<br>
DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) as a post-process to the<br>
multi-channel rendering, but if the rendering device<br>
already contains the signals in the subband domain of<br>
complex exponential modulated filter bank, there are<br>
significant advantages in terms of computational<br>
complexity and algorithmic integration in performing the<br>
HRTF derived filtering in the subband domain, which will<br>
be outlined in more detail later. Since HRTF's are<br>
different for each individual and the derived filters<br>
depend on virtual source and/or listener positions which<br>
can for instance be changed by control signals, user<br>
interfaces or by other description signals, it is also<br>
important to be able to efficiently convert a given HRTF<br>
related filter into subband domain filters.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to<br>
provide a filter apparatus for filtering a time domain<br>
input signal, a method for filtering a time domain input<br>
signal, a filter generator or a method for providing an<br>
intermediate filter definition signal, which allow a more<br>
efficient or a more flexible manipulation of a time domain<br>
input signal with a better quality.<br>
This object is achieved by a filter apparatus according to<br>
claim 1, by a method for filtering a time domain input<br>
signal according to claim 41, a filter generator according<br><br>
to claim 25, a method for providing an intermediate filter<br>
definition according to claim 42, a system according to<br>
claim 40 or by a computer program according to claim 43.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a filter<br>
apparatus for filtering a time domain input signal to<br>
obtain a time domain output signal, which is a<br>
representation of the time domain input signal filtered<br>
using a filter characteristic having a non-uniform<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic comprising a complex<br>
analysis filter bank for generating a plurality of complex<br>
subband signals from the time domain input signal, a<br>
plurality of intermediate filters, wherein one intermediate<br>
filter is provided for each complex subband signal, wherein<br>
at least one of the intermediate filters of the plurality<br>
of intermediate filters has a non-uniform<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic, wherein the plurality<br>
of intermediate filters have a shorter impulse response<br>
compared to an impulse response of a filter having the<br>
filter characteristic, and wherein the non-uniform<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic of the plurality of<br>
intermediate filters together represent the non-uniform<br>
filter characteristic, and a complex synthesis filter bank<br>
for synthesizing the output of the intermediate filters to<br>
obtain the time domain output signal.<br>
As a second aspect, a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention is a filter generator for providing an<br>
intermediate filter definition signal comprising a complex<br>
modulated filter bank for filtering an impulse response<br>
signal indicative of an amplitude/frequency filter<br>
characteristic in a time domain to obtain a plurality of<br>
complex valued subband signals as the intermediate filter<br>
definition signal, wherein each complex valued subband<br>
signal of the complex modulated filter bank corresponds to<br>
an impulse response for an intermediate filter for a<br><br>
subband signal, wherein at least one of the complex valued<br>
subband signals comprises at least two different non-<br>
vanishing values, and wherein each complex valued subband<br>
signal is shorter than the impulse response signal.<br>
Embodiments of the first aspect of the present invention<br>
are based on the finding that a more efficient and/or a<br>
more flexible filtering (or manipulation)of a time domain<br>
input signal can be achieved in the subband domain, which<br>
is sometimes also referred to as QMF domain (quadrature<br>
mirror filter), with a better quality compared to other<br>
manipulation schemes. The gain with respect to efficiency,<br>
especially computational efficiency, is a consequence of<br>
the shorter impulse responses of the intermediate filters<br>
compared to the impulse response of a filter having the<br>
non-uniform filter characteristic in the time domain and<br>
the fact that the subband signals can be processed<br>
independently from one another. Due to the shorter impulse<br>
responses an embodiment of a filter apparatus can process<br>
each complex subband signals output by the complex analysis<br>
filter bank individually. Hence, the filtering can be<br>
carried out parallely, which speeds up the processing of<br>
the time domain input signal dramatically compared to<br>
manipulating the time domain input signal directly due to<br>
the shorter impulse responses.<br>
Embodiments according the first aspect of the present<br>
invention are especially favorable when it comes to<br>
balancing computational efficiency on the one hand and<br>
quality on the other hand. While a direct processing of the<br>
time domain input signal in the time domain can be achieved<br>
by a convolution with the impulse response of a filter<br>
having the non-uniform amplitude/frequency characteristic,<br>
which usually leads to a very good quality, the convolution<br>
requires a high computational effort because of the length<br>
of the impulse response of the filter in the time domain.<br><br>
On the other hand, transforming an audio signal into the<br>
frequency domain by performing a Fourier transformation<br>
represents the tremendous drawback that other<br>
manipulations, which are necessary in modern acoustical<br>
systems, cannot be efficiently performed in the Fourier<br>
domain with a high quality.<br>
Hence, by employing a plurality of intermediate filters,<br>
each having a shorter impulse response compared to an<br>
impulse response of a filter having the filter<br>
characteristic of a corresponding filter in the time<br>
domain, of which at least one has an impulse response with<br>
at least two non-vanishing values represents a highly<br>
favorable compromise between computational efficiency on<br>
the one hand and quality on the other hand. As a<br>
consequence, embodiments of inventive filter apparatuses<br>
represent an excellent compromise between a direct<br>
processing of the time domain input signal for instance by<br>
means of convoluting the time domain input signal with the<br>
longer impulse response indicative of the non-uniform<br>
filter characteristic, which leads to an enormous<br>
computational effort, and employing a Fourier transform,<br>
which leads to more problems in the further course of<br>
processing the signals.<br>
The advantages of the embodiments of the first aspect of<br>
the present invention unfold especially in the context of<br>
FIR-filters (final impulse response), as each of the<br>
intermediate filters of the plurality of intermediate<br>
filters has a significantly shorter impulse response<br>
compared to the impulse response of the FIR-filter in the<br>
time domain. Hence, by parallely processing the different<br>
subband signals output by the complex analysis filter bank<br>
the computational efficiency can drastically be improved.<br>
This aspect is especially important in the field of filters<br>
having long impulse responses. One field of application, in<br>
which filters with very long impulse responses frequently<br>
occur, are HRTF-related applications (HRTF = head related<br><br>
transfer function), like for instance down-mixing multiple<br>
channel audio signals for feeding to headphones, other<br>
head-related speaker systems or stereo sound systems.<br>
In many concrete applications the computational efficiency<br>
is even more increased, as the audio signals are already<br>
present in the (complex) subband or QMF domain. Hence, in<br>
many concrete implementations, the complex analysis filter<br>
bank and the complex synthesis filter bank for generating<br>
the plurality of complex subband signals from the time<br>
domain input signal and for synthesizing the time domain<br>
output signal are already present.<br>
With respect to the second aspect, embodiments of the<br>
present invention are based on the finding that a more<br>
flexible and more efficient filtering of the time domain<br>
input signal with a better quality can be achieved by<br>
providing an intermediate filter definition signal, which<br>
can for instance be provided to a filter apparatus<br>
according to the first aspect to define its intermediate<br>
filters.<br>
A significant advantage of embodiments according to the<br>
second aspect of the present invention is that an<br>
intermediate filter definition signal for a set of<br>
intermediate filters is obtained by providing an embodiment<br>
of the inventive filter generator with a filter defining<br>
signal, such as an impulse response signal indicative of an<br>
amplitude/frequency filter characteristic of a filter in<br>
the time domain or other filter definition signals. Hence,<br>
an embodiment of a filter generator provides a filter<br>
definition signal for a set of intermediate filters to<br>
effectively the same filtering as a filter in the time<br>
domain defined by the filter definition signal virtually<br>
without introducing aliasing effects. As a consequence,<br>
embodiments of an inventive filter generator enable a<br>
virtually alias free performance of an arbitrary filter in<br>
the subband domain. By utilizing an embodiment of the<br><br>
inventive filter generator arbitrary filter characteristics<br>
can be transferred from the time domain to the subband<br>
signal domain, like virtually alias free equalization, low-<br>
pass filter characteristics, high-pass filter<br>
characteristics, band-pass filter characteristics, band-<br>
rejection filter characteristics, resonance filter<br>
characteristics, notch filter characteristics or more<br>
complex filter characteristics. Among the more complex<br>
filter characteristics, a combination of several<br>
characteristics as well as HRTF-related filter<br>
characteristics are important to mention.<br>
Especially in the context of HRTF-related applications in<br>
the field of multi-channel audio systems and other high<br>
quality applications it is important to note that<br>
embodiments of the inventive filter generator enable to<br>
truthfully model an action of a given filter in the time<br>
domain in the subband domain. The virtually alias free<br>
performance, which is especially important in HRTF-related<br>
applications, is made possible as the phase characteristics<br>
of a filter in the time domain is (almost) perfectly<br>
transferred into the subband domain. Examples illustrating<br>
this will be outlined in the further course of the present<br>
application.<br>
Among the advantages of embodiments of the second aspect of<br>
the present invention is especially the significant gain<br>
with respect to the achievable computational efficiency.<br>
The complex modulated filter banks of embodiments of the<br>
inventive filter generator produce a plurality of complex<br>
valued subband signals as the intermediate filter<br>
definition signal, wherein each of the complex valued<br>
subband signal is shorter than the impulse response signal<br>
indicative of the amplitude/frequency filter characteristic<br>
in the time domain. The filter generator, hence, produces<br>
an intermediate filter definition signal comprising the<br>
output of the complex modulated filter bank with its<br>
plurality of short complex valued subband signals, which<br><br>
does not only enable a fast, efficient and parallel<br>
computation with respect to filtering a time domain input<br>
signal to obtain a time domain output signal in the frame<br>
work of an embodiment of a filter apparatus, but does also<br>
enable a fast, efficient and parallel computation of the<br>
intermediate filter definition signal itself. Compared to a<br>
direct application of the impulse response signal<br>
indicative of the amplitude/frequency filter characteristic<br>
in the time domain by convoluting the impulse response<br>
signal with the time domain input signal, the application<br>
of an embodiment of an inventive filter generator according<br>
to the second aspect of the present invention enables a<br>
simplified, faster and more efficient computation, which<br>
leads to an audibly indistinguishable result compared to<br>
the more complex convolution method.<br>
Furthermore, an embodiment of the inventive filter<br>
generator also offers the advantage of a significantly<br>
enhanced flexibility with respect to the possible filter<br>
characteristics applied in the subband domain. As arbitrary<br>
filter characteristics can be transferred from the time<br>
domain to the subband domain by an embodiment of an<br>
inventive filter generator, an enormous flexibility is<br>
introduced to audio signal processing and manipulation. For<br>
instance, an embodiment of an inventive filter generator is<br>
capable of providing an intermediate filter definition<br>
signal corresponding to an individually altered filter<br>
characteristic of an HRTF-related filter. In the field of<br>
HRTF this offers the opportunity to individually modify the<br>
HRTF filters according to the needs and hearing<br>
capabilities of an individual. Moreover, the source<br>
position as well as the listener position with respect to<br>
each other and with respect to a (simulated or calculated)<br>
environment (e.g. a concert hall, an open space, a stadium)<br>
can be adapted. This offers the great advantage of<br>
providing a listener with a great flexibility with respect<br>
to the acoustic conditions. An embodiment of the inventive<br>
filter generator, hence, provides the possibility to<br><br>
virtually switch from a stadium to a concert hall or an<br>
open field, without employing the necessity to transfer the<br>
audio signals between the time domain, the subband domain<br>
and/or the frequency domain. By employing an embodiment of<br>
an inventive filter generator all these manipulations of<br>
the audio signal can be performed inside the subband domain<br>
with a very high quality, which is perceptually<br>
indistinguishable from a signal processing in the time<br>
domain, but which offers an enormous computational<br>
efficiency improvement.<br>
This flexibility is not only limited to switching from one<br>
environment to another, e.g. switching from a stadium to a<br>
concert hall and visa versa. An embodiment of an inventive<br>
filter generator offers the possibility to alter the filter<br>
characteristics of the plurality of the intermediate<br>
filters in a quasi-continuous fashion. An application in<br>
the field of HRTF is an application of an embodiment of the<br>
filter generator and/or of the filter apparatus in a head<br>
tracking application, in which for instance the position of<br>
the listener with respect to different audio sources varies<br>
in a quasi-continuous way. Possible applications comprise,<br>
for instance, simulations and computer games with a very<br>
high quality.<br>
Another advantage of an embodiment of a filter generator is<br>
that the application of an embodiment of a filter generator<br>
is more efficient with respect to the memory usage, as an<br>
impulse response signal provided to the complex modulated<br>
filter bank of the filter generator is typically a real<br>
valued signal, whereas the intermediate filter definition<br>
signal is a complex valued signal of approximately the same<br>
over-all length. As a consequence, storing the impulse<br>
response signals compared to the intermediate filter<br>
definition signals (or the filter taps of the intermediate<br>
filters) saves memory, roughly speaking, of an order of 2.<br>
Due to the possibility of a fast and efficient parallel<br>
computation, especially in the field of memory-sensitive<br><br>
applications comprising a great parameter space with<br>
respect to the possible impulse response signals, this<br>
represents a significant advantage.<br>
In one embodiment of in an inventive filter generator the<br>
filter generator is provided with a filter definition<br>
signal, which can comprise for instance the filter taps of<br>
a digital filter in the time domain or by a transfer<br>
function in the frequency domain, which can comprise the<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic and/or the<br>
phase/frequency characteristic of a filter. In these cases,<br>
an embodiment of the filter generator furthermore comprises<br>
an impulse response signal generator, which provides the<br>
appropriate impulse response signal indicative of the<br>
resulting amplitude/frequency filter characteristic in the<br>
time domain to the complex modulated filter bank of the<br>
filler generator. Hence, the inclusion of an impulse<br>
response signal generator in some embodiments of an<br>
inventive filter generator offers an even more flexibility<br>
with respect to providing the intermediate filter<br>
definition signal, as not only the impulse response signals<br>
in the form of discrete time signals can be provided to an<br>
embodiment of the filter generator but also the filter taps<br>
or the frequency domain description of a filter in the time<br>
domain can be transferred into the subband domain by an<br>
appropriate embodiment of a filter generator.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative<br>
for the principles of the present invention of efficient<br>
filtering with a complex modulated filterbank. It is<br>
understood that modifications and variations of the<br>
arrangements and the details described herein will be<br>
apparent to others skilled in the art. It is the intent,<br><br>
therefore, to be limited only by the scope of the<br>
impending patent claims and not by the specific details<br>
presented by way of description and explanation of the<br>
embodiments herein.<br>
In. the following, objects with the same or similar<br>
functional properties are denoted with the same reference<br>
signs. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the description<br>
with respect to objects with similar or equal functional<br>
properties can be exchanged with respect to each other.<br>
Figure la illustrates in the form of a system comprising<br>
embodiments of both a filter apparatus and a filter<br>
generator the processing of a digital audio signal by means<br>
of subband filtering according to the present invention.<br>
This signal path can for instance represent a part of a<br>
spatial audio rendering system where the input is a<br>
received audio channel and the output is a component of a<br>
signal to be played back at the right ear. The input signal<br>
(Digital audio signal or time domain input signal) is<br>
analyzed by the complex analysis bank 101 by means of<br>
filtering with a set of L analysis filters followed by<br>
downsampling of a factor L , wherein Lisa positive<br>
integer, preferably larger than 1. Typically the factor L<br>
is a power of 2, preferably L = 64. The analysis filters<br>
are usually obtained by a complex modulation of a prototype<br>
filter p(v), wherein v is a positive integer indicating an<br>
index in an array of data or an index of a value in a<br>
signal not downsampled by factor L. The output of the<br>
filter bank consists of L subband signals that are<br>
processed by a subband filtering 102. This subband<br>
filtering consists of a combination of manipulations such<br>
as subband gain adjustment according to received control<br>
data and application of finite impulse response filters<br>
applied separately in each subband. The filter taps of the<br>
subband filters are obtained from an (inventive) filter<br>
converter 104 as an embodiment of a filter generator which<br>
takes as input a filter described by direct form filter<br><br>
taps, a frequency domain description or an impulse response<br>
(signal). The complex synthesis bank 103 reconstructs an<br>
output signal by means of upsampling by a factor L,<br>
filtering by L synthesis filters, summation of all the<br>
results, and extraction of the real part. The summation of<br>
all the results and the extraction of the real part can<br>
also be switched with respect to their order, as will be<br>
outlined more closely with respect to Figs, 1c and 1d.<br>
Fig. 1b shows a complex analysis bank 101 in more detail.<br>
The complex analysis bank 101 comprises a plurality of L<br>
intermediate analysis filters 120 for each subband to be<br>
output by complex analysis bank 101. To be more precise,<br>
each of the L intermediate analysis filters 120 is<br>
connected in parallel to a node 130 to which the time<br>
domain input signal to be processed is provided. Each of<br>
the intermediate analysis filters 120 is adapted for<br>
filtering the input signal of the complex analysis bank 101<br>
with respect to a center frequency of each subband.<br>
According to the center frequencies of the different<br>
subbands, each subband is labeled by a subband index or<br>
index n, wherein n is a non-negative integer, typically in<br>
the range from 0 to L-1. The intermediate analysis filters<br>
120 of the complex analysis bank 101 can be derived from a<br>
prototype filter p(v) by a complex modulation according to<br>
the subband index n of the subband to which the<br>
intermediate analysis filter 120 is applied. More details<br>
concerning the complex modulation of a prototype filter are<br>
explained below.<br>
Either directly by the intermediate analysis filters 120 or<br>
by an optional downsampler 140 (denoted by doted line in<br>
Fig. lb) the sampling frequency of the signal output by the<br>
intermediate analysis filter bank 120 is reduced by a<br>
factor L. As mentioned before, the downsamplers 140<br>
supplied to each subband signal output by the corresponding<br>
intermediate analysis filters 120 are optional as,<br>
depending on the concrete implementation, the downsampling<br><br>
can also be carried out in the frame work of the<br>
intermediate analysis filters 120. In principle,<br>
downsampling the signal output by the intermediate analysis<br>
filters 120 is not required. Nevertheless, the presence of<br>
the explicit or implicit downsamplers 140 is a preferred<br>
option as the amount of data provided by the complex<br>
analysis bank 101 would alternatively be raised by a factor<br>
of L, leading to a significant redundancy of data.<br>
Fig. 1c illustrates a possible solution for a complex<br>
synthesis bank 103. The complex synthesis bank 103<br>
comprises L intermediate synthesis filters to which the L<br>
subband signals from the subband filtering 102 are provided<br>
to. Depending on the concrete implementation of the complex<br>
synthesis bank 103 prior to the filtering in the frame work<br>
of the intermediate synthesis filters 150, the subband<br>
signals are upsampled by L upsampler 160, which reconstruct<br>
the sampled frequency of the subband signals by increasing<br>
the sampling frequency by a factor of L. In other words,<br>
the optional upsampler 160 reconstruct or reform the<br>
subband signals provided to the upsampler 160 in such a way<br>
that the information contained in each of the subband<br>
signals is retained while the sampling frequency is<br>
increased by a factor of L. Nevertheless, as already<br>
explained in the context of Fig. 1b, the upsamplers 160 are<br>
optional components, as the upsampling can also be carried<br>
out in the frame work of the intermediate synthesis filters<br>
150. Hence, the step of upsampling the subband signals<br>
carried out by the upsampler 160 can be simultaneously<br>
processed in the frame work of the intermediate synthesis<br>
filers 150. If, however, the downsamplers 190 are neither<br>
explicitly nor implicitly implemented, the upsamplers 160<br>
do not have to be implemented explicitly or implicitly.<br>
The intermediate synthesis filters 150 are connected via an<br>
output to an adder 170 which sums up the filtered subband<br>
signals output by the L intermediate synthesis filters 150.<br>
The adder 170 is further connected to a real part extractor<br><br>
180, which extracts or forms a real valued signal or rather<br>
a (real valued) time domain output signal based on the<br>
complex valued signal provided by the adder 170. The real<br>
part extractor 180 can perform this task for instance by<br>
extracting the real part of a complex valued signal<br>
provided by the adder 170, by calculating the absolute<br>
value of the complex valued signal provided by the adder<br>
170 or by another method that forms a real valued output<br>
signal based on a complex valued input signal. In the case<br>
of the system shown in Fig. la, the signal output by the<br>
real part extractor 180 is the time domain output signal<br>
output by the embodiment of the inventive filter apparatus.<br>
The second possible solution for a complex synthesis bank<br>
103 shown in Fig. 1d differs from the first possible<br>
solution shown in Fig. 1c only concerning the real part<br>
extractors 180 and the adder 170. To be more precise, the<br>
outputs of the intermediate synthesis filters 150 are<br>
connected separately from each subband to a real part<br>
extractor 180 extracting or forming a real valued signal<br>
based on the complex valued signal output by the<br>
intermediate synthesis filters 150. The real part extractor<br>
180 are then connected to the adder 170, which sums up the<br>
L real valued signals derived from the L filtered subband<br>
signals to form the real valued output signal provided by<br>
the adder 170, which in the case of the system shown in<br>
Fig. 1a is the time domain output signal.<br>
Fig. 1e shows the subband filtering 102 and its interplay<br>
with the filter converter 104 in more details. The subband<br>
filtering 102 comprises a plurality of intermediate filters<br>
190, wherein one intermediate filter 190 is provided for<br>
each complex valued subband signal provided to the subband<br>
filtering 102. Hence, the subband filtering 102 comprises L<br>
intermediate filters 190.<br>
The filter converter 104 is connected to each of the<br>
intermediate filters 190. As a consequence, the filter<br><br>
converter 104 is capable of providing the filter taps for<br>
each of the intermediate filters 190 of the subband<br>
filtering 102. More details concerning the filtering done<br>
by the intermediate filters 190 will be explained in the<br>
further course of the application. Hence, the filters taps<br>
provided to the different intermediate filters 190 and<br>
output by the filter converter 104 form the intermediate<br>
filter definition signal.<br>
Furthermore, it should be noted that the embodiments,<br>
solutions and implementations can comprise additional<br>
and/or optional delays for delaying any of the signals or a<br>
subset of signals, which have been omitted in Fig. la to 1e<br>
for the sake of simplicity. Also in the Fig. 2 to 11<br>
optional delays have been omitted for the sake of<br>
simplicity. Nevertheless, delays or delayers can be<br>
comprised in elements shown (e.g. filters) or added as<br>
optional elements in all embodiments depending on their<br>
concrete implementation.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the processing of a digital audio<br>
signal by means of direct form filtering 201. If the same<br>
filter is given as input to the filter converter 104 of<br>
Fig. 1 and the direct filtering 201, a design goal for the<br>
filter converter 104 is that the digital audio output of<br>
103 should be perceptually (or audibly) indistinguishable<br>
frcm the digital audio output of the direct filtering<br>
201, if the digital audio inputs to the complex analysis<br>
bank 101 and the direct filtering 201 are identical and<br>
the processing in the direct filtering 102 consists of<br>
pure stationary subband filtering.<br>
In the embodiment of the system shown in Fig. la to Fig.<br>
le the filter input to the filter converter 104 is given<br>
as a filter definition signal, which can for instance<br>
comprise the filter taps of a corresponding time domain<br>
filter, a frequency domain description<br>
(amplitude/frequency characteristic and/or phase/frequency<br><br>
characteristic) or an impulse response signal of the<br>
appropriate filter.<br>
In the case of the direct filtering 201 the same filter<br>
definition signal can in principle be used. Depending on<br>
the concrete implementation and the filter definition<br>
signal, the filtering can be carried out by direct<br>
application of the filter taps in the frame work a digital<br>
filter, by a discrete Fourier transform along with a<br>
transfer function or another frequency domain description<br>
or by means of convolution with the impulse response<br>
signal.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a filter<br>
converter 104 according to the present invention as an<br>
embodiment of a filter generator. The filter is assumed to<br>
be given by its impulse response. Viewing this impulse<br>
response as a discrete time signal, it is analyzed by an<br>
L-band complex analysis (filter) bank 301. The resulting<br>
subband signal outputs are then exactly the impulse<br>
responses of filters to be applied separately in each<br>
subband in the subband filtering 102. In the preferred<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the filter definition signal<br>
provided to the filter converter 104 and its complex<br>
analysis bank or complex analysis filter bank 301 is the<br>
impulse response signal indicative of the<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic of a filter, which is<br>
to be transferred into the subband domain. Hence, the<br>
output of the complex analysis (filter) bank 301 of each<br>
of the L subbands represents the impulse response of the<br>
intermediate filters comprised in the subband filtering<br>
102.<br>
The complex analysis bank 301 is in principle derived from<br>
the analysis bank 101 but it has a different prototype<br>
filter and a slightly different modulation structure, the<br>
details of which will be outlined in the following<br>
description. The same fast algorithms that are used for an<br><br>
implementation of the complex analysis bank 101 can be<br>
reused for complex analysis bank 301, leading to a very<br>
fast and very efficient conversion process.<br>
Moreover, the length of the prototype filter q(v) can be<br>
designed to be only a fraction of the length of the<br>
prototype filter p(v) . Due to the downsampling by a factor<br>
L, the length of subband filters are also a factor of L<br>
smaller than the sum of the lengths of the given time<br>
domain filter and the prototype filter q(v) . The<br>
computational effort is thus reduced in comparison to the<br>
direct form filtering 201 by approximately a factor of<br>
L/4 . The offset factor of 4 is due to the replacement of<br>
real filtering with complex filtering. Another offset is<br>
the computational cost of the complex analysis and<br>
synthesis banks 101 and 103. For efficient implementations<br>
this cost is comparable to the cost of rather short FIR<br>
filters, and hence negligible, as outlined before.<br>
Moreover, this offset of the reduction in computational<br>
cos~ does not exist for systems that already employs these<br>
two filter banks 101 and 103.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example of a given filter impulse<br>
response 400. It consists of 192 (= 64.3) nonzero taps. In<br>
other words, the impulse response 400 shown in Fig. 4<br>
comprises 192 non-vanishing values.<br>
In the present application, a non-vanishing tap or value<br>
is a tap or a value which is ideally not equal to zero.<br>
Nevertheless, due to implementation restraints in the<br>
frame work of this application a non-vanishing value or<br>
tap is a real valued or complex valued tap or value with<br>
an absolute value which is larger than a predetermined<br>
threshold, e.g. 10-s or 2-s, wherein s is a positive<br>
integer depending on the requirements of a concrete<br>
implementation. In digital systems this threshold is<br>
preferably defined in the binary system (basis 2), wherein<br>
the integer s has a predetermined value depending on the<br><br>
specifics of the implementation. Typically, the value s is<br>
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 or 32.<br>
The impulse response 400 of the system of Figure 1 is<br>
indistinguishable from this given impulse response at the<br>
resolution of the image, in a case where a L = 64 band<br>
filterbank with a prototype filter of length 640 (= 64•10)<br>
is applied and a prototype filter of length 192 (= 64•3)<br>
is used for the filter converter 104 of Figure 3. The<br>
corresponding intermediate subband filters have only 5 (=<br>
3+3-1) taps each, as will be explained later.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the impulse response 410 of the<br>
system of Figure 1 with a 64 band filterbank, in a special<br>
case corresponding to prior art usage for envelope<br>
adjustment and equalization. In this case, the subband<br>
filters or rather intermediate filters 190 are all of one<br>
tap only, so a constant complex gain is applied to each<br>
subband. For each subband, the corresponding gain is<br>
chosen to be equal to the complex frequency response of<br>
the filter of Figure 4 evaluated at the center frequency<br>
of the particular subband. As it can be seen from the<br>
result, there are severe pre-echo artefact and there will<br>
be a significant perceptual difference between the<br>
application of this filter response compared to the target<br>
impulse response 400 of figure 4.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the magnitude response 420 of the<br>
filter of Figure 4. The frequency scale of Fig. 6 is<br>
adjusted to the resolution of a 64 band filter bank ( L =<br>
64) .<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the magnitude response 430 of the<br>
filter underlying the impulse response 410 shown in<br>
Figure 5. As it can be seen, the usage of only one gain<br>
per subband results in a poor approximation to the desired<br>
frequency response. The main reason for this is the fast<br>
variation of the target phase spectrum. In fact, this<br><br>
prior art method is better suited at modeling linear phase<br>
responses.<br>
Figure 8 finally compares the performance of an embodiment<br>
of the present invention and of the prior art method of<br>
complex gain adjustment of subbands. The dotted curve is a<br>
redrawing of the target magnitude response 420 of Figure<br>
6. The dashed curve 440 is the magnitude response of the<br>
difference between the complex frequency responses of the<br>
target filter and its approximation by the prior art<br>
method. The solid curve 450 is the magnitude response of<br>
the difference between the complex frequency responses of<br>
the target filter and its approximation by the method<br>
taught by the present invention with the parameters as<br>
discussed during the description of Figure 4. As it can be<br>
seen, the error of the prior art method is small only at<br>
the 64 midpoints of filter bank subbands whereas the<br>
inventive method leads to an approximation quality in the<br>
50 dB range. It should be pointed out that this is also<br>
the level of performance one measures when comparing the<br>
output of the inventive system to the output of the<br>
reference system for an arbitrary input signal.<br>
As the comparison of the two curves 440 and 450 in Fig. 8<br>
shows, an embodiment of an inventive filter apparatus, an<br>
embodiment of a filter generator and a system comprising<br>
both embodiments offer a significant advantage concerning<br>
the quality of the manipulation of an input signal. The<br>
significant difference concerning the quality of filtering<br>
(or manipulation) of the input signal outlined above is a<br>
consequence of the fact that at least one of the<br>
intermediate filters 190 has an impulse response with two<br>
or more non-vanishing values. In other words, at least one<br>
of the intermediate filters 190 comprises at least two non-<br>
vanishing filter taps. Furthermore, it is important to note<br>
that the number of subbands L processed by an embodiment of<br>
a filter apparatus is larger or at least equal to 2.<br>
Nevertheless, the number of subbands L is significantly<br><br>
smaller than the number of frequency bands required for a<br>
comparable quality in the case of a Fourier transform-based<br>
filtering combined with a filter mainly described by an<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic and/or a phase/frequency<br>
characteristic as the transfer function of the filter.<br>
Due to the fact that the impulse response of the<br>
intermediate filters 190 are significantly shorter than the<br>
impulse response of the underlying filter characteristic in<br>
the time domain, the computations with respect to each<br>
subband can be carried out significantly faster.<br>
Furthermore, as the different subband signals can be<br>
processed independently, both an embodiment of the filter<br>
apparatus as well as an embodiment of the filter generator<br>
104 can process the respective input signals highly<br>
efficiently in a fast and a parallel manner. Hence, the<br>
processing of both a digital audio input as an input signal<br>
as well as an impulse response indicative of a filter<br>
characteristic can be carried out highly efficiently in a<br>
parallel fashion. As outlined earlier, an embodiment of an<br>
inventive filter apparatus as well as an embodiment of an<br>
inventive filter generator combine the advantages of both a<br>
direct processing of audio signals in the time domain<br>
leading to a very high quality and using a combination of a<br>
Fourier transform along with a transfer function in the<br>
frequency domain offering a high efficiency as each<br>
frequency band is only multiplied with a (complex or real<br>
valued) tap in the process of filtering the signal.<br>
On the other hand, the disadvantages of both, purely<br>
processing the input signals in the time domain, which<br>
leads to an enormous computation effort, and those of a<br>
Fourier transform, can be significantly reduced and<br>
suppressed to a level that the output of an embodiment of a<br>
filter apparatus is perceptually indistinguishable from the<br>
quality of a direct processing in the time domain.<br><br>
These two advantages offer a great flexibility for<br>
filtering digital signals with varying filtering<br>
characteristics. This is especially important in the field<br>
of HRTF, as HRTF-related filters usually have a very long<br>
impulse response. Hence, an embodiment of an inventive<br>
filter apparatus comprising a complex analysis filter bank<br>
101, a plurality of intermediate filters 190 in the subband<br>
filtering 102 and a complex synthesis filter bank 103<br>
offers especially in the field of HRTF-related applications<br>
significant computational advantages due to the possible<br>
parallel processing of subband signals.<br>
Embodiments of a filter generator and embodiments of<br>
systems comprising both a filter apparatus and a filter<br>
generator offer furthermore the advantage that filters can<br>
easily be adapted to specific environments, parameters or<br>
other specific needs of the application at hand. Especially<br>
in terms of HRTF-related applications, an embodiment of<br>
such a system can be used in head-tracking applications, in<br>
which several sources of sounds and noises as well as the<br>
position of the listener vary over time. Such an embodiment<br>
of a system comprising a filter apparatus and a filter<br>
generator therefore offer a highly efficient and flexible<br>
way to present an audio impression of a three dimensional<br>
arrangement of sound sources with respect to a varying<br>
position and orientation of a hypothetical listener via<br>
headphones or other head-related sound systems (stereo<br>
sound systems).<br>
As this last example illustrates, an embodiment of an<br>
inventive filter apparatus along with an inventive filter<br>
generator offers not only a highly efficient system for<br>
audio manipulation with an excellent quality but also a<br>
very flexible way to introduce altering audio impressions<br>
in an efficient way.<br><br>
Complex modulated filter banks<br>
In the following, let be the discrete<br>
time Fourier transform of a discrete time signal z(v) . As<br>
before, v is an integer indicating an index or a time index<br>
of a time signal, while ω = 2 n • f is the circular<br>
frequency associated to the frequency f, n is the circular<br>
number (n = 3.1415926...) and  is the imaginary<br>
unit.<br>
The complex exponential modulated L-band filterbank is<br>
defined from a real valued prototype filter p(v) of finite<br>
length. For the computations below it will be assumed by<br>
extension with zeros that the prototype filter is defined<br>
for all integers v . Given a real valued discrete time<br>
signal x{v) the analysis filter bank 101 applies, as<br>
already explained, the complex modulated prototype filters<br>
followed by downsampling by a factor L in order to output<br>
the subband signals,<br><br>
for each subband index n = 0,1,K ,L-1, and integer time index<br>
k . The time index k differs from the time index v with<br>
respect to the fact that k refers to the downsampled<br>
signals, whereas the integer v withers to signals with the<br>
full sample frequency.<br><br>
In the equations (1) and (2) θand ψ represent (constant)<br>
phase factors for filtering the real valued discrete time<br>
Given complex valued subband signals dn(k), the synthesis<br>
filter bank 103 applies filtering followed by upsampling by<br>
a factor of L and a real value extraction in order to<br>
output the real valued signals, as already explained, to<br>
obtain the output signal<br><br>
signal x(v) into complex valued subband signal and for<br>
reconstructing real valued output samples y(v) from<br>
complex valued subband signals dn(k) . It is well known<br>
that a prototype filter and fixed phase factors θand ψ<br>
can be chosen to give perfect reconstruction, y(y) = x(v), in<br>
the case where dn{k) = cn(k), that is when the subband signals<br>
are unaltered. In practice, the perfect reconstruction<br>
property will hold true up to a delay (and/or a sign<br>
change), but in the computations that follow, this detail<br>
will be ignored by allowing the use of an acausal<br>
prototype filter. The present invention is applicable to<br>
the pseudo QMF type of design as taught by PCT/SE02/00626<br>
"Aliasing reduction using complex exponential modulated<br>
filter banks". Here the prototype filter is symmetric<br>
p(-v)-p(v), and its discrete time Fourier transform P(ω)<br>
essentially vanishes outside the interval |ω|≤π/L. The<br>
perfect reconstruction is also replaced by a near-perfect<br>
reconstruction property. For the derivation that follows<br>
it will be assumed for simplicity that both perfect<br>
reconstruction holds and that P(ω)) = 0 for π|L
Moreover, the phase factors are assumed to satisfy the<br>
condition that ψ-θ is equal to an integer multiple of 4L .<br>
In a critically sampled filter bank, the alteration of<br>
subband signals prior to synthesis usually leads to the<br>
introduction of aliasing artifacts. This is overcome here<br>
due to the fact that an oversampling by a factor two is<br>
introduced by using complex valued signals. Although the<br>
total sampling rate of the subband samples is identical to<br>
the sampling rate of the discrete time input signal, the<br>
input signal is real valued and the subband samples are<br>
complex valued. As it will be outlined below, the absence<br>
of alias opens the door for efficient time invariant<br>
signal processing.<br>
Subband filtering in a complex modulated filter bank<br><br>
Consider the modification of subband filtering 102 of each<br>
subband signal obtained by filtering the analysis samples<br>
cn(k) from the complex analysis bank 101 with a filter with<br>
impulse response gn(k) prior to the synthesis (2) performed<br>
5 by the complex synthesis (filter) bank 103<br><br><br><br>
Elementary computations show that given the assumptions on<br>
the frequency response of the prototype filter, the<br>
resulting effect on the reconstructed time signal is that<br>
of a discrete time filtering<br><br><br><br>
where<br><br><br><br><br>
Here,<br>
is the discrete time Fourier<br>
transform of the filter applied in subband nfor n0and<br><br><br>
where * denotes complex conjugation. Observe here that the<br>
special case Gn(ω) = l leads to G(Ω) = L in (5) due to the<br>
assumed special design of the prototype p(v), which implies<br><br>
Another case of interest is Gn{ω) = exp(-iω) which leads to<br>
G(ω) - exp(-iLω) , so that y{v) = x(v-L).<br>
Approximating a given filter response by subband filtering<br>
Let H(ω) be a given filter (e.g. transfer function) with<br>
real valued impulse response h(v) . This data is considered<br>
as input to the filter converter 104. In view of (5) and<br><br>
(7), a trivial choice for the subband filters which result<br>
in the desired response G(ω) = H(ω) is given by<br><br><br>
with the extension gn=-g-1-n for n
with (6). In view of (7), one achieves<br><br>
The drawback of this formula is that although H(ω) is a<br>
smooth function of ω, the periodized segment of it<br>
defined by (8) will exhibit jumps and the impulse response<br>
of the subband filters will be unnecessarily long. The<br>
prior art usage of the complex pseudo QMF bank for<br>
equalization or envelope adjustment consists of applying a<br>
single gain gn in each subband, which results in the<br>
transfer function<br>
and the transfer function is interpolated between those<br>
frequencies. For target filter responses H(ω) that vary<br>
slowly as a function of the frequency ω, a first method<br>
of approximating the filter is therefore obtained by<br>
choosing<br><br>
An example of the resulting quality of this procedure is<br>
given in figures 5 and 7.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention a<br>
filter generator or a filter converter 104 is used to<br>
teach to convert the filter (defined by its impulse<br>
response) h(v)into intermediate subband filters 190 by<br>
means of the second analysis filter bank 301 which employs<br>
real valued prototype filter q(v),<br><br><br>
In terms of Fourier transforms this reads<br><br>
The advantage of this procedure is that any given filter<br>
h(v) can be efficiently transformed into intermediate<br>
subband filter responses. If q(v) has KQ L taps, a time<br>
domain filter h(v) of KH.L taps is converted into subband<br>
domain filters (12) with KH+KQ-1 taps, wherein KH and KQ<br>
are positive integers. With respect to the exemplary<br>
numbers given in the context of the description of Fig. 4,<br>
KH and KQ are equal to 3 and with a prototype filter length<br>
and an impulse response corresponding to a length of 3 •<br>
64 = 192 (L = 64) each. Hence, each intermediate subband<br>
filter 190 has an impulse response length of only 3 + 3 -<br>
l=5 taps each.<br><br>
Hence, the condition for G(ω) = H(ω) to hold is that<br>
Design of the prototype filter for the filter converter<br>
Insertion of (13) into (5) yields<br><br>
whereδ[1] = l for l = 0and δ[l] = 0 for l≠0. A simple solution to<br>
(15) is given by the brick wall filter<br><br>
This prototype filter corresponds to the choice (8) and<br>
has the disadvantage of having an infinite and slowly<br>
decaying impulse response q(v) . Instead, the present<br><br>
invention teaches to solve (15) approximately (e.g. in the<br>
least-square sense) with a finite impulse response filter<br>
q(v). The time domain equivalent of (15) is the system of<br>
linear equations for n = 0,1,K,L-1 and for all integers k,<br><br>
is the autocorrelation of p(v) . For any given support<br>
length the system of linear equations (16) can be solved<br>
in the least squares sense for a prototype filter q(v) . It<br>
is desirable to use a support significantly shorter than<br>
that of the original filter bank prototype filter p(v), and<br>
in that case the linear system (16) is over-determined. A<br>
given quality of approximation can also be traded for<br>
other desirable properties via joint optimization. One<br>
example of such a property is a low pass type of frequency<br>
response Q(ω) .<br>
In the following the determination of a multi-slot QMF<br>
representation (subband domain) of the HRTF filters is<br>
described. The filter conversion from the time domain into<br>
the complex QMF subband domain is performed by an FIR<br>
filter in the filter converter 104 of Fig. la. To be more<br>
precise, the following description outlines a method for<br>
implementing a given FIR filter h(v) of length Nh in the<br>
complex QMF subband domain. The principle of the operation<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 1a in the case of a system also<br>
comprising an embodiment of an inventive filter apparatus.<br>
The subband filtering itself is carried out by a set of or<br>
a plurality of intermediate filters 190 inside the subband<br>
filtering 102. To be more precise, the subband filtering<br>
consist of the separate application of one complex valued<br>
FIR intermediate filter gn (1) for each QMF subband with an<br><br>
index n = 0,1,..., 63. In other words, in the following<br>
description special references will be made to embodiments<br>
with L = 64 different subband signals. Nevertheless, this<br>
specific number of subband signals is not essential and<br>
the appropriate equations will also be given in a more<br>
general form.<br>
One of the key components of the system shown in Fig. la<br>
is the filter converter 104, which converts the given time<br>
domain FIR filter h(v) into the complex subband domain<br>
filters gn(1). The filter converter 104 comprises a<br>
complex analysis bank 301 similar to the QMF analysis bank<br>
101. The prototype filter of the complex analysis filter<br>
bank 301 of the filter converter 104 q(v) of length 192 (=<br>
3•64) for the specific case of I = 64 subband signals are<br>
created by solving in the least square sense the over<br>
determined system of the equation (16) . The filter<br>
coefficients q(v) or rather the relations they fulfill<br>
will be described in more detail for the case of L = 64<br>
subbands signals later on.<br>
To be more accurate in terms of mathematical description,<br>
an extension with zeros in the time domain FIR filter is<br>
defined by<br><br>
The resulting intermediate subband domain filters are based<br>
on equation (12) and can be expressed in the general case<br>
as<br><br><br>
wherein l0 and v0 are delays, 1 is an integer indicating an<br>
index of the filter taps and Nq (= NQ)is the length of the<br>
impulse response of the prototype filter g(v).<br>
It should be noted, that in the frame work of the present<br>
application under an equation being based on an equation an<br>
introduction of additional delays (cf. l0 and v0) factors,<br>
additional coefficients and an introduction of a window<br>
function or another simple function is understood.<br>
These subdomain filters have a length Lq = Kh + 2, where<br>
In the case L = 64, the expression for the subband domain<br>
filters or intermediate filters 190 becomes<br><br><br>
and Nh is the length of the impulse response h(v) of the<br>
filter characteristics to be transferred into the subband<br>
domain.<br>
In this case, the integer n=0, 1, ..., 63 is once again the<br>
index of a subband and 2 = 0, 1, ..., {Kh+1) is an integer<br>
indicating taps of the resulting intermediate filters 190.<br>
The extra addend of (-2) in equation (20) as compared to<br>
equation (12) is there, because equation (12) was developed<br>
without any regard to casualty of filters. Real<br>
implementations will cause always introduce delays. Hence,<br>
depending on the concrete implementation, additional<br>
delayers or delays can be implemented in the embodiments<br>
shown in Figs, 1a to 1e and Figs. 2 to 11, which have been<br>
omitted for the sake of simplicity in Figures mentioned.<br><br>
As outlined earlier, in many cases the system of linear<br>
equations (16) is over determined. Nevertheless, it can be<br>
solved or approximated in the least square sense with<br>
respect to the prototype filter	coefficients g(v). Solving<br>
the system of linear equations	(16) in the least square<br>
sense, leads to the filter taps of the prototype filter<br>
g(v) to fulfill the following	relations for integers v<br>

Hence, the present invention relates to the application of<br>
an arbitrary filter to a signal which is available in the<br>
transform domain of a complex exponential modulated filter<br>
bank, when this filter bank is designed to give virtually<br>
alias free performance of operations like equalization,<br>
spectral envelope adjustment, frequency selective panning,<br>
or frequency selective spatialization of audio signals.<br><br>
The present invention permits to efficiently transform a<br>
given finite impulse response (FIR) filter in the time<br>
domain into a set of shorter FIR filters, to be applied<br>
with one filter for each subband of the filter bank.<br>
The present invention also teaches how to convert a given<br>
discrete time domain filter into to a set of subband domain<br>
filters. The result is that any given filter can be<br>
implemented with a high degree of accuracy in the subband<br>
domain of a complex exponential modulated filter bank. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the filter converter consists of a<br>
second complex exponential modulated analysis filter bank.<br>
For the special case of filters that implement a pure<br>
delay, the methods of the present invention coincides with<br>
that of PCT/EP2004/004607 "Advanced processing based on a<br>
complex-exponential modulated filterbank and adaptive time<br>
framing".<br>
Furthermore, the present invention comprises the following<br>
features:<br>
-	A method for obtaining a high quality approximation to<br>
the filtering of a discrete-time input signal with a<br>
given filter, comprising the steps of<br>
-	analyzing the input signal with a downsampled complex<br>

of subband signals,<br>
-	filtering each subband signal with a subband filter,<br>
where the multitude of subband filters are obtained<br>
from the given filter by means of a filter converter,<br>

subband signals with a downsampled complex synthesis<br>
filter bank.<br>

multitude of subband signals,<br>

complex analysis filter bank in order to obtain a<br>
multitude of subband signals,<br>
-	filtering each subband signal with a subband filter,<br>
where the multitude of subband filters are obtained<br>

synthesizing an output signal from the filtered<br>
subband signals with a downsampled complex synthesis<br>

Adaptation for real cosine modulated filter banks<br>
Whereas the above derivation is based on complex modulated<br>
filter banks, a note can be made here for the critically<br>
sampled real representation obtained by a cosine modulated<br>
filter bank defined by taking the real part of the subband<br><br>
samples (1) for an appropriate phase factor θ. In this<br>
case it is no longer feasible to use the in-band subband<br>
filtering method (3) to obtain a good approximation to a<br>
given filter. However, due to the assumptions made on the<br>
prototype filter response, a generalization to a multiband<br>
filter of the type<br><br>
will be applicable, (with obvious modifications for the<br>
first and last subbands) . Due to the critical sampling<br>
there is much less freedom in the construction of the<br>
filter mask grn(1) . One has to do the following, which is<br>
obvious for those skilled in the art. For each<br>
m=0,1,K, ,L-1 , use the elementary subband signal<br>
dn{k)=δ[n-m]δ[k] as input to the real synthesis bank, and<br>
filter the resulting output y(v) with the filter h(v)to get<br>
the filtered synthesis waveform z(y) . Now use this filtered<br>
waveform as input to the real analysis bank. The resulting<br>
subband signal carries the coefficients of the masks grn(l)<br>
for n+r=m . Some reduction in work necessary for the<br>
filter is obtained by observing that the three cases<br>
m = 3κ + ε for ε = 0,1,2 can be processed in parallel by feeding<br>
the first synthesis bank with all the corresponding<br>
elementary subband signals for each case. Thus the real<br>
valued filter converter comprises three real synthesis and<br>
three real analysis bank operations. This parallel<br>
computation represents an implementation short cut for real<br>
valued filter converter for the case of a QMF band with<br>
good side lope suppression.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates an embodiment of an inventive filter<br>
apparatus for filtering a time domain input signal of an<br>
inventive filter apparatus to obtain a time domain output<br>
signal. As already mentioned in the context of Fig. la, the<br>
filter apparatus of Fig. 9 comprises a complex analysis<br>
filter bank 101, a subband filtering 102 and a complex<br><br>
synthesis filter bank 103, which outputs the time domain<br>
output signal.<br>
While Fig. 1 shows a system comprising an embodiment of an<br>
inventive filter apparatus along with an embodiment of a<br>
filter generator 104, the filter apparatus shown in Fig. 9<br>
comprises only as an option a filter converter 104, which<br>
provides the subband filtering 102 with the intermediate<br>
filter definition signal, for instance in the form of the<br>
filter taps or the impulse response for each of the<br>
intermediate filters 190 of the subband filtering 102. The<br>
filter apparatus shown in Fig. 9, comprises additional<br>
optional components, which can provide the subband<br>
filtering 102 with the filter taps for the plurality of<br>
intermediate filters 190 of the subband filtering 102.<br>
As an example, the filter taps can also be taken from an<br>
optional data base 500, which is connected to the subband<br>
filtering 102. In one embodiment, the data base 500<br>
comprises the complex valued filter taps of the<br>
intermediate filters 190. The data base can be implemented<br>
as a memory system, for instance in the form of a non-<br>
volatile memory system or volatile memory system depending<br>
on the concrete implementation. Hence, memory solutions for<br>
the data base 500 comprise ROM (ROM = read only memory) ,<br>
RAM (RAM = random access memory) , flash memory, magnetical<br>
memory, optical memory or other memory systems.<br>
Depending on the concrete implementation, a processor or a<br>
CPU (CPU = central processing unit) 510 can access the data<br>
base and provide the filter taps to the subband filtering<br>
102 or can also access the data base to provide the<br>
corresponding filter taps to the intermediate filters of<br>
the subband filtering 102. Hence, such an embodiment<br>
comprises a data base 500 from which the filter taps for<br>
the subband filtering 102 can be taken.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of an inventive filter apparatus,<br>
which is also depicted as an option in Fig. 9, the CPU 510<br>
is capable of on-line calculating the filter taps. In such<br>
an embodiment, the CPU 510 accesses the data base 500<br>
according to a set of parameters provided by the user<br>
and/or according to a set of parameters, which are based on<br>
further circumstances, reads one or more sets of filter<br>
taps for the intermediate filters of the subband filtering<br>
102 and calculates, optionally accompanied by an<br>
interpolation scheme or another estimation scheme, the<br>
desired intermediate filter taps and provides them to the<br>
subband filtering 102. In a further embodiment, the CPU 510<br>
or another processor or computer system provides the filter<br>
taps of the intermediate filters 190 to the subband<br>
filtering 102 without accessing a data base 500. In such an<br>
embodiment, the CPU 510 or another processor calculates the<br>
filter taps and provides them to the subband filtering 102.<br>
Examples for such an embodiment will be explained more<br>
closely with respect to Fig. 10.<br>
In a further embodiment depicted in Fig. 9, the CPU 510<br>
accesses a further data base 520, reads one or more filter<br>
definition signals (e.g. in the form of impulse response<br>
signals corresponding to filter characteristic in the time<br>
domain) , calculates an effective filter definition signal,<br>
for instance an appropriate impulse response, and provides<br>
the results of this computation to the filter converter<br>
104. In this embodiment, the filter converter 104 then<br>
provides the subband filtering 102 with the appropriate<br>
filter taps for the intermediate filters 190. Hence, in<br>
this embodiment, the filter converter 104 generates the<br>
effective subband filters or intermediate filters applied<br>
to each individual subband filters of each individual<br>
subband signal inside the subband filtering 102 leading to<br>
a filtering effect audibly indistinguishable from a<br>
corresponding filter applied to the time domain input<br>
signal (input signal). As consequence, this embodiment is<br><br>
also capable of on-line calculating the filter taps via the<br>
filter converter 104.<br>
An example might for instance be a device, which calculates<br>
the taps of the intermediate filters 190 of the subband<br>
filtering 102 according to a set of parameters for instance<br>
provided by the user, wherein the parameter basis is so<br>
large, that an effective predetermination of the filter<br>
taps, optionally accompanied by some sort of interpolation<br>
scheme, would not lead to the desired results.<br>
A more concrete application comes for instance of the field<br>
of dynamic chance of HRTF filters in one domain to be<br>
converted to the subband or QMF domain. As mentioned<br>
before, this is for instance relevant in applications<br>
involving a head-tracker in which the data base 520 is an<br>
HRTF data base comprising the time impulse responses of the<br>
HRTF filters. As the HRTF filters usually have very long<br>
impulse responses, the use of such a scheme is especially<br>
interesting, as the taps for the intermediate filters 190<br>
or the QMF taps are complex. Storing the data base in this<br>
domain would roughly double the memory requirements<br>
compared to the memory requirement of storing the impulse<br>
responses in the time domain. However, the advantage of the<br>
reduced memory requirement can also be employed without<br>
having a CPU 510 which calculates the impulse response<br>
provided to the filter converter 504. Instead, the data<br>
base 520 can be simply be prompted to output the<br>
corresponding definition signal, which might be an impulse<br>
response in the time domain to the filter converter 104.<br>
In Fig. 10, an amplitude/frequency characteristic 550 is<br>
illustrated in the frequency domain. In some applications,<br>
as explained before, the filter coefficients or filter taps<br>
are the intermediate filters 190 of the subband filtering<br>
102 can be stored in the data base like the data base 500<br>
of Fig. 9. Alternatively or additionally, for some<br>
applications, the filter taps of the intermediate filters<br><br>
can also be calculated by the CPU 510 of Fig. 9. In the<br>
case of a special effect filtering or a lower quality<br>
signal processing, in which aliasing effects might become<br>
tolerable (at least to some extend), the filter taps of the<br>
intermediate filters 190 after subband filtering 102 can be<br>
estimated without a filter converter 104 or another<br>
embodiment of a filter generator. Possible applications<br>
especially comprise voice transmission over low quality<br>
lines, like telephones or small band radio communications.<br>
Hence, in these applications a determination of the filter<br>
taps corresponding the transfer function 550 of Fig. 10 or<br>
another amplitude/frequency characteristic into several<br>
subbands 560 with different subband frequencies can be<br>
carried out without employing an inventive filter<br>
converter.<br>
Fig. 11 shows an embodiment of an inventive filter<br>
converter 104. As previously outlined in the context of<br>
Fig. 3, the filter converter 104 comprises a complex<br>
analysis filter bank 301 to which a (real valued) impulse<br>
response signal indicative of an amplitude/frequency filter<br>
characteristic can be supplied via an input 104a and via an<br>
optional switch 600. As outlined before, the complex<br>
analysis filter bank 301 converts the impulse response<br>
signal into a plurality of complex valued subband signals<br>
and the intermediate filter definition signal output at an<br>
output 104b of the filter converter. As indicated in Fig.<br>
la and Fig. 9, the output 104b of the filter converter 104<br>
can be connected to a subband filtering 102.<br>
As already mentioned earlier, each of the complex valued<br>
subband signals of the complex modulated filter bank 301<br>
corresponds to an impulse response for one of the<br>
intermediate filters 190 for a subband signal in the<br>
subband filtering 102 shown in Fig. la and 9. Typically,<br>
the complex valued subband signals are significantly<br>
shorter than the impulse response signal of the filter<br>
characteristic provided at the input 104a in the time<br><br>
domain. Furthermore, typically at least one of the complex<br>
valued subband signals output at the output 104b comprises<br>
at least two different non-vanishing values. Especially the<br>
last feature distinguishes the output of the filter<br>
converter 104 from a simple gain adjustment in the frame<br>
work of filtering using a direct Fourier transform<br>
procedure.<br>
If, however, the filter converter 104 is not provided with<br>
an impulse response signal indicative of an<br>
amplitude/frequency filter characteristic, but a filter<br>
definition signal, which comprises at least one of an<br>
amplitude/frequency filter characteristic, a<br>
phase/frequency filter characteristic or the filter taps in<br>
the time domain or another domain of a filter, the filter<br>
converter 104 comprises an impulse response generator 610<br>
for converting the filter definition signal into the<br>
impulse response signal, which is then provided via the<br>
optional switch 600 to the complex analysis filter bank<br>
301. In a concrete implementation, the impulse response<br>
generator 610 can for instance calculate the impulse<br>
response signal provided to the complex analysis filter<br>
bank 301 by superposition of real valued oscillations<br>
(Fourier synthesis), wherein the amplitude characteristics<br>
and the phase characteristics of the intended filter to be<br>
transferred into the complex subband domain are regarded as<br>
defined by the definition signal provided to the input<br>
104c. In other words, if at least one of an<br>
amplitude/frequency characteristic and a phase/frequency<br>
characteristic is applied to the impulse response generator<br>
610, an impulse response signal can be computed by the<br>
impulse response generator 610 by supposition of (harmonic)<br>
oscillations considering the amplitude and phase relations<br>
as defined by the filter definition signal.<br>
Possible applications of both embodiments of the filter<br>
apparatus and the filter generator and especially in the<br>
field of high quality audio coding and decoding.<br><br>
Recent developments in audio coding have provided means to<br>
obtain a multi-channel signal impression over stereo<br>
headphones. This is commonly done by downmixing a multi-<br>
channel signal to stereo using the original multi-channel<br>
signal and HRTF filters. It has been shown in prior art<br>
that the parametric multi-channel audio decoder can be<br>
combined with a binaural downmix algorithm making it<br>
possible to render a multi-channel signal over headphones<br>
without the need for first re-creating the multi-channel<br>
signal from the transmitted downmix signal, and<br>
subsequently downmixing it again by means of the HRTF<br>
filters. However, this requires that the parameters for<br>
recreating the multi-channel signal (e.g. IID, CLD<br>
parameters) are combined with the HRTF filters, which in<br>
turn requires a parameterization of the HRTF filters. This<br>
requirement for a parameterization of the HRTF filters<br>
imposes high limitation on the system, since HRTF filters<br>
can be long and thus very hard to correctly model with a<br>
parametric approach. This limitation makes it impossible to<br>
use long HRTF filters for combined parametric multi-channel<br>
and binaural downmix decoders. The crucial algorithmic<br>
component required to obtain a proper combination of multi-<br>
channel parameters and HRTF filters is to have access to a<br>
representation of the given HRTF filters in the subband<br>
domain assumed by the spatial parameters. This is exactly<br>
what is offered by the embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Once this representation is available, the HRTF<br>
filters can be combined into 2N filters as a function of<br>
the parametric multi-channel representation. This gives a<br>
significant advantage in terms of computational complexity<br>
over the method that first recreates the M channels and<br>
then applies 2M filtering operations.<br>
An example of a different application of the method<br>
employed by embodiments of the current invention is the<br>
efficient compensation for non-perfect audio rendering<br>
devices for audio content coded in the MPEG HE-AAC format<br><br>
[ISO/IEC 14496-3:2001/AMDl:2003]. Such advanced filtering<br>
steps, possibly including cross talk cancellation, can be<br>
applied directly in the subband domain prior to the time<br>
domain synthesis.<br>
Other developments in audio coding has made methods<br>
available to recreate a multi-channel representation of an<br>
audio signal based on a stereo (or mono) signal and<br>
corresponding control data. These methods differ<br>
substantially from older matrix based solution such as<br>
Dolby® Prologic, since additional control data is<br>
transmitted to control the re-creation, also referred to as<br>
up-mix, of the surround channels based on the transmitted<br>
mono or stereo channels.<br>
Hence, such a parametric multi-channel audio decoder, e.g.<br>
MPEG Surround reconstructs N channels based on M<br>
transmitted channels, where N&gt;M, and the additional<br>
control data. The additional control data represents a<br>
significantly lower data rate than that required for<br>
transmission of all N channels, making the coding very<br>
efficient while at the same time ensuring compatibility<br>
with both M channel devices and N channel devices. [J.<br>
Breebaart et al. "MPEG spatial audio coding / MPEG<br>
Surround: overview and current status", Proc. 119th AES<br>
convention, New York, USA, October 2005, Preprint 6447].<br>
These parametric surround coding methods usually comprise a<br>
parameterization of the surround signal based on Channel<br>
Level Difference (CLD) and Inter-channel coherence/cross-<br>
correlation (ICC). These parameters describe power ratios<br>
and correlation between channel pairs in the up-mix<br>
process. Further Channel Prediction Coefficients (CPC) are<br>
also used in prior art to predict intermediate or output<br>
channels during the up-mix procedure.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br><br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be<br>
performed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disc, CD or a DVD having an electronically readable control<br>
signal stop thereon, which cooperates with a programmable<br>
computer system in such that an embodiment of the inventive<br>
methods is performed. Generally, an embodiment of the<br>
present invention is, therefore, a computer program product<br>
with a program code stored on an machine-readable carrier,<br>
the program code being operative for performing the<br>
inventive methods when the computer program product runs on<br>
a computer or a processor. In other words, embodiments of<br>
the inventive methods are, therefore, a computer program<br>
having a program code for performing at least one of the<br>
inventive methods when the computer program runs of a<br>
computer.<br>
While the foregoing has been particularly shown and<br>
described with references to particular embodiments<br>
thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that various other changes in the form and details maybe<br>
made without departing from the spiritual scope thereof.<br>
It is to be understood that various changes may be made in<br>
adapting to different embodiments without departing from<br>
the broader concept disclosed herein and comprehend by the<br>
