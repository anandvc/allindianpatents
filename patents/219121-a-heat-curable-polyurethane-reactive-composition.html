				<td>Polyurethane reactive composition<br>
The present invention relates to a heat-curable polyurethane reactive composition comprising an isocyanate, an isocyanate reactive compound and a catalyst for the reaction of the isocyanate with the isocyanate reactive compound according to claim 1, an adhesive comprising said composition according to claim 18, a polyurethane obtained by heat-curing said composition according to claim 20 as well as processes for the preparation of the heat-curable polyurethane reactive composition according to claim 21 or 22.<br>
Heat-curable polyurethane reactive compositions are one-component compositions, which can be cured by heating to result in a polyurethane. They comprise an isocyanate and" a diol or a higher functional (meaning having more than two functional groups) polyol as an isocyanate reactive compound. Polyurethane reactive compositions allow simple manufacture of composites such as building panels and laminates, crash padding for vehicles, and reinforced structures in boats and aircrafts. They can be used as adhesives, sealing compositions, coating compositions, embedding compositions and the like. The use of polyurethane reactive compositions as adhesives is of particular interest, for example, in the automotive industry.<br>
EP-B-0062780 and EP-B-0103323 disclose the use of suspensions of solid isocyanates, which have been deactivated by superficial polyadduct formation.<br><br>
EP-B-0598873 describes a polyurethane reactive composition comprising a tertiary amine or an organometallic compound as a catalyst in order to enhance the reaction rate.<br>
A polyurethane reactive composition comprising a polyether polyol and a polyester polyol is known from EP-A-0431414.<br>
Conventionally, the diols or higher functional polyols used in polyurethane reactive compositions are hydroxyl-terminated polyethers. Such polyethers are inexpensive and easy to handle. On the other hand, polyether polyurethanes are known to have low mechanical properties. For demanding applications where stringent mechanical requirements must be satisfied, polyurethane reactive composition comprising polyester diols or polyols yielding polyester polyurethanes are used.<br>
Polyester polyurethanes show higher tensile strengths than polyether polyurethanes. However, polyester polyurethanes are known to show poor hydrolysis resistance. In applications where the polyurethane yielded is exposed to humidity, polyester polyurethanes are not suitable.<br>
Epoxy resins usually show a higher hydrolysis resistance than conventional polyester polyurethanes- Further, epoxy resins often show a tensile and a lap shear strength superior to the tensile and lap shear strenght of conventional polyester polyurethanes. Due to these advantages, epoxy resins are often preferred to conventional polyurethane reactive compositions. However, cured epoxy resins are brittle. Their elongation at break is low. In applications where the performance of the material under static as well as under dynamic load is of importance, the impact resistance of cured epoxy resins is often unsatisfying- The application of epoxy resins on an<br><br>
e-coated substrate, for example in the automotive industry, is not suitable because of its low elongation at break and the poor impact resistance. It is therefore highly desirable to have a product, which combines a high elongation at break with a high tensile and lap shear strength and a good hydrolysis resistance.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a polyurethane reactive composition which after curing yields a polyurethane having particularly high tensile and lap shear strength values, a high elongation at break and a good hydrolysis resistance.<br>
According to the present invention, this problem is solved by a heat-curable polyurethane reactive composition according to claim 1 comprising an isocyanate, , an isocyanate reactive compound and a catalyst for the reaction of the isocyanate with the isocyanate reactive compound wherein the isocyanate reactive compound is a diol or a higher functional polyol of a polyester, of a polyester polyurethane, of a polycarbonate or of a mixture thereof, the polyester being derived from a hydroxy carboxylic acid or from the corresponding lactone, and the catalyst is a sterically hindered bismuth compound.<br>
The term "a mixture thereof" as used herein means a mixture of one or more of any of the given components.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the composition of the present invention are defined in claims 2 to 17.<br>
The polyurethane reactive composition according to the present invention yields a polyurethane having an extraordinary tensile strength of more than 17 MPa and lap shear strength on an e-coated substrate of more than 14<br><br>
MPa. Said polyurethane shows an elongation at break of more than 300%.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the polyurethane yielded from the polyurethane reactive composition according to the present invention has a significantly enhanced hydrolysis resistance. Therefore the composition of the present invention gives excellent results when used in applications which are exposed to humidity. The above tensile properties, i.e. a tensile strength of more than 17 MPa, a lap shear strength on an e-coated substrate of more than 14 MPa, an elongation at break of more than 300%, are reached even after an exposure of seven days to 95% relative humidity at 70°C followed by an exposure of 16 hours at -40°C and 2 hours at room temperature. On e-coated substrates, the impact resistance of the polyurethane yielded by the composition of the present<br>
"■ft**	"<br>
invention surpasses the impact resistance of epoxy resins.-The lap shear failure mode of the polyurethanes on e-coated steel shows without exception a fracture in the polyurethane, the e-coat or the steel substrate even after an exposure of seven days to 95% relative humidity at 70°C followed by an exposure of 16 hours at -40°C and 2 hours at room temperature.<br>
The polyurethane reactive composition according to the present invention results in a cured product which combines the desired properties of a conventional polyurethane with the high tensile strength and hydrolysis resistance of epoxy resins as well as with a high elongation at break. The composition according to the present invention is particularly useful in applications which are exposed to humidity and on which both static and dynamic  loads  are  exerted, ^ e.g.   as  adhesive " in<br><br>
applications of the automotive industry.<br>
Additionally, the polyurethane reactive compositions according to the present invention show a relatively narrow curing peak with a temperature difference between the upper end and the lower end of the curing peak of less than 30°C, as measured in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The narrow curing range allows the curing reaction to be fast and well controlled.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the heat-curable polyurethane reactive composition comprises a solid surface-deactivated isocyanate, an isocyanate reactive polymeric compound and a catalyst for the reaction of the isocyanate with the isocyanate reactive compound wherein the isocyanate reactive compound is a diol or a polyol of a polyester or a polycarbonate or a mixture thereof, the polyester being derived from a hydroxy carboxylic acid or from its corresponding lactone, and the catalyst is a sterically hindered bismuth compound.<br>
Such a composition is generally thermoplastic and solid at room temperature. It is stable at room temperature and therefore can be stored easily.<br>
In a thermoplastic polyurethane reactive composition comprising in addition to a solid polyester polyol a liquid diol or a higher functional polyol of a polycarbonate, the "pop-off-effect", i.e. the commonly observed problem that the uncured composition springs off the substrate when cooled down after the application, is significantly reduced-<br>
In  a  preferred  embodiment,  the polyurethane  reactive<br><br>
composition comprises in addition to a solid thermoplastic polyester polyol a diol or a higher functional polyol of a polycarbonate in an amount of at least 30%, preferably at least 50% by weight of the total polyol.<br>

Said stable, liquid composition can be easily applied without melting on a substrate at room temperature and stays on the substrate without fixing. Due to the fact that the composition is liquid at room temperature, no "pop off effect" is observed.<br>
In such a liquid composition, the number average molecular<br>
weight of the polyester polyurethane preferably is from<br>
1500  Da  to  3000  Da.  The  polyester  polyurethane  is<br>

It is further preferred that the ratio of the hydroxyl groups of the polycaprolactone dial or polyol to the isocyanate groups of the asymmetric diisocyanate is from 1.2 to 3, more preferably from 1.5 to 2.5.<br>
Due to the above desirable characteristics, i .-e. easy appliance at room temperature, absence of "pop off effect", an adhesive comprising such a liquid composition is preferred.       * *<br>
Further, an adhesive comprising a thermoplastic composition and a liquid composition is preferred. Such an adhesive, also designated a "quick fix composition", has very low shrinkage and "pop-off" characteristics.<br>
The above adhesives are particularly useful for the bonding of metal to glass, e.g. in hinges and mounting studs, or for the bonding of roof modules to vehicle bodies, since no stress is applied to the glass substrate after application of the adhesive. The above adhesives are also particularly useful for the bonding of engineering polymers, more particularly polycarbonate blends.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
By the following method, stable polyurethane reactive compositions are achieved:<br>
A diol or a higher functional polyol of a polyester or of a polycarbonate or a mixture thereof is provided as an<br><br>
isocyanate reactive compound, the polyester being derived from a hydroxy carboxylic acid or from the corresponding lactone and being in its liquid form, and a compound having at least two primary amino groups is added thereto. Then, a solid isocyanate is added. Finally, a mixture comprising the isocyanate reactive compound and a sterically hindered bismuth-catalyst is added. Particularly stable polyurethane reactive compositions are achieved if a mixture comprising the isocyanate reactive compound and the compound having two or more amino groups is added'after adding the solid isocyanate. In a preferred embodiment, a polymeric primary triamine is added before adding the mixture comprising the isocyanate reactive compound and the sterically hindered bismuth-catalyst.<br>

Then, 26.15 g of a solution of 2.75% Jeffamine D-400 in the prepolymer B as obtained under b) are added under nitrogen and at high speed. Thereafter, the pressure in the mixture is reduced from ambient to 20 mbar, and 7.14 g Jeffamine T-5000 (polyoxyalkylene triamine, MW 5000, Huntsman) are admixed at moderate stirring for 10 min at 50°C. Finally, 188.17 g of the above premix are added and mixed for 20 min. The pressure is brought back to ambient and a liquid, highly viscous polyurethane reactive composition is obtained.<br>
The tensile strength, the lap shear strength and the elongation at break under different conditions after curing-were determined. The results are given in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
The adhesive obtained from example 11 is used for bonding a clevis or mounting stud to a quarter glass of a car. The stud is used as a support for a latching element. The glass is first primed on its bonding face with Betaprime 435,26 (glass primer of Dow Automotive) and let dry for 4 hours at standard conditions. The clevis is made of steel and its round base plate of 40 mm diameter is coated with a phenolic resin to be bonded onto. The bonding face is cleaned with acetone * before application of the adhesive. The 60°C warm adhesive is extruded onto the plate and the clevis is quickly mated with the primed section of the glass and fixed so that the adhesive layer has a thickness of 1 mm.<br><br>
The adhesive is cured through electromagnetic induction, using a coil shaped to the dimensions of the clevis. In the curing cycle the adhesive is heated for 10 seconds to 8 0°C, kept 30 seconds at that temperature, heated for 20 seconds to 150 °C and held at that temperature for 2 minutes and then let cool down.<br>
The material is tested for adhesion under load after one day at ambient temperature. The spring test fixture is connected to the threaded top of the stud and a pulling load of 100 kg is exerted. The assembly is placed in a 95°C circulating air oven and the time to failure is noted if failure occurs before the testing period of 2 days. The adhesive did not fail within 48 hours at 95°C.<br><br><br>
In Table 3, the failure modes of examples 11 to 19 in the lap shear testing are given.<br><br>
5  cf: cohesive failure in cured material steel: fracture in steel e-coat: fracture in e-coat<br>
bf: boundary failure (fracture near interface) af: adhesive failure<br><br>
Impact test performance:<br>
The compositions of examples 1 and 13 were tested regarding their crash resistance. Galvanised e-coated steel plates were put together forming a so called box beam by use of the corresponding composition as adhesive. The box beam was submitted to a "free fall impact" crash test . After a given impact weight hit the box beam with a given speed, the deformation after impact was determined. Fig. 1 shows a so called box beam (1) , i. e. two steel plates (2) put together by an adhesive (3) . The dimensions of the steel plate (2) are as follows: A = 22.5 mm, B = 46 mm, C = 200 mm, D = 15 mm. The thickness of the steel plate (2) is 0.62 mm, and the thickness of the adhesive<br>
(3) is 1 mm: Fig. 2 shows a test arrangement with a box beam (1) and an impact weight (4). The height of free fall<br>
(H) is 5 m or 8 m, respectively. The^ results are given in Table 4.<br><br><br>
The elongation at break and the tensile strength of examples 1, 11 and 13 were plotted in a graph and compared to the elongation at break and the tensile strength of<br><br>
conventional epoxy resins and conventional poiyurethanes. Fig. 3 illustrates that the poiyurethanes (PU) yielded after curing of the composition according to the present invention shows a high elongation at break combined with a tensile strength in the range of a tensile strength of an epoxy resin (EP) . The abbreviations in Fig. 3 have the following meanings:<br>
PU-DG: Polyurethane for direct glazing with high modulus<br>
PU-SS: semi-structural polyurethane<br>
PU-S : structural polyurethane<br>
EP-S : structural epoxy resin<br>
E. 1/11: examples 1/11<br>
E. 13: example 13<br>
The combination of a high elongation ar oreaK wit ft a high tensile strength of the poiyurethanes yielded by curing of the composition according to the present invention is further illustrated in Fig. 4.<br><br><br><br><br>
