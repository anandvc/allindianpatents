				<td>CLOSED-LOOP-BONDED FILTER MEDIA AND<br>
LINER PLEAT BLOCK AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
[0001] The invention relates to filter media and liner pleat blocks.<br>
[0002] Filter media and liner pleat blocks are known in the prior art. A<br>
layer of filter media and a mesh screen liner are pleated along axially extending pleat<br>
bend lines and wrapped in a closed loop. The pleat block extends axially along the<br>
axially extending pleat bend lines between distally opposite first and second axial<br>
ends, which axial ends may be embedded in respective first and second axial end caps<br>
to provide a filter element. When the filter media and mesh screen liner are initially<br>
wrapped around a closed loop to mating pleats, such mating pleats must be secured to<br>
each other or otherwise held in place during the noted imbedding of the axial ends in<br>
the axial end caps. The mating pleats must also be sealed to each other, to maintain<br>
filter integrity and prevent a bypass or leakage path for unfiltered fluid.<br>
[0003] The present invention arose during development efforts directed<br>
toward simplified filter media and liner pleat blocks and manufacturing methods,<br>
including maintaining filter integrity.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0004] Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a filter element including a filter<br>
media and liner pleat block in accordance with the invention.<br>

[0006] Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3-3 of Fig. 2.<br>

step.<br>

[0010] Fig. 7 is a sectional view taken along line 7-7 of Fig. 6.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] Fig. 1 shows a filter element 10 including a filter media and<br>
liner pleat block 12 which is composed of one or more layers of filter media 14, Figs.<br>
2, 3, and a mesh screen liner 16 pleated along axially extending pleat bend lines 18<br>
and wrapped around a closed loop to mating pleats 20 and 22, Figs. 1-3. The axially<br>
extending bend lines 18 extend up-down in Figs. 1, 2, and extend into and out of the<br>
page in Fig. 3. The pleat block extends axially along the noted axially extending bend<br>
lines 18 between distally opposite first and second axial ends 24 and 26, which axial<br>
ends are embedded in respective first and second axial end caps 28 and 30 to form<br>
filter element 10. Fluid to be filtered, e.g. air, liquid, etc., flows laterally inwardly as<br>
shown at arrows 32 through the filter media into the hollow interior 34 within the<br>
noted closed loop, and then flows axially downwardly as shown at arrow 34 as clean<br>
filtered fluid to the protected component, e.g. an internal combustion engine, or some<br>
other component to which clean filtered fluid is to be directed. Mating pleats 20 and<br>
22 must be secured to each other during embedding of axial ends 24 and 26 in end<br>
caps 28 and 30, as is known. Furthermore, mating pleats 20 and 22 must be sealed to<br>
each other, to maintain filter integrity, and prevent leakage of unfiltered dirty fluid<br>
into hollow interior 34. Various systems, including clips, have been used in the past<br>
to hold mating pleats 20 and 22 in place during the noted embedding, and to maintain<br>
a seal therebetween for filter integrity. The present invention provides an improved<br>
system therefor.<br>
[0012] The preferred embodiment of the present method involves<br>
melting the filter media 14 at mating pleats 20 and 22 to form a closed-loop-bonded<br>
filter media and liner pleat block. The filter media is melted at mating pleats 20 and<br>
22 to flow into the mesh screen liner, Fig. 3, such that filter media 40 from mating<br>
pleat 20 melts and flows into the mesh screen liner and bonds to filter media 42 from<br>
the other mating pleat 22 melting and flowing into the mesh screen liner. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the mesh screen liner 16 is an inner liner on the interior of the<br>
closed loop and facing hollow interior 34, and the filter media 14 is on the exterior of<br>
the closed loop.<br>
[0013] The preferred method involves ultrasonically welding the filter<br>
media along the exterior of the closed loop at mating pleats 20 and 22. A pair of<br>
ultrasonic welding heads 44 and 46, Fig. 4, are disposed on distally opposite sides of<br>
mating pleats 20 and 22. The filter media at 40 and 42 is located between and<br>
provides cushioning between a respective ultrasonic welding head and mesh screen<br>
liner. The filter media is ultrasonically welded to itself through the mesh screen liner.<br>
In one embodiment, the filter media is polyester bonded to a metallic mesh screen<br>
liner, e.g. adhesively or otherwise. This holds the filter media and liner together and<br>
provides laminated media, which laminated media is then wrapped around a closed<br>
loop to the noted mating pleats 20 and 22 which are then bonded by ultrasonic<br>
welding between ultrasonic welding heads 44 and 46 to form the noted closed-loop-<br>
bonded filter media and liner pleat block. The filter media at mating pleats 20 and 22<br>
is ultrasonically welded to itself through the mesh screen liner by melting the filter<br>
media at the mating pleats to flow into the mesh screen liner such that the filter media<br>
from mating pleat 20 melts and flows into the mesh screen liner and bonds to filter<br>
media from mating pleat 22 melting and flowing into the mesh screen liner.<br>
[0014] The mesh screen liner is provided as at least one and preferably<br>
two layers 48 and 50 between mating pleats 20 and 22. In the preferred double layer<br>
version, mesh screen liner 16 extends all the way along media 14 such that upon<br>
wrapping around a closed loop, a double layer mesh screen liner thickness is<br>
provided, namely a first layer 48 of mesh screen liner 16 along mating pleat 20, and a<br>
second layer 50 of mesh screen liner 16 along the other mating pleat 22. In the single<br>
thickness mesh screen liner version at the mating pleats, a portion of the mesh screen<br>
liner 16 is omitted at one of the mating pleats such that upon wrapping around a<br>
closed loop, only a single layer of the mesh screen liner extends between mating<br>
pleats 20 and 22.<br>
[0015] Figs. 6 and 7 show an alternate embodiment and use like<br>
reference numerals from above where appropriate to facilitate understanding. An<br>
extra strip of material 52, preferably an extra strip of filter media, is provided between<br>
first and second layers 48 and 50 of mesh screen liner 16. The method involves<br>
melting the extra strip of filter media material 52 during melting of the filter media<br>
40, 42 of mating pleats 20, 22 such that the filter media 40 of mating pleat 20 is<br>
bonded to filter media 42 of mating pleat 22 by the extra strip of melted and bonded<br>
filter media material 52 therebetween.<br>
[0016] The present system provides a filter media and liner pleat block<br>
12 including a layer of filter media 14 and a mesh screen liner 16 pleated along<br>
axially extending pleat bend lines 18 and wrapped around a closed loop to mating<br>
pleats 20 and 22. The filter media has melted portions 40,42 at the mating pleats 20,<br>
22 to form a closed-loop-bonded filter media and liner pleat block. The melted<br>
portions 40, 42 of the filter media are embedded in and re-solidified in the mesh<br>
screen liner such that filter media 40 at mating pleat 20 has melted and re-solidified<br>
portions in the mesh screen liner bonded to melted and re-solidified filter media<br>
portions 42 from the other mating pleat 22 in the mesh screen liner. The filter media<br>
is ultrasonically welded to itself through the mesh screen liner at the melted and re-<br>
solidified portions 40, 42. An extra layer of material 52, Fig. 6, preferably filter<br>
media material, may be provided between first and second layers 48 and 50 of the<br>
mesh screen liner, with the extra strip of material 52 being melted and bonded to the<br>
filter media of the mating pleats 20 and 22 such that filter media 40 of mating pleat 20<br>
is bonded to filter media 42 of mating pleat 22 by the noted extra strip of material 52<br>
therebetween.<br>
[0017] In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for<br>
brevity, clearness, and understanding. No unnecessary limitations are to be implied<br>
therefrom beyond the requirement of the prior art because such terms are used for<br>
descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. The different<br>
configurations, systems, and method steps described herein may be used alone or in<br>
combination with other configurations, systems and method steps. It is to be expected<br>
that various equivalents, alternatives and modifications are possible within the scope<br>
of the appended claims.<br>
