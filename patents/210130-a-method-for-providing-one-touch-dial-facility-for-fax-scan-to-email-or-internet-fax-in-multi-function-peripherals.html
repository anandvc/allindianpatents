FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to the Multi function Peripherals (MFP). Further, this invention relates to "one touch dial" facility for fax, Scan to Email or Internet Fax in Multi Function Peripherals (MFP) / All in One (AIO). More particularly, the invention relates to a method for providing one touch dial facility for fax, scan to Email or Internet Fax in multi function peripheral devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In order to increase user convenience, MFP / AIO devices are provided with various easy and convenient dialing methods. One Touch Dial is one among those easy and quick dialing methods. One touch dial means dialing of a fax/telephone on one touch of a key. Ordinarily, a dedicated keypad will be attached with the MFP / AIO to achieve this dialing facility and a number will be stored in the memory corresponding to each key of the keypad. This implies that if the device has to support 50 one-touch numbers, then it would require 50 dedicated keys with the machine and hence comes with the cost of 50 additional keys.<br>
However alternatives are available in the art for conferring speed dialing without using a dedicated keypad. It is found in the user guide of OKIFAX 5750 MFP (http://vtel.pageprocessor.nl/import/bestanden/pdf/Gebruiksaanwijzing_Oki_fax_5 750_eng.pdf) that it can facilitate speed dialing (one-touch or 2 and 3 digit speed dial numbers) for multiple faxing phone numbers. This MFP device provides a dedicated speed-dial key for actuating the speed-dial mode so that a user can press the dedicated speed-dial key followed by the associated digit to connect to a desired address and the device includes an LCD panel that indicates all functions and features during operation.<br>
A facsimile device capable of sending e-mails messages as well with speed dialing<br>
is available in the related art. For example Panasonic KX-PW88CL Facsimile<br>
device	along	with	a	Cordless	Phone<br>
(http://panasonic.co.jp/pcc/cs/en/telecom/otakkusu/PW88CL_English_Quick_Guid<br><br>
e.pdf) comprises a dedicated 'Speed Dial' button for activating the speed-dial mode so as to enable the user to connect to a desired address by pressing the dedicated speed-dial key followed by the associated digit. Further, this facsimile device includes an LCD panel that indicates all functions and features during operation. Another example with the same feature is Sharp UX-5000 Facsimile device (www.sharpusa.com/files/fax_man_ux5000.pdf), which has a dedicated speed dial button for actuating the speed-dial mode. A user can press the dedicated speed-dial key followed by the associated digit to connect to a desired address. However the operation manual of the above mentioned product does not mention whether e-mail addresses etc. can be programmed in the one touch-dial feature.<br>
The state of the art is also reflected in the patent literature US Patent Number US 4,567,326 titled "Telephone Apparatus for Selective Operation in a Normal and Repertory Dial Mode" which claims a telephone apparatus comprising ten keys for regular dialing and two special keys in which one special key is used to switch the telephone in an abbreviated dial mode. Each of the ten regular dialing keys may be associated with different telephone numbers. Once the telephone is switched to abbreviate dial mode, it can be connected to other telephones through one-touch dialing. But application of this device is limited only to telephone apparatus and nothing is mentioned if e-mail addresses etc. can be programmed. Similarly European Patent Number EP0863659B1 (Filed March 03, 1998) titled "User Friendly Interface for a Facsimile Machine Integrating Programmed Dialing and Monitor Dialing" assigned to Hewlett-Packard Company relates to a facsimile machine that provides programmed dialing and speed dialing features. The facsimile machine comprises a dedicated 'Speed Dial' button on its front panel and is used to invoke the speed dial function and to select between single and double-digit entries. United States Patent numbers 5,427,318, 5,491,745, 5,509,067 and 5,838,784 are also included herein by reference.<br>
US patents 5,427,318 describes a one-touch on-off showerhead valve apparatus for controlling the flow of fluid by pushbutton operation that includes a body having<br><br>
an inner cavity which is divided into first, second and third spaces by a bellows and a support plate mounted therein.<br>
The US patent 5491745 as per the description states that it tries to obviate the need for additional function keys or multiple step key activation. It also provides only twelve standard keypad keys. If further additional memory is needed it prescribes the use of additional function keys contrary to the earlier description.<br>
US patent 5,509,067 describes a dial calling method in which a multiplicity of dialing information items can be registered while decreasing the number of keys and simplifying the operation and which is capable of abbreviated-dialing and one-touch-dialing a multiplicity of called parties in accordance with the registered dialing information, and to a communication apparatus which use the method.<br>
US patent 5,838,784 describes a one-touch dial apparatus and method for registering dialing numbers in a telephone system includes a memory module divided into a plurality of memory blocks, each memory block having a number of memory locations, wherein each of the memory blocks is arranged for each of the corresponding telephones.<br>
Even as the one touch concept is there in the above patents the present invention<br>
on the other hand solves the problem in a better way. One dedicated key will be<br>
used for invoking the one touch operation and this key will be used to toggle the<br>
keypad between normal mode and one touch mode.<br>
Also prior art devices do not feature the toggling of keyboard as presented in this<br>
proposed invention where the whole keyboard changes its behavior for one touch<br>
mode.<br>
While the above referenced devices in the prior art accomplish their respective tasks, the application in a wide sense is limited for a number of reasons. Those devices either do not have dedicated key for one touch operation or they do not<br><br>
have the facility to invoke an email address associated with the key in one touch mode.<br>
It is also a drawback the device does not have an indicator like LED to indicate one touch mode. Also these devices do not feature the toggling of keyboard as presented in this proposed invention where the whole keyboard changes its behavior for one touch mode. Therefore based upon the foregoing there has been found a need to provide an MFP/AIO device having the facility one touch dialing using any of the keys available in the standard keypad.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a 'one touch dial method' to the users of MFP for fax or Scan to Email or Internet Fax in MFP/ AIO without requiring a dedicated Keypad.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method wherein one dedicated key will be used for invoking the one touch operation and this key will be used to toggle the keypad between normal mode and one touch mode.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide indicating means such as LED to indicate to the user that the machine is in one touch mode.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a method, which enables the user to configure any destination number or Email address for dialing through any of the standard keys in key pad as one-touch key.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide an MFP device that is cost effective, minimum in size and having the features for quick setting of operations such as storing Email address in Scan to Email application and Telephone Numbers or Addresses for Internet Application in MFP.<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention comprises a a method for providing one touch dial facility in a multi function peripheral device having a keypad with a dedicated key for switching between a one touch dial mode and a normal mode and having an indicator for the indication of the said one touch mode, characterized in that the said mode is switched on when the dedicated key is pressed, and if the said dedicated key is held for a predetermined time enable a user to configure a one touch number where the number associated with a key is dialed when the key is pressed and released and the said device is shifted back to a normal mode when the said dedicated key is pressed while the device is in one touch dial mode.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the flowchart for explaining the operation of the existing one touch method according to the prior art<br>
Figure 2 shows the flowchart for explaining the operation of the invention featuring one touch key configuration according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the flowchart for explaining the toggling of keypad from normal mode to one touch mode and vice versa.<br>
Figure 4 shows a block diagram indicating the parts which perform the present invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows how the invention is performed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
A Multi Function Peripheral device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described while referring to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Now referring to figure 1, the operation of the one touch dial method according to the prior art is described. A key is dedicated for a particular number and the operation includes configuring it and dialing the key. As it is apparent from the figure, the following steps are to be followed for one touch dial method.<br>
In the present invention of one touch dial method, a number can be stored corresponding to each key selected during configuration and upon single press of any key in key pad in one-touch mode, corresponding number will be dialed. The invention provides this 'one touch dial method' to the users of MFP for fax or Scan to Email or Internet Fax in MFP/ AIO without the need of a dedicated Keypad. A dedicated key will be employed for toggling the keypad between the normal mode and one touch dial mode. One LED is used for indicating if the full keypad is in one touch mode The dedicated key and the LED are new in both form and usage in this invention. Third part i.e. other keys are same as that used in the prior art but required for normal mode operation as well. The user may configure any number for dialing through any of the one-touch keys.<br>
The method of performing the invention is follows.<br>
When the dedicated key is pressed by the user, the MFP enters "one touch mode"<br>
with the keypad ready for one touch mode operation and the status is indicated by<br><br>
the LED. Any of the keys can be configured for a dial number by pressing and holding the key for a few seconds. If the key is not holding as said above, dialing process will be initiated. When dedicated key is pressed while operating in one touch mode, it goes back to normal mode and the LED is put to an off condition. Figure 2 shows the flowchart for explaining the operation of the invention featuring one touch key configuration. It shows that user needs to press one touch key once and then can configure as many numbers as required and on one touch of the key user can dial that number in one touch mode. Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows how to enter one touch mode and normal mode by using one touch mode key. When one touch key is pressed then led glows which means that machine is in one touch mode. In One touch mode, key pad will be toggled i.e. key will act as one touch key.<br>
Figure 5 explains how the toggled key pad is handled. We need to add One Touch Handler module in existing systems to handle this toggled key pad concept. We can explain the sequence of operation as follows:<br>
1.	Key is pressed in key pad.<br>
2.	One Touch Handler is called.<br>
3.	One touch handler will invoke normal operation for the key if machine is in normal mode.<br>
4.	One touch handler invokes one touch operation if machine is in one touch mode i.e. one touch led is glowing.<br>
A pseudo code can explain the one touch handler as follows. OneTouchHandler()<br>
{<br>
lf(KEY_PRESSED) /*Key has been pressed*/<br>
{<br>
if(ONETOUCH MIODE) /*One Touch LED is glowing*/<br>
{<br>
if (Hold Key ()) /*Key is hold for more than 2 sec or so*/<br>
Configure the key with number.<br>
else<br><br>
{<br>
Retrieve the number corresponding the key. Dial the Number<br>
}<br>
} else<br>
Do normal operation for the key<br>
} }<br>
A detailed description of the operation of the device according to the invention is given below.<br>
Configuration: The following steps should be followed to configure any one-touch number.<br>
1.	Check whether device is in One touch mode i.e. One touch led is glowing or not.<br>
2.	If device is not in one touch mode then press one touch key to bring the device in one touch mode.<br>
3.	Hold any key for more than 2 seconds.<br>
4.	User would be asked to enter required information for one touch e.g. one touch number, one touch id etc,<br>
5.	If one touch key is configured already then to menu for replace or not existing entry would be displayed.<br>
One Touch Dialing: steps given below should be followed to configure any one-touch number:<br>
1. Check whether device is in One touch mode i.e. One touch led is glowing or not.<br><br>
2.	If device is not in one touch mode then press one touch key to bring device in one touch mode.<br>
3.	Press the respective key.<br>
4.	If one touch number is configured corresponding to that key then that number would be dialed.<br>
5.	If one touch number is not configured, then not configured status message would be displayed on LCD<br>
The present invention provides many advantages compared to the existing art. One advantage is that the device size is minimized since the dedicated key panel is not required. Also this method can be used to store any quick setting. For example, Email addresses can be stored in Scan to Email Application and Fax numbers or email id can be stored for internet fax. It is also an achievement that the method reduces hardware cost, as only one key and one indicator need to be provided at key panel for one touch dial. Also as many as one touch numbers can be configured as many keys present in key pad.<br>
Suppose there is a MFP device as known in the prior art with 100 keys on its key pad and 40 keys out of 100 keys were dedicated for one touch dialing. In that case, only 40 numbers can be configured for one touch dialing. That means only as many as one touch number can be configured as the number of dedicated one touch keys present in the key pad.<br>
In the device of the present invention, one dedicated key for setting\resetting one touch mode has been added and all 40 dedicated one touch keys in previous art have been done away with. So, in comparison, now total of 61 keys (100-40 + 1) are present in the keypad of the MFP device instead of 100. All 60 keys except one<br><br>
touch mode key can be used for one touch dialing facility whereby 60 numbers can be configured as one touch numbers and 40 keys can be saved in the key pad.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br>
