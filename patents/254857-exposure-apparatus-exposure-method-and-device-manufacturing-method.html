BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereunder is a description of embodiments of the present invention with<br>
reference to the drawings. However the present invention is not limited to this<br>
description.<br><first embodiment></first>
A first embodiment will be explained. FIG. 1 is a summary diagram of the<br><br>
configuration of an exposure apparatus EX according to the first embodiment. In FIG. 1,<br>
the exposure apparatus EX includes a movable mask stage 3 which holds a mask M; a<br>
movable first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5, each of which holds a<br>
substrate P; a laser interference system 2 which measures position information for each<br>
stage; an illumination system IL which illuminates the mask M held by the mask stage 3<br>
with exposure light EL; a projection optical system PL which projects a pattern image of<br>
the mask M illuminated by the exposure light EL onto the substrates P; and a control<br>
device 7 which controls the operation of the entire exposure apparatus EX. The<br>
substrate here includes one a sensitive material (photoresist) is spread on a substrate of a<br>
semiconductor wafer or the like, and includes a reticule formed with a device pattern<br>
which is reduction size projected onto the substrate. In the present embodiment, a<br>
transmission mask is used as the mask, however a reflecting mask may be used.<br>
In the embodiment, an example is explained of a case in which, as the exposure<br>
apparatus EX, a scanning-type exposure apparatus (a so-called scanning stepper), in<br>
which a pattern formed on the mask M is exposed onto the substrate P while the mask M<br>
and the substrate P are simultaneously moved in a predetermined scanning direction, is<br>
used. In the following description, the direction of simultaneous movement of the mask<br>
M and substrate P (the scanning direction) in the horizontal plane is taken to be the<br>
Y-axis direction; the direction in the horizontal plane perpendicular to the Y direction is<br>
taken to be the X-axis direction (the non-scanning direction); and the direction<br>
perpendicular to the X-axis and Y-axis directions, and coincident with the optical axis AX<br>
of the projection optical system PL, is taken to be the Z-axis direction. The rotation<br>
(inclination) directions about the X axis, Y axis, and Z axis are respectively the 9X, 9Y,<br>
and 9Z directions.<br>
In the embodiment, the exposure apparatus EX is a twin-stage type exposure<br><br>
apparatus comprising a plurality of (two) movable substrate stages 4 and 5 which hold<br>
substrates P, such as have been disclosed for example in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. HI0-163099 and Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. H10-214783 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,590,634), Published Japanese Translation No. 2000-505958 of the PCT International<br>
Application (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 5,969,441), Published Japanese<br>
Translation No. 2000-511704 of the PCT International Application, Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2000-323404, Published Japanese<br>
Translation No. 2001-513267 of the PCT International Application, Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2002-158168, and similar. The<br>
exposure apparatus EX includes an exposure station ST1 which irradiates a substrate P<br>
with exposure light EL, and a measurement station ST2 which performs prescribed<br>
measurements and exchanges. The first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage<br>
5 can each move between the exposure station ST1 and the measurement station ST2<br>
while in a state of holding a substrate P.<br>
In the embodiment, the exposure apparatus EX is an immersion exposure<br>
apparatus applicable to an immersion method for substantially shortening the exposure<br>
length and improving the resolution, and also substantially expanding the depth of focus;<br>
and includes a liquid immersion system 1 which fills the space K of the optical path of<br>
the exposure light EL in the vicinity of the image plane of the projection optical system<br>
PL with a liquid LQ. Operation of the liquid immersion system 1 is controlled by the<br>
control device 7. The liquid immersion system 1 forms a liquid immersion region LR<br>
so as to fill with liquid LQ the space K of the optical path of exposure light EL between<br>
the lower surface of the final optical element FL closest to the image plane of the<br>
projection optical system PL, and the surface of the substrate P on the substrate stages 4<br><br>
or 5 positioned on the image-plane side of the projection optical system PL. In this<br>
embodiment, water (pure water) is used as the liquid LQ.<br>
The exposure apparatus EX uses a liquid immersion system 1 to fill the optical<br>
path K of the exposure light EL with a liquid LQ at least during exposure of the pattern<br>
image of the mask M onto the substrate P. The exposure apparatus EX exposes the<br>
pattern image of the mask M onto the substrate P by irradiating the substrate P with<br>
exposure light EL, which has passed through the mask M, via the projection optical<br>
system PL and the liquid LQ which fills the optical path space K. In the embodiment,<br>
the exposure apparatus EX adopts a local liquid immersion method where the liquid LQ,<br>
which fills the space K of the exposure light EL between the final optical element FL and<br>
the substrate P, locally forms an immersion region LR which is greater than a projection<br>
region AR, and smaller than the substrate P, on a region of one part of the substrate P<br>
which includes the projection region AR of the projection optical system PL.<br>
The liquid immersion region LR can be formed not only on the substrate P, but<br>
also on an object positioned at a position EP opposing (directly below) the final optical<br>
element FL on the image-plane side of the projection optical system PL; for example, the<br>
liquid immersion region LR can be formed on at least one among the upper surface 4F of<br>
the first substrate stage 4 and the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5.<br>
The illumination optical system IL is one which illuminates a predetermined<br>
illumination region IA on the mask M with exposure light EL of a uniform luminance<br>
distribution. For the exposure light EL radiated from the illumination optical system IL,<br>
for example emission lines (g-ray, h-ray, i-ray), radiated for example from a mercury<br>
lamp, deep ultraviolet beams (DUV light beams) such as the KrF excimer laser beam<br>
(wavelength: 248nm), and vacuum ultraviolet light beams (VUV light beams) such as the<br>
ArF excimer laser beam (wavelength: 193nm) and the F2 laser beam (wavelength:!57nm),<br><br>
may be used. In this embodiment, the ArF excimer laser beam is used.<br>
The mask stage 3 is moveable in the X axis, the Y axis, and the GZ direction in a<br>
condition holding the mask M, by means of drive from a mask stage driving device MD<br>
Which includes an actuator such as a linear motor. Position information for the mask<br>
stage 3 (and for the mask M) is measured by a laser interferometer 2M, which is<br>
constituent part of a laser interference system 2. The laser interferometer 2M uses a<br>
movement mirror 3K which is provided on the mask stage 3 to measure the position<br>
information of the mask stage 3. The control device 7 controls the mask stage driving<br>
device MD based on the measured results of the laser interferometer 2M, and controls the<br>
position of the mask M which is held in the mask stage 3.<br>
The projection optical system PL projects a pattern image of the mask M onto<br>
the substrate P at a predetermined projection magnification, and has a plurality of optical<br>
elements; these optical elements are held in a lens barrel PK. In the embodiment, the<br>
projection optical system PL is a reduction system with a projection magnification of for<br>
example 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, or the like, and forms a reduced image of the mask pattern on a<br>
projection area AR which is conjugate with the above-described illumination area. The<br>
projection optical system PL may be a reduction system, an equal system or a<br>
magnification system. Furthermore, the projection optical system PL may include any<br>
one of; a refractive system which does not include a reflection optical element, a<br>
reflection system which does not include a refractive optical element, or a cata-dioptric<br>
system which includes a reflection optical system and a refractive optical system.<br>
Moreover, the projection optical system PL may form either an inverted image or an erect<br>
image. Furthermore, in the embodiment, of the plurality of optical elements of the<br>
projection optical system PL, only the final optical element FL which is closest to the<br>
image surface of the projection optical system PL is contacted with the liquid LQ at the<br><br>
optical path K.<br>
Next, the movable substrate stages 4 and 5 which hold substrates P are explained,<br>
referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. FIG. 2 is a plane view seen from above of the first and<br>
second substrate stages 4, 5.<br>
The first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 are each<br>
independently movable on a common base member BP. Each of the first substrate stage<br>
4 and the second substrate stage 5 can move between the exposure station ST1 and the<br>
measurement station ST2 by moving in the XY plane on the base member BP. The<br>
illumination system IL, the mask stage 3, the projection optical system PL, and the liquid<br>
immersion system 1 are provided at the exposure station ST1, and at the exposure station<br>
ST1, the substrate P is exposed via the projection optical system PL and the liquid LQ.<br>
On the other hand, a measurement system to perform measurements of the substrate P is<br>
provided at the measurement station ST2, and the measurements and the exchange of the<br>
substrates P are executed at the measurement station ST2.<br>
The first substrate stage 4 has a substrate holder 4H which holds a substrate P,<br>
and is movable in a direction of six degrees of freedom of, the X-axis, the Y-axis, the<br>
Z-axis, the 0X, the 9Y, and the 6Z directions, on the base member BP in a condition<br>
holding the substrate P, by means of drive from a substrate stage driving device PD<br>
which includes an actuator such as a linear motor. The substrate holder 4H is arranged<br>
in a recess portion 4R which is provided in the first substrate stage 4, and an upper<br>
surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 other than the recess portion 4R becomes a flat<br>
surface of approximately the same height (flush) as the surface of the substrate P which is<br>
held in the substrate holder 4H. This is because a part of the immersion region LR<br>
which runs out from the surface of the substrate P is formed on the upper surface 4F, at<br>
for example the time of the exposure operation of the substrate P. Only one part of the<br><br>
upper surface 4F of the substrate stage 4, for example, a predetermined region<br>
surrounding the substrate P (including the region where the immersion region LR runs<br>
out), may be approximately the same height as the surface of the substrate P.<br>
Furthermore, if the optical path space K on the image surface side of the projection<br>
optical system PL is continuously filled with the liquid LQ (for example the immersion<br>
region LR can be favorably maintained), then there may be a step between the surface of<br>
the substrate P which is held in the substrate holder 4H, and the upper surface 4F of the<br>
first substrate stage 4. Furthermore, the substrate holder 4H may be formed as one with<br>
one part of the substrate stage 4. However, in the embodiment, the substrate holder 4H<br>
and the substrate stage 4 are made separate, and the substrate holder 4H is secured in the<br>
substrate stage 4 by, for example, vacuum attraction.<br>
The second substrate stage 5 has a substrate holder 5H which holds a substrate P,<br>
and is movable in a direction of six degrees of freedom of, the X-axis, the Y-axis, the<br>
Z-axis, the 0X, the BY, and the 9Z directions, on the base member BP in a condition<br>
holding the substrate P, by means of drive from a substrate stage driving device PD<br>
which includes an actuator such as a linear motor. The substrate holder 5H is arranged<br>
in a recess portion 5R which is provided in the second substrate stage 5, and an upper<br>
surface 5F of the first substrate stage 5 other than the recess portion 5R becomes a flat<br>
surface of approximately the same height (flush) as the surface of the substrate P which is<br>
held in the substrate holder 5H. This is because a part of the immersion region LR<br>
which runs out from the surface of the substrate P is formed on the upper surface 5F, at<br>
for example the time of the exposure operation of the substrate P. Only one part of the<br>
upper surface 5F of the substrate stage 5, for example, a predetermined region<br>
surrounding the substrate P (including the region where the immersion region LR runs<br>
out), may be approximately the same height as the surface of the substrate P.<br><br>
Furthermore, if the optical path space K on the image surface side of the projection<br>
optical system PL is continuously filled with the liquid LQ (for example the immersion<br>
region LR can be favorably maintained), then there may be a step between the surface of<br>
the substrate P which is held in the substrate holder 5H, and the upper surface 5F of the<br>
second substrate stage 5.<br>
Position information for the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage<br>
5 is measured by a laser interferometer 2P which is constituent part of the laser<br>
interference system 2. Laser interferometers 2P are provided at both the exposure<br>
station ST1 and at the measurement station ST2. The laser interferometer 2P provided<br>
at the exposure station ST1 measures position information for the first substrate stage 4<br>
(or the second substrate stage 5) existing at the exposure station ST1. The laser<br>
interferometer 2P provided at the measurement station ST2 measures position<br>
information for the second substrate stage 5 (or first substrate stage 4) existing at the<br>
measurement station ST2. Movement mirrors 4K, 5K are provided at prescribed<br>
positions on each of the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5. The<br>
laser interferometers 2P uses the movement mirrors 4K, 5K to measure the position<br>
information of the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 along the<br>
X-axis, the Y-axis, and the BZ directions, and so to measure position information of each<br>
of the substrates P held by the first and second substrate stages 4, 5.<br>
The laser interferometer system 2 may also be capable of measuring the position<br>
in the Z axis direction of the substrate stage 4 or the substrate stage 5, and the rotation<br>
information in the 9X and the 9Y directions. More detail of this is disclosed for<br>
example in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-510577<br>
(corresponding PCT International Publication No. WO 1999/28790). Furthermore,<br>
instead of fixing the movement mirror 4K (5K) to the substrate stage 4 (the substrate<br><br>
stage 5), a reflection surface may be used where for example a part (the side face or the<br>
like) of the substrate stage 4 (the substrate stage 5) is formed by a mirror polishing<br>
process.<br>
Furthermore, focus/leveling detection systems 8, which detect surface position<br>
information (position information along the Z-axis, 6X, 9Y directions) for the surface of<br>
the substrate P held by the first or second substrate stages 4, 5, are provided at the<br>
exposure station ST1 and at the measurement station ST2. The focus/leveling detection<br>
systems 8 includes a projection system 8A, which irradiates the surface of the substrate P<br>
with detection light La from an oblique direction, and a light-receiving system 8B which<br>
can receive detection light La reflected by the surface of the substrate P. The<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8 provided at the exposure station ST1 detects surface<br>
position information for the surface of the substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4<br>
(or the second substrate stage 5) existing at the exposure station ST1. The<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8 provided at the measurement station ST2 detects<br>
surface position information for the surface of the substrate P held by the second<br>
substrate stage 5 (or first substrate stage 4) existing at the measurement station ST2.<br>
The control device 7 drives the substrate station driving device PD based on<br>
measurement results of the laser interferometer 2P and detection results of the<br>
focus/leveling detection systems 8, and can control the positions of the substrates P held<br>
by the first and second substrate stages 4 and 5.<br>
Although not shown, as a measurement system in addition to the<br>
above-described focus/leveling detection system 8, an alignment system is provided at<br>
the measurement station ST2 to detect alignment marks provided on substrates P or<br>
reference marks provided on a substrate stage, similar to that disclosed for example in<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H04-65603. And as<br><br>
shown in FIG. 2, a transport system 9 is provided in proximity to the measurement station<br>
ST2 for the purpose of exchanging substrates P. The control device 7 can perform<br>
substrate exchange tasks, using the transport system 9 to unload a substrate P for which<br>
exposure processing is completed, on the first substrate stage 4 (or the second substrate<br>
stage 5) which has been moved to the substrate exchange position (loading position) of<br>
the measurement station ST2, and loading a substrate to be subjected to exposure<br>
processing onto the first substrate stage 4 (or the second substrate stage 5).<br>
The exposure apparatus EX of this embodiment includes a movable cap member<br>
30 which can hold liquid LQ between the member and the final optical element FL.<br>
The cap member 30 is formed in a size and shape according to a nozzle member 6,<br>
described below, and in this embodiment has a sheet-shape member which in plane view<br>
is substantially circular in shape. The surface of the cap member 30 has the property of<br>
repelling the liquid LQ. In this embodiment, the cap member 30 is formed using a<br>
material such as for example a fluoride resin material comprising polytetrafluoroethylene<br>
or another material with liquid-repellency. The cap member 30 may also be formed<br>
from stainless steel, titanium, or another prescribed metal, and the surface covered with a<br>
material having liquid-repellency.<br>
A cap holder 4C which attachably and detachably holds the cap member 30 is<br>
provided on the first substrate stage 4. Similarly, a cap holder 5C which attachably and<br>
detachably holds the cap member 30 is provided on the second substrate stage 5. That<br>
is, the cap member 30 is attachably and detachably provided on both the first substrate<br>
stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5. The cap holders 4C, 5C have a vacuum chuck<br>
mechanism, for example, and use vacuum clamping to hold the cap member 30. When<br>
the cap member 30 is formed from a magnetic material (metal), the cap holders 4C, 5C<br>
may have a mechanism to hold the cap member 30 by magnetic force.<br><br>
In this embodiment, the exposure apparatus EX includes one cap member 30.<br>
Hence when the cap member 30 is held by the cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4,<br>
the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5 does not hold the cap member 30, and<br>
is in the empty state. Similarly, when the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5<br>
holds the cap member 30, the cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4 does not hold<br>
the cap member 30, and is in the empty state.<br>
The cap holders 4C, 5C are provided such that the surface (upper face) of the<br>
cap member 30 held by the cap holder 4C (5C) is substantially flush with the upper<br>
surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 (upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5).<br>
Next, a liquid immersion system 1 is explained referring to FIG. 3 through FIG.<br>
5. FIG. 3 is a partial cut-away of a summary oblique view showing the principal<br>
portions of a liquid immersion system, FIG. 4 is a side cross-sectional view parallel to the<br>
YZ plane in FIG. 3, and FIG. 5 is a side cross-sectional view parallel to the XZ plane in<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
The liquid immersion system 1 fills with liquid LQ the optical path space K<br>
between the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL through which<br>
exposure light EL passes, and the substrate P on either the first substrate stage 4 or on the<br>
second substrate stage 5, positioned at the position EP opposing the final optical element<br>
FL at the exposure station ST1. The liquid immersion system 1 includes a nozzle<br>
member 6, provided in proximity to the optical path space K, having a supply port 12<br>
which supplies liquid LQ to the optical path space K and a collection port 22 which<br>
recovers liquid LQ; a liquid supply device 11, which supplies liquid LQ via a supply tube<br>
13 and the supply port 12 of the nozzle member 6; and a liquid recovery device 21,<br>
which recovers liquid LQ via the collection port 22 of the nozzle member 6 and a<br>
recovery tube 23. The nozzle member 6 is a ring-shape member provided so as to<br><br>
surround at least one optical element (in this example, the final optical element FL)<br>
positioned on the image-plane side of the projection optical system PL. In the interior<br>
of the nozzle member 6 are formed a supply flow path 14 which connects the supply port<br>
12 and the supply tube 13, and a recovery flow path 24 which connects the collection<br>
port 22 and the recovery tube 23. Operation of the liquid supply device 11 and liquid<br>
recovery device 21 is controlled by the control device 7. The liquid supply device 11<br>
can deliver liquid LQ which is clean and has been temperature-adjusted; the liquid<br>
recovery device 21, including a vacuum system or similar, can recover liquid LQ.<br>
The nozzle member 6 has a base plate 18, having an upper surface 19 opposing<br>
the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL. A portion of the base plate 18 is<br>
positioned between the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL of the projection<br>
optical system PL and the substrate P (substrate stage) in the Z-axis direction.<br>
Furthermore, an aperture 18K through which exposure light EL passes is formed in the<br>
center portion of the base plate 18. The aperture 18K is formed to be larger than the<br>
projection area AR irradiated with exposure light EL. By this means, exposure light EL<br>
which has passed through the projection optical system PL (final optical element FL) can<br>
arrive at the substrate P without being blocked by the base plate 18. In this embodiment,<br>
the aperture 18K is formed in a substantially rectangular shape in plane view, according<br>
to the cross-sectional shape of the exposure light EL (that is, the projection area AR).<br>
The shape of the aperture 18K in the base plate 18 may be modified as appropriate, so<br>
long as exposure light EL can pass through.<br>
Among the surfaces of the nozzle member 6, the lower surface opposing the<br>
surface of the substrate P held by the substrate stage is a flat surface parallel to the XY<br>
plane. The lower surface of the nozzle member 6 includes the lower surface 17 of the<br>
base plate 18. Because the surface of the substrate P held by the substrate stage is<br><br>
substantially parallel to the XY plane, the lower surface 17 of the nozzle member 6 is<br>
provided so as to oppose the surface of the substrate P held by the substrate stage, and so<br>
as to be substantially parallel to the surface of the substrate P. In the following<br>
description, the lower surface 17 of the nozzle member 6 (base plate 18) may be called a<br>
land surface 17 as appropriate. The land surface 17 is a flat surface on the nozzle<br>
member 6, provided at the position closest to the substrate P held by the substrate stage,<br>
and provided so as to surround the optical path space K (projection area AR) of the<br>
exposure light EL between the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL of the<br>
projection optical system PL and the surface of the substrate P.<br>
The liquid LQ which fills the optical path space K is in contact with the land<br>
surface 17, and the liquid LQ filling the optical path space K is also in contact with the<br>
lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL. That is, the land surface 17 of the<br>
nozzle member 6 and the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL are liquid<br>
contact surfaces which are in contact with the liquid LQ filling the optical path space K.<br>
Furthermore, the base plate 18 is provided so as not to make contact with the<br>
lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL or the substrate P (substrate stage). A<br>
space having a prescribed gap is provided between the lower surface Tl of the final<br>
optical element FL and the upper surface 19 of the base plate 18. In the following<br>
description, the space on the inner side of the nozzle member 6 including the space<br>
between the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL and the upper surface 19 of<br>
the base plate 18 is called the inner space SP as appropriate.<br>
A supply flow path 14 connected to the supply port 12 is formed within the<br>
nozzle member 6. The supply flow path 14 is formed by a slit-shape penetrating hole<br>
which penetrates a portion of the nozzle member 6. In this embodiment, supply flow<br>
paths 14 are provided at both sides in the Y-axis direction relative to the optical path<br><br>
space K (projection area AR). The upper-end portions of the supply flow paths 14 and<br>
the liquid supply device 11 are connected via supply tubes 13. On the other hand, the<br>
lower-end portions of the supply flow paths 14 are connected to the inner space SP<br>
between the final optical element FL and the base plate 18, so that the lower-end portions<br>
of the supply flow paths 14 become supply ports 12. Hence the supply ports 12 and the<br>
liquid supply device 11 are connected via the supply tubes 13 and supply flow paths 14.<br>
In this embodiment, the supply ports 12 are at the outside of the optical path space K of<br>
the exposure light EL, and are provided in prescribed positions located lateral to both<br>
sides in the Y direction of the optical path space K. Pluralities of supply tubes 13 and<br>
supply flow paths 14 are provided according to the plurality (two) of supply ports 12.<br>
The nozzle member 6 includes a suction aperture 16, connected to the inner<br>
space SP, to suck fluid in the inner space SP. The suction aperture 16 can suck the<br>
liquid LQ and air in the inner space SP. In this embodiment, suction apertures 16 are at<br>
the outside of the optical path space K of the exposure light EL, and are provided at<br>
prescribed positions located lateral to both sides in the X-axis direction of the optical<br>
path space K. Within the nozzle member 6 is formed a suction flow path 15 connected<br>
to the suction aperture 16. The suction flow path 15 is formed by means of a slit-shape<br>
penetrating hole which penetrates a portion of the nozzle member 6. The lower-end<br>
portion of the suction flow path 15 is the suction aperture 16. Suction flow paths 15 are<br>
provided on both sides in the X-axis direction of the optical path space K (projection area<br>
AR). The upper-end portion of the suction flow paths 15 and a suction device 31<br>
including a vacuum system are connected by suction tubes 33. Pluralities of suction<br>
tubes 33 and suction flow paths 15 are provided corresponding to the plurality (two) of<br>
suction apertures 16. The suction apertures 16 are connected to the suction device 31<br>
via the suction flow paths 15 and the suction tubes 33. Fluid in the inner space SP can<br><br>
be discharged to the exterior via the suction apertures 16.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, valve mechanisms 33B are provided at prescribed positions<br>
of the suction tubes 33. Operation of the valve mechanisms 33B is controlled by the<br>
control device 7. The control device 7 can for example connect the suction device 31<br>
and the suction apertures 16 via control of the valve mechanisms 33B. The control<br>
device 7 can also connect the suction apertures 16 to the exterior space (the atmosphere)<br>
SG by controlling the valve mechanisms 33B. That is, by controlling the valve<br>
mechanisms 33B, the control device 7 can discharge (eject) fluid in the inner space SP to<br>
the exterior space (atmosphere) SG via the suction apertures 16, suction flow paths 15,<br>
and a portion of the suction tubes 33.<br>
Within a nozzle member 6 is formed a recovery flow path 24 connected to the<br>
collection port 22. A space, open in the downward direction, is formed in the nozzle<br>
member 6, and the recovery flow path 24 includes this space. The collection port 22<br>
has an aperture of the space with the downward-open aperture. A recovery flow path 24<br>
is provided lateral to the supply flow paths 14 and suction flow paths 15 related to the<br>
optical path space K.<br>
The collection port 22 is provided at a position opposing the surface of the<br>
substrate P above the substrate P held by the substrate stage. The surface of the<br>
substrate P held by the substrate stage and the collection port 22 provided in the nozzle<br>
member 6 are at a prescribed distance from each other. The collection port 22 is<br>
provided lateral to the supply ports 12 and suction apertures 16 relative to the optical<br>
path space K on the image-plane side of the projection optical system PL, formed into a<br>
ring shape surrounding the optical path space K (projection area AR), land surface 17,<br>
supply ports 12, and suction apertures 16. In this embodiment, the collection port 22 is<br>
formed into a circular ring shape in plane view. The recovery flow path 24 and liquid<br><br>
recovery device 21 are connected by a recovery tube 23. Hence the collection port 22<br>
and the liquid recovery device 21 are connected via the recovery tube 23 and the<br>
recovery flow path 24.<br>
The nozzle member 6 is positioned so as to cover the collection port 22, and<br>
includes a porous member 25 having numerous holes. The porous member 25 can for<br>
example be formed from titanium or stainless steel (for example SUS316) mesh, or from<br>
a ceramic porous member. The porous member 25 has a lower surface 26 which<br>
opposes the substrate P held by the substrate stage. The lower surface 26 of the porous<br>
member 25 opposing the substrate P is substantially flat. The porous member 25 is<br>
provided at the collection port 22 such that the lower surface 26 is substantially parallel<br>
to the surface of the substrate P (that is, the XY plane) held by the substrate stage.<br>
Liquid LQ is recovered via the porous member 25 positioned at the collection port 22.<br>
Because the collection port 22 is formed in a ring shape surrounding the optical path<br>
space K, the porous member 25 positioned at the collection port 22 is formed in a ring<br>
shape so as to surround the optical path space K, corresponding to the collection port 22.<br>
The porous member 25 is provided at the collection port 22 such that the lower surface<br>
26 is at substantially the same position (height) in the Z-axis direction as the land surface<br>
17, and also such that the lower surface 26 and the land surface 17 are substantially<br>
continuous. That is, the land surface 17 and the lower surface 26 of the porous member<br>
25 are substantially flush.<br>
In this embodiment, the liquid immersion system 1 is provided so as to recover<br>
only liquid LQ via the collection port 22 by optimizing the difference between the<br>
pressure in the recovery flow path 24 and the pressure of the exterior space (atmosphere)<br>
SG, according to the diameter of each of the holes in the porous member 25, the angle of<br>
connection of the porous member 25 and the liquid LQ, the surface tension of the liquid<br><br>
LQ, and similar. Specifically, the liquid immersion system 1 controls the suction force<br>
on the recovery flow path 24 by the liquid recovery device 21 to optimize the pressure in<br>
the recovery flow path 24, to recovery only liquid LQ.<br>
The numbers, positions, shapes and similar of the supply ports, collection ports,<br>
and suction apertures of the nozzle member 6 are not limited to those shown in FIG. 3<br>
through FIG. 5, but need only be sufficient to enable formation of a satisfactory liquid<br>
immersion region LR. For example, supply ports 12 may be provided lateral to both<br>
sides in the X-axis direction of the optical path space K, and suction apertures 16 may be<br>
provided lateral to both sides in the Y-axis direction.<br>
When filling the optical path space K of the exposure light EL with liquid LQ,<br>
either the first substrate stage 4 or the second substrate stage 5 is positioned at the<br>
position EP opposing the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL.<br>
As described above, the first and second substrate stages 4 and 5 can each be moved<br>
between the exposure station ST1 and the measurement station ST2. The first and<br>
second substrate stages 4 and 5 are provided so as to enable motion, while holding a<br>
substrate P, in a prescribed area on the base member BP, the area comprising the position<br>
EP opposed to the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL provided<br>
in the exposure station ST1, and when each of the stages 4, 5 is opposed to the final<br>
optical element FL, liquid LQ can be held between the substrate P and the final optical<br>
element FL (nozzle member 6).<br>
With either the first substrate stage 4 or the second substrate stage 5 positioned<br>
in the position EP opposing the final optical element FL of the projection optical system<br>
PL, the control device 7 drives both the liquid supply device 11 and the liquid recovery<br>
device 21. Liquid LQ delivered from the liquid supply device 11 flows through the<br>
supply tubes 13, then passes through the supply flow paths 14 of the nozzle member 6,<br><br>
and is supplied from the supply ports 12 to the inner space SP. Liquid LQ which has<br>
been supplied from supply ports 12 to the inner space SP fills the inner space SP, flows<br>
into the space between the land surface 17 and the substrate P (substrate stage) via the<br>
aperture 18K, and fills the optical path space K of the exposure light EL. In this way,<br>
by supplying liquid LQ from the supply ports 12 to the inner space SP between the final<br>
optical element FL and the base plate 18, the optical path space K of exposure light EL<br>
between the final optical element FL (projection optical system PL) and the substrate P<br>
(substrate stage) is filled with liquid LQ. When liquid LQ is supplied to the inner space<br>
SP from supply ports 12, the control device 7 controls the valve mechanisms 33B so as to<br>
connect the suction apertures 16 to the exterior space SG. That is, when supplying<br>
liquid LQ to the inner space SP from supply ports 12, the inner space SP is opened to the<br>
outside atmosphere. By supplying liquid LQ to the inner space SP in this state, the air<br>
portion which had existed in the inner space SP is discharged to the exterior space SG via<br>
the suction apertures 16 and/or the aperture 18K. Hence at the time of initiation of<br>
supply of liquid LQ to the inner space SP, problems such as the lingering of air in the<br>
inner space SP can be prevented, and such difficulties as the generation of air portions<br>
(air bubbles) in the liquid LQ in the optical path space K can be prevented.<br>
When liquid LQ is supplied to the inner space SP from supply ports 12, the<br>
control device 7 may control the valve mechanisms 33B such that the suction apertures<br>
16 and suction device 31 are connected. And, the suction device 31 may be driven, and<br>
while forcibly discharging air from the inner space SP via the suction apertures 16, liquid<br>
LQ may be supplied to the inner space SP via the supply ports 12.<br>
Liquid LQ existing between the nozzle member 6 (collection port 22) and<br>
substrate P is recovered via the collection port 22 by the liquid recovery device 21. The<br>
liquid recovery device 21 recovers a prescribed amount of liquid LQ per unit time. The<br><br>
liquid recovery device 21 including a vacuum system can recover liquid LQ existing<br>
between the collection port 22 (porous member 25) and substrate P, via the collection<br>
port 22, by inducing a negative pressure in the recovery flow path 24. Liquid LQ which<br>
fills the optical path space K of exposure light EL flows through the collection port 22 of<br>
the nozzle member 6 into the recovery flow path 24, and after passing through the<br>
recovery tube 23 is recovered by the liquid recovery device 21. The control device 7<br>
controls the liquid immersion system 1, and by causing to be performed in parallel the<br>
liquid supply operation of the liquid supply device 11 and the liquid recovery operation<br>
of the liquid recovery device 21, the optical path space K is filled with liquid LQ, and a<br>
liquid immersion region LR of the liquid LQ is formed locally in an area on a portion of<br>
the substrate P.<br>
Next, basic operation of the exposure apparatus EX is explained, referring to the<br>
flowchart of FIG. 6. In this embodiment, with the optical path space K of the exposure<br>
light EL filled with liquid LQ, the control device 7 controls movement of one substrate<br>
stage 4 (or 5) existing at the exposure station ST1 among the first substrate stage 4 and<br>
the second substrate stage 5, and performs exposure of the substrate P held by that stage<br>
4 (or 5) via the projection optical system PL and liquid LQ. On the other hand, at the<br>
measurement station ST2, prescribed measurements are performed, without the<br>
mediation of liquid LQ, on the substrate P held by the other stage 5 (or 4).<br>
At the measurement station ST2, the control device 7 initiates exchange and<br>
measurement processing of the substrate P. For example, the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
positioned at the substrate exchange position RP of the measurement station ST2, and the<br>
transport system 9 is used to load the substrate P to be subjected to exposure processing<br>
onto the second substrate stage 5. The control device 7 initiates measurement<br>
processing for the second substrate stage 5 holding the substrate P at the measurement<br><br>
station ST2. On the other hand, the first substrate stage 4, holding a substrate P for<br>
which measurement processing at the measurement station ST2 has been completed, is<br>
positioned at the exposure station ST1.<br>
In this embodiment, measurements of a substrate P at the measurement station<br>
ST2 include detection of surface position information of the surface of the substrate P by<br>
the focus/leveling detection system 8. At the measurement station ST2, the liquid LQ is<br>
not supplied above the substrate P. The focus/leveling detection system 8 detects<br>
surface position information for the surface of the substrate P held by the second<br>
substrate stage 5 without the mediation of liquid LQ (step SA1). In this embodiment,<br>
the control device 7 controls movement of the second substrate stage 5, and while<br>
moving the second substrate stage 5 holding the substrate P in the XY plane, uses the<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8 to detect, without the mediation of liquid LQ, the<br>
position in the Z-axis direction of a plurality of detection points on the surface of the<br>
substrate P. For example, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 while<br>
monitoring the output of the laser interferometer 2P, and, without the mediation of liquid<br>
LQ, uses the focus/leveling detection system 8 to detect position information in the<br>
Z-axis direction for a plurality of points in the plane (in the XY plane) of the surface of<br>
the substrate P. Specifically, while moving the second substrate stage 5 in XY<br>
directions such that detection light La emitted from the projection system 8A of the<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8 is incident on a plurality of positions on the surface of<br>
the substrate P, the position (attitude) of the second substrate stage 5 in the Z-axis, 9X,<br>
and 6Y directions is adjusted, and position information in the Z-axis direction for a<br>
plurality of points on the surface of the substrate P is detected relative to a prescribed<br>
reference position (reference surface). The detection results of the focus/leveling<br>
detection system 8 are stored in the control device 7, in association with the position in<br><br>
the XY plane of the substrate P (second substrate stage 5).<br>
Next, the control device 7 creates map data based on position information for the<br>
plurality of detection points on the surface of the substrate P, detected in step SA1, and<br>
determines an approximate plane (approximate surface) for the surface of the substrate P<br>
based on the map data (step SA2). By this means, an approximate plane for the surface<br>
of the substrate P is determined with reference to a prescribed reference position<br>
(reference surface). The control device 7 stores the approximate plane for the surface of<br>
the substrate P thus determined at the measurement station ST2.<br>
When processing ends at the exposure station ST1 and at the measurement<br>
station ST2, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 to the measurement<br>
station ST2 and moves the second substrate stage 5 to the exposure station STL After<br>
the first substrate stage 4, holding the substrate P for which exposure processing has been<br>
completed, has been moved to the measurement station ST2, the transport system 9<br>
unloads the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4. A substrate P to be subjected to<br>
exposure processing is loaded onto the first substrate stage 4 at the measurement station<br>
ST2, and the above-described measurement processing is performed.<br>
On the other hand, after the second substrate stage 5, holding a substrate P<br>
subjected to measurement processing at the measurement station ST2, has been moved to<br>
the exposure station ST1, the focus/leveling detection system 8 provided at the exposure<br>
station ST1 detects, without the mediation of liquid LQ, position information in the<br>
Z-axis direction of one detection point on the surface of the substrate P on the second<br>
substrate stage 5, or of a number of detection points smaller than the number of detection<br>
points detected at the measurement station ST2 (step SA3). An approximate plane of<br>
the surface of the substrate P was determined in step SA2. Hence at the exposure<br>
station ST1, by detecting position information in the Z-axis direction for one detection<br><br>
point (or a plurality of detection points) on the surface of the substrate P and position<br>
information in the XY plane, an approximate plane for the surface of the substrate P can<br>
be derived, based on the detection results, with reference to a prescribed reference<br>
position (reference surface) at the exposure station ST1.<br>
The control device 7 stores in advance position information for the image plane,<br>
with the mediation of liquid LQ, of the projection optical system PL relative to a<br>
prescribed reference position (reference surface). Hence the control device 7 can<br>
determine the positional relation between the image plane formed by the projection<br>
optical system PL via liquid LQ and the surface (approximate surface) of the substrate P,<br>
with reference to a prescribed reference position (reference surface) (step SA4).<br>
When the above-described measurement processing ends, the control device 7<br>
controls movement of the second substrate stage 5, and positions the substrate P in the<br>
position opposing the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL.<br>
Based on the surface position information of the surface of the substrate derived based on<br>
detection results of the focus/leveling detection system 8 at the measurement station ST2,<br>
and while adjusting the position of the surface of the substrate P relative to the image<br>
plane via liquid LQ of the projection optical system PL at the exposure station ST1, the<br>
control device 7 exposes the substrate P via the projection optical system PL and liquid<br>
LQ, while moving the substrate P in the Y-axis direction with respect to the optical path<br>
space K (step SA5).<br>
After liquid immersion exposure processing of the substrate P on the second<br>
substrate stage 5 has ended, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 at<br>
the exposure station ST1 to the measurement station ST2. In parallel with this, the first<br>
substrate stage 4 holding a substrate P for which measurement processing has ended at<br>
the exposure station ST1 is moved to the exposure station ST1. The transport system 9<br><br>
unloads the substrate P for which exposure processing has ended, held by the second<br>
substrate stage 5, which has been moved to the measurement station ST2.<br>
Next, an example of a substrate stage driving device PD is explained, referring<br>
to FIG. 7. FIG. 7 is a view from above of first and second substrate stages 4, 5 and a<br>
substrate stage driving device PD. In FIG. 7, the substrate stage driving device PD<br>
includes linear motors 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85. The substrate stage driving device PD<br>
includes a pair of Y-axis linear guides 91, 93 extending in the Y-axis direction. The<br>
Y-axis linear guides 91, 93 are positioned separated a prescribed interval in the X-axis<br>
direction. The Y-axis linear guides 91, 93 each includes, for example, magnet units,<br>
incorporating permanent magnet groups having a plurality of sets of N-pole magnets and<br>
S-pole magnets, arranged at prescribed intervals along the Y-axis direction and in<br>
alternation. On one of the Y-axis linear guides 91, two sliders 90, 94 are supported to<br>
enable motion in the Y-axis direction in a contact-free state. Similarly, two sliders 92,<br>
95 are supported on the other Y-axis linear guide 93 to enable motion in the Y-axis<br>
direction in a contact-free state. Each of the sliders 90, 92, 94, 95 has for example a coil<br>
unit, incorporating armature coils arranged at prescribed intervals along the Y axis.<br>
That is, in this embodiment, by means of the sliders 90, 94, having coil units, and the<br>
Y-axis linear guide 91 having a magnet unit, moving-coil type Y-axis linear motors 82, 84<br>
are configured. Similarly, by means of the sliders 92, 95, having coil units, and the<br>
Y-axis linear guide 93 having a magnet unit, moving-coil type Y-axis linear motors 83, 85<br>
are configured.<br>
The sliders 90, 92 comprised by the Y-axis linear motors 82, 83 are respectively<br>
fixed to one end portion and the other end portion in the length direction of an X-axis<br>
linear guide 87 extending in the X-axis direction. Furthermore, the sliders 94, 95<br>
comprised by the Y-axis linear motors 84, 85 are respectively fixed to one end portion<br><br>
and the other end portion in the length direction of an X-axis linear guide 89 extending in<br>
the X-axis direction. Hence the X-axis linear guide 87 is movable in the Y-axis<br>
direction by means of the Y-axis linear motors 82, 83, and the X-axis linear guide 89 is<br>
movable in the Y-axis direction by means of the Y-axis linear motors 84, 85.<br>
Each of the X-axis linear guides 87, 89 includes for example a coil unit<br>
incorporating armature coils arranged at prescribed intervals along the X axis. On one<br>
of the X-axis linear guides 87 is supported the slider 86 to enable motion in the X-axis<br>
direction in a contact-free state. Similarly, on the other X-axis linear guide 89 is<br>
supported the slider 88 to enable motion in the X-axis direction in a contact-free state.<br>
The sliders 86, 88 includes for example magnet units having permanent magnet groups<br>
having a plurality of sets of N-pole magnets and S-pole magnets, arranged at prescribed<br>
intervals along the X-axis direction and in alternation.<br>
In FIG. 7, each of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 is connected to the<br>
sliders 86, 88 via releasable joints 41, 42, such as those disclosed for example in<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-223159. The<br>
joints 41, 42 can be coupled to side faces of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5<br>
respectively. That is, the joint 41 connected to the slider 86 can be coupled to the -Y<br>
side face of the first substrate stage 4 and to the -Y side face of the second substrate stage<br>
5. The joint 42 connected to the slider 88 can be coupled to the +Y side face of the<br>
second substrate stage 5 and to the +Y side face of the first substrate stage 4. By means<br>
of the slider 86 and the X-axis linear guide 87, a moving magnet type X-axis linear motor<br>
80 is configured which drives the first substrate stage 4 (second substrate stage 5)<br>
connected via the joint 41 to the slider 86 in the X-axis direction. And by means of the<br>
slider 88 and the X-axis linear guide 89, a moving magnet type X-axis linear motor 81 is<br>
configured which drives the second substrate stage 5 (first substrate stage 4) connected<br><br>
via the joint 42 to the slider 88 in the X-axis direction.<br>
By making the thrusts generated by the pair of Y-axis linear motors 82, 83 (or 84,<br>
85) slightly different, the substrate stage can be controlled in the 9Z direction. In the<br>
figure, the substrate stages are shown as single substrate stages. In actuality, each<br>
substrate stage includes an XY stage, driven by a Y-axis linear motor, and a Z-tilt stage,<br>
mounted via a Z-leveling driving mechanism (for example, a voice coil motor or similar)<br>
on the XY stage, and finely driven in the Z-axis direction and in the 8X and 9Y directions<br>
relative to the XY stage. The substrate holder holding the substrate P is supported by<br>
the Z-tilt stage.<br>
On the base member BP is provided an auxiliary 50 which prevents collision<br>
between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5. The auxiliary 50 is<br>
provided to prevent collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate<br>
stage 5, which move in XY directions on the base member BP, and is provided between a<br>
first work area 10 comprising the exposure station ST1, and a second work area 20<br>
comprising a measurement station ST2.<br>
The auxiliary 50 has a prescribed size. A first passageway 61 is formed<br>
between the auxiliary 50 and the -X side wall 43 comprising the Y linear guide 93. A<br>
second passageway 62 is formed between the auxiliary 50 and the +X side wall 44<br>
comprising the Y linear guide 91. And, the auxiliary 50 has regulating members 51,52<br>
which perform regulation such that the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate<br>
stage 5 move only on mutually different paths. The first substrate stage 4 moves only<br>
on the first passageway 61 among the first passageway 61 and the second passageway 62,<br>
and the second substrate stage 5 moves only on the second passageway 62, by means of<br>
the auxiliary 50 comprising the regulating members 51, 52.<br>
Next, a method of exposure of a substrate P using an exposure apparatus EX<br><br>
having the above-described configuration is explained, referring to the plane views of<br>
FIG. 7 through FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 through FIG. 24.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 15, in the first work area 10 of the exposure station<br>
ST1, liquid immersion exposure of the substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4 is<br>
performed. At the measurement station ST2, measurement processing of the substrate P<br>
held by the second substrate stage 5 is performed. In order to perform liquid immersion<br>
exposure of the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4, the control device 7 positions<br>
the first substrate stage 4 at the position opposing the final optical element FL of the<br>
projection optical system PL (the position directly below the final optical element FL) EP.<br>
Then, the control device 7 uses the liquid immersion system 1 to fill the optical path<br>
space K between the final optical element FL and the substrate P held by the first<br>
substrate stage 4 with liquid LQ, and exposes the substrate P. Furthermore, the cap<br>
member 30 is held by the cap holder 4C on the first substrate stage 4. And as described<br>
above, when the first substrate stage 4 is positioned at the position EP opposing the final<br>
optical element FL, the second substrate stage 5 is subjected to measurement processing,<br>
substrate exchange, and other prescribed processing in the second work area 20 of the<br>
measurement station ST2 comprising the substrate exchange position RP.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 16, after the end of liquid immersion exposure of<br>
the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4, the control device 7 moves the first substrate<br>
stage 4 in XY directions, while liquid LQ is held between the final optical element FL of<br>
the projection optical system PL and the substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4,<br>
and moves the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ from on the substrate P to on the<br>
cap member 30 held by the cap holder 4C above the first substrate stage 4. The upper<br>
surface of the cap member 30 held by the cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4 is<br>
substantially flush with the upper surface 4F of the substrate P held by the substrate<br><br>
holder 4H of the first substrate stage 4 and with the upper surface 4F of the first substrate<br>
stage 4. While performing in parallel the supply of liquid LQ from the supply ports 12<br>
and the recovery of liquid LQ via the collection port 22, the first substrate stage 4 is<br>
moved in XY directions within a prescribed area comprising the position EP opposing the<br>
final optical element FL, and by this means the liquid immersion region LR formed on<br>
the substrate P can be smoothly moved on the cap member 30.<br>
After moving the liquid immersion region LR on the cap member 30, the control<br>
device 7 adjusts the positional relation between the nozzle member 6 and the cap member<br>
30 in the Z-axis direction, as shown in FIG. 17, and causes the lower surface of the<br>
nozzle member 6(17, 26) to make contact with the upper surface of the cap member 30.<br>
Specifically, the first substrate stage 4, holding the cap member 30, is raised in the +Z<br>
direction, and the lower surface of the cap member 6 is brought into contact with the<br>
upper surface of the cap member 30. Furthermore, position information in XY<br>
directions for the first substrate stage 4 is measured by the laser interferometer 2P.<br>
Based on measurement results of the laser interferometer 2P, the cap member 30 on the<br>
first substrate stage 4 can be positioned with respect to the nozzle member 6. Of the<br>
portions of the nozzle member 6, the collection port 22 is provided in the lower surface<br>
opposing the upper surface of the cap member 30. By a recovery operation (suction<br>
operation) via the collection port 22, the cap member 30 can be vacuum-clamped to the<br>
lower surface of the nozzle member 6. The control device 7 uses the collection port 22<br>
to hold the cap member 30 against the lower surface of the nozzle member 6, such that<br>
the nozzle member 6 and cap member 30 are in a prescribed positional relation.<br>
In this embodiment, the lower surface 26 of the porous member 25 positioned at<br>
the collection port 22 is substantially flat, and is substantially flush with the land surface<br>
17 of the nozzle member 6. By vacuum-clamping the cap member 30 using the<br><br>
collection port 22 of the nozzle member 6, the aperture 18K can be closed. By holding<br>
the cap member 30 against the lower surface of the nozzle member 6 so as to close the<br>
aperture 18K, liquid LQ can be held between the lower surface Tl of the final optical<br>
element FL and the nozzle member 6. Furthermore, a prescribed space SK comprising<br>
the inner space SP, and capable of holding liquid LQ, is formed between the final optical<br>
element FL and the cap member 30 held by the nozzle member 6.<br>
After holding the cap member 30 against the lower surface of the nozzle<br>
member 6, the control device 7 releases the holding of the cap member 30 by the cap<br>
holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4. As shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 18, the control<br>
device causes the first substrate stage 4 to be retracted from the position EP opposing (the<br>
position directly below) the final optical element FL. In this way, when the first<br>
substrate stage 4 withdraws from the final optical element FL, the cap member 30 held<br>
against the lower surface of the nozzle member 6 is removed from the first substrate<br>
stage 4, and liquid LQ can be held up to the final optical element FL.<br>
FIG. 19 shows the state in which the cap member 30 is held using the collection<br>
port 22 of the nozzle member 6. As described above, supply ports 12 are provided<br>
lateral to the optical path space K in the Y-axis direction, and suction apertures 16 are<br>
provided lateral to the optical path space K in the X-axis direction. In FIG. 19, in order<br>
to facilitate viewing of the drawing as well as to simplify the explanation, a supply port<br>
12 lateral to the -Y side of the optical path space K and a supply tube 13 connected to the<br>
supply port 12 are shown, and a suction aperture 16 lateral to the +Y side of the optical<br>
path space K and a suction tube 33 connected to the suction aperture 16 are shown.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, with the cap member 30 held against the lower surface of<br>
the nozzle member 6, the supply of liquid LQ from the supply ports 12 to the prescribed<br>
space SK including the inner space SP, between the final optical element FL and the cap<br><br>
member 30, and the recovery of liquid LQ via the suction apertures 16, are performed in<br>
parallel. As described above, by controlling the valve mechanisms 33B, the control<br>
device 7 can connect the suction apertures 16 and the suction device 31 having a vacuum<br>
system via the suction flow paths 15 and suction tubes 33. Hence by driving the suction<br>
device 31, the control device 7 can perform suction recovery of fluids (liquid LQ, air) in<br>
the prescribed space SK, including the inner space SP, between the final optical element<br>
FL and the cap member 30. The control device 7 drives the liquid recovery device 21<br>
having a vacuum system to induce a negative pressure in the recovery flow path 24,<br>
maintains the clamping of the cap member 30 by the collection port 22, and with the<br>
aperture 18K closed, drives the liquid supply device 11 and the suction device 31. By<br>
this means, pure liquid LQ is supplied from the supply ports 12 to the prescribed space<br>
SK between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30, and in addition liquid<br>
LQ in the prescribed space SK can be recovered from the suction apertures 16. By this<br>
means, the image-plane side of the projection optical system PL can be continuously<br>
filled with liquid LQ, without halting the liquid supply operation of the liquid supply<br>
device 11.<br>
The supply ports 12 to supply liquid LQ to the prescribed space SK and suction<br>
apertures 16 to recovery liquid LQ are provided at positions closer to the final optical<br>
element FL than the collection port 22 used for clamping of the cap member 30. Hence<br>
by holding the cap member 30 using the collection port 22 provided in the lower surface<br>
of the nozzle member 6, the prescribed space SK can be formed between the final optical<br>
element FL and the cap member 30, connected to the supply ports 12 and suction<br>
apertures 16.<br>
Next, while measuring the XY direction positions of the first and second<br>
substrate stages 4, 5 using the laser interferometers 2P, the control device 7 controls the<br><br>
substrate stage driving device PD to move the first substrate stage 4 to the measurement<br>
station ST2 (second work area 20), and to move the second substrate stage 5 to the<br>
exposure station ST1 (first work area 10). As shown in FIG. 10, the control device 7<br>
controls the substrate stage driving device PD so as to move the first substrate stage 4<br>
along the first passageway 61 and to move the second substrate stage 5 along the second<br>
passageway 62.<br>
FIG. 20 is a schematic drawing showing the relation between the first and<br>
second substrate stages 4, 5 passing through the first and second passageways 61, 62.<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, the auxiliary 50 has first and second regulating members 51, 52<br>
which perform regulation such that the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate<br>
stage 5 move through different paths. In this embodiment, the first regulating member<br>
51 is provided on the -X side face of the auxiliary 50, and has a protruding member<br>
which protrudes on the -X side. The protruding member comprised by the first<br>
regulating member 51 is formed so as to extend in the Y-axis direction on the -X side<br>
face of the auxiliary 50. The second regulating member 52 is provided on the +X side<br>
face of the auxiliary 50, and has a protruding member which protrudes on the +X side.<br>
The protruding member comprised by the second regulating member 52 is formed so as<br>
to extend in the Y-axis direction on the +X side of the auxiliary 50.<br>
The first regulating member 51 and the second regulating member 52 are<br>
provided at different positions (heights) in the Z-axis direction. A first groove 51M is<br>
formed in the +X side face of the first substrate stage 4, according to the first regulating<br>
member 51. A second groove 52M is formed in the -X side face of the second substrate<br>
stage 5, according to the second regulating member 52. When the first substrate stage 4<br>
passes through the first passageway 61, the first regulating member 51 has the first<br>
groove 51M positioned on the inside, and movement of the first substrate stage 4 in the<br><br>
first passageway 61 is not impeded by the first regulating member 51. In other words,<br>
when the first substrate stage 4 passes through the first passageway 61, the first substrate<br>
stage 4 does not strike the first regulating member 51. Or, when passing through the<br>
passageway 61, the movement of the first substrate stage 4 is guided by the first<br>
regulating member 51. And, when the second substrate stage 5 passes through the<br>
second passageway 62, the second regulating member 52 has the second groove 52M<br>
positioned on the inside, and movement of the second substrate stage 5 in the second<br>
passageway 62 is not impeded by the second regulating member 52. In other words,<br>
when the second substrate stage 5 passes through the second passageway 62, the second<br>
substrate stage 5 does not strike the second regulating member 52. Or, when passing<br>
through the second passageway 62, the movement of the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
guided by the second regulating member 52.<br>
On the other hand, when the first substrate stage 4 moves from one among the<br>
exposure station ST1 and the measurement station ST2 to the other, even if the first<br>
substrate stage 4 attempts to pass through the second passageway 62, the first substrate<br>
stage 4 strikes the second regulating member 52 in the second passageway 62. That is,<br>
the second regulating member 52 impedes movement of the first substrate stage 4 along<br>
the second passageway 62. Hence even if for example the second substrate stage 5<br>
exists in proximity to the second passageway 62 at the measurement station ST2,<br>
collision of the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 is prevented.<br>
Similarly, even if the second substrate stage 5 attempts to pass through the first<br>
passageway 61, movement of the second substrate stage 5 in the first passageway 61 is<br>
impeded by the first regulating member 51.<br>
The auxiliary 50 is for example formed from a material softer than that of the<br>
first and second substrate stages 4, 5. Significant damage is not imparted to the first or<br><br>
second substrate stages 4, 5 even when the first or second substrate stages 4, 5 strike the<br>
auxiliary 50. Or, a cushioning mechanism may be provided on the auxiliary 50, to<br>
absorb shocks when an object (a substrate stage) strikes. By this means, significant<br>
damage to the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 can be prevented even when the first<br>
or second substrate stage 4, 5 strikes the auxiliary 50. By providing such an auxiliary<br>
50, direct collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5<br>
can be prevented, and increased damage can be suppressed.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 11, coupling of the joint 41 and the first substrate stage 4<br>
and the coupling of the joint 42 and the second substrate stage 4 are released. The first<br>
substrate stage 4 is coupled to the slider 88 of a portion of the linear motor 81 via the<br>
joint 42, and the second substrate stage 5 is coupled to the slider 86 of a portion of the<br>
linear motor 80 via the joint 41. The control device 7 controls the substrate stage<br>
driving device PD as shown in FIG. 12 to move the second substrate stage 5 to the<br>
exposure station ST1 and to move the first substrate stage 4 to the measurement station<br>
ST2.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13 and FIG. 21, the control device 7 moves the second<br>
substrate stage 5 existing at the exposure station ST1 to the position EP opposing<br>
(directly below) the final optical element FL, and causes the lower surface of the cap<br>
member 30 held by the nozzle member 6 and the cap holder 5C on the second substrate<br>
stage 5 to be opposed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 22, the control device adjusts the positional relation in the<br>
Z-axis direction between the cap member 30 held by the nozzle member 6 and the cap<br>
holder 5C on the second substrate stage 5, and places the cap member 30 held by the<br>
nozzle member 6 on the cap holder 5C on the second substrate stage 5. Specifically, the<br>
second substrate stage 5 rises in the +Z direction, and the lower surface of the cap<br><br>
member 30 held by the nozzle member 6 makes contact with the cap holder 5C. At this<br>
time, position information in the XY directions for the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
measured by a laser interferometer 2P. Based on measurement results of the laser<br>
interferometer 2P, the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5 can be positioned<br>
relative to the cap member 30 held by the nozzle member 6.<br>
After the cap member 30 held by the nozzle member 6 makes contact with the<br>
cap holder 5C, the control device 7 holds the cap member 30 using the cap holder 5C.<br>
The control device 7 releases the clamping of the cap member 30 by the collection port<br>
22. As shown in FIG. 23, the second substrate stage 5 descends in the -Z direction, and<br>
the lower surface of the nozzle member withdraws from the cap member 30 held by the<br>
cap holder 5C. Here, the operation to supply liquid from supply ports 12 is continued.<br>
By retracting the cap member 30 from the lower surface of the nozzle member 6, liquid<br>
LQ supplied to the inner space SP from the supply ports 12 flows into the space between<br>
the nozzle member 6 and the cap member 30 via the aperture 18K. With the supply of<br>
liquid LQ from supply ports 12 continued, liquid LQ flowing into the space between the<br>
nozzle member 6 and the cap member 30 via the aperture 18K is recovered through the<br>
collection port 22. By this means, a liquid immersion region LR for liquid LQ is<br>
formed above the cap member 30 mounted on the second substrate stage 5.<br>
Furthermore, the control device 7 controls the valve mechanisms 33B with prescribed<br>
timing to close the flow paths connecting the suction apertures 16 and the suction device<br>
31, and opens the flow paths connecting the suction apertures 16 and the exterior space<br>
(atmosphere) SG. That is, the inner space SP is opened to the outer atmosphere via the<br>
suction apertures 16.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14 and FIG. 24, while holding liquid LQ between the final<br>
optical element FL of the projection optical system PL and the cap member 30 held by<br><br>
the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5, the control device moves the second<br>
substrate stage 5 in XY directions, and moves the liquid immersion region LR of liquid<br>
LQ formed on the cap member 30 onto the substrate P held by the substrate holder 5H of<br>
the second substrate stage 5. The upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the cap<br>
holder 5H of the second substrate stage 5, the upper surface of the substrate P held by the<br>
substrate holder 5H of the second substrate stage 5, and the upper surface 5F of the<br>
second substrate stage 5 are substantially flush. While performing in parallel both<br>
supply of liquid LQ from supply ports 12 and recovery of liquid LQ via the collection<br>
port 22, by moving the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions in the area comprising<br>
the position opposed to the final optical element FL, the liquid immersion region LR<br>
formed on the substrate P can be smoothly moved onto the substrate P. The control<br>
device 7 fills the space between the final optical element FL and the substrate P held by<br>
the second substrate stage 5 with liquid LQ, and performs exposure of the substrate P.<br>
After the end of exposure of the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5,<br>
when as described above the second substrate stage 5 is retracted from the final optical<br>
element FL, the cap member 30 is removed from the second substrate stage 5, the cap<br>
member 30 is clamped to the lower face of the nozzle member 6 using the collection port<br>
22, and liquid LQ is held in the prescribed space SK between the final optical element FL<br>
and the cap member 30.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, a cap member 30 is provided which<br>
can be attached to and detached from both the first substrate stage 4 and the second<br>
substrate stage 5. Consequently even when the first substrate stage 4 and the second<br>
substrate stage 5 each withdraws from the prescribed area (in the area in which the liquid<br>
LQ can be held against the final optical element FL) comprising the position EP opposed<br>
to the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL, by holding the cap member 30<br><br>
using the collection port 22 of the nozzle member 6, liquid LQ can continue to be held<br>
between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30. Hence the prescribed<br>
space SK comprising the optical path space K and inner space SP can continue to be<br>
filled with liquid LQ, without halting the operation of supplying liquid LQ to fill the<br>
optical path space K of the exposure light EL with liquid LQ. If there is no cap member<br>
30, when the first substrate stage 4 or the second substrate stage 5 withdraws from the<br>
final optical element FL, liquid LQ cannot be held. In this case, the supply of liquid LQ<br>
must first be halted, and all liquid LQ must be recovered. A certain amount of time is<br>
required for an operation to recovery all liquid LQ. Furthermore, when resuming<br>
supply of liquid LQ, a wait time must be set until the state of the liquid LQ, for example<br>
the temperature, as well as the quantity or size of air bubbles in the liquid LQ, has<br>
reached a desired state. In this case, a decline in the availability factor of the exposure<br>
apparatus EX may result. In this embodiment, the prescribed space SK comprising the<br>
optical path space K can continue to be filled with liquid LQ, and so declines in the<br>
availability factor of the exposure apparatus EX can be suppressed.<br>
Furthermore, by continuing to fill with liquid LQ the space between the final<br>
optical element FL and the cap member 30, the final optical element FL can always be<br>
kept wet. Hence problems such as the formation of tracks (so-called watermarks) on the<br>
final optical element FL due to the evaporation of liquid LQ adhering to the final optical<br>
element FL can be prevented. Hence degradation of the performance of the exposure<br>
apparatus EX can be prevented.<br>
Furthermore, in the liquid immersion system 1, the supply and recovery of liquid<br>
LQ to and from the prescribed space SK between the final optical element FL and cap<br>
member 30 are performed in parallel with the cap member 30 held by the nozzle member<br>
6, so that the prescribed space SK is filled with pure liquid LQ. Hence contamination of<br><br>
the final optical element FL can be prevented, and the final optical element FL can be<br>
cleaned. In particular, there is the possibility of intermixing of matter arising from the<br>
substrate P (material comprised by the photosensitive material, for example) with the<br>
liquid LQ which forms the liquid immersion region LR on the substrate P. Hence there<br>
is the possibility of adhesion of the above-described matter on the lower surface (liquid<br>
contact surface) Tl of the final optical element FL which holds the liquid LQ with the<br>
substrate P. In this embodiment, the final optical element FL can be cleaned between<br>
exposure of the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 and exposure of the substrate P<br>
on the second substrate stage 5.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment an auxiliary 50 is comprised which prevents<br>
collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5, so that<br>
collision of the first substrate stage 4 with the second substrate stage 5 can be prevented.<br>
Hence damage to the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 arising from<br>
collisions can be prevented.<br><second embodiment></second>
Next, a second embodiment is explained, referring to FIG. 25 A and FIG. 25B.<br>
In the above-described first embodiment, a cap member 30 is clamped by a collection<br>
port 22 provided in the lower surface of a nozzle member 6 to form a prescribed space<br>
SK with the final optical element FL. A characteristic of the present embodiment is the<br>
fact that the cap member is held by a holding mechanism 70 separate from the nozzle<br>
member 6. In the following description, components the same as or similar to those of<br>
the abovementioned embodiment are denoted the same reference symbols, and<br>
description thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In FIG. 25A and FIG. 25B, the exposure apparatus EX includes a cap holding<br>
mechanism 70 which holds the cap member 30 so as to form the prescribed space SK<br><br>
with the final optical element FL. The cap holding mechanism 70 has a movable<br>
member 71 which moves relative to the nozzle member 6, and a clamping hole 72,<br>
provides in the lower surface opposing the upper surface of the cap member 30, to clamp<br>
and hold the cap member 30. The movable member 71 is provided lateral to the<br>
collection port 22 relative to the optical path space K. In this embodiment, a plurality oi<br>
(for example, three) movable members 71 are provided on the lateral to the outside of the<br>
nozzle member 6. Support members 73 corresponding to the movable members 71 are<br>
provided on the upper surface of the nozzle member 6. Between the support members<br>
73	and movable members 71 are provided driving mechanisms 74, which drive the<br>
movable members 71 in the Z-axis direction toward the support members 73. The<br>
control device 7, by driving the driving mechanisms 74, can move the movable members<br>
71, which is located lateral to the nozzle member 6, in the vertical direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 25A, when exposing the substrate P, the driving mechanisms<br>
74	raise the movable members 71 such that the lower surfaces of the movable members<br>
71 are positioned above the lower surface of the nozzle member 6, that is, such that the<br>
movable members 71 do not contact with the substrate P.<br>
When holding the cap member 30 using the cap holding mechanism 70, the<br>
driving mechanisms 74 lower the lower surfaces of the movable members 71 below the<br>
lower surface of the nozzle member 6, as shown in FIG. 25B. The clamping holes 72<br>
provided in the lower surfaces of the movable members 71 clamp and hold the upper<br>
surface of the cap member 30. The cap member 30 is held by the cap holding<br>
mechanism 70 such that the distance between the lower surface of the nozzle member 6<br>
and the upper surface of the cap member 30 is for example substantially equal to the<br>
distance between the lower surface of the nozzle member 6 and the surface of the<br>
substrate P during exposure of the substrate P.<br><br>
When the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 have withdrawn<br>
from the final optical element FL, the cap holding mechanism 70 holds the cap member<br>
30. When the cap member 30 is being held by the cap holding mechanism 70, similarly<br>
to when the substrate P is undergoing liquid immersion exposure, the liquid immersion<br>
system 1 performs in parallel the supply of liquid LQ from supply ports 12 and the<br>
recovery of liquid LQ via the collection port 22 to and from the prescribed space SK<br>
between the final optical element FL and cap member 30. By this means, the prescribed<br>
space SK between the final optical element FL and cap member 30 can be continuously<br>
filled with liquid LQ.<br>
The supply ports 12 which supply liquid LQ and collection port 22 which<br>
recovers liquid LQ to and from the prescribed space SK between the final optical element<br>
FL and cap member 30 are provided at positions closer to the final optical element FL<br>
than the clamping holes 72 provided in the movable members 71 for clamping and<br>
holding of the cap member 30. By holding the cap member 30 using the clamping holes<br>
72 provided in the lower surfaces of the movable members 71, the prescribed space SK,<br>
connected to the supply ports 12 and collection port 22, can be formed between the final<br>
optical element FL and the cap member 30.<br>
In the second embodiment, the movable members 71 are connected to the nozzle<br>
member 6 via the driving mechanisms 74 and support members 73, but may be<br>
connected for example to the lens barrel PK of the projection optical system PL and/or<br>
the body (column) of the exposure apparatus EX supporting the lens barrel PL.<br><third embodiment></third>
Next, a third embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 26. A characteristic of<br>
this embodiment is the fact that a measurement device 100 is provided at the cap member<br>
30 to perform prescribed measurements. In the following description, components the<br><br>
same as or similar to those of the abovementioned embodiments are denoted the same<br>
reference symbols, and description thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In FIG. 26, a measurement device 100 is provided at the cap member 30 to<br>
perform prescribed measurements. In this embodiment, the measurement device 100 is<br>
a device which measures information relating to the exposure light EL. In this<br>
embodiment, similarly to the above-described first embodiment, the cap member 30 is<br>
clamped and held by the collection port 22 in the lower surface of the nozzle member 6.<br>
The space between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30 is filled with<br>
liquid LQ.<br>
As the measurement device 100, for example, an illuminance unevenness sensor<br>
such as that disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
S57-117238, a aerial image measurement sensor such as that disclosed in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2002-14005, an irradiation<br>
quantity sensor (illuminance sensor) such as that disclosed in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application, First Publication No. Hll-16816, or various other types of<br>
measurement equipment may be used. A light-receiving surface of the measurement<br>
device 100 is provided on the upper surface of the cap member 30, and a light-receiving<br>
element is provided within the cap member 30. The light-receiving element of the<br>
measurement device 100 receives, via the light-receiving surface, exposure light EL<br>
which has been emitted downward from the lower surface of the final optical element FL<br>
and has passed through the liquid LQ.<br>
In this embodiment, a transmission device 101 is provided in the cap member 30<br>
for wireless transmission of measurement results from the measurement device 100.<br>
The transmission device 101 is connected to the measurement device 100.<br>
The exposure apparatus EX includes a reception device 102 which receives<br><br>
wireless signals, including measurement results, transmitted from the transmission device<br>
101. Measurement results received by the reception device 102 are output to the control<br>
device 7. The measurement results of the measurement device 100 may also be<br>
displayed on a display device.<br>
When the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 have each<br>
withdrawn from the final optical element FL, such as the period between exposure of the<br>
substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 and exposure of the substrate P on the second<br>
substrate stage 5, the cap holding mechanism (collection port 22) holds the cap member<br>
30. The control device 7 irradiates the measurement device 100 provided at the cap<br>
member 30 with exposure light EL while the space between the final optical element FL<br>
and cap member 30 is filled with liquid LQ. When the measurement device 100 is used<br>
to measure the exposure light EL, the liquid immersion system 1 is used to perform, in<br>
parallel, the supply and recovery of liquid LQ to and from the prescribed space SK<br>
between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30. Measurement results<br>
from the measurement device 100 are transmitted by the transmission device 101 and are<br>
received by the reception device 102. The control device 7 can for example adjust the<br>
illuminance of the exposure light EL or other conditions of irradiation of the exposure<br>
light EL based on the signals received by the reception device 102, that is, based on the<br>
measurement results of the measurement device 100.<br>
In this way, by providing at the cap member 30 a measurement device 100<br>
which performs prescribed measurements relating to exposure processing, measurements<br>
can be performed using the measurement device while the first substrate stage 4 and the<br>
second substrate stage 5 have each withdrawn from the final optical element FL, such as<br>
for example the period between exposure of the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4<br>
and exposure of the substrate P on the second substrate stage 5. Hence reductions in the<br><br>
availability factor (throughput) of the exposure apparatus EX can be suppressed.<br>
The measurement device 100 may also be a temperature sensor which measures<br>
the temperature of the liquid LQ. By providing a temperature sensor in the cap member<br>
30, the temperature of the liquid LQ supplied from supply ports 12 to the optical path<br>
space K can be measured. When measuring the temperature of the liquid LQ, supply<br>
and recovery of liquid LQ to and from the prescribed space SK between the final optical<br>
element FL and the cap member 30 are performed in parallel. The control device 7 can<br>
adjust the temperature of the liquid LQ supplied from supply ports 12 to the optical path<br>
space K based on measurement results of the temperature sensor. When adjusting the<br>
temperature of the liquid LQ supplied from supply ports 12 to the optical path space K,<br>
for example a temperature controller capable of adjusting the temperature of the liquid<br>
LQ supplied to supply ports 12, provided in the liquid supply device 11 of the liquid<br>
immersion system 1, may be used to adjust the temperature of liquid LQ supplied from<br>
supply ports 12 to the optical path space K.<br>
As the measurement device 100, an observation device which measures at least<br>
one among the surface state of the final optical element FL and the state of the liquid LQ<br>
may be used. As the observation device, a device including for example a CCD or other<br>
image capture element can be employed. The observation device provided at the cap<br>
member 30 may for example capture images of the liquid LQ in the prescribed space SK,<br>
or of the lower surface Tl of the final optical element FL, and outputs the results to the<br>
control device 7. Based on the measurement results (observation results) of the<br>
observation device, the control device 7 may for example determine whether the liquid<br>
LQ is contaminated, and more specifically whether foreign matter exists in the liquid LQ,<br>
or whether air bubbles exist in the liquid LQ, or may otherwise determine the state of the<br>
liquid LQ. Based on the observation results of the observation device, the control<br><br>
device 7 can adjust the state of the liquid LQ supplied from supply ports 12 to the optical<br>
path space K. When adjusting the state of liquid LQ supplied from supply ports 12 to<br>
the optical path space K, the control device 7 may use a filter device to clean liquid LQ<br>
supplied to supply ports 12, and/or a deaerator to deaerate liquid LQ, provided in the<br>
liquid supply device 11 of the liquid immersion system 1, to adjust the state of the liquid<br>
LQ supplied from supply ports 12 to the optical path space K.<br>
Furthermore, based on measurement results (observation results) of the<br>
observation device, the control device 7 may determine for example whether the lower<br>
surface Tl of the final optical element FL is contaminated, and more specifically whether<br>
foreign matter adheres to the lower surface Tl, or whether air bubbles adhere to the<br>
lower surface Tl, or may otherwise determine the surface state of the final optical<br>
element FL. Based on the observation results of the observation device, the control<br>
device 7 can for example clean the final optical element FL, or can take other prescribed<br>
measures.<br>
As described above, based on measurement results of a measurement device 100<br>
provided at the cap member 30, the control device can adjust the irradiation conditions of<br>
the exposure light EL, and can adjust the exposure conditions including conditions of the<br>
liquid LQ supplied.<br><fourth embodiment></fourth>
Next, a fourth embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 27. A characteristic<br>
of this embodiment is the fact that a storage device 103 to store the measurement results<br>
of the measurement device 100 is provided in the cap member 30. In the following<br>
description, components the same as or similar to those of the abovementioned<br>
embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is<br>
simplified or omitted.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 27, a storage device 103 to store measurement results of the<br>
measurement device 100 is provided in the cap member 30. The storage device 103 is<br>
connected to the measurement device 100, and can store the results of the measurement<br>
device 100.<br>
When the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 have each<br>
withdrawn from the final optical element FL, between exposure of the substrate P on the<br>
first substrate stage 4 and exposure of the substrate P on the second substrate stage 5 or at<br>
other times, the cap holding mechanism (collection port 22) holds the cap member 30.<br>
With the space between the final optical element FL and cap member 30 filled with liquid<br>
LQ, the control device 7 irradiates the measurement device 100 provided in the cap<br>
member 30 with exposure light EL. Measurement results of the measurement device<br>
100 are stored in the storage device 103. The information stored in the storage device<br>
103 is extracted (read) with prescribed timing. Based on the measurement results of the<br>
measurement device 100, the control device 7 can for example adjust the illuminance of<br>
the exposure light EL or other exposure conditions.<br>
In the fourth embodiment also, as the measurement device 100, a measurement<br>
device which measures information related to the exposure light EL, a measurement<br>
device (observation device) which measures at least one among the surface state of the<br>
final optical element FL and the state of the liquid LQ, a measurement device<br>
(temperature sensor) which measures the temperature of the liquid LQ, and similar may<br>
be used.<br><fifth embodiment></fifth>
Next, a fifth embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 28. A characteristic of<br>
this embodiment is the fact that a temperature controller 110 is provided in the cap<br>
member 30, to adjust at least one among the temperature of a prescribed member in<br><br>
proximity to the cap member 30, and the temperature of the liquid LQ. In the following<br>
description, components the same as or similar to those of the abovementioned<br>
embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is<br>
simplified or omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 28, a temperature controller 110 is provided on the upper<br>
surface of the cap member 30. The temperature controller 110 is provided in a position<br>
in contact with the nozzle member 6, and can adjust the temperature of the nozzle<br>
member 6.<br>
When the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 each have<br>
withdrawn from the final optical element FL, such as the period between exposure of the<br>
substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 and exposure of the substrate P on the second<br>
substrate stage 5 or similar, the cap holding mechanism (collection port 22) holds the cap<br>
member 30. With the space between the final optical element FL and cap member 30<br>
filled with liquid LQ, the control device 7 can use the temperature controller 110<br>
provided in the cap member 30 to adjust the temperature of the nozzle member 6. For<br>
example, there is the possibility that the heat of evaporation due to evaporation of liquid<br>
LQ in contact with the nozzle member 6 may cause a decrease in the temperature of the<br>
nozzle member 6. The control device 7 can use the temperature controller 110 to<br>
compensate for the decrease in temperature of the nozzle member 6. Furthermore, by<br>
providing a temperature sensor capable of detecting the temperature of the nozzle<br>
member 6 in the cap member 30, the temperature controller 110 can be controlled based<br>
on the detection results of the temperature sensor to adjust the temperature of the nozzle<br>
member 6.<br>
The temperature controller can adjust the temperature of the liquid LQ filling the<br>
prescribed space SK between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30.<br><br>
Furthermore, by adjusting the temperature of the liquid LQ in the prescribed space SK,<br>
the temperature controller 110 can also adjust the temperature of the nozzle member 6<br>
and final optical element FL in contact with the liquid LQ.<br>
In the above-described third through fifth embodiments, the collection port 22 of<br>
the nozzle member 6 is used to hold the cap member 30. In the third through fifth<br>
embodiments, a cap holding mechanism 70 such as that explained in the second<br>
embodiment can be used to hold the cap member 30 in a retracted state from the nozzle<br>
member 6 while performing prescribed processing.<br>
In the case of an exposure apparatus EX including two substrate stages, such as<br>
in the above-described first through fifth embodiments, when liquid LQ is held in the<br>
space between the final optical element FL and cap member 30, supply and recovery of<br>
liquid LQ to and from the prescribed space SK between the final optical element FL and<br>
cap member 30 need not be performed.<br>
In the above-described first through fifth embodiments, examples of a<br>
twin-stage type exposure apparatus including two substrate stages capable of holding a<br>
substrate P and moving were described; but application to an exposure apparatus<br>
including a single substrate stage is also possible. For example, when the single<br>
substrate stage withdraws from the final optical element FL of the projection optical<br>
system PL, the cap holding mechanism may hold the cap member 30, and a liquid<br>
immersion system 1 may be used to perform the supply and recovery of liquid LQ in<br>
parallel to a prescribed space SK between the final optical element FL and the cap<br>
member 30.<br>
Or, when the single substrate stage has withdrawn from the final optical element<br>
FL of the projection optical system PL, the cap member 30 may be held by the cap<br>
holding mechanism, and a measurement device provided at the cap member 30 may be<br><br>
used, as described in the above third and fourth embodiments, to perform prescribed<br>
measurements. Or, a temperature controller provided at the cap member 30 may be<br>
used to perform temperature adjustments, as explained in the above-described fifth<br>
embodiment.<br>
In each of the above embodiments, when prescribed measurements are<br>
performed using a measurement device provided at the cap member 30, the supply and<br>
recovery of liquid LQ to and from the prescribed space SK between the final optical<br>
element FL and the cap member 30 are performed in parallel; but measurements may also<br>
be performed with the supply and recovery of liquid LQ halted.<br>
Furthermore, in the above embodiments, when a measurement device provided<br>
at the cap member 30 is used to perform prescribed measurements, the prescribed space<br>
SK between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30 is filled with liquid LQ.<br>
However, a measurement device provided at the cap member 30 may be used to perform<br>
prescribed measurements without filling the prescribed space SK between the final<br>
optical element FL and cap member 30 with liquid LQ.<br>
In the above-described embodiments, when a measurement device is provided at<br>
the cap member 30, measurement processing may be performed with the cap member 30<br>
held by a cap holder 4C (5C). Furthermore, when a temperature controller is provided<br>
at the cap member 30, temperature adjustments may be performed with the cap member<br>
30 held by a cap holder 4C (5C).<br>
By making the upper surface of the cap member 30 a flat surface, and by<br>
irradiating the upper surface of the cap member 30 with the detection light La of the<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8, calibration of the focus/leveling detection system 8<br>
may be performed. In this way, the upper surface of the cap member 30 may be used as<br>
a reference surface for the focus/leveling detection system 8.<br><br>
In the above-described first through fifth embodiments, a position detection<br>
device which detects the position of the cap member 30 may be provided. When the<br>
cap member 30 is mounted on a cap holder 4C (5C), or when the cap member 30 is held<br>
by a cap holding mechanism, by detecting the position of the cap member 30 using a<br>
position detection device, the cap member 30 can be positioned in a desired position<br>
based on the detection results. The position detection device can determine position<br>
information for the cap member 30 by for example optically detecting the position of an<br>
edge of the cap member 30.<br><sixth embodiments></sixth>
Next, a sixth embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 29 through FIG. 39. A<br>
characteristic of this embodiment is the fact that a third stage 53, used to prevent<br>
collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5, is movably<br>
provided on the base member BP. The first substrate stage 4, the second substrate stage<br>
5, and the third stage 53 are driven by a driving device including a linear motor and<br>
similar; but in the drawings used in the following explanation, this driving device is<br>
omitted. Furthermore, components the same as or similar to those of the<br>
abovementioned embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description<br>
thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
An auxiliary 50 to prevent collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the<br>
second substrate stage 5 is provided on the base member BP. Similarly to the<br>
above-described embodiments, the auxiliary 50 is fixed at a prescribed position between<br>
a first work area 10 comprising an exposure station ST1 and a second work area 20<br>
comprising a measurement station ST2. A first passageway 61 is formed between the<br>
auxiliary 50 and the -X side wall 43, and a second passageway 62 is formed between the<br>
auxiliary 50 and the +X side wall 44. The auxiliary 50 has regulating members 51 and<br><br>
52, which perform regulation such that the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate<br>
stage 5 move only on different paths.<br>
In this embodiment, a third stage 53 capable of moving in the XY plane is<br>
provided on the base member BP. The third stage 53 does not hold a substrate P, and<br>
the upper surface F of the third stage 53 is a flat surface. The third stage 53 is provided<br>
to prevent collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5,<br>
and is capable of movement independently of the first substrate stage 4 and the second<br>
substrate stage 5. Similarly to the first and second substrate stages 4 and 5, the third<br>
stage 53 can hold liquid LQ in the space up to the final optical element FL when opposed<br>
to the final optical element FL. Furthermore, position information for the third stage 53<br>
is measured by a laser interferometer 2P.<br>
In this embodiment, the auxiliary 50 has an inner space 50H capable of<br>
accommodating the third stage 53. The auxiliary 50 is formed into a tunnel shape, and<br>
first and second entry/exit apertures 54, 55 are provided, on the +Y side and on the -Y<br>
side, to enable the third stage 53 to enter into and exit from the inner space 50H. Hence<br>
when the third stage 53, accommodated within the inner space 50H of the auxiliary 50,<br>
has exited from the first entry/exit aperture 54 to the second work area 20, the third stage<br>
can pass through the second passageway 62 and move to the first work area 10, and can<br>
enter the inner space 5 OH of the auxiliary 50 from the second entry/exit aperture 55.<br>
The third stage 53 can move in the order of the inner space 50H of the auxiliary 50, the<br>
first entry/exit aperture 54, the second work area 20, the first passageway 61, the first<br>
work area 10, and the second entry/exit aperture 55; can move in the order of the inner<br>
space 50H of the auxiliary 50, the second entry/exit aperture 55, the first work area 10,<br>
the first passageway 61, the second work area 20, and the first entry/exit aperture 54; and,<br>
can also move in the order of the inner space 50H of the auxiliary 50, the second<br><br>
entry/exit aperture 55, the first work area 10, the second passageway 62, the second work<br>
area 20, and the first entry/exit aperture 54.<br>
The control device 7 can adjust the positional relations between the first<br>
substrate stage 4, the second substrate stage 5, and the third stage 53. For example, as<br>
shown in FIG. 39, the first substrate stage 4, the third stage 53, and the second substrate<br>
stage 5 can be brought into proximity or into contact, and the upper surface 4F of the first<br>
substrate stage 4, the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53, and the upper surface 5F of<br>
the second substrate stage 5 can be made substantially the same height (flush).<br>
Furthermore, while supplying and recovering liquid LQ by means of the liquid<br>
immersion system 1, the control device 7 can move the third stage 53 and the second<br>
substrate stage 5, together in a state of either proximity or contact, in a prescribed area<br>
comprising the position EP opposed to (directly below) the projection optical system PL,<br>
and by this means can move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ between the<br>
upper surface 53F of the third stage 53 and the upper surface 5F of the second substrate<br>
stage 5. Similarly, while supplying and recovering liquid LQ by means of the liquid<br>
immersion system 1, the control device 7 can move the third stage 53 and the first<br>
substrate stage 4, together in a state of either proximity or contact, in a prescribed area<br>
comprising the position EP opposed to (directly below) the projection optical system PL,<br>
and by this means can move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ between the<br>
upper surface 53F of the third stage 53 and the upper surface 4F of the first substrate<br>
stage 4.<br>
Next, a method of exposing the substrate P is explained. As shown in FIG. 29,<br>
at the exposure station ST1 liquid immersion exposure of the substrate P held by the first<br>
substrate stage 4 is performed, and at the measurement station ST2, measurement<br>
processing of the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5 is performed. The<br><br>
third stage 53 is positioned in the inner space 50H of the auxiliary 50. As shown in FIG.<br>
30, during exposure of the substrate P, after the third station 53 has exited from the first<br>
entry/exit aperture 54 for the second work area 20 of the measurement station ST2, the<br>
third stage 53 passes through the second passageway 62 and moves to the first work area<br>
10 of the exposure station STL And the second substrate stage 5, having ended<br>
measurement processing at the measurement station ST2, passes through the second<br>
passageway 62 and moves to the exposure station ST1.<br>
After exposure processing of the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 has<br>
ended, in the first work area 10 of the exposure station ST1 the control device 7 causes<br>
the +X side face of the first substrate stage 4 and the -X side face of the third stage 53 to<br>
come into proximity (or contact), and causes the +X side face of the third stage 53 and<br>
the -X side face of the second substrate stage 5 to come into proximity (or contact). The<br>
control device 7 then moves the first substrate stage 4, the third stage 53, and the second<br>
substrate stage 5 together in the -X direction. That is, as shown in FIG. 31, in a<br>
prescribed area comprising the position EP opposing (directly below) the projection<br>
optical system PL, the first substrate stage 4 and the third stage 53 are moved together in<br>
the -X direction in a state of proximity (or contact), so that the liquid immersion region<br>
LR formed on the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 can be moved to the<br>
upper surface 53F of the third stage 53. As shown in FIG. 32, in a prescribed area<br>
comprising the position EP opposing (directly below) the projection optical system PL,<br>
the control device 7 moves the third stage 53 and the second substrate stage 5 together in<br>
the -X direction in a state of proximity (or contact), so that the liquid immersion region<br>
LR of liquid LQ formed on the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53 can be moved to<br>
the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5.<br>
As shown in FIG. 33, the liquid immersion region LR is moved onto the<br><br>
substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5. The control device 7 fills with liquid<br>
LQ the space between the final optical element FL and the substrate P held on the second<br>
substrate stage 5, and exposes the substrate P. When the exposure processing ends, the<br>
first substrate stage 4 holding the substrate P passes through the first passageway 61, and<br>
then, as shown in FIG. 34, moves to the measurement station ST2. The third stage 53<br>
withdraws from the second substrate stage 5 so as not to impede the exposure operation<br>
of the second substrate stage 5.<br>
At the substrate exchange position RP, the control device 7 unloads the substrate<br>
P subjected to exposure processing on the first substrate stage 4, which has moved to the<br>
measurement station ST2, and loads a substrate P to be subjected to exposure processing<br>
onto the first substrate stage 4. Then, the control device 7 performs measurements of<br>
the substrate P loaded onto the first substrate stage 4. As shown in FIG. 35, the control<br>
device 7 then moves the first substrate stage 4, for which measurement processing has<br>
been completed at the measurement station ST2, through the first passageway 61 to the<br>
exposure station STL<br>
After exposure processing of the substrate P on the second substrate stage 5 has<br>
ended, the control device 7 causes the -X side face of the second substrate stage 5 and the<br>
+X side face of the third stage 53 to come into proximity (or contact), and causes the -X<br>
side face of the third stage 53 and the +X side face of the first substrate stage 4 to come<br>
into proximity (or contact). The control device 7 then moves the first substrate stage 4,<br>
third stage 53, and the second substrate stage 5 together in the +X direction. That is, as<br>
shown in FIG. 36, within a prescribed area comprising the position EP opposing (directly<br>
below) the projection optical system PL, the control device 7 moves the second substrate<br>
stage 4 and the third stage 53 together in the +X direction in a state of proximity (or<br>
contact), and by this means can move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ<br><br>
formed on the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 to the upper surface 53F<br>
of the third stage 53. As shown in FIG. 37, within a prescribed area comprising the<br>
position EP opposing (directly below) the projection optical system PL, the control<br>
device 7 moves the third stage 53 and first substrate stage 4 together in the +X direction<br>
in a state of proximity (or contact), and by this means can move the liquid immersion<br>
region LR of liquid LQ formed on the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53 to the<br>
upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4.<br>
As shown in FIG. 38, the liquid immersion region LR moves onto the substrate P<br>
held by the first substrate stage 4. The control device 7 fills the area between the final<br>
optical element FL and the substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4 with liquid LQ,<br>
and exposes the substrate P. The second substrate stage 5 holding the substrate P which<br>
has been subjected to exposure processing passes through the second passageway 62 and<br>
moves to the measurement station ST2. And, the third stage 53 withdraws from the first<br>
substrate stage 4 so as not to impede the exposure operation of the first substrate stage 4.<br>
The control device 7 repeats the above-described operations, repeating in<br>
alternation exposure of a substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 and exposure of a<br>
substrate P on the second substrate stage 5.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment the regulating members 51, 52 are<br>
provided such that the first substrate stage 4 can pass only through the first passageway<br>
61, and such that the second substrate stage 5 can pass only through the second<br>
passageway 62; by means of the auxiliary 50 comprising these regulating members 51,<br>
52,	collisions of the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 are prevented.<br>
The liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ can be moved, via the third stage<br>
53,	between the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 and the upper surface 5F of<br>
the second substrate stage 5, and so the optical path space K can continue to be filled<br><br>
with liquid LQ, without halting the supply of liquid LQ by the liquid immersion system 1.<br>
Hence declines in the availability factor of the exposure apparatus EX accompanying<br>
halts in the supply of liquid LQ and similar can be suppressed.<br>
Movement of the liquid immersion region LR between the upper surface 4F of<br>
the first substrate stage 4 and the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
mediated by the third stage 53; the third stage 53 intervenes between the first substrate<br>
stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5, and so collisions of the first substrate stage 4<br>
and the second substrate stage 5 can be prevented. The third stage 53 may for example<br>
be formed from a material which is softer than that of the first and second substrate<br>
stages 4, 5, or, a cushioning mechanism which absorbs shocks when struck by an object<br>
may be provided in the third stage 53, and by this means significant damage to the first<br>
and second substrate stages 4, 5 when the first or second substrate stages 4, 5 strike the<br>
third stage 53 can be prevented.<br><seventh embodiment></seventh>
Next, a seventh embodiment is explained, referring to FIG. 40. As shown in<br>
FIG. 40, a measurement device 100' which performs prescribed measurements relating to<br>
exposure processing can be provided on the third stage 53. In the following description,<br>
components the same as or similar to those of the abovementioned embodiments are<br>
denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
As the measurement device 100', similarly to the above third embodiment, an<br>
illumination unevenness sensor which measures information related to exposure light EL,<br>
a aerial image measuring sensor, an irradiation quantity sensor (illuminance sensor), or<br>
various other kinds of measurement equipment may be used. As the measurement<br>
device 100', a temperature sensor which measures the temperature of the liquid LQ may<br>
be used, or an observation device which measures at least one among the surface state of<br><br>
the final optical element FL and the state of the liquid LQ may be used.<br>
A measurement operation using the measurement device 100' on the third stage<br>
53 is performed when the liquid immersion region LR has moved from the upper surface<br>
4F of the first substrate stage 4 or from the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage<br>
5 after exposure processing. The control device 7 can adjust the exposure conditions<br>
based on the measurement results of the measurement device 100' provided on the third<br>
stage 53.<br>
A transmission device for wireless transmission of the measurement results of<br>
this measurement device 100' may be provided with this measurement device 100' on the<br>
third stage 53, and a storage device to store results may also be provided.<br>
As described in the above fifth embodiment, a temperature controller to adjust<br>
the temperature of at least a portion among the nozzle member 6, the liquid LQ, and the<br>
final optical element FL may be provided on the third stage 53.<br>
The upper surface 53F of the third stage 53 may be made flat, and by irradiating<br>
the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53 with detection light La of the focus/leveling<br>
detection system 8, calibration of the focus/leveling detection system 8 may be<br>
performed. Thus the upper surface 53 F of the third stage 53 can be used as a reference<br>
surface for the focus/leveling detection system 8.<br><eighth embodiment></eighth>
Next, an eighth embodiment is explained, referring to FIG. 41 through FIG. 45.<br>
In the following description, components the same as or similar to those of the<br>
abovementioned embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description<br>
thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In this embodiment, an auxiliary 50 is provided on the base member BP which<br>
prevents collisions between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5.<br><br>
Similarly to the above embodiments, the auxiliary 50 is fixed in a prescribed position<br>
between a first work area 10 comprising an exposure station ST1 and a second work area<br>
20 comprising a measurement station ST2. A first passageway 61 is formed between<br>
the auxiliary and the-X side wall 43, and a second passageway 62 is formed between the<br>
auxiliary and the +X side wall 44. In this embodiment, the first substrate stage 4 can<br>
pass through the first passageway 61 and the second passageway 62, and the second<br>
substrate stage 5 can also pass through the first passageway 61 and the second<br>
passageway 62.<br>
Similarly to the above-described sixth and seventh embodiments, the exposure<br>
apparatus EX has a third stage 53, provided on the base member BP to enable movement<br>
in the XY plane. Position information for the third stage 53 is measured by a laser<br>
interferometer 2P.<br>
The auxiliary 50 has an inner space 50H capable of accommodating the third<br>
stage 53. The auxiliary 50 is formed into a tunnel shape. In this embodiment, first and<br>
second entry/exit apertures 54, 55 are provided, on the +X side and on the -X side, to<br>
enable the third stage 53 to enter into and exit from the inner space.<br>
As shown in FIG. 41, liquid immersion exposure of the substrate P held by the<br>
substrate stage 4 is performed at the exposure station ST1. Measurement processing of<br>
the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5 is performed at the measurement<br>
station ST2. The third stage 53 is positioned in the inner space 50H of the auxiliary 50.<br>
During exposure of a substrate P, after the third stage 53 exists from the first entry/exit<br>
aperture 54 to the second passageway 62 as shown in FIG. 42, the third stage moves to<br>
the first work area 10 of the exposure station ST1. Also, after the end of measurement<br>
processing at the measurement station ST2, the second substrate stage 5 passes through<br>
the second passageway 62 and moves to the exposure station STL<br><br>
After the end of exposure processing of the substrate P on the first substrate<br>
stage 4, the control device 7 causes the +X side face of the first substrate stage 4 and<br>
the -X side face of the third stage 53 to come into proximity (or contact), and causes the<br>
+X side face of the third stage 53 and the -X side face of the second substrate stage 5 to <br>
come into proximity (or contact), as shown in FIG. 43, and then moves the first substrate<br>
stage 4, third stage 53, and the second substrate stage 5 together in the -X direction. By<br>
this means, the liquid immersion region LR formed on the upper surface 4F of the first<br>
substrate stage 4 passes over the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53, and moves to<br>
the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5.<br>
As shown in FIG. 44, the liquid immersion region LR is moved onto the<br>
substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5, and the substrate P on the second<br>
substrate stage 5 is subjected to liquid immersion exposure. The substrate stage 4<br>
holding the substrate P for which exposure processing has ended passes through the first<br>
passageway 61 and moves to the measurement station ST2. The third stage 53<br>
withdraws from the substrate stage 5 so as not to impede the exposure operation of the<br>
second substrate stage 5.<br>
The control device 7 unloads the substrate P for which exposure processing has<br>
ended on the first substrate stage 4 which has moved to the measurement station ST2,<br>
and loads a substrate P to be subjected to exposure processing onto the first substrate<br>
stage 4. The control device 7 then performs measurements of the substrate P loaded<br>
onto the first substrate stage 4. As shown in FIG. 45, the third stage 53 enters into the<br>
inner space 50H of the auxiliary 50.<br>
During exposure of the substrate P on the second substrate stage 5 at the<br>
exposure station ST 1, the third stage 53 positioned in the inner space 50H of the auxiliary<br>
50 exits from the first entry/exit aperture 54 into the second passageway 62, and then<br><br>
moves to the first work area 10. Furthermore, after the end of measurement processing<br>
at the measurement station ST2, the first substrate stage 4 passes through the second<br>
passageway 62 and moves to the exposure station STL<br>
After the end of exposure processing of the substrate P on the second substrate<br>
stage 5, the control device 7 brings the +X side face of the second substrate stage 5 and<br>
the -X side face of the third stage 53 into proximity (or contact), brings the +X side face<br>
of the third stage 53 and the -X side face of the first substrate stage 4 into proximity (or<br>
contact), and moves the first substrate stage 4, the third stage 53, and the second substrate<br>
stage 5 together in the -X direction. By this means, the liquid immersion region LR<br>
formed on the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 passes over the upper<br>
surface 53F of the third stage 53 and onto the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage<br>
4. Liquid immersion exposure of the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 is then<br>
performed.<br>
The control device 7 repeats the above-described operations, repeating in<br>
alternation exposure of a substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 and exposure of a<br>
substrate P on the second substrate stage 5. In this embodiment, the first substrate stage<br>
4 and the second substrate stage 5 move between the exposure station ST1 and the<br>
measurement station ST2 on the same paths.<br>
As explained above, in this embodiment the liquid immersion region LR of<br>
liquid LQ can move between the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 and the<br>
upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 via the third stage 53, so that the optical<br>
path space K can continue to be filled with liquid LQ without halting the supply of liquid<br>
LQ by the liquid immersion system 1. Hence reductions in the availability factor of the<br>
exposure apparatus EX due to halts in the supply of liquid LQ and similar can be<br>
suppressed. Movement of the liquid immersion region LR between the upper surface<br><br>
4F of the first substrate stage 4 and the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
accomplished via the third stage 53, so that collisions between the first substrate stage 4<br>
and the second substrate stage 5 are prevented.<br><ninth embodiments></ninth>
Next, a ninth embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 46 to FIG. 52. In the<br>
following description, components the same as or similar to those of the abovementioned<br>
embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is<br>
simplified or omitted.<br>
In this embodiment, a fixed auxiliary is not provided on the base member BP; as<br>
an auxiliary to prevent collisions of the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate<br>
stage 5, only a movable third stage 53 is provided on the base member BP. The third<br>
stage 53 is provided so as to enable motion substantially in the Y-axis direction.<br>
Position information for the third stage 53 is measured by a laser interferometer 2P.<br>
As shown in FIG. 46, at the exposure station ST1 the substrate P held by the first<br>
substrate stage 4 is subjected to liquid immersion exposure, and at the measurement<br>
station ST2 the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5 is subjected to<br>
measurement processing. The third stage 53 is positioned between the first substrate<br>
stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5.<br>
After the end of exposure processing of the substrate P on the first substrate<br>
stage 4, the control device 7 brings the +Y side face of the first substrate stage 4 and<br>
the -Y side face of the third stage 53 into proximity (or contact), and moves the first<br>
substrate stage 4 and the third stage 53 together in the -Y direction. By this means, as<br>
shown in FIG. 47, the liquid immersion region LR formed on the upper surface 4F of the<br>
first substrate stage 4 is moved to the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53. In this<br>
embodiment, when the liquid immersion region LR moves from the first substrate stage 4<br><br>
onto the third stage 53, the control device 7 brings the +Y side face of the third stage 53<br>
and the -Y side face of the second substrate stage 5 into proximity (or contact), and<br>
moves the second substrate stage 5 together with the first substrate stage 4 and the third<br>
stage 53 in the-Y direction.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 48, with the space between the final optical element FL<br>
of the projection optical system PL and the third stage 53 filled with liquid LQ, the<br>
control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 in the -X direction, and moves the<br>
second substrate stage 5 in the +Y direction. Then, as shown in FIG. 49, the control<br>
device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 in the +Y direction, and moves the second<br>
substrate stage 5 in the -Y direction, to move the first substrate stage 4 to the -X side of<br>
the third stage 53 and the second substrate stage 5 to the +X side of the third stage 53.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 50, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 in the<br>
+Y direction and the second substrate stage 5 in the -Y direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 51, the control device 7 brings the +Y side face of the second<br>
substrate stage 5 and the -Y side face of the third stage 53 into proximity (or contact), and<br>
moves the second substrate stage 5 and the third stage 53 together in the +Y direction.<br>
By this means, as shown in FIG. 52, the liquid immersion region LR formed on the upper<br>
surface 53F of the third stage 53 is moved to the upper surface 5F of the second substrate<br>
stage 5. In this embodiment, when the liquid immersion region LR moves from the<br>
third stage 53 to the second substrate stage 5, the control device 7 brings the +Y side face<br>
of the third stage 53 and the -Y side face of the first substrate stage 4 into proximity (or<br>
contact), and moves the first substrate stage 4, together with the second substrate stage 5<br>
and the third stage 53, in the +Y direction.<br>
Thus in this embodiment, the liquid immersion region LR is moved onto the<br>
substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5, and liquid immersion exposure of the<br><br>
substrate P on the second substrate stage 5 is performed. Furthermore, the first substrate<br>
stage 4, holding a substrate P for which exposure processing is ended, is moved to the<br>
measurement station ST2. The control device 7 unloads the substrate P for which<br>
exposure processing has ended on the first substrate stage 4 which has moved to the<br>
measurement station ST2, and loads a substrate P to be subjected to exposure processing<br>
onto the first substrate stage 4. Then, the control device 7 performs measurements of<br>
the substrate P loaded onto the first substrate stage 4.<br>
After exposure processing of the substrate P on the second substrate stage 5 has<br>
ended, an operation similar to that described above is performed, so that the liquid<br>
immersion region LR formed on the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5<br>
moves to the upper surface 53F of the third stage 53, and then to the upper surface 4F of<br>
the first substrate stage 4. The control device 7 repeats the above-described operations,<br>
repeating in alternation exposure of a substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 and<br>
exposure of a substrate P on the second substrate stage 5.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment also, the liquid immersion region LR of<br>
liquid LQ can move between the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 and the<br>
upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 via the third stage 53, and so the optical<br>
path space K can continue to be filled with liquid LQ without halting the supply of liquid<br>
LQ by the liquid immersion system 1. Hence a decline in the availability factor of the<br>
exposure apparatus EX accompanying halts in the supply of liquid LQ and similar can be<br>
suppressed. Furthermore, movement of the liquid immersion region LR between the<br>
upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 and the upper surface 5F of the second<br>
substrate stage 5 is performed via the third stage 53, and the third stage 53 intervenes<br>
between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5, so that collisions<br>
between the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 can be prevented.<br><br><tenth embodiment></tenth>
Next, a tenth embodiment is explained referring to FIG. 53 through FIG. 79. In<br>
the following description, components the same as or similar to those of the<br>
abovementioned embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description<br>
thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In this embodiment, a mask stage 3, while holding a mask M, can move in the<br>
X-axis, Y-axis, and 9Z directions through driving by a mask stage driving device MD<br>
including linear motors or other actuators. Position information for the mask stage 3<br>
(and so for the mask M) is measured by the laser interference system 2. The laser<br>
interference system 2 has laser interferometers 2Mz, 2My which measure position<br>
information for the mask stage 3 using moving mirrors 3K provided on the mask stage 3.<br>
The laser interferometer 2Mx can irradiate moving mirrors 3K with measurement light,<br>
taking the X-axis direction as the measurement direction, and can measure the position of<br>
the mask stage in the X-axis direction. The laser interferometer 2My can irradiate<br>
moving mirrors 3K with measurement light, taking the Y-axis direction as the<br>
measurement direction, and can measure the position of the mask stage in the Y-axis<br>
direction. A plurality of at least one type among the laser interferometer 2Mx and the<br>
laser interferometer 2My are provided, and by irradiation with a plurality of beams of at<br>
least one type among measurement light taking the X-axis direction as the measurement<br>
axis and measurement light taking the Y-axis direction as the measurement axis, the laser<br>
interference system 2 can use the plurality of measurement light beams to measure<br>
position information for the mask stage 3 in the 9Z direction. The control device 7<br>
drives the mask stage driving device MD based on measurement results of the laser<br>
interference system 2, and performs position control of the mask M held by the mask<br>
stage 3.<br><br>
Next, movable substrate stages 4, 5 holding substrates P are explained, referring<br>
to FIG. 53 and FIG. 54. FIG. 54 is a plane view seen from above of the substrate stages 4<br>
and 5.<br>
In FIG. 53 and FIG. 54, the first substrate stage 4 includes a stage body 4B, a<br>
first substrate table 4T mounted on the stage body 4B, and a substrate holder 4H<br>
provided on the first substrate table 4T and which holds the substrate P. The substrate<br>
holder 4H is positioned in a depression portion 4R provided on the first substrate table 4T.<br>
The upper surface 4F surrounding the depression portion 4R of the first substrate table<br>
4T is a flat surface of substantially the same height as (flush with) the surface of the<br>
substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H. There may be a step between the surface of<br>
the substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H and the upper surface 4F of the first<br>
substrate table 4T.<br>
The second substrate stage 5 has a configuration equivalent to that of the first<br>
substrate stage 4, including a stage body 5B, a second substrate table 5T mounted on the<br>
stage body 5B, and substrate holder 5H provided on the second substrate table 5T and<br>
which holds the substrate P. The substrate holder 5H is positioned in a depression<br>
portion 5R provided on the second substrate table 5T. The upper surface 5F<br>
surrounding the depression portion 5R of the second substrate table 5T is a flat surface of<br>
substantially the same height as (flush with) the surface of the substrate P held by the<br>
substrate holder 5H. There may be a step between the surface of the substrate P held by<br>
the substrate holder 5H and the upper surface 5F of the second substrate table 5T.<br>
The first substrate stage 4, including the stage body 4B, the substrate table 4T,<br>
and the substrate holder 4H, has substantially the same shape and size as the second<br>
substrate stage 5, including the stage body 5B, the substrate table 5T, and the substrate<br>
holder 5H. As shown in FIG. 54, in this embodiment the substrate tables 4T, 5T of the<br><br>
first and second substrate stages 4, 5 are both substantially rectangular in the XY<br>
directions (in plane view). The upper surfaces 4F, 5F of the substrate tables 4T, 5T are<br>
provided with four corners El to E4. These four corners El to E4 are provided on<br>
around the periphery of the substrate P held by the substrate holders 4H-and 5H, and are<br>
opposable to the final optical element FL. That is, the first and second substrate stages<br>
4 and 5 each have corners El to E4 around the substrates P held by the substrate holders<br>
4H, 5H and which are opposable to the final optical element FL.<br>
In the following explanation, among the four corners on each of the upper<br>
surfaces 4F, 5F of the substrate tables 4T, 5T, the corner on the -X side and -Y side is the<br>
first corner El; the corner on the -X side and +Y side is the second corner E2; the corner<br>
on the +X side and +Y side is the third corner E3; and the corner on the +X side and -Y<br>
side is the fourth corner E4.<br>
The exposure apparatus EX includes a substrate stage driving device PD which<br>
drives the first and second substrate stages 4 and 5. The substrate stage driving device<br>
PD includes a first driving system PD1 and a second driving system PD2. The first<br>
driving system PD1, by moving the stage bodies 4B, 5B in the X-axis direction, Y-axis<br>
direction, and 9Z direction on the base member BP, can move the substrate tables 4T, 5T<br>
mounted on the stage bodies 4B, 5B in the X-axis direction, Y-axis direction, and 9Z<br>
direction. The second driving system PD2 can move the substrate tables 4T, 5T in the<br>
Z-axis direction, 6X direction, and 6Y direction relative to the stage bodies 4B, 5B.<br>
As shown in FIG. 53, the stage bodies 4B, 5B of the first and second substrate<br>
stages 4, 5 are supported in contact-free fashion relative to the upper surface (guide<br>
surface) of the base member BP by air bearings 4 A, 5 A. The upper surface of the base<br>
member BP is substantially parallel to the XY plane. The first substrate stage 4 and the<br>
second substrate stage 5 can move independently over the base member BP in the XY<br><br>
plane.<br>
The first driving system PD1 of the substrate stage driving device PD includes<br>
linear motors or other actuators, and can drive stage bodies 4B, 5B supported in a<br>
contact-free state over the base member BP, in the X-axis direction, Y-axis direction, and<br>
9Z direction. In FIG. 54, the first driving system PD1 includes linear motors 80, 81, 82,<br>
83, 84, 85. The first driving system PD1 includes a pair of Y-axis linear guides 91, 93<br>
extending in the Y-axis direction. The Y-axis linear guides 91, 93 are positioned<br>
separated by a prescribed interval in the X-axis direction. Each of the Y-axis linear<br>
guides 91, 93 includes, for example, magnet units, incorporating permanent magnet<br>
groups having a plurality of sets of N-pole magnets and S-pole magnets, arranged at<br>
prescribed intervals along the Y-axis direction and in alternation. On one of the Y-axis<br>
linear guides 91, two sliders 90, 94 are supported to enable motion in the Y-axis direction<br>
in a contact-free state. Similarly, two sliders 92, 95 are supported on the other Y-axis<br>
linear guide 93 to enable motion in the Y-axis direction in a contact-free state. Each of<br>
the sliders 90, 92, 94, 95 includes for example a coil unit, incorporating armature coils<br>
arranged at prescribed intervals along the Y axis. That is, in this embodiment, by means<br>
of the sliders 90, 94, including coil units, and the Y-axis linear guide 91 including a<br>
magnet unit, moving-coil type Y-axis linear motors 82, 84 are configured. Similarly, by<br>
means of the sliders 92, 95, including coil units, and the Y-axis linear guide 93 including<br>
a magnet unit, moving-coil type Y-axis linear motors 83, 85 are configured.<br>
The sliders 90, 92 comprised by the Y-axis linear motors 82, 83 are respectively<br>
fixed to one end portion and the other end portion in the length direction of an X-axis<br>
linear guide 87 extending in the X-axis direction. Furthermore, the sliders 94, 95<br>
comprised by the Y-axis linear motors 84, 85 are respectively fixed to one end portion<br>
and the other end portion in the length direction of an X-axis linear guide 89 extending in<br><br>
the X-axis direction. Hence the X-axis linear guide 87 is movable in the Y-axis<br>
direction by means of the Y-axis linear motors 82, 83, and the X-axis linear guide 89 is<br>
movable in the Y-axis direction by means of the Y-axis linear motors 84, 85.<br>
Each of the X-axis linear guides 87, 89 includes for example a coil unit<br>
incorporating armature coils arranged at prescribed intervals along the X axis. On one<br>
of the X-axis linear guides 87 is supported the slider 86 to enable motion in the X-axis<br>
direction in a contact-free state. Similarly, on the other X-axis linear guide 89 is<br>
supported the slider 88 to enable motion in the X-axis direction in a contact-free state.<br>
The sliders 86, 88 includes for example magnet units having permanent magnet groups<br>
having a plurality of sets of N-pole magnets and S-pole magnets, arranged at prescribed<br>
intervals along the X-axis direction and in alternation.<br>
In FIG. 54, each of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 is releasably<br>
connected to the sliders 86, 88 via joint members 96, 98, such as those disclosed for<br>
example in Published Japanese Translation No. 2000-511704 of the PCT International<br>
Application, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
2001 -223159. The first substrate stage 4 includes a first joint member 241, provided on<br>
the -Y side face of the stage body 4B, and a second joint member 242, provided on the<br>
+Y side face. Similarly, the second substrate stage 5 includes a third joint member 51,<br>
provided on the -Y side face of the stage body 5B, and a fourth joint member 252,<br>
provided on the +Y side face. The joint member 96 provided on the slider 86 connects<br>
in alternation with the first and third joint members 241, 251 of the stage bodies 4B, 5B.<br>
The joint member 98 provided on the slider 88 connects in alternation with the second<br>
and fourth joint members 242, 252 on the stage bodies 4B, 5B. By means of these joint<br>
members, the slider 86 is connected in alternation with the first and second substrate<br>
stages 4, 5, and the slider 88 is connected in alternation with the first and second<br><br>
substrate stages 4, 5.<br>
By means of the slider 86 and the X-axis linear guide 87, at least a portion of a<br>
moving magnet type X-axis linear motor 80 is formed to drive the stage body 4B of the<br>
first substrate stage 4 or the stage body 5B of the second substrate stage 5, connected via<br>
the joint member 96 to the slider 86, in the X-axis direction. And by means of the slider<br>
88 and the X-axis linear guide 89, at least a portion of a moving magnet type X-axis<br>
linear motor 81 is formed to drive the stage body 5B of the second substrate stage 5 or<br>
the stage body 4B of the first substrate stage 4, connected via the joint member 98 to the<br>
slider 88, in the X-axis direction. By driving the X-axis linear motors 80 and 81, the<br>
control device 7 can control the positions in the X-axis direction of the first and second<br>
substrate stages 4 and 5.<br>
Furthermore, by using the pair of Y-axis linear motors 82, 83, the control device<br>
7 can drive the X-axis linear guide 87 to control the positions in the Y-axis direction of<br>
the first substrate stage 4 or second substrate stage 5 connected to the slider 86 via the<br>
joint member 96. Similarly, by using the pair of Y-axis linear motors 84, 85, the control<br>
device 7 can drive the X-axis linear guide 89 to control the positions in the Y-axis<br>
direction of the first substrate stage 4 or second substrate stage 5 connected to the slider<br>
88 via the joint member 98. Furthermore, by making the driving amounts (thrusts)<br>
generated by the pair of Y-axis linear motors 82, 83 slightly different, the control device<br>
7 can control the positions in the 9Z direction of the first and second substrate stages<br>
connected to the slider 86. Similarly, by making the driving amounts (thrusts) generated<br>
by the pair of Y-axis linear motors 84, 85 slightly different, the control device 7 can<br>
control the positions in the 0Z direction of the first and second substrate stages connected<br>
to the slider 88.<br>
As shown in FIG. 53, the second driving system PD2 of the substrate stage<br><br>
driving device PD includes for example voice coil motors or other actuators 4V and 5V,<br>
intervening between the stage bodies 4B, 5B and the substrate tables 4T, 5T, and<br>
measurement devices (encoders or similar), not shown, which measure the driving<br>
amounts for each actuator. As shown in FIG. 53, the substrate table 4T is supported on<br>
the stage body 4B by at least three actuators 4 V. Each of the actuators 4 V can<br>
independently drive the substrate table 4T in the Z-axis direction relative to the stage<br>
body 4B. By adjusting the driving amounts of each of the three actuators 4V, the<br>
control device 7 can drive the substrate table 4T in the Z-axis direction, 8X direction, and<br>
BY direction relative to the stage body 4B. Similarly, the substrate table 5T is supported<br>
on the stage body 5B by at least three actuators 4V. By adjusting the driving amounts of<br>
each of the three actuators 5 V, the control device 7 can drive the substrate table 5T in the<br>
Z-axis direction, 9X direction, and 9Y direction relative to the stage body 5B.<br>
In this way, the substrate stage driving device PD, including the first and second<br>
driving systems PD1 and PD2, can move, with six degrees of freedom in the X-axis, the<br>
Y-axis, the Z-axis, the GX, the 6Y, and the 9Z directions, each of the substrate tables 4T,<br>
5T of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5. By controlling the substrate stage<br>
driving device PD, the control device 7 can control the positions in six degrees of<br>
freedom, in the X-axis, the Y-axis, the Z-axis, the 6X, the BY, and the 9Z directions, of<br>
the surfaces of the substrates P held by the substrate holders 4H, 5H of the substrate<br>
tables 4T, 5T.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 54, the exposure apparatus EX comprises a first<br>
area SP1, a second area SP2, and a third area SP3 set on the base member BP. The first<br>
area SP1 comprises the area opposing the final optical element FL of the projection<br>
optical system PL, and is an area comprising at least a portion of the exposure station<br><br>
STL The second area SP2 is an area different from the first area SP1, and is an area<br>
comprising at least a portion of the measurement station ST2. The third area SP3 is an<br>
area between the first area SP1 and the second area SP2, and is an area in which<br>
connection and release of the slider 86 and substrate stage 4 (or 5), connection and<br>
release of the slider 88 and substrate stage 5 (or 4), connection of the slider 86 with the<br>
substrate stage 5 (or 4), and connection of the slider 88 with the substrate stage 4 (or 5),<br>
are performed, as disclosed in for example Published Japanese Translation No.<br>
2000-511704 of the PCT International Application and Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2001-223159.<br>
The control device 7 can use the substrate stage driving device PD (first driving<br>
system PD1) to move the first substrate stage 4 within a prescribed area on the base<br>
member BP comprising the first area SP1, the second area SP2, and the third area SP3.<br>
Similarly, the control device 7 can use the substrate stage driving device PD (first driving<br>
system PD1) to move the second substrate stage 5 within a prescribed area on the base<br>
member BP comprising the first area SP1, the second area SP2, and the third area SP3,<br>
independently of the first substrate stage 4.<br>
Next, an example of a laser interference system 2 to measure position<br>
information for the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, is explained, referring to FIG.<br>
53. The laser interference system 2 uses reflective surfaces 2Ka, 2Kb provided at<br>
prescribed positions on the substrate tables 4T, 5T of the first and second substrate stages<br>
4, 5 to measure position information relating to the six degrees of freedom in the X-axis,<br>
the Y-axis, the Z-axis, the 6X, the 6Y, and the 0Z directions of the substrate tables 4T and<br>
5T.<br>
The laser interference system 2 has laser interferometers 2Px, 2Py, 2Pz, which<br>
use the reflecting surfaces 2Ka, 2Kb provided at prescribed positions on the respective<br><br>
substrate tables 4T, 5T of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 to measure position<br>
information for the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 (substrate tables 4T, 5T). The<br>
laser interferometers 2Px, 2Py, 2Pz are provided at both the exposure station ST1 and at<br>
the measurement station ST2. The laser interferometers 2Px, 2Py, 2Pz provided at the<br>
exposure station ST1 measure position information for the first substrate stage 4 (or the<br>
second substrate stage 5) existing at the exposure station STL The laser interferometers<br>
2Px, 2Py, 2Pz provided at the measurement station ST2 measure position information for<br>
the second substrate stage 5 (or first substrate stage 4) existing at the measurement<br>
station ST2.<br>
The laser interferometer 2Px can irradiate the reflecting surface 2Ka with<br>
measurement light taking the X-axis direction as the measurement axis, and measures the<br>
position in the X-axis direction of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5. The laser<br>
interferometer 2Py can irradiate the reflecting surface 2Ka with measurement light taking<br>
the Y-axis direction as the measurement axis, and measures the position in the Y-axis<br>
direction of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5.<br>
The laser interferometer 2Pz can irradiate the reflecting surface 2Kb with<br>
measurement light taking the Z-axis direction as the measurement axis, and measures the<br>
position in the Z-axis direction of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5. The<br>
reflecting surface 2Kb is inclined by a prescribed angle (for example, 45°) so as to be<br>
directed upward; measurement light emitted from the laser interferometer 2Pz and<br>
incident on the reflecting surface 2Kb is reflected by the reflecting surface 2Kb, and is<br>
incident on a reflecting surface 2Kc provided on a prescribed support frame FC.<br>
Measurement light reflected by this reflecting surface 2Kc is reflected by the reflecting<br>
surface 2Kb of the substrate table 4T or 5T, and is received by the laser interferometer<br>
2Pz. The laser interferometer 2Pz can use the received measurement light to measure<br><br>
position information in the Z-axis direction for the first or second substrate stage 4, 5.<br>
Technology relating to laser interferometry (Z interferometer) capable of measuring<br>
position information of a substrate table (substrate stage) in the Z-axis direction is for<br>
example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
2000-323404 and Published Japanese Translation No. 2001-513267 of the PCT<br>
International Application.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a plurality of at least one type among the laser<br>
interferometer.2Px and the laser interferometer 2Py, and by irradiating with a plurality of<br>
beams of at least one type among measurement light taking the X-axis direction as the<br>
measurement axis and measurement light taking the Y-axis direction as the measurement<br>
axis, the laser interference system 2 can use the plurality of measurement light beams to<br>
measure position information in the 0Z direction for the first and second substrate stages<br>
4, 5. Furthermore, by providing a plurality of laser interferometers 2Pz, and by<br>
irradiating with a plurality of measurement light beams taking the Z-axis direction as the<br>
measurement axis, the laser interference system 2 can use the plurality of measurement<br>
light beams to measure position information in the 6X and BY directions for the first and<br>
second substrate stages 4, 5.<br>
The control device 7 drives the substrate stage driving device PD based on<br>
measurement results of the laser interference system 2, and performs position control of<br>
the substrate tables 4T, 5T of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, and therefore<br>
position control of the substrates P held by the substrate holders 4H, 5H of the substrate<br>
tables 4T, 5T.<br>
In the following description, the laser interferometers 2Px, 2Py, 2Pz are called X<br>
interferometers 2Pz, Y interferometers 2Py, and Z interferometers 2Pz, as appropriate.<br>
A projection optical system PL, a liquid immersion system 1, and similar are<br><br>
provided at the exposure station ST1. At the exposure station ST1, a substrate P is<br>
exposed via the projection optical system PL and liquid LQ. At the measurement<br>
station ST2, measurement systems (8, 9) which perform measurements related to<br>
exposure of substrates P are provided. At the measurement station ST2, measurements<br>
related to exposure and exchange of substrates P are performed. The first substrate<br>
stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 each can move, while holding a substrate P,<br>
between the first area SP1 below the projection optical system PL of the exposure station<br>
ST1 and the second area SP2 below the measurement systems (8, 9) of the measurement<br>
station ST2.<br>
The measurement station ST2 is provided with a focus/leveling detection system<br>
8, which detects surface position information (surface position information for the Z axis,<br>
9X, and 0Y directions) for the surfaces of substrates P held by the first and second<br>
substrate stages 4, 5. The focus/leveling detection system 8 includes a projection<br>
system 8 A, which irradiates the surface of a substrate P with detection light La from an<br>
oblique direction, and a light-receiving system 8B, which can receive detection light La<br>
reflected by the surface of a substrate P. In this embodiment, the projection system 8 A<br>
and light-receiving system 8B are supported by a support frame FC via a support<br>
mechanism 8F. At the measurement station ST2, the focus/leveling detection system 8<br>
detects, in alternation, surface position information for the surface of the substrate P held<br>
by the first substrate stage 4 and surface position information for the surface of the<br>
substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5.<br>
The substrate tables 4T, 5T of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 are<br>

element FL, to perform measurements related to exposure. At the measurement station<br>
ST2, reference marks 272 are provided in the measurement regions 274 and 275, and a<br><br>
mark detection system 209 to detect alignment marks provided on substrates P held by<br>
the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 is provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 54, a transport system H to perform exchanges of substrates P<br>
is provided in vicinity of the measurement station ST2. The control device 7 can use<br>
the transport system H perform substrate exchange tasks, in which a substrate P which<br>
has been subjected to exposure processing, on a first substrate stage 4 (or second<br>
substrate stage 5) which has moved to the substrate exchange position (loading position)<br>
RP of the measurement station ST2 is unloaded, and a substrate P which is to be<br>
subjected to exposure processing is loaded onto the first substrate stage 4 (or second<br>
substrate stage 5).<br>
As shown in FIG. 54, measurement regions 274, 275 to perform measurements<br>
related to exposure, opposable to the final optical element FL, are provided on the<br>
substrate tables 4T, 5T of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5. The measurement<br>
regions 274 (274A, 275B) are provided at prescribed positions on the substrate table 4T<br>
of the first substrate stage 4. The substrate table 4T has two measurement regions,<br>
274A and 274B. The first measurement region 274A is provided at the second corner<br>
E2 on the upper surface 4F of the substrate table 4T. The second measurement region<br>
274B is provided at the third corner E3. The measurement regions 275 (275A, 275B)<br>
are provided at prescribed positions on the substrate table 5T of the second substrate<br>
stage 5. Similarly to the substrate table 4T, the substrate table 5T also has two<br>
measurement regions, 275A and 275B. The first measurement region 275A is provided<br>
at the second corner E2 on the upper surface 5F of the substrate table 5T. The second<br>
measurement region 275B is provided at the third corner E3.<br>
Each of the first and second measurement regions 274 A, 274B on the first<br>
substrate stage 4 and first and second measurement regions 275A, 275B on the second<br><br>
substrate stage 5 is provided with a reference surface 111, a. reference mark (reference<br>
mask) 272, and a aperture 273, such as are disclosed in for example Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Application No. 2002-158168. Belowthe<br>
apertures 273 (within the substrate tables 4T, 5T) are provided optical sensors 270<br>
capable of receiving light passing through the apertures 273.<br>
Next, a liquid immersion system 1 is explained, referring to FIG. 55. As<br>
described above, the exposure apparatus EX of this embodiment is a liquid immersion<br>
exposure apparatus which performs exposure in a state in which .the optical path space K<br>
on the light emission side of the final optical element FL is filled with liquid LQ, and<br>
includes a liquid immersion system 1 used to fill the optical path space K with liquid LQ.<br>
The liquid immersion system 1 includes a seal member 212 such as that disclosed for<br>
example in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2004-289126<br>
and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2004-289128,<br>
provided surrounding the final optical element FL, to fill a prescribed space, comprising<br>
the optical path space K on the light emission side of the final optical element FL, with<br>
liquid LQ.<br>
The seal member 212 of this embodiment includes a flow path 213 to perform<br>
supply and recovery of liquid LQ to and from the optical path space K. The liquid<br>
immersion system 1 includes a liquid supply device to supply liquid LQ to the optical<br>
path space K via the flow path 213, and a liquid recovery device to recover liquid LQ.<br>
The liquid supply device is capable of supplying liquid LQ to the optical path space K<br>
via the flow path 213; the liquid recovery device is capable of recovering liquid LQ from<br>
the optical path space K via the flow path 213.<br>
The seal member 212 of this embodiment includes a gas inlet 15 and gas outlet<br>
214, forming a gas seal 216 to confine liquid LQ in the space between the lower surface<br><br>
of the seal member 212 and the surface of the substrate P. In the lower surface of the<br>
seal member 212 are formed a first groove 218, connected to the gas inlet 15, formed in a<br>
ring shape so as to surround the optical path space K, and a second groove 219,<br>
connected to the gas outlet 214, formed in a ring shape so as to surround the optical path<br>
space K. The first groove 218 is formed outwardly lateral to the second groove 219<br>
related to the optical path space K.<br>
By means of a gas introduction (supply) operation via the gas inlet 15 and a gas<br>
evacuation (suction) operation via the gas outlet 214, the control device 7 can form a<br>
fluid bearing (gas bearing) 220 between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the<br>
surface of the substrate P. A vacuum preloaded gas bearing 220 is formed between the<br>
lower surface of the seal bearing 212 and the surface of the substrate P. By means of the<br>
gas bearing 220, a gap G (of for example 0.1 to 1.0 mm) is maintained between the lower<br>
surface of the seal member 212 and the surface of the substrate P.<br>
Furthermore, the seal member 212 is supported by the support frame FC via the<br>
support mechanism 212F. The support mechanism 212F includes, for example, a spring<br>
member, a flexure or other elastic member, or a flexible member, and flexibly (movably)<br>
supports the seal member 212. A gas bearing 220 is formed between the lower surface<br>
of the seal bearing 212 and the surface of the substrate P, and the seal bearing 212 is<br>
flexibly supported by the support mechanism 212F. Even when there are changes in the<br>
position and attitude of the substrate P opposing the lower surface of the seal bearing 212,<br>
the position and attitude of the seal bearing 212 change so as to follow changes in the<br>
position and attitude of the substrate P. Hence even when the position and attitude of<br>
the substrate P change, the gap G is maintained between the lower surface of the seal<br>
bearing 212 and the surface of the substrate P.<br>
The substrate holder 4H is provided on the inside of a depression portion 4R,<br><br>
formed at a prescribed position in the upper surface 4F of the substrate table 4T. As<br>
shown in FIG. 55, an upper surface 250, opposable to the lower surface of the substrate P<br>
positioned on the inside of the depression portion 4R, is provided on the inside of the<br>
depression portion 4R. On the upper surface 250 are provided support portions 281,<br>
including a plurality of pin-shape members supporting the lower surface of the substrate<br>
P, and a peripheral wall 282, having an upper surface opposing the lower surface of the<br>
substrate P and provided so as to surround the supporting portions 281. In the upper<br>
surface 250 are further provided suction apertures 253 connected to a vacuum system,<br>
not shown. By driving the vacuum system to cause suction via the suction apertures<br>
253 of air in the space 254 formed by the upper surface 250, the peripheral wall 282, and<br>
the lower surface of the substrate P supported by the support portions 281, to induce a<br>
negative pressure in the space 254, the control device 7 can clamp and hold the lower<br>
surface of the substrate P to the support portions 281. That is, the substrate holder 4H<br>
of this embodiment includes a so-called pin chuck mechanism, and can perform vacuum<br>
clamping of the substrate P. By releasing the suction operation via the suction apertures<br>
253, the control device 7 can release the substrate P from the substrate holder 4H. In<br>
this way, the substrate holder 4H can releasably hold the substrate P.<br>
The substrate holder 5H has the same configuration as the substrate holder 4H,<br>
and is provided within a depression portion 5R formed at a prescribed position in the<br>
upper surface 5F of the substrate table 5T. The substrate holder 5H can also releasably<br>
hold a substrate P.<br>
The upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 is positioned on adjacent<br>
around the periphery of the upper surface of the substrate P held by the substrate holder<br>
4H of the first substrate stage 4. The upper surface of the substrate P held by the<br>
substrate holder 4H and the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 are<br><br>
substantially flush. Similarly, the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
positioned on adjacent around the periphery of the upper surface of the substrate P held<br>
by the substrate holder 5H of the second substrate stage 5. The upper surface of the<br>
substrate P held by the substrate holder 5H and the upper surface 5F of the second<br>
substrate stage 5 are substantially flush.<br>
Inner side faces forming the depression portions 4R, 5R of the substrate stages 4<br>
are arranged to oppose the side faces of substrates P held by the substrate holders 4, 5.<br>
A prescribed gap is formed between the side faces of substrates P and the inner side faces<br>
of the substrate stages 4, 5. The gap formed between the side faces of substrates P held<br>
by the substrate holders 4H, 5H and the inner side faces of substrate stages 4, 5 is very<br>
small, for example from 0.1 to 1 mm approximately. Hence the permeation of liquid<br>
LQ from the space between the surface of the substrate P and the upper surface 4F, 5F of<br>
the substrate stage 4, 5 into the interior of the substrate stage 4, 5 and lower-surface side<br>
of the substrate P is suppressed.<br>
Furthermore, the exposure apparatus EX of this embodiment includes a cap<br>
member 30, which can hold liquid LQ up to the final optical element FL, such as is<br>
disclosed for example in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
2004-289128. The cap member 30 is formed according to the size and shape of the<br>
liquid immersion region LR formed by the seal member 212. In this embodiment, the<br>
cap member 30 is a plate-shape member of substantially the same thickness as a substrate<br>
P, of substantially circular shape in plane view. Furthermore, the surface of the cap<br>
member 30 has the property of repelling the liquid LQ. In this embodiment, the cap<br>
member 30 is formed from for example a fluoride resin material comprising<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene or another material with liquid-repelling properties. The cap<br>
member 30 may also be formed from stainless steel, titanium, or another prescribed<br><br>
metal, and the surface covered with a material having liquid-repelling properties.<br>
The seal member 212 can releasably hold the cap member 30 so as to be<br>
opposed to the final optical element FL. The seal member 212 uses the clamping action<br>
resulting from formation of a gas bearing between the cap member 30 and the seal<br>
member 212, and holds the cap member 30 in a state of maintaining a prescribed gap<br>
between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of the cap<br>
member 30.<br>
The substrate table 4T of the first substrate stage 4 includes a first cap holder 4C<br>
to releasably hold the cap member 30. Similarly, the substrate table 5T of the second<br>
substrate stage 5 includes a second cap holder 5C to releasably hold the cap member 30.<br>
The first cap holder 4C is provided at a prescribed position on the substrate table<br>
4T; the second cap holder 5C is provided at a prescribed position on the substrate table<br>
5T. As described above, the substrate holder 4T of the first substrate stage 4 and<br>
substrate holder 5T of the second substrate stage 5 are of substantially the same shape<br>
and size. In this embodiment, the first cap holder 4C and the second cap holder 5C are<br>
provided at substantially the same position on the substrate tables 4T, 5T. Specifically,<br>
as shown in FIG. 54, the first and second cap holders 4C, 5C are provided at the<br>
respective first corners El of the substrate tables 4T, 5T.<br>
As shown in FIG. 55, the first cap holder 4C is provided on the inside of a<br>
depression portion 3D formed in a prescribed position of the upper surface 4F of the<br>
substrate table 4T. On the inside of the depression portion 4D is provided an upper<br>
surface 260, opposable to the lower surface of the cap member 30 positioned on the<br>
inside of the depression portion 4D. A peripheral wall 262, having an upper surface<br>
opposable to the peripheral area of the lower surface of the cap member 30, is provided<br>
on the upper surface 260. Furthermore, a suction aperture 263, connected to a vacuum<br><br>
system, not shown, is provided in the upper surface 260. The control device 7 drives<br>
the vacuum system to induce suction, via the suction aperture 263, of air in the space 264<br>
formed by the upper surface 260, the peripheral wall 262, and the lower surface of the<br>
• cap member 30 supported by the peripheral wall 262, by this means inducing a negative<br>
pressure in the space 264, to clamp the lower surface of the cap member 30. That is, the<br>
first cap holder 4C of this embodiment includes a so-called vacuum chuck mechanism,<br>
and can clamp the cap member 30. By releasing the suction operation via the suction<br>
aperture 263, the control device 7 can release the cap member 30 from the upper surface<br>
260 of the first cap holder 4C. In this way, the first cap holder 4C can releasably hold<br>
the cap member 30.<br>
The second cap holder 5C has a configuration equivalent to that of the first cap<br>
holder 4C, provided inside a depression portion 5D formed in a prescribed position of the<br>
upper surface 5F of the substrate table 5T. The second cap holder 5C also releasably<br>
holds the cap member 30.<br>
The upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 is positioned on adjacent<br>
lateral to the periphery of the upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the first cap<br>
holder 4C. The upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the first cap holder 4C is<br>
substantially flush with the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4. Similarly, the<br>
upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 is positioned on adjacent lateral to the<br>
periphery of the upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C.<br>
The upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C is<br>
substantially flush with the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5.<br>
Inner side faces forming the depression portions 4D, 5D of the substrate stages 4<br>
are positioned opposing the side face of the cap member 30 held by the first and second<br>
cap holders 4C, 5C. A prescribed gap is formed between the side face of the cap<br><br>
member 30 and the inner side faces of the substrate stages 4, 5. The gap formed<br>
between the side face of the cap member 30 held by the first and second cap holders 4C,<br>
5C and the inner side faces of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 is very small, for<br>
example from 0.1 to 1 mm approximately. Hence the permeation of liquid LQ from the<br>
space between the surface of the cap member 30 and the upper surfaces 4F, 5F of the<br>
substrate stages 4, 5 into the interior of the substrate stages 4, 5 and lower-surface side of<br>
the cap member 30 is suppressed.<br>
In this embodiment, the exposure apparatus EX includes one cap member 30.<br>
Hence when the cap member 30 is held by the cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4,<br>
the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5 does not hold the cap member 30, and<br>
is in the empty state. Similarly, when the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5<br>
holds the cap member 30, the cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4 does not hold<br>
the cap member 30, and is in the empty state.<br>
Next, the basic operation of the exposure apparatus EX is explained, referring to<br>
the flowchart of FIG. 56.<br>
In this embodiment, when one stage 4 (or 5) among the first and second<br>
substrate stages 4, 5 is positioned at the first area SP1 of the exposure station ST1, the<br>
other stage 5 (or 4) is at the second area SP2 of the measurement station ST2 for<br>
prescribed processing. Specifically, with the optical path space K of the exposure light<br>
EL filled with liquid LQ, the control device executes control to move one stage 4 (or 5)<br>
among the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5, existing at the<br>
exposure station ST1, while performing exposure of the substrate P held by the stage 4<br>
(or 5) via the projection optical system PL and liquid LQ. On the other hand, the<br>
control device 7 performs measurements, without the mediation of liquid LQ, of position<br>
information for an unexposed substrate P held by the other stage 5 (or 4) existing at the<br><br>
measurement station ST2. Here, position information for a substrate P includes at least<br>
one among surface position information (position information in the Z, OX, 9Y<br>
directions) for the substrate P relative to the image plane of the projection optical system<br>
PL or another prescribed reference plane or surface, and alignment information (position<br>
information in the X, Y, 9Z directions for a plurality of shot areas on the substrate P)<br>
relative to a prescribed reference position.<br>
In the following description, a state in which the optical path space K is not<br>
filled with liquid LQ is called a "dry" state, and a state in which the optical path space K<br>
is filled with liquid LQ is called a "wet" state. The image plane formed via the<br>
projection optical system PL and liquid LQ is called the image plane formed in a wet<br>
state.<br>
At the measurement station ST2, the control device 7 initiates exchange of<br>
substrates P and prescribed measurement processing. For example, the control device 7<br>
positions the second substrate stage 5 at the substrate exchange position RP of the<br>
measurement station ST2, and uses the transport system H to load a substrate P for<br>
exposure processing onto the second substrate stage 5. Then, at the measurement<br>
station ST2, the control device 7 initiates measurement processing related to the second<br>
substrate stage 5 holding the substrate P. On the other hand, the first substrate stage 4 is<br>
positioned at the exposure station ST1, and exposure of the substrate P, for which<br>
measurement processing at the measurement station ST2 has been completed, is initiated.<br>
In this embodiment, measurements performed at the measurement station ST2<br>
include detection operations using a mark detection system 209 and a focus/leveling<br>
detection system 8. At the measurement station ST2, the control device 7 moves the<br>
second substrate stage 5 in XY directions, to position the first measurement region 275A<br>
on the second substrate stage 5 in the detection area of the mark detection system 209.<br><br>
At the measurement station ST2, an X interferometer 2Pz and Y interferometer 2Py<br>
measure position information in the X-axis direction and Y-axis direction for the second<br>
substrate stage 5, and the mark detection system 209 detects reference marks 272<br>
provided in the first measurement region 275 A on the second substrate stage 5, without<br>
using liquid (step SA1).<br>
By this means, the control device 7 can determine position information relating<br>
to the X-axis direction and Y-axis direction for the reference marks 272 in the first<br>
measurement region 275A in a coordinate system defined by the laser interference<br>
system 2 (X, Y interferometers 2Px, 2Py).<br>
Further, at the measurement station ST2, the Z interferometer 2Pz measures<br>
position information in the Z-axis direction for the second substrate stage 5, and the<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8 detects the reference surface 271 provided in the first<br>
measurement region 275 A on the second substrate stage 5, without using liquid (step<br>
SA2).<br>
By this means, the control device 7 can determine surface position information<br>
relating to the Z-axis, 9X, and 9Y directions for the reference surface 271 in the first<br>
measurement region 275 A in the coordinate system defined by the laser interference<br>
system 2 (Z interferometer 2Pz).<br>
Next, at the measurement station ST2, the control device 7 moves the second<br>
substrate stage 5 in XY directions and positions the second measurement region 275B on<br>
the second substrate stage 5 at the detection area of the mark detection system 209. At<br>
the measurement station ST2, an X interferometer 2Px and Y interferometer 2Py measure<br>
position information in the X-axis direction and Y-axis direction for the second substrate<br>
stage 5, and the mark detection system 209 detects the reference marks 272 provided in<br>
the second measurement region 275B on the second substrate stage 5, without using<br><br>
liquid (step SA3).<br>
By this means, the control device 7 can determine position information related<br>
to the X-axis direction and Y-axis direction for the reference marks 272 in the second<br>
measurement region 275B in the coordinate system defined by the laser interference<br>
system 2 (X, Y interferometers 2Px, 2Py).<br>
Furthermore, at the measurement station ST2, the X interferometer 2Px and Y<br>
interferometer 2Py measure position information in the X-axis direction and Y-axis<br>
direction for the second substrate stage 5 holding a substrate P, and the mark detection<br>
system 209 detects alignment marks provided on the substrate P accompanying a<br>
plurality of shot areas on the substrate P, without using liquid (step SA4).<br>
By this means, the control device 7 can determine position information related<br>
to the X-axis and Y-axis directions for each alignment mark in the coordinate system<br>
defined by the laser interference system 2 (X, Y interferometers 2Px, 2Py).<br>
Furthermore, at the measurement station ST2, a Z interferometer 2Pz measures<br>
position information in the Z-axis direction for the second substrate stage 5, and the<br>
focus/leveling detection system 8 detects surface position information for the surface of<br>
the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5, without using liquid (step SA5).<br>
In this embodiment, the control device 7 controls movement of the second<br>
substrate stage 5, and while moving the second substrate stage 5 holding the substrate P<br>
in the XY plane, uses the focus/leveling detection system 8 to detect the surface position<br>
at a plurality of detection points on the surface of the substrate P. For example, while<br>
monitoring the outputs of X and Y interferometers 2Px, 2Py, the control device 7 moves<br>
the second substrate stage 5, and uses the focus/leveling detection system 8 to detect<br>
surface position information at a plurality of points in the plane (the XY plane) on the<br>
surface of the substrate P. By this means, the control device 7 can determine surface<br><br>
position information at the plurality of detection points on the surface of the substrate P<br>
in the coordinate system defined by the laser interference system 2 (Z interferometer 2Pz).<br>
Detection results of the focus/leveling detection system 8 are associated with positions of<br>
the substrate P in the XY plane, and are stored in the control device 7.<br>
Based on position information for each alignment mark on the substrate P,<br>
determined in step SA4, the control device 7 performs computation processing to<br>
determine position information for each of the plurality of shot areas on the substrate P<br>
relative to stipulated reference positions, using the measurement results of step SA1 and .<br>
the measurement results of step SA3 (step SA6).<br>
Furthermore, the control device 7 creates map data based on position<br>
information for the plurality of detection points on the surface of the substrate P, detected<br>
in step SA5, and based on the map data determines an approximate plane (approximate<br>
surface) for each of the shot areas on the surface of the substrate P, with the reference<br>
surface 271 as reference (step SA7).<br>
The control device 7 stores the approximate plane for the surface of the substrate<br>
P determined at the measurement station ST2.<br>
When processing at the exposure station ST1 and processing at the measurement<br>
station ST2 have both ended, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 to the<br>
measurement station ST2, and moves the second substrate stage 5 to the exposure station<br>
ST1. After the first substrate stage 4 holding a substrate P which has been subjected to<br>
exposure processing is moved to the measurement station ST2, the transport system H<br>
unloads the substrate P from the first substrate stage 4. Then, a substrate P to be<br>
subjected to exposure processing is loaded onto the first substrate stage 4 at the<br>
measurement station ST2, and the above-described measurement processing is<br>
performed.<br><br>
On the other hand, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5,<br>
holding a substrate P which has been subjected to measurement processing at the<br>
measurement station ST2, to the exposure station ST1, and then, at the exposure station<br>
ST1, moves the second substrate stage 5, and positions the first measurement region<br>
275A on the second substrate stage 5 in the projection area AR of the projection optical<br>
system PL.<br>
At this time, the position and attitude of the substrate table 5T are controlled<br>
such that the image plane formed in the wet state and the reference surface 271<br>
substantially coincide. By this means, the relation between the measured values of the<br>
Z interferometer 2Pz, the image plane formed in the wet state, and the reference surface<br>
271 is defined, and so the control device 7 can determine the relation between the<br>
approximate plane to the surface of the substrate P, determined in step SA7, the measured<br>
values of the Z interferometer 2Pz, and the image plane formed in the wet state (step<br>
SA8).<br>
Then, while measuring position information for the second substrate stage 5<br>
using the laser interference system 2, the control device 7 can use the optical sensor 270<br>
provided at the first measurement region 275 A to detect, in the wet state, the aerial image<br>
of alignment marks provided on the mask M (step SA9).<br>
That is, the control device 7 brings the first measurement region 275A into<br>
opposition with the projection optical system PL, and with the optical path space K<br>
between the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL and the first<br>
measurement region 275A filled with liquid LQ, illuminates the alignment marks<br>
provided on the mask M with exposure light EL. By this means a aerial image of the<br>
alignment marks provided on the mask M is projected onto the first measurement region<br>
275A via the projection optical system PL and liquid LQ, and the optical sensor 270<br><br>
provided at the first measurement region 275 A of the second substrate stage 5 can<br>
measure the aerial image of alignment marks provided on the mask M in the wet state.<br>
Next, at the measurement station ST2, the control device 7 moves the second<br>
substrate stage 5 in XY directions, and positions the second measurement region 275B on<br>
the second substrate stage 5 in the projection area of the projection optical system PL.<br>
Then, using a procedure similar to that of step SA9 above, while using the laser<br>
interference system 2 to measure position information for the second substrate stage 5,<br>
the control device 7 uses the optical sensor 270 provided at the second measurement<br>
region 275B to detect, in the wet state, a aerial image of alignment marks provided on the<br>
mask M (step SA10).<br>
By this means, the control device 7 can determine the position in the X-axis<br>
direction and Y-axis direction of the aerial image (projected image) in the coordinate<br>
system defined by the laser interference system 2 (X, Y interferometers 2Px, 2Py), using<br>
the optical sensors 270 (aperture 273) provided at the first measurement region 275A and<br>
the second measurement region 275B.<br>
A prescribed positional relation is formed between the pattern on the mask M<br>
and the alignment marks, and the positional relation between the reference marks 272<br>
and apertures 273 (optical sensors) in the first measurement region 275A and the second<br>
measurement region 275B is also known. Based on the measurement results of step<br>
SA9 and the measurement results of step SA10, the control device 7 derives the relation<br>
between prescribed reference positions in the coordinate system defined by the laser<br>
interference system 2 and the position of the projected pattern of the mask M (step<br>
SA11).<br>
Based on the positional relation determined in step SA6 between the prescribed<br>
reference positions and each of the shot areas on the substrate P (array information for<br><br>
shot areas relative to prescribed reference positions) in the coordinate system defined by<br>
the laser interference system 2, and the relation determined in step SA11 between<br>
prescribed reference positions and the projected position of the pattern of the mask M in<br>
the coordinate system defined by the laser interference system 2, the control device 7<br>
derives the relation between each of the shot areas on the substrate P and the projected<br>
position of the pattern of the mask M in the coordinate system defined by the laser<br>
interference system 2 (step SA12).<br>
And, based on the approximate plane for the surface of the substrate P<br>
determined in step SA8 and values measured by the Z interferometer 2Pz associated with<br>
the image plane formed in the wet state, the control device 7 controls the second driving<br>
system PD2 to adjust the position of the surface of the substrate P (the exposure surface),<br>
while controlling the position in the X-axis, Y-axis, and 0Z directions of the substrate P,<br>
by controlling the first driving system PD1 based on the relation between each of the shot<br>
areas on the substrate P and the projected position of the pattern of the mask M<br>
determined in step SA12, to successively expose the plurality of shot areas on the<br>
substrate P (step SA13).<br>
After liquid immersion exposure processing of the substrate P on the second<br>
substrate stage 5 has ended, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 at<br>
the exposure station ST1 to the measurement station ST2. In parallel with this, the first<br>
substrate stage 4, holding a substrate P for which measurement processing at the<br>
exposure station ST1 has ended, is moved to the exposure station STL The transport<br>
system H unloads the substrate P for which exposure processing has ended, and which is<br>
being held by the second substrate stage 5, which has moved to the measurement station<br>
ST2.<br>
In this way, the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 are sent to<br><br>
the exposure station ST1 in alternation, and a plurality of substrates P are exposed<br>
successively.<br>
A focus/leveling detection system may be provided at the exposure station ST1<br>
also, and in the above-described step SA8, the positional relation between the image<br>
plane formed in the wet state and the reference surface 271 may be detected using this<br>
focus/leveling detection system, to determine the relation between the value measured by<br>
the Z interferometer 2Pz, the image plane formed in the wet state, and the reference<br>
surface 271. Or, in step SA8, while using the Z interferometer 2Pz to measure the<br>
position of the second substrate stage 5 (second substrate table 5T), the optical sensor<br>
270 at the first measurement region 275 A may be used to detect the position of the image<br>
plane formed in the wet state, to determine the relation between the value measured by<br>
the Z interferometer 2Pz, the image plane formed in the wet state, and the reference<br>
surface 271.<br>
Furthermore, the optical sensors 270 provided at the measurement regions 275<br>
of the second substrate stage 5 can perform measurements relating to the exposure light<br>
EL in the wet state. The control device 7 irradiates the optical sensors 270 with<br>
exposure light EL via the projection optical system PL and liquid LQ. When for<br>
example the illuminance, illuminance unevenness, and similar of the exposure light can<br>
be measured, the control device 7 can perform adjustments of the irradiation state of<br>
exposure light EL based on measurement results of the optical sensors 270.<br>
Next, a method of exposure of substrates P using an exposure apparatus EX with<br>
the above-described configuration is explained, for the case of a sequence using a cap<br>
member 30 in particular, referring to the plane views of FIG. 57 to FIG. 69, and to FIG. 70<br>
to FIG. 77.<br>
As shown in FIG. 57 and FIG. 70, in the first area SP1 of the exposure station<br><br>
ST1, a substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4 is subjected to liquid immersion<br>
exposure. At the measurement station ST2, measurement processing and similar are<br>
performed for the second substrate stage 5 holding a substrate P.<br>
The control device 7 uses a liquid immersion system 1 to fill the optical path<br>
space K between the projection optical system FL and the substrate P held by the first<br>
substrate stage 4 with liquid LQ, and performs exposure of the substrate P. During<br>
exposure of the substrate P, the liquid immersion system 1 can supply and recovery liquid<br>
LQ to and from a space comprising the optical path space K between the final optical<br>
element FL and substrate P, via the flow path 213. If the space comprising the optical<br>
path space K between the final optical element FL and the substrate P is filled with liquid<br>
LQ, then during exposure of the substrate P, the liquid immersion system 1 may halt the<br>
supply and recovery of liquid LQ.<br>
As shown in FIG. 57 and FIG. 70, during exposure of the substrate P held by the<br>
substrate holder 4H of the first substrate stage 4, the cap member 30 is held in the first<br>
cap holder 4C provided at the first corner El on the first substrate stage 4.<br>
As shown in FIG. 58 and FIG. 71, after liquid immersion exposure of the<br>
substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 has ended, the control device 7 moves the first<br>
substrate stage 4 in XY directions relative to the final optical element FL and seal<br>
member 212, in order to move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ, formed on<br>
the substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H of the first substrate stage 4, into the cap<br>
member 30 held by the first cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4. With the space<br>
between the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL and the first<br>
substrate stage 4 holding liquid LQ, the control device 7 uses the substrate stage driving<br>
device PD to move the first substrate stage 4 in XY directions such that the cap member<br>
30 held by the first cap holder 4C opposes the final optical element FL. By this means,<br><br>
the control device 7 can move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ, formed on<br>
the substrate P, onto the cap member 30 held by the first cap holder 4C.<br>
The area of the upper surface of the cap member 30 is set to be substantially<br>
larger than the area of the liquid immersion region LR as defined by the gas bearing<br>
mechanism of the seal member 212. Hence the liquid immersion region LR can be<br>
stably maintained on the upper surface of the cap member 30, without running out from<br>
the upper surface of the cap member 30.<br>
The upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the first cap holder 4C, the<br>
upper surface of the substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H of the first substrate stage<br>
4, and the upper surface 4F of the first substrate stage 4 are substantially flush. The<br>
control device uses the liquid immersion system 1 to perform supply and recovery of<br>
liquid LQ in parallel via the flow path 213 while moving the first substrate stage 4 in XY<br>
directions in a prescribed area comprising the position opposing the final optical element<br>
FL, and by this means can smoothly move the liquid immersion region LR formed on the<br>
substrate P to above the cap member 30.<br>
When the liquid immersion region LR formed on the substrate P is moved onto<br>
the cap member 30, the operations of supplying and recovering liquid LQ by the liquid<br>
immersion system 1 may be halted.<br>
As explained above, the seal member 212 can form a gas bearing 220 between<br>
the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the surface of the substrate P. By<br>
opposing the seal member 212 and the cap member 30, a gas bearing 220 can be formed<br>
between the seal member 212 and the cap member 30. As shown in FIG. 71, a<br>
prescribed gap G is formed between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the<br>
upper surface of the cap member 30.<br>
Next, the control device 7 releases the holding of the cap member 30 by the first<br><br>
cap holder 4C. By this means, the first cap holder 4C can release the cap member 30.<br>
That is, a state is entered in which the cap member 30 is clamped to the lower surface of<br>
the seal member 12, with the gap G intervening. As shown in FIG. 72, with the gas<br>
bearing 220 formed between the upper surface of the cap member 30 and the lower<br>
surface of the seal member 212, the control device 7 moves the first substrate table 4T<br>
downward (in the -Z direction). A gas bearing 220 is formed between the lower surface<br>
of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of the cap member 30, and so, with the gap<br>
G maintained between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of<br>
the cap member 30, the cap member 30 can be held at the lower surface of the seal<br>
member 212.<br>
The seal member 212 can hold the cap member 30 such that the cap member 30<br>
and the final optical element FL are opposed. The cap member 30 held by the seal<br>
member 212 is released from the first cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4 by<br>
moving the first substrate table 4T downward (in the -Z direction). The cap member 30<br>
is released from the first substrate stage 4, and the cap member 30 held by the seal<br>
member 212 can hold liquid LQ between the seal member 212 and the final optical<br>
element FL.<br>
With the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, after the upper surface of<br>
the first substrate table 4T has moved downward below the lower surface of the cap<br>
member 30 (in the -Z direction), the control device 7 horizontally moves the first<br>
substrate stage 4 from the first area SP1 comprising the position opposing the final<br>
optical element FL toward the third area SP3, as shown in FIG. 73.<br>
In this way, when both the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5<br>
have withdrawn from the first area SP1, the seal member 212 holds the cap member 30<br>
so as to be opposed to the final optical element FL.<br><br>
The cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 can hold liquid LQ up to the<br>
final optical element FL, and when the seal member 221 is holding the cap member 30,<br>
the liquid immersion system 1 can fill the space comprising the optical path space K<br>
between the final optical element FL and cap member 30 with liquid LQ. For example,<br>
when the seal member 212 is holding the cap member 30, the liquid immersion system 1<br>
can supply and recover liquid LQ to and from the space comprising the optical path<br>
space K between the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 and the final optical<br>
element FL, via the flow path 213. Because the seal member 212 forms a gas bearing<br>
220, gas is introduced via the gas inlet 15 and gas is evacuated via the gas outlet 214, so<br>
that a gas seal 216 can be formed to confine the liquid LQ between the lower surface of<br>
the seal member 212 and the surface of the cap member 30. If liquid LQ fills the space<br>
comprising the optical path space K between the cap member 30 held by the seal member<br>
212 and the final optical element FL, then the liquid immersion system 1 may halt the<br>
supply and recovery of liquid LQ.<br>
Next, the control device 7 uses the laser interference system 2 to measure the<br>
positions of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, while controlling the substrate<br>
stage driving device PD to move both the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate<br>
stage 5 to the third area SP3, as shown in FIG. 59. In this embodiment, the first<br>
substrate stage 4, having moved from the first area SP1 to the third area SP3, is<br>
positioned on the -X part area of the third area SP3 in the figure, and the second substrate<br>
stage 5, having moved from the second area SP2 to the third area SP3, is positioned on<br>
the +X part area of the third area SP3 in the figure. When the first substrate stage 4<br>
moves from the first area SP1 to the third area SP3, movement is along the path indicated<br>
by the arrow Rla in FIG. 59; and when the second substrate stage 5 moves from the<br>
second area SP2 to the third area SP3, movement is along the path indicated by the arrow<br><br>
Rib in FIG. 59.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 60, in the third area SP3 the connection of the joint<br>
member 96 of the slider 86 and the first joint member 241 of the first substrate stage 4,<br>
and the connection of the joint member 98 of the slider 88 and the fourth joint member<br>
252 of the second substrate stage 5, are released. The first substrate stage 4 is<br>
connected to the slider 88 of the linear motor 81 via the second joint member 242 and the<br>
joint member 98, and in addition the second substrate stage 5 is connected to the slider<br>
86 of the linear motor 80 via the third joint member 51 and the joint member 96.<br>
Thus in the third area SP3, the slider 86 of the linear motor 80 which had been<br>
connected to the first substrate stage 4 is connected to the second substrate stage 5, and<br>
the slider 88 of the linear motor 81 which had been connected to the second substrate<br>
stage 5 is connected to the first substrate stage 4.<br>
In the following description, an operation to release the connection of the slider<br>
86 with the substrate stage 4 (or 5), release the connection of the slider 88 with the<br>
substrate stage 5 (or 4), connect the slider 86 with the substrate stage 5 (or 4), and<br>
connect the slider 88 to the substrate stage 4 (or 5), is called a switching operation of two<br>
substrate stages and two sliders.<br>
Next, the control device 7 controls the substrate stage driving device PD to<br>
move the second substrate stage 5 to the first area SP1 of the exposure station ST1, and<br>
moves the first substrate stage 4 to the second area SP2 of the measurement station ST2.<br>
When the first substrate stage 4 moves from the third area SP3 to the second area SP2,<br>
movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rlc in FIG. 60. When the second<br>
substrate stage 5 moves from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1, movement is along<br>
the path indicated by the arrow Rid in FIG. 60.<br>
At this time, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 from the<br><br>
third area SP3 to the first area SP1, such that the cap member 30 held by the seal member<br>
212 is opposed to the second cap holder 5C provided on the second substrate stage 5.<br>
Here, as shown in FIG. 60, among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper<br>
surface 5F of the second substrate stage 5 (substrate table 5T), the second cap holder 5C<br>
of the second substrate stage 5 is positioned at the first corner El closest to the final<br>
optical element FL when the second substrate stage 5 is positioned in the third area SP3.<br>
Specifically, when the second substrate stage 5 holding an unexposed substrate P is<br>
positioned in the +X part area of the third area SP3, the second cap holder 5C is<br>
positioned at the first corner El closest to the position directly below the final optical<br>
element FL (the position directly below the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212)<br>
in the first area SP1 among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper surface<br>
5F of the substrate table 5T.<br>
Even when, prior to exposing the substrate P held by the second substrate stage<br>
5, the cap member 30 is released from the seal member 212 and is held by the second cap<br>
holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5, when the second substrate stage 5 is positioned<br>
in the third area SP3, by positioning the second cap holder 5C on the second substrate<br>
stage 5 at the first corner El closest to the final optical element FL among the first<br>
through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper surface 5F, the distance of movement when<br>
the second substrate stage 5 moves from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order<br>
that the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 is opposed to the second cap holder<br>
5C can be shortened. That is, the second cap holder 5C is provided at a prescribed<br>
position of the second substrate stage 5, such that when the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
moved from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to have the second cap<br>
holder 5C hold the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, the distance of<br>
movement of the second substrate stage 5 is shortened.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 61, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5<br>
such that the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 is opposed to the second cap<br>
holder 5C on the second substrate stage 5. When the second cap holder 5C is<br>
positioned below the cap member 30, the control device 7 moves the second substrate<br>
stage 5 in horizontal directions with the second substrate table 5T lowered a prescribed<br>
distance in the -Z direction relative to the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212,<br>
in order that the seal member 212 and/or the cap member 30 held by the seal member<br>
212 does not strike the second substrate stage 5.<br>
As described above, the second cap holder 5C is provided at a prescribed<br>
position of the second substrate stage 5 such that the distance of movement of the second<br>
substrate stage 5 when the second substrate stage 5 moves from the third area SP3 to the<br>
first area SP1 is shortened; hence as shown in FIG. 75, the second cap holder 5C of the<br>
second substrate stage 5 can be positioned under the cap member 30 held by the seal<br>
member 212 in a short time.<br>
The control device 7 adjusts the positional relation in the Z-axis direction of the<br>
cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 and the second cap holder 5C on the second<br>
substrate stage 5, and places the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 on the<br>
second cap holder 5C. Specifically, the control device 7 controls the second driving<br>
system PD2 to move the second substrate table 5T upward (in the +Z direction), causing<br>
the lower surface of the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 to make contact<br>
with the upper surface of the second cap holder 5C. At this time, position information<br>
in the XY directions for the second substrate table 5T is measured by the laser<br>
interference system 2, and position information in the Z-axis direction is measured by the<br>
measurement device of the second driving system PD2. The control device 7 can<br>
execute control such that the cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5 is positioned<br><br>
at the desired position relative to the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212.<br>
After bringing the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 into contact with<br>
the second cap holder 5C, the control device 7 controls the vacuum system connected to<br>
the suction aperture 263 of the second cap holder 5C, and vacuum-clamps the cap<br>
member 30 with the second cap holder 5C. By this means, as shown in FIG. 61 and FIG.<br>
76, a liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ is formed above the cap member 30 held<br>
by the second cap holder 5C. Furthermore, a gas bearing 220 is formed between the<br>
lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of the cap member 30, and a<br>
gap G is maintained between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper<br>
surface of the cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C.<br>
As shown in FIG. 62, the control device 7 moves the liquid immersion region<br>
LR of liquid LQ, formed above the cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C,<br>
from above the cap member 30 to the first measurement region 275A of the second<br>
substrate stage 5. In this way, the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 is<br>
released from the seal member 212 before initiation of exposure of the substrate P held<br>
by the second substrate stage 5, and is held by the second cap holder 5C positioned on<br>
the second substrate stage 5.<br>
In order to move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed above the<br>
cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C onto the first measurement region<br>
275Aof the second substrate stage 5, the control device 7 moves the second substrate<br>
stage 5 in XY directions relative to the final optical element FL and seal member 212.<br>
With liquid LQ held between the final optical element FL of the projection optical system<br>
PL and the second substrate stage 5, the control device 7 uses the substrate stage driving<br>
device PD to move the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions, such that the first<br>
measurement region 275A on the second substrate stage 5 is opposed to the final optical<br><br>
element FL. By this means, the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed above<br>
the cap member 30 can be moved onto the first measurement region 275 A on the second<br>
substrate stage 5.<br>
Here, after holding the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 with the<br>
second cap holder 5C of the second substrate stage 5, when the control device 7 moves<br>
the liquid immersion region LR on the cap member 30 onto the first measurement region<br>
275A, the liquid LQ in the liquid immersion region LR moves relative to the liquid<br>
immersion region LR and the second substrate stage 5 so as not to make contact with the<br>
substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5. With the liquid immersion region LR<br>
of liquid LQ formed above the first measurement region 275 A, the control device 7 uses<br>
the first measurement region 275A to for example perform prescribed measurements to<br>
acquire alignment information, as explained referring to the flowchart of FIG. 56.<br>
After measurements using the first measurement region 275A have ended, the<br>
control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions relative to the final<br>
optical element FL and seal member 212, in order to move the liquid immersion region<br>
LR of liquid LQ formed above the first measurement region 275 A of the second substrate<br>
stage 5 onto the second measurement region 275B of the second substrate stage 5, as<br>
shown in FIG. 63. With liquid LQ held between the final optical element FL of the<br>
projection optical system PL and the second substrate stage 5, the control device 7 uses<br>
the substrate stage driving device PD to move the second substrate stage 5 in XY<br>
directions such that the second measurement region 275B on the second substrate stage 5<br>
and the final optical element FL are opposed. By this means, the control device 7 can<br>
move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed in the first measurement<br>
region 275A onto the second measurement region 275B.<br>
When moving the liquid immersion region LR above the first measurement<br><br>
region 275A to the second measurement region 275B also, the control device 7 moves<br>
the second substrate stage 5 relative to the liquid immersion region LR such that the<br>
liquid LQ of the liquid immersion region LR does not make contact with the substrate P<br>
held by the second substrate stage 5. And, with the liquid immersion region LR of<br>
liquid LQ formed above the second measurement region 275B, the control device 7 uses<br>
the second measurement region 275B to perform prescribed measurements to for<br>
example acquire alignment information, as explained referring to FIG. 56.<br>
After the end of measurements using the second measurement region 275B, the<br>
control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions relative to the final<br>
optical element FL and seal member 212 as shown in FIG. 64, in order to move the liquid<br>
immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed above the second measurement region 275B<br>
of the second substrate stage 5 over the substrate P held by the substrate holder 5H of the<br>
second substrate stage 5. With liquid LQ held between the final optical element FL of<br>
the projection optical system PL and the second substrate stage 5, the control device 7<br>
uses the substrate stage driving system PD to move the second substrate stage 5 in XY<br>
directions such that the substrate P on the second substrate stage 5 and the final optical<br>
element FL are opposed. By this means, as shown in FIG. 64 and FIG. 77, the control<br>
device 7 can move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed on the second<br>
measurement region 275B on the second substrate stage 5 onto the substrate P.<br>
As described referring to the flowchart of FIG. 56, while adjusting the position<br>
of the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5 based on the measurement results<br>
at the measurement station ST2 and the measurement results using the first and second<br>
measurement regions 275A, 275B at the exposure station ST1, the control device 7<br>
exposes the substrate P via the projection optical system PL and liquid LQ. A plurality<br>
of shot areas are set on the substrate P; after forming a liquid immersion region LR on<br><br>
the second measurement region 275B and performing prescribed measurements, the<br>
control device 7 initiates exposure from a shot area close to the second measurement<br>
region 275A among the plurality of shot areas on the substrate P, as shown in FIG. 64.<br>
During exposure of the substrate P held by the substrate holder 5H of the second<br>
substrate stage 5, the second cap holder 5C provided in the first corner El on the second<br>
substrate stage 5 holds the cap member 30. Also, when the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
positioned in the first area SP1, the first substrate stage 4 is at the second area SP2 of the<br>
measurement station ST2 comprising the substrate exchange position RP, and<br>
measurement processing, substrate exchange processing, and other prescribed processing<br>
are performed.<br>
The control device 7 successively exposes the plurality of shot areas set on the<br>
substrate P. And, as shown in FIG. 65, when the plurality of shot areas on the substrate<br>
P held by the second substrate stage 5 are successively exposed, the control device 7 ends<br>
exposure at a shot area close to the second cap holder 5C among the plurality of shot<br>
areas, as shown in FIG. 65.<br>
As shown in FIG. 66, after liquid immersion exposure of the plurality of shot<br>
areas on the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5 has ended, the control device<br>
7 moves the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions relative to the final optical element<br>
FL and seal member 212, in order to move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ<br>
formed on the substrate P held by the substrate holder 5H onto the cap member 30 held<br>
by the second cap holder 5C. The control device 7 uses the substrate stage driving<br>
device PD to move the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions, such that, with liquid<br>
LQ held between the final optical element FL of the projection optical system PL and the<br>
second substrate stage 5, the cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C is opposed<br>
to the final optical element FL. By this means, the liquid immersion region LR of liquid<br><br>
LQ formed on the substrate P can be moved onto the cap member 30 held by the second<br>
cap holder 5C.<br>
Next, the control device 7 releases the holding of the cap member 30 by the<br>
second cap holder 5C. By this means, the second cap holder 5C can release the cap<br>
member 30. With a gas bearing 220 formed between the upper surface of the cap<br>
member 30 and the lower surface of the seal member 212, the second substrate table 5T<br>
is lowered a prescribed distance in the -Z direction, similarly to the operation of the first<br>
substrate stage 4 explained referring to FIG. 72 and FIG. 73, and after release of the cap<br>
member 30 from the upper surface of the cap holder 5C, the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
moved from the first area SP1 toward the third area SP3. A gas bearing 220 is formed<br>
between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of the cap<br>
member 30. With the gap G maintained between the lower surface of the seal member<br>
212 and the upper surface of the cap member 30, the cap member 30 can be held at the<br>
lower surface of the seal member 212.<br>
In this way, the cap member 30 held by the second cap holder 5C is released<br>
from the second cap holder 5C, and is held by the seal member 212 so as to oppose the<br>
final optical element FL.<br>
Next, the control device 7 uses the laser interference system 2 to measure the<br>
positions of the first and second substrate stage 4, 5, while controlling the substrate stage<br>
driving PD to move the first substrate stage 4 and second substrate stage 5 to the third<br>
area SP3, as shown in FIG. 67. In this embodiment, the second substrate stage 5, having<br>
moved from the first area SP1 to the third area SP3, is positioned in the -X part area of<br>
the third area SP3, as in the figure. The first substrate stage 4, having moved from the<br>
first area SP1 to the third area SP3, is positioned in the +X part area of the third area SP3,<br>
as in the figure. When the second substrate stage 5 moves from the first area SP1 to the<br><br>
third area SP3, movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rla in FIG. 67, and<br>
when the first substrate stage 4 moves from the second area SP2 to the third area SP3,<br>
movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rib in FIG. 67.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 68, a switching operation of the two substrate stages 4, 5<br>
with the two sliders 86, 88 is performed in the third area SP3. That is, the second<br>
substrate stage 5 is connected to the slider 88 of the linear motor 81, and the first<br>
substrate stage 4 is connected to the slider 86 of the linear motor 80.<br>
The control device 7 controls the substrate stage driving device PD to move the<br>
first substrate stage 4 to the first area SP1 of the exposure station ST1, and to move the<br>
second substrate stage 5 to the second area SP2 of the measurement station ST2. When<br>
the second substrate stage 5 moves from the third area SP3 to the second area SP2,<br>
movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rlc in FIG. 68; and when the first<br>
substrate stage 4 moves from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1, movement is along<br>
the path indicated by the arrow Rid in FIG. 68.<br>
The control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 from the third area SP3 to<br>
the first area SP1 such that the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 and the first<br>
cap holder 4C provided on the first substrate stage 4 are opposed. Here, as shown in<br>
FIG. 68, among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper surface 4F of the<br>
first substrate stage 4 (substrate table 4T), when the first substrate stage 4 is positioned in<br>
the third area SP3, the first cap holder 4C is positioned at the first corner El closest to the<br>
final optical element FL. Specifically, when the first substrate stage 4 holding an<br>
unexposed substrate P is positioned in the +X part area of the third area SP3, the first cap<br>
holder 4C is positioned at the first corner El closest to the position directly below the<br>
final optical element FL in the first area SP1 (the position directly below the cap member<br>
30 held by the seal member 212), among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the<br><br>
upper surface of the substrate table 4T.<br>
In this way, when the first substrate stage 4 is positioned in the third area SP3,<br>
the first cap holder 4C is positioned at the first corner El closest to the final optical<br>
element FL among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper surface 4F, so<br>
that the movement distance when the first substrate stage 4 is moved from the third area<br>
SP3 to the first area SP1 in order that the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 is<br>
opposed to the first cap holder 4C can be shortened. That is, the first cap holder 4C is<br>
provided at a prescribed position on the first substrate stage 4 in order to shorten the<br>
movement distance of the first substrate stage 4 when the first substrate stage 4 is moved<br>
from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to cause the first cap holder 4C to<br>
hold the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212.<br>
As shown in FIG. 69, the control device 7 opposes the lower surface of the cap<br>
member 30 held by the seal member 212 and the first cap holder 4C on the first substrate<br>
stage 4. The first cap holder 4C is provided on the first substrate stage 4 such that the<br>
movement distance of the first substrate stage 4 is shortened when moving the first<br>
substrate stage 4 from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to cause the first<br>
cap holder 4C to hold the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, and so the first<br>
cap holder 4C can be positioned below the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212<br>
in a short time.<br>
Next, similarly to the operation of the second substrate stage 5 explained<br>
referring to FIG. 75, the control device 7 moves the first substrate table 4T a prescribed<br>
distance in the +Z direction, and drives the vacuum system connected to the first cap<br>
holder 4C to hold the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212 to the upper<br>
surface of the first cap holder 4C. By this means, a liquid immersion region LR of<br>
liquid LQ is formed above the cap member 30 held by the first cap holder 4C.<br><br>
Then, the control device 7 uses the substrate stage driving device PD to move<br>
the first substrate stage 4 in XY directions such that the first measurement region 274A<br>
on the first substrate stage 4 is opposed to the final optical element FL, and releases the<br>
cap member 30 from the seal member 212, as well as moving the liquid immersion<br>
region LR of liquid LQ formed on the cap member 30 to the first measurement region<br>
274A on the first substrate stage 4. When the liquid immersion region LR on the cap<br>
member 30 is moved to the first measurement region 274A, the control device 7 moves<br>
the first substrate stage 4 relative to the liquid immersion region LR such that the liquid<br>
LQ in the liquid immersion region LR does not make contact with the substrate P held by<br>
the first substrate stage 4. Then, with the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ<br>
formed on the first measurement region 274A, the control device 7 performs prescribed<br>
measurements using the first measurement region 274A, similarly to the operation<br>
explained referring to the flowchart of FIG. 56.<br>
After measurements using the first measurement region 274A have ended, the<br>
control device 7 uses the substrate stage driving device PD to move the first substrate<br>
stage 4 in XY directions such that the second measurement region 274B on the first<br>
substrate stage 4 opposes the final optical element FL, and moves the liquid immersion<br>
region LR of liquid LQ formed on the first measurement region 274 A onto the second<br>
measurement region 274B on the first substrate stage 4. When the liquid immersion<br>
region LR on the first measurement region 274A is moved onto the second measurement<br>
region 274B, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 relative to the liquid<br>
immersion region LR such that the liquid LQ of the liquid immersion region LR does not<br>
make contact with the substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4. Then, with the<br>
liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed on the second measurement region<br>
274B, the control device 7 performs prescribed measurements using the second<br><br>
measurement region 274B, similarly to the operation explained referring to the flowchart<br>
of FIG. 56.<br>
After measurements using the second measurement region 274B have ended, the<br>
control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 in XY directions relative to the final<br>
optical element FL and seal member 212, in order to move the liquid immersion region<br>
LR of liquid LQ formed on the second measurement region 274B of the first substrate<br>
stage 4 onto the substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H of the first substrate stage 4.<br>
With liquid LQ held between the final optical element FL of the projection optical system<br>
PL and the first substrate stage 4, the control device 7 uses the substrate stage driving<br>
device PD to move the first substrate stage 4 in XY directions such that the substrate P on<br>
the first substrate stage 4 and the final optical element FL are opposed. By this means,<br>
the control device 7 can move the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed on<br>
the second measurement region 274B of the first substrate stage 4 onto the substrate P.<br>
Based on the measurement results at the measurement station ST2 and the<br>
measurement results using the first and second measurement regions 274A, 274B at the<br>
exposure station ST1, the control device 7 adjusts the position of the substrate P held by<br>
the first substrate stage 4, while exposing the substrate P via the projection optical system<br>
PL and liquid LQ. A plurality of shot areas are set on the substrate P; after forming the<br>
liquid immersion region LR on the second measurement region 274A and performing<br>
prescribed measurements, the control device 7 initiates exposure from a shot area close to<br>
the second measurement region 274B among the plurality of shot areas on the substrate<br>
P.<br>
The control device 7 successively exposes the plurality of shot areas set on the<br>
substrate P. And, when successively exposing the plurality of shot areas on the<br>
substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4, the control device 7 ends exposure at a<br><br>
short area close to the first cap holder 4C among the plurality of shot areas.<br>
Below, the processing explained referring to FIG. 57 through FIG. 77 is repeated.<br>
That is, the substrate stage 4 (or 5), for which prescribed processing has been performed<br>
in the second area SP2, and which is connected to the slider 88, is moved to the +X part<br>
area of the third area SP3 along the movement path indicated by the arrow Rib, after<br>
which the substrate stage is connected to the slider 86 in the third area SP3 and moved to<br>
the first area SP1 along the movement path indicated by the arrow Rid. Then, the<br>
substrate stage 4 (or 5), for which prescribed processing has been performed in the first<br>
area SP1, and which is connected to the slider 86, is moved to the -X part area of the<br>
third area SP3 along the movement path indicated by the arrow Rla, after which the<br>
substrate stage is connected to the slider 88 in the third area SP3, and is moved to the<br>
second area SP2 along the movement path indicated by the arrow Rlc. The slider 86 is<br>
connected in alternation to the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, and moves between<br>
the first area SP1 and the third area SP3; the slider 88 is connected in alternation to the<br>
first and second substrate stages 4, 5, and moves between the second area SP2 and the<br>
third area SP3.<br>
In this embodiment, the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5<br>
move from the second area SP2 via the third area SP3 to the first area SP1, and from the<br>
first area SP1 via the third area SP3 to the second area SP2, over substantially the same<br>
paths. Specifically, the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 each move in clockwise<br>
fashion over the base member BP substantially parallel to the XY plane, as indicated by<br>
the arrows Rla to Rid, to move between the first area SP1 and the second area SP2.<br>
On such a movement path, the first cap holder 4C and the second cap holder 5C<br>
are in substantially the same position on the first and second substrate stages 4 and 5, that<br>
is, are provided at the first corner El, so that as shown schematically in FIG. 78, it is<br><br>
possible to shorten the movement distance to move the first and second substrate stages 4,<br>
5 to the third area SP3 from the first area SP1 in order to cause the cap member 30 held<br>
by the seal member 212 to be opposed to the first and second cap holders 4C, 5C.<br>
As described above, in this embodiment the first and second cap holders 4C, 5C<br>
are provided at prescribed positions on the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 such that<br>
the movement distance of the substrate stages 4, 5 is shortened when moving the first and<br>
second substrate stages 4, 5 from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to cause<br>
the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 to be held by the first or second cap<br>
holder 4C, 5C. Consequently, the time required to pass the cap member 30 held by the<br>
seal member 212 from the seal member 212 to the first or second cap holder 4C, 5C can<br>
be shortened. Hence exposure of the next substrate P can be initiated in a short time<br>
after performing the switching operation of the two substrate stages 4, 5 with the two<br>
sliders 86, 88 in the third area SP3. As a result, reductions in throughput (the<br>
availability factor of the exposure apparatus EX) can be suppressed, and substrates P can<br>
be exposed efficiently.<br>
Thus in this embodiment, prior to exposing the substrate P held by the substrate<br>
stage 4 (5), after holding the cap member 30 with the cap holder 4C (5C) positioned on<br>
the substrate stage 4 (5), the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 is released<br>
from the seal member 212, and when the liquid immersion region LR on the cap member<br>
30 is moved to the first and second measurement regions 274A, 274B (275A, 275B), the<br>
liquid immersion region LR and substrate stage 4 (5) are moved relative to each other in<br>
order that the liquid LQ of the liquid immersion region LR does not come into contact<br>
with the substrate P held by the substrate stage 4 (5). That is, the liquid immersion<br>
region LR formed on the image-plane side of the projection optical system PL moves<br>
along the path indicated by the arrow RL in the schematic diagram of FIG. 79. When<br><br>
the substrate P and liquid LQ make contact, for example the properties of the film of<br>
photosensitive material formed on the substrate P and/or the properties of a topcoat film<br>
formed thereupon may change, or a prescribed substance may be eluted from the film<br>
into the liquid LQ, or other problems may arise. Hence prior to exposure of the<br>
substrate P, it is desirable that contact between the substrate P and liquid LQ be avoided<br>
insofar as possible. In this embodiment, as shown in the schematic diagram of FIG. 79,<br>
while the liquid immersion region LR on the cap member 30 held by the cap holder 4C<br>
(5C) is moved onto the measurement regions 274 (275), the substrate stage 4 (5)<br>
movement is controlled such that the liquid LQ of the liquid immersion region LR does<br>
not make contact with the substrate P held by the substrate stage 4 (5), that is, such that<br>
the liquid immersion region LR passes over the upper surface 4F (5F) of the substrate<br>
stage 4 (5), and so occurrence of the above-described problems can be avoided.<br>
In this embodiment, when successively exposing the plurality of shot areas set<br>
on a substrate P, after a liquid immersion region LR is formed on the second<br>
measurement region 274B (275B) and prescribed measurements are performed, exposure<br>
is initiated from a shot area close to the second measurement region 274B (275B) among<br>
the plurality of shot areas, so that after the end of measurements, exposure of the<br>
substrate can be begun immediately. Hence throughput can be improved.<br>
For example, as shown in the schematic diagram of FIG. 79, the distance<br>
between the shot area Ss first exposed among the plurality of shot areas on the substrate P<br>
held by the substrate stage 4 (5) and the measurement regions 274 (275) can be set to be<br>
shorter than the distance between the center of the substrate P and the measurement<br>
regions 274 (275), so that after the end of a measurement operation using the<br>
measurement regions 274 (275), exposure of the first shot area can be performed<br>
immediately.	„<br>
13!<br><br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, when successively exposing a plurality of shot<br>
areas set on a substrate P, exposure ends at a shot area close to the cap holder 4C (5C)<br>
among the plurality of shot areas, so that after the end of exposure of the substrate P, the<br>
liquid immersion region LR can immediately be moved onto the cap member 30, and the<br>
operation of holding the cap member 30 with the seal member 212 can be executed.<br>
Hence throughput can be improved.<br>
For example, as shown in the schematic diagram of FIG. 79, by setting the<br>
distance between the shot area Se which is to be exposed last among the plurality of shot<br>
areas on the substrate P held by the substrate stage 4 (5) and the cap holder 4C (5C) to be<br>
shorter than the distance between the center of the substrate P and the cap holder 4C (5C),<br>
after exposure of the substrate P, the liquid immersion region LR can immediately be<br>
moved onto the cap member 30.<br>
In this embodiment, when either one of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5<br>
is positioned in the first area SP1, liquid LQ can be held between the final optical<br>
element FL and the first or second substrate stage 4, 5. When the first substrate stage 4<br>
and the second substrate stage 5 have withdrawn from the first area SP1, liquid LQ can<br>
be held between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30. Thus in this<br>
embodiment, the space comprising the optical path space K on the light emission side of<br>
the final optical element FL can continue to be filled with liquid LQ. Hence drying of<br>
the final optical element FL can be prevented, and the formation of tracks of liquid LQ<br>
(in this embodiment, watermarks) on the final optical element FL and similar can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 moves on<br>
the base member BP in a clockwise manner between the first area SP1 and the second<br>
area SP2; but movement may also be in the counterclockwise direction. In this case, the<br><br>
first cap holder 4C is provided in the fourth corner E4 on the first substrate stage 4, and<br>
the second cap holder 5C is provided in the fourth corner E4 on the second substrate<br>
stage 5.<br>
Next, an 11th embodiment is explained. . In the 11th embodiment, a<br>
characteristic portion different from the tenth embodiment is the fact that the first<br>
substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 move from the second area SP2 to the<br>
first area SP1 by different paths, and that the first cap holder 4C and the second cap<br>
holder 5C are provided in different positions on the first and second substrate stages 4, 5.<br>
In the following description, components the same as or similar to those of the tenth<br>
embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is<br>
simplified or omitted.<br>
In FIG. 80, liquid immersion exposure of a substrate P held by the first substrate<br>
stage 4 is performed in the first area SP1 of the exposure station ST1. At the<br>
measurement station ST2, measurement processing and similar is performed for the<br>
second substrate stage 5 holding a substrate P. The first cap holder 4C is positioned at<br>
the fourth corner E4 on the upper surface of the first substrate stage 4. The second cap<br>
holder 5C is positioned at the first corner El on the upper surface 5F of the second<br>
substrate stage 5.<br>
After the end of liquid immersion exposure of the substrate P on the first<br>
substrate stage 4, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 such that the final<br>
optical element FL and the cap member 30 held by the first cap holder 4C are opposed,<br>
and moves the liquid immersion region LR of liquid LQ formed above the substrate P<br>
held by the substrate holder 4H of the first substrate stage 4 onto the cap member 30.<br>
Then, the control device 7 releases the cap member 30 from the first cap holder 4C, and,<br><br>
with the final optical element FL and cap member 30 opposed, holds the cap member 30<br>
with the seal member 212.<br>
Next, the control device 7 uses the laser interference system 2 to measure the<br>
positions of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 while controlling the substrate stage<br>
driving device PD to move the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 to<br>
the third area SP3, as shown in FIG. 81. In this embodiment, upon moving from the<br>
first area SP1 to the third area SP3 the first substrate stage 4 is positioned in the -X part<br>
area of the third area SP3 in the figure, and upon moving from the second area SP2 to the<br>
third area SP3, the second substrate stage 5 is positioned in the +X part area of the third<br>
area SP3 in the figure. That is, when the first substrate stage 4 moves from the first area<br>
SP1 to the third area SP3, movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rla in FIG.<br>
81, and when the second substrate stage 5 moves from the second area SP2 to the third<br>
area SP3, movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rib in FIG. 81.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 82, the control device 7 performs a switching operation<br>
of the two substrate stages 4, 5 with the two sliders 86, 88 in the third area SP3.<br>
The control device 7 controls the substrate stage driving device PD to move the<br>
second substrate stage 5 to the first area SP1 of the exposure station ST1, and to move<br>
the first substrate stage 4 to the second area SP2 of the measurement station ST2. When<br>
the first substrate stage 4 moves from the third area SP3 to the second area SP2,<br>
movement is along the path indicated by the arrow Rlc in FIG. 82, and when the second<br>
substrate stage 5 moves from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1, movement is along<br>
the path indicated by the arrow Rid in FIG. 82.<br>
As shown in FIG. 83, the control device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5<br>
such that the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 is opposed to the cap holder<br>
5C provided on the second substrate stage 5. As shown in FIG. 82, the second cap<br><br>
holder 5C on the second substrate stage 5 is positioned in the first corner El, among the<br>
first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper surface 5F of the second substrate stage<br>
5 (substrate table 5T), which is closest to the final optical element FL when the second<br>
substrate stage 5 is positioned in the third area SP3. Hence the movement distance can<br>
be shortened when moving the second substrate stage 5 from the third area SP3 to the<br>
first area SP1 to cause the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 to be held by the<br>
second cap holder 5C.<br>
Prior to exposure of the substrate P held by the second substrate stage 5, after<br>
holding the cap member 30 with the second cap holder 5C on the second substrate stage<br>
5, the cap member 30 is released from the substrate stage 212 by the control device 7.<br>
That is, after holding the cap member 30 with the second cap holder 5C, the control<br>
device 7 moves the second substrate stage 5 in XY directions, and executes prescribed<br>
measurement processing similar to that in the tenth embodiment at the measurement<br>
regions 275 (275A, 275B) positioned to enable opposition to the final optical element FL<br>
above the second substrate stage 5. After the end of measurement processing and<br>
similar, the control device 7 successively exposes the plurality of shot areas set on the<br>
substrate P. When successively exposing the plurality of shot areas set on the substrate<br>
P, similarly to the above-described tenth embodiment, the control device 7 initiates<br>
exposure from the first shot area close to the second measurement region 275B, and ends<br>
exposure at the last shot area close to the second cap holder 5C. After the end of<br>
exposure of the plurality of shot areas on the substrate P, the control device 7 moves the<br>
second substrate stage 5 such that the final optical element FL and the second cap holder<br>
5C are opposed, and releases the cap member 30 from the second cap holder 5C, and in<br>
addition holds the cap member 30 with the seal member 212 such that the final optical<br>
element FL and cap member 30 are opposed.<br><br>
Next, the control device 7 uses the laser interference system 2 to measure the<br>
positions of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, while controlling the substrate<br>
stage driving device PD to move the first substrate stage 4 and the second substrate stage<br>
5 to the third area SP3, as shown in FIG. 84. In this embodiment, upon moving from the<br>
first area SP1 to the third area SP3, the second substrate stage 5 is positioned in the +X<br>
part area of the third area SP3 in the figure, and upon moving from the second area SP2<br>
to the third area SP3, the first substrate stage 4 is positioned in the -X part area of the<br>
third area SP3 in the figure. When the second substrate stage 5 moves from the first<br>
area SP1 to the third area SP3, movement is along the path indicated by the arrow R2d in<br>
FIG. 84, and when the first substrate stage 4 moves from the second area SP2 to the third<br>
area SP3, movement is along the path indicated by the arrow R2c in FIG. 84.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 85, the control device 7 performs a switching operation<br>
of the two substrate stages 4, 5 with the two sliders 86, 88 in the third area SP3.<br>
Then, the control device 7 controls the substrate stage driving device PD to<br>
move the first substrate stage 4 to the first area SP1 of the exposure station ST1 and to<br>
move the second substrate stage 5 to the second area SP2 of the measurement station ST2.<br>
When the first substrate stage 4 moves from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1,<br>
movement is along the path indicated by the arrow R2a in FIG. 85, and when the second<br>
substrate stage 5 moves from the third area SP3 to the second area SP2, movement is<br>
along the path indicated by the arrow R2b in FIG. 85.<br>
The control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 such that the cap member<br>
30 and the first cap holder 4C are opposed, as shown in FIG. 86, in order to hold the cap<br>
member 30 held by the seal member 212 with the first cap holder 4C provided on the<br>
first substrate stage 4. Here, as shown in FIG. 85, the cap holder 4C is positioned at the<br>
fourth corner E4, which among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper<br><br>
surface of the first substrate stage 4 (substrate table 4T) is the closest to the first area SP1<br>
when the first substrate stage 4 is positioned in the third area SP3. Hence the movement<br>
distance can be shortened when moving the first substrate stage 4 from the third area SP3<br>
to the first area SP1 in order to cause the first cap holder 4C to hold the cap member 30<br>
held by the seal member 212.<br>
Prior to exposure of the substrate P held by the first substrate stage 4, after<br>
holding the cap member 30 with the first cap holder 4C of the first substrate stage 4, the<br>
control device 7 releases the cap member 30 from the seal member 212. That is, the<br>
control device 7 holds the cap member 30 with the first cap holder 4C, and then moves<br>
the first substrate stage 4 in XY directions, and similarly to the tenth embodiment,<br>
executes prescribed measurement processing and similar in the measurement regions 274<br>
(274A, 274B) positioned opposably to the final optical element FL on the first substrate<br>
stage 4. After the end of the prescribed measurement processing and similar, the control<br>
device 7 successively exposes the plurality of shot areas set on the substrate P. When<br>
successively exposing the plurality of shot areas set on the substrate P, similarly to the<br>
process described above, the control device 7 initiates exposure from the first shot area<br>
close to the second measurement region 274B, and ends exposure at the last shot area<br>
close to the first cap holder 4C. After the end of exposure of the plurality of shot areas<br>
on the substrate P, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 such that the final<br>
optical element FL and first cap holder 4C are opposed, and releases the cap member 30<br>
from the first cap holder 4C, while also holding the cap member 30 with the seal member<br>
212 to enable opposition of the final optical element FL and cap member 30.<br>
Thereafter, the processing explained referring to FIG. 80 through FIG. 86 is<br>
repeated. That is, after prescribed processing at the second area SP2, the second<br>
substrate stage 5, while connected to the slider 88, moves to the +X part area of the third<br><br>
area SP3 along the movement path indicated by the arrow Rib, after which the second<br>
substrate stage 5 is connected to the slider 86 and moves to the first area SP1 along the<br>
movement path indicated by the arrow Rid. After prescribed processing at the first area<br>
SP1, the second substrate stage 5, while connected to the slider 86, moves to the +X part<br>
area of the third area SP3 along the movement path indicated by the arrow R2d, after<br>
which, in the third area SP3, the second substrate stage 5 is connected to the slider 88 and<br>
moves to the first area SP1 along the movement path indicated by the arrow R2b to the<br>
second area SP2.<br>
On the other hand, after prescribed processing at the second area SP2, the first<br>
substrate stage 4, while connected to the slider 88, moves to the -X part area of the third<br>
area SP3 along the movement path indicated by the arrow R2c, after which, in the third<br>
area SP3, the first substrate stage 4 is connected to the slider 86 and moves to the first<br>
area SP1 along the movement path indicated by the arrow R2a. After prescribed<br>
processing at the first area SP1, the first substrate stage 4, while connected to the slider<br>
86, moves to the -X part area of the third area SP3 along the movement path indicated by<br>
the arrow Rla, after which, in the third area SP3, the first substrate stage 4 is connected<br>
to the slider 88 and moves to the first area SP1 along the movement path indicated by the<br>
arrow Rlc to the second area SP2.<br>
Thus in this embodiment, the first substrate stage 4 is always positioned in<br>
the -X part area when being in the third area SP3, and the second substrate stage 5 is<br>
always positioned in the +X part area when being in the third area SP3. That is, in this<br>
embodiment the first substrate stage 4 and second substrate stage 5 move from the<br>
second area SP2 via the third area SP3 to the first area SP1, and from the first area SP1<br>
via the third area SP3 to the second area SP2, by different paths. The first substrate<br>
stage 4 and the second substrate stage 5 each move on the base member BP which is<br><br>
substantially parallel to the XY plane, moving between the first area SP1 and the second<br>
area SP2 in the clockwise direction, and moving between the first area SP1 and the<br>
second area SP2 in the counterclockwise direction.<br>
Given such movement paths, the first cap holder 4C and the second cap holder<br>
5C are provided at different positions on the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, that is,<br>
on the first substrate stage 4 the first cap holder 4C is provided at the fourth corner E4,<br>
while on the second substrate stage 5 the second cap holder 5C is provided at the first<br>
corner El, so that as indicated in the schematic diagram of FIG. 87, the movement<br>
distance can be shortened when the substrate stage 4 (5) is moved from the third area SP3<br>
to the first area SP1 in order that the cap holder 4C (5C) can hold the cap member 30<br>
being held by the seal member 212. By this means, the time from the switching<br>
operation of the two substrate stages 4, 5 with the two sliders 86, 88 in the third area SP3<br>
until exposure of the next substrate P is begun can be shortened, and reductions in<br>
throughput (the availability factor of the exposure apparatus EX) can be suppressed.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment also, after being held by the cap holder 4C<br>
(5C) positioned on the substrate stage 4 (5), the cap member 30 held by the seal member<br>
212 is released from the seal member 212, and when the liquid immersion region LR on<br>
the cap member 30 is moved to above the measurement regions 274 (275), the liquid<br>
immersion region LR and substrate stage 4 (5) can undergo relative motion such that the<br>
liquid LQ of the liquid immersion region LR does not make contact with the substrate P<br>
held by the substrate stage 4 (5).<br>
When a non-effective area of prescribed width is defined along the periphery of<br>
the substrate P, contact between the non-effective area of the substrate P and liquid LQ of<br>
the liquid immersion region LR may be allowed, deeming that there has been no contact<br>
between the liquid LQ of the liquid immersion region LR and the substrate P.<br><br>
The movement paths of the first and second substrate stages 4, 5, and the<br>
positioning of the first and second cap holders 4C, 5C on the first and second substrate<br>
stages 4, 5 explained in the above tenth and 11th embodiments, are merely examples, and<br>
other configurations are possible. The position of the first cap holder 4C on the first<br>
substrate stage 4 and the position of the second cap holder 5C on the second substrate<br>
stage 5 can be determined according to the movement paths of the first and second<br>
substrate stages 4, 5 when moving from the second area SP2 via the third area SP3 to the<br>
first area SP1. In essence, it is sufficient that the positioning of the first and second cap<br>
holders 4C, 5C on the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 be optimized, according to<br>
the movement paths of the substrate stages 4, 5, such that the movement distance is short<br>
when moving the first and second substrate stages 4, 5 from the third area SP3 to the first<br>
area SP1 in order that the first and second cap holders 4C, 5C can hold the cap member<br>
30 held by the seal member 212.<br>
Next, a 12th embodiment is explained, referring to FIG. 88 and FIG. 89. A<br>
characteristic of this embodiment are the facts that an area 4Fa (5Fa) substantially flush<br>
with the surface of the substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H (5H) and an area 4Fb<br>
(5Fb) from which a distance to the final optical element FL of which is longer than that<br>
from the area 4Fa (5Fa), are formed on the substrate stage 4(5) and located around the<br>
cap member 30 held by the cap holder 4C (5C). In the following description,<br>
components the same as or similar to those of the tenth and 11th embodiments are<br>
denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In FIG. 88 and FIG. 89, a fourth area 4Fa, substantially flush with the surface of<br>
the substrate P held by the substrate holder 4H, and a fifth area 4Fb, formed such that the<br>
distance from the final optical element FL is longer than for the fourth area 4Fa, are<br><br>
formed on the first substrate stage 4 and located around the periphery of the cap member<br>
30 held by the first cap holder 4C. That is, of the upper surface 4F of the first substrate<br>
stage 4, a step is provided in proximity to the cap holder 4C, and the fifth area 4Fb is<br>
formed so as to be lower than the upper surface of the cap member 30 held by the cap<br>
holder 4C. The fifth area 4Fb, which is lower than the upper surface of the cap member<br>
30, is formed so as to be connected to the side surfaces of the first cap holder 4C and<br>
substrate table 4T.<br>
Similarly, a sixth area 5Fa, substantially flush with the surface of the substrate P<br>
held by the substrate holder 5H, and a seventh area 5Fb, formed such that the distance<br>
from the final optical element FL is longer than for the sixth area 5Fa, are formed on the<br>
second substrate stage 5 and located around the periphery of the cap member 30 held by<br>
the second cap holder 5C.<br>
For example, when the first substrate stage 4 positioned in the third area SP3 is<br>
moved from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to cause the first cap holder<br>
4C to hold the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212, the control device 7<br>
controls the movement of the first substrate stage 4 such that the fifth area 4Fb passes<br>
under the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212.<br>
A fifth area 4Fb, lower than the fourth area 4Fa, is provided on the around the<br>
cap member 30 held by the cap holder 4C, and by moving the first substrate stage 4 such<br>
that the fifth area 4Fb passes below the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, the<br>
operation of passing the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 to the first cap<br>
holder 4C can be performed in a short time. By this means, for example the time from<br>
the switching operation of the two substrate stages 4, 5 with the two sliders 86, 88 in the<br>
third area SP3 until the initiation of exposure of the substrate P on the first substrate stage<br>
4 can be shortened, and declines in throughput (the availability factor of the exposure<br><br>
apparatus EX) can be suppressed.<br>
That is, when the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 and the cap<br>
holder 4C on the first substrate stage 4 are opposed in order to have the first cap holder<br>
4C hold the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212, as explained referring to<br>
FIG. 74, the control device 7 moves the first substrate stage 4 in horizontal directions<br>
with the first substrate table 4T at a prescribed distance in the -Z direction relative to the<br>
seal member 212 and to the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, such that the<br>
seal member 212 and/or the cap member 30 held by the cap member 212 does not strike<br>
the first substrate stage 4. Then, as explained referring to FIG. 75, the control device 7<br>
moves the first substrate stage 4 upward (in the +Z direction), and the first cap holder 4C<br>
holds the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212. In this operation, by<br>
controlling the movement of the first substrate stage 4 such that the fifth area 4Fb<br>
provided on the first substrate stage 4 passes below the cap member 30 being held by the<br>
seal member 212, the amount of movement in the -Z direction of the first substrate table<br>
4T can be made small. That is, if the upper surface of the first cap holder 4C is<br>
positioned lower than (on the -Z side of) the lower surface of the cap member 30 held by<br>
the seal member 212, then even when the upper surface of the substrate table 4T (the<br>
fourth area 4Fa) is positioned on the upper side of (on the +Z side of) the cap member 30<br>
held by the seal member 212, there is no collision of the cap member 30 held by the seal<br>
member 212 with the first substrate stage 4, and the first substrate stage 4 can move in<br>
horizontal directions in order to cause the cap member 30 being held by the seal member<br>
212 to be opposed to the first cap holder 4C. Hence after causing the cap member 30<br>
and the first cap holder 4C to be opposed, the amount of movement upward (in the +Z<br>
direction) of the first substrate stage 4 in order to bring the cap member 30 and the first<br>
cap holder 4C into contact can be made small.<br><br>
FIG. 89 shows an example of a case in which a step such as that shown in FIG.<br>
88 is formed in proximity to the cap holders 4C, 5C of the substrate stages 4, 5 in the<br>
above-described 11th embodiment. In this embodiment, when the first substrate stage 4<br>
is moved from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 over the movement path indicated<br>
by the arrow Yl in FIG. 89, in order to cause the cap member 30 being held by the seal<br>
member 212 to be opposed to the first cap holder 4C, the fifth area 4Fb is formed so as to<br>
follow the arrow Yl. Specifically, the fifth area 4Fb is formed so as to follow a line<br>
connecting the first cap holder 4C on the first substrate stage 4 positioned in the third,<br>
area SP3 and the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212. By this means,<br>
the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212 can be more rapidly passed to the<br>
first cap holder 4C.<br>
Similarly, the control device 7 can control the movement of the second substrate<br>
stage 5 such that the seventh area 5Fb passes below the cap member 30 being held by the<br>
seal member 212 when the second substrate stage 5 positioned in the third area SP3 is<br>
moved from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to cause the second cap<br>
holder 5C to hold the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212. And, when<br>
the second substrate stage 5 is moved from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 over<br>
the movement path indicated by the arrow Y2 in FIG. 89 in order to cause the second cap<br>
holder 5C to hold the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212, by forming the<br>
seventh area 5Fb so as to follow the arrow Y2, the cap member 30 being held by the seal<br>
member 212 can more rapidly be passed to the second cap holder 5C.<br>
Exposure of the substrate P on the first substrate stage 4 (second substrate stage<br>
5) is completed, the cap member 30 being held by the first cap holder 4C (second cap<br>
holder 5C) is released from the cap holder 4C (5C), and after being held by the seal<br>
member 212, the first substrate stage 4 (second substrate stage 5) is moved from the first<br><br>
area SP1 to the third area SP3, while in addition the control device 7 controls movement<br>
of the first substrate stage 4 (second substrate stage 5) such that the fifth area 4Fb<br>
(seventh area 5Fb) passes below the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212.<br>
Next, a 13th embodiment is explained, referring to FIG. 90. In the following<br>
description, components the same as or similar to those of the tenth through 12th<br>
embodiments are denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is<br>
simplified or omitted.<br>
In FIG. 90, reflecting surfaces 2Kb are provided on side faces of the substrate<br>
table 4T of the first substrate stage 4. Similarly to the tenth embodiment, measurement<br>
light to measure position information in the Z-axis direction for the first substrate stage 4<br>
(substrate table 4T) is emitted from a Z interferometer 2Pz. The reflecting surfaces 2Kb<br>
are provided on three side faces among the four side faces of the substrate table 4T,<br>
formed in substantially a rectangular shape. The first cap holder 4C is positioned at a<br>
corner on which a reflecting surface 2Kb is formed on only one among the two adjacent<br>
side faces, among the first through fourth corners El to E4 of the upper surface 4F of the<br>
substrate table 4T. In FIG. 90, reflecting surfaces 2Kb are provided on the three side<br>
faces other than the -X side face (the side faces on the +X side, +Y side, and -Y side)<br>
among the four side faces of the substrate table 4T; the first cap holder 4C is provided at<br>
the first corner El. The first corner El is a corner at which a reflecting surface 2Kb is<br>
formed on only one side (the -Y side) among the adjacent side faces (the side faces on<br>
the -X and -Y sides).<br>
In FIG. 90, a fifth area 4Fb is provided on the upper surface 4F of the substrate<br>
table 4T. The fifth area 4Fb is formed so as to connect the first cap holder 4C and the<br>
side face (the -X side face) on which no reflecting surface 2Kb is formed, among the side<br><br>
faces of the substrate table 4T.<br>
For example, when the first substrate stage 4, positioned in the third area SP3, is<br>
moved from the third area SP3 to the first area SP1 in order to cause the first cap holder<br>
4C to hold the cap member 30 being held by the seal member 212, the control device 7<br>
controls movement of the first substrate stage 4 such that the reflecting faces 2Kb pass<br>
under the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212. In FIG. 90, the arrow Y3<br>
indicates the positional relation (movement path) of the liquid immersion region LR<br>
formed on the image-plane side of the final optical element FL and the first substrate<br>
stage 4.<br>
By this means, even if liquid LQ being held between the final optical element<br>
FL and the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 were to leak, when moving from<br>
the third area SP3 to the first area SP1, by controlling movement of the first substrate<br>
stage 4 such that the reflecting surfaces 2Kb do not pass under the cap member 30 held<br>
by the seal member 212, adhesion of the leaking liquid LQ to the reflecting surfaces 2Kb<br>
and other problems can be suppressed.<br>
Similarly, when moving from the first area SP1 to the third area SP3, by<br>
controlling the movement of the first substrate stage 4 such that the reflecting surfaces<br>
2Kb do not pass underneath the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, even if<br>
liquid LQ being held between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30 held<br>
by the seal member 212 were to leak, adhesion of the leaking liquid LQ to the reflecting<br>
surfaces 2Kb and other problems can be suppressed.<br>
When the first cap holder 4C is provided at the first corner El, reflecting<br>
surfaces 2Kb may be provided on the three side faces other than the - Y side face (on the<br>
+X, -X, and +Y side faces), among the four side faces of the substrate table 4T.<br>
Similarly for the second substrate stage 5, of the four side faces of the substrate<br><br>
table 5T, reflecting faces 2Kb are provided on three side faces, and the second cap holder<br>
5C is provided at the corner at which a reflecting face 2Kb is formed on only one among<br>
the two adjacent side faces among the four corners El to E4 of the upper surface 5F of<br>
the substrate table 5T. When for example, as in the above-described tenth embodiment,<br>
the second cap holder 5C is provided on the first corner El of the upper surface 5F of the<br>
substrate table 5T, reflecting surfaces 2Kb are provided on the +X, +Y, and -Y side faces<br>
among the four side faces of the substrate table 5T, or on the +X, -X, and +Y side faces;<br>
and when, as in the above-described 11th embodiment, the second cap holder 5C is<br>
provided at the fourth corner E4 of the upper surface 5F of the substrate table 5T,<br>
reflecting surfaces 2Kb are provided on the -X, +Y, and -Y side faces, or on the +X, -X,<br>
and +Y side faces, among the four side faces of the substrate table 5T.<br>
When moving the second substrate stage 5 from one to the other among the third<br>
area SP3 and the first area SP1, by controlling movement of the second substrate stage 5<br>
such that the reflecting surfaces 2Kb do not pass below the cap member 30 held by the<br>
seal member 212, even should there be leakage of liquid LQ held between the final<br>
optical element FL and the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, adhesion of the<br>
leaked liquid LQ to a reflecting surface 2Kb can be suppressed.<br>
In this embodiment, movement of the substrate stages 4, 5 is controlled in order<br>
to suppress adhesion of liquid LQ to the reflecting surfaces 2Kb, which are inclined at a<br>
prescribed angle so as to be directed upward; however, positioning of the reflecting<br>
surfaces 2Ka can be optimized, or movement of the substrate stages 4, 5 can be<br>
controlled so as to suppress the adhesion of liquid LQ to the reflecting surfaces 2Ka<br>
which are irradiated with measurement light in order to measure position information in<br>
the XY directions of the substrate stages 4, 5. For example, when reflecting surfaces<br>
2Ka are provided on three side faces other than the -X side face among the four side<br><br>
faces of the substrate table of the first substrate stage 4, and the first substrate stage 4 is<br>
moved from one to the other among the third area SP3 and first area SP1, movement of<br>
the first substrate stage 4 can be controlled such that reflecting surfaces 2Ka do not pass<br>
below the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212.<br>
Next, a 14th embodiment is explained. In the following description,<br>
components the same as or similar to those of the tenth through 13th embodiments are<br>
denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In the tenth through 13th embodiments, the cap member 30 is held by a seal<br>
member 212, and by forming a gas bearing 220 between the cap member 30 and the seal<br>
member 212, the seal member 212 holds the cap member 30. In these cases, the gap G<br>
between the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of the cap<br>
member 30, that is, the positional relation in the Z-axis direction between the seal<br>
member 212 and the cap member 30 is maintained, but there is the possibility of<br>
fluctuation in the relative positions of the seal member 212 and cap member 30 in the XY<br>
directions. Hence by providing a regulating member, which suppresses movement in<br>
directions (XY directions) along the lower surface of the seal member 212 of the cap<br>
member 30 held at the lower surface of the seal member 212, fluctuations in the relative<br>
positions in XY directions of the seal member 212 and the cap member 30 held by the<br>
seal member 212 can be suppressed. For example, as shown in FIG. 91, pin-shape<br>
members 120 can be provided en the lower surface of the seal member 212 as regulating<br>
members. Pin-shape members 120 are provided on the lower surface of the seal<br>
member 212 so as to surround the cap member 30 held to the lower surface of the seal<br>
member 212. Pin-shape members 120 are provided on the lower surface of the seal<br>
member 212 enabling protrusion and retraction; when the cap member 30 is being held at<br><br>
the lower surface of the seal member 212, the members protrude from the lower surface<br>
of the seal member 212, and when the substrate P and the first or second substrate stage 4,<br>
5 are opposed to the lower surface of the seal member 212, the members are<br>
accommodated within the seal member 212. By providing regulating members having<br>
such pin-shape members 120, movement in the XY directions of the cap member 30 held<br>
at the lower surface of the seal member 212 can be controlled.<br>
In addition to the above-described pin-shape members 120, or in place of the<br>
pin-shape members 120, protrusions and depressions may be provided on the upper<br>
surface of the cap member 30, to suppress movement (fluctuations) in the XY directions<br>
of the cap member 30.<br>
Next, a 15th embodiment is explained. In the following description,<br>
components the same as or similar to those of the tenth through 14th embodiments are<br>
denoted the same reference symbols, and description thereof is simplified or omitted.<br>
In the tenth through 14th embodiments, the cap member 30 was held in a<br>
prescribed positional relation relative to the seal member 212 by a gas bearing 220<br>
formed with the lower surface of the seal member 212. However, as a holding device to<br>
hold the cap member 30 in the prescribed positional relation with the seal member 212, if<br>
the cap member 30 can be held such that a space is formed in order to hold liquid LQ<br>
between the final optical element FL and the cap member 30, then any arbitrary<br>
configuration can be adopted. For example, the holding device 170 shown in FIG. 92<br>
has a movable member 171 which moves relative to the seal member 212, and a suction<br>
hole 172, provides in the lower surface of the movable member 171 opposing the upper<br>
surface of the cap member 30, which vacuum-clamps the cap member 30. A plurality<br>
of (for example, three) movable members 171 are provided, lateral to the outside of the<br><br>
seal member 212. A support member 173 corresponding to the movable member 171 is<br>
provided at the side face of the seal member 212, and a driving device 174, which drives<br>
the movable member 171 in the Z-axis direction with respect to the support member 173,<br>
is provided between the support member 173 and the movable member 171. Bydriving<br>
the driving device 174, the control device 7 can move the movable member, which is<br>
lateral to the seal member 212, in the vertical direction.<br>
When exposing the substrate P, the control device 7 uses the driving device 174<br>
to raise the movable member 171 such that the lower surface of the movable member 171<br>
is higher than the lower surface of the seal member 212, that is, such that the movable<br>
member 171 does not strike the substrate P. When using the holding device 170 to hold<br>
the cap member 30, the control device 7 uses the driving device 174 to lower the lower<br>
surface of the movable member 171 below the lower surface of the seal member 212 as<br>
shown in FIG. 92, and uses the suction hole 172 provided in the lower surface of the<br>
movable member 171 to suction and hold the upper surface of the cap member 30.<br>
The movable member 171 is connected to the seal member 212 via the driving<br>
device 174 and support member 173, but may for example be connected to the lens barrel<br>
PK of the projection optical system PL, to a support frame FC, or to another support<br>
member (body or column of the exposure apparatus EX) supporting the lens barrel PK.<br>
When the cap member 30 is held by the holding device 170, a gas bearing 220<br>
may be formed between the seal member 212 and the cap member 30, or may not be<br>
formed. When a gas bearing 220 is not formed between the seal member 212 and the<br>
cap member 30, the lower surface of the seal member 212 and the upper surface of the<br>
cap member 30 may be brought into contact.<br>
Furthermore, when for example the cap member 30 is formed from a magnetic<br>
(metal) material, as the holding device to hold the cap member 30 in a prescribed<br><br>
positional relation to the seal member 212, a device which uses magnetic force (a magnet<br>
or similar) to hold the cap member 30 may be used.<br>
In each of the above-described tenth through 15th embodiments, the cap holders<br>
4C, 5C are configured having a vacuum chuck mechanism; but if the cap member 30 can<br>
be releasably held, any arbitrary configuration can be adopted. For example, when the<br>
cap member 30 is formed from a magnetic (metal) material, the cap holders 4C, 5C may<br>
have a mechanism which holds the cap member 30 by magnetic force (using a magnet or<br>
similar).<br>
In each of the above-described tenth through 15th embodiments, after moving<br>
the substrate table 4T (5T) downward (in the -Z direction) as shown in FIG. 92 in order to<br>
remove the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 from the substrate stage 4 (5),<br>
the substrate stage 4 (5) is moved in a horizontal direction, as indicated in FIG. 93; but as<br>
described above, when the seal member 212 is flexibly supported by the support<br>
mechanism 212F, there is the possibility that the weight of the seal member 212 itself,<br>
and/or the weight of the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212, may cause the seal<br>
member 212 holding the cap member 30 to move downward (descend) by a prescribed<br>
amount. Should such a circumstance arise, the weight of the seal member 212 and cap<br>
member 30 themselves should be considered in optimizing the movement amount of the<br>
substrate table 4T (5T) in the -Z direction, such that the cap member 30 held by the seal<br>
member 212 does not strike the substrate stage 4 (5).<br>
In each of the above-described tenth through 15th embodiments, the support<br>
mechanism 212F supporting the seal member 212 may be provided with a driving device<br>
(actuator) which drives the seal member 212, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application, First Publication No. 2004-343114.<br>
In each of the above-described tenth through 15th embodiments, the substrate<br><br>
tables 4T, 5T are moved upward (in the +Z direction) (see FIG. 75) in order that the cap<br>
member 30 held by the seal member 212 and the cap holders 4C, 5C of the substrate<br>
stages 4, 5 do not make contact; but when the support mechanism 212F supporting the<br>
seal member 212 is provided with a driving device to drive the seal member 212 in the<br>
Z-axis direction, such as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First<br>
Publication No. 2004-343114, the seal member 212 may be moved downward (in the -Z<br>
direction). Of course, both the substrate table 4T, 5T and the seal member 212 may be<br>
moved in the Z-axis direction. Similarly, when causing the cap holder 4C, 5C on the<br>
substrate stage 4, 5 and the cap member 30 held by the seal member 212 to move apart,<br>
at least one among the substrate stage 4, 5 and the seal member 212 can be moved in the<br>
Z-axis direction.<br>
In each of the above-described tenth through 15th embodiments, when the cap<br>
member 30 being held by the seal member 212 (or by the holding device 170) is held by<br>
a cap holder 4C (5C), and when the cap member 30 being held by a cap holder 4C (5C) is<br>
held by the seal member 212 (or holding device 170), the laser interference system 2 and<br>
measurement device of the second driving system PD2 are used to control the positions<br>
and similar of the substrate stage 4 (5) and of the substrate table 4T (5T) such that the cap<br>
member 30 is held in a desired position; but, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2004-289128, a sensor or similar to monitor the<br>
position of the cap member may be provided, in order to hold the cap member 30 in a<br>
prescribed position of the cap holder 4C (5C), or in order to hold the cap member 30 in a<br>
prescribed position of the seal member 212 (or holding device 170).<br>
Furthermore, a sensor which is irradiated with exposure light EL (or with light<br>
of the same wavelength as exposure light EL), and/or a measurement member<br>
(measurement marks or similar), may be positioned on the upper surface of the cap<br><br>
member 30, and prescribed measurements may be performed when the cap member 30 is<br>
being held by the seal member 212 (or holding device 170).<br>
The liquid LQ in each of the above embodiments comprises pure water. Pure<br>
water has advantages in that it can be easily obtained in large quantity at semiconductor<br>
manufacturing plants, etc. and in that it has no adverse effects on the photoresist on the<br>
substrate P or on the optical elements (lenses), etc. In addition, pure water has no<br>
adverse effects on the environment and contains very few impurities, so one can also<br>
expect an action whereby the surface of the substrate P and the surface of the optical<br>
element provided on the front end surface of the projection optical system PL are<br>
cleaned.<br>
In addition, the index of refraction n of pure water (water) with respect to<br>
exposure light EL with a wavelength of 193 nm is nearly 1.44, so in the case where ArF<br>
excimer laser light (193 nm wavelength) is used as the light source of the exposure light<br>
EL, it is possible to shorten the wavelength to 1/n, that is, approximately 134 nm on the<br>
substrate P, to obtain high resolution. Also, the depth of focus is expanded by<br>
approximately n times, that is approximately 1.44 times, compared with it being in air, so<br>
in the case where it would be permissible to ensure the same level of depth of focus as<br>
the case in which it is used in air, it is possible to further increase the numerical aperture<br>
of the projection optical system PL, and resolution improves on this point as well.<br>
In the above embodiments, an optical element FL is attached to the front end of<br>
the projection optical system PL, and this optical element FL can be used to adjust the<br>
optical characteristics, for example, the aberration (spherical aberration, coma aberration,<br>
etc.), of the projection optical system PL. Note that an optical plate used for the<br>
adjustment of the optical characteristics of the projection optical system PL may also be<br>
used as the optical element attached to the front end of the projection optical system PL.<br><br>
Or, it may also be a plane-parallel plate (cover glass or the like) through which the<br>
exposure light EL is able to pass.<br>
When there is high pressure between the optical element at the end of the<br>
projection optical system PL and the substrate P arising due to the flow of liquid LQ, the<br>
optical element may be fixed firmly in place so that there is no movement of the optical<br>
element due to the pressure, rather than being an optical element that can be replaced.<br>
In each of the above embodiments, configurations are employed in which the<br>
space between the projection optical system PL and the surface of the substrate P is filled<br>
with liquid LQ; but a configuration may be employed in which cover glass, which is a<br>
parallel-plate element, is for example mounted on the surface of the substrate P, and the<br>
space filled with liquid LQ.<br>
The projection optical system in each of the above embodiments is configured<br>
with the optical path space on the image-plane side of the optical element at the end filled<br>
with liquid; but a projection optical system may also be adopted in which the optical path<br>
space on the object-plane side of the optical element at the end is also filled with liquid,<br>
such as is disclosed in PCT International Publication No. WO 2004/019128.<br>
Note that the liquid LQ of the above embodiments is water (pure water), but it<br>
may be a liquid other than water. For example, if the light source of the exposure light<br>
EL is an F2 laser, this F2 laser light will not pass through water, so the liquid LQ may be,<br>
for example, a fluorocarbon fluid such as a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) or a fluorocarbon<br>
oil that an F2 laser is able to pass through. In this case, liquid-affinity treatment may be<br>
performed by for example forming, on the portion in contact with the liquid LQ, a thin<br>
film of a material with a molecular structure of small polarity comprising fluorine. In<br>
addition, it is also possible to use, as the liquid LQ, liquids that have the transmittance<br>
with respect to the exposure light EL and whose refractive index are as high as possible<br><br>
and that are stable with respect to the photoresist coated on the projection optical system<br>
PL and the surface of the substrate P (for example, cedar oil).<br>
Moreover as the liquid LQ, a liquid with a refractive index of 1.6 to 1.8 may be<br>
used. Furthermore, the optical element FL may be formed from a quartz, or a material<br>
with a higher refractive index than that of quartz (for example, above 1.6).<br>
It is to be noted that as for substrate P of each of the above-described<br>
embodiments, not only a semiconductor wafer for manufacturing a semiconductor device,<br>
but also a glass substrate for a display device, a ceramic wafer for a thin film magnetic<br>
head, or a master mask or reticle (synthetic quartz or silicon wafer), etc. can be used.<br>
As for exposure apparatus EX, in addition to a step-and-scan type scanning<br>
exposure apparatus (scanning stepper) in which while synchronously moving the mask M<br>
and the substrate P, the pattern of the mask M is scan-exposed, a step-and-repeat type<br>
projection exposure apparatus (stepper) in which the pattern of the mask M is exposed at<br>
one time in the condition that the mask M and the substrate P are stationary, and the<br>
substrate P is successively moved stepwise can be used.<br>
Moreover, as for the exposure apparatus EX, the present invention can be<br>
applied to an exposure apparatus of a method in which a reduced image of a first pattern<br>
is exposed in a batch on the substrate P by using the projection optical system (for<br>
example, a refractive projection optical system having, for example, a reduction<br>
magnification of 1/8, which does not include a reflecting element), in the state with the<br>
first pattern and the substrate P being substantially stationary. In this case, the present<br>
invention can be also applied to a stitch type batch exposure apparatus in which after the<br>
reduced image of the first pattern is exposed in a batch, a reduced image of a second<br>
pattern is exposed in a batch on the substrate P, partially overlapped on the first pattern<br>
by using the projection optical system, in the state with the second pattern and the<br><br>
substrate P being substantially stationary. As the stitch type exposure apparatus, a<br>
step-and-stitch type exposure apparatus in which at least two patterns are transferred onto<br>
the substrate P in a partially overlapping manner, and the substrate P is sequentially<br>
moved can be used.<br>
Furthermore, at least a portion of the above embodiments can also be applied to<br>
an exposure apparatus comprising only a single substrate stage, or to an exposure<br>
apparatus furnished with a substrate stage for holding a substrate, and a measurement<br>
stage on which is mounted a reference member formed with a reference mark, and<br>
various photoelectronic sensors, as disclosed for example in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application, First Publication No. Hll-135400 (corresponding to PCT<br>
International Publication No. WO 1999/23692), and Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2000-164504 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,897,963).<br>
The types of exposure apparatuses EX are not limited to exposure apparatuses<br>
for semiconductor element manufacture that expose a semiconductor element pattern<br>
onto a substrate P, but are also widely applicable to exposure apparatuses for the<br>
manufacture of liquid crystal display elements and for the manufacture of displays, and<br>
exposure apparatuses for the manufacture of thin film magnetic heads, image pickup<br>
elements (CCD), micro machines, MEMS, DNA chips, and reticles or masks.<br>
In each of the abovementioned embodiments, an optical transmission type mask<br>
formed with a predetermined shielding pattern (or phase pattern or dimming pattern) on<br>
an optical transmission substrate is used. However instead of this mask, for example as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,778,257, an electronic mask (called a variable form mask;<br>
for example this includes a DMD (Digital Micro-mirror Device) as one type of<br>
non-radiative type image display element) for forming a transmission pattern or<br><br>
reflection pattern, or a light emitting pattern, based on electronic data of a pattern to be<br>
exposed may be used.<br>
Furthermore the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus<br>
(lithography system) which exposes a run-and-space pattern on a substrate P by forming<br>
interference fringes on the substrate P, as disclosed for example in PCT International<br>
Publication No. WO 2001/035168.<br>
In the abovementioned embodiments, respective position information for the<br>
mask stage 3 and the substrate stages 4 and 5 is measured using an interference system<br>
(2). However the invention is not limited to this and for example, an encoder system<br>
which detects a scale (grating) provided in each stage may be used. In this case,<br>
preferably a hybrid system is furnished with both of an interference system and an<br>
encoder system, and calibration of the measurement results of the encoder system is<br>
performed using the measurement results of the interference system. Moreover,<br>
position control of the stage may be performed using the interference system and the<br>
encoder system interchangeably, or using both.<br>
Moreover, the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus as<br>
disclosed for example in Published Japanese Translation No. 2004-519850<br>
(corresponding U.S. Patent No. 6,611,316) of the PCT International Application, which<br>
combines patterns of two masks on a substrate via a projection optical system, and<br>
double exposes a single shot region on the substrate at substantially the same time, using<br>
a single scan exposure light.<br>

patent application, the disclosures in all of the Japanese Patent Publications and U.S.<br>
Patents related to exposure apparatuses and the like cited in the above respective<br>
embodiments and modified examples, are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>

the various subsystems has ended, overall assembly is performed, and the various<br>
precisions are ensured for the exposure apparatus as a whole. Note that it is preferable<br>
that the manufacture of the exposure apparatus be performed in a clean room in which<br>
the temperature, the degree of cleanliness, etc. are controlled.<br>
