SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates in a first aspect to a pharmaceutical composition comprising as a first active agent, an estrogen (or naturally or synthetic derivative thereof) in sufficient amounts to treat diseases, disorders and symptoms associated with deficient endogenous levels of estrogen in women, and as a second active agent, 6B,7p;15p;16B-dimethylene-3-oxo-17a-preg-4-ene-21,17-carbolactone (drospirenone) in sufficient amounts to protect the endometrium from the adverse effects of estrogen, together with pharmaceuticalJy acceptable excipients or carriers.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising as a first active agent estradiol in amounts corresponding to a daily dose of 1 to 3 mg to treat diseases, disorders and symptoms associated with deficient endogenous levels of estrogen in women, and as a second active agent 6p,7p;15B;16p-dimethylene-3-oxo-17a-preg-4-ene-21,17-carbo!actone (drospirenone) in amounts corresponding to a daily dose of 1 to 3.5 mg to protect the endometrium from the adverse effects of estrogen, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a combination of estrogen and irospirenone for the preparation of a medicament wherein the amount of estrogen is sufficient to treat diseases, disorders and symptoms associated with deficient endogenous levels of estrogen in and the amount of drospirenone is sufficient to protect he endometrium from the adverse effects of estrogen.<br>
n a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating diseases, disorders and lymptoms associated with deficient endogenous levels of estrogen in women comprising idministering estrogen in sufficient amounts to alleviate said symptoms and drospirenone i sufficient amounts to protect the endometrium from adverse effects of estrogen.<br>
;urthermore, the invention relates to a method of treating and preventing diseases, isorders and symptoms associated with deficient endogenous levels of estrogen in<br><br>
women comprising administering estradiol in amounts corresponding to daily doses of 1 to 1*3 mg, such as 1, 2 or 3 mg, and drospirenone in amounts corresponding to daily doses of 11,3.5 mg, such as 1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, or 3.5 mg.<br>
   DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present context, the term cycle itself or when associated with the term menstrual is intended to mean the number of days between menses in a woman. It can range from 21-31 days, typically 28 days.<br>
In the present context, the term menopause is understood as the last natural (ovary -induced) menstruation. It is a single event and a result of an age-dependent dysfunction of the ovarian follicles. Menopause results from the ovaries decreasing their production of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. When the number of follicles falls below a certain threshold (a bleeding threshold), the ovaries can no longer produce mature follicles and sex hormones. The ability to reproduce capability ends with menopause.<br>
The peri-menopausal phase begins with the onset of climacteric symptoms when the cycle becomes irregular and ends one year after menopause.   The end of peri-menopausal phase can be identified after a protracted period of time without bleeding. Post-menopause is the phase that begins at menopause and continues until death.<br>
One principal aim of hormone replacement therapy is to restore levels of the sex steroid hormones in naturaily or prematurely pre-menopausal, menopausal and post-menopausal women or to establish these levels in hypogonadal females.<br>
Monotherapy, also referred to as unopposed therapy, is the treatment with estrogens alone. Exogenous estrogens stimulate the proliferation of the endometrium. In estrogen monotherapy, the opposing effect of progesterone, which terminates proliferation, is absent. The desquamation phase, during which the top layers of the endometrium are shed, does not occur and proliferation of the endometrium occurs to a greater extent than in the phases up to an including the pre-menopausal phase. The result is hyperplasia, a risk factor for endometrial cancer.<br><br>
Combination therapy, also referred to as opposed therapy, is a treatment where a progestagen is added to protect the endometrium from hyperplasia.<br>
The use of natural progesterone in combination therapy is limited by the low bioavailability of natural progesterone, even in micronized form. Significantly, it has been found that combination therapy comprising the use of drospirenone as a progestagen, is remarkably effective. Drospirenone (DRSP), a 17-a-spirolactone derivative, is a synthetic progestagen that has a surprisingly similar physiological profile to progesterone yet notably better bioavailability. It is the first synthetic progestagen to have a progesterone-like pharmacological profile in that it is antiestrogenic, antiandrogenic, and has antimineralcorticoid activity.<br>
The invention embodies a pharmaceutical composition comprising an estrogen, or naturally or synthetic derivative thereof, in sufficient amounts to treat diseases, disorders and symptoms associated with deficient endogenous levels of estrogen in women, and as a second active agent, 6p,7|J;15p;16^dimethylene-3-oxo-17a-preg-4-ene-21,17-arbolactone (drospirenone) in sufficient amounts to protect the endometrium from the adverse effects of estrogen, together with pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients or carriers.<br>
Apart form the active substances themselves, it is envisaged that an ester or prodrug of drospirenone may be employed in the present composition, e.g. an oxyiminopregnane carbolactone as disclosed in WO 98/24801.<br>
Deficient levels of estrogen can occur for a variety of reasons. The composition can be suoh that it is adequate for deficient levels of estrogen, regardless of the cause. Causes anticipated by the therapy are, but not limited to, natural menopause, peri-menopause, post-menopause, hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure.<br>
Low levels of estrogen, irrespective of the cause, lead to an overall decreased quality of life for women. Symptoms, diseases and disorders range from merely being inconvenient to life threatening. The composition of this therapy anticipates the effective alleviation of all physiological and psychological signs of estrogen deficiency.<br><br>
Transient symptoms, such as vasomotor signs and psychological symptoms are certainly embodied with the realm of therapy. Vasomotor signs comprise but are not limited to hot fjjjshes, sweating attacks such as night sweats, and palpitations. Psychological symptoms of estrogen deficiency comprise, but are not limited to, insomnia and other sleep disorders, poor memory, loss of confidence, mood changes, anxiety, loss of libido, difficulties in concentration, difficulty in making decisions, diminished energy and drive, irritability, and crying spells.<br>
The treatment of the aforementioned symptoms can be associated with the peri-menopausal phase of a woman"s life or after, sometimes long after menopause. It is anticipated that the invention is applicable to these and other transient symptoms during the peri-menopausal phase, menopause, or post-menopausa) phase. Moreover, the aforementioned symptoms can be alleviated if the cause of the estrogen deficiency is hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the therapy is used for the treatment of permanent effects of estrogen deficiency. Permanent effects comprise physical changes such as urogenital atrophy, atrophy of the breasts, cardiovascular disease, changes in hair distribution, thickness of hair, changes in skin condition and osteoporosis.<br>
Urogenital atrophy, conditions associated with it such as vaginal dryness, increase in vaginal pH and subsequent changes in flora, or events which lead to such atrophy, such as decreases in vascularity, fragmentation of elastic fibres, fusion of collagen fibres, or decreases in cell volume are symptoms thought to be particularly relevant to this therapy. Furthermore, the invention is thought to be relevant to other urogenital changes associated estrogen deficiency such as decreases in the length and/or diameter of the vagina, decreases mucus production, changes in celt population, decreases in glycogen production, decreases in growth of lactobacilli or increases in growth of streptococci, staphylococci, or coliform bacilli. Other associated changes that are thought to be preventable by the invention are those that may render the vagina susceptible to injury or infection, such as exudative discharges, vaginitis, and dyspareunia. Furthermore, infections of the urinary tract and incontinence are other common symptoms associated with lowered estrogen levels.<br><br>
.Other embodiments of the invention include the prevention or alleviation of physical Changes associated with estrogen deficiency, such as changes in the skin, changes in h^r distribution, thickness of hair, atrophy of the breasts, or osteoporosis.<br>
The prevention and management of osteoporosis, most notably postmenopausal osteoporosis, is a particularly interesting embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, bone demineralisation, reduction of bone mass and density, thinning and interruption of trabecule, and/or consequent increase in bone fractures or bone deformations are thought to be particularly relevant. The prophylactic treatment of osteoporosis is an interesting therapeutic application of the invention.<br>
A particularly interesting embodiment of the invention comprises the use of the composition for lessening the frequency, persistence, duration and/or severity of hot flushes, sweating attacks, palpitations, sleep disorders, mood changes, nervousness, anxiety, poor memory, loss of confidence, loss of libido, poor concentration, diminished energy, diminished drive, irritability, urogenital atrophy, atrophy of the breasts, cardiovascular disease, changes in hair distribution, thickness of hair, changes in skin condition and osteoporosis, most notably hot flushes, sweating attacks, palpitations, sleep disorders, mood changes, nervousness, anxiety, urogenital atrophy, atrophy of the breasts or for the prevention or management of osteoporosis.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition for HRT disclosed herein comprises estrogen. In preferred embodiments, the estrogen is selected from the group consisting of estradiol, estradiol sutfamates, estradiol valerate, estradiol benzoate, ethinyl estradiol, estrone, estriol, estriol succinate and conjugated estrogens, including conjugated equine estrogens such as estrone sulfate, 17ft-estradiol sulfate, 17o&gt;estradio! sulfate, equilin sulfate, 17f&gt; dihydroequilin sulfate, 17a-dihydroequilin sulfate, equilenin sulfate, 17p-dihydroequilenin sulfate and17a-dihydroequllenin sulfate or mixtures thereof. Particularly interesting estrogens are selected from the group consisting of estradiol, estradiol sulfamates, estradiol valerate, estradiol benzoate, estrone, and estrone sulfate or mixtures thereof, notably estradiol, estradiol valerate, estradiol benzoate and estradiol sulfamates. Most preferred are estradiol or estradiol sulfamates, particularly estradiol.<br>
Thought to be particularly relevant are micranized forms of estrogens, such as micronized estradiol, micronized estradiol sulfamates, micronized estradiol valerate, micronized<br><br>
estradiol benzoate, micronized estrone, or micronized estrone sulfate or mixtures thereof, fcrotably micronized estradiol, micronized estradiol valerate, micronized estradiol benzoate or^iicronized estradiol sulfamates. Most preferred is micronized estradiol or micronized estradiol sulfamates, particularly micronized estradiol.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, wherein the composition comprises more than one estrogen, one or more estrogen may be in micronized form, such as 2 or ail of the estrogen.<br>
Moreover, an interesting embodiment of the invention comprises a composition wherein the drospirenone (DRSP) is in micronized form, such that one or both estrogen and DRSP are in micronized form, preferably both estrogen and DRSP are in micronized form.<br>
Drospirenone, which may be prepared substantially as described in, e.g., US 4,129,564 or WO 98/06738, is a sparingly soluble substance in water and aqueous buffers at various pH values. Furthermore, drospirenone is rearranged to an inactive isomer under acid conditions and hydrolysed under alkaline conditions. To ensure good bioavailability of the compound, it is therefore advantageously provided in a form that promotes rapid dissolution thereof.<br>
It has been found that when drospirenone is provided in micronized form in a pharmaceutical composition, rapid dissolution of the active compound from the composition occurs in vitro. A micronized substance is such that a test batch (ca. 200 mg) of the particles, herein drospirenone particles, has a surface area of more than 10,000 cnrVg, and has the following particle size distribution for drospirenone as determined under the microscope: not more than 2 particles in a given batch (ca. 200 mg) with a diameter of more than 30 u,m, and preferably <. particles with a diameter of and urn. the term dissolution is defined as at least over about minutes in particular drospirenone from tablet preparation containing mg ml water determined by usp xxiii paddle method using test apparatus rpm.></.>
As an alternative to providing the drospirenone in micronized form, it is possible to dissolve it in a suitable solvent, e.g. methanol or ethyl acetate, and spray it onto the<br><br>
surface of inert carrier particles followed by incorporation of the particles containing drospirenone on their surface in the composition. V<br>
Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, it appears that the in vitro dissolution rate of drospirenone is connected to the dissolution rate in vivo resulting in rapid absorption of drospirenone in vivo on oral administration of the compound. This is an advantage because isomerization of the compound in the gastric environment and/or hydrolysis in the intestine is substantially reduced, leading to a high bioavailability of the compound.<br>
With respect to the estrogen which may also be a sparingly soluble substance, though usually less sensitive to degradation than drospirenone under conditions prevailing in the gastrointestinal tract, it is also an advantage to provide it in micronized form or sprayed from a solution, e.g. in ethanol, onto the surface of inert carrier particles. This has the added advantage of facilitating a more homogenous distribution of the estrogen throughout the composition. When the estrogen is provided in micronized form, it preferably has the following particle size distribution as determined under the microscope: 100% ofthe particles have a diameter of  15 p.m and 
The particle size distribution for estradiol or estradiol hem"ihydrate is preferably such that 100% ofthe particles in a given batch have a diameter less than 15.0 pm, 99% have a diameter less than 12.5 urn, 95% have a diameter less than 10.0 pm, 50% have a diameter less than 3.0 pm, or 40% have a diameter less than 1.1 pm.<br>
To obtain a more rapid rate of dissolution, it is preferred to include carriers or excipients, which act to promote dissolution of both active substances. Examples of such carriers and sxcipients include substances that are readily soluble in water such as cellulose ierivatives, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl ;ellulose, gelled starch, gelatin or polyvinylpyrrolidone. In particular, it is anticipated that polyvinylpyrrolidone might be particularly helpful to promote dissolution.<br><br>
The dose of the drospirenone in each composition is preferably such as to protect the -endometrium from the adverse effects of estrogen. DRSP, in sufficient doses, may be u|jd as an opponent to estrogen to protect the endometrium form hyperplasia or cancer.<br>
In some cases, however, the dose of DRSP may be sufficient so as to stabilise the menstrual cycle and bleeding pattern. In such cases, doses of estrogen may be low or nil. Adipose tissue production of estrogen may be such that no or very low doses of estrogen are required to stabilise the menstrual cycle and bleeding pattern. Moreover, in certain embodiments, where the woman suffers from other disorders not compatible with the use of an exogenous source of estrogen (such as for the absolute contraindications of severe liver diseases and pregnancy or for the relative contraindications endometrial carcinoma and endometriosis, mammary carcinoma, venous thromboembolism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, otosclerosis and melanoma) no or very low amounts of estrogen may be in the composition. In such embodiments, the dose of DRSP may be such that the disorder, disease, or symptom is alleviated.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the dose of DRSP corresponds to 15 to 70 mg per cycle, such as 20 to 60 mg per cycle, particularly 40 to 60 mg per cycle. The length of the cycle, as stated supra may vary from 21 to31 days". Viewed otherwise, a composition may comprise of an amount of DRSP corresponding to a daily dose ranging from 0.25 to 10, such as about 0.25 to 8, 0.25 to 6, 0.25 to 5, 0.5 to 4.5, 1 to 4, and 1.5 to 3.5 mg.<br>
The dose of estrogen may vary from woman to woman, depending on the phase of her life (peri-menopausal or post-menopausal), endogenous levels of estrogen, the severity of the symptom(s), disorder or disease, the disorder, disease or symptom targeted, the use by the woman of other medicaments for other purposes, and other pharmacokinetic variables.<br>
In other embodiments, the dose of estrogen andfor DRSP is sufficient to treat hot flushes, sweating attacks, palpitations, sleep disorders, mood changes, nervousness, anxiety, poor memory, loss of confidence, loss of libido, poor concentration, diminished energy, diminished drive, irritability, urogenital atrophy, atrophy of the breasts, cardiovascular disease, changes in hair distribution, thickness of hair, changes in skin condition or for the prevention or management of osteoporosis.<br><br>
The dose of estrogen and/or DRSP may depend on the treatment, be it for endometrial protection such as bleeding pattern, for osteoporosis prevention or management, for the<br>
treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as the for the reduction in the number,<br>
frequency, and severity of hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings palpitations, insomnia    and other sleep disorders, mood changes, nervousness, anxiety, poor memory, loss of<br>
confidence, loss of libido, poor concentration, diminished energy, diminished drive and<br>
irritability.<br>
In embodiments wherein the estrogen is estradiol, the amount of estradiol corresponds to a daily dose ranging from 0.1 to5mg, such as about 0.2 to 4.5, 0.5 to 4, 1 to 3, in particular 1, 2, or3mg.<br>
With regards to the doses of estradiol derivatives with greater potency, e.g. estradiol valerate, the comparable dosage may be calculated by adjusting the above-mentioned dosages in accordance to the relative potency.<br>
In embodiments where the woman is peri-menopausal the dose of estrogen and/or DRSP may depend on the day of the cycle, that is, whether she is in the preovulatory or postovulatory phase of the cycle, and how advanced within each phase. In embodiments where the woman is post-menopausal or even pre-menopausal, the dose of estrogen and/or DRSP may depend on the time since the last menstruation.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the medicament is administered in the form a of a number of separately packaged and individually removable dosage units placed in a packaging unit and intended for oral administration for a period of at least 21, such as at least 28 days, such as at least 30 or 31 days. In such embodiments, the dose of DRSP and/or estrogen may be the same within each dosage unit or may vary. In embodiments where the amount of DRSP and/or estrogen in the dosage unit varies according to the phase or day within the period of at least 21 days, such as at least 26 days that said dosage unit is to be administered, such compositions, methods of treatments and preparations are termed multi-phased.<br>
The dose proportionality may vary according to its use. In preferred embodiments the dose proportionality of estrogen and drospirenone for the preparation of a medicament is such that estrogen doses are to treat diseases, disorders and symptoms associated with<br><br>
W,MBI ,l ei"oogenous levels ot estrogen and the amount of drospirenone is sufficient to protect the endometrium from the adverse effects of estrogen.<br>
V<br>
In preferred embodiments, the dose proportionality is sufficient to treat hot flushes,<br>
sweating attacks, palpitations, sleep disorders, mood changes, nervousness, anxiety, poor memory, loss of confidence, loss of libido, poor concentration, diminished energy, diminished drive, irritability, urogenital atrophy, atrophy of the breasts, cardiovascular disease, changes in hair distribution, thickness of hair, changes in skin condition or for the srevention or management of osteoporosis.<br>
