				<td>A THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITION COMPRISING PATHOGEN INHIBITING<br>
OLIGOSACCHARIDES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the fields of carbohydrate biochemistry and clinical<br>
microbiology. The invention provides a therapeutic composition comprising purified<br>
fractions of compounds being or containing a pathogen-inhibiting oligosaccharide<br>
sequence for use as a medicament. The present invention especially describes an<br>
oligosaccharide-containing substance or receptor binding to human diarrhea causing<br>
pathogens. The invention is based on wide studies about multiple different pathogenic<br>
bacteria having diverse pathologic adhesive mechanisms. The inventors found out multiple<br>
common receptors which can be specifically regulated, thus reducing the possibilities for<br>
effective therapy by single receptor sequence(s). Special therapeutic compositions<br>
comprising at least two different oligosaccharide sequences were found out to be<br>
especially useful. The present invention is especially directed to diarrheagenic<br>
Escherichia coli and/or zoonotic Helicobacter species, and use thereof in, e.g.,<br>
pharmaceutical and nutritional compositions for prophylaxis and treatment of conditions<br>
due to the presence of human diarrhea causing pathogens, especially diarrheagenic<br>
Escherichia coli and/or zoonotic Helicobacter species. The invention is also directed to the<br>
use of the receptors for diagnostics of human diarrhea causing pathogens, especially<br>
diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and zoonotic Helicobacter species.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Of prime interest with respect to bacterial colonization and infection is the mechanism(s)<br>
by which bacteria adheres to the epithelial cell surfaces. The prior art describing bindings<br>
of various bacteria does not describe the use of the receptor combinations according to the<br>
present invention against infections, especially against intestinal infections. The present<br>
invention is also useful for gastrointestinal infections, especially oral infections, and can be<br>
used against lung infections.<br>
Carbohydrate binding of EPEC<br>
CHO-cell mutants have been used to study the effect of glycosylation on EPEC binding.<br>
Since a sialic-acid-and-Gal-lacking mutant had lower binding activity than a sialic acid<br>
lacking mutant, the authors suggested that the binding sequence could be Gaip3GlcNAc or<br>
Galß4GlcNAc and sialic acid. The idea of Galp3GlcNAc or Gaip4GlcNAc usage was also<br>
patented. It was suggested that sialic acid may be necessary for EPEC mediated cell<br>
detachment (Vanmale, R.P. et al., 1995). However, the cell surface glycosylation is<br>
involving several classes of glycoproteins and glycolipids, and the biosynthetic pathways<br>
for glycosylations are so complicated that mutations have multiple biosynthetic effects on<br>
glycosylations which are not properly characterized yet. The present invention shows that<br>
not all sialic acid oligosaccharide sequences were effectively active, and similarly, the<br>
disaccharides alone in all structures are not effectively active. The present invention is<br>
directed to the use of more specific effective structures which could not be determined<br>
based on the previous data. In another study the same scientist inhibited attachment of an<br>
EPEC-strain to Hep-2 cells by N-acetyl lactosamine-BSA and Lex -BSA neoglycoproteins<br>
in the concentration range 0.4- 0.8 mg/ml (Vanmaele, R.P. et al., 1995). According to the<br>
present invention the disaccharide sequences or Lex are not enough for strong binding to<br>
EPEC, but larger or more specific oligosaccharide sequences according to the invention<br>
are preferred. The present invention also describes simultaneous use of compositions of<br>
two or several oligosaccharide sequences for theraphy of all types of diarrhea causing<br>
infections for several pathogens, even when pathogen is undetermined. The present<br>
invention is specifically directed to therapeutically useful polyvalent conjugates which are<br>
effective in lower concentrations and does not comprise unnatural protein structures, which<br>
are potent antigens or allergens.<br>
WO96/39190 indicates binding specificities of heat labile toxin of ETEC E. coli. They list<br>
lactose, Galß3GalNAc, GalNAcp4Gal, and NeuNAca3Gal linked to solid, inert support.<br>
The results with solid support and weak partial receptor epitopes are not relevant to the<br>
present invention. The two first disaccharide epitopes were revealed here to be inactive as<br>
monovalent inhibitors. The patent application does not describe the longer more effective<br>
epitopes nor soluble polyvalent conjugates according to the invention.<br>
A small variety of commercial glycolipids has been used to screen the specifity of an<br>
EPEC strain. In decreasing order of activity asialo-GMl, asialo-GM2, globoside and lacto-<br>
N-tetraose were observed to bind, while sialylated gangliosides, lactosylceramide,<br>
globotriaosylceramide (Gala4Galß4GlcpCer), and Forssmann glycolipid were negative.<br>
Asialo-GMl binding was studied with several strains. The binding active epitope was<br>
considered to be GalNAcß4Gal or GalNAcß3Gal with weaker activity. The authors also<br>
describe binding to asialo-GMl neoglycoprotein and GalNAc neoglycoprotein but not<br>
inhibition of the binding to the asialo-GMl by neoglycoproteins at 25 micromolar<br>
concentration or undefined oligosaccharides at 1 mM concentration (Jagannatha, H.M. et<br>
al., 1991). The authors did not observe the several binding specificities obvious from the<br>
present invention, wherein several strains were tested. These specificities include<br>
lactosylceramide binding, Gakx4Gal-binding (globotriose and Forssman antigen negative)<br>
or sialic acid dependent bindings of the bacteria. Their results indicated specifically that<br>
the contradictory bindings described were not inhibitable by monovalent or polyvalent<br>
oligosaccharide sequences and therefore this study did not show therapeutically useful<br>
types of binding as the present invention does. The failure to show all the bindings and<br>
inhibition may be related in technical failure in the process.<br>
Several oligosaccharide fractions from human milk were analysed for inhibition of EPEC<br>
strains at a concentration 3 mg/ml. Inhibiting activity was observed in pentasaccharide<br>
fraction, possible difucosylactose fraction, possible lacto- and neolactotetraose fraction,<br>
heptasaccharide fraction and hexasaccharide fraction. The fractions were named after<br>
expected major components. Compositions of the fractions were determined by<br>
monosaccharide analysis which does not reveal the exact structures of the components.<br>
The real compositions of the fractions and the presence of potential minor or other<br>
saccharides were not assessed (Cravioto, A, et al 1991). As the active compound or<br>
compounds were not characterized, the data would not have lead to the present invention.<br>
Human milk lactoferrin, secretory IgA and free secretory component has been shown to<br>
inhibit EPEC-binding to glycoproteins of HELA-cells, with no indications to carbohydrate<br>
structures (Nascimento de Araujo, and Giugliano 2001).<br>
Inhibition of the EHEC toxin binding to Gala4Gal(34Glc and binding data about other<br>
toxins of E.coli binding to Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcßCer has not been shown to cure the<br>
diseases. There are suggestions with regard to the use of solid phase conjugates containing<br>
Gala4Gaip4Glc for inhibition of toxins in therapeutics against diarrhea. The clinical trials<br>
using the single epitopes failed. The polyvalent conjugates according to the present<br>
invention are specifically directed to soluble polyvalent conjugates for effective inhibitions<br>
of pathogens, especially adhesion of diarrhea causing E. coli bacteria. As a specific<br>
embodiment the invention is directed to the prevention of non-toxin secreting E. coli. The<br>
toxin blocking oligosaccharides are not indicated for the types of E. coli.<br>
Purified colonialization factors of certain ETEC strains were shown to bind to asialo-GMl<br>
(GaißGalNAcß4Lac-Cer) but not to sialylated control gangliosides (Oroe, et al., 1990). A<br>
colonialization factor was shown to bind to several galactoglycoproteins in the rabbit<br>
intestine. This binding could be inhibited by asialo-GMl, GM1, GM2, but not so<br>
effectively by GM3 and the adhesin bound to GalNAcß4Gal-neoglycoprotein. Human<br>
meconium glycoprotein and its asialo- and afucoform inhibited the binding more weakly<br>
and bovine glycophorin most weakly. As the binding of the Maackia amuriensis lectin, the<br>
meconium glycoprotein binding was also probably polylactosamine dependent. Sialic acid<br>
residues were considered not to be important for the bindings (Neeser, J.R. et al, 1989;<br>
Wenneras, C. et al. 1995). However, this study shows no useful defined multiepitope<br>
solution for treatment of diarrheas or other infections. The polylactosamine specificity was<br>
not defined, if present The present invention shows that not all of polylactosamine type<br>
sequences, such as the branched structure, are active. Use of combinations of specificities<br>
are not defined.<br>
Human milk gangliosides GM1 and GM3 and more weakly GD3 were inhibiting the<br>
binding of an ETEC and an EPEC strain to human cancer Caco-2 cells, while<br>
lactosylceramide, GD3-lactone, and N-acetylneuraminic acid was negative. The present<br>
invention shows a lactosylceramide binding and sialic acid dependent bindings. This prior<br>
art shows a potential single not well characterized specificity which, if existant, is probably<br>
not even among the binding specificities disclosed in the present invention.<br>
EPEC binding to HeLa cells was inhibited by 100 mM N-acetylgalactosamine and a<br>
bacterial membrane protein was purified by affinity chromatography using GalNAc<br>
(Scatelsky, et al. 1988). However, disclosed weak bindings to a monosaccharide do not<br>
allow any conclusions on the biological significance of said binding.<br>
EPECs may bind to Man, alpha-methyl-Man and Man-containing N-glycan sequences. The<br>
most active compounds contained Manal-3Man- structure (Neeser et al. 1986). An earlier<br>
study characterized Manal-3Manpl-4GlcNAc, Manal-paranitrophenyl and Manal-<br>
3(Manal-6)Manal-6(Manal-3)Manal-OMe as good binders to type 1 villi of E. coli 346<br>
(Firon et al., 1982). However, the publications do not determine the use of the epitope<br>
together with other specific binding molecules.<br>
Hemagglutination of erythrocytes by an ETEC strain was inhibited by mucin type II<br>
(Sigma), a red cell glycoprotein preparation, gangliosides type II, and sialic acid (1<br>
mg/ml). The hemagglutination could be prevented by protease, sialidase, periodate, urea<br>
and guanidium chloride. This study does not describe the nature of the sialic acid<br>
potentially involved in the binding under the experimental conditions (Barthus et al, 1985).<br>
CFA/I was purified and shown to be a polymeric protein with Mw about 23,800. The<br>
purified protein had hemagglutination activity when aggregated by acid. Only N-<br>
acetylneuraminic acid could inhibit the hemagglutination. The effect of NeuNAc was<br>
suggested to be non-specific (Evans et al, 1979). Potentially sialylated, sialidase sensitive,<br>
glygoprotein receptors have been reported for ETEC (Pieroni, P., and Worobec, E.A. 1988,<br>
Wenneras et al., 1990)<br>
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) binding to HeLa-cells have been reported to be<br>
inhibitable by human milk protein fractions, which were not characterized (Nascimento de<br>
Araujo, and Giugliano 2000). The specificity of the binding towards the carbohydrates<br>
involved, if any, has not been described.<br>
Monovalent oligosaccharide Gala4Gaip4Glc has been suggested for inhibition of shiga<br>
toxina and shigalike toxin in US20030405503 but the inhibitor seems not be useful in<br>
monovalent form. Minor effects were obtained in inhibition of toxin with monovalent<br>
inhibitor at 5 % concentration corresponding to about 100 mM oligosaccharide, such high<br>
concentration may have dehydrating or other unexpected effects. The present invention is<br>
further directed to inhibition of non-toxigenic diarrhea causing E. coli with monovalent<br>
Gala4Gaiß4Glc where effect is seen with useful concentration of 0.3 mM and inhibition at<br>
low concentrations of the Globo-receptor oligosaccharides.<br>
Two applications describe the use of Lacto-N-neotetraose for stimulating Bifidobacterium<br>
[US59069821 and inhibition of E. coli and some other bacteria [US6083934]. The<br>
inhibition is not against binding of the E. coli but occurs during cultivation of the bacteria.<br>
The invention does not demonstrate the usefulness of the substance in combination of other<br>
saccharides. The applications do not show inhibition of diarrheagenic E. coli species or<br>
types according to the invention. Lacto-N-tetraose has been also claimed for improving the<br>
stool quality of infants in an application of Lundblad and Biocarb, but the invention was<br>
not directed to treatment of diarrhea, especially the diarrheas caused by E. coli according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Uropathoeenic E. coli<br>
Many studies describing the bingding of uropathogenic E. coli have been performed. This<br>
bacterium binds for example to Galal-4Gal-sequences. PCT/SE81/00065 describes<br>
binding activity of E. coli causing urinary tract diseases, not intestinal disease. The data<br>
does not show Gala4Gal binding of a diarrheagenic E.coli. The uropathogenic bacteria are<br>
different from the intestinal diarrhea causing apthogens such as EHEC, ETEC, EPEC,<br>
EAEC, or EIEC. Bindings and infection mechanisms of bacteria vary between strains and<br>
types of bacteria, and results from one indication cannot be generalized to other<br>
indications. The binding specificities of the bacteria infecting different organs are adapted<br>
to the tissue specific receptors present on certain tissues. The glycosylations in human and<br>
animal is in general tissue- and species-specific. A potential situation where cross-<br>
reactivity between species may arise, needs to be addressed by characterizing the exact<br>
receptor structures in target tissues and the specificities of the cross-reacting bacteria.<br>
In general the prior art does not describe useful combinations of specified receptor<br>
activities for effective treatment of infections, especially intestinal infections. The prior art<br>
concentrates on single specificities, which are in general not shown to be present<br>
simultaneously on a single strain of bacteria. Due to variations in single bacterial strain the<br>
binding specificities may vary between experiments. Further, the prior art does not show<br>
useful therapies using monovalent oligosaccharide sequences or polyvalent sequences as<br>
described in the present invention<br>
The prior art does not suggest a simultaneous therapeutical use of several inhibitors of<br>
carbohydrate mediated pathogen binding. The therapeutically useful combinations of<br>
carbohydrate mediated pathogen binding could be considered,<br>
1) if a certain strain of a pathogenic bacterium (or a pathogen cell) has several binding<br>
specificities; and<br>
2) if these binding specificities are simultaneously present on the pathogen; and<br>
3) if corresponding receptor oligosaccharide sequences are present on a relevant target<br>
tissue; and<br>
4) if relevant receptor oligosaccharide sequences are available for the binding<br>
specificities of the pathogen.<br>
When considering usefulness of therapeutic receptor combinations, the effects of possible<br>
inhibitor oligosaccharides alone and in combinations must be established. The present<br>
invention shows useful substances and compositions for inhibition of pathogens. The prior<br>
art is about potential bindings and does not allow any determination of the effective<br>
inhibitors of pathogen binding as shown in the present invention.<br>
Identification of relevant receptor oligosaccharide on human gastrointestinal tract<br>
The present invention discloses the presence of glycoprotein bound oligosaccharide<br>
sequences which can serve as primary or first contact receptors on human gastrointestinal<br>
epithelium. Several novel receptor sequences are demonstrated. A combination of<br>
pathogen binding data with novel information of the most relevant first contact receptors<br>
allowed us to determine useful inhibitors for pathogen binding. The analysis of receptors<br>
according to the invention revealed that several novel receptor types are present on<br>
gastrointestinal epithelia and these are, as first contact receptors, more available for a<br>
primary contact with pathogens.<br>
Zoonotic Helicobacter species<br>
There are more than 20 characterised Helicobacter species to date (On, 2001). The species have<br>
been isolated from several hosts including primates, pigs, felines, canines, poultry and rodents (On,<br>
2001). In their hosts, Helicobacter spp. have been identified from both the gastric and<br>
enterohepatic niches of the gastrointestinal tract, where they have been associated with a wide<br>
spectrum of clinical outcomes (Fox et al, 2000; Nilsson et al, 2001).<br>
The present invention is also directed to non-H.pylori Helicobacter species, especially to<br>
enterohepatically infecting ones causing diarrheas and liver diseases. Typically these bacteria,<br>
referred as zHelicobacter (zHelicobacteria in plural), are zoonotically active infecting both human<br>
and animals, such as cattle and pets, preferred pet animals are cats and dogs. In a separate<br>
embodiment the present invention is directed to gastric infections caused by zHelicobacteria.<br>
Carbohydrates binding to the human gastric pathogen H. pylori<br>
Helicobacter pylori is the most widely studied species of the genus and is associated with gastric<br>
pathology (Hunt 1996). In particular the bacterium has the noted ability to attach to both Lewisb<br>
(Leb) (Boren et al., 1993), and Sialyl-dimeric-Lex antigens which may be extremely relevant in the<br>
maintenance of a chronic infection (Gerhard et al., 2001; Madhavi et al., 2002). Glycoconjugates,<br>
both lipid- and protein-based, have been reported to serve as receptors for the binding of this<br>
microorganism as, e.g., sialylated glycoconjugates (Evans et al., 1988), sulfatide and GM3 (Saitoh<br>
et al., 1991),polyglycosylcerarnides(Miller-Podraza et al., 1996; 1997a), lactosylceramide<br>
(Angstrom et al, 1998) and gangliotetraosylceramide (Lingwood et al, 1992; Angstrom et al.,<br>
1998). Other potential receptors for Helicobacter pylori include the polysaccharide heparan<br>
sulphate (Ascensio et al., 1993) as well as the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (Lingwood<br>
et al, 1992). Binding to lactotetraosylceramide (Teneberg, et al, 2002) and to type 2 lactosamines<br>
(PCT/FI02/00043) has been recently described.<br>
US patents of Zopf et al 5.883.079 (March 1999), 5,753,630 (May 1998) and 5,514,660 (May,<br>
1996) describe Neu5Aca3Gal- containing compounds as inhibitors of the H. pylori adhesion. The<br>
sialyl-lactose molecule inhibits Helicobacter pylori binding to human gastrointestinal cell lines<br>
(Simon et al., 1997) and is also effective in a rhesus monkey animal model of the infection<br>
(Mysore et al., 1999). The compound is in clinical trials. US patent Krivan et al. 5,446,681<br>
(November 1995) describes bacterium receptor antibiotic conjugates comprising an asialo<br>
ganglioside coupled to a penicillin antibiotic. Especially is claimed the treatment of Helicobacter<br>
pylori with the amoxicillin-asialo-GMl conjugate. The oligosaccharide sequences/glycolipids<br>
described in the invention do not belong to the ganglioseries of glycolipids. US patents of Krivan<br>
et al.;5,386,027 (January 1995) and 5,217,715 (June 1993) describe the use of oligosaccharide<br>
sequences or glycolipids to inhibit several pathogenic bacteria but Helicobacter species according<br>
to the invention were not shown.<br>
The references above list carbohydrate receptors of H. pylori, which is not the target of the present<br>
invention. The invention is further directed to the treatment of enteric diseases especially diarrhea,<br>
and hepatobiliary diseases including gall bladder stones and liver cancers.<br>
It has been established previously that both H. pylori and H. mustelae bind<br>
gangliotetraosylceramide which was confirmed in this study (Milh et al). The species are<br>
not among the zHelicobacter species according to invention but were tested as control<br>
species.<br>
WO 0 1 43751 discloses Helicobacter pylori-binding substances comprising oligosaccha-<br>
rides, such as Galß3G!cNAc and Galß3GalNAc.<br>
WO 0051644 relates to compositions containing oligosaccharides, such as LacNAc, LeX<br>
and LeY, for the treatment of conditions initiated or mediated by EPEC.<br>
WO 0033854 discloses compositions containing different oligosaccharides for the treat-<br>
ment of disorders of the digestive tract. The oligosaccharides being obtained by the hy-<br>
drolysis of one or more polysaccharides, such as [ß-(arabino)galactans, ß-(arabmo) xy-<br>
lans, ß-giucans, ß-glucomannans, [3-galactomannans. a-arabans, inulin and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Binding of pathogenic viruses and bacteria to human tissues depends on carbohydrate<br>
receptors. Several carbohydrates have been in clinical or preclinical trials for the possible<br>
effect on the inhibition of infections by pathogenic bacteria or viruses. For example, a<br>
sialylated oligosaccharide has been a candidate for the inhibition of human gastric<br>
pathogen H. pylori and another oligosaccharide has been sµggested to be effective against<br>
otitis media causing bacteria, but no results have come from the first trial after several<br>
years of studying and the other trial has also been announced to have been unsuccessful.<br>
There have also been failures with two phase 3 trials concerning oligosaccharide<br>
conjµgates inhibiting bacterial toxins. Such failures are partially related to a poor<br>
understanding on exact pathogenic mechanisms behind the diseases. The present invention<br>
includes wide studies on the receptors and molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis which<br>
allow treatment and diagnostics of multiple pathogens. Especially, the present invention is<br>
directed to the treatment of diseases such as various types of diarrheas caused by binding<br>
of E. coli and/or zoonotic Helicobacter species to human intestine.<br>
In a specific embodiment the invention can also be used for treatment of infections of<br>
cattle or pet animals. The binding specificities of animal infecting bacteria are different<br>
from those of the human pathogens. However, the general mechanisms using several<br>
specificities at the same time, and use of polyvalent conjµgates, especially soluble<br>
polyvalent conjµgates according to the invention, are also preferred for use with animals.<br>
The binding specificities are also partially cross-reactive and some of the receptor<br>
combinations described by the present invention are also useful for animal theraphies, and<br>
against some bacterial strains spread from animals such as cows. As the present invention<br>
show recentox sequences which are also described from animals living with man and<br>
probably play a role in the transfer of the infection, e.g. from cattle to human.<br>
The present invention describes carbohydrate compositions and substances which inhibit<br>
pathogens and can be used for theraphy against pathogens. Binding of pathogens such as<br>
pathogenic bacteria, toxins, viruses, fungi, or parasites to human or animal tissues depends<br>
mainly on receptor carbohydrates. (The term "pathogen cells" means herein pathogens<br>
comprising eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells such as pathogenic bacteria, fungi and<br>
parasites.) The present invention is specifically directed to the tieatment of infection by a<br>
pathogen or a pathogen cell having several binding specificities. The present invention<br>
describes carbohydrate compositions and substances which inhibit pathogens. The present<br>
carbohydrate compositions and substances can be used to inhibit the carbohydrate receptor<br>
mediated pathogen binding and prevent or inhibit the interaction. The present invention is<br>
specifically directed to the inhibiton of a pathogen cell, which bind to human/animal cell<br>
or tissue surfaces using several simultaneous binding specificities.<br>
Often the receptor carbohydrate is located on the surface of the cells of a human or animal<br>
that is infected by a pathogen. Alternatively the receptor carbohydrate is located on the<br>
surface of the pathogen and recognized by the host animal or human. The receptor<br>
carbohydrate may be recognized by carbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectins or<br>
carbohydrate binding enzymes such as glycosidases, glycosyltransferases or<br>
transglycosylating enzymes or antibodies. Alternatively two oligosaccharide sequences can<br>
recognize each other by carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions.<br>
General prevention of pathogens bv group of defined general receptors and especially<br>
using combinations of pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide sequences<br>
The present invention solves the problems of the inefficacy in therapeutical use of<br>
oligosaccharides. The invention demonstrates a simultaneous use of several binding<br>
specificities presented by common pathogens.The invention is preferably targeted to use<br>
at least two different pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide sequences, more preferably at<br>
least three different pathogen binding oligosaccharide sequences for treatment of<br>
conditions due to the presence of a pathogen. In a preferred embodiment four or more<br>
different oligosaccharide sequences are used. The present invention is specifically directed<br>
to the treatment of infection by a pathogen or a pathogen cell having several binding<br>
carbohydrate specificities. The carbohydrate binding specificities according to the present<br>
invention can be inhibited by monovalent or polyvalent carbohydrates. Preferentially, the<br>
pathogen causing the infection has at least three different inhibitable carbohydrate binding<br>
specificities and more preferably at least four inhibitable carbohydrate binding specificities<br>
which are inhibited according to the invention. The present invention is especially directed<br>
to the treatment of relevant infections when receptor oligosaccharides are present on the<br>
target tissue of pathogenesis. The preferred use of two or more oligosaccharide sequences<br>
is based on the relevance of the compositions used, feasibility of the compositions for<br>
inhibition and special synergistic effects of the compositions against one or several<br>
pathogens.<br>
The present invention is especially directed to the treatment of diarrheas caused by E. coli.<br>
The invention shows useful combinations of receptor-active oligosaccharide sequences for<br>
treatment of infections caused by diarrheagenic E.coli bacteria, especially Escherichia coli<br>
-species including EPEC (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic<br>
Escherichia coli), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli), EAEC (enteroaggregative<br>
Escherichia coli) and EIEC (enteroinvasive Escherichia coli). The present invention shows<br>
a large variety of E. coli bacterial strains and demonstrates a group of eight receptor<br>
activities which are common to all diarrhea causing E. coli bacteria. The prior art is<br>
directed to a limited number of receptor sequences and limited number of strains of<br>
specific pathogens such as EPEC or ETEC and contains conflicting data about the<br>
specificities. The differences between the E. coli strains do not allow any generalization<br>
concerning the binding specificities of different types or strains of the bacteria. The<br>
relevance of the binding specificities to larger groups of strains or the major types of E.<br>
coli can only be assessed by studying numerous strains as shown by the present invention.<br>
Precise knowledge of the binding specificities common to the major pathogens and<br>
pathogen types causing diarrheas allows rational design of effective theraphies.<br>
The present invention provides a new general treatment for diarrhea. According to the<br>
invention, the treated diarrhea is caused by E. coli, i.e. the infection is caused by the major<br>
diarrheagenic (or diarrhea causing) Escherichia coli bacteria, especially the subgroups<br>
including EPEC (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic Escherichia<br>
coli), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli), EAEC (enteroaggregative<br>
Escherichia coli) and EEC (enteroinvasive Escherichia coli). The five subgroups cover<br>
the majority of all clinically relevant diarrheas caused by diarrheagenic Kcoli. The prior<br>
art does not describe carbohydrate based theraphies for the five major types of the<br>
diarrheas caused by E. coli. The general treatment for these is especially useful because of<br>
the resistance problems developing, when traditional antibiotics are used. The<br>
carbohydrate based antiadhesion theraphies are not likely to have the same problems due<br>
to limited amounts of possible receptors in gastrointestinal system. The general broad-<br>
spectrum diarrhea therapy of the invention is also useful when the pathogen causing<br>
patient"s diarrhea is not diagnosed.<br>
According to the present invention several receptor oligosaccharide sequences are common<br>
to diarrhea causing E. coli- bacteria. These receptors are useful for diagnostics of diarrheas<br>
or for treatment of diarrheas due to a diarrheagenic E. co/i.The invention describes for the<br>
first time general effective theraphies against all major types of diarrhea causing E. coli<br>
bacteria. The present invention is especially directed to the use of at least two or several of<br>
the receptor oligosaccharides sequences to be used against diarrheagenic E. coli.<br>
Moreover, the present invention is directed to the use of specific combinations of the<br>
receptor active oligosaccharide sequences for diagnosis of diarrheagenic E. coli or for<br>
prevention or treatment of infections caused by the diarrheagenic E. coli.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the treatment of intestinal infections when a<br>
patient is infected by a bacterium resistant to traditional antibiotics. The present invention<br>
is further directed to the use of the receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the<br>
present invention in connection with traditional antibiotics to improve the therapeutic<br>
| effects thereof.<br>
This design can be used together with analysis of specific pathogen strains with regard to<br>
the eight receptor binding specificities or preferred specific subgroups thereof as described<br>
by the present invention.<br>
The present invention is also directed to general theraphies against diarrhea causing types<br>
of E. coli. Previuos inventions or studies are directed only to single types of diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli bacteria. When many strains of the different types of pathogens were<br>
studied, the eight binding specificities were for the first time shown to be common to all<br>
the major types of diarrhea causing E.coli such as EPEC (enteropathogenic Escherichia<br>
coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coif), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia<br>
coli), EAEC (enteroaggregative Escherichia coli) and EIEC (enteroinvasive Escherichia<br>
coli). The present invention is directed to the use of a single component of the eight<br>
receptor binding specificities against at least three of the types of the E. coli bacteria, more<br>
preferentially against at least against four of the E. coli types and most preferentially<br>
against all five of the E. coli types. Similarly, the present invention is directed to the use of<br>
combinations of the eight receptor binding specificities against at least three and more<br>
preferentially against all the major types of E. coli causing diarrheas.<br>
The present invention is also directed to specific combinations of the binding specificities<br>
which are especially useful for the prevention of an infection. The combinations are based<br>
on<br>
- the knowledge of the properties of oligosaccharide sequences as bacterial inhibitors<br>
• the knowledge of the presence of relevant receptor structures in intestinal epithelium<br>
• the knowledge of the different receptor levels in the infection cascade<br>
- the knowledge of the receptors specifically useful against pathogens to avoid normal<br>
flora interactions<br>
- the design of special low cost inhibitors for the binding specificities<br>
- the design of specific receptor combinations for local infections when specific strains<br>
have binding activity to a subgroup of the binding specificities<br>
The present invention is also targeted to the therapy of important but less studied E. coli<br>
types or species causing diarrheas. The invention is specifically directed to the treatment of<br>
infections caused by EAEC (enteroaggregative Escherichia coli). The invention is also<br>
directed to the treatment of diarrheas caused by EIEC (enteroinvasive Escherichia coli).<br>
These infections cause diarrheas, especially in children in developing countries and novel<br>
therapies to treat these are of importance. The need of therapeutic blocking substances for<br>
EAEC and EIEC is emphasized because the lack of the knowledge of the specificities of<br>
the bacteria.<br>
As a specific embodiment the present invention is directed to the treatment of diarrhea<br>
causing not toxin secreting pathogen, preferably non-toxin secreting E. coli. The toxin<br>
blocker oligosaccharides should not have any effect towards such pathogens. Preferably<br>
the non-toxin secreting E. coli does not secrete Gala4Gal-based carbohydrate recognizing<br>
toxins such as verotoxin. In another embodiment the non-toxin secreting E. coli does not<br>
express heat labile toxin. The non-toxin secreting E. coli is preferably EPEC, EAEC, or<br>
EEC, more preferably EAEC or EIEC.<br>
The present invention surprisingly finds out that Gala4Gal carbohydrates can be used for<br>
inhibition of non-toxin secreting E. coli. The present invention is directed to use the globo-<br>
receptors alone for inhibition of tissue binding of any type of E. coli and more preferably<br>
for the treatment of non-toxin secreting E. coli. In a preferred embodiment the present<br>
invention is directed to inhibition of binding of a toxin secreting pathogen preferably<br>
pathogenic E. coli or zHelicobacter by an oligosaccharide according to the invention<br>
specifically inhibiting the binding of the pathogen in absence of the toxin binding to the<br>
oligosaccharide and in another embodiment the invention is direacted to the treatment of<br>
the infection and removal of the pathogen in the presence of the toxin binding to the<br>
inhibitor oligosaccharide.<br>
The group of eight binding specificities described contain novel receptors for the less<br>
studied E. coli types and species. The present invention is directed to the use of these<br>
receptors alone and as a part of compositions against the specific types of E. coli. In a<br>
preferred embodiment at least two or at least three oligosaccharide receptor types are used<br>
against the EAEC and/or EIEC. The present invention is also directed to the use of specific<br>
combinations of the receptor oligosaccharide species according to the present invention<br>
against EAEC and/or EIEC.<br>
The present invention is also targeted to novel therapeutic oligosaccharides and<br>
oligosaccharide combinations against ETEC.<br>
The present invention is also targeted to novel therapeutic oligosaccharides and<br>
oligosaccharide combinations against EPEC.<br>
The present invention is also targeted to novel therapeutic oligosaccharides and<br>
oligosaccharide combinations against EHEC.<br>
Preferred diarrhea-diseases to be treated according to the present invention include for<br>
example watery diarrheas, bloody diarrheas and severe diarrheas. The specific indications<br>
further include traveller"s diarrhea, children"s diarrheas especially in developing countries<br>
and severe diarrhea related diseases including hemorrhagic diarrhea, haemolytic uremic<br>
syndrome (HUS), especially when caused by EHEC. The present invention is also directed<br>
to the treatment of persistent diarrheas, especially when caused by EAEC. The persistent<br>
diarrheas specifically mean diarrheas lasting 14 days or longer. The present invention is<br>
also directed to shigellosis like diarrheas, especially when caused by EIEC. The shigellosis<br>
type diarrheas resemble very closely diseases caused by Shigella spp. (and pathogens<br>
causing them resemble very closely Shigella spp.) including watery and bloody diarrheas.<br>
It may be difficult or impossible to differentiate shigellosis and EIEC infections. The<br>
traveller"s diarrhea is a common infection especially for persons travelling in developing<br>
countries and it is caused by several types of E. coli, especially ETECs.<br>
In developing countries hundreds of millions of children get infected by diarrhea causing<br>
E. coli. The children diarrheas of developing countries are specifically caused by multiple<br>
types of E. coli including EPEC (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli), ETEC<br>
(enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli), EAEC<br>
(enteroaggregative Escherichia colt) and EIEC (enteroinvasive Escherichia coli). There is<br>
currently no general specific treatment for the diarrheas. Increasing resistance to traditional<br>
antibiotics is an increasing problem.The present invention is especially directed for the<br>
treatments and analysis of children"s diarrheas in developing countries. For treatment of<br>
children"s diarrheas in developing countries, the therapeutical compositions and substances<br>
may be included in hydration solutions (for example comprising salt and sucrose) used for<br>
treatments of diarrheas. The therapeutical compositions may also be used together with<br>
charcoal tablets or mixed in the charcoal tablets. The compositions and substances<br>
according to the invention can be used in combination of traditional theraphies of<br>
infections, especially treatments of gastrointestinal infections such as diarrheas caused by<br>
E. coli.<br>
The present invention further directed to generally milder infection not involving the<br>
EHEC bacteria. The generally milder infections are preferably not treated with traditional<br>
antibiotics. Milder infections may be produced by ETEC, EAEC, and EIEC strains.<br>
Previously sµggested but clinically unsuccessful therapy of EHEC-diarrheas by toxin<br>
blocking Globotriose-silica was not inhibiting the binding of the bacteria to natural<br>
glycolipid receptors. The present invention showed that the Globo-binding is extremely<br>
rare or non-existetn among EHECs. This forms an exeption of the general binding<br>
specificitie of the diarrhea causing E. coli.<br>
Preferred general oligosaccharide receptor groups useful for treatment of infections caused<br>
bv E. coli and other diarrhea causing bacteria<br>
The present invention discloses common structural motifs of the receptor subtypes of<br>
diarrhea causing E. coli. One receptor group is based on common structure<br>
Gaiß3/4Glc(NAc)o-i, this backbone epitope includes lactose (GalßMGlc) and similar<br>
lactose-amines Gaiß3GlcNAc (type 1 lactosamine, Lacto receptors), Gal|34GlcNAc (type 2<br>
lactosamine, Neolacto receptors). The backbone epitopes as such are not very effective or<br>
are practically inactive as disasaccharides. The present invention disloses the presence of<br>
several combinations of activated structures based on the backbone structures. However,<br>
the present invention is preferably targeted to the natural types of the activated receptor<br>
epitopes present on the human tissues. These structures are especially preferred as<br>
therapeutics produced from these are not likely to toxic and natural enzymes exist for<br>
production of the receptors.<br>
The lactose epitope and the N-acetylactosamine structures form a common scaffold which<br>
is recognized similarity by numerous lectins and enzymes in glycobiology. The<br>
disaccharide epitopes share common conformations in interactions with proteins<br>
recognizing galactosylated structures. For example human fucosyltransferase III can<br>
recognize all three sequences as acceptors. The present invention notices that the<br>
disaccharide sequences can be activated by various natural modifications of glycans. The<br>
activator parts may be linked to the galactose residue or to the glucopyranose structure<br>
which may carry N-acetylmodification. The modifications direct the carbohydrate<br>
inhibitors to various receptors on the bacterium. The inventors found out that certain<br>
combinations of the active receptor blocking carbohydrates are needed for effective<br>
blocking of the pathogens.<br>
The receptor backbone structure is activated by various derivatizations such as elongation<br>
from the reducing end by p3-linkage to galactose or to lactose or to another lactosamine,<br>
especially with type 1 and type 2 lactosamine giving naturally occurring structures such as<br>
Gaip4GlcNAcp3Galß4Glc (Lacto-N-neotetraose), Galp3GlcNAcp3Galp4Glc (Lacto-N-<br>
tetraose), Galp4GlcNAc|J3Gal, and Gaiß3GlcNAcP3Gal. Furthermore, the receptor<br>
backbone structure may be activated by a ceramide structure, comprising a specific<br>
hydroxyfatty acid (as described for H, pylori in Angstrdm et al. 1998), this was<br>
demostrated by the special Lactosylceramides described here as Lactosylceramide binding.<br>
Furthermore the Lactosamine, especially Gaiß4GlcNAc, or lactose structures can be<br>
activated by adding specific natural monosaccharides to the non-reducing end. A specially<br>
activating nonreducing end terminal structures includes sialic acids preferably NeuNAc or<br>
NeuGc linked with a3- or a6-linkage, in a preferred embodiment with a6-linkage. The<br>
most preferred structures of the sialic acid binding includes sialyl-lactoses<br>
NeuNAca6Gaiß4Glc, NeuNAca3Galp4Glc, NeuGca6Gaiß4Glc, NeuGca3Gaiß4Glc and<br>
corresponding sialylalactosamines NeuNAca6Galfi4GlcNAc, NeuNAca3Gaip4GlcNAc,<br>
NeuGca6Gaip4GlcNAc, NeuGca3Galß4GlcNAc, and even the elongated LNT and LNnT<br>
based forms of these. Even truncated sialic acid epitopes have binding activity towards E.<br>
coli. The N-glycolylneuraminic acid was especially strongly activating structure.<br>
The other activating structures at the non-reducing end side are GalNAcp4 or<br>
Gaip3GalNAc|34 giving natural type receptor structures described here as specific group<br>
Ganglio-receptors. Furthermore the activating structure at the non-reducing end side also<br>
includes Galo4 and GalNAc|33Gala4 giving natural type receptors called Globo-receptors.<br>
Ganglio and globoreceptors have activity even as terminal diasaccharides. A preferred<br>
form of the Globo-receptor is therefore classified as a-linked Hexose-receptors, including<br>
the minimal structure GaUx4Gal.<br>
The inventors further notice that the lactosamine receptors, especially Neolacto-receptors<br>
may represent terminal GlcNAcp3-structures.<br>
The present invention is further directed to activation of type 1 lactosamine by Fuca4-<br>
structure linked to the GlcNAc forming so called Lewis a structure Gaip3(Fucct4)GlcNAc.<br>
The Fucosyl-receptors are especially preferred with reducing activating structures such as<br>
lactosylceramide.<br>
The activation by the terminal Gala4-structure was shown to be so effective that the<br>
Gala4Gal-structure is active even without the reducing end Glc/GlcNAc. The minimal<br>
activating epitope is thus Gala4Gal, more preferably Gala4Gaip. This structure shares the<br>
common Gal-structure and is also active as trisaccharide epitopes such as Gala4Gal(34Glc<br>
and Gala4Gaip4GlcNAc. The present invention is further directed to partial epitopes<br>
Neu5Gca3Gal, Neu5Aca6Gal, Neu5Gca6Gal and Neu5Aca3Gal and in a separate<br>
embodiment to GalNAcP4Gal.<br>
Beside the lactosamine receptors the present invention describes specifically Gala4Gal-<br>
receptors and Mana3/6Man receptors. The two alpha-linked-hexose receptor types are<br>
especially preferred because these are low cost natural receptors.<br>

Use of the preferred structure as single substances<br>
The present invention is specifically directed to use a single substance according to<br>

inhibitors of bacterial adhesion. The results showed that the Globo-receptors, Lacto-<br>
receptors, sialic acid receptors and Neolacto-receptors are inhibitable at low concentrations<br>
specifically by corresponding monovalent oligosaccharides. The use of the free<br>
monovalent specific oligosaccharides as inhibitors of adhesion of diarrhea causing E. coli<br>
has not previously been demonstrated. Furthermore active combinations of the free<br>
preferred oligosaccharides were shown, for example the mixtures of globo-<br>
oligosaccharides, LNnT, and sialyl-oligosaccharides were shown to be active low<br>
concentration inhibitors in simultaneously on diarrhea causing E. coli. The present<br>
invention also shows first time the simultaneous presence of multiple binding activities on<br>
a specific diarrheagenic E.coli. Furthermore these form a structurally defined group of<br>
activated lactose structures effective aGalnst different receptor structures of human<br>
diarrheagenic bacteria.<br>

Alternatively the Globo-receptors may be other terminal Gala4Gal-sequences.<br>
Of the frequent binding specifities the Globo-receptors represent especially strong binding<br>
and stabile binding. The Sialyl-receptors, Lacto-receptors, and Neolacto-receptors are also<br>
preferred because of the stabile and strong bindings indicating increased importance during<br>
infections. The inventors were also able to show that the binding specificities toward the<br>
corresponding glycolipid sequences are inhibitable even by low concentrations of<br>
monovalent oligosaccharides. The preferred frequent binding specificities include<br>

The data of the invention was mainly obtained by using numerous different strains of<br>
diarrhea causing E. coli. The generality of the intestinal receptors was further studied with<br>
several types of zoonotic Helicobacter species. The inventors were able to find at least five<br>
overlapping binding specificities with the E. coli specificities. These include<br>
Lactosylceramide-receptors, Lacto-receptors, Neolacto-receptors, Ganglio-receptors and<br>
Sialic acid receptors. These receptors are likely to be common with human and many pet<br>
and cattle animals.<br>
General receptors with activity aGalnst potentially zoonotic ß4thogens<br>
The group of receptors is preferred as "general receptors" m. diarrheas with zoonotic<br>
potential. The most stable expression of the general receptors was shown by the neutral<br>
galactose based receptors. Among this family lactose/lactosamine receptors form a special<br>

For effective treatment of emerging and present diarrheagenic ß4thogens the all eight<br>
receptor specificities are useful. When the ß4thogen is not E. coli the general presence of<br>
mannose binding is demonstrated in the prior art works with Salmonella. The present<br>
invention allows to predict that the Gala4Gal-oligosaccharide sequence including binding<br>
specificities and even the Fucosyl-receptor type binding specificities will be found in<br>
human intestinal ß4thogen causing diarrheas.<br>
When considering together the preferred receptor groups, the Lacto-receptors and<br>
Neolacto-receptors belong to first contact receptors, frequent receptos and general<br>
receptors. This makes the use and combined use of the Lacto- and Neolacto-receptors<br>
especially in activated forms such as LNT and LNnT especially preferred according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The inventors characterized eight different binding specificities to a large number of<br>
diarrhea causing E. coli bacteria and several corresponding receptors in human intestinal<br>
tissues. The oligosaccharide sequences include one or several of the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences selected from the following groups:<br>
Eight seß4rate receptor oligosaccharide sequences of intestinal ß4thogens:<br>
a) Lactosylceramide receptors: for example binding to lactosylceramide and<br>
isoglobotriaosylceramide when the ceramides comprise hydroxylfatty acids.<br>
b) Ganglio-receptors: for example binding to gangliotriaosylceramide and<br>
gangliotetraosylceramide.<br>
c) Gala4Gal-receptors: for example binding to galabiaosylceramide,<br>
globotriaosylceramide, globotetraosylceramide and the Forssman<br>
glycosphingolipid.<br>
d) Lacto-receptors: for example binding to lactotetraosylceramide.<br>

with different sialic acid, especially N-acetylneuraminic acid NeuAca- and/or N-<br>
glycolymeuraminic acid, NeuGca.<br>
g) Mannose receptors: represented by the Mana3(Mana6)Man-neoglycolipid.<br>
Preferred oligosaccharide sequences among the receptor groups<br>
The present invention is preferentially directed to the use of a free oligosaccharide or<br>
derivatives thereof which are not glycolipids except for the hydroxylfatty acid comprising<br>
lactosylceramide glycolipids as described below. In general the glycolipids may diffuse to<br>
tissues and actually increase ß4thogen binding and the formulations to prevent this are<br>
considered difficult to produce. The hydroxyl group in the ceramides of the<br>
lactosylceramide glycolipids according to the present invention allows stronger contact<br>
between the glycolipids which would more effectively keep these together for example in<br>
membrane-like formulations and avoid diffusion to intestinal epithelium. The preferred<br>
polyvalent conjuGates described by the invention are not neoglycoproteins such as albumin<br>
conjuGates which are potent immunogens and can be used in causing immune responses.<br>
The polyvalent conjuGates according to the present invention are preferably non-<br>
immunogenic and preferably do not contain immunogenic protein or peptide ß4rts.<br>
Lactosvlceramide receptors<br>
The lactosylceramide receptors of the diarrhea causing E. coli depend on the presence of<br>
hydroxyl fatty acid on the ceramide. The present invention is directed to the use of<br>
lactosylceramides comprising hydroxy fatty acids aGalnst E. coli infections. The<br>
lactosylceramide receptors according to the present invention means a lactose residue<br>
comprising molecule in which lactosyl residue is linked to a ceramide structure comprising<br>
a natural type of hydroxylfatty acid or alternatively lactosylceramide receptor means<br>
mimetic structure of lactosylceramide in which the lactosyl residue is linked to a hydroxyl<br>
group comprising a ceramide-mimicking structure. The hydroxyl group of the hydroxyl<br>
fatty acid or ceramide mimicking structure preferentially forms a hydrogen bond with Glc-<br>
residues linked to ceramide or ceramide-mimicking structure. The lactosylceramide or<br>
mimetic structure can be substituted at position 3 or 4 of the Gal residue by natural type<br>
oligosaccharide sequences. The lactosylceramide receptor glycolipids also includes lacto-<br>
and neolactoseries glycolipids comprising a hydroxyl fatty acid. In other embodiments the<br>
present invention is also directed to the use of globo- and ganglioseries glycolipids<br>
comprising a lactosyl residue and a hydroxylfatty acid. The present invention is also<br>
directed to the use of analogs of lacto- or neolactoseries oligosaccharide sequences linked<br>
to the hydroxyl group comprising ceramide-mimicking structure. The present invention is<br>
also directed to the use of analogs of globo- or ganglioseries oligosaccharide sequences<br>
linked to the hydroxyl group comprising ceramide-mimicking structure. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the invention is directed to the use of non-sialylated forms of<br>
lactosylceramide receptors according to the present invention. The preferred embodiments<br>
include molecules according to the following Formula<br>
RixGalß4GlcßR2 (X)<br>
wherein x is linkage position 3 or 4,<br>
R2 is ceramide comprising a hydroxyl fatty acid or an analog of a ceramide comprising a<br>
hydroxyl fatty acid and<br>
Ri is Gala, Galp, GalNAcß, GlcNAcß or longer oligosaccharide comprising one of these<br>
residues at the reducing end or NeuSXa with the proviso that when R2 is GlcNAcß or<br>
NeuSXa then x is 3 and Neu5X is sialic acid preferably NeuSAc or NeuSGc.<br>
The present invention is directed to substances and compositions comprising polyvalent<br>
conjuGates of lactosylceramide receptor and especially polyvalent conjuGates of a mimetic<br>
structure of lactosylceramide according to the present invention. Especially polyvalent<br>
conjuGates of mimetic structures of lactosylceramide are preferred when the<br>
lactosylceramide or mimetic structure of lactosylceramide is linked to a polysaccharide,<br>
optionally throuGh a sß4cer group. In a specific embodiment the use of polyvalent<br>
conjuGates are preferred over the use of lactosylceramide glycolipids. Use of glycolipids is<br>
more difficult as there is need to prevent the diffusion of the receptors to tissues. The<br>
prevention can be, however, achieved for example by incorporating the glycolipids in<br>
medical carbon matrix or in a stabile membrane or micellar structures.<br>
It is realized that two or even three or more receptor binding specificities according to the<br>
invention can be presented by a single lactosylceramide receptor.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the use of lactosylceramide comprising<br>
hydroxylfatty acids and analogs and derivatives thereof for therapy of gastrointestinal<br>
diseases, especially diarrheas and more specifically diarrheas caused by E. coli bacteria. In<br>
preferred embodiments the infection is caused by ETEC, EPEC, EHEC, EIEC, or EAEC,<br>
more preferentially hy EHEC, EIEC or EAEC. In a preferred embodiment the present<br>
invention is directed to the use of a milk fraction comprising lactosylceramide comprising<br>
a hydroxylfatty acid. The milk is preferentially from a dairy animal such as a cow or any<br>
other dairy animal or milk producing animal which produces hydroxyl fatty acid-<br>
containing lactosylceramide. The prior art discussed above has been directed to the use of<br>
some milk glycolipids but the prior art does not realize the usefulness of the hydroxylfatty<br>
acid-containing glycolipids aGalnst diarrhea-causing E. coli bacteria. The lactosylceramide<br>
receptors according to the present invention are especially useful for functional food or<br>
feeds as nutritional additives.<br>
Ganglio-receptors<br>
Preferred ganglioseries receptor comprises oligosaccharide sequences according to the<br>
Formula<br>
[Galß3]nlGalNAc[ß4Gal {ß4Glc}n2]n3 (XI)<br>
wherein nl, n2 and n3 are independently integers 0 or 1, preferably with the proviso that at<br>
least nl or n3 is 1 and with the proviso that no sialic acids are linked to the oligosaccharide<br>
sequence.<br>
The preferred oligosaccharide sequences are Galß3GalNAcß4Gal|34Glc,<br>
Galß3GalNAcß4Gal, Galß3GalNAc, GalNAcß4Gal and GalNAcß4Galß4Glc. Even GM1<br>
oligosaccharide sequence can be used according to the present invention in novel<br>
combination therapies but it is less preferred due to complexity of the structure.<br>
The screening of wide variety of ganglioseries and comß4rison of the structures in<br>
examples of the present invention allows the determination of Gal|33GalNAc as a novel<br>
preferred novel receptor oligosaccharide sequences of the ganglioseries receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences. The data indicates that even terminal Galß3GalNAc in GM1-<br>
sequence can bind to diarrhea causing E. coli. The binding to the terminal disaccharide has<br>
previously not been demonstrated and the tetrasaccharide epitopes may be used in<br>
formulations which allows more effective presentation of the terminal disaccharide.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the Galß3GalNAc is preferably not ß4<br>
linked to lactose. The disaccharide epitope is in general cheaper to produce than the<br>
tetrasacharide epitope. More preferably the oligosaccharide sequence is Galß3GalNAcP<br>
with proviso that the disaccharide epitope is not linked to lactose or Galß3GalNAcß4Gal,<br>
with proviso that the reducing end Gal is not linked to glucose.<br>
The novel ganglio receptors comprise the terminal disaccharide Galß3GalNAc with the<br>
proviso that the disaccharide is not ß4 linked to lactose. The disaccharide epitope is, in<br>
general, cheaper to produce than the tetrasacharide epitope. More preferably, the<br>
oligosaccharide sequence is Galß3GalNAcP with the proviso that the disaccharide epitope<br>
is not linked to lactose or Galß3GalNAcß4Gal, with the proviso that the reducing end Gal<br>
is not linked to glucose. The terminal disaccharide and trisaccharide sequences have not<br>
been previously described as receptors for diarrhea causing E. coli bacteria nor as receptors<br>
for EPEC-bacteria. The use of terminal disaccharides is preferred to the known<br>
tetrasaccharide receptors because of the more cost-effective synthesis.<br>
Galot4Gal- receptors<br>
Preferred epitopes of the invention are Gala4Gal, Gala4Gal|34Glc and<br>
Gala4Galß4GlcNAc. The present invention also shows that 3"-substituted forms of<br>

the proviso that either nl is 1 or n3 is 1 and the GalNAc residue is optionally further<br>
substituted by other monosaccharide or oligosaccharide residues, preferably similar to<br>
natural oligosaccharide sequences such as Forssman antigen. More preferred<br>
oligosaccharide receptors are Gala4Gal, Gala4Galß4Glc and Gala4Galß4GlcNAc as<br>
these are synthetically more simple to produce, disaccharide Gala4Gal and pectin based<br>
oligosaccharide sequences according to the invention or other similar natural<br>

least n3 is 1. Most preferred oligosaccharide sequences referred here as high affinity<br>
receptors include oligosaccharide sequences Galß3GlcNAcß3Gal,<br>
Galß3GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc, Galß3GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAc and<br>

Galß3(Fuca4)GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc and/or GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc, is<br>
especially preferred for therapeutical uses and especially for food, feed, and other<br>
nutritional uses.<br>
The present invention finds out that the whole LNT sequence Galß3GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc is<br>
preferably used for effective inhibition of the Lacto binding. Data in examples showed that<br>
the disaccharide epitope Galß3GlcNAc, suGgested in the prior art, alone could not support<br>
effective binding similarily as the epitope in the corresponding glycolipid. When the<br>
binding epitope was blocked by p6-GlcNAc in a neoglycolipid structure. The present<br>
invention is specifically directed to the use of Galß3GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc as monovalent<br>
inhibitor and as soluble polyvalent inhibitor of diarrhea causing E. coli. It is realized that<br>
the substance can be useful even as a single substance as it is a frequent binding<br>
specificity.<br>
Neolacto-receptors<br>
Preferred neolacto series receptors comprise one or several oligosaccharide sequences<br>
according to the Formula<br>

reducing terminal GlcNAc according to the formula can be further substituted by another<br>
monosaccharide residue or oligosaccharide residues, preferably by Galß4 or<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4. In preferred embodiments of the invention at least n4 is 1 or nl is 1.<br>
Most preferred oligosaccharide sequences referred here as high affinity receptors include<br>

neolactotetraose Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc is especially preferred for therapeutical uses<br>
and especially for food, feed, and other nutritional uses.<br>
The present invention finds out that the whole LNnT sequence Galß4GlcNAcß3Gal(34Glc<br>
is preferably used for effective inhibition of the Neolacto binding. Data in examples<br>
showed that the disaccharide epitope Galß4GlcNAc, suGgested in the prior art, alone could<br>
not support effective binding. The branched<br>
Galß4GlcNAcß3(Galß4GlcNAcp6)Galß4GlcpCer could not support the binding even<br>
there is two of the disaccharide epitopes as the middle galactose is blocked by the branch.<br>
When the binding epitope was changed by a p6-structure in neoglycolipids<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc to GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcp6Galß4Glc the binding<br>
was also very much weakened. The present invention is specifically directed to the use of<br>
Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc and GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc as monovalent<br>
inhibitor and as soluble polyvalent inhibitor of diarrhea causing E. coli. It is realized that<br>

specificity.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to uses of neolacto binding sequences<br>
comprising terminal-GlcNAc structures such as GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAc and<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc. It is realized that even the terminal disaccharide<br>
sequence GlcNAcß3Gal can be used according to the invention, thouGh with less activity.<br>
It is also found for the first time that linear ß3-linked poly-N-acetyllactoasmines,<br>
Galß4GlcNAc[ß3Galß4GlcNAc]nß3Galß4Glc where in n is integer and n&gt;=l, are<br>

Results about the binding specificities of diarrhea causing Helicobacter species<br>
The major aim of the present invention is to provide therapies for diarrheas caused by<br>
various types of ß4thogens. The inventor chose diarrhea causing Helicobacter species to<br>
reveal receptor types which could be shared with totally different types of bacteria and<br>
could be involved even zoonotic infections spreading from other species. The zoonotic<br>
Helicobacter species are targets for developing also animal therapies, especially for<br>
preventing zoonotic infections. The present invention finds out special classes of receptors<br>
which are associated with risk of zoonotic infections. These include a family of galactose<br>
based receptors with possible sialic acid modifications.<br>
The present invention is also related to non~H.pylori Helicobacter species, especially to<br>
enteroheß4tically infecting ones causing diarrheas and liver diseases. Typically these bacteria,<br>
referred as zHelicobacter (zHelicobacteria in plural), are zoonotically active infecting both human<br>
and animals, such as cattle and pets, preferred pet animals are cats and dogs. In a seß4rate<br>
embodiment the present invention is directed to the treatment of gastric infections caused by<br>
zHelicobacteria. The prior art is directed to different species of gastric bacteria such as H. pylori,<br>
H. mustelae (a non-zoonotic gastric ß4thogen of ferrets), and various non-Helicobacter species<br>
infecting the intestinal tract such as various types of Escherichia coli causing diarrheas. Different<br>
species of bacteria have different binding specificities and the receptors of zHelicobacteria are not<br>
known from prior art. Especially big differences could be expected between bacteria infecting<br>
different localizations in gastrointestinal tract or belonging to totally different families such as<br>
Helicobacter and E. coli. The present invention revealed different binding specificity profiles<br>
between zHelicobacter and H. pylori. The zoonotic bacteria reveal a specific group of receptors of<br>
zoonotic bacteria.<br>
The group of zHelicobacter does not include species-specific human Helicobacter pylori.<br>
The present invention is further not directed to the infection of ferrets by H. mustelae as<br>
this is not an infection of a pet animal or cattle with a risk of zoonosis due to contact with<br>
human. The zHelicobacteria are infecting human and/or, preferably and, pet animals of<br>
human and have zoonotic caß4city to infect humans, especially persons with weak immune<br>
system. The present invention characterizes the carbohydrate binding specificities of<br>
zHelicobacter which are able to mediate the cross-species infective actions of the bacteria.<br>
Overview of results<br>
The inventors analysed binding specificities of several zHelicobacter species towards a<br>
library of glycolipids in a TLC-overlay assay.<br>
It has been established previously that both H. pylori and H. mustelae bind<br>
gangliotetraosylceramide binding was demonstrated for H.felis, H. canis and H. heß4ticus<br>
and H. bilis (Table 3). Furthermore, in common with H. pylori we found that both gastric<br>
and enteroheß4tic Helicobacter spp. tested were caß4ble of binding to<br>
lactotetraosylceramide, lactosylceramide with phytosphingosine and/or hydroxy fatty acids<br>
and isoglobotriaosylceramide. In contrast, binding to Leb glycosphingolipid was only<br>
observed for H. pylori CCuG 17875 (Table 3).<br>
The binding of certain H. pylori strains to slow-migrating gangliosides in the acid<br>
glycosphingolipid fraction of human granulocytes is sialic acid-dependent (Miller-Podraza<br>
et al., 1999), and this fraction was therefore used as an indicator of sialic acid-recognition.<br>
The sialylated structures in human granulocytes are mainly NeuNAca3Gal- and<br>
NeuNAca6Gal. Binding to this fraction was noted for H. heß4ticus CCuG 33637<br>
(exemplified in Fig. 4B. lane 1) and H. pylori CCuG 17874 and occasionally for H.<br>
mustelae CCuG 25715 (Table 3). Sialic acid binding caß4city assayed by other substances<br>
is also present in some species oiH. bilis.<br>
The zHelicobacter species were further observed to bind a linear polylactosamine<br>
glycolipid. The binding epitope is in the polylactosamine backbone as the removal of the<br>
specific terminal does not essentially effect the binding.<br>
The present invention noticed that the carbohydrate specificities are also observable by<br>
various other methods in addition to the glycolipid assays. The binding were observable by<br>
assay involving protein type glycoconjuGates even in cell based assay including traditional<br>
cell assay with cells from various species. These assays give results supporting the analysis<br>
of glycolipids.<br>

The present invention is also directed to the use of the five receptor types in combination<br>
so that at least 2 receptors are used. It is also preferred to use any of the receptor subtypes<br>
together with another receptor type. It is preferred to use Lactose receptor together with<br>
lactosamine receptor and/or ganglio-receptor and/or sialic acid receptor. It is further<br>
preferred to use Lactose/lactosamine receptor together with a ganglioreceptor and/or sialic<br>
acid receptor.<br>
The present invention relates to a therapeutical composition comprising a purified<br>
fractions) of at least one, and in another embodiments of at least two or at least three<br>
compounds being or containing a ß4thogen inhibiting oligosaccharide sequence. When<br>
several oligosaccharide sequences are used, these are preferably selected from at least two,<br>
and in another embodiment from at least two, of the groups of ß4thogen receptors<br>
described above.<br>
Lactose receptors<br>
In broadest sense lactose receptors are structures comprising oligosaccharide sequence<br>
Galß4Glc. In a preferred embodiment lactose receptors are lactosylceramide receptors<br>
wherein the lactose structure is linked to a ceramide. More preferably there is a hydroxyl<br>
fatty acid structure present on the ceramide. The present invention is especially directed to<br>
the use of lactose receptors especially lactosylceramides comprising hydroxy fatty acids<br>
aGalnst zHelicobacter infections.<br>
The lactosylceramide receptors according to the present invention means a lactose residue<br>
comprising molecule in which lactosyl residue is linked to a ceramide structure comprising<br>
a natural type of hydroxylfatty acid or alternatively lactosylceramide receptor means a<br>
mimetic structure of lactosylceramide in which the lactosyl residue is linked to a hydroxyl<br>
group comprising a ceramide-mimicking structure. The hydroxyl group of the hydroxyl<br>
fatty acid or ceramide mimicking structure preferentially forms a hydrogen bond with Glc-<br>
residues linked to ceramide or ceramide-mimicking structure. The lactosylceramide or<br>
mimetic structure can be substituted at position 3 or 4 of the Gal residue by natural type<br>
oligosaccharide sequences. The lactosylceramide receptor glycolipids also includes lacto-<br>
and/or neolactoseries glycolipids comprising a hydroxyl fatty acid. In other embodiments<br>
the present invention is also directed to the use of lacto- and/or neolacto- and/or<br>
ganglioseries glycolipids comprising a lactosyl residue and a hydroxylfatty acid. The<br>
present invention is also directed to the use of analogs of lacto- or neolactoseries<br>
oligosaccharide sequences linked to the hydroxyl group comprising ceramide-mimicking<br>
structure. The present invention is also directed to the use of analogs of ganglioseries<br>
oligosaccharide sequences linked to the hydroxyl group comprising ceramide-mimicking<br>
structure. In a preferred embodiment the invention is directed to the use of non-sialylated<br>
forms of lactosylceramide receptors according to the present invention. The preferred<br>
embodiments include molecules according to the following Formula<br>
R,xGalß4GlcpR2 (XIX)<br>
wherein x is linkage position 3 or 4,<br>
R2 is ceramide comprising a hydroxyl fatty acid or an analog of a ceramide comprising a<br>
hydroxyl fatty acid and<br>
Ri is Gala, Galp, GalNAcp, GlcNAcp or longer oligosaccharide comprising one of these<br>
residues at the reducing end or NeuSXa with the proviso that preferably when Ri is<br>
GlcNAcß or Gala or NeuSXa then x is 3 and Neu5X is sialic acid preferably NeuSAc or<br>
Neu5Gc.<br>
The present invention is also directed to substances and compositions comprising<br>
polyvalent conjuGates of lactose receptor according to the invention and especially<br>
polyvalent conjuGates of a mimetic structure of lactosylceramide according to the present<br>
invention. Especially polyvalent conjuGates of mimetic structures of lactosylceramide are<br>
preferred when the lactosylceramide or mimetic structure of lactosylceramide is linked to a<br>
polysaccharide, optionally throuGh a sß4cer group. In a specific embodiment the use of<br>
polyvalent conjuGates are preferred over the use of lactosylceramide glycolipids. Use of<br>
glycolipids is more difficult as there is need to prevent the diffusion of the receptors to<br>
tissues. The prevention can be, however, achieved for example by incorporating the<br>
glycolipids in medical carbon matrix or in a stabile membrane or micellar structures.<br>
It is realized that two or even three or more receptor binding specificities according to the<br>
invention can be presented by a single lactosylceramide receptor.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the use of lactosylceramide comprising<br>
hydroxylfatty acids and analogs and derivatives thereof for therapy of gastrointestinal<br>
diseases, especially diarrheas and heß4tobiliary diseases and more specifically diseases<br>
caused by zHelicobacter bacteria. In a preferred embodiment the present invention is<br>
directed to the use of a milk fraction comprising lactosylceramide comprising a<br>
hydroxylfatty acid. The milk is preferentially from a dairy animal such as a cow or any<br>
other dairy animal or milk producing animal which produces hydroxyl fatty acid-<br>
containing lactosylceramide. The prior art discussed above has been directed to the use of<br>
some milk glycolipids but the prior art does not realize the usefulness of the hydroxylfatty<br>
acid-containing glycolipids aGalnst diarrhea-causing zHelicobacter bacteria. The<br>
lactosylceramide receptors according to the present invention are especially useful for<br>
functional food or feeds as nutritional additives.<br>
Use of ß4rtial olieosaccharide sequences<br>
In a seß4rate embodiment one or several of the oligosaccharide sequences according to the<br>
present invention is/are replaced by a ß4rtial oligosaccharide sequences. The ß4rtial<br>
oligosaccharide sequence is in general less effective but can be used in higher<br>
concentrations. The ß4rtial oligosaccharide sequences are preferentially monosaccharides<br>
and more preferentially non-reducing pyranose formed monosaccharide residues having<br>
the same anomeric sructure as a terminal monosaccharide residue in a oligosaccharide<br>
sequence according to the present invention, more preferably the non-reducing pyranose<br>
formed monosaccharide residue is linked to a polyhydroxyl substance ß4rtially mimicking,<br>
next monosaccharide of the corresponding oligosaccharide sequence. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the polyhydroxyl susbtance is a non-carbohydrate substance and most<br>
preferreably the polyhydroxyl substance is a flexible hydrophilic linker described by<br>
Formula 2 in this invention. Preferred ß4rtial oligosaccharide sequences include polyvalent<br>
conjuGates and soluble polyvalent conjuGates of the ß4rtial oligosaccharide sequences as<br>
described for the other receptor oligosaccharide sequences.<br>
The ß4rtial oligosaccharide sequence is preferentially Mana, and more preferentially non-<br>
reducing pyranose formed Mana linked to a polyhydroxyl substance ß4rtially mimicking<br>
next monosaccharide of the corresponding oligosaccharide sequence. In another<br>
embodiment the ß4rtial oligosaccharide sequences is chosen from the group NeuNAca,<br>
Galß, Gala, Fuca, GlcNAcP and terminal oligosaccharide sequence Fucca4GlcNAc<br>
optionally linked to a polyhydroxyl substance ß4rtially mimicking next monosaccharide of<br>
the corresponding oligosaccharide sequence. The partial oligosacharide sequences are<br>
preferably used together with low cost oligosaccharide sequences. Preferably one ß4rtial<br>
oligosaccharide sequence in pyranose form is used together with at least one, and<br>
preferably with two oligosaccharide sequences, and most preferably with three<br>
oligosaccharide sequences, according to the present invention. In another embodiment at<br>
least two partial oligosaccharide sequences are used with at least one oligosaccharide<br>
sequence according to the present invention. The partial oligosaccharide sequences are<br>
preferred for therapeutic uses according to the present invention, especially for feed and<br>
food uses.<br>
Defining most relevant carbohydrate binding specificities with regard to the natural<br>
infection cascade<br>
As described below any carbohydrate specificity or specificities present on a pathogen cell<br>
surface can be used to inhibit the binding of a pathogen, for example by soluble polyvalent<br>
carbohydrates using the covering method as described by the present invention.<br>
However, it is especially preferred to target such carbohydrate binding specificities which<br>
are directed to relevant receptors on the tissue which is infected. This is a preferred method<br>
when monovalent substances according to the invention are used. When soluble polyvalent<br>
conjuGates are used for inhibition of a pathogen cell, and the most relevant carbohydrate<br>
specificities are used the polyvalent or even oligovalent conjuGate need not be large like<br>
the conjuGates which are used for achieving the sterical inhibition of other receptor<br>
interactions according to the invention. The present invention demonstrates several novel<br>
carbohydrate receptor structures on glycoproteins of human intestine and connects these to<br>
the binding specificitities shown by assays. In some cases the binding specificity of a<br>
certain intestinally pathogenic E. coli has been described but only the present invention<br>
shows its relevance to the infection by characterizing the natural receptor saccharides in<br>
human intestine. In a few cases combination of receptor structures and possible binding<br>
have been separately indicated to a certain extent. However, in these cases the<br>
characterization of potential receptors and binding specificities allow design of more<br>
effective receptor oligosaccharide sequences.<br>
Most relevant carbohydrate binding specificities of human intestine<br>
Analysis of glycoproteins from human intestine revealed unexpectedly several interesting<br>
carbohydrate receptor structures. Combination of bacterial binding data and the presence<br>
of receptor allows defining of the biologically most useful therapeutic and diagnostic<br>
structures. The six binding specificities under this category also aim to use receptor<br>
specificities which are not so common in the normal useful bacterial flora.<br>
Mannose comprising N-elvcans<br>
Extraordinary structures such as N-glycan type structures comprising several mannoses<br>
and phosphate were characterized from glycoprotein samples of human gastrointestinal<br>
tract. Multi-mannose comprising N-glycans have not been characterized from human<br>
intestine. Presence of a phosphate residue is also a surprising feature. Phospho-mannans<br>
have been reported to bind certain biological carbohydrate receptors, but so far such<br>
structures have not been characterized to be present in human intestine nor as natural<br>
receptors in human intestinal tissues. The present data shows that a branched multi-<br>
mannose structure is a binding receptor for diarrhea causing E.coli bacteria. Previous data<br>
also indicates that certain bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium can<br>
bind multi-mannose containing N-glycans. The present data concerning the presence of the<br>
mannose N-glycans in the intestine reveal the relevance of mannose binding to the<br>
pathogenesis. Substances inhibiting this binding, such as mannose or mannose analogues<br>
comprising carbohydrate oligomers or polyvalent carbohydrate conjuGates, are especially<br>
effective because they can inhibit the relevant carbohydrate binding between the bacterium<br>
and human.<br>
It is also realized that the novel multi-mannose receptors, especially phosphorylated multi-<br>
mannose receptors, can be used in analysis of pathogen binding to the receptor.<br>
In a specific embodiment it is also realized that the multi-mannose receptors, especially<br>
phosphorylated multi-mannose receptors, can be used as receptors or substrates for<br>
probiotic bacteria, which adhere and bind or is able to degradate the receptor structure.<br>
In a specific embodiment it is also realized that the multi-mannose receptors, especially<br>
phosphorylated multi-mannose receptors, can be used for diagnostic or analytical methods<br>
to analyze the bindings of intestinal pathogens to the receptor structure and smaller<br>
derivatives or anlogues thereof.<br>
Sialic acid comprising receptors and sialic acid binding specificities<br>
Potential sialic acid comprising structures have not been characterized from human<br>
intestinal glycoproteins. The present invention shows several new sialylated structures and<br>
binding of diarrhea-causing E. coli to these structures. The sialic acid binding specificity of<br>
any diarrhea-causing E. coli has not been characterized in detail. The minor reports with<br>
only a few strains do not reveal the major sialic acid binding specificities according to the<br>
present invention and these specificities have not been connected with the receptor<br>
structures.<br>
The present invention surprisingly shows that even N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid, not<br>
synthesized by human body, in various oligosaccharide chains can be effectively bound by<br>
E.coli bacteria infecting humans. It has been suGgested that N-glycolyl neuraminic acid<br>
derived from foods can be present on human tissues. Even in case of vegans who do not<br>
eat animal based foods, the NeuGc binding is useful for the inhibition of the sialic acid<br>
binding or can be used as a polyvalent conjuGate for sterical inhibition of other bindings as<br>
described by the present invention.<br>
Surprisingly it could be shown that the sialic acid dependent binding specificity could be<br>
effectively inhibited by monovalent sialyl-lactose oligosaccharide.<br>
Present invention was able to demonstrate the presence of protein linked sialylated first<br>
contact receptors in human gastrointestinal tract. The data show that the sialic acid-<br>
receptors are present and available for pathogen binding, showing the relevance of the<br>
receptors for pathogenesis, especially with regard to diarrhea causing E. coli infections.<br>
Galct4Gal- receptors of diarrhea causing E. coli.<br>
This binding specificity has not been characterized for diarrhea-causing E. coli bacteria.<br>
Use of this oligosaccharide sequence has been known alone or as polyvalent non-soluble<br>
conjuGates for prevention shiga-like toxins of EHEC. The failure of the approach depends<br>
probably on the failure to effectively inhibit the bindings of the EHEC. The non-soluble<br>
carrier does not allow the polyvalent inhibition as described by the present invention using<br>
the soluble polyvalent conjuGates.<br>
The difference in shiga-like toxin binding to adhesion is also shown by the ability of<br>
monovalent structures to inhibit and by the fine specificity of the binding. Preferred<br>
epitopes for shiga-like toxin inhibition are trisaccharides Gala4GalpaGlc and<br>
Gala4GalpaGlcNAc. According to the present invention the adhesin of diarrhea-causing<br>
E. coli also recognizes the disaccharide Gala4Gal, as this sequence can be produced more<br>
economically from natural polysaccharides than the trisaccharides. The present invention<br>
also shows that 3"-substituted forms of Gala4Gal such as the globoside and Forssman<br>
antigen can be commonly recognized by the adhesin while the recognition properties<br>
towards substituted Gala4Gal vary with toxins. The adhesin can be switched-on and<br>
switched-off in a bacterium.<br>
In contrast to prior art with toxins the present invention shows effective inhibition of the<br>
Gala4Gal- binding by monovalent oligosaccharides. Inhibition of shiga-like toxin binding<br>
has been specifically reported not to be inhibitable monovalent Gala4Gal. The prior art<br>
does not describe the inhibition of one or several binding activities of EHECs together with<br>
the use of Gala4Gal.The present invention also shows mat several binding specificities are<br>
also involved with EHEC infections. The prior art has not described the use of said<br>
sequence for treatment of other diarrheal diseases caused by other diarrhea causing E. coli<br>
bacteria. The roles of toxins, of which shiga-like toxins are only one class, vary in<br>
carbohydrate recognition specificities and infections caused by different types of E.coli<br>
such as EPEC, ETEC, etc.<br>
The relevance of the epitope to natural infection is somewhat controversial, but the<br>
receptor may be present in the intestine or on the intestinal epithelium. The present<br>
invention is directed to the search of the epitope from intestinal proteins to confirm the<br>
relevance to the natural infections. Even if only small amounts of natural receptors would<br>
be present, the Gala4Gal-structures can be used as soluble polyvalent conjuGates<br>
according to the invention to cover the bacterial surface and stererically block other<br>
adhesins of the bacterium.<br>
The fucosvl-receptors<br>
The present invention also desribed a novel binding to focosylated sequences such as the<br>
Lewis a structure. Such a binding has not been previously described for a diarrhea-causing<br>
E.coli bacterium. The Lewis a binding has not been previously described, but potential<br>
receptor structures are known from glycolipids of human intestine. Preferred inhibitors of<br>
the binding includes the human milk oligosacharide Galß3(Fuca4)GlcNAcß3GalpaGlc.<br>
Present invention was able to demonstrate the presence of protein linked fucosylated first<br>
contact receptors in human gastrointestinal tract. The data show that the fucosyl-receptors<br>
are present and available for pathogen binding, showing the relevance of the receptors for<br>
pathogenesis, especially with regard to diarrhea causing E. coli infections.<br>
Lacto-receptors and Neolacto-receptors<br>
Present invention was able to demonstrate the presence of protein linked lacto- and<br>
neolacto-type first contact receptors in human gastrointestinal tract The data show that the<br>
lacto-receptors and neolacto-receptors are present and available for pathogen binding,<br>
showing the relevance of the receptors for pathogenesis, especially with regard to diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli infections.<br>
General binding specificities also commonly present in normal flora<br>
Lactosylceramide and ganglio-receptors are known to bind normal bacterial flora. The use<br>
of these receptors may also reduce normal flora or probiotic bacteria and are therefore<br>
more preferred to be used in combination with probiotic bacteria or probiotic substances.<br>
These receptors belong to the second contact receptor category and are most useful in<br>
connection to the other receptors described to be in the first contact receptors when the<br>
most effective treatment is needed. Gala4Gal structures can be also considered partially as<br>
normal flora binding structures. In a separate embodiment Gala4Gal structures are used<br>
together with probiotic bacteria.<br>
The lactosvlceramide binding<br>
The glycolipid receptor lactosylceramide comprising hydroxyl fatty acids is a novel<br>
receptor activity for diarrhea causing E. coli. This specificity includes 3"modified<br>
lactosylceramides, structures having modification or the elongation of the oligosaccharide<br>
chain on carbon 3 of the Gal residue in lactosylceramide. Lactosylceramide comprising<br>
hydroxyl fatty acids is known from intestinal tissue and considered as a general receptor<br>
for diarrhea causing E. coli.<br>
Refinement of the lacto-binding specificity and novel indications<br>
Previously Galß3GlcNAc has been proposed for EPEC inhibition by using<br>
neoglycoprotein comprising this disaccharide as a chemical non-natural conjuGate. The<br>
present invention showed effctive binding to the longer oligosaccharide sequence<br>
Galß3GlcNAcß3GalpaGlc. This tetrasaccharide can be used for inhibition of the lacto-<br>
binding of the diarrhea causing E. coli also in the monovalent state. The present invention<br>
shows that inhibiting the lacto binding of EHEC can be used for treatment of diseases<br>
caused by EHEC such as HUS, haemolytic uremic syndrome. Inhibition of the lacto-<br>
binding is also useful aGalnst ETEC, EIEC, and EAEC.<br>
Refinement of the neolacto-bindine of E. coli and novel indications.<br>
Previously GalpaGlcNAc has been proposed for EPEC inhibition by using<br>
neoglycoprotein comprising this disaccharide as chemical non-natural conjuGate. Lacto-N-<br>
neotetraose can inhibit binding of EPEC to a cultured epithelial cell line, but based on this<br>
finding the relevance of the binding cannot be shown. The glycosylations of the cultured<br>
cells vary and are not necessarily even close to natural glycosylation of the tissue from<br>
which it originates. According to the present invention it is possible to use lacto-N-<br>
neotetraose to inhibit EPEC binding. According to present invention the disaccharide<br>
sequence GalpaGlcNAc and oligosacharide sequences comprising this disaccharide<br>
sequence can be used to inhibit EHEC, ETEC and other diarrhea-causing E.coli. The<br>
present invention also shows a novel variation for neolacto binding comprising terminal<br>
GlcNAc structures such as GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAc and<br>
GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc. It is also found for the first time that linear ß3-<br>
linked poly-N-acetyllactoasmines, GalpaGlcNAc[ß3GalpaGlcNAc]nß3GalpaGlc where in<br>
n is integer and n&gt;=l, are receptors for diarrhea causing E.coli strains, the terminal Gal can<br>
be substituted by other monosaccharide residues. Preferred monovalent inhibitors<br>
comprises GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc, which has been reported from milk of<br>
buffalo, and mixtures comprising GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc and<br>
GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc.<br>
Novel indications for ganglio-receptor inhibitors of pathogens<br>
Gangliobinding has been shown for several strains of EPECs and ETECs. The present<br>
invention widens the binding spectrum of the ganglio-saccharides to the EHEC type and<br>
especially to the EIEC and EAEC types of E. coli.<br>
Inhibition of pathogens bv monovalent receptors<br>
It is generally believed that the carbohydrate bindings to their receptors and especially the<br>
bindings of pathogenic bacteria are quite weak as monovalent interactions. It has been<br>
shown that for example binding of the Shiga-like toxin of E. coli to cultivated cells, can be<br>
only inhibited by very high density polyvalent carbohydrate conjuGates of the Galca4Gal-<br>
sequence.<br>
The present invention shows that especially the frequent binding specificities of diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli to Neolacto-receptors, Globo-receptors, Lacto-receptors and Sialic acid-<br>
receptors are specifically inhibitable. The inhibition can be achieved by relatively low<br>
concentrations of monovalent oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides have inhibitory<br>
activity even at 0.3 mM final concentration under the in vitro testing conditions with<br>
natural glycolipid receptors. General useful concentration ranges estimated from the<br>
experiments are as follows. Useful concentration range is under about 3 mM, more<br>
preferably under 2 mM, and even more preferably 1.5 mM or under. The invention is<br>
further directed to preferred concentrations under 1.0 mM and under 0.5 mM, a preferred<br>
concentration is of about 0.3 mM. The preferred lower limit of the concentration is above<br>
0.005 mM more preferably above 0.010 mM and more preferably above 0.1 mM and most<br>
preferably above 0.1 mM. The invention is specifically directed to use of monovalent<br>
oligosaccharides at useful concentration as described, especially at concentrations under 2<br>
mm and 1 mM. The concentration or the amount of the oligosaccharide can be further<br>
optimised for a specific oligosaccharide to avoid excessive use of the saccharides. The<br>
oligosaccharides may be used within preferred concentration ranges for monovalent<br>
inhibition so that the concentrations are adjusted closer to concentrations present in human<br>
milk or for example bovine milk. Some preferred concentrations and amount based on milk<br>
data are described elsewhere by the invention. The use of the oligosaccharides at milk<br>
concentrations is especially useful as these concentrations may be regarded as safe.<br>
1. The bacterial adhesion binding specificities are inhibitable with monovalent<br>
oligosaccharides.<br>
2. The bacterial adhesion binding specificities are inhibitable by relatively low<br>
concentrations of free monovalent oligosaccharide sequences.<br>
The specific inhibition of the receptor binding specificities, especially the frequent binding<br>
specificities described by the examples further indicates that:<br>
l.The binding specificities are separate and<br>
2. The frequent binding specificities are independent of the glycolipid carrier or any other<br>
carrier structure<br>
3. For therapeutic application each binding specificity toward receptor family described by<br>
the invention need to be inhibited separately.<br>
The inventors further show by using combinations of the frequent binding specifities that<br>
the oligosaccharide inhibitors inhibit the bacterial binding simultaneously. The data<br>
indicates that<br>
1.A single bacterial strain or batch can simultaneously express multiple inhibitable binding<br>
specificities. The prior art lacks experiments showing simultaneous binding and inhibition<br>
of the bacterial binding. As the invention also revealed that the binding specificities can be<br>
swithed on a single strain of and vary randomly between strains, any attempt to combine<br>
past data from different experiment performed at different times has no scientific<br>
relevance.<br>
2 .The tested oligosaccharides do not have interactions with each other which could prevent<br>
the simultaneous inhibition.<br>
An approach using monovalent oligosaccharide sequences could save costs of synthesis<br>
when the construct is prepared. Polyvalent conjuGates may also comprise non-natural and<br>
non-biodegradable linker structures which may cause side effects or regulatory problems.<br>
In general it is desired that the monovalent oligosaccharide should be active at low<br>
concentrations that would allow cost effective use of the oligosaccharide. The monovalent<br>
oligosaccharide means here also monovalent conjuGates of the oligosaccharide, for<br>
example glycosylamines or glycosylamides or methyl glycosides or other glycosides<br>
including other N-glycosides, C-glycosides or S-glycosides, or for example active<br>
derivatives in which the reducing end is modified by reduction or reductive animation. If<br>
the reducing -end monosaccharide residue is reduced, it may be used as a spacer outside of<br>
the binding active carbohydrate epitope. Such an approach would require the use of an<br>
oligosaccharide which is at least one monosaccharide residue longer than the desired<br>
receptor epitope in the oligosaccharide sequence.<br>
The present invention demonstrates that unexpectedly high affinity monovalent binding<br>
activities can be found and that monovalent carbohydrates can be used in relatively low<br>
concentrations to inhibit the bindings. Preferred monovalent substances comprise one or<br>
several terminal non-reducing end sequences chosen from the group: Gala4Gal,<br>
Gala4Gala4Gal, Gala4Galß4Glc, Gala4Galß4Glc, alpha-linked sialic acid, Neu5Aca,<br>

This group comprises natural Gala4Gal sequences, natural type asialo ganglioside<br>
sequences and oligosaccharides which are present in animal or human milk. The preferred<br>
monovalent substances also comprise Mana3Man and Mana3(Mana6)Man<br>
oligosaccharide sequence structures.<br>
In another embodiment the oligosaccharide sequences are chosen from cheap natural<br>
sources. Pectin oligosaccharides in which the carboxylic acid groups has been reduced is<br>
an example of low cost oligosaccharides, the reduced pectin oligosaccharides have the<br>
sequences Gal[a4Gal]n, wherein n is an integer from 1-about 10, it is noted that even<br>
larger oligosaccharides could be used but these are not so effective in general. Methods to<br>
reduce pectin in ester form, for example as a natural methanol ester, or by a carbodiimide<br>
have been reported. Large pectin polysaccharides can be degraded to oligosaccharides for<br>
example by chemical hydrolysis or enzymatically by pectinases. Gala4Gal oligosaccharide<br>
sequences or analogs or partial oligosaccharide sequences from natural sources for<br>
example from okra plant are also preferred for uses according to the present invention. The<br>
cheap natural sources also include polysialic acid produced by bacteria. These have<br>
polymeric sequences Neu5Ac[a8Neu5Ac]n orNeu5Ac[a9Neu5Ac]n orNeu5Ac with<br>
alternating a9- and a8-bonds. Polysialic acid may comprise intrachain binding and a<br>
specific embodiment is targeted to the use of polysialic acid as polymeric inhibitor.<br>
Polysaccharides can be degraded to oligosaccharides or lower molecular weight<br>
polysaccharides by methods known in art. Yeast mannan and phosphomannan or<br>
oligosaccharides derived thereof are preferred from low-cost natural sources for uses<br>
according to the present invention. The low-cost natural oligosaccharide sequences are<br>
especially preferred for nutritional, food and feed applications.<br>
Treatment of unknown pathogens<br>
The carbohydrate compositions and substances are especially aimed for treatment of<br>
pathogen infections when the pathogen or pathogens causing the infection is or are not<br>
known. In many cases it is not possible to diagnose the pathogen and treatment has to be<br>
started before the results from diagnosis can be obtained. In under developed countries the<br>
diagnostics may not be available or may be too expensive. The availability of diagnostics<br>
may be also limited under war conditions or in distant regions with low populations. The<br>
compositions and substances according to the invention can be used to relieve symptoms<br>
of infections caused by numerous different pathogens. The present invention is especially<br>
directed to the treatment of diseases, preferentially gastrointestinal diseases such as<br>
diarrheas, when the pathogen is non-typable pathogen or pathogenic E. coli.<br>
Svnereistic effects of manipulating several carbohydrate receptor bindings<br>
The first synergistic effect is the unexpectedly high efficiency in inhibition or binding to a<br>
single pathogen which represent several adhesins binding to cell surfaces of a patient. In<br>
traditional inhibition attempts with single oligosaccharide epitopes the pathogen usually<br>
has additional carbohydrate binding specificities which may allow it to survive in the<br>
tissue. The prevention or inhibition of the binding is more effective when as many binding<br>
components as possible are inhibited. When a polyvalent conjuGate is used the highest<br>
affinity part of the conjuGate targets possible receptor oligosaccharide sequences with<br>
lower affinity to the surface of the pathogen. When the inhibition cover most of the<br>
binding mechanisms of the pathogen, the inhibition exeeds a threshold value allowing the<br>
pathogen mass to be flushed away by liquids of the tissue, causing a dramatic preventive<br>
effect aGalnst the pathogen. When the invention is used to inhibit simultaneously a microbe<br>
and a toxin involved in the same disease, the disease is relieved by two means, i.e. removal<br>
of both the bacterium and the toxin.<br>
The use of two or more oligosaccharide sequences has also a synergistic effect aGalnst the<br>
development of resistance aGalnst the inhibition theraphy. The development of resistance is<br>
a common problem in current antibiotic theraphies. When there are limited amount of<br>
potential carbohydrate receptors for a pathogen in a target tissue, the therapies with two or<br>
more oligosaccharides can be used so that the bacteria have no choice left for the adhesion<br>
to the tissues.<br>
When two or more oligosaccharides are used aGalnst several pathogens, synergistic<br>
inhibition effects are produced. When several pathogens are infecting simultaneously, the<br>
pathogens/infections are often supporting each other.<br>
Besides the effects between pathogen and host tissues or between pathogens or pathogens<br>
and normal flora, the synergistic effect for inhibition of pathogens may occur by<br>
interaction with the immune defence of the patient. The pathogens may weaken the cells of<br>
the immune defence.<br>
The coinfection situation may involve several carbohydrate interactions which can be<br>
manipulated. For example, cells infected by influenza virus are more effectively coinfected<br>
by several pathogenic bacteria of lungs. It has been suGgested that sialidase of the<br>
influenza virus could reveal non-sialylated receptors for the bacteria on the infected lung<br>
cells. The virus may also use its hemagglutinin receptors for binding to granulocytes<br>
creating an interaction which can lead to dysfunction of the leukocyte.<br>
Methods involving synergistic effects to inhibit binding of pathogens<br>
l.Svnergistic effects of at least two receptor carbohydrates aGalnst a single pathogen which<br>
has several binding activities.<br>
a) Simultaneous inhibition of at least two binding specificities present on the same<br>
pathogen effectively inhibits alternative binding specificities of the pathogen when at least<br>
two binding specificities are present at the same time.<br>
b) Similarly, the inhibition of at least two binding specificities of a pathogen is desired<br>
when second binding specificity may arise in a situation when first binding specificity is<br>
inhibited. A cell pathogen like a bacterium may even be able to switch on the first binding<br>
specificity. While the first binding specificity may be switched off by inhibition using the<br>
covering method, which is described for polyvalent soluble carbohydrates in 3 below, it is<br>
not possible by single polyvalent carbohydrate aGalnst the first specificity. Such switching<br>
may occur for example by a phase variation of a bacterium. Switching the binding would<br>
be useful for a pathogenic cell which can use several carbohydate receptors since<br>
production of carbohydrate adhesins for receptors which are not present would consume<br>
energy unnecessarily. The inventors noticed that the binding specificities according to the<br>
invention can be switched off in strains of E. coli causing diarrhea. Therefore it is useful to<br>
use several binding oligosaccharide sequences, especially oligosaccharide sequences<br>
according to the invention to inhibit the binding of the bacteria causing diarrheas and other<br>
intestinal diseases. The invention reveals that any of the binding specificities of the<br>
numerous bacterial strains studied may be switched of by random fashion. During longer<br>
cultivation all the binding specificities may be switched off.<br>
c) The invention reveals that the binding specificities are not stabily expressed in different<br>
strains of bacteria even among the same indication. This further emphasizes the need of<br>
multiple inhibitors, especially monovalent inhibitors for effective therapy.<br>
d) Inhibition of the receptor on different levels of the infection. As a special case about the<br>
inhibition of pathogens, especially bacteria and viruses causing intestinal diseases such as<br>
diarrheas, the invention shows that it is useful to inhibit the pathogen binding on two<br>
receptor levels. The first binding interactions occur on the outer part of the carbohydrate<br>
matrix covering cell surfaces. This outer part comprises oligosaccharide sequences of<br>
glycoproteins, and possibly some polyglycosylceramide type of structures. The first<br>
binding interactions are here called first contact and the receptors involved in the first<br>
binding are here called first contact receptors. The second binding interactions, here called<br>
second contact, occur with medium sized and small glycolipids on the cell membrane<br>
surface. The small and medium sized glycolipid receptors are here called the second<br>
contact recptors. The prior art does not describe these structurally characterized<br>
oligosaccharide sequences as first contact bacterial receptors from human intestine or<br>
gastrointestinal tract.<br>
The invention shows that several novel first contact receptors among the receptor types<br>
according to the invention are present on human intestinal mucin glycoproteins. The novel<br>
receptors include mannose-comprising oligosaccharide sequences, Galß3GlcNAc,<br>
&gt; GalpaGlcNAc, Lewis a, and sialylated glycoprotein oligosaccharide sequences. More<br>
preferred receptors are involved in the first binding interactions. The binding to the<br>
glycoprotein receptors is on a different level of the binding interactions than the binding to<br>
shorter chain oligosaccharide sequences of the cell surface glycolipids. It is noticed that<br>
Gal{33GlcNAc, GalpMGlcNAc, Lewis a, and sialylated glycoprotein oligosaccharide<br>
5 sequences may also be present on long chain polylactosamine glycolipids and on shorter<br>
chain glycolipids. The carbohydrate structures which are totally or at least mostly<br>
expressed as second contact receptors include the lactosylceramide receptors, the ganglio-<br>
binding receptors and the globo-binding receptors.<br>
According to a specific embodiment it is preferred to use the primary contact receptors,<br>
preferentially at least two of these to inhibit effectively primary contact and the infections.<br>
The present invention shows for the first time several first contact receptors from human<br>
intestine:<br>
multi-mannose receptor, neolacto, lacto-, Lewis a and sialic acid binding receptors.<br>
It is also realized that the novel first contact receptors are useful for search of other<br>
pathogen bindings towards these. When a binding structure has been found the receptor<br>
saccharide can be used for inhibitor design as described here for E. coli bacteria.<br>
Underfucosvlated receptors<br>
A preferred group among the preferred first contact receptors are underfucosylated<br>
receptors such as neolacto, lacto and Lewis a oligosaccharide sequences. These are more<br>
common in persons who are negative for fucosyltransferases like secretor a2-Fuc-T and<br>
Lewis-blood group fucosyltransferase. Persons with underglycosylated gastrointestinal<br>
tracts are more prone to infections. The present invention shows a reason for that and a<br>
potential therapy. pathogenic E. coli can be inhibited by one or more of several of the<br>
following oligosaccharides or conjuGates, preferentially polyvalent conjuGates, thereof:<br>
Lacto-N-tciraose, Lacto-N-neotetraose, Galß3(Fuca4)GlcNAcß3GalpaGlc.<br>
The present invention describes for the first time theraphies for a novel indication,<br>
increased infections due to under modified lactosamine sequences, especially<br>
underfucosylation of epithelial lactosamine sequences. The invention is especially directed<br>
to treatment of persons who are Lewis fucosyltransferase (fucosyltransferase III) negative<br>
and or secretor fucosyltransferase negative. Similar underfucosylated sequences acting as<br>
pathogen receptors on epithelial cells can occur when a human patient is negative for other<br>
fUcosyltransferases, especially fucosyltransferase V and/or fucosyltransferase VI. The<br>
present invention is directed to prevent intestinal pathogen adhesion by inhibiting pathogen<br>
or pathogens by carbohydrates comprising one or more oligosaccharide sequences chosen<br>
from the group neolacto receptors, lacto receptors and fucose receptors when the structures<br>
in a patient has increased.<br>
In a preferred embodiment one or several more active elongated oligosaccharide sequences<br>
according to the formula Galpx(Fucct4)nGlcNAcPR, wherein independently x is linkage<br>
position 3 or 4, n is = 0 or 1, with the provision that when x=4, then n=0; and R is a<br>
monosaccharide residue or oligosaccharide or conjuGate thereof, preferentially R, linked to<br>
GlcNAcp, comprises 3Gal(NAc)m and m is independently 0 or 1, are used. Preferred<br>
sequences are Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3Gal, Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc,<br>
Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAc,Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3Galß3GlcNAc,<br>
Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc,<br>
Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3Galß3GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcand<br>
Galpx(Fuca4)nGlcNAcß3GalNAc.<br>
Preferentially two oligosaccharide sequences are used. Preferred combinations of the two<br>
oligosaccharide sequences include non-reducing end terminal oligosaccharide sequences<br>
GalpaGlcNAcß3Gal and Galß3GlcNAcß3Gal, where these sequences represent both<br>
undermodified or underfucosylated type 1 and type 2 N-acetyllactosamines and serve as<br>
receptors for intestinal pathogens. Another preferred combination is Galß3GlcNAcß3Gal<br>
and Galß3(Fuca4)GlcNAc comprising type 1 lactosamines which are especially common<br>
in intestine. In a preferred embodiment all three oligosaccharide sequences are used.<br>
In the present invention it is realised for the first time that<br>
1. Single pathogens, especially pathogenic bacteria infecting human gastrointestinal tract<br>
such as intestinal diarrheagenic E. coli bind to the limited number of specific<br>
oligosaccharide receptors present on the target tissue. Several receptor binding specificities<br>
are simultaneously functional.<br>
2. The oligosaccharide sequences as polyvalent conjuGates or in immunologically active<br>
compositions may also activate the immune defense, for example in intestine, which may<br>
target several types of pathogens such as bacteria or fungi. Carbohydrates can especially be<br>
used to activate non-specific immune defence reactions.<br>
3. Polyvalent soluble carbohydrates comprising common carbohydrate receptor or<br>
receptors for carbohydrate binding activity present on a pathogen, which has possibility for<br>
several types of binding interactions with patient, can be used to coat the bacterium. When<br>
the surface of the bacterium is covered by the polyvalent soluble carbohydrate, the other<br>
binding interactions are sterically inhibited. The steric inhibition requires suitable<br>
molecular weight, in general the molecular weight should be high enouGh to be able to<br>
effectively inhibit, on the other hand the molecular weight in certain applications should be<br>
low enouGh to allow effective diffusion of the soluble carbohydrate. The covering soluble<br>
polyvalent carbohydrate can bind several pathogens together making an agglutinate which<br>
is removed for example with mucin secretion on lung or intestinal epithelium. Several<br>
pathogens can comprise several different species or strains of pathogens or several cells or<br>
several protein pathogens of the same species, strain or type.<br>
4. The use of an inhibiting carbohydrate aGalnst a single pathogen in a coinfection situation<br>
can enhance the infections of other coinfecting pathogens which are not inhibited but are<br>
getting more room to expand. Prevention of one pathogen has also a synergistic effect<br>
aGalnst a coinfecting pathogen when there is an adhesion, which may be inhibited or used<br>
to flush several bacteria together. When using polyvalent soluble carbohydrates complexes<br>
may be formed between the coinfecting pathogens. When one or preferably at least two<br>
carbohydrates are used aGalnst all the coinfecting pathogens the infection is weakened<br>
much more effectively than when only one interaction is targeted. The synergistic effect of<br>
inhibiting coinfection by at least two carbohydrate sequences which can inhibit all the<br>
coinfecting bacteria is useful for the situation with at least two co-infecting pathogens for<br>
prevention of for example severe pneumonias or diarrheas.<br>
Preferred combinations of inhibitors of diarrhea causing E.coli<br>
Because of the different contact levels in infections, combinations of first contact receptor<br>
oligosaccharides can be preferred. The first contact receptors are more easily available for<br>
bacterial binding and preferred targets for inhibition. The present invention is also directed<br>
to the treatment or prevention of infections, wherein the first contact receptors of the<br>
pathogen adhesion to human gastric epithelium is blocked, especially by using at least two<br>
of oligosaccharide receptors chosen from the group: lacto receptors, neolacto receptors.,<br>
fucose-receptors, sialic acid receptors, and mannose receptors, more preferably at least<br>
three oligosaccharide receptors from the group are chosen and most preferably at least four<br>

The polyvalent conjuGates are preferentially designed to be non-antigenic, and non-<br>
immunogenic, so that the only minor immune reactions or no immune reactions at all are<br>
caused by the conjuGates. Other preferred properties of the polysaccharides include low<br>
toxicity of the polysaccharide and/or its degradation products.<br>
The polyvalent conjuGates which are aimed to inhibit bacteria are designed to avoid<br>
carbohydrates binding specificity or specificities of the epithelium when the carbohydrate<br>
binding specificity can attach the conjuGate to the epithelium and increase the ß4thologic<br>
binding of the ß4thogen to the tissue.<br>
Bacterial exopolysaccharides or capsular polysaccharides from bacteria are preferred,<br>
especially when the bacterium is a non-ß4thogenic bacterium such as lactic acid bacterium.<br>
Several of the oligosaccharide receptors according to the invention are known from<br>
bacterial polysaccharides. The invention is also directed to the engineering of the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide epitopes on bacterial polysaccharides, especially polysaccharides of non-<br>
ß4thogens such as lactic acid bacteria. The engineering may be done genetically or by<br>
chemical modification of the polysaccharides, for example by specific hydrolysis or<br>
glycosyltransferase reactions. According to present invention it is possible to use a<br>
bacterial polysaccharide or mixture of bacterial polysaccharides which comprises at least<br>
two receptor oligosaccharides according to the present invention. It is more preferred to<br>
use a bacterial polysaccharide or mixture of bacterial polysaccharides which comprises at<br>

NeuNAca6Galj34/3Glc or NeuNAca3Galß4/3Glc linked to a polysaccharide. Such<br>
polysaccharides with NeuNAc3Gal are already present on certain exopolysaccharides of<br>
type B Streptococcus- species. Similar polysaccharides can be expressed on non-ß4thogens<br>
such as lactic acid bacteria. NeuNAca6Gal- containing species are more preferred since<br>
these can be produced by desialylating totally or ß4rtially NeuNAca3Galß4GlcNAc-<br>
containing polysaccharides and resialylating with a transferase sialylating at 6-position of<br>
Gal such as a a6-sialyltransferase. Alternatively a non-sialylated polysaccharide<br>
comprising terminal Galß4/3GlcNAc or Galß4/3Glc can be sialylated. Non-sialylated<br>

In another embodiment an antigenic or immuno stimulating or modulating carbohydrate<br>
conjuGate is included. The antigenic or immunogenic carbohydrate conjuGate is in a<br>
specific embodiment covalently conjuGated to one or several oligosaccharide sequences<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Polyvalent conjuGates for cross-linking ß4thogens to immune cells or to immune defence<br>
proteins<br>
Alternatively the carbohydrate compositions can be used to cross-link the ß4thogens to<br>
immune cells such as various types of leukocytes, or immune defence proteins such as<br>
antibodies, immune lectins or other ß4thogen inhibiting agents and thus inhibit the<br>
ß4thogen.<br>
Several receptors for ß4thogens have been reported from the surfaces of immune cells.<br>
Preferred receptors on immune cells are aimed for destruction of the ß4thogen, such as<br>
phagosytosis receptors. The polyvalent or oligovalent oligosaccharide sequences are<br>
preferably not so large that they could prevent the phagosytosis or destruction of infecting<br>
ß4thogen. Such receptor includes mannose receptor on macrophages, receptors of natural<br>
killer cells which bind N-acetylglucosamine. It is obvious that several natural and synthetic<br>
carbohydrates can be used as analogs of these sequences. The preferred carbohydrates<br>
binding to the mannose receptors comprise terminal monosaccharide or monosacchoxide<br>
analogs containg at least two free axial hydroxyl groups. The polyvalent carbohydrate<br>
sequences to be used for binding to immune cells include polyvalent conjuGates<br>
comprising mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmannosamine or glucose.<br>
More preferentially the monosaccharides are chosen so that these are natural components<br>
present in human biology, mannose is D-mannopyranose, fucose is L-fucopyranose, N-<br>
acetyl-D-glucosaminopyranose, N-acetyl-D-mannosaminopyranose and glucose is D-<br>
glucopyranose. In the most preferred embodiment the monosaccharide residues are linked<br>

Fucal-4, Fucal-6. Preferred oligosaccharide sequences comprise the terminal<br>
disaccharides Manal-3Man, Manal-6Man, Manal-2Man, GlcNAcpl-3Gal, GlcNAcpi-<br>
2Man, GlcNAcpl-6Gal, Fucal-2Gal, Fucal-3GlcNAc, Fucal-4GlcNAc, or Fucal-<br>
6GlcNAc.<br>
In a specific embodiment a polymeric carbohydrate which has binding specificity towards<br>
both the ß4thogen or several ß4thogens and a ß4thogenesis inhibiting immune cell or<br>
leukocyte is used to cross-link a ß4thogen and an immune cell. Specifically an alpha-<br>
mannose containing carbohydrate is used for binding of bacteria such as Salmonella<br>
species or E. coli and leukocytes/complement system simultaneously.<br>
In another embodiment the polyvalent substances comprising at least two different<br>
oligosaccharide sequences according to the invention is used for simultaneous binding of<br>
one or more types of ß4thogens and one or more types of immune cells caß4ble of<br>
inhibiting the ß4thogen or the ß4thogens. More preferably one of the oligosacharide<br>
sequences in the polyvalent substance comprising at least two different oligosaccharide<br>
sequences according to the invention is a Mana- comprising oligosaccharide sequence.<br>
Soluble polyvalent conjuGates covering and agglutinating the ß4thogens<br>
Preferred polyvalent conjuGates include soluble or gel forming polyvalent conjuGates.<br>
More preferably the polyvalent conjuGate is soluble and can cover the surface of the<br>
bacterium. Preferrably the bacterium covering soluble polyvalent conjuGate has at least a<br>
molecular weight of 5000 daltons, more preferably at least about 10 000 daltons and most<br>
preferably at least about 20 000 daltons. For several applications higher molecular weights<br>
should be limited because of the effective diffusion of the conjuGates in the gastric mucosa.<br>
Preferred upper limits of the polyvalent conjuGates are under about 300 000 daltons, more<br>
preferably under about ISO 000 daltons and most preferably under SO 000 daltons. More<br>
preferred molecular weight ranges include from about S 000 to about SO 000 daltons, from<br>
about 10 000 daltons to 50 000 daltons and most preferably from about 20 000 daltons to<br>
about 100 000 daltons. The molecular weight limits indicate that about at least 70 % of the<br>
molecules are within the desired range and more preferably at least 80 % in the desired<br>
range.<br>
The polyvalent conjuGates that can diffuse to the surface of the ß4thogen and cover it are<br>
especially effective in prevention ß4thogens when several types of bindings should be<br>
inhibited. The polyvalent conjuGate or conjuGates comprises carbohydrate corresponding<br>
to the most common binding activity on the ß4thogen or ß4thogens present. The covering<br>
of the surface by the polyvalent conjuGate blocks sterically the other carbohydrate binding<br>
receptor or receptors on the surface of the ß4thogen or the ß4thogens. Preferably at least<br>
two ß4thogen covering polysaccharides are used. More preferably two different receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences are conjuGated to the same polymer.<br>
Most preferably the soluble polyvalent conjuGate comprises a polysaccharide backbone.<br>
The present invention is thus directed to polyvalent substances, especially soluble<br>
polyvalent substances comprising at least two receptor oligosaccharide sequences, more<br>
preferably at least three receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the present<br>
invention. The present invention is also directed to the polyvalent substances comprising at<br>
least four receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention.<br>
Polyvalent conjuGates which can induce carbohydrate binding towards itself<br>
The present invention is also directed to carbohydrate binding specificities which can be<br>
induced in ß4thogen cells by polyvalent conjuGates which mimic the polyvalent natural<br>
surfaces to which the ß4thogens aim to attach. The inducible binding specificities are not<br>
active all the time but can be activated when ß4thogen needs to bind the receptor.<br>
According to the present invention ß4thogen cells, especially bacteria such as Escherichia<br>
coli, are able to activate such inducible receptor carbohydrate binding by contact with the<br>
receptor. A mechanism for the induction is presence of low amounts of the indicible<br>
receptors on the cell surface, which signals induction of the receptors in higher amounts.<br>
For the induction of the receptor the polyvalent conjuGates as described above can be used.<br>
High molecular weight conjuGates are prefererred when the target ß4thogen cell is<br>
accessible for higher molecular weight molecules in the mucin layer. For this application<br>
even non-soluble polymeric conjuGates can be used when the target ß4thogen cell is<br>
accessible for these.<br>
Therapeutic targets<br>
The present invention is preferrably targeted for treatment of intestinal infections or lung<br>
infections. The term treatment means also preventive or prophylaxis treatments. Similarly,<br>
the invention could be used for treatment of oral or other gastrointestinal infections or<br>
treatment of infections of other epithelia or surfaces of the body of the ß4tient, such as<br>
skin, or on genital surfaces such as the vagina. The invention can be even used in blood<br>
circulation of the ß4tient, but then special care must be taken for the suitability of the<br>
substances and compositions for such use.<br>
The invention is especially and preferentially directed to treatment of intestinal ß4thogens.<br>
The preferred intestinal ß4thogens cause diarrhea diseases. Preferred diarrhea causing<br>
ß4thogens includes all types Escherichia coli which cause intestinal diseases. The use of<br>
the compositions aGalnst Escherichia coli species including EPEC (enteroß4thogenic<br>
Escherichia coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic<br>
Escherichia coli), EAEC (enteroaggregative Escherichia coli) and EIEC (enteroinvasive<br>
Escherichia coli).<br>
Treatment and prevention of other non- E.coli infections and co-infections<br>
It is realized that several other ß4thogens live in similar receptor environment, in human or<br>
even in animals, especially in gastrointestinal tract, especially in intestinal receptor<br>
environment, comprising carbohydrate receptors according to the present invention. Other,<br>
non-E.coli, ß4thogens infecting human especially human gastrointestinal tract, more<br>
specifically ones infecting the human intestine, are likely to use one or several of the<br>
receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention. Treatment of other<br>
ß4thogen or other ß4thogens according to the present invention is preferred when the<br>
ß4thogens bind to at least two, more preferably at least three, receptor oligosaccharide<br>
sequences according to the present invention and when there is specifical benefits for using<br>
the oligosaccharide sequences as described by the present invention. Thus, the present<br>
invention is generallyt directed to the use of compositions comprising of compounds which<br>
comprise at least two receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the present<br>
invention aGalnst ß4thogens in human gastrointestinal tract, especially in intestine.<br>
When the ß4thogen is a not E. coli the ß4thogen may use or bind other receptors or<br>
analogous oligosaccharide sequences, the other oligosaccharide sequences, referred here as<br>
other receptor oligosaccharide sequences, including preferentially other oligosaccharides<br>
such as sequences Fuca2Gal, Fuca3GlcNAc, Fuca3Glc, ganglioseries gangliosides,<br>
and/or NeuNAca8NeuNAc, more preferably the fucosylated sequences are<br>
Fuca2Galß3/4GlcNAc, Fuca2Galß4Glc, Fuca2Galß4(Fuca3)Glc, Galß4(Fuca3)GlcNAc,<br>
Fuca2Galß3/4(Fuca4/3)GlcNAc. The present invention is directed to the use of<br>
compositions comprising of compounds which comprise at least two receptor<br>
oligosaccharide according to the present invention together with at least one of the other<br>
receptor oligosaccharide sequences aGalnst ß4thogens, especially non-E. coli ß4thogens in<br>
human gastrointestinal tract, especially in intestine. The present invention is also directed<br>
to the simultaneous treatment of infections caused by at least one diarrheagenic E. coli and<br>
at least one non-E.coli ß4thogen.<br>
Fuca2Gal-structures bind also to other, non-E. coli, ß4thogens and they are useful for use<br>
in combinations with the substances according to the present invention. In a preferred<br>
embodiment Fuca2Gal-structure or Fuca2Gal-Xyl structure is derived from plant<br>
hemicellulose. The present invention is also directed to therapeutic substance comprising<br>
Fuca2Gal-structure derived from plant hemicellulose. The therapeutic substance can be<br>
used in nutritional compositions including foods, feeds, beverages or in medicines or<br>
medicine like therapeutic compositions.<br>
Other bacteria which can be targeted by the receptor carbohydrate combinations and<br>
polyvalent conjuGates according to the invention include for example Vibrio species,<br>
including Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter species, including Campylobacterjejuni,<br>
Salmonella species, including Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria species, Shigella species,<br>
Aeromonas species, intestinal viruses, especially rota virus, and intestinal eukaryotic<br>
parasites including the Entamobae species. The other intestinal pathogens have similar<br>
binding profiles with diarrhea causing E. coli as shown for example by studies with<br>
hemagglutination patterns with varios red cells. The other pathogens live in similar<br>
environment and use at least partially the same receptors as the diarrhea causing E. coli.<br>
Many infections for example in intestine and lungs involve several pathogens. Such<br>
infections are difficult to treat and may turn into chronic infections. Many diarrheas and<br>
lung diseases which may be mild infections in the beginning may develop into lethal forms<br>
of diseases. Complicated diseases are often caused by coinfection of several pathogens. It<br>
is especially preferred to use the carbohydrate compositions for treatment of two or more<br>
pathogenics, which infect or are considered to be infecting the patient The compositions<br>
according to invention can be used to inhibit two or more pathogens from the group<br>
pathogenic bacteria, toxins, viruses, fungi, or parasites, simultaneously. More preferably<br>
the compositions according to the invention inhibit at least two pathogens from the group<br>
pathogenic bacteria, toxins, and viruses, simultaneously. A preferred combination of toxins<br>
and pathogens includes toxins of Escherichia coli and the Escherichia coli- bacteria. Toxin<br>
proteiiu. comprises one or usually several lectins sites presented in ordered oligomoric<br>
manner. For example bacterial toxins such as cholera toxin or shigalike toxins contain five<br>
lectin domains in a ring-shaped protein pentamer. On bacterial surfaces the adhesion<br>
lectins or adhesins are presented in polyvalent manner. Also bacterial carbohydrates<br>
represent bioactive carbohydrate epitopes as large polyvalent conjuGates like on<br>
exopolysaccharides or capsular polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides or peptiglycans or<br>
like. No effective inhibitors are described for inhibition two or more different lectin<br>
representations. The preferred polyvalent or oligovalent conjuGates are special<br>
carbohydrate conjuGates.<br>
According to the present invention it is also preferred to inhibit simultaneously two<br>
different pathogens. In a preferred embodiment the invention is targeted for treatment of<br>
coinfection by a virus and a bacterium. Preferably the bacterium or bacteria belong to<br>
species Escherichia, Vibrio, Salmonella, Listeria, Shigella, Aeromonas, or Campylobacter<br>
and it is most preferably a diarrhea causing Escherichia coli or several strains of<br>
Escherichia coli and the virus is a diarrhea causing virus such as a rotavirus. Other<br>
preferred combinations include lung pathogenic bacteria, preferably Haemophilia<br>
influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruGinosa<br>
and a lung infecting virus such as influenza virus.<br>
The surfaces and adhesion mechanisms of the viruses and bacteria are different. The viral<br>
surface contains infective lectins in ordered surface structures on a relative small and<br>
curved surface of while the larger bacterial surface contains adhesive lectins usually in<br>
linear ordered structures like pili or flagella. Therefore the effective simultaneous<br>
prevention of viruses and bacteria is especially difficult. The present invention describes<br>
the use of special oligovalent or polyvalent compositions or substances which can be used<br>
for treatment of coinfections by viruses and bacteria. The oligovalent or polyvalent<br>
substances or compositions preferably comprise the active carbohydrates in special<br>
carbohydrate conjuGates which can inhibit the bindings of two or more different lectin<br>
presentations on pathogen surface or pathogen surfaces.<br>
Use of the receptor olieosaccharide sequences alone or in combinations for the novel<br>
indication for carbohydrate<br>
It is realized that the receptor oligosaccharide sequences can be used as or in single<br>
substances for therapy or other applications with regard to diarrhea causing E. coli. The<br>
present invention describes novel general diarrhea indication in which diarrhea is caused<br>
by one of the five major types of diarrhea causing E. coli, namely EPEC (enteropathogenic<br>
Escherichia coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic<br>
Escherichia coli), EAEC (enteroaggregative Escherichia coli) and EIEC (enteroinvasive<br>
Escherichia coli) and even by non-typed or non-typable wild-type strains of diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli.<br>
According to present invention the receptor oligosaccharides according to the present<br>
invention can be used as single substances or as parts of single substances for treatment of<br>
infections caused by any type of diarrhea causing E, coli and in a preferred embodiment<br>
for treatment of infections caused by all of the five major types of diarrhea causing E. coli,<br>
and in a more preferred embodiment embodiment for treatment of infections caused by at<br>
least four, and in a separate embodiment by at least three, of the major types of diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli. The oligosaccharide sequences are also preferred for preparation of<br>
therapeutical compositions for treatment of diarrheas caused by several types of diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli, in case a first indication for an oligosaccharide sequence has been<br>
suGgested. When the oligosaccharide sequences are used alone, the theraphy is not as<br>
effective as according to present invention when combinations of the oligosaccharide<br>
sequences are used. As the general indication of using carbohydrate substances aGalnst<br>
infections caused by all or major types of diarrhea causing E. coli is new and inventive, the<br>
use of combinations of the receptor oligosaccharide sequences is even more new and<br>
inventive.<br>
Use of the most novel receptor olieosaccharides alone for therapies<br>
Several oligosaccharide sequences has been suGgested as inhibitors of specific types<br>
diarrhea causing E. coli in prior art, the data includes contradictory results and does not<br>
allow which of the substances could be used alone. The prior art does not show the<br>
relevance of the possible binding with regard to therapeutical use of even single binding<br>
specificity to make inhibitors of carbohydrate mediated pathogen binding. The prior work<br>
does not fulfil the simple primary criteria for theraphautically most relevant carbohydrate<br>
binding. The theraphautically useful carbohydrate mediated pathogen binding could be<br>
considered,<br>
1) if a certain strain of pathogenic bacterium (or pathogen cell) has reprodicible<br>
binding specificity and<br>
2) the binding specificity is present on the pathogen and<br>
3) the corresponding receptor oligosaccharide sequence is present on the relevant<br>
target tissue and<br>
4) the relevant receptor oligosaccharide sequence on target tissue is available for the<br>
binding specificities of the pathogen.<br>
When considering usefulness of the therapeutics, the effects of the possible inhibitor<br>
oligosaccharide sequence must be established. The present invention shows useful<br>
substances and compositions for inhibition of pathogens. The prior art about potential<br>
bindings does not allow to determine effective inhibitors of pathogen binding according to<br>
the present invention. The present invention shows for the first time relevant first contact<br>
lacto-, neolacto-, fucosyl-, sialic acid-, and mannose receptors for diarrhea causing E. coli<br>
in human gastrointestinal tract. Lactosylceramide receptor and Gala4Gal-receptors for<br>
tissue binding of diarrhea causing E. coli has not been previously described, nor specific<br>
Galß3GalNAc-binding. The approaches previously described for toxins does not cure the<br>
disease but can only possible relieve symptoms of the disease with specific strains of E.<br>
coli. The present invention is directed to use following groups of oligosaccharide<br>
sequences according to the invention also as single substances or as part of single<br>
substances for treatment of general and specific indications of diarrhea causing E. coli.<br>
a) Lactosylceramide receptors<br>
b) Galß3GalNAc -receptors<br>
c) Gala4Gal-receptors<br>
d) Lacto-receptors, preferably Gal|13GlcNAcß3Gal-receptors<br>
e) Neolacto-receptors, preferably (GlcNAcß3)0 or iGalpaGlcNAcß3Gal-receptors<br>
f) Fucosyl-receptors<br>
g) Sialic acid-receptors<br>
h) Mannose receptors<br>
The oligosaccharide sequences are also preferred for preparation of therapeutical<br>
compositions for treatment of diarrheas caused by several types of diarrhea causing B. coli,<br>
in case a first indication for an oligosaccharide sequence has been suGgested. When the<br>
oligosaccharide sequences are used alone, the theraphy is not as effective as according to<br>
present invention when combinations of the oligosaccharide sequences are used. The<br>
invention of relevance of the specific oligosaccharide sequences also adds the<br>
inventiveness of approaches using specific combinations of the oligosaccharide sequences.<br>
The relevant oligosaccharide sequences can be also used as monovalent and polyvalent<br>
inhibitors as described by the invention.<br>
Preferred receptor oligosaccharide sequences for therapy, prevention or treatment in<br>
connection to separate dianrheageru"c E. coli indications<br>
Preferred and novel substances and compositions to be used aGalnst EHEC-infections<br>
Present invention is also directed to the treatment of diseases caused by enterohemorrhagic<br>
Escherichia coli. Previously Gala4Gal-comprising substances have been described for<br>
blocking the shiga-like toxin of E. coli. Methods to use several oligosaccharide sequences<br>
especially to block the binding of the bacteria have not been previously described. In the<br>
present invention several strains of EHEC were screened. Special binding profile of<br>
preferred binding specificities were found. According to the present invention these<br>
specificities among the group of eight specificities are preferred for treatment of EHEC.<br>
Substances comprising following oligosaccharide sequences are preferred for the treatment<br>
of EHEC-infections: lactosylceramide receptors, ganglio receptors, lacto receptors,<br>
neolacto receptors, fucose receptors, and mannose receptors; more preferably<br>
lactosylceramide receptors, lacto-receptors, neolacto-receptors, and fucose receptors. The<br>
substances are also preferred in compositions comprising at least two receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences as described by the invention.<br>
It is realized that the oligosaccharide sequences can be used together with toxin blocking<br>
oligosaccharide sequences such as Gala4Gal-type receptors of shiga like toxin. Several<br>
oligovalent and polyvalent oligosaccharides has been described to be effective inhibitors of<br>
the toxins especially when using Gala4GalpaGlc and Gala4GalpaGlcNAc-type<br>
sequences. In the light of previous studies the toxin blocking alone is not enouGh for<br>
effective treatment According to the present invention the Gala4Gal-type<br>
oligosaccharides are not major adhesion receptors for EHEC-adhesion and for effective<br>
treatment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment for EHEC prevention, treatment or diagnostics at least one of<br>
the receptors in the group of lacto-receptors, neolacto- receptors and fucose-receptors are<br>
used. More preferably at least two of the receptors are used. It is also preferred to use at<br>
least three or at least four receptors. These are preferred due to higher speficifity towards<br>
pathogenic organism. It is especially preferred to use the high affinity forms of the<br>

In a preferred embodiment high affinity variant of the preferred receptor oligosaccharide<br>
sequences according to the present invention are used.<br>
It is also preferred to use monovalent receptors and polyvalent receptor conjuGates<br>
according to the present invention in connection with EIEC.<br>
Use of the methods and compositions according to the invention for animal theraphies<br>
In a specific embodiment the invention is used for treatment of infections of cattle or pet<br>
animals. The binding specificities of animal infecting bacteria are different from the human<br>
pathogens. However, the general mechanisms using several specificities at the same time,<br>
and use of polyvalent conjuGates, especially soluble polyvalent conjuGates according to the<br>
invention, are also preferred for use with animals. The binding specificities are also<br>
partially cross-reactive and some of the receptor combinations described by the present<br>
invention are also useful for animal theraphies, and some bacterial strains spread from<br>
animals like cows. According to the present invention several of the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences are present in gastrointestinal tract of animals such as cats and<br>
dogs and even in pigs. The cross-reactivity between a specific animal species or between a<br>
human and a specific animal for a specific strain cannot be known before the binding<br>
specificities are analysed. The most common E. coli bacteria causing infections in animals<br>
such as K99 or K88-strains do not infect humans.<br>
The present invention is especially directed to prevention of the transfer of the infections<br>
from animals to human beings and vice versa. Such transfer is an important mechanism in<br>
pathogenesis of many diarrheas such as diseases caused by EHEC including the so called<br>
hamburger disease. When cattle or food products from cattle or pets or other animals are<br>
transferred between countries there are also risks for spreading infectious diseases such as<br>
diarhhea.<br>
Replacement of traditional antibiotics<br>
The need of anti-infective therapies for animals is urgent as use of traditional antibiotics is<br>
not acceptable and even getting prohibited. The therapies aim to replace totally or partially<br>
the traditional antibiotics in animal nutrition and treatments.<br>
The present invention show receptor sequences which are also described for animals living<br>
in proximity to humans and they probably have a role in the transfer of the infection from<br>
cattle to human. The present invention also shows actual binding of human diarrhea-<br>
causing E. coli bacteria to animal glycolipds. Some of the glycolipid receptors are same<br>
between animals and human intestinal tissues. The present invention is also directed to the<br>
receptors which are specific for animals, several animal specific receptor or receptors more<br>
common in animals. Preferred animals to which the invention is directed are major cattle<br>
or farm animals such as cows and other domestic ruminants, pigs, sheep, horses, poultry<br>
including for example hens, ducks and turkeys and rabbits or pet animals such as dogs, cats<br>
or rodents species including mice and rats or hamsters or guinea pigs and rabbits. Most of<br>
the common pet animal can be also used as laboratory animals, whose healthy is important<br>
for the experiments. Animals may also be in need of theraphy in nature or in sanctuaries or<br>
in zoos for example. Primates, especially chimpanzees and apes, are especially at risk of<br>
being infected by human pathogens as they are the most close human relatives. Most<br>
preferred animal species to be treated according to the invention are dogs, cats, pigs and<br>
cows.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the search of animal specific receptors for diarrhea<br>
causing bacteria.<br>
TheN-glycolyl-neuraminic acid containing oligosaccharide sequences are mostly animal<br>
specific as biosynthetic enzymes making this structure are not present in humans. The<br>
human receptors comprising this monosaccharide are probably synthesized from the<br>
monosaccharide arising from animal foods. NeuGc is a common monosaccharide in many<br>
animals. Glycopeptides comprising this monosaccharide has been used aGalnst diarrhea in<br>
calves aGalnst animal specific K99 E. coli. Present invention describes several NeuGc-<br>
oligosaccharide sequences which can be used in animals when the animal is infected by<br>
cross-reactive E.coli.<br>
Ex vivo uses of the present invention<br>
It is realized mat the present invention can be used for inhibition of pathogens especially<br>
diarrhea causing E. coli ex vivo and such method has use in disinfection and preservation<br>
type applications. It is preferred to use the receptor oligosaccharide sequences according<br>
to the present invention as part of single substances or as single substances or more<br>
preferably as composition comprising at least two receptor oligosaccharide sequences from<br>
different groups according to the present invention for inhibition pathogens, preferably E.<br>
coli ex vivo. Polyvalent conjuGates according to the present invention, especially soluble<br>
polyvalent conjuGates which can agglutinate pathogens, preferably diarrheagenic E. coli,<br>
are preferred for ex vivo uses. One special ex vivo embodiment of the invention is the<br>
cleansing or disinfection of surfaces, e.g., of tables, medical devices and packages, in<br>
hospital or hospital-like enviroment with a cleanser or disinfectant containing the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences described in the present invention. The receptor saccharides<br>
described by the invention can also be used as ingredients in a soap or detergent used for<br>
washing or bathing of patients in hospital or hospital-like enviroment.<br>
Oral infections and oral health products<br>
It is realized that infections targetted by the present invention spread throuGh oral route,<br>
possibly also from nose to the oral cavity. The present invention is directed to the<br>
prevention of the infections already in human mouth. The present invention is directed to<br>
the treatment of oral infections by at least two different oligosaccharide sequences which<br>
can inhibit at least two different binding specificities of pathogen, preferably orally<br>
infecting bacterium and more preferably a diarrhea causing bacterium. It is preferred to use<br>
the receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention as part of single<br>
substances or as single substances or as composition comprising at least two receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences from different groups according to the present invention for<br>
inhibition of oral or nasal infections. According to the present invention the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention are used as compositions or<br>
as separate substances in products inhibiting pathogens, called here mouth hygiene<br>
products, in human mouth.<br>
It is realized that human mouth comprises similar receptors as human intestine especially<br>
on proteins at least neolacto-receptors, mannose receptors and oligosaccharide receptors<br>
resembling fucose receptors according to the present invention. As a separate embodiment<br>
it is realized that the substances and compositions according to the present invention are<br>
also useful in inhibiting pathogens causing caries. In a specific embodiment the present<br>
invention is also directed to the compositions according to the present invention for<br>
treatment of other orally spreading infections such as infection causing otitis media or lung<br>
infections including influenza, bronchitis or pneumonia. The mouth hygiene products<br>
according to the present invention can also be directed aGalnst caries, otitis media,<br>
bronchitis and pneumonia. In a specific embodiment the composition to used in mouth<br>
hygiene product or for inhibition of a pathogen infecting orally comprises at least<br>
oligosaccharide sequences Neu5Aca3GalpaGlcNAc and/or Neu5Aca3Gal|$4Glc or more<br>
preferably Neu5Aca6Gal|$4GlcNAc and/or Neu5Aca6GalpaGlc and it is directed at least<br>
aGalnst human influenza virus, preferably for prophylaxis of influenza virus.<br>
The present invention is especially directed to mouth hygiene products comprising<br>
substances or compositions comprising pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide sequences,<br>
especially oligosaccharide sequences according to the invention. The mouth hygiene<br>
product is preferably selected from the group consisting of tooth pastes, mouth wash<br>
solutions, mouth tablets, chewing tablets, and chewing gums. It is preferred to use either<br>
monovalent receptor oligosaccharide sequences or polyvalent receptor oligosaccharide<br>
sequences. In another preferred embodiment the mouth hygiene product comprises<br>
polyvalent oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention. Due to size of<br>
human mouth and volume of liquid saliva on its surface relatively small amount of<br>
oligosaccharides is enouGh to obtain saturating rating concentrations of pathogen<br>
inhibiting receptors in mouth. The typical amounts of receptor active monovalent epitopes<br>
varies from about 100 nmol to 100 pxaol of the receptor active oligosaccharide, (at<br>
molecular weight 1000 Da this would be 100 \ig to 100 nig). More generally useful<br>
amounts are estimated to be between about 1-10 umol. In a separate embodiment the<br>
present invention about therapeutical composition is also directed to pathogen inhibiting<br>
nasal sprays. The nasal sprays can be directed aGalnst otitis media or lung infections.<br>
Topical, washing and cosmetic products<br>
It is realized that the common pathogens can spread on human surfaces such as human<br>
skin, genital epithelia, hair, household surfaces, and other surfaces in human environment.<br>
The oligosacchride sequences according to the present invention are also useful for<br>
prevention of the pathogens also in these environments. It is therefore also preferred to use<br>
the oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention as single substances, as<br>
part of single substances, or as composition comprising at least two receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences from different groups according to the present invention in<br>
topical or cosmetic products, for example as creams, lotions, or gels. It is also preferred to<br>
use the substances or compositions according to the present invention products aimed for<br>
washing human skin, hair or genital epithelia, (which can be also called as personal<br>
hygiene products), or for household surfaces, dishes or clothes. Traditional antibiotics have<br>
been aimed for use of household washing solutions, but are not useful because of<br>
resistance problems which are not likely with the substances according to the present<br>
invention. In preferred embodiment polyvalent oligosaccharide sequences are used for<br>
washing solutions, in another preferred embodiment monovalent oligosaccharide<br>
sequences are used for washing solutions.<br>
Food safety products to be applied to foods or feeds, beverages, drinks and water<br>
Besides the therapeutic uses in humans or in animals the invention is also directed to the<br>
use of receptors and compositions according to the invention for the prevention of the<br>
infections by using the invention to neutralize pathogens or bacteria inside or on surfaces<br>
of food products. Carbohydrates according to the present invention can for example be<br>
applied on the surfaces of meat products or animal bodies, body parts in meat production<br>
to prevent the spreading of pathogens. Use of soluble and other polyvalent conjuGates to<br>
cover and agglutinate the bacteria are preferred. A specific method to be used on a surface<br>
of a solid or semi-solid food product involves contacting the bacteria with the<br>
carbohydrates receptors described by the invention and optionally washing away the<br>
pathogen carbohydrate complexes. This kind of method is not acceptable with traditional<br>
antibiotics. The carbohydrates according to the invention can be also applied to liquid food<br>
products or concentrates or powder to make these including milk and liquid milk like<br>
products, various beverages including juices, soft drinks, sport drinks, alcoholic beverages<br>
and the like.<br>
In a specific embodiment the carbohydrate according to the invention in polymeric form is<br>
applied to a liquid food product or a beverage product, potential pathogens are agglutinated<br>
by the polyvalent conjuGate and the agglutinated complex is removed by a method based<br>
on size or solubility of the complex. Non-soluble agglutinates can be removed when these<br>
precipitate by standard methods like decanting the solution above the precipitate or more<br>
usually more effectively by filtration methods.<br>
Filtration methods can be used to remove larger agglutinated complexes.<br>
Preferred foods to be treated with carbohydrates according to the invention include various<br>
animal food products, especially meat products and middle products in processing. Many<br>
pathogens including diarrhea causing E. coli bacteria are transmitted effectively from<br>
vegetables, fruits, salads and other plant foods which are not properly washed. The food<br>
stuffs which need washing, but are not washed properly or washed with contaminated<br>
water are especially problematic in developing countries. The present invention is also<br>
directed to methods for increasing food safety of plant foods and other foods in need of<br>
washing to control the amount of pathogens, especially pathogenic E. coli bacteria in the<br>
food products. The invention is especially directed to home customer products and<br>
products aimed for the food industry to prevent infections from food. The product is<br>
preferentially in solid form as powder or pill or in a capsule containing solutions of the<br>
receptors according to the invention, which can be applied to food under processing. Such<br>
product can be used to prevent diarrheas in developing countries especially diarrheas in<br>
children. The food safety product is also directed to the prevention of travellers diarrheas.<br>
The food safety products and feed safety products below can be considered as novel safe<br>
preservatives.<br>
Filter products to purify beverages and water<br>
Contaminated drinks and water are major cause of gastrointestinal diseases, especially<br>
diarrheas.<br>
The receptors according to the present invention can be also used to make filters to purify<br>
pathogens, especially bacteria from liquid food and beverages and water, especially water<br>
used for drinking and preparing foods. Preferentially at least two recptor structures are<br>
used. Methods are known to produce solid phase materials to which carbohydrate<br>
sequences are conjuGtated to be used as filters for example from cellulose or plastics or<br>
agarose and similar materials. The filters according to the invention also include affinity<br>
chromatography material known in the art. Methods to remove bound materials from such<br>
filters are known and in a specific embodiment the filter is regenerated by removing the<br>
contaminant and optionally sterilizing the filter by heat or other sterilizing means.<br>
Feed safety products<br>
The food safety products described above can be also applied to animal solid and liquid<br>
feeds and drinking water of animals. Preferred target animals to be protected includes pet<br>
animals, especially cats and dogs and cattle or farm animal such as cows and other<br>
domestic ruminants, pigs, sheep, horses, poultry including for example hens, ducks and<br>
turkeys, and rabbits.<br>
Water, food and feed safety analytics.<br>
Standard analytic and diagnostic methods in combination with the receptor carbohydrates<br>
according to the invention can be applied to water, beverages, foods and feeds to measure<br>
presence pathogens binding to the receptor carbohydrates. The knowledge of the binding<br>
specificities of contaminating pathogens can be applied to design of theraphy when<br>
patients are infected or to methods for food safety remove or control pathogens as<br>
described above.<br>

inhibit carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions and carbohydrate-lectin interactions.<br>
The carbohydrate compositions and substances comprises of oligosaccharide sequences.<br>
The oligosaccharides inhibit one or several pathogens by binding one or several pathogens<br>
and/or by binding the receptors of one or several pathogens. Preferentially at least two<br>
pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide sequences are used and more preferentially at least<br>
three pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide sequences. In other embodiments at least four,<br>
five, six, or seven pathogenesis inhibiting oligosaccharide sequences are used.<br>
In specific theraphies one or several of the oligosaccharide sequences are given separately<br>
at different time points. This is especially useful when the administration of all the<br>
oligosaccharide sequences would have negative effects on the normal flora. The separate<br>
administration of the therapeutic compositions can be useful also because of effect of<br>
nutritional situation in the gastrointestinal tract could change differently the stability of the<br>
on the oligosaccharide sequences according to the inventionin the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Use of the invention together with probiotic bacteria<br>
When the invention is used to inhibit bacterial binding, especially multiple bacterial<br>
bindings, also some beneficial bacterial bindings can be prevented. The normal bacterial<br>
flora has many important functions for example in the human gastrointestinal system. The<br>
destruction of the normal bacterial flora is however an even larger problem with use of<br>
traditional antibiotics.<br>

cholesterol and fats. In a preferred embodiment one or several pathogen inhibiting<br>
carbohydrates are chosen so that they are also prebiotic substances like carbohydrates with<br>
a non-reducing terminal beta linked galactose residue. In a preferred form of therapy<br>
a) pathogens and potentially part of the normal flora are first removed by one or more<br>
preferentially at least two carbohydrates according to the invention<br>
b) probiotic microbe and/or prebiotic substance are applied.<br>
Stepa 1 and 2 may also be applied in reversed order, preferably with a large amount of the<br>
probiotic microbe and/or prebiotic substance and then step one. According to the invention<br>
it is also possible to repeat steps 1 and/or 2 several times while varying the order of the<br>
steps. Steps 1 and 2 may be applied at the same time. The substances according to the<br>
invention can be administered together with probiotic microbe and/or prebiotic substance<br>
or alternatively probiotic microbe and/or prebiotic substance can be included in the<br>
compositions according to the invention, and then steps 1 and 2 above can be performed<br>
simultaneously.<br>

multiple strains can be also indicated by letter s after the abbreviation like in "EHECs".<br>
In this invention the terms "analog" and "derivative" are defined as follows. According to<br>
the present invention it is possible to design structural analogs or derivatives of the<br>
Escherichia coli binding oligosaccharide sequences. Thus, the invention is also directed to<br>
the structural analogs of the substances according to the invention. The structural analogs<br>
according to the invention comprise the structural elements important for the binding of<br>
Escherichia coli to the oligosaccharide sequences. For design of effective structural<br>
analogs it is important to know the structural element important for the binding between<br>
Escherichia coli and the saccharides. The important structural elements are preferably not<br>
modified or these are modified by very close mimetics of the important structural element.<br>
These elements preferably include the 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of the Galpa residue in<br>
the trisaccharide and oligosaccharide epitopes. Also the positioning of the linkages<br>
between the ring structures is an important structural element. For a high affinity binding<br>
the acetamido group or acetamido mimicking group is preferred in the position<br>
corresponding to the acetamido group of the reducing end-GlcNAc of the di-or<br>
trisaccharide epitopes. Acetamido group mimicking group may be another amide, such as<br>
alkylamido, arylamido, secondary amine, preferentially N-ethyl or N-methyl, O-acetyl, or<br>
O-alkyl for example O-ethyl or O-methyl.<br>
The structural derivatives according to the invention are oligosaccharide sequences<br>
according to the invention modified chemically so that the binding to the Escherichia coli<br>
is retained or increased. According to the invention it is preferred to derivatize one or<br>
several of the hydroxyl or acetamido groups of the oligosaccharide sequences. The<br>
invention used to describe several positions of the molecules which could be changed<br>
when preparing the analogs or the derivatives. Preferred derivatives of the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention include reducing-end<br>
derivatives of the oligosaccharide sequences. Multiple derivatization methods are known<br>
to link oligogosaccharides to other carbohydrates, aglycon molecules or various carriers.<br>
The Cl -carbon of the reducing end monosaccharide residue can be linked throuGh a<br>
sulphur, carbon or nitrogen atoms to other carbohydrates, aglycon molecules or various<br>
carriers, especially polyvalent carriers. Methods such as reductive amination can be used<br>
when the pathogen binding carbohydrate epitope is not destroyed by opening the reducing<br>
end monosaccharide residue. Derivatives of acetamido groups are also preferred.<br>
Acetamido- groups can be deacetylated and derivatized for example by other carboxylic<br>
acids, the acetamido-derivatives can be screened for better pathogen binding. The<br>
derivatives can also be produced from precursors of the oligosaccharide to be derivatized<br>
for example from oligosaccharide sequences comprising hexosamine-residues. Methods to<br>
produce oligosaccharide analogs for the binding of a lectin are well known. For example,<br>
numerous analogs of sialyl-Lewis x oligosaccharide have been produced, representing the<br>
active functional groups on different scaffolds, see page 12090 Sears and Wong 1996.<br>
Similarly, analogs of heparin oligosaccharides has been produced by Sanofi Corporation<br>
and sialic acid-mimicking inhibitors such as Zanamivir and Tamiflu (Relenza) for the<br>
sialidase enzyme by numerous groups. Preferably the oligosaccharide analog is built on a<br>
molecule comprising at least one six- or five-membered ring structure, more preferably the<br>
analog contains at least two ring structures comprising 6 or 5 atoms.<br>
In mimicking structures monosaccharide rings may be replaced rings such as cyclohexane<br>
or cyclopentane, aromatic rings including benzene ring, heterocyclic ring structures may<br>
comprise besides oxygen for example nitrogen and sulphur atoms. To lock the active ring<br>
conformations the ring structures may be interconnected by tolerated linker groups.<br>
Typical mimetic structures may also comprise peptide analog-structures for the<br>
oligosaccharide sequence or part of it.<br>
The effects of the active groups to binding activity are cumulative and lack of one group<br>
could be compensated by adding an active residue on the other side of the molecule.<br>
Molecular modelling, preferably by a computer can be used to produce analog structures<br>
for the Escherichia coli binding oligosaccharide sequences according to the invention. The<br>
results from the molecular modelling of several oligosacharide sequences are given in<br>
examples and the same or similar methods, besides NMR and X-ray crystallographic<br>
methods, can be used to obtain structures for other oligosaccharide sequences according to<br>
the invention. It is also noted that the monovalent, oligovalent or polyvalent<br>
oligosaccharides can be activated to have higher activity towards the lectins by making<br>
derivatives of the oligosaccharide by combinatorial chemistry. When the library is created<br>
by substituting one or a few residues in the oligosacharide sequence, it can be considered<br>
as derivative library, alternatively when the library is created from the analogs of the<br>
oligosaccharide sequences described by the invention. A combinatorial chemistry library<br>
can be built on the oligosaccharide or its precursor or on glycoconjuGates according to the<br>
invention. For example, oligosaccharides with variable reducing ends can be produced by<br>
so called carbohydrid technology. In a preferred embodiment a combinatorial chemistry<br>
library is conjuGated to the Escherichia coli binding substances described by the invention.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the library comprises at least 6 different molecules. Such<br>
library is preferred for use of assaying microbial binding to the oligosaccharide sequences<br>
according to the invention. Amino acids or collections of organic amides are commercially<br>
available and can be used for the synthesis of combinatorial library of acetamido analogs.<br>
A high affinity binder could be identified from the combinatorial library for example by<br>
using an inhibition assay, in which the library compounds are used to inhibit the bacterial<br>
binding to the glycolipids or glycoconjuGates described by the invention. Structural<br>
analogs and derivatives preferred according to the invention can inhibit the binding of the<br>
Escherichia coli binding oligosaccharide sequences according to the invention to<br>
Escherichia coli.<br>
Neolacto-receptor analog trisaccharide epitopes comprising glucose at the reducing end<br>
Steric hindrance by the lipid part or the proximity of the silica surface probably may limit<br>
the measurement of the neolacto-analogous epitope GlcNAcß3GalpaGlc in current TLC-<br>
assay. Considering the contribution of the terminal monosaccharide to the binding<br>
indicates that Glc could be allowed at the reducing end of the epitope. The trisaccharide<br>
epitopes with Glc at reducing end are considered as effective analogs of the Escherichia<br>
coli binding substance when present in oligovalent or more preferably in polyvalent form.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is the saccharides with Glc at reducing end,<br>
which are used as free reducing saccharides with high concentration, preferably in the<br>
range 1 -100 g/1, more preferably 1—20 g/l. It is realized that these saccharides may have<br>
minor activity in the concentration range 0,1 - 1 g/l.<br>
In the present invention the pathogen receptor or pathogen inhibitor by other words,<br>
especially receptors for diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, are described as oligosaccharide<br>
sequences. The oligosaccharide sequence defined here can be a part of a natural or<br>
synthetic glycoconjuGate or a free oligosaccharide or a part of a free oligosaccharide. Such<br>
oligosaccharide sequences can be bonded to various monosaccharides or oligosaccharides<br>
or polysaccharides on polysaccharide chains, for example, if the saccharide sequence is<br>
expressed as part of a bacterial polysaccharide. Moreover, numerous natural modifications<br>
of monosaccharides are known as exemplified by O-acetyl or sulphated derivative of<br>
oligosaccharide sequences. The Escherichia coli receptor oligosaccharide sequence<br>
defined here can comprise the oligosaccharide sequence described as a part of a natural or<br>
synthetic glycoconjuGate or a corresponding free oligosaccharide or a part of a free<br>
oligosaccharide. The Escherichia coli receptor oligosaccharide sequence can also comprise<br>
a mix of the Escherichia coli receptor oligosaccharide sequences. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the the oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention are non-<br>
reducing terminal oligosaccharide sequences, which means here that the oligosaccharide<br>
sequences are not linked to other monosaccharide or oligosaccharide structures except<br>
optionally from the reducing end of the oligosaccharide sequence. The oligosaccharide<br>
sequence when present as conjuGate is preferably conjuGated from the reducing end of the<br>
oligosaccharide sequence, thouGh other linkage positions which are tolerated by the<br>
pathogen binding can be also used. In a more specific embodiment the oligosaccharide<br>
sequence according to the present invention means the corresponding oligosaccharide<br>
residue which is not linked by natural glycosidic linkages to other monosaccharide or<br>
oligosaccharide structures. The oligosaccharide residue is preferably a free oligosaccharide<br>
or a conjuGate or derivative from the reducing end of the oligosaccharide residue.<br>
The pathogen receptor oligosaccharide sequences can be synthesized enzymatically by<br>
glycosyltransferases, or by transglycosylation catalyzed by glycosidase or transglycosidase<br>
enzymes (Ernst et al, 2000). Specifies of these enzymes and the use of co-factors can be<br>
engineered. Specific modified enzymes can be used to obtain more effective synthesis, for<br>
example, glycosyntbase is modified to do transglycosylation only. Organic synthesis of the<br>
saccharides and the conjuGates described herein or compounds similar to these are known<br>
(Ernst et al., 2000). Saccharide materials can be isolated from natural sources and modified<br>
chemically or enzymatically into the pathogen receptor compounds. Natural<br>
oligosaccharides can be isolated from milks produced by various ruminants. Transgenic<br>
organisms, such as cows or microbes, expressing glycosylating enzymes can be used for<br>
the production of saccharides.<br>
In a separate embodiment the pathogen receptor substance, when the oligosaccharide is not an<br>
asialo-gangliosacharide or lacto-receptor or neolacto-receptor, may be conjuGated to an antibiotic<br>
substance, preferably a penicillin type antibiotic. The pathogen receptor substance targets the<br>
antibiotic to pathogen. Such conjuGate substance is beneficial in treatment because a lower amount<br>
of antibiotic is needed for treatment or therapy aGalnst Escherichia coli, which leads to lower side<br>
effect of the antibiotic. The antibiotic part of the conjuGate is aimed at killing or weakening the<br>
bacteria, but the conjuGate may also have an antiadhesive effect as described by the invention.<br>
Present invention is specifically directed to composition comprising at least two receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention as conjuGates with a traditional<br>
antibiotic or several traditional antibiotics. The receptor oligosaccharide sequences and the<br>
antibiotic may be linked to a polyvalent carrier. The compositions are preferably targeted aGalnst<br>
gastrointestinal infection, more preferably aGalns diarrhea causing E. coli.<br>
The pathogen receptor substances, preferably in oligovalent or clustered form, can be used to treat<br>
a disease or condition caused by the presence of the pathogen, preferably diarrhea causing<br>
Escherichia coli. This is done by using the Escherichia coli receptor substances for anti-adhesion,<br>
i.e. to inhibit the binding of Escherichia coli to the receptor epitopes of the target cells or tissues.<br>
When the Escherichia coli binding substance or pharmaceutical composition is administered it will<br>
compete with receptor glycoconjuGates on the target cells for the binding of the bacteria. Some or<br>
all of the bacteria will then be bound to the Escherichia coli receptor substance instead of the<br>
receptor on the target cells or tissues. The bacteria bound to the Escherichia coli receptor<br>
substances are then removed from the patient (for example by the fluid flow in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract), resulting in reduced effects of the bacteria on the health of the patient. Preferably the<br>
substance used is a soluble composition comprising the Escherichia coli receptor substances. The<br>
substance can be attached to a carrier substance which is preferably not a protein. When using a<br>
carrier molecule several molecules of the Escherichia coli receptor substance can be attached to<br>
one carrier and inhibitory efficiency is improved.<br>
It is shown in the present invention that Escherichia coli can bind several kinds of oligosaccharide<br>
sequences. Some of the binding by specific strains may represent more symbiotic interactions<br>
which do not lead to severe conditions. Therefore total removal of the bacteria may not be<br>
necessary for the prevention of the diseases related to Escherichia coli. The less pathogenic<br>
bacteria may even have a probiotic effect in the prevention of more pathogenic strains of<br>
Escherichia coli.<br>
According to the invention it is possible to incorporate the Escherichia coli receptor<br>
substance, optionally with a carrier, in a pharmaceutical composition, which is suitable for<br>
the treatment of a condition due to the presence of Escherichia coli in a patient or to use<br>
the Escherichia coli binding substance in a method for treatment of such conditions.<br>
Examples of conditions treatable according to the invention are and related gastrointestinal<br>
diseases, all, at least partially, caused by the Escherichia coli infection.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition containing the pathogen receptor preferably diarrhegenic<br>
Escherichia coli-receptor substance may also comprise other substances, such as an inert<br>
vehicle, or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, preservatives etc, which are well known<br>
to persons skilled in the art. The pathogen receptor, preferably diarrhegenic Escherichia<br>
coli-receptor-substance, can be administered together with other druGs such as antibiotics<br>
used aGalnst the pathogen or specifically Escherichia coli.<br>
The pathogen receptor, preferably diarrheagenic Escherichia coli-receptor substance or<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing such substance, may be administered in any<br>
suitable way, althouGh an oral administration is preferred.<br>
The receptor oligosaccharide sequences according to the present invention are aimed for<br>
use in inhibition aGalnst pathogens, especially pathogenic bacteria, and the receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences are also referred as pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide<br>
sequences. In more specific embodiments the pathogen is diarrhea causing E. coli and the<br>
receptor oligosaccharides are also referred as pathogen inhibiting oligosaccharide<br>
sequences or as E. coli receptor substances. The naming of the specific receptor<br>
oligosaccharide sequences and other longer terms may vary with regard to use of dash or<br>
capital letter as first letter, for example "lacto-receptor" and "lacto receptor" and "Lacto-<br>
receptor" and "Lacto receptor" mean the same.<br>
The term "purified fraction" used herein relates purified or isolated oligosaccharide<br>
fraction from natural or synthetic sources. In a preferred embodiment the amount of the<br>
active oligosaccharide sequnce or oligosaccharide sequences is analysed and/or controlled<br>
from the fraction, optionally the amounts of other related carbohydrate structures are also<br>
analysed. The purified fraction has reduced amount of inactive substances originating from<br>
the source of the fraction, for example protein, monosaccharide precursors, lactose, or fat.<br>
Potentially harmful substances, such as harmful chemicals from synthesis, allergenic<br>
proteins, or substances considered ethically harmful, for example by religious or diet<br>
culture reasons, are removed to a level where these are not harmful in the final product.<br>
For medical use the purified fraction is preferably essentially pure (i.e. a purity of 98 % or<br>
better), or non-relevant substances are controlled and comprise preferably at least less than<br>
half of the mass of the purified fraction, more preferably less than 20% of the mass of the<br>
purified fraction and most preferably less than 5 % of the mass of the purified fraction. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the production of the purified fraction from animal<br>
milk or milks involves at least partial removal of milk protein and/or fat. The purification<br>
may comprise filtration methods, such as gelfiltration or ultrafiltration, as well as drying<br>
and/or concentrating steps. For non-medical use the purified fraction is preferably<br>
essentially pure or the non-relevant substances comprise preferably at least less than 95 %<br>
of the mass of the purified fraction, more preferably less than 75% of the mass of the<br>
purified fraction and most preferably less than 25 % of the mass of the purified fraction.<br>
The purified fraction may be used as such or together with other ingredients of the desired<br>
product.<br>
The term "treatment" used herein relates both to treatment in order to cure or alleviate a<br>
disease or a condition, and to treatment in order to prevent the development of a disease or<br>
a condition. The treatment may be either performed in a acute or in a chronic way.<br>
The term "patient", as used herein, relates to any human or non-human mammal in need of<br>
treatment according to the invention. The present infection is especially directed for the<br>
treatment of intestinal infections, especially diarrheas, when the patient is a human patient.<br>
It is also possible to use the pathogen receptor preferably diarrhegenic Escherichia coli-<br>
receptor substance in screening for substances that bind to the receptor substance, for<br>
example for screening of carbohydrates (by carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions) that<br>
bind to the Escherichia coli receptor substance. The screening can be done for example by<br>
affinity chromatography.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to use substances specifically binding or inactivating the<br>
Escherichia coli receptor substances present on human tissues and thus prevent the binding<br>
of Escherichia coli. Examples of such substances include plant lectins such as Erythrina<br>
cristagalli and Erythrina corallodendron (Teneberg et al, 1994). When used in humans,<br>
the binding substance should be suitable for such use such as a humanized antibody or a<br>
recombinant glycosidase of human origin which is non-immunogenic and capable of<br>
cleaving the terminal monosaccharide residue/residues from the Escherichia coli receptor<br>
substances. However, in the gastrointestinal tract, many naturally occuring lectins and<br>
glycosidases originating for example from food are tolerated.<br>
Nutritional, food and feed uses<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to use the pathogen receptor oligosaccharide sequences or<br>
Escherichia coli receptor oligosaccharide as part of a nutritional composition including<br>
food- and feedstuff. It is preferred to use the receptor oligosaccharide sequences according<br>
to the present invention in isngle substances or as single substances and more preferably in<br>
composition comprising at least two receptor oligosaccharide sequences from different<br>
groups according to the present invention for nutritional compositions, foods or feed stuffs.<br>
It is preferred to use the Escherichia coli receptor oligosacharide sequences as substances<br>
or compositions as a part of so called functional or functionalized food. The said functional<br>
food has a positive effect on the person"s or animal"s health by inhibiting or preventing the<br>
binding of Escherichia coli to target cells or tissues. The Escherichia coli receptor<br>
substance or composition can be a part of a defined food or functional food composition.<br>
The functional food can contain other acceptable food ingredients accepted by authorities<br>
such as Food and DruG Administration in the USA. The Escherichia coli receptor<br>
substance or composition can also be used as a nutritional additive, preferably as a food or<br>
a beverage additive to produce a functional food or a functional beverage. The food or<br>
food additive can also be produced by having ,e.g., a domestic animal such as a cow or<br>
other animal produce the Escherichia coli receptor substance or composition in larger<br>
amounts naturally in its milk. This can be accomplished by having the animal overexpress<br>
suitable glycosyltransferases in its milk. A specific strain or species of a domestic animal<br>
can be chosen and bred for larger production of the Escherichia coli receptor substance or<br>
composition. The Escherichia coli receptor substance or composition for a nutritional<br>
composition or nutritional additive can also be produced by a microorganisms such as a<br>
bacteria or a yeast.<br>
It is especially useful to have the Escherichia coli receptor substance or composition as<br>
part of a food for an infant, preferably as a part of an infant formula. Many infants are fed<br>
by special formulas in replacement of natural human milk. The formulas may lack the<br>
special lactose based oligosaccharides of human milk, especially the elongated ones such<br>
as lacto-N-neotetraose, GalpaGlcNAcß3Galß4Glc, lacto-N-tetraose,<br>
Galß3GlcNAcß3GalpaGlc, and derivatives thereof. The lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-<br>
neotetraose para-lacto-N-hexaose (Galß3GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc andpara-<br>
lacto-N-neohexaose (GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc) as well as<br>
Galß3GalpaGlc are known from human milk and can therefore be considered as safe<br>
additives or ingredients in an infant food. Sialylated and/or fucosylated human milk<br>
oligosaccharides and buffalo milk oligosaccharide GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc,<br>
described as pathogen receptors according to the present invention, are also preferred for<br>
functional foods and infant formulas. It is preferred to use combinations comprising at<br>
least two of the milk oligosaccharides. Diarrhea causing Escherichia coli is especially<br>
infective with regard to infants or young children, and considering the diseases it may later<br>
cause it is reasonable to prevent the infection.<br>
Preferred concentrations for human milk oligosaccharides in functional food to be<br>
consumed (for example, in reconstituted infant formula) are similar to those present in<br>
natural human milk. It is noted that natural human milk contains numerous free<br>
oligosaccharides and glycoconjuGates (which may be polyvalent) comprising the<br>
oligosaccharide sequence(s) described by the invention, wherefore it is possible to use<br>
even higher than natural concentrations of single molecules to get stronger inhibitory effect<br>
aGalnst Escherichia coli without harmful side effects. Natural human milk contains lacto-<br>
N-neotetraose at least in range about 10-210 mg/1 with individual variations (Nakhla et<br>
ai, 1999). Consequently, lacto-N-neotetraose is preferably used in functional food in<br>
concentration range 0,01 -10 g/1, more preferably 0,01 - 5 g/1, most preferably 0,1 -1 g/1.<br>
Approximately 2-5 times higher amounts of lacto-N-tetraose can be used. Alternatively,<br>
the total concentration of the saccharides used in functional food is the same or similar to<br>
the total concentration of natural human milk saccharides, which bind Escherichia coli like<br>
the substances or composition described, or which contain the binding<br>
epitope/oligosaccharide sequence indicated in the invention.<br>
Sialyl-lactoses and sialyllactosamines occur in bovine milk at concentrations from tens of<br>
microgram per ml to maximum of almost mg per ml of all three major oligosaccharides<br>
together NeuNAca3GalpaGlc, NeuNAca6Gal|J4GlcNAc and NeuNAcct6GalpaGlc in<br>
early colostrums (Nakamura et al 2003). The amounts of 0,01 -10 g/1, more preferably<br>
0,01-5 g/l, most preferably 0,1 - 1 g/1 are preferred for products. NeuNAcat6GalpaGlc<br>
occurs in largest amount in bovine milk and it is also preferred as effective inhibitor<br>
aGalnst diarrheagenic E. coli.<br>
Infant formulas also comprise, beside substances or compositions according to the present<br>
invention, other substances used in infant formulas such as fractions from ruminant milks<br>
such as proteins from whey or soy protein preparations or protein hydrolysates. The infant<br>
formula may also comprise other carbohydrates useful or accepted for infant formulas such<br>
as lactose or galactose oligosaccharides.<br>
Preferably, the nutritional formulation of the present invention contains edible<br>
macronutrients, vitamins and minerals in amounts desired for a particular use. The<br>
amounts of such ingredients will vary depending on whether the formulation is intended<br>
for use with normal, healthy infants, children, adults or subjects having specialized needs<br>
such as those accompany certain pathological conditions (e.g., metabolic disorders). It will<br>
be understood by persons skilled in the art that the components utilized in a nutritional<br>
formulation of the present invention are of semi-purified or purified origin. By semi-<br>
purified or purified is meant a material which has been prepared by purification of a<br>
natural material or by synthesis. These techniques are well known in the art (See, e.g.,<br>
Code of Federal Regulations for Food Ingredients and Food Processing; Recommended<br>
Dietary Allowances, 10th Ed., National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 1989).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nutritional formulation of the present invention is an infant<br>
enteral nutritional product. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, a nutritional<br>
formulation is provided that is suitable for feeding to infants. The formula comprises, in<br>
addition to the above described oligosaccharides, vitamins and minerals in amounts<br>
designed to provide the daily nutritional requirements of infants.<br>
The macronutritional components include for example, edible fats, carbohydrates and<br>
proteins. Exemplary edible fats are coconut oil, soy oil, and mono- and diglycerides.<br>
Exemplary carbohydrates are glucose, food grade (edible) lactose and hydrolyzed<br>
cornstarch. A typical protein source would be for example, soy protein, electrodialysed<br>
whey or electrodialysed skim milk or milk whey, or the hydrolysates of these proteins,<br>
althouGh other protein sources are also available and may be used. These macronutrients<br>
would be added in the form of commonly accepted nutritional compounds in an amount<br>
equivalent to those present in human milk on an energy basis, i.e., on a per calorie basis.<br>
The infant formula would preferably include the following vitamins and minerals: calcium,<br>
phosphorous, potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc,<br>
selenium, iodine, and Vitamins A, E, D, C, and the B complex.<br>
The infant formula can be sterilized and subsequently utilized on a ready-to-feed (RTF)<br>
basis or stored in a concentrated liquid or a powder. The powder can be prepared for<br>
example, by spray drying the infant formula prepared as indicated above, and the formula<br>
can be reconstituted for example, by rehydrating the concentrate. Infant nutritional<br>
formulas are well known in the art and commercially available (e.g., SimilacRTM. and<br>
Alimentum.RTM. from Ross Products Division, Abbott Laboratories).<br>
Examples of nutritional compositions of the present invention include but are not limited<br>
to infant formulas, dietary supplements, dietary substitutes, and rehydration compositions,<br>
the latter of which may also be considered as pharmaceutical compositions. Nutritional<br>
compositions of particular interest include but are not limited to those utilized for enteral<br>
and parenteral supplementation for infants, specialist infant formulas, supplements for the<br>
elderly, and supplements for those with gastrointestinal difficulties and/or malabsorption.<br>
Certainly the young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are particularly suspectible<br>
to suffering serious, and even fatal, effects from the toxins.<br>
The nutritional compositions of the present invention may also be added to food even<br>
when supplementation of the diet is not required. For example, the composition may be<br>
added to food of any type including but not limited to margarines, modified butters,<br>
cheeses, milk, yogurt, chocolate, candy, snacks, salad oils, cooking oils, cooking fats,<br>
meats, fish and beverages.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nutritional composition is an<br>
enteral nutritional product, more preferably, an adult or pediatric enteral nutritional<br>
product. For example, this composition may be administered to adults or children<br>
experiencing gastrointestinal distress or having specialized needs due to chronic or acute<br>
disease states. The composition may comprise, produced in accordance with the present<br>
invention, macronutrients, vitamins and minerals as described above. The macronutrients<br>
may be present in amounts equivalent to those present in human milk or on an energy<br>
basis, i.e., on a per calorie basis.<br>
Methods for formulating liquid or solid enteral and parenteral nutritional formulas are well<br>
known in the art. The enteral formula, for example, may be sterilized and subsequently<br>
utilized on a ready-to-feed (RTF) basis or stored in a concentrated liquid or lyophilized<br>
powder form. The powder can be prepared by spray drying the formula prepared as<br>
indicated above, and reconstituting it by rehydrating the concentrate. Adult and pediatric<br>
nutritional formulas are well known in the art and are commercially available (e.g.,<br>
Similac(R), Ensure(R), Jevity(R) and Alimentum(R) from Ross Products Division, Abbott<br>
Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio).<br>
The energy density of the nutritional compositions of the present invention, when in liquid<br>
form, may range from about 0.6 Kcal to about 3 Kcal per ml. When in solid or powdered<br>
form, the nutritional supplements may contain from about 1.2 to more than 9 Kcals per<br>
gram, preferably about 3 to 7 Kcals per gm. In general, the osmolality of a liquid product<br>
should be less than 700 mOsm and, more preferably, less than 660 mOsm.<br>
The nutritional formula may include macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals, as noted<br>
above, in addition to the monovalent oligosaccharides of the present invention. The<br>
presence of these additional components helps the individual ingest the minimum daily<br>
requirements of these elements. In addition, it may also be desirable to add zinc, copper,<br>
folic acid and antioxidants to the composition. It is believed that these substance boost a<br>
stressed immune system and will therefore provide further benefits to the individual<br>
receiving the composition. A pharmaceutical composition, as described above, may also be<br>
supplemented with these elements.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the nutritional composition comprises, in addition to<br>
antioxidants and at least one monovalent oligosaccharide, a source of carbohydrate<br>
wherein at least 5 weight percent of the carbohydrate is indigestible oligosaccharide. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment, the nutritional composition additionally comprises protein,<br>
taurine, and carnitine.<br>
Diagnostic and analytical uses related to therapeutical uses<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to use the Escherichia coli binding oligosaccharide receptors<br>
according to the present invention in the diagnosis of a condition caused by an Escherichia<br>
coli infection. Diagnostic uses also include the use of the Escherichia coli binding<br>
substance for typing of Escherichia coli. The typing of E. coli with regard to binding of the<br>
carbohydrate receptors according to the present invention can be used to determine<br>
effective combination of therapeutic carbohydrates for a specific diarrheagenic E. coli<br>
strain. This can be useful for making specific lower cost theraphies for local infections, the<br>
profiles of carbohydrate bindings of major diarrhea causing E. coli may differ in different<br>
geographic locations and during epidemies.<br>
Novel protein bound receptors in human gastrointestinal tract<br>
Present invention shows novel receptors in human gastrointestinal tract. These receptors<br>
are present on glycoproteins and are therefore considered as first contact receptors for<br>
infecting pathogens. The present invention is directed to the use of the novel protein linked<br>
receptors for analysis for binding of pathogens to human gastrointestinal tract The present<br>
invention is directed to the use of the novel protein linked receptors for diagnostics for<br>
pathogens of human gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Samples of protein linked carbohydrates from different position on the gastrointestinal<br>
epithelia were analysed. The novel protein linked receptors include protein bound lacto-<br>
receptors, leolacto-receptor, fucosyl receptors, mannose receptors or sialic acid receptors<br>
according to the invention. The novel protein linked receptors can be used for binding<br>
assay as released oligosacharides or oligosaccharide derivatives, alternatively the protein<br>
linked oligosaccharide sequences can be used as isolated glycoproteins. Corresponding<br>
oligosaccharide sequences can be also produced synthetically. In a preferred embodiment<br>
at least part of O-glycan or N-glycan core structure of the natural protein linked receptor is<br>
included in diagnostic or analysis substances. It is especially preferred to use the sequence<br>
to analyse pathogen binding towards the novel protein linked receptor when the pathogen<br>
is infecting the part of the gastrointestinal epithelium where the novel protein linked<br>
receptor is abundant or especially found.<br>
The novel protein linked receptors can be used for a search or design of analogous<br>
oligosaccharide substances. The analogous substances can be therapeutically useful or can<br>
be used for diagnostics of diarrhea. It is especially preferred to search or design structures<br>
for which there is available effective and economical synthesis.<br>
Structural analysis revealed some preferred protein linked receptor to be used for analysis<br>
or diagnostics with regard to human infections. The mannose receptors are N-glycan type<br>
oligosaccharides. The present invention is directed to diagnostic and analytic uses of high-<br>
mannose or multimannose type N-glycans. The present invention is especially directed to<br>
the uses of high-mannose N-glycans comprising phophate esters. The mannose receptors<br>
are present in all major parts of human gastrointestinal tract. The neolacto-type protein<br>
linked oligosaccharide sequences are in a preferred embodiment N-linked glycans, the<br>
neolacto-type receptors are present in all parts of gastrointestinal tract. The lacto-receptor<br>
was especially observed on glycoproteins of intestinal tissue. The lacto-receptor is more<br>
preferentially present on O-glycan type sequence.<br>
Several fucosylated novel protein bound receptors were found. Lewis a-type sequences<br>
were especially found in intestine and larynx. Other novel fucosylated receptors useful for<br>
analysis of human pathogen binding includes O-glycans comprising Fuca2Gal-structures,<br>
which are present especially on human stomach.<br>
Sialylated novel protein linked receptors includes NeuNAca3Gal- and NeuNAca6Gal -<br>
structures. NeuNAcct3Gal- is in a preferred embodiment present on a N-linked glycan and<br>
NeuNAca6Gal-structures are preferentially present on both N-linked and O-linked<br>
glycans.<br>
The novel protein linked receptors can be also used for search of substances which can<br>
inhibit the binding of the pathogen to the novel protein bound receptor. The substance may<br>
be an antibody, for example an antibody present in milk, which can bind to carbohydrate<br>
receptor binding substance on pathogen. The inhibiting substance may also be a lectin<br>
binding to the novel protein linked receptor, the lectin may be for example a food lectin.<br>
In a specific embodiment it is also realized that the novel protein linked receptors can be<br>
used as receptors or substrates for probiotic bacteria, which adhere and bind or is able to<br>
degradate the structure.<br>
In a specific embodiment it is also realized that the novel protein linked receptors can be<br>
used for diagnostic or analytical methods to analyze the bindings of intestinal pathogens to<br>
the receptor structures and smaller derivatives or anlogues thereof.<br>
When the substance is used for diagnosis or typing, it may be included in, e.g., a probe or a<br>
test stick, optionally constituting a part of a test kit. When this probe or test stick is brouGht<br>
into contact with a sample containing Escherichia coli, the bacteria will bind the probe or<br>
test stick and can be thus removed from the sample and further analyzed. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the test kit comprises at least two oligosaccharide receptors according to the<br>
present invention, more preferably the test kit comprises at least three and most preferably<br>
at least four oligosaccharide receptors according to the present invention. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the test kit comprises seven or all of the oligosaccharide receptors according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
The glycolipid structures are naturally presented in a polyvalent form on cellular<br>
membranes. This type of representation can be mimicked by the solid phase assay<br>
described below or by making liposomes of glycolipids or neoglycolipids.<br>
The present novel neoglycolipids produced by reductive amination of hydrophobic<br>
hexadecylaniline were able to provide effective presentation of the oligosaccharides. Most<br>
previously known neoglycolipid conjuGates used for binding of bacteria have contained<br>
negatively charged groups such as phosphor ester of phosphadityl ethanolaraine<br>
neoglycolipids. Problems of such compounds are negative charge of the substance and<br>
natural biological binding involving the phospholipid structure. Negatively charged<br>
molecules are known to be involved in numerous non-specific bindings with proteins and<br>
other biological substances. Moreover, many of these structures are labile and can be<br>
enzymatically or chemically degraded. The present invention is directed to the non-acidic<br>
conjuGates of oligosaccharide sequences meaning that the oligosaccharide sequences are<br>
linked to non-acidic chemical structures. Preferably, the non-acidic conjuGates are neutral<br>
meaning that the oligosaccharide sequences are linked to neutral, non-charged, chemical<br>
structures. The preferred conjuGates according to the invention are polyvalent substances.<br>
In the previous art bioactive oligosaccharide sequences are often linked to carrier<br>
structures by reducing a part of the receptor active oligosaccharide structure. Hydrophobic<br>
spacers containing alkyl chains (-CFh-),, and/or benzyl rings have been used. However,<br>
hydrophobic structures are in general known to be involved in non-specific interactions<br>
with proteins and other bioactive molecules.<br>
The neoglycolipid data of the examples below show that under the experimental conditions<br>
used in the assay the hexadecylaniline parts of the neoglycolipid compounds do not cause<br>
non-specific binding for the studied bacterium. In the neoglycolipids the hexadecylaniline<br>
part of the conjuGate forms probably a lipid layer like structure and is not available for the<br>
binding. The invention shows that reducing a monosaccharide residue belonging to the<br>
binding epitope may destroy the binding. It was further realized mat a reduced<br>
monosaccharide can be used as a hydrophilic spacer to link a receptor epitope and a<br>
polyvalent presentation structure. According to the invention it is preferred to link the<br>
bioactive oligosaccharide via a hydrophilic spacer to a polyvalent or multivalent carrier<br>
molecule to form a polyvalent or oligovalent/multivalent structure. All polyvalent<br>
(comprising more than 10 receptor active oligosaccharide residues) and<br>
oligovalent/multivalent structures (comprising 2-10 receptor active oligosaccharide<br>
residues) are referred here as polyvalent structures, thouGh depending on the application<br>
oligovalent/multivalent constructs can be more preferred than larger polyvalent structures.<br>
The hydrophilic spacer group comprises preferably at least one hydroxyl group. More<br>
preferably the spacer comprises at least two hydroxyl groups and most preferably the<br>
spacer comprises at least three hydroxyl groups.<br>
According to the invention it is preferred to use polyvalent conjuGates in which the<br>
hydrophilic spacer group linking the oligosaccharide sequences to polyvalent presentation<br>
structure is preferably a flexible chain comprising one or several -CHOH- groups and/or<br>
an amide side chain such as an acetamido -NHCOCH3 or an alkylamido. The hydroxyl<br>
groups and/or the acetamido group also protects the spacer from enzymatic hydrolysis in<br>
vivo. The term flexible means that the spacer comprises flexible bonds and do not form a<br>
ring structure without flexibility. A reduced monosaccharide residues such as ones formed<br>
by reductive animation in the present invention are examples of flexible hydrophilic<br>
spacers. The flexible hydrophilic spacer is optimal for avoiding non-specific binding of<br>
neoglycolipid or polyvalent conjuGates. This is essential optimal activity in bioassays and<br>
for bioactivity of Pharmaceuticals or functional foods, for example.<br>
A general formula for a conjuGate with a flexible hydrophilic linker has the following<br>
Formula 2:<br>
[OS -O- (X)n-L,-CH(H/{CH1.2OH}p,) - {CH.OH} p2- {CH(NH-R)}p3- {CH,OH} p4- L2]m-Z<br>
wherein L1 and L2 are linking groups comprising independently oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur<br>
or carbon linkage atom or two linking atoms of the group forming linkages such as -O-, -<br>
S-, -CH2-, -NH-, -N(C0CH3)-, amide groups -CO-NH- or-NH-CO- or-N=N- (hydrazine<br>
derivative) or hydroxylamine -O-NH- and-NH-O-. L1 is linkage from carbon 1 of the<br>
reducing end monosaccharide of X or when n =0, L1 replaces -O- and links directly from<br>
the reducing end Cl of OS.<br>
pi, p2, p3, and pa are independently integers from 0-7, with the proviso that at least one of<br>
pi, p2, p3, and pa is at least 1. CH1-2OH in the branching term {CH1-2OH}p1 means that the<br>
chain terminating group is CH2OH and when the pi is more than 1 there is secondary<br>
alcohol groups -CHOH- linking the terminating group to the rest of the spacer. R is<br>
preferably acetyl group (-COCH3) or R is an alternative linkage to Z and then L2 is one or<br>
two atom chain terminating group, in another embodiment R is an analog forming group<br>
comprising C1-4 acyl group (preferably hydrophilic such as hydroxy alkyl) comprising<br>
amido structure or H or C1-4 alkyl forming an amine. And m &gt; 1 and Z is polyvalent carrier.<br>
OS and X are defined in Formula 1.<br>
Preferred polyvalent structures comprising a flexible hydrophilic spacer according to<br>
formula 2 include Escherichia coli binding oligosaccharide sequence (OS) ß1-3 linked to<br>
GalpaGlc(red)-Z, and 0Sß6GlcNAc(red)-Z and 0Sp6GalNAc(red)-Z., where "(red)"<br>
means the amine linkage structure formed by reductive animation from the reducing end<br>
monosaccharides and an amine group of the polyvalent carrier Z.<br>
In the present invention the oligosaccharide group is preferably linked in a polyvalent or an<br>
oligovalent form to a carrier which is not a protein or peptide to avoid antigenicity and<br>
possible allergic reactions, preferably the backbone is a natural non-antigenic<br>
polysaccharide.<br>
Therefore the some of optimal polyvalent non-acidic substances to be used according to<br>
the invention comprises a terminal oligosaccharide sequence<br>

More preferably u=0 and<br>
most preferably the oligosaccharide sequence presented in polyvalent form is<br>
GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAc<br>
or an analog or derivative thereof.<br>
Soluble polyvalent conjuGates comprising hydroxylamine linkage<br>
Effective production of soluble polyvalent oligosaccharide conjuGates, which are<br>
biologically acceptable has been a problematic. The problem was solved by using a<br>
chemoselective O-hydroxylamine structure to be reacted with the reducing end aldehyde of<br>
the oligosaccharide to be coupled. The oxygen of the carrier is linked to the backbone or<br>
spacer and the nitrogen is linked to the C-of the reducing end of the oligosaccharide. The<br>
reaction can be produced under conditions where the polysaccharide backbone is soluble<br>
such as in aqueous buffer.<br>
The present invention is specifically directed to oligosaccharides conjuGated to polyvalent<br>
oligosaccharide or polysaccharide structures by O-hydroxylamine structue.<br>

and animal glyconjuGates is also observable with H. fenelliae, H. rappini and H .pullorum.<br>
In general the ecologic niches in enterohepatic system allows an effective use of limited<br>
amount of receptor carbohydrates. The present invention identifies the major receptor<br>
carbohydrates useful for binding enterohepatic system of human and animals. In a specific<br>

configuration, and all the monosaccharide units in the pyranose form. Glucosamine is<br>
referred as GlcN or GlcNH2 and galactosamine as GalN or GalNH2. Glycosidic linkages<br>
are shown partly in shorter and partly in longer nomenclature, the linkages of the Neu5 Ac-<br>

polysaccharide chains present in human or animal glycoconjuGates, especially on<br>
glycolipids or glycoproteins. In the shorthand nomenclature for fatty acids and bases, the<br>
number before the colon refers to the carbon chain lenght and the number after the colon<br>
gives the total number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Abbreviation GSL refers<br>
to glycosphingolipid. Abbreviations or short names or symbols of glycosphingolipids are<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
Experimental procedures<br>
Culture Conditions and Labeling — The E. coli strains were cultured on Luria-agar with<br>
the addition of 10 µl 35S-methionine (400 µCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, U.K.) at 37<br>
°C for 12 h. The bacteria were harvested by scraping, washed three times with phosphate-<br>
buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, and thereafter resuspended in PBS (with or without 1%<br>
mannose (w/v)) to lxlO8 CFU/ml. The specific activities of the suspensions were<br>
approximately 1 cpm per 100 bacteria.<br>
Reference Glycosphingolipids — Total acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were<br>
obtained by standard procedures (1). The individual glycosphingolipids were isolated by<br>
repeated chromatography on silicic acid columns of the native glycosphingolipid fractions,<br>
or acetylated derivatives thereof. The identity of the purified glycosphingolipids was<br>
confirmed by mass spectrometry (2), proton NMR spectroscopy (3), and degradation<br>
studies (4, S).<br>
Preparation of neoglycolipids. Oligosaccharides with terminal GlcNAc were synthethic<br>
oligosaccharides GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAc, GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcß3GalpaGlc and<br>
GlcNAcß3GalpaGlcNAcp6GlcNAc from Carbion Oy, Finland, and mannose<br>
oligosaccharide was from Dextralabs, UK were reductively aminated with 4-<br>
hexadecylaniline (abbreviation HDA, from Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden) by<br>
cyanoborohydride (Halina Miller-Podraza, to be published later). The products were<br>
characterized by mass spectrometry and were confirmed to be reductively aminated<br>
conjuGated of the oligosacharides and HDA.<br>
Thin-Layer Chromatography — Thin-layer chromatography of glycosphingolipids was<br>
performed on glass- or aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt,<br>
Germany), using chloroform/methanol/water 60:35:8 (by volume) as solvent system.<br>
Chemical detection was done with anisaldehyde (6).<br>
Glycosphingolipid Binding Assays — Binding of 35S-labeled bacteria to<br>
glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatograms was done as reported (7). Dried<br>
chromatograms were dipped for 1 min in diethylether/n-hexane (1:5, by volume)<br>
containing 0.5% (w/v) polyisobutyhnethacrylate (Aldrich Chem. Comp. Inc., Milwaukee,<br>
WI). After drying, the chromatograms were soaked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum<br>
albumin (w/v), 0.1% NaN3 (w/v) and 0.1% Tween 20 (by volume) for 2 h at room<br>
temperature. The chromatograms were subsequentely covered with radiolabeled bacteria<br>
diluted in PBS (2-5 x 106 cpm/ml). Incubation was done for 2 h at room temperature,<br>
followed by repeated washings with PBS. The chromatograms were thereafter<br>
autoradiographed using XAR-5 X-ray films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 12 h.<br>
Autoradiograms were replicated using a CCD camera (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, In)<br>
, and analysis of the images was performed using the public domain NIH Image program<br>
(developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and available at<br>
http^/rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).<br>
Inhibition with Soluble Oligosaccharides — As a test for possible inhibition of binding by<br>
soluble suGars 35S-labeled E. coli strains were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with<br>
approximately 1.5 mM of globotriaose, globotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-<br>
neotetraose, 3"-sialyllactose and 6"-sialyllactose in PBS. The final concentrations of the<br>
inhibiting oligosaccharides on the TLC-plate were 0.3 mM. Lactose was tested at final<br>
concentrations from 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. Thereafter the chromatogram binding assay was<br>
performed as described above.<br>
Analysis of gfycosylationfrom human gastrointestinal system — Human mucosa samples<br>
were obtained from surgical operations. They represented epithelial tissues of the larynx<br>
and the gastrointestinal tract, namely stomach and colon.<br>
Reducing oligosaccharides were isolated by non-reductive P-elimination. After<br>
purification, they represented all kinds of cellular glycans mainly from proteins.<br>
MALDI-TOF MS was performed with a Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry Workstation,<br>
essentially as in (Saarinen et al., 1999; papac et al., 1996; Harvey, 1993). Neutral<br>
oligosaccharides were analysed with 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid matrix in positive ion<br>
reflector mode, and acidic oligosaccharides were analysed with 2",4",6"-<br>
trihydroxyacetophenone matrix in negative ion linear mode.<br>
All exoglycosidase reactions were performed essentially as described previously (Nyman<br>
et al., 1996; Saarinen et al., 1999) and analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. The enzymes and<br>
their specific control reactions with characterised oligosaccharides were: p-N-<br>

Results<br>
Screening for Carbohydrate Binding Activity ofDiarrheagenic E. coli<br>
Using Mixtures of Glycosphingolipids — During the initial studies the potential<br>
carbohydrate recognition of a number of diarrheagenic E. coli strains (summarized in Table<br>
1) was evaluated using well characterized mixtures of glycosphingolipids in the<br>
chromatogram binding assay, in order to expose the bacteria to a large number of variant<br>
carbohydrate sequences. Thereby, a selective binding to some glycosphingolipids was<br>
detected, while other compounds were not recognized by the bacteria. The binding patterns<br>
obtained varied between the strains as exemplified in Fig. 1.<br>
Binding of CCuG Type Strains to Pure Glycosphingolipids — To further define the<br>
binding characteristics, two type strains (CCuG 38068 and 38077) were selected for<br>
binding assays using pure glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatograms, as exemplified<br>
in Fig. 2. The results are summarized in Table 2. Thus, both strains bound to<br>
lactosylceramide. The binding to lactosylceramide was only obtained when this<br>
glycosphingolipid had a ceramide with sphingosine or phytosphingosine and hydroxy fatty<br>
acids (No.5 in Table 2), whereas lactosylceramide with sphingosine and non-hydroxy fatty<br>
acids (No. 4) was consistently non-binding.<br>
Further glycosphingolipids recognized by both bacteria were galabiaosylceramide (No. 6),<br>
isoglobotriaosylceramide (No. 7), globotriaosylceramide (No. 8), gangliotriaosylceramide<br>
(No. 10), gangliotetraosylceramide (No. 11), globotetraosylceramide (No. 12), Forssman<br>
glycosphingolipid (No. 14), neolactotetraosylceramide (No.IS), lactotetraosylceramide<br>
(No. 23), neolactohexaosylceramide (No. 22) and NeuGca3-neolactohexaosylceramide<br>
(No. 36). The binding to these glycosphingolipids was not dependent on ceramide<br>
structure.<br>
The strain CCuG 38077, but not strain CCuG 38068, also bound to a number of<br>
gangliosides (Nos. 28,29,31-36; exemplified in Fig. 2). Binding-active gangliosides had<br>
both JV-acetyl- and JV-glycolyl neuraminic acid, and the neuraminic acid could be both a.3-<br>
linked and a6-linked. However, all gangliosides were not recognized, e.g. no binding to the<br>
GDla ganglioside (No. 30) was obtained.<br>
The strain CCuG 38068 on the other hand bound to the Lea-5 glycosphingolipid (No. 24),<br>
which was not recognized by strain CCuG 38077.<br>
The two strains of E. coli were also shown to bind to Mana3(Mana6)Man on thin-layer<br>
chromatograms. The saccharide was tested after coupling with a lipid tail throuGh reductive<br>
amination. Further experiments with double branched mannose-containing neoglycolipids<br>
indicated that the binding was dependent on the presentation of the saccharide.<br>
Neoglycolipids with terminal GlcNAcß3LacNAc were also recognized by the two CCuG<br>
strains.<br>
Example of neoglycolipid binding experiment<br>
The isomeric pentasaccharides were produced by specific ß3-galactosidase (Calbiochem,<br>
La Jolla, CA) and ß4-galactosidase (from D.pneumonia, Sigma, ST Louis, MO) digestions<br>
digestion from commercial hexasaccharides ß4ra-lacto-N-hexaose (from Dextra<br>
laboratories, Reding, UK) and from Lacto-N-hexaose (Isosep, Tullinge, Sweden) to obtain<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc and Galß3GlcNAcß3(GlcNAcp6)Galß4Glc.<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcp6Galß4Glc was produced from GlcNAcp6Galß4Glc (Sigma St<br>
Louis, MO) by first ß4-galactosyltransferase (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) reaction using<br>
UDP-Gal (Kyowa Hakko, Jaß4n) as donor and then by ß3-GlcNAc-transferase (human<br>
serum) and UDP-GlcNAc (Kyowa Hakko, Jaß4n). The oligosaccharides were purified<br>
using gel filtration chromatography and characterized by NMR-spectroscopy and mass<br>
spectrometry. The pentasaccharides and Man<x3 were reductively aminated></x3>
with 4-hexadecylaniline (abbreviation HDA, from Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden) by<br>
cyanoborohydride (Halina Miller-Podraza, to be published later). The products were<br>
characterized by mass spectrometry were confirmed to be the corresponding<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc(red)-HDA,Galß3GlcNAcß3(GlcNAcP6)Galß4Glc<br>
(red)-HDA, GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcp6Galß4Glc(red)-HDA, and<br>
Mana3(Mana6)Man(red)-HDA [where "(red)-" means the amine linkage structure<br>
formed by reductive amination from the reducing end glucoses of the saccharides and<br>
amine group of the hexadecylaniline (HDA)]. The compound<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc(red)-HDA and Mana3(Mana6)Man(red)-HDA had<br>
binding activity with regard to two strains of diarrheagenic E.coli (CCuG 38068 and<br>
38077) in TLC overlay assay described above while the pentasaccharides<br>
Galß3GlcNAcß3(GlcNAcp6)Galß4Glc(red)-HDA,<br>
GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcP6Galß4Glc(red)-HDA had much weaker or non-existent binding<br>
activities. The results indicated that GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4Glc-type<br>
neolactostructures bind effectively to diarrheagenic E. coli. The binding is reduced much if<br>
the GlcNAcß3 is changed to GlcNAcp6- in the structure. The results also demonstrated<br>
similarity that blocking the middle galactose in lacto tetraose structure by a GlcNAc branch<br>
Galß3GlcNAcß3(GlcNAcp6)Galß4Glc diminished the binding on a TLC-overlay assay.<br>
Binding specificities in different types of diarrheagenic E. coli<br>
Screening for binding specificities in different types of diarrheagenic E. coli, i.e.<br>
enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enteroaggregative (EAGG),<br>
enteroinvasive (EIEC) and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) showed that the majority of the<br>
described binding specificities were found in most strains (data about typical/type strains<br>
are summarized in Table 4. Thus binding to lactosylceramide, lacto- and neolacto was<br>
obtained with all strains tested, and globobinding was obtained by all strains with the<br>
exception of wild type EHEC strains. In this collection mainly the type strains, sialic acid<br>
binding was obtained with one enteroaggregative strain. However, several wild type<br>
diarrheagenic E. coli strains bind to sialic acid (see e.g. Fig 6 and Fig 3). The absence of<br>
binding of EHEC to globoseries glycosphingolipids and to gangliosides is illustrated in<br>
Fig. 7(lane 1, and lanes 3,5,6,8, and 9 respectively. The binding obtained in lane 7 is<br>
related to lactosylceramide binding.<br>
Preferential recognition ofNeuGc-neolactotetraosylceramide<br>
To dissect the sialic acid binding preferences of diarrheagenic E. coli, the binding of<br>
bacteria to variants of sialyl-neoleactotetraosylceramide was comß4red. The bacteria bound<br>
with highest affinity to NeuGca3-neolactotetraosylceramide<br>
(NeuGca3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcpCer), followed by NeuAca6-<br>
neolactotetraosylceramide(NeuAca6Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcpCer),<br>
and finally NeuAca3-neolactotetraosylceramide<br>
(NeuAca3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcNAcß3Galß4GlcpCer). The comß4rison was<br>
performed by using dilution series of glycolipids and comß4ring the disappearance of the<br>
bindings when the amounts of glycolipids were reduced. Taken together the results indicate<br>
that even higher binding can be obtained with a6-Hnked NeuGc.<br>
Based on binding ß4tterns and carbohydrate structures the binding-activities were<br>
classified into eight seß4rate binding specificities:<br>
a) Lactosylceramide-binding: represented by lactosylceramide (No. 5) and<br>
isoglobotriaosylceramide (No. 7).<br>
b) Ganglio-binding: represented by gangliotriaosylceramide (No. 10) and<br>
gangliotetraosylceramide (No. 11).<br>
c) Gala4Gal-binding: represented by galabiaosylceramide (No. 6),<br>
globotriaosylceramide (No. 8), globotetraosylceraraide (No. 12) and the Forssman<br>
glycosphingolipid (No. 14).<br>
d) Lacto-binding; represented by lactotetraosylceramide (No. 23).<br>
e) Neolacto-binding: represented by neolactotetraosylceramide (No. 15),<br>
neolactohexaosylceramide (No. 22) andNeuGca3-neolactohexaosylceramide (No.<br>
36).<br>
f) Binding to fucosylated glycosphingolipids: represented by the Lea-5<br>
glycosphingolipid (No. 24).<br>
g) NeuAc/NeuGc-X: represented by the gangliosides Nos. 28,29,31-36.<br>
h) Mannose-X: represented by the Mana3(Mana6)Man-neoglycolipid.<br>
Each wild type strain (Table 1) exhibited two or more of the binding specificities listed<br>
above, and the combination of binding specificities varied among the strains. Most strains<br>
had even three or more binding specificities. Four and more binding specificities were<br>
observed often and most strains may probably have caß4city to express all or almost all of<br>
the specificities, thouGh the specificities may necessarily not be active all the time. The<br>
need of use two or more oligosaccharide sequences at the same time is emphasized by the<br>
fact that the expression of the bindings varies between the strains.<br>
Inhibition Experiments —<br>
Inhibition by a mixture of globotetraose and 3"sialylactose<br>
The ability of soluble oligosaccharides to interfere with the binding of diarrheagenic E. coli<br>
to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer plates was examined by incubating the bacteria with a<br>
mixture of globotetraose and 3"sialyllactose before binding on chromatograms. The results are<br>
shown in Fig. 3. Thus, by incubation of the bacteria with a mixture of oligosaccharides an<br>
inhibition of the binding to both globotetraosylceramide and 3"sialyl-paragloboside was<br>
obtained. Inhibition of binding to globotriaosylceramide was also obtained by preincubatiing<br>
the bacteria with l.S mM globotriaose, with final concentration of 0.3 mM.<br>
Inhibition by a mixture ofglobotriose, lacto-N-neotetraose and 6"sialylactose<br>
The ability of soluble oligosaccharides to interfere with the binding of diarrheagenic E. coli<br>
to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer plates was further examined by incubating the bacteria<br>
with a mixture of globotetraose and 3"sialyllactose before binding on chromatograms. The<br>
results are shown in Fig. 6. Thus, by incubation of the bacteria with a mixture of<br>
oligosaccharides a simultaneous inhibition of the binding to globotriasylceramide,<br>
NeuNGca3neolactohexaosylceramide (carrying a midchain neolactoepitope) and<br>
NeuGca3neolactotetraosylceramide was obtained. The data showed simultaneous inhibitions<br>
aGalnst two epitopes present on the same molecule. A further observation was that binding to<br>
NeuGca3neolactotetraosylceramide is inhibited by 6"sialyllactose, demonstrating that the a3-<br>
linked and a6-linked sialic acid is bound by the same bacterial adhesin.<br>
Other results from the inhibition studies. In control experiments the monovalent free<br>
oligosaccharides described above specifically inhibited the binding to the glycolipids<br>
comtaining the same receptor structure but not to other glycolipids. The globoserias<br>
oligosaccharides inhibited binding to globo-receptor, Lacto-N-neotetraose inhibited binding to<br>
neolacto glycolipid and the sialylalctoses inhibited binding to the sialyl-receptor glycolipids<br>
as described above at 0.3 mM final concentration, but no cross-reactivity was observed.<br>
Lacto-N-tetraose was also able to inhibit the binding of diarrheagenic E. coli to<br>
lactotetraosylceramide when lowest densities of glycolipids were used in inhibition<br>
experiments as described above. As a control lactose was tested with final concentrations to 1-<br>
2 mg/ml (3-6 mM) with no inhibiting activity. Interestingly the disaccharide terminal<br>
ganglioside epitope Galß3GalNAc was also not active as monovalent inhibitor at 0.3 mM<br>
concentration aGalnst the Ganlio-receptor glycolipid, indicating the the disaccharide sequence<br>
may be more useful when conjuGated to a polyvalent carrier than a monovalent inhibitor.<br>
The inhibition experiments show that the frequent binding specificities according to the<br>
invention are<br>
1. separate<br>
2. inhibitable by relatively low concentrations of monovalent oligosaccharides and<br>
3. inhibitable simultaneously with no harmful effects due to presence of several<br>
oligosaccharides,<br>
Selective switch-off of binding specificities<br>
During these studies we have observed that upon prolonged sub-culture of diarrheagenic E.<br>
coli one or several of the binding specificities may be selectively lost. This is exemplified in<br>
Fig. 8 demonstrating a loss of binding to isoglobotriaosylceramide (lane 4), while the binding<br>
to gangliotetrasoylceramide (lane S) and globotetraosylceramide (lane 6) remain suGgesting a<br>
down-regulation of the isoglobotetraosylceramide/lactosylceramide binding adhesin. The<br>
isoglobosylceramide contains activating a hydroxylfatty acid, giving it activity of the<br>
lactosylceramide family. However, no specific ß4ttern in this switch-off could be discerned,<br>
i.e. different binding specificities were lost at different times. The inventors noticed quite<br>
random loss of any of the binding specificities. As the any of the binding specificities may be<br>
lost the use of at least two binding monovalent or polyvalent inhibitors according to the<br>
inventio is preferred.<br>
The frequent binding specificities<br>
Numerous TCL-overalys were run with the large collection of different types of diarrhea<br>
causing E. coli strains. Four binding specificities were found out to be especially frequently<br>
occurring amont the bacteria: binding to Globo-receptor, Sialic acid-receptors, Neolacto-<br>
receptors, and Lacto-receptors. The Globo- receptor binding was especially stabile aGalnst the<br>
spontaneous "switch-off".<br>
Analysis of protein glycosylationfrom human gastrointestinal system — The occurrence<br>
of some terminal glycan epitopes in the samples is exemplified below. In all these<br>
analyses, the detection level is of the order of 5 % of the relative abundances of the most<br>
abundant components.<br>
Galßl-4GlcNAcß-R. Terminal type II N-acetyllactosaminyl groups, as evidenced by<br>
susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae ß14-galactosidase digestion, were detected in<br>
all the analysed tissues, namely larynx, stomach, and colon. For example, a peak at m/z<br>
1809.73 in the positive ion reflector mode mass spectrum of the colon sample,<br>
corresponding to the ion structure [HexsHexNAc4Fuc+Na]+, calc. m/z = 1809.64, was<br>
eliminated by (31,4-galactosidase treatment and transformed into m/z 1485.68,<br>
corresponding to the ion structure [Hex3HexNAc4Fuc+Na]+, calc. m/z = 1485.53.<br>
Galßl,3-R. Terminal ßl,3-galactosidase susceptible galactose residues were detected only<br>
in colon epithelium, but not in larynx or stomach epithelium. A clear increase in the<br>
intensity of a peak at m/z 933.37 in the positive ion reflector mode mass spectrum,<br>
corresponding to the ion structure [Hex3HexNAc2+Na]+, calc. m/z = 933.32, was generated<br>
in a ß14-galactosidase pretreated sample by the action of ß13-galactosidase. Also, the<br>
intensity of a peak at m/z 1996.84, corresponding to the ion structure<br>
[Hex4HexNAc5Fuc2+Na]", calc. m/z = 1996.72, was clearly increased in a ß14-<br>
galactosidase pretreated sample by the action of ß13-galactosidase. This indicates that<br>
there are ßl,3-galactosylated derivatives of these structures.<br>
Fucal,2-R. Possible terminal al,2-fucosyl residues were detected in the stomach<br>
epithelium sample, but not in larynx or colon epithelium. Upon al,2-fucosidase digestion<br>
of the stomach sample, in the positive ion reflector mode mass spectrum there was<br>
increases in the intensities of peaks at m/z 755.24, corresponding to the ion structure<br>
[HexHexNAc2Fuc+Na]+ (calc. m/z 755.27), and m/z 917.29, corresponding to the ion<br>
structure [Hex2HexNAc2Fuc+Na]+ (calc. m/z 917.32), suGgesting the presence of<br>
fucosylated derivatives of these structures.<br>
Fucal,3-R andFucal,4-R. Possible terminal Lewisa or Lewis" blood group determinants<br>
were detected in the larynx and colon epithelium, but not in the stomach sample. For<br>
example, a clear increase in the intensity of a peak at m/z 2012.81 in the positive ion<br>
reflector mode mass spectrum of the colon sample, corresponding to the ion structure<br>
[Hex5HexNAc5Fuc+Na]+, calc. m/z - 2012.72, was generated in a al,2-fucosidase<br>
pretreated sample by the action of ol,3/4-fucosidase, showing the presence of fucosylated<br>
derivatives of this structure.<br>
Mana-R. Terminal a-mannosyl residues were detected in all samples, as a-mannosidase<br>
digestion affected a varying series of peaks in the positive ion reflector mode mass spectra,<br>
namely at calculated m/z 771.26 [Hex2HexNAc2+Na]+, m/z 933.32 [Hex3HexNAc2+Na]+,<br>
m/z 1095.37 [Hex4HexNAc2+Na]+, m/z 1257.42 [Hex5HexNAc2+Na]+, m/z 1419.48<br>
[Hex,iHexNAc2+Na]+, m/z 1581.53 [Hex7HexNAc2+Na]+, m/z 1743.58<br>
[HexgHexNAc2+Na]+, and m/z 1905.63 [Hex9HexNAc2+Na]+. After a-mannosidase<br>
digestion, these signals were converted to a single peak at calculated m/z 609.21<br>
[HexiHexNAc2+Na]+, indicating that the digested structures were high-mannose N-<br>
glycans.<br>
NeuAca2,3-R. Terminal sialic acids with a2,3-linkages to Gal (Toivonen et al., 2002) were<br>
detected in the samples. For example, upon a2,3-sialidase digestion of stomach glycans, a<br>
decrease was observed in the relative intensity of a peak at m/z 2369.4, corresponding to<br>
the ion structure [NeuAc2Hex5HexNAc4Fuc-H]", calc. m/z = 2369.1.<br>
NeuAca2,6/8/9-R. Terminal sialic acids with linkages other than a2,3 to Gal, or sialic<br>
acids a2,3-linked to GalNAc (Toivonen et al., 2002), were detected in the samples. For<br>
example, Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase digestion of a2,3-sialidase treated stomach<br>
glycans completely digested peaks at m/z 1931.6 [NeuAc1Hex5HexNAc4-H]" (calc. m/z =<br>
1931.7), m/z 2077.9 [NeuAc,Hex5HexNAc4Fuc-H]" (calc. m/z = 2077.9), m/z 2223.3<br>
[NeuAc2Hex5HexNAc4-H]" (calc. m/z = 2223.0), m/z 2369.4 [NeuAc2Hex5HexNAc4Fuc-<br>
H]" (calc. m/z = 2369.1), m/z 2735.1 [NeuAc2Hex6HexNAc5Fuc-H]" (calc. m/z = 2734.5),<br>
and m/z 3026.5 [NeuAc3Hex6HexNAc5Fuc-H]- (calc. m/z = 3025.7). Due to their large<br>
size and typical monosaccharide composition, these glycans would most likely be N-<br>
glycans, but potentially also O-glycans. However, smaller glycans that were also affected<br>
by A. ureafaciens sialidase, namely at m/z 1038.7 [NeuAcHex2HexNAc2-H]* (calc. m/z =<br>
1038.9), and m/z 1185.4 [NeuAcHex2HexNAc2Fuc-H]" (calc. m/z = 1185.1), would most<br>
likely be O-glycans. It must be noted that in all structures in this ß4ragraph with a single<br>
sialic acid residue, the linkage must be a2,6 (or a2,3 to GalNAc).<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
Gastric species examined in the present study included, Helicobacter mustelae ferret<br>
isolates from the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) and the Culture Collection<br>
of the University of Gothenberg (CCuG), NCTC 12198/CCuG 25175 (equivalent strains<br>
from different sources tested), CCuG 23950 and CCuG 23951, Helicobacterfelis CCuG<br>
28539 from a cat, in addition, H. pylori strains CCuG 17874, CCuG 17875 and a clinical<br>
isolate 119/95 were used. Enteroheß4tic helicobacters of animal origin were purchased<br>
from the CCuG including, Helicobacter canis CCuG 33835, Helicobacter bilis CCuG<br>
38995, Helicobacter heß4ticus CCuG 33637, and Helicobacterfennelliae (CCuG 18820).<br>
Glvcolipid binding assays<br>
Binding of"Helicobacter spp. to glycosphingolipids, both acid and non-acid fractions.<br>
Glycosphingolipids were isolated by standard procedures (Karlsson, 1987). The identity of<br>
the purified glycosphingolipids was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Samuelsson et ah,<br>
1990), proton NMR spectroscopy (Koemer et ai, 1983) and degradation studies (Stellner<br>
et al., 1973; Yang and Hakomori, 1971).<br>
Mixtures of glycosphingolipids (40 uG/lane) or pure compounds (2 uG/lane) were<br>
subsequently seß4rated using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on glass- or aluminum-backed<br>
silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), with chlcroform/methanol/water<br>
(60:35:8, by volume) as solvent system. Chemical detection was accomplished by<br>
anisaldehyde (Waldi, 1962). Helicobacter spp. were subjected to 35S-labeling (Angstrom et<br>
al., 1998) and suspended in PBS (10 CFU/ml) with a specific activity of approximately 1<br>
cpm per 100 organisms. Binding of the labeled-bacteria to glycosphingolipids separated by<br>
TLC was achieved using a bacterial-overlay technique coupled with autoradiography<br>
detection using XAR-5 x-ray films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) as previously described<br>
(Hanssonefa/., 1985).<br>
The carbohydrate binding specificities ofzHelicobacter species<br>
It has been established previously that both H. pylori and H. mustelae bind<br>
gangliotetraosylceramide binding was demonstrated for H. felis, H. canis and//, hepaticus<br>
and H. bilis (Table 3). Furthermore, in common with H. pylori we found that both gastric<br>
and enteroheß4tic Helicobacter spp. tested were caß4ble of binding to<br>
lactotetraosylceramide, lactosylceramide with phytosphingosine and/or hydroxy fatty acids<br>
and isoglobotriaosylceramide. In contrast, binding to Leb glycosphingolipid was only<br>
observed for H. pylori CCuG 17875 (Table 3).<br>
The binding of certain H. pylori strains to slow-migrating gangliosides in the acid<br>
glycosphingolipid fraction of human granulocytes is sialic acid-dependent (Miller-Podraza<br>
et al., 1999), and this fraction was therefore used as an indicator of sialic acid-recognition.<br>
Binding to this fraction was noted for H. heß4ticus CCuG 33637 (exemplified in Fig. 4B.<br>
lane 1) and H. pylon CCuG 17874 and occasionally for H. mustelae CCuG 25715 (Table<br>
3). Sialic acid binding caß4city assayed by other substances is also present at least in<br>
species of H, bilis.<br>
The ability of predominantly gastric and enteroheß4tic species of Helicobacter to<br>
glycosphingolipids is indicative of the use of host-carbohydrate binding by these species in<br>
their adhesion strategies.<br>
The binding specificities of different helicobacteria may be indicative of the ability to<br>
colonize a specific niche with different receptors being expressed in the intestine and<br>
heß4tobillary tree. In addition, different strategies may be useful at different times during<br>
infection due to changes in antigen expression by inflamed tissue (Mahdavi et al. 2002).<br>
From the present study it is apß4rent that strains of heß4tobillary helicobacters namely H.<br>
heß4ticus and H. bilis share common adhesion strategies with H. pylori. These types of<br>
heß4tobiliary ß4thogens have ability to bind various glycoconjuGates and even some<br>
sialylated structures.<br>
EXAMPLE III<br>
Production of soluble polyvalent conjuGates of the oligosaccharide sequences according to<br>
the invention<br>
Amidation of chitosan oligosaccharides<br>
For the preß4ration of aminooxy functionalized chitosan, the 19-mer chitosan preß4red as<br>
above was amidated with BOC-aminooxyacetic acid. A sample the chitosan was dissolved<br>
in 75% aqueous pyridine, and 5-fold molar excess (per chitosan amino groups) of BOC-<br>
aminooxyacetic acid, HBTU and diisopropylethylamine were added. The reaction was<br>
allowed to proceed for 42 h at room temperature in the dark, and then dried by rotary<br>
evaporation. Small molecular weight reagents were removed by dialysis, and the chitosan<br>
was subjected to proton NMR analysis. The analysis shows that on average 4.5 BOC-<br>
aminooxyacetyl groups were present on the chitosan chain.<br>
ConjuGation of biorecopiition carbohydrates with the aminooxv-chitomer<br>
Removal of the protecting groups by incubation with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The Boc-<br>
O-hydroxylamine modified chitomers were solubilized in TFA and incubated at room<br>
temperature for about 10 minutes. The TFA was removed by evaporation in vacuum.<br>
Various aldehyde containing molecules were reacted with the O-hydroxylamine terminals<br>
in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, for 42 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were<br>
purified by dialysing aGalnst water of by gel filtration chromatography.<br>
The reaction product between O-hydroxylamine chitomer and lactose was characterized by<br>
NMR-spectroscopy. The NMR spectrum showed presence of both p-anomeric glycosidic<br>
structure, Glc HI signal at 4.136 ppm, and an oxime form with double bond with Glc H1<br>
and H2 signals at 7.690 ppm and 4.626 ppm, respectively (Fig 3, A and B, respectively).<br>
The signals at 4.560 ppm and 4.512 ppm were assigned to H1, and signal at 3.054 ppm to<br>
H2 protons of backbone GlcN. The signal at 4.479 ppm corresponds to H1 signal of Gal<br>
of lactose residue. The signal at 4.163 ppm and signal at 4.449 ppm correspond to CH2-<br>
protons of the ring closed glycosidic form and the double bonded form, respectively, in the<br>
sß4cer formed from aminooxyacetic acid. Almost identical data is obtained when Lacto-<br>
N-neotetraose is coupled to the polymeric carrier, additionally signals for the terminal N-<br>
acetyllactosamine could be analysed.<br>
