COMPLETE SPECIFICATION <br>
       (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
AN IMPROVED DISC PADLOCK<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18, PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 400 079 MAHARASHTRA, India INDIAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to an improved Disc Padlock .More particularly this invention relates to an improved Disc Padlock with greater privacy and inaccessible for cutting or prying open.<br>
The conventional Disc Padlock are of inferior quality which can be opened easily by forcing. The camp is used as the stopper whereby during force opening the cylinder housing will be deformed thereby making the lock unserviceable. The type of material as well as the security system adapted are inadequate to prevent unlocking . Therefore there is a need to develop a security system or the locking mechanism to over come the drawback.<br>
The principal object of the invention is to provide an Improved Disc Padlock with added security.<br>
Another object of these invention is to provide an improved Disc Padlock where the lock shackle is almost enclosed in the lock body there by making it inaccessible for cutting by heck saw or prying open by jimmying or similar device.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide an improved Disc Padlock provided with added stopper independent of the cam projection thereby avoiding injury to cylinder housing.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide an Improved Disc Padlock  which requires almost negligible maintenance.<br>
Still further object of these invention is to provide an Improved Disc Padlock which is weather proof and dust proof.<br><br>
Accordingly there is provided an Improved Disc Padlock comprising a double slotted almost circular shackle (5) rota table by a driving camp (11) mounted on the cylinder (6a) operable by means of key at 1/4 of its rotation whereby the safety catch (8) pivoted on a support pin (10) riveted between bottom (12) and top plate (4) get engaged in the another slots provided in the shackle with torsion spring pin (7) during its locking position; the said shackle is provided a concentric top plate for support or for guiding which are riveted with bottom plates by riveting of shackle stopper pin (9) ; the whole assembly is accommodated in a grooved circular lower case (13) and a matching upper case 3 with opening for accommodating pad locking hasp; the said cylinder is provided with cylinder housing (6b) which is covered by a biasing cap; riveted (1) on the front face of the upper case (3);<br>
This invention relates to locking mechanism with added security in particular in this lock shackle is almost enclosed in the lock body, which makes it inaccessible for cutting by hacksaw or prying open by jimmying or similar devices. This lock is most suitable for putting on pad locking hasp provided on entrance doors and shutters.<br>
CONSTRUCTION<br>
The lock body shackle and other components are made of Stainless steel. Cylinder and cylinder housing are made of brass for better functioning and durability. The shackle is having a special circular shape, which matches with the circular shape of the lock body.<br>
ASSEMBLY<br>
Three shackle stopper pins and one support pin are riveted on bottom plate.  This bottom  plate  subassembly  is then  fixed  on the  lower case  by<br><br>
spot welding. The safety catch is inserted in the support pin and is held by the torsion spring. Top plate is fixed on the pins   by riveting.<br>
Shackle is then placed onto the lock along with Driving cam and lock cylinder subassembly.<br>
Spring activated cap for protection of key inserting slot, is fixed on upper case by rivet.<br>
Upper case is fixed onto the lock body by seam welding by an automated TIG welding process.<br>
Finally the weld joint is cleaned up to make the joint smooth and the complete lock is polished and buffed.<br>
FUNCTION<br>
The key is rotated clockwise to impart a rotational movement to the circular shaped shackle for lock opening. The key is rotated in counter clockwise direction to close the shackle for locking . The key can be pulled out from the lock cylinder only in locked condition of the disc padlock.<br>
There is a special spring- loaded cap to close the key inserting slot automatically for protecting it from the dirt and dust.<br>
This locking device can be used with the "Ultra Locking System " of Godrej    which is being patented or any other   equivalent locking systems.<br>
The invention will now be clear from the following description from the following figure 1 to 11 in the accompanying specification.<br><br>

Referring   to   figure   1   to   11 an   Improved   Disc   Padlocks   of     circular concentration  having    a  almost circular    sturdy  stainless  steel  shackle  (5)<br><br><br>
having a cut out so that in case of unlocking position the cut out position of the said shackle is rotatable by means of a driving camp (11) mounted on a cylinder which is housed between a bottom plate and top plate which are held together by means of shackle stopper pin (9). There is a safety catch (8) which is mounted on the bottom and top plate and pivoted on a support pin (10) which is provided with a torsion spring; the shackle is provided with a notch in the inner circumference for engaging with safety catch (8) and another slot for at the bottom for engaging with driving camp (11) the cylinder (6a) is provided with housing (6b) which is covered by a cap (2) with a spring and riveted (1) on the face surface of the upper case (3) to cover the key slot of the cylinder thereby prevent water ingress during rainy season &amp;   dirt.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible which may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	An Improved Disc Padlock comprising a double slotted almost circular shackle (5) rotateable by a driving camp (11) mounted on the cylinder (6a) operable by means of key at 1/4 of its rotation whereby the safety catch (8) pivoted on a support pin (10) riveted between bottom (12) and top plate (4) and get engaged in the other slot provided in the shackle with torsion pin (7) during its locking position; the said shackle is provided a concentric top plate for support or for guiding which are riveted with bottom plate by riveting of shackle stopper pin (9) ; the whole assembly is accommodated in a groove circular lower case 13 and a matching upper case 3 with opening for accommodating pad locking hasp; the said cylinder is provided with cylinder housing (6b) which is covered by a biasing cap; as riveted (1) on the front face of the upper case (3);<br>
2.	An Improved Disc Padlock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the circular shackle is provided with a cut out so that during the unlocking position the shackle will not be viewed from outside.<br>
3.	An Improved Disc Padlock as claimed in claim 1 wherein during force opening, if at all any one try, the load will come to stopper instead of on the cylinder housing thereby preventing it from damage.<br><br>
4. An Improved Dick Padlock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the low and upper cover is provided with a little opening sufficient for clamping the hasp; inaccessible for cutting by hacksaw.<br>
5.   An Improved Disc Padlock as claimed in claim 1  and substantially described and illustrated in fig 1 to 11 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Dated this 14th day of September, 2000.<br>
