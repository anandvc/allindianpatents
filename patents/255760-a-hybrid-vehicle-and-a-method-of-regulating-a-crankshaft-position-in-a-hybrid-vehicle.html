CRANKSHAFT STOP POSITIONING CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
 This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/816,684, filed on June 27, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention relates to hybrid vehicles, and more<br>
particularly to crankshaft stop positioning control system for a hybrid vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Hybrid vehicles are driven by multiple powerplants including,<br>
but not limited to an internal combustion engine and an electric machine. The<br>
electric machine functions as a motor/generator. In a generator mode, the<br>
electric machine is driven by the engine to generate electrical energy used to<br>
power electrical loads or charge batteries. In a motor mode, the electric<br>
machine supplements the engine, providing drive torque to drive the vehicle<br>
drivetrain.<br>
 In hybrid electric vehicles, the engine is often stopped and<br>
started to improve fuel economy. Acceleration and deceleration of the engine<br>
crankshaft should be controlled during engine stop and starts to reduce<br>
driveline oscillations and other vibration inducing events that diminish the<br>
vehicle drivability. The crankshaft should also be parked in a desirable<br>
rotational position to further improve the stop-start characteristics of the<br>
engine.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of<br>
regulating a crankshaft position in a hybrid electric vehicle. The method<br>
includes deactivating cylinders of an internal combustion engine, driving a<br>
crankshaft of the internal combustion engine using an electric machine, and<br>
determining a target crankshaft position when a rotational speed of the<br>
crankshaft crosses a first threshold. The crankshaft is driven towards the<br>
target crankshaft position at a nudge rotational speed, and rotation of the<br>
crankshaft is braked using the electric machine when a brake crankshaft<br>
position is achieved at the target rotational speed. Rotation of the crankshaft<br>
is arrested at the target position.<br>
 In one feature, the step of driving the crankshaft includes<br>
driving the crankshaft at a lash rotational speed to minimize driveline lash in<br>
the hybrid electric vehicle.<br>
 In another feature, the method further includes determining a<br>
braking torque of the electric machine based on a difference between an<br>
actual crankshaft position and the target crankshaft position during the step of<br>
braking.<br>
 In another feature, the method further includes adjusting a<br>
torque of the electric machine to provide a slight motoring of the crankshaft<br>
when the actual crankshaft position is approximately equal to the target<br>
crankshaft position.<br>
 In another feature, the method further includes adjusting a<br>
torque of the electric machine to provide a slight motoring of the crankshaft<br>
when the rotational speed of the crankshaft is approximately equal to zero.<br>
 In still another feature, the method further includes ramping a<br>
torque of the electric machine to zero when the actual crankshaft position is<br>
equal to the target crankshaft position.<br><br>
 In yet other features, the method further includes determining<br>
respective rotational speeds of the crankshaft and the electric machine, and<br>
relaxing a throttle actuator of the internal combustion engine when the<br>
respective rotational speeds each equal zero. A timer is initiated when the<br>
respective rotational speeds both equal zero. The step of relaxing is executed<br>
upon the timer achieving a threshold time.<br>
 Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
 Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary hybrid<br>
vehicle that is operated based on the crankshaft stop positioning control of the<br>
present invention;<br>
 Figure 2 is a graph illustrating exemplary vehicle operating<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br><br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary hybrid vehicle 10<br>
includes an engine 12 and an electric machine 14, which drive a transmission<br>
16. Air is drawn into the engine 12 through a throttle 13, whose position is<br>
regulated by a throttle actuator 15. The air is mixed with fuel, and the air/fuel<br>
mixture is combusted within cylinders (not shown) to generate drive torque.<br>
The electric machine 14 supplements the engine 12 to produce drive torque to<br>
drive the transmission 16. In this manner, fuel efficiency is increased and<br>
emissions are reduced. The engine 12 and electric machine 14 are coupled<br>
via a belt-alternator-starter (BAS) system 18. More specifically, the electric<br>
machine 14 operates as a starter (i.e., motor) and an alternator (i.e.,<br>
generator) and is coupled to the engine 12 through a belt and pulley system.<br>
The engine 12 and the electric machine 14 include pulleys 20, 22,<br>
respectively, that are coupled for rotation by a belt 24. The pulley 20 is<br>
coupled for rotation with a crankshaft 26 of the engine 12.<br>
 In one mode, the engine 12 drives the electric machine 14 to<br>
generate power used to recharge an energy storage device (ESD) 28. In<br>
another mode, the electric machine 14 drives the engine 12 using energy from<br>
the ESD 28. The ESD 28 can include, but is not limited to, a battery or a<br>
super-capacitor. Alternatively, the BAS system 18 can be replaced with a<br>
flywheel-alternator-starter (FAS) system (not shown), which includes an<br>
electric machine operably disposed between the engine and the transmission<br>
or a chain or gear system that is implemented between the electric machine<br>
14 and the crankshaft 26.<br><br>
 The transmission 16 can include, but is not limited to, a<br>
manual transmission, an automatic transmission, a continuously variable<br>
transmission (CVT) and an automated manual transmission (AMT). Drive<br>
torque is transferred from the engine crankshaft 26 to the transmission 16<br>
through a coupling device 30. The coupling device 30 can include, but is not<br>
limited to, a friction clutch or a torque converter depending upon the type of<br>
transmission implemented. The transmission 16 multiplies the drive torque<br>
through one of a plurality of gear ratios to drive a driveshaft 32.<br>
 A control module 34 regulates operation of the vehicle 10.<br>
The control module 34 controls fuel injection and spark to selectively activate<br>
and deactivate cylinders of the engine 12. More specifically, when the vehicle<br>
10 is at rest, none of the cylinders of the engine 12 are firing (i.e., are<br>
deactivated) and the engine 12 is stopped. During vehicle launch (i.e.,<br>
acceleration from rest), the electric machine 14 drives the crankshaft to spin-<br>
up the engine 12 to an idle RPM and to initiate vehicle acceleration. During<br>
periods where low drive torque is needed to drive the vehicle, the engine<br>
cylinders do not fire and the valves can be deactivated. Drive torque is<br>
provided by the electric machine 14. When deactivated, fuel and spark are<br>
cut-off to the cylinders of the engine. Further, opening and closing cycles of<br>
the intake and exhaust valves can be prevented to inhibit air flow processing<br>
with the cylinders.<br>
 An accelerator pedal 36 is provided. A pedal position sensor<br>
36 is sensitive to a position of the accelerator pedal 36 and generates a pedal<br>
position signal based thereon. A brake pedal 40 is provided. A brake pedal<br>
position sensor 42 is sensitive to a position of the brake pedal 40 and<br>
generates a pedal position signal based thereon. The control module 34<br>
operates a brake system 43 based on the brake pedal position signal to adjust<br>
a pressure within the brake system, which in turn regulates a braking force of<br>
brakes (not shown).<br><br><br>
 An EM position sensor 44 is responsive to the rotational<br>
position of a rotor of the electric machine 14 and a rotational speed of the<br>
electric machine 14 (RPMEM) is determined based thereon. Similarly, an<br>
engine position sensor 45 is responsive to the rotational position of the<br>
crankshaft 26 and a rotational speed of the engine 12 (RPMENG) is determined<br>
based thereon. The control module 34 operates the vehicle 10 based on the<br>
pedal position signals generated by the pedal position sensors 38, 42 and the<br>
signals generated by the position sensors 44, 45, as described in further detail<br>
below.<br>
 The crankshaft stop positioning (CSP) control of the present<br>
invention includes a virtual encoder that calculates the crankshaft's angular<br>
position (GENG) even at low speeds including zero RPM. The CSP control also<br>
determines a desired or target stop position (θTRG) and executes a multi-<br>
plateau EM control routine that controls rotation of the crankshaft 26 at a<br>
plurality of levels and parks the crankshaft at ΘTRG using the virtual encoder as<br>
its input.<br>
 Positioning the engine at ΘTRG is based on use of position<br>
and speed information from the engine position sensor 45, which can be<br>
provided as a 58X toothed wheel crankshaft sensor and/or a 4X camshaft<br>
sensor, and the EM position sensor 44, which can be provided as a resolver<br>
of the electric machine 14. The engine position information is used to<br>
generate a signal that represents the position of cylinder #1 (i.e., the first<br>
cylinder in the firing order) on a 720 degree scale (i.e., two crankshaft<br>
revolutions of 360 degrees each for one complete engine cycle in which all<br>
cylinders go thru a complete cycle of intake, compression, ignition and<br>
exhaust). Top-dead-center (TDC) of cylinder #1 during the compression<br>
stroke represents zero degrees.<br>
 The engine position sensor 45 can not be used to determine<br>
the RPM and position below a low value of RPM (e.g., approximately 100<br>
RPM) or in the reverse direction. Rotation of the crankshaft in the reverse<br>
direction can be detected by the control module 34, but the rotation appears<br><br>
the same as the rotation in the forward direction. The EM position sensor 44<br>
can determine the EM position and RPMEM down to zero RPM. Because the<br>
electric machine 14 and the engine 12 are coupled by a belt of fixed ratio,<br>
RPMEM and the EM position can be used to determine RPMENG and engine<br>
position below the point where engine position sensor 45 no longer detects<br>
rotation, as well as allow rotation of the crankshaft in the reverse direction to<br>
appear to the control module 34 as rotation different than rotation in the<br>
forward direction.<br>
 The EM position sensor 44, unlike the engine position sensor<br>
45, has bi-directional rotation sensing capability (i.e., reverse, or rock-back<br>
rotation of the crankshaft is detectable). When the EM position sensor<br>
detects movement in the reverse direction and the engine position sensor 45<br>
signal is still able to detect movement, the delta of this movement is<br>
determined, but the detected movement deltas are subtracted rather than<br>
added to the current ΘENG value. Also, this reverse detection capability can be<br>
used to update the final stop position of the crankshaft 26 when the engine<br>
position sensor 45 stops generating a signal and engine movement is still<br>
present. A delta of EM position on a scale of 0 to 360 degrees, rather than a<br>
delta of running crank position sensor pulses, can be determined and based<br>
on the ratio of the belt, a delta of ΘENG can be determined and this amount can<br>
be added or subtracted from the 9ENG value depending on the detection of a<br>
forward or a reverse direction.<br>
 The CSP control of the present invention implements the<br>
engine position sensor 45 to determine ΘENG of cylinder #1 on the 720 degree<br>
scale until the engine position sensor 45 no longer generates a usable signal.<br>
If the EM position sensor 44 detects the reverse direction at RPMs where the<br>
engine position sensor 45 signal is still usable, this is taken into account when<br>
determining θENG from the engine position sensor 45, as described above.<br>
When the engine position sensor 45 no longer generates a usable signal<br>
(e.g., at very low engine speed), the EM position sensor signal can be used to<br>
continue to determine θENG. At low engine speeds (e.g., less than 100 RPM),<br><br>
where the engine position sensor 45 can not be used to determine engine<br>
speed, RPMEM is monitored as it approaches 0 RPM, instead of EPMENG.<br>
When 6ENG approaches OTRG, the EM is braked which stops movement of the<br>
engine 12 until RPMEM is 0 RPM, as described in further detail below.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2, the CSP control will be described<br>
in further detail. Once HEOff is commanded the CSP control determines<br>
ΘTRG. More specifically, when the engine is ready to be stopped, the CSP<br>
control executes the multi-plateau electric machine control. During the first<br>
plateau, the electric machine 14 is used to control the crankshaft speed to<br>
RPMML (e.g. 500 RPMENG). RPMML is the speed used to draw down manifold<br>
absolute pressure (MAP) and to take up driveline lash. Accordingly, the first<br>
plateau phase minimizes driveline lash to improve the following engine restart<br>
smoothness. The RPMENG drop to RPMML is also performed with fuel off and<br>
the throttle closed, thereby reducing MAP. Because the cylinder pressures<br>
are reduced during the first plateau phase, the compression disturbance and<br>
electric machine motoring torque during the ensuing engine stop is also<br>
reduced. The throttle remains closed until the engine 12 is stopped, thereby<br>
trapping the vacuum. In this manner, the amount of engine rock back during<br>
crankshaft parking is minimized. Control during the first plateau also allows<br>
for the same starting conditions of the engine and MGU for control from speed<br>
#1 to speed #2 to speed #3 which allows for consistency across HEOffs.<br>
ΘTRG is calculated between the first and second plateaus,<br>
speed #1 and speed #2, respectively. More specifically, the ΘTRG calculation<br>
is initiated when RPMENG drops below a threshold RPM (RPMINIT) (e.g., 750<br>
RPM). This is based on the current ΘENG and can be one of a plurality of<br>
locations (e.g., 4 locations for a 4 cylinder engine), to provide one stop<br>
position per quadrant. For example, for an exemplary 4 cylinder engine, if<br>
0TRG is determined to be 85 degrees before TDC (BTDC) of any cylinder in its<br>
compression stroke, and given that 0 degrees is TDC of cylinder #1<br>
compression, 180 degrees is TDC of cylinder #3 compression, 360 degrees is<br>
TDC of cylinder #4 compression, and 540 degrees is TDC of cylinder #2<br><br><br>
compression (i.e., firing order is 1-3-4-2), then the stop positions would be 635<br>
degrees, 95 degrees, 275 degrees, 455 degrees, respectively.<br>
 In this manner, the engine stopping is effectively delayed by<br>
one cylinder event (i.e., 180 degrees) or until the next quadrant after<br>
determining ΘTRG. For example, if ΘENG is near 300 degrees when RPMENG<br>
crosses RPMINIT, ΘTRG would be that for the next cylinder in compression, or<br>
455 degrees. Furthermore, the window of the initial cylinder to determine the<br>
next compression cylinder is limited to the first 160 degrees (e.g., a<br>
calibratable value) of the initial cylinder's compression stroke. For example, if<br>
the compression stroke of the initial cylinder in which RPMINIT is crossed<br>
ranges from 180 to 360 degrees, RPMINIT must have been crossed between<br>
180 and 340 degrees for a ΘTRG of 455 degrees to be selected.<br>
 The second plateau (speed #2) is a crankshaft nudge phase<br>
(NP), during which the crankshaft 26 is motored or nudged toward a desired<br>
position in the next quadrant using the electric machine 14. During the<br>
second plateau, the electric machine 14 controls the crankshaft speed to<br>
RPMNP, which is the nudge speed to move the crankshaft position into the<br>
next quadrant described above (i.e., to prevent the engine 12 from stopping<br>
too early). In between RPMML and RPMNp, the CSP control calculates ΘTRG,<br>
as described above, and the electric machine 14 controls the deceleration<br>
rate of the crankshaft 26 to reduce vibration. If the crankshaft 26 is allowed to<br>
dwell in its resonance band (e.g. approximately 300 RPM), vibration can be<br>
felt by the vehicle occupants. Likewise, if the crankshaft 26 is decelerated too<br>
abruptly, powertrain mount rocking can also lead to occupant disturbance.<br>
RPMNp is a calibratable value and is chosen to be sufficiently high such that it<br>
enables the electric machine 14 to operate robustly enough to motor the<br>
crankshaft to the next quadrant but low enough such that it is below RPMINIT<br>
and after θTRG has been selected. Control of the electric machine between the<br>
first and second plateaus allows for the events of calculating ΘTRG.<br><br><br>
 The crankshaft 26 is motored at RPMNP until a braking<br>
crankshaft position (ΘBRK) is achieved, where 9BRK is defined as the<br>
calibratable position delta (θA) before the desired stop position ΘTRG (i.e., ΘBRK<br>
= ΘTRG - Θ∆). The third plateau is the final stop speed of zero RPM. More<br>
specifically, once ΘBRK has been achieved, the electric machine 14 is switched<br>
to generator mode to retard the crankshaft speed and to control both RPMEM<br>
and RPMENG down to zero RPM. In the generator mode, the brake torque of<br>
the electric machine 14 (TEM) is used to brake rotation of the crankshaft. TEM<br>
is determined as a function of the crankshaft position away from ΘTRG (i.e., θ∆).<br>
When zero RPM is detected, the CSP control monitors a reverse rotation flag<br>
from the EM position sensor 44. When near zero RPM and at or near 9TRG,<br>
the electric machine braking can be calibrated to be a slight motoring before<br>
gently ramping out the electric machine torque completely. In this manner,<br>
rock back minimization is ensured. Reverse rotation is undesirable, because<br>
extra energy and time is required to reverse the backwards rotation if an<br>
engine restarts commanded.<br>
 The engine 12 is considered parked once there is no motion<br>
detected by both the engine position sensor 45 and the EM position sensor 44<br>
for a threshold stop time (tSTOp. Once the engine 12 is deemed parked, the<br>
throttle 13 is held closed until the MAP leaks back up to the barometric<br>
pressure (PBARO). It is desirable to maximize the time of low MAP, because<br>
the subsequent engine restart can be performed more smoothly and with less<br>
power. Once PBARO has been achieved, the throttle actuator 15 is relaxed<br>
back to its rest position, thereby conserving electrical energy.<br>
 The above described three plateau EM control for engine<br>
stopping is applicable when entering the routine from a deceleration fuel cut-<br>
off situation. If the engine 12 has been idling (i.e., fuel on), the CSP control is<br>
effectively a four plateau EM control, where the fueled engine speed and MAP<br>
are first stabilized before fuel is cut and RPMENG is dropped to RPMML.<br><br><br>
 Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
CSP control will be described in detail. In step 300, control determines<br>
whether to initiate HEOff. If HEOff is not to be initiated, control loops back. If<br>
HEOff is to be initiated, control uses the electric machine 14 to control<br>
RPM<br>
ENG to achieve RPMML in step 304. In step 306, control determines<br>
whether RPMENG is equal to RPMML. If RPMENG is not equal to RPMML, control<br>
loops back to step 304. If RPMENG is equal to RPMML, control continues in<br>
step 308.<br>
 In step 308, control uses the EM to control RPMENG towards<br>
RPMNP. Control determines whether RPMENG is less than RPMINIT in step<br>
310. If RPMENG is not less than RPMINIT, control loops back to step 308. If<br>
RPMENG is less than RPMINIT, control determines BTRG in step 312. In step<br>
314, control determines whether RPMENG is equal to RPMNp. If RPMENG is not<br>
equal to RPMNP, control loops back. If RPMENG is equal to RPMNP, control<br>
continues in step 316.<br>
 In step 316, control motors the crankshaft at RPMNp using<br>
the EM. Control determines whether BENG is equal to GBRK in step 318. If BENG<br>
is not equal to BBRK, control loops back to step 316. If BENG is equal to BBRK,<br>
control operates the electric machine 14 as a generator to brake the rotation<br>
of the crankshaft 26 in step 320. In step 322, control determines whether<br>
RPMENG and RPMEM are both equal to zero. If either RPMENG or RPMEM is not<br>
equal to zero, control loops back to step 320. If both RPMENG and RPMEM are<br>
equal to zero, control continues in step 324.<br><br>
 In step 324, control starts a timer t. Control determines<br>
whether t is equal to tSTOP in step 326. If t is not equal to tSTOP, control<br>
continues in step 328. If t is equal to tsTOP, control continues in step 330. In<br>
