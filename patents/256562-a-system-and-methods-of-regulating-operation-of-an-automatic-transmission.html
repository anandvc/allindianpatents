CLUTCH TO CLUTCH TIE-UP STEADY-STATE DIAGNOSTIC<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a transmission that is<br>
driven by a prime mover, and more particularly to a transmission clutch<br>
control to identify a clutch that is inducing a tie-up condition.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Traditionally, vehicles include a prime mover, such as an<br>
internal combustion engine, that generates drive torque. The drive torque is<br>
transferred through a powertrain to drive a drivetrain, propelling the vehicle<br>
along a surface. Exemplary powertrain components include a transmission<br>
and a coupling device, through which the drive torque from the engine is<br>
transferred to the transmission. The transmission multiplies the drive torque<br>
by a gear ratio and further transfers the multiplied drive torque to the driveline.<br>
[0004] An exemplary transmission includes an automatic<br>
transmission having a plurality of transmission elements that are hydraulically<br>
engaged to establish a desired gear ratio. Accordingly, each transmission<br>
element includes a corresponding hydraulic circuit having a variable bleed<br>
solenoid (VBS) to regulate the actuation pressure of a corresponding<br>
transmission element, as well as brake switches and pressure switches.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005] A transmission tie-up condition can occur when a<br>
transmission element engages at an inappropriate time. More specifically, in<br>
so called clutch to clutch type transmissions, a gear ratio shift is orchestrated<br>
by lowering the torque transfer capacity of an off-going (i.e., disengaging)<br>
clutch while increasing the torque transfer capacity of an on-coming (i.e.,<br>
engaging) clutch. In the event that a third or redundant clutch should be<br>
applied during steady-state conditions, the vehicle decelerates at a rate that is<br>
proportional to the torque transfer capacity that the offending clutch comes on<br>
with.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, traditional diagnostic routines are implemented<br>
in transmission systems to identify the offending clutch upon detection of a tie-<br>
up condition. More specifically, traditional diagnostic routines cycle through<br>
and diagnose the various control elements (e.g., VBS, pressure switches,<br>
brake switches) to identify the offending element and to correct the tie-up<br>
condition. These traditional diagnostic routines, however, can result in false<br>
detection of tie-up conditions and can induce vibrations or other phenomenon<br>
that can be sensed by the driver.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
regulating operation of an automatic transmission. The method includes<br>
identifying a tie-up condition of the automatic transmission, adjusting a<br>
pressure of a transmission element in response to the tie-up condition and<br>
determining whether a first gear ratio of the automatic transmission holds.<br>
The pressure is set to zero if the gear ratio does not hold and a faulty<br>
transmission element is identified as one associated with a second gear ratio<br>
that is lower than said first gear ratio.<br><br>
3<br>
[0008] In other features, the method further includes setting a<br>
pressure of the transmission element to a value just below a slip pressure of<br>
the transmission element if the first gear ratio holds and again determining<br>
whether the first gear ratio of the automatic transmission holds. The pressure<br>
is set to zero if the gear ratio does hold and a faulty transmission element is<br>
identified as one associated with a second gear ratio that is higher than the<br>
first gear ratio. The pressure is set to an engagement pressure if the gear<br>
ratio does not hold and a no fault condition of the automatic transmission is<br>
indicated.<br>
[0009] In still another feature, the adjusting of the pressure includes<br>
determining a slip pressure of the transmission element, determining an offset<br>
pressure and setting the pressure of the transmission element to the slip<br>
pressure plus the offset pressure.<br>
[0010] In yet another feature, the method further includes<br>
monitoring a transmission input shaft speed, monitoring a<br>
transmission output shaft speed and identifying the tie-up condition based on<br>
the transmission input shaft speed and the transmission output shaft speed.<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any<br>
way.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary powertrain 10 is<br>
illustrated and includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a<br>
coupling device 16. More specifically, air is drawn into an intake manifold 18<br>
of the engine 12 through a throttle 20. The air is mixed with fuel and the<br>
air/fuel mixture is combusted within cylinders 22 to reciprocally drive pistons<br>
(not shown) within the cylinders 22. The pistons rotatably drive a crankshaft<br>
(not shown) to provide drive torque. Exhaust generated by the combustion<br>
process is exhausted from the engine through an exhaust manifold 26.<br>
Although 4 cylinders are illustrated, it is appreciated that the present invention<br>
can be implemented in vehicles having any number of cylinders.<br><br>
5<br>
[0018] The drive torque drives is transferred through the coupling<br>
device 16 to drive the transmission 14. The transmission 14 multiplies the<br>
drive torque by a desired gear ratio to provide a modified drive torque. The<br>
modified drive torque is transferred to a vehicle driveline (not shown) by a<br>
transmission output shaft 28. The transmission 14 includes an automatic<br>
transmission that provides a plurality of pre-defined, fixed gear ratios, wherein<br>
shifting of the transmission 14 is automatically regulated based on a selected<br>
drive range (e.g., P, R, N, D, L), a vehicle speed (VVEH) and an engine load.<br>
[0019] A control module 30 regulates operation of the powertrain<br>
based on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, the control module<br>
30 regulates an effective throttle area (AEFF) via a throttle actuator 32. A<br>
throttle position sensor 34 generates a throttle position signal (TPS) based on<br>
the angular position of the throttle 20. The control module 30 determines a<br>
requested engine torque (TENG) and adjusts the throttle position and other<br>
engine operating parameters to achieve TENG- The other engine operating<br>
parameters include, but are not limited to, a fueling rate, spark timing, a<br>
camshaft phase and/or an intake/exhaust valve lift or timing.<br>
[0020] The control module 30 also regulates operation of the<br>
transmission 14 based on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, a<br>
crankshaft position sensor 36 generates a crankshaft position signal, which is<br>
used to determine an actual engine speed (RPMENG)- A transmission output<br>
shaft speed (TOSS) sensor 38 generates a TOSS signal, which is used to<br>
determine VVEH, and a transmission input shaft speed (TISS) sensor 39<br>
generates a TISS signal.<br>
[0021] For the purpose of the present description, an exemplary 6-<br>
speed automatic transmission will be briefly described. It is anticipated,<br>
however, that the transmission slip control of the present invention can be<br>
implemented with any type of transmission know in the art. The exemplary 6-<br>
speed automatic transmission includes four clutches C1 - C4 and a brake<br>
element B1, each of which is hydraulically actuated via a corresponding<br><br>
6<br>
hydraulic circuit. C1 - C4 and B1 are selectively implemented in pairs to<br>
establish 6 forward gear ratios and a reverse ratio, in accordance with Table<br>
1, below:<br><br>
	1St	2nd	3rd	4th	5th	6th	R<br>
C1	X	X	X	X		<br><br>
C2		X			<br>
	X	<br><br>
C3			X		X		X<br>
C4	<br>
			X	X	X	<br><br>
B1	X				<br><br>
	X<br>
Table 1<br>
Accordingly, two transmission elements (i.e., C1 - C4 and B1) are actuated to<br>
establish a desired gear ratio.<br>
[0022] During a gear shift, one of the two transmission elements<br>
remains actuated while the other transmission element gradually disengages<br>
(i.e., is off-going) and a third transmission element gradually engages (i.e., is<br>
on-coming). For example, in 1st gear, C1 and B1 are engaged. During an<br>
upshift to 2nd gear, C1 remains engaged and is considered the primary<br>
element. B1 gradually disengages while C2 gradually engages. Because C2<br>
is the on-coming element for 2nd gear, it is considered the secondary element<br>
for an up-shift to 2nd gear. Similarly, C1 remains engaged (i.e., is the primary<br>
element), C2 gradually disengages and C3 gradually engages during an<br>
upshift to 3rd gear. Accordingly, C3 is the secondary element for an up-shift to<br>
3rd gear.<br>
[0023] The transmission clutch control of the present invention<br>
determines whether a tie-up condition exists during steady-state condition. A<br>
steady-state condition exists when there are no driver induced transients<br>
including, but not limited to, vehicle acceleration/deceleration and a gear shift.<br>
The TISS and TOSS signals are monitored while the transmission is operating<br>
in steady-state. If the both the TISS and TOSS signals remain constant, there<br><br>
7<br>
is no tie-up condition. If the TISS signal remains constant and the TOSS<br>
signal decreases (i.e., the torque transfer to the driveline is decreasing), a tie-<br>
up condition is present.<br>
[0024] Upon identifying the tie-up condition, the transmission clutch<br>
control reduces the pressure of the secondary element (PSEC) to a learned<br>
clutch slipping pressure (PSLIP) plus an offset (POFFSET)- PSLIP is just<br>
insufficient to maintain the secondary element in the fully-engaged state,<br>
resulting in clutch slip. POFFSET, however, maintains PSEC sufficiently above<br>
PSLIP to prevent slipping of the secondary element. PSLIP can be determined<br>
from a look-up table based on the particular secondary element. The look-up<br>
table is preferably continuously updated throughout the lifetime of the<br>
transmission to account for component wear. POFFSET is provided as a pre-<br>
stored value.<br>
[0025] If the gear ratio does not hold upon decreasing PSEC (i.e., the<br>
TOSS continues to decelerate), the offending element is one that is<br>
associated with a lower gear ratio. PSEc is reduced to zero (i.e., 0 kPA), which<br>
effectively results in a gear ratio shift to a lower gear ratio. The transmission<br>
clutch control can identify the offending element. More specifically, when PSEc<br>
is rapidly dropped, the faulted gear ratio is sought. Upon stable input/output<br>
speed information the gear ratio can accurately assessed. From this gear<br>
ratio, it is known which offending clutch is involved with the primary clutch. If<br>
the gear ratio does hold upon decreasing PSEC, PSEC is set to a value just<br>
below PSLIP, enabling the secondary element to start slipping.<br>
[0026] If the gear ratio holds upon decreasing PSEC to just below<br>
PSLIP, (i.e., the TOSS stops decelerating), the offending element is one that is<br>
associated with a higher gear ratio. PSEC is reduced to zero (i.e., 0 kPA),<br>
which effectively results in a gear ratio shift to a higher gear ratio. The<br>
transmission clutch control can identify the offending element, as discussed<br>
above. If the gear ratio does not hold upon decreasing PSEC to just below<br><br>
8<br>
PSLIP, there is no fault and PSEC is set equal to the normal engagement<br>
pressure (PENGAGE).<br>
[0027] The transmission clutch control sets a diagnostic trouble<br>
code (DTC) corresponding to a particular transmission element or elements<br>
deemed to be defective. A technician can readily identify the defective<br>
component by reading the DTCs. In this manner, the transmission can be<br>
easily and effectively repaired, decreasing warranty and other associated<br>
costs.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps that are<br>
executed by the transmission clutch control of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail. In step 200, control monitors TISS and TOSS. In step<br>
202, control determines whether a tie-up condition exists. If a tie-up condition<br>
does not exist, control ends. If a tie-up condition does exist, control continues<br>
in step 204. In step 204, control sets PSEC equal to PSLIP and POFFSET-<br>
[0029] Control determines whether the gear ratio is holding in step<br>
206. If the gear ratio is not holding, control continues in step 208. If the gear<br>
ratio is holding, control continues in step 210. In steps 208 and 210, control<br>
sets PSEC equal to zero and identifies the offending clutch element and control<br>
ends. In step 210, control sets PSEC to a value just below PSLIP-<br>
[0030] Control determines whether the gear ratio is holding in step<br>
214. If the gear ratio is holding, control continues in step 216. If the gear ratio<br>
is not holding, control continues in step 218. In steps 216 and 220, control<br>
sets PSEC equal to zero and identifies the offending clutch element and control<br>
ends. In step 218, control sets PSEC equal to PENGAGE- Control indicates that<br>
there is no fault in step 222 and control ends.<br>
[0031] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary modules that execute<br>
the transmission slip control will be described in detail. The exemplary<br>
modules include a tie-up determining module 300, a hold determining module<br>
302, a PSEC setting module 304 and a fault identifying module 306. The tie-up<br>
determining module 300 determines whether a tie-up condition exists based<br><br>
9<br>
on RPMTISS and RPMTOSS- The hold determining module 302 determines<br>
whether the gear ratio holds during the various steps of the transmission<br>
clutch control based on RPMTISS and RPMTOSS and a tie-up condition signal<br>
from the tie-up determining module. The PSEC setting module selectively sets<br>
PSEC in accordance with the transmission clutch control based on the tie-up<br>
condition signal and a hold signal. The fault identifying module 306 identifies<br>
a fault condition or a no fault condition in accordance with the transmission<br>
clutch control based on the hold signal.<br>
[0032] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>

invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
