HYDROGENATION OF ESTERS WITH RU/TETRADENTATE LIGANDS<br>
COMPLEXES<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of catalytic hydrogenation and, more<br>
particularly, to the use of Ru complexes with tetradentate ligands, in hydrogenation<br>
processes for the reduction of esters or lactones into the corresponding alcohol or diol<br>
respectively.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Reduction of an ester functional group to the corresponding alcohol is one of the<br>
fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, and is used in a large number of chemical<br>
processes. In general, two main types of processes are known to achieve such a<br>
transformation. Such types of processes are the following:<br>
a)	hydride processes, in which a silyl or metal hydride salt, such as LiAIH4, is used;<br>
b)	hydrogenation processes, in which molecular hydrogen is used.<br>
From a practical point of view, hydrogenation processes are more attractive as<br>
they can be run using small amounts of catalyst (typically 10 to 1000 ppm relative to the<br>
substrate) and in the presence of small quantities or even in the absence of solvent.<br>
Furthermore, hydrogenation processes do not require the use of highly reactive and<br>
expensive hydrides, and do not produce important amounts of aqueous waste.<br>
One of the mandatory and characterizing elements of hydrogenation processes is<br>
the catalyst or the catalytic system which is used to activate the molecular hydrogen in<br>
view of the reduction. The development of useful catalysts or catalytic systems for the<br>
hydrogenation of an ester functional group represents still an important need in chemistry.<br>
Amongst the few catalysts or catalytic systems known to perform such reductions<br>
one may cite the ruthenium/phosphine complexes, obtained by the reaction of ruthenium<br>
oxide or carboxylate precursor with a mono-, di- or tri-phosphine ligand (an example of<br>
which is described by Elsevier et al. in Chem.Commun., 1998, 1367). In this type of<br>
complex the ruthenium metal is coordinated only by "acac" ligands and phosphine atoms,<br>
limiting thus the diversity of the ligand structure and coordination sphere around the<br>
metal center. As a consequence of such little diversity the tuning of the activity and of the<br>
performance of the hydrogenation process is not easy. Furthermore, the experimental<br><br>
WO 2006/106484	PCT/IB2006/051028<br>
2<br>
conditions require very high pressures (at least 70-130 bars) and temperatures<br>
(120-180Â° C).<br>
Therefore, there is a need for hydrogenation processes using alternative catalysts<br>
or pre-catalysts, preferably having a greater diversity in the ligand structures and<br>
coordination spheres around the metal center and allowing the use of softer experimental<br>
conditions.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the problems aforementioned, the present invention relates<br>
to processes for the reduction by hydrogenation, using molecular H2, of a C3-C70 substrate<br>
containing one or two esters, or lactones, functional groups into the corresponding<br>
alcohol, or diol, characterized in that said process is carried out in the presence of a base<br>
and at least one catalyst or pre-catalyst in the form of a ruthenium complexes of a<br>
tetradentate ligand wherein the coordinating groups consist of at least one amino or imino<br>
group and at least one phosphino group.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the substrate can be a<br>
compound of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein Ra and Rb represent, simultaneously or independently, a linear, branched or<br>
cyclic C1-C30 aromatic, alkyl or alkenyl group, optionally substituted; or<br>
Ra and Rb are bonded together and form a C4-C20 saturated or unsaturated group,<br>
optionally substituted.<br>
The corresponding alcohols (i.e (II-a) and (II-b)), or the corresponding diol (II'),<br>
of said substrate (I), are of formula<br><br>
wherein Ra and Rb are defined as in formula (I).<br><br>
WO 2006/106484	PCT/IB2006/051028<br>
3<br>
A compound of formula (II) (i.e. II-a or II-b) will be obtained in the case where Ra<br>
and Rb are not bonded together, while a compound of formula (II') will be obtained in the<br>
case where Ra and Rb are bonded together.<br>
It is understood that by "a linear, branched or cyclic.......aromatic, alkyl, or alkenyl<br>
group" it is meant that said Ra or Rb can be in the form of, e.g., a linear alkyl group or can<br>
also be in the form of a mixture of said type of groups, e.g. a specific Ra may comprises a<br>
linear alkyl, a branched alkenyl, a (poly)cyclic alkyl and an aryl moiety, unless a specific<br>
limitation to only one type is mentioned. Similarly, in all the below embodiments of the<br>
invention when a group is mentioned as being in the form of more than one type of<br>
topology (e.g. linear, cyclic or branched) and/or unsaturation (e.g. alkyl, aromatic or<br>
alkenyle) it is meant also a group which may comprise moieties having any one of said<br>
topologies or unsaturations, as above explained.<br>

can also be reduced to the corresponding alcohol during the invention's process,<br>
according to the molar amount of H2 used, as well known by a person skilled in the art.<br>

substrate can be selected from the group consisting of sclareolide, C9-C15 spirolactones<br>
and C1-C4 alkyl esters of 4-mcthyl-6-(2,6,6-trimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)-3-hexenoic<br>

hydrogenation medium, without isolation or purification, just before their use.<br>

C3 to C8 hydrocarbon radical containing one carbon-carbon double bond such as<br>
methylallyl or allyl, with a non coordinating acid such as HBF4'Et2O, and then treating<br>
the resulting solution with the required amount of a ligands L4, such as defined<br>
previously, to give a solution of a catalyst according to formula (1). Furthermore, the<br>
mixture thus obtained can also be treated with a base in the presence of a primary or<br>
secondary alcohol. Furthermore, the complexes of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting<br>
an appropriate Ru complex such as, [RuCl2(PPh3)3], [RuCl2(cod)] or [RuCl2(arene)]2 with<br>
the required amount of a ligands L4, such as defined previously (cod representing a<br>
cyclooctadiene and arene being e.g. a benzene or naphthalene).<br>
It is also understood that the complex of formula (I) can also be obtained in situ<br>
from complexes which have a similar formula and which in presence of, for example an<br>
alcohol and a base, are converted into a compound of formula (I). For example, from a<br>
complex wherein X, Y, and Z have other meaning.<br>
To carry out the processes of the invention it is required also to use a base. Said<br>
base can be the substrate itself, if the latter is basic, a corresponding alcoholate or any<br>
base having preferentially a pKa above 11. According to a particular embodiment of the<br>
invention said base may have a pKa above 14. It is also understood that preferably said<br>
base does not reduce itself a substrate of formula (I). As non-limiting examples one may<br>
cite the following type of base: alcoholate, hydroxides, alkaline or alkaline-earth<br>
carbonates, phosphazenes, amides, basic alox, siliconates (i.e. silicium derivatives having<br>
SiO- or SiRO- groups), hydrides such as NaBH4, NaH or KH.<br>
One can cite, as non-limiting examples, alkaline or alkaline-earth metal<br>
carbonates, such as cesium carbonate, an alkaline or alkaline-earth metal hydroxides, C1-<br>
10 amidures, C10-26 phosphazene or an alcoholate of formula (R13O)2M or R13OM',<br>
wherein M is an alkaline-earth metal, M' is an alkaline metal or an ammonium NR144+,<br>
R13 stands for hydrogen or a C1 to C6 linear or branched alkyl radical and R14 stands for a<br>
C1 to C10 linear or branched alkyl radical, such as sodium or potassium alcoholates. Of<br>
course, other suitable bases can be used.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, said base is an alkaline alcoholate<br>
of formula R13OM'.<br><br>

As previously mentioned the processes of the invention consist in the<br>
hydrogenation of a substrate using a ruthenium complex and a base. A typical process<br>
implies the mixture of the substrate with the ruthenium complex, a base and optionally a<br>
solvent, and then treating such a mixture with molecular hydrogen at a chosen pressure<br>
and temperature.<br>
The complexes of the invention, an essential parameter of the process, can be<br>
added to the reaction medium in a large range of concentrations. As non-limiting<br>
examples, one can cite as complex concentration values those ranging from 50 ppm to<br>
50000 ppm, relative to the amount of substrate. Preferably, the complex concentration<br>
will be comprised between 100 and 20000 ppm. It goes without saying that the optimum<br>
concentration of complex will depend, as the person skilled in the art knows, on the<br>
nature of the latter, on the nature of the substrate and on the pressure of H2 used during<br>
the process, as well as the desired time of reaction.<br>
Useful quantities of base, added to the reaction mixture, may be comprised in a<br>
relatively large range. One can cite, as non-limiting examples, ranges between 5 to<br>
50000 molar equivalents, relative to the complex (e.g. base/com = 5 to 50000), preferably<br>
20 to 2000, and even more preferably between 50 and 1000 molar equivalents.<br>
The hydrogenation reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent. When a solvent is required or used for practical reasons, then any solvent current<br>
in hydrogenation reactions can be used for the purposes of the invention. Non-limiting<br>
examples include aromatic solvents such as toluene or xylene, hydrocarbon solvents such<br>
as hexane or cyclohexane, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or MTBE, polar solvents such<br>
as primary or secondary alcohols such as isopropanol or ethanol, or mixtures thereof. The<br>
choice of the solvent is a function of the nature of the complex and the person skilled in<br>
the art is well able to select the solvent most convenient in each case to optimize the<br>
hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In the hydrogenation process of the invention, the reaction can be carried out at a<br>
H2 pressure comprised between 105 Pa and 80x105 Pa (1 to 80 bars) or even more if<br>
desired. Again, a person skilled in the art is well able to adjust the pressure as a function<br>
of the catalyst load and of the dilution of the substrate in the solvent. As examples, one<br>
can cite typical pressures of 1 to 50x105 Pa (1 to 50 bar).<br><br>
WO 2006/106484	PCT/IB2006/051028<br>
13<br>
The temperature at which the hydrogenation can be carried out is comprised<br>
between 0Â°C and 120Â°C, more preferably in the range of between 50Â°C and 100Â°C. Of<br>
course, a person skilled in the art is also able to select the preferred temperature as a<br>
function of the melting and boiling point of the starting and final products as well as the<br>
desired time of reaction or conversion.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the<br>
abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br>
All the procedures described hereafter have been carried out under an inert<br>
atmosphere unless stated otherwise. Hydrogenations were carried out in open glass tubes<br>
placed inside a stainless steel autoclave. H2 gas (99.99990%) was used as received. All<br>
substrates and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents under Ar. NMR<br>
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 (1H at 400.1 MHz, 13C at 100.6 MHz, and 31P<br>
at 161.9 MHz) spectrometer and normally measured at 300 K, in CDCl3 unless indicated<br>
otherwise. Chemical shifts are listed in ppm.<br>

Catalytic Hydrogenation of various esters using complexes of formula (1)<br>
a)	using pre-formed complex<br>
A typical catalytic hydrogenation using preformed RuCl2(L-l) as pre-catalyst is described<br>
below with methyl benzoate as substrate:<br>
Under argon, a solution of methyl benzoate (2.721 g, 20 mmol) in THF (2 mL) was added<br>
with a syringe, followed by more THF (2x1 mL), to a Keim autoclave equipped with a<br>
glass liner containing RuCl2(L-l) (7.9 mg, 0.01 mmol, 0.05 mol%), solid NaOMe<br>
(107.9 mg, 2.0 mmol, 10 mol%) and THF (10 mL). The autoclave was pressurised with<br>
hydrogen gas at 50 bars and placed in a thermosttated oil bath set at 100Â°C. After 2 h 30<br>
min, the autoclave was removed from the oil bath, and cooled in a cold-water bath. Then,<br>
the reaction mixture was diluted with aq. 1N HC1 (50 mL) and extracted with MTBE<br>
(100 mL). Gas chromatography after silylation of an aliquot showed the following<br>
products: methyl benzoate (1.7%), benzyl alcohol (94.6%), benzoic acid (3.7%). Then,<br>
the organic phase was washed successively with aq. 1N KOH (50 mL) and aq. sat. NaCl<br>
(3 x 50 mL), and dried over MgSO4 anh. Filtration and removal of the solvent in vacuo<br>
gave a yellow liquid (2.085 g). Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel with<br>
pentane/Et2O (2/1) as elution mixture gave pure benzyl alcohol (1.742 g, 16.1 mmol,<br>
80%) as a colourless liquid.<br>

THF (10 mL). Then a solution of tridecane (368.8 mg, 0.02 mmol), as internal standard, is<br>
added in THF (2 mL), followed by more THF (2x1 mL). The autoclave was then<br>
pressurised with hydrogen gas at 50 bars and placed in a thermostatted oil bath set at<br>
100Â°C. After 2 h 30 min, the autoclave was removed from the oil bath, and cooled in a<br>
cold-water bath. Then, the reaction mixture was diluted with MTBE (100 mL) and<br>
washed successively with aq. 1N HC1 (50 mL) and aq. sat. NaCl (3 x 50 mL). Gas<br>
chromatography after silylation of an aliquot showed the following products: benzyl<br>
alcohol (97.4%), benzoic acid (2.6%). GC yield based on the internal standard gave a<br>
yield of 90% of benzyl alcohol.<br>
