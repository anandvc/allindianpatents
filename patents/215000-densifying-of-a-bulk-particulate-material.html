				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to densifying of a bulk particulate material. In<br>
particular, it relates to a method and to apparatus for densifying a bulk particulate<br>
material.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
densifying a bulk particulate material, the method including<br>
at least partially confining the bulk particulate material; and<br>
mechanically severely agitating the confined bulk particulate material with at least<br>
two elongate rotatable members submerged in the confined bulk particulate material, to<br>
provide a smaller average particle size and increased BET surface area, the rotatable<br>
members each having an axis of rotation and including a plurality of axially spaced<br>
agitating formations which project outwardly away from their axes of rotation, and the<br>
rotatable members being transversely spaced and arranged one above the other,<br>
thereby to densify the bulk particulate material.<br>
The action of the submerged rotatable members and the agitating formations<br>
is thus not to compress the bulk particulate material, but mechanically severely to<br>
agitate the confined bulk particulate material, during agitation thoroughly mixing the bulk<br>
particulate material, without significantly fluidising the bulk particulate material and<br>
without causing any stable cavities in the bulk particulate material.<br>
Typically, each rotatable member is submerged in the confined bulk<br>
particulate material. In other words, there is typically a head of bulk particulate material<br>
above all of the rotatable members.<br>
The method may include feeding the bulk particulate material being densified<br>
in a direction which is transverse to the axes of rotation of the rotatable members, past<br>
the rotatable members.<br>
The at least two rotatable members arranged one above the other may be<br>
rotated in the same direction.<br>
Preferably, at least two of the elongate rotatable members are arranged side<br>
by side. When at least two rotatable members are arranged side by side, they may be<br>
rotated in opposite directions.<br>
A vertical bulk density gradient may be established in the confined bulk<br>
particulate material, with the highest bulk density being at the bottom.<br>
The bulk particulate material may be at least partially confined in a manner<br>
which leaves a free head space above the confined bulk particulate material, with the<br>
agitated bulk particulate material being allowed to take up at least some of the free head<br>
space during agitation.<br>
The axes of rotation of the rotatable members are typically substantially<br>
parallel. The axes of rotation preferably extend sideways, e.g. substantially horizontal.<br>
The bulk particulate material may be at least partially confined in a vessel.<br>
The rotatable members may be rotated such that a point on an extreme<br>
radially outer periphery of a rotatable member, submerged in the bulk particulate<br>
material, travels at a speed of between about 3 m/s and about 100 m/s, typically<br>
between about 20 m/s and about 23 m/s.<br>
Confining the bulk particulate material may include feeding the bulk<br>
particulate material into the vessel. Thus, an entire body of bulk particulate material<br>
may be densified inside the vessel to provide a uniform body of particulate material<br>
having a uniform bulk density inside the vessel.<br>
The method may include vibrating the vessel to inhibit agglomeration or<br>
build-up or caking of the particulate material against interior surfaces of the vessel.<br>
The method may include discharging the flowable densified bulk particulate<br>
material from the vessel. It is to be appreciated that the method can be conducted on a<br>
continuous basis or on a batch basis, discharging of the densified bulk particulate<br>
material from the vessel and feeding of bulk particulate material into the vessel thus<br>
occurring batch-wise, or on a controlled basis. Thus, the bulk particulate material may<br>
be fed on a continuous basis into the vessel, and the densified bulk particulate material<br>
may be discharged on a continuous basis from the vessel, the entire body of bulk<br>
particulate material inside the vessel having, at steady state conditions, a substantially<br>
higher average bulk density than bulk particulate material feed.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a bulk particulate feed material is<br>
densified on a continuous basis, with the bulk particulate feed material being fed from<br>
above the rotatable members and with densified bulk particulate material being<br>
removed from below the rotatable members.<br>
The method may include measuring or determining the bulk density of the<br>
densified bulk particulate material prior to discharging it from the vessel. Instead, the<br>
method may include measuring or determining the bulk density of the densified bulk<br>
particulate material after it has been discharged from the vessel, or during agitation of<br>
the bulk particulate material, e.g. by measuring the current drawn by an electric motor or<br>
motors used to rotate the rotatable members.<br>
The rotatable members may be rotated at an angular speed of between 100<br>
rpm and 3500 rpm. Preferably, the rotatable members are rotated at an angular speed<br>
of between 500 rpm and 1000 rpm. Typically, the rotatable members are rotated at an<br>
angular speed of between 700 rpm and 800 rpm, e.g. about 732 rpm.<br>
The bulk particulate material, prior to densification, may have a mean particle<br>
size of less than 1 mm. Typically, the bulk particulate material has a mean particle size<br>
of less than 0.5 mm, even less than 1 urn, e.g. about 0.15 urn.<br>
The method may include extracting dust from the vessel.<br>
The ratio of the bulk density of the particulate material prior to densifying<br>
thereof, to the bulk density of the flowable densified particulate material may be at least<br>
2 : 3. Preferably, the ratio of the bulk density of the particulate material prior to<br>
densifying thereof, to the bulk density of the flowable densified particulate material is at<br>
least 1 : 5, depending on the bulk density of the particulate material prior to densifying<br>
and the particulate material being densified, The ratio can be as large as 1 : 10, or even<br>
larger, e.g. 1 : 12 depending on the bulk density of the particulate material prior to<br>
densifying and the particulate material being densified.<br>
The mechanical agitation of the bulk particulate material may be effected in<br>
the presence of a densification agent. The densification agent will be present in<br>
quantities small enough to ensure that the densified bulk particulate material remains<br>
flowable and essentially dry, and therefore does not form a dough, paste, slurry or the<br>
like.<br>
The densification agent may be a polar liquid. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, the densification agent is an aqueous fluid, e.g. water or demineralised<br>
water.<br>
When the densification agent is an aqueous fluid, the bulk particulate<br>
material, prior to or during densifying thereof, may include water in a mass<br>
concentration falling in a range with a lower limit of about 0.5 %. The lower limit may<br>
however be as low as about 0.45 %, or even as low as about 0.4 %. An upper limit of<br>
the range may be as high as about 10 %, or even higher at about 15 %, or even as high<br>
as about 20 %.<br>
It is however to be appreciated that the bulk particulate material being<br>
densified may affect the effective range within which an aqueous densification agent<br>
can be used. The aforementioned ranges are however suitable for the densification of<br>
microsilica, such as silica fume.<br><br>
The bulk particulate material may be a hygroscopic material. The bulk<br>
particulate material may be microsilica, e.g. fumed silica, precipitated silica, colloidal<br>
silica or silica gel.<br>
Instead, the bulk particulate material may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of carbon black, coal, fly ash, kaolin, and meta kaolin. Also, the bulk<br>
particulate material may be selected from the group consisting of Mn2O3, Mn3O4, V2O5,<br>
alumina, bauxite, cement and slag.<br>
When the bulk particulate material is particulate silica, the particulate silica<br>
may have a particle size of the less than 0.5 urn, typically less than 0.2 urn. Indeed, it is<br>
expected that the invention will find particular, though not exclusive application in<br>
densifying so-called silica fume.<br>
The method may include adding the densification agent to the bulk<br>
particulate material, prior to or during mechanical agitation of the bulk particulate<br>
material.<br>
The method may include allowing the concentration of the densification agent<br>
to reduce during or after the mechanical agitation of the bulk particulate material. Thus,<br>
an average concentration of the densification agent in the densified bulk particulate<br>
material may be less than the average concentration of the densification agent in the<br>
bulk particulate material being densified.<br>
The method may include allowing bulk particulate material to heat up during<br>
the mechanical agitation, with at least a portion of the densification agent vaporizing and<br>
being removed from the bulk particulate material being densified or from the densified<br>
bulk particulate material.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, when the densification agent is an<br>
aqueous liquid, the bulk particulate material may include water in, or water may be<br>
added to the bulk particulate material to, a concentration of more than 4 % by mass e.g.<br>
4 % to 8 % by mass, with the densified bulk particulate material including less than 3 %<br>
water by mass. In another embodiment of the invention, when the bulk particulate<br><br>
material is microsilica and the densification agent is an aqueous liquid, the microsilica<br>
includes water in, or water is being added to the microsilica to, a concentration of<br>
between 4 % and 8 % by mass, e.g. between 6 % and 8 % by mass, with the densified<br>
microsilica including less than 1.5 %, preferably less than 1 %, water by mass. The<br>
Applicant has also found that, when the bulk particulate material is microsilica, excellent<br>
results are obtained when the microsilica being densified includes about 1.5 %<br>
moisture, with the densified microsilica being substantially dry with a moisture content of<br>
almost 0 %.<br>
The method may include controlling the density of the densified bulk<br>
particulate material. The controlling of the density of the densified bulk particulate<br>
material may be effected by a method selected from the group consisting of<br>
manipulating the residence time of the bulk particulate material in the vessel,<br>
manipulating the angular speed of rotation of the rotatable members, manipulating the<br>
level of the bulk particulate material in the vessel, controlling the concentration of the<br>
densification agent present with the bulk particulate material, and two or more of these<br>
methods. The controlling of the density of the densified bulk particulate material is<br>
however not necessarily limited to these methods.<br>
The invention extends to a method of densifying a bulk particulate material<br>
which includes<br>
feeding the bulk particulate material into a densification zone;<br>
at least partially confining the bulk particulate material in the densification zone;<br>
and<br>
mechanically agitating the confined bulk particulate material with at least one<br>
elongate rotatable member submerged in the confined bulk particulate material, the<br>
rotatable member having an axis of rotation and including a plurality of axially spaced<br>
agitating formations which project outwardly away from the axis of rotation, the bulk<br>
particulate material being fed through the densification zone in a direction which is<br>
transverse to the axis of rotation of the rotatable member.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided bulk<br>
particulate material densification and size reduction apparatus which includes<br><br>
a vessel to at least partially confine a body of a bulk participate material, the<br>
vessel defining a bulk particulate material receiving or confining zone;<br>
at least two elongate rotatable members which are transversely spaced and<br>
arranged one above the other such that they will be submerged in use by bulk<br>
particulate material in the bulk particulate material receiving or confining zone<br>
mechanically severely to agitate the bulk particulate material, the rotatable members<br>
each having an axis of rotation and including a plurality of axially spaced agitating<br>
formations which project outwardly away from their axes of rotation; and<br>
drive means connected to the rotatable members capable of rotating the rotatable<br>
members at various elevations at different speeds about their axes of rotation to agitate<br>
bulk particulate material in the bulk particulate material receiving zone.<br>
Preferably, each rotatable member with agitating formations is arranged to be<br>
submerged in use by bulk particulate material in the bulk particulate material receiving<br>
zone.<br>
The at least two rotatable members arranged one above the other may be<br>
configured to rotate in the same direction.<br>
Preferably, at least two of the elongate rotatable members are arranged side<br>
by side. When at least two rotatable members are arranged side by side, they may be<br>
configured to rotate in opposite directions.<br>
The vessel may define a free head space above the bulk particulate material<br>
receiving or confining zone.<br>
The axes of rotation of the rotatable members are typically substantially<br>
parallel. The axes of rotation preferably extend sideways, e.g. substantially horizontal.<br>
The apparatus typically includes an outlet or outlets for densified bulk<br>
particulate material at a low elevation and an inlet for bulk particulate material at a<br>
higher elevation than the outlet. The inlet may be above the rotatable members and the<br>
outlet or outlets may be below the rotatable members. Thus, the outlet or outlets may<br>
be a bottom outlet or bottom outlets.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the inlet, outlet(s) and rotatable<br>
members are arranged in use to feed bulk particulate material being densified through<br>
the bulk particulate material receiving or confining zone in a direction which is<br>
transverse to the axes of rotation of the rotatable members.<br>
The apparatus may include a densification agent inlet leading into the vessel.<br>
The apparatus may include a densification agent outlet from the vessel to<br>
remove vaporized densification agent. Instead, the densificatfon agent inlet may also<br>
function as a densification agent outlet.<br>
The agitating formations may project radially away from the axes of rotation<br>
of the rotatable members. The rotatable members may thus include a core from which<br>
the agitating formations project and to which they are attached.<br>
The agitating formations may individually comprise a shank or shaft portion<br>
and a head portion at an end of the shaft portion remote from the core. The head<br>
portion may advantageously be used to scrape clean internal surfaces of the vessel.<br>
The agitating formations may be arranged in a plurality, e.g. four, axially<br>
extending but circumferentially spaced rows. The rows may be staggered so that an<br>
agitating formation in one row is flanked by empty positions in adjacent rows.<br>
The drive means may be capable of rotating the rotatable members at an<br>
angular speed of between 100 rpm and 3500 rpm when the rotatable members are<br>
submerged in the body of particulate material. Typically, the drive means is capable of<br>
rotating the rotatable members at an angular speed of between 500 rpm and 1000 rpm<br>
when the rotatable members are submerged in the body of particulate material, e.g. at<br>
about 700 rpm to 800 rpm.<br>
The apparatus may be configured for continuous operation in a continuous<br>
rocess.<br>
The apparatus may include conveying means and bagging means, the conveying<br>
means being arranged to convey densified bulk particulate material from the vessel<br>
to the bagging means for bagging the densified bulk particulate material. Instead, the<br>
outlet for densified bulk particulate material may feed into bagging means.<br>
The apparatus may include vibration means for vibrating the vessel to inhibit<br>
agglomeration or caking or build-up of the particulate material against interior<br>
surfaces of the vessel.<br>
The apparatus may include dust extraction means for extracting dust from the<br>
vessel.<br>
The rotatable members and interior surfaces of the vessel may be coated with a<br>
material which inhibits caking or agglomeration or build-up of the bulk particulate<br>
material against or on them.<br>
The apparatus may include density measurement means and control means for<br>
controlling the bulk density of the densified bulk particulate material.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying diagrammatic drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows a sectioned elevational view of one embodiment of densification<br>
apparatus in accordance with the invention for densifying a bulk particulate material;<br>
Figure 2 shows an elevational side view of a rotatable member of the densification<br>
apparatus of Figure 1; and<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show schematically other arrangements of rotatable members of<br>
densification apparatus in accordance with the invention for densifying a bulk<br>
particulate material.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates one<br>
embodiment of densification apparatus in accordance with the invention for<br>
densifying a bulk particulate material. The apparatus 10 include a vessel 12 for<br><br>
containing and confining the bulk participate material, and transversely spaced elongate<br>
rotatable members 14, 15 which are in use submerged in the bulk particulate material<br>
contained in the vessel 12, and which are rotatable about horizontal longitudinally<br>
extending axes of rotation, which are parallel..<br>
The vessel 12 is rectangular in plan, with the longer sides of the vessel 12<br>
being parallel to the axes of rotation of the rotatable members 14, 15 and with the<br>
rotatable members 14, 15 extending through the shorter sides of the vessel 12.<br>
Bearings are provided for the rotatable members 14,15.<br>
The vessel 12 defines a bulk particulate material receiving or confining or<br>
densification zone 16 within which the rotatable members 14,15 are located.<br>
The vessel 12 includes an Inlet 22 for feeding bulk particulate material into<br>
the vessel 12, and an outlet 24 to remove densified bulk particulate material from the<br>
vessel 12. The inlet 22 is located in a roof 26 of the vessel 12, and the outlet 24 is<br>
located in a wall 28 of the vessel 12 extending parallel to the axis of rotation of the<br>
rotatable member 14. In a more preferred embodiment, the outlet, or more than one<br>
outlet, is located in a floor 46 of the vessel 12..<br>
The rotatable member 14 is located more or less at the elevation of the outlet<br>
24. The rotatable member 14 is mechanically attached by means of a coupling 17 to a<br>
drive shaft 30, which is in turn drivingly connected to an electric motor 32. The electric<br>
motor 32 is capable of selectively rotating the rotatable member 14 at an angular speed<br>
of between 700 rpm and 800 rpm. The coupling 17 also functions as a pulley. By<br>
means of a pulley 19, a drive belt 21 and the coupling/pulley 17, the electric motor 32<br>
can also drive the rotatable member 15.<br>
The electric motor 32 and the vessel 12 are supported on a base 34 having<br>
legs 36.<br>
The rotatable members 14, 15 each include a core 38 and a plurality of<br>
axially spaced, radially extending agitating formations 40. The agitating formations 40<br>
of each rotatable member 14, 15 are arranged in four axially extending rows, only three<br><br>
rows of which are visible in Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings. The rows are<br>
equiangularly spaced from one another so that an angle of 90 ° exists between adjacent<br>
rows. The rows are also staggered so that an agitating formation 40 in one row is<br>
flanked by empty positions in adjacent rows, with agitating formations 40 of non-<br>
adjacent rows being diagonally aligned.<br>
Each agitating formation 40 comprises a shank portion 42 and a head portion<br>
44 (see Figure 2). In one embodiment of the invention, each agitating formation 40 is in<br>
the form of a bolt screwed into the core 38. However, it is to be appreciated that there<br>
are many other suitable embodiments of agitating formations.<br>
The vessel 12 and the rotatable member 14 are dimensioned such that there<br>
is little clearance between the floor 46 and walls 28 of the vessel 12, on the one hand,<br>
and the head portions 44 of the agitating formations 40 when the rotatable member 14<br>
is rotated, on the other hand. Similarly, there is little clearance between the head<br>
portions 44 of the agitating formations 40 of the rotatable member 15 and the walls 28<br>
of the vessel 12. Accordingly, the head portions 44 act during rotation of the rotatable<br>
members 14, 15 as scrapers to inhibit caking of the bulk particulate material on interior<br>
surfaces of the vessel 12, in addition to agitating the bulk particulate material.<br>
A densification agent inlet 48 is provided in a wall of the vessel 12, at a<br>
relatively high elevation. The inlet 48 is in flow communication with a water feed line 50.<br>
A flow controller 52 is provided in the flow line 50.<br>
If desired, a dust extraction outlet (not shown) may be provided for the vessel<br>
12, and a vibrator (not shown), may be mounted against an exterior surface of the<br>
vessel 12.<br>
In use, the vessel 12 is fed on a controlled and measured basis with bulk<br>
particulate material, as shown by arrow 54, continuously to fill the vessel 12 thereby to<br>
cover the rotatable members 14, 15. Water as densification agent is added in a<br>
predetermined controlled ratio through the inlet 48 to the bulk particulate material.<br>
When the bulk particulate material is silica fume, this ratio is about 6 : 100 on a mass<br><br>
basis. However, it is to be appreciated that the apparatus 10 can also function without<br>
the use of a densification agent, such as water.<br>
In order to density the bulk particulate material, the submerged rotatable<br>
members 14, 15 are rotated at an angular speed of about 732 rpm by means of the<br>
electric motor 32. The agitating formations 40 severely agitate the bulk particulate<br>
material thereby densifying the bulk particulate material. During agitation, the bulk<br>
particulate material is flung against the sides of the vessel 12. The rotatable members<br>
14, 15 however do not fluidise the body of bulk particulate material inside the vessel 12<br>
to any significant extent, nor are cylindrical cavities formed co-axial with the rotatable<br>
members 14, 15.<br>
If a vibrator is present, the vibrator is run to inhibit caking of the bulk<br>
parti"culate material against the interior surfaces of the vessel 12, and dust which is<br>
formed is extracted through the dust extraction outlet (if present), together with water<br>
vapour formed as a result of the frictional heating of the particulate material, which can<br>
reach temperatures of 70 °C to 80 °C. If a separate densification agent outlet is not<br>
provided, the bulk particulate material inlet 22 can serve to remove water vapour from<br>
the vessel 12.<br>
The densified bulk particulate material is discharged through the outlet 24.<br>
Discharging is effected by the rotation of the rotatable member 14. The density of the<br>
densified bulk particulate material discharged from the vessel 12 is measured by density<br>
measurement and control means (not shown), which increases or decreases the<br>
discharge rate of the densified bulk particulate material from the vessel 12 by opening<br>
or closing the outlet 24, thereby increasing or decreasing the residence time of the bulk<br>
particulate material in the vessel 12, in order to density the bulk particulate material to a<br>
desired bulk density. Typically, the densified bulk particulate material includes less than<br>
1 % by mass water and is thus essentially dry.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4 of the drawings, other embodiments of<br>
densification apparatus in accordance with the invention for densifying a bulk particulate .<br>
material are generally indicated by reference numerals 200 and 300. As can be seen<br>
from the simplified schematic diagrams shown in Figures 3 and 4, various other<br><br>
arrangements of rotatable members are possible. In Figure 3, it is shown that more<br>
than two, e.g. three, rotatable members may be used in a vertical arrangement, and that<br>
more than one outlet 24 may be employed. Figure 5 illustrates how a plurality, e.g. four,<br>
rotatable members 14 are arranged in a matrix, and that a bottom outlet 24 (preferred)<br>
may be employed.<br>
When a plurality of vertically spaced rotatable members are used, rotatable<br>
members at a higher elevation can be used to shape or reshape and reduce in size<br>
particles of the particulate material (e.g. alumina or bauxite), with rotatable members at<br>
a lower elevation contributing more to the densification of the bulk particulate material.<br>
In such an arrangement, the speed of the rotatable members at various elevations may<br>
be different.<br>
It is an advantage of the invention, as illustrated, that it provides a cost<br>
effective method and apparatus for densifying a bulk particulate material, such as silica<br>
fume. It is a further advantage of the invention, as illustrated, that the method and<br>
apparatus are capable of densifying material such as silica fume to a higher bulk density<br>
than conventional pneumatic (or other) methods and apparatus used for the densifying<br>
of silica fume and like materials. Particle agglomeration is also much less compared to<br>
the prior art pneumatic densification processes of which the Applicant is aware, thus<br>
providing smaller average particle sizes, and increased BET surface areas. The<br>
apparatus 10, as illustrated, advantageously also lends itself to continuous processes.<br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1. A method of densifying a bulk particulate material, the method comprising at least<br>
partially confining the bulk particulate material; and mechanically severely agitating the<br>
confined bulk particulate material with at least two elongate rotatable members<br>
