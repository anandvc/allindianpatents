"POLYARYLCARBOXAMIDES USEFUL AS LIPID LOWERING AGENTS"<br>
JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA N.V., of   Turnhoutseweg 30, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
POLYARYLCARBOXAMIDES USEFUL AS LIPID LOWERING AGENTS<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel polyarylcarboxamides having apolipoprotein B inhibiting activity and concomitant lipid lowering activity. The invention further relates to methods for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as well as the use of said compounds as a medicine for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, obesily and type II diabetes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Obesity is the cause of a myriad of serious health problems like the adult onset of diabetes and heart disease. In addition, the loss of weight is getting an obsession among an increasing proportion of the human population.<br>
The causal relationship between hypercholesterolemia, particularly that associated with increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as VLDL), and premature atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular disease is now widely recognized. However, a limited number of drugs are presently available for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Drugs primarily used for the management of hyperlipidemia include bile acid sequestrant resins such as cholestyramine and colestipol, fibric acid derivatives such as bÂ§zafibrate, clofibrate, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate and gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors such as HMG Co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitors. The inconvenience of administration (a granular form to be dispersed in water or orange juice) and the major side-effects (gastro-intestinal discomfort and constipation) of bile acid sequestrant resins constitute major drawbacks. Fibric acid derivatives induce a moderate decrease (by 5 to 25%) of LDL cholesterol (except in hypertriglyceridemic patients in whom initially low levels tend to increase) and, although usually well tolerated, suffer from side-effects including potentiation of warfarine, pruritus, fatigue, headache, insomnia, painful reversible myopathy and stiffness in large muscle groups, impotency and impaired renal function. Nicotinic acid is a potent lipid lowering agent resulting in a 15 to 40% decrease in LDL cholesterol (and even 45 to 60% when combined with a bile acid sequestrant resin) but with a high incidence of<br><br>
troublesome side-effects related to the drug's associated vasodilatory action, such as headache, flushing, palpitations, tachychardia and occasional syncopes, as well as other side-effects such as gastro-intestinal discomfort, hyperucemia and impairment of glucose tolerance. Among the family of HMG Co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitors, lovastatin and simvastatin are both inactive prodrugs containing a lactone ring which is hydrolyzed in the liver to form the corresponding active hydroxy-acid derivative. Inducing a reduction of LDL cholesterol by 35 to 45%, they are generally well tolerated with alow incidence of minor side effects. However there still remains a need for new lipid lowering agents with improved efficiency and/or acting via other mechanisms than the above mentioned drugs.<br>
Plasma lipoproteins are water-soluble complexes of high molecular weight formed from lipids (cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipids) and apolipoproteins. Five major classes of lipoproteins that differ in the proportion of lipids and the type of apolipoprotein, all having their origin in the liver and/or the intestine, have been defined according to their density (as measured by ultracentrifugation). They include LDL, VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as IDL), high density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as HDL) and chylomicrons. Ten major human plasma apolipoproteins have been identified. VLDL, which is secreted by the liver and contains apolipoprotein B (hereinafter referred as Apo-B), undergoes degradation to LDL which transports 60 to 70% of the total serum cholesterol. Apo-B is also the main protein component of LDL. Increased LDL-cholesterol in serum, due to oversynthesis or decreased metabolism, is causally related to atherosclerosis. In contrast high density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as HDL), which contain apolipoprotein A1, have a protective effect and are inversely correlated with the risk of a coronary heart disease. The HDL/LDL ratio is thus a convenient method of assessing the atherogenic potential of an individual's plasma lipid profile.<br>
The two isoforms of apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo B-48 and apo B-100, are important proteins in human lipoprotein metabolism. Apo B-48, so named because it appears to be about 48% the size of apo B-100 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, is synthesized by the intestine in humans. Apo B-48 is necessary for the assembly of chylomicrons and therefore has an obligatory role in the intestinal absorption of dietary fats. Apo B-100, which is<br><br>
produced in the liver in humans, is required for the synthesis and secretion of VLDL. LDL, which contain about 2/3 of the cholesterol in human plasma, are metabolic products of VLDL Apo B-100 is virtually the only protein component of LDL. Elevated concentrations of apo B-100 and LDL cholesterol in plasma are recognized risk factors for developing atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.<br>
A large number of genetic and acquired diseases can result in hyperlipidemia. They can be classified into primary and secondary hyperlipidemic states. The most common causes of the secondary hyperlipidemias are diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, drugs, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis and bulimia. Primary hyperlipidemias have also been classified into common hypercholesterolaemja, familial combined hyperlipidaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, remnant hyperiipidaemia, chylomicronaemia syndrome and familial hyper-triglyceridaemia.<br>
Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (hereinafter referred as MTP) is known to catalyze the transport of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester by preference to phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine. It was demonstrated by D.Sharp et al., Nature (1993) 365:65 that the defect causing abetalipoproteinemia is in the MTP gene. This indicates that MTP is required for the synthesis of Apo B-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, the precursor to LDL. It therefore follows that an MTP inhibitor would inhibit the synthesis of VLDL and LDL, thereby lowering levels of VLDL, LDL, cholesterol and triglyceride in humans. MTP inhibitors have been reported in Canadian patent application No. 2,091,102 and in WO 96/26205. MTP inhibitors belonging to the class of polyarylcarboxamldes have also been reported in U.S.Patent No. 5,760,246 as well as in WO-96/40640 and WO-98/27979.<br>
One of the goals of the present invention is to provide an improved treatment for patients suffering from obesity or atherosclerosis, especially coronary atherosclerosis and more generally from disorders which are related to atheroÂ¬sclerosis, such as ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebral vascular disease. Another goal of the present invention is to cause regression of atherosclerosis and inhibit its clinical consequences, particularly morbidity and mortality.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that a class of<br>
novelpolyarylcarbbxamidecompounds is acting as selective MTP inhibitors, i.e. is able to selectively block MTP at the level of the gut wall in mammals, and is therefore apritoising caadidaie as a medicine namely for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The present invention additionally provides several methods for preparing such polyarylcarboxamide compounds, as well as pharmaceutical compositions incjuding such compounds. Furthermore, the invention provides a certain number of novel compounds which are useful intermediates for the preparation of the therapeutically active polyarylcarboxamide compounds, as well as methods for preparing such intermediates. Finally, the invention provides a method of treatment of a condition selected from atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and type II diabetes, comprising administering a therapeutically active polyarylcarboxamide compound to a mammal.<br>

In particular, the term "stereoisomericaliy pure" or "chirally pure" relates to compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i.e. at least 90% of one isomer and at most 10% of the other possible isomers), preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 94% and most preferably at least 97%. The terms "enantiomerically pure" and "diastereomerically pure" should be understood in a similar way, having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess, of the mixture in question.<br>
Consequently, if a mixture of enantiomers is obtained during any of the following preparation methods, it can be separated by liquid chromatography using a suitable chiral stationary phase. Suitable chiral stationary phases are, for example, polysaccharides, in particular cellulose or amylose derivatives. Commercially available polysaccharide based chiral stationary phases are ChiralCelâ¢ CA, OA, OB, OC, OD, OF, OG, OJ and OK, and Chiralpakâ¢ AD, AS, OP(+) and OT(+). Appropriate eluents or mobile phases for use in combination with said polysaccharide chiral stationary phases are hexane and the like, modified with an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol and the like.<br>
The terms cis and trans are used herein in accordance with Chemical Abstracts nomenclature and refer to the position of the substituents on a ring moiety.<br>
The absolute stereochemical configuration of the polyarylcarboxamide compounds of formula (I) and of the intermediates used in their preparation may easily be determined by those skilled in the art while using well-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br><br>
Furthermore, some polyarylcarboxamide compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates used in their preparation may exhibit polymorphism.

One advantage of the present invention is the easiness with which the compounds of formula (1) can be manufactured by a high number of different processes. Some of these processes will now be described in details, without pretending to provide an exhaustive list of the methods for preparing the said compounds.<br>
A first process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound according to this invention is a process wherein an intermediate phenylene amine having the formula<br><br><br><br>
(II)<br>
wherein Zi, Z2, X2, X3, p1, R1, R2, A and B are as defined in formula (I), is reacted with a polyarylcarboxylic acid or halide having the formula (III),<br><br>
wherein X1, Ar\ Ar2, p2, p3, R3 and R4 are as defined in formula (I) and Y1 is selected from hydroxy and halo, in at least one reaction-inert solvent and optionally in the presence of a suitable base, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing stereochemical^ isomeric forms thereof. In case Y1 is hydroxy, it may be convenient to activate the biphenylcarboxylic acid of formula (III) by adding an effective amount of a reaction promoter. Non-limiting examples of such reaction promoters include carfaonyldiimidazole, diimides<br><br>
such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-(3-dimethyiaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide, and functional derivatives thereof. For this type of acylation procedure, it is preferred to use a polar aprotic solvent such as, for instance, methylene chloride. Suitable bases for carrying out this first process include tertiary amines such as triethylamine, triisopropylamine and the like. Suitable temperatures for carrying out the first process of the invention typically range from about 20Â°6 to about 140Â°C, depending on the particular solvent used, and will most often be the boiling temperature of the said solvent.<br>
wherein Zi, Z2, X^ X2, p\ p2, p3, Ar1, Ar2, Ri, Ra, R3 and R4 are as defined in formula (I) and X3 is nitrogen, is reacted with a reactant having the formula (V)<br><br>
A second process for preparing a pblyarylcarboxamide compound according to this invention, wherein X3 is nitrogen, is a process wherein an intermediate having the formula<br><br>
wherein A and B are as defined in formula (I) and Y2 is selected from halo, tosyloxy, mesyloxy, naphtylsulfonyloxy, or-A-Y2is R5COR5, wherein R5 and R'5 are such that the radical R'sCHRs is encompassed by the definition of A in formula (I), in at least one reaction-inert solvent and optionally in the presence of at least one suitable nucleophilic substitution activator and/or a suitable base, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing stereochemical^ isomeric forms thereof. When Y2 is halo, the alkylation coupling procedure may for instance be effected in the presence of sodium or potassium carbonate or a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in a solvent such<br><br>
as dimethylformamide or methylisopropylketone and optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide in order to enhance nucleophilic substitution. Intermediates of formula (IV) wherein X3 is nitrogen may also be reductively N-alkylated by means of an aldehyde or a ketone of formula (V) wherein -A-Y2 is R'sCOR5, thus forming compounds of formula (I). Said reductive N-alkylation may be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as for example toluene, methanol, tetrahydrofuran or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of a reducing agent. Non-limiting examples of such reducing agents include hydrogen and borohydrides, e.g. sodium borohydride, zinc borohydride, lithium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, triacetoxy borohydride and the like. When a borohydride is used as the reducing agent, it may be convenient to perform the N-alkylation in the additional presence of a catalyst. Non-limiting examples of such catalysts include transition metal alkoxides, e.g. titanÂ»um(IV)isopropoxide, titanium(lV)-n-butoxide and the like, as disclosed in J.Org.Chem. (1990), 55:2552-4. When hydrogen is used as the reducing agent, it may be convenient to perform the N-alkylation in the additional presence of a catalyst. Non-limiting examples of catalysts suitable for this purpose include a noble metal supported on a carrier such as for instance palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. The formation of a Schiff base in a first step of the said reductive N-alkylation reaction may be further enhanced by the additional presence of a suitable reagent such as aluminium terbutoxide, calcium oxide, calcium hydride and the like. An appropriate catalyst-poison, e.g. thiophene, butanethiol, quinoline sulfur or the like, may also be added to the reaction nixture in order to prevent undesired hydrogenation of certain functional groups n the reactants and/or the reaction product. Stirring and optionally elevated temperature and/or pressure may further enhance the rate of such a reaction.<br>
A third process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound of the invention is a process wherein an intermediate having the formula<br><br><br>
(VI) wherein Zi, Z2, Xi, X2, X3, p1 p2, p3, Ar1, Ar2, Ri, R2 i R3, R4 and A are as defined in formula (!) and Y3 is selected from halo and hydroxy, is reacted with a reactant of the formula BH, wherein B is NR6R7 or ORB and R6, R7 and R8 are as defined in formula (I), in at least one reaction-inert solvent and optionally in the presence of at least one suitable coupling reagent and/or a suitable base,, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. In case Y3 is hydroxy, it may be convenient to activate the carboxylic acid of formula (VI) by adding an effective amount of a reaction promoter. Non-limiting examples of such reaction promoters include carbonyldiimidazole, diimides such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbo-diimide, and functional derivatives thereof. In case a chirally pure reactant of formula (V) is used, a fast and enantiomerization-free reaction of the intermediate of formula (VI) with the said reactant may be performed in the further presence of an effective amount of a compound such as hydroxybenzotriazole, benzotriazolyloxytris (dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate, tetrapyrrolidinophospho-nium hexafluorophosphate, bromotripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluoro-, phosphate, or a functional derivative thereof, such as disclosed by D. Hudson, J.Org.Chem. (1988), 53:617. In case Y3 is hydroxy and B is OR8, then the esten'fication reaction may conveniently be performed in the presence of an effective amount of an acid such as sulfuric acid and the like.<br>
A fourth process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound according to this invention wherein X3 is nitrogen and wherein A is a group suitable for a Michael addition reaction, is a process wherein an intermediate having the<br><br>
formula (IV), wherein X3 is nitrogen, is reacted with a reactant of the formula (VII)<br><br>
(VII) wherein B is as defined in formula (I), and Y4 and Y'4are such that the radical<br><br>
is encompassed by the definition of A in formula (I), in at least one reaction-inert solvent, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. The reaction-inert solvent may be, for instance, dimethyJformamide or methanol and the reaction temperature may be the boiling point of the said solvent. Contrary to most of the alternative processes for preparing the polyarylcarboxamide compounds of this invention, this fourth process does not require the presence of a catalyst or otherwise coupling reagent in order to quantatively yield the target compound. A base such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate and the like may optionally be added to the reaction mixture. As conventionally defined in the art, A preferably is an a,0-unsaturated carbonyl compound, such as a ketone or an ester, the p carbon atom of which is susceptible of a nucleophilic attack. Non-limiting examples of groups A suitable for such a Michael addition reaction include for instance:<br><br>
A fifth process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound according to this invention is a process wherein an intermediate having the formula (VIII)<br><br><br><br>
(VIII) wherein X1, p1 p2, p3, Ar\ Ar2, R,, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined in formula (!) and Y5 is selected from halo, B(OH)2, alkylboronates and cyclic analogues thereof, is reacted with a reactant having the formula (IX)<br><br>
(IX) wherein Z1, Za, X3, A and B are as defined in formula (I), in at least one reaction-inert solvent and optionally in the presence of at least one transition metal coupling reagent and/or at least one suitable ligand, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. This type of reaction being known in the art as the Buchwaldt reaction, reference to the applicable metal coupling reagents and/or suitable ligands, e.g. palladium compounds such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine), tris(dibenzylidene-acetone dipalladium, 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1 '-binaphtyl and the like, may be found for instance in Tetrahedron Letters (1996) 37(40) 7181-7184 and JAm.Chem.Soc. (1996) 118:7216. If Y5is B(OH)2l an alkylboronate or a cyclic analogue thereof, then cupric acetate should be used as the coupling reagent, according to Tetrahedron Letters (1998) 39:2933-6.<br>
A sixth process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound according to this invention is a process wherein an intermediate having the formula (X)<br><br><br>
(X) wherein p1 p2, p3, Ar1 Ar2, X1, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined in formula (I), is reacted with a reactant having the formula (XI)<br><br>
(XI) wherein Z1f Za, X3, A and B are as defined in formula (I), one of Y6 and Y7 is selected from bromo, iodo and trifluoromethylsulfonate and the other of Y6 and Y7 is selected from tri(C1-4alkyl) tin, B(OH)2, alkylboronates and cyclic analogues thereof, in at least one reaction-inert solvent and optionally in the presence of at least one transition metal coupling reagent and/or at least one suitable ligand such as palladium associated with triphenylphosphine, triphenylarsine and the like, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. This type of reaction being known in the art as the Stille reaction or the Suzuki reaction, reference to the applicable transition metal coupling reagents and/or suitable ligands may be found for instance in Syn.Letters (1998)6,671 -5, in Chem.Rev.O 999)99(6)1549-1581 and in The Stille Reaction (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.) ISBN 0-471-31273-8.<br>
A seventh process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound according to this invention is a process wherein an intermediate having the formula (XII)<br><br><br>
wherein-Z1, Z2, X2, X3, p1, p2, Ar1, R1 R2, R3, A and B are as defined in formula (1) and Y8 is selected from bromo, iodo and trifluoromethylsulfonate, is reacted either with an aryl-boric acid having the formula (XIII a)<br><br>
(Xlll-a) wherein p3, Ar2 and R4are as defined in formula (I), or with an aryl-tin reactant having the formula (XIII b)<br><br>
(XIII-b) wherein R3, R4, Ar2 and p3 are as defined in formula (I), in at least one reaction-inert solvent and optionally in the presence of at least one transition metal coupling reagent and/or at least one suitable ligand,, the said process further optionally comprising converting a compound of formula (I) into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing or stereochemically isomeric forms thereof. This type of reaction being known in the art as the Stille reaction or the Suzuki reaction, reference to the applicable transition metal coupling reagents and/or suitable ligands may be found for instance in the literature cited above. Exemplary coupling reagents for this process are e.g. bis(triphenylphospine) dichloropaliadium and diacetylpalladium. Exemplary reaction-inert solvents for this reaction are 1,4-dioxane, toluene, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylether and the (ike.<br><br>
Furthermore, a process for preparing a polyarylcarboxamide compound of the formula (I) wherein B is NR6R7, from a polyarylcarboxamide compound of the formula (I) wherein B is OR5 is a process comprising in a first step hydroiyzing the latter and in a second step reacting the resulting corresponding carboxylic acid with an amine having the formula HNR6R7 in at least one reaction-inert solvent and further optionally comprising converting the resulting compound of formula (I) wherein B is NR6R7 into an addition salt thereof, and/or preparing siereochemically isomeric forms thereof. The hydrolysis first step is preferably effected in an acidic medium such as strongly concentrated hydrochloric acid and optionally in the presence of an organic solvent such as dioxane.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also conveniently be prepared using solid phase synthesis techniques. In general, solid phase synthesis involves reacting an intermediate in a synthesis with a polymer support. This polymer supported intermediate can then be carried on through a number of synthetic steps. After each step, impurities are removed by filtering the resin and washing it numerous times with various solvents. At each step the resin can be split up to react with various intermediates in the next step thus allowing for the synthesis of a large number of compounds. After the last step in the procedure the resin is treated with a reagent or process to cleave the resin from the sample. More detailed explanation of the techniques used in solid phase chemistry are described in for example "The Combinatorial Index" (B.Bunin, Academic Press) and Novabiochem's 1999 Catalogue &amp; Peptide Synthesis Handbook (Novabiochem AG, Switzerland) both incorporated herein by reference.<br>

which are useful as intermediates for the preparation of the polyarylcarboxamide compounds of the present invention. In turn, the present invention provides methods for preparing the above-mentioned families of intermediate compounds, such as disclosed in the foregoing examples.<br>
The polyarylcarboxamide compounds of formula (I), the Af-oxide forms, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomeric forms thereof possess<br><br>
favourable apolipoprotein B inhibiting activity and concomitant lipid lowering activity. Therefore the present compounds are useful as a medicine especially in a method of treating patients suffering from hyperlipldemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type II diabetes. In particular the present compounds may be used for the manufacture of a medicine for treating disorders caused by an excess of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL), and especially disorders caused by the cholesterol associated with said VLDL and LDL<br>
The causal relationship between hypercholesterolemia - particularly that associated with increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) - and premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease is well established. VLDL is secreted by the liver and contains apolipoprotein B (apo-B); these particles undergo degradation in the circulation to LDL, which transports about 60 to 70% of the total serum cholesterol. Apo-B is also the principal protein component of LDL. Increased LDL-cholesterol in serum, due to oversynthesis or decreased metabolism, is causally related to atherosclerosis. In contrast, high density lipoproteins (HDL) which contain apolipoprotein A1, have a protective effect and are inversely correlated with risk of coronary heart disease. The HDL/LDL ratio is thus a convenient method of assessing the atherogenic potential of an individual's plasma lipid profile.<br>
The principal mechanism of action of the compounds of formula (I) appears to involve inhibition of MTP (microsomial triglyceride transfer protein) activity in hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in decreased VLDL and chylomicron production, respectively. This is a novel and innovative approach to hyperlipidemia, and is expected to lower LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides through reduced hepatic production of VLDL and intestinal production of chylomicrons.<br>
A large number of genetic and acquired diseases can result in hyperlipidemia. They can be classified into primary and secondary hyperlipidemic states. The most common causes of the secondary hyperlipidemias are diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, drugs, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, nephrotic<br><br>
syndrome, cholestasis and bulimia. Primary hyperlipidemias are common hypercholesterolaemia, familial combined hyperlipidaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, remnant hyperlipidaemia, chylorriicronaernia syndrome, familial hypertriglyceridaemia. The present compounds may als_o be used to prevent or treat patientssufferifig from obesitas or from atherosclerosis, especially coronary atherosclerosis and more in general disorders which are related to atherosclerosis, such as ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular -disease, cerebral vascular disease. The present compounds may cause regression of atherosclerosis and inhibit the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis, particularly morbidity and mortality.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (f), it follows that the present invention also provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering from disorders caused by an excess of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL), and especially disorders caused by the cholesterol associated with said VLDL and LDL. Consequently a method of treatment is provided for relieving patients suffering from conditions, such as, for example, hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type II diabetes.<br>
Apo B-48, synthetized by the intestine, is necessary for the assembly of chylomicrons and therefore has an obligatory role in the intestinal absorption of dietary fats. The present invention provides polyarylcarboxamide compounds which are acting as selective MTP inhibitors at the level of the gut wall.<br>
Additionally the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a polyarylcarboxamide compound having the formula (I).<br>
In order to prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable,<br><br>
preferably, for oral administration, rectal administration, percutaneous administration or parenteral injection.<br>
For example in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual liquid pharmaceutical carriers may be employed, such as for instance water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid pharmaceutical carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their easy administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral injection compositions, the pharmaceutical carrier will mainly comprise sterile water, although other ingredients may be included in order to improve solubility of the active ingredient. Injectable solutions may be prepared for instance by using a pharmaceutical carrier comprising a saline solution, a glucose solution or a mixture of both. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared by using appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like. In compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the pharmaceutical carrier may optionally comprise a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with minor proportions of suitable additives which do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may be selected in order to facilitate administration of the active ingredient to the skin and/or be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These topical compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, a spot-on or an ointment. Addition salts of the compounds of formula (I), due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. "Dosage unit form" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills,<br><br>
powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present r invention may take the form of solid dose forms, for example, tablets (both swallowable and chewable forms), capsules or gelcaps, prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and the like), fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystaliine cellulose, calcium phosphate and the like), lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, silica and the like), disintegrating agents (e.g. potato starch, sodium starch glycollate and the like), wetting agents (e.g. sodium laurylsulphate) and the like. Such tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of e.g. solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be formulated as a dry product for admixture with water and/or another suitable liquid carrier before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means, optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or hydrogenated edible fats), emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia), non-aqueous carriers (e.g. almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol), sweeteners, flavours, masking agents and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners useful in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise preferably at least one intense sweetener such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sodium cyclamate, alitame, a dihydrochalcone sweetener, monellin, stevioside sucralose (4,1',6'-trichloro^.l'.S'-trideoxygalactosucrose) or, preferably, saccharin, sodium or calcium saccharin, and optionally at least one bulk sweetener such as sorbitol, mannitol, fructose, sucrose, maltose, isomalt, glucose, hydrogenated glucose syrup, xylitol, caramel or honey. Intense sweeteners are conveniently used in low concentrations. For example, in the case of sodium saccharin, the said concentration may range from about 0.04% to 0.1% (weight/volume) of the final formulation. The bulk sweetener can effectively be used in larger<br><br>
concentrations ranging from about 10% to about 35%, preferably from about 10% to 15% (weight/volume).<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable flavours which can mask the bitter tasting ingredients in the low-dosage formulations are preferably fruit flavours such as cherry, raspberry, black currant or strawberry flavour. A combination of two flavours may yield very good results. In the high-dosage formulations, stronger pharmaceutically acceptable flavours may be required such as Caramel Chocolate, Mint Cool, Fantasy and the like. Each flavour may be present in the final composition in a concentration ranging from about 0.05% to 1% (weight/volume). Combinations of said strong flavours are advantageously used. Preferably a flavour is used that does not undergo any change or loss of taste and/or color under the circumstances of the formulation.<br>
The polyarylcarboxamide compounds of this invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, conveniently intravenous, intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection, for example by bolus injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in ampoules or multi-dose containers, including an added preservative.

Those of skill in the treatment of hyperlipidemia will easily determine the therapeutically effective amount of a polyarylcarboxamide compound of this invention from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective dose will be from about 0.001<br><br>
mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg of body weight, more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of body weight of the patient to be treated. It may be appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose in the form of two or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example each containing from about 0.1 mg to about 350 mg, more particularly from about 1 to about 200 mg, of the active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular polyarylcarboxamide compound of formula (J) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as the other medication (including the above-mentioned additional lipid-lowering agents), the patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated patient and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the polyarylcarboxamide compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.<br>

C.2. MTP assay<br>
MTP activity was measured using an assay similar to one described by J.R. Wetterau and D.B. Ziiversmit in Chemistry and Physics of Lipids (1985) 38, y" 205-222. In order to prepare the donor and acceptor vesicles, the appropriate lipids in chloroform were put into a glass test tube and dried under a stream of<br><br>
nitrogen. A buffer containing 1.5 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid, 40 mM NaCI, 0.02 % NaN3 (assay buffer) was added to the dried lipid. The mixture was vortexedbriefly and the lipids were then allowed to hydrate for 20 minutes on ice. Vesicles were then prepared by bath sonication (using a Branson 2200 device) at room temperature for at most 15 minutes. Butylated hydroxytoluene was included in all vesicle preparations at a concentration of 0.1%. The lipid transfer assay mixture contained donor vesicles (40 nmole phosphatidylcholine, 7,5 mole % cardiolipin and 0.25 mole % glycerol tri [1-14C]-oleate), acceptor vesicles (240 nmol phosphatidylcholine) and 5 mg bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 675 //I in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Test compounds were added dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (0.13 % final concentration). After 5 minutes of pre-incubation at 37Â°C, the reaction was started by the addition of MTP in 100//I of a dialysis buffer. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 JJ\ diethylaminoalkyl (DEAE)-52 cellulose (Sephadex) pre-equilibrated in 15 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and 0.02% NaN3 (1:1 volume/volume). The mixture was agitated for 4 minutes and centrifuge'd for 2 minutes at maximum speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge (4Â°C) to pellet the DEAE-52-bound donor vesicles. An aliquot of the supernatant containing the acceptor liposomes was counted and the [14C]rCounts were used to calculate the percent triglyceride transfer from donor to acceptor vesicles. Resulting IC50 values are enumerated in Table C.2 for some of the above-referred compounds.<br>
