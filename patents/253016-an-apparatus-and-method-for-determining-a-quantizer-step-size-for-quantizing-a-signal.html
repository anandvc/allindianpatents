				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to audio coders, and, in particular, to audio coders<br>
which are transformation-based, i.e. wherein a conversion of a temporal<br>
representation into a spectral representation is performed at the beginning of the<br>
coder pipeline.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A transformation-based prior art audio coder is depicted in figure 3. The coder<br>
shown in figure 3 is represented in the international standard ISO/IEC 14496-3:<br>
2001 (E), subpart 4, page 4, and is also known as AAC coder in the art.<br>
The prior art coder will be presented below. An audio signal to be coded is<br>
supplied in at an input 1000. This audio signal is initially fed to a scaling stage<br>
1002, wherein so-called AAC gain control is conducted to establish the level of<br>
the audio signal. Side information from the scaling are supplied to a bit stream<br>
formatter 1004, as is represented by the arrow located between block 1002 and<br>
block 1004. The scaled audio signal is then supplied to an MDCT filter bank<br>
1006. With the AAC coder, the filter bank implements a modified discrete cosine<br>
transformation with 50oo overlapping windows, the window length being<br>
determined by a block 1008.<br>
Generally speaking, block 1008 is present for the purpose of windowing transient<br>
signals with relatively short windows, and of windowing signals which tend to be<br>
stationary with relatively long windows. This serves to reach a higher level of<br>
time resolution (at the expense of frequency resolution) for transient signals due<br>
to the relatively short windows, whereas for signals which tend to be stationary,<br>
a higher frequency resolution (at the expense of time resolution) is achieved due<br>
to longer<br><br>
windows, there being a tendency of preferring longer<br>
windows since they result in a higher coding gain. At the<br>
output of filter bank 1006, blocks of spectral values - the<br>
blocks being successive in time - are present which may be<br>
MDCT coefficients, Fourier coefficients or subband signals,<br>
depending on the implementation of the filter bank, each<br>
subband signal having a specific limited bandwidth<br>
specified by the respective subband channel in filter bank<br>
1006, and each subband signal having a specific number of<br>
subband samples.<br>
What follows is a presentation, by way of example, of the<br>
case wherein the filter bank outputs temporally successive<br>
blocks of MDCT spectral coefficients which, generally<br>
speaking, represent successive short-term spectra of the<br>
audio signal to be coded at input 1000. A block of MDCT<br>
spectral values is then fed into a TNS processing block<br>
1010 (TNS = temporary noise shaping), wherein temporal<br>
noise shaping is performed. The TNS technique is used to<br>
shape the temporal form of the quantization noise within<br>
each window of the transformation. This is achieved by<br>
applying a filtering process to parts of the spectral data<br>
of each channel. Coding is performed on a window basis. In<br>
particular, the following steps are performed to apply the<br>
TNS tool to a window of spectral data, i.e. to a block of<br>
spectral values.<br>
Initially, a frequency range for the TNS tool is selected.<br>
A suitable selection comprises covering a frequency range<br>
of 1.5 kHz with a filter, up to the highest possible scale<br>
factor band. It shall be pointed out that this frequency<br>
range depends on the sampling rate, as is specified in the<br>
AAC standard (ISO/IEC 1449.6-3: 2001 (E)).<br>
Subsequently, an LPC calculation (LPC = linear predictive<br>
coding) is performed, to be precise using the spectral MDCT<br>
coefficients present in the selected target frequency<br>
range. For increased stability, coefficients which<br><br>
correspond to frequencies below 2.5 kHz are excluded from<br>
this process. Common LPC procedures as are known from<br>
speech processing may be used for LPC calculation, for<br>
example the known Levinson-Durbin algorithm. The<br>
calculation is performed for the maximally admissible order<br>
of the noise shaping filter.<br>
As a result of the LPC calculation, the expected prediction<br>
gain PG is obtained. In addition, the reflection<br>
coefficients, or Parcor coefficients, are obtained.<br>
If the prediction gain does not exceed a specific<br>
threshold, the TNS tool is not applied. In this case, a<br>
piece of control information is written into the bit stream<br>
so that a decoder knows that no TNS processing has been<br>
performed.<br>
However, if the prediction gain exceeds a threshold, TNS<br>
processing is applied.<br>
In a next step, the reflection coefficients are quantized.<br>
The order of the noise shaping filter used is determined by<br>
removing all reflection coefficients having an absolute<br>
value smaller than a threshold from the "tail" of the array<br>
of reflection coefficients. The number of remaining<br>
reflection coefficients is in the order of magnitude of the<br>
noise shaping filter. A suitable threshold is 0.1.<br>
The remaining reflection coefficients are typically<br>
converted into linear prediction coefficients, this<br>
technique also being known as "step-up" procedure.<br>
The LPC coefficients calculated are then used as coder<br>
noise shaping filter coefficients, i.e. as prediction<br>
filter coefficients. This FIR filter is used for filtering<br>
in the specified target frequency range. An autoregressive<br>
filter is used in decoding, whereas a so-called moving<br>
average filter is used in coding. Eventually, the side<br><br>
information for the TNS tool are supplied to the bit stream<br>
formatter, as is represented by the arrow shown between the<br>
TNS processing block 1010 and the bit stream formatter 1004<br>
in Fig. 3.<br>
Then, several optional tools which are not shown in Fig. 3<br>
are passed through, such as a long-term prediction tool, an<br>
intensity/coupling tool, a prediction tool, a noise<br>
substitution tool, until eventually a mid/side coder 1012<br>
is arrived at. The mid/side coder 1012 is active when the<br>
audio signal to be coded is a multi-channel signal, i.e. a<br>
stereo signal having a left-hand channel and a right-hand<br>
channel. Up to now, i.e. upstream from block 1012 in Fig.<br>
3, the left-hand and right-hand stereo channels have been<br>
processed, i.e. scaled, transformed by the filter bank,<br>
subjected to TNS processing or not, etc., separately from<br>
one another.<br>
In the mid/side coder, verification is initially performed<br>
as to whether a mid/side coding makes sense, i.e. will<br>
yield a coding gain at all. Mid/side coding will yield a<br>
coding gain if the left-hand and right-hand channels tend<br>
to be similar, since in this case, the mid channel, i.e.<br>
the sum of the left-hand and the right-hand channels, is<br>
almost equal to the left-hand channel or the right-hand<br>
channel, apart from scaling by a factor of 1/2, whereas the<br>
side channel has only very small values since it is equal<br>
to the difference between the left-hand and the right-hand<br>
channels. As a consequence, one can see that when the left-<br>
hand and right-hand channels are approximately the same,<br>
the difference is approximately zero, or includes only very<br>
small values which - this is the hope - will be quantized<br>
to zero in a subsequent quantizer 1014, and thus may be<br>
transmitted in a very efficient manner since an entropy<br>
coder 1016 is connected downstream from quantizer 1014.<br>
Quantizer 1014 is supplied an admissible interference per<br>
scale factor band by a psycho-acoustic model 1020. The<br><br>
quantizer operates in an iterative manner, i.e. an outer<br>
iteration loop is initially called up, which will then call<br>
up an inner iteration loop. Generally speaking, starting<br>
from quantizer step-size starting values, a quantization of<br>
a block of values is initially performed at the input of<br>
quantizer 1014. In particular, the inner loop quantizes the<br>
MDCT coefficients, a specific number of bits being consumed<br>
in the process. The outer loop calculates the distortion<br>
and modified energy of the coefficients using the scale<br>
factor so as to again call up an inner loop. This process<br>
is iterated for such time until a specific conditional<br>
clause is met. For each iteration in the outer iteration<br>
loop, the signal is reconstructed so as to calculate the<br>
interference introduced by the quantization, and to compare<br>
it with the permitted interference supplied by the psycho-<br>
acoustic model 1020. In addition, the scale factors of<br>
those frequency bands which after this comparison still are<br>
considered to be interfered with are enlarged by one or<br>
more stages from iteration to iteration, to be precise for<br>
each iteration of the outer iteration loop.<br>
Once a situation is reached wherein the quantization<br>
interference introduced by the quantization is below the<br>
permitted interference determined by the psycho-acoustic<br>
model, and if at the same time bit requirements are met,<br>
which state, to be precise, that a maximum bit rate be not<br>
exceeded, the iteration, i.e. the analysis-by-synthesis<br>
method, is terminated, and the scale factors obtained are<br>
coded as is illustrated in block 1014, and are supplied, in<br>
coded form, to bit stream formatter 1004 as is marked by<br>
the arrow which is drawn between block 1014 and block 1004.<br>
The quantized values are then supplied to entropy coder<br>
1016, which typically performs entropy coding for various<br>
scale factor bands using several Huffman-code tables, so as<br>
to translate the quantized values into a binary format. As<br>
is known, entropy coding in the form of Huffman coding<br>
involves falling back on code tables which are created on<br>
the basis of expected signal statistics, and wherein<br><br>
Frequently occurring values are given shorter code words than less frequently<br>
occurring values. The entropy-coded values are then supplied, as actual main<br>
information, to bit stream formatter 1004, which then outputs the coded audio<br>
signal at the output side in accordance with a specific bit stream syntax.<br>
As has already been illustrated, a finer quantizer step size is used in this iterative<br>
quantization in the event that the interference introduced by a quantizer step<br>
size is larger than the threshold, this being done in the hope that this leads to a<br>
reduction of the quantization noise because the quantization performed is finer.<br>
This concept is disadvantageous in that due to the finer quantizer step size, the<br>
amount of data to be transmitted naturally increases, and thus, the compression<br>
gain decreases.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a concept for determining a<br>
quantizer step size which, on the one hand, introduces low quantization<br>
interference, and provides, on the other hand, a high compression gain.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus quantizer step size and a method of<br>
determining a quantizer step size according to the features of the invention.<br>
The present invention is based on the findings that an additional reduction in the<br>
interference power, on the one hand, and at the same time an increase or at<br>
least preservation of the coding gain may be achieved in that at least several<br>
coarser quantizer step sizes are tried out even when the interference introduced<br>
is larger than a threshold, rather than performing finer quantization, as has been<br>
done in the prior art. It turned out that even<br><br>
with coarser quantizer step sizes, reductions in the<br>
interference introduced by the quantization may be<br>
achieved, to be precise in those cases when the coarser<br>
quantizer step size "hits" the value to be quantized better<br>
than does the finer quantizer step size. This effect is<br>
based on the fact that the quantization error depends not<br>
only on the quantizer step size, but naturally also on the<br>
values to be quantized. If the values to be quantized are<br>
in close proximity to the step sizes of the coarser<br>
quantizer step size, a reduction in the quantization noise<br>
will be achieved while increasing the compression gain<br>
(since quantization has been coarser).<br>
The inventive concept is very profitable particularly when<br>
very good estimated quantizer step sizes are present<br>
already for the first quantizer step size, on the basis of<br>
which the threshold comparison is performed. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, it is therefore<br>
preferred to determine the first quantizer step size by<br>
means of a direct calculation on the basis of the mean<br>
noise energy rather than on the basis of a worst-case<br>
scenario. Thus, the iteration loops in accordance with the<br>
prior art may already be considerably reduced or may become<br>
completely obsolete.<br>
The inventive post-processing of the quantizer step size<br>
will then try out, once again only, a still coarser<br>
quantizer step size in the embodiment, so as to benefit<br>
from the described effect of "improved hitting" of a value<br>
to be quantized. If it turns out, subsequently, that the<br>
interference obtained by the coarser quantizer step size is<br>
smaller than the previous interference or even smaller than<br>
the threshold, more iterations may be performed to try out<br>
an even coarser quantizer step size. This procedure of<br>
coarsening the quantizer step size is continued for such<br>
time until the interference introduced increases again.<br>
Then, a termination criterion is reached, so that<br>
quantization is performed with that stored quantizer step<br><br>
size which has provided the smallest interference<br>
introduced, and so that the coding procedure is continued<br>
as required.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, for<br>
estimating the first quantizer step size, an analysis-by-<br>
synthesis approach as in the prior art may be performed<br>
which is continued for such time until a termination<br>
criterion is reach there. Then, the inventive post-<br>
processing may be employed to eventually verify whether or<br>
not it might be possible to achieve equally good<br>
interference results or even better interference results<br>
with a coarser quantizer step size. If one finds that a<br>
coarser quantizer step size is equally good or even better<br>
with regard to the interference introduced, this step size<br>
will be used for quantizing. If one finds, however, that<br>
the coarser quantization yields no positive effect, one<br>
will use, for eventual quantizing, that quantizer step size<br>
which was originally determined, for example by means of an<br>
analysis/synthesis method.<br>
In accordance with the invention, any quantizer step sizes<br>
may thus be employed to perform a first threshold<br>
comparison. It is irrelevant whether this first quantizer<br>
step size has already been determined by analysis/synthesis<br>
schemes or even by means of direct calculation of the<br>
quantizer step sizes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, this<br>
concept is employed for quantizing an audio signal present<br>
in the frequency range. However, this concept may also be<br>
employed for quantizing a time domain signal comprising<br>
audio and/or video information.<br>
In addition, it shall be pointed out that the threshold<br>
used for comparing is a psycho-acoustic or psycho-optical<br>
permitted interference, or another threshold which is<br>
desired to be fallen below. For example, this threshold may<br><br>
actually be a permitted interference provided by a psycho-<br>
acoustic model. This threshold, however, may also be a<br>
previously-determined introduced interference for the<br>
original quantizer step size, or any other threshold.<br>
It shall be noted that the quantized values need not<br>
necessarily be Huffman-coded, but that they may<br>
alternatively be coded using another entropy coding, such<br>
as an arithmetic coding. Alternatively, the quantized<br>
values may also be coded in a binary manner, since this<br>
coding, too, has the effect that for transmitting smaller<br>
values or values equaling zero, fewer bits are required<br>
than are required for transmitting larger values or,<br>
generally, values not equaling zero.<br>
For determining the starting values, i.e. the 1 quantizer<br>
step size, the iterative approach may preferably be fully<br>
or at least largely dispensed with if the quantizer step<br>
size is determined from a direct noise energy estimation.<br>
Calculating the quantizer step size from an exact noise<br>
energy estimate is considerably faster than calculating in<br>
an analysis-by-synthesis loop, since the values for the<br>
calculation are directly present. It is not necessary to<br>
first perform and compare several quantization attempts<br>
until a quantizer step size which is favorable for coding<br>
is found.<br>
Since, however, the quantizer characteristic curve used, is<br>
a non-linear characteristic curve, the non-linear<br>
characteristic curve must be taken into account in the<br>
noise energy estimation. It is no longer possible to use<br>
the simple noise energy estimation for a linear quantizer,<br>
since it is not accurate enough. In accordance with the<br>
invention, a quantizer is used which has the following<br>
quantization characteristic curve:<br><br><br>
In the above equation, Xi are the spectral values to be<br>
quantized. The starting values are characterized by yi, yi<br>
thus being the quantized spectral values. q is the<br>
quantizer step size. Round is the rounding function, which<br>
is preferably the nint function, "nint" standing for<br>
"nearest integer". The exponent which makes the quantizer a<br>
non-linear quantizer is referred to by α, α being different<br>
from 1. Typically, the exponent α will be smaller than 1,<br>
so that the quantizer has a compressing characteristic.<br>
With layer 3, and with AAC, the exponent a equals 0.75. The<br>
parameter s is an additive constant which may have any<br>
value, but which may also be zero.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the following connection<br>
is used for calculating the quantizer step size.<br><br>
With a equaling ¾, the following equation results:<br><br>
In these equations, the left-hand term stands for the<br>
interference THR which is permitted in a frequency band and<br>
which is provided by a psycho-acoustic module for a scale<br>
factor band with the frequency lines of i equaling i1 to i<br>
equaling i2. The above equation enables an almost exact<br>
estimation of the interference introduced by a quantizer<br>
step size q for a non-linear quantizer having the above<br>
quantizer characteristic curve with the exponent a<br>
different from 1, wherein the function nint from the<br>
quantizer equation performs the actual quantizer equation,<br>
which is rounding to the next integer.<br>
It shall be noted that instead of function nint, any<br>
rounding function round desired may be used, specifically,<br>
for example, also rounding to the next even or the next odd<br><br>
integer, or rounding to the next number of 10, etc.<br>
Generally speaking, the rounding function is responsible<br>
for mapping a value from a set of values having a specific<br>
number of permitted values to a set of values having a<br>
smaller specific second number of values.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
quantized spectral values have previously been subjected to<br>
TNS processing, and, if what is dealt with are, for<br>
example, stereo signals, to mid/side coding, provided that<br>
the channels were such that the mid/side coder was<br>
activated.<br>
Thus, the scale factor for each scale factor band may be<br>
indicated directly and may be fed into a respective audio<br>
coder with the connection between the quantizer step size<br>
and the scale factor, which is given in accordance with the<br>
following equation<br><br>
The scale factor results from the following equation.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, use may<br>
also be made of a post-processing iteration based on an<br>
analysis-by-synthesis principle, so as to slightly vary the<br>
quantizer step size, which has been calculated directly<br>
without iteration, for each scale factor band so as to<br>
achieve the actual optimum.<br>
Compared to the prior art, however, the already very<br>
precise calculation of the starting values enables a very<br>
short iteration, although it has turned out that in the<br><br>
vast majority of cases, the downstream iteration may be<br>
fully dispensed with.<br>
The preferred concept based on calculating the step size<br>
using the mean noise energy thus provides a good and<br>
realistic estimation since unlike the prior art, it does<br>
not operate with a worst-case scenario, but uses an<br>
expected value of the quantization error as a basis and<br>
thus enables, with subjectively equivalent quality, more<br>
efficient coding of the data with a considerably reduced<br>
bit count. In addition, a considerably faster coder may be<br>
achieved due to the fact that the iteration may be fully<br>
dispensed with and/or that the number of iteration steps<br>
may be clearly reduced. This is remarkable, in particular,<br>
because the iteration loops in the prior art coder have<br>
been essential for the overall time requirement of the<br>
coder. Thus, even a reduction by one or fewer iteration<br>
steps leads to a considerable overall time saving of the<br>
coder.<br>

step size for quantizing a signal comprising audio or video<br>
information and being provided via a signal input 500. The<br>

quantizer step size (QSS) and for providing an interference<br>
threshold which will also be referred to as introducible<br>
interference below. It shall be noted that the interference<br>
threshold may be any threshold. Preferably, however, it<br>
will be a psycho-acoustic or psycho-optically introducible<br>
interference, this threshold being selected such that a<br>
signal into which the interference has been introduced will<br>
still be perceived as not-interfered-with by human<br>
listeners or viewers.<br>
The threshold (THR) as well as the first quantizer step<br>
size are supplied to a means 504 for determining the actual<br>
first interference introduced by the first quantizer step<br>
size. Determining the actually introduced interference is<br>
preferably conducted by quantizing using the first<br>
quantizer step size, by re-quantizing using the first<br>
quantizer step size, and by calculating the distance<br>
between the original signal and the re-quantized signal.<br>
Preferably, when spectral values are being processed,<br>
corresponding spectral values of the original signal and of<br>
the re-quantized signal are squared so as to then determine<br>
the difference of the squares. Alternative methods of<br>
determining the distance may be employed.<br>
Means 504 provides a value for a first interference<br>
actually introduced by the first quantizer step size. This<br>
first interference is supplied, along with threshold THR,<br>
to a means 506 for comparing. Means 506 performs a<br><br>
comparison between threshold THR and the first interference<br>
actually introduced. If the first interference actually<br>
introduced is larger than the threshold, means 506 will<br>
activate a means 508 for selecting a second quantizer step<br>
size, means 508 being configured to select the. second<br>
quantizer step size to be coarser, i.e. larger, than the<br>
first quantizer step size. The second quantizer step size<br>
selected by means 508 is supplied to a means 510 for<br>
determining the second interference actually introduced. To<br>
this end, means 510 obtains the original signal as well as<br>
the second quantizer step size and again performs a<br>
quantization using the second quantizer step size, a re-<br>
quantization using the second quantizer step size, and a<br>
distance calculation between the re-quantized signal and<br>
the original signal, so as to supply a means 512 for<br>
comparing with a measure of the second interference<br>
actually introduced. Means 512 for comparing compares the<br>
second interference actually introduced with the first<br>
interference actually introduced or with threshold THR. If<br>
the second interference actually introduced is smaller than<br>
the first interference actually introduced or even smaller<br>
than the threshold THR, the second quantizer step size will<br>
be used for quantizing the signal.<br>
It shall be noted that the concept depicted in Fig. 5 is<br>
only schematic. Naturally, it is not absolutely necessary<br>
to provide separate comparison means for performing the<br>
comparisons in blocks 506 and 512, but it is also possible<br>
to provide one single comparison means which is controlled<br>
accordingly. The same applies to means 504 and 510 for<br>
determining the interferences actually introduced. They,<br>
too, need not necessarily be configured as separate means.<br>
In addition, it shall be noted that the means for<br>
quantizing need not necessarily be configured as a means<br>
which is separate from means 510. To be precise, the<br>
signals with are quantized by the second quantizer step<br>
size are typically generated as early as in means 510 when<br><br>
means 510 performs a quantization and re-quantization to<br>
determine the interference actually introduced. The<br>
quantized values obtained there may also be stored and<br>
output as a quantized signal when means 512 for comparing<br>
provides a positive result, so that means 514 for<br>
quantizing "merges", as it were, with means 510 for<br>
determining the second interference actually introduced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
threshold THR is the maximally introducible interference<br>
determined by way of psychoacoustics, the signal being an<br>
audio signal in this case. Threshold THR here is provided<br>
by a psycho-acoustic model which operates in a conventional<br>
manner and provides, for each scale factor band, an<br>
estimated maximum quantization interference introducible<br>
into this scale factor band. The maximally introducible<br>
interference is based on the masking threshold in that it<br>
is identical with the masking threshold or is derived from<br>
the masking threshold, in the sense that, for example,<br>
coding with a safe spacing is performed such that the<br>
introducible interference is smaller than the masking<br>
threshold, or that a rather offensive coding in the sense<br>
of a bit rate reduction is performed, specifically in the<br>
sense that the permitted interference exceeds the masking<br>
threshold.<br>
A preferred manner of implementing means 502 for providing<br>
the first quantizer step size will be presented below with<br>
reference to Fig. 1. In this respect, the functionalities<br>
of means 50 of Fig. 2 and of means 502 of Fig. 5 are the<br>
same. Preferably, means 502 is configured to have the<br>
functionalities of means 10 and of means 12 of Fig. 1. In<br>
addition, quantizer 514 in Fig. 5 is configured to be<br>
identical with quantizer 14 in Fig. 1 in this example.<br>
Furthermore, a complete procedure which, if the<br>
interference introduced exceeds the threshold, will also<br><br>
attempt coarser quantizer step sizes will be presented<br>
below with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
In addition, the left-hand branch in Fig. 2, depicting the<br>
inventive concept, is extended in that in the event that<br>
the interference introduced exceeds the threshold and that<br>
the coarsening of the quantizer step size does not yield<br>
any effect, and if bit rate requirements are not<br>
particularly strict and/or if there is still some space in<br>
the "bit savings bank", an iteration is performed using a<br>
smaller, i.e. finer quantizer step size.<br>
Eventually, the effect on which the present invention is<br>
based will be presented below with reference to Fig. 4,<br>
specifically the effect that despite a coarsening of the<br>
quantizer step size, a reduced quantization noise and,<br>
associated therewith, an increase in the compression gain<br>
may be obtained.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus for determining a quantized audio<br>
signal which is given as a spectral representation in the<br>
form of spectral values. It shall be noted, in particular,<br>
that in the event that - with reference to Fig. 3 - no TNS<br>
-processing and no mid/side coding has been performed, the<br>
spectral values are directly the starting values of the<br>
filter bank. If, however, only TNS processing, but no<br>
mid/side coding is performed, the spectral values fed into<br>
quantizer 1015 are spectral residual values as are formed<br>
from TNS prediction filtering.<br>
If TNS processing including a mid/side coding is employed,<br>
the spectral values fed into the inventive apparatus are<br>
spectral values of a mid channel, or spectral values of a<br>
sxde channel.<br>
To start with, the present invention includes a means for<br>
providing a permitted interference, indicated by 10 in Fig.<br>
1. The psycho-acoustic model 1020 shown in Fig. 3 which<br><br>
typically is configured to provide a permitted interference<br>
or threshold, also referred to as THR, for each scale<br>
factor band, i.e. for a group of several spectral values<br>
which are spectrally adjacent to one another, may serve as<br>
the means for providing a permitted interference. The<br>
permitted interference is based on the psycho-acoustic<br>
masking threshold and indicates the amount of energy that<br>
may be introduced into an original audio signal without the<br>
interference energy being perceived by the human ear. In<br>
other words, the permitted interference is the signal<br>
portion artificially introduced (by the quantization) which<br>
is masked by the actual audio signal.<br>
Means 10 is depicted to calculate the permitted<br>
interference THR for a frequency band, preferably a scale<br>
factor band, and to supply this to a downstream means 12.<br>
Means 12 serves to calculate a piece of quantizer step size<br>
information for the frequency band for which the permitted<br>
interference THR has been indicated. Means 12 is configured<br>
to supply the piece of quantizer step size information q to<br>
a downstream means 14 for quantizing. Means 14 for<br>
quantizing operates in accordance with the quantization<br>
specification drawn in block 14, the quantizer step size<br>
information being used, in the case shown in Fig. 1, to<br>
initially divide a spectral value Xi by the value of q, and<br>
to then exponentiate the result with the exponent a unequal<br>
to 1, and to then add an additive factor s, as the case may<br>
be.<br>
Subsequently, this result is supplied to a rounding<br>
function which, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, selects<br>
the next integer. In accordance with the definition, the<br>
integer may be generated again by cutting off digits behind<br>
the decimal point, i.e. by "always rounding down".<br>
Alternatively, the next integer may also be generated by<br>
rounding down to 0.4 99 and by rounding up from 0.5. As<br>
another alternative, the next integer may be determined by<br>
"always rounding up", depending on the individual<br><br>
implementation. However, instead of the nint function, any<br>
other rounding function may be employed which, generally<br>
speaking, maps a value, which is to be rounded, from a<br>
first, larger set of values into a second, smaller set of<br>
values.<br>
The quantized spectral value will then be present in the<br>
frequency band at the output of means 14. As may be seen<br>
from the equation depicted in block 14, means 14 will<br>
naturally also be supplied, beside the quantizer step size<br>
q, with the spectral value to be quantized in the frequency<br>
band contemplated.<br>
It shall be noted that means 12 need not necessarily<br>
directly calculate quantizer step size q, but that as<br>
alternative quantizer step size information, the scale<br>
factor as is used in prior-art transformation-based audio<br>
coders may also be calculated. The scale factor is linked<br>
to the actual quantizer step size via the relation depicted<br>
to the right of block 12 in Fig. 1. If the means for<br>
calculating is further configured to calculate, as<br>
quantizer step size information, scale factor scf, this<br>
scale factor will be supplied to means 14 for quantizing,<br>
which means will then use, in block 14, the value of 21/4 scf<br>
for the quantization calculation instead of value q.<br>
A derivation of the form given in block 12 will be given<br>
below.<br>
As has been set forth, the exponential-law quantizer as is<br>
depicted in block 14 obeys the following relation:<br><br>
The inverse operation will be presented as follows:<br><br><br>
This equation thus represents the operation required for<br>
re-quantization, wherein yi is a quantized spectral value,<br>
and wherein Xi is a re-quantized spectral value. Again, q<br>
is the quantizer step size which is associated with the<br>
scale factor via the relation shown in Fig. 1 to the right<br>
of block 12.<br>
As has been expected, in the event that a equals 1, the<br>
result is consistent with this equation.<br>
If the above equation is summed up over a vector of the<br>
spectral values, the total noise power in a band determined<br>
by index i is given as follows:<br><br>
In summary, the expected value of the quantization noise of<br>
a vector is determined by the quantizer step size q and a<br>
so-called form factor describing the distribution of<br>
amounts of the components of the vector.<br>
The form factor, which is the far-right term in the above<br>
equation, depends on the actual input values and need only<br>
be calculated once, even if the above equation is<br>
calculated for interference levels THR desired to differing<br>
degrees.<br>
As has already been set forth, this equation with α<br>
equaling ¾ is simplified as follows:<br><br>
The left-hand side of this equation is thus an estimate of<br>
the quantization noise energy which, in a borderline case,<br>
conforms with the permitted noise energy (threshold).<br><br>
Thus, the following approach will be made:<br><br>
The sum across the roots of the frequency lines in the<br>
right-hand part of the equation corresponds to a measure of<br>
the uniformity of the frequency lines and is known as the<br>
form factor preferably as early as in the encoder:<br><br>
Thus, the following results:<br><br>
q here corresponds to the quantizer step size. With AAC, it<br>
is specified as:<br><br>
scf is the scale factor. If the scale factor is to be<br>
determined, the equation may be calculated as follows on<br>
the basis of the relation between the step size and the<br>
scale factor:<br><br><br><br>
The present invention thus provides a closed connection<br>
between the scale factors scf for a scale factor band which<br>
has a specific form factor and for which a specific<br>
interference threshold THR, which typically originates from<br>
the psycho-acoustic model, is given.<br>
As has already been set forth, calculating the step size<br>
using the mean noise energy provides a better estimate,<br>
since the basis used is the expected value of the<br>
quantization error rather than a worst-case scenario.<br>
Thus, the inventive concept is suitable for determining the<br>
quantizer step size and/or, in equivalence thereto, of the<br>
scale factor for a scale factor band without any<br>
iterations.<br>
Nevertheless, post-processing as will be represented below<br>
by means of Fig. 2 can also be performed if the calculating<br>
time requirements are not very strict. In a first step in<br>
Fig. 2, the first quantizer step size is estimated (step<br>
50). Estimating the first quantizer step size (QSS) is<br>
performed using the procedure depicted by means of Fig. 1.<br>
Subsequently, a quantization using the first quantizer step<br>
size is performed in a step 52, preferably in accordance<br>
with the quantizer as is depicted using block 14 in Fig. 1.<br>
Subsequently, the values obtained with the first quantizer<br>
step size are re-quantized so as to then calculate the<br>
interference introduced. Thereupon, verification is made in<br>
a step 54 as to whether the interference introduced exceeds<br>
the predefined threshold.<br>
It shall be pointed out that the quantizer step size q (or<br>
scf) which has been calculated by the connection<br><br>
represented in block 12 is an approximation. If the<br>
connection given in block 12 of Fig. 1 were actually exact,<br>
it should be established, in block 54, that the<br>
interference introduced exactly corresponds to the<br>
threshold. Due to the approximation nature of the<br>
connection in block 12 of Fig. 1, however, the interference<br>
introduced may exceed of fall below threshold THR.<br>
In addition, it shall be noted that the deviation from the<br>
threshold will not be particularly large, even though it<br>
will nevertheless be present. If one finds, in step 54,<br>
that using the first quantizer step size, the interference<br>
introduced falls below the threshold, i.e. if the question<br>
in step 54 is answered in the negative, the right-hand<br>
branch in Fig. 3 will be taken. If the interference<br>
introduced falls below the threshold, this means that the<br>
estimate in block 12. in Fig. 1 was too pessimistic, so that<br>
in a step 56, a quantizer step size coarser than the second<br>
quantizer step size is set.<br>
The degree to which the second quantizer step size is<br>
coarser, in comparison, than the first quantizer step size,<br>
may be selected. However, it is preferred to take<br>
relatively small increments, since the estimate in block 50<br>
will already be relatively exact.<br>
Using the second coarser (larger) quantizer step size, a<br>
quantization of the spectral values, a subsequent re-<br>
quantization and a calculation of the second interference<br>
corresponding to the second quantizer step size are<br>
performed in a step 58.<br>
In a step (60), verification is then made as to whether the<br>
second interference, which corresponds to the second<br>
quantizer step size, still falls below the original<br>
threshold. If this is so, the second quantizer step size is<br>
stored (62), and a new iteration is started so as to set an<br>
even coarser quantizer step size in a step (56). Then, step<br><br>
60 and, as the case may be, step 62 is again performed<br>
using the even coarser quantizer step size so as to again<br>
start a new iteration. If one finds, during an iteration in<br>
step 60, that the second interference does not fall below<br>
the threshold, i.e. exceeds the threshold, a termination<br>
criterion has been reached, and upon reaching the<br>
termination criterion, quantization is performed (64) using<br>
the quantizer step size that has been stored last.<br>
Since the first estimated quantizer step size already was a<br>
relatively good value, the number of iterations as compared<br>
with poorly estimated starting values will be reduced,<br>
which will lead to significant savings in calculation time<br>
when coding, since the iterations for calculating the<br>
quantizer step size take up the largest proportion of<br>
calculating time of the coder.<br>
An inventive procedure which is used when the interference<br>
introduced actually exceeds the threshold will be<br>
represented below with reference to the left-hand branch in<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
Despite the fact that the interference introduced already<br>
exceeds the threshold, an even coarser second quantizer<br>
step size is set in accordance with the invention (70), a<br>
quantization, re-quantization and calculation of the second<br>
noise interference which corresponds to the second<br>
quantizer step size then being performed in a step 72.<br>
Thereafter, verification is made in a step 74 as to whether<br>
the second noise interference now falls below the<br>
threshold. If this is so, the question in step 74 is<br>
answered with "yes", and the second quantizer step size is<br>
stored (76). If, however, one finds that the second noise<br>
interference exceeds the threshold, either a quantization<br>
is performed using the stored quantizer step size, or, if<br>
no better second quantizer step size has been stored, an<br>
iteration is passed through, wherein, like in the prior<br><br>
art, a finer second quantizer step size is selected to<br>
"push" the interference introduced below the threshold.<br>
What will follow is a discussion of why an improvement may<br>
still be achieved when an even coarser quantizer step size<br>
is used, particularly when the interference introduced<br>
exceeds the threshold. Up to now, one has always operated<br>
on the assumption that a finer quantizer step size leads to<br>
a smaller quantization energy introduced, and that a larger<br>
quantizer step size leads to a higher quantization<br>
interference introduced. On average, this may be true, but<br>
it is not always true, and the opposite will be true, in<br>
particular, for rather thinly populated scale factor bands<br>
and, in particular, when the quantizer has a non-linear<br>
characteristic curve. One has found, in accordance with the<br>
invention, that in a number of cases which is not to be<br>
underestimated, a coarser quantizer step size leads to a<br>
smaller interference introduced. This can be traced back to<br>
the fact that there may also be the case when a coarser<br>
quantizer step size hits a spectral value to be quantized<br>
better than a finer quantizer step size, as will be set<br>
forth using the below example with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
By way of example, Fig. 4 shows a quantization<br>
characteristic curve (60) which provides four quantization<br>
stages 0, 1, 2, 3, when input signals between 0 and 1 are<br>
quantized. The quantized values correspond to 0.0, 0.25,<br>
0.5, 0.75. In comparison, a different, coarser quantization<br>
characteristic curve is drawn in dotted lines in Fig. 4<br>
(62), which only has three quantization stages which<br>
correspond to the absolute values of 0.0, 0.33, 0.66. Thus,<br>
in the first case, i.e. with the quantizer characteristic<br>
curve 60, the quantizer step size equals 0.25, whereas in<br>
the second case, i.e. with the quantizer characteristic<br>
curve 62, the quantizer step size equals 0.33. The second<br>
quantizer characteristic curve (62) therefore has a coarser<br>
quantizer step size than the first quantizer characteristic<br>
curve (60) which is to represent a fine quantization<br><br>
characteristic curve. If the value xi=0.33, which is to be<br>
quantized, is contemplated, one can see from Fig. 4 that<br>
the error in the quantization using the fine quantizer<br>
having four stages equals the difference between 0.33 and<br>
0.25, and thus is 0.08. By contrast, the error in the<br>
quantization using three stages equals zero due to the fact<br>
that a quantizer stage exactly "hits", as it were, the<br>
value to be quantized.<br>
It may therefore be seen from Fig. 4 that a coarser<br>
quantization may lead to a smaller quantization error than<br>
a fine quantization.<br>
In addition, a coarser quantization is the deciding factor<br>
for a smaller starting bit rate being required, since the<br>
possible states are only three states, i.e. 0, 1, 2, unlike<br>
the case of the finer quantizer, wherein four stages 0, 1,<br>
2, 3 must be signaled. In addition, the coarser quantizer<br>
step size has the advantage that more values tend to be<br>
"quantized away" to 0 than with a finer quantizer step<br>
size, wherein fewer values are quantized away to "0". Even<br>
though, when several spectral values in one scale factor<br>
band are contemplated, "quantizing to 0" leads to an<br>
increase in the quantization error, this need not<br>
necessarily become problematic, since the coarser quantizer<br>
step size may hit other, more important spectral values in<br>
a more exact manner, so that the quantization error is<br>
cancelled out and even over-compensated for by the coarser<br>
quantization of the other spectral values, a smaller bit<br>
rate occurring at the same time.<br>
In other words, the coder result achieved is "better", all<br>
in all, since the inventive concept achieves a smaller<br>
number of states to be signaled and, at the same time,<br>
improved "hitting" of the quantization stages.<br>
In accordance with the invention, as has been represented<br>
in the left-hand branch of Fig. 2, a still coarser<br><br>
quantizer step size is attempted, starting from estimated<br>
values (step 50 in Fig. 2), when the interference<br>
introduced exceeds the threshold, so as to benefit from the<br>
effect represented using Fig. 4. In addition, it has turned<br>
out that this effect is even more significant with non-<br>
linear quantizers than in the case, drawn in Fig. 4, of two<br>
linear quantizer characteristic curves.<br>
The presented concept of quantizer step size post-<br>
processing and/or scale factor post-processing thus serves<br>
to improve the result of the scale factor estimator.<br>
Starting from the quantizer step sizes determined in the<br>
scale factor estimator (50 in Fig. 2), new quantizer step<br>
sizes which are as large as possible, and for which the<br>
error energy falls below the predefined threshold value,<br>
are determined in the analysis-by-synthesis step.<br>
Therefore, the spectrum is quantized with the quantizer<br>
step sizes calculated, and the energy of the error signal,<br>
i.e. preferably the square sum of the difference of<br>
original and quantized spectral values, is determined.<br>
Alternatively, for error determination, a corresponding<br>
time signal may also be used, even though the use of<br>
spectral values is preferred.<br>
The quantizer step size and the error signal are stored as<br>
the best result obtained so far. If the interference<br>
calculated exceeds a threshold value, the following<br>
approach is adopted:<br>
The scale factor within a predefined range is varied around<br>
the value originally calculated, use being also made, in<br>
particular, of coarser quantizer step sizes (70).<br>
For each new scale factor, the spectrum is again quantized,<br>
and the energy of the error signal is calculated. If the<br>
error signal is smaller than the smallest that has so far<br><br>
been calculated, the current quantizer step size is<br>
latched, along with the energy of the associated error<br>
signal, as the best result obtained so far.<br>
In accordance with the invention, not only relatively<br>
small, but also relatively large scaling factors are taken<br>
into account here, in order to benefit from the concept<br>
described with reference to Fig. 4, particularly when the<br>
quantizer is a non-linear quantizer.<br>
If the interference calculated, however, falls below the<br>
threshold value, i.e. if the estimation in step 50 was too<br>
pessimistic, the scale factor will be varied within a<br>
predefined range around the originally calculated value.<br>
For each new scale factor, the spectrum is re-quantized,<br>
and the energy of the error signal is calculated.<br>
If the error signal is smaller than the smallest that has<br>
been calculated so far, the current quantizer step size is<br>
latched, along with the energy of the associated error<br>
signal, as the best result obtained so far.<br>
However, only relatively coarse scaling factors are taken<br>
into account here so as to reduce the number of bits<br>
required for coding the audio spectrum.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method may be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
may be effected on a digital storage medium, in particular<br>
a disk or CD with electronically readable control signals<br>
which may cooperate with a programmable computer system<br>
such that the method is performed.<br>
Generally, the invention thus consists in a computer<br>
program product having a program code, stored on a machine-<br>
readable carrier, for performing the inventive method, when<br>
the computer program product runs on a computer. In other<br><br>
words, the invention may thus be realized as a computer<br>
program having a program code for performing the method,<br>
when the computer program runs on a computer.<br><br>

A QUANTIZER STEP SIZE FOR QUANTIZING A SIGNAL"<br>
The invention relates an apparatus for determining a quantizer step size for<br>
quantizing a signal comprising audio or video information, the apparatus<br>
comprising: means for (502) providing a first quantizer step size and an<br>
interference threshold; means for (504) determining a first interference<br>
introduced by the first quantizer step size; means for (506) comparing the<br>
interference introduced by the first quantizer step size with the interference<br>
threshold; means for (508) selecting a second quantizer step size which is<br>
larger than the first quantizer step size if the first interference introduced<br>
exceeds the interference threshold; means for (510) determining a second<br>
interference introduced by the second quantizer step size; means for (512)<br>
comparing the second interference introduced with the interference threshold<br>
or the first interference introduced; and means for (514) quantizing the signal<br>
with the second quantizer step size if the second interference introduced is<br>
smaller than one of the first interference introduced and the interference<br>
threshold.<br></td>
