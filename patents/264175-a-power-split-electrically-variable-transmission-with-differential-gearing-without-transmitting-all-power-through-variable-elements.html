ELECTRICALLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH INPUT SPLIT MODE AND<br>
COMPOUND SPLIT MODES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to vehicle transmissions having a differential<br>
gear set and selectively engageable torque transmitting mechanisms including two<br>
electric motor-generators to provide continuously variable speed ranges, fixed gear ratios<br>
and an electric drive mode.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INENTION<br>
[0002]	A vehicle transmission can deliver mechanical power from an engine to<br>
the remainder of a drive system, typically fixed gearing, axles, and wheels. A transmission allows some freedom in engine operation, usually through alternate<br>
selection of five or six different drive ratios, a neutral selection that allows the engine to<br>
operate accessories with the vehicle stationary and reverse. Transmission gear selection<br>
typically allows power from the engine to be delivered to the rest of the drive system with<br>
a ratio of torque multiplication and speed reduction and with a ratio of torque reduction<br>
and speed multiplication known as overdrive.<br>
[0003]	An electric generator can transform mechanical power from the engine<br>
into electrical power, and an electric motor can transform that electric power back into<br>
mechanical power at different torques and speeds for the remainder of the vehicle drive<br>
system. This arrangement allows a continuous variation in the ratio of torque and speed<br>
between the engine and the remainder of the drive system, within the limits of the electric<br>
machinery. An electric storage battery used as a source of power for propulsion may be<br>
added to this arrangement, forming a series hybrid electric drive system.<br><br>
10004]	The series hybrid system allows the engine to operate relatively<br><br>
independently of the torque, speed, and power to propel a vehicle, so as to be controlled<br><br>
for improved emissions and efficiency. This system also allows the electric machine<br>
attached to the engine to function as a motor to start the engine and allows the electric<br>
machine attached to the remainder of the drive train to act as a generator, recovering<br>
energy into the battery by regenerative braking. However, a series electric drive requires<br>
that the electrical machinery be sufficiently sized to transform all engine power from<br>
mechanical to electrical form and from electrical to mechanical form, and useful power is<br>
lost in this double conversion.<br>
|0005]	A power split transmission can use what is commonly understood to be<br>
"differential gearing" to achieve a continuously variable torque and speed ratio between input and output without sending all power through the variable elements. One form of<br>
differential gearing may constitute a planetary gear set. In fact, planetary gearing is<br>
usually the preferred embodiment employed in differentially geared inventions, with the<br>
advantage of compactness and different torque and speed ratios among all members of<br>
the planetary gear set. However, it is possible to construct this invention without<br>
planetary gears, as by using bevel differential gears or other differential gears.<br>
[0006]	A simple electrically variable transmission can use differential gearing to<br>
split power from the engine into two power paths to the wheels of the vehicle; an electro-<br>
mechanical path through a pair of electric machines or motor-generators and an all-<br>
mechanical parallel path that is fixed ratio or alternatively selectable. Electrically variable<br>
transmissions may form input-power-split, compound-power-split, or output-power-split<br>
configurations.<br>
[0007]	An electrically variable transmission in a vehicle can simply transmit<br>
mechanical power. To do so, the electric power produced by one motor-generator<br>
balances the electrical losses and the electric power consumed by the other motor-<br>
generator. A hybrid electrically variable transmission system in a vehicle includes an<br>
electrical storage battery, so the electric power generated by one motor-generator can be<br>
greater than or less than the electric power consumed by the other. Electric power from<br><br>
the battery can sometimes allow both motor-generators to act as motors, especially to<br>
assist the engine with vehicle acceleration. Both motors can sometimes act as generators<br>
to recharge the battery, especially in regenerative vehicle braking. Electric power from<br>
the battery also allows engine starting with the transmission system.<br>
[0008]	One of the most successful substitutes for the series hybrid transmission is<br>
the variable, two-mode, input-split, parallel-hybrid electric transmission. Such a<br>
transmission utilizes an input means to receive power from the vehicle engine and a<br>
power output member to deliver power to drive the vehicle. First and second motor-<br>
generators are connected to an energy storage device, such as a battery, so that the energy<br>
storage device can accept power from and supply power to the first and second motor-<br>
generators. A control means regulates power flow among the energy storage devices and<br>
the motor-generators as well as between the first and second motor-generators.<br>
[0009]	Operation in a first or second mode may be selectively achieved by using<br>
clutches. In one mode, the output speed of the transmission is directly proportional to the<br>
speed of one motor-generator, and in the second mode the output speed of the<br>
transmission increases along with the speed of the other motor-generator.<br>
[0010]	In some embodiments of the variable, two-mode, input-split, parallel-<br>
hybrid electric transmission a planetary gear set is selectively employed for torque<br>
multiplication. In addition, some embodiments may utilize three torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms—two to select the operational mode desired of the transmission and the third<br>
selectively to disconnect the transmission from the engine.<br>
[0011]	As those skilled in the art will appreciate, a transmission system using a<br>
power split arrangement may receive power from two sources. However, the prior art<br>
does not include any practical gear schemes with an input-split operating mode and more<br>
than two compound split operating modes.<br><br>
The prior art document US6558283 discloses a transmission for<br>

being each coupled to a respective one of said two planetary trains, each of said<br>

connection with said output shaft.<br>

members of said first planetary gear set with one of said gear members of said<br>
second planetary gear set; and a second interconnecting member continuously<br>
connecting another one of said gear members of said first planetary gear set with<br>

and said second motor generator, and continuously connected to at least one of<br>
said plurality of gear elements of each of a pair said at least two planetary<br>

Objects of the Invention<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to propose 'a power split<br>
electrically variable transmission with differential gearing without transmitting all<br>
power through variable elements which is capable of achieving a continuously<br>
variable torque and speed ratio between input and output.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose "a power split electrically variable<br>
transmission with differential gearing without transmitting all power through<br>
variable elements" which can use differential gearing to split power from the<br><br>
engine into two power paths to the wheels of the vehicle, one being electro<br>
mechanical path through a pair of electric machines and the other being an all<br>
mechanical parallel path that is fixed ratio.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose 'a power split<br>
electrically variable transmission with differential gearing without transmitting all<br>
power through variable elements', which is capable of providing operation in fixed<br>
gear ratio allowing the transmission to function without using the electric motor-<br>
generators to carry power from input to output.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose 'a power split<br>
electrically variable transmission with differential gearing without transmitting all<br>
power through variable elements', which allows the motor-generators to be used<br>
solely to convert battery power to output power or to convert power from the<br>
output into battery power at their full, combined capacity.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]	The present invention combines the use of an input-split mode with any<br>
number of compound-split modes as provided by the transmission gearing. It also<br>
provides for operation in fixed gear ratios, to allow the transmission to function without<br>
using the electric motor-generators to carry power from input to output. This fixed gear<br>
operation allows the transmission to operate even if one or both of the motor-generators<br>
are disabled; it allows the transmission to be designed to carry more power without<br>
enlarging the capacity of the motor-generators; it allows the motor-generators to be used<br>
solely to convert battery power to output power or to convert power from the output into<br>
battery power at their full, combined capacity.<br>
[0013]	The mechanism consists of a compound planetary gear set attached to: the<br>
input, two electric motor-generators, and two selectable mechanical power paths to the<br>
output. The compound planetary gear set is interconnected to provide two independent<br>
speed variables, such as the input speed and a speed ratio through the gear set. The input,<br>
motor-generators, and output elements are attached to the compound planetary gear set<br>
such that their speeds may all be different from one another. Overall the speed of any<br>
element may be defined by a linear algebraic combination of the speeds of any two other<br>
elements.<br>
[0014]	Thus, the operation of a single mechanical power path from the compound<br>
planetary gear set to the output results in a continuously-variable speed ratio range for the<br>
transmission, which may be controlled by the action of the motor-generators.<br>
[0015|	The simultaneous operation of two mechanical power paths from the<br>
compound planetary gear set to the output results in a mechanical speed ratio. There is,<br>
further, at least one selectable connection between at least one of the electric motor-<br>
generators and the output. These selectable connections may be used to provide a low,<br>
launch range and a reverse launch range using an input power split. A lockup clutch may<br>
be provided to selectively operate the compound planetary gear set in direct drive, so that<br>
additional fixed gear ratios may be selected.<br><br>
[0016]	A vehicle transmission is.provided. The transmission includes a<br>
differential gear set having first, second, third, fourth, and fifth gear elements operatively<br>
interconnected with one another. An input shaft is operatively connected to the first gear<br>
element. A first selectively engageable torque transmitting mechanism is mounted to a<br>
stationary member and is operatively connected to the second gear element. A second<br>
selectively engageable torque transmitting mechanism is mounted to the stationary<br>
member and is operatively connected to the third gear element. A first output means is<br>
operatively connected to the fourth gear element, and a second output means is<br>
operatively connected to the fifth gear element. Furthermore, at least one of the second<br>
or third gear elements may be operatively connected to an output member, and at least<br>
one of said fourth or fifth gear element may be operatively connected to the output by<br>
more than one selectively engageable torque transmitting mechanism.<br>
[0017]	The transmission of the invention may operate with fixed ratios, or may be<br>
employed with motor-generators as the first and second torque transmitting mechanisms<br>
to provide a large number of ratio ranges as a continuously variable transmission. Other<br>
torque transmitting mechanisms or clutches are selectively engageable to operatively<br>
connect various components of the transmission to provide continuously variable speed<br>
ranges, fixed gear ratios and electric drive. The gear set is configured such that the<br>
rotational speeds of two of the gear elements may be independently established and<br>
determine the rotational speeds of the other three gear elements.<br>
[0018]	The power required from the motor-generators in continuously variable<br>
operation is kept to a small fraction of power through the transmission while the ratio<br>
spread can be wide. The overall capacity or "corner power" of the motor-generators can<br>
also be kept as low as practical differential gearing will allow. Since electric motors are<br>
relatively expensive and inefficient as compared with gearing, limiting their size will help<br>
make the transmission relatively inexpensive and efficient. The input-split mode of<br>
operation prevents the counter flow of power or power loop that would be formed at<br>
launch with a compound-power-split operating range, easing the requirements for the<br>
electric motors.<br><br>
[0019]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes<br>
for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[00201	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of a vehicle transmission including a<br>
differential gear set according to the invention; and<br>
[0021]	FIGURE 2 is a chart depicting some of the operating characteristics of the<br>
vehicle transmission shown in Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0022]	The invention described herein is related to U.S Application S.N.<br>
10/819,399 filed April 7, 2004, entitled "Compound Differential Dual Power Path<br>
Transmission" which is commonly assigned with this application to General Motors, and<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0023]	Referring to Figure 1, a vehicular transmission 10 is schematically<br>
depicted. The transmission 10 includes a compound differential, Ravineaux gear set 14.<br>
The gear set 14 includes a first ring gear member 18, a second ring gear member 22, a<br>
planet carrier assembly member 26 including a first set of pinion gears 30 and a second<br>
set of pinion gears 34 rotatably mounted thereto, a first sun gear member 38, and a<br>
second sun gear member 42. The first sun gear member 38 is meshingly engaged with<br>
the first set of pinion gears 30. The second sun gear member 42 is meshingly engaged<br>
with the second set of pinion gears 34. The first ring gear member 18 is meshingly<br>
engaged with the first set of pinion gears 30, and the second ring gear member 22 is<br>
meshingly engaged with the second set of pinion gears 34. The first set of pinion gears<br>
30 is meshingly engaged with the second set of pinion gears 34.<br><br>
[0024]	The differential gear set 14 has five members 18, 22, 26, 38, 42 on a<br>
common axis A, and is configured so that the speeds of any two of the gear members are<br>
capable of being established independently of one another, and the speeds of the other<br>
three gear members are dependent on the speeds established for the two gear members.<br>
Thus, for example, the rotational speeds of the planetary carrier 26 and the first sun gear<br>
38 may be established independently, and the rotational speeds of the second sun gear 42,<br>
the first ring gear 18, and the second ring gear 22 are determined by the speeds of the<br>
planetary carrier 26 and the first sun gear 38. Similarly, the rotational speeds of the<br>
planetary carrier 26 and the second sun gear 42 may be established independently, and<br>
the rotational speeds of the first sun gear 38, the first ring gear 18, and the second ring<br>
gear 22 are determined by the speeds of the planetary carrier 26 and the second sun gear<br>
42. The transmission 10 further comprises an input shaft 46.<br>
[0025]	A first torque transmitting mechanism 50 operatively interconnects the<br>
second sun gear member 42 and a stationary member such as the transmission housing<br>
54. A second torque transmitting mechanism 58 operatively interconnects the first sun<br>
gear member 38 and the transmission housing 54. The first and second torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 may be friction brakes, electric motor-generators,<br>
combinations thereof etc., within the scope of the claimed invention. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 are electric motors each having a<br>
stator 62 rigidly mounted to the housing 54 and a rotor 66 rigidly affixed to one of the<br>
sun gears 38, 42 for rotation therewith. The rotor 66 of the first torque transmitting<br>
mechanism 50 is affixed to sun gear 42 via a sleeve 70 around the input shaft 46.<br>
Output Members<br>
[0026[	The transmission 10 includes two output members, namely, a first<br>
countershaft 78 and a second countershaft 80, that are operatively connected to the gear<br>
set 14 and that together provide three selectable power paths by which power may flow to<br>
an output shaft 76. Four gear members 82, 84, 86 and 88 are connected to the first<br>
countershaft 78 for rotation therewith. Four gear members 90, 92, 94 and 96 are<br>
connected to the second countershaft 80 for rotation therewith. Gear members 102, 106<br><br>
and 110 are rotatably supported by a central shaft 77. Gear member 114 is rotatably<br>
supported by the output shaft 76. The gear members 102, 106, 110 and 114 are meshingly<br>
engaged with gear members 82, 84, 86 and 88, respectively. The gear members 102, 106,<br>
110 and 114 are meshingly engaged with gear members 90, 92, 94 and 96, respectively.<br>
Clutches<br>
[0027]	As illustrated in the embodiment shown in Figure 1, multiple torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms, such as clutches, are configured to selectively establish a drive<br>
connection between various components of the transmission 10. A first clutch 72 is<br>
selectively engageable to operatively connect an input shaft 46 to the planet carrier<br>
assembly member 26.<br>
[0028]	A second clutch 74 is selectively engageable to operatively connect the<br>
first ring gear member 18 to the second ring gear 22, through a central shaft 77. A sleeve<br>
75 surrounds the central shaft 77.<br>
[0029]	A third clutch 100 is selectively engageable to operatively connect the first<br>
sun gear member 38 (and rotor 66 of the second torque transmitting mechanism 58) to a<br>
gear member 102. Gear member 102 is rotatably supported by the central shaft 77: Gear<br>
member 102 is connected to countershafts 78 and 80 through meshing engagements with<br>
gear members 82 and 90, respectively.<br>
[0030]	A fourth clutch 104 is selectively engageable to operatively connect the<br>
first ring gear member 18 to a gear member 106. Gear member 106 is rotatably supported<br>
by the central shaft 77. Gear member 106 is connected to countershafts 78 and 80 through<br>
meshing engagements with gear members 84 and 92, respectively.<br>
[0031]	A fifth clutch 108 is selectively engageable to operatively connect the first<br>
ring gear member 18 to a gear member 110. Gear member 110 is rotatably supported by<br>
the central shaft 77. Gear member 110 is connected to countershafts 78 and 80 through<br>
meshing engagements with gear members 86 and 94, respectively.<br>
[0032]	A sixth clutch 112 is selectively engageable to operatively connect the<br>
second ring gear 22, through the central shaft 77, to a gear member 114 which is<br>
connected to the output shaft 76.<br><br>
Modes of Operation<br>
|0033]	As shown in Figure 2 and described below, the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms and clutches shown in Figure 1 are selectively engageable to provide<br>
multiple continuously variable speed ranges (V1-V4), fixed gear ratios (F1-F7) and an<br>
electric drive mode (El).<br>
Fixed Speed Ratios<br>
[0034]	A first forward speed ratio Fl is established with the engagement of first<br>
clutch 72, second clutch 74 and third clutch 100. The first clutch 72 operatively connects<br>
the input shaft 46 to the planet carrier assembly member 26. The second clutch 74<br>
operatively connects the first ring gear member 18 to the second ring gear member 22.<br>
The third clutch 100 operatively connects the first sun gear member 38 to two output<br>
members, the first countershaft 78 and the second countershaft 80.<br>
[0035]	A second forward speed ratio F2 is established with the engagement of<br>
first clutch 72, third clutch 100 and fourth clutch 104. The first clutch 72 operatively<br>
connects the input shaft 46 to the planet carrier assembly member 26. The third clutch<br>
100 operatively connects the first sun gear member 38 to two output members, the first<br>
countershaft 78 and the second countershaft 80. The fourth clutch 104 operatively<br>
connects the first ring gear member 18 to one of the two output members, the first<br>

Electric Drive Mode<br>
[0041]	An electric drive mode El is established with the engagement of the third<br>
clutch 100. The third clutch 100 operatively connects the first sun gear member 38 to two<br>
output members, the first countershaft 78 and the second countershaft 80. The input shaft<br>
46 is not connected to the rest of the transmission 10 i.e. the engine is disconnected from<br>
the transmission 10. Power is provided by the torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58<br>
functioning as electric motors.<br><br>
Continuously Variable Range Modes<br>
[0042]	When the torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 are motors or include<br>
motors, the transmission 10 can be operated as a CVT, by absorbing power with one<br>
motor and using it in the other motor. The transmission 10 of Figure 1 is capable of<br>
multiple continuously variable ranges or modes.<br>
[0043]	A first variable speed range VI is established with the engagement of first<br>
clutch 72 and third clutch 100. The first clutch 72 operatively connects the input shaft 46<br>
to the planet carrier assembly member 26. The third clutch 100 operatively connects the<br>
first sun gear member 38 to two output members, the first countershaft 78 and the second<br>
countershaft 80.<br>
[0044]	A second variable speed range V2 is established with the engagement of<br>
first clutch 72 and fourth clutch 104. The first clutch 72 operatively connects the input<br>
shaft 46 to the planet carrier assembly member 26. The fourth clutch 104 operatively<br>
connects the first ring gear member 18 to two output members, the first countershaft 78<br>
and the second countershaft 80.<br>
[0045]	A third variable speed range V3 is established with the engagement of first<br>
clutch 72 and sixth clutch 112. The first clutch 72 operatively connects the input shaft 46<br>
to the planet carrier assembly member 26. The sixth clutch 112 operatively connects the<br>

[0046]	A fourth variable speed range V4 is established with the engagement of<br>

46 to the planet carrier assembly member 26. The fifth clutch 108 operatively connects<br>
the first ring gear member 18 to two output member the first countershaft 78 and the<br>
second countershaft 80.<br>
[0047]	The continuously variable ranges are input power split when third clutch<br>
100 is engaged i.e. variable range VI is input split. Modes V2, V3 and V4 are compound<br>
split. The input-power-split configuration has special advantage for vehicle launching,<br>
because one of the electric motor-generators is at zero speed with the output at zero<br>
speed; no power loop is present during launch. A compound power split configuration<br><br>
has special advantage for operation with finite speed ratios because they have a definite<br>
and relatively broad range where transmission power is fed forward and no power loop is<br>
present in this range.<br>
[0048]	Each CVT range or mode is covered as the speed of one torque<br>
transmitting mechanism is decreasing and the speed of the other is increasing. Thus, each<br>
CVT mode corresponds to a shift between the fixed speed ratios of the transmission as<br>
described above. Transitions between successive modes or ranges occur as the<br>
countershaft gearing is selectively engaged and disengaged, and correspond to fixed<br>
speed ratios of the transmission described above.<br>
[0049]	Thus, the same transmission gearing, compound planetary gearing, and<br>
dual countershaft gearing can be useful in both stepped ratio and continuously variable<br>
transmissions, and, in fact, a transmission can be constructed to operate effectively in<br>
both ways. The transmission 10 can be operated practically as a stepped ratio<br>
transmission, CVT, or combination of the two.<br>
[0050]	It should be noted that the first countershaft 78 and the second<br>
countershaft 80 may be operatively connected to the output shaft 76 simultaneously so<br>
that both countershafts transmit power to the output shaft.<br>
[0051]	The torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 selectively control the<br>
rotational speed of the sun gears 42, 38. As described above, different speed ratios<br>
between the input shaft 46 and the two countershafts 78 and 80 are established through<br>
selective engagement of the torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 and clutches 72, 74,<br>
100, 104, 112, 108 and corresponding control of sun gear speed.<br>
[0052]	While countershafts 78, 80 are employed together as a single operative<br>
output means and the output shaft is employed directly as another output means in a<br>
preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will recognize a variety of different output<br>
member configurations that may be employed within the scope of the invention to form<br>
dual power paths from the gear set 14 to an output shaft 76. For example, members of a<br>
second planetary gear set may be operatively connected to the first and second ring gears<br>
18 and 22 and selectively engageable via clutches to an output shaft. Moreover, those<br><br>
skilled in the art will recognize that it may be desirable to add additional gears to the<br>
countershafts and the output shaft to increase the number of speed ratios available<br>
between the countershafts and the output shaft.<br>
[0053]	In a preferred embodiment, the transmission 10 also includes an energy<br>
storage device such as a battery 136 operatively connected via conductive wires 134 to<br>
the motors of torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 to receive power from them and to<br>
supply power to them. A controller 132 is operatively connected to the battery and the<br>
motors to regulate the flow of power among them. Thus, a hybrid transmission is<br>
formed. If torque transmitting mechanisms 50, 58 are electric generators, they can apply<br>
torque indefinitely even' if their shafts are rotating. Thus, the shifts described above can<br>
be transformed into compound power split operating ranges. That is, the braking torque<br>
and speed applied by one of the torque transmitting mechanisms to spin the gear set<br>
element corresponding to one of the countershafts slower than the input can be<br>
transformed into power used by the other torque transmitting mechanism to spin the<br>
element corresponding to the other countershaft faster than the input.<br>
[0054]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A POWER SPLIT ELECTRICALLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH<br>
DIFFERENTIAL GEARING WITHOUT TRANSMITTING ALL POWER<br>
THROUGH VARIABLE ELEMENTS.<br>
A vehicle transmission includes a differential gear set having five<br>
coaxial gear elements and an output member. Two of the gear elements are<br>
controllable via torque transmitting mechanisms such as electric motors to<br>
establish a plurality of speed ratios between the input shaft and the output shaft.<br>
Two of the other gear elements are selectively operatively connectable to an<br>
output shaft via a gear arrangement that allows for a plurality of speed ratios<br>
between the gear elements and the output shaft. Additional torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms such as clutches are selectively engageable to provide continuously<br>
variable speed ranges between the input shaft and the output shaft, fixed gear<br>
ratios and an electric drive mode. The various speed ratios enable a plurality of<br>
compound split operating modes as well as an input split mode.</td>
