RUTHENIUM-RHODIUM ALLOY ELECTRODE CATALYST AND FUEL CELL COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an electrode catalyst for fuel cells, which comprises a ruthenium-rhodium alloy and improves catalytic availability and safety by virtue of its excellent oxygen reduction activity and methanol resistance. The present invention also relates to a 'membrane electrode assembly (MEA) comprising the same catalyst and a high-quality and high-efficiency fuel cell, preferably a direct liquid fuel cell, comprising the same membrane electrode assembly.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, as portable electronic instruments and wireless communication instruments are widely distributed, development and research into fuel cells as portable power sources, fuel cells for pollution-free cars and power generating fuel cells as clean energy sources are made intensively.<br>
Fuel cells are power generation systems that convert chemical energies provided by fuel gases (hydrogen, methanol or other organic substances) and oxidants {oxygen or air) directly into electric energies through electrochemical reactions. Fuel cells are classified depending on their operating conditions into solid oxide electrolyte fuel cells, molten carbonate electrolyte fuel cells, phosphate electrolyte fuel cells and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.<br>
More particularly, the polymer electrolyte<br>
l<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
membrane fuel cells are classified into proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) using hydrogen gas as fuel, direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) using liquid methanol as fuel, or the like. Among those, direct -methanol fuel cells are pollution-free energy sources capable of operating at a low temperature of 100 °C or lower. Additionally, DMFCs have high energy density compared to other batteries and internal combustion engines as technical competitors. Further, DMFCs are energy conversion systems that show no difficulty in a charging process and can be used for 50,000 hours or more in the presence of fuels supplied thereto.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 showing a schematic view of a fuel cell, the fuel cell includes an anode (negative electrode), cathode (positive electrode) and a proton exchange membrane (11) interposed between both electrodes. The proton exchange membrane is formed of a polymer electrolyte and has a thickness of between 30 µm and 300 µm. Each of the anode and cathode includes a gas diffusion electrode comprising a support layer (14), (15) for supplying reactants and a catalyst layer (12), (13) where the reactants are subjected to redox reactions (such cathode and anode are commonly referred to as gas diffusion electrodes), and a collector (16), (17).<br>
In a direct methanol fuel cell, oxidation occurs at an anode, and then protons and electrons produced by the oxidation are transferred to a cathode. The protons transferred to the cathode are bonded to oxygen to form water and the electromotive force generated by such reduction of oxygen becomes an energy source for the fuel cell. Such reactions occurred at an anode and a<br>
 2<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR20W0t537<br>
cathode can be represented by the following reaction formulae.<br>
Anode: CH3OH + H20 -&gt; C02 + 6H+ + 6e~ Ea = 0.05V Cathode: 3/202 + 6H+ + 6e~ -&gt; 3H2O EC~._1-23V Total: CH3OH + 3/2O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2H2O Ecell= 1.18V<br>
In the above . reaction formulae, reduction of oxygen at a cathode and oxidation of methanol at an anode significantly affect the quality of a fuel cell. In practice, platinum having excellent oxygen reduction activity has been widely used as cathode catalyst in order to improve the quality of a fuel cell. Additionally, although many attempts" are made to develop cathode materials using platinum alloys such as platinum-nickel, -chrome or -iron alloys due to the high cost of platinum (Takako Toda, Hiroshi Igarashi, Hiroyuki Dchida, and .Mashahiro Watanabe, J. Electrochem. Sod., 146, p3750, 1999), any satisfactory results cannot be obtained.<br>
Meanwhile, methanol used as material for anodic oxidation in a fuel cell may cause a methanol crossover phenomenon wherein methanol crosses over to a cathode from an anode through a polymer electrolyte, thereby functioning as catalytic poison for the cathode material, resulting in significant degradation in catalytic availability and overall quality of the fuel cell. Because of the above-mentioned reasons, there is an additional problem in that concentration of methanol as material for anodic oxidation is limited.<br><br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As described above, we have recognized that although a platinum or platinum alloy catalyst has excellent oxygen reduction activity, the catalyst is problematic in that it is cost-inefficient and causes degradation in the quality of a fuel cell due to its activity toward methanol oxidation. In this regard, we have found that when a non-platinum based catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy is used instead of a platinum or platinum alloy catalyst, it is possible to solve the problems of poisoning of a cathode catalyst caused by a methanol crossover phenomenon and limitation in the concentration of a material for oxidation, as well as to provide a high quality and high efficiency fuel cell by virtue of excellent oxygen reduction activity.<br>
Therefore, it is an obj ect of the present<br>
invention to provide,a high-quality and high-efficiency<br>
i catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy, which<br>
shows excellent methanol resistance and oxygen reduction activity at the same time, and a method for preparing the same catalyst.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using the above catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy and a fuel , cell comprising the same membrane electrode assembly.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there are provided an electrode catalyst for fuel cells comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) comprising the same catalyst, and a fuel cell, preferably a direct liquid fuel cell<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
(DLFC), comprising the same membrane electrode assembly.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing the electrode catalyst for fuel cells comprising a ruthenium-rhodium catalyst, the method including the steps of: (i) dissolving a ruthenium salt and rhodium salt separately to provide a ruthenium salt solution and rhodium salt solution; (ii) mixing the solutions obtained from step (i) with stirring to provide a mixed solution and adding a reducing agent thereto to .obtain precipitate of reduced salts; and (iii) drying the precipitate obtained from step (ii).<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
The present invention is characterized by the use of a non-platinum based electrode catalyst having excellent oxygen reduction activity as well as excellent methanol resistance {i.e., a ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst) as electrode catalyst for fuel cells.<br>
In a fuel cell, for example a direct liquid fuel cell such as a direct methanol fuel cell, a methanol crossover phenomenon should be considered carefully, because it greatly affects qualities of the catalyst, cathode and the whole fuel cell.<br>
(1) In general, platinum catalysts or platinum based alloy catalyst with excellent oxygen reduction activity have been widely used as electrode catalysts for fuel cells. However, there is a problem 'in that the shortcoming specific to platinum itself (i.e., activity toward to methanol) may cause a methanol crossover phenomenon to a cathode, resulting in significant loss of oxygen reduction activity provided by platinum. Such<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
problematic phenomena occur in catalysts comprising platinum-containing alloys as well as in a pure platinum catalyst.<br>
On the contrary, because the catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to the present invention is a non-platinum based catalyst showing excellent oxygen reduction activity and excellent methanol resistance at the same time, it is possible to prevent a cathode catalyst from being poisoned by a methanol crossover phenomenon, and thus to maintain excellent oxygen reduction activity of the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst even in tne presence of methanol.<br>
i (2) Additionally, conventional electrode catalysts have a problem in that concentration of methanol as material for anodic oxidation is limited due to the above-mentioned methanol crossover phenomenon. However, because the catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to the present invention has excellent methanol resistance, it is possible to use methanol with high concentration and thus to provide a fuel cell with high quality and high efficiency.<br>
(3) Further, conventional catalysts for fuel cells have a problem in that it is difficult to save production cost because of expensive platinum. However, the catalyst comprising a Ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to the present invention uses inexpensive raw materials compared to platinum, and thus is cost-efficient in that it is possible to increase the quality and efficiency of a fuel cell while saving the cost.<br>
As described above, the alloy comprising ruthenium and rhodium can be used as electrode catalyst/ preferably as cathode catalyst, for fuel cells.<br>

WO 2005/117.71	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
metal catalysts alone. To provide a supported catalyst, it possible to use a method of coating catalyst particles on a support generally known to one skilled in the art or other methods.<br>
i The carrier that may be used includes porous carbon, conductive polymers or metal oxides. In the case of a supported catalyst, the carrier is used in an amount of between 1 and 95 wt%, preferably of between 2 and 90 wt% based on the total weight of the catalyst.<br>
The porous carbon that may be used includes active carbon, carbon fiber, graphite fiber, carbon nanotube, etc. The conductive polymers that may be used include polyvinyl carbazole, polyaniline, polypyrrole or derivatives thereof. Additionally, the metal oxides that may be used include at least one metal oxide selected from the group consisting of oxides of tungsten, titanium, nickel, ruthenium, tantalum and cobalt.<br>
The catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium according to the present invention may be prepared by a method currently used in the art. One embodiment of the method comprises the steps of: (i) dissolving a ruthenium salt and rhodium salt .separately to provide a ruthenium salt solution and rhodium salt solution; (ii) mixing the solutions obtained from step (i) with stirring to provide a mixed solution and adding a reducing agent thereto to obtain; precipitate of reduced salts; and (iii) drying the precipitate obtained from step (ii).<br>
(1) First, metal salts containing ruthenium and rhodium separately are taken in such an adequate amount as to satisfy a desired molar composition and dissolved in a solvent with stirring to provide a ruthenium-<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
	f<br>
containing solution and rhodium-c;ontaining solution.<br>
: There are no particular limitations in the ruthenium salt and- rhodium salt. It is possible to use hydrated salts of ruthenium and rhodium, for example chlorides, nitrides, sulfates, etc., containing ruthenium and rhodium. .Particularly, ruthenium chloride (RuCl3 xH20) and rhodium chlorides (RhCl3 • xH2O) are preferred. Additionally, although metal salts available from Aldrich Chemical, Co., are used in the present invention, metal salts available from other commercial sources may be used, as long as they have the same composition as the above metal salts.<br>
As described above, each of the ruthenium salt and rhodium salt is used in an amount corresponding to a mole fraction of between 10 and 90 mol%. Additionally, in order to provide a multi-component alloy catalyst, it is possible to use another metal component currently used 'in the art in addition to the ruthenium salt and rhodium salt, and particular examples of the metal component include a metal salt comprising at least one element selected from the group consisting of Fe, Au, Co, Ni, Os, Pd, Ag, Ir, Ge, Ga, Zn, Cu, Al, Si, Sr, Y, Nb,, Mo, W, Ti, B, In, Sn, Pb, !Mnr Cr, Ce, V, Zr and lanthanides.

WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
(2) The ruthenium-containing solution and rhodium-<br>
containing solution obtained in the preceding step are<br>
mixed with stirring, and then a reducing agent is added to the mixed solution all at once to obtain reduced products of the metal salts (for example, ruthenium salt and rhodium salt) as precipitate.<br>
Particular examples of the reducing agent that may be used include sodium borohydride (NaBH4) , hydrazine (N2H4), sodium thiosulfite, nitrohydarzine and sodium formate (HCOONa), but are not limited thereto.<br>
Preferably, the mixed solution containing ruthenium and rhodium dissolved ; therein is adjusted to pH ;of between 7 and 8, more preferably to pH 8, so as to improve the reduction capability of the metal salts. However, a step of adjusting pH of the mixed solution is not essential to the present invention. Therefore, the pH-adjusting step may be omitted.<br>
(3} The precipitate obtained from the preceding step is washed with distilled water, followed by drying, to obtain a ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst as final product.<br>
In this step, the precipitate may be dried in a<br>
manner currently used in the art. For example, the<br>
i	!<br>
precipitate may be freeze-dried at a temperature of between -40°C and 0°C for 1-48 hours.<br>
In a variant, a supported catalyst, i.e., catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy supported by a carrier can be obtained by adding the carrier to the mixed solution of metal salts. Such supported catalysts using porous carbon, conductive polymers, porous metal oxides, etc., as carriers have an advantage in that they can provide the same catalytic activity with a decreased<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
amount of catalyst compared to the corresponding nonsupported catalyst.<br>
In one embodiment of the method for preparing a catalyst comprising a ruthenium-rhodium alloy supported by a carrier, a reducing, agent is added to the aqueous solution containing . metal ions to form a metal alloy solution. Next, aqueous solution of a carbon support is added to the metal alloy solution, thereby forming the metal alloy coated on the carbon support, and the resultant solution is stirred to form slurry. Then, the slurry is left at a temperature of 75-80 "C for 1-3 days to obtain dry powder and the powder is washed with distilled water.<br>

cathode, for fuel cells. <br>

by impregnating carbon paper or carbon fiber fabric having conductivity and porosity! of 80% or more with a hydrophobic polymer (for example, polytetrafluoro ethylene or fluoroethylene copolymer) and baking the resultant product at an approximate temperature between 340 "C and 37013. In order to prevent the gas diffusion layer of a cathode from being flooded by water generated from the catalyst layer of the cathode, the gas diffusion layer should be hydrophobic. To satisfy this, the hydrophobic polymer can be present in the gas. diffusion layer in an amount of between about 10 and 30<br>

The ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to<br>
the present invention was analyzed by X-ray diffraction<br>
as follows.	<br>
The ruthenium-rhodium alloy obtained from Example 1 was used as sample and pure ruthenium metal and rhodium metal were used as controls.<br>

suitably combined with rhodium (see,FIG. 2).<br>

1-2. Evaluation for oxygen reduction activity<br>
The following electrochemical analysis was<br>
performed to determine oxygen reduction activity of the<br>
ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the<br>
present invention.	<br>
To perform the electrochemical analysis, a three-electrode cell, which permits evaluation for reaction activity of any one electrode of the cathode and anode,<br>
was used. In this example, only the cathode catalyst was<br>
tested for its activity.<br>
A Pt wire, Ag/AgCl electrode and a carbon rod coated with a catalyst sample were used as counter<br><br>
electrode, reference electrode and working electrode, respectively, at room temperature. The ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to Example 1 was used as catalyst sample, and platinum metal, ruthenium metal and rhodium metal were used as controls.1 0.5M sulfuric acid was used as liquid electrolyte. To determine oxygen reduction activity of a catalyst, the working electrode was introduced into the solution of 0.5M H2SO4 saturated with oxygen and a voltage of between '0.65V and 1.2V was applied thereto sequentially. Variations in electric current generated during the voltage application were measured. When performing the above procedure, the voltage was applied between the working electrode and reference electrode and electric current was measured between the working electrode and counter electrode.<br>
Oxygen reduction activity results from the reduction current value of dissolved oxygen reduced by a catalyst. Therefore, when there is no drop in electric current in the presence of a catalyst, the catalyst has<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
no reduction activity.<br>
After the experiment, the ruthenium-rhodium alloy,<br>
ruthenium metal and rhodium metal; used in this test<br>
i<br>
showed a drop in electric current at a voltage of 1. 0V or le|ss in the three-electrode cell system. However, they showed lower activity compared to platinum metal due to the lack of platinum. ' Particularly, the ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to the present invention showed a significantly large negative value of electric current generated under the application of the same voltage, as compared to pure ruthenium metal or rhodium metal.<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention has excellent oxygen reduction activity (see, FIG. 3).<br>
1-3. Evaluation for methanol resistance<br>
Experimental Example 1-2 was repeated to determine oxygen reduction activity of the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the1 present invention in the presence of methanol.<br>
A mixed solution of 2M methanol/0.5M sulfuric acid was used as liquid electrolyte and 0. 5M sulfuric acid saturated with oxygen was used as dontrol. Similarly to Experimental Example 1-2, the working electrode was coated with the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to Example 1. A voltage of between 0.75V and 1.1V was applied sequentially and variations in electric current were measured.<br>
After the experiment, the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention showed little degradation in oxygen reduction activity even in<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001S37<br>
the presence of 2M methanol (see, FIG. 4). Therefore, it can be seen that the non-platinum based ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst has excellent methanol resistance.<br>
Experimental Example 2. Analysis for quality of fuel cell using ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst<br>
2-1. Analysis for fuel cell quality<br>
The following test was performed to determine quality of the unit cell obtained by using the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to'Example 1. <br>
 2M methanol solution was supplied to the anode of the unit cell obtained from Example 1 through a graphite<br>
channel at a rate of 0.2-2 cc/min. Additionally, oxygen<br>
! was supplied to the cathode at a flow rate of 300-1000<br>
cc/min., and then the unit cell was measured for current<br>
1	<br>
density and power density.<br>
After the test, the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention showed a current density of 98 mA/cm2 and a power density of 30 mW/cm2 at a voltage of 0.3V. This indicates that the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention has excellent oxygen reduction activity {see, FIG. 5).<br>
2-2. Electrochemical analysis<br>
The fuel cell using the ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to the present invention was analyzed electrochemically as follows.<br>
The ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to Example 1 was used as sample and pure platinum metal catalyst according to Comparative Example 1 was used as control. A mixed solution of 2M methanol/0.5M sulfuric acid and 0. 5M sulfuric acid were used as liquid<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
electrolytes. A voltage of between 0.75V and 1.IV was applied sequentially and variations in electric current of the unit cell were measured-After the test, although the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention showed slightly lower oxygen reduction activity compared to the pure platinum catalyst used as control, it showed no drop in oxygen reduction activity even in the presence of 2M methanol. On the contrary, the pure platinum catalyst showed complete loss of oxygen reduction<br>
current in the presence of 2M methanol due to the<br>
i oxidation current density of methanol (see, FIG. 6).<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that the cathode catalyst comprising the ruthenium-rhodium alloy according to the present invention has excellent methanol resistance as well as good oxygen reduction-activity, and thus is useful as cathode catalyst for fuel cells (for example, direct methanol fuel cells).<br>
2-3. Test for fuel cell quality<br>
The following test was performed to compare the quality of the fuel cell using the ruthenium-rhodium alloy. catalyst according to Example 1 with that of the fuel cell using a conventional platinum catalyst.<br>
| The fuel cell using the ruthenium-rhodium alloy as cathode catalyst according to Example 1 was used as sample and the fuel cell using a conventional platinum catalyst (available from Johnson Matthey Co.) according to Comparative Example 2 was used as control. 2M and 10M methanol solutions were supplied to the anode of each fuel cell (size: 2 cm2) through a graphite channel at a rate of 0.2-2 cc/min. Additionally, oxygen was supplied to the cathode of each fuel cell at a flow rate of 300-<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
1000 cc/min.<br>
After the test, the fuel cell using the conventional platinum catalyst according to Comparative Example 2 showed a continuous drop in electric potential with the lapse of time, when 2M methanol solution is supplied to the anode, and a drop in electric potential of about 0.07V, when 10M methanol solution is supplied to the "anode (see, FIG. 7) . This indicates that oxygen reduction cannot be made satisfactorily due to a methanol crossover phenomenon from the anode to the cathode and poisoning of platinum as cathode catalyst.<br>
On the contrary, the fuel cell using the i<br>
ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst as cathode catalyst showed stable electric potentials when 2M and 10M methanol solutions were supplied to the anode {see, FIG. 7). Therefore, it can be seen that the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention overcomes the limitation in concentration of methanol used as material for anodic oxidation, and thus permits methanol with high concentration to be used as material for anodic oxidation.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention has not only good oxygen reduction activity but also excellent methanol resistance compared to conventional platinum and platinum-based alloy catalysts. Therefore, the ruthenium-rhodium alloy catalyst according to the present invention can prevent poisoning of a cathode catalyst caused by a methanol crossover phenomenon and overcome the limitation in<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2005/117171	PCT/KR2005/001537<br>
concentration of a material for anodic oxidation, and<br>
thus can be used as high-quality and high-efficiency electrode catalyst having improved catalytic availability and stability.<br>
