				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the recovery of copper from copper plant dust. This invention will be useful for copper industry.<br>
During pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrate, considerable amount of copper loss occurs in the form of dust. It has been found that for processing of 1000 tonnes of concentrate 70-100 tonnes of dust is formed. It contains 25-30% of copper. Also such dust is a serious problem in terms of pollution and storage because of its high content of metal in the form of water soluble compounds and its low apparent density. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a suitable metallurgical processing route to recover copper from copper plant dust.<br>
The dust sample are collected from various section of the plant by different collection systems like beneath flues, expansion chambers, baloon flues, boiler settling, filtration through cloth bags in a bag house, electrostatic precipitator in cortell treaters. So far its treatment is concerned, it depend upon the composition of the dust. Usually the dust is charged back to the smelting circuit. In this process the total production capacity of the plant reduces. Various processing routes have been developed.    These    include    (1)    Hydrometallurgical        processes    (2)    pyro-hydrometallurgical processes and (3) Pyrometallurgical processes. Several investigators have studied hydrometallurgical processes for recovery of copper from copper dust. Reference may be made to<br>
K. Jia Jun , Q. R. Yun and C. Chia Yung, Hydrometallurgy, 14, 1984, pp 217-224, wherein it is described that copper dust is leached with sulphuric acid under atmospheric and high pressure to recover metallic<br>
values. However, the process suffers from various drawbacks like large in process inventories, considerable amount of As enters into the leach liquor and copper<br><br>
recovery is poor which reports to the residue as copper sulphide. The residue has to be again fed to copper smelter to recover copper. By this way plant capacity reduces.<br>
Reference may be made to C. Nunez, F. Espiell and A. Roca, Hydrometallurgy, 14, 1985, pp. 93-105 wherein it has been described that copper dust is leached with HC1 - NaCl medium, cyclone separation of matte particles and precipitation of iron, arsenic, antimony and bismuth in the presence of calcium ions at a pH of 3.5, leaving the residue of these metal together with lead. The solution from this operation is treated with zinc to cement copper and silver for recycling to the converter. This process suffers from various drawbacks like 50% of copper is recovered, use of costly reagents which can not be recovered from the leach solution. This may affect the economics of the process. Further, use of hydrochloric acid which is corrosive in nature, impose the restriction on materials of construction and create pollution problem with acid fumes.<br>
Reference may be made to J. D. Prater and J. S. Wells, US Patent 4149880, Mv 19, 1978, wherein it has been described that smelter flue dust is leached with 40gm/L sulphuric acid at 140°C temperature and under a pressure of 50 psi for solubilising copper values and rendering insoluble the highly toxic values. Copper values were recovered from the solution by cementation on metallic iron. This process also suffers from drawbacks like high investment cost of autoclave besides the skilled persons required to operate autoclave at high temperature and pressure.<br>
Reference may be made to W.H. Kruesi and P. R. Kruesi, US Patent 5332560, March 5, 1993, wherein it has been described that copper containing material scrap, ore, dust is leached with cupric tetramine sulphate lixiviant and copper<br>
can be recovered from the leachate by electrolysis. This process suffers from drawbacks like use of costly reagent like cupric tetramine sulphate.<br>
Reference may be made to K. S. Gritton, D. K. Steele and J. E. Gebhardt Proc. Int. Symp. Recycling of Metals and Engineerd materials Virginia, USA, Oct. 28-31, 1990, wherein it has been described that copper processing flue dusts is leached with sulphuric acid and refinery bleed solution to solubilize As and Cu. As was recovered from leach liquor as As2O3 by reduction and precipitation using SO2. This process suffers from drawback like extra step is required to eliminate As from the leach liquor.<br>
Reference may be made to R. Hanks, J. Van der Zel, P. chesney and G. B. Harris, Inst. Min. Met., June 1979, pp C99-C106, wherein it has been described that copper reverberatory dusts is leached with sulphuric acid at 80°C and at a pH value of 1.4, a copper extraction of 83% was obtained with an acid consumption of 3kg acid /kg of Cu. The leach solution contained iron and bismuth level too high for direct electrowinning. Copper was precipitated by adding lime to the leached liquor. This process suffers from drawback like the leach solution contains considerable amount of FeandBi. <br><br>
Reference may be made to W. E. Anable, J. I. Paige and D.C. Paulson, US Bureau of Mines Report Rep. Invest No. 8554, pp 19, 1981, wherein it has been described that cyclone and precipitator dust of copper smelter is treated pyrometallurgically using 110% stoichiometric sulfur and 123% C based on producing a 40% Cu-Fe matte, resulting in recovery of 95% copper contained in the dust. This process suffers from various drawbacks like use of costly sulfur, high temperature operation and pollution.<br>
Reference may be made to J. Newton and C. L. Wilson, "Metallurgy of copper", J. Wiley &amp; Sons. Inc., London, pp. 244, 1942, wherein it has been described that dust sample is charged back into the smelting circuit. This process suffers from the drawback that it reduces the plant's production capacity.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for recovery of copper from copper plant dust, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process of sulphuric acid leaching of roasted copper plant dust, so that the resulting copper sulphate solution could be used directly as electrolyte in the copper electrorefming tank.<br>
In the process of present invention, copper plant dust is roasted prior to<br>
leaching in sulphuric acid.<br>
During roasting all the sulphides are converted to oxides<br>
CuS + 7/2O2 → CuO.CuSO4 + SO2 	(1)<br>
CuFeS2 + 13/2 O2    → 2CuO + Fe2 O3 + 4 SO2	(2)<br>
The oxides produced during roasting are easily leachable in sulphuric acid and enhance the copper recovery<br>
CuO + H2S04 → CuSO4 + H2O	(3)<br>
CuO. Fe2O3 + 2 H2SO4 →CuSO4 + Fe2 O3 + H2O	(4)<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for recovery<br>
of copper from copper plant dust which comprises<br>
i) grinding the copper dust  of the composition such as herein described, to<br>
about -140µM in size,<br>
