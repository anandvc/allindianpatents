Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to active agent delivery systems and, more<br>
specifically, to compositions that comprise polypeptides covalently attached to active<br>
agents and methods for protecting and administering active agents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Active agent delivery systems are often critical for the effective delivery of a<br>
biologically active agent (active agent) to the appropriate target. The importance of<br>
these systems becomes magnified when patient compliance and active agent stability<br>
are taken under consideration. For instance, one would expect patient compliance to<br>
increase markedly if an active agent is administered orally in lieu of an injection or<br>
another invasive technique. Increasing the stability of the active agent, such as<br>
prolonging shelf life or survival in the stomach, will assure dosage reproducibility and<br>
perhaps even reduce the number of dosages required which could improve patient<br>
compliance.<br>
Absorption of an orally administered active agent is often blocked by the<br>
harshly acidic stomach milieu, powerful digestive enzymes in the GI tract,<br>
permeability of cellular membranes and transport across lipid bilayers. Incorporating<br>
adjuvants such as resorcinol, surfactants, polyethylene glycol (PEG) or bile acids<br>
enhance permeability of cellular membranes. Microencapsulating active agents using<br>
protenoid microspheres, liposomes or polysaccharides have been effective in abating<br>
enzyme degradation of the active agent. Enzyme inhibiting adjuvants have also been<br>
used to prevent enzyme degradation. Enteric coatings have been used as a protector<br>
of Pharmaceuticals in the stomach.<br>
Active agent delivery systems also provide the ability to control the release of<br>
the active agent. For example, formulating diazepam with a copolymer of glutamic<br>
acid and aspartic acid enables a sustained release of the active agent. As another<br>
example, copolymers of lactic acid and glutaric acid are used to provide timed release<br>
of human growth hormone. A wide range of pharmaceuticals purportedly provide<br>
sustained release through microencapsulation of the active agent in amides of<br>
dicarboxylic acids, modified amino acids or thermally condensed amino acids. Slow<br>
release rendering additives can also be intermixed with a large array of active agents<br>
in tablet formulations.<br>
Each of these technologies imparts enhanced stability and time-release<br>
properties to active agent substances.. Unfortunately, these technologies suffer from<br>
several shortcomings. Incorporation of the active agent is often dependent on<br>
diffusion into the microencapsulating matrix, which may not be quantitative and may<br>
complicate dosage reproducibility. In addition, encapsulated drugs rely on diffusion<br>
out of the matrix, which is highly dependant on the water solubility of the active<br>
agent. Conversely, water-soluble microspheres swell by an infinite degree and,<br>
unfortunately, may release the active agent in bursts with little active agent available<br>
for sustained release. Furthermore, in some technologies, control of the degradation<br>
process required for active agent release is unreliable. For example, an enterically<br>
coated active agent depends on pH to release the active agent and, as such, is difficult<br>
to control the rate of release.<br>
In the past, use has been made of amino acid side chains of polypeptides as<br>
pendant groups to which active agents can be attached. These technologies typically<br>
require the use of spacer groups between the amino acid pendant group and the active<br>
agent The peptide-drug conjugates of this class of drug delivery system rely on<br>
enzymes in the bloodstream for the release of the drug and, as such, are not used for<br>
oral administration. Examples of timed and targeted release of injectable or<br>
subcutaneous pharmaceuticals include: linking of norethindrone, via a hydroxypropyl<br>
spacer, to the gamma carboxylate of polyglutamic acid; and linking of nitrogen<br>
mustard, via a peptide spacer, to the gamma carbamide of polyglutamine.<br>
Dexamethasone has been covalently attached directly to the beta carboxylate of<br>
polyaspartic acid without a spacer group. This prodrug formulation was designed as a<br>
colon-specific drug delivery system where the drug is released by bacterial hydrolytic<br>
enzymes residing in the large intestines. The released dexamethasone active agent, in<br>
turn, was targeted to treat large bowel disorders and was not intended to be absorbed<br>
into the bloodstream. Yet another technology combines the advantages of covalent<br>
drug attachment with liposome formation where the active ingredient is attached to<br>
highly ordered lipid films (known as HARs) via a peptide linker. Thus, there has<br>
been no drug delivery system, heretofore reported, that incorporates the concept of<br>
attaching an active1 ingredient to a polypeptide pendant group with its targeted<br>
delivery into the bloodstream via oral administration.<br>
It is also important to control the molecular weight, molecular size and particle<br>
size of the active agent delivery system. Variable molecular weights have<br>
unpredictable diffusion rates and pharmacokinetics. High molecular weight carriers<br>
are digested slowly or late, as in the case of naproxen-linked dextran, which is<br>
digested almost exclusively in the colon by bacterial enzymes. High molecular<br>
weight microspheres usually have high moisture content which may present a<br>
problem with water labile active ingredients. Particle size not only becomes a<br>
problem with injectable drags, as in the HAR application, but absorption through the<br>
brush-border membrane of the intestines is limited to less than 5 microns.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides covalent attachment of active agents to a<br>
polymer of peptides or amino acids. The invention is distinguished from the above<br>
mentioned technologies by virtue of covalently attaching the active agent, which<br>
includes, for example, pharmaceutical drugs and nutrients, to the N-terminus, the C-<br>
terminus or directly to the amino acid side chain of an oligopeptide or polypeptide,<br>
also referred to herein as a carrier peptide. In certain applications, the polypeptide<br>
will stabilize the active agent, primarily in the stomach, through conformational<br>
protection. In these applications, delivery of the active agent is controlled, in part, by<br>
the kinetics of unfolding of the. carrier peptide. Upon entry into the upper intestinal<br>
tract, indigenous enzymes release the active ingredient for absorption by the body by<br>
selectively hydrolyzing the peptide bonds of the carrier peptide. This enzymatic<br>
action introduces a second order sustained release mechanism.<br>
The invention provides a composition comprising a polypeptide and an active<br>
agent covalently attached to the polypeptide. Preferably, the polypeptide is (i) an<br>
oligopeptide, (ii) a homopolymer of one of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids<br>
(L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iii) a heteropolymer<br>
of two or more naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer,<br>
analogue, or1 derivative thereof, (iv) a homopolymer of a synthetic amino acid, (v) a<br>
beteropolymer of two or more synthetic amino acids or (vi) a heteropolymer of one or<br>
more naturally occurring amino acids and one or more synthetic amino acids.<br>
The active agent preferably is covalently attached to a side chain, the N-<br>
terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, the active<br>
agent is a carboxylic acid and is covalently attached to the N-terminus of the<br>
polypeptide. In another preferred embodiment, the active agent is an amine and is<br>
covalently attached to the C-terminus of the polypeptide. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the active agent is an alcohol and is covalently attached to the C-<br>
terminus of the polypeptide. In yet another preferred embodiment, the active agent is<br>
an alcohol and is covalently attached to the N-terminus of the polypeptide.<br>
The composition of the invention can also include one or more of a<br>
microencapsulating agent, an adjuvant and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient<br>
The microencapsulating agent can be selected from polyethylene glycol (PEG), an<br>
amino acid, a sugar and a salt When an adjuvant is included in the composition, the<br>
adjuvant preferably activates an intestinal transporter.<br>
Preferably, the composition of the invention is in the form of an ingestable<br>
tablet, an intravenous preparation or an oral suspension. The active agent can be<br>
conformationally protected by folding of the polypeptide about the active agent In<br>
another embodiment, the polypeptide is capable of releasing the active agent from the<br>
composition in a pH-dependent manner.<br>
The invention also provides a method for protecting an active agent from<br>
degradation comprising covalently attaching the active agent to a polypeptide.<br>
The invention also provides a method for controlling release of an active agent<br>
from a composition wherein the composition comprises a polypeptide, the method<br>
comprising covalently attaching the active agent to the polypeptide.<br>
The invention also provides a method for delivering an active agent to a<br>
patient, the patient being a human or a non-human animal, comprising administering<br>
to the patient a composition comprising a polypeptide and an active agent covalently<br>
attached to the polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is released<br>
from the composition by an enzyme-catalyzed release. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the active agent is released in a time-dependent manner based on the<br>
pharmacokinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed release. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the composition further comprises a microencapsulating agent and the active agent is<br>
released from the composition by dissolution of the microencapsulating agent In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the active agent is released from the composition by a<br>
pH-dependent unfolding of the polypeptide. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
active agent is released from the composition in a sustained release. In yet another<br>
preferred embodiment, the composition further comprises an adjuvant covalently<br>
attached to the polypeptide and release of the adjuvant from the composition is<br>
controlled by the polypeptide. The adjuvant can be microencapsulated into a carrier<br>
peptide-drug conjugate for biphasic release of active ingredients.<br>
The invention also provides a method for preparing a composition comprising<br>
a polypeptide and an active agent covalently attached to the polypeptide. The method<br>
comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) attaching the active agent to a side chain of an amino acid to form an active<br>
agent/amino acid complex;<br>
(b) forming an active agent/amino acid complex N-carboxyanhydride (NCA)<br>
from the active agent/amino acid complex; and<br>
(c) polymerizing the active agent/amino acid complex N-carboxyanhydride<br>
(NCA).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is a pharmaceutical agent or an<br>
adjuvant. In another preferred embodiment, steps (a) and (b) are repeated prior to step<br>
(c) with a second active agent. When steps (a) and (b) are repeated prior to step (c)<br>
with a second agent, the active agent and second active agent can be copolymerized in<br>
step (c). In another preferred embodiment, the amino acid is glutamic acid and the<br>
active agent is released from the glutamic acid as a dimer upon a hydrolysis of the<br>
polypeptide and wherein the active agent is released from the glutamic acid by<br>
coincident intramolecular transamination. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
glutamic acid is replaced by an amino acid selected from the group consisting of<br>
aspartic acid, arginine, asparagine, cysteine, lysine, threonine, and serine, and wherein<br>
the active agent is attached to the side chain of the amino acid to form an amide, a<br>
thioester, an ester, an ether, a urethane, a carbonate, an anhydride or a carbamate. In<br>
yet another preferred embodiment, the glutamic acid is replaced by a synthetic amino<br>
acid with a pendant group comprising an amine, an alcohol, a sulfhydryl, an amide, a<br>
urea, or an acid functionality.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description are exemplary, but are not restrictive, of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides several benefits for active agent delivery.<br>
First, the invention can stabilize the active agent and prevent digestion in the stomach.<br>
In addition, the pharmacologic effect can be prolonged by delayed release of the<br>
active agent. Furthermore, active agents can be combined to produce synergistic<br>
effects. Also, absorption of the active agent in the intestinal tract can be enhanced.<br>
The invention also allows targeted delivery of active agents to specifics sites of<br>
action.<br>
The composition of the invention comprises a polypeptide and an active agent<br>
covalently attached to the polypeptide. Acive agents may be selected from the list in<br>
TABLE 1, either alone or in combination with other agents on the list.<br>
Preferably, the polypeptide is (i) an oligopeptide, (ii) a homopolymer of one of<br>
the twenty naturally occurring amino acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue,<br>
or derivative thereof, (iii) a heteropolymer of two or more naturally occurring amino<br>
acids (L or D isomers), or an isomer, analogue, or derivative thereof, (iv) a<br>
homopolymer of a synthetic amino acid, (v) a heteropolymer of two or more synthetic<br>
amino acids or (vi) a heteropolymer of one or more naturally occurring amino acids<br>
and one or more synthetic amino acids.<br>
Proteins, oligopeptides and polypeptides are polymers of amino acids that<br>
have primary, secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure of the<br>
protein is the local conformation of the polypeptide chain and consists of helices,<br>
pleated sheets and turns. The protein's amino acid sequence and the structural<br>
constraints on the conformations of the chain determine the spatial arrangement of the<br>
molecule. The folding of the secondary structure and the spatial arrangement of the<br>
side chains constitute the tertiary structure.<br>
Proteins fold because of the dynamics associated between neighboring atoms<br>
on the protein and solvent molecules. The thermodynamics of protein folding and<br>
unfolding are defined by the free energy of a particular condition of the protein that<br>
relies on a particular model. The process of protein folding involves, amongst other<br>
things, amino acid residues packing into a hydrophobic core. The amino acid side<br>
chains inside the protein core occupy the same volume as they do in amino acid<br>
crystals. The folded protein interior is therefore more like a crystalline solid than an<br>
oil drop and so the best model for determining forces contributing to protein stability<br>
is the solid reference state.<br>
The major forces contributing to the thermodynamics of protein folding are<br>
Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions,<br>
configurational entropy and the hydrophobic effect. Considering protein stability, the<br>
hydrophobic effect refers to the energetic consequences of removing apolar groups<br>
from the protein interior and exposing them to water. Comparing the energy of amino<br>
acid hydrolysis with protein unfolding in the solid reference state, the hydrophobic<br>
effect is the dominant force. Hydrogen bonds are established during the protein fold<br>
process and intramolecular bonds are formed at the expense of hydrogen bonds With<br>
water. Water molecules are "pushed out" of the packed, hydrophobic protein core.<br>
All of these forces combine and contribute to the overall stability of the folded protein<br>
where the degree to which ideal packing occurs determines the degree of relative<br>
stability of the protein. The result of maximum packing is to produce a center of<br>
residues or hydrophobic core that has maximum shielding from solvent.<br>
Since it is likely that lipophilic drugs would reside in the hydrophobic core of<br>
a peptide, it would require energy to unfold the peptide before the drug can be<br>
released. The unfolding process requires overcoming the hydrophobic effect by<br>
hydrating the amino acids or achieving the melting temperature of the protein. The<br>
heat of hydration is a destabilization of a protein. Typically, the folded state of a<br>
protein is favored by only 5-15 kcal/mole over the unfolded state. Nonetheless,<br>
protein unfolding at neutral pH and at room temperature requires chemical reagents.<br>
In fact, partial unfolding of a protein is often observed prior to the onset of<br>
irreversible chemical or conformation processes. Moreover, protein conformation<br>
generally controls the rate and extent of deleterious chemical reactions.<br>
Conformational protection of active agents by proteins depends on the stability<br>
of the protein's folded state and the thermodynamics associated with the agent's<br>
decomposition. Conditions necessary for the agent's decomposition should be<br>
different than for protein unfolding.<br>
Selection of the amino acids will depend on the physical properties desired.<br>
For instance, if increase in bulk or lipophilicity is desired, then the carrier polypeptide<br>
will be enriched in the amino acids in the table provided below. Polar amino acids, on<br>
the other hand, can be selected to increase the hydrophilicity of the polypeptide.<br>
Ionizing amino acids can be selected for pH controlled peptide unfolding.<br>
Aspartic acid, glutamic acid and tyrosine carry a neutral charge in the stomach, but<br>
will ionize upon entry into the intestine. Conversely, basic amino acids, such as<br>
histidine, lysine and arginine, ionize in the stomach and are neutral in an alkaline<br>
environment.<br>
Other factors such as p-p interactions between aromatic residues, kinking of<br>
the peptide chain by addition of proline, disulfide crosslinking and hydrogen bonding<br>
can all be used to select the optimum amino acid sequence for a given application.<br>
Ordering of the linear sequence can influence how these interactions can be<br>
maximized and is important in directing the secondary and tertiary structures of the<br>
polypcptide.<br>
Furthermore, ainino acids with reactive side chains (e.g., glutamic acid, lysine,<br>
aspartic acid, serine, threonine and cysteine) can be incorporated for attaching<br>
multiple active agents or adjuvants to the same carrier peptide. This is particularly<br>
useful if a synergisuc effect between two or more active agents is desired.<br>
As stated above, variable molecular weights of the carrier compound can have<br>
profound effects on the active agent release kinetics. As a result, low molecular<br>
weight active agent delivery systems are preferred. An advantage of this invention is<br>
that chain length and molecular weight of the polypeptide can be optimized depending<br>
on the level of conformational protection desired. This property can be optimized in<br>
concert with the kinetics of the first order release mechanism. Thus, another<br>
advantage of this invention is that prolonged release time can be imparted by<br>
increasing the molecular weight of the carrier polypcptide. Another, significant<br>
advantage of the invention is that the kinetics of active agent release is primarily<br>
controlled by the enzymatic hydrolysis of the key bond between the carrier peptide<br>
and the active agent.<br>
Dextran is the only polysaccharide known that has been explored as a<br>
macromolecular carrier for the covalent binding of drug for colon specific drug<br>
delivery. Generally, it was only possible to load up to 1/10 of the total drug-dextran<br>
conjugate weight with drug. As stated earlier, polysaccharides are digested mainly in<br>
the colon and drug absorption is mainly limited to the colon. As compared to dextran,<br>
this invention has two major advantages. First, peptides are hydrolyzed by any one of<br>
several aminopeptidases found in the intestinal lumen or associated with the brush-<br>
border membrane and so active agent release and subsequent absorption can occur in<br>
the jejunum or the ileum. Second, the molecular weight of the carrier molecule can<br>
be controlled and, thus, active agent loading can also be controlled.<br>
As a practical example, the following table lists the molecular weights of<br>
lipophilic amino acids (less one water molecule) and selected analgesics and vitamins<br>
Lipophilic amino acids are preferred because conformational protection through the<br>
stomach is important for the selected active agents, which were selected based on ease<br>
of covalent attachment to an oligopeptide. Eighteen was subtracted from the amino<br>
acid's molecular weight so that their condensation into a polypeptide is considered.<br>
For example, a decamer of glycine (MW=588) linked to aspirin would have a total<br>
molecular weight of 750 and aspirin would represent 24% of the total weight of the<br>
active agent delivery composition or over two times the maximum drug loading for<br>
dextran. This is only for an N- or C- terminus application, for those active agents<br>
attached to pendant groups of decaglutamic acid, for instance, a drug with a molecular<br>
weight of 180 could conceivably have a loading of 58%, although this may not be<br>
entirely practical.<br>
The alcohol, amine or carboxylic acid group of the active agent is covalently<br>
attached to the N-terminus, the C-terminus or the side chain of the oligopeptide or<br>
polypeptide. The location of attachment depends somewhat on the functional group<br>
selection. For instance, if the active drug is a carboxylic acid (e.g., aspirin) then the<br>
N-terminus of the oligopeptide is the preferred point of attachment as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
If the active agent is an amine (e.g., ampicillin), then the C-terminus is the preferred<br>
point of attachment in order to achieve a stable peptide linked active agent as shown<br>
in Fig. 2. In both, the C- and N-terminus examples, the peptide is, in essence,<br>
extended by one monomeric unit forming a new peptide bond. If the active agent is<br>
an alcohol, then either the C-terminus or the N-terminus is the preferred point of<br>
attachment in order to achieve a stable composition. As in the example above where<br>
the alcohol, norethindrone, was covalently attached to poly(hydroxypropylglutamine),<br>
an alcohol can be converted into an alkylchloroformate with phosgene. This<br>
invention, then, pertains to the reaction of this key intermediate with the N-terminus<br>
of the peptide carrier as shown in Fig. 3. Figs. 1 through 3 also depict the release of<br>
the active ingredient from the peptide carrier by intestinal peptidases.<br>
The alcohol can be selectively bound to the gamma carboxylate of glutamic<br>
acid and then this conjugate covalently attached to the C-terminus of the peptide<br>
carrier. Because the glutamic acid-drug conjugate can be considered a dimer, this<br>
product adds two monomeric units to the C-terminus of the peptide carrier where the<br>
glutamic acid moiety serves as a spacer between the peptide and the drug as shown in<br>
Fig. 4. Intestinal enzymatic hydrolysis of the key peptide bond releases the glutamic<br>
acid-drug moiety from the peptide carrier. The newly formed free amine of the<br>
glutamic acid residue will then undergo an intramolecular transamination reaction,<br>
thereby, releasing the active agent with coincident formation of pyroglutamic acid as<br>
shown in Fig. 5. Alternatively, the glutamic acid-drug dimer can be converted into<br>
the gamma ester of glutamic acid N-carboxyanhydride. This intermediate can then be<br>
polymerized, as described above, using any suitable initiator as shown in Fig. 4. The<br>
product of this polymerization is polyglutamic acid with active ingredients attached to<br>
multiple pendant groups. Hence, maximum drug loading of the carrier peptide can be<br>
achieved. In addition, other amino acid-NCA's can be copolymerized with the<br>
gamma ester glutamic acid NCA to impart specific properties to the drug delivery<br>
system.<br>
The invention also provides a method of imparting the same mechanism of<br>
action for other polypeptides containing functional side chains. Examples include,<br>
but are not limited to, polylysine, polyasparagine, polyarginine, polyserine,<br>
polycysteine, polytyrosine, polythreonine and polyglutamine. The mechanism can<br>
translate to these polypeptides through a spacer or linker on the pendant group, which<br>
is terminated, preferably, by the glutamic acid-drug dimer. This carrier peptide-drug<br>
conjugate is distinguished from the prior art by virtue of the fact that the primary<br>
release of the drug moiety relies on peptidases and not on esterases. Alternatively, the<br>
active agent can be attached directly to the pendant group where some other<br>
indigenous enzymes in the alimentary tract can affect release.<br>
The active agent can be covalently attached to the N-terminus, the C-terminus<br>
or the side chain of the polypeptide using known techniques. Examples of linking<br>
organic compounds to the N-terminus type of a peptide include, but are not limited to,<br>
the attachment of naphthylacetic acid to LH-RH, coumarinic acid to opioid peptides<br>
and l,3-dialkyl-3-acyltriazenes to tetragastrin and pentagastrin. As another example,<br>
there are known techniques for forming peptide linked biotin and peptide linked<br>
acridine.<br>
The polypeptide carrier can be prepared using conventional techniques. A<br>
preferred technique is copolymerization of mixtures of amino acid N-<br>
carboxyanhydrides. Alternatively, if a specific sequence is desired, a solid state<br>
automated peptide synthesizer can be used.<br>
The addition of stabilizers to the composition has the potential of stabilizing<br>
the polypeptide further. Stabilizers such as sugar, amino acids, polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG) and salts have been shown to prevent protein unfolding. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention, a pre-first order release of the active agent is imparted<br>
by microencapsulating the carrier polypeptide-active agent conjugate in a<br>
polysaccharide, amino acid complex, PEG or salts.<br>
There is evidence that hydrophilic compounds are absorbed through the<br>
intestinal epithelia efficiently via specialized transporters. The entire membrane<br>
transport system is intrinsically asymmetric and responds asymmetrically to cofactors.<br>
Thus, one can expect that excitation of the membrane transport system will involve<br>
some sort of specialized adjuvant resulting in localized delivery of active agents.<br>
There are seven known intestinal transport systems classified according to the<br>
physical properties of the transported substrate. They include the amino acid,<br>
oligopeptide, glucose, monocarboxic acid, phosphate, bile acid and the P-glycoprotein<br>
transport systems and each has its own associated mechanism of transport. The<br>
mechanisms can depend on hydrogen ions, sodium ions, binding sites or other<br>
cofactors. The invention also allows targeting the mechanisms for intestinal epithelial<br>
transport systems to facilitate absorption of active agents.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the composition includes one or more<br>
adjuvants to enhance the bioavailability of the active agent. Addition of an adjuvant<br>
is particularly preferred when using an otherwise poorly absorbed active agent.<br>
Suitable adjuvants, for example, include: papain, which is a potent enzyme for<br>
releasing the catalytic domain of aminopeptidase-N into the lumen; glycorecognizers,<br>
which activate enzymes in the BBM; and bile acids, which have been attached to<br>
peptides to enhance absorption of the peptides.<br>
Preferably, the resultant peptide-active agent conjugate is formulated into a<br>
tablet using suitable excipients and can either be wet granulated or dry compressed.<br>
Compositions of the invention are, in essence, the formation of amides from<br>
acids and amines and can be prepared by the following examples.<br>
Acid/N-terminus conjugation (Fig. 1)<br>
An acid bioactive agent can be dissolved in DMF under nitrogen and cooled to<br>
0 °C. The solution can then be treated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole followed by the amine peptide carrier. The reaction can then be<br>
stirred for several hours at room temperature, the urea by-product filtered off, the<br>
product precipitated out in ether and purified using gel permeation chromatography<br>
(GPC) or dialysis.<br>
Amine/C-terminus conjugation (Fig. 2)<br>
The peptide carrier can be dissolved in DMF under nitrogen and cooled to 0<br>
°C. The solution can then be treated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole followed by the amine bioactive agent. The reaction can then<br>
be stirred for several hours at room temperature, the urea by-product filtered off, the<br>
product precipitated out in ether and purified using GPC or dialysis.<br>
Alcohol/N-Terminus Conjugation (Fig. 3)<br>
In the following example the combination of the alcohol with triphosgene<br>
produces a chloroformate, which when reacted with the N-terminus of the peptide<br>
produces a carbamate. Pursuant to this, an alcohol bioactive agent can be treated with<br>
triphosgene in dry DMF under nitrogen. The suitably protected peptide carrier is then<br>
added slowly and the solution stirred at room temperature for several hours. The<br>
product is then precipitated out in ether The crude product is suitably deprotected and<br>
purified using GPC.<br>
Other solvents, activating agents, cocatalysts and bases can be used.<br>
Examples of other solvents include dimethylsulfoxide, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran<br>
or chlorinated solvents such as chloroform. Examples of other activating agents<br>
include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or thionyl chloride. An example of another<br>
cocatalyst is N-hydroxysuccinimide. Examples of bases include pyrrolidinopyridine,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine or tributylamine.<br>
Preparation of ?-Alkyl Glutamate (Fig. 4)<br>
There have been over 30 different ?-alkyl glutamates prepared any one of<br>
which may be suitable for the drug alcohol of choice. For example, a suspension of<br>
glutamic acid, the alcohol and concentrated hydrochloric acid can be prepared and<br>
heated for several hours. The ?-alkyl glutamate product can be precipitated out in<br>
acetone, filtered, dried and recrystallized from hot water.<br>
?-Alkyl Glutamate/C-Terminus Conjugation (Fig. 4)<br>
The peptide carrier can be dissolved in DMF under nitrogen and cooled to 0<br>
°C. The solution can then be treated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole followed by the y-alkyl glutamate bioactive agent. The reaction<br>
can then be stirred for several hours at room temperature, the urea by-product filtered<br>
off, the product precipitated out in ether and purified using GPC or dialysis.<br>
Preparation of ?-Alkyl Glutamate-NCA<br>
?-Alkyl glutamate can be suspended in dry THF where triphosgene is added<br>
and the mixture refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere until the mixture becomes<br>
homogenous. The solution can be poured into heptane to precipitate the NCA<br>
product, which is filtered, dried and recrystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
Preparation of Poly[?-Alkyl Glutamate]<br>
?-Alkyl glutamate-NCA can be dissolved in dry DMF where a catalytic<br>
amount of a primary amine can be added to the solution until it becomes viscous<br>
(typically overnight). The product can be isolated from the solution by pouring it into<br>
water and filtering. The product can be purified using GPC or dialysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of Capped Iodothyronine Composition Comprising a Copolymer of<br>
T3 and T4 Covalently Attached to the N-terminus of Polyglutamic Acid<br>
The synthesis of polyglutamic acid is well known through a variety of reported<br>
methods. For the present examples polyglutamic acid was synthesized through the<br>
activation of the Benzyl Glutamic NCA (BnGlu-NCA) monomer. The BnGlu-NCA<br>
was then polymerized and the benzyl groups removed with hydrogen bromide. When<br>
capping polyglutamic acid, the liberation of its N-tenninus amino group from the<br>
hydrogen bromide complex without imparting unwanted nucleophilicity to the free<br>
carboxylic acids is critical. Reactions using sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
and sodium acetate produced glutamic acid/T4/T3 copolymer with the T4 and T3<br>
incorporation decreasing with increasing pKb. Sodium acetate was the preferred<br>
reagent because its pKb is between that of sodium bromide, polyglutamic acid, and<br>
sodium salt. The reaction using basic alumina kept the T4-NCA and T3-NCA intact<br>
with no apparent capping or self-polymerization. The stability of T4-NCA and T3-<br>
NCA will influence how glutamic acid/T4/T3 copolymer will be commercially<br>
manufactured. Sodium acetate can be replaced with sodium carbonate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, sodium pivalate, basic alumina, or<br>
any other weak base capable of neutralizing hydrogen bromide complexed with an<br>
amino group.<br>
The synthesis of glutamic acid/T4/T3 copolymer began with benzylglutamic<br>
acid, thyroxine, and triiodothyronine. Each of these synthons was independently<br>
reacted with triphosgene in a suitable organic solvent. The BnGlu-NCA was<br>
polymerized in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with sodium methoxide as an initiator.<br>
Polybenzylglutamic acid was deprotected with 15% hydrogen bromide in acetic acid.<br>
This product needs to be free of uncomplexed hydrogen bromide where it was<br>
dissolved in DMF and treated with sodium acetate. The previously prepared T4-NCA<br>
and T3-NCA were blended and added to the solution. The reaction was then stirred<br>
until T4-NCA or T3-NCA were no longer detected by thin layer chromatography<br>
(TLC). The final product was added to water and the precipitate was washed with<br>
water and dried in vacuo to yield a white amorphous powder.<br>
Experimentation with several weak bases revealed that a variety of sodium<br>
salts of a carboxylic acid work in capping polyglutamic acid. The reaction was tried<br>
with sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, and sodium pivalate in lieu of sodium<br>
acetate all with essentially the same result.<br>
Preparation of benzylglutamic acid-NCA<br>
Benzylglutamic acid (25 grams) was suspended in 400 mL anhydrous ethyl<br>
acetate under nitrogen. The mixture was heated to reflux where 30 grams of<br>
triphosgene was added in six (6) equal portions. The reaction was refluxed for three<br>
(3) hours until homogenous. The solution was cooled to room temperature, filtered,<br>
and concentrated in vacuo. The white powder was recrystallized from 50 mL of hot<br>
anhydrous ethyl acetate to yield 17.4 grams (63%) of a white powder.<br>
Preparation of T4-NCA<br>
In a round bottom flask fitted with a nitrogen inlet, five grams of thyroxine was stirred<br>
with 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1.3 grams of triphosgene and the mixture<br>
refluxed for four (4) hours until homogenous. The solution was cooled to room<br>
temperature, and added dropwise to 200 mL of heptane with stirring. The crystals<br>
were filtered and dried in vacuo to yield 4.72 grams (91%) of an off-white powder.<br>
Preparation of T3-NCA<br>
In a round bottom flask fitted with a nitrogen inlet, 4.29 grams of<br>
triiodothyronine was stirred with 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1.45 grams of<br>
triphosgene and the mixture refluxed for four (4) hours until homogenous. The<br>
solution was cooled to room temperature and added dropwise to 200 ml of heptane<br>
with stirring. The liquid was decanted off the yellow gum, which was recrystallized,<br>
from anhydrous ethyl acetate and hexanes to yield 2.5 grams (56%) of a white powder<br>
that was dried under high vacuum.<br>
Preparation of polybenzylglutamic acid<br>
Benzylglutamic acid (17.4 grams) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran<br>
(THF) under nitrogen where 238 mg of sodium methoxide was added portionwise.<br>
The solution was stirred for two (2) days with a marked increase in viscosity. The<br>
solution was poured into 1.5 L of petroleum ether with stirring. The petroleum ether<br>
was decanted off and an additional 1L of petroleum ether was added back. The<br>
mixture was stirred by hand, the petroleum ether was decanted off and the process<br>
repeated with 500 mL of petroleum ether. The white solid was air dried and then<br>
vacuum dried to yield 14.7 (95%) of a white fluffy paper-like solid.<br>
Preparation of polyglutamic acid<br>
Acetic acid (l0mL) was stirred with 0 roL 30wt% hydrogen bromide (HBr) in<br>
acetic acid where 1.96 of polybenzylglutamic acid was added by hand. The mixture<br>
was stirred at room temperature for one day and was, then, added to 50 mL of ether.<br>
The white precipitant was filtered, washed with 4 x 30 mL of ether and dried under a<br>
high vacuum to yield 1.11 grams (97%) of a white powder.<br>
Preparation of glutamic acid/TVT3 copolymer<br>
Polyglutamic acid (375 mg) was dissolved in dry 3 mL DMF. Sodium acetate (24<br>
mg) was added followed by a blend of 105 mg of T4-NCA and 8 mg of T3-NCA. The<br>
solution was stirred for two (2) days where TLC showed the absence of thyronine<br>
starting materials. The solution was poured into 30 mL of water and cooled 10 °C<br>
overnight. The precipitant was filtered, washed with water, and dried under high<br>
vacuum to yield 413 mg (85%) of light beige powder. The proton NMR revealed a<br>
copolymer of T3 and T4 covalently attached to the N-terminus of polyglutamic acid,<br>
which was virtually completely digested by the pronase enzyme system in two hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of Peptide Polymers<br>
Polyaspartic acid: Asp(OtBu) (13mg, 0.07mmol) and Asp(OtBu)-NCA<br>
(200mg, 0.93 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5ml), and the solution<br>
allowed to stir over night at room temperature under argon. The following morning,<br>
2.5 ml of the reaction mixture was transferred to separate flask (Flask B). T4-NCA<br>
(27mg, 0.03mmol) was added to the original flask (Flask A), and both solutions were<br>
allowed to continue stirring under argon for an additional 24 hours. Polymer was<br>
then precipitated by the addition of water (50ml) to each flask. The resulting solids<br>
were collected by filtration and dried over night under vacuum.<br>
The dried Asp(OtBu)n (Flask B) and T4-Asp(OtBu)n (Flask A) were then<br>
dissolved in 95% trifluoroacetic acid in water (3ml) and allowed to stir at room<br>
temperature for 2 hours. The deprotected polymers were then precipitated by the<br>
addition of ethyl ether (10ml) and then storing the suspension at 4 °C for 2 hours. The<br>
respective polymers were then collected by filtration and the solids dried over night<br>
under vacuum. This afforded 48mg of Aspn (Flask B) and 12mg of T4-Aspn (Flask<br>
A). MALDI indicated that T4-Aspn (Flask A) consisted of a mixture of polymers of<br>
varying lengths: T4-Asp3-12.<br>
Polyserine and Polythreonine were also prepared using this protocol. The<br>
serine reaction mixture contained N-methylmorpholine (1.1 equivalents).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of (Glu)n-Cephalexin<br>
Glu(OtBu)NCA (1.000 g, 4.4mmol) and Cephalexin•HCl (0.106g, 0.3mmol)<br>
were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5ml). The reaction was then allowed to stir at<br>
room temperature under argon. After 3 days, the solvent was removed by rotary-<br>
evaporation under vacuum. The resulting solid was then placed under argon and then<br>
dissolved in 4N HC1 in Dioxane (2ml) and then allowed to stir at room temperature<br>
under a blanket of argon. After 1 hour, the dioxane and HC1 were removed by rotary-<br>
evaporation under vacuum. The solid was then suspended in methanol (2ml) and<br>
once more brought to dryness by rotary-evaporation in order to remove residual HC1<br>
and dioxane. This material was then resuspended in methanol (2ml) and precipitated<br>
by the addition of water (20ml). The aqueous suspension was then stored at 4°C for 4<br>
hours, and the solid isolated by centrifugation. The pelleted material was then<br>
allowed to dry under vacuum over night. This process afforded a mixture of (Glu)n<br>
and (Glu)n-cephalexin (464mg) as determined by MALDI. MALDI indicates a<br>
mixture of polymers (Glu)7-13 and (Glu)5-14 cephalexin. Other chain-lengths may be<br>
present but they are not clearly visible in the MALDI spectra. Reversed-phase HPLC<br>
(265nm detection, C18 column, l6%MeOH/4%TBDF/80%water mobile phase)<br>
indicated that no free cephalexin was present in the isolated material. "Water" in the<br>
HPLC actually refers to an aqueous buffer of 0.1% heptanesulfonic acid and 1.5%<br>
triethylamine.<br>
3-Methyl-naItrexone: Naltrexone (6.0 g, 16.5 mmol) was dissolved in 100 ml<br>
distilled water. The solution was titrated with 1N NaOH to a final pH of 11.8. la the<br>
course of the titration, neutral naltrexone precipitated from solution and then went<br>
back into solution. Upon reaching pH 11.8, the solvent was removed by rotary-<br>
evaporation under high vacuum, and the resulting solid stored under vacuum over<br>
night at room temperature.. The solid was then suspended/dissolved in anhydrous<br>
tetrahydrofuran (200 ml) and allowed to stir at room temperature under argon. A<br>
solution of iodomethane (2.1 mg, 33 mmol) in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added<br>
dropwise over the course 30 minutes. The reaction was then allowed to stir an<br>
additional 3 hours at room temperature under argon. The solvent was then removed<br>
by rotary-evaporation under reduced pressure. The residual solid was then dissolved<br>
in 40 ml of CHCI3 and the organic solution washed with 30 ml of saturated NaCl,<br>
3x30 ml of IN NaOH and finally twice more with 30 ml saturated aqueous NaCl.<br>
The organic solution was collected and dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of<br>
solvent by rotary-evaporation and drying over night under vacuum afforded pure 3-<br>
methylnaltrexone (5.6g, 15.8 mmol, 96% yield) as a brown residue and composition<br>
determined by TLC and 'H-NMR. Features used to identify the compound by<br>
comparison to the spectrum of naltrexone: 'H-NMR (360 MHz, CDCI3) 5 6.677 (d,<br>
1H, naltrexone aromatic), 6.591 (d, 1H, naltrexone aromatic), 3.874 (s, 3H, methoxy<br>
group.), 0.6-0.5 ppm (m, 2H, naltrexone cyclopropyl) and 0.2-0.1 ppm (m, 2H,<br>
naltrexone cyclopropyl).<br>
Boc-Glu(NaI)-OtBu: The solids Boc-Glu-OtBu (0.96g, 3.18mmol), naltrexone<br>
(l.00g, 2.65mmol) and PyBrop (1.73g, 3.71mmol) were dissolved in 5 ml of<br>
anhydrous DMF and stirred at room temperature under argon. Dry N-<br>
methylmorpholine (1.08ml, 9.81mmol) was added and the reaction allowed to<br>
continue stirring at room temperature under argon. After two days additional Boc-<br>
Glu-OtBu (0.096g, 0.32mmol), PyBrop (0.173g, 0.37mmol) and N-methylmorpholine<br>
(0.10ml, 0.981mmol) were added. After 2 more days, the solvent was removed by<br>
rotary-evaporation under high vacuum. The resulting residue was then dissolved in<br>
CHCI3, and the resulting organic solution extracted with 2x20 ml of saturated NaCl,<br>
3x20 ml of 10% Na2CO3 and a final wash with 20 ml saturated aqueous NaCl. The<br>
organic solution was collected, dried over sodium sulfate and then adsorbed onto<br>
silica. Pure naltrexone conjugated amino acid (0.486g, 0.78mmol, 29%) was then<br>
isolated by flash chromatography and a gradient of 0-1.5% CH3OH in CHCl3. The<br>
purity of the isolated material was determined by TLC (6:1 CH3OH/CHCl3), and the<br>
presence of both the amino acid moiety and the naltrexone were confirmed by 1H-<br>
NMR. Indicative protons: 1H-NMR (360 MHz, CDCl3) 5 6.81 (d, 1H, naltrexone<br>
aromatic), 6.63 (d, 1H, naltrexone aromatic), 4.3-4.2 (m, 1H, glutamic acid a-proton),<br>
1.7-1.3 (pair of bs, 18H, Boc and OtBu groups.), 0.6-0.4 ppm (m, 2H, naltrexone<br>
cyclopropyl) and 0.2-0.0 ppm (m, 2H, naltrexone cyclopropyl).<br>
Boc-Asp(Nal)-OtBu: Boc-Asp(Nal)-OtBu was obtained in 41% isolate yield using a<br>
similar protocol. Indicative protons: !H-NMR (360 MHz, CDC13): 5 6.84 (d, 1H,<br>
naltrexone aromatic), 6.66 (d, 1H, naltrexone aromatic), 4.6-4.5 (m, 1H, aspartic acid<br>
a-proton), 1.6-1.3 (pair of bs, 18H, Boc and OtBu groups.), 0.7-0.5 ppm (m, 2H,<br>
naltrexone cyclopropyl) and 0.4-0.1 ppm (m, 2H, naltrexone cyclopropyl).<br>
NMR characterization:<br>
While naltrexone has a complex NMR spectrum, there are several key protons that<br>
have distinct chemical shifts and are unique to naltrexone.<br>
Poly-Glu(Acyclovir)<br>
To a solution of poly-glujs (0.600g, 0.310mmol) in DMF (25ml) was added<br>
EDCI (2.07g, 10.8mmol). The resulting mixture was allowed to stir at ambient<br>
temperature for one hour. Then, N-methyl morpholine (0.51ml, 4.7mmol) was added<br>
followed by a mixture of acyclovir (1.74g, 7.75mmol), DMF (25ml) and N-methyl<br>
morpholine (0.85ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4<br>
days. After this, water (50ml) was added and all solvent was removed. To the dried<br>
mixture was added water (100ml) and a precipitate of unreacted acyclovir formed.<br>
Solid was centrifuged and the supernate was purified using ultrafiltration (YM1<br>
membrane). Approximately 300ml water was allowed to pass through the membrane.<br>
NMR has shown an unexpected alkyl-urea side chain attached impurity. Poly-<br>
glu(acyclovir) (0.970g) was obtained as a light yellow solid: 1H NMR (D2O) 8 1.11<br>
(br m, 4H, urea), 2.01 (br m, 2H, Glu-b H), 2.39 (br m, 2H, Glu-?H), 2.72 (br m, 2H,<br>

added (0.03ml, 0.24mmol). After stirring for 10 minutes, a solution of fexofenadine<br>
(O.lOOg, 0.20mmol), N-methyl morpholine (0.07ml, 0.60mmol) and DMF (5ml) was<br>
added via a syringe. After stirring reaction at ambient temperatures for three days,<br>
sample was dissolved in water (25ml). A solid precipitate formed which was bom<br>
drug-conjugate and free fexofenadine. Water was acidified and all solids dissolved.<br>
Purification using ultrafiltration (YM1 followed by YM3) and size exclusion<br>
chromatography using Sephadex-25 at pH 7 yielded poly-glu(fexofenadine) (O.OlOg)<br>
as a white solid: 1H NMR (D2O) 8 1.37 (s, 8H, fex. CH2 and CH3), 1.58 (br m, 5H,<br>

To a solution of poly-glu15 (0.123g, 0.060mmol) in DMF (8ml) was added<br>
EDCI (0.403g, 2.10mmol). After 30 minutes, N-methyl morpholine (0.13ml,<br>
1.2mmol) was added. After 35 minutes, a solution of zalcitabine (0.200g, 0.95mmol),<br>
N-methyl morpholine (0.10ml, 0.9mmol) and DMF (2ml) was added via a syringe.<br>
The resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 48 hours. Solvent was<br>
removed and the residue was dissolved in water (15ml). Ultrafiltration (YM1<br>
followed with YM3) and size exclusion using Sephadex-25 at pH 7 yielded poly-<br>
glu(zalcitabine) (0.083g) as a light yellow solid: 1H NMR (DMSO-d6 w/D20) 5 1.14<br>

(br s, 1H, zalcitabine 6 CH).<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Poly-G)u(Stavudine)<br>
Preparation was similar to poly-glu(zalcitabine). Purification using<br>

Reaction was then filtered, neutralized with NaHCO3 (sat) and filtered again.<br>
Dioxane and water were removed and the residue was taken up in CHCl3 and<br>
extracted with water (3X100ml). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and<br>
solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Crude product was purified over<br>

DMF is dimethylfonnamide, anhydrous, and was purchased from Aldrich.<br>
Glassware was oven-dried prior to use.<br>
1. Glu-NCA (500 mg, 2.89 mmoles) was dissolved in 4 mL of DMF and stirred<br>
under Ar in a 15 mL roundbottom flask equipped with a gas inlet tube.<br>
2. Atenolol, dissolved in 1 mL of DMF, was added to this solution of Glu-NCA<br>
and allowed to stir at room temperature for 72 h. In general, the reactions can<br>
be run until there is no free amine initiator by tic. For this reaction, tic was<br>
run using silica plates and eluting with 20% methanol in ethyl acetate.<br>
3. The reaction was quenched by pouring into 20 mL of 10% sodium bicarbonate<br>
in water (pH = 8).<br>
4. The water was washed with 3 X 20 mL of methylene chloride and 3 X 20 mL<br>
of ethyl acetate.<br>
5. Combined aqueous layers were brought to a pH of 6 with 6N HC1 and reduced<br>
to a volume of about 20 mL by rotary evaporation. This solution was then<br>
cooled in the refrigerator for &gt; 3 hours.<br>
6. To precipitate the polymeric product, the aqueous solution was then acidified<br>
to a pH of about 2 using 6N HC1 and placed back in the refrigerator for 1-2<br>
hours.<br>
7. The suspension was poured by portions into a 10 mL test tube and centrifuged<br>
for 15 minutes until the precipitate formed a solid pack at the bottom of the<br>
tube from which the water could be decanted. (At this point in the general<br>
procedure, it is preferable that the solid be filtered through a filter runnel and<br>
washed with acidic water. The centrifuge was used for atenolol because the<br>
solid was too thin to filter.)<br>
8. The solid was then resuspended in acidic water (pH about 2) and vortexed<br>
before being centrifuged again and the water decanted. This procedure was<br>
repeated once more for a total of three washes.<br>
9. The solid was then dried by high vacuum overnight yielding 262 mg (59%) of<br>
polymer. NMR analysis indicated that the Glu/Atenolol ratio was about 30/1.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
Monolayers of Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells are increasingly being used to<br>
predict the absorption of orally delivered drugs. We used the Caco-2 transwell system<br>
and other in vitro assays to evaluate the performance of Polythroid. Our findings<br>
indicate that Polythroid may enhance oral delivery of thyroid hormones for the<br>
treatment of hypothyroid disorders.<br>
J3V VITRO PERFORMANCE<br>
Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cell assay<br>
Caco-2 cells are grown on the surface of collagen coated wells in a 24 well format to<br>
form confluent monolayers that represent small segments of the intestine. The wells<br>
are removable and contain a top chamber representing the apical side (facing the<br>
lumen of the intestine) and a bottom chamber representing the basolateral side (site of<br>
serosal drug absorption). The integrity of the epithelial barrier is monitored by testing<br>
the electrical resistance across the monolayer. Absorption of drugs can be studied by<br>
adding sample to the apical side and assaying the concentration of the drug in the<br>
basolateral chamber following incubation.<br>
Intestinal epithelial cell proteases digest Polythroid<br>
Polythroid is a synthetic polymer of glutamic acid with T4 and T3 covalently attached<br>
by a peptide bond linkage. The polymer is the delivery vehicle for the thyroid<br>
hormones and is not designed to cross the intestinal barrier itself. Rather, it is<br>
designed to release T4 and T3 in a time dependent manner. Release of the thyroid<br>
hormones is dependent on the enzymatic cleavage of the glutamic acid polymer. In<br>
theory, this will result from Polythroid encountering proteolytic enzymes as it<br>
descends the intestinal tract. Proteins are digested into small polypeptides by gastric<br>
pepsin and pancreatic enzymes secreted into the small intestine. Intestinal epithelial<br>
cells then function to further breakdown the small polypeptides. They accomplish this<br>
with proteolytic enzymes referred to as brush border proteases that are attached to the<br>
cell surface.<br>
Monitoring the effect of brush border peptidases on Polythroid required<br>
development of an assay to specifically distinguish Polythroid from polyglutamic acid<br>
and the thyroid hormones. Therefore, we developed an enzyme-linked<br>
immunosorbent assay (ELIS A) that specifically recognizes Polythroid. The assay<br>
employs antibodies against the glutamic acid polymer to capture Polythroid and<br>
antibodies to T4 or T3 to detect the presence of Polythroid. The assay has no cross-<br>
reactivity with polyglutamic acid or the thyroid hormones themselves. Consequently,<br>
proteolytic degradation of Polythroid results in T4 and T3 release from the polymer<br>
and a corresponding decrease in ELK A reactivity. The Polythroid specific ELJSA<br>
can, therefore, be used to monitor the breakdown of Polythroid.<br>
The Polythroid specific assay was used to analyze in situ digestion of<br>
Polythroid in Caco-2 cell cultures. Different concentrations of Polythroid were added<br>
to the apical side of Caco-2 cells and incubated for 4 hours in PBS at 37°C (n=4). The<br>
apical side Polythroid concentration was measured by Polythroid specific ELIS A<br>
before and after the 4 hour incubation (Fig. 6). At the relatively high concentration of<br>
100 micrograms, 26% of Polythroid was degraded, whereas at a 10-fold lower<br>
concentration 84% of the Polythroid was degraded. When a concentration of 0.5<br>
micrograms was added (closer to the concentrations that would be encountered by the<br>
intestine in a normal human dose) the amount of Polythroid remaining after 4 hours of<br>
incubation was below the limit of detection for the ELISA (10 ng) indicating<br>
essentially complete digestion. The loss of Polymer in the apical chamber was not due<br>
to absorption of Polythroid across the monolayer since the basolateral chamber<br>
contained no detectable Polythroid in any of the experiments (see below). We cannot<br>
rule out cellular uptake of Polythroid, however, enzymatic digestion is likely to<br>
account for most, if not all, of the decrease in Polythroid concentration on the apical<br>
side. At the higher concentrations, it would be difficult for cellular uptake to account<br>
for such a large difference in the remaining Polythroid.<br>
Polythroid enhances absorption of T4 across Caco-2 monolayers<br>
Absorption of T4 was monitored in the Caco-2 transwell system (n=4).<br>
Polythroid (10 micrograms) was added to the apical side of the transwells. T4<br>
was added to the apical side at a concentration equal to the T4 content of<br>
Polythroid. A commercial ELISA for T4 was used to determine the level of T4 in<br>
the basolateral chamber following incubation for 4 hours at 37°C (Fig. 7). A<br>
significantly higher amount of T4 was absorbed from Polythroid as compared to<br>
CaCo-2 cells incubated with the amount of T4 equivalent to that contained in the<br>
polymer.<br>
Polythroid does not cross Caco-2 monolayers<br>
In order to determine if Polythroid itself crosses the Caco-2 monolayer we used the<br>
Polythroid specific ELIS A to measure the amount of polymer in the basolateral<br>
chamber after incubation with Polythroid at a high concentration (100 micrograms).<br>
After 4 hours incubation, samples (n=4) from the basolateral side showed no<br>
reactivity in the ELISA (Fig. 8). The limit of detection for Polythroid is 10 ng,<br>
therefore, less than 1/10,000 of the Polythroid was absorbed. In conclusion, within the<br>
limits of ELISA detection, Polythroid does not cross the Caco-2 monolayer.<br>
Digestion of Polythroid in gastric and intestinal simulators<br>
Pepsin secreted by the gastric mucosa is the only protease active in the acid conditions<br>
of the stomach. The pancreas secretes a number of proteolytic enzymes into the<br>
intestine which degrade proteins and polypeptides. In theory, these endogenous<br>
proteases will participate in release of T4 and T3 from Polythroid as the polymer<br>
descends the intestinal tract.<br>
We tested Polythroid in the USP gastric simulator and the USP intestinal simulator<br>
and compared the levels of digestion for Polythroid synthesized by different methods.<br>
The samples of Polythroid varied in the position of thyroid hormone attachment.<br>
Samples were dissolved in gastric simulator buffer containing pepsin or in intestinal<br>
simulator buffer containing pancreatic enzyme extract (pancreatin) and incubated for<br>
24 hours at 37°C. Following digestion, samples were analyzed by HPLC for the<br>
content of released monomeric T4 and T3. Figures 9and 10 show the levels of T4 and<br>
T3 following digestion in the gastric and intestinal simulators. Release varied<br>
depending on the position of thyroid hormone attachment. Polythroid with T4 and T3<br>
attached at the C-terminus (C-capped) showed the highest level of digestion. On the<br>
other hand, Polythroid with N-terminal attachment (N-capped) showed no digestion in<br>
the gastric simulator and a relatively low amount of digestion in the intestinal<br>
simulator. Polythroid with random attachment showed only marginal digestion in the<br>
gastric simulator and moderate digestion in the intestinal simulator. In conclusion, the<br>
rate of thyroid hormone release from Polythroid varies depending on the method of<br>
synthesis. This provides a potential means of controlling (fine tuning) time release of<br>
oral delivery.<br>
Conclusions and Summary<br>
The following conclusions can be drawn from in vitro performance assays:<br>
• T4 and T3 are released from Polythroid by pancreatic and intestinal cell proteases<br>
• T4 and T3 released from Polythroid are absorbed across intestinal monolayers<br>
• Polythroid enhances absorption of T4 across intestinal epithelium in vitro<br>
• Polythroid itself does not cross the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro<br>
• The kinetics of time release may be controlled by the method of Polythroid<br>
synthesis<br>
Covalent attachment of T4 and T3 to a polypeptide affords a number of<br>
potential advantages to oral delivery for thyroid hormone replacement therapy.<br>
Proteolytic enzymes produced by the pancreas and intestinal epithelial cells release<br>
T4 and T3 from Polythroid. Therefore, T4 and T3 should be released in a time<br>
dependent manner as they descend the intestinal tract. Once released the hormones are<br>
absorbed across the intestinal epithelium in the Caco-2 cell model. In addition, data<br>
from the in vitro intestinal epithelial model suggests that attachment of T4 to<br>
polymers of glutamic acid may enhance absorption of the thyroid hormones, perhaps<br>
by providing a second mechanism of uptake and/or enhancing solubility of the<br>
hormones. Polythroid itself does not cross the intestinal epithelial barrier in the in<br>
vitro Caco-2 model. Thus, any concerns about systemic effects of the polymer are<br>
minimized since it should not be absorbed into the bloodstream.<br>
Although illustrated and described above with reference to specific<br>
embodiments, the invention is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details<br>
