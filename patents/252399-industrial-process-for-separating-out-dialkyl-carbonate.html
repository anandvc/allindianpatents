				<td>INDUSTRIAL PROCESS FOR SEPARATING OUT DIALKYL CARBONATE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for subjecting a low<br>
boiling point reaction mixture containing a large amount of a dialkyl<br>
carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric alcohol produced through a<br>
reactive distillation process from a cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol to separation by distillation into a column top<br>
component BT having the aliphatic monohydric alcohol as a main<br>
component thereof and a column bottom component BB having the dialkyl<br>
carbonate as a main component thereof stably for a prolonged period of<br>
time industrially.<br>
Background Art<br>
A reactive distillation process for producing a dialkyl carbonate<br>
and a diol through reaction between a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol was first disclosed by the present inventors (see<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
H4-198141. Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. H4-230243. Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. H9-176061. Patent Document 4: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. H9-183744 Patent Document 5: Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No.H9-194435. Patent Document 6:<br>
International Publication No. W097/23445 (corresponding to European<br>
Patent No. 0889025, U.S. Patent No.5847189). Patent Document 7:<br>
International Publication No. W099/64382 (corresponding to European<br><br>
Patent No. 1086940, U.S. Patent No.6346638). Patent Document 8:<br>
International Publication No. WO00/51954 (corresponding to European<br>
Patent No. 1174406, U.S. Patent No.6479689). Patent Document 9:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-308804 and Patent<br>
Document 10: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-131394),<br>
patent applications in which such a reactive distillation system is used<br>
have subsequently also been filed by other companies (see Patent<br>
Document 11: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H5-213830<br>
(corresponding to European Patent No. 0530615, U.S. Patent<br>
No.5231212). Patent Document 12: Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. H6-9507 (corresponding to European Patent No. 0569812,<br>
U.S. Patent No.5359118). Patent Document 13: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2003-119168 (International Publication No.<br>
WO03/006418). Patent Document 14: Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open No. 2003-300936 and Patent Document 15: Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2003-342209). In the case of using a<br>
reactive distillation system for this reaction, the reaction can be made to<br>
proceed with a high conversion. However, reactive distillation<br>
processes proposed hitherto have related to producing the dialkyl<br>
carbonate and the diol either in small amounts or for a short period of<br>
time, and have not related to carrying out the production on an industrial<br>
scale stably for a prolonged period of time. That is, these processes<br>
have not attained the object of producing a dialkyl carbonate<br>
continuously in a large amount (e.g. not less than 2 ton / hr) stably for a<br>
prolonged period of time (e.g. not less than 1000 hours, preferably not<br>
less than 3000 hours, more preferably not less than 5000 hours).<br><br>
For example, the maximum values of the height (H: cm), diameter<br>
(D: cm), and number of stages (n)'of the reactive distillation column, the<br>
produced amount P (kg / hr) of dimethyl carbonate, and the continuous<br>
production time T (hr) in examples disclosed for the production of<br>
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene glycol (EG) from ethylene<br>
carbonate and methanol are as in Table 1.<br><br><br>
described above, and was carried out with the object of operating a<br>
commercial scale apparatus for producing dimethyl carbonate and<br>
ethylene glycol through transesterification by a catalytic conversion<br>
reaction between ethylene carbonate and methanol. Note that the<br>
following numerical values in the present example can be adequately<br>
used in the operation of an actual apparatus", and as that example it is<br>
stated that 3750 kg / hr of dimethyl carbonate was specifically produced.<br>
The scale described in that example corresponds to an annual production<br>
of 30,000 tons or more, and hence this implies that at the time of the<br>
filing of the patent application for Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936) (April 9, 2002), operation of the<br>
world's first large scale commercial plant using this process had been<br>
carried out. However, even at the time of filing the present application,<br>
there is not the above fact at all. Moreover, in the example of Patent<br>
Document 14 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936),<br>
exactly the same value as the theoretically calculated value is stated for<br>
the amount of dimethyl carbonate produced, but the yield for ethylene<br>
glycol is approximately 85.6%, and the selectivity is approximately 88.4%,<br>
and hence it cannot really be said that a high yield and high selectivity<br>
have been attained. In particular, the low selectivity indicates that this<br>
process has a fatal drawback as an industrial production process. (Note<br>
also that Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
No. 2003-300936) was deemed to have been withdrawn on July 26, 2005<br>
due to examination not having been requested).<br>
With the reactive distillation method, there are very many causes<br>
of fluctuation such as composition variation due to reaction and<br><br>
composition variation due to distillation in the distillation column, and<br>
temperature variation and pressure variation in the column, and hence<br>
continuing stable operation for a prolonged period of time is<br>
accompanied by many difficulties, and in particular these difficulties are<br>
further increased in the case of handling large amounts. To continue<br>
mass production of a dialkyl carbonate and a diol using the reactive<br>
distillation method stably for a prolonged period of time while maintaining<br>
high yields and high selectivities for the dialkyl carbonate and the diol,<br>
the reactive distillation apparatus must be cleverly devised. However,<br>
the only description of continuous stable production for a prolonged<br>
period of time with the reactive distillation method proposed hitherto has<br>
been the 200 to 400 hours in Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. H4-198141) and Patent Document 2<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H4-230243).<br>
The present inventors have now established an industrial reactive<br>
distillation process that enables a dialkyl carbonate and a diol to be<br>
mass-produced continuously and stably for a prolonged period of time<br>
with high yield and high selectivity, but to achieve this it has also been<br>
necessary to establish an industrial process for separating out the<br>
desired dialkyl carbonate from a low boiling point reaction mixture<br>
continuously withdrawn in a large amount from an upper portion of the<br>
reactive distillation column. The present invention has been devised to<br>
attain this object.<br>
As shown in Table 1, with the exception of Patent Document 14<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936), the produced<br>
amount of the dialkyl carbonate per hour using reactive distillation<br><br>
processes proposed hitherto has been a small amount of not more than 1<br>
kg / hr. Moreover, with the process of Patent Document 14 (Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936), a column top<br>
component (a mixture of methanol and dimethyl carbonate) from a first<br>
step reactive distillation column is fed into a second step distillation<br>
column, and extractive distillation is carried out using ethylene carbonate.<br>
After a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate has been<br>
obtained as a column bottom component from the second step distillation<br>
column, this mixture is then further fed into a third step distillation<br>
column, and separation by distillation is carried out so as to obtain<br>
dimethyl carbonate as a column top component and ethylene carbonate<br>
as a column bottom component from the third step distillation column.<br>
That is, with the process of Patent Document 14 (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2003-300936), two columns must be used to<br>
separate the dimethyl carbonate out from the mixture of methanol and<br>
dimethyl carbonate, and hence the equipment is expensive.<br>
Furthermore, with this process, four distillation columns must be<br>
operated together with one another, and hence it is expected that<br>
prolonged stable operation would be difficult.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a specific<br>
apparatus and process for using a single distillation column on a loboiling point reaction mixture containing a large amount of a dialkyl<br>

component BT having the aliphatic monohydric alcohol as a main<br>
component thereof and a column bottom component BB having the dialkyl<br>
carbonate as a main component thereof stably for a prolonged period of<br>
time industrially. Moreover, it is an object to provide such a specific<br>
apparatus and process that are inexpensive and enable the dialkyl<br>
carbonate to be separated out by distillation in an amount of, for example,<br>
not less than 2 ton / hr stably for a prolonged period of time (e.g. not less<br>

not less than 5000 hours).<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Following is a detailed description of the present invention.<br><br>
The reaction of the present invention is a reversible equilibrium<br>
transesterification reaction represented by following formula in which a<br>
dialkyl carbonate and a diol are produced from a cyclic carbonate and an<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol;<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a bivalent group -(CH2)m- (m is an integer from 2<br>
to 6), one or more of the hydrogens thereof being optionally substituted<br>
with an alkyl group or aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Moreover,<br>
R2 represents a monovalent aliphatic group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
one or more of the hydrogens thereof being optionally substituted with an<br>
alkyl group or aryl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The cyclic carbonate used as a starting material in the present<br>
invention is a compound represented by (A) in the above formula. For<br>
example, an alkylene carbonate such as ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate, or 1,3-dioxacyclohexa-2-one, 1,3-dioxacyclohepta-2-one, or<br>
the like can be preferably used, ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate being more preferably used due to ease of procurement and<br>
so on, and ethylene carbonate being particularly preferably used.<br>
Moreover, the aliphatic monohydric alcohol used as the other<br>
starting material is a compound represented by (B) in the above formula.<br>
An aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a lower boiling point than that of<br>
the diol produced is used. Although possibly varying depending on the<br><br>
type of the cyclic carbonate used, examples are thus methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol (isomers), allyl alcohol, butanol (isomers), 3-buten-1-ol, amyl<br>
alcohol (isomers), hexyl alcohol (isomers), heptyl alcohol (isomers), octyl<br>
alcohol (isomers), nonyl alcohol (isomers), decyl alcohol (isomers),<br>
undecyl alcohol (isomers), dodecyl alcohol (isomers), cyclopentanol,<br>
cyclohexanol, cycloheptanol, cyclooctanol, methylcyclopentanol<br>
(isomers), ethylcyclopentanol (isomers), methylcyclohexanol (isomers),<br>
ethylcyclohexanol (isomers), dimethylcyclohexanol.(isomers),<br>
diethylcyclohexanol (isomers), phenylcyclohexanol (isomers), benzyl<br>
alcohol, phenethyl alcohol (isomers), phenylpropanol (isomers), and so<br>
on. Furthermore, these aliphatic monohydric alcohols may be<br>
substituted with substituents such as halogens, lower alkoxy groups,<br>
cyano groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups, aryloxycarbonyl groups, acyloxy<br>
groups, and nitro groups.<br>
Of such aliphatic monohydric alcohols, ones preferably used are<br>
alcohols having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably alcohols having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. methanol, ethanol, propanol (isomers), and<br>
butanol (isomers). In the case of using ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate as the cyclic carbonate, preferable aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohols are methanol and ethanol, methanol being particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, a<br>
homogeneous catalyst is made to be present in the reactive distillation<br>
column A. The method of making the homogeneous catalyst be present<br>
may be any method, but it is preferable to feed the catalyst into the<br>
reactive distillation column A continuously so as to make the catalyst be<br><br>
present in a liquid phase in the reactive distillation column A.<br>
In the case that the homogeneous catalyst is continuously fed into<br>
the reactive distillation column A, the homogeneous catalyst may be fed<br>
in together with the cyclic carbonate and / or the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol, or may be fed in at a different position to the starting materials.<br>
The reaction actually proceeds in the distillation column A in a region<br>
below the position at which the catalyst is fed in, and hence it is<br>
preferable to feed the catalyst into a region between the top of the<br>
column and the position(s) at which the starting materials are fed in.<br>
The catalyst must be present in at least 5 stages, preferably at least 7<br>
stages, more preferably at least 10 stages.<br>

In the case that the compound used dissolves in a starting<br>
material of the reaction, the reaction mixture, a reaction by-product or<br>
the like, the compound can be used as the homogeneous catalyst as is.<br>
Alternatively, it is also preferable to use, as the homogeneous catalyst, a<br>
mixture obtained by dissolving a compound as above in a starting<br>
material of the reaction, the reaction mixture, a reaction by-product or<br>
the like in advance, or by reacting to bring about dissolution.<br><br>
An amount of the catalyst used in the present invention varies<br>
depending on the type of the catalyst used, but is generally in a range of<br>
from 0.0001 to 50 % by weight, preferably from 0.005 to 20 % by weight,<br>
more preferably from 0.01 to 10 % by weight, as a proportion of the total<br>
weight of the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol fed in<br>
as the starting materials.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method of continuously<br>
feeding the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol into a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column A constituting the reactive<br>
distillation column in the present invention; any feeding method may be<br>
used so long as the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol can be made to contact the catalyst in a region of at least 5<br>
stages, preferably at least 7 stages, more preferably at least 10 stages,<br>
of the distillation column A. That is, the cyclic carbonate and the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol can be continuously fed in from a required<br>
number of inlets in stages of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column A satisfying the conditions described earlier. Moreover, the<br>
cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol may be introduced<br>
into the same stage of the distillation column, or may be introduced into<br>
different stages to one another.<br>
The starting materials are fed continuously into the distillation<br>
column A in a liquid form, in a gaseous form, or as a mixture of a liquid<br>
and a gas. Other than feeding the starting materials into the distillation<br>
column A in this way, it is also preferable to additionally feed in a<br>
gaseous starting material intermittently or continuously from a lower<br>
portion of the distillation column A. Moreover, another preferable<br><br>
method is one in which the cyclic carbonate is continuously fed in a liquid<br>
form or a gas / liquid mixed form into a stage of the distillation column<br>
above the stages in which the catalyst is present, and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol is continuously fed in a gaseous form and/ or a<br>
liquid form into the lower portion of the distillation column. In this case,<br>
the cyclic carbonate may of course contain the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol.<br>
In the present invention, the starting materials fed in may contain<br>
the product dialkyl carbonate and / or diol. The content thereof is, for<br>
the dialkyl carbonate, generally in a range of from 0 to 40 % by weight,<br>
preferably from 0 to 30 % by weight, more preferably from 0 to 20 % by<br>
weight, in terms of the percentage by mass of the dialkyl carbonate in the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol / dialkyl carbonate mixture, and is, for the<br>
diol, generally in a range of from 0 to 10 % by weight, preferably from 0<br>
to 7 % by weight, more preferably from 0 to 5 % by weight, in terms of<br>
the percentage by mass of the diol in the cyclic carbonate / diol mixture.<br>
When carrying out the present reaction industrially, besides fresh<br>
cyclic carbonate and / or aliphatic monohydric alcohol newly introduced<br>
into the reaction system, material having the cyclic carbonate and / or<br>
the aliphatic monohydric alcohol as a main component thereof recovered<br>
from this process and/ or another process can also be preferably used<br>
for the starting materials. It is an excellent characteristic feature of the<br>
present invention that this is possible. An example of another process<br>
is a process in which a diaryl carbonate is produced from a dialkyl<br>
carbonate and an aromatic monohydroxy compound, the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol being by-produced in this process and recovered.<br><br>
The recovered by-produced aliphatic monohydric alcohol generally often<br>
contains the dialkyl carbonate, the aromatic monohydroxy compound, an<br>
alkyl aryl ether and so on, and may also contain small amounts of an<br>
alkyl aryl carbonate, the diaryl carbonate and so on. The by-produced<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol may be used as is as a starting material in<br>
the present invention, or may be used as the starting material after<br>
amount of contained material having a higher boiling point than that of<br>
the aliphatic monohydric alcohol has been reduced through distillation or<br>
the like.<br>
Moreover, a cyclic carbonate preferably used in the present<br>
invention is one produced through reaction between, for example, an<br>
alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or styrene oxide<br>
and carbon dioxide; a cyclic carbonate containing small amounts of these<br>
raw material compounds or the like may be used as a starting material in<br>
the present invention.<br>
In the present invention, a ratio between the amounts of the cyclic<br>
carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol fed into the reactive<br>
distillation column varies according to the type and amount of the<br>
transesterification catalyst and the reaction conditions, but a molar ratio<br>
of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to the cyclic carbonate fed in is<br>
generally in a range of from 0.01 to 1000 times. To increase the cyclic<br>
carbonate conversion, it is preferable to feed in the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol in an excess of at least 2 times the number of mols of the cyclic<br>
carbonate, but if the amount of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol used is<br>
too great, then it is necessary to make the apparatus larger. For such<br><br>
reasons, the molar ratio of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to the cyclic<br>
carbonate is preferably in a range of from 2 to 20, more preferably from 3<br>
to 15, yet more preferably from 5 to 12. Furthermore, if much unreacted<br>
cyclic carbonate remains, then the unreacted cyclic carbonate may react<br>
with the product diol to by-produce oligomers such as a dimer or a trimer,<br>
and hence in industrial implementation, it is preferable to reduce the<br>
amount of unreacted cyclic carbonate remaining as much as possible.<br>
In the process of the present invention, even if the above molar ratio is<br>
not more than 10, the cyclic carbonate conversion can be made to be not<br>
less than 98%, preferably not less than 99%, more preferably not less<br>
than 99.9%. This is another characteristic feature of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the present invention, preferably not less than 2 ton / hr of the<br>
dialkyl carbonate is continuously produced to be subjected to the<br>
separation by distillation in use of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column B; the minimum amount of the cyclic carbonate continuously fed<br>
in to achieve this is generally 2.2 P ton / hr, preferably 2.1 P ton / hr,<br>
more preferably 2.0 P ton / hr, based on the amount P (ton / hr) of the<br>
dialkyl carbonate to be produced. In a yet more preferable case, this<br>
amount can be made to be less than 1.9 P ton / hr.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column A for carrying out the reactive distillation process in<br>
the present invention, but the continuous multi-stage distillation column A<br>
must be a continuous multi-stage distillation column that enables not only<br>
distillation but also reaction to be carried out at the same time so as to<br>
be able to produce preferably not less than 2 ton / hr of the dialkyl<br><br>
carbonate and / or preferably not less than 1.3 ton / hr of the diol stably<br>
for a prolonged period of time.<br>
In the present invention, the cyclic carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol are taken as starting materials, the starting materials<br>
are continuously fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column A<br>
in which the homogeneous catalyst is present, reactive distillation is<br>
carried out in the column A, a high boiling point reaction mixture AB<br>
containing a produced diol is continuously withdrawn from a lower portion<br>
of the column A in a liquid form, and a low boiling point reaction mixture<br>
AT containing a produced dialkyl carbonate and the aliphatic monohydric<br>
alcohol is continuously withdrawn from an upper portion of the column A<br>
in a gaseous form, and a continuous multi-stage distillation column B is<br>
used to subject the low boiling point reaction mixture AT to separation by<br>
distillation into a column top component BT having the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol as a main component thereof and a column bottom<br>
component BB having the dialkyl carbonate as a main component thereof.<br>
The continuous multi-stage distillation column B used in the<br>
present invention must have a function of separating out the dialkyl<br>
carbonate with a prescribed separation efficiency stably for a prolonged<br>
period of time from a large amount of the reaction mixture, and various<br>
conditions must be simultaneously satisfied to achieve this.<br>
Specifically, the continuous multi-stage distillation column B is a<br>
distillation column comprising a stripping section having a length L1 (cm),<br>
an inside diameter D1 (cm) and an internal with a number of stages n1<br>
thereinside, and an enrichment section having a length L2 (cm), an inside<br>
diameter D2 (cm) and an internal with a number of stages n2 thereinside,<br><br><br>
It has been discovered that by using such a continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column B simultaneously satisfying the formulae<br>
(1) to (8), a dialkyl carbonate can be separated out and purified as a<br>
column bottom component BB at a purity of not less than 97 % by weight<br>
on an industrial scale of preferably not less than 2 ton / hr stably for a<br>
prolonged period of time of, for example, not less than 1000 hours,<br>
preferably not less than 3000 hours, more preferably not less than 5000<br>
hours from a large amount of a low boiling point reaction mixture AT that<br>
has been produced through reactive distillation between a cyclic<br>
carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric alcohol. Regarding the purity of<br>
the dialkyl carbonate separated out, generally a high purity of not less<br>
than 97 % by weight, preferably not less than 99 % by weight, can be<br>
easily attained. In the present invention, it is also easy to make the<br>
purity of the dialkyl carbonate obtained as the column bottom component<br>
be an ultra-high purity of preferably not less than 99.9 % by weight, more<br>
preferably not less than 99.99 % by weight. The reason why it has<br>
become possible to separate out and purify the dialkyl carbonate on an<br><br>
industrial scale with such excellent effects by implementing the process<br>
of the present invention is not clear, but this is supposed to be due to a<br>
composite effect brought about when the conditions of the formulae (1) to<br>
(8) are combined.<br>
Preferable ranges for the respective factors are described below.<br>
If L1 (cm) is less than 500, then the separation efficiency for the<br>
stripping section decreases, and hence the desired separation efficiency<br>
cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost while<br>
securing the desired separation efficiency, L1 must be made to be not<br>
more than 3000. A more preferable range for L1 (cm) is 800 
with 1000 
If D1 (cm) is less than 100, then it is not possible to attain the<br>
desired distillation amount. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost<br>
while attaining the desired distillation amount, D1 must be made to be not<br>
more than 1000. A more preferable range for D1 (cm) is 120 
with 150 
If L1/D1 is less than 2 or greater than 30, then prolonged stable<br>
operation becomes difficult. A more preferable range for L1/D1 is 5 
L1/D1 
If n1 is less than 10, then the separation efficiency for the<br>
stripping section decreases and hence the desired separation efficiency<br>
cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost while<br>
securing the desired separation efficiency, n1 must be made to be not<br>
more than 40. A more preferable range for ni is 13 
n1 
If L2 (cm) is less than 700, then the separation efficiency for the<br><br>
enrichment section decreases, and hence the desired separation<br>
efficiency cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment<br>
cost while securing the desired separation efficiency, L2 must be made to<br>
be not more than 5000. Furthermore, if L2 is greater than 5000, then the<br>
pressure difference between the top and bottom of the column becomes<br>
too great, and hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult.<br>
Moreover, it becomes necessary to increase the temperature in the lower<br>
portion of the column, and hence side reactions become liable to occur.<br>
A more preferable range for L2 (cm) is 1500 
3000 being yet more preferable.<br>
If D2 (cm) is less than 50, then it is not possible to attain the<br>
desired distillation amount. Moreover, to keep down the equipment cost<br>
while attaining the desired distillation amount, D2 must be made to be not<br>
more than 800. A more preferable range for D2 (cm) is 70 
with 80 
If L2 / D2 is less than 10 or greater than 50, then prolonged stable<br>
operation becomes difficult. A more preferable range for L2 / D2 is 15 
L2 / D2 
If n2 is less than 35, then the separation efficiency for the<br>
enrichment section decreases and hence the desired separation<br>
efficiency cannot be attained. Moreover, to keep down the equipment<br>
cost while securing the desired separation efficiency, n2 must be made to<br>
be not more than 100. Furthermore, if n2 is greater than 100, then the<br>
pressure difference between the top and bottom of the column becomes<br>
too great, and hence prolonged stable operation becomes difficult.<br>
Moreover, it becomes necessary to increase the temperature in the lower<br><br>
portion of the column, and hence side reactions become liable to occur.<br>
A more preferable range for n2 is 40 
yet more preferable.<br>
Moreover, for the continuous multi-stage distillation column B in<br>
the present invention, preferably L1 
Furthermore, preferably D2

the case that L1 
In the present invention, the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column B is preferably a distillation column having trays and/or packings<br>
as the internal in each of the stripping section and the enrichment<br>
section. The term "internal" used in the present invention means the<br>
part in the distillation column where gas and liquid are actually brought<br>
into contact with one another. Examples of the trays include a<br>
bubble-cap tray, a sieve tray, a ripple tray, a ballast tray, a valve tray, a<br>
counterflow tray, an Unifrax tray, a Superfrac tray, a Maxfrac tray, a dual<br>
flow tray, a grid plate tray, a turbogrid plate tray, a Kittel tray, or the like.<br>
Examples of the packings include random packings such as a Raschig<br>
ring, a Lessing ring, a Pall ring, a Berl saddle, an Intalox saddle, a Dixon<br>
packing, a McMahon packing or Heli-Pak, or structured packings such as<br>
Mellapak, Gempak, Techno-pack, Flexipac, a Sulzer packing, a Goodroll<br>
packing or Glitschgrid. A multi-stage distillation column having both a<br>
tray portion and a portion packed with packings can also be used.<br>
Furthermore, the term "number of stages n of the internals" used in the<br>
present invention means the number of trays in the case of trays, and the<br>
theoretical number of stages in the case of packings. The number of<br><br>
stages n in the case of a continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
having both a tray portion and a portion packed with packings is thus the<br>
sum of the number of trays and the theoretical number of stages.<br>
In the present invention, it is particularly preferable for the internal<br>
in both the stripping section and the enrichment section of the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column B to be tray. Furthermore, it has been<br>
discovered that sieve trays each having a sieve portion and a downcomer<br>
portion are particularly good as the tray in terms of the relationship<br>
between performance and equipment cost. It has also been discovered<br>
that each sieve tray preferably has 150 to 1200 holes / m2 in the sieve<br>
portion. A more preferable number of holes is from 200 to 1100 holes /<br>
m2, yet more preferably from 250 to 1000 holes / m2. Moreover, it has<br>
been discovered that the cross-sectional area per hole of each sieve tray<br>
is preferably in a range of from 0.5 to 5 cm2. A more preferable<br>
cross-sectional area per hole is from 0.7 to 4 cm2, yet more preferably<br>
from 0.9 to 3 cm2. Furthermore, it has been discovered that it is<br>
particularly preferable if each sieve tray has 150 to 1200 holes / m2 in<br>
the sieve portion, and the cross-sectional area per hole is in a range of<br>
from 0.5 to 5 cm2. It has been shown that by adding the above<br>
conditions to the continuous multi-stage distillation column B, the object<br>
of the present invention can be attained more easily.<br>
In the present invention, the dialkyl carbonate produced through<br>
the reactive distillation in the continuous multi-stage distillation column A<br>
is continuously withdrawn from the upper portion of the column in a<br>
gaseous form as the low boiling point reaction mixture AT together with<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol that has remained unreacted due to<br><br>
generally being used in excess. The low boiling point reaction mixture<br>
AT is continuously fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
B, a low boiling point mixture BT having the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
as a main component thereof is continuously withdrawn from an upper<br>
portion of the column in a gaseous form, and a high boiling point mixture<br>
BB having the dialkyl carbonate as a main component thereof is<br>
continuously withdrawn from a lower portion of the column in a liquid<br>
form. When feeding the low boiling point reaction mixture AT into the<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column B, the low boiling point<br>
reaction mixture AT may be fed in in a gaseous form, or in a liquid form.<br>
It is preferable to heat or cool the low boiling point reaction mixture AT to<br>
a temperature close to the liquid temperature in the vicinity of the<br>
feeding inlet of the continuous multi-stage distillation column B before<br>
feeding the low boiling point reaction mixture AT into the distillation<br>
column B.<br>
Moreover, the position from which the iow boiling point reaction<br>
mixture AT is fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column B is<br>
preferably around between the stripping section and the enrichment<br>
section. The continuous multi-stage distillation column B preferably has<br>
a reboiler for heating the distillate, and a refluxing apparatus.<br>
In the present invention, the low boiling point reaction mixture AT<br>
is generally withdrawn from the continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
A in an amount of not less than 2 ton / hr, before being fed into the<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column B and thus subjected to the<br>
separation by distillation, whereupon the low boiling point mixture BT is<br>
continuously withdrawn from the upper portion of the distillation column B,<br><br>
and the high boiling point mixture BB is continuously withdrawn from the<br>
lower portion of the distillation column B.<br>
In the present invention, the concentration of the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol in the low boiling point mixture BT can be made to be<br>
not less than 80 % by weight, preferably not less than 85 % by weight,<br>
more preferably not less than 90 % by weight. Moreover, the<br>
concentration of the dialkyl carbonate in the high boiling point mixture BB<br>
can easily be made to be not less than 97 % by weight, preferably not<br>
less than 99 % by weight, more preferably not less than 99.9 % by weight,<br>
yet more preferably not less than 99.99 % by weight. Furthermore, the<br>
amount of the alcohol separated out as the main component of the low<br>
boiling point mixture BT is generally not less than 500 kg / hr, preferably<br>
not less than 1 ton / hr, more preferably not less than 2 ton / hr. The<br>
remainder of the low boiling point mixture BT is mostly the dialkyl<br>
carbonate, and hence the low boiling point mixture BT can be reused as<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol for reacting with the cyclic carbonate either<br>
as is or else after having been mixed with alcohol recovered from another<br>
process. This is one preferable embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the case that the amount of recovered alcohol is insufficient, fresh<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol may be added.<br>
The high boiling point mixture BB separated off in the present<br>
invention has the dialkyl carbonate as the main component thereof, and<br>
has a content of unreacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol of not more than<br>
3 % by weight, preferably not more than 1 % by weight, more preferably<br>
not more than 0.1 % by weight, yet more preferably not more than 0.01 %<br>
by weight. Moreover, in a preferable embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention, the reaction is carried out using starting materials and catalyst<br>
not containing a halogen, and hence the produced dialkyl carbonate can<br>
be made to not contain a halogen at all. In the present invention, a<br>
high-purity dialkyl carbonate of concentration not less than 97 % by<br>
weight, preferably not less than 99 % by weight, more preferably not less<br>
than 99.9 % by weight, yet more preferably not less than 99.99 % by<br>
weight, with a halogen content of not more than 0.1 ppm, preferably not<br>
more than 1 ppb, can thus be easily obtained.<br>
The distillation conditions for the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column B used in the present invention vary depending on the<br>
form of the internals in the distillation column and the number of stages,<br>
the type, composition and amount of the low boiling point reaction<br>
mixture AT fed in, the purity of the dialkyl carbonate to be obtained<br>
through the separation, and so on. The column bottom temperature is<br>
generally a specified temperature in a range of from 150 to 250 °C. A<br>
more preferable temperature range is from 170 to 230 °C, yet more<br>
preferably from 180 to 220 °C. The column bottom pressure varies<br>
depending on the composition in the column and the column bottom<br>
temperature used, but in the present invention the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column B is generally operated under an applied pressure.<br>
Moreover, the reflux ratio for the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column B is preferably in a range of from 0.5 to 5, more preferably from<br>
0.8 to 3, yet more preferably from 1 to 2.5.<br>
The material constituting each of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation columns A and B used in the present invention is generally a<br>
metallic material such as carbon steel or stainless steel. In terms of the<br><br>
quality of the dialkyl carbonate and diol produced and subjected to the<br>
separation, stainless steel is preferable.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Following is a more detailed description of the present invention<br>
through examples. However, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
following examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A continuous multi-stage distillation column B as shown in FIG. 1<br>
having L1 = 1600 cm, D1 = 260 cm, L1/D1 = 6.2, m = 18, L2 = 2700 cm,<br>
D2 = 160 cm, L2 / D2 = 16.9, and n2 = 58 was used. In this example,<br>
sieve trays were used as the internals in both the stripping section and<br>
the enrichment section (cross-sectional area per hole = approximately<br>
1.3 cm2, number of holes = approximately 300 to 440 / m2).<br>
A starting material containing ethylene carbonate (EC) and<br>
methanol (MeOH) (molar ratio MeOH / EC = 8.4) and a catalyst (KOH in<br>
ethylene glycol subjected to thermal dehydration treatment; K<br>
concentration 0.1 % by weight based on EC) was continuously fed into a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column A, and reactive distillation was<br>
carried out, whereby 8.18 ton / hr of a column top component AT was<br>
continuously withdrawn. The column top component AT, which contained<br>
4.644 ton / hr of methanol and 3.536 ton / hr of dimethyl carbonate, was<br>
continuously fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column B<br>
from an inlet 3-b. This inlet was provided between the trays in the 18th<br>
and 19th stages from the bottom of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column B.<br><br>
The continuous multi-stage distillation column B was operated<br>
continuously with a column bottom temperature of approximately 205 °C,<br>
a column bottom pressure of approximately 1.46 MPa, and a reflux ratio<br>
of approximately 1.8.<br>
It was possible to attain stable steady state operation after 24<br>
hours. A column top component BT continuously withdrawn from the top<br>
1 of the continuous multi-stage distillation column B at 5.08 ton / hr<br>
contained 4.644 ton / hr of methanol and 0.436 ton / hr of dimethyl<br>
carbonate. The methanol concentration in the column top component BT<br>
was 91.42 % by weight. Moreover, a column bottom component BB<br>
continuously withdrawn from the bottom 2 of the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column B at 3.1 ton / hr contained not less than 99.99 % by<br>
weight of dimethyl carbonate (methanol content not more than 0.01 % by<br>
weight).<br>
This means that of the dimethyl carbonate fed into the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column B, approximately 87.7% was obtained as<br>
high-purity dimethyl carbonate. Note that the column top component BT<br>
was fed as is into the reactive distillation column A, and thus used as<br>
some of the starting material for producing the dimethyl carbonate and<br>
the diol.<br>
Prolonged continuous operation was carried out under these<br>
conditions. After 500 hours, 2000 hours, 4000 hours, 5000 hours, and<br>
6000 hours, the produced amounts of dimethyl carbonate per hour were<br>
3.1 ton, 3.1 ton, 3.1 ton, 3.1 ton, and 3.1 ton, and hence operation was<br>
very stable. The purity of the dimethyl carbonate obtained through the<br>
separation / purification was 99.99% in each case, and the halogen<br><br>
content was outside the detection limit, i.e. not more than 1 ppb.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Reactive distillation and dimethyl carbonate separation /<br>
purification were carried out using the same continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column B and the same process as in Example 1. The<br>
column top component AT, which was continuously withdrawn from the<br>
top of the continuous multi-stage distillation column A (reactive<br>
distillation column) at 12.27 ton / hr, contained 6.967 ton / hr of methanol<br>
and 5.303 ton / hr of dimethyl carbonate. This column top component AT<br>
was continuously fed into the continuous multi-stage distillation column B<br>
from an inlet 3-b.<br>
It was possible to attain stable steady state operation after 24<br>
hours. The column top component BT, which was continuously<br>
withdrawn from the top 1 of the continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
B at 7.62 ton / hr, contained 6.967 ton / hr of methanol and 0.654 ton / hr<br>
of dimethyl carbonate. The methanol concentration in the column top<br>
component BT was 91.43 % by weight. Moreover, the column bottom<br>
component BB, which was continuously withdrawn from the bottom 2 of<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column B at 4.65 ton / hr,<br>
contained not less than 99.99 % by weight of dimethyl carbonate<br>
(methanol content not more than 0.01 % by weight).<br>
This means that of the dimethyl carbonate fed into the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column B, approximately 87.7% was obtained as<br>
high-purity dimethyl carbonate. Note that the column top component BT<br>
was fed as is into the reactive distillation column A, and thus used as<br><br>
some of the starting material for producing the dimethyl carbonate and<br>
the diol.<br>
Prolonged continuous operation was carried out under these<br>
conditions. After 500 hours, 2000 hours, 4000 hours, 5000 hours, and<br>
6000 hours, the produced amounts of dimethyl carbonate per hour were<br>
4.65 ton, 4.65 ton, 4.65 ton, 4.65 ton, and 4.65 ton, and hence operation<br>
was very stable. The purity of the dimethyl carbonate obtained through<br>
the separation / purification was 99.99% in each case, and the halogen<br>
content was outside the detection limit, i.e. not more than 1 ppb.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A continuous multi-stage distillation column B as shown in FIG. 1<br>
was used. In this example, sieve trays were used as the internals in<br>
both the stripping section and the enrichment section (cross-sectional<br>
area per hole = approximately 1.3 cm2, number of holes = approximately<br>
530 to 800 / m2).<br>
Reactive distillation and dimethyl carbonate separation /<br>
purification were carried out using the same process as in Example 1.<br>
The column top component AT, which was continuously withdrawn from<br>
the top of the continuous multi-stage distillation column A (reactive<br>
distillation column) at 24.54 ton / hr, contained 13.934 ton / hr of<br>
methanol and 10.606 ton / hr of dimethyl carbonate. This column top<br>
component AT was continuously introduced into the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column B from an inlet 3-b.<br>
It was possible to attain stable steady state operation after 24<br>
hours. The column top component BT, which was continuously<br><br>
withdrawn from the top 1 of the continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
B at 15.24 ton / hr, contained 13.934 ton / hr of methanol and 1.306 ton /<br>
hr of dimethyl carbonate. The methanol concentration in the column top<br>
component BT was 91.43 % by weight. Moreover, the column bottom<br>
component BB, which was continuously withdrawn from the bottom 2 of<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column B at 9.3 ton / hr, contained<br>
not less than 99.99 % by weight of dimethyl carbonate (methanol content<br>
not more than 0.01 % by weight).<br>
This means that of the dimethyl carbonate fed into the continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column B, approximately 87.7% was obtained as<br>
high-purity dimethyl carbonate. Note that the column top component BT<br>
was fed as is into the reactive distillation column A, and thus used as<br>
some of the starting material for producing the dimethyl carbonate and<br>
the diol.<br>
Prolonged continuous operation was carried out under these<br>
conditions. After 500 hours, 2000 hours, and 3000 hours, the produced<br>
amounts of dimethyl carbonate per hour were 9.3 ton, 9.3 ton, and 9.3<br>
ton, and hence operation was very stable. The purity of the dimethyl<br>
carbonate obtained through the separation / purification was 99.99% in<br>
each case, and the halogen content was outside the detection limit, i.e.<br>
not more than 1 ppb.<br>
