				<td>The invention relates to a Bootwiper made of brush coconut fiber rods fixed to a galvanized steel wire frame and rigidly interconnected with coir yarn twine. Rubber strips are used at bottom of this Bootwiper as an ami -skid device.<br>
Background<br>
Conventional bootwipers are manufactured with fiber and metal for use at the entrance, exists, doorways and so far serve the purpose only partly, creating certain, disadvantages as listed below.<br>
Dirt, mud and other objects such as snow are not completely removed from the boot or the shoes as the wiped dirt accumulates on the brush fiber, since these are placed and fixed on a flat horizontal plane generally parallel to the floor on which bootwiper is placed. Therefore such inventions of doormat with bootwipers and other profiles are not efficient and require periodical cleaning by lifting, shaking or vibrating. These vigorous actions are not only tedious but reduce the lifetime of the mat drastically.<br>
The conventional type of bootwiper made out of coconut fiber and the like and having rubber or plastic and metal and coir yarn twine components for the base have tight configuration on a flat surface thereby preventing drying by rapid evaporation and any moisture acquired with dirt during rains or snow.<br>
Boot scrapers with steel wires incorporating fibers have the distinct disadvantage of getting corroded due to frequent presence of moisture. In addition to the above-mentioned disadvantages, since the brush fibers are stationery and fixed to steel wire frame without allowing any movement or without any gaps in between them.<br>
The conventional type of bootwiper made out of fiber rods with a helical wire grid also has limitations of design and patterns, which were restricted.<br>
The bootwiper with metal/steel wires could cause damage and injury.<br>
- 1-<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The objective of the alleged invention is aimed at overcoming most of the disadvantages of the prior art bootwipers and floormats and also using as far as possible ecologically friendly recyclable material such as natural firers, rubber and coir twine and avoiding plastic materials.<br>
Another objective of alleged invention is to overcome the high cost of production of conventional bootwiper made of expensive material such as metal / steel and plastic components which have to be injection moulded.<br>
Another object of the invention is to overcome the disadvantage of causing injury with material such as steel / metal is also overcome by using twisted in fiber rods, coir yarn material.<br>
The invention provides a bootwiper comprising:<br>
rectangular galvanized steel wire frame,<br>
said frame is covered with brush  fiber rods  along whole periphery of the frame,<br>
plurality of fiber rods arranged in the said frame and tied at each end of the frame to form the required design or pattern,<br>
at least four lengths of coir and a thin wire to bind said brush fiber rods in said frame to obtain a rigid frame for bootwiper,<br>
at least three brush fiber rods, two at the extreme ends of said frame and one at the center are provided, and<br>
at least two pieces of rubber on opposite faces of said fiber rods at extreme ends are provided to act as anti - skid device of the bootwiper.<br>
The invention also provides a method of making the bootwiper comprising of steps:<br>
bending a galvanized steel wire rod about 4 mm. in diameter to make a rectangular shape frame by welding at the two ends,<br><br>
covering said rectangular frame with a bush fiber rod by bending along the periphery of steel wire,<br>
placing pieces of cut length of brush fiber rods within said frame to obtain a desired pattern / design,<br>
inserting / binding at least four lengths of coir yarn twine and a thin wire of 2.0 mm diameter to bind said brush fiber rods in the said frame to obtain a rigid frame for bootwiper,<br>
binding at least three brush fiber rods, two at the extreme end of said frame and one at the center,<br>
providing at least two pieces of rubber on opposite faces of fiber rods at extreme ends to act as anti-skidding device<br>
The fiber rods are made of coconut fiber or any other natural finer or synthetic fiber.<br>
The circular coconut brush fiber rods of the bootwiper are held in place by a coir / twine / yarn harness.<br>
The coir / twine / yarn is bleached or given any colour to enhance the aesthetic value of the bootwiper.<br>
The said twine / yarn harness is made of coconut fiber or any other natural fiber or a synthetic fiber or PVC coated fiber.<br>
The said centrally placed fiber rod, which is perpendicular and above based circular fiber rods so that all the sides of the shoe/ boot touch the circular fiber rods above the base while the soles are in contact with the circular fiber rods of the base.<br>
This unique design bootwiper, wipes sides of the shoe / boot as well as the bottom side simultaneously and brushing process being done by the fiber rods set according to a predetermined pattern on the base frame.<br>
This circular fiber rod enable the entire circular surface to be used and the dirt can fall under the mat while providing air circulation for rapid<br><br>
evaporation. The bootwipers are made in such a way that the base mat has circular twisted in fiber rods placed to a predetermined pattern/design and the 3 wiper rods are placed on the top surface of the base mat in such a way that two are at the extreme ends fitted onto the shorter side and the balance one at the center making the coir yarn twines parallel and symmetrical about the center rod.<br>
The invention provides a bootwiper, which is made out of metal wire frame covered with a circular twisted in brush fiber rod and other cut lengths of fiber rods held tightly together with a unique coir yarn harness.<br>
The ecologically friendly and non-corrosive materials are preferred in making such bootwipers. Circular coconut fiber rods enhance cleaning action, as they are held apart by the coir twine with twisted in coconut fiber rod wiper rods placed widely apart. Coconut fiber can be substituted with synthetic/ other natural fiber rods as well.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 shows the polarity of fiber rods arranged in a metal frame to get the bootwiper with the desired pattern/ design according to this invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the coir/ yarn/ twine bound around the fiber rods.<br>
Fig. 7 and 7A shows a coiled GI wire inserted through each rod to strengthen the resistance of each fiber rod together with the coir twine.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the bootwiper with the rubber strips according to this invention.<br>
The preferred embodiment given below are only an example and do not limit the scope of the claims given at the end of this complete specification.<br>
Preferred Embodiments:<br>
The frame (1) is made out of galvanized wire and twisted in brush fiber rod to accommodate cut length of twisted in fiber rods (2) giving a desired pattern/ design.<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows the coir yarn/ twine (3) is bound/ inserted into the cut length of fiber rods placed to a preplanned pattern/ design within the rectangular GI wire frame (1).<br>
Fig. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 shows how the fiber rods (2) are arranged to get the bootwiper with the desired pattern/ design.<br>
When the coir yarn/ twine (3) is bound/ inserted as shown in fig. 3 and 4 they are at equal intervals and are so placed to be symmetrical about the wiping fiber rod (5) placed at the center of the base frame, thereby creating a unique twine harness holding the fiber rods in place.<br>
Fig. 7 and 7A shows a coiled GI wire (8) inserted through each rod to strengthen the resistance of the rod in the base held together by twine harness, to overcome breaking and to minimize crushing of the fiber rods in the base.<br>
The user can stand on the base platform section to wipe the sole and the three upstanding transverse/ perpendicular 3 twisted in fiber rods x, y and z (4, 5, 6) shown in fig 6 wipes the side portions of the shoe/ boot.<br>
Now what has been obtained is a flat mat consisting of a GI wire frame (1) with in fiber rods (2) and these fiber rods are held rigidly in place by coir yarn twine harness (3) having an upper and lower face.<br>
Fig 6 indicates how these three in fiber rods x, y and z (4, 5, 6) which are placed at parallel to the shorter side of the rectangle of the base frame as bootwiper wipe the sides of the boot, when a person stands on the bootwiper.<br>
Using this same method or the process could make several designs. On the reverse side or the reverse face of the bootwiper where the three upstanding fiber rods are placed two rubber strips (7) are placed at the extreme ends on the opposite face to act as antiskid devices. In short two rubber strips (7) are placed at both sides of the bootwiper on the bottom at the extreme ends to stop skidding of the bootwiper. This is clearly shown in Fig. 8.<br>
The components of the bootwiper are unique and novel and therefore are made systematically with specific purpose skills and essentially with custom designed mechanics and apparatus with specially trained skilled labor. Due to natural ecologically friendly and unique twine harness and non rusting<br><br>
materials used, the said bootwiper could be produced in a variety of colours and patterns to give a matching effect to the place of its use and suit any individual users taste.<br>
The rectangular galvanized steel wire frame (1) is formed by bending a galvanized steel wire rod about 4 mm. in diameter and then and then welding the said rod at the two ends.<br>
A brush fiber rod (2) is bending along the periphery of steel wire and is covering the rectangular frame (1). The said brush fiber rod (2) is bending along the periphery of steel wire and is covering the rectangular frame (1). The said brush fiber rods positioned in a suitable manner within the said frame to obtain the desired shape.<br>
The coir yarn/twine (3) and a thin wire of 2 mm. in diameter is bound/inserted at an equal intervals within the frame. The said coil yarn/twine are paced in such a manner so that they are symmetrical about the wiping fiber rod (5) placed at the centre of the base frame. The whole arrangement is creating a unique twine harness, whereby holding the fiber rods in place.<br>
At least three brush fiber rods x, y and z (4,5,6) bound to the frame. The two fiber rods (x,y) are placed at the extreme end and one fiber rod (z) at the centre of the frame.<br>
Two rubber strips (7) are placed at both sides of the bootwiper on the bottom at the extreme ends to stop skidding of the bootwiper.<br>
