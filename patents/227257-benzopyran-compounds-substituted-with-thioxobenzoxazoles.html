FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND BACKGROUND ]<br>
The present invention relates to benzcpyran<br>
derivatives substituted with a thioxobenzoxazole<br>

for preparing the same and pharmaceutical composirions<br>

(Wherein, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and * are as<br>
in the description.)<br>
defined<br>
Ischemic heart disease results from myocardial<br>
ischemia developed by a serious deficiency of oxygen<br>
supply caused by interruption of blood flow to heart by<br>
a reason like arteriosclerosis (G. J. Grover, Cab. J.<br>
Physiol. 75, 309, 1997; G. D. Lopaschuk et al. So .ence<br>
&amp; Medicine 42, 1997). Myocardial ischemia induces<br>
pathological changes in cells progressively, leading to<br>
irreversible myocardial damage and even necroses of<br>
cells and tissues, at last. In early stage when dkmage<br>
is reversible, irreversible damage might be prevented<br>
by reperfusion through surgical operations such as<br>
(percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty)<br>
PTCA<br>
and<br>
CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) or iasing<br>
thrombolytics, but the restoration of flov-i by<br>
reperfusion therapy is accompanied by a further<br>
injurious phenomenon called reperfusion injury O. J.<br>
Hearse, Medicographia 18, 22, 1996) . It is difficult<br>
to clearly separate ischemic injury from that mediated<br>
by reperfusion. Reperfusion injury is caused by sudden<br>
restoration of blood flow by reperfusion therapy,<br>
mainly due to reactive oxygen free radicals and caJLcium<br>
overload. Reperfusion injury includes a rangb of<br>
events, such as arrhythmia, vascular damage, myocajrdial<br>
dysfunction and serious neurocognitive dysfunction, j<br>
In order to delay damage by ischemia and minimize<br>
reperfusion injury, studies have actively been<br>
undergoing on pharmacotherapy using immune modulators,<br>
agents to suppress apoptosis, ion channel modulators,<br>
etc, artificial blood products to enhance the oxygen<br>
carrying potential of blood, and development of devices<br>
and operation procedures, but neither of them has been<br>
in commercial use, so far. As an ion channel<br>
modulators, an inhibitor of Na-H exchanger (NHE),: an<br>
adenosine Ai/A2 antagonist and a KATP opener (ATPsensitive<br>
potassium channel opener) draw our attention.<br>
According to earlier reports, diazoxide, a KATP<br>
opener, can reduce damage due to oxidative stress by<br>
suppressing the generation of oxygen free radicals; in<br>
mitochondria by inducing oxidation of flavoprotein I (A.<br>
A. Starkov, Biosci, Rep. 11, 273, 1997; V. P. Skulachev,<br>
Q. Rev. Biophus. 29, 169, 1996), and the opening of KATP<br>
relates to the generation of antioxidant enzymes :(S.<br>
Okubo et al., Mol. and cell Biochem, 196, 3, 1999) jand<br>
the decrease of release of excitatory amino acids (J-L<br>
Moreau, G. Huber, Brain Res., 31, 65, 1999). KATP/<br>
found first in myocardium, is widely distributed! in<br>
many organs and tissues, for example, beta-cells! of<br>
pancreas, smooth muscle, kidney and central nervous<br>
system, so that it has been a major target for the<br>
Jdevelopment<br>
of a novel medicine. Atwal et al have<br>
reported that benzopyranyl cyanoguanidines (BMS-1801448)<br>
having a structure represented in the below <formula><br>
opens KATP selectively, meaning that it might have<br>
cardioprotective function, which provides a chance to<br>
develop a novel therapeutic agent for ischemic heart<br>
diseases.<br><formula><br>
Thus, the inventors of present invention<br>
synthesized benzopyran derivatives substituted with a<br>
thioxobenzoxazole derivative, in which the guanidjinyl<br>
group substituted in the 4-position of benzopyran; was<br>
cyclized to a benzene ring, aniline nitrogen was<br>
changed into oxygen to form a benzoxazole ring and Ncyano<br>
group was changed into thioxo group. And the<br>
present inventors completed this invention by<br>
confirming that the compound of the invention had an<br>
excellent cardioprotective effect against damage by<br>
ischemia-reperfusion, so that it could be effectively<br>
used as a protective agent or therapeutic agent for<br>
ischemia-reperfusion related diseases. Precisely, the<br>
compound can be used for the treatment of ischemic<br>
heart diseases such as myocardial infarction, unstable<br>
angina pectoris, the protection of heart upon<br>
thrombolytic therapy or reperfusion therapy such as<br>
PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty)<br>
and CABG (coronary artery bypass graft), and the<br>
protection of ischemia-reperfusion related tissues such<br>
as nerve cells, brain, retinal cells, storage organs,<br>
etc.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide<br>
benzopyran derivatives substituted with a<br>
thioxobenzoxazole derivative, or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, processes for preparing<br>
the same and a pharmarceutical composition<br>

In the present invention, a compound of <formula></formula>
1&gt; can be prepared in the form of an individual<br>
diastereomer from the corresponding diastereomer of<br>
starting material. Each diastereomer can also be<br>
obtained by separating the diastereomeric mixture of<br>
compound (I) prepared from a diastereomeric mixture of<br>
starting material. The separation of diastereomers can<br>
be performed by generally known column chromatography<br>
or recrystallization.<br>
The preparation processes for benzopyran<br>
derivatives substituted with a thioxobenzoxazole<br>
derivative represented in <formula> of the present<br>
invention are illustrated in more detail hereinafter.<br>
I. Preparation of starting material<br>
(1) Preparation of epoxide compound (ffl)<br>
Epoxide compound (HI) used as a starting material<br>
in the above <scheme> can be prepared by processes<br>
explained in Korean Patent No. 2000-60647 and U.S.<br>
Patent 6,323,238.<br>
As shown in the below <scheme>, each<br>
diastereomer (HZi), (m2) , (Eh) and (ffi4) of a compound<br>
(HI) can be possibly prepared from olefin compounds (W<br>
i) and (VH2) by employing an Mn (III) Salen epoxidation<br>
catalyst described in the above patents.<br><scheme><br>
(Wherein, R1 and R2 are as defined in <formula></formula>
II. Preparation process 1<br>
The preparation process for the compounds of<br><formula> represented in the above <scheme><br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
1) preparing compound (V) by reaction of<br>
epoxide compound (M) and 2-aminophenol<br>
compound (IV) in the presence of a proper<br>
metal salt in proper solvent;<br>
2) preparing 2-thioxobenzoxazole compound<br>
(I') by cyclization of the compound (V)<br>
using thiocarbonyl transfer reagent; and<br>
3) preparing compound (I) by changing<br>
substituents of the compound (I').<br>
The step 1) is a reaction of epoxide compound<br>
(III) with 2-aminophenol compound (IV) in proper<br>
solvent in the presence of a proper metal salt.<br>
As a metal salt, Mg(ClO4)2, CoCl2, LiC104, NaC104,<br>
CaCl2, ZnCl;, LiBF4 or Zn(Tf)2 can be used, and as a<br>
solvent, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or<br>
dimethylformamide is available and acetonitrile is<br>
preferable among them. Reaction temperature ranges<br>
from room temperature to the boiling point of a solvent.<br>
In case that an individual stereoisomer of<br>
epoxide compound (HI) is used as a starting material,<br>
an individual stereroisomer with a stereochemistry<br>
corresponding to the compound used as a starting<br>
material will be obtained. As shown in the below<br><scheme>, compounds (Vi), (V2), (V3) and (V4) can<br>
be prepared from each epoxide compound (ffli) , (DD^) / (d<br>
3) and (EU) .<br><scheme><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
In cyclization of the above step 2), thiocarbonyl<br>
transfer reagent can be selected from a group<br>
consisting of carbon disulfide, and thiophosgens such<br>
as thiourea, 1,1' -thiocarbonyldiimidazole, l/l1-<br>
thiocarbonyldi-1,2,4-triazole, di-2-pyridyl<br>
thiocarbonate, 1,1'-thiocarbonyl-2,2'-pyridone, etc.<br>
In the above step 3), a compound (I) is prepared<br>
by changing substituents R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 by<br>
alkylation, acylation, reduction, or substitution, etc.<br>
For example, as shown in <scheme>, if R1 of the<br>
compound (I) is amino group, the compound of the<br>
present invention can be prepared by reducing nitro<br>
group, for which hydrogenation is performed using a<br>
metal catalyst such as platinum, palladium on carbon<br>
(Pd/C) or Raney-nickel in proper solvent. An<br>
alternative way is reduction of nitro group using a<br>
reducing agent like NaBH4 in the presence of CuSO,},<br>
Cu(OAc)2, CoCl2, SnCl2 or NiCl2. In this reaction,<br>
preferable solvent is a mixture of water and methanol<br>
and reaction temperature rangs from room temperature to<br>
the boiling point of a solvent.<br><scheme><br>

III. Preparation process 2<br>
Another process to prepare a compound (I) of<br><formula> is illustrated in step 1) of <scheme>, a<br>
compound (VI) is prepared by cyclization of 2-<br>
aminophenol compound (IV) such thiocarbonyl transfer<br>
reagents as in step 2) of the preparation process 1.<br>
In step 2), a compound (I') is prepared by<br>
epoxide ring opening, in which a compound (VI) is<br>
reacted with epoxide compound (ffl) in the presence of<br>
base. Both inorganic base such as sodium hydride,<br>
potassium t-butoxide, sodium methoxide, etc and organic<br>
base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU),<br>
etc, are available.<br>
In step 3), a compound (I) is prepared by<br>
changing substituents by the same process as used in<br>
the preparation process 1.<br>
The present invention further provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition for carioprotection<br>
containing benzopyran derivatives substituted with a<br>
thioxobenzoxazole derivative, represented in <formula></formula>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as an<br>
effective ingredient.<br>
When tested in ischemic heart models of<br>
Langendorff using isolated rat hearts, compounds of the<br>
present invention significantly prolong the time to<br>
contracture (TTC) , an index of heart protection, and<br>
improve recovery of the cardiac function (left<br>
ventricular developed pressure x heart rate, LVDP x HR)<br>
after reperfusion, but reduce release of lacrate<br>
dehydrogenase (LDH), an index for cell damage, which<br>
are similar or superior to cardioprotecting activity of<br>
BMS-180448, a control. In ischemic myocardium models<br>
using anesthetized rat, compounds of the present<br>
invention also show similar antiischemic activity to<br>
BMS-180448.<br>
In conclusion, the compounds of the present<br>
invention show excellent cardioprotecting activity in<br>
vitro and in vivo as well, so that they can be<br>
effectively applied as a cardioprotective medicine and<br>
a preventing or therapeutic agent for both ischemic<br>
heart diseases such as myocardial infarction, unstable<br>
angina pectoris, etc, and other troubles, caused by<br>
thrombolytics or reperfusion therapy like ?TCA<br>
(percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) and<br>
CABG (coronary artery bypass graft), such as decrease<br>
of myocardial contractility, damage of myocardial cells,<br>
change of energy metabolism, decline of cognitive<br>
capability, etc.<br>

The following experiments were performed to<br>
investigate pharmacological activities of compounds of<br>
the present invention represented in <formula>.<br>
Experimental Example I: Cardioprotective effect on<br>
isolated ischemia heart models of white rats<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds<br>
of <formula> had the protective effect (antiischemic<br>
effect) on ischemic heart was accomplished in the below.<br>
100 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital was injected in<br>
abdominal cavity of white male rats (300 ~ 450 g,<br>
obtained form the experimental animal team of the Korea<br>
Research Institute of Chemical Technology) to<br>
anesthetize them. Then, an intravenous injection of<br>
1000 U/kg of heparin was performed before taking out<br>
heart. Particularly, cannula(PE 240) was inserted in<br>
the trachea, and artificial respiration was tried upon<br>
the rat by using a rodent ventilator. Under that<br>
condition, aortic cannula was inserted in the aorta and<br>
heart was taken out under retrograde perfusion. The<br>
extracted heart was hung on Langendorff apparatus<br>
quickly and unnecessary tissues on heart were removed.<br>
Perfusion was induced under static pressure (85 mmHg)<br>
with 37 °C modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer<br>
(composition <mm>: 116 NaCl, 4.7 KC1, 1.1 MgS04, 1.17<br>
KH2P04, 24.9 NaHC03, 2.52 CaCl2, 8.32 Glucose, 2.0<br>
Pyruvate) saturated with 95% 02/5% C02. A metal cannula,<br>
to which a latex balloon filled with an ethanoldistilled<br>
water mixture (1:1 vol/vol) was linked, was<br>
inserted in left ventricle through pulmonary vein.<br>
Then, left ventricular pressure transmitted through the<br>
balloon was transduced by using pressure transducer,<br>
and amplified by using Plugsys bridge amplifier<br>
isovolumetrically. Then, the pressure was recorded in<br>
a recorder (Linearcorder mark 8 WR 3500) . Thereafter,<br>
heart was stabilized for 15 minutes. Then, left<br>
ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was given by<br>
5 mmHg and such volume of the balloon was kept all<br>
through the experiments.<br>
Baseline cardiac contractile function, heart rate<br>
(HR) , and coronary flow (CF) were measured. Cardiac<br>
contractile function was calculated by subtracting LVSP<br>
(left ventricular peak systolic pressure) from LVEDP<br>
(left ventricular end diastolic pressure), yielding<br>
LVDP (left ventricular developed pressure). Double<br>
product RPP (rate-pressure product)(DP), another<br>
important parameter for indirectly assessing cardiac<br>
performance in Langendorff heart, whose cardiac output<br>
could not be measured ordinarily, was calculated by<br>
multiplying HR by LVDP. Throughout the experiment,<br>
total coronary blood flow was measured by the use of<br>
coronary flow probe (diameter: 1.0 mm) installed in<br>
aortic cannula with electromagnetic flowmeter.<br>
Temperature of heart was steadily maintained by<br>
immersing the heart at 37 °C in physiological saline<br>
solution to which 95% 02/5% COz was constantly supplied.<br>
After stabilization for 15 min, the hearts were pretreated<br>
for 10 min with vehicle (0.04% DMSO) only or a<br>
compound of the present invention or the control<br>
material in the vehicle. Thereafter, cardiac<br>
contractile function, HR and CF were repeatedly<br>
measured. Global ischemia was induced by completely<br>
shutting off the perfusate for 30 min. Severity of<br>
ischemia was determined as the time to contracture (TTC,<br>
min) during global ischemia in which the first 5 mmHg<br>
increase in EDP was observed. Then, the hearts were<br>
reperfused and, 30 min later, contractile functions<br>
(LVDP, HR and CF) were repeatedly measured. After<br>
reperfusion was accomplished for 30 min, LDH (lactate<br>
dehydrogenase) was measured with a kit as a sensitive<br>
index for loss of cell viability. The results were<br>
shown in Table 1.<br><table>

(Table Removed)<br>
In vehicle-treated group, reperfusion DP (LVDP X<br>
HR) , a index for contractility function, was decreased<br>
to 15.8% of pre-treatment DP, and EDP was increased to<br>
45.1 mmHg from 5 mmHg, and TTC was 19.8 min, and<br>
reperfusion LDH release was 31.3 unit/g as shown in the<br>
above.<br>
In BMS-180448 treated group, reperfusion<br>
contractile function (DP, LVDP x HR) was 67.6% of pretreatment<br>
DP, which was significantly improved compared<br>
to the vehicle treated group. EDP was 16.5 mmHg,<br>
significantly lower than control, and TTC was 27.8 min,<br>
prolonged than control, and reperfusion LDH release was<br>
17.2 Unit/g, decreased than control. Then, in BMS-<br>
180448 treated group, all parameters showed significant<br>
protective effect on ischemic heart.<br>
The compounds of the present invention were<br>
compared with those of control groups in<br>
cardioprotective activity based on contraction capacity,<br>
EDP, TTC, LDH, etc. As a result, the compounds of the<br>
invention showed similar or superior cardioprotective<br>
effect to BMS-180448. Especially, the compounds<br>
prepared in Example 6 and example 16 had 74.3% and<br>
79.3% of myocardial contraction capacity (LVDP x HR)<br>
each, which were superior to that of BMS-180448. Thus,<br>
those compounds were expected to have excellent<br>
protective effect to ischemic heart diseases, supported<br>
by other indexes as well. Therefore, the compounds of<br>
the present invention can be used as a therapeutic<br>
agent for ischemic heart diseases owing to -heir<br>
excellent protective effect on ischemic heart. Besides,<br>
the compounds can also be used as a protective agent<br>
for ischemic brain and retinal cell damage related to<br>
ischemia-reperfusion or for organs for storage.<br>
Experimental Example 2: Cardioprotective activity in<br>
ischemic heart isolated from white rat<br>
In order to investigate the protective effect: of<br>
compounds of <formula l> according to the present<br>
invention for ischemic heart, antiischemic effects on<br>
white rat hearts were examined as follows.<br>
75 nig/kg of sodium pentobarbital was injected in<br>
abdominal cavity of white male rats (350 - 45C g,<br>
Laboratory Animal Division, Korea Research Institute of<br>
Chemical Technology) to anesthetize them. After<br>
performing tracheotomy, artificial respiration was<br>
induced by 10 m£/kg of stroke volume and 60/min. of<br>
heart rate. Cannula was inserted in each of vena<br>
fermoralis and aorta fermoralis, through which<br>
medicines were administered and blood pressure was<br>
measured. In the meantime, since body temperature in a<br>
ischemic myocardial injury model was very important<br>
factor, directly influencing a result, the temperature<br>
of a rat was always kept at 37 °C by using a probe for<br>
measuring body temperature inserted in rectum and<br>
homeothermic blanket control unit. Mean arterial blood<br>
pressure and heart rate (HR) of the rat were measured<br>
all through the experiments. Statham P23XL pressure<br>
transducer (Grass Ins., MA, USA) was used for measuring<br>
blood pressure and EGG/RATE Coupler (Hugo Sachs<br>
Electronic, Germany) was used for measuring HR. In<br>
addition, all the changes were recorded successively by<br>
graphtec linearcorder chart recorder (Graphtec<br>
Linearcorder WR 3310, Hugo Sachs Electronic).<br>
According to the method of Selye H, left coronary<br>
aorta was occluded as follows. Left thoracotomy was<br>
induced. That is, the chest of a rat was a little<br>
opened. The right chest of the anesthetized rat was<br>
pressurized by the middle finger of left hand, so that<br>
the heart was pushed out. The heart was fixed gently<br>
by the thumb and the index finger of the left hand. A<br>
stitch was carefully put on a part including left<br>
anterior descending coronary artery by a suture needle<br>
with operating thread (5-0 silk ligature), and the<br>
heart was quickly positioned again in thoracic cavity.<br>
Then, both ends of operating thread were exposed<br>
outside. Both ends of operating thread were passed<br>
through PE tube (PE100, 2.5 cm) and left for 20 minutes<br>
for stabilization. A vehicle or a medicine was<br>
administered through the cannula inserted in femoral<br>
vein, which was left for 30 minutes in order for the<br>
medicine to work thoroughly. BMS-180448 was used ~or a<br>
control group and the dosage of each test medicine and<br>
a control medicine was 0.3 mg/kg each.<br>
PE tube threaded on a string was pushed in the<br>
heart and the string near the edge of the tube was<br>
.pulled by hemostatic pincette to stick PE tube<br>
vertically to coronary artery, which was pressurized.<br>
45 minutes later, the coronary artery was occluded.<br>
Hemostatic pincette was removed and reperfusion went<br>
for 90 minutes.<br>
The coronary artery was reoccluded according to<br>
the above method and 2 mi of 1% Evans blue solution was<br>
administered by intravenous injection. The white rat<br>
was sacrificed by the over-dose of pentobarbital, which<br>
was intravenously injected. The heart was taken and<br>
right ventricle and both atria were removed. Left<br>
ventricle was 5~6 slice cut horizontally from apex,<br>
and each slice was weighed. The surface of each slice<br>
was inputted in a computer by using Hi-scope, a compact<br>
micro vision system, and Image pro plus program, from<br>
which both normal blood flow tissue area stained by<br>
blue and non-stained area on each slice were measured.<br>
The ratio of non-stained area to the gross area of each<br>
slice was calculated, by which the weight of each slice<br>
was multiplied to calculate AAR (area at risk) of each<br>
slice. All the AARs were added up, which was then<br>
divided by the total weight of left ventricle,<br>
resulting in the percentage of AAR(%) represented in<br>
the below Mathematical Formula 1&gt;.<br>
Mathematical Formula l&gt;<br>
AAR(%) = (Sum of AAR of each slice) / (Total weight of<br>
left ventricle) x 100<br>
The heart slice was cultivated for 15 minutes in<br>
1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride(TTC) phosphate<br>
buffer (37°C, pH 7.4), then was fixed for 20~24 hours<br>
in 10% formalin solution. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium<br>
chloride was reduced by dehydrogenase and cofactor<br>
'NADH' in myocardium for being formazan dye. Therefore,<br>
normal tissues had brick-red color thereby. On the<br>
contrary, infarct zone without dehydrogenase nor<br>
cofactor was not brick-red because 2, 3,5--<br>
triphenyltetrazolium chloride was not reduced.<br>
A normal area and an infarct zone of each slice<br>
were determined by investigating the coloring of<br>
tissues by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride by<br>
taking advantage of the method used for AAR measurement.<br>
All the infarct zone of each slice were added up, which<br>
was divided by the total weight of AAR or the weight, of<br>
a whole left ventricle, resulting in IZ(%) represented<br>
in the below Mathematical Formula 2&gt;. In the test<br>
models of the invention, the lower IZ(%) was, the<br>
stronger the antiischemic effect of a test compound.<br>
The results were shown in Table 2.<br>
Mathematical Formula 2&gt;<br>
IZ(%) = (Sum of infarct zone of each slice) / (Total<br>
weight of left ventricle or AAR) x 100<br><table>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, in ischemia myocardial injury<br>
models prepared from white rats, myocardial infarction<br>
size was significantly decreased by compounds of the<br>
present invention. Particularly, myocardial infarction<br>
size (IZ/AAR, %) to AAR (area at risk) was 58.6% in a<br>
vehicle administered group, suggesting that myocardial<br>
injury by ischemia was very serious. Myocardial<br>
infarction size to AAR in BMS-180448 administered group<br>
was 39.1%, suggesting a significant antiischemic action.<br>
And compounds of the present invention were proved to<br>
have similar antiischmic effect to the control<br>
substance BMS-180448. In particular, the compounds of<br>
Example 1 and Example 6 showed not only excellent<br>
cardioprotective activity in vitro but also low<br>
myocardial infarction sized to AAR, 39.6% and 42.5%<br>
each, in vivo, meaning also an excellent<br>
cardioprotective activity to ischemia-reperfusion.<br>
Therefore, the compounds of the present invention can<br>
be effectively used as a therapeutic agent for ischemic<br>
heart diseases owing to their excellent<br>
cardioprotective effects.<br>
