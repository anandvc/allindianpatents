Naphthalene Ureas as Glucose Uptake Enhancers<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a means to enhance insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Specifically, the invention concerns compounds that activate the insulin receptor kinase leading to increased glucose uptake. The invention also concerns methods for treating hyperglycemia in humans, and especially methods for treating Type II diabetes.<br>
(b)	Description of Related Art<br>
Among the many functions performed by peptide and protein hormones in metabolism is the ability to interact with receptors with high specificity. The insulin receptor is present on virtually all cells and at high concentrations on the cells for the liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue. Stimulation of the insulin receptor with insulin is an essential element in carbohydrate metabolism and storage.<br>
Diabetics either lack sufficient endogenous secretion of the insulin hormone (Type I) or have an insulin receptor-mediated signaling pathway that is resistant to endogenous or exogenous insulin (Type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)). Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting about 5% of individuals in the industrialized nations. In Type II diabetics, major insulin-responsive tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle and fat exhibit the insulin resistance (Haring and Mehnert, Diabetologia 36:176-182 (1993); Haring et al, Diabetologia, 37 SuppL 2:S149-54 (1994)). The resistance to insulin in Type II diabetes is complex and likely multifactorial but appears to be caused by an impaired signal from the insulin receptor to the glucose transpon system and to glycogen synthase. Impairment of the insulin receptor kinase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this signaling defect. Insulin resistance is also found in many non-diabetic individuals, and may be.an underlying etiologic factor in the development of the disease (Reaven, Diabetes, 37:1595-1607 (1988)).<br><br>
Considerable information is known concerning the insulin receptor itself. The receptor consists of four separate subunits consisting of two identical a and two identical ß chains. The ß subunits contain a tyrosine kinase activity and the ATP binding sites. The insulin receptor is activated by autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. This autophosphorylation is required for subsequent activity of the insulin receptor. The autophosphorylation stabilizes the activated receptor kinase resulting in a phosphorylation cascade involving intracellular signaling proteins.<br>
At present there are limited pharmacologic approaches to treatment of Type II diabetes. Insulin is currently used as a treatment, but is disadvantageous because insulin must be injected. Although several peptide analogs of insulin have been described, none with a molecular weight below about 5000 daltons retains activity. Some peptides which<br>
interact with sites on the ß-subunit of the insulin receptor have shown enhancement of the activity of insulin on its receptor (Kole et al, J, Biol Chern., 271:31619-31626 (1996); Kasuya et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commurt., 200:777-83 (1994)). Kohanski and others have reported on a variety of polycationic species that generate a basal effect, but do little to enhance insulin action (Kohanski, J. Biol Chem„ 264:20984-91 (1989); Xu et al, Biochemistry 30:11811-19 (1991). These peptides apparently act on the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor.<br>
In addition, certain non-peptide components have been found to enhance the agonist properties of peptide hormones, but none appear to act directly on the insulin receptor kinase. For instance, the ability of thiazolidinediones,.such as pioglitazone, to enhance adipocyte differentiation has been described (Kletzien, et al, MoL Pharmacol., 41:393 (1992)). These thiazolidinediones represent a class of potential anti-diabetic compounds that enhance the response of target tissues to insulin (Kobayashi, Diabetes, 41:476 (1992)). The thiazolidinediones switch on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (PPARy), the nuclear transcription factor involved in adipocyte differentiation (Kliewer et al, J. Biol Chem„ 270:12953 (1995)) and do not have a direct effect on the insulin receptor kinase. Other anti-diabetic agents currently in use include both insulin secretagogues (such as the sulfonylureas) and biguanides (such as metformin) that inhibit<br><br>
hepatic glucose output. To date, non-peptide substances which can mimic the activating effect of insulin on the insulin receptor have eluded discovery.<br>
Bisnaphthalene ureas are known to the literature. They are heavily described as polysulfonic acid derivatives of suramin and as azo dyes, A variety .of these polyanionic sulfonic acid derivatives have been established as potential therapeutics for a variety of disease indications, Suramin, described in 1917, is a polysulfonic acid that has been extensively researched (Dressel, J. Chem. Ed.^ 38:585 (1961); Dressel, J, Chem. Ed,, 39:320 (1962)). It has therapeutic uses as an anthelmintic and antiprotozoal. More recently, it has been described as an inhibitor to reverse transcriptase in certain avian and murine retroviruses (De Clercq, Cancer Letter, 8:9 (1979); Mitsuya et ai, Science, 226:172 (1984); Gagliardi et ai, Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol, 41:117 (1988); Doukas et ai, Cancer Res. 55:5161 (1995); Mohan et ai, Antiviral Chem., 2:215 (1991)). Large numbers of compounds relating to suramin exist Most of the suramin analogs which have been reported have multiple sulfonic acid functionality on each aryl ring. Recent studies indicate that polyanionic suramin analogs have anti-angiogenic, antiproliferative activity, and anti-viral activity (Gagliardi et al.9 Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 41:117 (1988); Doukas et ai, Cancer Res., 55: 5161 (1995); Mohan et ai, Antiviral Chem., 2:215 (1991)), A number of bisnaphthylsulfonic acids have been described in the patent literature as complement inhibitors (US 4132730, US 4129591, US 4120891, US 4102917, US 4051176). Additionally, there are a number of azo dye patents (DE 19521589, US 3716368, DE 2216592, FR 1578556) which disclose polysulfonated naphthalene azo compounds. Bisnaphthalene urea 2-sulfonamide 3-azo compounds have been solely reported as a recording liquid (JP 58191772). However, none of the suramin analogs or azo dyes have been suggested to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes.<br>

Pharmaceutical compositions of the compounds of this invention, or derivatives thereof, may be formulated as solutions or lyophilized powders for parenteral administration. Powders may be reconstituted by addition of a suitable diluent or other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to use. The liquid formulation is generally a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Examples of suitable diluents are normal isotonic saline solution, 5% dextrose in water or buffered sodium or ammonium acetate solution. Such formulations are especially suitable for parenteral administration, but may also be used for oral administration. It may be desirable to add excipients such as polyvinylpyrrolidinone, gelatin, hydroxycellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride or sodium citrate. Alternatively, these compounds may be encapsulated, tableted or prepared in an emulsion or syrup for oral administration.

The amount of solid carrier varies but, preferably, will be between about 20 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit. The pharmaceutical preparations are made following the conventional techniques of phannacy involving milling, mixing, granulation, and compressing, when necessary, for tablet forms; or milling, mixing and filling for hard gelatin capsule forms. When a liquid carrier is use, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion or an aqueous or non-aqueous suspension. Such a liquid formulation may be administered directly p.o. or filled into a soft gelatin capsule. On a percent by weight basis, typical pharmaceutical compositions may contain from 0.1 to 95% of active ingredient, more preferably i to 80%.<br>
Some specific examples of suitable pharmaceutical compositions are described in Example 25 below.<br><br>
Typically, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention would be packaged in a container with a label indicating use of the pharmaceutical composition in the treatment of hyperglycemia, type I diabetes, and type II diabetes, or a combination of any of these disease conditions. Compounds can be prophylactically administered prior to a meal to control excessive elevated glucose in type II diabetics for a period of time following the meal. Alternatively, the compounds can be administered to a diabetic to normalize excessively elevated glucose levels as measured by glucose monitoring device. Finally, it is known that the very small amount of residual circulating insulin found in type I diabetics is used by the body to prevent severe lipolysis and the resulting keto-acidosis. These compounds can be used to prophylactically against ketoacidosis in type I patient. Administration of these compounds could provide relief from ketoacidosis via insulin receptor activation, not for control of blood sugar, but for inhibition of severe lipolysis in type I diabetics who do not have ready access to insulin.<br>
(c)       Methods of use of the Compounds of the Present Invention,<br>
Compounds of the present invention have been found to stimulate autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (Example 11 and 12, below). In addition, these compounds have been shown to enhance insulin's ability to effect the transport of glucose into cultured fibroblast cells (Example 13, below). The compounds have also been shown to lower blood glucose levels in db/db mice in an insulin independent manner (Figures 8 and 9, Example 17; Figure 11, Example 19).<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to stimulate autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and to stimulate the uptake of glucose into cells which is demonstrated in the specific examples 11-24 below, indicates their usefulness in the treatment and management of subjects with diabetes. Without intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention act directly on the kinase function of the insulin receptor and do not necessarily compete with insulin for binding at the insulin-binding site, nor do they effect activation of the receptor by a mechanism similar to that exhibited by insulin- Thus, they are able directly to activate the kinase to autophosphorylate, to potentiate the effect of insulin, to activate the kinase function of<br><br>
the receptor in phosphorylating exogenous substrates and to effect the increased uptake of glucose by adipocytes and insulin receptor-bearing cells in general and to lower blood glucose in diabetic subjects. Accordingly, by virtue of the activities of the compounds of the invention, they may be used to stimulate the kinase activity of an insulin receptor/to enhance the activation of the insulin receptor by insulin, to enhance the stimulation by insulin of cellular glucose uptake, and to stimulate the uptake of glucose in diabetic subjects.  Thus,  the  compounds of this  invention  are  useful  in  the  treatment  of<br>
hyperglycemia and diabetes in mammals.<br>
*<br>
One aspect of the invention is directed to a method of stimulating the kinase<br>
activity of the insulin receptor. This method comprises contacting the insulin receptor, or the kinase portion thereof, with a compound of the invention in an amount sufficient to stimulate the kinase activity of the insulin receptor. By stimulating the kinase activity of the insulin receptor, both autophosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates is enhanced. The stimulation of the kinase activity of the insulin receptor may occur either in vivo or in vitro. The method of stimulating the kinase activity of the insulin receptor may optionally further comprise also contacting the insulin receptor with insulin.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been demonstrated to exhibit stimulatory activity at the insulin receptor with subsequent lowering of circulating glucose levels for a potential therapeutic effect in diabetes illness. Similarly, other compounds which show the same effects on the insulin receptor and, thus, on circulating glucose have the potential to be useful for the treatment of diabetes diseases. The compounds claimed within this patent can be used as a model to discover other new agents that act on the insulin receptor and thereby lower circulating levels of glucose in diabetic patients.

The targeted cells may optionally be in a mammal and the step of contacting the receptor with the compound may then be effected by administering the compound, or pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal. In one embodiment of the method of stimulating the uptake of glucose into cells displaying the insulin receptor, the cells are also contacted with exogenous insulin.<br>
A method of treating hyperglycemia in a mammal, preferably a human, is also contemplated by the present invention. The methods comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to a mammal. Optionally, the method may further comprise treating the   mammal   with   one   or  more   additional   forms   of  therapy   or  treatment   for<br><br>
hyperglycemia. For instance, one method may comprise administering exogenous insulin to the mammal in addition to the compound of the invention. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be administered to the mammal in combination with a non-insulin drug or other alternative treatment for hyperglycemia. The total amount of the combination of drugs administered to the mammal must be a therapeutically effective amount, although the amounts of each of the individual drugs may by themselves be suboptimal for therapeutic purposes.<br>
A very dangerous side-effect of the administration of insulin is insulin-induced hypoglycemia with the potential for coma and, possibly, death. This problem can become quite severe in diabetic patients who develop unpredictable responses to insulin or have hyper-variable levels of circulating glucose. For these patients, the co-administration of these compounds with sub-therapeutic doses of insulin will minimize the possibility that the diabetic patient will over-dose on insulin and suffer from the severe consequences such as coma and death. These compounds appear to be incapable of inducing hypoglycemia in the presence or absence of insulin. They appear to increase the effectiveness of insulin, but do not display true insulin mimetic effects like hypoglycemia. These compounds are, thus, effective insulin safeners.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds are used to treat type I diabetes in a mammal. This method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal. In a preferred embodiment, the mammal is a human. The method of treating type I diabetes may optionally further comprise treating the mammal with one or more additional therapies or treatments for type I diabetes. For instance, in one embodiment of the method of treating type I diabetes, a compound of the invention and insulin may both be administered to the mammal. Alternatively, the additional form of treatment for type I diabetes which is combined with administration of the compound of the invention may be an antidiabetic agent other than insulin or another alternative form of treatment for type I diabetes. Again, the total amount of the combination of antidiabetic agents administered to the mammal must be a therapeutically effective amount, although the amounts of each of the individual drugs may be sub-optimal for therapeutic purposes if those drugs were to be delivered alone to the mammal with type I diabetes.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat type II diabetes in a mammal. This'method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal. Again, the preferred subject is a human.<br>
Again, like the other treatment methods of the invention, this method may further comprise treating the mammal with one or more additional forms of therapy for type II diabetes, such as administering insulin to the mammal. The insulin is delivered to the mammal in an amount which is therapeutically effective when used in conjunction with a compound of the invention. This therapeutically effective amount of insulin when used in combination with a compound of the invention may be less than the amount of insulin which would be therapeutically effective if delivered to the mammal alone. It is understood that the insulin which is administered in any of the treatments of the present invention may either be isolated from a natural source or be recombinant. In addition, an insulin analog may be substituted for insulin in any of the treatments of the present invention.<br>
Use of the compounds of the invention for treating type II diabetes by combination therapy may also comprise the administration of the compound of the invention to the mammal in combination with a non-insulin, antidiabetic agent or other treatment for type II diabetes. For instance, the antidiabetic drug which is administered to the mammal in combination with a compound of the invention may optionally be a thiazolidinedione, such as troglitazone, or a sulphonylurea. The total amount of the combination of drugs (invention compound plus insulin, and/or other antidiabetic drug) administered to the mammal for the treatment of type II diabetes must be a therapeutically effective amount, although the amount of each of the individual drugs used in the combination therapy may be suboptimal for therapeutic purposes if that drug were to be delivered alone to the mammal with type II diabetes.<br>
The compounds of this invention are thus used to enhance glucose uptake in patients which require such treatment. The method of treatment comprises the administration parenterally, and orally, of an effective quantity of Ihe chosen compound of the invention, preferably dispersed in a pharmaceutical carrier. Dosage units of the<br><br>
active ingredient are generally selected from the range of 0.01 to 1000 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 to 100 mg/kg and more preferably 0.1 to 50 mg/kg, but will be readily determined by one skilled in the art depending upon the route of administration, age and condition of the patient. The compounds of the invention are most preferably administered in a dosage unit of 1 to 10 mg/kg. These dosage units may be administered one to ten times daily for acute or chronic disease. No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the invention are administered in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The invention compounds may be administered by any route suitable to the subject being treated and the nature of the subject's condition. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, administration by injection, including intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injection, * by transmucosal or transdermal delivery, through topical applications, nasal spray, suppository and the like or may be administered orally. Formulations may optionally be liposomal formulations, emulsions, formulations designed to administer the drug across mucosal membranes or transdermal formulations. Suitable formulations for each of these methods of administration may be found, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, latest edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA.<br>

In a condensation reaction, a simple substance, such as water, is released by the combination of two or more molecules. The condensation reaction may occur upon addition of any of a number of starting materials utilized in organic syntheses, such as dibromoethane and diiodopropane, at a temperature between 50 and 125 C. Should R3 and R4 in Formulae A and B together may be -(CH^-, -{CH2)3-, or (CH^-, then the condensation is intramolecular (see Reaction Scheme VI).<br>
Chemical elaboration of one or more substituents R1, R2, R5, and R6 or Y via the conversion of one such substituent into another substituent may be accomplished via hydrolysis, salt formation, acidification, alkylation, esterification, oxidation, or reduction. In hydrolysis, an ester or amide compound is dissociated by reaction with water. Hydrolysis is catalyzed by acid or base, and hydrolysis of an amide generally requires more vigorous conditions (for example, a higher concentration of sulfuric acid at 1 to 100 C for 1 to 5 hours) than those required for the hydrolysis of esters. Hydrolysis reactions can also be carried out with aqueous hydrochloric acid at 100 to 150 C and may require as long as 18 hours.<br><br>
In salt formation, a free acid is converted into a salt via addition of a basic reagent, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or triethanolamine, that replaces all or part of the hydrogen ions of the acid with one or more cations of a base. The conversion of a compound into its corresponding acid addition salt is accomplished via treatment with a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid. Typically, the free base is dissolved in a polar organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, and the acid is added in methanol or ethanol. The temperature is maintained at 0 to 50 C. The corresponding salt precipitates spontaneously or can be brought out of solution with a less polar solvent. In acidification, 3 chemical compound is converted into an acid.<br>
In alkylation, an alkyl group is added to or substituted in a compound. Alkyiation is carried out in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile, DMF, or THF, at 0 ot 160 C, typically at approximately 25 C to reflux, and requires some 1 to 18 hours. Finally, an esterification reaction results in the formation of at least one ester product. In brief, the compound is reacted with from 1.0 to 5.0, preferable 2.0, molar equivalents of an alkanol, a thiol or ammonia, a monoalkyl, or dialkylamine, or a heterocyclic aminoalkanol, optionally in the presence of from 1.0 to 1,5, preferably 1.25, molar equivalents of a tertiary organic base such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine or, preferably, triethylamine, in an organic solvent such as dioxane, tetrahydrofiiran, or, preferably, dichloromethane. The reaction takes place at -10 to 50 C, preferably at ambient temperature, for 1 to 24 hours, preferably 4 hours.<br>
Certain compounds of formula I can be prepared via acid addition. Furthermore, the compounds of formula I may be prepared by modifying K (where K has the above meaning), for example, by alkylating K, followed by amino substitution, in which an amino group replaces, for example, a leaving group such as the S-methyl group.<br>
In those cases in which protective groups may be introduced and finally removed, suitable protective groups for amino, hydroxy, carboxyl groups are as described in Greene, et aL, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991. Activation of carboxylic acids can be achieved by using a number of different reagents as described in Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989.<br><br>

To 220 mg (0.24 mmol) of compound 158 was added 10 mL of a 0.5 M NH3 solution in dioxane. The resulting solution was placed in a sealed tube and heated at<br><br>
70° C for 18 hours, followed by 24 hours at 80° C. Then, additional NH3 gas was bubbled into the reaction for 4 min. The reaction was sealed and heating at 80° C continued for an additional 51 hours. Then, the reaction temperature was lowered to 65° C and continued for 11 days. At this point, the reaction had reached 70% completion based upon HPLC analysis. The reaction was stopped by removal of the volatiles by rotary evaporation. The product was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with 3% methanol in dichloromethane followed by 5% methanol in dichloromethane. Finally, the product was eluted with 90:2:1 ethyl acetate:isopropanol:water. This provided 117 mg of compound 159.<br>

To 5lmg (0.013 mmol) of compound 13 dissolved in 1.7 mL of DMF was added 58 µL (0.026 mmol) of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine. Then, in a separate test tube with 13.6 mg (0.020 mmol) of imidizole in 1.7 mL of THF, was added 36 µL (0,007 mmol) of [14C]-phosgene (20% in toluene). This formed a white solid.

Example 11 J2P-cytoplasmic kinase domain (CKD) autophosphorylation assay.<br>
The insulin signaling pathway is activated through stimulation of the insulin receptor. A major component of this activation is the phosphorylation of a specific portion of the receptor called the ß-kinase domain. The complete ß-kinase domain of the human insulin receptor (CKD) was expressed in, and purified from, baculovirus. CKD (4.Oµg/ml), in a solution of 29 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0,05% Triton X^lOO, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCU (5Oµl final volume), was combined with 50 µM ATP, and 5µCi 32P-ATP (3OOOCi/mmol.). A test compound, or the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) was added to a final DMSO concentration of 1%. The mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 µl of 2OOmM EDTA. A 3Oµl volume was removed, mixed with 5 µl of 6X Laemmeli sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment buffer, and heated to 94°C for 5 minutes, A 20 µl aliquot was then run on an SDS-PAGE gel The radioactivity incorporated into the CKD band was quantified by phosphorimaging of the gel, or scintillation counting of the excised bands. The potency of a compound for increasing phosphorylation was expressed as % of the vehicle level. The results for this assay are shown in Table 11, below.<br><br><br><br>
Example 12 Whole-cell phosphorylation assay:<br>
The initial step in insulin signaling is phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in response to insulin binding. NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human insulin receptor (3T3HIR) were grown for 2 days at a density of 2xl 07ml cells in 6 well culture dishes in DMEM with 10% FBS and L-Glutamine. Prior to the experiment the cells were serum-starved overnight with DMEM with 0.1% BSA. The following morning, the cells were washed with PBS and the medium was replaced with l5OmM NaCl, l.7mM KG, O.9mM CaCl2 K2HP04 (pH 7.4), to which were added either the experimental compounds, or their vehicle (DMSO). Insulin or its vehicle (0.01% BSA) was diluted in the assay buffer (containing test compound or vehicle, respectively) to a final concentration of 2.5nM. After incubating for l5min, the cells were washed with cold PBS twice and lysed in 5OmM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4 l5OmM NaCl, 025% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, ImM<br><br>
EGTA, ImM PMSF, lmM Na3V04, lmM NaF, lug/ml each of Aprotinin, Leupeptin and Pepstatin. The cell lysates were clarified by centriftigation at 12000 rpm, and the supematants were estimated for protein concentration. Total cell lysate (-20 X g) was boiled with 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3 min and and loaded into 7.5% SDS-PAGE along with Amersham rainbow marker protein as a molecular weight standard-After completing SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane and Western analysis was carried out by incubating the blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and developed by Enhanced Chemiluminiscence (ECL),as Shown in Figure 1. Shown in Figure 2 is the increase of autophosphorylation by Compounds 13 and 15 at various concentrations.<br>
Example 13 Glucose transport activity assay.<br>
Stimulation of the insulin receptor leads to the transport of glucose from the blood into cells, thus modulating blood glucose levels. 3T3 LI fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were plated at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Two days after confluence was reached, the cells were treated for 3 days with O.5mM isobutyimethylxanthine (IBMX), lµM dexamethasone, and l.7µM insulin. The cells were then transferred to DMEM with 10% FBS and supplemented with l.7µM insulin for 2 more days. The cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for an additional 4 days. Finally the cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DMEM.<br>
The following day, the medium was replaced with 150 mM NaCl, 1,7 miM KG, 0.9 mM CaCl2, K2HP04 (pH 7.4) to which were added either the experimental compounds or their vehicle (DMSO). Insulin or its vehicle (0.01% BSA) was diluted in the assay buffer (containing test compound or vehicle, respectively) to final concentration of 5.6 nM. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, 5µCi/ml uC-2-deoxy~D-glucose was added, and the incubation was continued for additional 30 min at 37°C The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS/2OmM glucose and lysed in 25Oµl of<br><br>
lysis buffer (5OmM Hepes pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. Radioactivity in the lysate was quantified by scintillation counting.<br>
Once I4C-2-deoxy-D-glucose is transported into the cell, it is not released. Glucose transport is, therefore, proportional to the amount of radioactivity in the lysate. The concentration of compound necessary to produce an increase in glucose transport to greater than 150% of the vehicle control (generally representing the sum of the standard deviation of the vehicle control plus the largest standard deviation of a test sample) was recorded as the EC (effective concentration). The results are shown in Table 12. Shown in Figure 3 is glucose uptake by cells at various concentrations when treated with Compound 13 and Compound 15.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 14 Effect of Wortmannin and Cytochalasin on glucose uptake:<br>
The glucose transport pathway stimulated by insulin involves activation of PI3 Kinase, Wortmannin is a selective inhibitor of PI3 Kinase and inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport- 3T3 LI adipocytes were pretreated with lGOnM Wortmannin and stimulated with the compounds in the presence or absence of insulin. Wortmannin inhibited the stimulation of glucose transport, measured as in Example 11, by either Compound 15 alone or Compound 15 plus 5.6nM insulin. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport is mediated by glucose transporter proteins. Cytochalasin B is- an inhibitor of glucose transporters and inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Like Wortmannin, Cytochalasin B (lOµM) also inhibited the stimulation of glucose transport, measured as in Example 13, by either Compound 15 alone or Compound 15 plus 5.6nM insulin. These results suggest that the activation of glucose transport by the compounds utilizes the insulin signaling machinery of the cells. Results are shown in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Example 15 Immunofluorescence analysis of GLUT4 mobilization in 3T3 LI adipocytes<br>
Insulin-dependent transport of glucose into cells utilizes glucose 'transporter proteins, such as GLUT4. Stimulation with insulin causes these transporters to translocate from storage sites within the cell to the cell membrane, where they facilitate glucose entry.<br><br>
3T3 LI adipocytes were grown and differentiated as in Example 11, except that they were grown on a microscope chamber slide. The cells were serum-starved with 0.1% BSA in DMEM for l6hrs and stimulated with 56µM Compound 15 alone, lOOnM Insulin for lhr at 37°C, The cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.2% saponin in l%BSA, TBS for 5 min.followed by incubation with anti-GLUT4 antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were extensively washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed, air-dried and mounted with mounting medium and examined under confocal microscope (Stuart A. Ross et. al 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271: 3328-3332.)<br>
As shown in Figure 6, in unstimulated cells, the GLUT4 immunofluorescence was distributed throughout the cell (figure 6A). Following stimulation by insulin, GLUT4 was seen primarily at the cell surface (figure 6B), consistent with insulin-induced translocation. Treatment of cells with Compound 15 also produced apparent translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (figure 6C), consistent with its ability to stimulate glucose transport into cells in an insulin-like manner.<br>
Example 16 Selectivity vs. EGFR, PDGFR and IGFR<br>
In order to determine the selectivity of these compounds for the insulin receptor, their effects on other receptors that share a similar mechanism of activation with the insulin receptor were examined. Human epidermoid carcinoma (A43l) cells were plated at a density of 2X105 cells per well in 6-well dishes in DMEM with 10% FBS and L-Glutamine and allowed to grow to 75% confluence. Prior to the experiment, the cells were serum-starved overnight with DMEM with 0.1% BSA, The following morning, the cells were washed with PBS and the medium was replaced with l5OmM NaCl, l.7mM KCl O.9mM CaCL›, K2HP04 (pH 7.4), to which was added either the experimental compound or its vehicle (DMSO), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) or its vehicle (0.01% BSA) was diluted in the assay buffer (containing test compound or vehicle respectively) to a final concentration of 2,5ng/ml. After incubating for l5min, the cells were washed with cold PBS twice and lysed in 5OmM Tris.HCl pH7.4, l5OmM NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, l%NP4O› ImM EGTA, ImM PMSF, ImM Na3V04, ImM NaF, lug/ml<br><br>
each of Aprotinin, Leupeptin and Pepstatin. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12000 rpm, and the supernatants were estimated for protein concentration. Total cell lysate (~-20µg) was boiled with 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3min and loaded in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE along with Amersham rainbow marker protein as a molecular weight standard.<br>
After completing SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane and Western analysis was carried out by incubating the blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and developed by Enhanced Chemiluminiscence (ECL). Results are shown in Figure 7.<br>
Compound 15 did not increase the phosphorylation of EGFR in the presence or absence of EGF. Using modifications of this protocol know to those skilled in the art, as well as the appropriate cell types, Compound 15 was likewise found not to increase the phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) or the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors either in the absence or presence of their endogenous ligands (IGF-1 and PDGF, respectively).<br>
Example 17 Blood glucose level determination in db/db mouse.<br>
An accepted model for Type 2 diabetes which has been used to establish the potential anti-diabetic activity of compounds is the db/db mouse. Seven to 9 week old male db/db mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine), were used to the study of the effects of compounds on blood glucose levels. Animals were kept in a I2h/I2h light/dark cycle, and experiments were initiated immediately after the dark period (7:00 a.m.). Food was removed at this time and returned after the final blood glucose measurement was taken.<br>
Insulin (O,5U/ml, Humulin R, Catalog HI-201, Lilly, Indianapolis, Indiana) was prepared by diluting lOOU/mL stock insulin 1:200 with PBS (phosphate buffered saline, Gibco„ BRL). Compounds were prepared in a vehicle of either PBS or 20% DMSO in PBS.<br>
Five to 10 animals (average weight 40-50g) were used in each treatment condition. The animals were injected subcutaneously with either 0-.01U insulin in PBS or PBS alone, followed by 0.1 mL of compound or its vehicle delivered intraperitoneally.<br><br>
Blood samples were taken 0 min, 15 min, 3Omin, lhr, 2hr and 4hr after the administration of the drug or vehicle by tail bleeding. Glucose measurements were made with a Glucometer and Glucose strips (Bayer).<br>
The resulting data are shown in Figures 8 and 9. In Figure 8, blood glucose levels at various time points are shown following injections with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) only, insulin in PBS, or with compound 15 and insulin in PBS. The blood glucose levels are reported as the percentage of the "0-time" values at the time points indicated. Figure 9 shows the effect of compound 15 alone (without added insulin) on blood glucose levels in db/db mice. Blood glucose levels at various time points are shown in Figure 9 following injection of db/db mice with compound 15 together with its vehicle (DMSO) and insulin in PBS, Blood glucose levels at various time points following injections either with PBS alone are also shown for comparison. From the data it can be seen that compound 15 acts in an insulin-independent manner to lower blood glucose levels.<br>
Example 13 Lowering of blood glucose, insulin and triglycerides in the ob/ob mouse model of Type 2 diabetes<br>
Another standard model of Type 2 diabetes is the ob/ob mouse, Male ob/ob mice (C57 BL/6J-ob) were housed 3-5 to a cage with free access to standard rodent chow pellets. After one week , they were given a single dose of Compound 15 (3Omg/kg, p.o.). Compound 15 produced a 13% decrease in blood glucose levels, a 42% decrease in plasma insulin levels, and a 15% decrease in plasma triglyceride levels. The concomitant reduction of plasma glucose and insulin levels are consistent with a reduction in insulin resistance. Results are shown in Figure 10<br>
Example 19 Blood glucose determination in the STZ/HFD rat model of Type 2 diabetes<br>
Representative compounds were also profiled in genetically normal rats given a high-fat diet followed by treatment with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ/HFD), This treatment regimen recreates both the insulin resistance and the hyperglycemia seen in human Type 2 diabetes. Male CD rats (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor ME) were maintained<br><br>
according to NIH guidelines, housed two per cage, and fed either standard lab chow (Tekiand Laboratory Diets, James Grain, San Jose, CA) or the same chow supplemented with chocolate bars, cookies, and potato chips such that their final diet contained 30% fat by weight (high-fat diet; HFD). After two weeks of this diet, the animals were given an injection of freshly-prepared streptozotocin (35mg/kg, i.p.) and continued on the HFD. Animals that achieved glucose levels of 190 to 38Omg/dl were used in this study. At the •end of the 12-hour light/dark cycle, and just prior to the experiment, the animals were moved to new cages with no food available until 4 hours after treatment- The compound or vehicle (PBS) was given p.o. by gavage, and blood was sampled.by approved IACUC protocol using tail cap method. Glucose was determined using the Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Elkhart, IN).<br>
Compound 15 produced a reduction in blood glucose levels beginning one hour after administration and persisting for the entire 6 hours of the experiment (figure 11). The reduction was maximal (20%) 4 hours after the administration of Compound 15. The potencies of other compounds in this model are shown in Table 13.<br>

Example 20<br>
Rat Muscle phosphorylation<br>
Muscle is a particularly important tissue for taking up glucose from the blood in response to insulin receptor stimulation. Activation of muscle insulin receptors is, therefore, an important factor in the control of blood glucose levels. STZ/HFD rats prepared as in Example 18 were given an oral dose of Compound 15 (3Omg/kg), and muscle samples were harvested at different time points (O.5hx, lhr, 2hr, 3hr, 4hr7 6hr) and<br><br>
homogenized in extraction buffer (5OmM Tris.HCl pH7.4, l5OmM NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, l%NP4O, ImM EGTA, ImM PMSF, ImM Na3V04, lmM NaF, lug/ml each of Aprotinin, Leupeptin and Pepstatin), The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 12K for 3Omin at 4°C, and the supematants were saved. An equal protein amount from each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibody for 2hr at 4°C, followed by another Ihr incubation with Protein G-Agarose beads. The immunecomplexes were washed three times with the extraction buffer, and the samples were boiled in 2X SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5min at IGO°C. The samples were resolved in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE along with Amersham rainbow marker protein as a molecular weight standard.<br>
After completing SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane and Western analysis was carried out by incubating the blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and developed by Enhanced Chemiluminiscence (ECL). Figure 12 shows that Compound 15 produced an increase in phosphorylation of the insulin receptor with a time-course consistent with that of blood glucose reduction (Figure 11).<br>
Example 21 Multi-dosing in db/db mice<br>
Male db/db mice 7 to 8 weeks old (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were given Compound 15 (56mg/kg, p.o.) or an equivalent amount of its vehicle (PBS), as in Example 17, daily for 3 days. Blood samples were taken by an lACUC-approved protocol (tail cap method) immediately before each dose or 3 hours later. Blood glucose levels were measured using a Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Elkhart, IN). Blood glucose levels showed little change two hours after PBS administration (figure 13). In contrast, compound 15 lowered blood glucose levels 2 hours after administration on each of the 3 days by 14 to 29%,<br><br>
Example 22 Multi-dosing in STZ/HFD rats<br>
STZ/HFD rats were prepared as in example 19. Compound 15 or an equivalent amount of the vehicle (PBS) was administered daily by the oral route at a dose of 3Omg/kg. Blood samples were taken by an IACUC-approved protocol (tail cap method) immediately before each dose and 4 and 6 (day one only) hours later. Blood glucose levels were measured using a Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Elkhart, IN). The blood glucose levels of the vehicle-treated group fell over the course of the experiment as the animals recovered from the low dose of STZ (figure 14). Compound 15 administration lowered blood glucose levels below those of the vehicle-treated group by 6 hours after administration, and this lowering was sustained throughout the remainder of the 3 days.<br>
Example 23 Acute Toxicity<br>
Compound 15 was administered in PBS vehicle to male db/db mice (i.p.) and male CD rats (p.o.) at 3GOmg/kg, which is approximately 10 times its effective dose. No acute toxicity was seen.<br>
Example 24 Ames Test (Compound 4)<br>
Compound 4 was tested for its ability to cause mutations in the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA89, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537, and at the tryptophan operon of Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA. These represent standard tests for the mutagenic potential of compounds and are collectively called the Ames Test. The<br>
compounds were tested at non-toxic doses (50 to 5OOOµg/plate) in the absence of exogenous activation and in the presence of induced rat liver S-9 plus cofactors. Under the conditions of this study, the compounds did not induce any significant increase in the number of revertant colonies for any of the tester strains and were, therefore, judged negative in the Salmonella typhimurium/Eshcerichia coli Plate Incorporation Mutation Assay.<br><br>
Example 25 P45O Interactions<br>
A major pathway for elimination of drugs from the body, which may limit their effectiveness, is the cytochrome P45O system of the liver. Compound 15 did not inhibit the catalytic activity of the human cytochromes P45O, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4. In addition, Compounds 15, 53, and 48 were not metabolized by rate liver microsomes after a 1-hour incubation.<br>

Example 29 Distribution of Compound-[14C]-15 after oral administration<br>
STZ/HFD rats, prepared as in Example 19, were given a single oral dose of 3Omg/kg compound-[14C]-15 labeled with 5OµCi of 14C prepared as in Example 11A. Two hours later the animals were euthanized and 2OOmg samples of various tissues were removed by an IACUC-approved protocol. The tissue samples were homogenized and their radioactivity content was measured by scintillation counting. The highest levels of radioactivity were found in the pancreas, liver, and thigh muscle. These corresponded to Compound 15 concentrations of approximately 78OnM, 2OOnM, and 175nM, respectively. These concentrations would be sufficient to produce insulin receptor phosphorylation in vitro. Lower levels of radioactivity indicative of 5OnM to lOOnM concentrations of the compound were found in abdominal muscle, fat, kidney, and spleen.   The amount of radioactivity in the blood was not above background levels.<br>
