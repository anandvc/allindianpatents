OR PROPENOIC ACID AS H1 AND H3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF<br>
INFLAMMATORY AND/OR ALLERGIC DISORDERS<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, processes for their preparation,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of various<br>
diseases, in particular inflammatory and/or allergic diseases of the respiratory tract.<br>
Allergic rhinitis, pulmonary inflammation and congestion are medical conditions that are<br>
often associated with other conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
disease (COPD), seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis. !n general these<br>
conditions are mediated, at least in part, by inflammation associated with the release of<br>
histamine from various cells, in particular mast ceiis.<br>
Allergic rhinitis, also known as 'hay fever", affects a large proportion of the population<br>
worldwide. There are two types of allergic rhinitis, seasonal and perennial. The clinical<br>
symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis typically include nasal itching and irritation,<br>
sneezing and watery rhinorrhea which is often accompanied by nasal congestion. The<br>
clinical symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are similar except that nasal blockage may<br>
be more pronounced. Either type of allergic rhinitis may also cause other symptoms such<br>
as itching of the throat and/or eyes, epiphora and oedema around the eyes. The<br>
symptoms of allergic rhinitis may vary in intensity from the nuisance level to debilitating.<br>
Allergic rhinitis and other allergic conditions are associated with the release of histamine<br>
from various cell types, but particularly mast cells. The physiological effects of histamine<br>
are classically mediated by three receptor subtypes, termed H1, H2 and H3. H1 receptors<br>
are widely distributed throughout the CNS and periphery, and are involved in wakefulness<br>
and acute inflammation H2 receptors mediate gastric acid secretion in response to<br>
histamine. H3 receptors are present on the nerve endings in both the CNS and periphery<br>
and mediate inhibition of neurotransmitter release [Hill et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 49:253-<br>
278, (1997)]. Recently a fourth member of the histamine receptor family has been<br>
identified, termed the H4 receptor [Hough, Mol. Pharmacol., 59:415-419, (2001)]. Whilst<br>
the distribution of the H4 receptor appears to be restricted to cells of the immune and<br>
inflammatory systems, a physiological role for this receptor remains to be clarified.<br><br>
The activation of H1 receptors in blood vessels and nerve endings is responsible for many<br>
of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which include itching, sneezing, and the production of<br>
watery rhinorrhea. Antihistamine compounds, i.e. drugs which are selective H1 receptor<br>
antagonists such as chlorphenyramine and cetirizine, are effective in treating the itching,<br>
sneezing and rhinorrhea associated with allergic rhinitis, but are not effective against the<br>
nasal congestion symptoms [Aaronson, Ann. Allergy, 67:541-547, (1991)]. Thus H1<br>
receptor antagonists have been administered in combination with syrnpathomimetic<br>
ggents such as pseudoephedrine or oxymetazoline to treat the nasal congestion<br>
symptoms of allergic rhinitis. These drugs are thought to produce a decongestant action<br>
by activating Î²-adrenergic receptors and increasing the vascular tone of blood vessels in<br>
the nasal mucosa. The use of sympathomimetic drugs for the treatment of nasal<br>
congestion is frequently limited by the CNS stimulant properties and their effects on blood<br>
pressure and heart rate. A treatment which decreases nasal congestion without having<br>
effects on the CNS and cardiovascular system may therefore offer advantages over<br>
existing therapies.<br>
Histamine H3 receptors are expressed widely on both CNS and peripheral nerve endings<br>
and mediate the inhibition of neurotransmitter release. In vitro electrical stimulation of<br>
peripheral sympathetic nerves in isolated human saphenous vein results in an increase in<br>
noradrenaline release and smooth muscle contraction, which can be inhibited by<br>
histamine H3 receptor agonists [Molderings et a/., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.<br>
Pharmacol., 346:46-50, (1992); Valentine et ai, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 366:73-78, (1999)].<br>
H3 receptor agonists also inhibit the effect of sympathetic nerve activation on vascular<br>
tone in porcine nasal mucosa [Varty &amp; Hey., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 452:339-345, (2002)]. In<br>
vivo, H3 receptor agonists inhibit the decrease in nasal airway resistance produced by<br>
sympathetic nerve activation [Hey et al., Arzneim-Forsch Drug Res., 48:881-888, (1998)].<br>
Activation of histamine H3 receptors in human nasal mucosa inhibits sympathetic<br>
vasoconstriction [Varty et ai, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 484:83-89, (2004)]. Furthermore, H3<br>
receptor antagonists, in combination with histamine H1 receptor antagonists, have been<br>
shown to reverse the effects of mast cell activation on nasal airway resistance and nasal<br>
cavity volume, an index of nasal congestion [Mcleod et al., Am. J. Rhinol., 13:391-399,<br>
(1999)], and further evidence for the contribution of H3 receptors to histamine-induced<br>
nasal blockage is provided by histamine nasai challenge studies performed on normal<br><br>
human subjects [Taylor-Clark et al., fir. J. Pharmacol., 144, 867-874, (2005)], although<br>
the H3 mechanism in this regard would appear to be novel and unprecedented.<br>
A novel class of compounds has been found that are dual histamine H1 and H3 receptor<br>
antagonists By 'dual' histamine H1 and H3 receptor antagonists it is meant that the<br>
compound has activity at both receptor subtypes. In particular the activity at the H1<br>
receptor may be within approximately 10 fold of the activity at the H3 receptor and more<br>
particularly such compounds may be approximately equipotent at both receptor subtypes.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides, in a first aspect, a compound of formula (1)<br><br>
wherein<br>
the naphthalene ring is substituted in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 position by R1, and R1<br>
represents -CH2CH2COOH or -CH=C(CH3)COOH;<br>
or a salt thereof, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be expected to be useful in the treatment of various<br>
disorders, in particular inflammatory and/or allergic disorders, such as inflammatory and/or<br>
allergic disorders of the respiratory tract, for example allergic rhinitis, that are associated<br>
with the release of histamine from cells such as mast cells<br>
The compounds of the invention may show an improved profile over known dual H1/H3<br>
receptor antagonists agonists in that they may possess one or more of the following<br>
properties:<br>
(i) H3 receptor antagonist activity with a pKi of greater than about 7,<br>
(ii) H1 receptor antagonist agonist activity with a pKi of greater than 7;<br>
(iii) lower CNS penetration;<br><br>
(iv) improved bioavailability; and<br>
(v) lower clearance and/or longer half-life in blood.<br>
Compounds having such a profile may be expected to be orally effective, and/or capable<br>
of once daily administration and/or further may have an improved side effect profile<br>
compared with other existing therapies.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, R1 represents -CH2CH2COOH.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the naphthalene ring is substituted in the 4<br>
position by R1.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) include the compound of the Examples as described below and<br>
salts thereof, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Thus, in a further aspect the present invention provides a compound 3-(4-{[4-(4-{[3-(3,3-<br>
dimethyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl]oxy}phenyl)-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}-1-naphthalenyl)propanoic<br>
acid or a salt thereof, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
It is to be further understood that references hereinafter to a compound according to the<br>
invention or to compounds of the invention includes one or more compounds of formula (I)<br>
and salts thereof, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The present invention encompasses geometric isomers of the compounds of formula (I)<br>
including cis and trans configurations, and regioisomers including exo and endo double<br>
bonds (e g. -CH=C(CH3)COOH and -CH-C(=CH2)COOH), whether as individual isomers<br>
isolated such as to be substantially free of the other isomers (i.e. pure) or as mixtures<br>
thereof. Thus for example the present invention encompases an individual isomer isolated<br>
such as to be substantially free of the other isomer (i.e.pure) such that less than 10%, for<br>
example less than 1% or less than 0 1% of the other isomer is present Separation of<br>
geometric isomers may be achieved by conventional techniques, e.g. by fractional<br>
crystallisation, chromatography or HPLC.<br><br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) may exist in one of several tautomeric forms. It will be<br>
understood that the present invention encompasses all tautomers of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) whether as individual tautomers or as mixtures thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be in crystalline or amorphous form. Furthermore, a<br>
compound of formula (I) may exist in one or more polymorphic forms. Thus, the present<br>
invention includes within its scope aii polymorphic forms of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
In general, the most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form of a compound of<br>
formula (I) is of particular interest.<br>
Polymorphic forms of compounds of formula (I) may be characterized and differentiated<br>
using a number of conventional analytical techniques, including but not limited to X-ray<br>
powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns, infrared (IR) spectra, Raman spectra, differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and solid state nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR).<br>
It will be appreciated that many organic compounds can form solvates with the solvents in<br>
which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. For example, a<br>
solvate with water is known as a "hydrate". Solvents with high boiling points and/or<br>
solvents with a high propensity to form hydrogen bonds such as water, xylene, A/-methyl<br>
pyrrolidinone and methanol may be used to form solvates. Methods for identification of<br>
solvates include, but are not limited to, NMR and microanalysis. Thus, solvates of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of and/or may be<br>
administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For a review on suitable salts see<br>
Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
include acid and base addition salts.<br>
Typically, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired<br>
acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by<br>
filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.<br><br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt can be formed by reaction of a<br>
compound of formula (I) with a suitable inorganic or organic acid (such as hydrobromic,<br>
hydrochloric, formic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric,<br>
tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid),<br>
optionally in a suitable solvent such as an organic solvent, to give the salt which is<br>
usually isolated for example by crystallisation and filtration. Thus, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition sait of a compound of formula (I) can be for example a<br>
hydrobromide, hydrochlortde, formate, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, succinate, maleate,<br>
acetate, fumarate, citrate, tartrate, benzoate, p-toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate or<br>
napnthalenesulfonate salt.<br>
In one embodiment, there is provided a hydrochloride salt of the compound 3-(4-{[4-(4-{[3-<br>
(3,3-dimethy!-1-piperidinyl)propyl]oxy}phenyl)-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}-1-<br>
naphthalenyl)propanoic acid.<br>
In another embodiment, there is provided a hydrobromide salt of the compound 3-(4-{[4-<br>
(4-{[3-(3,3-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl]oxy}pheny!)-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}-1-<br>
naphthalenyl)propanoic acid.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt can be formed by reaction of a<br>
compound of formula (I) with a suitable inorganic or organic base (e.g. triethylamine,<br>
ethanolamine, triethanolamine, choline, argmine, lysine or histidine), optionally in a<br>
suitable solvent such as an organic solvent, to give the base addition salt which is usually<br>
isolated for example by crystallisation and filtration.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
metal salts, for example pharmaceutically acceptable alkali-metal or alkaline-earth-metal<br>
salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts; in particular<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts of one or more carboxylic acid moieties that may<br>
be present in the the compound of formula (I).<br>
Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts, eg. oxalates or trifluoroacetates, may be<br>
used, for example in the isolation of compounds of the invention, and are included within<br><br>
the scope of this invention. The invention includes within its scope all possible<br>
stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms of the salts of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Included within the scope of the invention are all solvates e.g. hydrates and polymorphs of<br>
compounds and salts of the invention<br>
The present invention aiso provides processes Tor the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a salt thereof.<br>
According to first process (A), a compound of formula (I) may be prepared by deprotecting<br>
and optionally hydrogenating a compound of formula (la)<br><br>
wherein<br>
 represents a single or a double bond, and the naphthalene ring is substituted in the<br>
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 position by R1a, and R1a represents a protected derivative of R1 such as<br>
an ester of R1, for example, -CH2CH2COORX or -CH=C(CH3)COORx in which each Rx<br>
independently represents a carboxylic acid protecting group such C1-C6 alkyl, for example,<br>
methyl, ethyl or t-butyl, especially methyl or ethyl. Other suitable protecting groups<br>
include aralkyl such as benzyl.<br>
Deprotection may be performed under standard conditions. Thus, hydrolysis of a<br>
carboxylic acid ester may be performed in the presence of a suitable base, for example,<br>
sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, in a suitable aqueous solvent system such as<br>
methanol/water or tetrahydrofuran/water, optionally at an elevated temperature such as<br>
reflux. Alternatively, hydrolysis of a carboxylic acid ester, for example, the f-butyl ester<br>
may be performed in the presence of a suitable acid such as hydrogen chloride in dioxane<br>
under standard conditions for acid hydrolysis. Deprotection by hydrogenolysis under<br><br>
standard conditions, such as in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium-on-<br>
charcoal may be employed when the protecting group is aralkyl such as benzyl<br>
Hydrogenation may be performed under standard conditions. Thus, hydrogenation may<br>
be performed in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation agent such as palladium on<br>
carbon or platinum oxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, optionally at atmospheric<br>
pressure, and optionally at an elevated temperature such as 40 to 60 Â°C.<br>
In one embodiment of process A, R1a is as defined, and	represents a single bond<br>
in which case a hydrogenation step is not required<br>
Compounds of formula (la) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II)<br><br><br>
wherein represents a single or a double bond, under amide forming conditions<br>
The amide of formula (la) may be prepared under standard conditions for amide coupling,<br>
for example in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as O-(benzotnazol-1-yi)-<br>
N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) or O-(benzotnazol-1-yl)-<br>
N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), in the presence of a suitable base<br>
such as triethylamine, in an appropriate solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide<br><br>
Alternatively compound (!a) may be prepared by reacting an acid chloride of a compound<br>
of formula (II) with an amine (III) in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine<br>
or potassium carbonate, in a solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature between<br>
0 and 20 Â°C.<br>
A compound of formula (II) wherein R1a represents -CH2CH2COORX and Rx is as defined<br>
above may pe prepared by nydrogenation of a compound of formuia (iV)<br><br>
wherein the naphthalene ring is substituted in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 position by R , and<br>
R1b represents -CH=CH-COORX and Rx is as defined above.<br>
Hydrogenation is performed under standard conditions. Thus, hydrogenation may be<br>
performed in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation agent such as palladium on carbon<br>
or platinum oxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, optionally at atmospheric<br>
pressure, and optionally at an elevated temperature such as 40 to 60 Â°C.<br>
A compound of formula (IV) as defined above may be prepared by a Heck reaction in<br>
which a compound of formula (V) or a protected derivative thereof<br><br>
wherein the naphthalene ring is substituted in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 position by bromine<br>
or iodine, is reacted with an acrylate ester such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, f-butyl<br>
acrylate and benzyl acrylate.<br><br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the Br/I substituent will be in the<br>
position at which it is desired to introduce the carboxylate group in the compound of<br>
formula (IV)<br>
Generally, the Heck reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable base such<br>
as triethylamine, a pnosphine such as triphenylphosphine, a suitable catalyst such as<br>
palladium (II) acetate, in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethyiformamide, at an<br>
elevated temperature, for example about 100Â°C.<br>
In an alternative method, a compound of formula (IV) described above may be prepared<br>
by a Wittig reaction in which a corresponding compound of formula (VI)<br><br>
wherein the naphthalene ring is substituted in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 position by CHO,<br>
is reacted with a phosphorus ylid containing a carboalkoxymethylene group (-CH-COORx<br>
wherein Rx represents C^ alkyl) such as carboethoxymethylene-triphenylphosphorane, in<br>
a suitable solvent such as toluene, at an elevated temperature such as reflux.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) wherein R1a represents -CH=C(CH3)COORX and R* is as<br>
defined above may be prepared by a Heck reaction in which a compound of formula (V) or<br>
a protected derivative thereof is reacted with an acrylate ester such as methyl<br>
methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate or t-butyl methacrylate, under similar conditions to the<br>
Heck reaction described above<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula (II) wherein R1a represents -CH=C(CH3)COORx and<br>
Rx is as defined above may be prepared by a Wittig reaction in which a compound or<br>
formula (VI) as described above is reacted with a phosphorus ylid containing a<br>
carboalkoxymethylene group (-CH-COORX wherein Rx represents C1-6 alkyl) such as<br>
carboethoxyethylene-triphenylphosphorane, under similar conditions to the Wittig reaction<br>
described above.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (V) and (VI) are known, or may be prepared from commercially<br>
available materials (for example 1,4-dibromonaphthalene is commercially available from<br>
Acros and/or Alfa) in accordance with published methods or by the methods described<br>
herein. 5-bromo-1-naphthalenecarboxylic acid may be prepared by the methods<br>
described in J E. Baldwin, et al., Tetrahedron 1990, 46, 3019-28, 4-bromo-1-<br>
napnihaienecarboxyiic acid may be prepared by the methods described in Can. J. Chern.<br>
1981, 59, 2629-41; and 8-formyl-1-naphthalenecarboxylic acid may be prepared by the<br>
methods described in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1949, 71, 1870.<br>
Acrylate esters are known and/or are commercially avaiiabie. Methyl acryiate, methyl<br>
methacrylate and benzylacrylate are available from Aldrich and/or Acros and/or ABCR<br>

compound of formula (la); and<br>
(ii) deprotecting and optionally dehydrogenating the compound of formula (la) to form<br>
a compound of formula (I).<br>
In process (B) the intermediate protected amide for example the amide ester (la) is not<br>
isolated. Amide coupling and deprotection, such as by carboxylic acid ester hydrolysis,<br>
and optional hydrogenation may be performed under standard conditions as described<br>
above.<br>
According to a third process (C) a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents<br>
-CH2CH2COOH may be prepared by hydrogenating and deprotecting a compound of<br>
formula (Ic)<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
represents a single or a double bond, and the naphthalene ring can be substituted<br>
in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 position by R1c and R1c represents -CH=CHCOORX wherein RX<br>
represents a suitable carboxylic acid protecting group such as aralkyl e.g. benzyl.<br>
Hydrogenation and deprotection (by hydrogenolysis) may be performed under standard<br>
conditions such as those that are described herein, and may be combined in a single step.<br>
A compound of formula (Ic) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (IV) with<br>
a compound of formula (III).<br>
According to a fourth process (D), a compound of formula (I) may be prepared by<br>
interconversion from other compounds of formula (I). Thus, a compound of formula (I)<br>
may also be prepared from other compounds of formula (I) using conventional<br>
interconversion procedures such as isomerisation of geometric isomers e.g.<br>
interconversion between cis and trans isomers and interconversion between an exo and<br>
endo double bond, for example, interconversion between -CH=C(CH3)COOH and -CH2-<br>
C(=CH2)COOH. It may also include procedures to change the countenon and salt form of<br>
a compound of formula (I). Thus, interconversion from other compounds of formula (I)<br>
(process D) forms yet a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) or<br>
a salt thereof, the process selected from (A), (B), (C) or (D) herein, and optionally<br>
thereafter forming a salt.<br>
Typically, a salt may readily be prepared using a desired acid or base as appropriate. The<br>
salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by<br><br>
evaporation of the solvent. It is to be understood that the free base of a compound of<br>
formula (I) may or may not be isolated prior to salt formation, as desired.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it may be desirable to use protected<br>
derivatives of intermediates used in the preparation of compounds of formula (I). Thus,<br>
the above processes may require deprotection as an intermediate step or final step to<br>
yield the desired compound. Protection and deprotection of functional groups may be<br>
effected using conventional means. Thus, carboxyhc acid groups groups may be<br>
protected using any conventional protecting groups, for example, as described in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Ed. J.F.W. McOmie (Plenum Press, 1973) or<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Theodora W Green (John Wiley and Sons,<br>
1991) or P.J. Kocienski in Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag 1994.<br>
Examples of suitable carboxylic acid protecting groups include groups selected from alkyl<br>
(e.g. methyl, ethyl or t-butyl), aralkyl (e.g. benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl), and<br>
sily! groups such as trialkylsilyl (e.g. t-butyldimethylsily!). The carboxylic acid protecting<br>
groups may be removed by conventional techniques. Thus, for example alkyl and silyl<br>
groups, may be removed by solvolysis, e.g. by hydrolysis under-acidic or basic conditions.<br>
Aralkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl may be similarly be removed by solvolysis, e.g. by<br>
hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Aralkyl groups such as benzyl may be cleaved by<br>
hydrogenolysis in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium-on-charcoal.<br>
Examples of disease states in which a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof may be expected to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and/or anti-<br>
allergic effects include diseases of the respiratory tract such as bronchitis (including<br>
chronic bronchitis), asthma (including allergen-induced asthmatic reactions), chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, sinusitis and allergic rhinitis<br>
(seasonal and perennial). Other disease states include diseases of the gastrointestinal<br>
tract such as intestinal inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (e.g.<br>
Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and intestinal inflammatory diseases secondary to<br>
radiation exposure or allergen exposure.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the invention may be used to treat nephritis, skin diseases<br>
such as psoriasis, eczema, allergic dermatitis and hypersensitivity reactions.<br><br>
Compounds of the invention may also be of use in the treatment of nasal polyposis,<br>
conjunctivitis or pruritis.<br>
Further diseases include inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as<br>
inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
A disease of particular interest is allergic rhinitis.<br>
Compounds that are antagonists of the H3 receptor may also be of use in other diseases<br>
such as non-allergic rhinitis.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that references herein to treatment or<br>
therapy extend to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established conditions.<br>
As mentioned above, compounds of formula (!) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof are useful as therapeutic agents.<br>
There is thus provided, as a further aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in therapy.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of any of the above diseases.<br>
In a further aspect there is provided a method for the treatment of any of the above<br>
diseases, in a human or animal subject in need ihereof, which method comprises<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof.<br>
When used in therapy, the compounds of formula (I) are usually formulated in a suitable<br>
pharmaceutical composition. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared using<br>
standard procedures.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention further provides a composition which comprises a compound<br>
of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof optionally with one or more<br>
pharmaceuticaiiy acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
A composition of the invention, which may be prepared by admixture, suitably at ambient<br>
temperature and atmospheric pressure, may be adapted for oral, parenteral, rectal or<br>
intranasal administration and, as such, may be in the form of tablets, capsules, liquid<br>
preparations e.g. oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable<br>
powders, injectable or infusible solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Suitable<br>
compositions may be prepared according to methods well known in the art for each<br>
particular type of composition.<br>
Compositions suitable for oral administration are of particular interest.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for oral administration may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules or tablets, powders or granules, solutions or suspensions<br>
in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions<br>
or water-in-oil liquid emulsions.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug<br>
component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert<br>
carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders suitable for incorporating<br>
into tablets or capsules may be prepared by reducing the compound to a suitable fine size<br>
(e.g. by micronisation) and mixing with a similarly prepared pharmaceutical carrier such as<br>
an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or manitol. Flavoring, preservative,<br>
dispersing and coloring agent can also be present.<br>
Capsules may be made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling<br>
formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium<br>
stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture<br>
before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar,<br>
calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of<br>
the medicament when the capsule is ingested.<br><br>
Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, glidants, lubricants, sweetening<br>
agents, flavours, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into<br>
the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or<br>
beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or<br>
sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like.<br>
Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.<br>
Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan<br>
gum and the iike. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture,<br>
granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing into tablets. A<br>
powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent<br>
or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
an aliginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a<br>
resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or an absorption agent such as<br>
bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by<br>
wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of<br>
cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to<br>
granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is<br>
imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent<br>
sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt,<br>
talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The<br>
compounds of the present invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier<br>
and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging<br>
steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a<br>
coating of sugar or polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided.<br>
Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages<br>
Oral fluids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that<br>
a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be<br>
prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs<br>
are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be<br>
formulated by dispersing the compound in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and<br>
emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers,<br><br>
preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin or<br>
other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added.<br>
Where appropriate, dosage unit compositions for oral administration can be<br>
microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the<br>
release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax or<br>
the like.<br>
For intranasal administration, suitable compositions may optionally contain one or more<br>
suspending agents, one or more preservatives, one or more wetting agents and/or one or<br>
more isotonicity adjusting agents<br>
Examples of suspending agents include carboxymethylcellulose, veegum, tragacanth,<br>
bentonite, methylcellulose and polyethylene glycols, e.g. microcrystalline cellulose or<br>
carboxy methylcellulose sodium.<br>
For stability purposes, the composition of the present invention may be protected from<br>
microbial contamination and growth by inclusion of a preservative. Examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable anti-microbial agents or preservatives may include<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride,<br>
cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride), mercurial agents (e.g. phenylmercuric nitrate,<br>
phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal), alcoholic agents (e.g. chlorobutanol, phenylethyl<br>
alcohol and benzyl alcohol), antibacterial esters (e.g. esters of para-hydroxybenzoic add),<br>
chelating agents such as disodium edetate (EDTA) and other anti-microbial agents such<br>
as chlorhexidine, chlorocresol, sorbic acid and its salts and polymyxin.<br>
Compositions, e.g. nasal compositions which contain a suspended medicament may<br>
include a pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agent which functions to wet the particles<br>
of medicament to facilitate dispersion thereof in the aqueous phase of the composition.<br>
Typically, the amount of wetting agent used will not cause foaming of the dispersion<br>
during mixing. Examples of wetting agents include fatty alcohols, esters and ethers, such<br>
as polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Polysorbate 80)<br><br>
An isotonicity adjusting agent may be included to achieve isotonicity with body fluids eg<br>
fluids of the nasal cavity, resulting in reduced levels of irntancy. Examples of isotonicity<br>
adjusting agents include sodium chloride, dextrose and calcium chloride.<br>
The intranasal compositions of the present invention may be administered to the nasal<br>
passages by use of a pre-compression pump, such as a VP3, VP7 or modifications,<br>
model manufactured by Valois SA. Pumps of this type are believed to be beneficial as<br>
they may ensure that the composition is not released or atomised until a sufficient force<br>
has been applied, otherwise smaller doses may be applied. Typically, these pre-<br>
compression pumps may be used with a bottle (glass or plastic) capable of holding 8-50<br>
ml of composition and each spray will typically deliver 50-100 Î¼L.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising a compound of<br>
the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a sterile vehicle The<br>
compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or<br>
dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound can be dissolved for<br>
injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.<br>
Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering<br>
agents are dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be<br>
frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral<br>
suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is<br>
suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilisation cannot be<br>
accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide<br>
before suspension in a sterile vehicle A surfactant or wetting agent may be included in<br>
the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
The composition may contain from about 0.1% to 99% by weight, such as from about 10<br>
to 60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. The<br>
dose of the compound used in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders will vary in<br>
the usual way with the seriousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and other<br>
similar factors. However, as a general guide suitable unit doses may be about 0 05 to<br>
1000 mg, more suitably about 1.0 to 200 mg, for example 20 to 100mg, and such unit<br>
doses may be administered more than once a day, for example two or three a day. Such<br>
therapy may extend for a number of weeks or months. In one embodiment compounds<br><br>
and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are suitable for oral<br>
administration and/or are capable of once daily administration, for eaxmple at a dose in<br>
the range of 20 to 200mg (e.g. about 20 to 100mg).<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also be<br>
used in combination with or include one or more other therapeutic agents, for example<br>
other antihistarninic agents for example H4 receptor antagonists, antichoiinergic agents,<br>
anti-in1lammatory agents such as corticosteroids (e.g. fluticasone propionate,<br>
beclomethasone dipropionate, mometasone furoate, triamcinoione acetonide, budesonide<br>
and the steroid disclosed in WO02/12265); or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
(NSAIDs) (e.g. sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium), PDE-4 inhibitors, ieukotriene<br>
antagonists, lipoxygenase inhibitors, chemokine antagonists (e.g. CCR3, CCR1, CCR2,<br>
CCR4, CCR8, CXCR1, CXCR2), IKK antagonists, iNOS inhibitors, tryptase and elastase<br>
inhibitors, beta-2 integrin antagonists and adenosine 2a agonists; or beta adrenergic<br>
agents (e.g. salmeterol, salbutamol, formoterol, fenoterol, terbutaline, and the beta<br>
agonists described in WO 02/66^22, WO 02/270490, WO02/076933, WO03/024439 and<br>
WO03/072539 and salts thereof); or antiinfective agents e.g. antibiotic agents and antiviral<br>
agents. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the other<br>
therapeutic agent(s) may be used in the form of salts, (e.g. as alkali metal or amine salts<br>
or as acid addition salts), or prodrugs, or as esters (e.g lower alkyl esters), or as solvates<br>
(e.g. hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability and/or physical characteristics (e.g.<br>
solubility) of the therapeutic agent. It will be clear also that where appropriate, the<br>
therapeutic agents may be used in optically pure form<br>
The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with one or more (such<br>
as one or two, e.g. one) other therapeutically active agents, optionally with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Other histamine receptor antagonists which may be used alone, or in combination with a<br>
dual H1/H3 receptor antagonist include antagonists (and/or inverse agonists) of the H4<br>
receptor, for example, the compounds disclosed in Jablonowski et al, J Med. Chem.<br>
46:3957-3960 (2003).<br><br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a combination comprising a compound of<br>
formula (I) and a Î²2-adrenoreceptor agonist.<br>

a single enantiomer, such as the R-enantiomer), salbutamol (which may be a racemate or<br>
a single enantiomer such as the R-enantiomer), formoterol (which may be a racemate or a<br>
single diastereomer such as the R,R-diastereomer), salmefamol, fenoterol, carmoterol,<br>

antagonists, inhibitors of leukotnene synthesis (eg. montelukast), iNOS (inducible nitric<br>
oxide synthase) inhibitors (e.g. oral iNOS inhibitors), IKK antagonists, tryptase and<br>
elastase inhibitors, beta-2 integnn antagonists and adenosine receptor agonists or<br>

useful in this aspect of the invention may be any compound that is known to inhibit the<br>
PDE4 enzyme or which is discovered to act as a PDE4 inhibitor, and which are only PDE4<br>

tissue culture plates in alpha minimum essential medium (Gibco /Invitrogen, cat no.<br>
22561-021), supplemented with 10% dialysed foetal calf serum (Gibco/lnvitrogen cat no.<br>
12480-021) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco/lnvitrogen cat no 25030-024) and is maintained<br>
overnight at 5% CO2, 37 Â°C<br>
Excess medium is removed from each well to leave 10 Î¼l. 30 Î¼l loading dye (250 Î¼M<br>
Brilliant Black, 2 Î¼M Fluo-4 diluted in Tyrodes buffer + probenecid (145 mM NaCI, 2.5 mM<br>
KCI, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM D-glucose, 1.2 mM MgCI2r 1.5 mM CaCI2, 2.5 mM<br>
probenecid, pH adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH 1.0 M)) is added to each well and the plates<br>
are incubated for 60 min at 5% CO2.37 Â°C<br>
10 Î¼l of test compound, diluted to the required concentration in Tyrodes buffer +<br>
probenecid (or 10 Î¼l Tyrodes buffer + probenecid as a control) is added to each well and<br>
the plate incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. The plates are then placed into a<br>
FLIPRâ¢ (Molecular Devices, UK) to monitor cell fluorescence (Aex = 488 nm, AEM = 540<br><br>
nm) in the manner described in Sullivan et al., (In: Lambert DG (ed.), Calcium Signaling<br>
Protocols, New Jersey: Humana Press, 1999, 125-136) before and after the addition of 10<br>
(il histamine at a concentration that results in the final assay concentration of histamine<br>
being ECB0.<br>
Functional antagonism is indicated by a suppression of histamine induced increase in<br>
fluorescence, as measured by the FLIPRâ¢ system (Molecuiar Devices). By means of<br>
concentration effect curves, functional affinities are determined using standard<br>
pharmacological mathematical analysis.<br>
Histamine H1 functional antagonist assay: Determination of antagonist pA2<br>
The histamine H1 receptor expressing CHO cells is seeded into non-coated black-walled<br>
clear bottom 96-well tissue culture plates as described above.<br>
Following overnight culture, growth medium is removed from each well, washed with 200<br>
Î¼l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and replaced with 50 Î¼l loading dye (250 Î¼M Brilliant<br>
Black, 1 Î¼MFIuo-4 diluted in Tyrodes buffer + probenecid (145 mM NaCI, 2.5 mM KCI,<br>
10mM HEPES, 10mM D-glucose, 1.2 mM MgCI2, 1.5 mM CaCI2, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH<br>
adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH 1.0 M)). Cells are incubated for 45 min. at 37 Â°C The<br>
loading buffer is removed and the cells washed as above, and 90 Î¼l of Tyrodes buffer +<br>
probenecid is added to each well. 10 Î¼l of test compound, diluted to the required<br>
concentration in Tyrodes buffer + probenecid (or 10 ÎL Tyrodes buffer + probenecid as a<br>
control) is added to each well and the plate incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2.<br>
The plates are then placed into a FLIPRâ¢ (Molecular Devices, UK) to monitor cell<br>
fluorescence (Î»ex = 488 nm, ÎEM = 540 nm) in the manner described in Sullivan et al., (In:<br>
Lambert DG (ed.), Calcium Signaling Protocols, New Jersey: Humana Press, 1999, 125-<br>
136) before and after the addition of 50 Î¼l histamine over a concentration range of 1 mM -<br>
0.1 nM. The resultant concentration response curves are analysed by non-linear<br>
regression using a standard four parameter logistic equation to determine the histamine<br>
EC50, the concentration of histamine required to produce a response of 50% of the<br>
maximum response to histamine. The antagonist pA2 is calculated using the following<br><br>
standard equation: pA2 = log(DR-1)-log[B] where DR = dose ratio, defined as<br>
EC50antagonist-treated/EC50control and [B] = concentration of antagonist.<br>
2. H3 receptor cell line generation, membrane preparation and functional GTPÎ³S<br>
assay protocols<br>
Generation of histamine H3 cell line<br>
The histamine H3 cDNA is isolated from its holding vector, pCDNA3,1 TOPO (inVitrogen),<br>
by restriction digestion of plasmid DNA with the enzymes BamH1 and Not-1 and ligated<br>
into the inducibie expression vector pGene (InVitrogen) digested with the same enzymes.<br>
The GeneSwitchâ¢ system (a system wherein transgene expression is switched off in the<br>
absence of an inducer and switched on in the presence of an inducer) is performed as<br>
described in US Patents: 5,364,791; 5,874,534; and 5,935,934. Ligated DNA is<br>
transformed into competent DH5Î± E. coll host bacterial cells and plated onto Luria Broth<br>
(LB) agar containing Zeocinâ¢ (an antibiotic which allows the selection of cells expressing<br>
the sh ble gene which is present on pGene and pSwitch) at 5Q Î¼gml-1. Colonies<br>
containing the re-ligated plasmid are identified by restriction analysis. DNA for<br>
transfection into mammalian cells is prepared from 250 ml cultures of the host bacterium<br>
containing the pGeneH3 plasmid and isolated using a DNA preparation kit (Qiagen Midi-<br>
Prep) as per manufacturers guidelines (Qiagen).<br>
CHO K1 cells previously transfected with the pSwitch regulatory plasmid (InVitrogen) are<br>
seeded at 2x106 cells per T75 flask in Complete Medium, containing Hams F12<br>
(GIBCOBRL, Life Technologies) medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialysed foetal<br>
bovine serum, L-glutamine, and hygromycin (100 Î¼gmr1), 24 h prior to use. Plasmid DNA<br>
is transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine plus according to the manufacturers<br>
guidelines (InVitrogen). 48 h post transfection cells are placed into complete medium<br>
supplemented with 500 Î¼gml-1 Zeocinâ¢.<br>
10-14 days post selection, 10 nM Mifepristone (InVitrogen) is added to the culture medium<br>
to induce the expression of the receptor. 18 h post induction, cells are detached from the<br>
flask using ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA; 1:5000; InVitrogen), following several<br><br>
washes with phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 and are then resuspended in Sorting<br>
Medium containing Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), without phenol red, and<br>
supplemented with Earles salts and 3% Foetal Clone II (Hyclone) Approximately 1x107<br>
cells are examined for receptor expression by staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody,<br>
4a, raised against the N-terminal domain of the histamine H3 receptor, incubated on ice<br>
for 60 min, followed by two washes in sorting medium. Receptor bound antibody is<br>
detected by incubation of the cells for 60 min on ice with a goat anti rabbit antibody,<br>
conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorescence marker (Molecular Probes). Following two further<br>
washes with Sorting Medium, cells are filtered through a 50 Î¼m Filconâ¢ (BD Biosciences)<br>
and are then analysed on a FACS Vantage SE Flow Cytometer fitted with an Automatic<br>
Cell Deposition Unit. Control cells are non-induced ceils treated in a similar manner.<br>
Positively stained cells are sorted as single cells into 96-well plates, containing Complete<br>
Medium containing 500 Î¼gml-1 Zeocinâ¢ and allowed to expand before reanalysis for<br>
receptor expression via antibody and ligand binding studies. Clone, 3H3, is selected for<br>
membrane preparation.<br>
Membrane preparation from cultured cells<br>
All steps of the protocol are carried out at 4 Â°C and with pre-cooled reagents The cell<br>
pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of homogenisation buffer (50 mM N-2-<br>
hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1 mM ethylenediamine tetra-<br>
acetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.4 with KOH, supplemented with 10-6 M leupeptin (acetyl-leucyl-<br>
leucyl-arginal; Sigma L2884), 25 ngml-1 bacitracin (Sigma B0125), 1 mM<br>
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 2x10-6 M pepstain A (Sigma)) The cells are<br>
then homogenised by 2 x 15 second bursts in a 1 litre glass Waring blender, followed by<br>
centrifugation at 500 g for 20 min. The supernatant is then spun at 48,000 g for 30 min.<br>
The pellet is resuspended in homogenisation buffer (4x the volume of the original cell<br>
pellet) by vortexing for 5 seconds, followed by homogenisation in a Dounce homogeniser<br>
(10-15 strokes). At this point the preparation is aliquoted into polypropylene tubes and<br>
stored at -80 Â°C.<br>
Histamine H3 functional antagonist assay<br>
For each compound being assayed, in a solid white 384 well plate, is added -<br><br>
(a)	0.5 Î¼l of test compound diluted to the required concentration in DMSO (or 0.5 Î¼l<br>
DMSO as a control);<br>
(b)	30 Î¼l bead/membrane/GDP mix which is prepared by mixing Wheat Germ<br>
Agglutinin Polystyrene LeadSeekerÂ® (WGA PS LS) scintillation proximity assay (SPA)<br>
beads with membrane (prepared in accordance with the methodology described above)<br>
and diluting in assay buffer (20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid<br>
(HEPES) + 100 mM NaCl + 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4 NaOH) to give a final volume of 30Î¼l<br>
which contains 5Î¼g protein, 0.25mg bead per well and 10Î¼M final assay concentration of<br>
guanosine 5' diphosphate (GDP) (Sigma, diluted in assay buffer) incubating at room<br>
temperature for 60 min on a roller,<br>
(c)	15 Î¼l 0.38 nM [35S]-GTPyS (Amersham; Radioactivity concentration = 37 MBqml-1;<br>
Specific activity = 1160 Cimmol-1), histamine (at a concentration that results in the final<br>
assay concentration of histamine being EC80).<br>
After 2-6 h, the plate is centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm and counted on a Viewlux<br>
counter using a 613/55 filter for 5 minplate-1. Data is analysed using a 4-parameter<br>
logistical equation. Basa! activity used as minimum, i.e. histamine not added to well.<br>
In vivo anti-inflammatory wheal and flare model<br>
Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs 500g -1kg are dosed with test compound or vehicle<br>
using a 1ml syringe into the oral cavity (0.5ml/kg p.o.), or via a marginal ear vein<br>
(0.33ml/kg i.v.). Compounds are formulated in 5% DMSO/45%PEG200/50% water.<br>
Either 2hr after oral or 15 min after intravenous compound administration, guinea pigs are<br>
anaesthetised with isoflurane (5%, 2-3l/min O2), and receive Evans blue solution (2% in<br>
saline), 0 33ml/kg i.v via a marginal ear vein.<br>
Immediately after Evans blue administration, and whilst still under isoflurane, animals are<br>
placed in a prone position, and an area of the back shaved Histamine (10ug/100ul x 4)<br>
and vehicle (1 x100Î¼l PBS) is injected intradermally into the shaved dorsal surface.<br>
Following histamine challenge, the animals are allowed to recover from anaesthesia and,<br>
30 minutes later are euthanased with an i.p. overdose of pentobarbitone. The dorsal skin<br><br>
is carefully removed and wheal areas (stained blue) measured from the inner skin surface<br>
by taking two perpendicular diameters using engineer's calipers, and calculating the<br>
average radius. This value is used to calculate the area of each wheal, and the mean<br>
value of all histamine-induced wheals is subsequently calculated for each animal. If<br>
Evans blue is seen in the vehicle-challenge wheal, then that animal is excluded from the<br>
data set.<br>
Dose-response curves are constructed for each test compound and ID50 values may be<br>
determined for each route of administration (oral and intravenous).<br>
CNS penetration<br>
(i) CNS penetration by bolus administration<br>
Compounds are dosed intravenously at a nominal dose level of 1mg/kg to male CD<br>
Sprague Dawley rats. Compounds are formulated in 5% DMSO/45% PEG200750% water.<br>
Blood samples are taken under terminal anaesthesia with isoflurane at 5 minutes post-<br>
dose and the brains are also removed for assessment of brain penetration. Blood<br>
samples are taken directly into heparinised tubes. Blood samples are prepared for<br>
analysis using protein precipitation and brain samples are prepared using extraction of<br>
drug from brain by homogenisation and subsequent protein precipitation. The<br>
concentration of parent drug in blood and brain extracts is determined by quantitative LC-<br>
MS/MS analysis using compound-specific mass transitions.<br>
(ii) CNS penetration following intravenous infusion at steady state<br>
A loading dose of the compounds is given to male CD Sprague Dawley rats at a nominal<br>
dose level of 0.4mg/kg. The compounds are then infused intravenously for four hours at a<br>
nominal dose level of 0.1mg/kg/h. Compounds are formulated in 2% DMSO/30%<br>
PEG200/68% water. Serial or terminal blood samples are taken at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5<br>
and 4 hours post dose. The final blood sample is collected under terminal anaesthesia<br>
with isoflurane and the brains are also removed for assessment of brain penetration.<br>
Blood samples are taken directly into heparinised tubes. Blood samples are prepared for<br>
analysis using protein precipitation and brain samples are prepared using extraction of<br>
drug from brain by homogenisation and subsequent protein precipitation. The<br>
concentration of parent drug in blood and brain extracts is determined by quantitative LC-<br>
MS/MS analysis using compound-specific mass transitions.<br><br>
Rat pharmacokinetics<br>
Compounds are dosed to male CD Sprague Dawley rats by single intravenous or oraf<br>
administration at a nominal dose level of 1mg/kg and 3mg/kg respectively. Compounds<br>
are formulated in 5% DMSO/45% PEG200750% water. An intravenous profile is obtained<br>
by taking serial or terminal blood samples at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 7 hours post<br>
dose (for some studies 12 and 24 hour sampies may be taken). An orai profile is obtained<br>
by taking serial or terminal blood samples at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 12 hours post dose<br>
(for some studies 24 and 30 hour samples may be taken). Blood samples are taken<br>
directly into heparinised tubes. Blood samples are prepared by protein precipitation and<br>
subjected to quantitative analysis by LC-MS/MS using compound-specific mass<br>
transitions. Drug concentration-time profiles are generated and non-compartmental PK<br>
analysis used to generate estimates of half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and oral<br>
bioavailability.<br>
Dog pharmacokinetics<br>
Compounds are dosed to male Beagle dogs by single intravenous or oral administration at<br>
a nominal dose level of 1mg/kg and 2mg/kg respectively. The study is carried out<br>
according to a crossover design such that the same dog is used for both dosing events<br>
and the dosing events occurred 1 week apart. Compounds are formulated in<br>
5%DMSO/45%Peg200/50%water. An intravenous profile is obtained by taking serial<br>
blood samples at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1, 2, 4, 6 and 12hr post dose (for some studies 24<br>
hour samples may be taken). An oral profile is obtained by taking serial blood samples at<br>
0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24hr post dose. Blood samples are taken directly into<br>
heparinised tubes. Blood samples are prepared by protein precipitation and subjected to<br>
quantitative analysis by LC-MS/MS using compound-specific mass transitions Drug<br>
concentration-time profiles are generated and non-compartmental PK analysis used to<br>
generate estimates of half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and oral bioavailability.<br>
