Pigment composition containing ATRP polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a composition containing ATRP polymers and dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles, a process for preparing the composition, a pigment dispersion containing ATRP polymers and dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles, a process for preparing the pigment dispersion and to the use of the pigment dispersion for preparing coatings, images, lacquers and others.<br>
The present invention specifically relates to a pigment composition containing ATRP (Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization) polymers characterized by a low polydispersity range, preferably a polydispersity range which is lower than 3, and an enhanced monomer to polymer conversion efficiency and predetermined molecular weights and to a pigment dispersion prepared from the pigment composition.<br>
Dispersions containing pigments and polymer additives are used in an almost unlimited number of different technical applications, e.g. as coating materials, printing inks, for coloring plastic materials, including fibers, glasses, or ceramic products, for formulations in cosmetics, or for the preparation of paint systems, in particular automotive paints and dispersion colors.<br>
The function of polymers in pigment dispersions is manifold. They may act as solubilisers in the given dispersing agent, e.g. water or organic solvents. Suitable polymers are also needed as stabilizers to prevent precipitation or flocculation. Polymers may also improve the gloss of the pigment dispersion or enhance its rheology. Depending on the type and polarity of the dispersing agent, e.g. water, organic solvents or mixtures thereof, polymers of variable structure are chosen. In view of ecological requirements, the use of aqueous pigment dispersions is particularly preferred.<br>
Group transfer polymerization (GTP) is a method for producing acrylic A-B block copolymers of defined structure. With a hydrophilic "B" block (neutralized acid or amine containing polymers), these polymers are useful for preparing water based pigment dispersions. The hydrophobic "A" blocks (homo- or copolymers of methacrylate monomers) are surface active and associate with either pigment or emulsion polymer surfaces, cf. H. J. Spinelli, Progress in Organic Coatings 27 (1996), 255-260.<br>
The GTP method still has several drawbacks. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic "balance" is obtained by copolymerizing a limited group of specific acryiate and methacrylate monomers. Moreover, the polymerization initiators used in this method, such as the silyl ketene acetals disclosed in U.S. 4,656,226, e.g. 1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-isobutoxy-2-methylpropene, are highly<br><br>
reactive and this necessitates the use of carefully dried and purified reactants, which limits the use of this method in industrial applications.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to employ an improved method of polymerization for preparing polymers of defined structure for use in pigment dispersions.<br>
U.S. 4,581,429 discloses a free radical polymerization process by controlled or "living" growth of polymer chains which produces defined oligomeric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. A process embodiment is the use of initiators of the partial formula R'FTN-O-X. In the polymerization process the free radical species R'R"N-0* and »X are generated. »X is a free radical group, e.g. a tert.-butyl or cyanoisopro-pyl radical, capable of polymerizing monomer units containing ethylene groups. The monomer units A are substituted by the initiator fragments R'R"N-0 and «X and polymerize to structures of the type: R'R"N-0-A-X (A: polymer block). Specific R'R"N-0-X initiators mentioned are derived from cyclic structures, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, or open chain molecules, such as di-tert.-butylamine.<br>
WO 96/30421 discloses a controlled or "living" polymerization process of ethylenically unsaturated polymers such as styrene or (meth)acrylates by employing the ATRP method. According to this method initiators are employed which generate a radical atom such as «CI, in the presence of a redox system of transition metals of different oxidation states, e.g. Cu(l) and Cu(ll), providing "living" or controlled radical polymerization.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that polymers obtained by controlled or "living" polymerization process of ethylenically unsaturated polymers, such as styrene or (meth)acrylates, by employing the ATRP method or related methods are particularly useful for preparing pigment compositions or pigment dispersions prepared from these compositions.<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising<br>
a) 0.1 - 99.9 % by weight of a block copolymer of the formula:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
In represents a polymerization initiator fragment of a polymerization initiator capable of initiating atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of a catalyst capable of activating controlled radical polymerization;<br>
p represents a numeral greater than zero and defines the number of initiator fragments;<br><br>
A and B represent polymer blocks which differ in polarity and consist of repeating units of ethylenically unsaturated monomers;<br>
x and y represent numerals greater than zero and define the number of monomer repeating units in polymer blocks A and B;<br>
X represents a polymer chain terminal group; and<br>
q represents a numeral greater than zero; and<br>
b) 0.1 - 99.9 % by weight of dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pigment dispersion comprising a dispersed phase consisting of<br>
a)	a block copolymer of the formula I, wherein In, A, B, X, x, y, p and q are as defined above; and<br>
b)	dispersed pigment particles;<br>
and a liquid carrier selected from the group consisting of water, organic solvents and mixtures thereof.<br>
The pigment dispersions are useful for variety of uses, e.g. the preparation of inks or printing inks in printing processes, such as flexographic, screen, packaging, security ink, intaglio or offset printing, for pre-press stages and for textile printing, for office, home or graphic appli -cations, for paper goods, for pens, felt tips, fiber tips, card, wood, (wood) stains, metal, inking pads, or inks for impact printing, (with impact-pressure ink ribbons), or for the preparation of colorants, for coatings, e.g. paints, for textile decoration and industrial marking, for roller coatings or powder coatings or powder coatings or for automotive finishes for high-solids, low-solvent, water containing or metallic coating materials or for water-containing formulations, water-containing paints, or for the preparation of pigment plastics for coatings, fibers, platters or mold carriers, or for non-impact printing material, for digital printing, for thermal wax transfer printing, for Inkjet printing or for thermal transfer printing, or for the preparation of color filters, especially for visible light in the range from 400 to 700 nm, which can be used for the production of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or charge combined devices (CCDs) or for the preparation of cosmetics, toners, or polymeric ink particles for the preparation of toners for dry copy toners and liquid copy toners, or electrophotographic toners.

The polymerization process may be carried out in the presence of water or an organic solvent or mixtures thereof. Additional cosolvents or surfactants, such as glycols or ammonium salts of fatty acids, may be added to the reaction mixture. The amount of solvent should be kept as low as possible. The reaction mixture may contain the above-mentioned monomers or oligomers in an amount of 1.0 to 99.9% by weight, preferably 5.0 to 99.9% by weight, and especially preferably 50.0 to 99.9% by weight, based on the monomers present in the po-lymerizate.<br>
If organic solvents are used, suitable solvents or mixtures of solvents are typically pure al-kanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene),<br><br>
halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate, propyl, butyl or hexyl acetate) and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane), or mixtures thereof.<br>
If water is used as a solvent the reaction mixture can be supplemented with a water-miscible or hydrophilic cosolvent. The reaction mixture will then remain in a homogeneous single phase throughout the monomer conversion. Any water-soluble or water-miscible cosolvent may be used, as long as the aqueous solvent medium is effective in providing a solvent system which prevents precipitation or phase separation of the reactants or polymer products until full completion of the polymerization. Exemplary cosolvents useful in the process may be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyrrolidines, N-alkylpyrrolidinones, N-alkylpyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, carboxylic acids and salts thereof, esters, organosulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or cel-losolve, amino alcohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives and mixtures thereof.

When monomer mixtures or monomer/oligomer mixtures are used, the calculation of mol% is based on an average molecular weight of the mixture.<br>
Hydrophilic monomers, polymers and copolymers of the present invention can be separated from one another or from the polymerization reaction mixture by, for example, distillation, precipitation, extraction, changing the pH of the reaction media or by other well known conventional separation techniques.<br>
The polymerization temperature may range from about 50°C to about 180°C, preferably from about 80°C to about 150°C. At temperatures above about 180°C, the controlled conversion of the monomers into polymers may decrease, and undesirable by-products like thermally initiated polymers are formed or decomposition of the components may occur.<br>
A suitable catalyst capable of activating controlled radical polymerization is a transition metal complex catalyst salt is present as an oxidizable complex ion in the lower oxidation state of a redox system. Preferred examples of such redox systems are selected from the group consisting of Group V(B), VI(B), VII(B), VIII, IB and IIB elements, such as Cu7Cu2+, Cu°/Cu+,<br><br>

The ionic charges are counterbalanced by anionic ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals, such hydride ions (FT) or anions derived from inorganic or organic acids, examples being halides, e.g. F, CI", Br"* or I", halogen complexes with transition metals, such as Cu'Bra", halogen complexes of the type BF4", PF6", SbF6" or AsF6", anions of oxygen acids, alcoholates or acetylides or anions of cyclopentadiene.<br>
Anions of oxygen acids are, for example, sulfate, phosphate, perchlorate, perbromate, peri-odate, antimonate, arsenate, nitrate, carbonate, the anion of a CrC8carboxylic acid, such as formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, benzoate, phenylacetate, mono-, di- or trichloro- or -fluoroacetate, sulfonates, for example methylsulfonate, ethylsulfonate, propylsulfonate, bu-tylsulfonate, trifluoromethylsulfonate (triflate), unsubstituted or C1-C4alkyi-, C1-C4alkoxy- or halo-, especially fluoro-, chloro- or bromo-substituted phenylsulfonate or benzylsulfonate, for example tosylate, mesylate, brosylate, p-methoxy- or p-ethoxyphenylsulfonate, pentafluoro-phenylsulfonate or 2,4,6-triisopropylsulfonate, phosphonates, for example methylphos-phonate, ethylphosphonate, propylphosphonate, butylphosphonate, phenylphosphonate, p-methylphenylphosphonate or benzylphosphonate, carboxylates derived from a CrC8carboxylic acid, for example formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, benzoate, phenylacetate, mono-, di- or trichloro- or -fluoroacetate, and also CrC^-alcoholates, such as straight chain or branched CrC12-alcoholates, e.g. methanolate or ethanolate.<br>
Anionic ligands and neutral may also be present up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation, especially four, five or six. Additional negative charges are counterbalanced by cations, especially monovalent cations such as Na+, K+, NH4+ or (d-C4alkyl)4N+.<br>
Suitable neutral ligands are inorganic or organic neutral ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals. They coordinate to the metal ion through a o-, %-, \x-, retype bonding or any combinations thereof up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation. Suitable inorganic ligands are selected from the group consisting of aquo (H20), amino, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrosyl. Suitable organic ligands are selected from the group consisting of phosphines, e.g. (C6H5)3P. (i-C3H7)3P, (C5Hg)3P or (CeHnfeP, di-, tri-, tetra- and hydroxyamines, such as ethylenediamine, ethylenediaminotetraacetate (EDTA), N,N-Dimethyl-N,,N,-bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-ethylenediamine (Me6TREN), catechol, N,N'-dimethyl-1,2-benzenediamine, 2-(methylamino)phenol, 3-(methylamino)-2-butanol or N,N'-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,N',N",Nn-pentamethyldiethyltriamine (PMDETA), C1-C8-glycols or glycerides, e.g. ethylene or propylene glycol or derivatives<br><br>
thereof, e.g. di-, tri- or tetraglyme, and monodentate or bidentate heterocyclic e~ donor li-gands.<br>
Heterocyclic e~ donor ligands are derived, for example, from unsubstituted or substituted heteroarenes from the group consisting of furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, bis-pyridine, picolylimine, y-pyran, y-thiopyran, phenanthroline, pyrimidine, bis-pyrimidine, pyrazine, indole, coumarone, thionaphthene, carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, pyrazole, imidazole, benzimidazole, oxazole, thiazole, bis-thiazole, isoxazole, isothiazole, quinoline, bis-quinoline, isoquinoline, bis-isoquinoline, acridine, chromene, phenazine, phenoxazine, phe-nothiazine, triazine, thianthrene, purine, bis-imidazole and bis-oxazole.<br>
The oxidizable transition metal complex catalyst can be formed in a separate preliminary reaction step from its ligands or is preferably formed in-situ from its transition metal salt, e.g. Cu(l)CI, which is then converted to the complex compound by addition of compounds corresponding to the ligands present in the complex catalyst, e.g. by addition of ethylenediamine, EDTA, Me6TREN or PMDETA.<br>
After completing the polymerizing step process, the polymers obtained may be isolated or the N -» O compound of the formula:<br><br>
which corresponds to the group A0 and wherein RT - R4 and Ra and Rb are as defined above, is added in-situ. The isolating step of the present process may be carried out by known procedures, e.g. by distilling and filtering off unreacted monomer. After completing the substitution of the polymerisate with the N-&gt;0 compound (III), the catalyst salt is filtered off, followed by evaporation of the solvent or by precipitation of the N-&gt;0 polymer (I) in a suitable liquid phase, filtering the precipitated polymer and washing and drying.<br>
The elimination of the leaving group -X, e.g. halogen, and the substitution of the polymerisate with the N -&gt; O compound (III) is advantageously performed in such a way that the polymerisate is dissolved in a solvent and the N-»0 compound (III) is added. The reaction takes place within a temperature range from room temperature to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably from room temperature to 100°C. The transition metal in the oxidizable transition metal complex catalyst salt is converted from its lower oxidation state in the above-mentioned redox systems to its higher oxidation state. In a preferred embodiment<br><br>
of the process a Cu(l) complex catalyst salt is converted to the corresponding Cu(ll) oxidation state.<br>
Because the present polymerization and derivatization with the N-^O compound (III) by ATRP is a "living" polymerization, it can be started and terminated practically at will. The block copolymers (I) as obtained by the process have a low polydispersity. Preferably the polydispersity is from 1.01 to 2.2, more preferably from 1.01 to 1.9, and most preferably from 1.01 to 1.5.<br>
The various advantages of the process of this type allowing flexible polymerization reactions are described by K. Matyjaszewski in ACS Symp. Ser. Vol. 685 (1998), pg. 2-30.<br>
The polymers or copolymers can be further processed and used in most cases without any further purification step. This is an important advantage when industrial scale-up is intended. In specific cases it can be advantageous to modify the resultant block copolymer by additional reaction step(s) for example by (complete or partial) neutralization of incorporated aminofunctional monomers with organic or inorganic acids or by quaternization the same with strong alkylation agents.<br>
The pigments are added to the polymer dispersant by using conventional techniques, such as high speed mixing, ball milling, sand grinding, attritor grinding or two or three roll milling. The resulting pigment dispersion may have a pigment to dispersant binder weight ratio of about 0.1 :100 to 1500: 100.<br>
The invention also relates to the process for preparing the pigment dispersion, which comprises dispersing in a liquid carrier pigment particles in the presence of a block copolymer of the formula I, wherein I, A, B, X, x, y, p and q are as defined above.<br>
The organic solvents present in the dispersion are mentioned above, cf. process, and preferably are polar, water-miscible solvents such as C1-C4 alkohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, polyols, e.g. glycerol, or ethylene, diethylene, triethylene, triethylene or propylene glycol.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this process, fine pigment dispersions are prepared by mixing the pigments with a solution of the polymers, concentrating the resulting mixture by distilling off the solvents, preferably to dryness, and subjecting the resulting concentrate to thermal treatment to prepare a mixture comprising pigments and polymers which may then be subsequently dispersed in aqueous and/or organic solvents.<br><br>
The above-mentioned methods for preparing the composition, such as high speed mixing, ball milling, sand grinding, attritor grinding or two or three roll milling may in the alternative be employed when preparing the dispersion.<br>
Likewise of particular interest is a specific embodiment of the above-mentioned process for preparing the composition, wherein coating compositions, for example paints, are prepared. The invention therefore also relates to compositions, wherein film-forming binders c) for coatings are added.<br>
The novel coating composition preferably comprises 0.01-10 parts by weight of the combined components a) and b) in the composition, in particular 0.05 -10 parts, especially 0.1 -5 parts, per 100 parts by weight of solid binder c).<br>
The binder c) can in principle be any binder which is customary in industry, for example those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991, Germany. In general, the film-forming binder is based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, predominantly on a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof. Also resins curable by radiation or air drying resins can be used.<br>
Component c) can be any cold-curable or hot-curable binder; the addition of a curing catalyst may be advantageous. Suitable catalysts which accelerate curing of the binder are described, for example, in Ullmann's, Vol.A18, p.469.<br>
Preference is given to coating compositions in which component c) is a binder comprising a functional acrylate resin and a crosslinking agent. Examples of coating compositions containing specific binders are:<br>
1)	paints based on cold- or hot-crosslinkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, if desired with addition of a curing catalyst;<br>

14)	paint systems based on siloxane-modified or fluorine-modified acrylate resins.<br>
In addition to the components mentioned above, the coating composition according to the invention preferably comprises a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type, the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and/or the 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole type. Further examples for light stabilizers of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine type advantageously to be added can be found e.g. in the published patent literature, e.g. US-A-4619956, EP-A-434608, US-A-5198498, US-A-5322868, US-A-5369140, US-A-5298067, WO-94/18278, EP-A-7Q4437, GB-A-2297091, WO-96/28431. Of special technical interest is the addition of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazines and/or 2-hydroxyphenyi-2H-benzotriazoles, especially the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazines.<br>
Apart from the components mentioned above, the coating composition can also comprise further components, examples being solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, stabilizers, thixotropic agents, drying catalysts and/or leveling agents. Examples of possible components are those described in Ullmann's, Vol. A18t pp. 429-471.<br><br>
Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example, organometallic compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples of organometallic compounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn, Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of the metals Al, Ti or Zr, or organometallic compounds such as organotin compounds.<br>
Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octanoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenoates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoleates, resinates or tallates.<br>
Examples of metal chelates are the aluminum, titanium or zirconium chelates of acetylace-tone, ethyl acetylacetate, salicylaldehyde, salicylaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenone or ethyl trifluoroacetylacetate, and the alkoxides of these metals.<br>
Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin dioctoate.<br>
Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and salts thereof. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example trimethylbenzylammonium chloride.<br>
Amino-containing resins are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrylate copolymers.<br>
The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine.<br>
The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case, the binder essentially comprises monomeric or oligomeric compounds containing eth-ylenically unsaturated bonds, which after application are cured by actinic radiation, i.e. converted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form. Where the system is UV-curing, it generally contains a photoinitiator as well. Corresponding-systems are described in the above-mentioned publication Ullmann's, Vol.A18, pages 451-453. In radiation-curable coating compositions, the novel stabilizers can also be employed without the addition of sterically hindered amines.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention can be applied to any desired substrates, for example to metal, wood, plastic or ceramic materials. They are preferably used as topcoat in the finishing of automobiles. If the topcoat comprises two layers, of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper layer.<br><br>
The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by the customary methods, for example by brushing, spraying, pouring, dipping or electrophoresis; see also Ullmann's, Vol A18, pp. 491-500.<br>
Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be cured at room temperature or by heating. The coatings are preferably cured at 50 - 150°C, and in the case of powder coatings or coil coatings even at higher temperatures.<br>
The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention have excellent resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering resistance of the coatings thus obtained, for example paints.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a coating, in particular a paint, which has been stabilized against the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat by a content of the compound of the formula (I) according to the invention. The paint is preferably a topcoat for automobiles. The invention furthermore relates to a process for stabilizing a coating based on organic polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the coating composition a mixture comprising a compound of the formula (I), and to the use of mixtures comprising a compound of the formula (I) in coating compositions as stabilizers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat.<br>
The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can otherwise be an aqueous solution or dispersion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic solvent and water. The coating composition may be a high-solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a powder coating material). Powder coatings are, for example, those described in Ullmann's, A18, pages 438-444. The powder coating material may also have the form of a powder-slurry (dispersion of the powder preferably in water).<br>
Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for applications in the automobile industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat of the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible.<br>
The above-mentioned coating compositions or disperse systems may additionally contain fillers, such as calcium carbonate, silicates, glass fibers, glass beads, talc, kaolin, mica, barium sulfate, metal oxides and hydroxides, carbon black, graphite, wood powders, powders and fibers of other natural products, synthetic fibers, plasticisers, lubricants, emulsifiers, pigments, rheology additives, catalysts, flow auxiliaries, optical brighteners, flame retardants, antistatics, blowing agents.<br><br>

2.   Experimental<br>
The performance of the different block copolymers is evaluated in a "concentrated" polyester millbase and corresponding coating formulations made therefrom. A polyester millbase formulation is used to test the rheological behavior at relatively high pigment loadings. The millbase-formulation is used to grind and disperse the pigments. After defined grinding (2 h, Scandex-Mixer) the viscosity of the dispersion is measured at different shear rates with a cone plate viscosimeter. Reduction of the viscosities is indicative for dispersant efficiency, especially at low shear rates. The reference formulation contains no dispersant, but the same weight ratio of pigment versus polymer (= binder + dispersant) is maintained in each case. A letdown formulation (= final lacquer) is prepared from the millbase concentrate and applied to a transparent plastic film substrate or a glass plate and cured at high temperature. Gloss measurements were done on the cured coatings to characterize the dispersion quality of the pigment in the finished coating. Improved gloss is indicative for good dispersion of the pigment. In each case the reference formulation contains the same ratio of pigment versus polymer (= polyester + CAB + Melamine-crosslinker + dispersant). The following block copolymers were used:<br><br><br><br>
methyl-2-bromopropionatet BzCI = benzyl chloride, pTSA = p-toluene sulfonic acid, TOA = tris(ethylhexyl)-amine; 2) molecular weights measured by GPC.<br>
3.   Results<br>
As can be seen from the results with different organic pigments in Tables 1, 3 and 5, the millbase formulations containing block copolymers show improved rheology as compared to the reference without dispersant. In the final lacquer formulations, the block copolymers also show improvements in gloss, cf. Tables 2, 4 and 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3.7 Table 7<br>
In another set of experiments, the performance of different new block copolymer dispersants made by ATRP is compared with state of the art commercial dispersants. The same polyester formulation (DYNAPOL H700-08) as "Millbase 2" in Table 3 is used, except that the dispersion time is extended to 4 h. In all cases the same weight ratio of dispersant active polymer versus pigment of 20/100 is maintained. Letdown formulations are containing the pigment IRGAZIN DPP Rubine TR prepared according to lacquer 2 in Table 4 to compare the gloss of the cured coating. The results from Table 7 show that the new block copolymer dispersants improve the rheology in the millbase and/or the gloss of the cured lacquer.<br><br><br>
