				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING<br>
A CONTINUOUS METAL REMOVAL IN<br>
CONJUNCTION WITH A ZINC<br>
PREPARATION PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method as defined in the preamble of claim 1<br>
and an apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 13 for controlling removal<br>
of metal, such as e.g. cobalt, lickel, copper, germanium and cadmium, in<br>
conjunction with zinc preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a hydrometallurgic zinc preparation process zinc-bearing ore is<br>
concentrated, roasted and dissolved in sulphuric acid. Besides zinc, also copper,<br>
cobalt, nickel and cadmium as wel as germanium and antimony are released in<br>
the dissolution. These metals or semi-metals, i.e. impurities, are removed from<br>
the solution by reduction using zinc powder in a solution purification process.<br>
The separation of these metals can be performed by precipitating in one or more<br>
phases from a zinc-bearing solutior in precipitation reactors or the like. After the<br>
aforementioned metals have been removed, the zinc is electrolytically reduced<br>
from a zinc sulphate solution. In zinc preparation, the impurities must be -<br>
removed from a zinc-bearing material to achieve a successful and efficient<br>
electrolysis to reduce zinc. Particularly Ge and Sb and the metal ions Co2+ and<br>
Ni2+ of the iron group promote the re-dissolving of zinc that stratifies in the<br>
electrolysis, resulting in a decrease of the efficiency of electric current.<br>
To improve the separation efficiency of the desired metal and to<br>
accelerate the separation in the solution purification process, metallic zinc<br>
powder is introduced into the solution, and besides at least one activator. The<br>
activator activates the separation of an impurity metal. In addition, the<br>
precipitated end product or a property thereof in the precipitation solution can<br><br>
often be used to affect the separation or precipitation rate of metal. The surfaces<br>
of the particles of an activator or of a precipitated metal compound have to be<br>
purified in order for them to activate the precipitation reaction.<br>
Known in prior art are a number of various ways to optimise metal<br>
removal. It is known in prior art to measure the redox potential and the pH values<br>
of a metal removal mixture inside a precipitation reactor. By means of the<br>
measurement results, variables of the process, such as the consumption of zinc,<br>
have been adjusted. However, there is a problem that the measurement<br>
electrodes of the redox potential and pH immersed in the reaction mixture get<br>
dirty, resulting in an increase in the measurement result errors.<br>
Furthermore, a problem with the continuous metal removal processes has<br>
been the adjustment of the zinc powder to be introduced. The adjustment has<br>
been difficult, and zinc powder has been introduced in an excess with respect to<br>
the reaction.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention is to eliminate the drawbacks referred to<br>
above! One specific objective of the invention is to disclose a novel control<br>
method and apparatus for enhancing and optimising metal removal in<br>
conjunction with zinc preparation. Furthermore, the objective of the invention is<br>
to optimise the consumption of zinc powder and to achieve a more purified zinc-<br>
bearing solution that is improved in terms of quality in a continuous metal<br>
removal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method and apparatus in accordance with the invention are<br>
characterised by what has been presented in the claims.<br><br>
The invention is based on a method for con-<br>
trolling a continuous metal removal in conjunction<br>
with a zinc preparation process in which the metal re-<br>
moval is performed in one or more reactors. In con-<br>
junction with the reactor, the redox potential and<br>
acidity and/or basicity are measured, and based on the<br>
measurement results, the process variables of metal<br>
removal are adjusted towards the desired direction.<br>
According to the invention, the measurements of the<br>
redox potential are performed from the sludge produced<br>
in the reactor outside the reaction vessel, preferably<br>
in conjunction with the outlet pipe of the sludge, and<br>
the measuring instrument is purified at predetermined<br>
intervals.<br>
A sludge is herein used to mean a solid mat-<br>
ter-rich solution the solid matter content of which<br>
can vary from a completely solution-like one to a<br>
nearly solid one.<br>
In metal removal, i.e. in the removal of co-<br>
balt, nickel, copper or cadmium, the target value is<br>
to obtain an impurity metal content less than 0.2 mg/1<br>
for each metal in a zinc-bearing solution. For germa-<br>
nium and antimony, the target value is less than 0.02<br>
mg/1.<br>
In one embodiment, the redox potential is<br>
preferably adjusted to be in the range -570 - -650 mV<br>
to precipitate cobalt, nickel and germanium, and in<br>
the range -480 - -550 mV to precipitate copper with<br>
respect to a calomel electrode.<br>
The invention has the advantage that the<br>
measuring instruments of the redox potential are<br>
placed outside the reactor, allowing the measuring in-<br>
struments to be purified at desired intervals. The<br>
fouling of the measuring instruments is prevented at<br>
the same time, and the measurement errors due to it,<br>
thus enabling more stabile measurements.<br><br>
The invention enables one to achieve in a<br>
metal removal process a smooth and uninterrupted op-<br>
eration which can minimise e.g. the consumption of the<br>
zinc powder to be introduced and accurately adjust<br>
other process variables. Furthermore, a highly puri-<br>
fied zinc solution is obtained for zinc electrolysis.<br>
Thanks to the invention, the metals to be removed in<br>
metal removal can be precipitated better as a whole.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the acid-<br>
ity and basicity of the reactor solution are deter-<br>
mined by means of a BT value. The BT value, i.e. the<br>
so-called re-titration value, describes the acidity or<br>
basicity of a solution; it: describes the status of a<br>
process more accurately than the pH value. A BT value<br>
is used to mean the amount of acidity needed to reach<br>
the turning point of titration. The BT value increases<br>
as the basicity of the sludge increases. Besides the<br>
feed solution, i.e. the zinc preparation solution, the<br>
BT value is affected by the amount of zinc powder and<br>
the return acid int roduced into the process. As the<br>
zinc powder is dissolved, either the precipitation of<br>
an impurity metal or the generation of hydrogen is ob-<br>
tained as a reduction reaction. The generation of hy-<br>
drogen raises the BT value. A zinc powder introduced<br>
into the process in an excess thus causes an increase<br>
in the BT. A high BT, e.g. more than 3.5, causes the<br>
fact that non-desired basic zinc sulphates and salts<br>
are precipitated on the surface of a soluble zinc pow-<br>
der, which slows down the dissolution of powder parti-<br>
cles and thus weakers the purification result. On the<br>
other hand, the non-desired precipitates foul the sur-<br>
faces of the produced end product, thus slowing down<br>
the precipitation of impurities. In that case, the in-<br>
troduction of zinc powder must be increased to obtain<br>
the desired result, which adds to the costs. Further-<br>
more, the basic salts in question may increase the<br>
filtering pressure of the overflow of a concentrator<br><br>
to be used in metaL removal, which makes the filtra-<br>
tion more difficult and may result in that the solid<br>
matter is passed through the filtering fabrics into<br>
the filtrate.<br>
Preferably, there is an attempt to obtain a<br>
low BT value, about 1.0-3.0, most preferably a BT<br>
value of about 2.<br>
The BT value is determined in a manner known<br>
per se by adding to the sample a certain amount<br>
reagent reacting with the sample and by titrating<br>
ter the reaction, the remaining reagent using the<br>
measurement solution.<br>
By monitoring the BT value and by preferably<br>
adjusting it to be Low, it is possible to achieve in<br>
the metal removal a good purification result of a zinc<br>
solution, a uniform solution and a low consumption of<br>
zinc powder. Furthermore, the BT value enables one to<br>
perform accurate determinations to evaluate the status<br>
of the process.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the solid<br>
matter content of the reactor solution is determined<br>
By monitoring and adjusting the solid matter con<br>
to be suitable, preferably to be in the range<br>
g/1, more preferably 30-100 g/1, a lot of active<br>
tion surface is obtained, which accelerates the pre-<br>
cipitation and affects the consumption of zinc powder.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the in-<br>
troduction of zinc powder into the metal removal reac-<br>
tor is regulated based on the measurement results.<br>
Zinc powder is preferably introduced 0.3-0.9 g, more<br>
preferably about 0.4-0.7 g per a feed litre of zinc<br>
solution.<br>
Preferably, besides the introduction of zinc<br>
powder, the redox potential, the acidity and/or basic-<br>
ity of the solution, the solid matter content and/or<br>
the temperature of the reactor are adjusted based on<br>
the measurement results.<br><br>
By regulating the temperature it is possible<br>
to prevent the formation of precipitating, non-desired<br>
substances. The temperature is optimised to be suit-<br>
able by taking into account that e.g. in cobalt re-<br>
moval, gypsum is precipitated at too low a tempera-<br>
ture, and at too high a temperature, anhydrite is<br>
starting to be precipitated. The precipitation of<br>
these solids can, however, be reduced by removing from<br>
the process big-sized solid matter particles, e.g. by<br>
classification.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the metal<br>
removal means cobalt removal. In one embodiment, the<br>
metal removal is performed at least in two reactors<br>
connected in serial.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the meas-<br>
uring instrument is arranged in conjunction with the<br>
outlet pipe of the reactor or in conjunction with the<br>
connecting pipe between the reactors. In one embodi-<br>
ment, the measuring instrument of acidity/basicity is<br>
arranged in conjunction with the reactor vessel.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the meas-<br>
urement of the redo potential is performed by means<br>
of a measurement electrode. Preferably, arranged in<br>
the outlet pipe of the reactor or in the connecting<br>
pipe between the reactors is a junction line, into<br>
which the electrode has been placed.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the meas-<br>
uring instrument is regularly cleaned, most preferably<br>
at intervals of 1-2 hours to prevent fouling.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, in con-<br>
junction with each reactor, measurements are performed<br>
that control, for each reactor specifically, the ad-<br>
justment of the desired process variable(s). In one<br>
preferred embodiment, after each reactor there is the<br>
measurement of the radox potential, which controls the<br>
reactor-specific intnoduction of zinc powder.<br><br>
In an alternative solution, t is possible to manually introduce the desired<br>
amount of zinc powder into the reactor.<br>
Further, the invention relates to an apparatus for controlling a continuous<br>
metal removal in conjunction with a zinc preparation process in which the metal<br>
removal is performed in one or more reactors, the apparatus comprising at least<br>
one measuring instrument for measuring the redox potential and acidity and/or<br>
basicity in conjunction with the reactor, at least one adjusting device for adjusting<br>
the process variables of the metal removal towards the desired direction based<br>
on the measurement results, and at least one control device for forwarding the<br>
measurement results from the measuring instrument to the adjusting device.<br>
According to the invention, the measuring instrument of the redox potential is<br>
arranged outside the reactor vessel, and is placed in conjunction with the pipe<br>
connected to the reactor, through which pipe; the sludge produced in the reactor<br>
flows, and the apparatus includes purification means for purifying the measuring<br>
instrument at predetermined intervals.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the invention is simple in structure and<br>
thus advantageous to implement.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the invention relates to the use of a<br>
method and apparatus in accordance with the invention in a cobalt removal<br>
process in conjunction with zinc preparation. In conjunction with a cobalt removal<br>
process it is possible to precipitate e.g. copper, nickel, germanium and antimony.<br>
In a cobalt removal process, e.g. arsenic oxide as an activator is added to a<br>
solution containing residual copper (e.g. 50-300 mg/l) from copper removal to<br>
accelerate the precipitation of metals from a zinc-bearing solution. In addition,<br>
reducing zinc powder is added to the solution, in which case copper arsenide is<br>
precipitated. Copper arsenide reacts in the solution with cobalt and nickel in the<br>
presence of zinc powder to form cobalt and nickel arsenide For example, in the<br>
presence of arsenic, cobalt and nickel can be precipitated relatively fast, in about<br><br>
1.5 hours, to form cobalt and nickel arsenide. The produced deposit, such as<br>
cobalt arsenide deposit, is recycled in the reactor as a solid matter to optimise<br>
the reaction rate and precipitatior surface. There must be in the process enough<br>
solid matter on whose surface the impurities are precipitated. The surface must<br>
consist of purified, metallic copper, or copper, cobalt or nickel arsenide to<br>
improve and activate the precipitation. The impurities that are precipita'ted on the<br>
surface of the particles, such as basic zinc sulphates and calcium sulphates,<br>
passivate the deposit and increase the particle size.<br>
Alternatively, the method and apparatus in accordance with the invention<br>
can also be used to separate or remove other metals in conjunction with a zinc<br>
preparation process.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the following section, the invention will be described by means of<br>
detailed embodiment examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a hydrometallurgic zinc, preparation<br>
process; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram illustrating one device embodiment in accordance with<br>
the invention in a cobalt removal process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a hydrometallurgical zinc preparation process. In a<br>
hydrometallurgical zinc preparation process, zinc ore is first concentrated 1, and<br><br>
the zinc concentrate is roasted 2. The purpose of the<br>
roasting 2 is to bring the sulphide zinc into a solu-<br>
ble oxide form. After the roasting 2, the zinc roast<br>
is dissolved into sulphuric acid in one or more phases<br>
3, whereby the zirc oxides react to form zinc sul-<br>
phate. In a dissolution phase 3, iron is precipitated<br>
as a basic sulphate, i.e. as a jarosite precipitate,<br>
gotite or hematite. In the dissolution phase 3, the<br>
dissolved impurities, e.g. copper, cobalt, nickel,<br>
germanium, antimony and cadmium, are removed from the<br>
zinc sulphate solution in solution purification 4,<br>
which is preferably performed in three phases 6, 7, 8.<br>
In the first phase 6, a main part of copper is removed<br>
by means of zinc dust 9. In the second phase 7, co-<br>
balt, nickel, germanium, antimony and the rest of the<br>
copper are precipitated from the solution by means of<br>
arsenic trioxide 10 and zinc dust 9 as metal arsenics,<br>
whereby zinc functions as a reducer. In the third<br>
phase 8, cadmium is removed by means of zinc dust 9.<br>
The purified zinc solution is introduced via cooling<br>
into electrolysis 5, wherein it is mixed with a circu-<br>
lating electrolyte, in the electrolysis 5, the zinc is<br>
reduced for cathodes to form metals by means of elec-<br>
tric current. The roasting, dissolution and electroly-<br>
sis are performed in a manner known per se in the<br>
field, so they are not described more fully herein.<br>
In the cobalt removal shown in Fig. 2, co-<br>
balt, nickel, germanium, antimony and residual copper<br>
are precipitated fron the zinc sulphate solution 18 in<br>
many phases in three reactors 11a, 11b and 11c con-<br>
nected in serial. Arranged in conjunction with the<br>
junction lines of the outlet pipes or connecting pipes<br>
of the reactors 11a-c are measurement electrodes 16a-c<br>
for the automatic measurement of the redox potential<br>
of the sludge produced in the reactor. The measurement<br>
electrodes 16a-c of the redox potential are connected<br>
to a control device (not shown in the figure) which<br><br>
transmits the measurement results to the adjustment<br>
means 17a-c of the feeding devices of zinc powder, for<br>
each reactor specifically, for introducing the desired<br>
amount of zinc powder into the reactors 11a-c, as the<br>
process is concerned. The electrodes are regularly<br>
washed at intervals of about an hour to prevent their<br>
fouling and the measurement errors due to it.<br>
In the device aa shown in Fig. 2, the BT<br>
value is determined using automatic titrators from the<br>
solution inside the reactors. The titrators are con-<br>
nected to a control system, whereby the measured BT<br>
values are transmitted to the control system, which<br>
controls the acidity and basicity of the sludge in the<br>
reactors lla-c towards the desired direction.<br>
Alternatively, the Redox potentials and BT<br>
values can be determined manually, whereby they must<br>
be input into the control system, or the desired proc-<br>
ess variables must be manually adjusted based on them.<br>
The zinc powder is introduced into the cobalt<br>
removal reactors 11a-c by means of feeding de<br>
17a-c known per se in the field, e.g. by meant,<br>
screw feeders. It is not advantageous to introdu<br>
zinc powder in a big stoichiometric amount in excess<br>
due to the creation of non-desired side reactions; an<br>
excess of zinc does not thus add to the precipitation<br>
rate. In cobalt removal, the redox potential, tempera-<br>
ture and the precipitation surface of the reactor af-<br>
fect the precipitation rate.<br>
The cobalt removal process includes, in<br>
tion, two concentrators 12 connected in pai<br>
which are arranged after the reactor 11c and of<br>
only one at a time is used. Arranged in the output<br>
of the overflow of the concentrator is a filter press<br>
for purifying the overflow from solid matter.<br>
The cobalt arsenide sludge produced in the<br>
precipitation reacto:rs 11a-c and precipitated in the<br>
concentrator 13 is settled on the bottom of the reac-<br><br>
tor, from which it is led out of the reactor via the<br>
junction line 19 cf the concentrator 12 as an under-<br>
flow, and is recycled back to the first reactor 11a.<br>
The cobalt sludge 13 can be classified using a classi-<br>
fication device 14 and the desired fraction 15 from<br>
the standpoint of the process can be recycled back to<br>
the first reactor 11a of the process. The coarse frac-<br>
tion, separated using the classification device and<br>
harmful from the standpoint of the invention, is re-<br>
moved from the process via the filters of the over-<br>
flow. Alternatively, the entire sludge fraction 21 can<br>
be recycled back to the reactor lla, or lead out of<br>
the process. A cobalt deposit is preferably recycled<br>
in such a manner that the solid matter content of a<br>
cobalt removal reactor(s) is about 10-200 g/1, more<br>
preferably 30-100 g/1.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
In this test, a continuous cobalt removal<br>
process was examined. In the test performed under<br>
cess conditions, zirc powder was introduced by means<br>
of a screw feeder in:o five metal removal reactor<br>
ranged in parallel. Arranged after each reactor,<br>
the connecting pipe between, them were the measurement<br>
electrodes of the reiox potential, which were used to<br>
measure the redox potential of the sludge coming out<br>
of the reactor for each reactor specifically. The<br>
measurement results controlled the introduction of<br>
zinc powder into the reactors for each reactor spe-<br>
cifically. The measurement electrodes were washed at<br>
intervals of an hour to prevent their fouling.<br>
The acidity and basicity of the reactor solu-<br>
tions were measured by means of the BT value using a<br>
titration method known per se. The BT value ranged be-<br>
tween 2.5-3.5.<br>
In the process, a consumption of zinc powder<br>
of about 0.6-0.7 g wall achieved.<br><br>
However, a high BT caused, soon after the<br>
starting of the process, the precipitation of the zinc<br>
silicate, i.e. hemimorphite. The zinc and silica con-<br>
centrations of the cobalt deposit in the process in-<br>
creased. The presence of hemimorphite caused zinc<br>
losses, since the dissolving of zinc from the deposit<br>
was not successful at the same time due to the filtra-<br>
tion difficulties caused by silica. The problem could<br>
be solved by reducing the BT value to about two.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this test, a continuous cobalt removal was<br>
examined under conditions similar to those of Example<br>
1, but the BT value was about 2.<br>
In the test, an uninterrupted run of more<br>
than 6 months was achieved, and furthermore as a re-<br>
sult of the process, a better and more uniform zinc-<br>
bearing solution. The concentrations of cobalt, nickel<br>
and copper measured from the zinc solution were prin-<br>
cipally less than 0.2 g/l, and those of germanium, an-<br>
timony and arsenic less than 0.02 mg/l.<br>
Based on the process tests, it was observed<br>
that the method and apparatus in accordance with the<br>
invention enabled one to achieve a small consumption<br>
of zinc powder in conjunction with metal removal reac-<br>
tors compared with other zinc preparation processes.<br>
It was possible to precipitate copper and cadmium in<br>
the solution purification, i.e. metal removal, practi-<br>
cally using a stoichiometric amount of zinc powder. To<br>
sufficiently precipitate cobalt and nickel, a slight<br>
excess of zinc powder was needed, the amount of the<br>
introduction of zinc powder being about 0.5 g/1. In<br>
other corresponding prior-art cobalt removing proc-<br>
esses, the amount of the introduction of zinc powder<br>
was multiple, about 3-4.5 g/1.<br>
The apparatus and method in accordance with<br>
the invention are applicable, in various embodiments,<br><br>
to the control of the removal of various metals in<br>
