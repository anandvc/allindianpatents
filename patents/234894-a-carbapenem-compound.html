				<td> The present invention relates to a carbapenem compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to carbapenem compounds which have excellent antibiotic activity and a broad antibiotic spectrum. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel carbapenem derivatives having a substituted imidazo[5,l-b]thiazole group at the 2-position on the carbapenem ring, or a salt thereof.<br>
Related Art<br>
Carbapenem derivatives have potent antibiotic activity and a broad antibiotic spectrum and thus have<br>
been energetically studied as a highly useful ^-lactam agent, and Imipenem, Panipenem, and Meropenem have already been clinically used.<br>
At the present time, however, both Imipenem and Panipenem, are used as a mixture due to instability against renal dehydropeptidase-1 (hereinafter referred to as "DHP-1") in the case of Imipenem and in order to reduce nephrotoxicity in the case of Panipenem. On the other hand, Meropenem, by virtue of the presence of a methyl group at the 1ÃŸ-position, has increased stability to DHP-1 and thus can be used alone. The stability of Meropenem to DHP-1, however, is still unsatisfactory. Further, antibiotic activities against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (hereinafter referred to as "MRSA") which has recently caused serious clinical problems, as well as against penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoneae (hereinafter referred to as "PRSP"), resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Influenzavirus, are not always satisfactory. Drugs effective for these bacteria which induce infectious diseases have been dedired in the art.<br>
For example, carbapenem derivatives in which a carbon  atom  on  an  imidazo [5,1-b]thiazole  group  is<br><br>
attached to the 2-position of the carbapenem ring are disclosed in WO 98/32760 and WO 00/06581.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have now found that a certain group of carbapenem derivatives having an imidazo[5,1-b]thiazole group have high antibiotic activities against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria and, at the same time, have high antibiotic activities against MRSA, PRSP, Influenzavirus,<br>
and p-lactamase producing bacteria and are also highly stable to DHP-1. The present invention is based on such finding.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide carbapenem derivatives which have high antibiotic activities also against MRSA, PRSP,<br>
Influenzavirus, and p-lactamase producing bacteria and are stable to DHP-1.<br>

amount of one (1) equivalent or an excessive amount<br>
relative to trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in an<br>
inert solvent, such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, or toluene, or a mixed solvent composed<br>
of two or more of these inert solvents at -50Â°C to +50Â°C<br>
for 10 min to 24 hr and then subjecting the reaction<br>
mixture to the conventional separation and purification<br>
procedure.<br>
In the second step, the compound of formula (IV) can be converted to the compound of formula (VI) by the following method. Specifically, the compound of formula (VI) can be prepared by reacting the compound of formula<br>
(IV)	with one (1) equivalent or an excessive amount of<br>
the compound of formula (V) in the presence of 0.001 to<br>
one (1) equivalent of a palladium catalyst, for example,<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0),       tris(di<br>
benzylideneacetone )dipalladium(0),         or        a<br>
tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)-chloroform<br>
adduct, 0.01 to one (1) equivalent of a phosphine ligand,<br>
for example,  triphenylphosphine,  tri-2-furylphosphine,<br>
tri-2-thienylphosphine,         or         tris(2,4,6-<br>
trimethoxyphenyl)phosphine, and 1 to 10 equivalents of<br>
an  additive,  for  example,  zinc  chloride,  lithium<br>
chloride,  or  cesium  fluoride  either  alone  or  in<br>
combination,  in  an  inert  solvent,  for  example,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, acetonitrile,<br>
acetone, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, N,N-diraethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyIpyrrolidinone, or hexamethylphosphoric triamide, or a mixed solvent composed of two or more of these<br>
inert solvents at 0Â°C to 100Â°C for 10 min to 7 days and then subjecting the reaction mixture to the conventional post-treatment.<br>
Finally, in the third step, the compound of formula (I) according to the present invention can be prepared by deprotecting the compound of formula (VI) by a deprotection reaction in one step or plural steps depending on the kinds of the protective groups.<br>
In this case, the deprotection reactions, which vary depending upon the kinds of the protective groups used, can be carried out according to the conventional methods commonly known in the art. When any or all of the protective groups can be removed under acidic conditions, for example, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid or citric acid, or a Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride is used. When the protective groups are removed under reducing conditions, catalytic reduction with a variety of catalysts, or a metallic reducing agent such as zinc or iron may be used. When R4 represents a silyl type protective group, for example, a t-butyldimethylsilyl group/ a trimethylsilyl group or a triethylsilyl group, the protective group can be easily removed with the use of a fluorine ion reagent, for example, tetrabutylammonium fluoride. When R4 represents allyloxycarbonyl and R5 represents allyl, the protective groups can be easily removed with the use of a variety of palladium complexes, for example, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0).<br>
The compound of formula (I) thus obtained can be isolated and purified, for example, by crystallization or by chromatography with a nonionic macro-high porous resin, gel filtration with Sephadex or the like, or<br>
reverse phase silica gel column chromatography.<br>
Compounds  of  formula  (I),  wherein  Hy  has  a quaternary ammonium atom, can be prepared according to scheme 2. Scheme 2<br><br><br><br>

In the above scheme, R1 and n are as defined in formula (I); R4, R5, R7, R8, and Hy' are as defined in scheme 1; R9 represents optionally substituted lower alkyl; and Y represents a suitable leaving group, for example, Cl, Br, I, -OS02CF3, -OS02CH3, or -OSO2PhCH3.<br>
Specifically, the compound of formula (VII) can be prepared by adding one (1) equivalent or an excessive amount   of   R9-Y,   for   example,   methyl   iodide, carbamoylmethyl iodide, methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, benzyl        bromide,        or        3-azidopropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, to the compound of formula (VI) in the absence or presence of an inert solvent, for example,   acetonitrile,   acetone,   tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane,  toluene,  N,N-dimethylformamide,  N,N-dimethylacetamide, or dimethylsulfoxide, either alone or<br><br>
as a mixture of two or more of the inert solvents, and<br>
allowing a reaction to proceed at -80Â°C to +60Â°C for 15 min to one week, and then subjecting the reaction mixture to the conventional post-treatment.<br>
The compound of formula (VII) can be led to the compound of formula (I) in the same manner as in the compound of formula (VI).<br>
Compounds of formula (II) according to the present invention can be produced according to scheme 3. Scheme 3<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In the above scheme, R1, R2, R3, n, and Hy are as defined in formula (I); and R4, R5, R7, R8, and Hy' are as defined in scheme 1.<br>
Specifically, the compound of formula (II) according to the present invention can be prepared depending upon the kind of Hy by deprotecting the compound of formula (VI) by a deprotection reaction in one step or plural steps depending on the kinds of the protective groups in the same manner as described above.<br>
The compound of formula (II) thus obtained can be isolated and purified, for example, by crystallization<br>
or by chromatography with a nonionic macro-high porous resin, gel filtration with Sephadex or the like, or reverse phase silica gel column chromatography.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention have high antibiotic activities against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria and, at the  same time,  have  high  antibiotic  activities<br>
against MRSA, PRSP, Influenzavirus, and (3-lactamase producing bacteria. Further, they have low toxicity and are also stable to DHP-1. Therefore, the compounds according to the present invention can be used for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by various pathogenic bacteria in animals including humans. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound according to the present invention or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof as active ingredient can be administered orally or parenterally by administration routes, for example, intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous, rectal or percutaneous administration to human and non-human animals.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound according to the present invention as active ingredient may be formed into appropriate dosage forms depending on administration routes. Specifically, the compounds according to the present invention may be mainly formulated into, for example, injections such as intravenous injections and intramuscular injections; oral preparations such as capsules, tablets, granules, powders, pills, fine subtilaes, and troches; preparations for rectal administrations; and oleaginous suppositories.<br>
These preparations may be prepared by conventional methods with commonly used adjuvants for preparations, for example, excipients, extenders, binders, humidifiers, disintegrants,  surface  active  agents,  lubricants, dispersants, buffers, preservatives, dissolution aids,<br>
ntiseptics, flavoring agents, analgesic agents, and stabilizers.<br>
Non-toxic adjuvants usable herein include, for example, lactose, fructose, glucose, starch, gelatin, magnesium carbonate, synthetic magnesium silicate, talc, magnesium stearate, methylcellulose or a salt thereof, gum arabic, polyethylene glycol, syrup, petrolatum, glycerin, ethanol, propylene glycol, citric acid, sodium chloride, sodium sulfite, and sodium phosphate.<br>
