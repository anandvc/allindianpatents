				<td>The Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to sensor system for detecting the presence of deoxidizing gases, in particular, to a metal-oxide semiconductor based sensor system for detection of deoxidizing gases such as dimethylamine and trimethylamine vapours evolving out of the decaying fish. The system of the present invention can be used to monitor presence of deoxidizing gases and thereby monitor the quality of fish in a rapid and non-destructive way.<br>
Background Art<br>
The traditional method for estimating the freshness of fish is to go by the microbial counts of pathogenic relevance in the degraded fish. Of late, fish freshness studies have been performed using different approaches such as amperometric biosensors for determinations of amines, enzyme reactor based systems, GC (Gas Chromatography) analysis of amines, Mass spectrometry, F!A (Flow Injection Analysis) etc. Most of these methods are relatively time consuming, required experienced personal and expensive apparatus.<br>
"Total Volatile Basic amines" (TVB) is one of the most widely used measurements of seafood quality. It is a general term, which includes the measurement of trimethylamine (produced by spoilage bacteria), dimethylamine (produced by autolytic enzymes during frozen storage), ammonia and other volatile basic nitrogenous compounds associated with seafood spoilage. Gas Chromatography is a method for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures of volatile organic and inorganic compounds. The apparatus used in gas chromatography consists of four basic components: a carrier-gas supply and flow controller, a sample inlet system providing a means for introduction of the sample, the chromatographic column and associated column oven, and the detector system. When a mixture of components is injected into a chromatograph equipped with an appropriate column, the components travel down the column at different rates and therefore reach the end of the column at different times. A detector is positioned at the end of the column to quantify the concentrations of individual components of the mixture. Though the gas chromatographs can provide superior discrimination capabilities with reasonably high precision, sensitivity and reproducibility these are not portable and hence cannot be used in-situ. Moreover, the chromatographs are<br><br>
2<br>
expensive (the price for the bench-top model varies in the range of $20,000 to $50,000) and require skilled personnel to operate. Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME) is relatively a new method that allows trace analytes to be introduced into the chromatographic system without the need for solvents. This method involves exposing a small segment of fused silica fiber coated with a non-volatile polymeric material. The coated fiber is mounted in a syringe-tike device that can expose the fiber to the desired environment and also withdraw it for protection during transfer to GC. The analyte of the interest adsorbs on the fiber coating and is thermally desorbed when introduced into the chromatographic injection port. The direct SPME determination is also a time consuming and destructive method as in a typical process finely ground fish fillet is weighed in a vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and alkaline solution is added. The stirred sample is then heated to liberate the volatile bases and then cooled to near room temperature. For measurement, the SPME fiber is exposed for a couple of minutes in the headspace of the vial and-inserted in the measuring device equipped with Flame Photometric Detector (FID). The throughput of the analysis is about 10 samples/hour.<br>
In Mass Spectrometry the sampled gas mixtures are ionized and charged molecular fragments are produced. These fragments are sorted in a mass filter according to their mass to charge ratio. The ions are detected as electrical signals with an electron multiplier or a Faraday plate. Though the mass spectrometers have good discrimination capabilities and can detect a wide range of chemicals, the units appear to be quite expensive (more than $40,000) and spectral overlaps can be a problem in detecting mixtures of unknown composition. Moreover these are often not portable enough to carry into the site of application.<br>

It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a sensor system for detecting presence of deoxidizing gases in particular a metal-oxide semiconductor based sensor adapted to undergo change in conductivity in presence of trace amount of such deoxidizing gases<br><br>

In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention the said substrate with metal oxide coating, the heating means and the electrodes are housed in a composite unit adapted to be operatively connected to a power source.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The sensor system of the present invention is directed to detect presence of deoxidizing gases, more particularly dimethyl amine and trimethyl amine emanating from decomposing fishes, by change in electrical conductivity of the said-metal oxide coating in presence of such gases. The said sensor system monitors fish freshness in a rapid, continuous, nondestructive and user-friendly' manner from close as well as remote areas.<br>
 The substrate of the said sensor system is made of glass or quartz or AI2O3: Such substrate comprises 0.8 mm to 1.5 mm in thickness, preferably 1 mm, 4.5 mm to 5.5 mm in width and preferably 5 mm and 7 mm to 9 mm in length, preferably 8 mm.<br>
The electrodes of the said sensor system are a couple of parallel electrodes made preferably of gold or platinum. Their thickness ranges from 0.8 µm to 1.2 µm and preferably 1µm and the width from 0.9 mm to 1.1 mm and preferably 1 mm deposited on the substrate by e-beam evaporation. In the bonding pad region the width of the electrodes is from 1.9 to 2.1 mm, preferably 2 mm.<br><br>
5<br>
The metal oxide is deposited as a thin film of said oxide, preferably of ZnO and TiO2 on the substrate and at least partially on the parallel electrodes. Such deposition of the metal oxide on the substrate can be carried out involving CVD methods. Preferably, the CVD method disclosed and claimed in co-pending application no 512/CAL/2001 may be followed.<br>
The thickness of the metal oxide layer-ranges from 0.8 µm to 1.2 µm, preferably 1mm, width is of 4.5 mm to 5.5mm, preferably 5 mm and length is 4.5 mm to 5.5mm, preferably 5 mm.<br>
This metal-oxide layer acts as the gas-sensing element based on its resistivity change upon exposure to the test gas such as hydrogen, dimethyl amine, trimethyl amine at selective operating temperatures. It has been found by way of the present invention that metal oxide-layers such as ZnO layer shows sensitivity to dimethylamine from decomposing fish at a temperature of 200 to 400°C. However, the ZnO has highest sensitivity to the said gas is found to be at 300°C. The ZnO coating is adapted to adsorb oxygen when heated to the said optimum' temperature in air and this adsorbed oxygen forms a potential barrier increasing, resistance to current flow. In presence of deoxidizing gas, such as dimethyl amine emanating from decomposing-fish, this oxygen is consumed for total oxidation of the said gas following the reaction below:<br>
(CH3)2 NH + O-     NO2 + CO2 +H2O + e-.<br>
and e", the free electron thus released enhances the electrical conduction of the ZnO coating.<br>
The heating means used is preferably meander-shaped platinum heater attached to the backside of the substrate. This heating arrangement provides requisite temperature for the optimum operation of the sensor. It varies in thickness from 1.5 µm to 2.5 µm and is preferably 2 µm.<br><br>
6<br>
As discussed above the sensor system can be housed in a suitable composite unit obtained of preferably high impact polycarbonate housing having at a surface portion thereof a double gauze for easy passage of the said deoxidizing gas to said metal oxide coating and electrical connection means to operatively connect the same to power source. Such a composite unit is portable and can be connected to an associated circuitry that may be closely or remotely placed for desired indication of decay of fish and the like.<br>
The said associated circuitry may be integrally formed along with said composite unit of said substrate with said metal oxide coating, heating means and electrodes or can be operatively connected to said composite unit from separate remote locations.<br>
The associated circuitry can be any conventional circuitry adapted to monitor the<br>
variance in current flow due to change in the resistivity of the metal oxide due to presence of deoxidizing gases and generate corresponding output signals to indicate the presence of such gases. The sensor system can be connected in series with a potentiometer which in turn is connected to the potential divider. The potential dividers are operatively connected to the comparator. The comparator sends output signals via the transistor to the signal out put device to generate indicator signals such as audible buzzer beeps, visual signals, voice signals and the like, preferably audible buzzer-beeps.<br>
