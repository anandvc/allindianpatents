HYBRID POWERTRAIN HAVING THREE INTERCONNECTING<br>
MEMBERS AND BRAKES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to electrically variable transmissions<br>
having three planetary gear sets, three motor/generators and at least one brake that arc<br>
controllable to provide continuously variable speed ratio ranges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Electric hybrid vehicles offer the potential for significant fuel economy<br>
improvements over their conventional counterparts; however, their market penetration<br>
is limited because of their relatively high cost/benefit ratio. It becomes pertinent to<br>
develop hybrid technologies that reduce cost and improve vehicle fuel economy. Two<br>
of the contributors to the cost of the hybrid vehicle are the energy storage (battery)<br>
power capacity and the size of the electric motor/generators required to realize all-<br>
electric reverse in many electric-variable-transmission (EVT)-based hybrid systems.<br>
The factors that affect the efficiency of the system include the operating efficiency of<br>
the motor/generators and the parasitic losses of high-pressure hydraulic pump and<br>
clutch spin losses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	This invention provides continuously-variable hybrid transmissions<br>
that utilize a combination of three interconnected planetary gear sets, electric<br>
motor/generators and brakes to offer multi-mode EVTs with capability for scries<br>
hybrid reverse driving, thus reducing the need for massive and expensive energy<br>
storage (battery), and minimizing operation of the motor/generators under highly<br>
inefficient conditions. In the series hybrid reverse driving mode, power from the<br>
engine is used to drive at least one of the motor/generators to generate electric power,<br>
and the generated electric power is delivered to at least one of the other<br>
motor/generators to drive the vehicle in the forward or reverse direction. This<br><br>
2<br>
capability eliminates the need for significant power from the battery to drive the<br>
vehicle in reverse, as is currently the case in known production hybrid vehicles.<br>
[0004]	The hybrid transmission family of the present invention provides low-<br>
content, electrically variable transmission mechanisms including first, second and<br>
third differential gear sets, a battery (or similar energy storage device), three electric<br>
machines serving interchangeably as motors or generators and at least one brake.<br>
Preferably, the differential gear sets are planetary gear sets, but other gear<br>
arrangements may be implemented, such as bevel gears or differential gearing to an<br>
offset axis.<br>
[0005]	In this description, the first, second and third planetary gear sets may<br>
be counted first to third in any order (i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.).<br>
[0006]	Each of the three planetary gear sets has three members. The first,<br>
second or third member of each planetary gear set can be any one of a sun gear, ring<br>
gear or carrier, or alternatively a pinion.<br>
[0007]	Each carrier can be either a single-pinion carrier (simple) or a double-<br>
pinion carrier (compound).<br>
[0008]	The input shaft is continuously connected with a member of the first,<br>
second or third planetary gear set. The output shaft is continuously connected with<br>
another member of the first, second or third planetary gear set.<br>
[0009]	A first fixed interconnecting member continuously connects the first<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with the first member of the second planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0010]	A second fixed interconnecting member continuously connects the<br>
second member of the first planetary gear set with the second member of the second<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	A third fixed interconnecting member continuously connects the third<br>
member of the second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0012]	A first motor/generator is connected to a member of the first or second<br>
planetary gear set.<br><br>
3<br>
[0013]	A second motor/generator is connected to a member of the second or<br>
third planetary gear set.<br>
[0014]	A third motor/generator is connected to another member of the first or<br>
third planetary gear set.<br>
[0015]	The motor/generators are connected with the members of the planetary<br>
gear sets either directly or through other planetary gear sets, belt/chain or off-set gears<br>
with or without torque multiplication.<br>
[0016]	A first brake selectively connects at least one member of the first,<br>
second or third planetary gear set, preferably via one of the interconnecting members,<br>
with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing). This brake is operable to<br>
hold the member stationary and enable series hybrid mode operation or to lower the<br>
torque requirement of one of the motor/generators. Using the first brake rather than<br>
one of the motor/generators to enable the hybrid mode of operation reduces the torque<br>
capacity requirement for the motors and improves efficiency. Also, application of the<br>
first brake during electric-only drive (forward or reverse) allows the engine to be<br>
started without "engine start shock" that is felt in some current EVT hybrid vehicles.<br>
[0017]	An optional second brake selectively connects another member of the<br>
first, second or third planetary gear set with a stationary member and is operable to<br>
hold a member of the first, second or third planetary gear set stationary under certain<br>
operating conditions to provide different EVT ranges. The brake may be connected in<br>
parallel with one of the motor/generators and be applied under operating conditions<br>
that would otherwise require one of the motor/generators to operate at zero or near-<br>
zero speeds, thereby improving efficiency by preventing the inefficient use of electric<br>
power to maintain zero or near-zero speed.<br>
[0018]	An optional third brake selectively connects another member of the<br>
first, second or third planetary gear set with a stationary member and is able to hold<br>
the member of the planetary gear set stationary under certain operating conditions to<br>
provide different EVT ranges. The brake may be connected in parallel with one of the<br>
motor/generators and be applied under operating conditions that would otherwise<br>
require one of the motor/generators to operate at zero or near-zero speeds, thereby<br><br>
4<br>
improving efficiency by preventing the inefficient use of electric power to maintain<br>
zero or near-zero speed.<br>
[0019]	An optional fourth brake selectively connects another member of the<br>
first, second or third planetary gear set with a stationary member and is able to hold<br>
the member of the planetary gear set stationary under certain operating conditions to<br>
provide different EVT ranges. The brake may be connected in parallel with one of the<br>
motor/generators and be applied under operating conditions that would otherwise<br>
require one of the motor/generators to operate at zero or near-zero speeds, thereby<br>
improving efficiency by preventing the inefficient use of electric power to maintain<br>
zero or near-zero speed.<br>
[0020]	The brakes are preferably electromechanically actuated to eliminate the<br>
need for a high-pressure hydraulic pump and associated losses; however, other<br>
conventional brake actuation methods may be used.<br>
[0021]	The three motor/generators are operated in a coordinated fashion to<br>
yield continuously variable forward and reverse speed ratios between the input shall<br>
and the output shaft, while minimizing the rotational speeds of the motor-generators<br>
and optimizing the overall efficiency of the system. The tooth ratios of the planetary<br>
gear sets can be suitably selected to match specific applications.<br>
[0022]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0034]	With reference to Figure 1, a powertrain 10 is shown, including an<br>
engine 12 connected to one preferred embodiment of the improved electrically<br>
variable transmission (EVT), designated generally by the numeral 14. Transmission<br>
14 is designed to receive at least a portion of its driving power from the engine 12.<br>
As shown, the engine 12 has an output shaft that serves as the input member 17 of the<br>
transmission 14. A transient torque damper (not shown) may also be implemented<br>
between the engine 12 and the input member 17 of the transmission.<br>
[0035]	In the embodiment depicted the engine 12 may be a fossil fuel engine,<br>
such as a gasoline or diesel engine which is readily adapted to provide its available<br>
power output typically delivered at a selectable number of revolutions per minute<br>
(RPM).<br>
[0036]	Irrespective of the means by which the engine 12 is connected to the<br>
transmission input member 17, the transmission input member 17 is operatively<br>
connected to a planetary gear set in the transmission 14.<br>
[0037]	An output member 19 of the transmission 14 is connected to a final<br>
drive 16.<br>
[0038]	The transmission 14 utilizes three differential gear sets, preferably in<br>
the nature of planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40. The planetary gear set 20 employs an<br>
outer gear member 24, typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member<br>
24 circumscribes an inner gear member 22, typically designated as the sun gear. A<br>
carrier member 26 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 27 such that each<br>
planet gear 27 simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear<br>
member 24 and the inner, sun gear member 22 of the first planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0039]	The planetary gear set 30 also employs an outer gear member 34,<br>
typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 34 circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 32, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 36<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 37 such that each planet gear 37<br>
simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 34 and the<br>
inner, sun gear member 32 of the planetary gear set 30.<br><br>
7<br>
[0040]	The planetary gear set 40 also employs an outer gear member 44,<br>
typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear member 44 circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member 42, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier member 46<br>
rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 47 such that each planet gear 47<br>
simultaneously, and meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 44 and the<br>
inner, sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0041]	The input shaft 17 is continuously connected to the sun gear member<br>
32 of the planetary gear set 30. The output shaft 19 is continuously connected to the<br>
carrier member 46 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0042]	A first interconnecting member 70 continuously connects the carrier<br>
member 26 of the planetary gear set 20 with the sun gear member 32 of the planetary<br>
gear set 30. A second interconnecting member 72 continuously connects the ring gear<br>
member 24 of the planetary gear set 20 with the ring gear member 34 of the planetary<br>
gear set 30. A third interconnecting member 74 continuously connects the carrier<br>
member 36 of the planetary gear set 30 with the ring gear member 44 of the planetary<br>
gear set 40.<br>
[0043]	A first brake 50 selectively connects the ring gear member 34 of the<br>
planetary gear set 30 and the ring gear member 24 of the planetary gear set 20 via the<br>
interconnecting member 72 with the transmission housing 60. The brake 50 may<br>
lower the torque requirement of one of the motor/generators 82. A second brake 52<br>
selectively connects the carrier member 36 of the planetary gear set 30 and the ring<br>
gear member 44 of the planetary gear set 40 via interconnecting member 74 with the<br>
transmission housing 60. This brake 52 enables series hybrid driving mode wherein<br>
power from the engine 12 is used to drive motor/generators 80 and 82 to generate<br>
electric power, and the generated electric power is delivered to the motor/generator 84<br>
to drive the vehicle in forward or reverse.<br>
[0044]	The first embodiment 10 also incorporates first, second and third<br>
motor/generators 80, 82 and 84, respectively. The stator of the first motor/generator<br>
80 is secured to the transmission housing 60. The rotor of the first motor/generator 80<br>
is secured to the sun gear member 22 of the planetary gear set 20.<br><br>
8<br>
[0045]	The stator of the second motor/generator 82 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing 60. The rotor of the second motor/generator 82 is secured to the<br>
ring gear member 24 of the planetary gear set 20 and the ring gear member 34 of the<br>
planetary gear set 30 via interconnecting member 72.<br>
[0046]	The stator of the third motor/generator 84 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing 60. The rotor of the third motor/generator 84 is secured to the<br>
sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0047]	Returning now to the description of the power sources, it should be<br>
apparent from the foregoing description, and with particular reference to figure 1, that<br>
the transmission 14 selectively receives power from the engine 12. The hybrid<br>
transmission also receives power from an electric power source 86, which is opcrably<br>
connected to a controller 88. The electric power source 86 may be one or more<br>
batteries. Other electric power sources, such as capacitors or fuel cells, that have the<br>
ability to provide, or store, and dispense electric power may be used in place of or in<br>
combination with batteries without altering the concepts of the present invention. The<br>
speed ratio between the input shaft and output shaft is prescribed by the speeds of the<br>
three motor/generators and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear<br>
sets. Those with ordinary skill in the transmission art will recognize that desired<br>
input/output speed ratios can be realized by selective engagement of the brakes and<br>
suitable selection of the speeds of the three motor/generators.<br>

the ring gear member 124 of the planetary gear set 120 with the ring gear member 134<br>
of the planetary gear set 130. A third interconnecting member 174 continuously<br>
connects the carrier member 136 of the planetary gear set 130 with the ring gear<br>
member 144 of the planetary gear set 140.<br>
[0057]	A first brake 150 selectively connects the ring gear member 124 and<br>
the ring gear member 134 via interconnecting member 172 with the transmission<br>
housing 160. A second brake 152 selectively connects the carrier member 136 and<br>
