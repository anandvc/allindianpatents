More preferably, R1 is phenoxymethyl or phenyl substituted by a chlorine, fluorine or bromine atom or a methyl or trifluoromethyl group, which atom or group is preferably located in the meta position. Most preferably R1 is phenyl substituted by a chlorine atom located in the meta position.<br>
Preferably, R2 is hydrogen or methyl. Most preferably R2 is hydrogen.<br>
Preferably, R3 is bonded to the carbon atom meta to the bonded phenyl ring.   In a compound of Formula (IA), R3 is preferably C02H. In a compound of Formula (II), R3 is preferably C02CH3.<br>
Preferably, at least one of R4 and R5 is hydrogen. Most preferably, both R4 and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
Preferably Y is CH.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds, or compounds of the processes, of the invention include those in which each variable is selected from the preferred groups for each variable. Even more preferable compounds of the invention include those where each variable is selected from the more preferred or most preferred groups for each variable.<br>
Reagents for the transformation of a compound of Formula (II) to a compound of Formula (I) include any suitable reagent for the reduction of amide carbonyl bonds, e.g. borane-ether, borane-sulfide, borane-amine complexes and also conditions which form borane in situ (for example, sodium borohydride and iodine or sulfuric acid). Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene or ethers, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. The reaction may be conveniently carried out on a solid substrate, such as a bead or standard substrate used in solid-phase synthesis. For example, a compound of Formula (II) may be attached to the solid substrate through the group R3, i.e. -C02-solid substrate.<br>
In order to form a compound of Formula (IA) wherein R7 is hydrogen, the step of reductiojLOf-acompound,pf.Formula (II) should be followed by hydrolysis of the resulting ester group R7.<br>
A compound of Formula (II) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula (III) with a compound of Formula (IV)<br><br><br>
using any suitable method for teaming an amide link, e.g. suitable coupling agents include diimides, e.g. diisopropylcarbodiimide, dtfydohexylcarbodiimide, or carbonyl diimidazole, hydroxytriazoles and equivalents, or chloroformates, whilst suitable solvents include esters, e.g. ethyl acetate, ethers, halogenated solvents, N-methylpyrroiidinone, acetonitrile or trifluorobenzene.<br>

Compounds of Formula ("0 are commercially available or may be prepared by standard methods, for example, as described in the examples herein.<br>
Compounds of Formula (IV) may be prepared from compounds of Formula (V)<br><br>
using any suitable method for forming an amide link. For example, a compound of Formula (V) may be treated with a compound of Formula (VIII)<br><br>
using standard coupling procedures, e.g. diimide coupling agents, e.g. diisopropylcarbodiimide, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or carrjonyl diimidazole with a suitable glycine compound, e.g. N-Boc-glycine, in a suitable solvent such as esters, e.g. ethyl acetate, ethers, or hydrocarbons. P2 is a standard protecting group for a riitrogen, for example butoxy carbonyl.<br>
Compounds of Formula (V) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula 'Vh<br>
5237),<br><br><br>
where Z is halogen or triflate, using a suitable boronic acid coupling conditions, e.g. palladium on carbon and sodium carbonate or Pd(PPh3)4 (tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0)), followed by reduction of the nitro group using standard methods, e.g. under hydrogen using a suitable catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, DME, ethyl acetate, toluene, iso-octane, cyclohexane or water or mixtures thereof, optionally at elevated temperature.<br>
Compounds of Formula^      may also be conveniently prepared using a two step one-pot reaction starting from reaction of a compound of Formula (VI) with a compound of Formula (VII) under conditions described above, i.e. in the presence of a palladium on carbon catalyst, followed by reduction of the nitro group under hydrogen, using the reagents described above.<br>
Compounds of Formula (V) may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula (VII) with a compound of Formula (IX) using standard boronic acid coupling methods described above.<br><br>
