				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing acetic acid by oxidation of<br>
ethane with high selectivity and in high yield in fluidized-bed reactors.<br>
The catalytic gas-phase oxidation of ethane to ethylene and acetic acid has<br>
been known for a long time. The reaction is influenced essentially by the<br>
choice of reaction conditions; this is particularly true of the selectivity of the<br>
reaction. In general, acetic acid is formed only as by-product, while the<br>
main product is ethylene which may, under some circumstances, be<br>
oxidized further to carbon dioxide.<br>
DE 196 30 832 A1, DE 196 20 542 A1, DE 197 45 902 A1, WO 98/47850<br>
and WO 98/47851 describe a process for preparing acetic acid by partial<br>
oxidation of ethane using MoaPdbXcYd as catalysts in a fixed bed. The<br>
catalyst has a high stability and a high selectivity in the oxidation of ethane to<br>
acetic acid. However, difficulties are presented in the process by the fact that<br>
the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid is strongly exothermic. Particularly in<br>
relatively large fixed-bed reactors, the heat of reaction can be removed only<br>
unsatisfactorily. This results in an increase in the temperature in the reactor<br>
and thus a reduction in the selectivity of the reaction.<br>
To circumvent this problem, attempts have been made to carry out the<br>
reaction in a fluidized catalyst bed as described, for example, in<br>
US 5,300,684, where cooling tubes are located directly in the fluidized-bed<br>
reactor to remove heat. A further development of the process is described<br>
in WO 00/14047. A disadvantage of the fluidized-bed process as described<br>
there has hitherto been that the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid still<br>
proceeds with a low selectivity and a lower space-time yield than in a fixed-<br>
bed reactor.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the<br>
oxidation of ethane to acetic acid in a fluidized-bed reactor which can be<br>
operated with higher selectivity and thus with a higher yield than the<br>
processes described hitherto.<br>
In the present invention, it has surprisingly been able to be shown that the<br>
selectivity of the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid depends on the size of<br>
the gas bubbles in the fluidized catalyst bed. In particular, bubble sizes of<br>
a diameter of 
At a given average particle size of the catalyst used, the size of the bubbles<br>
can be set by controlling the volume flow of gas. Bubble sizes of 
can only be achieved by use of catalyst particles having a mean diameter<br>
of less than or equal to 80 µm.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for the direct catalytic<br>
oxidation of ethane to acetic acid in a fluidized bed comprising up to 70% of<br>
catalyst particles having a diameter of less than or equal to 80 |xm. The<br>
fluidized bed preferably additionally contains smaller particles having a<br>
particle size of from 10 to 60 urn, and the distribution of the particle sizes<br>
should be such that 10-60% of the particles have a diameter of less than<br>
60 µm. Particular preference is given to a distribution of the particle sizes<br>
such that catalyst particles are present in a diameter range of 10-40 yon. In<br>
a particularly preferred embodiment, the diameter of 20-50% of the catalyst<br>
particles is less than 40 µm.<br>
The fluidized bed index to be set (the fluidized bed index is the ratio of gas<br>
velocity set to minimum fluidization velocity) has to be above 1. This means<br>
that the fluidized bed has to be in the fluid state. At a pressure of 16 bar<br>
and a temperature of 280°C, the minimum fluidization velocity at a particle<br>
diameter of 80 µm is 5.85 mm/s. The fluidized bed index is preferably in the<br>
range from 1 to 12.<br>
As catalysts, it is possible to use all catalysts known to those skilled in the<br>
art. Catalysts which have been found to be advantageous are catalysts of<br>
the formula (I):<br>
MoaPdbXcYd (I)<br>
where X is one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Cr,<br>
Mn, Nb, B, Ta, Ti, V, Te, W and Re and<br>
Y is one or more elements selected from the group consisting of B,<br>
Al, Ga, In, Pt, Zn, Cd, Bi, Ce, Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Ag, Au, Fe, Ru, Cs,<br>
Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Li, K, Na, Rb, Be, Nb, Zr, Hf, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Si, Sn,<br>
TI and U.<br>
The indices a, b, c and d are the gram atom ratios of the corresponding<br>
elements, where, based on a = 1<br>
b is in the range from 0.0001 to 0.01, preferably from 0.0001 to<br>
0.001,<br>
c is in the range from 0.1 to 1 and<br>
d is in the range from 0 to 1.<br>
X and/or Y may also represent a plurality of elements, in which case the<br>
indices c and d may assume different values for different elements.<br>
The catalyst particularly preferably comprises at least one of the following<br>
compositions in combination with oxygen:<br>

Mo1 .00Pd0.0005Vo.45Nb0.03Sb0.01 Ca0.01<br>

M01 .00Pd0.00075V0.50Nb0.09W 0.01 Pd0.0003<br>
Apart from the reaction gases ethane and oxygen, the reaction gas mixture<br>
may further comprise water vapor and inert gases such as nitrogen or<br>
carbon dioxide. It is also possible to employ a reaction gas composition<br>
above the explosive limit in the fluidized-bed reactor. However, the reactor<br>
is preferably operated using an excess of inert gas, water and/or ethane.<br>
Water vapor accelerates the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid at the<br>
expense of the oxidation of ethane to ethylene and thus results in an<br>
increase in the selectivity to acetic acid.<br>
The process is preferably carried out at low temperatures. Low<br>
temperatures increase the selectivity of the oxidation reaction in favor of<br>
acetic acid. A temperature range of from 100 to 500°C at a reactor<br>
pressure of from 1 to 50 bar is preferred.<br>
The density of the catalyst particles can be in the range from 500 to 6000<br>
kg/m3. To carry out the process, it is possible to use, for example, a<br>
fluidized-bed reactor as is described in US 5,300,684.<br>
The process of the invention has a high selectivity, and increased space-<br>
time yields can accordingly be achieved in the oxidation of ethane to acetic<br>
acid at moderate temperatures in a fluidized-bed reactor. Furthermore,<br>
reduction of the bubble size enables troublesome backmixing of the<br>
reactants in the fluidized bed to be reduced. This likewise leads to an<br>
increased selectivity of the reaction, resulting in an increase in the space-<br>
time yield of acetic acid.<br>
In a particular embodiment, especially when high ethane conversions are<br>
desired, the reaction can be carried out in a multistage fluidized-bed<br>
reactor with dedicated introduction of gas into each stage. Bubble growth<br>
commences afresh in each stage, so that the bubble size is on average<br>
smaller than in a single-stage fluidized bed. The small bubbles can also be<br>
achieved by means of internals, e.g. meshes, in the fluidized bed. To<br>
achieve high ethane conversions at the same time as a high selectivity to<br>
acetic acid, an additional divided introduction of oxygen into individual<br>
stages can be advantageous.<br>
The advantageous bubble sizes in a fluidized bed and the corresponding<br>
reaction parameters were determined from measured results obtained in<br>
investigations of the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of ethane in a fixed bed.<br>
The kinetic parameters determined therefrom for the reactions involved are<br>
summarized in fig. 1a and 1b. The catalytic gas-phase oxidation of ethane<br>
is catalyzed by two different catalytically active sites Z and X on the<br>
catalyst. Z is a site where all oxidation steps occur, namely the oxidative<br>
dehydrogenation of ethane, the partial and complete oxidations of ethene<br>
and of acetic acid. X is a position on the catalyst which becomes active<br>
only in the presence of water. The activated form of X (X-OHOH) leads to<br>
conversion of ethene into acetic acid via a mechanism similar to the<br>
Wacker reaction. The formation of acetic acid thus proceeds via two<br>
different reaction paths - via the partial oxidation of ethene at the position Z<br>
(step 2 in fig. 1a) and via a mechanism similar to the Wacker reaction at<br>
position X (step 3 in fig. 1a). The necessary kinetic values to the<br>
intermediates at the catalytically active surface in the steady state, viz. Z,<br>
Z-OH2, Z-O, Z-CH2H4, X-OHOH and X-O, were determined analytically and<br>
are given in table X.<br>
The values determined in this way were used to simulate the fluidized-bed<br>
reactor according to the bubble assemblage model (BAM) (K. Kato, C.H.<br>
Wen, Chem. Eng. Sci. 24, 1351-1368 (1969)).<br>
The model describes the fluidized bed as a two-phase system which consists<br>
of a bubble phase which is low in catalyst and a catalyst-rich emulsion phase;<br>
the two-phase structure of such a reaction mixture comprising particles in a<br>
fluidized bed with gas being passed through it can be verified with the naked<br>
eye. Since the emulsion phase contains a high proportion of solid, the<br>
catalytic reaction takes place there, while virtually no reaction takes place in<br>
the bubble phase owing to the low concentration of the catalytic material. The<br>
model of the fluidized-bed reactor therefore has to describe the transfer of<br>
reactants and products between the bubble phase and the emulsion phase<br>
and at the same time take account of the growth of the bubbles with<br>
increasing distance from the gas distributor, an effect which is well known<br>
from fluidized beds. For this reason, the fluidized bed was divided into<br>
segments with a height corresponding to the local bubble diameter. The<br>
bubble diameter, the velocity of the bubbles, the expansion of the bed and<br>
the local volume fractions of the phases were calculated by the methods of<br>
Werther (J. Werther, Chem. Eng. Sci. 47 (9-11), 2457-2462 (1992)) and<br>
Murray (J.D. Murray, J. Fluid. Mech. 21, 465 (1965)). For both bubble phase<br>
and emulsion phase, each segment was described as an ideal stirred tank.<br>
Owing to the good heat removal from fluidized-bed reactors, approximately<br>
isothermal reaction conditions can be achieved; for this reason, the reactor<br>
was regarded as isothermal for the purposes of modeling.<br>
The mass equation for the two phases is given by the following equations:<br>
Emulsion phase:<br>
The equations can be solved for each reaction component i and each<br>
segment k, for example by means of the Wegstein method. The mass<br>
transfer between the bubble phase and the emulsion phase, which is<br>
expressed by the coefficient Kbeik, can be determined quantitatively by<br>
means of a correlation of Sit and Grace (S.P., Sit, J.R. Grace, Chem. Eng.<br>
Sci. 36, 327-335 (1981)). The minimum fluidization velocity umf is derived<br>
as described in Wen et al (C. Y. Wen, Y. H. Yu, AlChE J. 12, 610 (1966)).<br>
The direct catalytic oxidation of ethane to acetic acid in a fluidized bed can<br>
be described to a good degree of accuracy by means of the model<br>
developed here.<br>
The results are shown in figs. 2 to 7. xm in the figures and tables is the<br>
modified space-time given by the quotient of catalyst mass and volume<br>
flow under the respective reaction conditions.<br>

Fig. 7 shows the conversion selectivity curves and fig. 8 the yield of acetic<br>

the points indicate the composition at the outlet of each stage (reaction<br>
conditions: T = 260°C, Ptot =16 bar, dp = 60µm, feed composition<br>
C2H6 : O2 : H2O : N2 = 40 : 16 : 20 : 32 (in the case of divided introduction<br>
of oxygen in the first stage: 40 : 3.2 : 20 : 32)).<br>
Examples<br>
The present calculations were carried out under the assumption of a<br>
reactor diameter Di of 4 m, a particle size of 60 yum or 80 µm (according to<br>
the Geldart classification A), a density of the particles of 3100 kg/m3 and a<br>
porosity of the fluidized reactor bed of 0.5 at the minimum fluidization<br>
velocity. The corresponding minimum fluidization velocity was 3.3 m/s<br>
(60 urn) or 5.85 m/s (at 80 urn). To achieve comparable fluid-dynamic<br>
conditions in the reactor in the simulation, the fluidized bed index u/umf in<br>
the reactor was kept constant at 8.0 for all simulation conditions (different<br>
temperature, different composition of the gas stream fed in) by adjusting<br>
the gas velocity at the reactor inlet accordingly in the range from 4.67 m3/s<br>
to 5.40 m3/s. As gas distributor, a nozzle plate distributor having 800<br>
orifices per m2 was assumed.<br>
In the calculation for the multistage fluidized-bed reactor without divided<br>
introduction of oxygen, each stage was modeled as an individual fluidized-<br>
bed reactor with its own gas distributor. In the case of a multistage fluidized<br>
bed with divided introduction of oxygen, the same flow of oxygen is added<br>
to the gas stream before each stage. The volume flow thus increases from<br>
stage to stage, so that the fluidized bed index increases slightly from 7.5 to<br>
8.5. The volume flow was chosen so that the fluidized bed index u/umf in<br>
the middle stage of the fluidized bed is 8.<br>
In the figures, the simulation results for an ideal isothermal fixed-bed<br>
reactor under the same conditions are given for comparison (abbreviation:<br>
PLF). The modified residence time tmod specified in the figures and in the<br>
appendix is defined as the mass of catalyst divided by the volume flow at<br>
the reactor inlet under the given reaction conditions.<br>
Example 1: Influence of the particle size<br>
Simulation calculations were carried out for two different particle diameters,<br>
viz. 60µm and 80µm. In the case of the 60µm particles, smaller bubbles<br>
having a maximum diameter of 4 cm were formed, while in the case of the<br>
80 µm particles, bubbles having a diameter of up to 12 cm are formed.<br>
The effect of better mass transfer and reduced backmixing in the case of small<br>
bubbles on the selectivities and the yield of acetic acid are shown in figures 3<br>
and 4. In addition, figures 3 and 4 show that at a bubble diameter of dB = 1<br>
cm, the achievable yields become the same as those in the fixed-bed reactor.<br>
Furthermore, the results show that at constant conversion, the selectivity to<br>
acetic acid increases with decreasing bubble sizes. In addition, when the<br>
particle diameter becomes smaller, the yield of acetic acid YHOac and also<br>
the space-time yield increase (fig. 4).<br>
The example shows that at a maximum bubble size dB of 1 cm, virtually<br>
identical results in respect of the selectivity to acetic acid and the space-time<br>
yield are obtained in the fluidized-bed reactor and the fixed-bed reactor,<br>
since at this bubble size virtually no inhibition of mass transfer between<br>
bubbles and emulsion phase occurs and, in addition, backmixing is reduced.<br>
It can thus be shown that the low selectivity and space-time yield is at least<br>
partly attributable to undesirable backmixing in the fluidized bed and to slow<br>
mass transfer between the bubble phase and emulsion phase which leads to<br>
oxygen from the bubbles only slowly getting into the emulsion phase. In<br>
addition, a high oxygen concentration in the bubbles leads to increased<br>
carbon dioxide formation as a result of unselective further oxidation of the<br>
acetic acid and thus to a reduction in the acetic acid selectivity.<br>
Example 2: Multistage fluidized-bed reactor<br>
An additional possible way of reducing the undesirable backmixing in the<br>
fluidized bed is, apart from a reduction in the particle size, the use of a<br>
multistage fluidized-bed reactor. As a result of the gas distributors at the<br>
beginning of each stage, the average bubble size over the fluidized-bed<br>
reactor is smaller than in a single-stage fluidized bed, since bubble growth<br>
starts afresh in each stage.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show the results for various multistage fluidized-bed reactors:<br>
• "3St" - 3-stage fluidized-bed reactor with 201 of catalyst/stage, height of<br>
the fluidized bed per stage = 1.04 m<br>
• "5St" - 5-stage fluidized-bed reactor with 10 t of catalyst/stage, height of<br>
the fluidized bed per stage = 0.53 m<br>
• "5St,vert" - 5-stage fluidized-bed reactor with divided introduction of<br>
oxygen and<br>
• 15 t of catalyst/stage, height of the fluidized bed per stage = 0.78 m<br>
For comparison, the results for the single-stage fluidized-bed reactor (BAM)<br>
and the ideal fixed-bed reactor (PLF) are also shown in figures 5 and 6.<br>
At low ethane conversions, ethylene is formed with significantly higher<br>
selectivity in the 5-stage fluidized bed with divided introduction of oxygen<br>
than in the other fluidized bed reactors. This is attributable to the low<br>
oxygen concentration. In contrast, at higher ethane conversions, the<br>
differences in the selectivities between the various fluidized-bed reactors<br>
are low, (
reactor of SHOac = 72.2 % is obtained in the 5-stage fluidized bed with<br>
divided introduction of oxygen (at XC2H6= 8.6 %). At the same ethane<br>
conversion, the selectivity in the fixed-bed reactor is SHOac = 77.5 %.<br>
The results in figure 5 show that use of a multistage fluidized bed enables<br>
the space-time yield to be increased significantly compared to a singe-<br>
stage fluidized bed. On the other hand, the divided introduction of oxygen<br>
leads to a reduction in the space-time yield, since the lower oxygen partial<br>
pressure reduces the reaction rate compared to the other reactors.<br>
The simulation of the 5-stage fluidized-bed reactor with divided introduction of<br>
oxygen was repeated for a higher oxygen concentration which allows a higher<br>
ethane conversion and thus a higher acetic acid yield. Owing to the higher<br>
oxygen partial pressure, the reaction rate is increased. As before, the catalyst<br>
mass is 15 t/stage. The results of the simulation are shown in figures 7 and 8.<br>
In contrast to the results obtained with the low oxygen concentration<br>
(figures 5 and 6), the conversion-selectivity curves in figures 7 and 8 show<br>
more significant differences between the single-stage fluidized-bed reactor<br>
and the 5-stage fluidized-bed reactor. As a result of the divided introduction<br>
of oxygen, a significantly higher selectivity to acetic acid compared to the<br>
single-stage fluidized-bed reactor is obtained at the same ethane<br>
conversion (at Xc2H6 = 16 %: SHoac,1-st = 65.4 % or SHOac,5-st = 69.7 %). The<br>
loss of selectivity in the fluidized bed compared to the fixed bed is relatively<br>
small (SHoac,PLF = 73.6 %). As before, the space-time yield obtained with<br>
divided introduction of oxygen is reduced compared to the fixed-bed<br>
reactor; however, it is at the level of the single-stage fluidized-bed reactor.<br>
