				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relaces to a screen-printable<br>
pasce for producing a porous polymer membrane which can<br>
be used in electrochemical sensors, especially in<br>
electrochemical biosensors, for integrated preparation<br>
of, m particular, whole blood samples.<br>
Biosensors are already in use in a large number of<br>
diagnostic methods, for example in the determination of<br>
the concentration of various factors in body fluids<br>
such as blood. The aim in this connection is to have<br>
sensors which require no elaborate processing of the<br>
(blood) sample but provide a rapid result simply by<br>
applying the body fluid to a test strip. This entails a<br>
specific biochemical reaction taking place, such as,<br>
for example, the enzymatic conversion of the component<br>
to be determined, which then brings about an electron<br>
transfer between different electrodes (working and<br>
reference electrodes), and this can be determined<br>
quantitatively.<br>
The disadvantage of most of the known electrochemical<br>
biosensors is that, on application of the blood to the<br>
region provided therefor on the test strip. the<br>
biochemical reaction which takes place is influenced by<br>
other constituents-present in the blood, especially the<br>
red blood corpuscles (erythrocytes). Thus, for example,<br>
when the value3 of the hematocrit (= volume of the<br>
erythrocytes as a proportion of the total amount of<br>
blood in vol.wt.%) are high, the value measured for<br>
glucose using conventional blood glucose sensors is<br>
lower than the actual value. This adverse affect arises<br>
from the face that the erythrocytes influence, through<br>
adsorption once the reaceive layor of the hinsensor.<br>
che diffusion of glucose into the latter and to the<br>
electrode and reduce the measured signal.<br>
To solve this problem, various membranes which are put<br>
on top of the enzyme layer, which is disposed on the<br>
electrodes, of the test strip in order to keep the<br>
erythrocytes away from this layer have been proposed.<br>
Thus, for example, US patent 5.658,444 describes an<br>
erythrocyre exclusion membrane for a sensor, which<br>
consists of a water-insoluble, hydrophobic polymer, of<br>
a water-soluble hydrophilic polymer and of an<br>
erythrocyte aggregating agent and is produced by<br>
spraying onto the surface of the test strip.<br>
One disadvantage of this membrane is that the membrane<br>
pore diameter varies as a function of the spraying<br>
distance and spray pressure. In addition, the spraying<br>
on of the membrane during production of the test strip<br>
means an additional operation which is different from<br>
the production of the remainder of the test strip and<br>
is therefore elaborate, which makes the production<br>
process complicated and thus costly.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a paste for producing a porous membrane which<br>
does not have the disadvantages mentioned since it can<br>
be applied during the biosensor production process by a<br>
method which first in with the remaining procedure and<br>
is therefore cost-effective, and provides a membrane of<br>
constant pore size.<br>
This object is achieved by a paste for a porous polymer<br>
membrane as claimed in claim 1. Advantageous<br>
developments are evident from claims 2 to 18.<br>
The invention is explained below by means of the<br>
figures, where<br>
Figure l shows diagrammatically che structure of a test<br>
scrip wach che membrane of che inversion,<br>
Figure 2 shows the rheological charactersatics of the<br>
paste of the invention.<br>
Figure 3a shows an electron micrograph of a. polymer<br>
membrane with inadequately developed pore structure,<br>
Figure 3b shows an electron micrograph of the polymer<br>

structure,<br>
Figure 4 shows the results of measurement wich two<br>
biosensors, one of chem being provided with a membrane<br>
of the invention, comparing as the values of the<br>
hemacocrit increase,<br>
Figures 5a to 5d show the clinical performance on<br>
comparison of four blood glucose sensors.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the structure of a test strip with the<br>
polymer membrane of the., invention. An electrode<br>
arrangement 2 in the form of a carbon layer, which in<br>
turn is partly covered by an insulation 3, is located<br>
on a polyester support material 1. An enzyme and<br>
mediator layer 4 is disposed on che region of the<br>
electrode layer which is left free by che insulation.<br>
In the case of a blood glucose sensor, this layer<br>
comprises, for example, the enzyme glucose oxidase and<br>
che mediator Fe3T. The polymer membrane 5 of che<br>
invention is arranged above the enzyme and mediacor<br>
layer 4. The whole is covered by an adhesive layer 6<br>
and a cover sheet 7.<br>
In che mass production of biosensors, the screen<br>
princing method is used For printing the various layers<br>
such as electrode, insulating and enzyme layers. The<br>
present invention provides a membrane which can be<br>
applied with the same technique. On the one hand, this<br>
has the advantage that the same screen printing device<br>
can be used for printing the membrane and thus<br>
throughout the sensor production process, which<br>
involves enormous economic advantages m mass produc-<br>
tion. On the other hand, it is possible to produce by<br>
the screen printing method reproducibly a membrane of<br>
uniform thickness and pore size, which is not ensured<br>
with the other methods such as spmcoating, dipping or<br>
spraying.<br>
For it to be possible to apply the paste used to<br>
produce the polymer membrane by screen printing, the<br>
solvent(s) present therein for the polymer must have a<br>
boiling point which is as high as possible (above<br>
1OO°C) in order to avoid premature drying of the<br>
material in the printing machine. in. addition, the<br>
paste comprises a nonsolvent for the polymer, which<br>
acts as pore former and has a higher boiling point than<br>
the solvent(s) used.<br>
The paste must moreover have a suitable viscosity<br>
(30 000-50 000 cpi) in order to ensure uniform flow<br>
through the screen during the printing. The viscosity<br>
of the paste is preferably reduced on exposure to shear<br>
forces, as depicted in the rheological characteristics<br>
in Figure 2.<br>
The polymer preferably used in the paste of the inven-<br>
tion is cellulose acetate (50 kDa). It is preferably<br>
present in a proportion of about 8% by weight in the<br>
screen-printable paste. In addition, a farther polymer<br>
which may be present is cellulose nitrate in a<br>
proportion of up to 10% by weight.<br>
Solvents which can be used for the polymer are, for<br>
example. 1,4-dioxane (boiling point 102°C) and/or<br>
4-hydroxymethylpentanone (boiling point 165-0C) . A.<br>
preferred composition comprises 0-20% by weight, more<br>
preferably 20% by weight, of 1,4-dioxar.e and 0-'70% by<br>
weight, more preferably 56% by weight, of 4-hydroxy-<br>
methylpentanone, it being possible alternatively to<br>
replace the 4-hydroxymethylpentanone by ethyl acetate<br>
or ethylene glycol diacetate.<br>
It has emerged that long-chain alcohols with a boiling<br>
pome of &gt; 150aC are suitable as pore formers for the<br>
screen-printable membrane paste; preference is given to<br>
n-octanol. which has a boiling point of 196°C, and/or<br>
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), which has a boiling<br>
point of 1970C.<br>
The paste is somewhat more tolerant to evaporation of<br>
dioxane or. use of 2-netyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) as pore<br>
former. Moreover the cellulose acetate remains in<br>
solution longer, which extends the time during -which<br>
the paste remains in a printable state. This extended<br>
"pot life" makes it possible to produce larger batches<br>
of constant quality.<br>
The pore former should be present in a proportion of<br>
5-20% by weight, preferably 12-15% by weight.<br>
The viscosity modifiers used are, for example,<br>
hydrophilic silica xerogels or equivalent "fumed<br>
silicas", bentonite, clay, Natrosol or carbon black.<br>
They should be added in a proportion of from 1 to 10%<br>
by weight to the screen-printable paste. Preference is<br>
given to hydrophilic Cab-C-Sils (proprietary name for<br>
silica xerogels marketed by the Cabot organization).<br>
such as Cab-O-Sil M5, Cab-O-Sil H5, Cab-O-Sil LM50,<br>
Cab-O-Sil LM130, in a proportion of 4% by weight.<br>
It is also possible to add further additives such as<br>
Tween 20, Triton X, Silvet 7600 or 7280. lauryl sulfate<br>
(SDS), other detergents, and polyols such as glycerol.<br>
or hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrolidone<br>
(PVP) or vinylpyrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymers<br>
(Pvp/VA) co the paste of the invention.<br>
Addition of one or more of these additives is not<br>
obligatory for producing the membrane; however it has<br>
emerged chat chey may improve the wetting of the<br>
membrane and speed up the sensor response. Preference<br>
is given to the use of PVP/VA or PVP in a proportion of<br>
0.1% by weight in the screen-printable paste.<br>
Moreover the addition of the additives Bioterge, poly-<br>
ethyl eneimine, BSA, dextran, dicyclohexyl phthalate,<br>
gelatin, sucrose and/or biuret may improve the separa-<br>
tion of erythrocytee and plasma.<br>
It is additionally possible to add enzyme, for example<br>
glucose oxidase, even to the cellulose acetate paste so<br>
that printing of the enzyme layer can be dispensed with<br>
in the biosensor production process.<br>
After application of a uniform layer of the printing<br>
paste to a suitable substrate, the membrane is formed<br>
during the drying process. There is formation of a<br>
porous layer and not of a continuous film, because the<br>
solvents used have a lower boiling point than the pore<br>
former; the solvents evaporate correspondingly quickly<br>
and the cellulose acetate polymer precipitates in the<br>
remaining film of the pore former.<br>
However, in connection with a biosensor, it is not<br>
permissible to use just a high temperature in the<br>
drying process, because the enzymes/proteins used are<br>
denatured if the temperatures are too high. The best<br>
results were achieved in connection with a biosensor<br>
for determining glucose in whole blood with a drying<br>
temperature of about 70°C. The boiling points of the<br>
solvents and pore formers used should be selected<br>
correspondingly.<br>
A crucial factor for the pore formation is che<br>
viscosity modifier used, which forms a gel together<br>
with the pore former in order to stabilize the polymer<br>
structure. With the substances used, the gel is<br>
produced through che interaction between the OK groups<br>
of the silica xerogel and the long-chain alcohol (e.g.<br>
octanol) . The amount and the distribution of the gel<br>
produced during the drying process eventually deter-<br>
mines the size and shape of the pores which develop.<br>
Without addition of a viscosity modifier there is<br>
formation of an emulsion from the solvent and the pore<br>
former, because the pore former is unable on its own to<br>
stabilize the polymer skeleton. The result is a white,<br>
smooth and unstructured film with entrapped pore<br>
former, which does not allow lateral liquid transport.<br>
By comparison, a clear film is obtained when no pore<br>
former is used in the paste.<br>
If the amounts of viscosity modifier used are too small<br>
(
inadequately developed pore structure, as shown in<br>
Figure 3a.<br>
Sir.ce the various suitable viscosity modifiers have<br>
different surface properties, the viscosity modifier<br>
can be selected depending on the required membrane or<br>
the required biosensor. For example, with high<br>
mechanical stress, e.g. with long printing times or on<br>
printing of very thin layers with a high squeegee<br>
pressure, the Cab-O-Sil H5 is "crushed". The surface<br>
then shows microscopically sharp fracture edges which<br>
may lead to lysis of che red blood cells.<br>
This is an unwanted property for a blood glucose sensor<br>
because the basic current of the sensor is increased<br>
thereby. On che other hand, this effect can be opti-<br>
mized, and the plasma from cells be utilized directly<br>
in the sensor for the electrochemical detection. One<br>
practical example would be the examination of<br>
hemoglobin in erychrocytes. In this case, che mediator<br>
of the biosensor, e.g. potassium hexacyancferrate(III) ,<br>
reacts with the Fe(II) group of the hemoglobin,<br>
producing potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) which can be<br>
determined directly at the electrode of the biosensor.<br>
An enzyme like chat in the case of glucose<br>
determination is unnecessary in this case because the<br>
mediator reacts directly with the hemoglobin. It is<br>
possible in this way in practice to determine the value<br>
of che hematocrit for a patient with similar measuring<br>
equipment as in the monitoring of blood glucose, making<br>
the time-consuming use of capillary cubes and<br>
centrifuge unnecessary.<br>
Cab-O-Sil LM 150 consists of smaller particles than H5,<br>
which are therefore more stable and are not damaged by<br>
the mechanical stress during the printing process. This<br>
viscosity modifier is therefore most suitable for<br>
producing a membrane for blood glucose sensors.<br>
In accordance with the above statement, the difference<br>
in boiling points between solvent and pore former is,<br>
besides the stabilization of the polymer skeleton by<br>
the viscosity modifier, important for the formation of<br>
a suitable membrane. The difference should be about<br>
30°C in this case, so chat there is formation in the<br>
drying process of a film which comprises a sufficiently<br>
high concentration of pore former in which the membrane<br>
polymer can precipicace. If the boiling point differen-<br>
ces are smaller the pore former starts to evaporate<br>
before a critical ratio between solvent and pore former<br>
is reached, which brings about the precipitation of the<br>
membrane polymer.<br>
After the screen-printable paste with che composition<br>
described previously has been printed, and the solvent<br>
has evaporated, there is formation through deposition<br>
of che cellulose esters of a membrane with an average<br>
pore size of from o.l to 2 µm, 1c being possible to<br>
influence the pore size by the amount of long-chain<br>
alcohol used. An electron micrograph of the membrane is<br>
shown in Figure 3b. Since erythrocytes have an average<br>
size of 8 to 10 µm, the membrane keeps them away from<br>
the enzyme layer, while the plasma can pass through<br>
unhindered. In addition, the membrane contributes no<br>
the mechanical stability of the enzyme layer and<br>
prevents the enzyme being detached from the electrode<br>
on application of the blood sample and then no longer<br>
being available for the electrochemical reaction.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates by means of a series of measure-<br>
ments the fact that at a constant: glucose concentration<br>
the test strip provided with a membrane of the inven-<br>
tion provides, in contrast to a test strip without<br>
membrane, constant results as the values of the hema-<br>
tocrit increase, whereas the response with the test<br>
strip without membrane decreases as the erythrccyte<br>
concentration increases. Because of the increased dif-<br>
fusion barrier between the enzyme layer and the blood<br>
sample, the response overall is somewhat reduced in the<br>
case of the sensor with membrane.<br>
The invention is illustrated by means of the following<br>
examples.<br>
Production of the printing paste:<br>
In accordance with the ratios of amounts indicated in<br>
the following examples, a mixture of the solvent (e.g.<br>
hydroxymethylpenanone, dioxane) and the pore former<br>
(e.g. octanol. MPD) is produced to ensure uniform<br>
distribution of the twc substances. In the next step,<br>
ail the additives (e.g. pvp/VA) are added and<br>
dissolved, if necessary with the aid of ultrasound. The<br>
membrane polymer (cellulose actate 50 KDa) is then<br>
mixed rapidly with the -previously produced solvent<br>
until a uniform suspension results. This suspension is<br>
rolled for 48 h in a closed container until a clear gel<br>
results, and ic is possible to add the viscosity<br>
modifier (e.g. Cab-O-Sil) to this. The finished<br>
printing paste is rolled for a further 24 h m order to<br>
ensure uniform distribution of the viscosity modifier.<br>

In the comparative clinical investigations, the results<br>
of measurement with the various types of sensors were<br>
compared with the results of measurement by che<br>
reference method (YSI Model 23OC Stat Plus), and the<br>
percentage deviation was plotted against the values of<br>
che hemacocrit for the individual blood samples. The<br>
result in the ideal case is a measurement line hori-<br>
zontal to the x axis. The gradient of these measurement<br>
lines, which is shown in Table 1, provides information<br>
about che interference of che hemacocrit with the<br>
sensor system used.<br>
Table 1<br>
The data unambiguously reveal the superior performance<br>
of the sensor system with the preferred membrane (com-<br>
position of Example 4). This improvement is achieved<br>
through the separation of whole blood and plasma<br>
directly in front of the electrode, because the Nernsc<br>
diffusion layer in front of the electrode can no longer<br>
be extended into the region with erythrocyces and<br>
therefore also can no longer be influenced by different<br>
values of che hematocric.<br>

pastes in which there is no suitable accordance between<br>

PVP/VA 0.1% by weight<br>
In Comparative Example l there is no formation of a<br>
porous membrane because the difference between the<br>
boiling points of the solvent (ethylene glycol<br>
diacetate) and pore former (n-octanol) used in che<br>
printing paste is too small. If, by contrast, n-decanol<br>
is used as pore former (as described in Example l) . a<br>
porous membrane is obtained after the drying process<br>
because the boiling point between the solvent and the<br>
pore former is sufficiently large.<br>
In Comparative Example 2 there is only inadequate gel<br>
formation between the pore former and the viscosity<br>
modifier, because of the use of hydrophobic Cab-O-Sil<br>
which is unable to react with the CH groups of the pore<br>
former, and thus there is inadequate stabilization of<br>
the polymer skeleton. This impedes the formation of a<br>
porous membrane.<br>
No porous membrane is formed in Comparative Example 3<br>
either, where the solubility of the polymer' used<br>
(cellulose acetate propionate) in che pore former is<br>
coo high.<br>
