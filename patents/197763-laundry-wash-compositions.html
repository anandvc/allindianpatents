COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
LAUNDRY WASH COMPOSITIONS<br><br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra,  India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
C4031(C)<br>
	LAUNDRY WASH COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br><br>
The present invention relates to compositions for the washing of laundry fabrics, the<br>
compositions containing anionic surfactants.<br>
    Background of the Invention<br>
Compositions for the washing of laundry items traditionally contain one or more surfactants as well as other components. The most common class of surfactant in such compositions comprises the anionic surfactants, especially synthetic non-soap anionics      Often, one or more such anionic surfactants are used together in a blend with one or more nonionic surfactants. Further, although anionic and cationic surfactants are often incompatible, due to the their tendency to form a complex, recently, there have been several proposals to utilise certain compatible anionic and cationic surfactant combinations in laundry wash products.<br><br>
Nevertheless, there is still a need to find surfactant systems based on anionic surfactant which give better removal of oily/greasy soil from cotton fabrics. The present invention solves this problem by incorporation of certain cationic polymers (as defined hereinbelow). One preferred such polymer is a dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride<br>
     polymer (poly-DMDAAC). Previously, cationic polymers in general have been used in a wide range of household cleaning and personal wash applications.<br><br><br>
C4031(C)<br>
For example, cationic polymers have been widely used in dishwasher rinse aid products. For example, it is known from EP-A-0 167 382, EP-A-0 342 997 and DE-A-26 16 404 to mix cationic polymers with surfactant in such product, in order to obtain clean surfaces as free from streaks as possible.<br><br>
EP-A-0 167 382 describes liquid detergent compositions which can contain cationic polymers as thickeners. Hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium guar, copolymers of aminoethylmethacrylate and acrylamide, and copolymers of DMDAAC and acrylamide are described as particularly suitable cationic polymers.<br><br>
DE-A-26 16 404 describes cleaning preparations for glass and, containing cationic cellulose derivatives. These materials are said to give better drainage of water, to produce clean, streak-free glass.<br>
     WO-A-97/09408 discloses use of cationic polymers selected from cationic polymers of copolymers of monomers such as trialkyl ammonium alkyl(meth)acrylate or -acrylamide, DMDAAC and with other counter-ions; polymer-like reaction products of ethers or esters of polysaccharides with ammonium side groups, in particular guar, cellulose and starch derivatives; polyadducts of ethylene oxide with ammonium groups;<br>
         quaternary ethylene imine polymers and polyesters and polyamides with quaternary side groups as soil-release compounds in dishwasher rinse aids.<br>
Cationic polymers are also usable in hard surface cleaners. For example, EP-A-0 467 472 describes e.g. cleaning preparations for hard surfaces, containing cationic      homopolymers and/or copolymers as soil-release polymers. These polymers comprise quaternised ammonium alkyl-methacrylate groups as monomer units. These compounds are used in order to render the surfaces such that the soil can be removed more easily during the next cleaning process.<br>
         EP-A-0 342 997 describes all-purpose cleaners which can contain cationic polymers, wherein in particular polymers with imino groups are used.<br><br>
  C4031 (C)<br>
Another known use of such polymers is in hair shampoos. WO 97/42281 discloses compositions containing sugar-based nonionic surfactants and copolymers of acrylamide and DMDAAC to improve the tactile properties of such surfactants. Use in dishwashing applications is also mentioned.<br><br>
In laundry washing/rinsing applications, several uses for cationic polymers have been proposed. Thus, JP-A-04 153300 discloses use of poly-DMDAAC in compositions containing cationic/amphoteric surfactants to enhance softness in the washing of delicate items.<br><br>
Use of poly-DMDAAC as a greying-inhibitor in laundry products in disclosed in DD-A-296 307. The surfactant in these compositions is all nonionic.<br>
JP-A-62 018500 discloses laundry detergent creams based on soap blends and          cationic polymers such as poly-DMDAAC.<br>
There is also a very large number of prior disclosures of cationic polymers used as dye fixers in laundry cleaning products, i.e. as materials for reducing the amount of dye released from fabrics, have been described in a number of references. For example,          EP-A-0 462 806 describes use of such materials in rinse phase products to give<br>
protection against dye transfer during subsequent washes. Although non-soap anionic surfactant is speculatively mentioned as one optional ingredient in the product, all of the preferred product forms and specific examples thereof, either contain no surfactant or else cationic surfactant.<br><br>
JP-A-07 316590 discloses detergent compositions containing cationic polymers, including poly-DMDAAC for anti-dye transfer and/or anti-soil redeposition aids. These compositions are typically bends of anionic and nonionic surfactants. In one example, detergent composition contains 25% by weight of anionic surfactant, and 25% of zeolite<br>
         builder. Although sodium carbonate is also included, sodium carbonate in the absence of calcite as a crystal seed material does not contribute to calcium binding and therefore, cannot be regarded as a builder, but rather, as a pH buffer. The composition as disclosed does not contain calcite. Of the anionic surfactant, 10% by weight (based<br><br>
 C4031 (C)<br>
on the weight of the total composition) is linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS). In the wash liquor 10% by weight of the detergent composition of a polymer of DMDAAC is added on top. The mole ratio of anionic surfactant to total cationic units in the polymer can be calculated to be substantially 0.88 : 1. Moreover, there is no disclosure of using      such a polymer to assist removal of oily/greasy stains.<br>
The structure and composition of an aqueous solution of a pure laboratory grade (non-branched) primary alkyl sulphate anionic surfactant namely sodium dodecyl sulphate, in the presence of poly-DMDAAC, at the air-water interface, has been described in a          number of references, namely J. Penfold et al, Langmuir 1995, 11, 2496-2503, J. Penfold et al, Colloids and Surfaces A, 1997, 128, 107-117, A. Creeth et al, J. Chem. Soc, Faraday Trans., 92, 4, 589-594, and L. Yingjie et al, Langmuir 1995, ■/■/, 2486-2492. A wide range of model compositions to explore these phenomena are disclosed in these references.<br><br>
GB-A-2 323 385 discloses detergent compositions with a cationic dye-fixing ingredient. A small number of examples contains poly-DMDAAC with a molecular weight in the range 2,000 to 20,000, as a cationic dye fixing agent.<br>
       The present inventors have now found that certain polymers containing DMDAAC and its analogues can be combined with anionic surfactant and detergency builder to enhance oily/greasy soil removal from cotton fabrics. However, none of the aforementioned reference discloses this novel use, a total anionic builder ratio of from 2:1 to 10:1, nor a LAS : builder weight ratio in the range from 1 : 1 to 7 : 1.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
Thus, a first aspect of the invention now provides a laundry washing composition comprising:-<br>
(a)       anionic surfactant comprising at least one surfactant compound of formula (I):<br><br>

(CO)-O-R6,<br>

are independently absent, or represent C^ alkyl groups;<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen, C13 alkyl, C13 alkenyl, hydroxy-C13 alkyl and C^ cycloalkyl groups; and<br>

(b)	a detergency enhancing polymer of formula (II) as hereinabove defined;<br>
(c)	detergency builder; and<br>
	(d)       optionally, one or more other ingredients;<br>
wherein the weight ratio of total anionic surfactant to builder is from 2:1 to 10:1, preferably from 3:1 to 7:1.<br>
     We may also claim any composition embodying both the first and second aspects of the invention.<br>
     Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Compositions according to the present invention contain the anionic surfactant, the polymer in the amount specified and optionally one or more other ingredients. As<br><br><br>
C4031 (C)<br>
demonstrated in the examples, the polymer has been found to enhance the detergency of the anionic cotton in removal of oil/greasy stains from cotton fabrics.<br>
More specifically, it has now been found that fatty/oily soil removal is especially         effective if not only does the anionic surfactant contain at least some branched anionic surfactant but also if the amount of anionic surfactant relative to cationic monomer units in the polymer is higher than in the compositions where such polymers have been used for dye fixation or other purposes. Without being bound by any particular theory or explanation, it is believed that this is because the branched anionic surfactant mitigates<br>
      against the formation of liquid crystalline phases at the soil/wash liquor interface.<br>
Moreover only relatively small amounts of total anionic surfactant-polymer complex are needed to exert the effect, leaving the remainder of the anionic free to assist other cleaning functions in the wash liquor. The use of builder prevents calcium ions from competing with the polymer for complexing with the anionic.<br><br>
Therefore, adequate building is necessary to reduce water hardness to allow the LAS-polymer complex to reduce surface tension sufficiently at the oil-water interface.<br>
         Component (c) in compositions according to the invention stipulates optionally, one or more other ingredients. In other words, these other ingredients do not have to be present. Preferably however, compositions according to the invention contain one or more other ingredients typically found in laundry wash products. Preferably, these are selected from one or more of surfactants (other than the anionic surfactant), builders,<br>
     bleaches, enzymes and minor ingredients.<br>
The Polymer<br><br>
The detergency enhancing polymer can be a homopolymer or copolymer. Random, block and mixed block/random copolymers are all possible. The polymer may comprise one or more polymers which include at least one monomer of formula (II).<br><br>
C4031 (C)<br>
Preferably, the monomer units of formula (I) are those where A is methylene (-CH2-) or carbonyl (-CO-) and R4 is methylene (-CH2-) or ethylene (-CH2CH2-).<br>
5     Especially preferred are polymers containing at least some monomer units of formula (I) in which A is methylene, R1 and R2 are methyl, and R3 and R4 together represent<br>
-(CH-)-CH2-, i.e. DMDAAC. Preferably at least 50% of the monomer units of formula (I), more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, most preferably substantially 100% are DMDAAC units.<br>
10     For the avoidance of doubt, it should be noted that the DMDAAC unit can also exist in the polymer in the form<br><br>
i.e. where the second allyl group remains unsaturated and does not form a ring closing bridging group constituted by groups R3 and R4 of formula (I). The double bond of this<br>
     allyl group can also cross-link with other polymers in the sample and it can also form block co-polymers comprising the monomer unit -CH2-CH2-CH2-(CH3)2 N+-CH2-CH2-CH2-. Thus, polymers formed of monomer units of formula (I) in which any of R1-R3 is/are alkenyl groups may contain monomers with any one or more of the aforementioned structural transformations, including ring-closures, cross linking, block<br>
         co-polymer formations, as well as the unpolymerised terminal unsaturated groups.<br><br><br>
C4031 (C)<br>
Thus, for example, where R2 and R4 together form a linking group R5 by virtue of breakage of a double bond when R2 is CM alkenyl, the resultant monomer unit may be represented thus:-<br><br><br><br>
For the example of the DMDAAC monomer unit mentioned above, the corresponding cyclic structure would therefore be:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the case of copolymers, a wide range of other monomer units may be used, for example selected from those derived from unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid and the like, and their esters and salts, olefins such as ethylene, propylene and butene, alkyl esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids such as methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, methylmethacrylate, their hydroxy derivatives such as 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, unsaturated aromatic compounds such as styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl styrene, and heterocyclic compounds such as vinylpyrrolidone. However, most preferred are -CH2-CH2- co-monomer units.<br><br>
 C4031 (C)<br>
The monomer units of formula (I) are cationic. Optionally one or more other cationic monomer units may also be incorporated. For example, these may be chosen from any other cationic monomer unit structures disclosed in JP-A-07 316 590.<br>
       Preferably, the proportion of all cationic monomer units is from 40 mol % to 95 mol %, in order for the polymers to have adequate water-solubility.<br>
It is preferred that the weight average molecular weight of the polymer is from 320 to 10,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 500,000, most preferably from 50,000 to          150,000. This weight average molecular weight is typically determined by the method of laser light scattering in combination with gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
Generally speaking, the amount of polymers in the composition will usually be from 0.05% to 10% by weight, although from 0.1% to 5% will be typical.<br><br>
In all of formulae (I) to (IV) counter anions X- may be the same of different and may<br>
include mixtures of such anions. They may for example be halide ions such as chloride<br>
or bromide, S042- or CH3S04~.<br><br>
Synthesis of the Polymer<br>
Many polymers based on DMDAAC and analogous monomer units are commercially available. However, formula (I) also embraces monomer units, polymers of which<br>
        cannot be obtained commercially. The detergency enhancing polymers utilised in the present invention may be obtained from polymerisation of respective monomers corresponding to the monomer unit of formula (I), optionally other cationic monomer units and optionally, any other, e.g. neutral (uncharged), monomer units, each respectively being ethylenically unsaturated. The different available means of<br>
         copolymerising such ethylenically unsaturated monomers will be well known to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry. Depending on the order of addition of reactants, the resulting polymers may be block, random or mixed block/random copolymers.<br><br><br>
C4031(C)<br>
Surfactants<br>
Compositions according to the invention comprise one or more surfactants at least one         of which is an anionic surfactant. In the case of the first aspect of the invention, it must contain at least some branched anionic surfactant.<br>
Where other surfactants are included in a blend with the anionic surfactant(s), these may be chosen from one or more of cationic, nonionic amphoteric and zwitterionic         surface-active compounds and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surface-active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
       The total level of all surfactant(s) in the composition as a whole may for example be from 0.1% to 70% by weight the total composition but is preferably from 5% to 40%.<br>
The Anionic Surfactant <br>
The branched anionic surfactant of formula (I) is an essential component of compositions according to the first aspect present intention. However, in general, the anionic surfactant in compositions according to the present invention may comprise         one or more soap and non-soap anionic surfactant materials e.g. selected from one or more of the types disclosed in the aforementioned reference of Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
For either aspect of the invention, the mole ratio of all anionic surfactant to the total of         cationic monomer units in the detergency enhancing polymer is preferably at least 1:1, more preferably at least 2.5:1, still more preferably from 25 : 1 to 2.5 :1, yet more preferably from 20 : 1 to 3 : 1, especially from 10 : 1 to 5 : 1.<br><br>
 C4031(C)<br>
The compositions according to the second aspect of the present invention preferably contain at least some branched material of formula (II).<br>
      In formula (II), R1 is a branched group selected from branched alkyl, alkylaryl (e.g. alkylbenzene or alkylnaphthyl) and alkenyl groups most preferably having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms in the aliphatic part thereof.<br>
Preferably also, Z' represents a sulphate, sulphonate, carboxylate or phosphonate          group, any at which is optionally linked to R1 via a linking moiety, such as a (poly) C2-4 alkyleneoxy moiety, forming part of Z\ In the latter example (when present) preferably there may for example be from 1 to 7 alkyleneoxy groups (which may be the same or different) and which are preferably selected from alkyleneoxy and/or propyleneoxy groups.<br><br>
As all or part (e.g at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% by weight) of the branched anionic surfactant component, most preferred are the linear alkylbenzene sulphonate anionic surfactants having an average alkyl component of C8-C15, especially those having a V-shaped hydrophobe group R1, i.e. branching at the point of<br>
         attachment to the benzene sulphonate group but each arm of the V is linear.<br>
Commercial products contain a mixture of different chain lengths for each arm length. Paradoxically, such V- branched materials are sometimes referred to as "linear" alkylbenzene sulphonates.<br>
        Typically, the branched anionic surfactant represents from 30% to 100% by weight of the total anionic surfactant preferably from 40% to 70%. It is also preferred if the level of branched anionic surfactant is from 0.5 wt% to 30 wt%, more preferably 1 wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 20 wt% of the total composition.<br>
        Another preferred class of branched anionic surfactant comprises those disclosed in WO-A-99/19428 in which R1 is attached to the Z' moiety via a group -Rx- (wherein Rx is absent or is a linking group such as phenylene), R1 being a hydrophobic mid-chain branched alkyl moiety, having in total 9 to 22 carbons in the moiety, preferably from 12<br><br><br>
C4031(C)<br>
to about 18, having: (1) a longest linear carbon chain attached to the -Rx-Z - moiety in the range of from 8 to 21 carbon atoms; (2) one or more C1 - C3 alkyl moieties branching from this longest linear carbon chain; (3) at least one of the branching alkyl moieties is attached directly to a carbon of the longest linear carbon chain at a position       within the range of the position 2 carbon, counting from position 1 carbon (#1) which is attached to the -Rx-Z' moiety, to the position of the terminal carbon minus 2 carbons, (the (co - 2) carbon); and (4) when more than one of these compounds is present, the average total number of carbon atoms in the R1-Rx- moieties in the above formula is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 18, preferably from about 15 to about 17.       Preferred R1 groups as defined in WO-A-99/19428 are branched primary alkyl moieties having the formula:<br>
R	Ra	Rb<br>
CH3CH2(CH2)wCH(CH2)xCH(CH2)yCH(CH2)z-Rx-<br>
wherein the total number of carbon atoms in the branched primary alkyl moiety of this 15     formula (including the R, Ra, and Rb branching) is from 13 to 19; R, Rx is as<br>
hereinbefore defined Ra, and Rb are each independently selected from hydrogen and C-1C3 alkyl (preferably methyl), provided R, Ra, and Rb are not all hydrogen and, when z is 0, at least R or Ra is not hydrogen; w is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer from 0 to 13; and w + x + y + zis from 20     7 to 13.<br>
Yet other suitable branched anionic surfactants include secondary alkylsulphonat.es, secondary alcohol sulphates and secondary alkyl carboxylates.<br>
25     The compositions of the invention may additionally contain one or more other anionic surfactants in total amounts corresponding to percentages quoted above for alkyl benzene sulphonates. Suitable anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art. These include primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, particularly C8-C15 primary<br><br><br>
