				<td>System for processing documents of value<br>
[001] The invention relates to a system for processing documents of value, such as bank notes or checks, in particular for the quality check of newly manufactured bank<br>
notes.<br>
[002] When manufacturing bank notes the security paper provided with all security features is printed in sheets and then usually cut into single copies. The freshly printed bank notes such produced subsequently are checked in order to ensure that the bank notes meet all requirements as to their state and e.g. the print is of a satisfactory quality. The successfully checked bank notes then are stacked in predetermined quantities, strapped and packaged, before being put into circulation for the first time by the respective central banks.<br>
[003] For this purpose the freshly printed bank notes usually uninterruptedly stacked according to their serial numbers are inputted in a bank note sorting apparatus, as e.g. described in the applicant's DE 1 0225 705 Al and in which e.g. the printed image of the bank notes is checked and the bank notes found to be acceptable are outputted in bundles of 100 pieces to the various storage pockets, subsequently strapped and a plurality of bundles are packed up and packaged, such as shrink-wrapped. The bank notes found to be unacceptable, so-called unfit bank notes, such as e.g. bank notes the printed image of which is faulty, are separately collected and destroyed. In addition, in the bank note sorting apparatus so-called reject bank notes can be sorted out. which cannot be suitably judged, e.g. because of multiple picks from the singler.<br>
[004] Many countries require that the freshly printed bank notes when delivered to the central banks have to meet certain criteria as to the serial number sequence within the bank note packets. One criterion required for stacking is e.g. that all bank notes of a stack of bank notes, which in the following is also referred to as a deposit, have to be present in a sequence of uninterrupted serial numbers or at least the serial number of the topmost bank note of each packet shall begin with the last digit ,,0 P.<br><br>
2<br>
[005] But if during the above-mentioned quality check certain bank notes were sorted out, their serial numbers are missing in the deposit, so that these bank notes have to be replaced by hand. This leads to a time-intensive postprocessing of the banknote stack.<br>
[006] It is now the problem of the present invention to permit the effective provision of value document stacks according to predetermined requirements, in particular as to the serial number sequence.<br>
[007] This problem is solved by the independent claims. The dependent claims describe preferred embodiments.<br>
[008] Though other documents of value such as checks can also be processed with the aid of the system according to the invention, the present invention first of all is particularly suitably adapted to process bank notes. Therefore, in the following by way of example only the processing of bank notes is dealt with.<br>
[009] The invention is based on the idea to provide devices for postprocessing those bank notes or other documents of value checked by a checking apparatus, which do not meet the predetermined stacking criteria, the stacking criteria in particular relating to the quantity and/ or serial numbers of the stacked bank notes. These devices e.g. may insert replacement documents, such as separator cards or replacement bank notes into the stack of the bank notes to be postprocessed. These devices can either be constituent part of the checking apparatus, in order to permit an automatic postprocessing of faulty bank note stacks, or e.g. can be integrated in a separate apparatus, where the bank notes to be postprocessed that have been checked and stacked by the checking apparatus are postprocessed. The postprocessing here is automatically supported with the aid of respective apparatuses or is effected fully automatic, so that the results are saving of time and costs and in particular a higher security since this postprocessing ensues less errors and fraud possibilities caused by manual actions.<br>
[0010] Further advantages of the invention are explained in the following with reference to the accompanying Figures.<br><br>

4<br>
[0022] It shall be especially emphasized that the features of the dependent claims and the embodiments described in the description can be advantageously used in combination but also completely or at least partially independent of each other and of the subject matter of the main claims.<br>
[0023] With reference to Figure 1 now a first embodiment of a system according to the invention for quality-checking and subsequently postprocessing freshly printed bank notes already cut into single copies is explained. A system within the present invention means both the relevant apparatuses and the pertinent methods for using said apparatuses.<br>
[0024] In the bank note printing house or in the central bank the freshly manufactured<br>
bank notes BN are checked once again in a bank note checking apparatus 1 before they are brought into circulation for the first time. Specifically, the individual bank notes BN are inputted in a stacked form and in an uninterrupted sequence of serial numbers into an input pocket 2 of the bank note checking apparatus 1. After singling by a singler 3 the bank notes are checked as to their state in a checking device 4, by carrying out e.g. an electrical, magnetic or optical check in particular an optical check of the printed image, in order to check e.g. the adequate position and quality of the printed image of the bank notes BN. If there cannot be completely excluded that forgeries were fraudulently smuggled into the freshly printed bank-note stack BN to be checked, additionally an authentication test can be carried out in checking device 4.<br>
[0025] The bank notes such checked then are sorted and outputted. All reject-bank notes, which e.g. could not be checked because of double picks, are stored in the output pocket 5. The other output pockets 6 serve for receiving the checked bank notes BN found to be acceptable, the so-called fit bank notes. The checked bank notes that have been found to be unacceptable e.g. because of defects in the printed image, the so-called unfit bank notes, preferably are stacked separately from the fit bank notes in a different output pocket, preferably also separated from the reject bank notes, in order to be subsequently destroyed.<br><br>
5<br>
[0026] But it is also possible that the unfit bank notes are stacked together with the fit<br>
bank notes in a common output pocket 6. Then data is stored in a computer-aided control device 8, which either is a constituent part of the bank note checking apparatus 1 or an external component, that renders information about which bank notes BN in the relevant output pocket 6 have been found to be fit and/or unfit bank notes by the checking device 4. This can be effected e.g. by indicating the position of the respective fit or unfit bank notes in the stack, such as a statement that the 5th, 13th and 37th bank note in the stack is an unfit bank note, or by reading e.g. the serial numbers of the respective bank notes BN in checking device 4 and producing for example data in control device 8 that indicate or permit a conclusion as to which bank notes in the stack are fit or unfit bank notes or after which fit bank note follows an unfit bank note. Preferably, the serial numbers of the fit bank notes are indicated, since with unfit bank notes there can often occur errors when reading the serial numbers. As explained in more detail in the following the unfit bank notes of the stack can be especially marked. Therefore, e.g. in the mentioned embodiment, it is possible to provide only one single output pocket, if the data on the categorization of the checked bank notes is made available otherwise.<br>
[0027] In output pockets 6, either a predetermined number of bank notes, such as e.g. 100 bank notes of the predetermined checking category, are stacked, or preferably all those bank notes of a predetermined quantity located in the input pocket, of e.g. again 100 bank notes BN, which have been associated to the respective predetermined category for this stacker (reject, unfit, fit). This can even be less than the number of 100 bank notes input before, because some of the 100 bank notes of the input pocket may have been sorted into other stackers because they are reject or unfit bank notes. For simplicity's sake both cases are referred to as "deposit" in the following.<br>
[0028] The bank notes outputted to the output pockets 5 to 6 are loosely stacked and still unstrapped. Those bank-note stacks, i.e. deposits with fit bank notes that because of reject and/or unfit bank notes have to be postprocessed, because they do not<br><br>
6<br>
meet the predetermined stacking criteria of the deposit, subsequently are removed by hand or automatically from the output pocket 6 of the bank note checking apparatus 1 and are transfered to a separate buffer path for postprocessing, such as e.g. onto a conveyor line 9, by e.g. inserting them in a bin 10 which is located on the conveyor line and adapted for one deposit or a plurality of deposits separated from each other.<br>
[0029] It can be provided that deposits exclusively containing fit and no unfit bank notes are also transfered onto the conveyor line 9 or are processed in another way. Here it can also be provided, that these deposits not to be postprocessed are strapped directly in bank note checking apparatus 1 or in a separate unit. The stacking criteria can be e.g. that each deposit has to contain 100 bank notes in a sequence of uninterrupted serial numbers.<br>
[0030] As to facilitate a later postprocessing of the deposits located in bin 10, e.g. in<br>
control device 8 data can be generated which links bin 10 to the deposits contained therein.<br>
[0031] At a postprocessing place 12 associated to the bank note checking apparatus 1 an operator removes the bin 10 containing the deposits to be postprocessed and transported thereto by the conveyor line 9. Subsequently, the operator, depending on the guidelines of the central banks responsible, removes the bank notes to be sorted out and inserts the necessary replacement bank notes, in order to e.g. provide a bundle with a sequence of predetermined serial numbers and predetermined quantity of fit bank notes.<br>
[0032] These replacement bank notes can be bank notes having predetermined serial numbers reserved for the replacement bank notes, which not necessarily have to match the serial numbers of the missing or reject or unfit bank notes to be replaced. Preferably, these are provided directly at the postprocessing place 12 for being sorted in.<br>
[0033] Alternatively, there can also be provided that the bank notes will be postproduced with a desired serial number corresponding to the serial numbers of the banknotes<br><br>
7<br>
to be sorted out from the bundles to be postprocessed or already sorted out in the bank note checking apparatus 1. Preferably, for this purpose unnumbered bank notes, which have already been completed except for the serial number and preferably have already been visually checked by a person or by machine as to their quality, are subsequently printed on the spot by a printing apparatus 14 with the respective serial numbers of the bank notes to be sorted out or already sorted out for the deposit that actually or subsequently has to be processed at the postprocessing place 12. At the postprocessing place 12 then the postprinted replacement bank notes are inserted at the right position in the stack.<br>
[0034] The data of the bank notes to be postproduced and/or to be sorted out and/or to be sorted in, preferably are automatically transmitted to the printing apparatus 14 or the postprocessing place 12. The data are transmitted by the control device 8 e.g. in a digital form wireless by radio.<br>
[0035] After the replacement bank notes being inserted into the postprocessed deposits, the bundles are strapped in a strapper 15 and optionally a plurality of strapped bundles are packaged, such as e.g. shrink-wrapped. The strapped and packaged bundles then can again be put on the conveyor line 9 for further processing. Figure 1 depicts by example that the strapped bank-note bundles 7 in the bin 10 again are put on the conveyor line for being transported further.<br>
[0036] But it is also possible, that in particular in case the deposits not to be postprocessed are also put on the conveyor line 9 in an unstrapped fashion, these deposits are strapped and/or packaged later together with the postprocessed bundles.<br>
[0037] There can further be provided, that the bank notes to be postprocessed first are collected and stored before they are postprocessed e.g. in the above described fashion at any later point of time to be determined.<br>
[0038] It is of particular advantage in all mentioned embodiments, when the bank notes are provided in a loose fashion before the postprocessing, i.e. unstrapped and unpackaged, and are not strapped or packaged until after the postprocessing. With that an especially effective and not very labor-intensive postprocessing is possible.<br><br>
8<br>
[0039] Alternative to the embodiment according to Figure 1 it can also be provided that there are a plurality of bank note checking apparatuses 1 with each having a postprocessing place 12 or that there are a plurality of postprocessing places 12 associated to one bank note checking apparatus 1, of which two are shown in Figure 2 by way of example that can be designed analogous to the postprocessing place 12 of Figure 1. With that the throughput rate can be decisively increased when checking the freshly printed bank notes, because the bank note checking apparatuses 1 mostly operating with very high speeds of more than 2000 bank notes per minute do not have to be stopped so often until the respective postprocessing is completed.<br>
[0040] In this case the replacement bank notes with the desired serial numbers can be postproduced at one central printing apparatus 14 associated to a plurality of postprocessing places 12 based on the data supplied by the control device 8, and then be associated to the respective postprocessing places 12 and/or the respective deposits and supplied to them.<br>
[0041] Sorting out reject and/or unfit bank notes to be sorted out and/or sorting in<br>
replacement bank notes may not only be effected by hand, but can also be effected in a half or fully automatic fashion.<br>
[0042] E.g. according to the embodiment of Figure 3 it is possible, that at the<br>
postprocessing place 12 a further bank note processing device 20 is provided, which is connected to the bank note checking apparatus 1 preferably e.g. via a wired or preferred via a wireless data line 26.<br>
[0043] Specifically, at postprocessing place 12 can be provided e.g. a counting device with only one output pocket 23. Into input pocket 21 of said counting device the operator inputs all bank notes of a deposit 11 to be postprocessed. The bank notes from input pocket 21 then are singled and transported through checking unit 22, which at least counts the bank notes of the inputted bundle and then stores said bank notes in output pocket 23 in a stacked fashion. Based on the data transmitted by the bank note checking apparatus 1 and associated to the respective deposit the<br><br>
9<br>
stacking of the bank notes into the single output pocket 23 is stopped, when a bank note to be sorted out has just been stored in output pocket 23 and/ or when a replacement bank note to be inserted is to be laid on the bank note which has been stacked last in the output pocket 23. After having removed, inserted or replaced the respective bank note, the singling-, counting- and stacking process will be restarted, e.g. upon a manual input, and if necessary will be stopped again later, if further bank notes are to be inserted and/or replaced at different positions of the stack.<br>
|0044] As mentioned, to counting device 20 data are transmitted, which indicate or permit the conclusion as to which bank notes and/ or at which positions in the stack bank notes shall be sorted in or out. If in the counting device a serial number reader is integrated, said data can also be e.g. the serial numbers of the bank notes which shall be replaced, or the serial numbers of the bank notes after which a following bank note shall be replaced.<br>
[0045] By using the counting device the positions at which bank notes shall be sorted in and/or out during postprocessing can be found faster and the finding-process is substantially less error-prone.<br>
[0046] Figure 4 shows a further embodiment. The bank note checking apparatus 1<br>
according to this embodiment has devices for marking the positions in the stack, at which bank notes shall be sorted in and/or out during postprocessing. Especially, e.g. marking elements such as separator cards TK can be inserted between the bank notes to be postprocessed. The marking elements preferably have a different strength and/or form and/or color than the bank notes, so that they can be better distinguished from these. The separator cards TK can have extensions, which protrude beyond the usual bank note format. Thereby can be ensured that banknote bundles marked with separator cards TK can be immediately recognized as marked both by machine and by hand.<br>
[0047] The bank notes inputted in input pocket 2 and singled by singler 3 separately pass through checking device 4. If a bank note has been categorized as a not judgeable<br><br>
10<br>
reject-bank note by the checking device 4, it is transfered out of the bank note stream 13 and is outputted to an output pocket 5 meant for reject-bank notes. In such a case via a diverter 34 a separator card TK is synchronously transferred into the so caused gap in the bank note stream. With that every thinkable gap can be dynamically closed, even when a plurality of gaps occur immediately one after the other. In this case preferably a plurality of separator cards are transferred successively into the bank note stream, preferably one per missing bank note.<br>
[0048] It is possible, that the marking elements provided in a stacked fashion are singled and transferred not until a gap in the bank not stream has to be filled. As to be able to transfer a marking element to the adequate position in the bank note stream even with high speeds, alternatively a separator card circuit 30 can be used, such as shown in Figure 4. For that a sufficiently large number of separator cards TK will be provided in an input pocket 31, from which the separator cards TK then are continuously singled, are held in a transport-synchronous circuit with the aid of a belt transport system 36, and subsequently are stacked back with the aid of a stacking wheel 37 into the input pocket 31 of the singler.<br>
[0049] When a gap in the bank not stream has to be filled, a separator card TK is<br>
transferred out of the separator card circuit with the aid of a diverter 35 and via the diverter 34 is synchronously transferred into the gap of the bank note stream 13. At the diverter place a switchable mechanic diverter can be provided. As to enable a faster transfer without the necessity of switching the diverter, a stationary, not switchable diverter element can be used, that diverts the separator cards TK at the diverter 34 in the direction of bank note stream 13 connected thereto.<br>
[0050] The thus completed bank note stream of a deposit then is stacked in one of preferably more output pockets 6, which are alternately filled with deposits.<br>
[0051] For postprocessing the bundle the separator cards TK can also be provided with data on the bank notes to be sorted in and/or out, such as e.g. the serial number of the bank note to be inserted can be written on, in order to facilitate inserting by hand. But the separator cards can also have only an identification key, such as an<br><br>
11<br>
individual bar code and the data on the bank notes to be sorted in and/or out are associated to the respective bar code in a data base.<br>
[0052] While the above describes the case, that for marking bank notes to be replaced<br>
either marking elements are inserted in the stack and/or data on these bank notes to be replaced are generated that in the following are used for postprocessing, the reject and/or unfit bank notes to be sorted out can also be marked themselves. By this means an automatic or manual recognition of said bank notes during postprocessing the respective deposits is facilitated. For this purpose e.g. a method as described in WO 01/85457 Al can be used. But preferably markings are applied onto the bank note paper by printing or spraying them e.g. with clearly visible ink, the markings occupying an area of 1 cm2, especially preferred 5 cm2 of the total area of one side of a bank note. Such clearly visible markings additionally facilitate the postprocessing.<br>
[0053] If the bundles to be postprocessed are to be strapped at last, alternatively or additionally it is also conceivable to adequately label or mark the strap of the bundle concerned.<br>
[0054] A fundamental advantage of the described system is that the normal checking<br>
process in the bank note checking apparatus 1 is not interrupted and thus does not negatively affect the throughput.<br>
[0055] Filling the gaps true to sequential numbering by replacing the separator card TK or marked bank notes by a replacement bank note accordingly numbered can be performed at a workstation outside the apparatus either by machine or by hand.<br>
[0056] Figure 5 shows the embodiment of a semiautomatic postprocessing of marked deposits with the aid of a separate postprocessing apparatus 60.<br>
[0057] All bank notes of a deposit to be postprocessed are inputted in an input pocket 61 of the postprocessing apparatus 60, the said deposits being provided with separator cards e.g. with the aid of the separator card circuit 30 of Figure 4. As already mentioned, at those positions in the stack marked by the separator cards either<br><br>
12<br>
bank notes are to be inserted in particular immediately after the separator card and/or the following bank notes are to be replaced. After being singled by the singler 62 and having passed through a checking device 63 for recognizing the separator cards TK, which is able to distinguish between bank notes BN and separator cards TK e.g. by optical measuring, the separator cards TK are outputted to the output pocket 64.<br>
[0058] Replacement bank notes BN to be inserted are provided in a separate pocket 65 and are transfered into the bank note stream by a not shown control device of the postprocessing apparatus 60 when a separator card has just been transferred out of this stream. The replacement bank notes BN can either be e.g. finished bank notes with predetermined serial numbers or bank notes not having serial numbers, which are finished except for the serial number. In the latter case, after having been singled by singler 66 the replacement bank notes BN not having serial numbers are transported through printing unit 61 or another numbering apparatus, wherein the respective serial number is printed on.<br>
[0059] The value of the correct serial number to be printed can be transmitted to the control device of the postprocessing apparatus 60 preferably via a wired or wireless data link from the bank note sorting apparatus 1, in which the separator cards were inserted into the respective bank-note stack to be postprocessed. Alternatively, the data on the serial numbers of the bank notes to be inserted can be entered by hand. Furthermore, in the postprocessing apparatus 60 can be provided a checking unit, which captures data such as e.g. the serial number of the deposit's singled bank notes or data provided on the separator card or associated to that card, in order to determine therefrom the serial numbers of the bank notes to be printed. E.g., when in an otherwise uninterrupted sequence of serial numbers separator cards for missing bank notes are inserted, the next bank note can be printed with a serial number that is by 1 higher than the serial number of the last recognized bank note located before the respective separator card.<br>
[0060] After the separator cards were sorted out and the pertinent replacement bank notes were sorted in the bank note stream, a following further checking device 68 can be<br><br>
13<br>
provided, as to check e.g. whether in the now postprocessed bank note stream of a deposit all serial numbers are really present in the predetermined manner. If this is not the case, e.g. due to misprints of the printing unit 67, the respective bank notes are outputted to output pocket 69. The bank notes checked to be acceptable, however, go into output pocket 70.<br>
[0061] If from a deposit no unacceptable reject and/ or unfit bank notes were outputted to output pocket 69, the pertinent deposit has arrived completely in the pocket 70 and preferably can be strapped and packaged even there. If, however, unacceptable reject and/or unfit bank notes were outputted to reject-pocket 69, the pertinent deposit together with the already accepted bank notes of the deposit in the pocket 70 has to be removed and postprocessed in a conventional fashion by hand.<br>
[0062] Alternatively, independent of the check result of the further checking device 68, all bank notes of a deposit can be outputted to pockets 69 or 70, and the necessity for further postprocessing of the respective deposit can be indicated to the operator e.g. by an optical and/or acoustic display at the postprocessing apparatus 60, e.g. directly at the respective output pocket 69, 70.<br>
[0063] The checking device 63 of the postprocessing apparatus 60, alternatively or<br>
additionally, can be adapted to recognize marked bank notes, by e.g. recognizing the above mentioned sprayed marking inks. In this case said recognized marked bank notes are sorted out into output pocket 64.<br>
[0064] It was explained above to insert marking elements in the bank note stream or to mark bank notes to be sorted out, in order to mark those positions in the stack, at which bank notes are to be sorted out and/or in during postprocessing. According to a further alternative the postprocessing can also be effected directly in the bank note checking apparatus 1.<br>
[0065] Figure 6 shows such an example with a sorting apparatus 1. The bank notes BN to be checked are inputted in the input pocket 2 of the sorting apparatus 1, singled with the aid of singler 3 and transported through checking device 4, which checks the state, in particular the position and quality of the printed image of the bank<br><br>
14<br>
notes BN. In the following the reject-bank notes, which e.g. due to multiple picks could not be recognized, are outputted to the output pocket 5, and the unfit bank notes, on which e.g. misprints were detected, are outputted to the output pocket 40, which optionally can have a device for destroying, such as e.g. for shredding unfit bank notes, a so-called shredder.<br>
[0066] Unlike the separator card circuit of Figure 4, Figure 6 describes an analogous circuit of replacement bank notes BN that have already been checked as to adequate quality, i.e. printing quality, correct position of print etc, and can be re-transfered via the diverters 35 and 34 into the bank note stream 13 in the fashion required by the central bank, in order to replace the reject and/or unfit bank notes previously transferred out of a deposit. This embodiment can be advantageously used in particular in cases when the serial numbers of the inserted replacement bank notes BN are not important.<br>
[0067] Then all bank notes BN pass through a further checking device 41, the structure of which can correspond to the first checking device 4 and which serves for finally ensuring that the adequate number of replacement bank notes was transferred into the transport stream.<br>
[0068] The deposits such completed then are alternately outputted to the output pockets 6 for further processing, such as e.g. strapping and packaging. If the checking device 41 determines that the bank notes BN transported past have defects or cannot be recognized, the respective deposit is especially marked, e.g. with the aid of a respective warning signal at the respective output pocket 6, so that these faulty deposits have to be postprocessed by hand.<br>
[0069] A further idea of the present invention is that when the postprocessing is effected directly in the bank note checking apparatus 1, the devices for postprocessing, such as e.g. the devices for inserting separator cards according to Figure 4 or replacement bank notes according to Figure 6, are provided in a separate module of the bank note checking apparatus 1. This has the advantage that already existing<br><br>
15<br>
modularly structured bank note checking apparatuses can be easier retrofitted with this function.<br>
[0070] Figure 7 shows a respective example of a bank note sorting apparatus 1, which contains a plurality of separate modules 45 to 50 in its housing 44. These are, by way of example, a singler module 45 having input pocket 2 for bank notes BN and singler 3, a checking module 46 having checking device 4, a reject-module 47 having output pocket 5, an unfit module 48 having an output pocket 40 and a module for fit bank notes 50 having an output pocket 6. Bank note sorting apparatus 1 according to Figure 7 is characterized in particular by fit bank note module 50 being preceded by a further module 49, which has a device 51 for postprocessing, especially an input pocket 52 with singler 53, in order to be able, at the occurrence of reject and/ or unfit bank notes in a deposit, to insert, if necessary, replacement bank notes and/or marking elements in the bank note stream of the deposit.<br>
[0071] Since the individual functional components of the bank note sorting apparatus 1 are set up modularly and preferably have standardized transport transfer points, in order to be able to deliver bank notes of a module to a neighboring module, in particular the module 49 for postprocessing can be retrofitted in an already existing bank note sorting apparatus 1 by either replacing another not absolutely necessary module or additionally mounting the module 49 at the adequate position in the housing.<br>
[0072] According to a still further independent idea of the present invention the printing of the serial number can also be effected in the checking apparatus itself, namely by checking freshly printed bank notes, which have not yet been provided with serial numbers, as to their state and not before the unfit bank notes have been sorted out the predetermined serial numbers are printed onto the remaining bank notes having adequate quality. Checking the bank notes before and not after the printing of the serial number leads to a substantially lower printing effort when printing the serial numbers than it is the case with a usual check, wherein in an apparatus the already completely printed bank notes are checked.<br><br>
16<br>
[0073] According to the embodiment of Figure 8 bank notes BN, which have already been finished except for the serial number print and already have all other electrical, magnetic and optical security features, are inputted in the input pocket 2 of a bank note sorting apparatus 1, singled by the singler 3, checked by a checking device 4 as to their quality, such as e.g. the quality and position of the printed image, the not recognized reject-bank notes are outputted to pocket 5 and the recognized unfit bank notes to a pocket 40.<br>
[0074] The remaining fit bank notes subsequently are provided with continuous serial<br>
numbers by means of a serial number printing unit 75. As a printing unit e.g. either a mechanical printing unit or e.g. a laser printing unit can be used, which burns the serial numbers in the bank note paper. After that the bank notes provided with serial numbers preferably are checked once more in a further checking device 76, wherein in particular the correct printing of the serial numbers is checked.<br>
[0075] The unfit bank notes then recognized as such are outputted to a pocket 77 and the recognized fit bank notes having adequate quality according to predetermined checking criteria are collected to form a deposit and are outputted to one of the output pockets 78 or 79. After for example a predetermined number of bank notes corresponding to a desired deposit having been stacked in the pocket 78, the following bank notes of another deposit are stacked in pocket 79, as to have time to remove the deposit contained in pocket 78 or to automatically transport it away. The such completed deposits then are strapped and packaged in the bank note sorting apparatus 1 itself or with the help of an external device.<br>
[0076] This embodiment has the advantage, that bank notes without serial numbers are checked and thus deposits having any serial number sequences and being checked in an especially effective fashion can be provided, without an external postprocessing because of reject/unfit bank notes being necessary.<br>
[0077] If, however, an uninterrupted serial number sequence of the bank notes of a<br>
deposit is desired, but after the printing of the serial number the further checking device 76 has sorted out faulty bank notes BN, so that the respective serial<br><br>
17<br>
numbers are missing, it is necessary that the respective faulty stack in the respective output pocket 77, 78 has to be postprocessed.<br>
[0078] If an adequate distance is given between the individual bank notes BN to be<br>
checked, it can also be provided that the serial number of a bank note recognized as faulty by the further checking device 76 then is printed onto the immediately following bank note not yet printed with a serial number. When the said bank note is checked not to be faulty by the further checking device 76 and is stacked in the respective output pocket 78, 79, bank note deposits still to be postprocessed can be avoided. If said following bank note is checked also to be faulty, accordingly the bank note following thereafter is printed with the respective serial number.<br>
[0079] If the distance between the individual bank notes to be checked and to be printed is not so large that the preceding embodiment is applicable, there can also be provided, that after a bank note recognized to be faulty by the further checking device 76 not the immediately next following bank note is printed with its serial number, but a further following bank note in the bank note stream still without serial number is printed with the respective serial number, and after a successful check it is again stacked in the respective output pocket 78 or 79 and all printed bank notes in between, independent of the result of the check, are sorted out in a separate pocket. With that there can also be insured, that bank note deposits still to be postprocessed do not occur. The two latter variations can be positively used even when the checking apparatus does not carry out checks with bank notes not yet having serial numbers, but only checks with bank notes already printed with serial numbers.<br>
[0080] A further substantial advantage of such apparatuses with integrated postprocessing is that by integrating the postprocessing in the checking apparatus an unauthorized access to the checked bank notes is prevented. This can be supported in particular by the strapping and/ or packaging of the bank note bundles also being effected in the area of the checking apparatus protected against external access.<br><br>
18<br>
[0081] In the embodiment of Figure 8 the bank notes preferably are printed with the same speed as they are transported within the transportation arms connected thereto. But if the printing unit for printing serial numbers 75 needs more time in order to switch to the next serial number to be printed, there can be provided either a plurality of printing units for printing serial numbers 75 one behind the other, which e.g. print alternately, or there can be provided a plurality of transportation arms each having at least one printing unit for printing serial numbers 75, such as for example shown in Figure 9.<br>
[0082] This embodiment differs from that of Figure 8 in particular in that the individual bank notes checked to be acceptable by the checking device 4 alternately are diverted into one of three transportation arms, which each have a printing unit for printing serial numbers 75 and a subsequent output pocket 78. By this means a larger distance between the individual bank notes to be printed in the individual arms is achieved.<br>
[0083] According to the further embodiment of Figure 10 there can also be provided, that unlike in embodiment of Figure 9 not every arm has a separate output pocket for receiving the printed bank notes, but there is at least one common output pocket 78 for a plurality of arms, in the shown case e.g. a pocket 78 for all three transportation arms.<br>
[0084] While in all three above-described embodiments of the Figures 8 to 10 the transportation speed of the singled bank notes in apparatus 1 preferably is substantially constant, in particular with printing units 75 working with slower printing speed a reduction of the bank note speed before they pass through the printing unit 75 can be carried out. In the case of a roller transport system this can be effected e.g. by driving the transport rollers in the area before the printing unit 75 with reduced speed.<br>
[0085] Preferably, an embodiment according to Figure 11 can also be realized, wherein the bank notes to be printed are alternately supplied to a plurality of transportation arms, which each have a stacking device, such as a stacking wheel 90, which in a<br><br>
19<br>
usual fashion has a spiral slot stacking wheel 91, a stripper 92 and a deposit surface 93 for stacking the stripped out bank notes BN. By the bank note BN lying on the deposit surface 93 again being transported by a picking device 94 in a direction T to a subsequent printing unit followed by an output pocket 78, it is possible to reduce the transportation speed of the bank notes BN in a controlled fashion, in order to achieve the speed necessary for the printing unit 75 in an especially easy fashion.<br>
[0086] As to permit, despite the reduction of speed, a sufficiently high throughput of the bank notes BN transported to the stacking wheels 90 with higher speed, preferably there can be provided, as shown in the Figure 11, a plurality of transportation arms having pertinent devices for reducing speed (stacking wheel 90) and subsequent printing unit.<br>
[0087] Specifically, i.e. in the embodiment of Figure 11 only every third bank note of the bank note stream of a deposit will be shot into the stacking wheel 90 of a transportation arm. Thus there will be sufficient time to transport the only bank note away that lies on the deposit surface. If, however, the transport of the bank notes lying on the deposit surface is not effected fast enough, so that a plurality of bank notes is stacked there, the picking device 94 can also have a singler for singling the bank notes BN lying on the deposit surface 94.<br>
[0088] Optionally, according to the embodiments of Figures 9 to 11 there can be provided that each of the printing units for printing serial numbers 75 is followed by a further checking device for checking at least the serial number print and optionally there can be provided a subsequent branching leading to a plurality of output pockets (e.g. for fit vs. unfit bank notes).<br>
[0089] According to a further idea of the present invention for inserting replacement bank notes or marking elements or for marking bank notes to be replaced, moreover, there can be used a spindle counting device. These are devices to which a banknote bundle on one side is clamped and then the bank notes one after the other are<br><br>
20<br>
separated, in order to be able to quickly count and/ or check the bank notes in the stack, as e.g. described in DE 195 40 156 Al of the applicant.<br>
[0090] When due to a previous checking, e.g. in the spindle counting device itself or in a preceding bank note sorting apparatus, there has already been determined at which positions in the stack bank notes have to be inserted or replaced, then e.g. marking elements can be inserted in the separated stack at the right positions or the respective bank notes to be sorted out can be marked e.g. by spraying them, as to facilitate that these bank notes are found faster when postprocessed later. As to facilitate the automatic and or manual insertion of replacement documents in the stack, corresponding to the description of the counting device 20 of the embodiment of Figure 3 the separating process of the spindle counting device can be interrupted, when a replacement document has to be inserted and/or a marking has to be applied.<br>
[0091] As already repeatedly mentioned, in the apparatuses, in which bank notes are inserted in a bank note deposit to be postprocessed, preferably also a following check and at least count of the postprocessed bank notes will be effected, as to ensure that not too much or too few bank notes are provided in a deposit by mistake. Alternatively or additionally, this automatic count can also be effected in an external device and preferably before the strapping and packaging with the same. E.g. a device can be provided, which does not sort the inputted bank notes, but merely counts them and then straps and optionally packages the counted bank notes.<br>
[0092] Finally, it should be emphasized, that the invention is not restricted only to<br>
checking and applying serial numbers, but instead also other individualizing data, through which the individual documents of value differ from each other, can be applied or checked. In an individualization unit there can also be printed e.g. an individual bar code onto a non-individualized bank note, i.e. not yet provided with such individualizing data, or individual data can be written, preferably irreversibly written, in a chip of the bank note.<br><br>
