				<td>A CYANO-ARYL(OR CYANOHETEROARYL)-CARBONYL-<br>
PEPERAZINYL-PYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to new cyanoaryl (or cyanoheteroaryl)-<br>
carbonyl-piperazinyl-pyrimidines, with the general formula (I), as well as to their<br>
physiologically acceptable salts, to their preparation procedures, their application as<br>
medicines in human and/or veterinary therapeutic use and the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions which contain them.<br>
The new compounds object of the present invention may be used in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry as intermediates and to prepare medications.<br>

In our patent application WO 99/05121 we describe several derivatives of<br>
acyl-piperazinyl-pyrimidines, among which are the compounds with general formula<br>
(I), as products with sedative, anticonvulsivant, hypnotic and general anaesthetic<br>
activity. In said patent derivatives with the general formula (I) are described, in which<br>
R2 represents, among others, an aryl radical and a heteroaryl radical. The term "aryl"<br>
represents a phenyl radical, not substituted or substituted by 1, 2 or 3 like or<br>
different substituents, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, amine, acetamide, nitro,<br>
methyl, trifluoromethyl or methoxy. The term "heteroaryl" represents a<br>
heteroaromatic ring of 5 or 6 members substituted or not substituted, or fused<br>

comprising 1 or 2 heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, with the<br>
substituents being groups such as fluorine, chlonne, bromine, amine, acetamide,<br>
nitro, methyl, trifluoromethyl or methoxy.<br>
We have now discovered that the introducion of a cyano group (-C=N) in aryl<br>
or heteroaryl radicals results in new compounds with the general formula (I) which<br>
are more powerful than those previously described, having interesting biological<br>
properties which make them particularly suitable for use in human and/or veterinary<br>
therapeutics. The compounds object of this invention are useful as agents which are<br>
active on the central nervous system of mammals, including man. Specifically, the<br>
new compounds are useful as sedatives, anticonvulsivants, hypnotics and general<br>
anaesthetics.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides new compounds with the following<br>
properties: sedative, anticonvulsivant, analgesic, muscular relaxant, antitussive,<br>
anxiolytic, antipsychotic, antidepressive, anti-cerebral ischaemia, antimigraine, for<br>
sleep disorders, for neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive disorders and<br>
Alzheimer's disease, hypnotic or general anaesthetic in mammals, including man.<br>
Specifically, the new compounds of the invention a"e capable of causing conscious<br>
sedation, acting as hypnotic agents and agents capable of bringing about or<br>
maintaining general anaesthesia, depending on the dose and route of<br>
administration.<br>
The compounds object of the present invention have the general formula (I)<br>
wherein R, represents an alkoxy radical and R2 represents a cyanoaryl or a<br>
cyanoheteroaryl radical.<br>
In the present invention the term "alkoxy" represents an OR3 radical, wherein<br>
R3 is alkyl C1-C4 (i.e., an alkyl radical deriving from a saturated hydrocarbon with a<br>
linear or branched chain with 1 to 4 carbon atoms), such as methoxy, ethoxy,<br>
propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, sec-butoxy or tert-butoxy.<br>
The term "cyanoaryl" represents a phenyl radical substituted by at least one<br>
cyano radical (-ON).<br>
The term "cyanoheteroaryl" represents a radical of a heteroaromatic ring of 5<br>
or 6 members or a radical of fused heteroaromatic systems of 9 or 10 members<br>
substituted or not substituted comprising 1 or 2 heteroatoms such as nitrogen,<br>
oxygen or sulphur, all of them substituted at least by a cyano radical (-ON), such<br>
as, for example, 3-cyano-2-furyl, 3-cyano-2-thienyl, 5-cyano-2-thienyl, 3-cyano-2-<br>
pirrolyl, 3-cyano-2-pyridyl, 2-cyano-3-pyridyl, 2-cyano-4-pyridyl, 3-cyano-2-indolyl, 2-<br>

The present invention also relates to the physiologically acceptable salts of<br>
the compounds with the general formula (I), particularly to the salts from addition of<br>
mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and organic acids such as p-toluensulphonic or<br>
metansulphonic acid.<br>
The new derivatives of general formula (I) can be prepared by the methods<br>
A-G indicated below:<br>
METHOD A:<br>
Compounds with the general formula (I) can be obtained by reaction of the<br>
amine with general formula (II), in which R, is as described above, with a carboxylic<br>
acid with general formula R2COOH (III), in which R2 has the above described<br>
meaning, or with a salt of this acid or a reaction derivative R2COX (IV), (Diagram 1).<br>
Examples of these salts include salts of alkali metals, such as sodium and<br>
potassium salts, alkaline-earth metals such as calcium and magnesium salts,<br>
ammonium salt and salts of organic bases such as triethylamine, trimethylamine.<br>
pyridine and picoline.<br>
Examples of reaction derivatives with the general formula R2COX (IV)<br>
include those in which X is a halogen atom, preferably a chlorine or bromine atom,<br>
an azide group (-N3), a 1-imidazolyl group, an O-CO-R4 group, wherein R4 can be an<br>
alkyl radical with 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aryl radical, optionally substituted by one<br>
or more halogen atoms, or an OR5 group, wherein R5 represents an aromatic group<br>
with one or two rings, substituted by one or more halogen atoms or nitro radicals,<br>
preferably by the groups 4-nitrophenyl, 2,4-dinitrophenyl, pentachlorophenyl,<br>
pentafluorophenyl, 1-benzotriazolyl or N-succinimide. Likewise, instead of using the<br>
aforementioned reaction derivatives the compounds with the general formula (I) can<br>
be prepared directly by reaction of the amine (II) with a carboxylic acid with the<br>
general formula R2COOH (III), in which case it is preferable to have the reaction<br>
occur in the presence of carbonyl group activation reagents, such as N,N'-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,             N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide             or             3-(3-<br>
dimethylamino)propyl-1-ethylcarbodiimide. This reaction can also take place using<br>
the aforementioned carbodiimides in the presence of 1-benzotriazole or N-<br>
hydroxysucciminide. Acids with the general formula (III) and the amine with the<br>
general formula (II) also react directly in the presence of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole or<br>
of the anhydride of propanophosphonic acid.<br>
The reaction occurs in an organic solvent, for example an organic chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane or chloroform, a linear or cyclic ether such<br>
as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a polar aprotic solvent such as<br>
pyridine, dimethylsulphoxide, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, or any other<br>
suitable solvent. The reaction may occur in the presence of a mineral or organic<br>
base, such as an aliphatic amine, preferably triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine<br>
and is stirred at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of<br>
the solvent for a period between ten minutes and twenty-four hours, with the<br>
preferred conditions being between thirty minutes and five hours.<br>
METHOD B:<br>
The new derivatives with the general formula (I), wherein R1 is as described<br>

formula (VI), wherein R1 is as described above (Alonso, R., Castedo, L,<br>
Dominguez, D., J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54 (2), 424).<br>
The reaction takes place in an organic solvent, for example an organic<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or chloroform, a linear or cyclic<br>
ether such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a polar aprotic<br>
solvent such as pyridine, dimethylsulphoxide, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, or<br>
any other suitable solvent. The reaction may occur in the presence of a mineral or<br>
organic base, such as an aliphatic amine, preferably triethylamine or N-<br>
methylmorpholine and is stirred at a temperature between room temperature and<br>
the boiling point of the solvent for a period between ten minutes and twenty-four<br>
hours, with the preferred conditions being between thirty minutes and five hours.<br>
The oxime with general formula (VII), in which R-, is as described above, is<br>
obtained by the reaction of the aldehyde with general formula (VI) with<br>
hydroxylamine or a hydroxylamine salt. The reaction takes place in an organic<br>
solvent such as ethanol, or a mixture of ethanol and water or any other suitable<br>
solvent. The reaction occurs in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
sodium carbonate or sodium acetate, or an aliphatic amine, preferably pyridine,<br>
triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine and is stirred at a temperature between the<br>
room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a period between one hour<br>
and twenty-four hours.<br>
The transformation of the oxime with the general formula (VII), in which R1 is<br>
as described above, into the cyano derivative with general formula (I) wherein R1 is<br>
as described above is obtained by the reaction of the oxime (VII) with several<br>
dehydration reagents, such as (PhO)2PHO, p-CIC6H4OC(=S)CI, N,N'-<br>
carbonyldiimidazole, as well as in the presence of Cu(ll) ions such as Cu(AcO)2, or<br>
by acylation of the aldoxime with acetic anhydride or trifluoroacetic anhydride and<br>
later formation of the cyano radical with bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, pyridine or triethylamine. The<br>
reaction takes place at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling<br>
point of the solvent for a period between one hour and 4 days.<br>

and R2 represents a cyanoaryl or cyanopyridyl radical can be prepared according to<br>
the method represented in Diagram 3:<br>
The reaction of the amine with general formula (II), in which R1 is as<br>
described above, with an anhydride with the general formula (VIM) wherein Y<br>
represents a nitrogen atom (N) or an aromatic carbon atom joined to a hydrogen<br>
atom (CH), or the reaction of the amine with the general formula (II), in which R1 is<br>
as described above, with an acid with the general formula (IX) wherein Y represents<br>
a nitrogen atom (N) or an aromatic carbon atom joined to a hydrogen atom (CH)<br>
produces the acid with the general formula (X) wherein R1 and Y are as described<br>
above.<br>

example an organic chlorinated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or<br>
chloroform, a linear or cyclic ether such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or<br>
dioxane, a polar aprotic solvent such as pyridine, dimethylsulphoxide,<br>
dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile or any other suitable solvent. The reaction may<br>
occur in the presence of a mineral or organic base, such as an aliphatic amine,<br>
preferably triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine and is stirred at a temperature<br>
between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a period between<br>
ten minutes and twenty-four hours, with the preferred conditions being between<br>
thirty minutes and five hours.<br>
The reaction of the acid with general formula (IX) takes place in the presence<br>
of carbonyl group activation reagents such as N,N'-dicyclohexycarbodiimide, N,N'-<br>
diisopropylcarbodiimide or 3-(3-dimethylamino)propyl-1-ethylcarbodiimide. This<br>
reaction can also occur using said carbodiimides in the presence of 1-benzotriazole<br>
or N-hydroxysucciminide or by reaction of the acid (IX) with reagents such as thionyl<br>
chloride, oxalyl chloride, ethyl chloroformiate, pivaloyl chloroformiate or<br>
methansulfonyl chloride. The acid with the general formula (IX) and the amine with<br>

occurs in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, pyridine or any<br>
other suitable solvent. The reaction occurs in the presence of a base such as<br>
sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium acetate or an aliphatic amine,<br>
preferably pyridine, triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine and is stirred at a<br>
temperature between the room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a<br>
period between one hour and twenty-four hours.<br>
The amide with the general formula (XI), in which R, and Y are as indicated<br>
above, is obtained by reacting the acid with the general formula (X) with carbonyl<br>
group activation reagents and later treatment with ammonia. Activation of the<br>
carbonyl group of the acid with the general formula (X) is obtained by reacting (X)<br>
with reactants such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, ethyl chloroformiate, pivaloyl<br>
chloroformiate or methansulfonyl chloride. The reaction of the acid (X) with ammonia<br>
can also take place in the presence of carbonyl group activation reagents such as<br>
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,           N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide           or           3-(3-<br>
dimethylamino)propyl-1-ethylcarbodiimide. This reaction can also occur using the<br>
aforementioned carbodiimides in the presence of 1-benzotriazole or N-<br>
hydroxysucciminide. The acid with the general formula (X) and the ammonia also<br>
react directly in the presence of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole. The reaction occurs in an<br>

suitable solvent. The reaction occurs in the presence of a base such as sodium<br>
hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium acetate, an aliphatic amine, preferably<br>
pyridine, triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine and is stirred at a temperature<br>
between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a period between<br>
one and twenty-four hours.<br>
The transformation of the amide with the general formula (XI), in which R,<br>
and Y are as described above, into the cyano derivative with the general formula (I)<br>
wherein R, and Y are as described above is achieved by dehydration of the amide<br>
(XI) with several reagents, such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, trifluoroacetic<br>
anhydride, catalytic Bu2SnO or preferably methansulfonyl chloride (A.D. Dunn, M.J.<br>
Mills and W. Henry, Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 1982 Vol. 14(6) 396-399) or other<br>
dehydration reagents. The reaction occurs in an organic solvent such as<br>
dimethylformamide, methylene chloride, toluene and in the presence of a base such<br>

the general formula (II). The activation of the carbonyl group of the acid with the<br>
general formula (XII) is achieved by treatment with reagents such as thionyl<br>
chloride, oxalyl chloride, ethyl chloroformiate, pivaloyl chloroformiate or<br>
methansulphonyl chloride. The reaction of the acid (XII) and the amine with the<br>
general formula (II) can also occur in the presence of carbonyl group activation<br>
reagents such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide or 3-<br>
(3-dimethylamino)propyl-1-ethylcarbodiimide. This reaction can also be effected with<br>

hydroxysucciminide. The acid with the general formula (XII) and the amine (II) also<br>
react directly in the presence of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole or the anhydride of<br>
propanophosphonic acid. The reaction takes place in an organic solvent such as<br>

in which R1? R6 and Y are as described above leads to formation of the acid with the<br>
general formula (XIV) wherein R, and Y are as described above. Hydrolysis is<br>
achieved by conventional methods, such as saponification with sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate<br>
or by hydrolysis in an acid medium, such as hydrochloric acid. The reaction occurs<br>
in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, water, tetrahydrofuran or in a mixture thereof<br>
at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of the solution for<br>
a period between one hour and twenty-four hours.<br>

In Table 1 a few compounds which are illustrative of the invention are<br>
described, indicating their method of obtention, melting point and spectroscopic<br>
characteristics.<br>
General anaesthetic activity<br>
Studies have been performed on three species, mouse, rat and dog, following<br>
the protocols described below.<br>
a) Anaesthetic activity in mice.<br>
The anaesthetic activity was determined after intravenous (IV) administration of<br>
the product under study in three different doses (15, 10 and 5 mg/kg) in the caudal<br>
vein of the mouse. The percentage of anaesthetised animals was recorded and the<br>
average time of anaesthesia calculated. Mice were considered to be anaesthetised<br>
when losing the three reflexes: positional reflex, response reflex to painful stimulus<br>
(tail pinch) and palpebral reflex.<br>
The results obtained in this trial show that the products object of the invention<br>
are powerful anaesthetics as compared to one of the most widely used anaesthetics<br>
in human clinical use, propofol (table 2).<br>
b) Anaesthetic activity in dogs.<br>
A saline solution of the products in study was perfused by means of a<br>
perfusion pump in a concentration and rate of 5 mg/ml/minute, through a cannula<br>
inserted in a vein of the front leg. The i.v. infusion was stopped when the animal was<br>
fully anaesthetised (loss of motor coordination, sedation, loss of response to painful<br>
stimulus - prick in the fingers of the front leg - and loss of the palpebral reflex) and<br>
the anaesthetic dose was determined (Table 3).<br>
Animals treated with propofol only fell asleep, as they maintained the palpebral<br>
and pain reflexes.<br>
The results obtained for dogs show that the products of the invention are clearly<br>
superior to Propofol, as they achieved full anaesthesia.<br>
c) Anaesthetic activity in rats.<br>
In this test, through the cannulated caudal vein of a rat was perfused a solution<br>
of the products under study with a concentration of 10 mg/kg. The rate of perfusion<br>
was varied to keep the rats anaesthetised for 1 hour. The total dose administered<br>
was determined, showing that the products of the invention were more active than<br>
Propofol (Table 4).<br>
Sedative activity<br>
The sedative activity was studied by observing the animals' behaviour after<br>
intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a dose of 80 mg/kg. This observation was<br>
conducted at different times, allowing to know the sedative effect and its duration.<br>
The results obtained show that the products under study had a sedative effect, in<br>
some cases comparable to that of Zolpidem and in other cases of longer duration<br>
(Table 6).<br>
Activity as muscular relaxant<br>
The activity as muscular relaxant of the products of the invention was<br>
studied, by evaluating the effect on body tone and abdominal tone of the rats,<br>
following the method described by S. IRWIN (Gordon Res.Conf. on Medicinal<br>
Chem., 1959, p. 133). The rats received the products under study in a i.p. dose of 80<br>
mg/kg and at several times after administration (1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours) the body<br>
and abdominal tone were evaluated, comparing muscle tension to that of the control<br>
animals. The results of Table 7 show that many products have a remarkable activity<br>
as muscular relaxants, with this effect lasting longer than with propofol, which was<br>
used as the product of reference.<br>
