[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a fluid pump structure<br>
which is attached to an internal combustion engine and has<br>
excellent sealing performance, and more particularly relates<br>
to a cooling water pump.<br>
f0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art]	v<br>
A cooling water pump or a lubrication oil pump installed in an internal combustion engine is a member separate from a body of the internal combustion engine , and has its own drive shaft extending mainly into a crankcase. A gear or sprocket connected to the pump drive shaft is coupled to a shaft such as a crankshaft or the like of the internal combustion engine (refer to Japanese Patent Publication Sho 56-28209, for example ) .<br>
The cooling water pump and a radiator are separate from the internal combustion engine, and are connected to the<br>
internal combustion engine via flexible hoses or the like, thereby constituting a cooling water circulating route.<br>
[0004^<br>
[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
In the foregoing fluid pump, a pump driving shaft passes through a pump casing, so that a mechanical seal has to be<br><br>
provided in order to prevent the fluid from leaking outside via an area where the pump drive shaft is supported. [00051] -<br>
When such a mechanical seal is used, a longer pump driving shaft is required in order to maintain the sealing performance, which will lead to an increase in the number of components and machining steps, and generation of driving force at the mechanical seal due to friction. If the fluid<br>
V<br>
is cooling water, it is necessary to prepare a drain for drawing off cooling water which leaks due to wearing or aging<br>
of the seal. [0006 -].<br>
The internal combustion engine including the radiator as a separate member requires a great number of components, and becomes expensive. Further, it is inevitable not only that such an engine requires complicated connection and maintenance work for flexible hoses but also that the engine and its accessories become large as a whole. [0007] [Means to solve the Problems and Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention is intended to overcome the problems of the related art, and relates to improvements of a fluid pump structure for an internal combustion engine. In a fluid pump structure for an internal combustion engine, a bottomed cylindrical member is disposed in a body of the internal combustion engine and is capable of transmitting magnetism, a driving rotary member is rotatable around an<br>
outer surface of the bottomed cylindrical member via a central rotation hole thereof in response to the operation of the internal combustion engine, a fluid pump casing is composed of a sealing member in contact with an open end of the bottomed cylindrical member and the bottomed cylindrical member; the fluid pump casing houses an impeller and an impeller rotating shaft which are coaxial with and rotatable with the driving rotary member, and a plurality of pairs of<br>
V<br>
magnets having alternately arranged positive and negative poles are positioned as integral members on the inner surface of the driving rotary member and on the outer surface of the impeller rotating shaft near the center of the driving rotary member with the peripheral surface of the bottomed cylindrical member interposed therebetween. [0008] •<br>
In the foregoing structure, when the driving rotary member is activated in response to the operation of the internal combustion engine, a rotating magnetic field is generated by the permanent magnets which are positioned on the inner surface of the central rotation hole of the driving rotary member. This rotating magnetic field passes through the bottomed cylindrical member to reach the magnets integral with the impeller rotating shaft of the fluid pump, thereby rotating the magnets of the impeller rotating shaft. Therefore, the impeller of the fluid pump is rotated, making the fluid pump active.<br>
According to the invention, the impeller rotating shaft of the fluid pump does not pass through the bottomed cylindrical member and the fluid pump casing but are rotatably supported in these members. Thus, no seal is necessary for the impeller rotating shaft, which is effective in shortening the impeller rotating shaft, making the fluid pump compact in size and light in weight, simplifying the<br>
«*<br>
V	*<br>
structure, and reducing manufacturing cost. Further, the fluid pump can be completely sealed. Even when a fluid pump circuit is blocked and the impeller cannot rotate, the driving rotary member can rotate, preventing application of a large force to a pump driving system. [0010]<br>
The fluid pump structure may be used as a cooling water pump or a lubrication oil pump for the internal combustion engine, as defined in claim 2 or 3. [0011]<br>
The structure defined in claim 4 enables the fluid pump to be activated using a part of power transmitted to the valve system without using any special power transmitting mechanism. [&amp;013]<br>
In the structure defined in claim 5, the fluid pump can be completely sealed without any seal for the impeller driving shaft. Further, the fluid pump can be reliably maintained, inspected, and fixed without being adversely<br>
affected by the transmission belt. . [0013] —<br>
The structure defined in claim 6 allows the lubrication oil pump and the cooling water pump to be connected in series on the bottom of the internal combustion engine and to be simultaneously operated. Further, the lubrication oil and the cooling water can be independent from each other, and can be prevented from being mixed. [0014]__<br>
In the cooling structure defined in claim 7, heat generated in a combustion chamber of the cylinder is removed by the cooling water flowing through the water jacket near the combustion chamber, so that the combustion chamber can be maintained at an appropriate temperature. Further, the cooling water receiving combustion heat is cooled by the radiator unit integral with the engine. Then, the cooling water is returned to the water jacket by the cooling water pump. [0015]<br>
With the cooling structure defined in claim 8, the radiator unit is integral with the engine, which simplifies the cooling structure of the engine, and makes the engine compact in size, light in weight and less expensive.<br>
The cooling structure defined in claim 9 allows the cooling water heated by the combustion in the combustion chamber to be cooled by the heat absorbing fins of the fin<br>
radiator unit. Heat absorbed by the heat absorbing fins is transmitted to the radiating fins, which discharge heat into the atmosphere . Even when it does not have a sradiator of the related art, the internal combustion engine can assure excellent cooling performance compared with an air-cooling type internal combustion engine.<br>
Further, the cooling structure enables heat of the cooling water heated by the combustion in the engine to be absorbed by the inner surface of the cooling-water heat absorbing path. The absorbed heat is transmitted to the<br>
radiating fins, and is discharged into the atmosphere. Thus, the internal combustion engine can assure excellent cooling performance.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a fluid pump apparatus for an<br>
internal combustion engine, characterized in that:<br>
a bottomed cylindrical member (63) is fixedly disposed in a body of the<br>
internal combustion engine (4) and is capable of transmitting magnetism;<br>
a driving rotary member (71) is rotatable around an outer surface of said<br>
bottomed  cylindrical  member   (63)   in   response   to  the  operation  of the<br>
internal combustion engine (4);<br>
a fluid pump casing (9) is composed of a sealing member (47) in contact<br>
with  an  open  end  of said  bottomed  cylindrical  member (63)  and  said<br>
bottomed cylindrical member (63);<br>
said fluid pump casing (9) houses an impeller (67) and an impeller rotating<br>
shaft (66) which are coaxial with and rotatable with said driving rotary<br>
member (71); and<br>
a plurality of pairs of magnets (68, 72) having alternately arranged positive<br>
and negative poles are positioned as integral members on the inner surface<br>
of said driving rotary member (71) and on the outer surface of said impeller<br>
rotating shaft (67) near the center of said driving rotary member (71) with<br>
the peripheral surface of said bottomed cylindrical member (63) interposed<br>
therebetween.<br><br><br>

The invention will be described with reference to an embodiment shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 12.<br>
An overhead four-stroke single cylinder internal combustion engine 1 includes a fluid pump according to the invention. The engine 1 is suspended from a body frame (not shown) of a motorcycle in such a manner that a head cover 5 and a cylindrical cavity 10 are oriented substantially forward and horizontally.  In the engine 1, an engine body 4 having a cylinder block and a cylinder head as integral members, and the head cover 5 are arranged one over the other in front of split-type lefr and right crankcases 2 and 3,<br>
thereby constituting an integral unit.<br>
A piston 11 is slidably fitted in the cylindrical cavity 10 of the engine body 4. Left and right crankshafts 12 and 13 are rotatably supported by the left and right crankcases 2 and 3 via bearings 14, respectively. The left and right crankshafts 12 and 13 are interlocked via a crank pin 15. A connecting rod 17 is rotatably coupled via its opposite ends to a piston pin 16 fitted in the piston 11 (shown in Fig. 4)<br>
V<br>
and the crank pin 15. Thus, the left and right crankshafts 12 and 13 are rotatable in response to the movement of the piston 11.<br>
{0019]<br>
The engine body 4 has an intake port 18 which opens on a left top of the cylindrical cavity 10, and an exhaust port 19 opening on a right side top of the cylindrical cavity 10. The intake port 18 is sloped upward toward the front side of a motorcycle, and communicates with a carburetor 21 via an intake pipe 20. Referring to Fig. 3, the exhaust port 19 is curved right, and is connected to an exhaust pipe (not shown). [00 20]<br>
An intake valve 22 and an exhaust valve 23 are present at sides of the intake and exhaust ports 18 and 19 near the cylindrical cavity 10, respectively. A valve system 24 opens and closes the intake and exhaust valves 22 and 23 once at a predetermined timing each time the left and right crankshafts 12 and 13 rotate twice.<br>
The valve system 24 comprises: a camshaft 26 which is parallel to the left and right crankshafts 12 and 13, and is rotatably supported by the engine body 4 and the head cover 5 via bearings 25; an intake cam 27 and an exhaust cam 28 which are present on the center lines of the intake and exhaust valves 22 and 23, and are integral with the camshaft 26; a valve spring 29 which continuously urges the intake and<br>

£00224-<br>
A spark plug 36 is detachably mounted in the engine body 4 in order to be present between the intake and exhaust valves 22 and 23, and project into the cylindrical cavity 10.<br>
[0023]<br>
The engine body 4 also includes: a water jacket 37 around the top of the cylindrical cavity 10; a cooling water supply path 38 which communicates with the water jacket 37, and has an opening at a left lower part of the engine body 4;<br>
a cooling water discharge path 39 which communicates with the water jacket 37, and has an opening at a right upper part of the engine body 4 and; a plurality of flat cooling-water heat absorbing paths 40, are positioned above the water jacket 37 and the cooling water discharging path 39, and are substantially vertically arranged toward the front part of the motorcycle. A plurality of radiating fins 41 are provided above the cooling water heat absorbing path 40 in such a manner that they upwardly slope toward the front part of the motorcycle.<br>
A right ridge 6 is water-tight and integral not only with the opening of the cooling water discharge path 39 which is at the right side of the engine body 4 but also a right end opening of the cooling-water heat absorbing paths 40, so that the paths 39 and 40 are water-tight. The cooling-water discharging path 39 and the cooling-water heat absorbing paths 40 communicate with one another via a recess 42 of the right ridge 6. A plurality of radiating fins 43 extend rearward from the right ridge 6. A pair of radiating fins 45 having heat absorbing grooves 44 therein are positioned under and in parallel with the radiating fins 43. The cooling-water heat absorbing path 40 and the radiating fins 41 constitute a path fin radiator unit 46.<br>
An annular projection 47 of a cooling water pump casing 9 made of a magnetism transmitting material such as aluminum<br>
or resin is fitted so as to be water-tight in the opening of the cooling water supply path 38. The right side of the cooling water pump casing 9 is coupled to the right side of a partition 7, using a bolt (not shown), so as to be watertight. The right side of a left cover 8 is attached to the left side of the partition 7 so as to be water-tight, using a bolt 49 (see Fig. 8).<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, a spiral discharge port 50 is formed at the lower right part of the partition 7, and communicates via its rear end with the cooling water supply path 38 of the engine body 4 and a hole 48 on the cooling water pump casing 9. An impeller holder 51 is present at the center of the spiral discharge port 50. Three arcuate inlet holes 52 are arranged in a circle toward the left side of the partition 7. A recess 53 for sealing the left end of the cooling-water heat absorbing path 40 of the engine body 4, and a hole 55 communicating with a recess 54 on the left side of the partition are formed on a right upper part of the partition 7. r no 7 7 1<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, a plurality of heat absorbing fins 56 substantially vertically extend behind the left side of partition 7, and a plurality of radiating fins 57 substantially horizontally extend in front of and behind the heat absorbing fins 56. The heat absorbing fins 56 and the radiating fins 57 constitute a fin radiator unit 79.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, an absorbing recess 58 is formed at the lower right part of a left ridge 8 (the recess 58 is shown at the upper part in Fig. 11). A plurality of heat absorbing fins 59 substantially horizontally extend toward the front part of the motorcycle, and are in the middle of the spiral discharge port 50. The left ridge 8 also has on its top a hole 61 communicating with a cooling water inlet 60. Referring to Fig. 1, the left ridge 8 also includes a plurality of radiating fins 62 extending forward from its left side. The heat absorbing fins 59 and the radiating fins 62 constitute a fin radiator unit 80. <br>
In the cooling water pump casing 9, a rotor housing 63 is disposed to the right of the impeller holder 51 of the partition 7 as shown in Fig. 8. On the right side of the partition 7, a blind support hole 64 is formed at the center of the three arcuate inlet holes 52. Another blind support hole 65 is formed on the bottom of the rotor housing 63, along a line extending right from the center line of the blind support hole 64. Opposite ends of a pump rotating shaft 66 are rotatably fitted in the blind support holes 64 and 65. An impeller 67 is supported by the pump rotating shaft 66 so as to be integral therewith. A plurality of permanent magnets 68 are disposed around an impeller shaft 67a of the impeller 67 in such a manner that the positive and negative poles of the magnets 68 are alternately arranged.<br>
Further, a bearing receiving bore 69 is formed on the engine body 4 in a direction which is radially outward from the rotor housing 63 of the cooling water pump casing 9. A driven sprocket 71 is rotatably received in the bearing receiving bore 69 via a bearing 70. A plurality of permanent magnets 72 of a number that is the same as the number of permanent magnets 68 having alternate positive and negative<br>
%<br>
poles and being arranged in a circle are fixed on an inner surface of the driven sprocket 71. The driven sprocket 71 engages with the endless chain 34. The cooling water pump 73 is constituted by the rotor housing 63 of the pump casing 9r pump rotating shaft 66, impeller 67, permanent magnets 68, bearing receiving bore 69, driven sprocket 71 and permanent magnets 72 . When the endless chain 34 is moved in response to the operation of the overhead 4-stroke single cylinder internal combustion engine 1, the driven sprocket 71 is rotated, so that the permanent magnets 68 are rotated by a magnetic force acting between the permanent magnets 72 integral with the driven sprockets 71 and the permanent magnets 68 integral with the impeller 67. Thus, the cooling water pump 73 is activated.<br>
As show in Fig. 3, a starter driven sprocket 74 is fitted in the left crankshaft 12. An endless chain 76 extends over a driving sprocket (not shown) of a starter motor 75 (shown in Fig. 2) and the starter driven sprocket 74<br>
The rotation of the starter motor 75 activates the overhead 4-stroke single cylinder internal combustion engine 1.<br>
A lubrication oil pump 77 is housed in the left and right crankcases 2 and 3 as shown in Fig. 2. The lubrication oil pump 77 is activated in response to the operation of the engine 1 .<br>
In the drawings, reference numeral 78 denotes a<br>
V<br>
generator.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 12 and structured as described above, the starter motor 75 activates the engine 1, and the movement of the endless chain 34 rotates the driven sprocket 71, thereby making the cooling water pump 73 active .<br>
When the cooling water pump 73 is active, the cooling water in a space defined by the left and right sides of the partition 7 is introduced into the impeller holder 51 from the intake recess 58 of the left ridge 8 via the arcuate inlet holes 52 of the partition 7, and is discharged into the spiral discharge port 50 by the impeller 67 which rotates following the driven sprocket 71. This cooling water is then introduced to the water jacket 37 from the rear end of the spiral discharge port 50 via the hole 48 of the cooling water pump casing 9 and the cooling water supply path 38, thereby cooling the top of the cylindrical cavity 10.<br>
The cooling water which is heated by gas burning in the cylindrical cavity 10 flows into the cooling-water heat absorbing path 40 via the cooling water discharge path 39 at the right upper part of the water jacket 37, and via the radiating fins 43 of the right ridge 6. A part of the cooling water in the radiating fins 43 is cooled by the radiating fins 45. The right ridge 6 heated by the hot cooling water is cooled by the heat absorbing groove 44 and the path fin radiator unit 46. [W3Tf<br>
Composed of a number of flat members, the cooling-water heat absorbing path 40 of the engine body 4 can remove a sufficient amount of heat from the cooling water flowing therein. The cooling-water heat absorbing path 40 and its peripheral members are cooled by the radiating fins 41.<br>
The cooling water passing through the cooling-water heat absorbing path 40 flows via the hole 55 into the left recess 54 of the partition 7 from the right recess 53 of the partition 7, flows downward in a cooling water flowing space defined by the partition 7 and the left ridge 8, and re-enters into the arcuate inlet holes 52 of the partition 7 via the intake recess 58 of the left ridge 8. Thus, the cooling water circulates in the cooling water circulating route. UHBSH --- *<br>
The cooling water flowing through the cooling water<br>
flowing space comes into contact with the heat absorbing fins 56 of the partition 7 and the heat absorbing fins 59 of the left ridge 8, is cooled by these fins 56 and 59, and passes through the partition 7 and the left ridge 8. Heat of the cooling water is discharged into the atmosphere by the radiating fin 57 of the partition 7 and the radiating fins 62 of the left ridge 8.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 12, the cooling water circulating route is defined by the engine body 4, right ridge 6, partition 7 and left ridge 8. In this circulating route are interposed the path fin radiator unit 46 and fin radiators 79 and 80. Therefore, combustion heat generated in the cylindrical cavity 10 is absorbed by the cooling water, heat of which is radiated into the atmosphere. Cooling performance of the embodiment is better than that of an air-cooling type engine. 40040] -<br>
The cooling water pump can be downsized, since it has very small duct resistance, a small lift and a small drive torque compared with an ordinary radiator.<br>
The path fin radiator unit 46 and the fin radiator units 79 and 80 disposed in the cooling water circulating route are integral with the engine 1. The engine 1 including the cooling system can be compact in size, light in weight, and simple in structure as a whole, and can remarkably reduce<br>
cost.  Further, the engine 1 does not require a corrugate fin type radiator, so that the engine is very durable, is free from a problem that the radiator is choked up by dust and other materials, and can assure reliable cooling performance in dusty, inappropriate environments.<br>
In the cooling water pump 73, the pump rotating shaft 66 integral with the impeller 67 does not pass through the partition 7 and the pump casing 9 which seal the impeller 67, but is rotatably supported in the partition 7 and the pump casing 9. Not only the magnetic force of the permanent magnets 68 integral with the pump rotating shaft 66 and the impeller 67 but also the magnetic force of the permanent magnets 72 integral with the driven sprocket 71 which is rotatably supported in the bearing receptacle 69 of the engine body 4 on the outer surface of the rotor housing 63 of the pump casing 9 cause the impeller 67 to rotate following the driven sprocket 71 which is rotated by the movement of the endless chain 34. Therefore, no mechanical seal is necessary in order to effectively keep the pump rotating shaft 66 water-tight. <br>
The pump rotating shaft 66 can be shortened and simplified because of the absence of a mechanical seal. This is effective in keeping the pump structure light in weight and less expensive.<br>
The driven sprocket 71 is forcibly rotated by the movement of the endless belt 34 of the valve system 24. However, torque is indirectly transmitted between the driven sprocket 71 and the impeller 67 by mutual magnetic forces of the permanent magnets 68 and 72. Even when the impeller 67 undergoes a large resistance torque, the driven sprocket 71 and the impeller 67 slip in relation to each other in order<br>
V<br>
to enable the driven sprocket 71 to continue rotating. Therefore, no large force is applied to the valve system 24.<br>
The cylinder block and the cylinder head are integral with the engine body 4, which simplifies the engine and reduces cost thereof.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 12, the driven sprocket 71 for rotating the impeller 67 of the cooling water pump 73 is positioned outside the endless belt 34, and the impeller 67 of the cooling water pump 73 is positioned outside the driven sprocket 71 and the endless belt 34. Alternatively, the driven sprocket 71 may be at a position inside the endless chain 34, and the impeller 67 may be positioned inside the driven sprocket 71 and the endless belt 34, as shown in Figs. 13 and 14.<br>
Further, in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 12, the cooling water pump 73 and the lubrication oil pump 77 are<br>
separate from each other, and are activated by different power transmission systems. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 15, an endless chain 85 may extend between a driving sprocket 82 integral with a crankshaft 81 and a driven sprocket 84 integral with a rotation axis 83 of the lubrication oil pump 77, and an end of the rotation axis 83 opposite to the driven sprocket 84 may be in the shape of a cylinder 86. The permanent magnets 72 having negative and positive poles alternately arranged may be integral with the inner surface of the cylinder 86, and the rotor housing 63 of the cooling water pump casing 9 may be concentrically fitted in the cylinder 86 with tolerance. Further, both the cooling water pump 73 and the lubrication oil pump 77 may be coaxial and adjacent to each other, which is effective in keeping the cooling water pump 73 completely water-tight. This is also effective in preventing the cooling water and the lubrication oil from being mixed.<br>
Not only the pump driving unit but also the whole pump structure may be positioned in an oil chamber.<br>
[0049]The cooling water pump 73 can be activated and rotated using the power transmission system of the lubrication oil pump 77, so that the overhead 4-stroke single cylinder internal comustion engine 1 can be simplified and be manufactured at a reduced cost.<br>
