				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING N-ALKYLNALTREXONE HALIDES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing N-alkylnaltrexone<br>
halides.<br>
N-Alkyl quaternary derivatives of naltrexone (a nomenclature of naltrexone<br>
being (5α)-17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one or<br>
N-cyclopropylmethylnoroxymorphone) are known for their therapeutic applications,<br>
especially N-methylnaltrexone, the use of which makes it possible to combine a<br>
morphine treatment in a patient, significantly reducing the adverse side effects of<br>
morphine and derivatives thereof, especially on the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
The term "N-methylnaltrexone" more particularly means (R)-N-methyl-<br>
naltrexone, i.e. the compound of (R) configuration relative to the nitrogen atom, it<br>
being well known to those skilled in the art that the (S)-N-methyl compound has<br>
activity opposite to that desired for accompanying a morphine-based treated.<br>
The configuration of the quaternary ammonium of the N-methylnaltrexone<br>
having the formula below was determined by 1H NMR of the isolated (R) and (S)<br>
diastereoisomers:<br><br>
- (S) configuration of the ammonium (equatorial methyl): R1 represents a<br>
methyl group and R2 represents a methylcyclopropyl group, and<br>
- (R) configuration of the ammonium (axial methyl) : R2 represents a<br>
methyl group and R1 represents a methylcyclopropyl group.<br>
The chemical shifts in 1H NMR of the methyl group (reference TMS or<br>
tetramethylsilane) are at 3.62 ppm for the (R) configuration and at 3.13 ppm for the<br>
(S) configuration.<br>
Patent US 4 176 186 (Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH) describes quaternary<br>
noroxymorphone derivatives and also processes for preparing them. However, the<br>
described processes comprise conditions, especially of pressure, of necessary<br><br>
amount of reagent, and of conversion by column anion exchange, which are<br>
incompatible with the desired industrial application.<br>
Patent application WO 2004/043 964 A2 describes a process at lower<br>
pressures, comprising the use of an anhydrous solvent system, especially 1-methyl-<br>
2-pyrrolidone, but which nevertheless still has drawbacks in terms of impurities, the<br>
imperative sufficiently low content of which inevitably leads to an unsatisfactory<br>
yield.<br>
There was thus ever-increasing interest in having available a process for the<br>
industrial-scale production of such derivatives, under the best conditions in terms of<br>
production (safety and environment) and yield.<br>
A process has now been found, entirely surprisingly and unexpectedly, for<br>
very advantageously improving both the implementation conditions in terms of<br>
safety, not only for the personnel but also for the environment, and the yield for the<br>
desired final product, i.e. an N-alkylnaltrexone halide, in particular N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a process comprising the steps according<br>
to Scheme 1 below may be performed.<br><br><br>
In the text hereinbelow, the starting compounds and the reagents mentioned<br>
for the process according to the invention, when their mode of preparation is not<br><br>
described, are commercially available or described in the literature, or may be<br>
prepared according to methods that are described therein or that are known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
A subject of the present invention is thus, most particularly, a novel<br>
intermediate compound which, without wishing to be bound by any theory, is in the<br>
form of a double ion having the formula (I) below (which may thus be referred to as<br>
an N-methylnaltrexone double ion):<br><br>
The respective diastereoisomers of (R) and (S) configurations relative to the<br>
nitrogen atom of the N-methylnaltrexone double ion, and also mixtures thereof,<br>
including racemic mixtures, form part of the invention.<br>
Besides its anhydrous form, the N-methylnaltrexone double ion may also<br>
exist in the form of a hydrate.<br>
According to the invention, the term "hydrate" means a form of association<br>
or combination of the compound of formula (I) with one or more molecules of water<br>
of crystallization in the crystal lattice, i.e. excluding the water of insertion into the<br>
microchannels of the crystals (or "water of impregnation"), the hydrate possibly<br>
being determined firstly by analysis on a monocrystal and then confirmed routinely<br>
by comparative analysis of diffractograms (or powder diagrams) as is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art and illustrated in Example 1.<br>
Such hydrates also form part of the invention. For example, the hemihydrate,<br>
dihydrate and trihydrate forms may be mentioned.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the double ion of<br>
formula (I) has an (R) configuration relative to the nitrogen atom and is in dihydrate<br>
form.<br>
This novel N-methylnaltrexone double ion compound, of formula (I), may<br>
advantageously be prepared via a process comprising the step that consists in<br><br>
reacting N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate in aqueous solution with an alkaline<br>
agent chosen from the group constituted by sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium<br>
carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, caesium carbonate,<br>
strontium carbonate and mixtures thereof, for a pH of the aqueous solution of<br>
between 7 and 10 and preferably between 9.5 and 9.8 and at a temperature of<br>
between 15 and 30°C, preferably about 20°C.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also a process for preparing N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide, comprising at least the steps consisting in:<br>
(i) reacting N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate in aqueous solution with an<br>
alkaline agent chosen from the group constituted by sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, caesium carbonate,<br>
strontium carbonate and mixtures thereof, for a pH of the aqueous reaction medium<br>
of between 7 and 10 and preferably between 9.5 and 9.8 and at a temperature of<br>
between 15 and 30°C, preferably about 20°C, and then in<br>
(ii) reacting the product thus obtained with hydrobromic acid, preferably of<br>
48% concentration, which is added for a pH of the aqueous reaction medium of<br>
between 0.5 and 5 and preferably of about 1, and the reagents are preferably left in<br>
contact with stirring for a further one hour, in order thus to obtain the N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide.<br>
Preferably, the alkaline agent is chosen from the group constituted by<br>
sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to one particular embodiment, methanol may be added at the end<br>
of step (ii) described above, the reaction medium is heated to a temperature of<br>
between 20 and 80°C, for example between 50 and 70°C, preferably about 60°C,<br>
until dissolution is virtually complete, and the remaining light insoluble matter is then<br>
separated out by filtration, in order subsequently to cool the methanol/water filtrate,<br>
preferably to about 0°C, in order to crystallize therefrom the desired N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide.<br>
According to another particularly preferred embodiment, the insoluble<br>
product obtained at the end of step (i) described above is isolated after filtration by<br>
suction, and is then suspended in a methanol/water mixture, preferably of 4/1, thus<br>
constituting the aqueous reaction medium for step (ii) in which is performed the<br>
reaction with hydrobromic acid, preferably at 48% concentration, which is added, for<br>
a pH of the aqueous reaction medium of between 0.5 and 5 and preferably of about<br>
3, at a temperature of between 20 and 80°C, for example between 50 and 70°C,<br><br>
preferably 60°C, until dissolution is almost complete, and the remaining light<br>
insoluble matter is then separated out by filtration, in order subsequently to cool the<br>
filtrate, preferably to about 0°C, to crystallize therefrom the desired N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide.<br>
Recrystallization in a methanol/water mixture (of N-methylnaltrexone<br>
bromide) or optional washing of the isolated product (N-methylnaltrexone double<br>
ion) with an organic solvent (for example methanol) makes it possible to remove the<br>
lipophilic impurity O-benzyl-N-methylnaltrexone bromide that may still be present.<br>
The process according to the invention may advantageously include a step<br>
of purification of the N-methylnaltrexone bromide thus obtained, by dissolution in an<br>
acetone/water mixture, preferably of 80/20, heating to reflux, preferably for at least<br>
about 15 minutes, and then separation by hot filtration, precipitation of the N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide by placing the hot filtrate in contact with warm acetone,<br>
preferably of about 50°C, and cooling of the reaction medium to a temperature<br>
below 0°C, preferably -2°C, the N-methylnaltrexone bromide thus precipitated being<br>
recovered by filtration, and dried.<br>
This step of purification of the N-methylnaltrexone bromide may also be<br>
performed via dissolution in a methanol/water mixture or in water alone; similar<br>
yields and qualities of the same chemical species are then obtained.<br>
In the process described below, the N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate may<br>
be advantageously obtained by subjecting O-benzyl-N-methylnaltrexone methyl<br>
sulfate to a hydrogenation step.<br>
This hydrogenation step may advantageously be performed as described in<br>
Example 1 below, and even more generally by subjecting O-benzyl-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate, in the form of an aqueous solution, to a<br>
hydrogenation on 5% palladium-on-charcoal, the reaction medium being maintained<br>
at a temperature of between 30 and 50°C, preferably 40°C, under a pressure of<br>
about 2.5 bar of hydrogen, for at least about 2 hours for complete O-debenzylation.<br>
The reaction medium is then cooled and the catalytic system removed by filtration.<br>
The product obtained may advantageously not be isolated, which makes it<br>
possible to avoid any contact with the residual dimethyl sulfate (highly toxic<br>
product).<br>
In the process according to the invention, O-benzyl-N-methylnaltrexone<br>
methyl sulfate may be advantageously obtained by reacting O-benzylnaltrexone with<br>
dimethyl sulfate, in acetone, in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate, the<br><br>
reaction medium being refluxed for a sufficient time, preferably at least about 72<br>
hours, for acceptable disappearance of the O-benzylnaltrexone compound, the<br>
reaction monitoring possibly being monitored in a known manner, for example by<br>
HPLC monitoring.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also the novel intermediate compound<br>
O-benzyl-N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate, thus obtained.<br>
The respective diastereoisomers of (R) and (S) configurations relative to the<br>
nitrogen atom of O-benzyl-N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate, and also mixtures<br>
thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the invention.<br>
In particular, the benzyl protecting group on the phenolic oxygen most<br>
particularly has a twofold advantage:<br>
-	cleavage without introduction and formation of an ionic product: only<br>
hydrogen is used, and the toluene formed is readily removed;<br>
-	hydrogenation makes it possible to reduce the amount of 7,8-didehydro-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone (undesirable conjugated ketone) in the final product after<br>
hydrogenation of the double bond.<br>
Moreover, the process according to the invention provides excellent<br>
diastereoselectivity upstream and for the isolation in N-methylnaltrexone double ion<br>
form, and for the production of the desired final product, i.e. (R)-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the O-benzylnaltrexone may be<br>
advantageously obtained by reacting naltrexone hydrochloride, or base naltrexone,<br>
with benzyl bromide, in acetone, in the presence of potassium carbonate, the<br>
reaction medium being maintained at reflux, preferably at a temperature of about<br>
60°C, for about 2 hours, and then cooled to room temperature (about 20°C) in order<br>
subsequently to filter, and optionally wash with acetone, and the acetone is<br>
evaporated from the filtrate to obtain the desired compound in the form of an oil.<br>
Preferably, this oil is taken up, for example, in dichloromethane and washed, for<br>
example, with dilute (3%) sodium hydroxide.<br>
This liquid extraction in basic medium makes it possible to totally remove the<br>
residual non-benzylated naltrexone and to avoid the formation of the impurity 3-0-<br>
methyl-N-methylnaltrexone in the alkylation/quaternization step.<br>
The product may advantageously not be isolated, which makes it possible to<br>
avoid manipulating a medium containing benzyl bromide, which is a lachrymogenic<br>
and toxic product.<br><br>
Finally, in the process according to the invention, the naltrexone<br>
hydrochloride or the base naltrexone may be advantageously obtained by reacting<br>
noroxymorphone hydrochloride with bromomethylcyclopropane, in dimethyl-<br>
acetamide, in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate, the reaction medium<br>
being heated to a temperature of between 60 and 75°C and preferably between 65<br>
and 69°C, as described, for example, in step 1 of the process of Example 1.<br>
Figure 1 represents a theoretical diffractogram (or powder diagram),<br>
obtained from a monocrystal of the double ion, as described in Example 1 (part<br>
1.5.2).<br>
Figure 2 represents an experimental diffractogram (or powder diagram),<br>
obtained from the double ion, as described in Example 1 (part 1.5.2).<br>
The examples that follow are intended to illustrate the present invention, in a<br>
non-limiting manner, and should therefore not be interpreted as possibly limiting its<br>
scope.<br>
Unless otherwise mentioned, the NMR data below are obtained with TMS<br>
(tetramethylsilane) as reference.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of N-methvlnaltrexone bromide<br>
1.1 Preparation of crude base naltrexone (Step 1; N-alkylation)<br>
100 g (0.27 mol) of noroxymorphone hydrochloride, 80.8 g (0.96 mol;<br>
3.55 eq.) of sodium hydrogen carbonate and 300 mi of dimethylacetamide are<br>
successively introduced into a 500 ml reactor equipped with a condenser and a<br>
mechanical stirrer. The reaction medium is heated to between 65°C and 69°C.<br>
At the end of the observed evolution of gas (about 10 minutes), 35 ml of<br>
bromomethylcyclopropane (0.44 mol; 1.6 eq.) are introduced over 30 minutes while<br>
keeping the temperature at 69°C.<br>
The N-alkylation is complete in about 6 hours, and the reaction progress is<br>
monitored by HPLC analysis (residual content of noroxymorphone less than or<br>
equal to 0.5%). The reaction medium is cooled to 50°C and then poured with stirring<br>
over 1 hour into a mixture of 1000 ml of water and 100 g of sodium chloride<br>
preheated to 50°C.<br>
The pH is adjusted to 8.6-9 by addition of 8 ml of 30% sodium hydroxide.<br>
The product obtained is isolated by filtration at 15°C and dried in an oven under<br>
vacuum at 50°C for 14 hours.<br><br>
86 g of crude naltrexone are finally obtained (yield: 88.6%) (HPLC in<br>
accordance with the standard and in accordance regarding the 1H and 13C NMR and<br>
mass structures).<br><br>
1H NMR: (ppm; ± 0.01 ppm): 0.45 to 0.65 (2H, CH2 (20/21), unresolved<br>

Mass (chemical ionization (M + H)+ = 342.2<br>
1.2 Preparation of O-benzylnaltrexone (Step 2; O-Benzylation)<br>
5.0 g (0.014 mol) of naltrexone hydrochloride (the base may be used), 5.0 g<br>
(0.036 mol; 2.58 eq.) of potassium carbonate and 25 ml of acetone are successively<br>
added to a 50 ml reactor equipped with a condenser and a mechanical stirrer. 2.6 g<br>
(0.015 mol; 1.08 eq.) of benzyl bromide are then added over 10 minutes at 20C<br>
with stirring. The reaction medium is refluxed (60°C) for 2 hours and then cooled to<br>
20°C and filtered. The filter cake is washed with twice 25 ml of acetone.<br>
The acetone is evaporated off under vacuum and the residual oil is taken up<br><br>
in 40 ml of dichloromethane and then washed with 3 times 25 ml of dilute (3%)<br>
sodium hydroxide.<br>
This liquid extraction in basic medium makes it possible to totally remove the<br>
residual non-benzylated naltrexone and to avoid the formation of the impurity<br>
3-O-methyl-N-methylnaltrexone in the quaternization step 3.<br>
After performing separations of the phases by settling and extractions, the<br>
dichloromethane solution is concentrated until no further distillation takes place, and<br>
is then used in the following stage without further purification.<br>
The product is not isolated, to avoid manipulating a medium containing<br>
benzyl bromide, which is a lachrymogenic and toxic product.<br>
Structural analysis: a sample of the oil obtained is taken to isolate the<br>
O-benzylnaltrexone product in hydrochloride form (the O-benzylnaltrexone<br>
hydrochloride is obtained by dissolving the base in oil form in MTBE - or methyl<br>
tert-butyl ether - and adding 35% hydrochloric acid).<br><br>

The oil obtained in the preceding stage is dissolved in 20 ml of acetone and<br>
then poured at 20°C with stirring into a dry 50 ml reactor containing 1.3 g<br>
(0.015 mol; 1.08 eq.) of sodium hydrogen carbonate; 6.7 g (0.053 mol; 3.53 eq.) of<br>
dimethyl sulfate are then added over 10 minutes.<br>
The reaction medium is refluxed with stirring for a minimum of 72 hours until<br>
the O-benzylnaltrexone has totally disappeared (HPLC monitoring).<br>
The reaction medium is cooled to 20°C and then filtered.<br>
The filter cake is washed with twice 10 ml of acetone and then placed in<br>
basic solution (NaHCO3 or NaOH). This filtrate is stored at 20°C for use in the<br>
following stage without isolation.<br>
The product is not isolated, to avoid manipulating a product containing<br>
dimethyl sulfate. Similarly, the filter cake (NaHCO3 + dimethyl sulfate residue) is<br>
dissolved on the filter without isolation, with basic medium, so as to destroy the<br>
dimethyl sulfate and form sodium methyl sulfate (non-toxic).<br>
Structural analysis: a small amount of the product is taken up and purified by<br>
preparative chromatography in order thus to obtain a sample analysed as follows.<br><br><br>

By HPLC analysis, the existence of the (R) and (S) respective configurations<br>
with respect to the nitrogen atom is observed, in an R/S configuration ratio of<br>
96.6/3.4.<br>
1.4 Preparation of N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate (step 4:<br><br>
O-debenzylation)<br>
The above acetone solution is concentrated to one third, 100 ml of water are<br>
then added and the distillation under vacuum is continued until the acetone has<br>
been removed.<br>
After cooling to 20°C, the above solution is added to 5% palladium-on-<br>
charcoal (0.3 g).<br>
The reaction medium is then warmed to 40°C. Purging sequences (N2/H2)<br>
are performed, followed by establishing a pressure of 2.5 bar of hydrogen.<br>
The O-debenzylation is complete after about 2 hours, with monitoring by<br>
HPLC (content of N-methyl-O-benzylnaltrexone methyl sulfate less than 0.5%). The<br>
reaction medium is cooled to 20°C and filtered to remove the catalyst.<br>
The aqueous solution of N-methylnaltrexone methyl sulfate thus obtained is<br>
used directly in the following stage.<br>
The benzyl protecting group on the phenolic oxygen has a twofold<br>
advantage:<br>
-	cleavage without introduction and formation of an ionic product: only<br>
hydrogen is used, and the toluene formed is readily removed;<br>
-	hydrogenation makes it possible to reduce the amount of 7,8-didehydro-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone (conjugated ketone, thus warning structure) in the final<br>
product after hydrogenation of the double bond.<br>
The product is not isolated, to avoid contact with the residual dimethyl sulfate<br>
(highly toxic product).<br>
1.5 Preparation of N-methylnaltrexone bromide (step 5: methyl<br>
sulfate/bromide exchange)<br>
1.5.1 N-methylnaltrexone double ion (isolation of this compound)<br>
The aqueous solution from stage 4 is concentrated under vacuum until a<br>
residual volume of 30 ml is obtained, and 1 g of Na2CO3 is then added until a pH of<br>
about 9.5 to 9.8 is obtained (natural pH of sodium carbonate in water).<br>
The reaction medium is maintained at 20°C with stirring for 1 hour.<br>
The use of sodium carbonate in this step makes it possible in particular to<br>
destroy the dimethyl sulfate after 1 minute of contact.<br>
The insoluble matter formed is filtered off by suction, and it is thus seen that<br>
an N-methylnaltrexone double ion may exist under these particular pH conditions<br>
(with the use of sodium carbonate Na2CO3).<br><br>
Structural analysis: a portion of the suction-filtered insoluble matter obtained<br>
above is suspended in water at a pH of about 9.5 (which makes it possible to purify<br>
the double ion before analysis by "desalting") and is then isolated by suction<br>
filtration and drying.<br><br>

25.4 (C10); 30.2 (C8 or C7); 30.3 (C7 or C8); 47.0 (C13); 51.0 (C17); 55.5 (C16);<br>

C2): 124.1 (C3); 143.8 (C11 and C12); 147.8 (C12 and C11); 211.5 (C6).<br>
Mass (chemical ionization MH+) = 356<br>
Elemental analysis:<br>
-	theoretical calculated values (C 60.7%; H 7.68%; N 3.37%; O 28.24%)<br>
-	experimental values (C 61.64%; H 7.6%; N 3.19%).<br>
These two values take into account a water content of 14.45%, which may<br>
be interpreted in principle as a degree of hydration of a trihydrate form (3H2O).<br>
However, the following analyses were also performed.<br>
Analysis by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD):<br><br>
The analysis is performed in a D5005 diffractometer from the company<br>
Bruker. The angular range is between 2.00 and 40.00°28 in increments of 0.02°20<br>
and 2 seconds per increment. The generator is set at 50 kV-40 mA for a copper<br>
tube whose incident beam wavelength is 1.54056 A.<br>
The double ion purified by "desalting" as described above gives an<br>
experimental diffractogram (see Figure 2) that proves to be identical by comparison<br>
with a theoretical diffractogram corresponding to a dihydrate (2H2O) crystal<br>
structure. This theoretical diffractogram is obtained by simulation (see Figure 1;<br>
Mercury® software) from the results of a crystal study on a monocrystal of the same<br>
double ion purified by "desalting".<br>
The difference in degree of hydration obtained on a monocrystal (2H2O) and<br>
on the elemental analysis (3H2O) is explained by the presence of two molecules of<br>
water of crystallization in the structure of the crystal lattice and of one water<br>
molecule originating from the water of insertion into the microchannels of the<br>
crystals (water of impregnation).<br>
By HPLC analysis, the existence of the (R) and (S) respective configurations<br>
with respect to the nitrogen atom is observed, in an R/S configuration ratio of 98/2.<br>
1.5.2 N-methylnaltrexone bromide<br>
The preceding insoluble matter is suspended in 20 ml of an MeOH/water<br>
mixture (4/1), hydrobromic acid is added (qs pH = 3) and the reaction medium is<br>
then maintained at 60°C until the dissolution is virtually complete.<br>
The light insoluble matter (undissolved N-methylnaltrexone) is filtered off and<br>
the filtrate is then cooled to OX. The crude N-methylnaltrexone bromide crystallizes<br>
on cooling, and is then filtered off by suction.<br>
Recrystallization from a methanol/water mixture (of the N-methylnaltrexone<br>
bromide) or optional washing of the isolated product ("double ion") with an organic<br>
solvent (for example methanol) allows the lipophilic impurity O-benzyl-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone bromide to be removed.<br>
1.6 Preparation of pure N-methylnaltrexone bromide (step 6:<br>
recrystallization from acetone/water)<br>
5.6 g of crude N-methylnaltrexone bromide (dry), 7.5 ml of water and 22 ml<br>
of acetone (i.e. 5 volumes of an 80/20 acetone/water mixture) are successively<br>
introduced into a 50 ml reactor equipped with a condenser. The medium is refluxed<br><br>
for 15 minutes. The cloudy material (undissolved N-methylnaltrexone bromide) is<br>
filtered off while hot (60°C) and the hot filtrate is poured into 10 ml of acetone at<br>
50°C.<br>
The product precipitates in solution, the solution is cooled to -2°C and the<br>
precipitate is filtered off.<br>
The product is dried under vacuum at 20°C for 48 hours.<br>
4.3 g of pure N-methylnaltrexone bromide are finally obtained (76% yield<br>
relative to the crude N-methylnaltrexone bromide, and 70% yield relative to the<br>
starting naltrexone hydrochloride).<br><br>
Physical characteristics:<br>
Melting point: (DSC): 262°C<br>
1H NMR (ppm, ± 0.01): identical to Naltrexone except for: 3.7 (3H, C(22)<br>
singlet); 13C (ppm ± 0.01) identical to Naltrexone except for: 58 (C(22)).<br>
Mass: (chemical ionization): (M+H) = 356.3.<br>
Complies in all respects with the literature data.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of N-methylnaltrexone bromide (step 5: methyl<br>
sulfate/bromide exchange, variant without isolation of the intermediate<br>
The aqueous solution from step 4 of Example 1 is concentrated under<br>
vacuum until a residual volume of 30 ml is obtained, and 1 g of Na2CO3 is then<br>
introduced until a pH of about 9.5 to 9.8 is obtained (natural pH of sodium<br>
carbonate in water).<br>
The reaction medium is maintained at 20°C with stirring for 1 hour, 2.1 ml of<br>
48% hydrobromic acid are then added over 1 hour, i.e. down to a pH of about 1,<br><br>
and the reagents are left in contact with stirring for a further 1 hour.<br>
The insoluble matter of the reaction medium is filtered off by suction and this<br>
filter cake is washed with 10 ml of acetone and then dried in an oven under vacuum<br>
(10 mmHg) at 40°C for 12 hours.<br>
9.35 g of a mixture of crude N-methylnaltrexone bromide and of mineral salts<br>
(NaBr and NaMeSO4; titre of crude N-methylnaltrexone bromide; 50%) are<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of N-methylnaltrexone bromide (step 5: methyl<br>
sulfate/bromide exchange, variant without isolation of the intermediate, with<br>
MeOH)<br>
In step 5 of the process of Example 1, after treatment with HBr, 40 ml of<br>
methanol are added and the mixture is then maintained at 60°C until the dissolution<br>
is virtually complete. The light insoluble matter (undissolved N-methylnaltrexone<br>
bromide) is filtered off.<br>
The filtrate (MeOH/H2O mixture) is cooled to 0°C. The crude MNTX bromide<br>
crystallizes on cooling, and is then filtered off by suction.<br>
The major advantage of this variant is the solubilization of mineral salts<br>
(NaBr, NaCH3SO4) in the methanol/water mixture, whereas NaBr is slightly soluble<br>
in the ethanol/water mixture.<br><br>
