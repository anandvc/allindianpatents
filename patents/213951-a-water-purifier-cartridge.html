The  invention relates to a water purifier cartridge which oan be used with a container of water.<br>
Filtering and purifying drinking water has been an on going challenge. In many parts of the world, even municipal tap water is contaminated with bacteria and chemicals. Hence, many devices ranging from a simple ceramic filtration to more sophisticated systems like ultra violet, reverse osmosis, ozone etc. have been developed for home use.<br>
Outside the homeÂ» the problem of polluted water still exists. Spring water or filtered bottle water is some of the options for people to drink outside the home while travelling, in schools and work etc.<br>
The need for purified water while outside the home is so large that many products have been introduced in the market. These products range for users who would like the water to be oust filtered, or purify the tap water and some products are even designed for survival in wilderness purifying river and pond water- When it comes to personalize water filter or purifier, most of the products depend on the suction from the mouthpieces and or pressure on the bottle for the water to flow.<br><br>
us patent No.5156335 and US patent Ho.5045195 both! refer to drinking straw/tube. Both of these designs have a filter and purifier media in the tube and the user relies on suction at the mouthpiece to suck the water, US patent Ho.4151092, US patent Ho.5509605, US patent Ho,4995976, US patent Ho.4298475 and US patent No.4798671 all refer to portable filter and purifier, still relying on suction force for the water to flow. US patent No.5273649 refer to personal water purifier tube that relies on suction and pressure for the water to flow.<br>
Many products are in the market where the filter and or purifier are inside the water bottle. Most of these rely on pressure on the bottle for the water to flow. In most of these designs, the filter or the purifier unit is attached to the bottle cap. US patent No.4054526 has an external pressurizer for the water to flow through the system*<br>
US  patent  No.5688397,  US  patent  Ho.5518613,  US  patent 5431813  and US patent Ho,5545316 all relate to  filter/purifiers attached  to  inside of the bottle cap.  In  all  these  patents, water  flow  longitudinally from the bottom to the  top,  passing through filtration and purification mediums.  In all these cases, pressure must be applied on the bottle.  US patent  5609759  has the  purifier  attached  to the inside of the bottle  cap.   The design is such that the water flows radial into the purifier  and then  flow  through  the center hole to the top  of  the  bottle. Pressure must  be applied on the bottle for the water  to  flow. The purifier in the US patent 5609759 uses carbon block with pore size  in the range of 10 to 120 microns in size.<br><br>
*  The purifier  cartridge according to this  invention  is  a three-stage  system.   The first stage is a  hydrophillic porous plastic  sediment filter.  The pore size of the  sediment  filter can  be uniform or can range across the thickness of the filter. The second  stage  is a biocide molded  cylindrical part  or  a loosely  packed biocide media.  The third stage is molded  carbon block having center core opening through which the purified water flows.   The water is sucked in by the hydrophillic property of the sediment  filter  and  the water  flows  radially  into  the sediment  filter.  Water free of sediments  and  other  suspended particles  is then pushed into the biocide section  and  finally the carbon block sucks in the water into the hollow center  core-When  a container  fitted with such a purifier cartridge  is inverted,  purified water in the hollow center core flows  out through the  opening of the container by gravity.   By  applying slight  squeeze on the container, water flow through the  opening of the container without much pressure.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a water purifier cartridge comprising a hydrophylic porous plastic sediment filter in the form of a hollow tube closed at one end and open at the other end, a flat plastic disc placed inside the said sediment filter covering the inside portion of the closed end of the sediment filter to prevent water passing through the closed end of the sediment filter, a hollow biooide filter open at both ends and  made  of  a polymeric material placed  inside  the  sediment<br><br>
filt/?r with one end in contact with the said flat disc, a hollow carbon block open at both ends and placed inside the hollow biocide filter with one end in contact with the said flat plastic disc, open end of the assembly of the said sediment filter, the said biocide filter and the said carbon block being fixed to a cap with a center openning providing sealing between the cap and the assembly to prevent water flow through the joint between the cap and the assembly.<br>
The three-stage purifier cartridge according to the invention is constructed in the following way. The first stage sediment filter is manufactured using hydrophilic polyethylene preferably having a molecular weight in the range of 400^000 to 7,000,000 gn/mol. A cylinder having one end closed and one end open is made with the above range of material with thickness of the cylinder ranging preferably from 5 to 20 mm and having a central hollow core. The pore size of the sediment filter is preferably in the range from 5 to 15 microns. The prefered height of this sediment filter can range from 4 to 14 cms.<br>
The second stage is a biocide stage to disinfect bacteria and virus. The biocide can be preferably an iodine base ion exchange resin molded with a polymeric material to form a cylinder having openings on both ends. The thickness of the biocide filter is preferably ranging from 5 to 10 mm thick. Preferably the polymeric material is in the range of 20 to 70% of the total volume of the molded biocide filter.<br><br>
The  third stage is the carbon block to remove snell,  odor,<br>
and  even  trap any bacteria that has escaped  from the biocide 
second stage. The carbon block is preferably made with a pore size ranging from 0.2 to 5 microns. Surface charge is created on the polymeric binder such that the carbon block is very hydrophilic. The carbon block is manufactured preferably in a cylinder from with openings on both ends. The thickness of the carbon block is preferably in the range from 5mm to 15mm.<br>
The three stage elements are assembled as follows. A plastic disc is placed inside the bottom of the sediment filter. The biocide element that has opening on both sides is placed inside of the sediment filter. The carbon block with opening on both sides is placed inside of the biocide cylinder. The diameter of the three sections are such that all of them fit tight and there is no air gap between sections. The top part of the assembly is open and the heights of the three sections are such that at the top all are at even height.<br>
A cap is fitted, either bonded or sonic welded on to the top of the above assembly to form the purifer cartridge. The purifier cartridge can be made to fit into the inside of a container cap. The container cap has an opening for the purified water to flow. This opening can be opened and closed by either a conventional screw cap and or push/pull cap. The container cap with the purifier cartridge is screwed on to the container to form container which can supply purified water.<br><br>
To purify the water, remove the container cap, fill in the water to be treated, close the cap with the purifier cartridge. Tilt the container and with a small squeeze water will flow in the radial direction in to the purifier cartridge. The water first flows through the sediment filter, and all the suspended particles are removed in the stage. Water free of suspended particles flows into the second stage into the biocide element. Bacteria and virus are disinfected in this stage. Water free of suspended particles and bacteria flow into the third stage which is the carbon block. In this stage all odor, smell, oolor and any bacteria are removed. Clean purified water flows through the center opening of the carbon block into the opening the bottle cap.<br>
