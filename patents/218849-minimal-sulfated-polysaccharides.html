1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tins invention reiaics to methods for treating or preventing microbial infections in mammals using sulfated polysaccharides. Mors particularly, this invention relates to methods of introducing a therapeutically effective amount of a charged and flexible sulfated polysaccharide having a certain percent sulfation range into the blood stream, lymphatic system and/or extracellular spaces of a human patient for the treatment, prevention or management of microbial infections, In particular, wherein the range is effective to enable maximal interaction of the sulfate groups with the microbe which causes the infection, and wherein the sulfated polysaccharide is not substantially endocytosed or degraded by cell receptor binding in the mammal, and thereby retains antimicrobial activity in vivo.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Charged polysaccharides, particularly sulfated polysaccharides, ha.ve demonstrated potent antimicrobial activities in vitro. (Baha et al Antiviral Res 9L33S-343, 1988; Ito et ai., AnttviralRes. 7{36):l-367, 1987). For example, sulfated polysaccharides such as dextran sutfate, heparin, and pentosan polysulfate have been reported to be potent inhibitors of HIV, paramyxoviruses, cytomegaloviruses, influenza viruses, semlikiviruses (Luschcr-Mattlie et al.. Arch Virol 130J17-326, 1993) and herpes simplex viruses in viro (Baba et ai., Andmicrob. Agents Chemotherapy 32:1742-45, 1988: Pancheva, Antiviral Chem Chemotherapy 4;189191, 1993), However, these known compoundi have disappointtngly poor activity in vivo.<br>
Dextcan. sulfate and heparin 'were first reported to inhibit HIV eplication in vitro by Ito et ai.. Antiviral Res. 7:3(51-367,1987, Deringer er ai (US 5,153,181) and Ueno and Kuno Lancet 2:796-97, 1987. Later, several other sulfated polysaccharides were shown to inhibit HIV replication at concentrations believed to be below their respective cytotaxcicty thresholds, e.g., pentosan sulfate (Baba etaL, Antiviral Res 9:335-343, 19SS; Biesert et a!., Aids 2(6):449-57. 1988), fudodan (Baba ei aj.. Antiviral Res 9:335-343, 1988), lambda-, kappa- and iota-carrageenan (Baba et al., Antiviral Res 9: 335-343, 1988), lentinan sulfate fYoahida et aL.Biockem- Pharmacol 37(15):2gg7-91, 1988), mannan sulfate pto et al, Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol Infect. Dis. S; 19M 93, 1989), dextrin sulfate (llo el al Antiviral<br><br>
Chem. Chemother.. 2:41-44. \99lXsa\Â£osvemBn(Wei\sr eiaL, J Gen P7ro/71:1957-1963,<br><br><br>
herpes virus as in EP Application 0 066 379 A2 with limited success. See also, Pancheva SN, Antiviral Chem Chemotherapy 4:189-191, 1993.<br>
One of the major reasons that dextran sulfate may pot be active in vivo is that the material is not stable. Some indicationof this has been published previously. Tritium labeled dextran sulfate mw 8,000 appeared to be depolymerised while in the blood circulation of rats over a 6-24 h pcriod (Hartman KR, lohas DG, Mitsuya H. AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 6: S05-S1!, 1990). lodinated heparin and pentosan polysulphatc are rapidly cleared from the circulation in man and returned in a desulfated fenn (MacGregor IR, Dawes J, Paton L, Pepper DS, Prowse CV, Smith M., Tkramb Haem 51 ;321 -325, 1984).<br>
Considerablc effort has been focused on improving the in vivo anti-viral activity of dextran sulfate by increasing its sulfation or modifying the use of conveotional material. In one study, given the reported poor absorption of oral dextran sulfate, dextran sulfate was administered to a maximally tolerated dose by continuous infusi on to subjects with symptomatic HTV infection for up to 14 days. (Flexner et al/.. Antimicrob Agents Chemotherapy 35:25A4-25$0, 1991). Continous intravenous infusion of dextran sulfate was found to be toxic. The authors concluded that as a result of its toxicity and lack of any demonstration of beneficial effect in vivo, dextran sulfate is unlikely to have a beneficial effect in the treatment of HIV. Id. Indeed, the authors cautioned: "further clinical dcvelopment of parental dextran sulfate as therapy forsymptomatic, HIV infection is not warranted and could prove to be hazardous. On the basis of the results of this study, caution is advised in the clinical evaluation of other polysnliatcd polyanions." (Id. at 2549).<br>
In a major study of the processing of dextran sulfete by glomerular endothelial cells. Applicant discovered that dextran sulfate binds to a cell surfece receptor that would normally recognize highly sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin-like polysaccharides. On binding the dextran sulfate is endocytosed, desulfated but not depolymerised by lysosome sulfeteses and exocytosed as desulfeted dextran sulfate (Vyas et al. Arch Biochem Biophys. 332(2):20S 12,1996). It was found that the uptake and cndocytosis of dextran sulfete by the eel) was critically depMideot on the sulfur content or degree of sulfate substitution per glucose residue. Above 13% sulfur uptake by glomercular endothelial cells wassignificant where as below 13% sulfur uptake by glomerular endothelial This means that charged polysacchari des with a particular critical sulfater content or critical sulfate substitution charge density along the polysacdiaride chain may be processed differently by cells to which the circulation is exposed.

5.2       PERIODATE TREATED AND CO-CHARGED ANIONIC POLYSACCHABIDES<br>
Tbe invention encompasses sulfeted polysaccharides that have been manipulated to reduce endocytosis by ceil receptors and to increase the flexibility of the polysaccharide backbone to enable the efficient presentation of aniomic charged groups to interact with regions on the targeted microbes.<br>
One manipulation encompassed by the present invention is the treatment of sulfeted polysaccharides with periodate. Periodate-treated anionic polysaccharides have increased flexibility due to periodate oxidation of some or all sugar residues. This treannent allows increased freedom of rotation and confoimational flexibility of the polymers and provide flexible joints to facilitate biological interactions, Periodate-treated sulfated polysaccharides of the invention can have any cottnten'on to ensure soiubiJity including, but not limited to sodium, calcium, quaternary ammonium, and potassium.<br>
Materials which may be periodate treated and used within the methods and compositions described herein also include the polysaccharides of Table 1 below.<br>
Other variations include the incorporation of non-sulfate groups, such ss carboxyroethyi groups and sulfonate groups. By lowering the degree of substitution of charge on the polysaccharide with either sulfonate or carboxymethyl groups, the ability of the polysaccharide to be endocyciosed by high charge reactor is greatly reduced, therefore increasing its plasma stability. Carboxymethyl dextran sulfate can be prepared using a modification of methods of preparation employed by others {McLaughlin and Hirbst, Con./.iees.28B: 731-736,1950; Brovm et al Arktv Kemi 22:189-206 1964). Approximately 20g of dextran is slurried in a mixture of iBopnqjanol (35Dml} and 3.85M NaOH (40ml&gt;aDd is stirred for five minutes at 5Â°C in a blender. Sodium chloroacetate (t 8g) is added, and the whole mixture is stirred for 60 minutes at S^C under a nitro^n atniospbere, the mixture is removed fiom the blender and stored at 25"C for three days. The degree of carboxymethyl substitution can be adjusted by varying the time at 25'C from I day to 3 days as well as varying the mole ratio of CICHiCOONa to anhydrogjncose from<br><br><br>

SA.6   Mucosal Dosage Forms<br>
Mucosal dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, sprays and aerosols, or otherforms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g-.. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, l8theds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosags Forms, 4tli ed., I^a &amp; Febiger, Pbiladeiphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be fbnnulated as mouthwashes or as orai gels. In one embodiment, the aerosol comprises a carrier. In anothea: embodiment, the aerosol is carrier free.<br>
The sulfated polysaccharides of the mvention may also be administered directly to the lung by inhalation. For administration by inhaJanon, a sulfeled polysaccharide can be conveniently dehvcred to the lung by a number of different devices. For example, a Metered Dose Inhaler ("MDF') -which utilizes canisters that contain a suitable low boiling pTOpellant, e.g., dichlorodiQuoromethaae, trichlorofluoromethane, dichJorotelrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas can be used to deliver a suifeted polysaccharide directly to the Jung.  MDI devices are available from a ohmber of stqjpUers such as 3M Corporation, Aventis, Bnehiinger Ingieheim, Forest Laboratories, Glaxo-Wellcome, Schering Plough and Vectura.<br>
-Mlematively, a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) device can be used to administer a sulfated polysaccharide to the lung {see, e.g., Raleigh et al., Prac. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 1999, 40, 397, which is herein incorporated by reference), DPI devices typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create a cloud of dry powder inside a container, which can then be inhaled by the patient. DPI devices are also well known in the art and can be purchased fom a number of vendors which include, for gxample, Fisons, Glaxo-Wellcome, Inhale Therapeutic Systems, ML Laoratories, Qdose and Vectura. A popular variation is the multiple dose DPI ("MODPr") system, which allows for the delivery of more than one therapeitic dose. MDDPI devices are available from companies such as AstraZeneca, Glaxo Wellcome, WAX, Schering Plough, SkyePharma and Vectura, For example, capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an<br><br>
liquid such as alcoiioi, water, polyethylene glycol or a perfluorocarfcon. OptionaUy, another<br>
material may be added to alter the aerosol properties of the solution or suspension of<br><br>
sulfated polysaccharide. Preferably this material is liquid such an an alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or a fatty acid. Other methods of formulating liquid drug solutions or<br><br><br>
skilled in the phannaceutical arts, and depend of the particular site or method which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be administered. With that feet in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited to, were, ethanol ethylene glycol, propyjene glycol, butane-l,3-d2ol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, oiinerai oil, and mixtures thereof, which are non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Examples of such additional ingredients are well known in the art. See, e.g., Rcinington's Phannaceutical ScienceIStii eds., Mack Publishing,Easton PA (1990).<br>
The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or ofthe tissue to which the phsnnacetitical composition or dosage form is applied, can also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients.  Similarly, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added lo pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition,<br>

6.4       Example 4:    In vivo anti-viral activity<br>
The in VIVO anti-viral activity of dextran. sulfate and variants of sulfeted dextrans was assessed in a pharamacokinetic study involving single intravenous doses of 60 mg/kg commercially available (~I7% sulfor) dextran sulfate (DS) of 40,000 mw (groupi); DS I      500,000 mw (group 2); dextran sulfate (12.2% sulfete)(DES6) 40,000 mw (group 5); DES6 500,000 mw (group 4) given to three male and three female rats and a multi-day injection of<br><br>
60 tng/kg DES6, 500,000 mw given to an additional group of three rats (group 5). Rats were Sprague-Dawley, previously cannolatcd in the vena cava. Blood was drawn at various tinies after iajectioo and assessed for and-HlV activity in an acute infectivity cytoprotcction assay system utilizing HTV-1 RF virus with CEN-SS cells using fee MTS staining mettiod forccO viability (based on Witvrouw er a/â J. Acqur. Immun.Def. Syndr., 3:343-347, 1990). The results shown in Figure 2 indicate that DS was, as expected, highiy toxic at ^le&amp;e doses with only one lat surviving beyond 24 hours. In contrast, good survival and circulattag anti-HTV activity for as long as ]20iiouiBafler injection were observed in Che DES6 Ireat&amp;d rats.<br>
Figure 2 represents summary daia from the five groups of animais. Each data point Ttyresents the concentration of circulatiEg antiwrai aclivily at tiroes after injectioa. CoDcentration was calculated by determintcig the IC50 of confound in the blood. As can be calculated from the raw data. DES6 of both rnolecular weights showed a prolonged half-life in the biood of between 12 and J S hours, and an extended and-viral activity (circulating concentration above the ICso) beyond 72 hours. With three repeated injectjons of group 5 animals a steady state concentratiQn was reached. Results are expressed in Figure 2.<br>
The data indicate that any mortality associated with DES5 was probably due to complications associated wn'th the cannulatjon, since the MTD in noo-cannulated animals is &gt;850nig/kg.<br>
6.5       Example 5:    Effect on Pro-thrombin/Tlirombin and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time<br>
As noted above, inhibition of coagulation has been a repeatedly observed side effect of sulfated polysaccharide treatment, particularly with conventional dextran sulfate treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of DES6 compared to commercially available DS on prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)- All ^)ecimeDs were "spiked" wifli the test compound prior to submission to a CUnical Pathology Laboratory, The specimens were delivered along with reconstituted human plasma purchased from Sigma, Immediately prior to analysis 600 ^1 of tiie Sigma homan plasma was added to each spechnciL<br>
A Bio-Mcrieiw Coag-A-Male MTX II Analyzer was used to measure Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT)- The PT reageni: used was Simplastin L and the APTT reagent used was Platelin L; all reagCTits were obtained from<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Maximum Tolerated Dose<br>
The multiple toxicity dose (MTD) of DES6 was assessed in &amp; series of experiments where groups of five rats were given 100 or 200 mg/kg doses of DES6 mw= 500,000. Body weight and overall behavioral assessments were determined for five days after injection. There wens no overt signs of toxicity as determined by observation and "body weight measurements. Subsequently rats were given a 500 mg/kg injection and observed for a further five days also without signs of toxicity. Finally animals were given a dose of 850 mg/kg. Results are provided below in Table 4-<br><br>
6,6      Example 6:    In vitro anti-viral assessment of sulfated polysaccharides<br>
The studies included assessment of five test compounds at a high test concentration of 5O0 ng/ml in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PSMCs)-<br>
Methods<br>
All test compounds #3 (dextran sulfate 17-20%), #4 (sulfated dextran, 9.5% sulfiu-, molecular weight 30.000), and #6 (sulfated dexhan, 12.2% sulfur, molecular weight 36,000) were aolubilized in H2O at 40 mg/ml. The compounds were visually completely soluble and colorless. Compound were light protected and assays were performed in a maimer which minimized incidental light. Compounds were stored at -20Â°C following solvation-<br><br>
Viruses<br>
The low passage pediatric isolate RoJo was derived in fee laboratories of Southern Research Institute. RoJo is a presumed subtype B virus.<br>
PSMC Isolation and Blasting<br>
Peripheral blood monocular cells CPBMCs) were obtained from normal hepatitis and HlV-1 negative donors by ficoll hypaque gradient separation. The mononuclear cells were washed to remove residual gqsaration media, counted, viability determined and resuspended in RPM3 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS (heat inactivated), 2 mM L-ghitamine, l00U/mLpenicillin, 100 Î¼ g/mL streptoycin, and 10 Î¼ g/mL gentamycin with 2 Î¼ gi'mL phytohemagluttin (PHA) at 1 X 10 cells/mL, The cells were cultured for 48 to 72 h at 37Â°C, 5% CO;. Following incubation, cells were collected by centrifiiguation, washed and resuspended in RPMI1640 supplemented with 15%KBS (heaiinactivaied), 2 mML-glutamine, 100 U/mL peniciljin, 100 fig/mL streptomycin, and 10 Î¼ g/mL gentamycin with 20 U/mL recombinant 11^- R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). IL-2 was included in the culture medium to maintain the cell division initiated by the PHA mitogenic stimulation. The cultures were then maintained until use by 1/2 culture volume change with fresh 11^2 containing medium every three days.<br>
PBMCAssay<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a minimum of two donors, that have been blasted with PHA and IL-2, were counted, viability determined by Trypan Blue dye exclusion and mixed in equal ratios. Pooled donors were used to minimize the variability observed between individual donors which results from quantitative and qualitative differences in HTV infection and overall response to the PHA and IL-2 of primary lymphocuyte populations. The cells were resuspended at 1 x 106 cells AnL in RPMl 1640 without pheno! red supplemented with 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (heat inactivated), 2 mM L-glutamine, l00U/mLpenicillin, l00/tg/mLstreptoinycin, 10 ;Î¼ g/mL gentamycin and 11^2 (20 U/mL, R&amp;D Systans, Minneapolis, MN). Fifty microliters of cells were then distributed to the inner 60 wells of a 96 well round bottom microtiter culture plate in a standard format developed by the Infectious Disease Research department of Southern Research Institute. Each piate contains cell control wells (cells only), virus control wells (cells plus virus), and experimental wells (drug plus cells plus virus). Serially dihited compounds were added to the microtiter plate followed by the appropriate prehtered<br><br>
dilution of HIV- I RoJo, ,All samples were assayed in triplicate with a replicate plate without vims for the determination of compound toxicity. The final volume per well was 200 Î¼ L. The assay was incubated for 6 days in a humidified atmosphere at 37C, 5% CO2, after which supermatants were collected, for analysis of RT activity and sister plates analyzed for cell viability by MTS dye reduction- Wells were also examined microscopically and any abnormalities noted.<br>
MTS Staining for Cell Viability<br>
At assay termination the assay plates were stained with the soluable tetrazolium-based dye MTS (CellTiter96Â® Reagent Promega) to determine cell viability and quantify compound toxicity. MTS is metabolized by the mitochondria enzymes of metabolically active cells to a soluable formazan product allowing the rapid quantitative analysis cell viability and compound cytotoxicity. This reagent is a single stable solution that does not require preparation before use. At termination of the assay 20 Î¼ L of MTS reagent was added per well and incubated for 4 h at Â°C. Adhesive plate sealers were used in place of the lids, the sealed plate was inverted several times to mix the soluble forman product and the plate was read spectrophotmnetrically at 490 am with a Molecular Devices Vmax plate reader.<br>
Reverse Transcriptase Assay for Culture Supernatants<br>
Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was measured in cell-free supernatants. Tritiatcd thymidine triphosphate (NEN) (TTP) was resuspended in distilled HzO at 5 C/mL. Poly rA and oligo dT were prepared as a stock solution which was kept at -20Â°C. The RT reaction buffer was prepared fresh on daily basis and consists of 125 pi-1.0 MEGTA, 125 ^ dH20, 110Î¼ L 10% SDS, 50Î¼  LOMTris(pH 7.4), 50Î¼ A.OM DTT, and40Î¼ L 1.0M MgCb. These three solutions were mixed together in aratio of two parts TTP, one part poly rAjoligo dT, and one part reaction buffer. Ten microliters of this reaction mixture were placed in a round bottom microtiter plate and 15 Î¼ l of virus containing supermatantt was added and mixed. The plate was incubated at 37Â°C in a water bath with a solid support to prevent submersion of the plate and incubated for 60 minutes- Following  reaction, the reaction volume was spotted onto pieces of DE81 paper, washed 5 times ibr 5 minutes each in a 5% sodium phosphate buffer, two times for one minute each in distilled water, two times for one minute each in 70% ethanol, and then dried. Opti-Fluor O was added to each<br><br><br><br>

Table 5 compares the previous and current antivirai evaluations in PBMCs. The previously identified ICM and antiviral efficacy of DK 17-20% Sulfation was verified with an IC5o of 0.5 Î¼ g/IQl m Ihese Experiments. This is within the standard 3-fo)d error predicted for the PBMC assay. In addition, the second experiment demonstrated that compound #3 is non-cytotoxic to PBMCs at 500 (Î¼ g/ml.<br>
In this set of evaluation the initial antiviral assessments of DES 9.5% Sulfation and DES 12.5% Sulfation were performed Both compounds were non-cytotoxic at 500 /ig/ml and 50% iohihitory concentrations were derived. DES 12.5% Sulfetion displayed antiviral activity equivalent to DES 17-20% Sulfclion based upon the calculated ICjo, 1.6 vs. 0.5 Î¼ g/ml, respectively. Additionally, examination of the antivirai efficacy curves suggests diat the 2 compounds are of equal potency. In contrast, DES 9.5% Sulfation v/as 39-fold less active than DES 17-20% Sulfation and 12-foid less active Than DES 12.5% Sulfation.<br>
6.7       Example 7:    In vitro anti-viral assessment of sulfated polysaccharides<br>
Tte following compound have been tested for in vitro anti viral activity.  Sample 3(dextran sulfate, I7 -20% sulfur, molecular weight 39,700), sample 4 (dextran sulfate, 9.5% sulfur, moiecular weight 30,000) and sample 6 {dextran sulfate, 12.2% sulfur, molecular weight 36,000). All three compounds exhibited significant anti-viral activity .   against HIV-l RoJo virus.<br>
DES 9.5% Sulfation and DES 12.5% Sulfation were also assessed against a range of HIV-I clinical isolates, including subtype representative isolates, SIV and HTV-Z The inhibition of HTV-IADA and BaL replication in monocyte/macrophages was also assessed,<br>
DES 9.5% Sulfation and DES 12.5% Sulfation were prepared as described above in Example 4.<br><br><br><br>
Mutations in bold face type in Table 7 represent  key resistance mutations in the indicated genes.<br>
PBMC Isolation and Blasting<br>
Peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMCs) were obtained as described in Example<br>

PSMCAssay<br>
PBMC assays were carried out as described in Example 6.<br>
Monocyte isolation, culture and infection<br>
Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from normal HIV-) negative donors by plastic adherence following ficol hypaqne purification of the baffy coat, as described above for PBMCs. In many cases the same donor used to produce the PBMC populations was also used to produce monocyte/macrophages, however unlike PBMC population monocyte/macrophage, donors were never pooled. Following a two hour adliereDce in RPMI1640 without phenol red supplemenf ed with 10% human pooled AB serum (heat inactivated), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin. 100 Î¼ g/mL streptomycin, 10 Î¼ g/mL gentaraycin, cultures were washed to remove non-adherem cells. The monocytes were released from the plastic by vigorous pipetting with Ca^2 and Mg2" free PBS. Adherent cells were assessed for purity by nonspecific esterase staining (a-napthyl butyrate specific esterase. Sigma Chemical Co.), and/or liability by Trypan Blue dye exclusion, counted and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (heat inactivated). 2 mM L-giutamine, 100U/mL pemciih'n, 100 Î¼ g/mL streptomycin, 10Î¼ g/tnl. gentamycin at 1 X 106 monocytes per ml. The monocytes (1 x 105 per 0.2 cm well) were then cultured for six days, allowing maturation of the cells to a macrophagehlike phenotypc. At day six Gie cultures were washed three times to remove any non-adherent cells and serially diluted test compounds added followed by Hie addition of a pre-litered amount of HTV-l vims, if microscopic observation of the wells demonstrated a 70% or greater confluency of tiie monocyte/macrophage monolayer. Cultures were washed a final time by media removal 24 hours post infection, fresh compound added and the cultures continued for an additional six days. The assays were preformed using a standardized microtrter plate format, which uses only the inner 60 wells of a 96 well plate for assay pmposes. The outers contain media and acts an a evaporation barrier. Each plate contains cell control weils (cells only), vims<br><br>
control wells (ceils phis virus), and experimental wells (drug plus cells plus virus). HIV p24 antigen contents to assess vims replication was measured at assay termination by a commercially available p24 ELISA assay (Coulter) OD cell-free supematants, and compound cytotoxicity by MTS dye reduction. AZT, HIV-1 reverse nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor and dextransuliate, an attachment inhibitor, were used as positive control compounds and ma in parallel with each determined. At termination of the assay culture plates were rercoved from -the incubator and observed microcopically. Any uniqueindings were noted.<br>
MTS staining for cell viability<br>
MTS staining was carried out as described in Example 6.<br>
Reverse Transcripiase Assay fur Culture Supematants<br>
Reverse transcriptase (R.T) activity was measured in cell-free supematants as described in Example 6.<br>
P24 Antigen ELISA<br>
ELISA kits were purchased from Coulter Electronics, The assay was performed according to the manuactures instructions. Controi curves were generated in each assay to accurately quantitate the amount of p24 antigea in each sample. Data were obtained by spectrophotometric analysis at 450 pm using a Molecular Devices Vmax plate reader. Final concentrations were calculated from the optical density values using the Molecular Devices Soft Max software package,<br>
Result<br>
ICso (50%, inhibition of virus replication), TCsj (50% reduction in cell viability) and a therapeutic index (TI, TC5o.'ICso) were calculated- The results are Eunmiarized in Table 8,<br>
The antiviral data for each test include die relevant raw data vahies from tiie triplicate tests for virus replication (RT (cpm) for PBMCs and p24 (pg/ml) for monocytes) and cell viability (OD 490) for MTS dye reduction. The IC50 and TC50 values were calculated by linear recession. The TI represents the ratio of the ICsrACso, and is used to determine relative potency between compounds. The graphical representation shows the relationship between antiviral efficacy (%VC) find compound toxicity (%CC) expressed as a percent of the control, virus no compound or ceils no compound, respectively.<br>
TABLE 8:  Summary of the Range of Action Testing<br><br><br><br>
active against the broad range of RTV- 1 isolates tested, as weii as displaying activity against a multi-drug resistant virus , SIV and HIV-2, This, these compounds are broadly anti-retro viral.<br>
DBS 12.5% Sulfation was active against all viruses tested. It was least active against the subtype C (IC5010.3 Î¼ g/ml) and G (IC5011,7Î¼ g/ml) viruses. It also efficicenty inhibited tbc replication of HIV-! ADA, DBS 12.5% Sulfation also displayed good antiviral activity with a clinical isolate of HIV-2 and the SIVmacZS 1 isolate of SIV. It also displayed significant activity against the muiti-drug resistant virus isolate MDR.769. Thus, DES 12.5% Sulfation is active against a broad range of HIV-l clinical isolates, multi-drug resistant viruses and other retroviruses.<br>
DES 9.5% Sulfetion showed a heterogeneous response (variation in IC50) to the various viruses tested with activity ranging from inactive to active, DES 9.5% Sulfation has been previously demonstrated to be less active than DES 12.5% Suifetion in HTV-l RoJo infecied PBMCs, and this difference was again demonstrated here (37'foid less active). Examination of the antiviral curves for those viruses (ADA and Ba-L and the subtype G virus) for which DES 9.5% Sulfation was inactive suggests that it would be active at higher test concentrations. DES 9.5% Sulfation was also active against the MDR769 HIV-I strain (ICso 13 Î¼ g/ml) and a clinical isolate ofHIV-2(IC5o 5.1 Î¼ g/ml). Thus, despite lower over all potency it is still highly potent against multi-drug resistant HIV-l and HIV-2.<br>
DES 9.5% Sulfation and DES 12.5% Sulfation were tested against a range of HIV-I clinical isolated and two other retroviruses (HlV-2 and SIV-l) and found to be broadly anli-retroviral. Additionally, these results show thai the compounds are active against a resistant clinical isolate carryicg the T215 Y mutation for multi-drug resistance to R.T inhibitors. The data also demonstrated that although DES 12.5% Sulfation was more potent than DES 9.5% Sulfation on an IC50 basis, their range of IC50s on the panelof viruses were comparafaic. Thus, it is likely that both inhibit virus reT)licatiQQ via a coit^arable roechanism of action. Finally, the demonstration that the compoynds are actrve against HIV-2 and SIV-l show that they arc applicable to other retroviruses.<br>
6.8       Biodistribution of 3 Compound of the Invention<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh NC;<br>
ca. 377-402g) were dosed with [3H]Des6 40K by intravenous bius or oral gavage<br><br>
administration. Distrubtion of total critium content in plasma, lymph, and cervical lymph nodes was quantitated in samples collected at 6 or 12 hours following dosing.<br>
The study design is outlined in Table 9. Rats were divided into three treatment administration groups. Doses were formulated in phosphate buffered saline vehicle (pH= 7.4) so as to deliver them in approximate volumes of 1 .S mL/kg (iv) and 2.1 ml/kg (oral gavagc).<br>
Prior to the time of biologicsi sample collection at 6 or 12 hours ailer dosing, animals were anesthetized with kctamine/xylazine (7:1, ca. 120 mg/kg), and the thoracic lymphatic duct was cannnlated as described in Waynforth, H.B. and Fleckneil, PJV, (1992). Experimental and Surgicai Technique in the Rat, 2nd ed.. Academic Press, New York.  At the time of sample analysis, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and lymph was collected via the lymphatic duct cannula. Blood was processed for plasma by centrifiigation at ca. lOOOg for 10 minutes. Cervical lyn^h nodes were collected from each animal ai times specified in Table 9. Except where noted, total radioactivity was quantitated LD duplicate by hquid scintillalion spectrometry for a3J hio!og!c;al samples collected.<br><br><br>
Results of the study are described in Table 10- In addition to listing total radiokbel content in plasma, lymph aad lymph nodes; the lympb:plasma and lymph noderplaama ratios are also provided for each animal. Overall, concentration of [3H]De6 40K associated total radioactivity were higest in animals treated by iv administration, compared with oral administration, with higest concentrations in plasma and lymph at 6 h compared with 12 h- Plasma and lymph ['HlDesfi 40K-eq concentrations at 12 h were approximately 1-2% of (hose obtained at 6 b. However, the concentrations of total radioactivity in lymph nodes were sirailar between these two time points following iv administration. Anima! G961 in Group 2, died fbiiowing anesthesia and prior to cannuladon of the thoracic duct for collection of lymph. "lymph could not be collected from this animal; however plasma and iymph nodes were harvested for quantitation of totai radioactivity. Total radioactivity in these collected biological media were found to be significantly greater than the other two rats thai survived througtout the surgery. Lymph nodes in this animal ware observed to be larger than the other two animals in Group 2.<br>
Following oral administration of ["'HIDes6 40K, concentrations of plasma total radioactivity were comparable lo those obtained at 12 h following iv administration. Mean total radioactivity in lymph following oral administration was approximately 63% of those obtained at 12 h after iv administration; while total radioactivity in lymph nodes was only approximately 0-4% of those obtained following iv administration.<br>
The lymph:plasma ratios increased in rats between the 6- and 12-h time points following iv administration (compare 0.14 and 0,54 vs. 1,7 and 1.3 for the 6- and 12-h time points, respectively), as plasma total radioactivity signiScantly decreased. The iymph/plasma ratios following oral administration were approximately one, indicating equal distributioii of total radioactivity in these two media at 12 h.<br>
The lymph node:pIasma ratios iocreased to a much greater extent at the 12-h time point compared with those obtained W 6 h. The increase over time was much grater than those obtained in lymph over the same time course. These data suggest that [^H]De86 40K associated radioactivity distributes to a large degree into lymph nodes and that the rate of elimination from this tissue is slow.<br>
In contrast, the distribution profile to lymph nodes was different following oral administiation, where the lymph node;plasma were only approximately 0.50-0.82, and demonstrate less distribution of total radioactivity into lymph nodes by the oral route.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
