				<td>The present invention relates to a quinolone derivative having a 3-aminopyrrolidinyl group.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
This invention relates to a quinolone synthetic antibacterial drug which is useful as a drug for human, animals, or fish, or as a antibacterial preservatives.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002]<br>
Since discovery of norfloxacin, antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of quinolone synthetic antibacterial drugs (including those containing pyridobenzoxazine skeleton) have been greatly improved, and, today, they are used in chemotherapy for infections including almost all systemic infections, and a large number of drugs are in clinical use (see Patent document 1 or 2).<br>
[0003]	<br>
However, bacteria exhibiting low sensitivity for quinolone synthetic antibacterial drugs have been recently increasing in its number in clinical field. For example, bacteria which are resistant to drugs other than quinolone synthetic antibacterial drugs, and which also exhibit low sensitivity to quinolone synthetic antibacterial drugs are increasing such as Gram positive coccus like Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and. pneumococcus (PRSP) insensitive to ÃŸ-lactam antibiotics and enterococcus (VRE) insensitive to aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs. Accordingly, there is a strong clinical demand for a drug exhibiting an improved effectiveness to Gram positive coccus.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the meanwhile, antibacterial activity of recently developed quinolone synthetic antibacterial compounds are by far stronger than former quinolone synthetic antibacterial compounds (see Patent documents 3 or 4) . However, many such quinolone compound having high antibacterial activity have been reported to produce side effects based on physiological or pharmacological action not observed in the former quinolone synthetic antibacterial compounds.  For example, restrictions are imposed on<br>
the administration of some compounds due to side effects such as development of abnormal blood glucose level, cardiotoxicity, or delayed allergy, or development of convulsion, and development and use as a drug have been abandoned in some compounds.  In other words, many compounds have been found to be insufficient in their suitability as a drug due to the strong side effects despite their high antibacterial activity. Accordingly, a drug design methodology which is different from former compounds is required to thereby prevent the situation that a highly antibacterial compound can not be developed as a drug due to production of side effects. In other words, a design methodology is required that is capable of producing a compound which has a considerably high antibacterial activity comparable or similar to those of the conventional compounds, and at the same time, which is provided with suitability for a drug that allows use of the compound as a drug, for example, high safety without side effects. <br>
[0005]<br>
Exemplary side effects which have been reported for the quinolone synthetic antibacterial agents include induction of convulsion associated with concomitant use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, central action (relatively light central nerve disorders such as reeling, headache, and insomnia as well as serious side effects such as development of lethal convulsion), phototoxicity (photosensitivity), hepatotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (an abnormality observed as an abnormality of electrocardiogram which induces lethal arrhythmia), delayed allergy, and abnormal glucose blood level (see Non-patent documents 1 to 3). <br>
[0006]<br>
Of the side effects as mentioned above, significant recently reported clinical cases involve cardiotoxicity (a heart abnormality inducing lethal arrhythmia which is observed as an abnormality of electrocardiogram with prolonged QT or QTc interval). Some commercially available quinolone antibacterial agents have been reported to produce clearly prolonged QT or QTc interval including some serious cases (abnormality of electrocardiogram inducing lethal arrhythmia) (Non-patent documents 1 to 3). Also reported are side effects such as induction of rash, which is a esult of delayed allergy, and abnormal blood glucose level.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, in order to enable use the quinolone antibacterial agent as a human or animal drug, there is a demand for a quinolone synthetic antibacterial agent which is provided with an improved safety with weaker side effects such as induction of convulsion associated with concomitant use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, central action, phototoxicity (photosensitivity), and hepatotoxicity, as well as side effects such as cardiotoxicity, delayed allergy, and abnormal glucose blood level.  In other words, there is a strong demand for a quinolone compound simultaneously provided with a strong antibacterial activity and selective toxicity.<br>

MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0009] - [0011]<br>
The inventors of the present invention have conducted investigation by focusing on a compound which has 3-aminopyrrolidinyl group at position 7 or equivalent position of a quinolone compound.  In the course of the investigation, the<br>
inventors found that a quinolone compound having an 3-aminopyrrolidinyl group which is tri- or tetra- substituted at positions 3 and 4 represented by the following formula:<br>
(Formula I Removed)<br>
which has substituent which is typically an aliphatic substituent on the carbon atom at position 3, and one or two substituents which are also typically an aliphatic substituent on the carbon atom at position 4 has a broad spectrum of strong antibacterial activity for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including drug resistant Gram positive cocci such as multiple drug resistant pneumococcus having the resistance for quinolone. The inventors also found that such quinolone compound has not only such high antibacterial activity but also lower cardiotoxicity compared to the quinolone antibacterial drugs whose cardiotoxicity has recently been reported in clinical practice as a side effect of the quinolone antibacterial drugs.  It was also found that this compound has reduced risk of producing side effects such as delayed allergy and abnormal blood glucose level.  It was also found that this compound has excellent oral absorptivity, organ permiability, and excretion rate in urine.

Synthesis of the optically active compound can be conducted, for example, by optical resolution using an appropriate intermediate, for example, by HPLC resolution using a chiral column of the appropriate intermediate, preferential crystallization of the diastereomer salt, or by bonding chiral building block to an appropriate intermediate to produce a diastereomer, separating the diastereomer by using an appropriate separation technique such as silica gel chromatography, and removing the chiral building block to produce an optically active substance. Alternatively, the optically active compound may be synthesized by using the chiral building block for the starting material . <br>

In the formula, Boc represents tertiary butoxycarbonyl group, Cbz represents benzyloxycarbonyl group, R10 represents an alkyl<br>

[0077]<br>
Step 1 is a step wherein 3-alkoxycarbonyl-3-methyl-4-substituted pyrrolidine derivative (3) is synthesized by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition by using 3-substituted crotonate ester (1) and azomethine ylide (2) for the reaction blocks. The azomethine ylide used for producing the azomethine ylide may be produced, for example, by adding a catalytic amount of trifluoroacetic acid or a catalytic amount of silver fluoride to N-benzyl-N-(methoxymethyl) trimethylsilyl methylamine (See Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 52, No. 2, page 235, 1987). The reaction solvent is not particularly limited as long as it produces azomethine ylide without inhibiting the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The solvent, however, is preferably dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of from -20Â°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent, and preferably, at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
[0078]<br>
Step 2 is the step in which protective group at position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring is converted. This step is preferably conducted in order to enable separation and purification by extraction of the carboxylic acid derivative produced by the hydrolysis of the ester at position 3. The protective group at position 1 is preferably the one which is distinguishable in the deprotection step from the protective group of the amino group at position 3 generated in the subsequent conversion although use of the same protective group is allowable.  Preferable protective group at position 1 is benzyloxycarbonyl group. The reaction for introducing this benzyloxycarbonyl is generally conducted by direct conversion by von Braun reaction using benzyl chloroformate in a solvent such as dichloromethane; by catalytic hydrolysis using a catalyst such as palladium-carbon followed by reaction with benzyl chloroformate in an appropriate solvent and in the presence of a base.<br>
[0079]<br>
Step 3 is the step of hydrolyzing the ester at position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring. The ester is an alkyl ester containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and preferably, methyl ester, ethyl ester, or tertiary butyl ester. The hydrolysis is can be conducted by any<br>
method commonly used in the art as long as the protective group at position 1 is not affected, and typically by hydrolysis using a base or an acid. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester and the ethyl ester is conducted by reaction with an alkaline aqueous solution such as aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, or aqueous solution of barium hydroxide in ethanol or water followed by acidification by an appropriate acid which does not affect the protective group at position 1 for separation and purification.  In the case of hydrolyis of the tertiary butyl ester, the hydrolysis is conducted under acidic conditions or in the presence of an acid catalyst in an appropriate solvent in which the ester is soluble.  Preferable acids include hydrochloric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
[0080]<br>
Step 4 is the step of converting the carboxyl group at position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring to amino group. This step is generally carried out by rearrangement of carboxylic acid to amine, For example, when the rearrangement is accomplished by Curtius rearrangement, the carboxylic acid is converted to acid azide by using a reagent such as sodium azide, trimethylsilyl azide, or diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) in an appropriate solvent such as toluene, and converting the acid azide to isocyanate by heating the reaction mixture, and then converting the isocyanate to amine by hydrolysis using hydrochloric acid or the like.<br>
[0081]<br>
Step 5 is the step of protecting the amino group at position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring. However, the subsequent steps may also be conducted without protecting the amino group. The protective group of the amino group at position 3 may be an amino protecting group commonly used in the art. However, use of a protective group which is distinguishable in the deprotection step from the protective group at position 1 is preferable. Examples include tertiary butoxycarbonyl group, acetyl group, and trifluoroacetyl group, and the preferred is tertiary butoxycarbonyl group.<br>
[0082]<br>
It should be noted that Step 4 and Step 5 can be<br>
accomplished in one step when the rearrangement is conducted in an appropriate solvent. For example, Curtius rearrangement may be carried out by using diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) in tertiary<br>
butyl alcohol to produce 3-(tertiary butoxycarbonyl)aminopyrrolidine derivative. [0083]<br>
Step 6 is the step of deprotection of position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring, and the deprotection reaction may be conducted under any conditions as long as other functional groups and configuration are not affected. Since the protective group at position 1 is benzyloxycarbonyl group with regard to the compound of the present invention, the deprotection is conducted under conditions commonly used in the art, for example, by catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium-carbon or by using ammonium formate in a protic polar solvent. When carbon - carbon unsaturated bond is present at position 4 of the pyrrolidine ring due to the presence of the substituent such as vinyl group or methylene group, the deprotection should be accomplished while maintaining the carbon - carbon unsaturated bond. Since the protective group at position 1 is<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl group with regard to the compound of the present invention, the deprotection condition capable of maintaining the carbon - carbon unsaturated bond of the vinyl group, methylene group, or the like at position 4 of the pyrrolidine ring is provided by the method using sodium-liquid ammonia (Birch reduction conditions) in the presence of a strong acid (for example, hydrobromic acid-acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid-trifluoroacetic acid), the method using barium hydroxide, and the like. <br>
[0084]<br>
Next, synthesis of pyrrolidine derivative which is typically 7-amino-7-methyl-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptane-5-yl group is described.<br>
7-amino-7-methyl-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptane derivative (17) which is another typical compound of the present invention can be synthesized by converting ketone moiety of acetoacetate derivative into aminonitrile derivative by Strecker reaction, converting cyano group to aminomethyl group by reduction, and condensing the aminomethyl group with ester moiety (carboxylic acid unit) to produce a pyrrolidone derivative which is an important intermediate. <br>
[0085]<br>
Although the inventors of the present invention selected tertiary butoxycarbonyl group for the protective group of the<br>
amine moiety at position 3, the protective group of the amine moiety at position 3 is not limited to the tertiary butoxycarbonyl group as long as the selected protective group does not inhibit the subsequent reaction steps and is easily deprotected later, and a protective group which is the same as the protective group at position 1 may also be used. Synthesis of the optically active compound can be conducted, for example, by optical resolution using an appropriate intermediate, for example, by HPLC resolution using a chiral column of the appropriate intermediate, preferential crystallization of the diastereomer salt, or by bonding chiral building block to an appropriate intermediate to produce a diastereomer, separating the diastereomer by using an appropriate separation technique such as silica gel chromatography, and removing the chiral building block to produce an optically active substance. Alternatively, the optically active compound may be synthesized by using the chiral building block for the starting material. <br>

 [0087]<br>
In the formula, Boc represents tertiary butoxycarbonyl group, and R12 represents an alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
[0088]<br>
Step 7 is the step of constructing a cyclic structure at methylene moiety of the acetoacetate derivative. This step can be generally accomplished by using a 1,2-dihalogeno ethane such as dibromoethane as an alkylating agent in the presence of a base. Exemplary bases include potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, and metal sodium, and the exemplary reaction solvents include acetone and N,N-dimethylformamide. After completing the reaction, the cyclo compound may be separated and purified by distillation under a reduced pressure.<br>
[0089]<br>
Step 8 is the step of converting methylketone moiety to aminonitrile derivative by Strecker reaction. This Strecker reaction is conducted by reacting ammonia with a cyanating agent such as potassium cyanide optionally in the presence of ammonium chloride. The reaction conditions may be adequately selected by referring to the Strecker reaction commonly used in the amino acid synthesis.<br>
[0090]<br>
Step 9 is the step of reducing cyano group for conversion into methylamine. The reduction of nitrile can be generally accomplished by catalytic reduction in the presence of a catalyst in an appropriate solvent such as ethanol. Examples of the catalyst include palladium-carbon catalyst, Raney nickel, Raney cobalt, and platinum oxide. When secondary amine is produced as a byproduct in the catalytic reduction of nitrile, the reduction may be conducted in the presence of ammonia. The reduction may be carried out by a metal hydride if other functional groups in the reaction system, for example, ester group which is the typical example in the compound of the present invention is not reduced. A typical example of the metal hydride is sodium borohydride-cobalt chloride (II) .  If the ester moiety is reduced, the reaction may be conducted after converting the ester moiety to a bulky ester such as tertiary butyl ester which is not reduced.<br>
[0091]<br>
Step 10 is the step of condensing ester moiety (carboxylic acid unit) and methylamine within the molecule to produce the<br>
pyrrolidone derivative. When the ester moiety is methyl ester or ethyl ester, the condensation can be generally accomplished by heating the reaction solution from the room temperature in an appropriated solvent. When the ester moiety is methyl ester or ethyl ester, the pyrrolidone derivative can be directly produced from the reaction of Step 9. On the other hand, when the ester is a bulky ester such as tertiary butyl ester, the condensation is accomplished by hydrolyzing the ester by a method commonly used in the art, and then converting the hydrolyzate into the pyrrolidone derivative by using a condensing agent such as DCC.<br>
[0092]<br>
Step 11 is the step of protecting the amino group at position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring. However, the subsequent steps may also be conducted without protecting the amino group. The protective group of the amino group at position 3 may be an amino protecting group commonly used in the art which is stable under the reaction conditions of the subsequent step 13. However, use of a protective group which is distinguishable in the deprotection step from the protective group at position 1 is preferable. Examples include tertiary butoxycarbonyl group, acetyl group, and trifluoroacetyl group, and the preferred is tertiary butoxycarbonyl group.<br>
[0093]<br>
Step 12 is the step of protecting position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring. However, the subsequent steps may also be conducted without protecting the amino group. The protective group of position 1 may be an amino protecting group commonly used in the art which is stable under the reaction conditions of the subsequent step 13. However, use of a protective group which is distinguishable in the deprotection step from the amino group protective group at position 3 is preferable. The inventors of the present invention selected benzyl group for the protective group. The reaction of introducing the benzyl group is conducted by using benzyl halide in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or potassium carbonate. The reaction solvent used may be acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0094]<br>
Step 13 is the step of reducing carbonyl group of the pyrrolidone. The reduction is conducted by using a reducing agent. Exemplary reducing agents include metal hydrides such as lithium<br>
aluminum hydride, and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy) aluminum hydride, boron hydride compounds such as diborane and borane-tetrahydrofuran complex. The solvent used is typically ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, and the reaction may be carried<br>
out at a temperature of -78Â°C to 100Â°C. [0095]<br>
Step 14 is the step or deprotecting position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring, and the deprotection reaction may be conducted under any conditions as long as other functional groups and configuration are not affected. Since the protective group at position 1 is benzyl group with regard to the compound of the present invention, the deprotection is conducted under conditions commonly used in the art, for example, by catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium-carbon or by using ammonium formate in a protic polar solvent. When carbon to carbon unsaturated bond is present at position 4 of the pyrrolidine ring due to the presence of the substituent such as vinyl group or methylene group, the deprotection should be accomplished while maintaining the carbon to carbon unsaturated bond. Since the protective group at position 1 is benzyl group with regard to the compound of the present invention, the deprotection condition capable of maintaining the carbon to carbon unsaturated bond of the vinyl group, methylene group, or the like at position 4 of the pyrrolidine ring is provided, for example, by the method using sodium-liquid ammonia (Birch reduction conditions). [0096]<br>

The hydrolysis of the boron substituent can be conducted under conditions commonly used in the art, for example, by reacting with a base in an alcohol solvent such as methanol and ethanol. The base is preferably triethylamine, and the reaction is preferably conducted in an ice bath. The deprotection is conducted under the conditions suitable for the protective group used, for example, by treating the hydrolyzate with concentrated hydrochloric acid. After the reaction, the reaction solution is alkalized by adding an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.<br>

[0707]<br>
As apparent from the data of the serum concentration, the tissue concentration, and AUC, the compound of the present invention, and in particular, the compound of Example 9 exhibited a serum concentration and a tissue concentration by oral administration which is about 2 times higher, and an AUC value which is 1.5 to 2 times higher than those of the Comparative compound 1 indicating the excellent oral absorptivity and tissue penetration of the present compound. Excretion rate in urine was about 1.5 times higher than that of the Comparative compound 1 indicating the excellent urine excretion. The data was even superior in cynomolgus monkey, and the blood penetration was about 2.5 times higher, and the urine excretion rate was more than 2 times higher than those of the Comparative compound 1.<br>
The compound of Example 9 and MFLX exhibited similar pharmakokinetics in rat and cynomolgus monkey. However, the compound of Example 9 exhibited significantly superior blood penetration and urine excretion in cynomolgus monkey, clearly indicating that the compound of Example 9 exhibits excellent<br>

 [0712]<br>
The compound of the present invention exhibited a convulsion inducing frequency at a high dose which is higher that of the comparative compound I but lower than ciprofloxacin (CPFX) which are widely used in clinical practice indicating weaker convulsion inducing activity, hence, higher safety compared to CPFX. The test<br>
of concomitant administration with the biphenyl acetic acid which is the model of the concomitant administration with the fenbufen also indicated the excellent safety of the present compound since no case of convulsion or death was found for the compound of Example 9 whereas convulsion and death were noted in the administration of ciprofloxacin.<br>

Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) which is a widely accepted model for delayed antigenicity was conducted according to the method of Mugnusson et al. (J. invest. Dermatol., 52, 1969) by using a cutaneous sensitization concentration of 1% and a patch sensitization and induction concentration of 10%. At day 1, the animal was sensitized by cutaneously administering the test substance (the quinolone compounds and the control: vehicle, vaseline) (1% solution in physiological saline + FCA emulsion) at the back of the head of the shaved guinea pigs (7 week old male Slc:Hertley). At day 7, lauryl sodium sulfate (SLC) was applied for stimulus (adjuvant treatment), and on the next day, the test substance coated on a wax paper was patched onto the shaved skin to for sealed sensitization, and after 48 hours (at day 10), the waxed paper was removed. The skin reaction was observed upon the removal. On day 22, the test substance (10%) was patched onto the anterior side of the body for induction, and the induction patching was removed after 24 hours. On the next day (at day 24) and the next day (at day 25), the skin reaction was evaluated according to the description of the document as mentioned above. Erythema and edema were scored, and the case with the total score of 2 or higher was evaluated to be positive with the maximum of the score being 7.<br>

 [0715]<br>
The compound of Example 9 was confirmed to be GPMT negative (score, 0) . On the other hand, Comparative compound 1 exhibited a score of 6.8, which is almost the highest score.  In the meanwhile, gemifloxacin (gemifloxacin mesylate; product name, FACTIVE(TM)) which recently became commercially available in the U.S. has been reported in the phase 3 clinical trial which was conducted for community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chromic<br>
bronchitis that it frequently develops the side effect of rash and the rash development is frequently found after day 7 of the repeated administration. This gemifloxacin was also confirmed to be GPMT positive with the score of 6.8 which is almost the highest score as was the case Comparative compound 1. Since the gemifloxacin that had been reported to induce rash development was GPMT positive, the GPMT negative compound of the present invention was indicated to have a reduced risk of rash development.

Measurement of hERG-K+ channel blocking effect which is an in vitro standard evaluation system for cardiotoxicity (an abnormality inducing lethal arrhythmia which is found by an electrocardiogram and which is observed as prolonged QT or QTc interval) which has recently been reported as a side effect of quinolone antibacterial agent was conducted by the method described in Biophysical Journal, vol. 74, page 230, 1998. [0717] [Table 7]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0718] [Table  8]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0719]<br>

[0720] [Test Example 7]<br>
Mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) of CYP3A4 was evaluated by using inhibition of hydroxylation at position 1 of midazolam. While Comparative compound 1 exhibited significant inhibition in a manner dependent on the preincubation time and the drug concentration, the compound of Example 9 exhibited weak inhibition even when used at a high concentration. [0721]<br>
Several mechanisms are involved in the drug interaction by the CYP inhibition, and among such inhibition, the inhibition by generation of a stable complex of the metabolite of the concomitant drug with the CYP, and the inhibition by the inactivation of the CYP by the binding of the metabolite of the concomitant drug with the hem- or apo-protein moiety are irreversible, and such irreversible inhibition may last for a substantial period after stopping the administration of the concomitant drug and may induce a serious side effect. Such irreversible inhibition is called a "metabolism-based inhibition". Of the CYP molecular species involved in the drug metabolism in human, CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of 50% or higher of the drug in clinical use.  (Non-patent document: Drug Metabolism, 2nd ed., Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 2000). Accordingly, a reagent which exhibits MBI action for CYP3A4 can be regarded as a substance having a high risk of being involved in a drug interaction.<br>
For example, clarithromycin which is frequently used as a therapeutic drug for bacterial respiratory infection is known to exhibit MBI action for CYP3A4 (see the document as mentioned above), and use of clarithromycin concomitantly with terfenadine (an antihistamine) is conterindicated since such concomitant administration results in the increased blood concentration of the terfenadine due to the inhibition of the terfenadine metabolism by CYP3A4 caused by the clarithromycin, and prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram, venticular arrhythmia, and occasionally, cardiac arrest are found. However, the compound of Example 9 was<br>
revealed to have a clearly weaker MBI even when tested at a high concentration (with a significant safe margin compared to the postulated concentration in clinical use). Therefore, the compound of the present invention is estimated to be associated with a greatly reduced risk of developing clinical side effects by the drug interaction based on the MBI action for CYP3A4.<br>
[0722] [Test Example 8]<br>
Mouse local lung infection model by penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was used to compare the therapeutic effect of the compound of Example 9 and Comparative compound 1.<br>
PRSP strain 033806 that had been anaerobically cultivated in Todd Hewitt Broth was nasally administered to Male CBA/JNCrlj mice (3 to 4 week old; Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc.; 4 animals per group) under anesthesia with ketamine-xylazine mixture. Compound of Example 9 and comparative compound 1 were orally administered to this injection model, respectively, at a dose shown in FIG. 2 (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day) at 2 and 8 hours after the infection (treated for only 1 day at a daily dose of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day). Untreated control group was administered with distilled water for injection.<br>
Number of the bacteria in the lung was measured immediately before the drug administration for the untreated group (2 hours after the infection, indicated in the drawing as "Pre-control"), and on the neaxt day of the drug administration for the untreated group (the next day of the infection, indicated as "Post-control") and treated groups for use as an index of therapeutic effect. [0723]<br>
As evident from FIG. 2, while the in vivo antibacterial activity of the compound of Example 9 for the test bacteria was about 1/4 of the comparative compound 1, no significant difference was found between the therapeutic effect of the compound of Example 9 and that of the comparative compound 1 in the oral administration to the mouse local lung infection model by PRSP for all groups administered with the same dose.<br>
[0724]<br>
[Test Example 9] Therapeutic effect in rat simple cystitis model (E. coli)<br>
Infection model:  Rats (7 week old male Crl:CD(SD) (IGS) rats, Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc., 4 animals per group) that had been deprived of water from the previous day were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine mixture, and E. coli strain E77156 was transurethrally inoculated (1.2 x 107 CFU/rat) in the bladder. After the administration, urethral orifice was closed for 2 hours to thereby prevent discharge of the bacterial solution, and feeding of the water was started simultaneously with the termination of closure.<br>
Drug administration: Compound of Example 9 and Comparative Compound 1 were orally administered respectively at a dose of 5, 20, or 80 mg/kg on the next day of the infection in a single dose. Evaluation of the effectiveness: Number of the bacteria in the bladder was measured immediately before the drug administration and on the next day of the drug administration (2 days after the infection) for the untreated group, and on the next day of the drug administration for the treated groups for use as an index of therapeutic effect.<br>
[0725]<br>
Results: A significant decrease in the number of bacteria was found only for the compound of Example 9 when the dose was 20 or 80 mg/kg/day. The therapeutic effect of this compound for the group with the dose of 5 mg/kg/day was significantly stronger than the Comparative Compound 1. Accordingly, the compound of Example 9 was demonstrated to be a compound which is capable of realizing therapeutic effects superior to those of the Comparative Compound 1 (FIG. 4) .<br>
