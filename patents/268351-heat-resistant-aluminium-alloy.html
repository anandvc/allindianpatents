				<td>Heat-resistant Aluminium Alloy<br>
The invention relates to a cold-hardening aluminium<br>
5 casting alloy with good thermal stability for the<br>
production of thermally and mechanically stressed cast<br>
components.<br>
The further development of diesel engines with the aim<br>
10 of improved combustion of the diesel fuel and a higher<br>
specific power is leading inter alia to an increased<br>
explosion pressure and consequently to a mechanical<br>
stress, acting in a pulsating fashion on the cylinder<br>
crank case, which places the most stringent of<br>
15 requirements on the material. Besides a high<br>
durability, a high-temperature cycling strength of the<br>
material is a further requisite for its use in the<br>
production of cylinder crank cases.<br>
20 AlSi alloys are normally used at present for thermally<br>
stressed components, the thermal stability being<br>
increased by alloying them with Cu. Copper, however,<br>
increases the hot cracking susceptibility and has a<br>
detrimental effect on the castability. Applications in<br>
25 which thermal stability is required in particular are<br>
encountered primarily in the field of cylinder heads in<br>
automotive manufacturing, see for example F. J. Feikus<br>
"Optimierung von Aluminium-Silicium-Gusslegierungen fur<br>
Zylinderkopfe" [Optimization of aluminium-silicon<br>
30 casting alloys for cylinder heads], Giesserei-Praxis,<br>
1999, volume 2, pp. 50-57.<br>
US-A-3 868 250 discloses a heat-resistant AlMgSi alloy<br>
for the production of cylinder heads. Besides the usual<br>
35 additives, the alloy contains from 0.6 to 4.5 wt% Si,<br>
from 2.5 to 11 wt% Mg, of which from 1 to 4.5 wt% free<br>
Mg, and from 0.6 to 1.8 wt% Mn.<br><br>
WO-A-9615281 discloses an aluminium alloy having from<br>

2.0 wt% Mn, at most 0.15 wt% Fe, at most 0.2 wt% Ti,<br>
and aluminium as the remainder with further impurities<br>
5 individually at most 0.02 wt%, in total at most 0.2<br>
wt%. The alloy is suitable for components with<br>
stringent requirements on the mechanical properties.<br>
The alloy is preferably processed by die-casting,<br>
thixocasting or thixoforging.<br>

most 0.00005 wt% Na, at most 0.0002 wt% P, other<br>
impurities individually at most 0.02 wt%, and aluminium<br>
as the remainder.<br>
20<br>
A casting alloy of the AlMgSi type known from EP-A-1<br>
234 893 contains from 3.0 to 7.0 wt% Mg, from 1.7 to<br>
3.0 wt% Si, from 0.2 to 0.48 wt% Mn, from 0.15 to 0.35<br>
wt% Fe, at most 0.2 wt% Ti, optionally also from 0.1 to<br>
25 0.4 wt% Ni and aluminium as the remainder, and<br>
impurities due to production individually at most 0.02<br>
wt%, in total at most 0.2 wt%, with the further proviso<br>
that magnesium and silicon are present in the alloy<br>
essentially in an Mg:Si weight ratio of 1.7:1<br>
30 corresponding to the composition of the quasi-binary<br>
eutectic with the solid phases Al and Mg2Si. The alloy<br>
is suitable for the production of safety parts in a<br>
vehicle manufacturing by die-casting, rheo- and<br>
thixocasting.<br>
35<br>

Zn 2%, Sr 0.02%, Mg 0.5%, Fe 0.1%, Ti 0.1%, Ag 0.1%, Ni<br>
0.45 %, In 0.1%, Be 0.0005%.<br>
10 A standardized casting alloy of the type AlSi9Cu3(Fe)<br>
is known as alloy 226 (EN AC - 46000) with 8-11 wt%<br>
Si, at most 1.30 wt% Fe, 2-4 wt% Cu, at most 0.55 wt%<br>

15 at most 0.25 wt% Sn, at most 0.25 wt% Ti, others<br>

wt%, remainder aluminium.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an<br>
20 aluminium alloy having good thermal stability for the<br>
production of thermally and mechanically stressed cast<br>
components. The alloy is intended to be suitable<br>
primarily for die-casting, but also for gravity mould<br>
casting, low-pressure mould casting and sand casting.<br>
25<br>
It is a particular object of the invention to provide<br>
an aluminium alloy for cylinder crank cases of<br>
combustion engines, in particular diesel engines,<br>
produced by the die-casting method.<br>
30<br>
The components cast from the alloy are intended to have<br>
a high strength after cold hardening.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention in<br>
35 that the alloy contains<br>
from 11.0 to 12.0 wt% silicon<br>
from 0.7 to 2.0 wt% magnesium<br>
from 0.1 to 1 wt% manganese<br><br>
at most 1 wt% iron<br>
at most 2 wt% copper<br>
at most 2 wt% nickel<br>
at most 1 wt% chromium<br>
5 at most 1 wt% cobalt<br>
at most 2 wt% zinc<br>
at most 0.25 wt% titanium<br>
4 0 ppm boron<br>
optionally from 80 to 300 ppm strontium<br>
10 and aluminium as the remainder with further elements<br>
and impurities due to production individually at most<br>
0.05 wt%, in total at most 0.2 wt%.<br>
A first preferred variant of the alloy according to the<br>
15 invention has the following preferred content ranges<br>
for the alloy elements listed below:<br>
from 11.2 to 11.8 wt% silicon<br>
from 0.6 to 0.9 wt% manganese<br>
20 at most 0.15 wt% iron<br>
from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% magnesium<br>
from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% copper<br>
from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% nickel<br>
from 0.08 to 0.25 wt% titanium<br>
25 from 20 to 30 ppm boron.<br>
A second preferred variant of the alloy according to<br>
the invention has the following preferred content<br>
ranges for the alloy elements listed below:<br>
30<br>
from 11.2 to 11.8 wt% silicon<br>
from 0.6 to 0.9 wt% manganese<br>
at most 0.15 wt% iron<br>
from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% magnesium<br>
35 from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% copper<br>
from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% nickel<br>
from 0.6 to 1.0 wt% cobalt<br>
from 0.08 to 0.25 wt% titanium<br>
from 20 to 3 0 ppm boron.<br><br>
A third preferred variant of the alloy according to the<br>
invention has the following preferred content ranges<br>
for the alloy elements listed below:<br>
5<br>
from 11.2 to 11.8 wt% silicon<br>
from 0.6 to 0.9 wt% manganese<br>
at most 0.15 wt% iron<br>
from 0.7 to 1.0 wt% magnesium<br>
10 from 1.8 to 2.0 wt% copper<br>
from 0.5 to 1.0 wt% chromium<br>
from 1.7 to 2.0 wt% zinc<br>
from 0.08 to 0.25 wt% titanium<br>
from 20 to 30 ppm boron.<br>
15<br>
The addition of manganese can prevent adhesion of the<br>
cast parts in the mould. Manganese also contributes<br>
substantially to the thermal hardening. A lower iron<br>
content leads to a high elongation and reduces the risk<br>
20 of creating platelets containing Fe, which lead to<br>
increased cavitation and impair the mechanical<br>
processability.<br>
The high Si content leads to a very good castability<br>
25 and to reduction of the cavitation. The near-eutectic<br>
Al-Si composition also makes it possible to reduce the<br>
casting temperature and therefore extend the lifetime<br>
of a metal mould. The hypo-eutectic Si level has been<br>
selected so that no primary Si crystals occur.<br>
30<br>
By adding chromium, the mould release behaviour of the<br>
alloy can be improved further and the strength values<br>
can be increased. Cobalt serves to increase the thermal<br>
stability. Titanium and boron serve for grain refining.<br>
35 Good grain refining contributes substantially to<br>
improving the casting properties and the mechanical<br>
properties.<br><br>
A preferred field of application for the aluminium<br>
alloy according to the invention is the production of<br>
thermally and mechanically stressed cast components as<br>
die, mould or sand castings, in particular for cylinder<br>
5 crank cases in automotive manufacturing produced by the<br>
die-casting method.<br>
Other advantages, features and details of the invention<br>
may be found in the following description of preferred<br>
10 exemplary embodiments.<br>
The alloys according to the invention were cast by the<br>
die-casting method to form flat tensile specimens with<br>
a wall thickness of 3 mm. After removal from the die-<br>
15 casting mould, the specimens were cooled in still air.<br>
The mechanical properties yield point (Rp0.2), tensile<br>
strength (Rm) and elongation at break (A) were<br>
determined for the tensile specimens in the cast state<br>
20 at room temperature (RT) , 150°C, 225°C and 300°C, and<br>
also at room temperature (RT) and at the heat treatment<br>
temperature (HTT) after various one-stage heat<br>
treatments respectively for 500 hours at 150°C, 225°C<br>
and 300°C.<br>
25<br>
The alloys studied are collated in Table 1.<br>
Tables 2, 3 and 4 report the results of the mechanical<br>
properties determined for tensile specimens of the<br>
30 alloys of Table 1 in the cast state at various<br>
temperatures.<br>
Tables 5, 6 and 7 report the results of the mechanical<br>
properties determined at room temperature (RT) and at<br>
35 the heat treatment temperature (HTT) for tensile<br>
specimens of the alloys of Table 1 after a heat<br>
treatment for 500 hours at various temperatures.<br><br>
The results of the long-term tests confirm the good<br>
thermal stability of the alloy according to the<br>
invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
