PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to Internal Combustion engines and more particularly this relates to engine cooling system with integrated thermostat housing and coolant pump.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The IC engine is provided with a cooling system to dissipate the heat generated during combustion process to the atmosphere and also maintains the coolant at a certain temperature range for efficient engine operation.<br>
The demand for power torque combined with better fuel efficiency is increasing due to tougher emission norms and customer requirements. This causes increased heat generation, during the combustion process. It's a challenging task to achieve this performance without major increase in the size and weight of the internal combustion engine. Equally challenging task is to dissipate this heat energy in the available space. It is necessary to dissipate the heat as the materials of the engine parts can maintain its mechanical properties up to a certain temperature. Fig 1 shows schematic layout of the conventional cooling system with thermostat and coolant pump. The major components related to the cooling system are water pump, cylinder block, cylinder head, Radiator and thermostat.<br>
Thermostat (1) and water pump (3) are housed in different housings connected by hoses and pipes. The thermostat and its housing is placed on the hot side (engine to radiator) and the Water pump is placed on the cold side (radiator to engine) of the cooling system. The coolant from the engine comes to the thermostat. The coolant flows back to the engine or to the radiator depending on the coolant temperature. The coolant flows back to the engine through the<br><br>
by-pass (4). The coolant flows to the radiator (2) for heat dissipation if the coolant temperature exceeds the thermostat set temperature.<br>
The conventional cooling system comprises of<br>
Thermostat and thermostat housing (a): - Hot coolant from the cylinder head is collected in a passage and then sent to radiator via thermostat. Hence thermostat has to be located at the highest possible location and this is connected with hoses and pipes. This arrangement is in general, used for all liquid cooled internal combustion engines. The thermostat directs the flow to the radiator or back to the engine through by-pass (d) depending on the coolant temperature. If the temperature of the coolant circulating in the system is less than the thermostat set temperature then the thermostat directs the coolant flow to circulate in the engine through by-pass (d) to absorb the heat. If the coolant temperature is above the thermostat set temperature the thermostat directs the coolant to the radiator, which dissipates heat to the atmosphere. Radiator (b): - Rejects heat to the atmosphere by process of convection. Coolant pump (c): - Pumps the coolant from the radiator at required flow rate and pressure to the cylinder block to cool the cylinders. Then the coolant flows to cylinder head through various water passage connections between cylinder block and cylinder head. Basically coolant flows in the upward direction i.e., from cylinder block to cylinder head.<br>
The main drawback associated with this system is that the hose clamps and pipes, which are connected to the thermostat, are prone to leakages and damages over a period of time. The vehicle vibrations and the relative motion between engine and radiator can damage the connections leading to leakages. This also occupies more space. In some cases separate housing needs to be constructed to place the thermostat. Thermostat also has to be placed at the highest location, which is an important condition to be fulfilled.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Figure 2 shows schematic diagram, which illustrates various components of the cooling  system  with  integrated thermostat housing and  coolant pump  in<br><br>
accordance with the invention. Coolant inlet (1), thermostat (2), water pump (4), integrated thermostat and coolant pump housing (5) coolant outlet (6), coolant flow to radiator (7), coolant flow from radiator (8), connection to vent (9), coolant flow from cabin heater (10), coolant flow to air compressor (11), coolant flow from EGR cooler (12).<br>
Referring to the figure 3, the coolant inlet (1) receives coolant from the engine and the coolant outlet (6) sends coolant to the engine. The housing has a port to receive coolant from EGR cooler (12), to send coolant to the air compressor (11), receive coolant from the cabin heater (10), and connection to the vent (9). The coolant is sent and received through coolant inlet (8) and coolant outlet (7) respectively to and fro from radiator. The coolant pump is covered with a rear cover (13) to house the coolant pump rotating parts. The thermostat is covered with thermostat cover (14), which also provides connection to the coolant outlet (7).<br>
The coolant from the engine is received from coolant inlet (1) is pumped by the water pump (4) into the passage of cast housing (5). This passage is connected to the coolant outlet passage (6) to engine for coolant circulation in the engine. The coolant absorbs the heat from various engine parts. This circulation is based on the top down cooling system where the coolant flows from the cylinder head to the cylinder block. The coolant returns to the water pump through the coolant inlet passage (1).<br>
Referring to figure 4, if the coolant temperature is less than the thermostat set temperature; the thermostat (2) directs the flow of coolant back to the engine through by-pass (3).<br>
Referring to figure 5, if the coolant temperature is more than the thermostat set temperature the thermostat (2) directs the coolant flow to the radiator inlet (7)<br><br>
where the heat is rejected by the radiator to the atmosphere by process of convection. The coolant returns from the radiator outlet (8) to the water pump (4) where it is pumped back to the engine.<br>
The integrated water pump and thermostat housing is also aligned to the Top Down cooling system. Since the coolant flows from Top to bottom i.e. from cylinder head to cylinder block, location of the thermostat is not a constraint. The thermostat can be located at a lesser height depending on availability of space and also integrated with coolant pump housing.<br>
The integrated thermostat and coolant pump housing has to be cast into a complex shape due its nature and functional requirement. The flow passages are designed for smooth flow of coolant to minimize the pressure drop. The coolant pump is designed in an in-volute shape for generating the coolant pressure. It does not require any special material and can be made in the existing available material i.e. aluminum. The said housing is strengthened with ribs at various locations.<br>
The integrated thermostat and coolant pump housing houses two thermostats to reduce pressure drop considering high coolant flow rate. One large thermostat would be difficult to design and manufacture, instead two smaller thermostats are easier to design and manufacture. Also since one large thermostat occupies more space, two thermostats are placed in parallel, which also occupies less space.<br>
Two smaller thermostats placed in parallel provide better reliability than one large thermostat since the cooling system is very critical for high power and torque. Any sudden failure of one thermostat cannot stop the functioning of the engine. The second thermostat can keep the cooling system functional at reduced efficiency and performance level.<br><br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that those skilled in the art may practice numerous alterations and modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included in so far as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br>
