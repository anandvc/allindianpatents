				<td>Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating composition and a method for preparing the same.<br>
Particularly invention relates to the combination of sulfur compound and specific phosphorus compounds. This invention also relates to lubricating concentrations and grease containing the combination.<br>
Background of the Invention Lubricating compositions are used to prevent damage to machinery under operating conditions.  Especially under boundary lubrication conditions, a lubricant must act to minimize harmful metal-to-metal contact.  Often additives are useful at providing protection under boundary lubricating condition but sometimes these additive adversely affect other performance characteristics.  For instance, a lubricant must still provide protection under high speed, shock loading condition, while not be corrosive to copper and other soft metals.<br>
It is desirable to( have(a,combination of additives which provide extreme<br>
pressure protection with out sacrificing otherperformance characteristics. <a></a>
combination of additives is desired which will provide good extreme pressure properties to lubricants, which maintain the other parameters required of industry standards, such as API GL-5 and MIL-L2105D gear lubricant requirements.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments The term "hydrocarbyl" includes hydrocarbon as well as substantially hydrocarbon groups.  Substantially hydrocarbon describes groups which contain heteroatom substituents that do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent.   Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include the following:<br>
(1)	hydrocarbon substituents, i.e., aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl) and alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, aromatic-, aliphatic- and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents and the like as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (that is, for example, any two indicated substituents may together form an alicyclic radical);<br>
(2)	substituted hydrocarbon substituents, i.e., those substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent; those skilled in the art will be aware of such groups (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, mercapto, nitro, nitroso, sulfoxy, etc.);<br>
(3)	heteroatom substituents, i.e., substituents which will, while having a<br>
predominantly hydrocarbon character within the context of this invention, contain an<br>
atom other than carbon present in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon<br>
atoms (e.g., alkoxy or alkylihio).   Suitable heteroatoms will be apparent to those of<br>
ordinaiy skill in the art and include, for example, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and such<br>
substituents as, e.g. pyridyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, etc.<br>
In general, no more than about 2, preferably no more than one heteroatom substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group. Typically, there will be no such heteroatom substituents in the hydrocarbyl group. Therefore, the hydrocarbyl group is hydrocarbon.<br>
As described above the lubricating compositions, concentrates, and grease contain a combination of (a) at least one sulfur compound and at least one mixture comprising (b) an ammonium salt of a phosphoric acid ester, (c) a phosphite, and (d) a thiophosphate or a reaction product of a phosphite and sulfur or a source of sulfur. In one embodiment, the sulfur compound (a) is present at concentrations in the range<br>
from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, or preferably from about 0.2% up to about 8%, or more preferably from about 0.3% up to about 7%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight.  Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, the range and ratio limits may be combined. Sulfur Compounds<br>
The sulfur compounds include mono- or polysulfide compositions, or mixtures thereof. The sulfur compounds are generally characterized as having sulfide linkages containing an average from 1 up to about 10, or from about 2 up to about 8, or from about 3 up to about 4 sulfur atoms. In one embodiment, the sulfur compound is a mixture of di-, tri- or tetrasulfide materials, preferably having a majority of trisulfide. Materials having at least 70% trisulfide are preferred, with materials containing greater than 80% trisulfide more preferred.<br>
In one embodiment, the sulfur compound is prepared by sulfurizing unsaturated compounds. Materials which may be sulfurized include oils, unsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty esters, olefins, terpenes, or Diels-Alder adducts. Oils which may be sulfurized are natural or synthetic oils, including mineral oils, lard oil, carboxylic acid esters derived from aliphatic alcohols and fatty acids or aliphatic carboxylic acids (e.g., myristyl oleate and oleyl oleate), and synthetic sperm whale oil substitutes and synthetic unsaturated esters or glycerides.<br>
The unsaturated fatly acids generally contain from about 8 to about 30, or from about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms. Examples of unsaturated fatty acids include palmitoleic acid, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, erucic acid, lard oil acid, soybean oil acid, tall oil and rosin acid.<br>
The unsaturated fatty esters include fatty oils, that is, naturally occurring or synthetic esters of glycerol and one or more of the above fatty acids. Examples of fatty esters include animal fats, such as Neat's-foot oil, lard oil, depot fat, beef tallow, and vegetable oils, including cottonseed oil, corn oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and sunflower seed oil. The unsaturated fatty esters also may be prepared by esterifying alcohols and polyols with a fatty acid. The alcohols include the above described mono- and polyhydric alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, neopenryl glycol, and glycerol.<br>
The olefins, which may be sulfurized, contain at least one olefinic double bond, which is defined as a non-aromatic double bond.  In its broadest sense, the olefin may be defined by the formula R1R2C=CR3R'4, wherein each of R1, R2, R+3, and R'4 is hydrogen, or an hydrocarbyl group. In general, the R groups in the above formula which are not hydrogen may be represented by -(CH2)n-A, wherein n is a number from 0 to about 10 and A is represented by -C(R+5)3, -COOR+5, -CON(R+3)2, -COON(R5)4, -COOM, -CN, -X, -YR+5 or -Ar, wherein: each R+5 is independently hydrogen, or a hydrocarbyl group, with the proviso that any two R+5 groups may be connected to form a ring of up to about 12 carbon atoms; M is one equivalent of a metal cation (preferably Group I or II, e.g., sodium, potassium, barium, or calcium); X is halogen (e.g., chloro, bromo, or iodo); Y is oxygen or divalent sulfur; Ar is an aromatic group of up to about 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The olefinic compound is usually one in which each R group which is not hydrogen is independently alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group, preferably an alkyl group. In one embodiment, R+3 and R+4 are hydrogen and R+1 and R+2 are alkyl or aryl, especially alkyl, having from 1 up to about 30, or from 1 up to about 16, or from 1 up to about 8 carbon atoms. Olefins having from 2 up to about 30, or from about 3 up to about 16 (most often less than about 9) carbon atoms are particularly useful. Olefins having from 2 up to about 8, or from 2 up to about 4 carbon atoms are particularly useful. Isobutene, propylene and their dimers, trimers and tetramers, and mixtures thereof are especially preferred olefins. Of these compounds, isobutylene and diisobutylene are particularly desirable. In one embodiment, the organic polysulfides may be a mixture of di-, tri-, or tetrasulfide materials, preferably having a majority of trisulfide. Materials having at least 70% trisulfide are preferred, with materials containing greater than 80% trisulfide more preferred.<br>
In another embodiment, the organic polysulfide comprise sulfurized olefins prepared by the sulfochlorination of olefins containing four or more carbon atoms and further treatment with inorganic sulfides according to U.S. Patent 2,708,199.<br>
In one embodiment, the sulfurized olefins may be produced by (1) reacting sulfur monochloride with a stoichiometric excess of a lower olefin, e.g. containing two to about seven carbon atoms, (2) treating the resulting product with an alkali metal sulfide in the presence of free sulfur in a mole ratio of no less than 2:1 in an<br>
alcohol-water solvent, and (3) reacting that product with an inorganic base. This procedure is described in U.S. Patent 3,471,404, and the disclosure of U.S. Patent 3,471,404 is hereby incorporated by reference for its discussion of this procedure for preparing sulfurized olefins and the sulfurized olefins thus produced. Generally, the olefin reactant contains from about 2 to about 5 carbon atoms and examples include ethylene, propylene, burylene, isobutylene, amylene, etc.<br>
The organic polysulfide may also be the reaction product of a hydrocarbyl mercaptan, sulfur and an olefin. The mercaptans used to make the polysulfide may be hydrocarbyl mercaptans, such as those represented by the formula R—S—H, wherein R is a hydrocarbyl group as defined above. In one embodiment, R is an -alkyl, an alkenyl, cycloalkyl, or cycloalkenyl group.  R may also be a haloalkyl, hydoxyalkyl, or hydroxyalkyl substituted (e.g. hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, etc.) aliphatic groups.  R generally contains from about 2 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from about 2 to about 24, more preferably from about 3 to about 18 carbon atoms. Examples include butyl mercaptan, amyl mercaptan, hexyl mercaptan, octyl mercaptan, 6-hydroxymethyl-octanethiol, nonyl mercaptan, decyl mercaptan, 10-amino-dodecanethiol, dodecyl mercaptan, 10-hydroxymethyl-tetradecanethioI, and tetradecyl mercaptan.<br>
The sulfurized olefin may also be prepared by reacting, under superatmospheric pressure, the olefin with a mixture of sulfur and hydrogen sulfide in the presence, or absence, of a catalyst, such as an alkyl amine, followed by removal of low boiling materials. The olefins which may be sulfurized, the sulfurized olefin, and methods of preparing the same are described in U.S. Patents 4,119,549, 4,199,550, 4,191,659, and 4,344,854. The disclosure of these patents is hereby incorporated by reference for its description of the sulfurized olefins and preparation of the same.<br>
The organic polysulfide generally has hydrocarbyl groups each independently having from about two to about 30, preferably from about two to about 20, and more preferably from about two to about 12. The hydrocarbyl groups may be aromatic or aliphatic, preferably aliphatic.  In one embodiment, the hydrocarbyl groups are alkyl groups.<br>
In one embodiment, the sulfur compound contains a mixture comprising at least about 90% dihydrocarbyl trisulfide, from about 0.5% up to about 8%<br>
dihydrocarbyl disulfide, and less than about 5% dihydrocarbyl higher polysulfides. Higher polysulfides are defined as containing four or more sulfide linkages. In one embodiment, the amount of trisulfide is at least about 92%, or preferably at least about 93%. In another embodiment, the amount of dihydrocarbyl higher polysulfides is less than 4%, or preferably less than about 3%. In one embodiment, the dihydrocarbyl disulfide is present in an amount from about 0.5% up to about 5%, or preferably from about 0.6% up to about 3%.<br>
The sulfide analysis is performed on a Varian 6000 Gas Chromatograph and FID detector SP-4100 computing integrator. The Column is a 25 m. Megabore SGE BP-1. The temperature profile is 75 +C, hold 2 min., to 250+C at 6'C/m'm. The helium flow is 6.0 ml/min plus make-up. The injection temperature is 200+ C and the detector temperature is 260 +C. The injection size is 0.6, ul. References are the monosulfide, disulfide and trisulfide analogues to the sulfur composition for analysis. The references may be obtainied by fractionating the product to form sulfide fractions (SI, S2 and S3) to be used for analysis. The procedure for analysis is as follows. (1) An area % determination is run on each of the reference samples to determine its purity. (2) An area % determination is run on the sample to be tested to get a general idea of its composition. (3) A calibration blend is accurately weighed based on the area % results of the sample to be tested: then the internal standard toluene, is added to the blend in an amount equal to approximately one-half of the weight of the largest component. (This should give an area approximately the same as that of the largest component.) (4) The weights of each component (i.e., 3-1, S-2 and S-3) are corrected by the % purity from step 1. (5) The calibration blend is run in triplicate using the corrected weights and then calculated, using the following formula, to reflect the multiple peaks in S-l and S-2:<br>
RF =	(concentration of components+) (      area of internal standard      )<br>
(      total area of peaks	) (concentration of internal standard)<br>
+	Adjusted for purity of the standard i.e.: component weight times<br>
percent purity equals concentration of component. (6) These response factors, plus the response factor for the single S-3 peak are used for determining weight percent results for the samples to be tested. (7) Results for S-<br>
1 and S-2 are adjusted to include all the peaks attributed to them.  (8) Higher polysulfides are determined by difference using the following formula:<br>
S-4 = 100% - (S-l + S-2 + S-3 + light ends) Light ends are defined as any peaks eluded prior to the internal standard.<br>
In one embodiment, the organic polysulfide is prepared as described above using hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, and at least olefin to form an intermediate. The intermediate is fractionally distilled to form the organic polysulfide. In one aspect, the fractional distillation occurs under subatmospheric pressure.   Typically the distillation pressure is from about 1 to about 250, preferably from about 1 to about 100, or preferably from about 1 to about 25 mm Hg. A fractionation column, such a Snyder fractionation column may be used. In one embodiment, the fractionation is carried out at a reflux ratio of from about 2:1 up to about 8:1, preferably from about 3:1 up to about 7:1, or preferably from about 4:1 up to about 6:1. S-21<br>
The following examples relate to sulfurized olefins. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, here, as well as throughout the specification and claims, the amounts are by weight, the temperature is in degrees Celsius and the pressure is atmospheric.<br>
Example S-l<br>
Sulfur (526 parts, 16.4 moles) is charged to a jacketed, high-pressure reactor which is fitted with an agitator and internal cooling coils.  Refrigerated brine is circulated through the coils to cool the reactor prior to the introduction of the gaseous reactants. After sealing the reactor, evacuating to about 2 torr and cooling, 920 parts (16.4 moles) of isobutene and 279 parts (8.2 moles) of hydrogen sulfide are charged to the reactor. The reactor is heated using steam in the external jacket, to a temperature of about 182°C over about 1.5 hours. A maximum pressure of 1350 psig is reached at about 168°C during this heat-up.  Prior to reaching the peak reaction temperature, the pressure starts to decrease and continues to decrease steadily as the gaseous reactants are consumed. After about 10 hours at a reaction temperature of about 182°C, the pressure is 310-340 psig and the rate of pressure change is about 5-10 psig per hour. The unreacted hydrogen sulfide and isobutene are vented to a recovery system. After the pressure in the reactor has decreased to atmospheric, the sulfurized mixture is recovered as a liquid. The mixture is blown with nitrogen at<br>
about 100°C to remove low boiling materials including unreacted isobutene, mercaptans and monosulfides. The residue after nitrogen blowing is agitated with 5% Super Filtrol and filtered, using a diatomaceous earth filter aid. The filtrate is the desired sulfurized composition which contains 42.5% sulfur.<br>
Example S-2 Sulfur monochloride (2025 grams, 15.0 moles) is heated to 45°C. Through a sub-surface gas sparge, 1468 grams (26.2 moles) of isobutylene gas are fed into the reactor over a 5-hour period. The temperature is maintained between 45-50°C. At the end of the sparging, the reaction mixture increases in weight by 1352 grams. In a separate reaction vessel are added 2150 grams (16.5 moles) of 60% flake sodium sulfide, 240 grams (7.5 moles) sulfur, and a solution of 420 ml. of isopropanol in 4000 ml. of water. The contents are heated to 40°C. The adduct of the sulfur monochloride and isobutylene previously prepared is added over a three-quarter hour period while permitting the temperature to rise to 75°C. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours, and afterward the mixture is permitted to form into separate layers. The lower aqueous layer is discarded. The upper organic layer is mixed with two liters of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours. The organic layer is again removed and washed with one liter of water. The washed product is dried by heating at 90°C and 30 mm. Hg. pressure for 30 minutes. The residue is filtered through diatomaceous earth filter aid to give 2070 grams of a clear yellow-orange liquid.<br>
Example S-3 Charge 1000 lbs. of the product of Example S-l to the reactor, under medium agitation, and heat to approximately 88°C - 94°C. Bring to equilibrium and maintain equilibrium for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. Set the reflux ratio at 4:1. Raise the temperature to 105°C to ensure a steady distillation rate. Collection of the distillate will require approximately 20-24 hours and the yield will approximate 230 260 lbs. Raise the temperature to 105°C - 107°C. Bring the system to equilibrium and maintain for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. Set the reflux ratio at 4:1. Raise the temperature to 121°C - 124°C, in order to ensure a steady distillation rate. Collect distillate over 75-100 hours. The distillation yields approximately 300-<br>
400 lbs. of the desired product. The desired product contains 2.7% S2, 93.15% S3, 4.04% higher polysulfides.<br>
Example S-4<br>
In a vessel with a fractionation column, bring 10,000 grams of the product of Example S-l to a boil, approximately 200°F, under medium agitation. Bring the column to equilibrium by regulating the vapor temperature. Maintain the equilibrium for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. Set the reflux ratio at 5:1. Under these conditions, collect the distillate until the accumulation of distillate is less than 5ml in 15 minutes. Collect 100ml of the distillate containing 88 grams of distillate at a vapor temperature of 56°C. Raise the temperature of the vessel 15°F. Remove an additional aliquot of 50 grams in 65 ml of distillate, at a vapor temperature of 58°C. Collect 2000ml of distillate and remove 1838 grams of distillate, continuing collection as long as the distillate rate stays greater than 5ml/15 minutes. If boiling drops off, raise the temperature of the vessel 5.5°C. Continue collecting distillate until the distillation rate is less than 5ml/15 minutes is achieved. The distillate contains approximately 473 grams of desired product. For the final collection of distillate, raise the temperature of the vessel 9°C to 116°C, not exceeding 121°C. Remove 220 ml of the distillate, containing 214 grams of distillate at a vapor temperature of 69°C. Continue collection of the remainder of the distillate, containing approximately 4114 grams of the desired product, until the distillation rate is less than 5ml/15 minutes. A yield after fractionation should approximate 6777 grams of the desired product The desired product contains approximately 2% S2, 96.6% S3, and 13% higher polysulfides.<br>
As described above the sulfur compound is used in combination with (b) at least one amine salt of a phosphoric acid ester, (c) at least one phosphite, and (d) at least one thiophosphate or at least one reaction product of a phosphite and sulfur or a source of sulfur. These components are present in an amount sufficient to improve the antiwear or extreme pressure properties of the lubricating compositions and greases.  In one embodiment, the ammonium salt of a phosphoric acid esters (b) is present in an amount from about 0.1% up to about 5%, or from about 0.3% up to about 3%, or from about 0.5% up to about 2% by weight of the composition. In another embodiment, phosphite (c) is present in an amount from about 0.1% up to<br>
about 5%, or from about 0.2% up to about 3%, or from about 0.3% up to about 1% by weight of the composition.  In another embodiment, the thiophosphate or the reaction product of a phosphite and sulfur or a source of sulfur (d) is present in an amount from about 0.1% up to about 5%, or from about 0.2% up to about 2%, or from about 0.2% up to about 1% by weight of the composition. Ammonium Salt of Phosphoric Acid Esters<br>
The amine salt of a phosphoric acid ester is prepared by reacting a phosporic acid ester with ammonia or a basic nitrogen compound, such as an amine or a nitrogen containing dispersant. The salts may be formed separately, and then the salt of the phosphorus acid ester may be added to the lubricating composition. Alternatively, the salts may also be formed in situ when the acidic phosphorus acid ester is blended with other components to form a fully formulated lubricating composition.<br>
The ammonium salts of the phosphorus acid esters may be formed from ammonia, or an amine, or mixtures thereof. These amines may be monoamines or polyamines.

In one embodiment, the polyamine is an ethylenepolyamine. Such polyamines are described in detail under the heading Ethylene Amines in Kirk Othmer's "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", 2d Edition, Vol. 7, pages 22-37, Interscience Publishers, New York (1965). Ethylenepolyamines are often a complex mixture of polyalkylenepolyamines including cyclic condensation products. Other useful types of polyamine mixtures are those resulting from stripping of the above-described polyamine mixtures to leave, as residue, what is often termed "polyamine bottoms".<br><br>
In general, alkylenepolyamine bottoms can be characterized as having less than 2%, usually less than 1% (by weight) material boiling below about 200°C.   A typical sample of such ethylenepolyamine bottoms obtained from the Dow Chemical Company of Freeport, Texas designated "E-100" has a specific gravity at 15.6°C of 1.0168, a percent nitrogen by weight of 33.15 and a viscosity at 40°C of 121 centistokes.

These alkylenepolyamine bottoms include cyclic condensation products such as piperazine and higher analogs of diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine and the like. These alkylenepolyamine bottoms may be reacted solely with the acylating agent or they may be used with other amines, polyamines, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Another useful polyamine is a condensation reaction between at least one hydroxy compound with at least one polyamine reactant containing at least one primary or secondary amino group. The hydroxy compounds are preferably polyhydric alcohols and amines. The polyhydric alcohols are described below. In one embodiment, the hydroxy compounds are polyhydric amines. Polyhydric amines include any of the above-described monoamines reacted with an alkylene oxide (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, etc.) having from two to about 20 carbon atoms, or from two to about four.

The preferred polyoxyalkylene polyamines include the polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene diamines and the polyoxypropylene triamines. The polyoxyalkylene polyamines are commercially available and may be obtained, for example, from the Jefferson Chemical Company, Inc. under the trade name "Jeffamines D-230, D-400, D-1000, D-2000, T-403, etc.".

Hydroxy-containing polyamine analogs of hydroxy monoamines, particularly alkoxyl-ated alkylenepolyamines, e.g., N,N-(diethanol)ethylene diamines can also be used. Such polyamines can be made by reacting the above-described alkylene amines with one or more of the above-described alkylene oxides. Similar alkylene oxide-alkanol amine reaction products may also be used such as the products made by reacting the above described primary, secondary or tertiary alkanol amines with ethylene, propylene or higher epoxides in a 1.1 to 1.2 molar ratio.

groups or through hydroxy groups are likewise useful.  Condensation through amino groups results in a higher amine accompanied by removal of ammonia while condensation through the hydroxy groups results in products containing ether linkages accompanied by removal of water.  Mixtures of two or more of any of the above described polyamines are also useful.<br>

Preferred heterocyclic amines are the saturated 5- and 6-membered heterocyclic amines containing only nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur in the hetero ring, especially the piperidines, piperazines, thiomorpholines, morpholines, pyrrolidines, and the like. Piperidine, aminoalkyl substituted piperidines, piperazine, aminoalkyl substituted piperazines, morpholine, aminoalkyl substituted morpholines, pyrrolidine, and aminoalkyl-substituted pyrrolidines, are especially preferred. Usually the aminoalkyl substituents are substituted on a nitrogen atom forming part of the hetero ring. Specific examples of such heterocyclic amines include<br>

In one embodiment, R. and a are such that the acid molecules contain at least an average of about 12 aliphatic carbon atoms in the aliphatic hydrocarbon substituents per acid molecule. Typically, b and c are each one and the carboxylic acid is a salicylic acid.<br>
In one embodiment, the salicylic acids are hydrocarbyl substituted salicylic acids, wherein each hydrocarbyl substituent contains an average of at least about 8 carbon atoms per substituent and 1 to 3 substituents per molecule.  In one embodiment, the hydrocarbyl substituent is derived from one or more above-described polyalkenes.<br>
The above aromatic carboxylic acids are well known or can be prepared according to procedures known in the art. Carboxylic acids of the type illustrated by these formulae and processes for preparing their neutral and basic metal salts are well known and disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,197,832; 2,197,835; 2,252,662; 2,252,664; 2,714,092; 3,410,798; and 3,595,791.<br>
In another embodiment, the acidic organic compound is a sulfonic acid. The sulfonic acids include sulfonic and thiosulfonic acids, preferably sulfonic acids. The sulfonic acids include the mono- or polynuclear aromatic or cycloaliphatic compounds. The oil-soluble sulfonic acids may be represented for the most part by one of the following formulae:  R#-T-(S03)aH and R+-(S03)bH, wherein T is a cyclic nucleus such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, diphenylene oxide, diphenylene sulfide, and petroleum naphthenes; R# is an aliphatic group such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, etc.; (R#)+T contains a total of at least about 15 carbon atoms; and R+ is an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing at least about 15 carbon atoms.  Examples<br>
of R+ are alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl, carboalkoxyalkyl, etc. Specific examples of R+ are groups derived from petrolatum, saturated and unsaturated paraffin wax, and one or more of the above-described polyalkenes.

A preferred group of sulfonic acids are mono-, di-, and tri-alkylated benzene and naphthalene sulfonic acids including their hydrogenated forms.  Illustrative of synthetically produced alkylated benzene and naphthalene sulfonic acids are those containing alkyl substituents having from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, or from about 10 to about 30 carbon atoms, or from about 12 up to about 24 carbon atoms. Specific examples of sulfonic acids are mahogany sulfonic acids; bright stock sulfonic acids; sulfonic acids derived from lubricating oil fractions having a Saybolt viscosity from about 100 seconds at 100°F to about 200 seconds at 210°F; petrolatum sulfonic acids; mono- and polywax-substituted sulfonic acids; alkylbenzene sulfonic acids (where the alkyl group has at least 8 carbons), dilaurylbeta-naphthyl sulfonic acids, and alkaryl sulfonic acids, such as dodecylbenzene "bottoms" sulfonic acids.<br>
Dodecylbenzene "bottoms" sulfonic acids are the material leftover after the removal of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acids that are used for household detergents. The "bottoms" may be straight-chain or branched-chain alkylates with a straight-chain dialkylate preferred. The production of sulfonates from detergent manufactured by-products by reaction with, e.g., S03, is well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, the article "Sulfonates" in Kirk-Othmer "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", Second Edition, Vol. 19, pp. 291 et seq. published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1969).<br>

Useful phosphorus sulfide sources include phosphorus pentasulfide, phosphorus sesquisulfide, phosphorus heptasulfide and the like. The reaction of the polyalkene and the phosphorus sulfide generally may occur by simply<br>
mixing the two at a temperature above 80°C, or from about 100°C to about 300°C. Generally, the products have a phosphorus content from about 0.05% to about 10%, or from about 0.1% to about 5%. The relative proportions of the phosphorizing agent to the olefin polymer is generally from 0.1 part to 50 parts of the phosphorizing agent per 100 parts of the olefin polymer. The phosphorus containing acids are described in U.S. Patent 3,232,883, issued to LeSuer. This reference is herein incorporated by reference for its disclosure to the phosphorus containing acids and methods for preparing the same.<br>

In one embodiment, R. and a are such that there is an average of at least about eight aliphatic carbon atoms provided by the R. groups for each phenol compound.<br>
Promoters are often used in preparing the overbased metal salts. The promoters, that is, the materials which facilitate the incorporation of the excess metal into the overbased material, are also quite diverse and well known in the art A particularly comprehensive discussion of suitable promoters is found in U.S. Patents 2,777,874, 2,695,910, 2,616,904, 3,384,586 and 3,492,231. These patents are incorporated by reference for their disclosure of promoters.  In one embodiment, promoters include the alcoholic and phenolic promoters. The alcoholic promoters include the alkanols of one to about 12 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, amyl alcohol, octanol, isopropanol, and mixtures of these and the like.  Phenolic promoters include a variety of hydroxy-substituted benzenes and naphthalenes. A particularly useful class of phenols are the alkylated phenols of the type listed in U.S. Patent 2,777,874, e.g., heptylphenols, octylphenols, and nonylphenols.  Mixtures of various promoters are sometimes used.<br>
Acidic materials, which are reacted with the mixture of acidic organic compound, promoter, metal compound and reactive medium, are also disclosed in the<br>
above cited patents, for example, U.S. Patent 2,616,904. Those disclosures are incorporated by reference for their disclosure of such acidic materials. Included within the known group of useful acidic materials are liquid acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, boric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, carbamic acid, substituted carbamic acids, etc. Acetic acid is a very useful acidic. material although inorganic acidic compounds such as HC1, S02, S03, C02, H2S, N203, etc., are ordinarily employed as the acidic materials. Particularly useful acidic materials are carbon dioxide and acetic acid.<br>
The methods for preparing the overbased materials, as well as overbased materials, are known in the prior art and are disclosed, for example, in the following U.S. Patent Nos.: 2,616,904; 2,616,905; 2,616,906; 3,242,080; 3,250,710; 3,256,186; 3,274,135; 3,492,231; and 4,230,586. These patents disclose processes, materials, which can be overbased, suitable metal bases, promoters, and acidic materials, as well as a variety of specific overbased products useful in producing the overbased systems of this invention and are, accordingly, incorporated herein by reference for these disclosures.<br>
The temperature at which the acidic material is contacted with the remainder<br>
of the reaction mass depends to a large measure upon the promoting agent used.<br>
With a phenolic promoter, the temperature usually ranges from about 80°C to about<br>
300°C, and preferably from, about 100°C to about 200°C =When an alcohol or	y<br>
mercaptan is used as the promoting agent, the temperature usually will not exceed the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and preferably will not exceed about 100°C.<br>

The borated overbased metal salts generally contains from about 0.1% up to about 15%, or from about 0.5% up to about 10%, or from about 1% up to about 8% by weight of the boron.  Borated overbased compositions, lubricating compositions containing the same and methods of preparing borated overbased compositions are found in U.S. Patent 4,744,920, issued to Fischer et al; U.S. Patent 4,792,410, issued<br>
to Schwind et al, and PCT Publication WO 88/03144. The disclosures relating to the above are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

The lubricating compositions and functional fluids may contain one or more pour point depressants, color stabilizers, metal deactivators and/or anti-foam agents. Pour point depressants are a particularly useful type of additive often included in the lubricating oils described herein.  The use of such pour point depressants in oil-based compositions to improve low temperature properties of oil-based compositions is well known in the art.  See, for example, page 8 of "Lubricant Additives" by C.V. Smalheer and R. Kennedy Smith (Lezius-Hiles Co. publishers, Cleveland, Ohio, 1967).

polyacrylamides; condensation products of haloparaffin waxes and aromatic compounds; vinyl carboxylate polymers; and terpolymers of dialkylfumarates, vinyl esters of fatty acids and alkyl vinyl ethers.  Pour point depressants useful for the purposes of this invention, techniques for their preparation and their uses are described in U.S. Patents 2,387,501; 2,015,748; 2,655,479; 1,815,022; 2,191,498; 2,666,746; 2,721,877; 2,721,878; and 3,250,715 which are herein incorporated by reference for their relevant disclosures.<br>
Anti-foam agents are used to reduce or prevent the formation of stable foam. Typical anti-foam agents include silicones or organic polymers.  Additional anti-foam compositions are described in "Foam Control Agents", by Henry T. Kerner (Noyes Data Corporation, 1976), pages 125-162.<br>
These additional additives, when used, are present in the inventive lubricating and functional fluid compositions at sufficient concentrations to provide the compositions with enhanced properties, depending upon their intended use.  For example, the pour point depressant are added at sufficient concentrations to provide the inventive compositions with enhanced pour point depressant characteristics, while the antifoam agents are added at sufficient concentrations to provide the inventive compositions with enhanced antifoaming characteristics.  Generally, each of these •additional additives are present in the lubricants and functional fluids at concentrations from about 0.01%, or from about 0.05%, or from about 0.5%. These additional additives are generally present in an amount up to about 10% by weight, or up to about 5% by weight, and or up to about 3% by weight.<br>
In one embodiment, the lubricating compositons contain less than 2%, or less than 1.5%, or less than 1% by weight of a dispersant.   In another embodiment, the lubricating compositions are free of lead based additives, metal (zinc) dithiophosphates, and alkali or alkaline earth metal borates.<br>
