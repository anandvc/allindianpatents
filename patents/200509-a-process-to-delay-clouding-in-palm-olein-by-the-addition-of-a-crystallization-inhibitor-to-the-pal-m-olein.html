FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
     The present invention relates to a process to delay clouding in palm olein by the addition of crystallization inhibitor to the palm olein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      Cloud formation in palm olein during transportation and storage in cold climates is a problem. The cloud formation is due to crystallization of palm olein when the palm olein is subjected to low temperatures. Single fractionated palm olein may cloud during display on supermarket shelves. Although there is nothing wrong with the oil quality, it is important to prevent crystallization because consumers perceive a cloudy oil as deteriorated oil. The crystals formed in palm olein at low temperatures are high in diglycerides. On the other hand, diglycerides have been found to retard crystallization in oil and fats. The problem of clouding in palm olein has been partially overcome to a certain extent by blending with soft oils or adding additives or using a double fractionation method. Sorbitan tristearate was reported to inhibit crystal formation in oleins with low cloud points. The optimum dosage of sorbitan tristearate in palm olein depends on the test temperature, the higher the temperature, the higher the optimum dosage. A typical dosage is 0,05 - 0.15%. Adding ant-crystallizer (sorbitan tristearate) was reported to be more effective in resisting clouding in the palm olein rather than blending palm olein with 35% soya oil. US patent No. 2,097,720 discloses that a small proportion (less than 1%) of a polymerized oxidized mono-unsaturated disaturated glyceride was used to treat olive oil in order to prevent clouding or formation of stearin at low temperatures. US patent No. 2,393,744 discloses that soy lecithin can be used to depress the formation of crystals in cottonseed oil, thus prolonging cold test of the oil.<br>
      It is an objective of this invention to obtain a more effective method of preventing or delaying clouding in palm oiein per se or in blends of palm otein.<br><br>
SUMMARYRY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process to delay clouding in palm olein by the addition of a crystallization inhibitor, such as herein described, to the palm olein characterized in that the process comprises the steps: -<br>
i)        elevating the temperature of palm olein to between 60 to 140°C;<br>
ii)       admixing a quantity of at least one crystallization inhibitor(s) with a hydrophilic-<br>
lipophilic balance value between 1 and 16 to a portion of said heated palm olein from<br>
      step (i); iii)      admixing the mixture of step (ii) to the remaining portion of heated palm olein from<br>
step (i) and maintaining the resulting mixture at temperature above 60°C until it has<br>
      become homogenized; iv)      cooling the mixture of step (iii) to room temperature or a temperature of supermarket<br>
display shelf.<br>
      In another aspect the invention relates to a process where crystallization inhibitors with a hydrophilic-Upophilic balance value of 1 is added to palm olein and me resultant mixture is heated to 130°C. The mixture is stirred until all the inhibitors are dissolved and thereafter the mixture is cooled before packing into individual containers.<br>
      Yet in another aspect the invention relates to a process of delaying clouding in a blend of palm olein and one or more vegetable oils selected from a group consisting of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil or canola oil, corn oil, olive oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil, mustard seed oil and peanut oil. A small proportion of crystallization inhibitors is added to the blend. The mixture is heated to a temperature between 60 to 140°C until all the crystallization inhibitors are completely dissolved.<br>
      The palm olein has an iodine value between 55 and 70 and is obtained from either single or double fractionation of palin oil or from a mixture of both.<br>
    The crystallization inhibitors include sucrose esters of fatty acids, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids and wherein the fatty acids are of any chain lengths from C4 to C24. The crystallization inhibitor also include sorbitan tristearate which is added to palm olein blended with other edible oils. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
      This invention relates to a process to prevent or delay clouding in palm olein and blends of palm olein with other oils during handling, distribution and storage. By preventing clouding, clarity of the oil can fee maintained. The term 'clouding' refers to cloud formation as a result of crystallization of palm olein when subjected to low or air-conditioned temperatures. The term palm olein refers to the liquid fraction obtained in the fractionation process of palm oil. The term palm olein as used herein refers to that having an IV of 55 to 70.<br><br>
3<br>
       The invention relates to a process of blending palm olein with a certain type of additive or emulsifier. The additive/emulsifier includes a compound of sucrose and fatty acids derived from edible oils and fats. The fatty acids comprise one or more C4 to C24 fatty acids and they may be saturated or unsaturated and may have straight or branched chains. The addifives/emufsifier which act as crystal inhibitors in this invention can be In the form of liquid, waxy substances, powder, paste or pellets. The colour can range from white to yellow, brownish-yellow or slightly greyish white. The acid value should not be more than 6, free sugar not more than 5% and water content not more than 4%f<br>
       Another type of additive is polyglycerol esters of fatty acids. Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are mixed partial esters formed by reacting polymerized glycerois with edible fats, oils or fatty acids. The fatty acids may comprise one or more C4 to C24 fatty acids and they may be saturated or unsaturated and may have straight or branched chains. Minor amounts of mono-, di, and triglycerides, free glycerol and potyglycerols, free fatty acids and sodium salts of fatty acids may be present The polyglycerols vary in degree of polymerization. By varying the<br>
large and diverse class of products may be obtained. The product characteristics can be varied for instance the colour may range from light yellow to amber and from light tan to brown. The products' consistency can range from oily to very viscous liquid, plastic or soft solids to hard, waxy solids, the esters range from very hydrophitic to very lipophilic.<br>
       The selected emulsifiers should have hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values between 1 to 16. They have been found to have a favourable influence on crystallization behavior of oils and fats. The use of emtilsifiers as food additives Is governed by legislation in most countries in the world. These emulsifiers are very safe and harmless. They have been used in human foods for many years. The said emulsifiers are used in this invention as crystal inhibitors, also known as anti-crystallizers. Crystal inhibitors or anti-crystallizers are materials which when added to an oil, retard crystal formation. The amount of crystal inhibitor used is between 0.005% to 2.0% by weight of the palm olein. The efficiency of the crystal inhibitor to prevent clouding in palm olein varies with the temperature of storage and levels of crystal inhibitor used.<br>
       The crystal inhibitor or mixture of crystal inhibitors and palm olein can be mixed together in any convenient manner. For instance, if the crystal inhibitor is in a liquid form, it can be mixed directly with palm otein. However, it is better to stir and heat the mixture to ensure<br><br>
4<br>
that it is homogeneous, if the crystal inhibitor is in a solid form, it can be dissolved in the palm olein. It is desirable to heat the palm olein or the mixture to facilitate homogeneous solution.<br>
       The process may also involve mixing the crystal inhibitors thoroughly with a portion of palm olein which is preheated to a temperature above 60°C. The mixture is stirred and the remaining palm olein is added to the mixture and heating is continued to ensure formation of a homogeneous mixture.<br>
Example 1<br>
       A measured quantity of palm olein was filtered using Whatman qualitative filter paper (Whatman International Ltd. England) and filter funnels in a warming cabinet at 60°C. Then, beakers labeled with the name of the crystal inhibitor and the percentage used were prepared. Filtered palm olein was poured into each beaker and heated to 130°C. Crystal inhibitor with HLB value between 1 to 5 was put into each beaker and mixed in thoroughly. The remaining palm olein was added to the mixture in the beakers and heating was continued at 130°C to ensure that ail triglycerides were melted. The mixture was poured into plastic bottles. The samples were allowed to cool at room temperature before they were stored at different temperatures. Observations were conducted daily to determine how long the samples remained clear. Cloud point was carried out according to AOCS method No. Cell-53. Cloud points of the samples ranged between 2 to 7°C.<br>
       Palm olein mixed with 0.5% crystal inhibitor stored at 20°C remained clear for more than 220 days. The control sample (without crystal inhibitor) remained clear at 20°C for 14 days only. At storage temperature of 15°C, the mixture remained dear for more than 130 days while the control sample remained clear for only 4 days at 15°C.<br>
Example 2<br>
       Another crystal inhibitor with an HLB value of 1 was added to palm olein at 0.05% and 0.1% by weight. The mixture was heated to a temperature above 60°C with continuous stirring. The heated mixture was poured into bottles and allowed to cool at room temperature. They were then stored in incubators at different temperatures, together with bottles containing palm olein without any additive as a control. The samples were inspected at regular intervals. The following results were obtained.<br><br>

"A PROCESS TO DELAY CLOUDING IN PALM OLEIN BY THE ADDITION OF A CRYSTALLIZATION INHIBITOR TO THE PALM OLEIN"<br>
       The invention discloses a process to delay clouding in palm olein by the addition of a crystallization inhibitor to the palm olein. The palm olein is first heated to a temperature of between 60 to 140°C. A small proportion of crystallization inhibitor with a hydrophilic -lipophilic balance value between 1 and 16 is added to a sample of palm olein and the mixture is stirred until homogenous. The stirred mixture is then added to the pre-heated palm olein and the resultant mixture is stirred until homogenous and is cooled before packing into individual containers.<br></td>
