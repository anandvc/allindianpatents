FIRSTOUT SHUTDOWN TRACING FOR FUEL PROCESSOR<br>
CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to the operation of a fuel processor and, more particularly, to the identification of a firstout shutdown condition in a fuel processor.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Fuel cell technology is an alternative energy source for more conventional energy sources employing the combustion of fossil fuels. A fuel cell typically produces electricity, water, and heat from a fuel and oxygen. More particularly, fuel cells provide electricity from chemical oxidation-reduction reactions and possess significant advantages over other forms of power generation in terms of cleanliness and efficiency. Typically, fuel cells employ hydrogen as the fuel and oxygen as the oxidizing agent. The power generation is proportional to the consumption rate of the react ants.<br>
A significant disadvantage which inhibits the wider use of fuel cells is the lack of a widespread hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen has a relatively low volumetric energy density and is more difficult to store and transport than the hydrocarbon fuels currently used in most power generation systems. One way to overcome this difficulty is the use of "fuel processors" or "reformers" to convert the hydrocarbons to a hydrogen rich gas stream which can be used as a feed for fuel cells. Hydrocarbon-based fuels, such as natural gas, LPG, gasoline, and diesel, require conversion processes to be used as fuel sources for most fuel cells. Current art uses multi-step processes combining an initial conversion process with several clean-up processes. The initial process is most often steam reforming ("SR"), autothermal reforming ("ATR"), catalytic partial oxidation ("CPOX"), or non-catalytic partial oxidation ("POX"). The clean-up processes are usually comprised of a combination of desulfurization, high temperature water-gas shift, low temperature water-gas shift, selective CO oxidation, or selective CO methanation. Alternative processes include hydrogen selective membrane reactors and filters.<br><br>
Thus, many types of fuels can be used, some of them hybrids with fossil fuels, but the ideal fuel is hydrogen. If the fuel is, for instance, hydrogen, then the combustion is very clean and, as a practical matter, only the water is left after the dissipation and/or consumption of the heat and the consumption of the electricity. Most readily available fuels (e.g., natural gas, propane and gasoline) and even the less common ones (e.g., methanol and ethanol) include hydrogen in their molecular structure. Some fuel cell implementations therefore employ a "fuel processor" that processes a particular fuel to produce a relatively pure hydrogen stream used to fuel the fuel cell.<br>
Fuel processor designs are typically highly involved. Typically, a substantial number of subsystems interact in a complicated manner to produce the hydrogen for the fuel cell. For instance, a fuel processor might mix water, air, and a fuel, and reform the mixture. Thus, the fuel processor may have a separate subsystems directed to delivering the water, air, and fuel to a mixing subsystem to produce the process feed gas. Quantities, pressures, and temperatures of the water, air, fuel, and process feed gas are controlled during the mixing process to achieve a desired composition for the process feed gas and prepare it for reforming. The mixing subsystem then delivers the process feed gas to a reforming subsystem in a controlled manner. The reforming process itself constitutes several smaller processes, each of which may occur at a different temperature and pressure.<br>
Any one of these quantities, pressures, temperatures, etc. may generate an error condition in the operation of the fuel processor for a host of reasons. Some of these error conditions may warrant shutting down the fuel processor until it can be corrected, i.e.9 a "shutdown." A fuel processor typically includes a control system that monitors these types of parameters for error conditions and shuts down the fuel processor. Upon shutdown, an operator or a maintenance technician ascertains the cause of the shutdown, corrects the problem, and then the fuel processor is brought back into operation.<br><br>
The involved design of the fuel processor frequently spawns a difficult problem in this context. A shutdown is usually initiated by a single shutdown error condition. This condition is referred to as the "firstout." However, the effects of the firstout typically propagate through the fuel processor very quickly, triggering other shutdown error conditions. Consequently, by the time the fuel processor is shut down, there may be very many shutdown error conditions present. The operator or maintenance technician must then wade through all these error to determine which was the firstout in order to correct the problem. The process of the determining which of the shutdown error conditions was the first out can be long and costly.<br>
The present invention is directed to resolving, or at least reducing, at least one of the problems mentioned above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method and apparatus for determining which condition in a fuel processor has initiated a shutdown of the fuel processor are disclosed. In general, the apparatus generates a plurality of shutdown initiator signals, each corresponding to one of a plurality of shutdown conditions and indicating whether such condition is present. The shutdown initiator signals are read within a predetermined window. At least one of the read shutdown initiator signals indicates that a corresponding first shutdown condition has occurred and identifies the corresponding first shutdown condition as the firstout. The apparatus includes, in various aspects, a controller implemented in a computing apparatus that is programmed to perform the method and a program storage medium encoded with instructions that, when executed, perform the method.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort, even if complex and time-consuming, would be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br><br>
FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of an apparatus 100 assembled and operated in accordance with the present invention. The apparatus 100 comprises a fuel processor 101, a fuel cell 103, and a computing device 105. In the illustrated embodiment, the fuel cell 103 is a Proton Exchange Membrane ("PEM") fuel cell, but other types of fuel cells may be used. The invention is not limited by the implementation of the fuel cell 103. More particularly, in the illustrated embodiment, the fuel processor 100 comprises several modular physical subsystems, namely:<br>
an autothermal reformer ("ATR") 102 that performs the oxidation-reduction reaction that reforms the fuel input to the fuel processor 100 into a reformate gas for a fuel cell 103;<br>
an oxidizer ("Ox"), which in the illustrated embodiment is an anode tailgas oxidizer ("ATO"), 104 that mixes steam, fuel, and air to create a fuel mixture delivered as a process feed gas to the ATR 102; a fuel subsystem 106, that delivers an input fuel (natural gas, in the illustrated embodiment) to the oxidizer 104 for mixing into the process feed gas delivered to the ATR 102;<br>
a water subsystem 108, that delivers water to the oxidizer 104 for mixing into the process feed gas delivered to the ATR 102; an air subsystem 110, that delivers air to the oxidizer 104 for mixing into the process feed gas delivered to the ATR 102; and a thermal subsystem 112, that controls temperatures in the operation of the ATR 102 in a manner described further below. Note that any hydrocarbon may be used for a fuel. Particular implementations of the ATR 102 and oxidizer 104 are illustrated in FIG. 2A, FIG. 2B.<br>
FIG. 2A depicts one particular implementation of the oxidizer 104. The oxidizer 104 receives fuel, water, and air through the feeds AT02, AT04, AT05, AT07 via the lines 213, 227, 223, 240, respectively, from the fuel subsystem 106, water subsystem 108, the air subsystem 110, and the ATR 102 through a plurality of check valves 226. The reformate gas feed AT05 is from a water separation system (discussed below) associated with the ATR 102. Exhaust from the anode (not shown) of the fuel cell 103 is returned to a water separator 248 (shown in FIG. 2B), that separates out the water that is drained via the solenoid valve 206 to the drain pain 219<br><br>
(also shown in FIG. 2B) and supplied to the oxidizer 104 through the line 229. The fuel, air, and dehydrated anode return are then mixed in the mixer 252, before introduction to the tank 254 of the oxidizer 104. The resultant mixture is then heated by the electric heater 256.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 2A, the oxidizer 104 also receives fuel, water, and air from the fuel subsystem 106, the water subsystem 108, and the air subsystem 110 through the feeds ATOl, AT06, AT03 over the lines 211, 242, and 225, described above. The lines 211 and 242 are protected by check valves 226. Air and fuel received over the lines 211 and 242 enter the enclosed coil 258. Water received over the line 225 enters the enclosed coil 260. The heated air and fuel mixture in the tank 254 heats the contents of the enclosed coils 258, 260, which are then mixed in the mixer 262 and provided to the ATR 102 through the feed ATR2 over the line 264. The oxidizer 104 is vented to an exhaust 263 through a line 265.<br>
FIG. 2B depicts one particular implementation of the ATR 102. The ATR 102 comprises several stages 282a - 282e, including numerous heat exchangers 278 and electric heaters 256. Each of the heat exchangers 278 receives temperature controlled water from the thermal subsystem 112 over the lines 270 - 273 and returns it over the lines 276 and the feed TS1. The exception are the heat exchangers 278 in the Preferential Oxidizer ("PrOx") 286, which receives the (not shown) from the thermal subsystem 112 over the line 274 and returns it to a water separator 248. Note that air from the water separator 248 is, in the illustrated embodiment, provided to the anode supply for the fuel cell. Byproduct from the operation of the ATR 102 is returned to the oxidizer 104 through a burst disk 284 and a feed AT07 in the line 250 and to the PrOx 286. The illustrated embodiment also includes a burst disk 284 that, when the ATR 102 overpressures, bursts so that the content of the ATR 102 is dumped to the oxidizer 104 via the line 240 and the feed AT07.<br>
One particular implementation 300 of the computing apparatus 105, first shown in FIG. 1, is illustrated in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B. The implementation 300 is rack-mounted, but need not be rack-mounted in all embodiments. Indeed, this aspect of any given implementation is not material to the practice of the invention.   The<br><br>
computing apparatus 300 may be implemented as a desktop personal computer, a workstation, a notebook or laptop computer, an embedded processor, or the like.<br>
The computing apparatus 300 illustrated in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B includes a processor 305 communicating with storage 310 over a bus system 315. The storage 310 may include a hard disk and/or random access memory ("RAM") and/or removable storage such as a floppy magnetic disk 317 and an optical disk 320. The storage 310 is encoded with a data structure 325 storing the data set acquired as discussed above, an operating system 330, user interface software 335, and an application 365. The user interface software 335, in conjunction with a display 340, implements a user interface 345. The user interface 345 may include peripheral I/O devices such as a key pad or keyboard 350, a mouse 355, or a joystick 360. The processor 305 runs under the control of the operating system 330, which may be practically any operating system known to the art. The application 365 is invoked by the operating system 330 upon power up, reset, or both, depending on the implementation of the operating system 330. In the illustrated embodiment, the application 365 is used to implement certain aspects of the present invention in a manner described more fully below. Note that the peripheral I/O devices can be used to implement a remote emergency shutdown switch for the fuel processor 100.<br>
Returning to FIG. 1, as previously mentioned, the present invention monitors signals indicating the state of the fuel processor 101 to determine whether shutdown conditions have occurred and, if so, to identify the firstout shutdown condition. In general, the fuel processor 101 generates a plurality of shutdown initiator signals in accordance with conventional practice, each corresponding to one of a plurality of shutdown conditions and indicating whether such condition is present. The computing apparatus 105 reads the shutdown initiator signals within a predetermined window. If a shutdown error condition has occurred, the computing apparatus detects, within the predetermined time window, that at least a first one of the read shutdown initiator signals indicates that a corresponding first shutdown condition has occurred. The computing apparatus 105 then identifies the corresponding first shutdown condition as the firstout.<br><br>
FIG. 4 illustrates in a block diagram a firstout functional block 400 and a plurality of shutdown initiator signals 402 implemented in one particular embodiment of the present invention. The shutdown initiator signals 402 are Boolean signals and each corresponds to a condition that can initiate a shutdown. The shutdown initiator signals 402 can be generated in accordance with conventional practice. In the illustrated embodiment, 30 shutdown initiator signals 402, individually denominated SI - S30, are monitored. In theory, any number of initiator signals 402 may be monitored. Thus, the invention is not limited by the number of shutdown initiator signals being monitored. However, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, there are practical limitations on the number. Most implementations will therefore monitor no more than about 30. The initiator signals 402 monitored in the illustrated embodiment are identified in Table 1 below, which also contains a definition of those signals.<br><br><br><br><br>
The shutdown initiator signals 402 are scanned every 50 milliseconds, or so. The precise interval between scans is a function of processor speed, and so does not limit the scope of the invention. The 50 millisecond period is a function of the operational frequency of the processor 305 (shown in FIG. 3B), and also defines a predetermined window in which each scan occurs. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, every 50 milliseconds the processor 305 reads all the shutdown initiator signals 402 within a 50 millisecond window.<br>
If a given shutdown initiator signal 402 is "ON" when scanned, it indicates that the corresponding shutdown condition has occurred and that the system is to be shut down. The firstout functional block 400 identifies the corresponding condition of any shutdown initiator signal that is "ON" during a scan as a firstout condition. Note that, in some circumstances, more than one of the shutdown initiator signals 402 may be "ON" in the same scan. In that case, one of the shutdown initiator signals 402 that is "ON" is identified as the firstout even though multiple firstout conditions may be present. The information regarding the other "ON" shutdown initiator signals 402 is also saved, however, for reporting and analysis. While identifying and reporting multiple firstout conditions may not be as desirable as identifying only a single firstout, it is still preferable to identifying none at all, or even a number as large as thirty. Thus, the invention is not limited to identifying only a single firstout condition. However, as a corollary, it is generally desirable to employ processors with higher operational frequencies that, as a consequence, generate scans more frequently.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts the internal structure of the firstout functional block 400 first shown in FIG. 4, including a select block 500, an activate block 502, and a plurality of latches 506 that latch the output of the select block 500 until reset. The select block 500 receives the input shutdown initiator signals 402 and "selects" the one (or more), if any, that are active "ON" during a scan. The activate block 502 disables the select block 500 when a shutdown initiator signal 402 is detected "ON" until such time as the system is reset. The structure and operation of the select block 500 and the activate block 502 are illustrated in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B and FIG. 7, respectively.<br><br>
FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B illustrate the reading logic of the select block 500 first shown in FIG. 5. The shutdown initiator signals 402 shown in FIG. 6A have already been multiplied by the FO_NOT_ACTIVE signal of the activate block 502 as shown in FIG. 5. The shutdown initiator signals 402 are then summed by the summer 602. The sum is inverted and output as the signal NO_SD_ACTIVE to the AND gate 508, shown in FIG. 5, to indicate whether any of the shutdown initiator signals 402 indicate that a shutdown condition has occurred. A comparator 604 then indicates whether the sum is greater than 1 (meaning there is more than one suthdown condition), which indication is input to the functional block 606.<br>
FIG. 6B is a conceptualized state diagram for the functional block 606 first shown in FIG. 6A. In state SI, if SELECT (i.e., the result of the comparison) = 0, then the functional block 606 begins reading the shutdown initiator signals 402, If none of the shutdown initiator signals 402 indicate a shutdown error condition has occurred, the functional block 606 enters state S7 and passes through the shutdown initiator signals 402 as output. If any shutdown initiator signal 402 indicates that a shutdown error condition has occurred, it is marked as the firstout and the remaining shutdown initiator signals 402 are passed through.<br>
Because the effects of the firstout can propagate quickly to generate additional shutdown error conditions, it is possible that two or more shutdown initiator signals 402 may be found to indicate a shutdown error condition in the same scan. This event is indicated when SELECT = 1 (i.e., the sum of the shutdown initiator signals 402 &gt; 1). The functional block 606 reads through the shutdown initiator signals 402 to see which indicates that a shutdown error condition has occurred. The functional block 606 reads the signals in states S2 and S3, and identifies the first shutdown initiator signal 402 indicating the corresponding shutdown error condition has occurred as the "firstout." The functional block then proceeds through states S5 and S6 to read the remaining shutdown initiator signals 402 indicate that their corresponding shutdown error has also occurred. The information from these shutdown initiator signals 402 is also saved, but they are not marked as the "firstout." Note that this algorithm will not necessarily detect the true firstout, but it will reduce the number of shutdown error conditions that must be investigated as the firstout.<br><br>
FIG. 7 depicts the internal logic of the activate block 502 first shown in FIG. 5. An OR function block 702 detects if any of the latches 506 has latched a valued and disables the FONOTACTIVE signal, thus holding the last shutdown signal value until reset. A second OR function block 704 assigns decimal number to each shutdown signal, thus allowing separate text message assignment to each. For example, the second OR function block 704 assigns the shutdown initiator signal S2 the text message "High Natural Gas Inlet Pressure Initiated Shutdown of the System."<br>
Returning to FIG. S, each shutdown initiator signal 402 has a corresponding latch 506. Each latch 506 contains Set-Reset flip-flop that latches the firstout signal coming out of the select block 500. The latches 506 lock the ON signal even if it happens spuriously and then disappears. For example, if a shutdown initiator signal is ON and than immediately OFF, such as for a spike in the pressure on the vessel. Without the latches 506, the select block 500 will discard active signal after it disappears, thus losing information an operator may be able to read only hours after it occurred.<br>
Returning now to FIG. 4, the logic 404 by which the state of the firstout function block 400 may be reset is also shown. Once a firstout condition is detected, the firstout function block 400 remains in that state until reset via the logic 404. The logic 404 includes elements 406, 408 that represent a Hit crossing and a transport delay, respectively. The logic 404 receives a "RESET" signal 410 from, e.g., a reset switch (not shown). The S-R flip-flop 412 latches the "RESET" signal and outputs it to the activate block 400 through its non-inverted output. The inverted output is terminated by the terminator 414.<br>
The functionality of the select block 500 is enabled if the firstout functional block 400 is not locked and waiting to be reset. The illustrated embodiment enables this functionality by multiplying a FO_NO_ACTIVE signal received over the line 504. The FO_NO_ACTIVE signal is generated by the activate block 502, which receives as inputs the firstout status of each corresponding condition from the latches 506.  If at least one of the shutdown indicator signals 402 is "ON" during the scan,<br><br>
this is propagated by the select block 500 through the latches 506 to the activate block 502, which is then disabled until a reset signal 410, first shown in FIG. 4, is received.<br>
The elements of FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6A, FIG. 6B, and FIG. 7 are described in terms of "functional blocks/' "flip-flops," and other logic circuits. These elements may, in some embodiments, be implemented in hardware. However, as those in the art having the benefit of this disclosure will appreciate, such functionality may frequently be implemented in either hardware or software. The choice may result from design constraints, economic constraints, or even the personal preference of the designer. In the illustrated embodiment, these elements are implemented in code emulating the operation of logic circuits. Thus, reference to a "functional block" or a "flip-flop" is, for the illustrated embodiment, reference to a block or section of code in, for instance, the application 365 (shown in FIG. 3B) that emulates the function of such a hardware element. However, alternative embodiments may choose to actually implement this functionality in hardware as initially described.<br>
Thus, at least some aspects of the present invention will typically be implemented as software on an appropriately programmed computing device, e.g., the computing apparatus 300 in FIG. 3A, FIG. 3B. The instructions may be encoded on, for example, the storage 310, the floppy disk 317, and/or the optical disk 320. The present invention therefore includes, in one aspect, a computing apparatus programmed to perform the method of the invention. In another aspect, the invention includes a program storage device encoded with instructions that, when executed by a computing apparatus, perform the method of the invention.<br>
Some portions of the detailed descriptions herein are consequently presented in terms of a software implemented process involving symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a memory in a computing system or a computing device. These descriptions and representations are the means used by those in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. The process and operation require physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, or optical signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated.  It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of<br><br>
