				<td>The invention relates to fine-particle alkaline-earth titanates and a method for the<br>
production thereof by reacting alkaline-earth metal compounds with titanium dioxide<br>
particles. The invention further relates to a micro-electronic component which contains an<br>
alkaline-earth titanate.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Due to their outstanding dielectric properties, alkaline-earth titanates, particularly BaTiO3,<br>
are suitable for the manufacture of micro-electronic components, such as multi-layer<br>
ceramic capacitors (MLCC).<br>
Alkaline-earth titanates may be produced by synthesis methods which take place by way<br>
of solid state reactions and by wet chemical methods.<br>
Hennings (J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 84 (2001) 2777 - 2782) describes a solid state reaction for<br>
producing BaTi03 from TiO2 with a particle size of 200 nm by calcination with BaCO3 at<br>
900 to 1200° C. The BaTiO3 produced in this manner is, however, highly agglomerated<br>
with crystallite sizes of 200 nm to 1 µm and must be disintegrated by milling.<br>
From studies on the formation mechanism by way of solid state reactions (A. Beauger, J.<br>
C. Mutin, J. C. Niepce, J. Mater Sci. 18 (1983), 3543 - 3550; J. C. Niepce, G. Thomas,<br>
Solid State Ionics 43 (1990) 69 - 76; D. F. Hennings, B. S. Schreinemacher, H.<br><br><br><br>
Schreinemacher, J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 84 (2001) 2777 - 2782) it is known that the<br>
formation reaction takes place mainly by diffusion of Ba2+ and O2- ions into the TiO2<br>
particles, i.e. the morphology of the BaTiO3 particles is determined primarily by the<br>
morphology of the TiO2 particles. On the other hand, the barium and oxide ions must be<br>
present at such temperatures that enable diffusion on one hand but which on the other<br>
hand only permit crystal growth processes of the TiO2 and BaTiO3 particles to a very<br>
small extent.<br>
DE 3635532 (D. Hennings, H. Schreinemacher) discloses a wet chemical process for<br>
producing BaTiO3 by co-precipitation of barium and titanium compounds and subsequent<br>
calcination. This method is very time-consuming and expensive as is the hydrothermal<br>
production of BaTiO3 from Ba(OH)2 or soluble Ba compounds and TiO2 using<br>
mineralisers, e.g. KOH, NaOH, (J. H. Lee, H. H. Nersiyan, C. W. Won, J. Mater Sci. 39<br>
(2004) 1397 - 1401, J. Moon, J. A. Kerchner, H. Karup, J. H. Adair. J. Mater Res. 14<br>
(1999)425-435).<br>
The reaction of barium hydroxide with fine-particle titanium dioxide is described in<br>
US2004/0028601 A1. In this case, the barium hydroxide octahydrate is first melted,<br>
whereby a highly concentrated aqueous solution of barium ions is formed, which is then<br>
reacted with titanium dioxide. In this case it is not, therefore, a solid state reaction. The<br>
cubic BaTiO3 formed in the process must thus be converted by calcination into the<br>
tetragonal modification in a subsequent step.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
Against the background of this prior art, it is the object of the present invention to provide<br>
fine-particle, high-purity and economically producible alkaline-earth titanates in addition<br>
to a method for the production thereof using simple substrates containing titanium.<br>
This object is achieved on one hand by a method for the production of alkaline-earth<br>
titanates by reacting alkaline-earth metal compounds with titanium dioxide particles with<br>
a BET surface area greater than 50 m2/g in a solid state reaction, whereby the reaction<br>
takes place at temperatures below 700° C.<br>
On the other hand, the object is achieved by a method for the production of alkaline-earth<br>
titanates by reacting alkaline-earth metal compounds with titanium dioxide particles with<br>
a BET surface area greater than 50 m2/g, whereby the titanium oxide particles have a<br><br>
sulphate content 
of
The object is further achieved by the provision of an alkaline-earth titanate which is<br>
producible by means of the method according to the invention. The alkaline-earth titanate<br>
may have a BET surface area of 5 to 100 m2/g and no hydroxyl groups built into the<br>
crystal lattice.<br>
The invention additionally covers the provision of a micro-electronic component<br>
comprising an alkaline-earth titanate according to the invention.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
1.1 The Titanium Dioxide Particles<br>
The titanium dioxide particles used according to the invention have a BET surface area<br>
greater than 50 m2/g, preferably less than 450 m2/g, in particular preferably 200 to 380<br>
m2/g, in particular preferably 250 to 350 m2/g. In this regard, determination of the BET<br>
surface area is in accordance with DIN ISO 9277 by means of N2 at 77 K on a sample of<br><br><br>
the titanium dioxide particles outgassed and dried for 1 hour at 140° C. The evaluation is<br>
carried out by way of multi-point determination (10-point determination).<br>
The titanium dioxide particles used according to the invention are regularly titanium<br>
oxide hydrate particles, i.e. the particles contain chemisorbed water and if necessary<br>
H2SO4 and/or other inorganic and/or organic components.<br>
Preferably the titanium dioxide particles contain 0.4 to 25 weight % water, in particular<br>
preferably 2 to 10 weight % water.<br>
The H2SO4 content of the titanium dioxide particles is preferably less than 1.5 weight %,<br>
more preferably less than 1.0 weight %, even more preferably less than 0.4 weight %, in<br>
particular preferably between 0.01 to 0.3 weight %, in particular preferably between 0.01<br>
to 0.08 weight %, in relation to TiO2 in each case.<br>
The weight percentage details of the titanium dioxide's material contents shown here and<br>
listed in the following relate to a sample dried according to ISO 787 Part 2.<br>
Determination of the H2O content of the titanium dioxide particles may be carried out<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
H2O content (%) = annealing loss (%) - H2SO4 content (%)<br>
In this case the annealing loss is the weight loss of a sample dried according to ISO 787<br>
Part 2 after annealing for one hour at a temperature of 1000° C. The H2SO4 content is<br>
determined on the basis of the analytical determination of the sulphur content of the<br>
sample dried according to ISO 787 Part 2. Determination of the sulphur content takes<br>
place by combustion and gas chromatographic detection of the combustion gases by<br>
means of thermal conductivity detection (TCD).<br>
By approximation, it is also possible to equate the H2O content of the titanium dioxide<br>
particles with the annealing loss after annealing for one hour at 500° C of the sample<br>
dried according to ISO 787 Part 2.<br>
Precise determination of the H2O content of the titanium dioxide particles may be carried<br>
out, for example, by gas chromatographic analysis of the volatile constituents which are<br><br><br>
formed after annealing for one hour at a temperature of 1000° C of a sample dried<br>
according to ISO 787 Part 2.<br>
Preferably the carbon content of the titanium dioxide particles is less than 1000 ppm, in<br>
particular preferably less than 500 ppm, in particular preferably less than 50 ppm, in<br>
relation to T1O2. Determination of the carbon content is carried out by combustion and gas<br>
chromatographic detection of the combustion gases by means of thermal conductivity<br>
detection (TCD).<br>
The halide content of the titanium dioxide particles used according to the invention is<br>
preferably less than 1000 ppm, in particular preferably less than 500 ppm, in particular<br>
preferably less than 50 ppm, in relation to TiO2. In particular the chloride content of the<br>
particles is preferably less than 1000 ppm, in particular less than 200 ppm, even more<br>
preferably less than 100 ppm, in particular preferably less than 20 ppm, in relation to<br>
TiO2.<br>
The niobium content in the titanium dioxide particles may be less than 2000 ppm,<br>
preferably 10 to 1000 ppm, preferably 30 to 1000 ppm, in particular 50 to 100 ppm, in<br>
relation to TiO2.<br>
The sodium and/or potassium content in the titanium dioxide particles used according to<br>
the invention is preferably less than 200 ppm, in relation to TiO2.<br>
The iron content of the titanium dioxide particles used according to the invention is<br>
preferably less than 100 ppm, even more preferably less than 30 ppm, in particular<br>
preferably less than 10 ppm, in relation to TiO2.<br>
The titanium oxide particles used according to the invention may be obtained by<br>
hydrolysis of inorganic or organic titanium compounds. Depending on the titanium<br>
compound and the reaction conditions, the titanium dioxides obtained in the process have<br>
different properties.<br>
It is possible to produce the titanium oxide particles used according to the invention in<br>
good quality and cost-effectively by hydrolysing titanyl sulphate solution. It is also<br>
possible, however, to produce the titanium oxide hydrate particles from titanium<br>
tetrachloride or titanium alkoxide.<br><br><br>
In the case of titanium oxide hydrate, which is obtained by hydrolysing titanyl sulphate<br>
solution, there is a particularly advantageous combination of properties, that is to say a<br>
high specific surface area and a microcrystalline anatase structure. This anatase structure<br>
may be identified as microcrystalline material due to the broad reflexes of the X-ray<br>
diffractogram (see Fig. 1).<br>
Preferably, the particles used according to the invention thus contain less than 10 weight<br>
%, in particular preferably less than 1 weight %, rutile in relation to TiO2. Particularly<br>
preferable are titanium dioxide particles which clearly exhibit an anatase structure in the<br>
X-ray diffractogram.<br>
The titanium oxide hydrate particles may, for example, be obtained by hydrolysis of a<br>
titanyl sulphate solution containing sulphuric acid. Depending on the origin and<br>
composition of the titanyl sulphate solution containing sulphuric acid, on hydrolysis a<br>
sulphuric acid suspension of titanium oxide hydrate is obtained, which may still contain<br>
undesirable contaminants, in particular heavy metals. Generally speaking, one or a<br>
plurality of purification steps are, therefore, carried out to free the titanium oxide hydrate<br>
of undesirable contaminants.<br>
Preferably titanium oxide hydrate particles, which are formed by hydrolysing titanyl<br>
sulphate that is generated in the production process for titanium dioxide according to the<br>
sulphate method, are used. This process is described, for example, in Industrial Inorganic<br>
Pigments 3rd edition, published by Gunter Buxbaum, Gerhard Pfaff, Wiley-VCH,<br>
Weinheim 2005.<br>
Particularly preferred, the titanium oxide hydrate obtained after hydrolysis is freed from<br>
adherent contaminants by filtering and washing it and, if necessary, by subjecting it<br>
additionally to the process step, known as bleaching, of a chemical treatment with<br>
reduction agents to eliminate trivalent iron.<br>
Aluminium (powder), titanium hydride or sodium hydroxymethane sulphinate dihydrate<br>
(trade name: Brüggolith®) are suitable, for example, as reduction agents for the bleach.<br>
Commercial production of titanium oxide hydrate based on the sulphate method for the<br>
production of titanium dioxide also has the advantage of consistent product quality and<br>
continuous availability.<br><br><br>
In order to obtain a particularly high level of purity, it is advantageous to use not the<br>
commercial titanyl sulphate solution containing metal ions and sulphuric acid but a titanyl<br>
sulphate solution containing synthetic sulphuric acid which only contains small amounts<br>
of contaminants. Such a titanyl sulphate solution may, for example, be produced by<br>
hydrolysing high-purity TiCl4 or titanium esters and by dissolving the precipitate obtained<br>
with sulphuric acid. The production of a high-purity titanium oxide hydrate from this may<br>
take place either analogously with conventional commercial processes or with specific<br>
deviations.<br>
The adherent sulphuric acid is preferably removed by reaction with a base (e.g. NaOH,<br>
KOH, NH3) and subsequent washing out of the sulphate formed. If necessary, it is<br>
possible to arrange for subsequent elimination of the cations introduced due to reaction<br>
with the base by reacting them with acids (e.g. carbonic acids or nitric acid) that are<br>
thermally easily decomposable and by subsequent washing out.<br>
The reactions described above may be repeated several times depending on the purity<br>
desired.<br>
Of particular advantage with the titanium oxide hydrate obtained from titanyl sulphate is<br>
its high purity in respect of iron, aluminium and other metals as well as its extremely low<br>
contents of chloride and carbon.<br>
It may be advantageous to treat the titanium dioxide particles by means of a calcination or<br>
tempering step in order to modify the particle size and reactivity in a specific manner. The<br>
conversion of macrocrystalline titanium oxide hydrate into somewhat larger anatase<br>
crystallites may be particularly advantageous. In this regard, the calcination or tempering<br>
step should, however, be carried out such that the particular properties of the titanium<br>
oxide hydrate are not lost, i.e. the proportion of chemisorbed water (e.g. in the form of<br>
hydroxyl groups) should not become less than 0.4 weight %, preferably 2.0 weight %, in<br>
order to obtain a titanium oxide hydrate which is as reactive as possible.<br>
With titanium oxide hydrate calcined at high temperatures, the reactivity drops<br>
significantly whilst the titanium oxide hydrate transforms into macrocrystalline TiO2 with<br>
a crystal size greater than 100 nm in the anatase or rutile modification with a content of<br>
chemisorbed water less than 0.4 weight %. Furthermore, as already mentioned, coarser<br>
titaniferous particles induce the formation of a coarser alkaline-earth titanate.<br><br>
According to the invention, preferably titanium oxide hydrate particles are used, which<br>
after annealing for one hour of a sample pre-dried according to ISO 787 Part 2 at a<br>
temperature of 1000°C, have an annealing loss greater than 2 weight %, preferably greater<br>
than 6 weight % and/or after annealing for one hour at 500°C have an annealing loss<br>
greater than 0.8 weight %, preferably greater than 1.2 weight %.<br>
Primary particles of the titanium oxide hydrate with an average particle size of 3 to 15<br>
nm, preferably 4 to 8 nm, are obtained by means of the process steps described according<br>
to the invention as a result of which, by comparison with conventional gas phase<br>
processes, a technically and economically improved production process is provided for<br>
the formation of nanoparticulate materials containing titanium oxide hydrate.<br>
The primary particles are small, approximately spherical, microcrystalline particles with a<br>
lattice-defective anatase structure. The particle size may be determined by calculation<br>
from the BET surface area assuming a monomodal grain size distribution of spherical<br>
particles. Assuming a monomodal grain size distribution and spherical particles, the<br>
relationship between the average particle size d and the specific surface area SBET<br>
(determined according to BET) is given by the equation<br><br>
where SBET is in m2/g, ρ = density of the particle in g/cm3, d is in urn. The densities used<br>
are: 6.02 g/cm3 (for BaTiO2) 3.90 g/cm3 (for TiO2 as titanium oxide hydrate or anatase),<br>
4.26 g/cm3 (for TiO2 as rutile).<br>
By contrast, significantly coarser particle sizes are determined in an analysis of the<br>
particle size by means of scattered light measurements. The values thus determined<br>
(approx. 0.5 - 1.5 nm) are higher than those of TiO2 used according to prior art at approx.<br>
0.25 urn (see comparative example 2).<br>
Surprisingly, it was discovered that the titanium dioxide particles used according to the<br>
invention have significant advantages in respect of their suitability for the production of<br>
alkaline-earth titanates over conventional titanium dioxide, such as commercially<br>
available technical titanium dioxides. Thus, particularly fine-particle alkaline-earth<br>
titanates are obtained presumably because of the high specific surface area, the small<br><br>
particle size of titanium oxide hydrate and the high reactivity during reaction with<br>
alkaline-earth compounds.<br>
Moreover, the low chloride and carbon content of the titanium oxide hydrate particles<br>
according to the invention have a positive effect on the properties of the alkaline-earth<br>
titanates. The small content of chloride and metallic trace elements has a favourable effect<br>
on the electrical properties of the alkaline-earth titanates produced from the titanium<br>
oxide hydrate whilst the low content of carbon ensures that there is no intermediate<br>
reduction of TiO2 and no intermediate formation of alkaline-earth carbonates and,<br>
therefore, particularly fine-particle alkaline-earth titanates may be obtained. The presence<br>
of halides or carbon is disruptive particularly at low reaction temperatures to the alkaline-<br>
earth titanate.<br>
1.2 The Alkaline-Earth Metal Compound<br>
The titanium dioxide particles are reacted according to the invention with one or a<br>
plurality of alkaline-earth metal compounds. Generally speaking, the compounds<br>
concerned are salts of one of the alkaline-earth metals magnesium, calcium, strontium<br>
and/or barium, if necessary with lead or yttrium added, and/or mixtures thereof. Barium<br>
compounds for the production of barium titanate (BaTiO3) are particularly preferred. The<br>
salts include carbonates, oxalates, hydroxides, oxides, nitrates, halides such as chlorides,<br>
as well as organic compounds such as alkoxides and salts of carbonic acids, such as<br>
acetates.<br>
Particularly preferred are oxidic alkaline-earth metal compounds or alkaline-earth<br>
compounds which decompose at a temperature below 600°C (e.g. with formation of<br>
alkaline-earth metal oxide). Thus, amongst the barium salts, barium hydroxide, barium<br>
nitrate and other easily decomposable barium compounds and mixtures thereof are<br>
particularly preferred. Barium carbonate, however, only forms barium oxide at higher<br>
temperatures (approx. 1000°C). Barium oxalate and barium acetate are also less preferred<br>
as they initially decompose to barium carbonate.<br>
The decomposition temperatures may, for example, be determined in combined<br>
thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermoanalysis (DTA) apparatus.<br><br>
1.3 On Controlling the Reaction Process<br>
The titanium dioxide particles characterised previously are used according to the<br>
invention in a method for the production of alkaline-earth titanates with the alkaline-earth<br>
metal compounds referred to previously. The invention provides in particular two<br>
versions of the method:<br>
In the first version according to the invention, the alkaline-earth titanates are obtained by<br>
reacting alkaline-earth metal compounds with the titanium dioxide particles defined as in<br>
Section 1.1 in a solid state reaction, whereby the reaction takes place at temperatures<br>
below 700°C. The reaction temperature is preferably 650°C or less, even more preferably<br>
600°C or less. According to the invention, a solid state reaction is understood to be a<br>
chemical reaction between two or more solids in the absence of a solvent such as water,<br>
for example. This contrasts with wet chemical and also hydrothermal methods in which,<br>
for example, solutions containing barium ions are initially produced.<br>
For the first reaction version according to the invention, such alkaline-earth metal<br>
compounds as decompose at a temperature below 600° C are used in particular (e.g. with<br>
formation of alkaline-earth metal oxide). Thus, amongst the barium salts, barium<br>
hydroxide, barium nitrate and other easily decomposable barium compounds and mixtures<br>
thereof are particularly preferred.<br>
The minimum reaction temperature which is necessary for complete reaction to the<br>
titanate may be determined by means of DTA. Powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) is<br>
well suited to detecting the completeness of decomposition reactions. Using this method,<br>
the crystalline phases are detected and may be determined by comparison with the<br>
compounds in databases e.g. JCPDS; the detection limit is around 5%.<br>
A reaction is defined as complete reaction to the alkaline-earth titanate if both the reaction<br>
is complete in the DTA and also no other reflexes (peaks) than those of the target<br>
compound occur in the XRD. In this regard, if no external reflex exhibits more than 5%<br>
of the intensity of the target compound's main reflex, then this is considered as the<br>
absence of other reflexes.<br>
Hence the temperature of complete reaction is the lowest temperature at which the<br>
reaction has taken place completely as defined by the preceding definition.<br><br>
It is particularly preferred according to the invention to Carry out the reaction at no more<br>
than 100° C (particularly preferred no more than 50° C) above this minimum reaction<br>
temperature.<br>
If barium hydroxide is used (e.g. the octahydrate, the monohydrate or anhydrous barium<br>
hydroxide), then the reaction temperature is preferably less than 450° C, in particular<br>
preferably between 350° and 450° C. If barium nitrate is used, then the reaction<br>
temperature is preferably less than 650° C, in particular preferably between 550° and<br>
650° C.<br>
For the production of alkaline-earth titanates (e.g. BaTiO3), it is possible to dry grind the<br>
titanium dioxide particles and the alkaline-earth metal compound (e.g. barium nitrate or<br>
barium hydroxide) together and to calcine them subsequently at a temperature below<br>
700° C (preferably below 600° C). Alternatively, the titanium dioxide particles and the<br>
alkaline-earth metal compound (e.g. barium nitrate or barium hydroxide) may be wet<br>
ground together, then dried and subsequently calcined at a temperature below 700° C<br>
(preferably below 600° C).<br>
Wet grinding lends itself particularly to this if the titanium dioxide particles are already<br>
present in the aqueous phase (as suspension). Wet grinding is carried out preferably with<br>
mechanically agitated ball mills due to the high specific energy deposit. It may be<br>
advantageous to use ZrO2 grinding media to prevent undesirable contamination<br>
(particularly Si, Fe and Al) of the material being ground due to abrasion of the grinding<br>
medium.<br>
In wet grinding it is not predominantly the primary particle size of the titanium dioxide<br>
particles which is improved but their agglomeration state. In particular with very fine-<br>
particle titanium dioxide and titanium oxide hydrate primary particles, these are highly<br>
agglomerated with the result that the effective size of the agglomerates may be a hundred<br>
times the primary particle size. The agglomerate size is normally ascertained by means of<br>
scattered light measurements (e.g. with a Malvern Mastersizer such as is generally<br>
standard in the field of pigment technology) whilst the primary particle size is determined<br>
by electron microscope or by way of BET surface area determinations.<br>
The use of organic additives as dispersing agents may be particularly advantageous. Their<br>
presence - particularly during the grinding stage - brings about a significant improvement<br>
in the titanium dioxide's agglomerate structure.<br><br>
When using organic dispersing agents it is also possible to obtain a suspension which is<br>
stable against sedimentation and can be used for further processing. The use of ultrasound<br>
can also further improve the dispersive state.<br>
It is in particular preferable to add a water soluble barium compound or an aqueous<br>
barium salt solution to an aqueous suspension of titanium oxide hydrate and to dry this<br>
suspension. Dispersion may take place under the influence of ultrasound. A titanium<br>
oxide hydrate is obtained in the process, on the surface of which the alkaline-earth<br>
compound is evenly distributed. The titanium oxide hydrate thus obtained and coated with<br>
the alkaline-earth metal compound may subsequently be subjected to the solid state<br>
reaction, e.g. calcined.<br>
Drying is carried out preferably by means of spray drying. In this manner a homogeneous<br>
distribution of the components and particularly easily redispersible drying agglomerates<br>
are obtained. Alternatively, drying may take place on the rotary evaporator or by freeze<br>
drying.<br>
Thus the invention also provides a powdery preparation containing titanium oxide<br>
particles with a BET surface area greater than 50 m2/g and a water-soluble alkaline-earth<br>
compound whereby the mole ratio of titanium and alkaline-earth metal lies between 0.95<br>
and 1.05. Preferably such a preparation is present in dried form. In the production of this<br>
preparation as an intermediate product for the titanate it is possible, if necessary, to add<br>
doping compounds. Semi-conducting doped alkaline-earth titanates obtained therefrom by<br>
calcination are the essential components of temperature-dependent resistors.<br>
It is also possible to carry out drying and calcination in a single process step.<br>
Calcination of the titanium dioxide particles with the alkaline-earth metal compound takes<br>
place preferably not isothermally but at an approximately constant conversion rate to the<br>
alkaline-earth titanate (SCRT method, described in Gotor et al, J. Europ. Cer. Soc. 23<br>
(2003), 505-513).<br>
Surprisingly, it has also been shown that calcination is possible at a temperature which<br>
lies below the temperature at which the pure alkaline-earth metal compound decomposes<br>
to the oxide. With regard to the fineness of the titanate obtained, it is possible according<br>
to the invention to carry out the calcination at a temperature which is in the range between<br><br>
50° C and 200° C below the temperature at which the alkaline-earth metal compound<br>
used decomposes to the oxide.<br>
Following calcination, the alkaline-earth titanate may be further crushed or de-<br>
agglomerated by grinding, e.g. bead grinding.<br>
Particularly advantageous at the low calcination temperatures facilitated by the method<br>
according to the invention is the low fusion of the alkaline-earth titanate particles<br>
obtained. Hence the alkaline-earth titanate particles calcined at low temperatures are<br>
particularly easily pulverised or it may even be possible to dispense completely with<br>
pulverisation prior to further processing.<br>
In the second reaction version according to the invention, the production of alkaline-earth<br>
titanates takes place by reacting alkaline-earth metal compounds with titanium dioxide<br>
particles with a BET surface area greater than 50 m2/g, whereby the titanium dioxide<br>
particles have a sulphate content 
carbon content of 
use alkaline-earth metal compounds which only enter into a solid state reaction with the<br>
titanium dioxide particles above 600° C or even 700° C, such as barium carbonate or<br>
barium oxalate for example. Furthermore, conversion is not necessarily carried out in the<br>
sold state reaction described with regard to the first reaction version but rather it may also<br>
be carried out wet chemically or hydrothermally.<br>
Thus, according to this version, the titanium dioxide particles may be reacted with a<br>
water-soluble alkaline-earth metal compound (e.g. barium nitrate or barium hydroxide) to<br>
alkaline-earth titanate (e.g. BaTiO3), whereby the particles are suspended in the solution<br>
containing Ba2+ already produced or are suspended together with the Ba salt in water,<br>
subsequently the solvent is evaporated and the mixture is calcined at below 600° C.<br>
The alkaline-earth titanate may also be obtained under hydrothermal conditions by<br>
reacting the titanium dioxide particles directly with an alkaline-earth compound. Thus, a<br>
Ba(OH)2 solution may be reacted with the titanium dioxide particles in an autoclave at pH<br>
&gt; 13, at a temperature greater than or equal to 100° C over a period of preferably at least 1<br>
hour whereby barium titanate is obtained directly. For the hydrothermal reaction version,<br>
a smaller sulphate content is of particular importance since in this reaction version the<br>
formation of the alkaline-earth titanate takes place by way of soluble intermediate stages<br>
and thus the presence of sulphate leads to the formation of alkaline-earth sulphates.<br><br>
In both reaction versions, the volume ratios of alkaline-earth compound to titanium<br>
dioxide particles are adjusted by precision weighing. In this regard, the molar ratio Ba:Ti<br>
may deviate from 1 according to the barium titanate's precise application requirement.<br>
In particular, it is advantageous for the properties of the alkaline-earth titanate produced<br>
according to the present method according to the invention if the mole ratio of niobium to<br>
aluminium in the alkaline-earth titanate is 0.5 to 1.5, preferably 0.8 to 1.2, which may be<br>
brought about if necessary by adding a corresponding amount of an aluminium<br>
compound. Such a material is characterised by particularly good electric properties (e.g.<br>
low conductivity).<br>
For example, La, Y, Nb or Sb salts in orders of magnitude from 0.05 to 1.0 mole % in<br>
relation to BaTiO3 may be added as doping compounds.<br>
When using alkaline-earth compounds with high decomposition temperature, the<br>
advantage of the fine-particle nature of the titanium component is not used optimally:<br>
sintering and coarsening of the titanium component has already taken place at the<br>
temperatures necessary for decomposition of the alkaline-earth compound. Nevertheless,<br>
even when using alkaline-earth compounds which only decompose at high temperatures<br>
(e.g. alkaline-earth carbonates), it is possible to achieve a certain improvement in the fine-<br>
particle nature of the alkaline-earth titanates by means of fine-particle titanium<br>
components (see also Hennings (J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 84 (2001) 2777 - 2782)).<br>
This applies in particular if the alkaline-earth carbonates are wet ground together with the<br>
titanium component as a result of which very homogeneous and reactive mixtures are<br>
formed.<br>
1.4 The Alkaline-Earth Titanate<br>
The invention provides an alkaline-earth titanate which is obtainable according to the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
The alkaline-earth titanates obtained according to the invention preferably have a BET<br>
surface area of 5 to 100 m2/g, in particular preferably 20 to 60 m2/g.<br><br>
In the unground state, the alkaline-earth titanates obtained according to the invention<br>
preferably have a BET surface area greater than 5 to 50 m2/g, in particular preferably 15<br>
to 40 m2/g. The person of average skill in the art can usually differentiate between ground<br>
and unground powders by means of electron microscope images. A further criterion for<br>
differentiation of ground and unground powders is the ratio of the average particle sizes,<br>
which is obtained from the BET surface area and a scattered light determination of the<br>
particle size: in ground and de-agglomerated powders, the quotient of the two particle<br>
sizes is approximately equal to 1, whilst in unground powders the scattered light method<br>
generally results in a substantially larger average particle size than the BET method.<br>
In particular, the alkaline-earth titanates obtained according to the first method according<br>
to the invention have no OH groups built into the crystal lattice. The presence of OH<br>
groups built into the crystal lattice may be determined by means of IR spectroscopy. Due<br>
to the low concentration of the lattice-OH groups, the corresponding IR signals are very<br>
weak but characteristic (cf. G. Busca, V, Buscaglia, M. Leoni, P. Nanni, Chem. Mater. 6<br>
(1994) 955 - 61; D. Hennings, S, Schreinemacher, J. Eur. Ceram. Soc, 9 (1992) 41 - 46;<br>
in addition to H.-P. Abicht, D. Voltzke, A. Roder, R. Schneider, J. Woltersdorf, J. Mater.<br>
Chem. 7(1997)487-92).<br>
A characteristic band appears around 3500 cm"1. By comparison with the very diffuse<br>
bands, such as arise from H2O and OH groups adsorbed on the surface, the former are<br>
comparatively sharp. This is caused by the specific bonding energy in the lattice in<br>
relation to the different bonding possibilities and thus different bonding energies on the<br>
surface. This is consistent with a sharply occurring loss of mass in the temperature range<br>
just above 400° C. F. Valdivieso, M. Pijolat, C. Magnier, M. Soustelle, Solid State Ionics,<br>
83 (1996) 283 - 96 specify a temperature for this of 415° C.<br>
The chloride content of the titanate is preferably less than 100 ppm, in particular<br>
preferably less than 20 ppm.<br>
The niobium content of the titanate is preferably 10 to 300 ppm, in particular preferably<br>
15 to 100 ppm, even more preferably 15 to 50 ppm.<br>
The mole ratio of aluminium to niobium is preferably between 0.5 and 1.5. The<br>
determination of Nb and Al is carried out by means of ICP.<br><br>
In addition, the alkaline-earth titanate according to the invention preferably contains less<br>
than 500 ppm, preferably less than 200 ppm, sulphate.<br>
The alkaline-earth titanate according to the invention preferably contains less than 200<br>
ppm sodium or potassium.<br>
The alkaline-earth titanate according to the invention preferably contains less than 20<br>
ppm iron, preferably less than 5 ppm.<br>
BaTiO3, which has been produced according to the method according to the invention,<br>
preferably has a particle size of less than 250 nm.<br>
The alkaline-earth titanate according to the invention preferably has a predominantly<br>
tetragonal crystal structure, i.e. of more than 50 weight %, more preferably of more than<br>
70 weight %, even more preferably of more than 90 weight % and in particular preferably<br>
of more than 99 weight %, whereby the remainder is cubic alkaline-earth titanate and<br>
possibly contaminants. The phase purity of the product according to the invention may be<br>
determined by means of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), whereby quantitative<br>
estimation of the relevant fractions is possible by way of curve fitting.<br>
1.5 Microelectronic Components<br>
The alkaline-earth titanates according to the invention, in particular BaTiO3, may be used<br>
for the manufacture of a microelectronic component, e.g. of a capacitive or PTC<br>
component. Due to the fine-particle nature of the alkaline-earth titanates obtained, it is<br>
possible to realise particularly thin layers and thus particularly small component<br>
dimensions. Application in multi-layer ceramic capacitors is a particular consideration<br>
where, due to the fine-particle nature of the alkaline-earth titanate according to the<br>
invention, it is possible to obtain particularly thin layers (less than 2.5 urn, particularly<br>
preferred 0.1 to 1 urn). Such components may be manufactured by producing a slip out of<br>
the alkaline-earth titanate, if necessary together with organic additives, and pulling it out<br>
into thin films using various methods (spin coating, dip coating, doctor blade method).<br>
After adding the alkaline-earth titanates, the PTC components may be pressed into a green<br>
compact using a pressing agent, said compact being subsequently sintered.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail in the following on the basis of a few<br>
selected examples whereby the invention is in no way limited to these examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Barium titanate from titanium oxide hydrate and barium hydroxide<br>
78.87 g Ba(OH)2•8 H2O (Fluka, p.a.) and 21.95 g titanium oxide hydrate (9 weight %<br>
volatile constituents, anatase, BET: 271 m2/g, corresponding to a crystallite size of 6 nm;<br>
analytic information in relation to TiO2: 700 ppm S, 
Fe, 
litres of outgassed, distilled water. The mixture is dissolved or suspended whilst stirring<br>
for 1 hour at 50° C. Subsequently, the solvent water is removed on the rotary evaporator<br>
at 50° C under vacuum. The powder obtained is dried in the desiccator. The production<br>
steps are carried out in a shielding gas atmosphere to prevent the formation of BaCO3 due<br>
to the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with CO2 in the air.<br>
Calcination of the powder with formation of BaTiO3 takes places at temperatures T<br>
greater than or equal to 360° C. Following heat treatment for 2 hours at 400° C, a product<br>
with a specific surface area (determined according to BET) of 27.6 m3/g is obtained (Fig.<br>
2); following heat treatment for 2 hours at 600° C, a product with a specific surface area<br>
(determined according to BET) of 12.8 m2/g is obtained. In each case, only BaTiO3 is<br>
detected as the crystalline phase by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The BaTiO3<br>
crystallite sizes calculated from the specific surface areas are 36 and 78 nm respectively.<br>
After tempering at 1000° C (2 hours), the BET surface area is 3.2 rrrVg, corresponding to<br>
a crystallite size of 310 nm.<br>
After bead grinding of a 25% suspension of the product calcined at 600° C (20 minutes<br>
discontinuous bead grinding with zirconium silicate grinding beads of 0.4 - 0.6 mm<br>
diameter), the ground and dried barium titanate obtained has a BET surface area of 32.5<br>
m2/g.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
Barium titanate form titanium oxide hydrate and barium oxalate<br>
56.34 g BaC2O4 (manufactured by Alfa Aesar, Karlsruhe) and 21.95 g titanium oxide<br>
hydrate (composition as in Example 1) are mixed/ground with 0.313 litres of distilled<br>
water and 78 g PVC-coated steel balls for 24 hours in a PVC drum. After suction<br>
extraction and drying, the powder mixture is calcined. Temperatures of 950° C are<br>
necessary for a complete reaction of the BaCO3, which forms intermediately from the<br>
barium oxalate, with TiO2 with the formation of BaTi03. After tempering at 1000° C (2<br>
hours), the BET surface area is 2.8 m2/g; this corresponds to a BaTiO3 crystallite size of<br>
350 nm.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Barium titanate from titanium oxide hydrate and barium carbonate<br>
49.34 g BaCO3 (Solvay, Sabed VL 600, Lot No. 325510) and 21.95 g titanium oxide<br>
hydrate (composition as in Example 1) are mixed/ground with 0.280 litres of distilled<br>
water and 70 g PVC-coated steel balls for 24 hours in a PVC drum. After suction<br>
extraction and drying, the powder mixture is calcined. Temperatures of 950° C are<br>
necessary for a complete reaction of the BaCO3 with TiO2 with the formation of BaTiO3.<br>
After tempering at 1000° C (2 hours), the BET surface area is 2.2 m2/g; this corresponds<br>
to a BaTiO3 crystallite size of 450 nm.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Barium titanate from titanium oxide hydrate and barium nitrate<br>
65.34 g Ba(NO3)2 (p.a.) and 21.71 g titanium oxide hydrate (8 weight % volatile<br>
constituents, anatase, BET: 331 m2/g, corresponding to a crystallite size of 5 nm; 6400<br>
ppm S, 
with 1.0 litre of distilled water. The mixture is dissolved or suspended whilst stirring for<br>
10 minutes at 50° C. Subsequently, the solvent water is removed on the rotary evaporator<br>
at 50° C under vacuum. The powder obtained is oven dried at 120° C.<br>
Calcination of the powder with formation of BaTiO3 takes places at temperatures of<br>
600° C. Following heat treatment for 2 hours at 600° C, a product with a specific surface<br>
area (determined according to BET) of 3.6 m2/g is obtained. BaTiO3 is obtained as the<br>
crystalline phase. Following heat treatment for 2 hours at 800° C, a product with a<br><br>
specific surface area (determined according to BET) of 2.7 m2/g is obtained. BaTiO3 is<br>
detected as the only crystalline phase by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The<br>
BaTiO3 crystallite sizes calculated from the specific surface areas are 277 and 369 nm<br>
respectively.<br>
After tempering at 1000° C (2 hours), the BET surface area is 1.5 nf/g, corresponding to<br>
a crystallite size of 664 nm. After bead grinding, the BET surface areas of all samples are<br>
above 5 m2/g.<br>
Surprisingly, the decomposition processes of Ba(NO3)2 when mixed with TiO2 take place<br>
with significantly greater accentuation and clarity than in the pure substance (see Fig. 3).<br>
At approx. 600° C, the decomposition is almost completely finished after one step. In<br>
contrast, the pure substance does not react completely via the intermediate stage Ba(NO2)2<br>
until approx. 750° C.<br>
Following calcination of the sample for 2 hours at 600° C, in addition to the crystalline<br>
BaTiO3 small quantities of unreacted Ba(NO3)2 are still found which can be converted<br>
completely into the BaTiO3 by lengthening the calcination time.<br>
Following calcination at 400° C, only the mixture of the starting materials is present.<br>
Example 5:<br>
Compensation of Nb with different quantities of Al<br>
BaCO3 (Solvay Sabed VL 600) and a titanium oxide hydrate sample (9 weight % volatile<br>
constituents, anatase, BET: 316 m2/g, corresponding to a crystallite size of 5 nm;<br>
analytical data in relation to TiO2: 2300 ppm S, 
0.1% C, and with a niobium content of 810 ppm (mass fraction) (corresponding to<br>
approx. 0.07 mole %) served as starting materials. Aluminium in the form of the water-<br>
soluble salt Al(NO3)3•9H2O was added to compensate the niobium. 148.126 g BaCO3<br>
were ground/mixed for 24 hours with 65.723 g TiO2 and 0.2142 g A1(NO3)3•9H2O in 856<br>
ml distilled water using 213.8 g of plastic-coated steel balls in a ball mill. The grinding<br>
medium water was removed from this suspension in the rotary evaporator (approx. 50° C,<br>
60 mbar) with precipitation of the Al component and was subsequently oven dried at<br>
120° C. This was followed by calcination of the mixture for two hours at 1,100° C. The<br>
powders obtained therefrom were finely ground for 24 hours using steel balls and four<br>
times the amount of water in order to destroy the agglomerates formed during calcination.<br><br>
After suction extraction of the suspension, the powder was dried for 24 hours at 120° C,<br>
cooled to room temperature and mixed for 24 hours with a pressing agent (mixture of<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, water and glycerine) in the ball mill ("tempering"). This tempered<br>
powder was subsequently pressed into tablets (what are known as "green compacts") in a<br>
multi-stage procedure. The tablets were then sintered at four different temperatures<br>
ranging between 1,250° C and 1,400° C. The sintered tablets were ground smooth and<br>
subsequently provided with an In-Ga alloy on the front face of the tablets. The specific<br>
resistance was determined at room temperature. Fig. 5 shows the specific resistance of the<br>
ceramics as a function of the degree of compensation.<br>
Example 6:<br>
Hydrofhermal reaction of titanium oxide hydrate with barium hydroxide<br>
12.62 g (0.04 mole) Ba(OH)2•8H2O (p.a. Fluka Chemie GmbH) were placed with 3.51 g<br>
titanium oxide hydrate (composition as in Example 1) and 150 ml distilled and outgassed<br>
water in a Teflon beaker. The molar Ti/Ba starting ratio was 1.0. Reaction was carried out<br>
at 100° C whilst stirring the reaction mixture in a laboratory autoclave (Berghoff HR 200)<br>
with a hold time of one hour. Outgassed, CO2-free water was used in order to prevent<br>
possible formation of barium carbonate. A pH value of 13.7 arose with the BA(OH)<br>
2/solvent water ratios selected. After the reaction, the solid was suction filtered via a G4<br>
filter frit, washed several times with distilled water until a pH value of pH = 9 resulted<br>
and subsequently oven dried for 24 hours at 120° C. The reaction product obtained has a<br>
specific surface area (according to BET) of 20.7 m2/g and is unambiguously characterised<br>
as BaTiO3 by means of X-ray diffractometry. By using coarse-particle titanium dioxide<br>
(highly crystalline rutile, BET: 6 m2/g, as in Comparative Example 1) instead of the<br>
titanium oxide hydrate, there is practically no reaction to barium titanate. In the<br>
diffractogram only slight references to BaCO3 (at 20 = 24°) and BaTiO3 (at 20 = 31.6°)<br>
can be identified in addition to the rutile reflexes.<br>
Comparative Example 1:<br>
1.6 Reaction of coarse titanium dioxide with barium hydroxide<br>
78.87 g Ba(OH)2•8H2O (Fluka p.a.) and 19.98 g titanium dioxide (highly crystalline<br>
rutile, BET: 6 m2/g, corresponding to a crystallite size of 250 nm) are placed with 1.5<br>
litres of outgassed, distilled water in a 2 litre flask. The mixture is dissolved or suspended<br>
whilst stirring for 1 hour at 50° C. Subsequently, the solvent water is removed on the<br><br>
rotary evaporator at 50° C under vacuum. The powder obtained is dried in the desiccator.<br>
The production steps are carried out in a shielding gas atmosphere to prevent the<br>
formation of BaCO3 due to the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with CO2 in the air.<br>
Calcination of the powder takes places at temperatures of approx. 360° C. Following heat<br>
treatment for 2 hours at 400° C, a product with a specific surface area (determined<br>
according to BET) of 2.5 m2/g is obtained (see Fig. 4); following heat treatment for 2<br>
hours at 600° C, a product with a specific surface area (determined according to BET) of<br>
2.2 m2/g is obtained; and following heat treatment for 2 hours at 1000° C, a product with<br>
a specific surface area (determined according to BET) of 1.9 m2/g is obtained.<br>
Unlike Example 1, the main phase after tempering at 400° C is rutile, along with Ba2TiO4<br>
and BaTiO3 in addition to reacted or reverse-reacted Ba(OH)2 H2O. There is likewise no<br>
complete reaction to BaTiO3 to be ascertained after tempering at 600° C and 1000° C.<br>
Rutile and Ba2TiO4 occur as subsidiary phases.<br>
Comparative Example 2:<br>
1.7 Barium titanate from coarse titanium dioxide and barium carbonate<br>
98.67 g BaCO3 (manufactured by Solvay, Sabed VL 600, Lot No. 325510) and 39.95 g<br>
titanium dioxide (highly crystalline rutile, BET: 6 rrrVg, corresponding to a crystallite size<br>
of 250 nm) are mixed/ground for 24 hours with 0.550 litres of distilled water and 139 g<br>
PVC-coated steel balls in a PVC drum. After suction extraction and drying, the powder<br>
mixtures are calcined. Temperatures of approx. 950° C are necessary for complete<br>
reaction of the BaCO3 with TiO2 with the formation of BaTiO3. After tempering at<br>
1000° C (2 hours) the BET surface area is 2.0 m2/g; this corresponds to a BaTiO3<br>
crystallite size of 500 nm.<br><br>
