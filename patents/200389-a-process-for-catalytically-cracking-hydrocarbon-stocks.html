				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon oils in the absence of hydrogen, and specifically relates to a process for catalytic cracking of petroleum hydrocarbon stocks In the absence of hydrogen to increase simultaneously the yields of diesel oil and liquefied gas.<br>
Liquefied gas is one of the important petrochemical products, of which light olefins are important chemical raw materials of high commercial value. Diesel oil has high heat efficiency and the exhaust tail gas from vehicles running on diesel oil contains less harmful constituents, so it meets the more and more rigorous requirements for envircnmeT-cal protection all over the world. Thus, following the increase in the number of vehicles running on diesel oil, the market demand for diesel oils is also growing.<br>
Diesel oil comes mainly from fraction oils produced by the primary and secondary processing of crude oil. In the primary processing, i.e. the atmospheric and vacuum distillation , the yield of diesel fractions from crude oil is fixed, sc "o potential can be tapped. In the secondary processing, catalytic cracking is usually adopted for producing diesel oil . Featuring large-volume treatment and flexible operation conditions , this process of catalytic cracking is an important means for improving the yields of liquefied gas and diesel oil.<br>
CN1031834A discloses a catalytic cracking process for producing more light olefins. Although this process can produce large quantities of liquefied gas, but its yield of diesel oil is relatively low, generally less than 10wt%, and moreover it requires a special catalyst and processing unit.<br>
CN10858B5A discloses a method for obtaining higher yields of liquefied gas and gasoline under the following reaction conditions: a reaction temperature of 480°-550'C, a pressure of 130-350KPa,a WHSV of l-150h'S a catalyst/oil ratio of 4-15,<br><br>
and a steam/hydrocarbon stock weight ratio of 0.05-0.12:1. The yield of liquefied gas in the reaction products is 30-40wt% , but that of diesel oil is comparatively low.<br>
CNl160746A discloses a catalytic cracking process for raising the octane number of low-grade gasoline fractions, wherein a low-grade gasoline is introduced into a riser reactor through its lower part and the reaction is curried out under "he conditions of a reaction temperature of 600'-730°C, a WHSV of i-180h', and catalyst/oil ratio of 6-180, then a high octane gasoline is mainly obtained. The feedstocks employed in this process are low-grade gasolines, such as straight-run gasoline, Gc&gt;sr gasoline and so on, and the yields of liquefied gas and diesel oil In the reaction products are 24-39wt% and 0.5-2.3vt% respectively.<br>
USPS, 7 84 ,4 63 discloses a process carried out in a reaction system comprising at least two riser reactors, wherein a low-grade gasoline is introduced into one of the riser reactors and catalytic cracking reaction occurs. By this process, the gasoline octane number and yield of liquefied gas are improved. However, this process cannot give higher yield of diesel oil, and in requires that the reaction unit should be revamped by adding at least another riser.<br>
'JS?5,345,403 discloses a process of recracking of cacsiytic naphtha to obtain a maximum yield of light: olefins. The process is carried out in a riser reactor comprising two reaction zones, namely an upstream reaction zone in the lower part of the reactor and a downstream reaction zone in the upper part. In the upstream reaction zone, the feedstock is a light catalytic naphtha (having a boiling point below 140°C) , and the reaction conditions are: an oil-catalyst contact temperature of 620°-775°C, an oil and gas residence time of less than 1.5 sec, a catalyst/oil ratio of 75-150, and the proportion of steam accounting for 2-50wt% the weight of naphtha, while in the downstream reaction zone, the feedstock is a conventional catalytic cracking stock (having a boiling point of 220'-575°C) , and the reaction conditions are: a temperature of 600°-750°C and an oil and gas residence time of less than 20 sec. Compared with conventional catalytic cracking, the yields of liquefied gas and light cycle oil (i.e. diesel oil) of this process increase by 0,97-1.21 percentage points and 0,13-0.31 percentage points higher.<br><br>
CN1034949A discloses a process for converting petroleum hydrocarbons in which the stocks, ethane, gasoline, catalytic cracking stock and cycle oil, are successively upwardly introduced into a riser reactor through its lowermost part. This process is mainly aimed at producing light olefins, but the total yield of gasoline, diesel oil and liquefied gas decreases.<br>
ErG365536Ai disclosed a process for catalytic cracking hydrocarbon feedstock, in which a hydrocarbon feedstock is charged into the lower part of the riser reactor wherein said hydrocarbon feedstock is admixed with freshly regenerated cracking catalyst, and a recycle portion of a light liquid hydrocarbon stream is charged into the riser zone at a level above the hydrocarbon feedstock charging level. This process operates in such a manner to produce maximum quantities of fuel oil, or alternatively to produce maximum quantities of olefins in different conditions , but can' t increase the yields of diesel oil and of olefins simultaneously.<br>
US P4 ,422, 925 discloses a process for fluidized catalytic cracking hydrocarbon feedstock for producing gaseous olefins, which comprises charging gaseous C; to C, rich stock into the lowermost portion of the riser reaction zone to contact with hot freshly regenerated catalyst and charging heavy hydrocarbon stock to an upper section of the riser, and intrcducir.g naphnha or gas oil into a section between said lower and upper sections of said riser. This process can produce high yield of light olefins but the increment of yield of diesel oil is very small.<br>
US P3894932 disclosed a method for converting hydrocarbons which comprises passing C3-C4 gaseous hydrocarbon fraction through a lower portion of a riser, introducing gas oil at one or more spaced apart downstream intervals , and introducing C,-C, hydrocarbon or isobutylene or gas oil through the upper portion of the riser. This method is aimed at producing aromatics and isobutane but can't increase the yields of diesel oil and liquefied gas simultaneously.<br>
Another method of increasing the yield of liquefied gas is by adding a catalyst promoter to the catalytic cracking catalyst. For example, lA/ I'SXjS^yO A\ discloses a method of adding a HZSM-5 zeolite in an amount of 0.01-1% by weight of<br><br>
the catalyst directly into the catalytic cracking unit.<br>
USP3, 758, 403 discloses a catalyst comprising ZSM-5 zeolite and large-pore zeolite (e.g. the Y-type and X-type) (in a ratio of l:10-3:l)as active components, thereby raising the yield of liquefied gas and the gasoline octane number by a big margin, while the yields of propene and butene are increased by about 10wt%. Furthermore, CN10G457eB, USP4,9aO,053 and CN1043520^ have disclosed catalysts comprising mixtures of ZSM-5 zeolite and Y-type zeolite as active components, resulting in that remarkable increases in the yield of liquefied gas are achieved. However, this kind of methods is used to mainly increase the yield of liquefied gas by -sans of modifying the catalysts, while the increase in the yield of diesel oil is less.<br>
The above-mentioned pa^enned processes can only increase the yield of liquefied gas, but cannot increase the yield of diesel simultaneously, or if any, the yield of diesel oil is insignificant. Moreover, some ox tihe above-mentioned patented processes require special catalysts or reaction units, or the existing units should be largely refitted to meet their specific requirements.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a catalytic cracking process for increasing the yields of diesel oil and liquefied gas simultaneously on the basis of the prior art.<br>

Particularly, the present invention relates to a process for catalytic cracking hydrocarbon stocks re give simultaneously higher yields of diesel oil and liquefied gas, carrying out in a riser or fluidized-bed reactor, wherein said reactor comprises a gasoline cracking zone, a heavy oil cracking zone, a light oil cracking zone and a optional termination reaction zone, wherein said process comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)	Gasoline stock and an optional pre-lifting nedium are charged into the gasoline cracking zone of the reactor, contact a catalytic cracking catalyst to produce an oil-gas mixture, and then the resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted catalyst rise up and enter the hea""/y oil cracking zone;<br>

(d)	A reaction terminating medium is optionally charged<br><br>
into the reactor through the bottom of the termination<br>
reaction zone to terminate the reaction, from where<br>
the resultant oil-gas mixture and catalyst flow<br>
forward to a disengaging section to separate; and<br>
(e)  The reaction products are separated out in the<br>
fractionation system to obtain the desired liquefied<br>
gas, gasoline and diesel oil products, and the spent<br>
caTialyst may pass through steam stripping and then<br>
enters a regenerator and undergoes coke-burning, and<br>
then is circulated back for reuse.<br>
.^_"ong them said gasoline stock used in the gasoline<br>
cracking zone is a distillate oil having a boiling range of<br>
30'-210"C selected from straight-run gasoline,  catalytic<br>
gasoline and coker gasoline, or mixtures thereof, preferably<br>
a catalytic gasoline fraction having C^*-205°C; and it can also<br>
be a narrow fraction of gasoline of a certain stage, such as<br>
that having a boiling range of 90°-140'C or 110°-210°C. Said<br>
gasoline stock may be fractions obtained from the present<br>
reacticr. -jnit per se or from other sources. Said pre-lifting<br>
medium is a dry gas or steam. The weight ratio of said<br>
pre-lifting medium to gasoline stock is in the range of 0-5:1.<br>
In the gasoline cracking zone, the reaction temperature is about 500°-700'C, preferably about 620'-680'C; the reaction pressure is from atir.ospheric pressure to 300 KPa, preferably about 100-250 KPa; the residence time is about 0.1-3.0 sec, preferably about G.2-1.5 sec; the weight ratio cf catalyst to gasoline stock is about 10-150, preferably about 20-80; the weight ratio of gasoline stock to conventional catalytic cracking feed is about 0.02-0.50:1, preferably about 0.1-0.3:1; and the regenerated catalyst has a temperature of about 600'-750°C, preferably about 660°-710°C.<br>
Said gasoline stock may be introduced from the bottom of the gasoline cracking zone or through spray nozzles arranged around the gasoline cracking zone, wherein the gasoline stock is cracked to form a liquefied gas and at the same time the sulfur and olefin contents in the gasoline are reduced while the gasoline octane number is raised. When hot catalyst comes into contact with the gasoline stock, its temperature reduces and simultaneously a trace of coke deposits on the catalyst, hence diminishing the activity of the catalyst and passivating the metals supported thereon, which is advantageous for increasing the yield of diesel oil. When the catalyst in this<br><br>
state contacts the conventional catalytic cracking feeds in the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone, more diesel oil is produced. The resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted catalyst from the gasoline-cracking zone enter the heavy oil-cracking zone directly.<br>
The conventional catalytic cracking feeds used in the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone are selected at least one from straight-run gas oils, coker gas oils, deasphaited oils, hydrofined oils, hydrocracking tail oils, vacuum residues and atmospheric residues , or mixtures thereof. Said conventional catalytic cracking feed used in steps (b) and (C) iTiay the same or different. A portion of about 20-95wt% of said conventional catalytic cracking feed solely, or mixed vith slurry and/or heavy cycle oil, is charged into the hea-i/y oil cracking zone; and a portion of about 5-80'wt% of said conventional catalytic cracking feed solely, or mixed with slurry and/or heavy cycle oil, is charged into the light cil crackir.g zone.<br>
The function of heavy oil cracking zone is to control the cracking reaction of gasoline stock, to enhance the level of heavy oil cracking severity and to ensure the conversion of heavy oil fractions so as to increase the yisld of dissel oil from the feedstock in the heavy oil cracking zone and improve the feedstock's selectivity to diesel oil in the light oil cracking zone. In the heavy oil cracking zone, the weight ratio of catalyst to feedstock is about 5-20, preferably about 7-15; the oil-gas mixture residence time is about 0.1-2 sec, preferably about 0.3-1.0 sec; and the reaction pressure is from atmospheric pressure to 300 KPa, preferably about 100-230 KPa. The portion of feedstock to be processed in the heavy oil cracking zone is relatively heavier and more difficult to be cracked.<br>
The function of light oil cracking zone is to carry out cracking of the conventional catalytic cracking feed in this zone under an environment formed through the controlling processes of the gasoline cracking zone and heavy oil cracking zone, which is beneficial for improving the feedstocks' selectivity to diesel oil in the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone. In the light oil cracking zone, the weight ratio of catalyst to feedstock is about 3-15, preferably about 5-10; the oil-gas mixture residence time is about 0,1-6<br><br>
sec. , preferably about 0.3-3 sec.; and the reaction pressure is from atmospheric pressure to 300 KPa, preferably about 100-230 KPa. The portion of feedstock to be processed in the light oil cracking zone is relatively lighter and easier to be cracked.<br>
The recracking of heavy cycle oil and slurry is to convert unreacted fractions of them irito valuable light oil products-<br>
A termination reaction zone can be arranged after the light oil cracking zone. The function of the termination reaction zone is to diminish secondary cracking of light oils from the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone, to increase the yield of diesel oil and to control the degree of conversion of the catalytic stocks as a whole. Said reaction terminating medium is selected at least one from waste water, softened water, recycle oils, heavy oil fractions, coker gas oils, deasphalted oils, straight-run gas oils and hydrocracking tail oils, cr -i^xt^xires thereof. Depending on the type of reaction terminating medium used and the operation parameters in the heavy oil cracking zone and light oil cracking zone, particularly that of the light oil cracking zone, the weight ratio of reaction terminating medium to conventional catalytic cracking feed is about 0-30wt%. Controlled by the quantity of terminating medium injected, the temperature in the reaction termination zone is in the range of about 470°-550"C, and the material residence time is about 0 .2-3.0 sec.<br>
The catalyst applicable in the process according to the present invention can be one comprising at least one active component selected from Y-type or HY-type zeolites with or without rare earth, ultra-stable Y-type zeolites with or without rare earth, zeolites of ZSM-5 series, or high-silica<br>
zeolites having pentatomic ring structure and P -zeolites, or<br>
mixtures thereof, and can also be an amorphous silica-alumina catalyst. In short, all the catalytic cracking catalysts can be applied in the process according to the present invention.<br>
Said riser or fluidized bed reactor comprising a gasoline cracking zone, a heavy oil cracking zone, a light oil cracking zone and a termination reaction zone has a total height of 10-50 m, wherein the heights of the zones account for 2-20%,<br><br>
2-40%, 2-60% and 0-40% respectively; more accurately, the height of each of the four zones is determined in accordance with the specific operating parameters required in each reaction zone,<br>
The process according to the present invention can be carried out in conventional catalytic cracking reactors. However, since the gasoline cracking zone in certain existing catalytic cracking units is to long, it has to be refitted, for example, the feed inlet in the gasoline cracking zone has CO be rearranged at a higher Iccacion. The present process can also be carried out in reactors with a gasoline cracking zone of different structures.<br>
The process of the present invsniiion is further illustrated with reference to the attached drawing (exemplified with riser reactor).<br>
The flow scheme shows the ca^calycic cracking process for higher yields of both diesel oil and liquefied gas, but the shape and dimensions of the riser reactor are not restricted to what is shown in the schematic diagram, whereas they are determined by the specific conditions of operation.<br>
The flow scheme of the process according to the present invention is as follows:<br>
A gasoline stock and a pre-lifr^ing medium from pipelines 1 and 2 respectively are charged in a preset ratio into the riser reactor 3 through a location at a height of 0-80% of the gasoline cracking zone I contact a catalyst, which is a fresh one or a regenerated one, and then the resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted catalyst rise up and enter the heavy oil cracking zone II; a portion of conventional catalytic cracking feed solely from pipeline 13, or mixed with a recycling slurry from pipeline 16 and/or heavy cycle oil from pipeline 17, is charged into the reactor via pipeline 13 through the bottom of the heavy oil cracking zone II contacts the reactant oil-gas mixture and catalyst rising from the gasoline cracking zone, and then the resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted catalyst rise up and enter the light oil cracking zone III; another portion of conventional catalytic cracking feed solely from pipeline 14, or mixed with a recycling slurry from pipelines 16 and 18 and /or heavy cycle oil from pipelines 17 and 19, is charged into the reactor via pipeline 14 through the bottom<br><br>
of the light oil cracking zone contacts the reactant oil-gas mixture and catalyst rising from the heavy oil cracking zone, and then the resultant oil-gas mixture and reacted catalyst rise up and enter the termination reaction zone IV; optionally, a reaction terminating medium from pipeline 15 IS charged into the reactor through the bottom of the termination reaction zone IV, from which the reactant cil-gas mixture and spent catalyst flow into the disengaging section 4 with or without a dense fluidized bed reactor, and then the oil-gas mixture and steam via pipeline 11 enter the fractionation system 12 and are separated into dry gas, liquefied gas , gasoline, diesel oil, heavy cycle oil and slurry, and then the slurry can be circulated back to the hea-.-y oil cracking zone via pipelines 16 and 13 in sequence, or to the light oil cracking zone via pipelines 16, 18 and 14 in sequence; and the heavy cycle oil can be circulated back to the heavy oil cracking zone via pipelines 17 and 13 in sequence, or to the light oil cracking zone via pipelines 17, 19 and 14 in sequence. The spent catalyst enters the steam stripper 5 for steam stripping, and then enters the regenerator 7 via the slant pipe 6 to undergo coke-burning and regeneration in the presence of air; the air is introduced into the regenerator 7 via pipeline 9, and flue gas is discharged therefrom via pipeline 10, and the hot regenerated catalyst is circulated back to the bottom of the gasoline cracking zone of the riser reactor for reuse.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are embodied in the following points;<br>
1.	The process of the present invention can be carried out in an existing conventional catalytic cracking unit, which need not to be revamped in large scale, and it does not require special catalyst either, while the yields of liquefied gas and diesel oil can be increased by a big margin;<br>
2.	In the gasoline cracking zone, when the gasoline stock and hot catalyst comes into contact, a trace of coke deposited on the catalyst will cause passivation of the metals supported on the catalyst, hence reducing the adverse effects of the metals on product distribution. Since a large portion of strong acid sites on the zeolite and the matrix are covered by the trace of coke, this is beneficial for inhibiting coke-forming tendency during cracking of conventional catalytic cracking<br><br>
feed as well as for improving the selectivity to diesel oil;<br>
3.	In respect of the portion of relatively light fractions m the feedstock which can be easily cracked, the measures of operating at lower temperature with less rigorous reaction severity, shorter contact cracking and preventing secondary cracking can effectively improve the selectivity to diesel oil ;<br>
4.	As sulfur contained in the gasoline stock is mainly distributed in the heavy components, the reaction in the gasoline cracking zone of the riser reactor occurs zo crack selectively ^he heai'v components therein, thus the sulfur conteni: can be reduced remarkably;<br>
5.
