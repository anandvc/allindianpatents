A CATALYTIC COMBUSTION GAS TURBINE SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a catalytic combustion gas turbine system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A catalytic combustion gas turbine system has been developed to replace conventional industrial gas turbines, burning natural gas, but with ultra low NOx emissions. One of the features of this turbine is that cooling is required at the inlet of the turbine because of the high inlet temperature ( &gt; 850°C), arising from combustion of high concentrations of methane. This cooling is achieved by bypassing a substantial amount of the air from the compressor discharge to the turbine inlet and turbine first stage. However, if the air contains methane, this results in a large amount of uncombusted methane passing through the turbine and into the atmosphere. Not only is this an inefficient use of the methane, but it is also damaging to the environment and a waste of energy.<br>
Another application of catalytic combustion turbine systems has been to generate electricity from waste gases, which have a lower concentration of methane than natural gas. However, previous attempts of this have run into several difficulties ; having to inject support fuel (eg. natural gas) into the catalytic combustor to maintain efficient combustion, not being able to efficiently handle gas streams with less than 2 mole% methane, having to excessively raise the pressure of the gas stream thereby reducing the overall electrical output of the system, and having difficulty in controlling the gas temperature at the outlet of the combustor at a constant value below 800°C so that cooling at the inlet of the turbine is not required, and having problems in handling the waste gas, which by its nature has a fluctuating composition.<br>

Preferred embodiments of  the invention will now be described,  by way of  example only,  with reference  to the  accompanying drawings   in which:<br>
Figure 1 is  a block diagram of  a catalytic combustion gas turbine system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to Figure 1,   a preferred<br>
embodiment of a catalytic  combustion gas turbine system comprises a compressor  10,   a recuperator 11,   a pre-burner 12,  a catalytic combustor 13,  a turbine 14,   a generator 15,   a mixer 16,  and first  and second scrubbers  17,   18 thereby forming a power generation system which can be powered with approximately 1 mole% methane   (maximum 1.5 mole%,   minimum 0.5 mole%) .<br>
The system is predominantly powered by the methane in the ventilation  air from a coal mine  21.      The ventilation air is scrubbed  in the first  scrubber  17,   to remove dust particles greater than and equal  to  0.50 micron in diameter.     The  first scrubber 17  also removes hydrogen sulphide and  sulphur dioxide so that  the concentration of these compounds does not  exceed the<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
wnwiiwwn allowable concentration in the system, which is lOppm for hydrogen sulphide and 5ppm for sulphur dioxide. Exceedance of the maximum ailowable concontrations can lead to xouling of the system components and deactivation of the catalyst in the catalytic combusustor.<br>
Saving been scrubbed in the first scrubber 17, the ventilation air then eaters the mixer 16 through a first inlet 22.  Because the concentration of methane in the ventilation air 21 can vary between 0 and 1.5 mole%, it is necessary to mix it with another gas so as to provide a gas with nearly constant methane concentration over time to the compressor 10.  This is achieved using coal mine drainage gas 20, which is also subjected to a similar scrubbing operation in the second scrubber. 18. The second scrubber 18, removes dust particles and hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide to the same levels as the first scrubber 17, before the drainage gas.20 enters the mixer 16 through a second inlet 23.  The drainage gas has a methane concentration o£ over 20 mole%. The mixer 16 operates at approximately 20°C and atmospheric pressure.  The amount of drainage gas 20 that is mixed with the ventilation air 21 is controlled so that at the mixer's outlet 24, the concentration of methane in the gas is generally constant over time.<br>
The system further comprises a reservoir (not shown) which is connected to the outlet of the mixer 24. The reservoir stores a large amount of the mixed gas at approximately 20°C and atmospheric pressure.  The purpose of the reservoir is to buffer the downstream components of the system from possible fluctuations in the concentration of methane in the gas from the outlet 24 o£ the mixer 16.<br>
The gas flows from the outlet of the reservoir to the inlet 25 of the compressor 10.  The compressor 10 has a compressor ratio of approximately. 2.  This means that the pressure of the gas at the outlet 26 of the compressor 10, will be approximately 2 bar.  For efficient operation of the system, the pressure at the outlet 26 of the<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
compressor 10 should be no greater than 3.5 bar.  The compressor 10 can be either an anal flow compressor or a radial flow compressor-  The temperature of the gas at the outlet 26 of the compressor 10 will be 100 to 200°C.<br>
From the outlet 26 of the compressor 10, the gas flows to the primary inlet 27 ox the recuperator 11. The recuperator heats the gas so that at the primary outlet 28 of the recuperator 11, the temperature of the gas is between 475 and 535°C.  The recuperator 11 operates with a very low pressure drop across the primary inlet 27 and the primary outlet 28, so that the pressure of the primary outlet 28 is very similar to the pressure of the primary inlet 27. Whilst any heating means can be used to heat the gas in the recuperator 11, for efficient energy usage, the present invention utilises the tfas exiting the turbine 14 through outlet 35.  This gas enters the recuperator 11 through a secondary inlet 36, where it transfers energy to the gas entering through the primary inlet 27, before exiting the recuperator 11 through the secondary outlet 37.  This transfer of energy is achieved without any direct physical contact between, the two gases, using either a plate heat exchanger or a fin-tube heat exchanger .<br>
the gas exiting the recuperator 11 through primary outlet 28, then flows into the pre-burner 12 through an inlet 29.  During normal continuous operation of the system, the gas flows through the pro-burner 12 without any change in its composition, temperature, pressure or other properties, such that the gas exits the pre-buxner 12 through outlet 31 unchanged from the^g.aa. that entered through inlet 29. The pre-burner 12 is only operated during the start-up of the system and during low load operation)  Daring these instances, start-up fuel such as LPG Is injected into the pre-burner through the start-up fuel inlet 30*  The pre-burner 12 is then operated to facilitate partial combustion of both the start-up fuel and the gas entering through inlet 29,<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
before complete combustion occurs in the catalytic combustor 13.<br>
The gas exiting the pre-buraer 12 through outlet 31 flows Into the catalytic combustor 13 through an inlet 32.  The catalytic combustor 13 is a honeycomb-type monolith reactor.  Monoliths have a large open, frontal area resulting in a low pressure drop, which is necessary for the required moderate space velocities of the system. Nobel metal catalysts are used in the catalytic combustor 13.  The ceramic monolith acts as a substrate for a wash coat slurry of base metals, such as alumina and ceria, on which the nobel metal catalyst such as palladium, platinum or rhodium are placed. The maximum continuous bed service temperature can be 950°C, but for short periods can reach up to 1050°C.  The catalytic combUEtor 13 has a combustion efficiency of over 99%.  The gas exiting the combustor 13 through outlet 33 has a temperature of equal to or less than 800°C and a pressure which is similar to that of the gas entering the catalytic combustor through inlet 32. The similar pressure of the gas at the outlet 33 to the inlet 32 is a result of the low pressure drop across the catalytic combustor 13.<br>
The gas from the outlet 33 of the catalytic combustor 13 enters the turbine 14 through an inlet 34. The temperature of the gas at the inlet 34 should be no greater than 800°C, and is generally controlled to be approximately 780°C.  if the temperature o£ the gas becomes elevated above 800°C, then cooling of the inlet scroll and the first stage of the turbine using gas from outlet 2,6 of the compressor 10 would be required. However, it is a feature o£ the preferred embodiments of the present invention that such cooling is not required. Cooling oil is supplied to cool the shaft and bearings.<br>
The gas is expanded in the turbine 14 to produce shaft work, resulting in the gas exiting the turbine 14 through outlet 35 having a temperature of approximately 630°C and a pressure of slightly above atmospheric.  Some<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
of the shaft work of the turbine 14 is used to drive the compressor 10 through the connection 39.  The remaining shaft work is converted into electrical energy by the generator 15 which is connected by 38 to the turbine 14. Alternatively, the turbine 14 may comprise two turbines which operate on a split shaft cycle.  The first turbine is used to drive the compressor 10 and the second turbine is connected to the generator 15.  The turbine (s) 14 can<br>
be either an axial flow turbine (a) or a radial flow<br><br>
turbine(s).<br>
The system also includes a waste heat boiler (not shown).  The gas exiting the secondary outlet 37 of the recuperator 11 enters the waste heat boiler, where it is processed to recover as much of the remaining energy in the gas as possible.<br><br>
