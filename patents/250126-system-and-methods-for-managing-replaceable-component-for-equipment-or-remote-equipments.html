				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The present invention relates to system and methods for managing replaceable<br>
components for equipment by monitoring and managing the lifecycle of the equipment<br>
or the remote equipment. More specifically, the present invention relates to apparatus<br>
and methods for predicting preventive maintenance periods and component<br>
replacement needs.<br>
[002] Machinery requires periodic diagnostic maintenance to detect machine part<br>
wear, predict failure, and locate problems. In modern machinery, such as marine<br>
machines, cranes, automatic transmissions, turboshaft engines, paper mills, rolling<br>
mills, aircraft engines, helicopter transmissions, and high-speed process machinery,<br>
failure of bearings, gears and other equipment frequently result in costly productivity<br>
loss, severe and expensive secondary damage, and potentially life threatening<br>
situations. Equipment failures occur because, over time, gear/bearing assemblies and<br>
other parts that are stressed experience wear and damage, such as spalled bearing<br>
rolling elements, pitting on gear teeth, and bearing race damage.<br>
[003] To ensure safety and avoid unscheduled interruptions, critical components are<br>
typically replaced at conservative fixed intervals based simply on periods of use.<br>
However, wear factors such as load magnitude, displacement distances, time periods<br>
under load, and speeds of displacement may heavily influence equipment wear and<br>
damage. Consequently, when the wear factors are above normal for a significant period<br>
of time, the equipment can prematurely fail. On the other hand, when the wear factors<br>
are minimal for a significant period of time, simply relying on periods of use to trigger<br>
component replacement can increase the costs of operation. This is because useful<br>
component life is wasted, costs are increased due to more frequent maintenance, and<br>
productivity is decreased due to more frequent maintenance shutdowns.<br>
[004]	There is a need in the art for a system that will more accurately predict<br>
preventive maintenance periods and define component replacement needs. Also,there is<br>
a need in the art for a method that will more accurately predict preventive maintenance<br>
periods and component replacement needs.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[005]	The present invention, in one embodiment,  is a system for managing<br>
replaceable components for equipment having a plurality of components, each with a limited<br>
useful life. The system comprises: a computer with at least one processor; a computer<br>
program module for defining a duty profile comprising a plurality of usage cases for the<br>
equipment, each usage case involving two or more of the plurality of components and<br>
specified operating conditions assumed to be experienced by the involved components during<br>
the execution of each of the usage cases; and a computer program module for determining a<br>
theoretical useful life for each component involved in a duty profile, said theoretical useful<br>
life being based on component wear/stress/strain parameters assumed to occur under the<br>
specified operating conditions. The systems further comprises sensors for determining and<br>
monitoring the occurrence of equipment operation corresponding to a usage case and making<br>
measurements of actual operating conditions experienced in the operation; a memory for<br>
storing the measurements of actual operating conditions for the plurality of components; and<br>
a computer program module for computing an adjusted theoretical useful life for a<br>
component after it has experienced one or more operations, by: responsive to the<br>
measurements of actual operating conditions, calculating one or more calculated<br>
wear/stress/strain parameters for each operation and accumulating these calculated<br>
parameters for such component; and, based on a comparison of the accumulated, calculated<br>
wear/stress/strain parameters from actual operating conditions to accumulated<br>
wear/stress/strain parameters assumed to occur under the specified operating conditions in the<br>
determination of a theoretical useful life, determining the amount of the adjusted theoretical<br>
useful life consumed in the one or more operations.<br>
[006]	The present invention, in another embodiment, is a method for managing<br>
maintenance of remote equipment with replaceable components. The method comprises:<br>
providing on said remote equipment a plurality of sensors that sense operating conditions for<br>
each of one or more replaceable components; receiving at a database operating condition data<br>
sensed by said plurality of sensors; comparing at least a portion of the sensed data to one or<br>
more design duty profile parameters for the remote equipment; and in response to the step of<br>
comparing, identifying one or more replaceable components that are recommended for<br>
replacement, with a suggested future date for replacement.<br>
[007]	The present invention, in another embodiment, is a computer program stored<br>
on computer readable media for use in a system for managing replacement components for<br><br>
equipment having a plurality of components each with a limited useful life.   The program<br>
includes software components as described above for the system embodying the invention.<br>
[008]	Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides an automated web-<br>
based service designed to let clients interface online or offline with any drilling equipment<br>
coupled to the system. On-site operators or personnel remote from the site, e.g., the f<br>
headquarter of the company; can utilize information and knowledge stored among huge<br>
amounts of data. A part of the concept is to acquire and redirect existing equipment<br>
instrumentation signals into a centralized database. By also applying corporate knowledge<br>
about the equipment, like theoretical models, diagnostic algorithms, statistics, work load-<br>
accumulation, etc, a service provider can provide value added data back to the company<br>
operating the equipment. The system may deliver last hour statistics from one specific<br>
machine, or advanced diagnostic algorithms applied across equipment operated by different<br>
companies. The system may help pinpointing potential areas for improved performance as ;<br>
well as assisting in predicting and planning on-demand maintenance.<br>
[009]	There are two main approaches to equipment condition analysis. One is based<br>
on advanced engineering and mathematical modeling, which provide a reference for<br>
comparing measured operational data with theoretical data. The second, more common<br>
approach is that there is no known reliable model or theoretical knowledge for operation and<br>
wear on the equipment. In that case, empirical analysis of trends and patterns in large<br>
amounts of collected data, from a large number of equipment units, may over time provide<br>
better and better interpretation of equipment conditions.<br>
[010]	Whatever method is used, better condition models will enable calculation of<br>
weighted equipment use, i.e., use measured not just by time or repetitions of the operations<br>
but based on load or other conditions that effect equipment life. Obviously, there is a huge<br>
difference between 1000 running hours with heavy load and 1000 running hours without load<br>
at all. Some parts wear faster with certain operating conditions, e.g. higher speeds, others<br>
with different conditions, e.g., higher load. It is possible to define a "wear-map" for each<br>
component of any machine. By combining this wear-map with operational data, a figure for<br>
remaining lifetime can be estimated for wear parts. This will form the basis for a Reliability<br>
Centered Maintenance (RCM) approach, where from current condition and remaining<br>
lifetime data, one can dynamically estimate service and inspection intervals and spare part<br>
requirements. This provides for longer service and inspection intervals with little or no<br>
increase in chances of failure. Reliability and safety can also be improved.<br><br>
[011]	A typical system according to a further embodiment of the invention may<br>
comprise the following main elements:<br>
•	Instrumentation (including sensors)<br>
o   This may be existing instrumentation on the equipment and/or new<br>
instrumentation<br>
•	On-site computer - A physical data acquisition unit located on or near the<br>
monitored equipment and coupled to the instrumentation,<br>
•	Server receiving data from a plurality of on-site computers and with capability<br>
to upgrade software in the on-site computer<br>
•	Communication network, e.g., the Internet<br>
[012]	The RCM service may be in two modes: (1) Local monitoring - made on-site<br>
or within an existing company network; or (2) Performance monitoring - provided by one or<br>
a group of servers operated by a service provider. The local monitoring mode is intended for<br>
provision of raw data and simple statistics. The performance monitoring mode provides<br>
higher-level information, more deeply analyzed data, where the service provider's<br>
accumulated knowledge and machine competence has been applied to the raw data.<br>
[013]	The system is designed to provide a single point of configuration for the<br>
service and for the equipment involved.   In a dedicated web service, service administrators<br>
can configure, all the elements of the service. The configuration process involves:<br>
selecting equipment to monitor<br>
selecting on-site computer type for data acquisition<br>
selecting and configuring signals and parameters for the data logger<br>
selecting and configuring calculations, filters and logging frequency for the data<br>
logger<br>
selecting and configuring communication routes<br>
-	selecting accumulated knowledge to be applied at the central server<br>
-	defining and setting up company, plant and user accounts<br>
[014]	Based on the input, the management database in the central server may<br>
produce:<br>
-	an XML configuration file to automatically set up all aspects of the data logger<br>
an XML configuration file to automatically set up the local monitoring<br>
-	an XML configuration file to automatically set up the local monitor content<br>
-	automatic configuration and set up of database tables in the performance monitor<br><br>
-	automatic configuration of the data receiver in the server - a logstream handler<br>
[015]	For each type of equipment or component there may be defined a empirical<br>
service model. This may be expressed in: algorithms; constants; performance limits,<br>
including 2D performance limits; and error codes. To facilitate incorporating empirical<br>
learning, the service provider regularly explores data collected and correlates it with known<br>
incidents, events, inspections and replacements. Various data-mining techniques can be used.<br>
[016]	Also to facilitate empirical learning, the product manager will be authorized to<br>
explore and able to gather all equipments for all clients with the same view and with the same<br>
analysis tools. The manager can:<br>
-	view parameters over time<br>
view parameters versus load<br>
view parameters versus any other categorized parameter<br>
-	build statistics from data on<br>
o   Alarms<br>
o   Operation<br>
o    Maintenance<br>
o   Any other monitored and accumulated data<br>
explore details surrounding accidents, events or incidents (e.g., broken parts)<br>
Based on this, he can develop new algorithms and performance limits to implement in the<br>
data analysis processor for the equipment type.<br>
[017]	While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the<br>
present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed<br>
description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. As will be<br>
realized, the invention is capable of modifications in various obvious aspects, all without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and<br>
detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A. Equipment Design And Component Useful Life<br>
[049]	When sophisticated equipment is designed, it is frequently defined with a<br>
planned useful life for the overall item of equipment.  In reality, the design must take into<br>
consideration the useful life of a variety of components. For components that are critical to<br>
useful life, there is usually useful life data available from a manufacturer or other source that<br>
has actual test data on useful life and/or theoretical projections that are derived from actual<br>
useful life data.   Typically, the useful life is specified for one or more defined, assumed<br>
operating conditions.   An operating condition may be specified in terms of a rate, such as<br>
speed or load, and a time duration for experiencing that speed or load and/or a distance for<br><br>
maintaining the rate of work, but may also include other operating conditions, such as<br>
environmental factors that may affect useful life, e.g., operating temperature, humidity,<br>
corrosives or particulates present. The theoretical useful life for a component under the<br>
assumed operating conditions may then be expressed in terms of hours, days or other<br>
extended time interval. Typically a graph or set of graphs showing the effect of load, speed<br>
or other operating conditions on useful life will be available (or may be developed from<br>
existing data and theoretical or empirically derived formulas) as a design guide. In some<br>
instances, testing may need to be performed to establish accurate useful life data for a<br>
component. Whatever the source, equipment designers typically have reliable data that<br>
shows the relationship between a range of operating conditions and duration or repetitions of<br>
these conditions and the useful life of a component that that may be selected in the original<br>
design.<br>
[050]	The useful life problem is not particularly difficult when a single component<br>
operating in one or a small number of modes is all that is under consideration. But in<br>
complex systems that carry out different operations, the useful life is more difficult to<br>
determine. One technique known by equipment designers is to define a duty profile. A duty<br>
profile defines certain operations that the equipment will perform and determines which are<br>
the key components that are involved in each operation and how they will be used in that<br>
operation. A duty profile may be described for an expected (or design goal) overall useful<br>
life of a piece of equipment. For example, the following might define a duty profile for a<br>
mooring system used on an offshore oil platform:<br><br>
Case No.	Operation	<br>
1	Raise 4000 ft of chain plus 10 metric tons anchor from	sea bottom<br>
2	Payout 4000 ft of chain with anchor on work boat	<br>
3	Inhaul 4000 ft of chain with anchor on work boat	<br>
4	Payout 8000 ft of wire rope with anchor on work boat	<br>
5	Inhaul 8000 ft of chain with anchor on work boat	<br>
6	Anchor setting on chain (300 ft + 100 ft)	<br>
7	Anchor setting on wire rope (500 ft + 100 ft)	<br>
8	200 ft rig excursion on chain	<br><br>
9	400 ft rig excursion on wire rope<br>
[051]	This duty cycle might be defined for an overall design life of 25 years with six<br>
rig moves per year and twelve rig excursions per year.<br>
[052]	Alternatively, the duty profile might be described in terms of what functions<br>
equipment performs and, in any given time interval, what proportion of that time interval the<br>
equipment will be performing each operation or no operation. E.g., for a crane, the following<br>
duty profile might be used:<br><br>
[053]	Returning to the first duty profile example, with such a duty profile defined<br>
the mooring system designer can then determine what key components (winches, motors,<br>
gear systems, shafts, bearings, wire rope, etc) are involved in each case and what operating<br>
conditions are required for each of the key components in each usage case. Most components<br>
will be involved in more than one case and may be operated at different operating conditions<br>
for different cases. This permits the computation of the duty profile requirements for each<br>
component for the assumed duty profile and the overall design life. The designer can then<br>
choose components with useful life characteristics that permit that component to be used for<br>
the assumed duty cycle for at least the overall design life. In some cases, the available<br>
components may not exactly fit the overall design life, and a component may be selected that<br><br>
is determined to have a useful life under the assumed duty profile that exceeds the overall<br>
design life. In other cases a component may not be available or may be cost prohibitive if it<br>
must meet the overall design life without replacement. In this case, a component useful life<br>
under the assumed duty profile (including assumed operating conditions) may be calculated<br>
and replacement of such component at intervals during the overall useful life can be planned.<br>
[054]	However, the actual operating conditions for the equipment may be more or<br>
less severe than the duty profile assumed for the original design. For the owner or operator of<br>
the equipment, this has several implications.  Maintenance on components may be required<br>
sooner or later than originally planned.  Some components that were not expected to require<br>
maintenance during the design life will require maintenance where the duty profile is more<br>
severe that the duty profile used in the original design.   It is much better to perform such<br>
maintenance on a scheduled basis than it is to have an emergency maintenance session in the<br>
midst of planned productive use of the equipment (which must now be interrupted) or to have<br>
an equipment failure.   The latter may involve injury or damage causing losses that go far<br>
beyond loss of use of the equipment.<br>
[055]	Past methods of addressing this situation include simply observing equipment<br>
operation and intervening when a near-failure or failure becomes observable. Alternatively,<br>
in some situations a sensor may be used to detect when an equipment component is near<br>
failure, e.g., because it deforms or requires greater than normal operating forces or its<br>
characteristics otherwise change.   Such methods may defer maintenance until needed, but<br>
they may also result in equipment being operated to a point of failure or near-failure, where<br>
immediate, unplanned emergency stoppage is required.<br>
B. Overview Of Present Invention<br>
[056]	The   present   invention   attempts   to   reduce   or   avoid   such   unplanned<br>
interventions and to perform on a planned basis component replacement, even in situations<br>
where the duty profile in actual use is quite far from the duty profile used in the original<br>
design of the overall useful life.<br>
[057]	FIG.  1   is a schematic block diagram indicating the elements of a data<br>
acquisition and management system in accordance with the present invention. This system is<br>
intended to manage component replacement for one or more items of equipment.   FIG. 1<br>
shows a crane 300 and a winch or mooring system 400 as examples; other types of equipment<br>
and more than two items of equipment may be managed by the system.<br>
[058]	As will become apparent from the following discussion, the system monitors<br>
and collects data from operations performed by the equipment. More specifically, the system<br><br>
monitors and collects data from the operations performed by individual components that<br>
comprise the overall equipment. The system is able to provide "real-time" access to<br>
operations of the equipment and its components. The system allows direct comparison of<br>
actual operating conditions experienced by the equipment to the original theoretical duty<br>
profiles considered by the designers of the equipment. The system can then analyze the<br>
differences between the actual and theoretical duty profiles, develop information adjusting<br>
the original component useful life projections and schedule maintenance accordingly. The<br>
system uses the analysis to ascertain the amount of component useful life exhausted as of that<br>
point in time when operating condition data is collected.<br>
[059]	As shown in FIG. 1, the system includes a communication network 10 and a<br>
computer system 40 with an output device 22 (such as a printer) and a maintenance manager<br>
terminal 30. The system further includes equipment operator/owner terminals 50, 52, two<br>
sensor data links 304 (for crane 300) and 404 (for winch system 400), each with<br>
corresponding multiple sensor inputs 302, 402 (for simplicity, only three inputs are shown for<br>
each of crane 300 and winch 400, although many more sensors could be placed on the<br>
equipment to provide inputs) that are associated with particular components and their<br>
operating parameters within crane 300 and winch 400.<br>
[060]	The  computer 40   includes  a  processor   100  with  an  operating  system,<br>
communications management devices 110, and applications software 120. The applications<br>
120 have access to a database 200 including files for operating conditions data 210, duty<br>
profiles 220, manuals/maintenance information 230, and ordering information 240, as well as<br>
other data that may be used by the system.<br>
[061]	The   communications   management   devices    110   communicate   with   a<br>
communication network 10 (which may be a public data network such as the Internet or a<br>
private network) via a communication link 12. The computer 40 is interconnected to the<br>
maintenance manager terminal 30 and the output device 20 via communication links 22 and<br>
32, respectively. The operator/owner terminals 50, 52, which may use a browser to access a<br>
web site supported on computer 40, are interconnected to the communication network 10 via<br>
communication links 24 and 26, respectively. The equipment operator/owner terminals 50,<br>
52 allow the operator/owner to access via an Internet portal the "real-time" equipment<br>
operation and maintenance history files generated by the system. The features that an<br>
operator/owner may access at the Internet portal are further described in section C of this<br>
specification.<br><br>
[062]	Sensor inputs 302 are located on the crane 300 to monitor operating conditions<br>
in key components such as the slewing bearing, container ring bearing, winches, boom, etc.<br>
For example, in the context of the crane 300, the sensor inputs 302 might include: a swing<br>
angle sensor for measuring radial boom displacement; a boom angle sensor (i.e., an<br>
inclinometer) to measure boom incline displacements and boom angles; and a load sensor for<br>
measuring the strain in the backleg structure (knowing the crane geometry, the system<br>
converts the reading from the load sensor into an equivalent loading of the roller circle or<br>
slewing bearing). Similarly, sensor inputs 402 are located on the winch 400 to monitor<br>
operating conditions in key components such as the drum, drum bearings, levelwind, etc.<br>
[063]	The sensor inputs 302, 402 communicate operating condition data to their<br>
respective sensor data links 304, 404. The sensor data links 304, 404 forward the operating<br>
condition data to the to the computer 40 via the communications management devices 110 in<br>
the computer 40 via the communication network 10. In one embodiment, the sensor data<br>
links 304, 404 use existing PLC's on the equipment and supplemental programming on the<br>
PLC's to gather data from the sensor inputs 302, 402. This data is formatted using XML or a<br>
similar standard then transmitted to or shared with a PC or other processor programmed and<br>
configured to use TCP/IP or other data transmission protocols to transmit data via the<br>
communication network 10 to computer 40. Thus, the equipment 300, 400 may be located<br>
remote from, even great distances away from, the computer 40. The applications 120 receive<br>
and store the incoming operating condition data in the operating conditions data files 210 in<br>
the database 200. The operating conditions data is then available for analysis, including<br>
further processing so that it may be compared to and utilized in the component wear models<br>
defined by the duty profiles 220, as explained in the following discussion directed to FIG. 2.<br>
[064]	FIG. 2 is a logic diagram illustrating the processes 1200 executed by the<br>
applications 120 with respect to the operating condition data and the duty profiles. Before the<br>
process can be executed, the relevant duty profiles 220 from the original design and any<br>
supporting data used to analyze component useful life under various operating conditions<br>
must be loaded. This data is coordinated with and used by the applications 120. As shown in<br>
FIG. 2, the process 1200 begins with a start/wait state 1202. When the process 1200 is<br>
initiated, it inquires whether new operating condition data is present 1204 (i.e., whether new<br>
operating condition data has been received from the sensor inputs 302, 402). If the new<br>
operating condition data is not present, then the process 1200 determines whether a sensor<br>
status check is needed 1206. This check is performed to determine whether or not the failure<br>
to receive new operating condition data is the result of a malfunctioning sensor.  If a sensor<br><br>
status check is needed, then the process 1200 performs the sensor status check, and reports the<br>
result 1208. The process then returns to the start/wait mode 1202.<br>
[065]	If the process 1200 determines that there is new operating condition data<br>
present 1204, then the new operating condition data is received and stored 1210 in the<br>
system's database 200. The process 1200 then determines whether a real-time analysis<br>
request is present for the equipment 1212. If not, then the process 1200 determines whether a<br>
scheduled, periodic analysis is due 1214. If no periodic analysis is due, then the process 1200<br>
returns to the start/wait mode 1202. If the periodic analysis is due (for example, the end of a<br>
defined monitoring period for a particular piece of equipment, such as a day, week, month<br>
etc., is present), then the process 1200 accesses the operating condition data for the particular<br>
item of equipment and prepares the operating data for comparison and analysis 1216.<br>
[066]	If the process 1200 determines that a real-time analysis request is present for<br>
the equipment 1212, then the process 1200 proceeds directly to access the operating condition<br>
data for the equipment and prepares operating data for comparison and analysis 1216. The<br>
process 1200 then accesses the duty profile for the equipment and checks for maintenance<br>
updates 1218 that may have recently occurred and that may affect a duty profile analysis.<br>
The process 1200 then performs comparison and analysis of the operating condition data<br>
against the duty profile for the equipment 1220.<br>
[067]	As described in section D of this specification, the duty profile is part of the<br>
initial design process and is used to select the original components and to develop a<br>
theoretical useful life for each key component under assumed operating usage cases and<br>
operating conditions. The duty profile and its assumed operating conditions, and the<br>
component useful life data that were assumptions in the original design, are revisited during<br>
comparison and analysis step 1220 to make adjustments to component useful life predictions<br>
and any corresponding maintenance plans, after some actual operating condition data has<br>
been gathered.<br>
[068]	The process 1200 then determines whether critical useful life results are<br>
present for any component 1222 (i.e., whether any component has reached, or will soon reach<br>
(is within a critical range of), the end of its useful life and require maintenance or<br>
replacement immediately). If not, the process 1200 prepares useful life results and schedules<br>
planned service 1224. This includes preparing electronic and/or paper reports on operating<br>
conditions, useful life and recommended long and short term maintenance plans by<br>
component. A scheduled replacement need may be signaled when the amount of the<br>
theoretical useful life consumed is within a replacement range of the adjusted theoretical<br><br>
useful life. The process 1200 then determines whether auto order of any components is<br>
specified 1226. If auto order is not specified, the process 1200 sends a planned service and<br>
request for order notice 1228 to the equipment owner/operator and any parties involved in<br>
maintenance service. This prompts relevant personnel to place necessary component orders.<br>
If the auto order is specified, the process 1200 arranges for components to be obtained and<br>
shipped and for maintenance to be performed per a system-generated schedule 1230.<br>
[069]	If the process 1200 determines that critical useful life results are present for a<br>
component 1222, then the process 1200 issues a report on an expedited basis (e.g., e-mail to<br>
terminals 50, 52; fax; messages back to sensor data links 304, 404) and schedules emergency<br>
service 1232 by contacts with maintenance service personnel and the equipment<br>
owner/operator. The process 1200 then arranges for components to be obtained and shipped<br>
and for maintenance to be performed per a system-generated schedule 1230. The process<br>
1200 then updates the maintenance log records based on the report of completed maintenance<br>
1234. The process 1200 then returns to the start/wait mode 1202.<br>
[070]	FIG. 3 illustrates a process 1300 for entering maintenance information into the<br>
system. Maintenance can affect useful life computations when a replacement component is<br>
inserted into the analysis. This is because a new component has no past operating conditions<br>
as part of its history. Also, a new component may or may not have a different theoretical<br>
useful life under the assumed operating conditions.<br>
[071]	The   process   1300  initializes the  maintenance   log  based  on  equipment<br>
configuration 1302. The process 1300 then awaits periodic or special maintenance reports for<br>
equipment   1304,  e.g.,  input from terminals  50,  52  if maintenance  is  logged by the<br>
owner/operator or from terminal 30 if logged by operators of the system of FIG. 1.<br>
[072]	The process 1300 next determines whether new maintenance log data is<br>
present 1306. If not, then the process 1300 continues to await maintenance reports for the<br>
equipment 1304. If new maintenance log data is present, then the process 1300 stores the<br>
maintenance log data with the referenced components in a particular equipment configuration<br>
for which maintenance has been performed 1308.<br>
[073]	The process  1300 then determines if maintenance log data affects any<br>
component useful life data 1310. If no, then the process again awaits maintenance reports for<br>
the equipment 1304. If the maintenance log data does affect any component useful life data,<br>
then the process 1300 updates the component useful life data and any affected duty profiles to<br>
reflect the maintenance 1312, including possible changes in component useful life data files.<br>
The process 1300 then again awaits maintenance reports for the equipment 1304.<br><br>
C. Features Accessible Via The Internet Portal<br>
[074]	In one embodiment, the operator/owner, maintenance personnel, or service<br>
provider may access the system on-line via the Internet. In doing so, the person accessing the<br>
system enters an Internet portal (see FIG. 4a) that is designed in a modular format<br>
incorporating standard web-based protocol architecture. The internet portal provides access<br>
to modules pertaining to the equipment associated with the system. The modules are<br>
accessible via multiple navigation paths for any of the equipment associated with the system.<br>
In one embodiment, the modules include a maintenance module, a maintenance and parts<br>
manuals module, a data log module, a spare parts module, and an equipment location map<br>
module.<br>
[075]	In one embodiment, the operator/owner will be able to access on-line an<br>
interactive map of the world or part of the world, as illustrated in FIG. 4b. The map will<br>
show the locations of the owner/operator's equipment that are under management by the<br>
system. Clicking on the desired location or equipment provides the owner/operator, based on<br>
the selections made, access to the modules and/or data for each piece of equipment.<br>
Alternatively, a customized, dynamically-created bar menu, based on each owner/operator's<br>
equipment list, is displayed across the top. Drop down menus bring the owner/operator<br>
directly to the modules for each piece of equipment. The system can be customized to meet<br>
each owner/operator's operations utilizing standard web site architecture.<br>
[076]	The maintenance module is designed to provide easy access to maintenance<br>
records via the web portal. Each person (with Internet access) signing onto the system will<br>
have a unique password that will provide for varying levels of access. For example, an<br>
individual or individuals completing the actual maintenance of the equipment could have<br>
access only to the input data sheets for recording the inspection time and data. Their<br>
supervisor would have access to the next level reports illustrating maintenance history. Each<br>
level of access is controlled by the log-on password.<br>
[077]	Each   piece of equipment  in the  customer's  inventory  has a  scheduled<br>
maintenance interval that is loaded into the system.   The system provides for automatic<br>
notification of maintenance tasks that are due and their due date. The over-due or scheduled<br>
maintenance task screen shown in FIG. 4c illustrates the type of data that would be available<br>
for maintenance supervisor to efficiently schedule his maintenance assignments.<br>
[078]	Once the maintenance is completed, the data is loaded into the system and is<br>
accessible on-line by any person with security access to this portion of the module.   All<br><br>
maintenance records are kept up to date, allowing for "real-time" access and planning of<br>
preventive maintenance.<br>
[079]	The maintenance and parts manual module provides "real-time" access to the<br>
latest updated documents. These manuals are updated periodically on the system and sent to<br>
a owner/operator's home office for distribution to the piece of equipment. The online access<br>
to manuals, as portrayed in FIG. 4d, provides the maintenance and operators instant access to<br>
updates to service modifications and safety features for the equipment under management by<br>
the system.<br>
[080]	The data acquisition module provides access to historical information detailing<br>
the actual loading or other operating conditions for each monitored component in the piece of<br>
equipment recorded over the life of the component. This recorded data is compared with<br>
theoretical design considerations (design profiles) and these comparisons are used to predict<br>
preventive maintenance schedules for the monitored component. As illustrated in FIG. 4e,<br>
the data log module can also use operating condition data to tabulate and sum the total<br>
throughput of an individual piece of equipment providing information for planning,<br>
production schedules, and maintenance schedules.<br>
[081]	The spare parts module provides for access to parts manuals and drawings. As<br>
indicated in FIG. 4f, the bill of material is available on-line along with the appropriate<br>
drawing listing. The component part can be identified on-line and inventory status,<br>
quotations and deliveries can be provided. The component can be ordered on-line.<br>
D. Simplified Exemplary Theoretical And Actual Component Useful Life Calculations<br>
[082]	A highly simplified example of the process of calculating the theoretical and<br>
actual component useful life for individual components of equipment X (e.g., a crane, winch,<br>
loader, etc.) will now be given. While component wear is a function of multiple factors such<br>
as force, torque, displacement speed, acceleration, deceleration, temperature, corrosion,<br>
particles, surface treatment, lubrication, friction, etc., for the sake of understandability,<br>
component wear in the following example, is equated with the work (i.e., force or torque<br>
multiplied by displacement) done by the equipment.<br>
[083]	In general terms, the process of the invention initially plans maintenance for<br>
equipment X based on assumed theoretical duty profiles, which are based on assumed<br>
operating conditions. As equipment X begins its operational life, operating condition data is<br>
collected by the system.  The collected data is utilized to adjust the theoretical duty profiles<br><br>
of equipment X. The adjusted duty profiles are then used to adjust the maintenance schedule<br>
for the equipment. The adjusted duty profiles are also used to calculate the amount of<br>
equipment life exhausted up to that point in time. The adjusted duty profiles are also utilized<br>
to project the remaining expected equipment life.<br>
[084]	As can be appreciated from the following example, actual operating conditions<br>
can shorten or lengthen the actual equipment and component useful life relative to the<br>
original assumed equipment and component useful life depending on whether the actual<br>
operating conditions are more or less harsh than originally assumed. As can be appreciated<br>
from the preceding FIGS, and discussion, and as will become more clear from the following<br>
discussion, the system and process of the subject invention allows the predicted equipment<br>
life and maintenance schedule to be automatically updated based on equipment X's real-time<br>
operational data. The simplified example is as follows.<br>
[085]	FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary, but highly simplified, Assumed Duty Profile<br>
analysis broken down by component for equipment X (e.g., a crane, windlass, loader, etc.).<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, equipment X has components A, B and C.<br>
[086]	In calculating an assumed duty profile, an equipment designer first assumes an<br>
equipment design life for the equipment in question. For this example, the assumed<br>
equipment design life for equipment X is 25 years. The designer then assumes the types and<br>
numbers of operations (i.e., usage cases and their repetitions) equipment X will be subjected<br>
to during its assumed equipment design life. Each usage case is assumed to be a specific type<br>
of operation at a specific level of loading and displacement.<br>
[087]	As indicated in FIG. 5, equipment X is assumed to perform three different<br>
usage cases (Usage Cases 1, 2 and 3) over the course of its assumed equipment design life. It<br>
is assumed that equipment X will perform Nl (e.g., 100) "Usage Case 1" operations, N2<br>
(e.g., 50) "Usage Case 2" operations, and N3 (e.g., 125) "Usage Case 3" operations over the<br>
25 year assumed equipment design life for equipment X.<br>
[088]	For equipment X, Usage Case 1 causes Component A (e.g., rotating shaft) to<br>
rotate 10 radians at a torque of 100 ft.lbs., and Component B (e.g. a hydraulic ram) to<br>
displace 5 ft against a force of 10 lbs. Component C (e.g., a sheave) does not participate in<br>
Usage Case 1. Thus, each occurrence of Usage Case 1 subjects Component A to CI (1,000)<br>
ft.lbs. of work, Component B to C2 (50) ft.lbs. of work, and Component C to C3 (no) ft.lbs.<br>
of work. Usage Case 1 is assumed to occur Nl (100) times over the course of the 25 year<br>
assumed equipment design life.<br><br>
[089]	For equipment X, Usage Case 2 causes Component B to displace 10 ft against<br>
a force of 50 lbs, and Component C to rotate 20 radians at a torque of 50 ft.lbs. Component<br>
A does not participate in Usage Case 2. Thus, each occurrence of Usage Case 2 subjects<br>
Component B to C5 (500) ft.lbs. of work, Component C to C6 (1000) ft.lbs. of work, and<br>
Component A to C4 (no) ft.lbs. of work. Usage Case 2 is assumed to occur N2 (50) times<br>
over the course of the 25 year assumed equipment design life.<br>
[090]	For equipment X, Usage Case 3 causes Component A to rotate 15 radians at a<br>
torque of 200 ft.lbs., Component B to displace 10 ft against a force of 200 lbs, and<br>
Component C to rotate 30 radians at a torque of 200 ft.lbs. Thus, each occurrence of Usage<br>
Case 3 subjects Component A to C7 (3,000) ft.lbs. of work, Component B to C8 (2,000)<br>
ft.lbs. of work, and Component C to C9 (6,000) ft.lbs. of work. Usage Case 3 is assumed to<br>
occur N3 (125) times over the course of the 25 year assumed equipment design life.<br>
[091]	As shown in FIG. 5, the ft.lbs. of work per usage case for each component is<br>
multiplied by the number of occurrences of that usage case. These values are then added for<br>
each component to arrive at the component's Theoretical Component Usage Profile. For<br>
example, with respect to Component A's Theoretical Component Usage Profile (TCUPA), the<br>
formula is (Nl x CI) + (N2 x C4) + (N3 x C7) = TCUPA, which results in value of 475,000<br>
ft.lbs. of work. Thus, under the conditions of the assumed duty profile, Component A would<br>
need to be able to withstand the amount of wear/stress/strain corresponding to 475,000 ft.lbs.<br>
of work in order to have a component design profile that is equivalent to the assumed<br>
equipment design life of 25 years. Similarly, with respect to Component B's assumed<br>
Theoretical Component Usage Profile (TCUPB), the formula is (Nl x C2) + (N2 x C5) + (N3<br>
x C8) = TCUPB, which results in value of 280,000 ft.lbs. of work. Thus, under the conditions<br>
of the assumed duty profile, Component B would need to be able to withstand the amount of<br>
wear/stress/strain corresponding to 280,000 ft.lbs. of work in order to have a component<br>
design profile that is equivalent to the assumed equipment design life of 25 years. Finally,<br>
with respect to Component C's Theoretical Component Usage Profile (TCUPc), the formula<br>
is (Nl x C3) + (N2 x C6) + (N3 x C9) = TCUPC, which results in value of 800,000 ft.lbs. of<br>
work. Thus, under the conditions of the assumed duty profile, Component C would need to<br>
be able to withstand the amount of wear/stress/strain corresponding to 800,000 ft.lbs. of work<br>
in order to have a component design profile that is equivalent to the assumed equipment<br>
design life of 25 years.<br><br>
[092]	Once the Theoretical Component Usage Profiles are generated, they may be<br>
utilized in the selection of actual components. A component's Theoretical Component Usage<br>
Profile may also be utilized to initially schedule maintenance for that component.<br>
[093]	Sometimes available components will have Wear/Stress/Strain Ratings or<br>
characteristics that will correspond to the appropriate Theoretical Component Usage Profile.<br>
In those circumstances, the Theoretical Component Life Under the Duty Profile will equal the<br>
assumed equipment design life. This situation is reflected in FIG. 5 for Component A. The<br>
entire Wear/Stress/Strain Ratings (WSSR) (i.e., 475,000 ft.Ibs. of work) of the actual<br>
Component A may be utilized, if needed, over the Selected Design Life (i.e., the 25 year<br>
assumed equipment design life).<br>
[094]	Sometimes it will not be possible to find a component that has the WSSR or<br>
characteristics that correspond to the appropriate Theoretical Component Usage Profile. The<br>
actual component selected may have WSSR or characteristics that are significantly less than<br>
or greater than the appropriate Theoretical Component Usage Profile. For example, in FIG.<br>
5, the actual component selected for Component B was able to withstand the amount of<br>
wear/stress/strain corresponding to 392,000 ft.Ibs. of work. Thus, Component B's<br>
Theoretical Component Life Under the Assumed Duty Profile would be 35 years. Also, since<br>
the WSSR for Component B is 392,000 ft.Ibs., this entire capacity is available, if needed,<br>
over the Selected Design Lifetime (i.e., the 25 year assumed equipment design life).<br>
[095]	As  a converse  example,  in  FIG.  5, the  actual  component  selected  for<br>
Component C was only able to withstand the amount of wear/stress/strain corresponding to<br>
400,000 ft.Ibs. of work. Thus, Component C's Theoretical Component Life Under the<br>
Assumed Duty Profile would be 12.5 years. To meet the requirements of the Selected Design<br>
Life (i.e., 25 years), two Component C's must be utilized in succession. Thus, the effective<br>
WSSR for the two Component C's is 800,000 ft.Ibs., which is available, if needed, over the<br>
Selected Design Life.<br>
[096]	FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary, but highly simplified, Actual Duty Profile<br>
broken down by component for equipment X over an actual period of use. The actual period<br>
of use for this example will be the first 2 years equipment X is in operation.<br>
[097]	In calculating an actual duty profile, force, torque and displacement readings<br>
are obtained from sensors associated with the individual components A, B and C (see FIGS. 1<br>
and 2). As equipment X performs an operation (i.e., usage case), the corresponding force,<br>
torque and displacement readings are recorded.<br><br>
[098]	As indicated in FIG. 6, equipment X has performed Nl (10) Usage Case 1<br>
operations over the first two years of equipment X's operational life. However, the force,<br>
torque and displacement values for the actual Usage Case 1 operations have been different<br>
from those selected for the Assumed Duty Profile. For example, actual Usage Case 1<br>
operations have caused Component A (e.g., rotating shaft) to rotate 10 radians at a torque of<br>
200 ft.lbs., and Component B (e.g. a hydraulic ram) to displace 5 ft against a force of 5 lbs.<br>
Component C (e.g., a sheave) did not participate in Usage Case 1. Thus, each occurrence of<br>
Usage Case 1 subjects Component A to CI (2,000) ft.lbs. of work, Component B to C2 (25)<br>
ft.lbs. of work, and Component C to C3 (no) ft.lbs. of work.<br>
[099]	As shown in FIG. 6, equipment X has performed N2 (5) Usage Case 2<br>
operations over the first two years of equipment X's operational life. However, the force,<br>
torque and displacement values for the actual Usage Case 2 operations have been different<br>
from those selected for the Assumed Duty Profile. For example, actual Usage Case 2<br>
operations have caused Component B to displace 5 ft against a force of 25 lbs, and<br>
Component C to rotate 20 radians at a torque of 50 ft.lbs. Component A did not participate in<br>
Usage Case 2. Thus, each occurrence of Usage Case 2 subjects Component B to C5 (125)<br>
ft.lbs. of work, Component C to C6 (1000) ft.lbs. of work, and Component A to C4 (no)<br>
ft.lbs. of work.<br>
[0100]	As indicated in FIG. 6, equipment X has performed N3 (12) Usage Case 3<br>
operations over the first two years of equipment X's operational life. However, the force,<br>
torque and displacement values for the actual Usage Case 3 operations have been different<br>
from those selected for the Assumed Duty Profile. For example, actual Usage Case 3<br>
operations have caused Component A to rotate 25 radians at a torque of 400 ft.lbs.,<br>
Component B to displace 5 ft against a force of 100 lbs, and Component C to rotate 30<br>
radians at a torque of 200 ft.lbs. Thus, each occurrence of Usage Case 3 subjects Component<br>
A to CI (10,000) ft.lbs. of work, Component B to C8 (500) ft.lbs. of work, and Component C<br>
to C9 (6,000) ft.lbs. of work.<br>
[0101]	As shown in FIG. 6, the actual ft.lbs. of work per usage case for each<br>
component is multiplied by the actual number of occurrences of that usage case to date (i.e.,<br>
for this example, the actual number of occurrences of that usage case over the first two years<br>
equipment X is in operation). These values are then added for each component to arrive at<br>
the component's Actual Component Usage. For example, with respect to Component A's<br>
Actual Component Usage (ACUA), the formula is (Nl x CI) + (N2 x C4) + (N3 x C7) =<br>
ACUA, which results in value of 140,000 ft.lbs. of work.<br><br>
[0102]	As indicated in FIG. 5, the WSSR of the actual Component A utilized in<br>
equipment X was equivalent to Component A's Theoretical Component Usage Profile<br>
(475,000 ft.lbs). Dividing the Actual Component Usage (140,000) by 475,000 shows that<br>
approximately 29.5 percent of Component A's useful life has been utilized. This analysis<br>
approach is reflected in FIGS. 4e and 7.<br>
[0103]	FIG. 4e is a computer screen display that shows the lift history 500 of a piece<br>
of equipment (e.g., a crane) and the remaining percent life of a component (e.g., slew<br>
bearing) of the equipment 510. FIG. 7 is a graphical display (like that indicated by 510 in<br>
FIG. 4e) that graphically compares for each component the Actual Component Usage versus<br>
the WSSR for the actual component utilized.<br>
[0104]	As indicated in FIG. 4e, the lifting history 500 of the crane is recorded in<br>
terms of percent load capacity 505 and swing angle 515. These terms are recorded according<br>
to a time stamp 520. This information is utilized by the process of the invention to adjust in a<br>
real-time manner the usage profile for the slewing bearing. As the usage profile is adjusted,<br>
the percent of slewing bearing life exhausted 525 may be displayed as shown in graphical<br>
display 510.<br>
[0105]	To compare the Actual Rate of Usage for Component A to the Theoretical<br>
Rate of Usage that should have occurred per the Assumed Duty Profile in the first two years<br>
of operation for equipment X, reference is now made to FIG. 8. FIG. 8 is a graphical<br>
representation of how the Actual Component Usage compares to the Assumed Usage Profile<br>
as applied to the WSSR for Component A.<br>
[0106]	As indicated in FIG. 6, the theoretical amount of component life that should<br>
have been utilized in the first two years of operation is calculated by the following formula:<br>
(TCUPA / Selected Design Life) x actual years of use = Theoretical Life Used in Two Years<br>
(TLU2y). For Component A, the TLU2y value is 38,000 ft.lbs and is represented on the<br>
Assumed Duty Profile curve of FIG. 8 by a circle. Since the two year Actual Component<br>
Usage is 140,000 ft.lbs., which is represented on the Duty Profile curve of FIG. 8 by a dot, it<br>
can be understood that Component A is being worn at a rate that is significantly higher than<br>
predicted by the Assumed Duty Profile. As reflected in FIG. 8, the Actual Component Usage<br>
is equivalent to approximately 7.4 years of use at the Assumed Duty Profile rate. Thus, if the<br>
actual usage remains constant over the years, Component A will require replacement in<br>
significantly less than 25 years.<br>
[0107]	As indicated in FIG. 6, the formula for Component B's Actual Component<br>
Usage (ACUB) is (Nl x C2) + (N2 x C5) + (N3 x C8) = ACUB, which results in value of<br><br>
6875 ft.lbs. of work. As indicated in FIG. 5, the WSSR of the actual Component B utilized in<br>
equipment X was 392,000 ft.lbs. This value exceeds Component B's Theoretical Component<br>
Usage Profile (280,000 ft.lbs). Consequently, the actual WSSR of 392,000 is utilized in the<br>
following computation because this capacity is available, if needed, over the selected design<br>
life of 25 years.<br>
[0108]	Dividing the Actual Component Usage (6875  ) by 392,000 shows that<br>
approximately 1.75 percent of Component B's useful life has been utilized. This is reflected<br>
in FIG. 7, which graphically compares for each component the Actual Component Usage<br>
versus the WSSR for the actual component utilized.<br>
[0109]	To compare the Actual Rate of Usage for Component B to the Theoretical<br>
Rate of Usage that should have occurred per the Assumed Duty Profile in the first two years<br>
of operation for equipment X, reference is now made to FIG. 9. FIG. 9 is a graphical<br>
representation of how the Actual Component Usage compares to the Assumed Usage Profile<br>
as applied to the WSSR for Component B.<br>
[0110]	As indicated in FIG. 6, the theoretical amount of component life that should<br>
have been utilized in the first two years of operation is calculated by the following formula:<br>
(TCUPB / Selected Design Life) x actual years of use = Theoretical Life Used in Two Years<br>
(TLU2y). For Component B, the TLU2y value is 22,400 ft.lbs and is represented on the<br>
Assumed Duty Profile curve of FIG. 9 by a circle. Since the two year Actual Component<br>
Usage is 6875 ft.lbs., which is represented on the Duty Profile curve of FIG. 9 by a dot, it can<br>
be understood that Component B is being worn at a rate that is significantly lower than<br>
predicted by the Assumed Duty Profile. As reflected in FIG. 9, the Actual Component Usage<br>
is equivalent to approximately 0.6 years of use at the Assumed Duty Profile rate. Thus, if the<br>
actual usage remains constant over the years, Component B will last significantly longer than<br>
25 years. Also, even if the Actual Component Usage were equivalent to the Assumed Usage<br>
Profile, as illustrated in FIG. 9, Component B would have approximately 112,000 ft.lbs. of<br>
capacity left at the end of the 25 year period because the actual Component B had a WSSR of<br>
392,000 ft.lbs. while the theoretical usage profile for Component B only required 280,000<br>
ft.lbs.<br>
[0111]	As indicated in FIG. 6, the formula for Component C's Actual Component<br>
Usage (ACUC) is (Nl x C3) + (N2 x C6) + (N3 x C9) = ACUC, which results in value of<br>
77,000 ft.lbs. of work. As indicated in FIG. 5, the WSSR of the actual Component C utilized<br>
in equipment X was 400,000 ft.lbs. This value is less than Component B's Theoretical<br>
Component Usage Profile (800,000 ft.lbs).    Consequently, two Component C's must be<br><br>
utilized in succession to reach the selected design life of 25 years. Adding the WSSR's of the<br>
first and second Component C's results in an effective actual WSSR of 800,000. This<br>
effective WSSR is utilized in the following computation because this capacity is available, if<br>
needed, over the selected design life of 25 years.<br>
[0112]	Dividing the Actual Component Usage (77,000) by 800,000 shows that<br>
approximately 10 percent of the first and second Component Cs' useful life has been utilized.<br>
This is reflected in FIG. 7, which graphically compares for each component the Actual<br>
Component Usage versus the WSSR for the actual component utilized.<br>
[0113]	To compare the Actual Rate of Usage for Component C to the Theoretical<br>
Rate of Usage that should have occurred per the Assumed Duty Profile in the first two years<br>
of operation for equipment X, reference is now made to FIG. 10. FIG. 10 is a graphical<br>
representation of how the Actual Component Usage compares to the Assumed Usage Profile<br>
as applied to the WSSR for Component C.<br>
[0114]	As indicated in FIG. 6, the theoretical amount of component life that should<br>
have been utilized in the first two years of operation is calculated by the following formula:<br>
(TCUPC / Selected Design Life) x actual years of use = Theoretical Life Used in Two Years<br>
(TLU2y). For Component C, the TLU2y value is 64,000 ft.lbs and is represented on the<br>
Assumed Duty Profile curve of FIG. 10 by a circle. Since the two year Actual Component<br>
Usage is 77,000 ft.lbs., which is represented on the Duty Profile curve of FIG. 10 by a dot, it<br>
can be understood that Component C is being worn at a rate that is higher than predicted by<br>
the Assumed Duty Profile. As reflected in FIG. 10, the Actual Component Usage is<br>
equivalent to approximately 2.4 years of use at the Assumed Duty Profile rate. Thus, if the<br>
actual usage remains constant over the years, it will require more than two Component C's to<br>
last 25 years.<br>
[0115]	In sum, the preceding duty profile analysis, which uses assumed or theoretical<br>
operating conditions and available data on component useful life under these operating<br>
conditions, is used to select components and make an initial theoretical maintenance and<br>
component replacement plan. The plan is placed on the system and as actual operating<br>
conditions are sensed and reported, the duty profile models used for the initial design and the<br>
initial theoretical maintenance and component replacement plan are used to update the plan<br>
and to recognize conditions that require component maintenance. The updating can be done<br>
either in real time as each set of operating conditions data is reported or periodically after<br>
data has been collected for a specified interval.<br><br>
[0116]	FIG. 11 shows another embodiment of the present invention. It is similar to<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 1 in some aspects, but differs in other. For the sake of completeness<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 11 will be fully explained, even the features that are similar to the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 1.<br>
[0117]	In FIG. 11 the area 60 denotes the elements that are situated on-site, i.e., on or<br>
close to the equipment being monitored. The area 61 denotes the client computer site, e.g.,<br>
headquarters of the company using the equipment. The area 62 denotes the computer site of<br>
the service provider. The service provider may be the same company that has supplied the<br>
computer system and the equipment.<br>
[0118]	At the on-site area 60 is found the monitored equipment 63 that in this<br>
example is a top-drive and in a further example below a mud-pump, but may be any type of<br>
equipment feasible for monitoring. Moreover, in area 60 are found a computer 64 and two<br>
user interfaces 65 and 66. The user interface 65 contains documentation on the equipment 63.<br>
This may be technical specifications, manuals, certificates, etc. The user interface 66 provides<br>
on-site monitoring of the equipment 63, and allows the operator to monitor the performance<br>
and state of the equipment and associated sensors both current and historic. The interfaces 65<br>
and 66 are in communication with the on-site computer 64 via an on-site or local area<br>
network, denoted by 69. The user interfaces 65 and 66 can be accessed and viewed on any<br>
browser connected to the network.<br>
[0119]	At the client computer site 61 there is also a documentation user interface 67<br>
and a monitor interface 68. These give access to essentially the same information as the<br>
interfaces 65 and 66. The interfaces 67 and 68 are in communication with the on-site<br>
computer 64 via a network 70, which may be a corporate network, the Internet or a dedicated<br>
link.<br>
[0120]	At the client computer site 61 there is also a user interface 71 for performance<br>
monitoring that will be explained further in the following.<br>
[0121]	At the service provider area 62 is a server 73 (one or more may be present,<br>
depending on need). This server 73 is linked to the on-site computer 64 via the Internet,<br>
dedicated link 74 or other communication path. The server 73 collects performance (usage)<br>
data on the equipment 63 from the on-site computer 64. The server 73 also collects<br>
performance data on other pieces of similar equipment that may be present on other sites (not<br>
shown). On the basis of these collected data, the server 73 prepares aggregated and analyzed<br>
information on the specific type of equipment. This information is made available to the<br><br>
client through the performance monitor user interface 71 through a link 75. The link 75 may<br>
be the Internet, a dedicated link or other communication path.<br>
[0122]	The communication through the links 70, 74 and 75 may be through cable, any<br>
wireless communication system, via satellite or other communication path.  If the Internet is<br>
used as a link, the only requirement is that the on-site computer, the client site and the service<br>
provider site are connectable to the Internet.<br>
[0123]	On   the  equipment  63   are  situated  various   sensors   76.  These  perform<br>
measurements on the equipment 63 and present these to the on-site computer 64. Preferably<br>
the on-site computer 64 is a dedicated computer for the equipment 63 and may be physically<br>
attached to the equipment 63, so that it will follow the equipment if the equipment is moved<br>
to another site. Consequently, the on-site computer 64 may also be called an equipment<br>
computer.     Computer  64   is  configured  to  monitor  more  than  one   item  of equipment,<br>
preferably several completely different types.<br>
[0124]	FIGS 12 and 13 show a more detailed presentation of the monitoring system<br>
according to the embodiment of FIG. 11. In FIG. 12 some of the elements have been removed<br>
in comparison with FIG. 13 and vice versa, to facilitate the explanation of some of the<br>
aspects.<br>
[0125]	FIG. 12 shows how a new on-site computer 64, and hence a new piece of<br>
equipment 63, is coupled to the monitoring system and the set up of the on-site computer.<br>
The service provider server 73 is here divided into a number of elements 77-85. These will be<br>
explained in the following.<br>
[0126]	At the service provider site is also a performance monitor component 86,<br>
which is a user interface similar to the performance monitor 71 at the client site. There is also<br>
an analytical performance monitor component 87, which is another user interface that will be<br>
explained in more detail later. Finally, there is the database management GUI (graphic user<br>
interface) 88. In addition there may as an option be a business-to-business server 89 present<br>
at the service provider, serving as an interface to other client computer systems.<br>
[0127]	The management database GUI 88 provides access to a database that contains<br>
detailed information on all the equipment that may be connected to the monitoring system,<br>
including user interface information. During set-up a management database component 81<br>
receives information on the specific type of equipment that is to be connected. The<br>
management database component 81 then defines how the raw measurements will be treated<br>
so that the presentation of the values is convenient for further processing and analysis and for<br>
presentation on the user interface. These definitions may be, e.g., the time span between each<br><br>
storage of measurements, smoothing of measurements, etc. The management database 81 also<br>
contains the correspondence between a value sensed on equipment and the parameter to<br>
which the value belongs.<br>
[0128]	The management database 81 provides these definitions to a configuration file<br>
generator 79, a content server 78 and a local graphic user interface generator 77. The<br>
configuration file generator 79 generates a configuration file for the on-site computer 64 and<br>
the local graphic user interface generator 77 generates a local interface. All this information<br>
is fed through the content server and transmitted to the on-site computer 64.<br>
[0129]	Every time an update is made a new configuration file and/or a new graphic<br>
user interface is generated and transferred to the on-site computer in the above described<br>
way. This provides a single point for configuration of the on-site computer. The configuration<br>
can be made directly between the service provider and the on-site computer. The initial<br>
configuration contains the following elements:<br>
-selecting equipment to monitor<br>
-selecting computer type for data acquisition<br>
-select and configure signals and parameters for the data logger in the on-site<br>
computer<br>
-select and configure calculations, filters and logging frequency for the data logger in<br>
the on-site computer<br>
-select and configure communication route<br>
-edit corporate knowledge to be applied on the central server<br>
-define and set up company, plant and user accounts<br>
[0130]	Based on the input, the management database 81 will be the source from<br>
which to produce:<br>
-an XML configuration file to automatically set up all aspects of the data logger in the<br>
on-site computer by the configuration server 79<br>
-an XML configuration file to automatically set up the local monitor service via the<br>
interface 66 by the local GUI generator 77<br>
-an XML configuration file to automatically set up the local monitor content by the<br>
content server 78<br>
-automatic configuration and set up of database tables in the cubes 84<br>
automatic configuration of the logstream handler 80<br><br>
[0131]	The transmittal of the configuration file and the graphic user interface setup<br>
will conveniently be done via the Internet, but it is also possible to do it by shipment of a CD-<br>
ROM or other type of data storage medium.<br>
[0132]	FIG.   14  shows  a  general   overview  of the  on-site  computer  64.   The<br>
configuration file etc. is received through a network interface 601 and transferred through an<br>
input/output device 602 and final storage in a configuration database 607. The configuration<br>
handler will upon updating of its database 607 update all configurable parameters accordingly<br>
(for example parameters in elements 96, 97, 98 in FIG. 14).<br>
[0133]	Referring to FIG. 13, the data flow during the monitoring of the equipment<br>
will be explained. In addition to the elements shown in FIG. 12, FIG. 13 also shows an<br>
outbound queue 92 and an inbound queue 90 as well as an FTP (file transfer protocol) server<br>
91 and a network interface 93.<br>
[0134]	The measurement data from the on-site computer 64 is received through the<br>
network interface 93 by the FTP server 91. The data is put in the inbound queue 90. The<br>
logstream handler 80 is configured to get data from the inbound queue 90 at regular intervals.<br>
In the logstream handler 80 the data are arranged so that these are presented in an order that<br>
will enable temporary storage in the measurement database 82. The function of the logstream<br>
handler 80 will be explained in more detail below.<br>
[0135]	A copy of the data transmitted to the measurement database 82 is also stored<br>
in the bulk storage 85. The purpose of this is, firstly, for backup and, secondly, to enable<br>
additional processing of data at a later stage if new methods for making equipment evaluation<br>
calculations are developed.<br>
[0136]	The measurement data is post processed in the postprocessor 83, involving<br>
calculation of certain calculated values (some examples of these will be presented below).<br>
After this selected measurement data and calculated data will be stored in the cubes database<br>
84. The distinction between measurement data and calculated data is somewhat arbitrary,<br>
because calculations can occur at the equipment or at more central processors. Measurement<br>
data comes from the on-site (equipment) computer and is denominated raw, but it may be the<br>
result of calculations, filtering or other processing that occurs at the on-site computer. Such<br>
processing may also be done by intelligent sensors or controllers. Calculated data is what<br>
results after the measurement data are received and the particular algorithms are applied that<br>
produce from measurement data the desired calculated data useful in determining how<br>
component wear has progressed.<br><br>
[0137]	The performance monitor 86 and the analytical performance monitor 87 get<br>
data partly from the measurement database 82 (for tabular lists and reports) and partly from<br>
the cubes database 84 (for trend analyses, historic overview, etc.). The purpose of the<br>
performance monitor 86 is to make and present simple analyses to the person or persons<br>
monitoring the equipment, while the analytical monitor 87 presents more sophisticated<br>
analyses or freeform analyses. The simple analyses may be presented to an operator who<br>
needs to make quick decisions, while the more sophisticated analyses may be presented to a<br>
person who is making more strategic decisions. It is also conceivable to use one interface<br>
only for both simple and sophisticated analyses.<br>
[0138]	The acquiring of the measurement data will now be explained referring to<br>
FIG. 14, which show schematically the basic elements and components of the on-site<br>
computer 64.<br>
[0139]	The signals from sensors 76 (FIG. 11) are coupled to the input/output interface<br>
94. Each of the sensors has its own channel 95 and the measurement data is stored in a<br>
temporary storage 97 after scaling 96 (to make the value consistent with the specified<br>
measurement units).<br>
[0140]	A logger module 98 gets the data from the temporary storage. The logger<br>
module 98 transfers these data via an access buffer 99 to a transfer storage 600. To perform<br>
this correctly, the logger module 98 has been updated from the configuration handler 604 on<br>
how to handle the different pieces of data. From the transfer storage 600 the data is<br>
transmitted to a network interface 601 via an FTP input/output device 602 by the aid of a<br>
transfer handler 603. This data is subsequently received at the network interface 93 at the<br>
service provider (FIG. 13).<br>
[0141]	If a certain measurement received at 94 needs to be handled in a different way,<br>
the applicable configuration file will be updated and sent to storage with the configuration<br>
handler 604 in the way described above. The configuration handler 604 will then tell the<br>
logger module 98 how to handle the measurement, so that after the update the server 73 will<br>
receive the measurement information as requested. The update may, for instance, be to log a<br>
certain measurement at longer or shorter intervals. Since the configuration file is stored on-<br>
site, the system is not dependent on being online for the measurements to be handled in the<br>
desired way.<br>
[0142]	A local log storage 605 also exists. This enables local storage of data in the<br>
event of a break in the link between the on-site computer 64 and the server 73. In some cases<br>
it may prove difficult to obtain an online connection between the on-site computer 64 and the<br><br>
server 73. In this case the data may be transferred regularly to a storage medium, e.g., a<br>
removable memory that can be connected to the computer via a USB port (USB memory).<br>
The storage medium may even be shipped to the service provider by ordinary mail or other<br>
physical delivery.<br>
[0143]	The on-site computer 64 also comprises an event module 606 that detects<br>
malfunctions in the measurement equipment (sensors, sensor wiring, etc.) and measurements<br>
that are out of the normal range of the equipment. These events are also transferred to the<br>
transfer storage 600 and hence to the server 73.<br>
[0144]	The handling of data in the service provider server 73 will be explained further<br>
referring to FIG. 15. The raw data that is in the inbound queue 90 (FIG. 13) is represented by<br>
reference number 620. The logstream handler 80 (FIG. 13) will parse the raw data 620, as<br>
denoted by reference number 621. The parsing particularly involves identifying the individual<br>
values in a data stream and assigning the correct identification to the values. After this the<br>
logstream handler 80 fills in "inherited" values, denoted by reference number 622. In order to<br>
reduce the amount of data that has to be transferred from the on-site computer 64 to the<br>
server 73, the on-site computer 64 will not send values if a measured value remains<br>
unchanged, e.g., if the top-drive 63 is lifting a load, the value of the first measurement of the<br>
load weight will be sent. (This can be effected with a filter that causes negligible changes in<br>
signals to be classified as unchanged.) After this no further values will be sent until the load<br>
weight changes, e.g., when the load reaches the drill floor. In 622 the "missing values" are<br>
filled in, so that the same value is repeated at regular intervals for the time the load was<br>
constant. This reduces the stream of data and hence the required bandwidth substantially.<br>
[0145]	After this the prepared data is transferred to the post processor 83, which<br>
calculates values based on the measured values, denoted by reference number 623. Examples<br>
of calculated values will be given below. Lookups in the management database determine the<br>
storage of values in the measurement database 81 and their post processing method into the<br>
multi-dimensional information cubes.<br>
[0146]	The post processor 83 may also identify out of limit values, denoted by<br>
reference number 624. The out of limit values may. for example, be excess load, excess<br>
running hours, out of range pressures or temperatures, etc., which signal problems or<br>
excessive consumption of useful life of a component. After the post processing the measures,<br>
values and identification are entered into a database consisting of a number of<br>
multidimensional "cubes." Multidimensional cubes have gained increased popularity as a<br>
means   for   storing   large   amount   of data  that   has   to   be   readily   accessible.   The<br><br>
multidimensional cubes can be seen as multidimensional matrixes in which each parameter is<br>
listed along one dimension, one dimension for each parameter. This way of storing the data<br>
provides the opportunity to quickly display tables and graphs showing the relationship<br>
between any of the parameters, even if the amount of data is very large.<br>
[0147]	Data in the multidimensional cubes has some main characteristics:<br>
-the data is pre-aggregated to obtain high performance in searches and retrievals, or<br>
otherwise to facilitate data-mining by tools such as neural networks<br>
-the data is arranged along predefined axes to enable and simplify X-Y charts (e.g.,<br>
view distribution of temperatures over different pressures)<br>
-the data is optimized for searches across large number of similar type of equipment<br>
[0148]	In addition, the multidimensional cubes enable storage of all data collected<br>
over the full lifetime for large number of equipment units.<br>
[0149]	As a result, this enables a new way of consolidating lifetime data as a platform<br>
for empirical investigation and data mining to be fed back into the design process or service<br>
procedures. Information about how and when maintenance was executed is stored in the same<br>
database, and correlated in time.<br>
[0150]	The multidimensional cubes are in this particular example three separate<br>
cubes. The first, denoted by reference number 625, contains all measurements, including<br>
most of the calculated parameters. The second, denoted by reference number 626 contains the<br>
calculated parameters critical to the lifetime surveillance, like the load weighted running<br>
hours, for monitoring the operation of the equipment. The third cube, denoted by reference<br>
number 627, contains the out of limit measures. If there have been no occurrences of out of<br>
limit values, this cube is empty.<br>
[0151]	The monitoring of the equipment will now be explained in more detail,<br>
referring to examples of parameters and charts.<br>
[0152]	FIG. 16 shows a table of typical parameters to be measured and logged for a<br>
piece of equipment, in this example a mud pump, as well as the measurement units applicable<br>
for each parameter. The table shows various pressures, temperatures, flows, running hours,<br>
fault codes (if applicable), etc.<br>
[0153]	FIG.   17 shows  in the  upper part some constants that are  used  in the<br>
calculations of calculated parameters and in the lower part a table of typical calculated<br>
parameters for a mud pump. The first column shows the constant or parameter text, the<br>
second column shows the constant or parameter name in the computer system, the third<br><br>
column shows the unit for the constant or parameter and the fourth column shows for the<br>
value of the constants or the formula used to calculate the parameter. In the upper right hand<br>
corner is a frame listing definitions of some of the variables, i.e., measured parameters<br>
received as raw data measurement inputs for the calculated wear parameters.<br>
[0154]	One of the more important calculated wear parameters for certain types of<br>
equipment is the accumulated, load weighted running hours, which is listed at the bottom of<br>
FIG. 17. This is calculated according to the following formula:<br>
[0155]	T_hrw+f*w*delta-t/3600<br>
[0156]	where delta-t/3600 is the time in seconds since the last logging of accumulated<br>
load weighted running hours in seconds divided by seconds per hour.<br>
[0157]	w is a load factor according to the following formula:<br>
[0158]	(2*p_disch/p_rated)Ae * (2*S_pump/S_rated),<br>
[0159]	where pdisch  is the current discharge pressure from the pump<br>
measured, prated is a constant denoting rated pressure, which has the value 517.1 bar,<br>
Spump is the current pump speed and Srated is a constant denoting rated pump speed,<br>
(which has the value 212 strokes per minute.<br>
[0160]- :f ( r is a binary factor that has the value zero or one, according to the following<br>
formula:<br>
[0161]	If(S_pump
[0162]	where Spump is the pump speed and Srated is the rated pump speed,<br>
as given above. Consequenfiy, r is zero if the current pump speed is less than 2% of 212<br>
strokes per minute and one if the current pump speed is equal to or greater than this.<br>
[0163]	Thrw is the previously logged accumulated load weighted running hours.<br>
[0164]	All the other calculated factors are also calculated    based on measured<br>
parameters or constants specified at the server 73.<br>
[0165]	FIG. 18 shows a table containing the limits for some critical parameters used<br>
at step 624 of FIG. 15. The first column shows the ID number for the limit, the second<br>
column shows the parameter limit name, the third column shows the logical operator to be<br>
used and the fourth column shows the limit value. If any of these parameters fall outside the<br>
limit set, an out of limit value will be entered into the out of limit cube 627.<br>
[0166]	For certain types of equipment it is of vital significance to have 2-dimensional<br>
limit values. This is the case with, e.g., a crane. The crane may have different lifting capacity<br>
depending on the angular position of the boom in both the horizontal and the vertical plane.<br>
In this case the performance limits will be different depending on the boom position.   The<br><br>
crane may have a high lifting capacity over a certain sector in the horizontal plane. In another<br>
sector in the horizontal plane, it may be prohibited to use the crane only with empty hook (for<br>
transit only) or with a smaller load. The load limit in the same sector may also depend on the<br>
boom angle. Consequently, if the boom passes into a sector with an excess load, an out of<br>
limit event can be detected based on the 2-dimensional limit values. The operator may get a<br>
message telling him how to return within one of the limits where the sensed value is within<br>
his control or that the operation must cease; e.g., instructed that if he raises the boom to a<br>
steeper angle, he may pass through the sector with this load, or that it is not possible to pass<br>
this sector.<br>
[0167]	The 2-dimensional performance limits can be implemented in the system as a<br>
2-dimensional table, such as FIG. 26, which is convenient to store in multidimensional cubes.<br>
For some equipment more than 2-dimensions might be used to define the design envelope for<br>
safe or appropriate operation. Thus, the 2-dimensional performance limits can be extended to<br>
N-dimensional performance limits.<br>
[0168]	FIG. 19 shows a screen print containing a table with measurements made on a<br>
mud pump. The first column 1902 shows the year, the second column 1904 shows the<br>
parameters measured, with a limit description on some of the parameters (this corresponds to<br>
some of the limits shown in FIG. 18). Third and fourth columns 1906, 1908 show the number<br>
of measurements taken for each of the parameters.<br>
[0169]	FIG. 20 shows a screen print as it might appear at a GUI at 66, 68 or at server<br>
73 containing a chart showing the flow 2002 from a mud pump, with the flow plotted against<br>
time. The time span 2004 is in this case the first 24 days of a month. As is evident from the<br>
graph, the pump has been running all days except for one.<br>
[0170]	FIG. 21   shows a screen print containing a chart showing the discharge<br>
pressure distribution in a mud pump graphed against the rotational speed of the pump. The<br>
pressure has been divided into different classes, each covering a span of 50 MPa. This is<br>
plotted along the axis 628. The rotational speed has also been divided into different classes,<br>
each covering a span of 50 RPM, and plotted along the axis 629. The vertical axis 630 show<br>
the number of running hours within each pressure class and revolution speed class. As is<br>
evident from the graph the pump has been running for many hours with a moderate pressure<br>
and high speed, as denoted by reference number 631. As shown by bars 632 and 633, the<br>
pump has also been running for some time with high pressure at a moderate speed. However,<br>
for very little time has the pump been running with low speed and high pressure.<br><br>
[0171]	By using this technique and also including data from a plurality of pumps, it is<br>
possible to make an average utilization profile of the type of pump. FIG. 22 shows an<br>
example of a typical performance chart for a mud pump, showing the distribution of the<br>
pump utilization. As the chart shows, the pump (or pump type, if a plurality of pumps has<br>
been monitored) is used 40% of the time at moderate pressure and pump rate. With the<br>
utilization profile as a basis it is possible to predict wear of critical components in the pump.<br>
Some components wear to a greater extent in high pressure environments and some wear<br>
more in high speed environments. Other components are more susceptible to high<br>
temperature and others again are more susceptible to high stress. By evaluating not only the<br>
running hours but also taking into account the conditions the equipment has been running in,<br>
it is possible to predict more accurately where in the lifespan of the critical components one is<br>
at a specific time. For instance, the load may be taken into account so that, e.g., for a pump<br>
the running hours is multiplied by the average flow the pump has delivered. Another example<br>
is to keep track of the total time the temperature at a certain place in the pump has been in<br>
excess of a certain limit, the limit, e.g., being based on a temperature above which a sealing<br>
material is susceptible to damage. Any combination of load weighted parameters may be<br>
calculated in the system of the present invention. When the load weighted parameter exceeds<br>
a set limit a warning may be sent to the operator, informing him of the fact that a component<br>
is approaching the end of its life span. Preferably, the warning is sent out well before the<br>
expected life span has come to an end, so that there is sufficient time for planning<br>
maintenance of the equipment, including component replacement.<br>
[0172]	In   addition   to   the   warning   informing   the   operator   of  an   upcoming<br>
maintenance, it is also feasible to send out an alarm if a parameter exceeds a critical limit,<br>
indicating that a failure may occur at any time, or that the equipment has to be run at a<br>
reduced performance until maintenance has been performed.<br>
[0173]	The warning and the alarm is sent out via the management database 81 and the<br>
content server 78. It can be posted as a message on the user interfaces 66, 68, 86 and 87. In<br>
addition, it can be messaged over any media to client interfaces. This can be e-mail, SMS,<br>
pagers, etc. Via the B2B server, the system can also send the information digitally to a client<br>
management system.<br>
[0174]	When maintenance has been performed, the parameters forming the basis for<br>
the warning or the alarm are set to an initial value, so that the monitoring of the life span can<br>
start from fresh again.<br><br>
[0175]	It is also possible to perform trend analyses based on experience data. The<br>
experience data is a result of an extensive analysis of failures that has occurred in similar<br>
equipment previously. If, e.g., a certain bearing has failed and resulted in a major breakdown<br>
and possibly also damages on other parts of the equipment or other pieces of equipment, the<br>
conditions present at the time before the failure may be analyzed. It is then possible to see if<br>
any values or calculated values have undergone a change during the time before the failure.<br>
The time span some minutes before the failure is first investigated but the time span within<br>
hours or even days or weeks before the failure will also be taken into account.<br>
[0176]	The results are then compared with results from other similar failures to find<br>
out if there is something in common between all or at least some of the failures.<br>
[0177]	If this correlation of parameters is likely to be connected with the failure, a<br>
procedure may be implemented in the computer controlling the pump that based on sensor<br>
reading (the on-site computer is not involved in the process, but the lessons learned are<br>
implemented into the pump control computer) at regular intervals (the interval depending on<br>
how quickly the failure may occur) calculates the correlation between the above factors. If a<br>
condition occurs that is similar to the conditions that were present at the time before failure in<br>
the previous occurrences, the computer may stop the equipment or, if time allows, perform a<br>
controlled shut down of the system that the pump is a part of.<br>
[0178]	An example of this is shown in FIG. 25. This graph shows a plot of the torque<br>
of the two motors A and B running the pump for a period of time on January 21, 2004<br>
starting at 01:00. At 02:15 a failure of the pump occurred. The reason, found out later, was<br>
that a bearing suddenly failed. As is evident from the graph, the torque of both motor A and<br>
B had a remarkable increase from 02:13, increasing with a large gradient until the failure.<br>
When the failure occurred this had detrimental consequences to the equipment connected to<br>
the pump. This increased torque could not be explained by any outside factors, like increased<br>
pump rate or higher viscosity of the pumped fluid. The torque was still within the normal<br>
range that the motors were capable of delivering and the pump was able to receive.<br>
According to the regular out of limit measurements, an out-of-limit event would not occur, at<br>
least not until it was too late to prevent the critical failure.<br>
[0179]	This example shows one incident only. Nevertheless, the relation between the<br>
increased torque and the failure may be likely enough to implement a check for a similar<br>
condition in this type of equipment. The condition for such a situation to be considered<br>
present may be that if the torque increases with a steep gradient, e.g. above 200 Nm/s, for<br>
more than 20 seconds and there is no increase in input or viscosity or other factors that will<br><br>
naturally influence the torque, an alarm will go off or the computer operating the pump will<br>
perform a controlled shut down.<br>
[0180]	An upcoming failure may also be indicated by conditions that develop more<br>
slowly than within a couple of minutes. For instance experience may have shown that if a<br>
sealing has been subject to a temperature above a certain value or a period of time, this will<br>
increase the risk of leakage substantially. However, the leakage will not occur until the<br>
pressure is above a certain value. If such a situation occurs the computer operating the<br>
equipment will be told to operate the equipment so that a pressure limit is not exceeded. At<br>
the same time the operator will receive a message informing him of the situation.<br>
[0181]	If the rate-of-change for a temperature parameter is of importance to predict a<br>
problem, the algorithm module (e.g., at post-processor 83) may calculate the rate-of-change.<br>
The performance limit may have an entry defining the limit for when this rate-of-change is<br>
outside its normal operating environment.<br>
[0182]	By implementing algorithms that can foresee a failure based on previous<br>
experience, the chances of a critical failure can be substantially reduced. These algorithms<br>
can be installed in the management database 81 much the same way as the initial set-up of the<br>
on-site computer.<br>
[0183]	Load weighted running hours can be used as a basis for total estimated<br>
lifetime for a wear part, and is hence a typical performance limit. The limit can be adjusted as<br>
broader and broader experience is gained. By checking the load weighted running hour<br>
accumulator against this limit, it is possible to predict remaining lifetime under similar<br>
conditions and operation, propose inspection intervals, propose ordering of spare parts, etc.<br>
[0184]	The theoretical model for this trend analysis is preferably managed as tables<br>
and records in a database, with a web-based user interface. An internal product champion can<br>
be authorized to maintain the model, and it can grow incrementally as new knowledge about<br>
the equipment is gained. For example, data mining cam be used to identify data patterns that<br>
may be used to predict failure of different aspects of a single component, based on different<br>
operating conditions experienced by different components. Neural networks may be used to<br>
identify the patterns and also to detect their re-occurrence.<br>
[0185]	In addition to the lifespan monitoring, trend analysis and an out of limit<br>
surveillance, it is also possible to monitor the equipment in real time. FIG. 23 shows a screen<br>
dump containing a chart of the running hours of a mud pump. The graph 634 shows the<br>
running hours as such for each day in the year 2004 until 13th May, which is the date of the<br>
screen dump. The graph 635 shows the load weighted running hours for the same period. It is<br><br>
[0193]	The system may be designed to both propose and report maintenance actions.<br>
It can publish maintenance actions to the on-site computer in the same way as it publishes<br>
news and bulletins. The source of this information can be maintenance algorithms which take<br>
actual load weighted use of the machine into consideration, i.e., it can propose an action for<br>
inspection of a bearing every 14 days if the load applied to the machine is dominated by a<br>
heavy speed component, or adjust the same interval to 2 months if the applied load is<br>
dominated by pressure components.<br>
[0194]	Just like for the bulletin, the operator opens a maintenance header. He can also<br>
check a box and fill in status for the action, and post it back to the system. At next<br>
connection, the service report is transmitted into the database, where it is correlated to all<br>
other data.<br>
[0195]	Each on-site computer can carry the documentation for the machine it is<br>
monitoring. The as-built version of the documentation can be uploaded at installation.<br>
During operation, the service provider can publish new or updated documents through the<br>
management database.<br>
[0196]	Just like for the news and bulletins, it is possible to post headings only first.<br>
Operators can check or confirm that they want the new documentation uploaded at the next<br>
reconnect.<br>
[0197]	Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred<br>
embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and<br>
detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
