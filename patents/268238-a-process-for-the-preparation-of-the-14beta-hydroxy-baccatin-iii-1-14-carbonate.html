				<td>A    PROCESS    FOR   THE    PREPARATION    OF    THE    14BETA-HYDROXY-BACCATINIII-114-CARBONATE<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 14(3-hydroxy-l,14-carbonate-baccatin III. The product obtained with the process of the invention can be used in the preparation of novel taxane derivatives with antitumor activity.<br>
Taxanes are one of the most important classes of antitumor agents developed in recent years. Paclitaxel is a diterpene complex obtained from the bark of Taxus brevifolia and is considered one of the major medicaments for the therapy of cancer. At present, an extensive search is being carried out for novel taxane derivatives having superior pharmacological activity and improved pharmacokinetic profile. A specific approach relates to baccatin III derivatives variously modified with respect to the parent structure. Examples of said compounds are represented by the 14(3-hydroxy baccatin III derivatives disclosed in US 5705508, WO 97/43291, WO 96/36622. At present, 14p-hydroxy-deacetylbaccatin III 1,14-carbonate derivatives are prepared starting from the precursor 14P-hydroxy-deacetylbaccatin III, which is a natural compound obtainable in small amounts by extraction of the leaves of Taxus wallichiana, as disclosed in EP 559 019. There is strong need for novel processes for the easy, effective preparation of large amounts of 14|3-hydroxy-l,14-carbonate-baccatin III, and hence the derivatives thereof.<br>
It has now been found that 14ß-hydroxy -baccatin III-1,14-carbonate can be prepared with a process starting from 13-ketobaccatin III, which compound can be easily obtained from 10-deacetylbaccatin III, which can in turn be easily isolated in large amounts from the leaves of Taxus baccata, contrary to 14ß-hydroxy-baccatin III.<br><br>
Therefore, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of 140-hydroxy-baccatin III-l,14-carbonate which comprises the following steps: a.      treatment of 7-triethylsilyl-13-ketobaccatin III of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)with suitable bases and oxidizing agents, to give 7-triethylsilyl-13-keto-14-hydroxy-baccatin III:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)b.     carbonation of the 1 and 14 hydroxyls to give 14p-Hydroxy-7-<br>
triethylsilyl -13-keto-baccatin III-l,14-carbonate:<br>
(Formula Removed)c. reduction of the ketone at the 13- position and cleavage of the protecting group in 7.<br>
Starting 13-ketobaccatin III is conveniently protected at the 7- position with a suitable protective group, preferably selected from silyl ethers<br>
(preferably triethylsilyl ether). Step a) is carried out by treatment with a suitable base, in particular potassium t-butoxide (t-BuOK) or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS). The reaction can be carried out at -40 to -78°C. Suitable solvents for this reaction are ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, in particular in mixture with hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) or l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)pyrimidinone (DMPU). The enolate is then treated with an oxidizing agent, such as oxaziridine derivatives (in particular N-benzenesulfonyl phenyl oxaziridine, N-benzenesulfonyl in-nitrophenyl oxaziridine and camphorsulfonyloxaziridine) to provide the 7-protected 13-keto-14-hydroxy-baccatin III derivative.<br>
Step b) is then carried out by treatment with a carbonylating agent (for example carbonyldiimidazole or phosgene) under the conditions usually described in literature, to provide the 1,14-carbonate derivative. The reaction can be conveniently carried out in inert solvents, preferably ethers or chlorinated solvents, in the presence of a base (preferably pyridine or triethylamine), at a temperature ranging from -40°C to room temperature. The reaction can be carried out both on the pure starting material and on the crude from the previous step.<br>
The reduction of the carbonyl at the 13- position of step c) is easily carried out with sodium borohydride in ethanol at a temperature usually ranging from -20 to -50°C, and is completed within 2-6 hours. The reaction can also be carried out in methanol, isopropanol, or in a methanol and tetrahydrofuran mixture. The reducing agent can be used in stoichiometric amount, although an excess of hydride is preferably used. The reduction can also be effected with other hydrides, preferably tetrabutylammonium borohydride, lithium borohydride, sodium triacetoxy borohydride, in the conditions known in the art.<br>
Protection at the 7- position is removed under conditions depending on<br>
the protective group used. For example, if the protective group at the 7-position is triethylsilyl ether, hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid in methanol or hydrofluoric acid and pyridine in acetonitrile can successfully be used.<br>
13-Keto-baccatin III can conveniently be prepared by oxidation of<br>
baccatin III. Oxidation of baccatin III can be carried out with ozone, or with<br>
manganese   dioxide   in   aprotic   solvents   such   as   methylene   chloride,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethyl acetate. The reaction can be carried out at<br>
'0°C - 60°C, more preferably at room temperature.<br>
The processes  of the  invention  are  summarized in  the  following scheme:<br>
(Scheme Removed)The following example further illustrates the invention.<br>
The abbreviations used are as follows:<br>
AcOEt = ethyl acetate; TES = triethylsilyl; TESCI = triethylsilyl chloride; DCM = dichloromethane, THF = tetrahydrofuran.<br>

Baccatin III (150 g, 0.25 mol) was dissolved in acetone (1.43 L). Commercially available manganese dioxide (450 g) was added in three portions under strong stirring. After the starting product disappeared (4 h) the suspension was filtered and the solvent evaporated off. The crude was<br>
suspended in AcOEt (100 ml) and re fluxed for 1 h, then c-Hexane (100 ml) was added. The title compound was obtained from mother liquors, after evaporation of the solvent, as a white solid (140 g, 95%).<br>

The aqueous layer was washed, extracted with DCM (2 x 10 ml) and the combined organic layers were extracted with brine (2 x 20 ml). The organic solution was dried over sodium sulfate to give 4.7 g of the title compound, sufficiently pure for the subsequent step. M.p.: 212°C.

mixture of anhydrous THF (9 ml) and DMPU (2 ml) and cooled to -60°C under N2. A 1M solution of f-BuOK in THF (2.5 ml, 0.86 mmol), previously cooled to -50°C, was dropped therein. This solution was stirred at -60°C for 45 minutes, then added drop by drop with (±)-camphorsulfonyl-oxaziridine (440 mg, 2 mmol) dissolved in anhydrous THF (2 ml).
