				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the diastereoselective synthesis process of 5-substituted imidazole compounds which have farnesyl tranferase inhibitory activity and to compounds used in the synthesis process for said imidazole compounds.<br>
Famesyltransferase inhibitors block the main post-translational modification of the Ras protein, thus interfering with its localization to the inner surface of the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of the downstream effectors. Although initially developed as a strategy to target Ras in cancer, famesyltransferase inhibitors have subsequently been acknowledged as acting by additional and more complex mechanisms that may extend beyond Ras involving GTP-binding proteins, kinases, centromere-binding proteins and probably other farnesylated proteins.<br>
A particular famesyltransferase inhibitor is described in WO 97/21701, namely (R)-(+)-6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl)(l-methyl-lH-imidazol-5-yI)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(1H)-quinolinone. The absolute stereochemical configuration of the compound was not determined in the experiments described in the above-mentioned patent specification, but the compound was identified by the prefix "(B)" to indicate that it was the second compound isolated from column chromatography. The compound thus obtained has been found to have the (R)-(+)-configuration. This compound will be referred to below by its published code number Rl 15777 and has the following formula (V).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Rl 15777 (Tipifarnib) is a potent, orally active inhibitor of famesylprotein transferase. It is one of the most advanced of the famesylprotein transferase inhibitors currently reported to be in clinical development, being one of the agents that have progressed to phase HI studies.<br>
Rl 15777 has been found to have very potent activity against neoplastic diseases. Antineoplastic activity in solid tumors, such as breast cancer, as well as in <br>
haematological malignancies, such as leukemia, have been observed. Also combination studies have been carried out demonstrating that Rl 15777 can be safely combined with several highly active anticancer drugs.<br>
In WO 01/53289, the racemates (±) (4-(3-chloro-phenyl)-6-[(6-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-(4-methoxy-benzylamino)-(3-methyl-3flr-imidazol-4-yl)-methyl]-l-cyclopropylmethyl-l.H-quinolm-2-one (racemate 1) and (±) 4-(3-chloro-phenyl)-6-[(6-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-[(4-methoxy-benzylidene)-amino]-(3-methyl-3fl-imidazol-4-yl)-methyl]-l-cyclopropylrnethyl-l/f-quinolrn-2-one (racemate 2) are prepared.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
After chiral molecule separation using column chromatography, either the benzylamino or the benzilidine moiety of the resulting (+) and /or (-) enantiomers are converted to an amino group under acidic conditions.<br>
The synthesis of Rl 15777 as originally described in WO 97/21701, is presented in scheme 1.<br>
Herein, in step 1, the intermediate 1-methyl imidazole in tetrahydrofuran, is mixed with a solution of n-butyllithium in a hexane solvent to which is added chlorotriethylsilane (triethylsilyl chloride), followed by a further addition of n-butyllithium in hexane, the resulting mixture being cooled to -78°C before the addition of a solution of a compound of formula (I), i.e. 6-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(lfl)-quinolinone in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is subsequently brought to room temperature, and then hydrolysed, extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer worked up to obtain a compound of formula (II), i.e. (±)-6-[hydroxy(4-chlorophenyl) (l-methyl-l//-imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(lH)-quinolinone.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
In step 2, the hydroxy compound of formula (II) is chlorinated with thionylchloride to form a compound of formula (IE), i.e. (±)-6-[chloro(4-chlorophenyI)(l-methyl-l#-imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(lfl)-quinolinone.<br>
In step 3, the chloro compound of formula (DI) is treated, with NHLtOH in tetrahydrofuran to form the amino compound of formula (TV), i.e. (±)-6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl)(l-methyl-lF-imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(l#)-quinolinone.<br>
In step 4, the amino compound of formula (IV) is separated into its enantiomers by chiral column chromatography over Chiracel OD (25 cm; eluent 100% ethanol; flow: 0.5 ml/min; wavelength: 220 nm). The pure (B)-fractions are collected and recrystallised from 2-propanol resulting in Rl 15777, the compound of formula (V).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
However, the procedure described in WO97/21701 has a number of disadvantages. For example, during the first step, the procedure results in the undesired formation of a<br><br>
corresponding compound of formula (XI), i.e. 6-[hydroxy(4-chlorophenyl) (1-methyl-l//'-iraidazol-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-methyl-2(lJH)-quinolinone), in which the imidazole ring is attached to the remainder of the molecule at the 2-position of the ring, instead of the desired 5-position. At the end of the procedure, this results in the formation of a compound of formula (XII), i.e.6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl)(l-methyl-lJ/-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-i-methyl-2(ifl)-quinolinone.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The use of n-butyllithium during the conversion of a compound of formula (I) in a compound of formula (II) is also undesirable in a commercial process in view of its pyrophoric nature and the formation of butane, a flammable gas, as the by-product. Also the carrying out of this process step, at a temperature as low as -78°C, is inconvenient and costly on a commercial scale.<br>
Finally, the purification of compound (V) using chiral chromatography is expensive and disadvantageous in view of the large amounts of solvent needed and the specialised equipment required to perform a large scale chiral chromatography.<br>
Another process for the synthesis of Rl 15777 as described in WO 02/072574, is presented in scheme 2.<br>
Herein, in step 1,1-methyl imidazole in tetrahydrofuran is mixed with a solution of n-hexyllithium in a hexane solvent to which is added tri-iso-butylsilyl chloride, followed by a further addition of n-hexyllithium in hexane. The compound of formula (I) in tetrahydrofuran is then added to the reaction mixture, keeping the temperature between -5°C and 0°C. The resulting product of formula (IT) is isolated by salt formation.<br>
In step 2, the chlorination reaction is effected by treatment of the compound of formula OD with thionyl chloride in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone.<br><br>
In step 3, the chloro compound of formula (HI) is treated with a solution of ammonia in methanol. After the addition of water, the compound of formula (IV), precipitates and can be isolated.<br>
In step 4, the compound of formula (IV) can be reacted with L-(-)-dibenzoyl tartaric acid (DBTA) to form the diastereomeric tartrate salt with formula (VI) i.e. R-(-)-6-[amino(4-chlorophenyl)(l -methyl- 1 #-imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-4-(3-chloropheny 1)- 1 -methyl-2(lfl&gt;quinolinone[R-(R*,RH')]-2,3-bis(benzoyloxy)butanedioate(2:3),<br>
Finally, in step 5, the compound of formula (VI) is treated with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, to form the crude compound of formula (V) which is then purified by recrystallisation from ethanol to the pure compound (V).<br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
However, in view of the fact that water is present during the third and the fifth step of this procedure, there is significant formation of the hydroxy compound of formula (II).<br><br>
This is important because the compounds of formula (n) and (V) are difficult to separate. In order to keep the quality of the final product (V) as high as possible, it is critical to limit the formation of compound (II).<br>
The major drawback of the above described processes is the generation of large amounts of the other enantiomer that subsequently must be recycled.<br>
Attempts were made to develop processes that solve this problem. One of the possibilities was to enter chirality in the first step of the procedure. A first study was carried out in order to determine if the conversion of an enantiomer of the hydroxy compound of formula (II) into a compound of formula (TV) could preserve chirality. Several experimental conditions have been tested starting with an enantiomer of a compound of formula (II), but racemisation always occurred.<br>
Another possibility was to try entering chirality by adding N-methylimidazole under the reaction conditions described herein above under steps 1 of WO97/21701 and WO 02/072574, to an A^Ci-6alkyl-(S(R))-sulfinylketimine prepared from the compound of formula (I). It turned out that the resulting N-Ci^alkyl-(S(R))-sulfmylamide of the compound of formula (I) was in the desired R-configuration and could be used for conversion into compound (V).<br>
These results are completely unexpected, especially in view of Shaw et al. (Tetrahedron Letters: 42,7173-7176). Already in 2001, Shaw et al. disclosed an asymmetric synthesis process for the production of cc-aryl-a-heteroaryl alkylamines using organometallic additions to AMert-butanesulfinyl ketimines. However, the configuration and the yield of the final enantiomer formed with this process, was depending on the configuration of the Af-tert-butanesulfinyl moiety of the ketimines, the composition of the aryl and/or the heteroaryl moieties of the ketimines, as well as on the organo- and the metallic moiety of the organometallic reagent. Furthermore, the use of heteroaryllithium reagents were described in this document, as being in particular disadvantageous, in view of their instability.<br>
Thus the present invention solves the above described problems. It provides a new process for the preparation of the compound of formula (V) without the need to recycle one of the enantiomers while minimising the formation of undesired isomers and impurities and under conditions which offer economic advantages for operation on a commercial scale.<br><br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula<br>

N<br>
(IX)<br>
wherein R is Ci^alkyl or Ci^alkylphenyl- with a C^alkyllithium compound, 1-methylimidazole and a tri(C2-4alkyl)silyl halide.<br>
As used in the foregoing definitions and hereinafter Cj_6alkyl defines straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, l-methy]ethyl, 2-methylpropyl, pentyl, 2-methyl-butyl, hexyl, 2-methylpentyl and the like, Chalky! defines straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 4 to 6 carbon atoms such as, e.g. butyl, 2-methylpropyl, pentyl, 2-methyl-butyl, hexyl, 2-methylpentyl and the like, Ca^alkyl defines straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as, e.g. ethyl, propyl, butyl, 1-methylethyl, 2-methylpropyl and the like.<br>
(S(R)) in the chemical name of some compounds means that the sulfur-atom in the molecule is in the R-configuration and (S(S)) means that the sulfur-atom in the molecule is in the S-configuration.<br><br>
In the above described process, the diastereomeric excess of a compound of formula (VIII) is generally 20 % or higher, preferably higher than 60 %, more preferably higher than 80 %, most preferably higher than 94 %. The two diastereomers can be further purified (from the other diastereomer) by standard techniques like crystallisation or chromatography.<br>
After conversion of a compound of formula (VIII) into the enantiomer of formula (V), racemisation or formation of a compound of formula (II) does not appear. The enantiomers of formula (V) can be further purified (from the other enantiomer) by standard techniques, such as crystallisation.<br>
The reaction is conveniently effected in an ethereal organic solvent, for example diethylether, tert-butyl methyl ether or more preferably tetrahydrofuran.<br>
t<br>
The C4.6alkyllithium can be butyllithium especially n-butyllithium, more preferably hexyllithium, especially n-hexyllithium. The tri(C2-4alkyl)silyl halide can be triethylsilyl halide, more preferably a tributylsilyl halide, especially tri-i'jo-butylsilyl halide. The silyl halide is preferably a silyl chloride.<br>
It is common general knowledge that diastereomeric excess is higher when a diastereoselective process is performed at low temperatures. Unexpectedly, in the present invention, the influence of temperature can be limited. The reaction can be performed between -78°C and 0°C, preferably between -40°C and 0°C, more preferably between -15°C and 0°C. The carrying out of this process step, at a temperature between -15°C and 0°C is expedient on a commercial scale. Furthermore higher temperatures can provide an improved yield.<br>
In addition, the use of a temperature between -15°C and 0°C during this process, in combination with n-hexyllithium and tri-wo-butylsilyl chloride can provide an , improved C5:C2-isomer ratio, i.e. the ratio between the compound in which the imidazolyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule at the OS-position and the corresponding compound attached at the C2-position. For example, when during the process, n-butyllithium is used in combination with triethylsilyl chloride at a temperature of -70°C, the resulting product can generally, in accordance with prior art procedures discussed above, have a C5:C2-isomer ratio of 95:5. However, at temperatures above -50°C the formation of the C2-isomer when compared to the C5-isomer, will be favoured (see scheme 3).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br><br>
scheme 3<br>
In contrast, when during the process, n-hexyllithium is used in combination with tri-wo-butylsilyl chloride at a temperature of -15°C and 0°C, the resulting product can generally, in accordance with prior art procedures discussed above, have a C5:C2-isomer ratio of 99.8:0.2. This can be a significant difference on a commercial scale.<br>
This selectivity at such relatively high temperatures is remarkable in view of suggestions in the literature that the silyl group is unsuitable as a blocking group, due to the 2- to 5-position migration of 2-(trialkyIsilyl)-substituted 5-lithio-l-methylimidazoles (G. Shapiro andM. Marzi, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 34, No. 21, pp 3401-3404,1993 ; G. Shapiro andB. Gomez-Lor, J. Organic Chemistry, Vol. 59, pp 5524-5526,1994).<br>
In more detail, the reaction may be conveniently effected by initially preparing a solution of 1-methylimidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, to which is added a portion of the C^galkyllithium compound in a solvent such as n-hexane. The silyl halide is then added to the resulting reaction mixture, and a further portion of the C^alkyllithium compound in a solvent such as ra-hexane is also added. The compound of formula (IX) in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran is then added to the reaction mixture, keeping the temperature between -78°C and 0°C.<br><br>
