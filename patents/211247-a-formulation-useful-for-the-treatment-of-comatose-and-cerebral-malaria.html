				<td>Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a formulation useful for the treatment of comatose and cerebral malaria . More particularly the present invention relates to novel synergistic formulation comprising α,ß-Arteether together with vegetable oil said formulation useful for the treatment of comatose and cerebral malarial . The formulation specifically useful for rectal route treatment of highly multi-drug resistant P. falciparum and P. vivax cases and which can be used for emergency treatment of comatose and cerebral malaria. The invention also provides methods of treatment of malaria affecting the brain employing the novel formulation. The invention also provides process for preparation of the said novel formulation. Background of invention :<br>
According to WHO P. falciparum malaria is becoming increasing resistant to chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and mefloquine (Eyles et al. 1963, Am. J. Torp. Med. Hyg. 12, 840-835; WHO Tech. Report Series No. 711, 1984; Boudreau et al. 1982 Lancet II, 1335; Nosten et al. 1991, Lancet 337, 1140-1143; Hurwitz et al. 1981, Lancet I, 1068-1070; Timmermanns et al. 1982. Lancet I. 1181).<br>
were resistant to artesunate, artemether and mefloquine combined therapy. Mefloquine was reported to produce neuropsychiatric side-effects in adults who developed tonic clonic fits.   Besides  psychosis,  delusions  and  hallucinations, anxiety sleep disturbances were also reported after mefloquine (Drugs 1990, 39, 160-169).<br>
Multi-drug-resistance in P. falciparum malaria and high level of P. vivax resistant strains are posing a major threat to countries in South-east Asia. Africa and Southern America.<br>
Most seriously affected areas include Thai-Myanmar Burmese border, where resistance to nearly all available drugs (Chlorquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, quinine) has already got established, (WHO Report on Infectious Diseases, 1999, WHO/CDS/99.1).<br>
lalofantrine is more effective but rather high doses of the drug are now required to<br><br>
control resistant P. falcipanim (Brasseur et al. 1993. Lancet 341, 901-2) which cold lead<br>
to increased risk of cardiotoxicity of this new antimalarial including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, tall peak T. waves, QT interval prolongation, ectopic beats (Karbwang et al. 1993, Lancet, 342, 501; Wildling et al. 1993. Lancet, 342, 55; Kremsner et al. Am. J Trop. Med. Hyg. 50, 790-795) which has imposed great limitation on the antimalarial potential of this drug. Several reports have recently appeared which document emergence of chloroquine resistance by P. vivax (Schwartz et al. 1991. New England J. Med. 324, 927, Schuurkamp et al. 1992. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 86, 121-2; Murphy et a/., 1993. Lancet, 341, 96-100; Garg et al. 1995. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 89, 656-7; Than et al. 1995. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 89, 307-8; Baird et aL, 1996. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 90, 409-410, Baird et al., Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 56, 627-631. The World Health Organization (1984) had accorded high priority to the development of fast acting artemisinin derivatives as blood schizontocides for the emergency treatment of cerebral malaria as well as for the control of multiple drug resistant cases ofPlasmodium falciparum.<br>
α,ß-arteether is an ethylether derivative of qinghaosu (artemisinine), which is extracted from Artemisia annua, a plant long known in traditional Chinese medicine for its antimalarial properties. d,p-Arteether (30:70) (intramuscular) is one of the artemisinin derivatives that has been developed in India and shows antimalarial activity against chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine resistant P. yoelii nigeriensis and cures experimental cerebral malaria infections (P. kno-wlesilP. fragile in rhesus monkey model). (Dutta etal. 1989. Pharmacol. Res. 21,415-19; Dutta and Tripathi, 1996, Japn. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 24, 65-69; Tripathi et al. 1997, Exp. Parasitol. 87, 290-292; Bajpai et al. 1989 Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 83, 484).<br>
o/p-Arteether is relatively safer and its LDso dose is 1250 mg/kg in Swiss mice as compared to artemether (LDso 263 mg/kg (im) and artesunate (LDso 475 mg/kg, im)(J. Trad. Chinese Med. 1982,2(1) 31-38). Clinical trials of intramuscular injection of this compound have been completed and marketed. Data on clinical trials with injectible preparation of α.ß arteether (30:70 mixtures of isomers amongst P. falciparum cases has<br>
been published (Mohapatra el al. 1996. Indian J. Med. Res. 104, 284-7; Valecha el al. 1997, Int. J. Clin. Pharm. Res. XVII (1) 11-15. Mohanty elal. 1997. Trans. R. Soc.'Trop. Med. Hyg. 91, 328-330; Mishra et al. 1995, Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 89, 299-301).<br>
Status of rectal suppositories of artemisinin derivatives:<br>
Several reports have been published which support the observation that rectal suppository preparations of artemisinin can exert antimalarial effect in reducing the P. falciparum parasitaemia in critically sick and and severe cases including cerebral complications (Li et al., Trans.R-Soc.Trop.Med.Hyg. 88(Suppl 1), 1994, 5-6; Arnold et al., Trans. R.Soc. Trop. Med.Hyg. 84, 1990, 499-502; Hien et al., Trans. R.Soc.Trop.Med. Hyg. 85, 1991, 202-211; Hien et al., Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 86, 1992, 582-583; Lie et al., J. Trad. Chinese Med. 5, 1985, 159-161; Cao et al., 1997, Trans.R.Soc.Trop.Med.Hyg. 91, 335-342). The suppository treatment was found satisfactory for parasite clearance and for fever clearance in patients. However, a very high dose of artemisinin (2800 mg in 48-56 h) is needed to be administered to produce complete parasite clearance. Besides the high dose of artemisinin administered may approach the toxicity level and there are frequent problems of recrudescence with this drug in children.<br>
Artesunate suppositories have also been used for control of severe P. falciparum cases. Although they produce fast parasite clearance and fever clearance, the recrudescence rate is high. Artesunate suppositories were given at a total dose of 1600 mg (in 8 doses) over 3 day course and in order to prevent recrudescence a long-acting antimalarial mefioquine (1250 mg) was administered to reduce recrudescence rate (92%) [Looareesuwan et al., Ann.Trop.Med.Parasitol. 89, 1995, 469-475; Looareesuwan et al., Jpn. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 24(suppl 1) 1996, 13-15]. Looareesuwan also administered 1600 mg artesunate suppository which was followed by mefioquine (1250 mg) which produced 96% cure rate and Bhatt et al., [Jpn. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 24(suppl. 1), 1996, 59-63] also used 1600 mg artesunate suppositories followed by 1000 mg mefioquine. In spite of double treatment 13.6% mortality was recorded (cure rate 86.4%). Gomez [Gomez Landires, Jpn. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 24 (suppl. 1) 1996, 16-24] employed 1400 mg artesunate suppository which was followed by 750 mg mefioquine. They [Thwe et al., Jpn. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 24 (suppl. 1) 1996, 25-32] administered 1200 mg artesunate suppositories (in 3 days)<br>
followed by 1250 mg , mefloquine for treatment of severe malaria and achieved a cure rate of 92.3%. Halpaap el al., (1998, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 58, 365-368) administered two 50 mg artesunate suppositories at 4 h interval in children followed by sulfadoxin/pyrimethamine, and Sabchareon el al., (1998) administered 200 mg artesunate suppository (x 3 days) followed by mefloquine (2 doses).<br>
Most of the trials recommend the administration of a second antimalarial like mefloquine or sulfadoxin/pyrimethamine with artesunate suppository. Wilairatana et al., (1997, Ann. J. Trop.Med. Parasitol 91, 891-896) also reported that artesunate suppository was usefial in reducing and clearing parasitaemia in severe P.falciparwn cases. Kyaw et al., (1996 Jpn. J. Trop.Med. Hyg. 24 suppl. 1, 55-58) compared the efficacy of artesunate suppositories (200 mg x 3 days) and artemether suppositories (200 mg x 3 days) and the cure rates among adult uncomplicated falciparum cases were 50 and 43.9% respectively.<br>

Novelty of the invention:<br>
The major advantage of the arteether rectal formulation will be to treat very serious cases/ comatose cases of cerebral malaria with a view to reduce mortality among P. falciparum cases particularly in children, pregnant women who are at maximum risk and can prove fatal unless the emergency therapy is instituted.<br>
A still another advantage of the rectal formulation of arteether will be to control multi-<br><br>
drug resistant infections due primarily to P. falciparum which because of problem of resistance can not be treated effectively or cured with conventional antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, mefloquine, amodiaquine, mepacrine, quinine, quinidine, halofantrin, pyrimethhamine, pyronaridine, WR238605 to which the parasite might be resistant, or with standard suppressive antimalarial antibiotics such as tetracycline, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin to which plasmodia may be resistant or with diverse antimalarial+antibiotic combination such as chloroquine, amodiquine/ mefloquine/ mepacrine/ quinine/ quinidine+tetracycline combinations or quinine/ quinidine+oxytetracycline combination, or quinine+ erythromycin or ciprofloxacin+chloroquine combination, or norfloxacin+chloroquine combination against which the P. falciparum infection is resistant.<br>
Another advantage of formulation will be to control chloroquine resistant P. vivax blood infections which are presently spreading in many continents could be effectively treated initially with rectal arteether formulation to prevent deterioration of the condition of the patient, and as soon as the patient is brought to the hospital arteether formulation can also be given parenterally as intramuscular (3 doses) curative treatment.<br>
AH cases of P. falciparum and P. vivax which need a life saving therapy/those in coma /serious complicated P.falcipamm infections/ life threatening malaria including children, infants can be administered rectal arteether formulations 2-4 times daily to revive the comatose cases and rectal therapy used as emergency treatment can be changed to parenteral (oral) therapy with same arteether formulation (prepared in neutralized oil) which allows rapid drug absorption from gut and can provide effective control of parasitaemia, by oral route.<br>
The advantages of these formulations as prepared by the process of the present invention are that they provide a highly effective, easy to use, non messy and non cumbersome rectal delivery system to control cerebral malaria and which can also be used to clear highly multi-resistant malaria infections.<br>
Rectal suppositories are simple to administer, easy to store at room temperature and administered, as it does not require any special equipment and can be given as emergency drug at rural health centers throughout the developing world. Suppository could be used in remote areas/villages incases who might not survive the long journey or delay in reporting to the hospital.<br>
The formulation (o/p-arteether and vehicle) is relatively safe as compared to other artemisinin derivatives (LDso in mice&gt;1250 mg/kg) and consequently the therapeutic index is more favorable for treatment of malaria.<br>
The neutralized refined oil thus prepared was superior to commercial refined oil because it was stable even during winter on the shelf and did not solidify during overnight very low temperature.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process of the preparation of formulation useful for treatment of malaria, which comprises mixing 5 to 15% by weight of arteether with 85 to 95% by weight of neutralized refined ground nut oil which can be put into soft gelatin capsule for rectal treatment, or taking material in syringe and giving rectal administration of drug through a nozzle or catheter or prepare into standard suppository by known methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, α/ß arteether used may be selected from the mixture in different proportions ranging from 10-30 of a- and 70-90 of P-isomers.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the formulation used may be mixed with known suppository formulations such as glycerols substituted glycol, alkyl alcohol and mixture thereof. The resulting composition (formulation and standard suppository materials) may be molded into desired shape and size. The composition can also be made into a suppository like glycrine suppository or can be put in a soft gelatin capsule or the final formulations can be administered deep into rectum through plastic nozzle or rubber catheter 2-4 times daily for several days to reduce the parasitaemia to eliminate infection.<br>
The following example broadly illustrate the nature of this invention the manner in which it is to be performed without limiting the nature and scope of the invention.<br>

(a) Neutralized oil: Refined ground nut oil was purchased-from commercial source locally. 100 ml oil was taken in separating funnel and to this 50 ml of sterile 5% sodium bicarbonate solution was added and was shaken for 10 min thoroughly to mix sodium bicarbonate with the oil. This solution was allowed to stand for 2 hrs, sodium bicarbonate layer was drawn out and fresh bicarbonate was added and process was repeated for 4 times to prepare neutralized oil. Last bicarbonate washing was continued for over night and after bicarbonate treatment, washing with sterilized deionized distilled water was started and likewise 4 washing of the treated oil were given with 50 ml distilled water. After the last washing, oil was filtered through double layered Whattman filter no. 3, the filtration process was continued over night and neutralized oil was collected. The neutralized oil thus obtained was passed through 2nd set of Whattman filter paper to obtain moisture free clear neutralized oil. The washed neutralized oil was put in sterilized flask and it was heated on hot plate to 140°C for 1 hr. The oil was aseptically dispensed in glass stopped bottle to avoid aeration/oxidation. This oil could be stored at room temperature on the shelf as light yellowish coloured liquid. This neutralized oil is used for preparation of rectal formulation.<br>
 (b)	Preparation/of rectal arteether formulation: Stock solution of the drug α/ß arteether<br>
(30:70) mixture of enantiomers a and P respectively, was prepared in neutralized refined<br>
ground nut oil. Arteether a and 3 were finally dissolved in neutralized ground nut oil to<br>
get the desired drug solution for administration. The mixture was heated to 70-90°C to<br>
dissolve the arteether and the final drug solution was filtered through 0.45 µmillipore<br>
filter. The arteether preparation is of light yellowish colour and is stable for over 3 years.<br>
For animal experiments various dose level of drug arteether can be made by dilution of<br>
the drug stock with neutralized oil vehicle. The arteether formulation can be used for<br>
preparing rectal formulation and can also be administered orally to achieve curative<br>
action.<br><br>
(c)	Method for the preparation of suppository: A mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG<br>
Mol. Wt. 1500), 350 mg, polyethylene glycol (Mol. Wt. 4000) 150 mg and hexane-l-ol (0.1 ml) was melted by heating on a water bath and 150 mg of ct/p-arteether in two ml of hexane was added to it with intimate mixing. The hexane was evaporated off by warming the mixture to 60°C and the mixture was allowed to cool to get solid mass which was molded into suppositories of oval shape and 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm size. It was then packed in a polyethylene lined blister type packing to avoid coming into contact with moisture before use. Besides other known suppository materials can be used to prepare the formulation. Biological activity:<br>
Examples:!<br>
Multi-drug resistant character of Plasmodium yoelli nieeriensis (MDR strain): Swiss mice weighing 20±1 to 25±1 g of either sex and random laboratory bred at Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow were used. Mice were routinely infected with 1x105 parasitized RBC intraperitoneally using sterile citrate saline as diluent for infected blood. The parasite suspension were inoculated in healthy mice by intraperitoneal route on day 0, and drugs were administered orally once a day for 4 doses (day 0 to day+ 3). From day 4 onwards, tail blood smears were examined after Giemsa staining and percent parasitaemia and mortality was recorded. The parasite (MDR strain) was lethal for Swiss<br>
mice and mice died in 6-8 days after developing parasitaemia above 40% to 100% infection of RBC. Mortality was 100% in mice.<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example 2 Rectal formulation of α/ß arteether:<br>
α,ß-Arteether mixture dissolved in neutralized ground-nut oil was administered to P. yoelli nigeriensis (MDRII) infected mice at 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg dose from day 0 to day 2 (for 3 consecutive days) by intra-rectal route. Drug was administered with 0.05-0.25 ml oil (vehicle) in single dose or in 2 divided dose daily. Parasitaemia was recorded daily from tail blood smears stained with Giemsa stain and results are given as % parasitaemia (means±SD). All the doses of arteether namely 10.0, 15.0 and 20.0 mg/kg suppressed the parasitaemia even after treatment (upto 5 days) as shown by blood smear examination. The study shows that till day 5, the control mice had developed very high level of parasitaemia (57.6124.7) and had starting dying whereas the groups of mice administered 15-20 mg/kg α,ß-arteether formulation by rectal route treatment were fully protected as shown by negative parasitaemia. The study shows fairly rapid drug absorption of this formulation by rectal route which was effective in initially controlling multi-drug resistant (II) P. yoelli nigeriensis infection in mice. Presumptive arteether rectal formulation or suppository administration can save mortality in severe/complicated cases, ce/p Arteether rectal route controls the severity of infection and prevents mortality in severe complicated comatose malaria cases and will be specially useful in infants, children and those having frequent vomiting and can not be given oral formulation initially. Rectal formulation can easily control highly multi drug resistant malaria infections which do not respond to drugs like chloroquine, amodiaquine, mepacrine, mefloquine, halofantrine, quinine, quinidine, pyrimethamine +sulfadoxin etc. in MDR areas. Rectal route α/ß arteether formulation remains 1st line of emergency treatment of comatose P. falciparum cases in areas of MDR.<br>

Example 3<br>
Oral use of formulation.<br>
3 a). Blood schizonticidal activity of orally administered arteether formulationprepared in DMSO-distilled water against MDRII P. yoelii nigeriensis infection in Swiss mice (25 ± 1 g)<br>
Swiss mice 25 ± 1 gm infected intraperitoneally with Ixl07 parasitized rbcs were administered α/ß formulation, prepared in DMSO (3-4 drop) and then suspended in distilled water by oral administration at various doses ranging between 40-100 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days.<br>
Parasitaemia was recorded periodically from tail blood smears upto 28 days of observation. Both 60 and 80 mg/kg x 5 doses were able to eliminate the parasitaemia upto 28 days of observation and were curative. The 40 mg/kg dose provided transient suppression of parasitaemia, but was not curative against MDR strain. A very high dose is required for curative action against MDR infection and its bioavailability by oral route as suspension in D.W. is low.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Curative dose = 60 mg/kg x 5 doses<br>
3b).     Oral administration of arteether formulation (in oil);<br>
Efficacy of oral administration of arteether formulation for control of blood induced multi-drug resistant P. yoelii nigeriensis (MDR II) in Swiss mice (25±1 g) was evaluated. The mice was infected intraperitoneally with Ixl05 parasitized RBC, and drug treatment 10,15,20 and 30 mg/kg was given once daily for five consecutive days (starting from day 0 to day 4). Blood smears made from tail blood and stained with giemsa were examined periodically till 28 days of infection to record parasitaemia levels and number of surviving/cured mice till 28 days. The results set in table show that the arteether formulation (in neutralized refined ground nut oil) was curative (8/8) in 5 day treatment schedule at 30 mg/kg dose schedule. Both 15 and 20 mg/kg doses cleared the parasitaemia for 6-7 day but there was recrudescence later even though 4-5 mice out of 8 mice (treated in group) showed complete parasite clearance by day 28. Data show adequate drug absorption after oral use of the formulation in neutralized oil and ultimate<br>
control of highly multi drug resistant malaria infection (P. yoelii nigeriensis MDR II) was achieved. 'As discussed above the bioavailability of oral arteether α/ß (powder) prepared into dosage form in DMSO and distilled water is of lower order and a dose of 60 mg/kg x 5 days is needed for multi-drug resistant P. yoelii nigeriensis (MDRII) total clearance, whereas oral arteether (α/ß) formulation in neutralized refined ground nut oil is much more effective and 50% drug dose (30 mg/kg x 5) is effective in 100% parasite clearance. Thus formulation in oil is superior for treatment of malaria.<br>

Example 4<br>
4. Transmission blocking activity of a/0 arteether formulation in clinical malaria case (P. falciparum):<br>
P. falcipantm clinical cases (no=8) which were ganetocyte carriers were administered arteether formulation parenterally (intramuscular) at 150 mg dose (in neutralized ground nut oil) x 3 days for treatment of malaria, and within 48 h both asexual parasitaemia and gametocytes were completely cleared from the blood stream. Out of 8 cases, 7 cases were<br>
cleared of gametocytes within 24 h of treatment while in the 8th case gametocytes were cleared by 48 h/ The study shows strong gametocytocidal action of arteether formulation. All cases remained parasite free upto 28 days observation and drug cure rate was 100 percent. For control and total clearance of asexual parasites arteether 150 mg/kg x 3 days treatment is necessary but to achieve gametocyte clearance even one dose (150 mg/kg/60 kg adult) may be given once a week or maximum twice a week to knock out P. falciparum gametocytes.<br>
