				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The  invention  relates to a greenhouse  structure  for<br>
efficient  production  of  vegetables  during   sub-zero<br>
tempertures (upto-20O C)<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
India has wide range of climatic conditions. which differ from each other in one or the other aspects. In the high altitude, cold arid climatic conditions of I adakh. nothing grows in the open during the winters (Oct-Apr ) .<br>
Greenhouse effect is being used since long in many places to grow various plants/crops under controlled environmental conditions by using electricity, in Ladakh production of hydropower is not easy in winters due to freezing of most of the water sources. The use of diesel generated electricity is also not economical. As such, there was a requirement of designing a suitable solar-based—greenhouse for economic production of vegetables, especially during winters in sub—zero temperatures (upto-20°C) .<br>
The semi underground greenhouse structure called POL YENCH' maintains adequate temper ature ft moisture for<br>
growing of various types of plants, which is NOT feasible in the open, durinq winters. It has been<br>
observed   that   during  peak   winter,   the   minimum<br>
temperature   goes  only  upto  +2O C  in   polyench   in<br>
comparison  with the other greenhouses like  the  normal<br>
trench,  where it reaches upto -2O C to -3O C. in  ladakhi<br>
uolyhouse  it  reaches  upto about —4O C  and  in  normal<br><br>
polynouses  it reaches upto -10O C durinq peak winters  (—<br><br>
20o C).  In  other types of greenhouses,  the  successful<br>
cultivation  of  veqetables is possible, only  when  the<br>
outside temperatures i= up to about -6O C, due to limited<br>
absorption   of  solar  radiation.  However   the   semi underqround  greenhouse.  designed  by  Field   Research Laboratory,  Leh,  absorbs  a large  quantity  of  solar radiation  due  to its design. In  this  structure,  the earth also absorbs greater heat durinq the day, which is emitted  at  niqht.  This creates  a  favourable  micro climate in the structure for obtaining optimum growth of<br>
plants  in  early  and late  winters  (upto  -12O C)  and<br>
reasonable growth during peak winters (upto -20O C).<br>
This design is totally new and is based on the experiments conducted at the Field Research Laboratory, Leh of DRDO. There is no such desiqrt available for<br>
efficient  production of veqetables durinq peak  winters<br>
(upto -20O C) in liqh altitude cold arid climates.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main ubiect of the present invention is to propose a<br>
greenhouse   structure  for  protected  cultivation   of<br>
veqetables  in  cold  arid  climates  (upto  —20O C)   at<br>
reasonable cost.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose  a greenhouse   structure  for  veqetable  cultivation   in<br>
summers.<br><br>
Further object of the present design is to propose a greenhouse structure to produce efficiently certain rare vegetables and flowers for high altitude arid climates.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a solar based semi -umderground greenhouse structure for production of vegetables in sub—zero temperatures, comprising s <br>
(a) a trench with longitudinal orientation of the front and rear walls disposed from east to west,<br>
(b)   a rear wall extending upwardly from the trench,<br>
(c)    two side walls inclined downwardly from the  rear to the front wall,<br>
(d) a slanting polysheet forming the cover of said trench,<br>
(e)   and a sma11 door .<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated with the following example, which is intended to be a typical of<br>
rather than in any way limiting on the scope of the present invention.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing and wherein<br>
Fiq.1 shows the structure of the present invention.<br>
The  solar  based  semi—under ground  greenhouse  1   for vegetable  production  in sub-zero  temperatures  has  a construction  takinq  into  consideration  the   natural phenomenon of greenhouse effect, insulating property  of mud  brick walls and emission of absorbed solar' heat  by soil heneath during night. It comprises a trench 2,  for example,  9  m x 3 m in plan and dug to a depth  of  for example  0.8  m.  The trench comprises a  front  wall  3 disposed  below  the  ground level GL,  a  rear  wall  4 extending  upwardly from the ground level GL „  and  side walls  5 inclined downwardly from rear wall 4  to  front wall  3. The orientation is such that longitudinally  it runs  east to west, A stone masonary wall is erected  on the  the rear wall 4 from excavated level to the  ground level  (GL) over foundation. Over this wall,  above  EL, mud brick masonary wall is erected upto a height of  for example 1 m. Similarly, front wall 3 is raised from  the excavated  level to the GL in stone masonary. Rear  wall (higher  wall)  is raised on northern side  and  shorter wall on southern side. Similarly, side walls 5 are  also erected.<br>
The top of the side wall slopes from top of rear wall to the top of front wall supports 6 such as GL pipes or<br>
wooden ballies are laid in slopes supported on top of front and rear walls. These GI pipes/ballies work as<br>
support for polysheet 7 which rests in slope over this trench.<br>
A wooden door such as 1.2 m hiqlt x. 0.8 in wide is provided on western corner of rear wall. Two ventilators (380 mm x 200 mm) are provided on two side walls. An exhaust fan working on solar energy, is provided on<br>
eastern side wall. A pipe (GI/PVC/Rubber). is provided on ground through any one wall for irriqation of this structure.<br>
It is to be understood that the above description of the design of the structure is susceptible to considerable modifications, change and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such modifications are intended to be considered within the scope of the present invention which is set forth by the following claims:—<br><br><br><br>
