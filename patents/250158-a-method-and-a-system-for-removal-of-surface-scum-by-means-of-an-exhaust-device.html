				<td>Method and arrangement for removal of surface scum<br>
The invention relates to a method for removal of surface<br>
scum in an apparatus, which comprises at least a first<br>
surface chute arrangement that exists in a liquid basin<br>
and which is meant for removal of surface scum.<br>
A traditional solution in the purpose described above<br>
and particularly in square shaped basins is such, that<br>
the fluid processing apparatus, such as a clarification<br>
basin or like, comprises usually a special kind of a<br>
scraper bar arrangement, which has several scraper bars,<br>
existing one after the other in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the basin, and movement means for moving<br>
the same, such as two chains, being placed parallelly<br>
and being driven by means of a drive wheel and idle wheel<br>
assembly, in connection with which the scraper bars are<br>
fastened removeably particularly in order to make easier<br>
the service and maintenance of the scraper bar<br>
arrangement. The type of scraper bar arrangements<br>
mentioned above are nowadays being used e.g. in<br>
connection with clarification basins in a way that the<br>
scraper bar/bars is/are transferred by chains, moving<br>
at opposite side or intermediate walls of the basin,<br>
alternatively on the surface and at the bottom of the<br>
basin, scraping sludge existing at the bottom to a sludge<br>
pocket while passing along the bottom, and, respectively<br>
guiding material existing on the surface to a collecting<br>
chute, which goes crosswise through the basin, while<br>
passing on the surface. There are also scraper bar<br>
arrangements, in which the bars are being moved e.g.<br>
by means of a carriage, moving above the basin, or e.g.<br>
by hydraulic arrangements. Also the shape of the basin<br>
may be in practice almost of whatever form.<br>
In this connection, the surface scum is traditionally<br>
exhausted in a so to speak indirect manner, whereby the<br>
scrapers while passing on the surface, guide the<br>
material on the surface towards the collecting chute<br>
in a so called free-drifting manner. The collecting<br>
chutes, being used in this connection, are usually<br>
mechanically operated "suction chutes", which are being<br>
rotated from time to time around a longitudinal axis<br>
to a position, in which the surface scum is being "gulped"<br>
inside the same in order to lead it subsquently away<br>
from the liquid basin. On the other hand, in this<br>
connection a suction chute is used also, which has a<br>
moveable front wall, the operating principle of which<br>
is, however, in practice the same as described above.<br>
A problem related to this kind of suction chutes is the<br>
fact that they take along too much surface water, which<br>
can thus drift along with the surface scum furthermore<br>
to the exhaustion channel of the surface scum. Also the<br>
bearing of such rotating suction structures to the walls<br>
of the basin is very difficult to carry out structurally,<br>
which is why among other things leaks are caused. In<br>
addition to the above, the suction chutes easily tend<br>
to get jammed among other things due to temperature<br>
differencies. The type of mechanically operated chute<br>
arrangements described above require naturally also<br>
operating devices and automation in order to move the<br>
chutes, which is why this kind of implementations<br>
require a very dense service and maintenance in order<br>
to keep them operable. Furthermore, a problem in<br>
practice related to this kind of solutions is due to<br>
exessive surface scum that gets collected on the surface<br>
of the liquid basin, together with which also other<br>
impurities may get collected. It is thus very usual that<br>
also organic processes may take place in the surface<br>
scum among other things in the form of algal growth.<br>
It is the aim of the method according to the present<br>
invention to achieve a decisive improvement in the<br>
problems described above and thus to raise essentially<br>
the level of prior art. In order to carry out this aim,<br>
the method according to the invention is mainly<br>
characterized by that the surface scum is being<br>
exhausted by means of an overflow arrangement, belonging<br>
to the first surface chute arrangement and being based<br>
on a continuous flow, by means of which the surface scum<br>
is being overflown in at least two successive phases.<br>
It should be noted in this context that the surface water<br>
bringing the surface scum to the chute is just the same<br>
water, which is being moved to the overflow chutes, being<br>
placed after the suction chute, or to exhaust pipes,<br>
existing underneath the surface.<br>
As the most important advantage of the method according<br>
to the invention is first of all the fact that by means<br>
of an overflow arrangement, being based on a continuous<br>
flow with two phases, it is possible to eliminate all<br>
the problems related to moveable arrangements or<br>
corresponding mechanically operated exhaustion chutes,<br>
the most important thing thus being the possibility to<br>
minimize the amount of the surface water drifting along<br>
with the surface scum. In addition to the above, the<br>
area from which the surface scum is being removed can<br>
be adjusted by controlling the height of the primary<br>
space, belonging to the overflow arrangement, with<br>
respect to an overflow edge in the secondary space. This<br>
is enabled by using a flow balancing assembly, which<br>
comprises one or more pipes, channels or\like, being<br>
connected to the arrangement removing clarified liquid<br>
from the primary space, and adjusting means for<br>
adjustment of the level of the liquid in the primary<br>
space. Furthermore the method according to the invention<br>
may be utilized also by an arrangement, which is totally<br>
independent on the level of the liquid basin, by enabling<br>
the overflow arrangement to settle freely in the<br>
direction of height along the level of the liquid basin<br>
e.g. by using floating arrangements.<br>
In the dependent claims related to the method according<br>
to the invention advantageous embodiments of the method<br>
according to the invention have been presented.<br>
The invention relates also to an arrangement for removal<br>
of surface scum operating according to the method, which<br>
has been defined in greater detail in the preamble of<br>
the independent claim related to the same. The<br>
arrangement according to the invention is for its part<br>
characterized by what has been presented in the<br>
characterizing part of the independent claim related<br>
to the same.<br>
As the most important advantages of the arrangement<br>
according to the invention may be mentioned simplicity<br>
and efficiency of its operating principle and use,<br>
whereby thanks to the same it is furthermore possible<br>
to avoid also the problems involved with traditional<br>
mechanical solutions. In spite of a continuous flow<br>
being exploited in the arrangement, with it it is also<br>
possible to eliminate removal of excessive liquid along<br>
with the surface scum. This is made possible first of<br>
all by means of an overflow arrangement, based on a two<br>
staged overflow, which comprises a primary space and<br>
a secondary space. On the other hand the final removal<br>
of the surface scum from the secondary space may be<br>
furthermore carried out in a totally controlled manner<br>
by exploiting a flow balancing assembly, by means of<br>
which the overflow of the surface scum from the primary<br>
space to the secondary space is being controlled in order<br>
to minimize the amount of liquid drifting along with<br>
the surface scum. In this way, it is possible to adjust<br>
the level of the primary space as desired e.g. by<br>
changing the discharge height of the flow pipe belonging<br>
to the flow balancing arrangement or by using a turnable<br>
flap structure in connection with an intermediate wall,<br>
separating the primary space and the secondary space<br>
from each other.<br>
Thanks to the arrangement according to the invention,<br>
it is thus possible to minimize significantly the<br>
installation, service and maintenance measures related<br>
to traditional solutions, the arrangement operating<br>
independently and optimally in a way that excessive<br>
surface scum may not get collected in the liquid basin.<br>
On the other hand, thanks to the operating principle<br>
based on a continuous flow, the surface scum is also<br>
continuously on the run, which is why it may not become<br>
solid. Also formation e.g. of algal growth therewith<br>
is prevented.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the arrangement according<br>
to the invention have been represented in the dependent<br>
claims related to the same.<br>
In the following description the invention is being<br>
depicted in greater detail with reference to the<br>
appended drawings, in which<br>
in figures 1, 2 and 3<br>
is shown as a perspective view, a side view<br>
and an end view one advantageous arrangement<br>
operating according to the method according<br>
to the invention,<br>
in figures 4, 5 and 6<br>
is shown as a perspective view, a side view<br>
and a front view one alternative embodiment<br>
in respect to the one mentioned above, and<br>
in figure 7<br>
is shown furthermore a longitudinal cross-<br>
section of a particularly advantageous<br>
integral overflow arrangement.<br>
The invention relates to a method for removal of surface<br>
scum in an apparatus, which comprises at least a first<br>
surface chute arrangement 2a that exists in a liquid<br>
basin N and which is meant for removal of surface scum.<br>
Surface scum is being exhausted by means of an overflow<br>
arrangement 2al, belonging to the first surface chute<br>
arrangement 2a and being based on a continuous flow,<br>
by means of which the surface scum is being overflown<br>
in at least two successive phases on the principle shown<br>
e.g. in figures 1, 4 and 7.<br>
Especially with reference to figures 4-6 the apparatus<br>
comprises furthermore a scraper bar arrangement 1 that<br>
moves in the liquid basin, such as a settling tank or<br>
like, and that is meant for scraping of material existing<br>
in the liquid basin to an exhaust arrangement 2, existing<br>
in connection with the liquid basin and comprising in<br>
addition to the first surface chute arrangement 2a,<br>
existing essentially in a crosswise direction with<br>
respect to the longitudinal direction s of the liquid<br>
basin, a bottom chute arrangement, existing at the<br>
bottom of the liquid basin and that is meant for removal<br>
of bottom sludge, and furthermore a second surface chute<br>
arrangement 2c for removal of liquid, being processed<br>
in the liquid basin, such as clarified water. As an<br>
advantageous embodiment the scraper bar arrangement 1<br>
consists of one or more scraper bars la, existing one<br>
after the other in the longitudinal direction s and being<br>
adapted moveable by means of drive elements lb, such<br>
as one or more transmission chains 1b2 or the like, being<br>
driven through the intermediary of a drive wheel and<br>
idle wheel arrangement 1b1 or in a like fashion, in<br>
connection with which the scraper bar/bars la is/are<br>
being fastened. With reference e.g. to figures 1 and<br>
4, the surface scum is being exhausted by means of the<br>
overflow arrangement 2al in a way, that the scum on the<br>
surface of the liquid basin is being overflown from the<br>
liquid basin N in a first phase by means of a downwardly<br>
sloping guide surface V to a primary space I, from which<br>
the surface scum is being overflown subsequently in a<br>
following phase to a primary space II, from which it<br>
is being exhausted finally from the liquid basin N by<br>
means of an exhaust assembly P for the surface scum,<br>
such as by one or more exhaust pipes, channels or like.<br>
The meaning of the downwardly sloping guide surface is<br>
to keep the flow of the surface scum, taking place along<br>
the same, as laminar as possible, so that it will remain<br>
on the surface in the primary space I.<br>
As a further advantageous embodiment, the overflow of<br>
surface scum from the primary space I to the secondary<br>
space II is being controlled particularly in order to<br>
minimize the amount of water drifting together therewith<br>
by means of a flow balancing assembly 2a2, which<br>
comprises one or more flow pipes 2a2a, channels 2a2a'<br>
or like, being connected to the arrangement removing<br>
clarified liquid from the primary space I, such as the<br>
second surface chute arrangement 2c, and adjusting means<br>
2a2b for adjustment of the level h1 of the liquid in<br>
the primary space I by means of an adjusting device LL<br>
existing in the wall defining the primary space I and<br>
the secondary space II or by an adjusting sleeve,<br>
existing at the end of said flow pipe, channel or like,<br>
which alters the discharge height hv of said flow pipe,<br>
channel or like. In this way it is possible to discharge<br>
surface liquid drifted from the liquid vessel directly<br>
to the arrangement removing clarified liquid.<br>
The invention relates also to an arrangement for removal<br>
of surface scum in an apparatus of the type described<br>
above, the first surface chute arrangement 2a of which<br>
comprises an overflow arrangement 2al, being based on<br>
a continuous flow for exhaustion of surface scum so that<br>
it is being overflown in at least two successive phases.<br>
Especially with the advantageous embodiments shown in<br>
figures 1, 4 and 7, the overflow arrangement 2al<br>
comprises a primary space I provided with a downwardly<br>
sloping guide surface V in order to get the scum on the<br>
surface of the liquid basin to get overflown in a first<br>
phase and a secondary space II in order to exhaust<br>
surface scum, being overflown in a second phase from<br>
the primary space I, finally from the liquid basin N<br>
by means of an exhaust assembly P for the surface scum,<br>
such as by one or more exhaust pipes, channels or like.<br>
Furthermore as an advantageous embodiment, the<br>
arrangement comprises a flow balancing assembly 2a2 in<br>
order to control the overflow of the surface scum from<br>
the primary space I to the secondary space II<br>
particularly in order to minimize the amount of water<br>
drifting together therewith, which e.g. according to<br>
figures 2, 5 and 7 comprises one or more flow pipes 2a2a<br>
channels 2a2a' or like, being connected to the<br>
arrangement removing clarified liquid from the primary<br>
space I, such as the second surface chute arrangement<br>
2c, and adjusting means 2a2b for adjustment of the height<br>
h1 of the level of the liquid in the primary space I<br>
by means of an adjusting device LL existing in the wall<br>
defining the primary space I and the secondary space<br>
II or by an adjusting sleeve, existing at the end of<br>
said flow pipe, channel or like, which alters the<br>
discharge height hv of said flow pipe, channel or like.<br>
In this context it is also possible to use e.g. according<br>
to figure 2, filtering arrangements ss e.g. in the flow<br>
pipe 2a2a, by means of which entering of solid material<br>
to a so a called clear water side can be eliminated.<br>
In the advantageous embodiment shown particularly in<br>
figure 7, the primary space I, the secondary space II,<br>
the flow balancing assembly 2a2 and at least a part of<br>
the second surface chute arrangement 2c, all belonging<br>
to its overflow arrangement 2al, are arranged as an<br>
integral entirety, in which the primary space I, the<br>
secondary space II, said part of the second surface chute<br>
arrangement 2c and the flow channel 2a2a', belonging<br>
to the flow balancing assembly, all being placed one<br>
after the other in the longitudinal direction s, are<br>
limited from each other by mutual walls w.<br>
Furthermore as an advantageous embodiment with<br>
reference to the embodiment shown in figures 1-3, the<br>
secondary space II is placed, when viewed in the<br>
longitudinal direction s of the liquid basin,<br>
transversely after the primary space I, so that it<br>
descends e.g. as shown in figures 1 and 3 towards the<br>
exhaust assembly P of the surface scum, when viewed in<br>
the crosswise direction of the liquid basin.<br>
As an alternative solution with respect to the above,<br>
with reference to the embodiment shown in figures 4-6,<br>
the secondary space II is placed e.g. according to figure<br>
6 at the end of the primary space I, when viewed in the<br>
crosswise direction of the liquid basin.<br>
Furthermore as an advantageous embodiment, the overflow<br>
arrangement 2al for surface scum is arranged e.g. on<br>
the principle shown in figures 1,2, 4 and 5 to settle<br>
freely in a direction of height h along with the surface<br>
of the liquid basin by using floating structures KR or<br>
like.<br>
Deviating from the embodiments shown in the appended<br>
drawings, it is naturally possible to couple a flow pipe<br>
2a2a, channel 2a2a' or like, belonging to the flow<br>
balancing assembly 2a2, with a collecting<br>
channel/tunnel or like that removes clarified liquid<br>
from the liquid basin in a centralized manner.<br>
It is clear that the invention is not limited to the<br>
embodiments presented or described above, but it can<br>
be modified within the basic idea of the invention in<br>
very many ways depending on the needs of any given time.<br>
Thus, the invention also relates at its widest to basins,<br>
which do not necessarily have any kind of a scraper bar<br>
arrangement and/or, in which the surface scum is being<br>
transferred by whatever arrangement toward the suction<br>
chute. There exists naturally a large amount of<br>
different kinds of scraper bar structures, in addition<br>
to which it is possible to use in connection with the<br>
same e.g. filling materials, e.g. based on polyurethane<br>
or like etc. Furthermore for the part of the overflow<br>
arrangement, it is possible to carry out the downwardly<br>
sloping guide surface by straight surfaces, getting<br>
deeper periodically, or e.g. by a continuously arched<br>
surface, which may be either convex or concave. In<br>
connection with the counterpart surface it is<br>
furthermore possible to use certain kinds of flow<br>
guidance arrangements, such as e.g. a perforated or<br>
grooved guide plate, by means of which the surface scum<br>
is being steered tangentially on the surface of the<br>
primary space. The surface scum may be removed from the<br>
secondary space also by means of e.g. a pump or by a<br>
separate scavenging or whatever way, in case it is<br>
required due to the quality or amount of the surface<br>
scum.<br>

arranged at least one end of the primary space (I), when viewed in a<br>
crosswise direction of the liquid basin (N).<br>
7. The system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the overflow arrangement (2a1)<br>
is arranged to settle freely in a direction of height (h1) along with the<br>
surface (V)of the liquid basin (N) by using floating structures (KR).<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a method for removal of surface scum by means of<br>
an exhaust device (2) that exists in connection with a liquid basin<br>
(N), such as a settling tank, the exhaust arrangement comprising a first<br>
surface chute (2a), existing essentially in a crosswise direction with respect to<br>
a longitudinal direction (s) of the liquid basin, for removal of surface scum by<br>
means of an overflow means (2al), belonging to the liquid basin and being<br>
based on a continuous flow, by means of which the surface scum is being<br>
overflown in at least two successive phases, in the first phase from the fluid<br>
basin into a primary space (I) existing in the fluid basin, and in a second<br>
phase into a secondary space (II) from the primary space (I) situated further<br>
ahead in the fluid basin, from where it is being finally exhausted from the<br>
liquid basin by means of an exhaust assembly (P) for the surface scum, such<br>
as by one or more exhaust pipes, or channels, and a second surface chute<br>
(2c) for removal of liquid, being processed in the liquid basin, such as<br>
clarified water. Overflow of the surface scum existing in the primary space<br>
(I), to the secondary space (II) is being controlled particularly in order to<br>
minimize the amount of water drifting together therewith by adjusting the<br>
level (h1) of the liquid in the primary space (I) by means of a flow balancing<br>
assembly (2a2), connecting the primary space (I) and the second surface<br>
chute (2c), and/or by using an adjusting device (LL) existing in the wall<br>
defining the primary space (I) and the secondary space (II), and in that the<br>
scum on the surface of the liquid basin (N) is overflown to the primary space<br>
(I) by means of a downwardly slopping guide surface (V) to maintain a<br>
laminar flow of the surface scum.<br></td>
