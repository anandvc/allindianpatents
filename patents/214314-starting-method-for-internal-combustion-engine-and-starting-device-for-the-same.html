"STARTING   METHOD   FOR   INTERNAL   COMBUSTION   ENGINE   AND STARTING DEVICE FOR THE SAME"<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention] The present invention relates to a starting, device for<br>
an internal combustion engine provided with a crankshaft to<br>
. \   \\ be rotated by an electric motor at startup, comprising an<br>
electric motor, and a decompression mechanism for opening an engine valve that is opened and closed by a valve train cam-provided on a camshaft to be rotated synchronously with rotation of the crankshaft and which is lifted by a prescribed amount to reduce the compressing pressure during the compressing stroke of the internal combustion engine, and to a method for starting the internal combustion engine provided with this starting device. <br>
[0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
The internal combustion engine having a crankshaft to be rotated by a starter motor at the startup is well known. The internal combustion engine having a decompression mechanism for opening the engine valve to be opened and closed by the valve train cam provided on the camshaft that is rotated synchronously with rotation of the crankshaft is also known.<br>
2 <br>
For example, in Japan 70366/1994, a decompression unit having a decompression cam and a reversing decompression cam supported on the camshaft via a one-way clutch is disclosed. In the case where a piston in the compression stroke is slightly moved backward by the compressing pressure when the internal combustion engine is stopped and thus the camshaft rotates in the reverse direction, the reversing decompression cam rotates integrally with the camshaft by action of the one-way clutch and opens an exhaust valve to decrease the compressing pressure in a combustion chamber at the next startup of the engine. When reverse rotation of the camshaft does not occur when the internal combustion engine is stopped (for example, when the piston is in the expansion stroke) , the decompression cam opens the exhaust valve during the compression stroke after the next startup timing to reduce the compressing pressure in the combustion  chamber.    With  such  decompression  unit, decompression operation for reducing the compressing pressure is performed only in the first compression stroke after startup in any cases. <br>
  [0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the decompression unit of the related art, when<br>
starting the internal combustion engine, the camshaft starts<br>
to rotate in the normal direction from the position where it<br>
stopped previously, and the crank angle from the position when<br>
3<br><br>
the crankshaft starts to rotate in the normal direction to the point where the first compression stroke starts after stoppage of decompression operation (compression bottom dead center) (hereinafter referred to as "run-up angle") is determined by the position where the camshaft stops when the internal combustion engine is stopped. Therefore, depending On the stopped positions, there may be a case that a sufficient run-up angle cannot be secured, and thus the revolving speed (angular speed) of the crankshaft is not sufficient for the piston to get over the first compression top dead center after cease of decompression operation, thereby hindering smooth start. Such a circumstance tends to occur especially when the sliding friction of the internal combustion engine is large, for example, in case of low temperature start or the like. Therefore, in order to ensure that the piston can get over the first compression top dead center, in the case where the starter motor is used for starting the internal combustion engine, the generated driving torque must be increased, and thus the starter motor may have to be disadvantageously upsized. In addition, with the decompression unit in the related art, it is difficult to increase the run-up angle significantly because the decompression operation is performed only during the first compression stroke after startup. [0004] <br>
With such circumstances in view, the present invention<br>
4<br><br>
provides a starting method for an internal combustion engine in which the run-up angle is increased so that the piston can easily get over the first compression top dead center after stoppage of decompression operation at startup without upsizing the electric motor for rotating the crankshaft, and the starting device for the same. <br>
[0005] [Means for Solving the Problems and Effects of the Invention] The invention according to Claim 1 is a starting method for an internal combustion engine comprising the steps of rotating a crankshaft by an electric motor at startup, and opening by a decompression mechanism an engine valve to be opened and closed by a valve train cam provided on a camshaft that is rotated synchronously with rotation of a crankshaft, characterized in that the decompression mechanism comprises a decompression cam provided on the camshaft, in that the decompression cam is capable of rotating in the rotational range of the camshaft between the first stop position of the camshaft in the reverse rotational direction and the second stop position of the camshaft in the normal rotational direction and has a cam profile to bring the engine valve into the opened state at the first stop position and into the closed state at the second stop position, and in that the method further comprises the steps of rotating the crankshaft in the reverse direction by the electric motor to rotate the<br>
 6<br><br>
decompression cam in the reverse direction and placing the same in the first stop position at startup, rotating subsequently the crankshaft in the normal direction by the electric motor to rotate the decompression cam in the normal direction, and opening the engine valve by the decompression cam during either the compression stroke included within the range of the prescribed crank angle by which the crankshaft is rotated by the electric motor in the reverse direction or the first compression stroke after normal rotation of the decompression cam during the time period until the decompression cam reaches the second stop position.<br>
[0006]<br>
According to the invention as stated in Claim 1, the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction by a prescribed crank angle by the electric motor and thus the decompression cam is rotated in the reverse direction and then in the normal direction at startup, so that when the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction, the engine valve is opened by rotating the decompression cam in the reverse direction and placing the same at the first stop position, and the decompression cam is rotated in the normal direction after the crankshaft starts to rotate in the normal direction.  Then, decompression operation is performed during the compression stroke either the compression stroke included in the range of the prescribed crank angle by which the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse<br>
7 <br>
direction or the first compression stroke after normal rotation of the decompression cam during the time period until the decompression cam reaches the second stop position. [0007]<br>
As a consequence, the following effects are obtained. The run-up angle increases by the extent of the prescribed crank angle by which the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction from the rotational position of the crankshaft at startup of the internal combustion engine, and thus the revolving speed of the crankshaft at the first point of start of compression after stoppage of decompression operation increases, the piston can easily get over the first compression top dead center after stoppage of decompression operation, and thus the starting capability is improved without upsizing the electric motor that rotates the crankshaft.  In addition, since the engine valve can be opened always at a certain position of the decompression cam when the crankshaft rotates in the normal direction by positioning the decompression cam at the first stop position when the crankshaft rotates in the reverse direction irrespective of the rotational position of the crankshaft at startup of the internal combustion engine, the angular range in which the engine valve can be opened by the decompression cam can be set to a certain range at each startup, thereby ensuring larger run-up angle than the related art.<br>
7<br><br>
[0008]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is a starting method for an internal combustion engine comprising' the steps of rotating the crankshaft by the electric motor at startup, and opening by a decompression mebhanism the engine valve to be opened and closed by the valve train cam provided on the camshaft that is rotated synchronously with rotation of the crankshaft, the decompression mechanism characterized in that a decompression cam is provided on the camshaft and is capable of rotating in the rotational range of the camshaft between the first stop position of the camshaft in the reverse rotational rotation and the second stop position of the camshaft in the normal rotational direction and has a cam profile to bring the engine valve into the opened state at the first stop position and into ;the closed state at the second stop position, and in that the method further comprises the steps of rotating the crankshaft in the reverse direction by the electric motor to rotate the decompression cam in the reverse direction and placing the same in the first stop position at startup, rotating subsequently the crankshaft by the electric motor in the normal direction to rotate the decompression cam in the normal direction, and opening the engine valve by the decompression cam during a plurality of compression strokes during the period until the decompression cam reaches the second stop position.<br>
8<br><br>
[0009]<br>
According to the invention as stated in Claim 2, the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction by a prescribed crank angle by the electric motor and thus the decompression cam is rotated in the reverse direction and then in the normal direction at startup, so that when the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction, the engine valve is opened by the decompression cam by rotating the decompression cam in the reverse direction and placing the same at the first stop position, and the decompression cam is rotated in the normal direction after the crankshaft starts to rotate in the normal direction. Then, decompression operation is performed during a plurality of times of compression strokes until the decompression cam reaches the second stop position by rotating in the normal direction. <br>
[0010]<br>
As a consequent, decompression operation is performed during at least two compression strokes after the crankshaft starts rotating in the normal direction, and thus the runup angle increases, and thus the same effects as in the invention as stated in Claim 1 are obtained. <br>
[0011]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is a starting method for an internal combustion engine as set forth in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized in that the crankshaft is further<br>
9<br><br>
rotated in the reverse direction by the electric motor after the decompression cam is positioned in the first stop position. [0012]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 3, the effects of the invention as set forth in the cited claims are further improved.  In other words, since the crankshaft is further  rotated  in  the  reverse  direction  after' the' decompression cam is positioned at the first stop position, the run-up angle increases correspondingly, and thus the revolving speed of the crankshaft at the first starting point of compression after stoppage of decompression operation increases, whereby the piston can get over the first compression top dead center after stoppage of decompression operation more easily. <br>
[0013]<br>
The invention according, to Claim 4 is a starting device for an internal combustion engine comprising a electric motor for rotating a crankshaft at startup, a control means for controlling rotation of the crankshaft by the electric motor, and a decompression mechanism for opening an engine valve to be opened and closed by a valve train cam provided on the camshaft that is rotated synchronously with rotation of the crankshaft, characterized in that the decompression mechanism comprises: a decompression cam being rotatably mounted on the camshaft so as to be capable of rotating in the rotational range<br>
10<br><br>
of the camshaft between a reverse rotation stopper that defines the first stop position in the reverse rotational direction of the camshaft and the normal rotation stopper that-defines the second stop position in the normal rotational direction of the camshaft, and has a cam profile for opening the engine valve at the first stop position and closing the same at the second stop position;   torque transmission means  for transmitting reverse rotation .torque from the camshaft to the decompression cam by establishing the constrained state in which relative rotation between the camshaft and the decompression cam is disabled at the timing of reverse rotation of the crankshaft and transmitting drag torque in the normal direction from the camshaft: to the decompression cam by establishing the non-constrained state in which relative rotation between the camshaft and the decompression cam is enabled at the timing of normal rotation of the crankshaft; and rotation control means for preventing and permitting dragging of decompression cam between the first stop position and the second stop position in the normal rotational direction; and in that the electric motor rotates the crankshaft by the prescribed crank angle in the reverse direction and then in the normal direction at startup by the control means, in that the decompression cam is brought into the first stop position by being rotated in the reverse direction by the torque transmission means when the crankshaft<br>
11<br><br>
is rotated in the reverse direction by the prescribed crank angle, and opens the engine valve by the torque transmission means and the rotation control means during the compression stroke included in the range of the prescribed crank angle by which the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction and the first compression stroke after normal rotation of the decompression cam until the decompression cam reaches the second stop position when the crankshaft is rotated in the normal direction.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in Claim 4, the electric motor rotates the crankshaft by the prescribed crank angle in the reverse direction and then in the normal direction at startup, so that the decompression cam is rotated in the reverse direction integrally with the camshaft and brought into abutment with the reverse rotation stopper by the torque transmission means that is brought into the constrained state to allow the decompression cam to take the first stop position where it can open the engine valve when the crankshaft rotates in the reverse direction, and then after the crankshaft started to rotate in the normal direction, the engine valve is opened for performing decompression operation either the compression stroke included in the range of the prescribed crank angle by which the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction or the first compression stroke from start of normal rotation of<br>
12<br><br>
the decompression cam until the decompression cam reaches the second stop position in which the decompression cam abuts against the normal rotation stopper by rotating the decompression cam in the normal direction or by stopping the same by means of the torque transmission means and the rotation control means. As a consequent, the same effects as in the invention according to Claim 1 are exercised. <br>
[0015]<br>
The invention according to Claim 5 is a starting device for an internal combustion engine as set forth in Claim 4, characterized in that the torque transmission means comprises a one-way clutch and a torque limiter provided in series in the torque transmission route from the camshaft to the decompression cam,  the one-way clutch establishes the constrained state when the crankshaft is rotated in the reverse direction and the non-constrained state when the crankshaft rotates in the normal direction so that the drag torque is transmitted from the camshaft to the decompression cam, the torque limiter limits reverse rotation torque transmitted from the camshaft to the decompression cam that is at the first stop position to the value below the upper limit torque, and rotates only the camshaft in the reverse direction when reverse rotation torque excessive of the upper limit torque is exerted to the camshaft,  and the electric motor places the decompression cam at the first stop position, and then rotates<br>
13<br><br>
the crankshaft in the reverse direction. [0016]<br>
According to the invention according to Claim b, the following effects are exercised in addition to the effects of the invention as set forth in Claim 4.  Since the torque transmission means comprises the one-way clutch and the torque limiter provided in series in the torque transmission route from the camshaft to the decompression cam, and when the crankshaft is further rotated in the reverse direction during which relative rotation between the camshaft and the decompression cam is disabled by the effect of the one-way clutch, the decompression cam abuts against the reverse rotation stopper and stopped at the first stop position by the torque limiter in a simple structure, and the run-up angle increases correspondingly, and thus the revolving speed of the crankshaft at the first point of start of compression after stoppage of decompression operation increases, so that the piston can get over the first compression top dead center after stoppage of decompression operation more easily. In addition, the torque limiter can prevent excessive torque from exerting on the decompression cam, the reverse rotation stopper, and the one-way clutch.<br>
[0017]<br>
The invention according to Claim 6 is the starting device for a internal combustion engine as set forth in Claim 4 or<br>
14<br><br>
Claim 5, characterized in that the rotation control means<br>
allows the decompression cam to be dragged in the range of the<br>
angle of decompression operation of the valve train cam, and<br>
the effective operation angle of the decompression cam is<br>
larger than the angle of operation at time of decompression<br>
     [0018]<br>
According to the invention according to Claim 6, since the effective operation angle of the decompression cam is larger than the operation angle of the valve train cam which opens and closes the engine valve during the time that the valve is opened by the decompression cam at startup, decompression operation is not stopped by the first opening of the engine valve by the valve train cam after normal rotation has started, but is stopped at subsequent openings of the engine valve by the valve train cam. As a consequence, the effects of the invention according to the cited claims are obtained by a simple structure depending on the configuration of the profile of the decompression cam.<br>
[0019]<br>
In this specification, various angles of operation and various angles means the rotational angles of the crankshaft.<br>

18<br><br>
In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, an internal combustion engine E embodying the present invention is a SOHC type, single-cylinder four-stroke internal combustion engine to be mounted on a motorcycle, comprising a cylinder 1, a cylinder head 2 to be connected to the upper end of the cylinder 1, a cylinder head cover 3 to be connected to the upper end of the cylinder head 2, and a crankcase (not shown) to be connected to the lower end of the cylinder 1 for rotatably supporting a crankshaft 4. A piston 5 being slidably fitted into a cylinder hole la formed on the cylinder 1 is connected to the crankshaft 4 via a connecting rod 6, and the crankshaft 4 is rotated by the reciprocating piston 5.  The crankshaft 4 is rotated by a starter motor M, an electric motor that is capable of rotating in the normal direction and in the reverse direction at startup of the internal combustion engine E, and driving of the starter motor M is controlled based on the output signal from an electronic control unit C as control means to which signals from a starter switch W and a rotational position sensor G are supplied.<br>
[0021]<br>
The cylinder head 2 is formed with an air intake port 8 and an exhaust port 9 communicating with a combustion chamber 7 positioned upwardly of the cylinder hole la, and is provided with an intake valve 10 for opening and closing an intake valve port 8a, which is an opening of the air intake port 8 leading<br>
 19<br><br>
to the combustion chamber 7, and an exhaust valve 11 for opening and closing an exhaust valve port 9a, which is an opening of the exhaust port 9 leading to the combustion chamber 7. The intake valve 10 and the exhaust valve 11 are urged to close the intake valve port 8a and the exhaust valve port . 9a respectively by valve springs 13, 14 to be mounted between retainers 12 integrally mounted between the respective ends of the springs and the cylinder head 2.  In addition, an ignition plug 15 for burning air-fuel mixture sucked into the combustion chamber 7 from the intake unit, not shown, through the air intake port 8 is screwed into the cylinder head 2, so as to face toward the combustion chamber 7. <br>
[0022]<br>
In a dynamic valve chamber V defined by the cylinder head 2 and the cylinder head cover 3, a camshaft 16 to be disposed between the intake valve 10 and the exhaust valve 11 is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 2 via a pair of ball bearings 17, and the camshaft 16 is rotated by the driving mechanism comprising a driven sprocket 18 provided at one end of the camshaft 16, a driving sprocket 19 provided on the crankshaft 4, and a timing chain 2 0 routed on both of these sprockets 18, 19 synchronously with the crankshaft 4 at half the revolving speed of the crankshaft 4. <br>
[0023] <br>
Further, a pair of rocker shafts 21, 22 to be disposed<br>
20<br><br>
respectively in parallel with the camshaft 16 are secured to the cylinder head 2 at the positions between the intake valve 10 and the camshaft 16, and between the exhaust valve 11 and the camshaft 16 in the dynamic valve chamber V, and n intake rocker arm 23 and an exhaust rocker arm 24 are pivotally supported by the rocker shafts 21, 22 respectively. Tappet screws 25 that can abut against the extremities of the in/take valve 10 and the exhaust valve 11 are adjustably screwed on the ends of the intake rocker arm 23 and the exhaust rocker arm 24, and are secured by a locknut 26. The other ends of the intake rocker arm 23 and the exhaust rocker arm 24 are bifurcated by a pair of supporting portions 23a, 23b; 24a, 24b, and a roller 27 and a roller 28 to be accommodated in the opening formed between the pair of supporting portions 23a, 23b; 24a, 24b are rotatably supported on a supporting shaft 29 fitted to the pair of supporting portions 23a, 23b; 24a, 24b via a needle bearing 30. <br>
[0024]<br>
The roller 27 and the roller 28 are in rolling contact with an intake cam 31 and an exhaust cam 32 as the valve train cam provided on the camshaft 16. The exhaust cam 32 has a cam profile including a base circle portion 32a and a lift portion 32b having a prescribed operation angle A2 (See Fig. 7) for defining the valve-opening period and a cam lift for defining a prescribed lift amount. The intake cam 31 also has a cam<br>
21<br><br>
profile including a base circle portion and the lift portion. The intake rocker arm 23 and the exhaust rocker arm 24 to be pivoted according to these cam profiles open and close the intake valve 10 and the exhaust valve 11 respectively in cooperation with the valve springs 13, 14. Therefore, both of the rocker arms 23, 24 serve as cam follower for opening and closing the intake valve 10 and the exhaust valve 11 while following the movement of the corresponding intake cam 31 and the exhaust cam 32.<br>
[0025]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3 to Fig. 5, the camshaft 16 also provided with a decompression mechanism D for reducing the compressing pressure in the combustion engine 7 during the compressing stroke for facilitating startup of internal combustion engine E at startup. The decompression mechanism D comprises a decompression cam 4 0 to be provided on the camshaft 16, a torque transmission mechanism, and rotation control means, and the decompression cam 40 can be rotated in the same direction as the rotational direction of the camshaft 16 that rotates in the normal and reverse directions by the torque of the camshaft 16 transmitted by the torque transmission mechanism.<br>
[0026]<br>
The torque transmission mechanism comprises a one-way clutch 41 and a torque limiter 50 disposed in series in the<br>
22 <br>
torque transmission route through which torque is transmitted from the camshaft 16 to the decompression cam 40. The one-way clutch 41 is attached on the periphery of the camshaft 16 on the side of the camshaft 16 axially opposite from the intake cam 31 so as to contact the periphery of the exhaust cam 32. The one-way clutch 41 comprises a cylindrical outer ring 42 to be fitted on the camshaft 16 so as to be capable of relative rotation and a clutch element including a roller 43 and a coil spring 44 on the periphery thereof. The outer ring 42 has a smaller diameter portion 42a and a larger diameter portion 42b that has a diameter larger than the smaller diameter portion 42a, and the larger diameter portion 42b formed on its inner peripheral surface with three cam grooves 45 each having a depth that decreases toward the direction of reverse rotation R, which is the opposite direction from the direction of normal rotation N of the camshaft 16, at regular intervals in the circumferential direction, and the roller 43 and the coil spring 44 for urging the roller 43 toward the shallower side in the cam groove 45 are accommodated in each cam groove 45.<br>
[0027]<br>
When the camshaft 16 is rotated in the normal direction synchronously with the normal rotation of the crankshaft 4, the roller 43 moves toward the deeper side in the cam groove 45 in opposition to the spring force of the coil spring 44, and thus the one-way clutch 41 is brought into the non-<br>
23<br><br>
constrained state in which relative rotation between the camshaft 16 and the outer ring 42 is enabled. However, in this non-constrained state, inconsiderable drag torque in the normal direction N that will be described later is transmitted from the camshaft 16 to the outer ring 42 by a slight force transmitted to the outer ring 42 via the coil spring 44 based on a frictional force between the camshaft 16 and the roller 43 and' a slight frictional force between the camshaft 16 and the outer ring 42. When the camshaft 16 rotates synchronously with reverse rotation of the crankshaft 4 in the reverse direction, the roller 43 moves toward the shallower side in the cam groove 45 and is caught between the camshaft 16 and the outer ring 42, and the one-way clutch 41 is brought into the constrained state in which relative rotation between the camshaft 16 and the outer ring 42 is disabled, and thus reverse rotation torque of the camshaft 16 is transmitted to the outer ring 42, and the camshaft 16 and the outer ring 42 rotate integrally in the reverse direction. [0028]<br>
The smaller diameter portion 42a of the outer ring 42 is fitted with the ring-shaped decompression cam 4 0 on the outer periphery thereof so as to be capable of relative rotation, and the axial movement of the decompression cam 4 0 is limited by a stopper ring 47 to be fitted in the annular groove formed on the outer periphery of the smaller diameter portion 42a with<br>
24<br><br>
a washer 46 interposed so that an end face 40d opposed to the larger diameter portion 42b in the axial direction is maintained in a state of being in surface contact with an end face 42bl of the larger diameter portion 42b in opposition to the spring force of a coil spring 53, which will be described later, comprising the torque limiter 50.<br>
[0029]<br>
The torque limiter 50 provided between the decompression cam 40 and the one-way clutch 41 for transmitting torque of the camshaft 16 transmitted to the one-way clutch 41 to the decompression cam 40 comprises a engaging portion provided on the end face 40d of the decompression cam 40, and an engaging element including a ball 52 and the coil spring 53-for engaging the engaging portion.  The engaging portion comprises a plurality of, for example, twelve engaging grooves 51 formed circumferentially at regular intervals on the end face 40d of the decompression cam 40, and each engaging groove 51 comprises, as well shown in Fig. 6, a steeply inclined portion 51a on which a part of the ball 52 is brought into surface contact and which is reduced suddenly in depth toward the direction of reverse rotation R, and a gradually inclined portion 51b that is reduced gradually in depth toward the normal rotational direction N. [0030]<br>
The larger diameter portion 42b of the outer ring 42 is formed for example with three accommodation holes 54 having<br>
25<br><br>
bottoms, extending in the axial direction and each opening on the end surface 42bl at positions between the three circumferentially adjacent cam grooves 45 at such intervals as to be able to come in alignment with circumfereritially adjacent three engaging grooves 51 in the axial direction, and each accommodation hole 54 accommodates the ball 52 and the coil spring 53 for urging the ball 52 toward the decompression cam 40 in the axial direction. When the engaging groove 51 and the ball 52 are brought into alignment and a part of the ball 52 is fitted into and pressed against the steeply inclined portion 51a of the engaging groove 51 by a spring force of the coil spring 53, the torque limiter 50 transmits torque transmitted from the camshaft 16 through the outer ring 42 to the decompression cam 40 directly, and integrally rotates the outer ring 42 and the decompression cam 40.  When reverse rotation torque applied from the outer ring 42 to the decompression cam 40 is excessive torque that exceeds the upper limit torque,  that is,  maximum torque at which the decompression cam 40 and the outer ring 42 can be integrally rotated, the ball 52 is forced out from the steeply inclined portion 51a by such excessive torque, and the torque limiter 50 blocks transmission of such excessive torque to the outer ring 42, whereby only the outer ring 42 is rotated integrally with the camshaft 16 in the reverse direction by reverse rotation torque transmitted from the camshaft 16. The upper<br>
26<br><br>
limit torque is set at a value larger than rotational resistance torque generated by a frictional force between the cam portion/, which will be described later, of the decompression cam 40 and the exhaust rocker arm 24 that is in contact with the cam portion when the crankshaft 4 rotates in the reverse direction,. * The maximum torque at which the decompression cam 40 and the outer ring 42 can rotate integrally is set at a value smaller than the upper limit torque in the reverse rotation from the gradually inclined portion 51b of the engaging groove 51 since the torque transmitted to the decompression cam 40 is aforementioned drag torque in contrast to normal rotation torque applied from the outer ring 42 to the decompression cam 40. The gradually inclined portion 51b enables the ball 52 moving toward the engaging groove 51 which is adjacent in the reverse rotational direction R to fit into the engaging groove 51 in question smoothly in the case where the decompression cam 40 abuts against a reverse rotation stopper 33, which will be described later, and only the outer ring 42 rotates in the reverse direction.<br>
[0031]<br>
On the other hand, the decompression cam 40 with which a slipper portion 24al (See Fig. 3), which is a part of the outer peripheral surface of one of the supporting portions 24a of the exhaust rocker arm 24, comes into contact comprises, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, a projecting portion 40c<br>
27<br><br>
projecting in the radial direction, a pair of base circle portions 40al, 40a2 extending circumferentially with the' projecting portion 40c interposed therebetween, and a lift portion 40b continuing from both of the base circle portions 40al, 40a2 and projecting in the radial direction^ The' • : projecting portion 40c abuts against the reverse rotation stopper 33 provided on the cylinder head 2, as shown in Fig. 1, when the decompression cam 40 rotates in the reverse direction, thereby preventing the decompression cam 4 0 from further rotating in the reverse direction.  The projecting portion 40c abuts against a normal rotation stopper 34 secured to the rocker shaft 21 when the decompression cam 40 rotates in the normal direction, thereby preventing the decompression cam 4 0 from further rotating in the normal direction. Therefore, the decompression cam 40 can rotate only between the reverse rotation stopper 33 that defines the first stop position in the reverse rotational direction R, and the normal rotation stopper 34 that defines the second stop position in the normal rotational direction N.<br>
[0032]<br>
The base circle portions 40al, 40a2 of the decompression cam 40 have such diameters that the slipper portion 24al comes into contact with them when the roller 28 is in contact with the base circle portion 32a of the exhaust cam 32, and the lift portion 4 0b is formed circumferentially along a prescribed<br>
28<br><br>
range so as to project by a constant amount in the radial direction, and has a cam lift defining a prescribed lift amount for decompression Ld, which is smaller than the maximum lift amount Le of the exhaust valve 11 lifted by the "exhaust cam 32, as shown in Fig. 7 for performing decompression operation for reducing the compressing pressure in the combustion chamber, 7. The cam profile of the decompression cam 40 is constructed of the part of the lift portion 40b with which the slipper portion 24al contacts and the part of the base circle 40al with which the slipper portion 24al contacts within the range of a preset rotational angle Ad, which is the angle that the decompression cam 4 0 rotates between the reverse rotation stopper 33 and the normal rotation stopper 34, out of the part of the base circle portion 40al and the lift portion 40b extending from the projecting portion 4 0c in the normal rotational direction N. With such cam profile, when the decompression cam 40 is at the first stop position, the lift portion 40b is at the position where it can come into contact with the slipper portion 24al, and thus the decompression cam 4 0 can open the exhaust valve 11, and when the decompression cam 40 is at the second stop position, the base circle portion 40al is at the position where it can come into contact with the slipper portion 24al, and thus the decompression cam 40 can close the exhaust valve 11. <br>
[0033]<br>
29<br><br>
Further, in this embodiment, the effective operation angle Al, which is the angular range of the lift portion .4 Ob having a constant cam lift in the aforementioned cam profile/ is set to the value larger than the angle of decompression operation A3 of the exhaust cam 32, that is, the angular range where the exhaust valve 11 opened by the decompression cam 4 0 is opened by a lift amount larger than the lift amount for decompression Ld by the lift portion 32b of the exhaust cam 32, so that the decompression operation is not stopped by opening of the exhaust valve 11 during the first exhaust stroke after the crankshaft 4 starts to rotate in the normal direction, and  simultaneously  smaller  than  twice  the  angle  of decompression operation A3 so that the decompression operation is released by opening of the exhaust valve 11 during the second exhaust stroke after the crankshaft 4 starts to rotate in the normal direction. In this embodiment, the preset rotational angle Ad is set to the value smaller than twice the operation angle A2 of the exhaust cam 32.<br>
[0034]<br>
The rotation control means comprises the exhaust locker arm 24 that applies a pressing force based on a spring force of the valve spring 14 on the decompression cam 4 0 with the slipper portion 24al being contacted with the lift portion 4 0b of the decompression cam 40. When the decompression operation in which the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the decompression<br>
30<br><br>
cam 40, the exhaust rocker arm 24 applies rotational resistance torque caused by a frictional force between the slipper portion 24al and the lift portion 40b on the decompression cam 4 0 by the pressing force. Since the rotational resistance torque is set to be larger than the drag torque, the exhaust rocker arm 24 prevents the decompression cam 40 from rotating in the; normal direction by the drag torque generated when the camshaft 16 is rotated in the normal direction when the slipper portion 24al is in contact with the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam 40, while it allows the decompression cam 40 to rotate in the normal direction by the drag torque when the roller 28 of the exhaust rocker arm 24 is in contact with the lift portion 32b of the exhaust cam 32 and thus the slipper portion 24al moves away from the lift portion 4 0b of the decompression cam 4 0 so that the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the exhaust cam 32. <br>
[0035]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, the electronic control unit C is supplied with a detected signal from the rotational position sensor G for detecting the rotational position of the camshaft 16, and the specific rotational position of the camshaft 16, for example, an exhaust top dead center, is detected by the sensor, and the rotational position of the crankshaft 4 where the crankshaft 4 stops reverse rotation after the decompression cam 40 is abutted against the reverse rotation stopper 33 is<br>
3   1<br><br>
set to be the second exhaust top dead center (the rotational position P8 in Fig. 14) after initiation of reverse .rotation. At the exhaust top dead center, the lift amount of the exhaust valve 11 is smaller than the lift amount for decompression Ldv so that the slipper portion 24al of the exhaust rocker arm 24, can abut against the decompression cam 40. <br>
[0036]<br>
As a consequent, the electronic control unit C controls drive of the starter motor M in such a manner that when the ON-signal is supplied by the starter switch W, the starter motor M is rotated in the reverse direction and thus the crankshaft 4 is rotated in the reverse direction by the initial reverse rotation angle Ar (See Fig. 14) to the second exhaust top dead center at which the angle is larger than the preset rotational angle Ad (See Fig. 7), and subsequently, the starter motor M is rotated in the normal direction to rotate the crankshaft 4 in the normal direction. <br>
[0037]<br>
Subsequently, referring mainly to Fig. 14, together with Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 7 to Fig. 13, the action of the decompression mechanism D will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, it is assumed that at startup of the internal combustion engine E(rotational position Pi), the crankshaft 4 is stopped in the middle of the compression stroke SI, and the decompression cam 40 is at the second stop position<br>
32<br><br>
where it abuts against the normal rotation stopper 34 (See Fig. 8). In this case, description is made assuming that reverse rotation of the crankshaft 4 did not occur when the; internal combustion engine E is stopped. However, even when reverse rotation occurred, the same action as the following description will basically be carried out except for the position of the decompression cam 40 at startup which it reaches after rotating in the direction of reverse rotation R from the normal rotation stopper 34.  In Fig. 14, the rotational position of the crankshaft 4 is shown by the extra-thick arrow, the rotational position of the decompression cam 4 0 is shown by the hollow arrow, and whether exhaust valve 11 is opened or closed is shown by the arrow of moderate thickness. <br>
[0038]<br>
When the starter switch W is turned on, the starter motor M rotates in the reverse direction by the instruction from the electronic control unit C and thus the crankshaft 4 and the camshaft 16 are rotated in the reverse direction. Fueling and ignition in the internal combustion engine E are stopped when the crankshaft 4 rotate in the reverse direction, and are started after initiation of normal rotation of the crankshaft 4 . The one-way clutch 41 is brought into the constrained state by reverse rotation of the camshaft 16, and the outer ring 42 rotates integrally with the camshaft 16 in the reverse direction.  In this case, since the rotational resistance<br>
33<br><br>
torque based on a frictional force caused by contact between the slipper position 24al of the exhaust rocker arm 24 and the base circle portion 40al and lift portion 40b of the<br>
decompression cam 4 0 is smaller than the aforementioned upper<br>
          limit torque, the decompression cam 40 rotates integrally with<br>
the camshaft 16 in the reverse direction by reverse rotation torque applied from the camshaft 16 and the outer ring 42 through the torque limiter 50 to the decompression cam 40.<br>
[0039]<br>
Then, in the middle of reverse rotation of the camshaft 16, the slipper portion 24al comes into contact with the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam 40, and the exhaust rocker arm 24 is pivoted, and thus the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the lift amount for decompression Ld. Subsequently, after the first intake stroke S2 of the internal combustion engine E after initiation of reverse rotation (actually, since the crankshaft 4 is rotated in the reverse direction, the piston 5 moves toward the top dead center, but it is referred as intake stroke as a matter of convenience. Hereinafter, the name of the stroke when the crankshaft 4 is rotated in the normal direction is used also when it is rotated in the reverse direction), the decompression cam 40 stops at the aforementioned first stop position at the moment when the projecting portion 40c of the decompression cam 40 abuts against the reverse rotation stopper 33 (rotational position P2), and further reverse rotation is<br>
34<br><br>
prevented.  Therefore, the rotational resistance torque applied on the decompression cam 4 0 exceeds the upper limit torque, and the aforementioned excessive torque is applied on the torque limiter 50 to release the bail 52 of the torque^ limiter 50 from being fitted into the steeply inclined portion 51a of the engaging groove 51, whereby only the outer ring 42 rotates integrally with the camshaft 16 in the reverse; direction. This additional reverse rotation continues during the exhaust stroke S3, the expansion stroke S4, and the compression stroke S5 and the intake stroke S6, and terminates when the crankshaft 4 is rotated by the initial reverse rotation angle Ar in the reverse direction (rotational position P3) at the timing of the second exhaust top dead center after initiation of reverse rotation is detected by the rotational position sensor G (See Fig. 9). In this example, the slipper portion 24al of the exhaust locker arm 24 is in contact with the lift portion 4 0b of the decompression cam 40 at the timing when reverse rotation is terminated, and the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the lift amount for decompression Ld. [0040]<br>
Subsequently, by the instruction from the electronic control unit C, the starter motor M rotates in the normal direction to rotate the crankshaft 4 and the camshaft 16 in the normal direction. In this case, the one-way clutch 41 is brought into non-constrained state by the normal rotation of<br>
35<br><br>
the camshaft 16, and the outer ring 42 applies the drag torque smaller than the aforementioned upper limit torque on the decompression cam 40 through the torque limiter 50. However, since the rotational resistance torque generated by the fact that the slipper portion 24al of the exhaust rocker arm 24 is in contact with the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam-40 urged by the valve spring 14 is larger than the drag torque until the rotational position of the crankshaft 4 in an intake stroke S7 passes through the first compression stroke S8 and the expansion stroke S9 after initiation of normal rotation of the crankshaft 4 (or the camshaft 16) and reaches the first exhaust stroke S10 (See Fig. 10), the decompression cam 40 does not rotate in the normal direction, and stops at the first stop position.  Therefore, in the first compression stroke S8, since the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the lift amount for decompression Ld so. that the decompression operation is performed, and thus the compressing pressure in the combustion chamber 7 is reduced, the piston 5 can easily get over the compression top dead center (rotational position P4).<br>
[0041]<br>
Then, in the first exhaust stroke S10, the camshaft 16 is rotated in the normal direction, and the roller 2 8 of the exhaust rocker arm 24 is brought into contact with the exhaust cam 32, and then the exhaust rocker arm 24 is pivoted by the exhaust cam 32. Subsequently, the exhaust valve 11 is opened<br>
36<br><br>
by a lift amount larger than the lift amount of the decompression cam 40 (See Fig. 11).  As a consequent, the slipper portion 24al moves away from the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam 40, and thus rotational resistance torque of the decompression cam 4 0 is reduced to the value smaller than the drag torque, whereby the decompression cam 40 rotates in the normal direction with the outer ring 42 at the same rotational speed with the camshaft 16 by the drag torque. Though such normal rotation of the decompression cam 4 0 is generated in the region of the angle of decompression operation A3 of the exhaust cam 32, since the effective operation angle Al of the decompression cam 40 is larger than the angle of decompression operation A3, the slipper portion 24al comes into contact with the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam 40 again in the final period of the first exhaust stroke S10, and the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the lift amount for decompression Ld.  Simultaneously, since the rotational resistance torque of the decompression cam 4 0 is increased to the value larger then the drag torque, the rotation of the decompression cam 40 stops (See Fig. 12).<br>
[0042]<br>
Subsequently, only the camshaft 16 further rotates in the normal direction, and the decompression operation is performed in the second compression stroke S12 (that is, the first compression stroke after normal rotation of the<br>
37<br><br>
decompression cam 40) . Therefore, the piston 5 can easily get over the compression top dead center (rotational position'P5) .<br>
[0043]<br>
Then, the camshaft 16 further rotates in the normal direction through the expansion stroke S13, and subsequently, during the second exhaust stroke S14 after initiation of normal rotation of the crankshaft 4, the slipper portion 24al moves away from the decompression cam 40 when the exhaust valve 11 is opened by the exhaust cam 32 as in the case of the first exhaust stroke S10.  Therefore, the decompression cam 40 rotates in the normal direction at the same rotational speed with the camshaft 16 by the drag torque.  However, the effective operation angle Al of the decompression cam 40 is smaller than twice the angle of decompression operation A3 of the exhaust cam 32, and the preset rotational angle Ad is smaller than twice the operation angle A2 of the exhaust cam 32 (See Fig. 7).  Therefore, the projection 40c of the decompression cam 40 abuts against the normal operation stopper 34 during the second exhaust stroke S14, and the decompression cam 40 takes the second stop position. Consequently, when the second exhaust stroke S14 terminates, the slipper portion 24al comes into contact with the base circle portion 40al of the decompression cam 40, and thus the exhaust valve 11 moves according to the cam profile of the exhaust cam 32 with which the roller 28 of the exhaust rocker arm 24 comes into contact<br>
38<br><br>
and is brought into closed state (See Fig- 13). Accordingly,<br>
the decompression operation by the decompression mechanism D<br>
with respect to the exhaust valve 11 is stopped, and from then<br>
onward, the exhaust valve 11 is opened and closed only by the<br>
exhaust cam 32.<br>
[0044]<br>
 Then, the camshaft 16 further rotates in the normal<br>
direction through the intake stroke S15, and subsequently,<br>
during the third compression stroke S16 after initiation of<br>
normal rotation of the crankshaft 4, air-fuel mixture is<br>
compressed at the normal compressing pressure without reducing<br>
the pressure by the decompression operation and ignited by the<br>
ignition plug 15, so that the internal combustion engine E<br>
proceeds to the starting operation, and then to the idle<br>
operation. In this third compression stroke S16, since the<br>
crank angle from initiation of normal rotation of the<br>
crankshaft 4 to the compression starting portion P6 of the third<br>
compression stroke S16 (the first compression stroke starting<br>
point (compression bottom dead center) while the crankshaft<br>
4 is rotated in the normal direction and after the decompression<br>
operation is released)(rotational position P6), that is, the<br>
run-up angle Aa of the crankshaft 4 is large in comparison with<br>
the case where the crankshaft 4 is rotated in the normal<br>
direction immediately from the startup position of the internal<br>
combustion engine E for performing the regular compression<br>
39<br><br>
stroke, the acceleration time is increased, and thus the crankshaft 4 rotates at a faster rotational speed, thereby . facilitating the piston to get over the compression top dead' v center P7, which is the regular compression pressure.<br>
[0045]<br>
Subsequently, the operation and effects of the embodiment constructed as described thus far will be described below.<br>
At startup of the internal combustion engine E, the starter motor M controlled by the electronic control unit C rotates the crankshaft 4 and thus the camshaft 16 in the reverse direction by the initial reverse rotation angle Ar, and then rotates the same in the normal direction, so that the decompression cam 40 is rotated integrally with the camshaft 16 in the reverse direction via the one-way clutch 41 that is brought into the constrained state during reverse rotation of the crankshaft 4 to the first stop position, and the exhaust rocker arm 24 is brought into abutment with the lift portion 4 0b of the decompression cam 4 0 to enable the exhaust valve 11 to be opened.  Subsequently, the crankshaft 4 and the camshaft 16 are further rotated in the reverse direction with the decompression cam 40 kept at the first stop position by the action of the torque limiter 50.<br>
[0046]<br>
After initiation of normal rotation of the crankshaft<br>
40<br><br>
4, the exhaust rocker arm 24 prevents normal rotation of the decompression cam 40, on which the drag torque is transmitted from the one-way clutch 41, by applying rotational resistance torque thereon and bringing the slipper portion 24al into<br>
contact with the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam 40,<br>
'%. •■-&gt; while it permits normal rotation of the decompression cam 40<br>
by the drag torque when the roller 28 is brought into contact<br>
with the exhaust cam 32 and the slipper portion 24al is moved<br>
away from the decompression cam 40. As a consequence, the<br>
decompression cam 4 0 has effective operation angle Al set at<br>
a value larger than the angle of decompression operation of<br>
the valve train cam for opening and closing the exhaust valve<br>
11 that is opened by the decompression cam 40 at startup, and<br>
also the angle of decompression operation of the decompression<br>
cam is smaller than twice the angle of decompression operation<br>
of the exhaust cam 32, the decompression cam performing<br>
decompression with the exhaust valve 11 opened by lift amount<br>
for decompression Ld during the first compression stroke S8,<br>
included in the initial reverse rotation angle Ar of the reverse<br>
rotation and during the first compression stroke S12 after<br>
start of normal rotation of the decompression cam 40 and during<br>
the period from the first stop position to the second stop<br>
position..<br>
[0047]<br>
As a consequence, the run-up angle Aa increases by the<br>
41<br><br>
amount corresponding to the reverse rotation of the crankshaft 4 from the rotational position PI of the crankshaft 4 at startup of the internal combustion engine E by the initial reverse rotation angle Ar, and thus the rotational speed of the crankshaft 4 at the first compression starting point (rotational position P6) after release of the decompression operation increases, so that the piston can easily get over the first compression top dead center (rotational position P7 ) after stoppage of decompression operation, thereby improving starting capability while avoiding upsizing of the starter motor M that rotates the crankshaft 4.  In addition to it, increase in the run-up angle Aa can be realized in a simple structure by setting the effective operation angle Al of the lift portion 40b of the decompression cam 40. <br>
[0048]<br>
In addition, since the decompression cam 40 can be placed in such a manner that the exhaust rocker arm 24 is always in contact with a fixed position of the lift portion 4 0b of the decompression cam 40 at startup of normal rotation of the crankshaft 4 (rotational position P3) irrespective of the rotational position PI of the crankshaft 4 at startup of the internal combustion engine E by placing the decompression cam 40 at the first stop position when rotating the crankshaft 4 in the reverse direction, the angular range in which the exhaust valve 11 can be opened by the decompression cam 40, that is,<br>
42<br><br>
the effective operation angle Al, can be set to a fixed position for every startup, thereby ensuring the run-up angle Aa that, is larger than that in the related art. <br>
[0049]<br>
The torque limiter 50 for preventing reverse rotations torque exceeding upper limit torque from being applied on the decompression cam 4 0 when the crankshaft 4 rotates in the reverse direction is provided in series with the one-way clutch 41 in the torque transmission route extending from the camshaft 16 to the decompression cam 40. Therefore, when the crankshaft 4 is rotated in the reverse direction during which relative rotation of the camshaft 16 and the decompression cam 40 is disabled by the one-way clutch 41, the torque limiter 50 allows further reverse rotation of the crankshaft 4 after the decompression cam 4 0 abuts against the reverse rotation stopper 33 at the first stop position, for increasing the run-up angle with a simple structure. In addition, the torque limiter 16 prevents  excessive torque  from being  applied on the decompression cam 40, the reverse rotation stopper 33 and the one-way clutch 41. <br>
[0050]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment in which a part of the construction of the aforementioned embodiment is modified will be described relating to the modified construction.<br>
In the aforementioned embodiment, though the initial<br>
43<br><br>
reverse rotation angle Ar is set up to the second exhaust top dead center after initiation of reverse rotation based on the detected signal from the rotational position sensor G, it may, be the angle set according to the rotational position of the camshaft 16 whereof the angle is larger than the preset rotational angle Ad, for example, an angle up to the first exhaust top dead center after initiation of reverse rotation, or may be an angle set according to an arbitrary rotational position of the camshaft 16 after initiation of reverse rotation other than the exhaust top dead center. In addition, the initial reverse rotation angle Ar may be an angle larger than the preset rotational angle Ad and stored in the memory of the electronic control ; unit C and not sensed by the rotational position sensor G, whereby the rotational sensor is not necessary and thus the costs may be reduced. <br>
[0051]<br>
In addition, in the aforementioned embodiment, the initial reverse rotation angle Ar is set to the angle at which the crankshaft 4 and the camshaft 16 are rotated in the reverse direction even after the decompression cam 40 abuts against the reverse rotation stopper 33. However, it is also possible to provide a sensor such as a contact sensor for detecting that the decompression cam 40 is abutted against the reverse rotation stopper 33 so that the reverse rotation is terminated when the decompression Cam 40 takes the first stop position.<br>
44 <br>
In this case as well, the run-up angle Aa increases in comparison with the related art, and the piston can easily get over the first compression stroke after stoppage of decompression operation. <br>
[0052]<br>
In the aforementioned embodiment, the effective  operation angle Al of the decompression cam 40 is set at a value larger than the angle of decompression operation A3 of the exhaust cam 32 for opening and closing the exhaust valve 11 that is opened by the decompression cam 4 0 at startup, and simultaneously smaller than twice the angle of decompression operation A3. However, it is also possible to set the same to the value larger than twice the exhaust cam 32, and in such a case, the run-up angle Aa can further be increased.  <br>
  [0053]<br>
Though the electric motor is a starter motor M in the aforementioned embodiment, the generator motor that is an electric motor that also serves as a generator as a starter motor may be used at startup. It is also possible that the electric motor is the one that can only rotate in the normal direction, and the control means is provided with a switching mechanism for switching rotation of the crankshaft 4 from the normal direction to the reverse direction and vice versa in the rotational force transmission route from the electric motor itself to the crankshaft 4, so that the crankshaft 4 is rotated<br>
45<br><br>
in the normal direction or in the reverse direction by means<br>
of the electric motor and the switching mechanism.<br>
[0054]	<br>
Though the engine valve that is opened by the<br>
decompression cam 40 is the exhaust valve 11, in the<br>
aforementioned embodiment, it may be the intake valve 10 . When<br>
providing a sensor for detecting the rotational position of<br>
the camshaft 16 in this case, it is preferable to determine<br>
the rotational position of the crankshaft 4 at termination of<br>
reverse rotation to be near the timing to close the valve of<br>
the intake valve within the range that the decompression cam<br>
40 does not rotate in the normal direction by the drag torgue<br>
immediately after initiation of normal rotation of the<br>
crankshaft 4.<br>
