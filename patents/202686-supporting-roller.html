COMPLETE SPECIFICATION Section 10<br>
Supporting Roller<br>
POLYSIUS AG, of Graf-Galen Strasse 17, 59269 Beckum, Germany, a German Corporation<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Supporting roller set for tillable support of a rotary drum<br>
The invention relates to a supporting roller set for tiltable, axially movable and rotatable support for a rotary drum which can be driven in rotation, such as a rotary kiln, rotary dryer and the like.<br>
In order that rotary drums with relatively large dimensions, not only with regard to the<br>
diameter but also with regard to the length, can be reliably supported or mounted, use is made - as is generally known - of at least two supporting roller sets which are disposed at a corresponding axial distance from one another. In the case of such rotary drams with large dimensions, such as for example rotary kilns, rotary dryers and the like, it is not possible to avoid the occurrence, on the one hand, of certain inaccuracies of assembly and, on the other hand, of more or less great deformations and distortions of the appertaining drum shell, which manifest themselves particularly severely in the case of rotary drums with a strong heat effect, as in the case of rotary kilns. In practical operation this leads to wobbling movements in the region of the running surfaces which support such a rotary drum on the corresponding supporting rollers and are formed by riding rings mounted on the corresponding sections of the drum. In order to be able to compensate for impaired supporting action due tc such wobbling movements of the rotary drum running surfaces and to reduce the resulting abrasion (wear) and damage to the circumferential surfaces or running surfaces which are in engagement with one another, numerous embodiments of supporting roller sets are already known in which the supporting rollers and/or the bedplates bearing them are supported so as to be tiltable or axially movable relative to a stationary<br>
In this case it should basically be noted that the irregular supporting action in the contact surface between two touching cylinders, which has already been addressed above, can be caused by a so-called "skewing" and/or by a so-called "edge support". "Skewing" is understood to mean the situation where the parallel central axes of two touching cylinders are twisted relative to one another about their common connecting normal, so that the twisted central axis have no common point of intersection. In such skewing an irregular pressure distribution occurs in the contact surfaces with the maximum in the middle of the contact<br><br><br>
surfaces (viewed over the length of the cylinder), and additionally in the rolling operation between the circumferential surfaces of the cylinders (e.g. between the riding ring of a rotary drum and a supporting roller) the skewing produces axial forces, i.e. forces in the direction of the cylinder axes, in the contact surfaces when corresponding opposing forces (e.g. a so-called "slope take-off force" of a rotary kiln which acts axially) are present. "Edge support" is understood to mean the situation where the parallel central axes of two touching cylinders are twisted relative to one another in their common plane, so that the twisted central axes have a common point of intersections. In this edge support the so-called "Hertzian pressure" is distributed irregularly over the contact surfaces on the length of the cylinders, i.e. the resulting pressure from the integration of the surface pressure (Hertzian pressure) acts unilaterally radially on the touching cylinders.<br>
In practice attempts are made to prevent the skewing and edge support by the use of self-adjusting supporting rollers or supporting roller systems and thus to achieve a favourable contact pattern (constant Hertzian pressure) between the rotary drum running surfaces and the outer circumferential surfaces of the supporting rollers as far as possible in all operating conditions. In order to be able to follow all possible movements (wobbling etc.) of the running surfaces, the bedplate of a supporting, roller would for example have to be mounted so that it has at least two degrees of freedom in rotation about the theoretical axes of the skewing and of the edge support. A spherical bearing would of course meet this requirement. However, in such a bearing an unstable mechanical system is produced, i.e. the supporting roller can move in an uncontrolled manner relative to the rotary drum running surface. The critical degree of freedom of this self-adjustment is the rotation about the theoretical axis of rotation of the skewing, the skewing of the supporting roller being caused by eccentric circumferential forces (tractive forces in the case of non-driven supporting rollers and driving forces in the case of driven supporting rollers). As the rotation or skewing increases no restoring forces are produced on the supporting roller, so that the supporting roller goes out of control. Such a system is not capable of functioning.<br>
In order to avoid the described instability, it is known in the art to mount the bedplate of a self-adjusting supporting roller so that no uncontrollable skewing can occur, i.e. of the two<br><br>
necessary degrees of freedom of the self-adjusting bearing of the bedplate the degree of freedom of the skewing is dispensed with. The remaining degree of freedom prevents the edge support between the rotary drum running surface and the supporting roller. The bedplate thus mounted with the firmly connected supporting roller follows the rotary drum running surface (riding ring) through tilting movements only in one direction and thus prevents the said edge support. The position of the theoretical axis of rotation about which the tilting movements take place plays a significant role in the susceptibility of the self-adjustment to axial forces on the part of the rotary drums.<br>
In a construction which is known from EP-A-0 109 136 and corresponds approximately to the supporting roller set referred to in the preamble to Claim 1, the supporting roller is supported on its axle via two rotary bearings by the two ends of a tiltable bedplate.   This bedplate is mounted by means of a central self-orienting roller bearing essentially in the form of a circular cylindrical part which is in movable contact with the inner face of a bearing shell in the form of an annular cylinder segment, the outer face of which is supported on a horizontal foundation plate. The self-orienting bearing in the form of a circular cylindrical part and the bearing shell or the cylinder segment form as an entity the actual self-orienting bearing for the bedplate. Since the inner face of the cylinder segment is equipped with a sliding surface the self-orienting bearing supporting the bedplate can move along the inner sliding surface of the cylinder segment, and during this movement the cylinder segment carries out a pendulum movement on the foundation. In order that the bedplate and the supporting roller borne by it can carry out an axial displacement corresponding to the axial movement of the rotary drum riding ring, mechanical or hydraulic drive means are provided which can be correspondingly actuated by the riding ring. The two supporting rollers of a supporting roller set can be borne by a common bedplate, a separate self-orienting bearing being disposed below each roller; however, it is also possible to support each of the supporting rollers on a separate bedplate and then to connect the two bedplates to one another by way of clamping cables or clamping rods to absorb expansion forces.<br>
If in the known construction last described (EP-A-0 019 136) the skewing explained above is to be adjusted, then this is obviously only possible by a displacement on the bedplate of the<br><br>
rotary bearing supporting the supporting roller axle. Such a displacement of the rotary bearing of the supporting roller axle on the bedplate requires relatively high construction costs and is only possible with special heavy tools and with a relatively high consumption of time. If in this known construction two separate bedplates are provided for the two supporting rollers, then the clamping rods or the like must be constructed so as to absorb relatively high expansion forces and torsional forces.<br>
The object of the invention is to create a supporting roller set which avoids edge support and at least largely avoids skewing and which with relatively simple design and reliable operation ensure an optimal self-adjustment with easy action of each supporting roller.<br>
Advantageous embodiments and variants of the invention are the subject matter of the subordinate claims.<br>
The invention is based upon the knowledge that a self-adjusting supporting roller of a supporting roller set must, in addition to having a stable running, fulfil at least the following requirements:<br>
a)	The mounting of the tiltable bedplate must have an easy action so that the supporting roller can follow the wobbling deflections of the running surface or of the riding ring of the rotary drum to be supported without high adjusting moments, any remaining edge support being determined by necessary adjusting moments of the bedplate mounting.<br>
b)	Each self-adjusting supporting roller should not react to forces in the direction of the supporting roller axis (axial forces), i.e. the axial forces which are always present should not influence the supporting action.<br><br>
c) Unavoidable self-oscillations (every component has self-oscillations) of the self-adjusting supporting rollers should remain unaffected by forces (or their changes over time) in the contact surface between the rotary drum running surface and the supporting roller, because incitation of self-oscillations by these forces would lead to irregular wear on the outer circumferential surface of the supporting rollers.<br>
Therefore in the supporting roller set according to the invention each bedplate bearing a supporting roller - when viewed transversely with respect to the rotary drum and to the supporting rollers - is supported on the foundation by way of two articulated bearings which are transversely spaced from one another, of which the inner articulated bearing which lies nearer to the vertical longitudinal central axis of the rotary drum is constructed in the form of a ball-and-socket bearing and as a fixed bearing is disposed statically on the foundation, whilst the outer articulated bearing which lies further away from this vertical longitudinal central plane forms a. movable hearing and is supported so as to be slidably movable on the foundation approximately in the shape of an arc of a circle about the central point of the ball of the inner ball-and-socket bearing.<br>
This construction according to the invention facilitates optimal easy-action self-adjustment of each bedplate and thus of the supporting roller borne by this bedplate, wherein the supporting rollers and the bedplates bearing them are stabilised by the running surfaces or riding rings of the rotary drum which are supported on the outer circumferential surfaces, but in this case due to their easy-action tiltability (by way of the articulated bearing) and by way of the approximately arcuate slidably movable support on the foundation they create the precondition so that on the one hand an unwanted edge support is avoided and on the other hand any unwanted skewing of each supporting roller can be stopped quickly and with little work involved by a corresponding sliding movement of the outer articulated bearing on the foundation.<br>
In this case it is particularly advantageous if an adjusting device is provided in the region of the outer articulated bearing and acts on the bedplate in such a way that this bedplate is displaceable in the direction of the arcuate slidably movable support of the outer articulated<br><br>
bearing relative to the foundation and thus the supporting roller borne by it is adjustable or readjustable in the sense of a skewing adjustment relative to the rotary drum running surface.<br>
It is also regarded as advantageous if the two articulated bearings of the or of each bedplate are essentially constructed as axial articulated bearings and if in the normal position of supporting roller and bedplate the central axis of the inner articulated bearing is oriented so that it is inclined with respect to the horizontal, this inclination being determined by the direction of action of the resultant forces acting on the appertaining supporting roller, i.e. this inclination or angled position of the inner ball-and-socket bearing results from the vectorial addition of circumferential forces (e.g. bearing frictional forces and driving forces) and bearing forces on the or each supporting roller.<br>
A mere comparison of this previously described construction according to the invention with last-described known construction (EP-A-0 019 136) makes clear on the one hand the extremely simple and quick possibility for adjustment in the case of skewing of the or each supporting roller, i.e. skewing caused for example by axial forces on the part of the rotary drum can be eliminated in an extremely simple manner and with little consumption of time and energy. On the other hand - in contrast to the said known construction - due to the design according to the invention expansion forces are absorbed by the inner ball-and-socket bearing which is constructed as a fixed bearing, so that no special elements are necessary for absorption of torsional forces.<br>
In so afar as the adjusting device for adjustment of the skewing of the supporting roller is concerned, this can be constructed in a particularly advantageous and simple manner in that it comprises two adjusting screws which lie axially spaced opposite one another, are movable relative to one another and act substantially horizontally, as well as a stop element, the lataal faces of which form stop or contact surfaces for the ends of these screws. Thus the skewing adjustment or the adjustment of each bedplate and of the supporting roller borne by it relative to the rotary drum running surface can be carried out in an extremely simple manner using a very simple hand tool, for example a spanner, and also quickly and with little force.<br><br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail below with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal view, which has been kept quite schematic, of a longitudinal section of a rotary drum which is rotatably supported for example on two supporting roller sets constructed according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a transverse or end view of a supporting roller set according to invention, on an enlarged scale and in section approximately in the right-hand half, approximately corresponding to the section line II-II in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows a side view (approximately corresponding to the arrow III in Figure 2) of a bedplate of the supporting roller set supported by way of a articulated bearings on a foundation;<br>
Figure 4 shows a plan view of a bedplate of the supporting roller set;<br>
Figure 5 shows an enlarged detail approximately corresponding to the portion V in Figure 3 in order to explain an adjusting device for the bedplate;<br>
Figure 6 shows a vertical sectional view through an inner ball-and-socket bearing of the bedplate;<br>
Figure 7 shows a vertical sectional view through an outer ball-and-socket joint of the bedplate;<br>
Figures 8, 9 and 10 shows approximately similar longitudinal side views of three different embodiments of the supporting roller set according to the invention.<br>
First of all, the longitudinal view according to Figure 1 shows quite generally how a rotary drum or a corresponding longitudinal section of a rotary drum 1 is rotatably supported on for example two supporting roller sets 2 constructed according to the invention. It may be<br><br>
assumed for example that this rotary drum 1 is a rotary kiln (with correspondingly large dimensions in terms of diameter and length) which can be driven in rotation about its longitudinal axis Ia in a manner which is known per se and is therefore not illustrated in greater detail. Each supporting roller set 2 can be constructed in substantially the same way, so that in the following description only one of them needs to be explained in detail.<br>
An additional look at the transverse or end view according to Figure 2 makes it clear that the (each) supporting roller set 2 contains two supporting rollers 3 which lie in pairs symmetrically on both sides of a vertical longitudinal plane lb of the rotary drum 1 which extends through the longitudinal axis la, a corresponding running surface of the rotary drum 1 being rotatably supported on the outer circumferential surface or running surface 3 a of each of the said rollers, and this rotary drum running surface is generally formed by a correspondingly reinforced shell portion of the rotary drum 1, but preferably - as in this example - a respective riding ring 4 (or the outer circumferential surface or running surface thereof) mounted in a manner which is known per se on the outer circumference of the rotary drum 1. The widths of the supporting rollers 3 extending in the axial direction and of the riding rings 4 are adapted to one another in the usual way.  Each supporting roller 3 is freely rotatably mounted by way of its supporting roller axle 3 b in two rotary bearings (usual plain bearings or self-orienting roller bearings). This mounting of the supporting roller axles 3b in the rotary bearings 5 can advantageously be floating in a manner which is known per se, so that the supporting roller 3 which is non-rotatably borne by the supporting roller axle can to a limited extent follow axial movements of the rotary drum 1 and riding rings 4 which occur during operation; this limited - floating -axial movability of the supporting rollers 3 and supporting roller axles 3b can be used in the usual way - for example by means of thrust washers - for visual checking, so that in the event of axial forces occurring and causing skewing a corresponding adjusting device can be actuated for elimination of the skewing, and this will be discussed in greater detail below.<br>
Each supporting roller axle 3b and the appertaining supporting roller 3 is fixed by way of its wo rotary bearings 5 on a bedplate 6 which in turn is tiltably supported on a static foundation or foundation base 7. In the illustrated embodiment each supporting roller 3 of a supporting oiler set 2 is disposed on a separate bedplate 6, the two bedplates 6 of the supporting roller<br><br>
set 2 being supported on a common base frame (or a common base plate 8) which in turn is statically disposed on the actual foundation 7, i.e. the common base frame 8 forms a or the part of a static foundation on which the bedplates 6 are directly supported, although the foundation base 7 may also be constructed so that the bedplates 6 could be directly be supported thereon.<br>
A significant idea concerning this (each) supporting roller set 2 is to be seen in the fact that each bedplate 6 (and thus also the supporting roller 3 borne by it) - when viewed transversely with respect to the rotary drum 1 and to the supporting rollers 3, that is to say corresponding to the view according to Figure 2 - is supported on the base frame 8 (and thus also on the static foundation 7) by way of two articulated bearings 9,  10 which are disposed at a corresponding axial spacing QA from one another and which in the illustration according to Figure 2 are to be seen only in the region below the right-hand bedplate 6 (as this is a partial sectional view), whilst in the left-hand half of Figure 2 they are hidden (as this purely an end view).  Of these articulated bearings 9, 10, the articulated bearing 9 which lies closer to the vertical longitudinal central axis lb of the rotary drum 1 is constructed in the form of a ball-and-socket bearing and in this case is disposed as a fixed bearing statically on the base frame 8 (but also directly on the foundation base 7 if need be).   By contrast, the outer articulated bearing 10 which lies further away from this vertical longitudinal central plane lb forms a movable bearing, and in this case this outer articulated bearing 10 is supported on the base frame 8 so as to be slidably movable on the foundation approximately in the shape of an arc of a circle about the central point 9a of the inner ball-and-socket bearing 9, as is indicated by the arcuate double arrow 11 in the plan view according to Figure 4 of the bedplate 6.<br>
In the right-hand half in Figure 2 it can also be seen that a straight line 12 connecting the points of articulation 9a, 10a of the inner articulated bearing 9 and of the outer articulated bearing 10 forms a transversely extending geometric pivot axis which in turn forms a common axis of tilt for these two' articulated bearings 9, 10 and preferably extends substantially approximately horizontally. In this case the appertaining supporting roller together with the bedplate 6 which bears it is then accordingly supported so that it is tiltable about this axis of<br><br>
tilt 12, i.e. according to Figure 2, right-hand half, perpendicular to the drawing plane and according to Figure 3 in the direction of the double arrow 13.<br>
An adjusting device 14 is also of particular importance which is provided in the region of the outer articulated bearing 10 (cf. Figures 3 and 5) and acts on the or each bedplate 6 in such a way that this bedplate 6 can be displaced in the direction of the aforementioned arcuate slidably movable support (double arrow 11) of the outer articulated bearing 10 relative to the static foundation 7 or the base frame 8, as a result of which the supporting roller 3 borne by it can be precisely adjusted in the sense of a skewing adjustment relative to the running surface or to the riding ring 4 of the rotary drum 1.<br>
As can be seen in the enlarged detail view according to Figure 5, for skewing adjustment of the supporting roller 3 (by way of the appertaining bedplate 6) the adjusting device 14 comprises two adjusting screws 15 which lie axially spaced opposite one another, are movable relative to one another and act substantially horizontally, as well as a stop element 16 which is disposed between the opposing ends 15a of these adjusting screws, the lateral faces 16a, 16b of the stop element forming stop or contact surfaces for the ends 15a of these screws. In this case it is regarded as advantageous if the two adjusting screws 15 are fixed (for example welded) on the underside 6a of the bedplate 6 approximately in the region of the outer articulated bearing 10, whilst the stop element 16 is firmly mounted in an approximately upright position on the base frame (as shown in Figure 5) and in this case extends freely with its upper end 16c sufficiently far into the region between the two ends of the adjusting screws 15a, whilst still maintaining sufficient spacing from the underside 6a of the bedplate, so that during the tilting movement of the bedplate 6 it cannot come into contact with this underside 6a.<br>
Whilst the inner articulated bearing 9 of each bedplate 6 is always - as mentioned -constructed in the form of a ball-and-socket bearing, the outer articulated bearing 10 can generally be constructed in any suitable manner which allows a pivotability in a pivot plane 10b lying parallel to the vertical longitudinal central plane 3 c of the supporting roller 3. For this purpose the outer articulated bearing 10 could be construction approximately in the form<br><br>
of a simple hinge bearing (pivot hinge bearing). However, in the present embodiment it is preferred that the outer articulated bearing 10 of the/each bedplate 6 should be constructed in the form of a ball-and-socket bearing (substantially the same as the inner articulated bearing 9).<br>
In so far as the construction and arrangement of the two articulated bearings 9, 10 in the region between the appertaining bedplate 6 and base frame 8 is concerned, both articulated bearings 9, 10 of each bedplate 6 are constructed on the one hand as ball-and-socket bearings (as mentioned) and on the other hand essentially as axial articulated bearings.   The latter is possible due to the fact that in the starting or normal position - substantially shown in the drawings - of the supporting roller 3 and bedplate 6 the central axis 10c of the outer articulated bearing 10 which passes through the central point 10a of the ball is oriented substantially vertically (cf. in particular Figures 3 and 7).  By contrast, the central axis 9c of the inner articulated bearing 9 is oriented at an inclination a with respect to the horizontal H, as can be seen from Figures 3 and 6. This angled position or inclination a is determined by the direction of action of the resultant forces acting on the appertaining supporting roller 3, i.e. from the vectorial addition (e.g. bearing frictional forces and optionally driving forces) as well as bearing forces.  This makes possible the construction of the two articulated bearings 9, 10 of each bedplate 6 as axial articulated bearings, which brings with it a particularly simple and therefore inexpensive design of these articulated bearings 9, 10, which becomes particularly clear when one considers that with another orientation and arrangement these articulated bearings  would  also  have to  absorb  additional  radial  loads,   which would  involve a correspondingly more expensive articulated bearing design. It should be mentioned, however, that the use of articulated  bearings which can be loaded axially and radially is not fundamentally excluded in this design according to the invention.<br>
It can also be seen in Figure 3 that the central point 9a of the inner ball-and-socket bearing 9 is disposed vertically below the contact line 17 between the outer circumferential surface -running surface 3a of the supporting roller 3 and the running surface/riding ring 4 of the rotary drum 1. This has the advantage that axial forces on the supporting roller 3 (and correspondingly also on the bedplate 6) caused by an axial movement of the rotary drum 1<br><br>
cannot exert any influence on the adjusting means 14 for the skewing of the supporting roller 3.<br>
The design of the two ball-and-socket bearings 9 and 10 is shown in greater detail in Figures 6 and 7. First of all it can be generally seen here that both ball-and socket bearings 9, 10 are of substantially the same construction. Accordingly each ball-and-socket bearing 9, 10 is preferably constructed in the form of a spherical segment bearing.<br>
Considering first of all the design of the inner ball-and-socket bearing 9 according to Figure 6, then this ball-and-socket bearing (spherical segment bearing 9) has a first spherical segment part 9.1 which with a convex outer plain bearing surface 9.2 in the shape of a spherical segment is mounted so as to be capable of universal swivelling movement in a concave inner plain bearing surface 9.3., which is in the shape of a spherical segment and like a joint seat, of a second spherical segment part 9.4. These two spherical segment parts 9.1 and 9.4 are of approximately circular construction - as Figure 6 shows clearly - and the first spherical segment part 9.1 is firmly mounted on a type of axle journal 18 which is in turn fixed on a projection 6b of the bedplate 6 which is oriented correspondingly obliquely downwards. The second spherical segment part 9.4 on the other hand is mounted or supported statically - for example by way of a connecting part 9.5 - on a fixing projection 8a of the base frame which is oriented correspondingly obliquely upwards.<br>
Also the outer ball-and-socket bearing (spherical segment bearing) 10 has a first spherical segment part 10.1 which with a convex outer plain bearing surface 10.2 in the shape of a spherical segment is mounted so as to be capable of universal swivelling movement in a concave inner plain bearing surface 10.3, which is in the shape of a spherical segment and like a joint seat, of a second spherical segment part 10.4. Also in this outer ball-and-socket bearing (spherical segment bearing) 10 the two spherical segment parts 10.1 and 10.4 are of circular construction - as can be seen, from Figure 7. However, the second spherical segment part 10.4 of this outer ball-and socket bearing 10 is supported on the base frame 8 not so as to be fixed (as in the case of the inner ball-and-socket bearing 9) but so as to be slidably movable in the direction of the double arrow 1.1 (Figure 4).  This slidably movable support could take<br><br>
place in the simplest form in that connecting part 10.5 which firmly receives the spherical segment part 10.4 is supported with its underside 10.5a directly on a corresponding opposing surface constructed as a sliding abutment on the upper face of the base frame 8.  However, according to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 7 it is preferred that in the region below the connecting part 10.5 a planar approximately plate-like sliding abutment 20 is fixed - optionally replaceably - separately on the upper face of the base frame 8, and the underside 10.5a of the connecting part 10.5 likewise constructed as a sliding surface and thus the lower second spherical segment part 10.4 is supported so as to be slidably movable on the upper face 20a, constructed as a sliding surface, of the sliding abutment.   Thus each sliding abutment 20 is constructed in the form of a substantially flat plain bearing plate. This sliding abutment or this plain bearing plate 20 is advantageously produced from a sliding material with relatively low coefficients of friction, e.g. from grey-cast iron or corresponding plastic material.<br>
In the previously described supporting roller set 2 according to the invention each supporting roller 3 is constructed and disposed in an optimal manner so that it is self-adjusting relative to the appertaining riding ring of the rotary drum 1.  Since these self-adjusting supporting rollers 3 react negatively to axial forces, they should not have any skewing.   For this reason it is advantageous to be able to check the position of the supporting rollers 3 and their supporting roller axles 3 b at least visually - as already mentioned above - so that in the event that skewing of the supporting roller occurs this skewing can be quickly eliminated with the aid of the adjusting device 14 in order to be able to adjust the corresponding supporting roller 3 as far as possible without skewing.   In this case repeated adjustment of the skewing may be necessary due to changed operating conditions of the rotary drum 1 and due to other influences.   The actuation of the described adjusting device 14 for adjustment of the skewing of the supporting rollers has a relatively easy action and is simple.    If the illustration particularly in Figure 5 is considered again in this respect, then the adjusting screws 15 can be constructed as simple hexagonal screws and can be secured in their adjusted position by corresponding lock nuts (as illustrated).   Thus these adjusting screws 15 can be actuated quickly and without special cost with the aid of a suitable spanner.<br><br>
As is known per se in the art, the supporting rollers 3 of supporting roller sets 2 for rotary drums 1 can be constructed merely as bearing or supporting rollers or also as drivable supporting rollers. Examples of these are explained below with reference to the embodiment according to the invention of a supporting roller set as shown in Figures 8, 9 and 10.<br>
From the previous explanations of the construction according to the invention of the or each supporting roller set 2 and also from the corresponding previous figures of the drawings it is already basically apparent that the central axes 9c, 10c (or their corresponding upper central portions) of the upper articulated bearing parts which are tillable together with the appertaining bedplate 6, that is to say the first spherical segment parts 9.1 and 10.1, of both articulated bearings 9, 10 lie in a common reference plane which extends perpendicular to the bedplate 6 and is oriented at right angles to the vertical longitudinal central plane 3 c (Figure 2) of the appertaining supporting roller 3.<br>
If in this case each supporting roller 3 is constructed corresponding to the representation in Figure 8 as a mere support bearing roller, then the appertaining supporting roller axle 3b is mounted with its ends in the two rotary bearings 5 which are disposed on both sides of the symmetrical vertical transverse central plane 3d of the supporting roller. In this construction (Figure 8) of the supporting roller 3 the above-mentioned reference plane 21 for the upper articulated bearing parts 9.1, 10.1 of the articulated bearings 9, 10 coincides with the symmetrical vertical transverse central plane 3d of the supporting roller 3, because the supporting roller 3 with the supporting roller axle 3b, the two rotary bearings 5, the bedplate 6 and the articulated bearings 9, 10 form an equilibrium system with respect to the transverse central plane 3d.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in Figure 9 operates in principle in a similar manner, in that a supporting roller 3 is constructed so as to be drivable, and flanged on to the two ends 3bi and 3b2 of this supporting roller 3 is a reduction drive motor 22, 23 which is preferably a hydraulic motor in each case but can basically be a corresponding electric motor. The difference between this embodiment according to Figure 9 and the embodiment according to Figure 8 merely resides in the fact that a similar drive motor 22, 23 is mounted on both ends of the<br><br><br><br>
supporting roller, so that here too an equilibrium system is produced on both sides of the symmetrical vertical transverse central plane 3d of the supporting roller. As a result the reference plane 21 explained above can again coincide with the previously mentioned transverse central plane 3d of the supporting roller 3. Not only in the example according to Figure 8 but also in the example according to Figure 9 constructions are therefore produced which are structurally symmetrical and which are easy to manage with regard to torques and tilting moments which occur.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 10 differs from those according to Figures 8 and 9 in that in an otherwise identical construction a reduction drive motor 22 is flanged on only at one<br><br>
end 3b1of the supporting roller; therefore the supporting roller 3 is likewise constructed so as to be drivable. Since in this embodiment (Figure 10) to a certain extent a disequilibrium is produced with regard to the symmetrical vertical transverse central plane 3d of the supporting roller 3 due to the unilateral motor drive, a corresponding balancing must be ensured in view of the tiltable support of the bedplate 6 (by way of the articulated bearings 9., 10 on the base frame 8). For this reason in this third embodiment (Figure 10) the reference plane 21 containing the central axes of the upper articulated bearing parts of both articulated bearings 9, 10 is displaced parallel to the symmetrical vertical transverse central plane 3d of the supporting roller 3 by a balancing distance A.<br><br>
