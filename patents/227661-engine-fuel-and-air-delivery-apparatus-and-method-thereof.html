Field of the Invention<br>
The disclosed invention is related to air and fuel supply systems for internal<br>
combustion engines and, particularly, to a fuel injector combined with a carburetor<br>
that is modified such that the carburetor provides only air to the engine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The performance of an internal combustion engine is dependent on a number<br>
of factors including the operating cycle (e.g., two-stroke having 360 degrees of<br>
crankshaft rotation per cycle, four-stroke having 720 degrees of crankshaft rotation<br>
per cycle, orWankel), the fuel type (e.g., gasoline ordiesel) the number and design<br>
of combustion chambers, the selection and control of ignition and fuel delivery<br>
systems, and the ambient conditions in which the engine operates. Examples of<br>
design choices for a combustion chamber are believed to include choosing a<br>
compression ratio and choosing the numbers of intake and exhaust valves<br>
associated with each chamber.<br>
With regard to fuel delivery systems, carburetors and fuel injection systems<br>
are known. Those known systems supply a quantity of fuel, (e.g., gasoline and air),<br>
in accordance with the position of the throttle as set by the operator. In the case of<br>
carburetors, fuel is often delivered by a system of orficies, known as "jets." As<br>
examples of carburetor operation, an idle jet may supply fuel downstream of a<br>
throttle valve at engine idling speeds, and that fuel delivery may be boosted by an<br>
accelerator pump to facilitate rapid increases in engine load.<br><br>
Known fuel injection systems, which can be operated electronically, spray a<br>
precisely metered amount of fuel into the intake system or directly into the<br>
combustion cylinder. The fuel quantity is typically determined by a controller based<br>
on the state of the engine and a data table known as a "map" or "look-up table." The<br>
map typically includes a collection of possible values or "setpoints" for each of at<br>
least one independent variable (i.e., a characteristic of the state of the engine), which<br>
can be measured by a sensor connected to the controller, and a collection of<br>
corresponding control values, for a dependent variable control function, e.g., fuel<br>
quantity.<br>
Further, engine performance is substantially dependent on how combustion is<br>
accomplished in the ambient conditions. The stoichiometric mass fraction ratio of air<br>
to gasoline is approximately 14.7:1. However, it is believed that ratios from about<br>
10:1 to about 20:1 will combust, and that it is often desirable to adjust the air-fuel<br>
ratio ("AFR") to achieve specific engine performance (e.g., a certain level of power<br>
output, better fuel economy, or reduced emissions). Properly calibrating the fuel<br>
delivery system of the engine to deliver the optimum AFR under all operating<br>
conditions is important to optimum engine operation.<br>
Vehicles are commonly manufactured having carburetors. Often, those<br>
carburetors provide high quality air flow control through, for example, a butterfly or<br>
gate type air valve. Those carburetors, however, may not provide high quality fuel<br>
delivery through a float bowl and jets. For example, an amount of fuel supplied<br>
through a fuel injector may change more rapidly in response to throttle position than<br>
the amount of fuel supplied through a float bowl and jets.<br>
Because the quality of fuel delivery provided by a carburetor is often not as<br>
great as fuel injectors, vehicle owners desiring high quality fuel delivery often replace<br>
vehicle carburetors with throttle body fuel injectors that deliver both fuel and air to the<br>
vehicle engine. Such replacement is, however, typically expensive both in the cost<br>
of replacement parts and labor to perform the replacement. The air delivery<br>
component of the throttle body fuel injector may, furthermore, constitute a large part<br>
of the cost of replacement parts. Thus, there is a need for an apparatus and method<br>
that provides fuel injection in a carbureted engine system.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a fuel injector adapter is<br>
contemplated. The fuel injector adapter includes a coupling having a first end and a<br>
second end and forming a combustion air passageway therethrough. The first end is<br>
adapted for coupling adjacent a carburetor combustion air passage 101. The fuel<br>
injector adapter also includes a fuel injector mount formed on the coupling and<br>
forming a fuel injector passageway passing through the fuel injector mount and<br>
coupling and into which a fuel injector may be inserted.<br>
A plate fashioned for attachment to a carburetor to prevent flow of air and fuel<br>
through a float bowl is also contemplated.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a throttle and fuel injection device<br>
is contemplated. That throttle and fuel injection device includes a carburetor and a<br>
fuel injector. The carburetor forms a combustion air passage through which<br>
combustion air is provided to the engine and through which fuel is not provided to the<br>
engine. The fuel injector is disposed in fluid communication with the combustion air<br>
passage and fuel is provided to the engine therethrough.<br>
A method of providing combustion air and fuel to an engine is also<br>
contemplated. That method includes metering combustion air flow delivered to the<br>
engine through a carburetor and metering fuel delivered to the engine through a fuel<br>
injector in fluid communication with the carburetor.<br>
In addition, an article of manufacture is contemplated. The article of<br>
manufacture includes a computer readable medium having instructions stored<br>
thereon. The instructions cause a processor to control combustion air flow through a<br>
carburetor and control fuel delivery through a fuel injector in fluid communication with<br>
the carburetor when executed.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It is to<br>
be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention included<br>
herein illustrate and describe elements that are of particular relevance to the present<br>
invention, while eliminating, for purpose of clarity, other elements found in typical<br>
engines, carburetors and fuel injectors. It is also to be understood that the preferred<br>
embodiments described herein are not exhaustive of embodiments of the invention,<br>
but are provided as examples of configurations and uses of the invention.<br>
The throttle and fuel injection devices and techniques described herein<br>
provide solutions to the shortcomings of certain fuel delivery systems. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in engine control technology will readily appreciate that the devices and<br>
techniques, while described in connection with certain engines and fuel delivery<br>
systems, are equally applicable to other engine and fuel delivery systems, wherein<br>
air and fuel are delivered to the engine. Other details, features, and advantages of<br>
the throttle and fuel injection devices and techniques and the user interface will<br>
become further apparent in the following detailed description of the embodiments.<br>
Any reference in the specification to "one embodiment," "a certain<br>
embodiment," or a similar reference to an embodiment is intended to indicate that a<br>
particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the<br>
embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The<br>
appearances of such terms in various places in the specification are not necessarily<br>
all referring to the same embodiment. References to "or" are furthermore intended<br>
as inclusive so "or" may indicate one or the other ored terms or more than one ored<br>
term.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention includes a throttle and fuel injection<br>
apparatus and method that provides combustion air for an internal combustion<br>
engine through a carburetor and for providing fuel to that internal combustion engine<br>
through a fuel injector. The method includes blocking all fuel passages leading into<br>
the carburetor and adding a fuel injector to the carburetor. Combustion air is thereby<br><br>
directed into the internal combustion engine through the carburetor while fuel is<br>
directed into the internal combustion engine through the fuel injector.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an exploded view of an embodiment of an unmodified<br>
carburetor 100 that may be utilized in the present invention. The carburetor<br>
illustrated is appropriate for use on a motorcycle or all terrain vehicle, however,<br>
various other carburetors may alternately be used in connection with the invention.<br>
The carburetor has a carburetor inlet 102 to which, for example, an inlet connector<br>
(not shown) may be attached to attach the carburetor inlet 102 to an air cleaner and<br>
a combustion air source. A carburetor outlet 106 is shown opposite the carburetor<br>
inlet 102. An outlet connector 107 that is depicted in Figure 2 may, for example, be<br>
used to connect the carburetor 100 to an engine intake port (not shown). The<br>
carburetor inlet 102 and carburetor outlet 106 form a combustion air passage 101<br>
through which combustion air may pass. A throttle (not shown) is disposed in the<br>
combustion air passage 101 to control air flow therethrough.<br>
A float bowl 108 regulates the amount of fuel flow from a fuel tank (not shown)<br>
into the carburetor 100. The float bowl in the depicted embodiment attaches to the<br>
carburetor 100 by way of bolts 109 and may be sealed to the carburetor 100 utilizing<br>
a gasket 121 compressed between the carburetor 100 and float bowl 108. Fuel<br>
flows into the float bowl 108 through a fuel inlet 110. A float 122 is attached to the<br>
float bowl 108 by way of a float pin 123, and may be raised and lowered by the level<br>
of the fuel in the float bowl 108 to permit or prevent fuel from flowing into the float<br>
bowl 108 as desired. From the float bowl 108, a needle valve 124 operates in<br>
conjunction with one or more jets, such as an idle jet 125 and a main jet 126 to<br>
regulate the flow of fuel into the combustion air stream that flows through the<br>
carburetor 100. A spacer 128 may also be utilized. A throttle position sensor (not<br>
shown) may be attached to the depicted carburetor 100 and may be used to<br>
communicate the desired load that the operator wishes to impose upon the engine to<br>
the carburetor 100 such that appropriate fuel and air will be permitted to flow through<br>
the carburetor 100 and into the engine. The throttle position sensor may also<br>
communicate the desired load to the engine control unit 460 illustrated in Figure 11.<br><br>
The carburetor 100 is an analog device used to regulate air and fuel flow into<br>
an engine. To regulate the fuel flow accurately, the carburetor 100 may require<br>
atmospheric pressure to be present at various locations 117. Tubes 118 may be<br>
attached to the carburetor 100 at a throttle connection 132 to assure that<br>
atmospheric pressure is present at each of those locations 117. Those tubes 118<br>
may be attached to ports 120 at the desired locations 117 by way of clamps 119.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the carburetor 100 of Figure 1 with additional components<br>
that may be attached to the carburetor 100. One or more throttle cables 131 may<br>
attach to the carburetor 100 and be actuated by an operator by actuating the throttle<br>
control (not shown). A throttle cable cover 130 may be attached to the carburetor<br>
100 by bolts 133 to cover the throttle cables 131. The throttle cables 131 control the<br>
opened to closed position of a throttle (not shown) inside the carburetor 100. The<br>
throttle may, for example, be a butterfly type or a slide type throttle. The closed<br>
throttle position would be appropriate for an engine at a no load condition, such as<br>
when idling. As the operator adjusts the throttle control to increase the engine load,<br>
the throttle moves gradually from its closed position to a wide open position. A<br>
throttle position wire 135 that provides an electronic throttle position signal to, for<br>
example, an engine control unit 460 as shown in Figure 11 may also be provided to<br>
the carburetor 100.<br>
Figure 2 also illustrates attachment of a fuel line 140 to the carburetor 100 at<br>
110 and other components for attaching the carburetor to a combustion air intake<br>
and an engine. An inlet clamp 104 is disposed at the carburetor inlet 102 to attach<br>
the carburetor inlet 102 to, for example, an air cleaner or an inlet connector (not<br>
shown). An outlet clamp 142 is depicted at the carburetor outlet 106 to attach the<br>
carburetor outlet 106 to the outlet connector 107. An engine clamp 144 is disposed<br>
to attach the outlet connector 107 to a combustion air and fuel inlet of the engine.<br>
A choke 112 is also depicted on the carburetor 100. The choke 112 may be<br>
manipulated to enrich the fuel to facilitate, for example, cold engine starts. A hot<br>
start may also be provided at 114 to regulate fuel or air flow to facilitate engine starts<br>
when the engine is hot.<br><br>
Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of a fuel injector adapter 200 of the<br>
present invention. The fuel injector adapter 200 may permit disposition of a fuel<br>
injector 216 in a desired position in an engine fuel and air supply system where that<br>
fuel injector 216 was not previously disposed. The fuel injector adapter 200 includes<br>
a fuel injector mount 202 and a fuel injector coupling 204. A clamp such as the inlet<br>
clamp 104 or the outlet clamp 142 may be used to connect the fuel injector coupling<br>
204 to the carburetor outlet 106 or the carburetor inlet 102 and another clamp such<br>
as the engine clamp 144 may be utilized to attach the fuel injector coupling 204 to<br>
the engine intake.<br>
The fuel injector coupling 204 forms an inlet passageway 208. The inlet<br>
passageway 208 may be a smooth unobstructed airtight passageway through which<br>
air or fuel and air may pass. The inlet passageway 208 may also be of<br>
approximately the same cross-sectional area as the combustion air passage 101 to<br>
minimize the restriction of airflow through the fuel injector coupling 204. The fuel<br>
injector coupling 204 and fuel injector mount 202 may be fabricated from nylon such<br>
that they form a rigid airtight connection to the carburetor 100 when coupled to the<br>
carburetor 100. Alternately, the fuel injector coupling 204 and fuel injector mount<br>
202 may be fabricated from a metal, plastic, rubber or another rigid or semi-rigid<br>
material. Where one end of the fuel injector coupling 204 is attached to the<br>
carburetor outlet 106, the opposite end of the fuel injector coupling 204 may be<br>
attached to the intake port of the engine. Where one end of the fuel injector coupling<br>
204 is attached to the carburetor inlet 102, the other end of the fuel injector coupling<br>
204 may be attached to an air cleaner or may be exposed directly to the<br>
atmosphere. Other configurations including, for example, connection of the inlet<br>
connector to tubes leading to an engine inlet or combustion air source are also<br>
contemplated.<br>
Figure 4 depicts the fuel injector adapter 200 with a view into the fuel injector<br>
mount 202 from an exterior surface 230 of the fuel injector adapter 200. A fuel<br>
injector passageway 210 passes through the fuel injector mount 202 and the fuel<br>
injector coupling 204 to permit a fuel injector 216 to be inserted therethrough, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 6. The fuel injector 216 may, thus, spray fuel into the inlet<br>
passageway 208 to be delivered to the engine intake. The fuel injector mount 202<br><br>
may have an irregular shape to orient the fuel injector 216 that is inserted into the<br>
fuel injector mount 202 in a desired position. The fuel injector mount 202 may also<br>
include a hole 214 that allows a clamp (not shown) to secure the injector 216 in the<br>
fuel injector mount 202.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the fuel injector adapter 200 with a view into the fuel<br>
injector mount 202 from the interior surface 232 of the fuel injector mount 202. As<br>
may be seen, the fuel injector passageway 210 is open to permit fuel from the fuel<br>
injector to be injected into the inlet passageway 208.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the fuel injector adapter 200 as viewed from the exterior<br>
surface 230 of the fuel injector mount 202, with a fuel injector 216 inserted into the<br>
fuel injector mount 202. The fuel injector 216 may be a commercially available fuel<br>
injector and may include a pressurized fuel inlet port 218 and an electronic solenoid<br>
connector terminal 220. The solenoid connector terminals 220 may be attached to<br>
an output of an engine control unit such as the engine control unit 460 depicted in<br>
Figure 11. That engine control unit 460 may control fuel flow to the engine through<br>
the fuel injector 216 when the high pressure fuel inlet port 218 is attached to a<br>
regulated fuel supply, such as the fuel supply 450 illustrated in Figure 11.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the fuel injector adapter 200 as viewed from the interior<br>
surface 232 of the fuel injector mount 202, with a fuel injector 216 inserted into the<br>
fuel injector mount 202. As may be seen in Figure 7, the fuel injector mount 202<br>
may be angled into the fuel injector adapter 200 to direct fuel provided from the fuel<br>
injector 216 to be targeted to the engine intake port.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates an outside and side view of a float bowl eliminator 300.<br>
Because the present invention does not necessitate use of the float bowl 108 in the<br>
carburetor 100, the float bowl 108 may be removed and an airtight plate such as the<br>
float bowl eliminator 300 or other apparatus may be connected to the carburetor 100<br>
in place of the float bowl 108. Replacing the float bowl 108 with the float bowl<br>
eliminator 300 beneficially prevents air or fuel from flowing through the float bowl<br>
108. Replacement of the float bowl 108 with the float bowl eliminator 300 also opens<br>
space previously occupied by the float bowl 108 in which other components may be<br>
fitted. For example the fuel injector 216 may be angled into the area previously<br><br><br>
f<br>
occupied by the float bowl 108 for proper targeting of fuel. Moreover, other fuel<br>
supply components, such as a fuel pump 458, pressure regulator 454, or fuel filter<br>
456, illustrated in Figure 11, may be located in the space freed by removal of the<br>
float bowl 108. The present invention may, however, operate with the float bowl 108<br>
remaining intact, and thus does not require replacing the float bowl 108 with the float<br>
bowl eliminator 300.<br>
Figure 9 depicts an inside and side view of the float bowl eliminator 300 of<br>
Figure 8, having an inner surface 314. The float bowl eliminator 300 may be formed<br>
in any configuration suitable for the carburetor 100 to be modified. In the example<br>
illustrated in Figures 9 and 10, the float bowl eliminator 300 is a plate having a<br>
depression 302 in the outside surface 310 and an idle adjustment device bracket 304<br>
formed on the outside surface 310 of the float bowl eliminator 300. An idle<br>
adjustment device (not shown) may thus be conveniently attached to the idle<br>
adjustment bracket 304 if desired. A carburetor ring bracket 312 may be formed on<br>
the inside surface 314 to accept a ring (not shown) that is the same diameter as the<br>
carburetor intake 104 and carburetor outlet 106. Such a ring is commonly used with<br>
split-style throttles as a guide in which the throttle may slide.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates an embodiment of a throttle and fuel injector assembly<br>
400 of the present invention. The throttle and fuel injector assembly 400 includes a<br>
modified carburetor 401, a fuel injector adapter 200 having a fuel injector 216<br>
disposed therein, and a float bowl eliminator 300. The modified carburetor 401<br>
depicted in that embodiment is a modified version of the carburetor 100 depicted in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. The modified carburetor 401 retains airflow control components of<br>
the carburetor 100 while eliminating fuel delivery components of the carburetor 100.<br>
As may be seen in Figure 10, the float bowl 108 has been removed in the<br>
modified carburetor 401 and the float bowl eliminator 300 has been attached to<br>
modified carburetor 401 in place of the float bowl 108. Tubes 118 have been<br>
removed from the modified carburetor 401 and the ports 420 have been sealed by,<br>
for example, capping or plugging them to prevent air leakage therethrough.<br>
Moreover, the choke 112 has been removed and a plug 408 has been installed in its<br>
place. The throttle position wire 135 has been retained and the throttle position<br><br>
cables 131 may also or alternately be retained to control the positioning of the<br>
throttle. Moreover the throttle has been retained in the modified carburetor 401 and<br>
the carburetor inlet 402, as well as the carburetor outlet 406 have all been retained.<br>
The purpose of the modifications made, including attachment of the float bowl<br>
eliminator 300 and inclusion of the of the sealing plug 408 and the sealing of the<br>
ports 420, is to minimize air leakage into and out of the modified carburetor 401,<br>
thereby making the modified carburetor 401 a more accurate airflow control device.<br>
The present invention may be utilized with any known carburetor. Where a<br>
slide-type carburetor is utilized, the invention retains the beneficial opening<br>
characteristics of the slide throttle and the superior wide open flow characteristics of<br>
the slide throttle. It has also been found that positioning the fuel injector 216 at the<br>
bottom of the fuel injector adapter 200 and thus targeting injected fuel into the<br>
bottom of the airstream is beneficial when utilizing the present invention with a slide<br>
throttle. That bottom positioning has been found to create less stratification of fuel in<br>
the combustion airstream and better distribution of fuel in the airstream. That may<br>
be due to the normal operation of a slide throttle, which permits combustion air to<br>
flow through the bottom of the combustion air passage 101 as it opens from a closed<br>
position, thus creating better mixture of fuel injected at the bottom of the fuel injector<br>
adapter 200 with the combustion air entering at the bottom of the combustion air<br>
passage 101. Fuel injection timing, which may be controlled by an engine control<br>
unit 460 as illustrated in Figure 11 may also be important to optimize combustion of<br>
the air and fuel mixture in the engine.<br>
In Figure 10, the fuel injector adapter 200 has been attached to the modified<br>
carburetor outlet 406. As was previously noted, the fuel injector adapter 200 may<br>
alternately be attached to the modified carburetor inlet 402. It has been found that<br>
the fuel spray can be well targeted toward the engine intake when the fuel injector is<br>
located downstream of the modified carburetor 401, (i.e., at the outlet 406 of the<br>
modified carburetor 401). The fuel injector 216 depicted may in turn be connected to<br>
a regulated fuel supply such as the regulated fuel supply 450 shown in Figure 11.<br>
The modified carburetor 401 may include an inlet connector (not shown), that<br>
differs in length from a stock inlet connector that may have attached the carburetor<br><br>
100 in stock form to a combustion air source such as an air cleaner. The fuel<br>
injector adapter 200 in the illustrated embodiment has been lengthened from the<br>
length of the original outlet connector (not shown) that attached the carburetor 100 to<br>
the engine intake port (not shown). Accordingly, the length of the inlet connector<br>
may be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which the fuel injector adapter<br>
200 has been lengthened over the stock outlet connector so that the throttle and fuel<br>
injector assembly 400 will fit in the same space that the carburetor 100 and its<br>
connectors originally occupied.<br>
The throttle of the modified carburetor 401 may be operated to open and<br>
close in the same manner as the throttle of the unmodified carburetor 100. Thus,<br>
airflow in the throttle and fuel injector assembly 400 is controlled in a manner like air<br>
flow is controlled in the carburetor 100, while fuel in the throttle and fuel injector<br>
assembly 400 is provided by the fuel injector 116.<br>
Figure 11 depicts a fuel supply system 450 that may be utilized in connection<br>
with the throttle and fuel injector assembly 400. Fuel is provided to the fuel injector<br>
216 from a fuel tank (not shown) through a fuel supply line 452. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated, that fuel flowing from the fuel tank to the fuel injector 216 flows through a<br>
pressure regulator 454, a fuel filter 456, and a fuel pump 458. Various standard<br>
commercially available pressure regulators 454, fuel filters 456, and fuel pumps 458<br>
may be selected as desired for the engine application used in connection with the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure 11 also illustrates an engine control unit 460. Such an engine control<br>
unit 460 may be utilized to control operation of the fuel injector 216 and, if desired,<br>
the throttle. An unmodified carburetor 100 may include electronic control or may be<br>
a purely mechanically controlled device. In a purely mechanically controlled<br>
carburetor control, particularly during a transition from one throttle position to another<br>
throttle position, can be difficult and add complexity to the throttle control system.<br>
Fuel injected systems typically are controlled by an engine control unit 460 and may<br>
take into consideration various sensed data to provide excellent fuel control even<br>
during throttle transitions. For example, in addition to throttle position, engine speed<br>
may be sensed by an engine control unit 460. Utilization of those signals and<br><br>
possibly even historic values of those signals can provide excellent fuel control even<br>
during transitions in throttle position. The engine control unit may alternately or in<br>
addition sense combustion air flow by, for example, a mass air flow sensor located in<br>
the combustion air intake to control or improve control of the quantity of fuel injected.<br>
Again alternately or in addition, a sensor disposed in the exhaust gas ejected from<br>
the engine, such as a lambda sensor or oxygen sensor, may provide may be used to<br>
control or improve control of the quantity of fuel injected by providing information<br>
regarding the efficiency of previous combustion cycles.<br>
In one embodiment, the engine control unit 460 receives inputs from sensors<br>
that indicate engine desired load and engine speed. In the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figure 11, engine desired load is sensed by way of the throttle position sensor and is<br>
communicated by way of a throttle position wire 135. Engine load could be sensed<br>
in various ways including, for example, by sensing pressure or vacuum in the inlet<br>
passageway 208. Engine speed may be sensed in various ways including use of a<br>
toothed wheel (not shown) or an engine encoder (not shown).<br>
The engine control unit 460 includes a processor and memory. Program<br>
instructions and maps may be stored in the memory. The program instructions may<br>
be in the form of software loaded into the engine control unit 460 from, for example,<br>
a disk 462. Those instructions may furthermore determine from the sensed desired<br>
load and engine speed the amount of fuel and combustion air to be provided to the<br>
engine through the throttle and, if desired, the fuel injector assembly 400. The<br>
engine control unit 460 may then operate the fuel injector 216 and the modified<br>
carburetor 401 to provide the desired quantities of fuel and combustion air.<br>
