				<td>ROTATING BLOWOUT PREVENTER<br>
This invention relates to rotating blowout preventers, sometimes called rotating drilling heads or rotating kelly packers generally, and in particular to apparatus for and a method of connecting and disconnecting the rotating assembly of a rotating blowout preventer to and from the non-rotating body that is attached to the blowout preventer stack.<br>
Rotating blowout preventers seal tightly around kellys, drill pipe, drill collars, tubing or casing and are used for drilling in areas susceptible to kicks or blowouts, for drilling under pressure, for drilling with reverse circulation and when circulating with natural gas or air. They can be used for drilling with pressure in the well. They will also allow pipe to be stripped in and out of the hole with pressure in the well. These situations where operations are being conducted under pressure are referred to as "under balance" drilling as opposed to balanced drilling where the mud system is balanced and there is no need for seals between the drill pipe, kelly,<br><br>
etc., to prevent fluid from the well bore from flowing upwardly past the mud return line.<br>
Rotating blowout preventers generally include a stationary body that is mounted on top of the blowout preventer stack and a removable rotating spindle assembly that is latched into the body and has a rotating portion that rotates with the kelly during drilling operation. The rotating spindle assembly includes a stripper rubber that provides a seal between the rotating spindle assembly and the kelly or drill pipe. Whenever it is necessary to remove the entire rotating spindle assembly, it can be released from the housing and moved upwardly with the kelly to allow a joint of pipe to be added to the drill string or replacement of the rotating spindle asembly by either another rotating spindle assembly or a flanged riser. In rotating blowout preventers presently used, the rotating assembly is bolted or clamped to the housing, which makes the releasing and reconnecting the rotating spindle assembly to the housing time-consuming and complicated.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide improved means for releasing the rotating spindle assembly of a rotating blowout preventer from the housing and for reconnecting the rotating spindle assembly to the housing simply by rotating the rotating spindle assembly relative to the housing a short distance in opposite directions.<br>
It is a further object and a feature of this invention to provide such a release mechanism that includes a simple and convenient manner of locking the release mechanism so<br><br><br><br>
through the rotating spindle assembly housing and is connected at its lower end to stripper rubber 24.<br>
Sleeve 22 is connected at its upper end to upper drive bushing assembly 26. This assembly includes collar 28 that is attached to sleeve 22 by bolt 27 and drive ring 29 that is attached to sleeve 22 by threads 29a. Kelly bushing 30 is - attached to collar 28 by cap screws 31. The kelly bushing is provided with a hex or a square opening 32 through which the kelly extends. Whether it is a hex or a square opening will depend upon the kelly, of course, but this provides a drive connection between the kelly and the rotating spindle assembly so that the rotating spindle assembly will rotate with the kelly. Upper and lower bearings 34 and 36 support the spindle assembly for rotation relative to stationary body 20 of the spindle assembly.<br>
In accordance with this invention, rotating spindle assembly 18 is held in body 10 of the rotating blowout preventer by lugs 40, four of which are shown in this embodiment. These lugs are integrally attached to the outside of housing 20. The rotating spindle assembly is locked in the housing by lowering the assembly into opening 11 of body 10 with lugs 4 0 passing through vertical slots 42 in annular housing ring 37 mounted on the top of body 10 by bolts 39, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. When the lugs reach bottom 42a of the vertical slots, they are then moved<br><br>
laterally into horizontal grooves 44 in housing ring 37. The lugs are held in the horizontal grooves 42 by lock pin 46.<br>
This is a very convenient and simple structural arrangement and method whereby the rotating spindle assembly of the rotating blowout preventer can be released from-body 10 by simply removing lock pin 46, rotating the assembly until the lugs are in alignment with vertical slots 42, then the entire assembly can be raised with the kelly to make a connection on a trip. After the connection is made, the whole assembly is lowered back into body 10 with lugs 40 traveling through vertical slots 42, the rotating spindle assembly is then rotated to move lugs 40 into the horizontal grooves 44. The assembly is then locked in the body by inserting pin 46 into one of the vertical slots behind the lug in the horizontal slot to prevent the lugs from moving out of the horizontal slots until the pin is removed.<br>
From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all of the ends and objects hereinabove set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the apparatus and structure.<br>
It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without<br><br>
reference to other features and subcombinations.  This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.<br>
Because many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br><br><br>
We claim:-<br>
1.	A rotating blowout preventer comprising a tubular body for mounting on a blowout preventer stack, said body having a central, vertical opening into which upwardly flowing fluid from the well bore is received and a lateral flow line through which fluid flowing upwardly from the well bore can flow laterally out of the blowout preventer body, a rotating spindle assembly having a spindle housing for mounting in the blowout preventer body, a spindle tube, and a stripper rubber to provide a seal between the spindle assembly and the portion of pipe string extending through the spindle assembly for rotating with the pipe string to divert fluid flowing upwardly into the Kelly packer housing laterally out of the housing through the lateral flow line, and means for holding the spindle housing in the blowout preventer body having lugs carried by the rotating spindle housing for movement into horizontal grooves in the blowout preventer body to hold the rotating spindle assembly in the body and movable into alignment with vertical slots that intersect the horizontal grooves to release the rotating spindle assembly to allow the rotating spindle assembly to be moved upwardly out of the blowout preventer body.<br>
2.	The rotating blowout preventer as claimed in claim 1 wherein it is provided with a locking bar for positioning in a vertical slot to lock the lungs in the horizontal grooves.<br>
3.	The rotating blowout preventer as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein it is provided with a Kelly bushing attached to the rotating spindle assembly having an opening through which the Kelly extends that has a shape that mates with the shape of the Kelly to prevent relative rotation between the Kelly and the bushing to cause the rotating spindle assembly to rotate with the Kelly.<br>
4.	A method of connecting and releasing the rotating spindle assembly of a rotating blowout preventer to and from the preventer body by moving lugs attached to the rotating spindle assembly downwardly through vertical slots in the body of the preventer and laterally into horizontal grooves to connect the rotating spindle<br><br>
assembly in the body and laterally out of the horizontal grooves and upwardly through the vertical slots to release the rotating spindle assembly from the preventer body.<br>
5.	rotating blowout preventer substantially as herein described with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
6.	A method of connecting and releasing the rotating spindle assembly of a rotating<br>
blowout preventer substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.</td>
