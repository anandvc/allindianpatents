				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A brushless permanent magnet electric machine with a fixed radial air gap is operated to a much higher speed than normal maximum speed by the reduction in effective magnet pole strength. Increasing the amount of axial misalignment of the permanent magnet rotor and constant velocity bearing proportionally increases the speed and reduces the torque. The permanent magnet rotor is offset axially to provide axial misalignment between the rotor magnet poles and the stator, reducing the effective magnet pole strength or flux to the stator. An integral constant velocity linear bearing is used to couple the movable rotor and the fixed position motor shaft. A thrust bearing is actuated to offset the magnetic rotor against the attractive magnetic forces toward the stator. The use of a constant velocity linear bearing allows the motor shaft, radial support bearings, position encoder, cooling fan, and output coupling to remain in a constant position while rotor position is offset.</td>

				<td>BRUSHLESS PERMANENT MAGNET MOTOR OR ALTERNATOR<br>
WITH VARIABLE AXIAL ROTOR/STATOR ALIGNMENT<br>
TO INCREASE SPEED CAPABILITY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to permanent magnet electric machines of the radial air gap type. More particularly, the present invention relates to permanent magnet electric machines of the radial air gap type in which the axial alignment of the rotor and stator can be varied to control speed and applied torque.<br>
Background Art<br>
Permanent: magnet electric machines are known to be efficient producers/users of rotational power. Brushless permanent magnet machines eliminate the commutator and brushes that are commonly used with an electric controller that switches current to conductors in more conventional electric machines. The brushless electric controllers used in permanent magnet electric machines allow the conductor coils to be located in stationary motor stators, which react to movement of rotors containing permanent magnets.<br>
Brushless permanent electrical machines are known for their durability, controllability, and absence of electrical sparking. These factors pose problems in commutator equipped electrical machines. When .1 brushless motor is driven by a power source, such as in vehicle regenerative braking or wind powered generators, the motor becomes a permanent magnet alternator.<br>
Unlike many other types of elscnric&amp;i machines, permanent magnet electrical machines have a linear relationship between the product of BMF (voltage) a current (amps) and output torque. This characteristic is ideal for -the fraction loads of electric vehicles and other applications where a linear torque/speed, relationship simplifies control.<br>
Conventional permanent magnet machines can apply high output terques up to a an rpm limt called the base speed.  The base speed rpm is governed by the phenomena of permanent magnet machines building UP "back-emf" electrical potentials as rotational speeds increase.  The back-emf is governed by the magnetic gap flux density, number of winding turns, and rotational speed.   As the relational speed of a permanent magnet machine increases, the back-emf will build up until it equals the supplied voltage.   Once the back-emf equals the supplied voltage, permanent magnet machines will not operate any  faster.    This  back-emt  rpm  limiting  characteristic protects permanent magnet machines from the over speed damage that is common with series would electrical machines used in vehicle applications.  The back-emf base speed characteristic that protects permanent magnet machines also tends to limit the dynamic rpm range.<br>
In order to accelerate from rest or from low speeds, many electric vehicles have a fixed reduction drive ratio that is set for high torque. While such configurations provide the necessary high torque to overcome inertia, it results in a low base speed and a limited top speed. In addition to a low speed, constant terque operation, it is desirable for many motor vehicles to also have an upper range of constant power, where speed can increase with decreased torque requirements.<br>
There are methods by which to operate a brushless permanent magnet motor or other motor type beyond the base speed. These methods can be broadly classified as either those using electrical means or those using mechanical means.<br>
Methods of electrically enhancing speed or varying magnet flux include high current switching of additional phase coils or switching the way the phase coils are connected. The costs of such contactors and their contact wear tend to negate the advantages of a high durability brushless motor. Supplemental flux weakening coils have also been used to reduce stator flux and increase speed. This latter approach typically requires contactors and increases heating effects in the stator. Other methods can achieve higher speed operation by varying the waveform shape and pulse angle of the applied driving current or voltage.<br>
Other known methods include the use of DC/DC amplifier circuitry to boost the supply voltage in order to achieve a higher motor speed. This method increases system costs and decreases reliability and efficiency. Such electrical approaches to increasing a motor's base speed are exemplified in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,677,605 to Cambier et al., 5,739,664 to Deng et al. and 4,546,293 to Peterson et al.<br>
Mechanical approaches to increasing a motor's base speed include configurations that vary the radial air gap between a tapered or conical rotor arid :;t:ator. U.S. Patent Nos. 829,975 and 1,194,645 to Lincoln disclose a conical rotor and shaft-that is moved axially by a worm gear to adjust air gap and speed. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,648,090 to Voin and 4,920,295 to Holden et al. each disclose a conical rotor in an alternator that is adjusted axially to vary air gap and the alternator output. U.S. Patent No. 5,627,419 to Miller discloses a conical rotor that is moved axially to increase air gap and reduce magnetic drag on a flywheel energy storage system when the motor is not energized. in all of these patents, the rotor and stator remain engaged and changes in the magnetic air gap is achieved by small axial movements.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,250,576 to McEntire discloses motor stator coils of an AC induction motor that are moved axially<br>
between shorted and nen shorted portions of a dual rotor to vary speed. McEntire requires complex multiple lead screws or ball screws to effect. stator movement and a double length<br>
rotor.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,821,210 to Masusawa et'al. discloses a magnec rotor that is split into two sections.  For normal slow speed operation, the magnetic: north and aoivrh poles of both rotor  sections  are  alignea.    As  motor speed increases, centrifugal weights rotate one rotor section so the magnetic poles have increasing misalignment with speed.  The magnetic pole misalignment causes a reduction in magnetic flux and back-emf, which  allows the motor to run faster than normal base speed.  This system is self contained, but requires a split rotor &amp;nd the centrifugal apparatus to move the one rotor segment into misalignment.  The strong repulsive forces of like magnet poles produce thrust to push the rotor segments apart.  When the poles are misaligned, the attractive forces of unlike magnetic poles add to the centrifugal positioning force and override the springs used to restore the alignment position.  These factors add to the complicated design and effect durability, and cost.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,134,602 to Rao discloses a pancake type motor that uses a fixed axial air gap. In this type of motor the axial gap is functionally equivalent to the radial gap in an internal cylindrical rotor motor design with a radial air gap. The individual magnet sectors in the rotor are mounted on spring loaded radial tracks. When the rotor rpm increases, centrifugal force causes the magnet sectors to extend radially, reducing the active area of magnet aligned with the stater coil and reducing the back-emf. This causes the motor to run faster than the base speed. Rao is similar to Masuzawa et al. and Kolden et al. mentioned above in the centrifugal method of activation. The design of Rao requires extensive machining of the radial magnet tracks which increases costs<br>
and adds to the complexity. In addition, maintaining a sufficient level of balance of this magnet rotor is complicated by several factors. Even after the rotor is balanced with the magnets at their inboard position, as speed increases the position of the individual magnets is affected by difference in mass of the magnets, spring constants/rates, and sliding friction of the magnets along the tracks. Small variations in the resultant in the individual magnet positions would have a disastrous effect on the balance at high rotor speeds. These factors would necessarily adversely effect the ability to reduce back-emf of the motor and operate above the base speed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Many  applications  desire  the  merits  of  a  brushless permanent magnet motor, but: require operation significantly beyond the base speed.  In electric vehicle applications, low speed operation often requires constant torque operation at less than the base speed for moving heavy loads, or traversing rough terrain or inclines such as hills.  In many cases, high speed operation requires double or triple the base speed for cruising on level roads or developed industrial sites.  In this high speed mode, torque requirements are low and constant power operation is desired.  In constant power operation the available  torque  is  inversely proportional  to the  speed. Constant: power mode in a motor equipped with a mechanism that controls back emf provides an operation that is similar to shifting gear ratios in a transmission, i.e.,  higher speeds<br>
are traded for lower available torque. A motor that is able to shift from constant torque mode to constant power mode with speed extending beyond the base speed according to the present invention can be utilized as a magnetic variable transmission.<br>
Conversely, a wind power generating unit needs an alternator that will start at minimum torque for light winds. This minimum torque exists when the back etnf is *t a minimum point. When wind speed and power increases, a maximum back emf will generate more power. By using the continuously variable magnetic transmission of the present invention, a wind generator controller can maximise the amount of energy that can be captured from the available wind.<br>
Since a brushless permanent magnet motor requires an electronic controller to switch the currents to the stator phase coils, additional benefits can result according to the present invention by having independent back emf control by the motor controller as opposed to direct control of motor centrifugal force. In these same electric vehicle applications, high speed operation will often be followed by a speed reduction requiring regenerative braking by the motor. Regenerative braking is a control phase in which the motor acts as a generator, Blowing the vehicle and returning energy to the batteries. By having the back emf adjusted by the controller (using an independent actuator) as opposed to centrifugal force, allow, the motor to be shifted back xnto constant torque mode for optimum regenerative brakwg. <br>
The oreaeut invention includes a method of axially displacing the rotor of a radial gap permanent magnet motor to reduce back emf and increase speed above the normal base speed The invention utilizes a permanent magnet rotor with integral constant velocity linear bearing coupling the rotor to the motor shaft. An integral constant velocity linear bearing is used to couple the movable rotor and the fixed posLion motor shaft, while maintaining aliment between the<br>
rotor magnet poles and the shaft position encoder. As the rotor is offset into greater misalignment with the stator, the magnet flux on the stator field coils is reduced, reducing the back emf that limits speed. With the rotor misaligned, the motor operates in constant power mode, where available torque is inversely proportional to speed. The rotor can be moved axially by a hydraulic, electromechanical, manual, or other actuator means connected to a lever or other means.<br>
The rotor and stator have a constant cylindrical shape and are well suited to be manufactured using low cost identical stacked laminations. The magnets are rigidly fixed to the stator by adhesive bonding or other means making high speed balance and durability easy to maintain. The low friction linear bearing allows the magnetic attraction of the rotor and stator to provide sufficient restoring force to constant torque operation. The linear bearing also maintains alignment between the rotor magnet poles and the shaft position encoder that synchronizes the switching of the motor phase coils.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings which are given as non-limiting examples only. Throughout the various figures, common reference numbers have been used to identify common elements.<br>
Figure 1 is a graph depicting the relationship between speed and torque for a typical air gap motor of the present invention. In Fig. 1 the motor torque, which increases through a minimum torque up to a maximum torque for a given motor, is plotted against motor speed. The minimum torque is the torque required to drive the motor when the back emf is theoretically reduced to zero. The motor's base speed, which as discussed above is that speed at which back emf equals applied voltage, is shown on the horizontal axis of the graph in Fig. l. Below the motor base speed a constant torque mode<br>
is shown. Above the base speed, and up to the motor maximum speed, a constant power mcde is shown. In this latter mode, as the torque is lowered current, increases resulting in, a speed increase. The constant power mode is the motor speed addressed in the present invention.<br>

As shown, the yoke assembly 42 discussed above in reference to Fig. 2 includes a pair of thrust housing lever arms 80 which are fixed to and extend in parallel from torque tube 82. The thrust lever arms 80 are welding to the torque tube 82. To assist in assembling and strengthening the yoke assembly 42 against torsional forces, the torque tube 82 can be provided with a keyway 88 and a key 88' and the ends of the thrust housing lever arms 80 (and the pivot arm(s) 46) can included cutouts that are configured to allow ends of the thrust housing lever arms 80 (and the pivot arm(s) 46) to slide over the torque tube 82 and engage the key 88' .

Bearing 86 are provided on opposite ends of torque tube 82 between the torque tube 82 and pivot shaft 84. Bearings 86 can be made from an suitable soft metal such as brass, bronse, etc. or from a plastic bearing material.  As depicted, pivot brackets 44 are secured to the com end motor housing portion 2 by any suitable means such as welding. Alternatively, pivot brackets 44 can be secured to the end plate 10 as shown la Fig. 2.<br>
A pair of shoulder bolts or serews 90 are received in aligned internally threaded, bores provided in the outer sides of thrust bearing housing 76. The shoulder bolts or screws 90 pass through elongate slots 92 provided in the free ends of thrust housing lever arms 80 and can have bea.rings 94 thereon as show in Figs. 5 and 4. Bearing 74, discussed above, is shown between motor shaft 20 and thrust bearing housing 76.<br>
As shown in Pig. 5, pivot arm 46 comprises two parallel arms which are rigidly coupled to torque tube 82 and extend through a slot or passage in ccm end motor housing portion 2 as depicted in Fig. 2. The free end of pivot arms 46 are pivotally coupled to the movable end of actuator 48 which is received therebetween. A clevis pin 9S (see Pig. 2) or other element providing a pivotal axis is used to pivotally couple the free ends of pivot arm 66 to movable end 03: actuator 48.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a single pivot arm 4S could be used and either the free end thereof or the movable end of actuator 48 could have a yoke structure by which the two could be pivotally coupled together with a suitable coupling pin.<br>

Figure 6 is cross-sectional view of permanent magnet electric machine according to one embodiment of the present invention in which the rotor is about 25% disengaged with the stator. Figure 7 is cross-sectional view of permanent magnet electric machine according to one embodiment of the present invention in which the rotor is about 50% disengaged with the stator.<br>
Figures 2, 6 and 7 can be viewed as illustrating progressive axial movement of the rotor 24, with the rotor 24 in Fig. 2 being in full alignment or engagement with the stator 6, and Figures 6 and 7 depicting increasing misalignment or disengagement of the rotor 24 with respect to the stator 6.<br>
The full alignment or engagement of the rotor 24 with the stator 6 depicted in Fig. 2 will produce constant torque up to the base speed as shown in Pig. l.<br>
The amount of misalignment or disengagement of the rotor 24 with respect to the stator 6 depicted in Fig. 6 is approximately 25%. This amount of misalignment or disengagement will produce an increase in speed of approximately 150% of the base speed.<br>
The amount of misalignment or disengagement of the rotor 24 with respect to the atator 6 depicted in Fig. 6 is approximately 50%. This amount of misalignment or disengagement will produce an increase in speed of approximately 200% of the base speed.<br>
Figures 2, 6 and 7 are illustrative of several positions at which the rotor 24 can be moved by actuator 48. It is understood that the rotor 24 can be positioned in an infinite number of positions by actuator 48, so as to offer infinite control and adjustment of speed/torque.<br>
Figure 8 is a cross-sectional view of permanent magnet electric machine according to another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment of the invention in Fig. 8<br>
uses a linearly aligned actuator without a pivot linkage.  In Fig. s a thrust sleeve 100 is coupled to the end of rotor sleeve 32, and the motor shaft 20 has a hollow end portion 102 which receives pushrod 104.   Pushrod 104 is coupled to hydraulic or pneumatic actuator 48 via a thrust bearing 106 which allows pushrod 104 to rotate with motor shaft 20 and actuator 48 to move axially without rotating.  The motor shaft 20 includes a slot 108 in one side thereof through which a cross pin 110 can be inserted to couple pushrod 104 to thrust sleeve 32.<br>
In the embodiments of the invention depicted in Figs. 2-8, when the actuator 48 is actuated, rotor 24 is pushed out of alignment with stator 6 as it moves along motor shaft 20.<br>
It an alternative arrangement, the actuator 43 can be used to pull the rotor 24 out of alignment with stator 6. For Example, in Fig. 2, the actuator 48 could be turned around so that when the actuator 48 is actuated, rotor 24 moves away from the fan 52. The com end motor housing portion 2 could be lengthened together with the drive end of motor shaft 20 and grooves 26 and 34 to accommodate such a configuration. The embodiment of Fig, 8 could likewise be reconfigured so that actuator 48 pulled the rotor 24 out of alignment with stator<br>
o .<br>
Although a hydiaulic or pneumatic actuator is depicted in the figures, it is to be understood that any equivalent means could be used such as a threaded screw driven shaft, a pinion and gear assembly, a cable system, sliding actuator, etc.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular means, materials and embodiments, from the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of the present invention and various changes and modifications can be made to adapt the various uses and characteristics without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention as described above.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
