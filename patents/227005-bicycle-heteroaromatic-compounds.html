				<td>BICYCLIC HETEROAROMATIC COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS  LH AGONISTS<br>
The invention relates to compounds having glycoprotein hormone agonistic or antagonistic activity, in particular to compounds having Luteinizing Hormone (LH) agonistic activity. The invention furthermore relates to byciclic heteroaromatic derivative compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same as well as to the use of these compounds in medical therapy, panicularly for use as a control of fertility.<br>
Gonadotropins serve important functions in a variety of bodily functions including metabolism, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. The hypophyseal gonadotropin FSH for example plays a pivotal role in the stimulation of follicle development and maturation whereas LH induces ovulation (Sharp, R.M. Clin Endocrinol. 33:787-807, 1990; Dorrington and Armstrong, Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 35:301-342.1979). Currently, LH is applied clinically, in combination with FSH, for ovarian stimulation i.e. ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and induction of ovulation in infertile anovulatory women (Insler, V., Int. J. Fertility 33:85-97, 1988, Navot and Rosenwaks, J. Vitro Fert. Embryo Transfer 5:3-13, 1988), as well as for mate hypogonadism and male infertility.<br>
Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The actions of these pituitary and placental hormones are mediated by specific plasma membrane receptors that are members of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors. They consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and are able to interact with the Gs protein, leading to the activation of adenyl cyclase.<br>
Gonadotropins destined for therapeutic purposes can be isolated from human urine sources and are of low purity (Morse et al. Amer. J. Reproduce Immunol, and Microbiology 17:143, 1988). Alternatively, they can be prepared as recombinant gonadotropins.<br>
As with otiier therapeutic proteins, it is necessary to administer gonadotropins either subcutaneous or intra-muscular. h would be advantageous, however, to activate the<br><br>
receptor with a small molecule that could be administered through e.g. the oral or transdermal route.<br>
The present invention describes the preparation of such low molecular weight hormone analogs that selectively activate one of the gonadotropin receptors. This should be considered as one of the major advantages of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the invention resides in bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives according to general formula I. or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br><br>

Suitable administration routes for the compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, also referred to herein as the active ingredient are intramuscular injections, subcutaneous injections, intravenous injections or intraperitoneal injections, oral and intranasal administration. Preferably, the compounds may be administered orally. The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, will necessarily be dependent upon the therapeutic effect to be achieved (treatment of infertility; contraception), and may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon adsorption. However, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001-25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.<br>
In case of in vitro or ex vivo applications, like in TVF applications, the compounds of the inventions are to be used in the incubation media in a concentration of approximately 0.01-5 ^g/ml.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a bicyclic heteroaromatic compound according to formula I, i.e. excluding pharmaceutical compositions comprising ethyl 5-amino-4-phenyl-2-ethoxycarbonylmethylthio-thieno[2,3-rfIpyrimidine-6-carboxylate, methyl 5-amino-4-phenyl-2-methyIthio-thieno[2,3-(/Ipyrimidine-6-carboxylate or ethyl 5-amino-4-phenyl-2-methylthio-thieno[2,3-Â£fipyrimidine-6-carboxylate, 6-acetyl-5-amino-4-phenyl-2-(2-oxopropyIthio)-thieno[2,3-rf]pyrimidine, 5-amino-6-benzoyI-4-phenyl-2-phenylcarbonylmethylthio-thieno[2,3-(/)pyrimidine, 5-amino-6-{4-chlorobenzoyl)-4-phenyl-2-[(4-chlorophenyl)carbonylmethylthio]-thieno[2,3-rfJpyrimidine methyl 5-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methylthio-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate, ethyl 5-amino-4(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methyithio-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate, methyl 5-amno-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methylthio-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate,ethyl5-amino-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-methylthio-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6carboxylate, 5 amino-6-(4-methylbenzoyl)-4-phenyl-2-[(4-methylphenyl)carbonylmethylthio]-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine or ethyl 5-amino-2-ethoxycarbonyImethylthio-4-(pyridin-4-yl)-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, and optionally other therapeutic agents.<br><br>
The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal nasal, topical (including transdermal, buccal and subiingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration. The compositions may be prepared by any method well known in the an of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro et al., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing company, 1990. see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture).<br>
Such methods inciude the step of bringing in association the active ingredient with any auxilliary agent. The auxilliary agent(s). also named accessory ingredients, include those conventional in the an (Gennaro, supra), such as. fillers, binders, diluents, disintegrants, lubricants, colorants, flavoring agents and wetting agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as: discrete dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules, or as a powder or granules, or as a solution or suspension. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus or paste. The compositions can further be processed into a suppository or enema for rectal administration.<br>
For parenteral administration, suitable compositions include aqueous and nonÂ¬aqueous sterile injection. The compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed vials and ampoules, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, for example, water prior to use.<br>
Compositions, or formulations, suitable for administration by nasal inhalation include fine dusts or mists which may be generated by means of metered dose pressurized aerosols, nebulisers or insufflators.<br>
The bicyclic heteroaromatic derivative compounds of the invention can also be administered in the form of implantable pharmaceutical devices, consisting of a core of active material, encased by a release rate-regulating membrane. Such implants are to be applied subcutaneousiy or locally, and will release the active ingredient at an approximately constant rate over relatively large periods of time, for instance from weeks to years. Methods for the preparation of implantable pharmaceutical devices as<br><br>
such are known in the art, for example as described in European Patent 0.303.306 (AK20 N.V.).<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the present invention can be used for the same clinical purposes as the native LH, with the advantage that they display altered stability properties and can be administered differently.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) wherein B is a bond, represented by formula (I-c) can be prepared by condensation of pyridyl chlorides (VI) wherein W=CN or C(0)(OEt) with compounds of general structure (VII) in suitable solvents such as ethanol, methanol or tetrahydrofuran at elevated temperature (50 Â°C) in the presence of a base, e.g. sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide. potassium carbonate or potassium hydroxide.<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (X) may be prepared by cyclization of pyridyl chlorides (VI) with HXCH^CtOJOEt as described previously for the synthesis of compounds (I-c). In certain instances, an intermediate -not cyclized- product can be isolated, which cyclizes upon repeated treatment with base. Alternatively, compounds of formula (X) wherein X=S may also be prepared via the same procedure described for the synthesis of derivatives (I-d), by cyclization of (VIII) with VCH2C(0)OEt (IX) wherein V is as previously defined.<br>
Related cyclizations are found in literature. For example, thieno cyclizations are described by A.A. Santilli, D.H. Kim and S.V. Wanser, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 8:445, 1971; S. Kohra, Y. Tominaga and A. Hosomi, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 25:959, 1988; H. Vieweg, U. Krasselt N. Bohm, J. Prantz and G. Wagner, Pharmazie 45:731, 1990; H. Vieweg and G. Wagner, Pharmazie 46:51, 1991; G. Wagner, H. Vieweg and S- Leitner, Pharma2ie 48:588, 1993. Pyrrolo cyclizations are described e.g. by D.H. Kim and A.A. Santilli, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 6:819, 1969.<br>
Compounds of formula (VI) wherein W is as previously defined, can be synthesized following literature procedures as described for example by A.A. Santilli, D.H. Kim and S.V. Wanser, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 8:445, 1971. In a typical experiment, an amide of general structure (XI) is treated with POCb at elevated temperature (80 Â°C to reflux). The addition of an appropriate solvent, e.g. dioxane, and/or the addition of either PCI5 or A'A'-dimethylaniline to the reaction mixture may result in shorter reaction times and higher yields of chlorides (VI).<br><br><br>
In another approach, amides (XI) may be treated at elevated temperature (preferably reflux) with SOCI: to give compounds of formula (VI), as was described in literature by D.H. Kim and A.A. Santilli. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 6:819, 1969.<br>
Compounds of formula (VIII) wherein W is as previously defined can be prepared by treatment of derivatives (XI) with a sulfurizing agent, e.g. P:S; or Lawesson's Reagent in an appropriate solvent such as pyridine at elevated temperature (preferably reflux), see Z.H. Khalil, Phosph. Sulf. Siiic. Relat. Elem. 60: 223, 1991.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of general formula (VIII) wherein Y=CH and A is a bond, represented by formula (VIII-a) can be synthesized by cyclization of ct,p-unsaturated ketones of formula (XII) and thioacetamide (XIII).<br><br>
In a typical experiment compounds (Xll) and (XIII) are reacted in a solvent such as ethanol, methanol or tetrahydrofuran at elevated temperature (preferably reflux) in the presence of base, e.g. piperidine, triethylamine, sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide. Related cyclizations are found in literature: H. Vieweg, V. Hanfeld, S. Leitner and G. Wagner, Pharmazie 44:639,1989; H. Vieweg and G. Wagner. Pharmazie 46: 51, 1991.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (VUI-a. W = CN) can be synthesized starting from a,P-unsaturated dinitriles of general structure (XIV) and thioacetamides (XV) as was described by G.A.H. Elgemeie. Heterocycles 31:123. 1990.<br><br><br>
In a typical experiment, components (XVI), (XVII) and (XVIIIa-e) are suspended in an appropriate solvent, e.g. ethanol, methanol, Ar,jV-dimethylformamide, A-methylpyjToiidinone, tetrahydrofuran or pyridine and a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium medioxide or sodium ethoxide is added. Reaction takes place at elevated temperature (70 Â°C to reflux). After filtration, residues are taken up in water and acidified (pH 2) after which products (Xl-a) precipitate (S. Kambe, K. Saito and H. Kishi, Synthesis 2S7 (1979); A.M. Abd-EIfattah, S.M. Hussain and A.M. El-Reedy. Tetrahedron 39, 3197 (1983); S.M. Hussain. A.A. El-Barbary and S.A. Mansour, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 22, 169 (1985)). In the case of W=C(0)OEt, aromatization occurs on the addition of an oxidant, such as DDQ or oxygen. Related<br><br>
cyclizations may also be performed on a solid support such as Merrifteld resin using an appropriate linker, see for example A.L. Mrzinzik and E.R. Felder, J. Org. Chem. 63, 723 (1998); T. Masqueiin, D. Sprenger, R. Baer, F. Gerber and Y. Mercadal, Helv. Chim. Acta 81, 646 (1998).<br><br><br>
Methods to determine receptor binding as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity of gonadotropins are well known. In general, expressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and binding or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response isolated DNA encoding the LH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin (Jia et al, MoI.Endocrin., 5:759-776,1991.<br>
Methods to construct recombinant LH expressing cell lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor is attained by expression of the DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for site directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions or all of die DNA encoding the desired protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided to the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells expressing the receptor are then are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Altemativeiy isolated cell membranes containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of compound.<br>
For measurement of binding radioactiveiy or fluorescently labeled compounds may be used. As reference compound human recombinant LH can be used. In the alternative also competition binding assays can be performed.<br>
Another assay involves screening for LH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of receptor mediated c.AMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expession of the receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The amount of cAMP is then measured. The level of CAMP will be reduced or increased, depending on the inhibitory or stimulating effect of the test compound upon binding to the receptor.<br><br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells lines can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which responds to the level ofcAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or mi^ht be constructed in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, Ch, Himmler. A and Czemilofsky, A.P. (1995) Curr.Opin.Biotechnol.6:574.<br>
For selecting active compounds testing at I0'5 M must result in an activity of more than 20% of the maximal activity when LH is used as a reference. Another criterion might be the EC50 value which must be 
The skilled artisan will recognize that desirable EC50 values are dependent on the compound tested. For example, a compound with an ECso which is less than 10"5 M is generally considered a candidate for drug selection. Preferably this value is lower than 10"7 M. However, a compound which has a higher EC50, but is selective for the particular receptor, may be even a better candidate.<br>
Screening for LH receptor agonistic compounds can also be performed by using a mouse Leydig cell bioassay (Van Damme, M., Robersen, D. and Diczfalusy, E. (1974). Acta Endocrinol. 77: 655-671 Mannaerts, B., Kloosterboer, H. and Schuurs, A. (1987). Neuroendocrine logy of reproduction. R. Rolland et al. Eds., Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., 49-58). In this assay, stimulation of LH receptor mediated testosterone production can be measured in Leydig cells isolated from male mice.<br>
To measure in vivo activity of LH receptor agonistic compounds ovulation induction<br>
in immature mice can be studied. In this assay immature female mice can be primed with<br>
urinary FSH and approximately 48 hours later treated with a LH agonistic compound. The<br>
animals are killed after LH agonist treatment and the number of ova in the oviduct can be<br>
microscopically assessed.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be applied clinically in those regimens where now LH or hCG is used. These include LH substitution among subjects with hypogonadal hypogonadism either male or female, midcycle administration to induce ovulation (ovulation induction (01) or controlled hyperstimulation (COH) or stimulation of the corpus luteum.<br><br>

In vitro test for LH bioactivirv in mouse Levdig cells<br>
In male mice, the luteinising hormone (LH) induces testosterone production in testicular Levdig cells. This activity is also displayed by human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) which binds to the same target cell receptor as LH. The in vitro Levdig cell assay (van Damme et al. 1974; modified by Mannaerts et al, 1987) is used to determine die LH bioactivity of compounds that bind to the Levdig cell LH receptor which in turn causes testosterone production.<br>
For this assay. Leydig cells are isolated from the testes of mature. 9 to 13 weeks old. mice (strain: HSD/Cpb: SE. Harlan, The Netherlands). Therefore, mice are killed and the testes are quickly removed and decapsuiated. Each testis is transferred to a separate well of a tissue culture plate containing 0.75 ml culture medium per well. The contents of each well are passed through a 30 cm glass tube (inside diameter 2.5 mm, narrowed<br><br>
to 1.2 mm at 4 places in the middle). The suspension obtained is filtered through a 30 (im nylon mesh and the filtrate is pre-incubated in a 50 ml plastic rube for 30 min. at 37 Â°C in an incubator in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air / 5% C02. Following preÂ¬incubation the tube is centrifuged at 1600 N/kg for 5 min and the supernatant is decanted. The resulting pellet is resuspended in culture medium (0.5 mg original testis/ml) and the suspension is kept homogeneous by stirring it very slowly on a magnetic stirrer.<br>
This Leydig cell suspension (100 ul) is added to the wells of amicotiter plate containing 50 ul reference compound, test compound or vehicle (culture medium) per well. As a reference, LH or hCG in-house standards are used which are calibrated against International Reference preparations of human LH or hCG provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC, London, UK). Test and reference compounds are dissolved, diluted and assayed in the same culture medium. The plates containing reference and test compounds are incubated for 4 h at 37 Â°C in an incubator in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air / 5% C02. Following incubation, plates are sealed and stored at -20 Â°C until testosterone measurement. Prior to testosterone measurement, the contents of the microtiter plates are thawed at room temperature and the plates are centrifuged at 150 N/kg for 5 min. An aliquot of 30 ul supernatant of each well is diluted with culture medium (60x) to obtain a suitable dilution for testosterone measurement. Aliquots (12.5 ul) of each diluted test sample are then assayed using a direct testosterone RIA-kit. Results are indicated in Tabel 1.<br>
Example 118<br>
In vivo ovulation induction assav for LH bioactivitv in immature female mice In female immature mice which are stimulated with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), ovulation can be induced by luteininzing hormone (LH) or by human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) which binds to the same LH-receptor on the Graafian follicles. Binding to the LH-receptor initiates a biochemical cascade, which eventually results in follicular rupture and extrusion of a mature oocyte. To measure the in vivo activity of LH-agonistic compounds, immature 20 days old mice (B6D2F1 strain, Broekman Institute, the Netherlands) are primed with urinary FSH (Humegon; 12.5 IU/1, 0.1 ml s.c.) to initiate folliculogenesis. Forty-eight hours after FSH treatment test compound, reference compound or vehicle (10% cremophor solution) are administered to the animals. Test compounds (50 mg/kg in 0.1 ml) and vehicle (0.1 ml) are administered p.o., reference compounds (500 IU /kg hCG in 0.1 ml) are injected s.c. As a reference. hCG in-house standards are used which are calibrated against International Reference<br><br>
preparations of human hCG provided by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC, London, UK). Twenty-four hours after administration of test compound, reference compound or vehicle, animals are killed by cervical dislocation. The oviducts are dissected and collected in 0.9% KaCl. Next, the oviducts are placed between two glass plates and examined for the presence or absence of ovulated ova under a microscope. The number of ovulated ova present in the oviducts is indicative for in vivo LH-bioactivity. Results are given in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
