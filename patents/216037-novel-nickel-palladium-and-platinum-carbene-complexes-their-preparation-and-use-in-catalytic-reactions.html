				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to novel nickel-,<br>
palladium- and platinum-carbene complexes, and to their<br>
preparation and use in catalytic reactions.<br>
More than 80% of the industrially produced chemicals<br>
are prepared by catalytic processes. Catalytic<br>
processes are generally more economically viable and<br>
environmentally friendly than corresponding<br>
stoichiometric organic reactions. The homogeneous<br>
catalysts"used, in addition to acids and bases, are in<br>
particular complexes of the noble metals. Nickel,<br>
palladium and platinum complexes also find use as<br>
homogeneous catalysts in numerous industrial processes<br>
and in organic synthesis on the laboratory scale. An<br>
important example is the utilization of aryl-X<br>
compounds (X = halogen, OTf, N2+, OMs, C(O)C1 etc.).<br>
Especially bromo- and chloroaromatics are versatile<br>
intermediates of the chemical industry, for example as<br>
precursors for the preparation of agrochemical<br>
intermediates, Pharmaceuticals, dyes, materials, etc.<br>
In addition, nickel and palladium catalysts are<br>
frequently employed catalysts for the functionalization<br>
of haloaromatics or vinyl halides to aromatic olefins<br>
and dienes respectively (Heck reaction, Stille<br>
reaction), biaryls (Suzuki reaction, Stille reaction,<br>
Kumada reaction, Negishi reaction), alkynes<br>
(Sonogashira reaction), carboxylic acid derivatives<br>
(Heck carbonylation) , amines (Buchwald-Hartwig<br>
reaction.<br>
The catalyst systems described for olefinations,<br>
alkynylations, carbonylations, arylations, aminations<br>
and similar reactions of aryl-X compounds frequently<br>
have satisfactory catalytic turnover numbers (TON) only<br>
with uneconomic starting materials such as<br>
iodoaromatics and activated bromoaromatics. In<br>
contrast, in the case of deactivated bromoaromatics and<br>
especially in the case of chloroaromatics, generally<br>
large amounts of catalyst have to be added in order to<br>
attain industrially useful yields (&gt; 90%). Owing to the<br>
complexity of the reaction mixtures, simple catalyst<br>
recycling is additionally not possible, so that even<br>
the recycling of the catalyst causes high costs which<br>
are generally an obstacle to industrial implementation.<br>
In addition, particularly in the case of the<br>
preparation of active ingredients or active ingredient<br>
precursors, it is undesired to work with large amounts<br>
of catalyst, since there is the risk in this case that<br>
catalyst residues remain in the product. Relatively<br>
recent catalyst systems are based on cyclopalladated<br>
phosphines (W.A. Herrmann, C. Brofimer, K. OfeleT CTT-P.<br>
Reisinger, T. Priermeier, M. Beller, H. Fischer, Angew.<br>
Chem. 1995, 107, 1989; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.<br>
1995, 34, 1844) or mixtures of sterically demanding<br>
arylphosphines (J.P. Wolfe, S.L. Buchwald, Angew. Chem.<br>
1999, 111, 2570; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999, 38,<br>
2413) or tri-tert-butylphosphine (A.F. Littke, G.C. Fu,<br>
Angew. Chem. 1998, 110 3586; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.<br>
Engl. 1998, 31, 3387) with palladium salts or palladium<br>
complexes.<br>
However, inexpensive chloroaromatics cannot always be<br>
derivatized in an industrially satisfactory manner by<br>
means of the above-described reactions even using such<br>
catalysts. The catalyst productivities (expressed as<br>
TON) for the reactions mentioned are typically below<br>
10,000, and the turnover frequencies (TOF) below<br>
1,000 h-1. Thus, for the achievement of high yields,<br>
comparatively high amounts of the expensive catalysts<br>
have to be used. In spite of all further developments<br>
of the catalysts in recent years, only few industrial<br>
implementations of the arylation, carbonylation,<br>
olefination, etc., of chloroaromatics have become known<br>
to date.<br>
An important example of the industrial use of platinum<br>
catalysts is hydrosilylation, for example in the<br>
preparation of organosilanes or in the crosslinking of<br>
silicone rubber. In such reactions too, the<br>
productivity and the reactivity of the catalyst is of<br>
course a considerable factor for its industrial<br>
employability.<br>
The active palladium catalysts which are commonly used<br>
in the context of the activation and further<br>
utilization of aryl-X compounds are palladium(0)<br>
complexes. The situation is similar for nickel<br>
catalysts. Platinum catalysts which are used for the<br>
hydrosilylation are platinum(IV), platinum(II) and<br>
platinum(O) complexes, of which especially the<br>
platinum(0) complexes have high activity and have found<br>
widespread use.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
novel nickel, palladium and platinum complexes which<br>
can be used directly as catalysts even in reactions on<br>
the industrial scale. Owing to their structure, the<br>
inventive complexes should afford active and productive<br>
catalyst systems which are stable over a very wide<br>
temperature and pressure range. The complexes should<br>
also be preparable with an acceptable level of<br>
complexity and expense from available starting<br>
compounds, and present no problems in their handling<br>
which might be an obstacle to their use in industrial<br>
processes.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
novel nickel, palladium and platinum complexes of the<br>
formula (I)<br>
L1-M-L2 (I)<br>

M is a nickel, palladium or platinum atom,<br>

groups or carbonyl radicals, for example aldehyde<br>
groups, ketyl radicals, carboxylic acid groups,<br>
carboxylic ester radicals, carboxamide radicals, or N-<br>
substituted carboxamide radicals.<br>
Compounds of the formula L1 may have one or more,<br>
preferably one or two, electron-deficient olefinic<br>
double bonds. Particular preference is given to those<br>
compounds which do not contain any further olefinic<br>
double bonds apart from the electron-deficient olefinic<br>
double bond(s).<br>
Special preference is given to compounds which<br>
coordinate to the central metal atom by exactly one<br>
electron-deficient double bond. These may, for example,<br>
be compounds which have exactly one double bond, or<br>
else compounds whose structure, for example owing to<br>
steric or conformational hindrance, does not allow<br>
simultaneous coordination of more than one double bond<br>
to the same metal atom. The latter is the case, for<br>
example, for quinones which are thus a preferred<br>
embodiment of the ligands L1.<br>
Particularly preferred ligands L1 in the context of the<br>
present invention are illustrated by the following<br>
formulae (IV), (V) and (VI).<br>
In formula (IV), R7 is selected from -CN, -COH, -COR15,<br>
-COOH, -COOR15, -CONHR15, and -CONR15R16, where R15 and R16<br>
are each independently a hydrogen atom, a C1-C8 alkyl<br>
radical or C2-C6 alkenyl radical, and<br>
R8, R9 and R10 are each independently selected from a<br>
hydrogen atom, a C1-C8 alkyl radical, a C2-C8 alkenyl<br>
radical, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, -CN, -COH,<br>
-COR15, -COOH, -COOR15, -CONHR15 and -CONR15R16, where R15<br>
and R16 are each as defined above. Two suitable R7, R8,<br>
R9, R10, R15 and R16 radicals may optionally form, for<br>
example by condensation of functional groups present<br>
therein or replacement of one or more terminal atoms by<br>
single or double bonds, together with the atoms to<br>
which they are bonded, a 5- to 8-membered, preferably<br>
5- or 6-membered, ring which may preferably be aromatic<br>
or partly hydrogenated.<br>
Preferred R15 and R16 radicals are selected from a<br>
hydrogen atom and an alkyl radical. The alkyl radical<br>
has 1 to 8, preferably 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4,<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
In the formulae (V) and (VI), R11, R12, R13 and R14 are<br>
each independently selected from a hydrogen atom, a C1-<br>
C8 alkyl radical, a halogen atom or -CN, or in each<br>
case two of the R11 to R14 substituents together with<br>
the atoms to which they are bonded form a 5- to 8-<br>
membered, preferably 5- or 6-membered, ring which may<br>
preferably be aromatic or partly hydrogenated.<br>
Preferred R11, R12, R13 and R14 radicals are hydrogen<br>
atoms and alkyl radicals. An alkyl radical has 1 to 8,<br>
preferably 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4, carbon<br>
atoms. Particular preference is given to the case that<br>
at least R11 and R12 are hydrogen atoms, in which case<br>
R13 and R14 are likewise hydrogen atoms or alkyl .<br>
radicals, or form a 6-membered aromatic ring.<br>
Particularly preferred ligands L1 are acrylic acid,<br>
acrylic esters, acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic esters, methacrylonitrile, benzoquinone, 2-<br>
methyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone,<br>
2, 3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone, naphtho-<br>
quinone, anthraquinone, maleic anhydride, maleimide,<br>
maleic acid, maleic esters, fumaric acid, fumaric<br>
esters, metal salts of the carboxylic acids mentioned,<br>
or tetracyanoethene.<br>
In addition to complexes of the formula (I), the<br>
present invention also provides dimers of these<br>
complexes which are connected via an additional<br>
functionality of the ligand L1. They have the following<br>
structure (la) and (Ib):<br>
where L1, L2 and M are each independently as defined<br>
above, with the proviso that the bridging L1 radical in<br>
the formula (Ia) or (Ib) is selected such that it has a<br>
further coordination site for an Ni, Pt or Pd atom, for<br>
example a carbonyl oxygen or a further electron-<br>
deficient olefinic double bond. The dimer of the<br>
formula (Ib) appears to form preferentially in<br>
crystalline forms, while the complex of the formula (I)<br>
is to be found preferentially in solutions.<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing<br>
the novel catalyst complexes by reacting a carbene or a<br>
precursor thereof with suitable nickel, palladium or<br>
platinum complexes. Suitable complexes are those whose<br>
ligands can be displaced readily by carbenes, for<br>
example olefin complexes such as Ni(cyclooctadiene)2,<br>
Pd2(diallyl ether)3, alkyne or amine complexes<br>
(PdMe2 (N,N,N",N"-tetramethylethylenediamine)).<br>
Preferred reactants are those complexes which contain<br>
(a) a suitable electron-deficient olefin L1 as a ligand<br>
on a nickel, palladium or platinum atom, and (b) a<br>
further ligand which can be displaced readily by a<br>
carbene. Examples of such ligands which are replaced by<br>
the carbene in the synthesis of the complex are<br>
cyclooctadiene or norbornadiene, so that the reactant<br>
or precursor complex used is, for example, (cycloocta-<br>
diene)Pd(benzoquinone) or (norbornadiene)Pd(maleic<br>
anhydride). The moiety of the reactant complexes which<br>
is composed of the central atom and the ligand with<br>
electron-deficient double bond and which is still<br>
present in the inventive carbene complex is referred to<br>
hereinbelow as the fragment L1-M. The precursors of<br>
carbenes may, for example, be the imidazolium salts in<br>
the presence of bases.<br>
The inventive catalyst may also be prepared in situ<br>
from a suitable precursor as described above and the<br>
carbene ligand L2. To this end, both components are<br>
added to the reaction mixture of the reaction to be<br>
catalysed. However, such a procedure is not preferred,<br>
since the actually active catalyst species first has to<br>
be formed here, i.e. the catalyst has to be preformed<br>
in order to achieve a maximum activity. Since optimal<br>
preformation conditions and optimal reaction conditions<br>
for the catalysis reaction are frequently not<br>
identical, the catalyst metal is not always optimally<br>
utilized. It is therefore advantageous to prepare and<br>
to isolate the inventive complexes under controlled<br>
conditions and only then to use them as catalysts. In<br>
this case, the carbene is preferably reacted with a<br>
solution of the reactant complex which contains the<br>
fragment Lx-M at reduced temperature (e.g. at a<br>
temperature of -78 to +30°C, preferably at -10°C to.<br>
+28°C) . An example of a suitable solvent is THF. The<br>
product which forms may be isolated, for example, by<br>
concentrating the solution and precipitating. It can<br>
additionally be purified by customary processes such as<br>
washing, recrystallization or reprecipitation.<br>
According to the invention, the novel complexes are<br>
used as catalysts for organic reactions. Typical but<br>
nonlimiting examples of such catalytic reactions are<br>
olef inations, arylations, alkylations, ke.tone<br>
arylations, aminations, etherifications, thiolizations,<br>
silylations, carbonylations, cyanations, alkynylations<br>
of aryl-X compounds or vinyl-X compounds, where X is a<br>
leaving group, for example a halide, a diazonium salt,<br>
triflate, trifluoromethanesulphonate, or olefinic<br>
compounds, even in the presence of nucleophiles.<br>
Further examples of suitable reactions are<br>
hydrosilylations of olefins or alkynes or ketones,<br>
carbonylations of olefins, di- and oligomerizations of<br>
olefins, telomerizations of dienes, cross-couplings<br>
with organometallic reagents (e.g. Grignard reagents,<br>
lithium reagents, zinc reagents, tin reagents, etc.)<br>
and other transition metal-catalysed coupling<br>
reactions. The complexes prepared in accordance with<br>
the invention have been found to be especially useful<br>
as catalysts for preparing arylated olefins (Heck<br>
reactions), biaryls (Suzuki reactions), carboxylic<br>
acids and amines from aryl halides or vinyl halides or<br>
other aryl-X compounds, for example aryldiazonium<br>
salts.<br>
By way of example, the high activity of the inventive<br>
complexes is shown in the activation of inexpensive but<br>
relatively unreactive chloroaromatics.<br>
In general, the inventive catalyst is used directly<br>
without further ligand additions. In this case,<br>
stoichiometrically corresponding amounts of L1, L2 and M<br>
are advantageously used in the preparation of the<br>
catalyst. However, it is also possible in catalytic<br>
applications to use a preferably small excess of a<br>
ligand to the transition metal.<br>
Generally, it is customary to use the inventive<br>
catalysts, owing to their activity, in very low<br>
transition metal concentrations (
catalytic applications, preference is given to using<br>
transition metal concentrations between 1.5 and<br>
0.0001 mol%, in particular between 1 and 0.01 mol%, of<br>
transition metal.<br>
The novel nickel, palladium and platinum complexes are<br>
thermally very stable. Thus, the inventive catalysts<br>
may be used at"reaction temperatures up to above 250°C.<br>
Preference is given to using the catalysts at<br>
temperatures of -20 to 200 °C; in many cases, it has<br>
been found useful to work at temperatures of 30 to<br>
180°C, preferably 40 to 160°C. The complexes may be<br>
used without loss of activity even in pressure<br>
reactions, for which a pressure of only up to 100 bar<br>
is typically used, but preferably in the range of<br>
atmospheric pressure up to 60 bar. The stability of the<br>
inventive complexes is particularly surprising, since<br>
the metal complexes are undercoordinated species.<br>
The catalysts prepared in accordance with the invention<br>
may be used, inter alia, for the preparation of aryl-<br>
olefins, dienes, biaryls, benzoic acid derivatives,<br>
acrylic acid derivatives, arylalkanes, alkynes, amines,<br>
ethers, thioethers and silyl compounds. The thus<br>
prepared compounds may be used, inter alia, as UV<br>
absorbers, as intermediates for Pharmaceuticals and<br>
agrochemicals, as ligand precursors for metallocene<br>
catalysts, as fragrances, active ingredients and<br>
monomers for polymers.<br>
Examples<br>
General procedure for the synthesis of the inventive<br>
complexes:<br>
1 mmol of an Ni, Pd or Pt complex with olefin fragments<br>
is suspended in 50 ml of absolute THF. The preparation<br>
of suitable reactant complexes is illustrated, for<br>
example, in M. Hiramatsu et al., J. Organomet. Chem.<br>
246 (1983) 203, wherein in particular the synthesis of<br>
(cyclooctadiene)Pd(quinone) complexes is described.<br>
A solution of 1 mmol of carbene in 20 ml of absolute<br>
THF is slowly added dropwise at -78°C. The mixture is<br>
allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and stirred<br>
for a further 2 hours. The solution is concentrated<br>
under reduced pressure down to a volume of approx. 2 ml<br>
and finally admixed with 25 ml of absolute ether. The<br>
precipitated solid is filtered off, washed with ether<br>
and dried. The corresponding carbene-metal-olefin<br>
complex is obtained in analytically pure form.<br>
