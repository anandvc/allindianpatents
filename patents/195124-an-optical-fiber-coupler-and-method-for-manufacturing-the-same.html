				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention	<br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber coupler, and more particularly, to a modal evolution optical coupler in which a low-loss optical transmission is accomplished, and a method for manufacturing the same.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Propagation of light by reflection and refraction is determined by the incident angle of the light and the refractive indices of two media. Accordingly, the development of a medium capable of more effectively propagating light is very important in optical communications. An optical fiber is the most widely used as a medium for transmitting light. The optical fiber includes an internal core for transmitting light and a clad having a different refractivity for accomplishing a total reflection of light in the core. A core having a diameter ranging from about 8 µm to 200 µm (0.2 mm) is usually used for transmitting light. The small diameter of the core portion causes significant technical difficulties in connecting optical fibers or branching and coupling transmitted light.<br>
An optical coupler is a passive device for branching or coupling an optical signal. The function of branching or coupling an optical signal in optical communications can be<br><br>
simply performed by various photomechanical connections, similar to branching or coupling in electric communications. However, the optical signal cannot be simply realized because of the characteristics of the optical fiber, so that a special optical coupler is employed as a light branching and coupling device.<br>
An optical coupler using an optical fiber which has been the most widely used since the 1970's is a fused coupler which uses an evanescent field coupling method. The fused coupler is manufactured by twisting several optical fibers together and then commonly fusing and tensing the twisted fibers. Every dielectric single-mode waveguide including an optical fiber has an evanescent electromagnetic field which decreases exponentially to the exterior of a core. Accordingly, when two single-mode waveguides are made adjacent to each other, a wavemode is excited by an evanescent field of adjacent cores and a combination of optical signals occurs. Such type of combination is called an evanescent field combination, and is used by the fused coupler. However, the fused coupler requires a complicated and time consuming manufacturing process, is expensive and it is not likely that the price of the fused coupler will go down.<br>
As another coupler, a waveguide coupler is included. The waveguide coupler branches or couples light by a quartz glass waveguide formed on a silicon substrate or a waveguide using an ion exchange glass. A small coupler can be produced in large quantities when the waveguide technique is used.<br>
2<br><br>
However, several technical problems remain such as a loss of the waveguide itself, a. loss in an optical fiber connection or an improvement in a waveguide forming technique.<br>
As still another coupler, there is a direct-combination core extension coupler using an extension element which has extended the core of an optical fiber in a channel transmission path. The extending element extends light transmitted via a core to have a much larger section centered on the core. An optical coupler can be designed by applying the extension element. Several optical fibers having well cut ends are put together in order. When the extension element is formed from the cut section of each optical fiber, the section areas of the extension elements increase. Consequently, the extension elements touch and combine with each other at a certain distance or more. Once the extension elements combine with each other and form a body, light is branched or lights are coupled. The coupler easily connects lights to each other compared to the fused coupler or the waveguide coupler, thereby allowing simple branching or coupling of optical fibers. Also, there is a high probability that the price of the coupler will go down. However, since the core extension is long when extending a core in the channel transmission path, an extension element formed by ultraviolet rays tends to wiggle. Also, a loss in transmission light is increased by an influence of: a resin existing between the section of an optical fiber and the wall of a channel transmission path, etc. The performance of the coupler is remarkably<br><br>
deteriorated, so that the coupler cannot be effectively used as a coupler,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

core extension coupler, it is an object of the present<br>

18<br><br>
component having an adjustable refractive index which is 0.01 to 0.002 less than those of the expanding elements 110, 230, 310 and 410. Also, the channel transmission paths 130, 240, 320 and 420 can have a circular or rectangular section.<br>
Also, the coverlet 120, 250, 330 and 430 shown in FIGS. 1 through 4 can be formed of a resin composed of a single component, a plurality of components, or a complex component having an adjustable refractive index which is 0.02 to 0.002 less than those of the expanding elements 110, 230, 310 and 410. The optical fibers 100, 140, 200, 210, 220, 300, 340, 400, 440 and 450 shown in FIGS. 1 through 4 can be installed in the channel transmission paths 130, 240, 320 and 420 using a snap-in method/push-in method for fixing the optical fiber to the channel transmission path by pressing down on the optical fiber. Also, the optical fibers 100, 140, 200, 210, 220, 300, 340, 400, 440 and 450 can be installed on the channel transmission paths 13 0, 240, 320 and 4 20 using an inserting method in which the channel transmission paths 130, 240, 320 and 420 with the coverlets 120, 250, 330 and 430 installed thereon are filled with a resin and the optical fibers are then inserted into the resin in the channel transmission paths 130, 240, 320 and 420. Furthermore, when the optical fibers 100, 140, 200, 210, 220, 300, 340, 400, 440 and 4 50 are inserted into the resin in the channel transmission paths 130, 240, 320 and 420 and then installed on the channel transmission paths 130, 240, 320 and 420, a U- or V-shaped groove can be used to allow the optical fibers 100,<br>

140, 200, 210, 220, 300, 340, 400, 440 and 450 to be self-aligned.<br>
The operation of the present invention will now be described. Referring to the operation of the optical coupler shown in FIG. 1, a transmitted light passes through the optical fiber 100 having a core that has been thermally expanded gradually to be enlarged at a portion of a communications optical fiber designed so that a mode can be evoluted while keeping a basic mode, and then is incident into the expanding element 13 0 polymerized by the ultraviolet irradiation. When the core of the optical fiber 100 is gradually expanded, the transmitted light is evoluted while maintaining the basic mode by minimizing the inclination angle and shortening the expansion distance of the core. The evoluted mode is incident into the expanding element 130, travels inside the expanding element 130 under conditions of total internal reflection of light, is incident into the optical fiber 140 having core-expanded a portion of an optical fiber opposing the optical fiber 140, and then is output by restoring to the original state.<br>
Referring to the operation of the optical coupler shown in FIG. 2, in the optical coupler of FIG. 2, a branching of A into B and C or a coupling of B and C into A occurs due to a mode field structure in which the electromagnetic fields of optical signals passing through the expanding element 230 in the Y-shaped channel transmission path 240 are combined with each other. First, the branching of A into B and C will be<br>
20<br><br>
considered. A light transmitted from A passes through the optical fiber 200 having a core gradually, thermally expanded to be enlarged at a portion of a communication optical fiber designed so that a mode can be evoluted wile keeping a basic mode, and then is incident into the expanding element 230 polymerized by ultraviolet irradiation. When the core of the optical fiber 200 is gradually expanded, the transmitted light is evoluted with the basis mode being kept by minimizing the inclination angle and shortening the core expansion distance. The evoluted mode is incident into the expanding element 230, travels inside the expanding element 23 0 under conditions of total internal reflection of light, and is incident into the optical fibers 210 and 22 0 having core-expanded a part of an optical fiber opposing the optical fibers 210 and 22 0 with optical power being branched in identical amounts at a branching portion of the expanding element 23 0 in the Y-shaped channel transmission path 240. Then, the evoluted mode is restored back to the original state and output as B and C.<br>
Next, the coupling of B and C to A will be considered. A light transmitted from B and C passes through the optical fibers 210 and 220 having a core gradually, thermally expanded to be enlarged at a portion of a communications optical fiber designed so that a mode can be evoluted while keeping a basic mode, and then is incident into the expanding element 230 polymerized by ultraviolet irradiation. The light evoluted while keeping the basic mode is incident into the expanding element 23 0 and travels inside the expanding element 230 under<br>
21<br><br>
conditions of total internal reflection of light, and is incident into the optical fiber 200 having core-expanded a part of an optical fiber installed in opposite to the optical fiber 200 with mode fields being structurally combined at the coupling portion of the expanding element 230 in the Y-shaped channel transmission path 240. At this time, the evoluted mode is restored back to the original state, and output as A. Referring to the operation of the optical coupler shown in FIG. 3, the transmitted light, which is evoluted while keeping the; basic mode by minimizing the inclination angle of a core and shortening the expansion distance thereof when the core of the optical fiber 300 is gradually expanded, passes 'through the optical fiber 304 uniformly enlarged at the entire portion of the optical fiber during enlargement of the core. Then, the transmitted light is incident into the expanding element 310 polymerized by the UV irradiation. The light incident into the expanding element 310 is mode-evoluted once again. The section area of the expanding element 310 is the same as the core of the continued portion 304 of an optical fiber at a portion contacting the continued portion 304. However, the section area thereof is shrunk until a predetermined distance and gradually enlarged. Then, the expanding element 310 keeps the increased size after reaching the wall of the rectilinear channel transmission path 320. At this time, the incident light travels inside the expanding element 310 under conditions of total internal reflection of light by minimizing the inclination angle of a core and<br>
22<br><br>
shortening the expansion distance thereof. The incident light is incident into the optical fiber 340 whose core is uniformly-enlarged at the continued portion 3 44 opposing the continued portion 304. Thus, the evoluted mode is restored once again, and is restored again by the optical fiber 34 0 having core-expanded a part of itself and then output.<br>
According to the optical coupler of FIG. 4, in the optical coupler of FIG. 4, a branching of D into E and F or a coupling of E and F into D occurs due to a mode field structure in which the electromagnetic fields of optical signals passing through the expanding element 410 in the Y-shaped channel transmission path 420 are combined with each other. First the branching of D into E and F will be considered. A light is transmitted from D through the connecting portion 4 02 of the optical fiber 4 00 having thermally expanded a core to be gradually enlarged at a portion of a communications optical fiber designed so that a mode can be evoluted while keeping a basic mode. Then, the transmitted light passes through the optical fiber 400 uniformly enlarged at the continued portion 4 04 during enlargement of a core. Thereafter, the transmitted light is incident into the expanding element 410 polymerized by ultraviolet irradiation. The transmitted light is evoluted while keeping the basic mode by minimizing the inclination angle of a core and shortening the expansion distance thereof when the core of the optical fiber 400 is gradually expanded. The evoluted mode passes through the optical fiber 400 whose<br>
23<br><br>
pore is uniformly enlarged at the continued portion 404 of the optical fiber 400, and is then incident into the expanding element 410. The light incident into the expanding element 410 is mode-evoluted once again with keeping the basic mode. The section area of the expanding element 410 is the same as the core of the continued portion 404 of the optical fiber 400 at a portion contacting the continued portion 404. However, the section area thereof is shrunk until a predetermined distance and gradually enlarged. Then, the expanding element 410 keeps the increased size after reaching the wall of the Y-shaped channel transmission path 420. At this time, the incident light travels inside the expanding element 410 under conditions of total internal reflection of light by minimizing the inclination angle of a core and shortening the expansion distance thereof. The optical power is branched in equal amounts at the branching portion of the expanding element 4109 in the Y-shaped channel transmission path 140. In such a state, the incident light is incident into the continued portions 444 and 454 of the optical fibers 440 and 450 whose cores are uniformly enlarged at the entire portions of the optical fibers 440 and 450 opposing the optical fiber 400. Thus, the evoluted mode is restored once again, and is secondly restored by the connection portions 442 and 4 52 of the optical fibers 440 and 450 having core-expanded a part of themselves and then output as E and F.<br>
Next, the coupling of E and F to D will be considered. A 'light transmitted from E and F passes through the optical<br>
24<br><br>
fibers 440 and 450, whose cores are uniformly enlarged at the optical fiber continued portions 444 and 454, via the optical fiber connection portions 442 and 452 having expanded a core at a portion of a communications optical fiber designed so that a mode can be evoluted while keeping a basic mode, and then is incident into the expanding element 410. The light incident into the expanding element 410 polymerized by UV irradiation is evoluted again keeping the basic mode and travels inside the expanding element 410 under conditions of total internal reflection of light. As mode fields are structurally combined at the coupling portion of the expanding element 410 in the Y-shaped channel transmission path 420, the incident light is incident into the optical fiber connection portion 4 02 whose core is uniformly expanded at the optical fiber continued portion 404 installed in opposite to the optical fiber continued portions 444 and 454. At this time, the evoluted mode is first restored to the original state by the optical fiber continued portion 404. Then, the mode is secondly restored by the optical fiber connection portion 402 which partially expanded the core of the optical fiber 400, and thus output as D.<br>
According to the optical couplers of FIGS. 5 and 6, a U-or V-shaped groove 510 is used when the optical fiber 500 and a general communications optical fiber are inserted into a resin filled in a rectilinear or Y-shaped channel transmission path 530 to be installed on the rectilinear or Y-shaped channel transmission path 530. Therefore, the optical fiber<br>
25<br><br>
can be fixed to the channel transmission path 530. Also, the precision of the connection between optical fiber cores is increased, thus reducing a loss of light emission generated by-inconsistencies between the optical fiber cores.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the expansion distance of a core is long when the core is enlarged in the channel transmission path, in contrast to a conventional method. Thus, an expanding element formed by ultraviolet rays is prevented from wiggling. Also, a loss of transmitted light due to an influence of a resin existing between the section of an optical fiber and the wall of the channel transmission path is remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the use of the U- or V-shaped groove makes it possible for the optical fibers to be self-aligned and an emission loss is reduced.<br>
