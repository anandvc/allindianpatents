				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an oscillating electrical circuit having multiple loops.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basic concept of a single ended oscillator comprising an active element A and the<br>
feedback element β is illustrated in Fig. 5. To start and maintain an oscillation in an<br>
electrical oscillator, normally the output of an active element is fed back to the input of the<br>
active device by a feedback network, which creates a loop-gain larger than one. The<br>
feedback elements have normally narrow-band characteristics. Moreover, the oscillation<br>
frequency for the oscillator may be varied by electrically controlling the centre frequency<br>
for the feedback element.<br>
This is further illustrated in Figs, 1a and 1b for a differential realisation. To create an<br>
oscillator with low phase noise, fast switching of the active device(s) is/are advantageous.<br>
Moreover, the relation in time between the current injected by the active device into the<br>
resonant element and the voltage over the resonant element, as in Fig. 1a, is important if<br>
low phase noise is required.<br>
To achieve fast switching, the loop-gain may be increased by increasing the gain of the<br>
active device either by having a wider device, which is valid in the case of FET (Field<br>
Effect Transistor), or by increasing the bias current for the active device. However,<br>
increasing the power consumption is not desired and wider transistors will result in more<br>
parasitic capacitance, which counteracts fast switching. Moreover, it is not possible to<br>
control the phase of the injected current pulse in an optimal way with the common<br>
oscillator topologies shown in Figs, 1a and 1b.<br>
In Fig. 1a, the oscillator circuit 100a comprises two resonant elements 101a and 102a,<br>
which at a common terminal are fed from a supply voltage 110a and connected to the<br>
drains and gates of transistors T1a and T2a, respectively. Feedback element 103a is<br>
connected between the drain of transistor T1a and gate of transistor T2a and feedback<br><br>
element 104a is connected between the drain of T2a and gate of transistor T1a. Optionally,<br>
a voltage bias source 120a may be connected to the gates of the transistors T1a and T2a<br>
via an impedance element 105a. The sources of the transistors are AC grounded,<br>
optionally through a current bias source 130a.<br>
Fig. 1b illustrates another oscillator circuit 100b in which a resonant element 101b is<br>
connected to the drains of active elements T1b and T2b. Active elements comprising two<br>
transistors T3b and T4b are connected with gate and drain common to T1b and T2b,<br>
respectively. The drain of T3b is connected to the common gates of T4b and T2b while the<br>
drain of T4b is connected to the common gates of T3b and T1b, constituting the feedback.<br>
The circuit is fed with a supply voltage 110b through the sources of T3b and T4b. The<br>
sources of transistors T1b and T2b are grounded, optionally through a current bias source<br>
130b.<br>
It is also possible to provide additional feedback elements in the circuit according to Fig.<br>
1b. Moreover, the current source can be provided on top of the circuit.<br>
Prior art according to "Design Issues in CMOS Differential LC Oscillators", by A.<br>
Hajimiri et al, IEEE journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. 34, No. 5, May 1999, discloses a<br>
topology for oscillators, in which fast switching and current pulse optimisation is<br>
achieved. However, this document is silence about the novel connection according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objects of the present invention are to provide an oscillator with fast switching<br>
characteristics and current pulse optimisation. The presented invention allows realization<br>
in a very compact (and low parasitic) way. The characteristics will further allow very high<br>
frequency VCOs based on this topology.<br>
Thus, the invention according to a preferred embodiment will provide a faster or/and more<br>
optimised switching resulting in lower oscillator phase noise for a fixed bias current.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, the current between the source node and the ground obtains<br>
a lower amplitude for its DC component.<br>
For these reasons an oscillator circuit comprises a resonant element, an active element, a<br>
feedback loop, and an additional feedback loop comprising a phase shifting element. The<br>
resonant element is connected to a drain of the active element and the feedback loop is<br>
connected to gate of the active element and resonant element and the additional feedback<br>
loop is connected between drain and gate of the active element.<br>
The additional element may also be provided with supplementary amplification.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the oscillator circuit further comprises:<br>
two resonant elements, having a first common terminal fed from a supply voltage and<br>
second terminals connected to the drains of first and second transistors, respectively<br>
provided as active elements, feedback elements connected between the drain of the first<br>
transistor and gate of the second transistor, and a feedback for each transistor comprising<br>
the phase shifting element. Preferably, the feedback comprises an amplifier and inverter<br>
networks connected between drain and gate of the first and second transistor, respectively.<br>
The sources of the transistors may be connected to ground through one of directly, a<br>
current bias source, via a resistor, impeditive element or current generator. A voltage bias<br>
network may be connected to gates of the first and second transistors.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the oscillator circuit comprises: a first transistor pair,<br>
a second transistor pair, a resonant element arranged connected to the drains of a first and<br>
a second active element pair, first and second active element pair, each transistor pair has<br>
gate and drain connected, wherein a drain of a first transistor in the transistor pair is<br>
connected to gate common of a second transistor in the transistor pair, a supply voltage<br>
source connected to the sources of the first and second transistors, and additional feedback<br>
elements connected between the drains and gates of the active elements.<br>
The resonant elements may comprise one or several of LC circuits and the feedback<br>
elements may comprise capacitors or transformers.<br><br>
The additional feedback loops may comprise transistors having their gates connected to<br>
the drains of the same transistors, respectively, and their outputs (drain) connected to the<br>
gates of transistors. A bias voltage can be applied to the sources of the feedback<br>
transistors.<br>
Preferably, the feedback loop comprises an inverter network and/or an amplifier.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of providing an oscillator with fast switching<br>
characteristics and current pulse optimization, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
arranging an oscillator circuit with a resonant element, an active element and a feedback<br>
loop, and providing the circuit with an additional feedback loop comprising a phase<br>
shifting element.<br>
The invention also relates to an electrical circuit comprising an oscillator as mentioned<br>
above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to the invention, the circuits according to Figs, 1a and 1b are modified and<br>
comprise additional positive feed-back loops with a device having variable gain and<br>
variable phase characteristics. By this optimisation a lowered phase noise for the oscillator<br>
can be achieved. The active device in the added loop will have a high impedance load,<br>
which provides extra voltage gain despite a low current consumption. This is illustrated in<br>
Figs. 2a and 2b.<br>
Thus, Fig. 2a illustrates an oscillator circuit 200a, according to one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, comprising two resonant elements 201a and 202a,<br>
which at a common terminal are fed from a supply voltage 210a (VDD) and connected to<br>
the drains of transistors T1a and T2a, respectively. Feedback elements 203a and 204a are<br>
connected in series between the drain of one of the transistors to the gate of each other<br>
transistor and vice versa. A voltage bias network comprising a source 220a feeding<br>
common terminals of, e.g. impedance elements 205a and 206a is connected to the gates of<br>
the transistors T1a and T2a. The sources of the transistors are optionally grounded through<br>
a current bias source 230a. However, it may also be grounded directly, via a resistor,<br>
impeditive element or current generator. The feedback according to the invention<br>
comprises amplifier and inverter networks (circuits or elements) 207a and 208a connected<br>
between the drain and gate of each transistor T1a and T2a, respectively. The essential<br>
characteristic of the feedback elements are phase shifting and amplification.<br>
Even though active elements Tla and T2a are illustrated as MOS transistors, it is obvious<br>
that they may be substituted by any type of active elements. This is valid for all<br>
embodiments illustrated and described herein.<br>
Fig. 2b illustrates another oscillator circuit 200b, in accordance with a second exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention and corresponding to the circuit of Fig. lb, in which a<br>
resonant element 201b is arranged connected to the drains of active elements T1b and T2b,<br>
T3b and T4b. Two transistors T3b and T4b are connected with gate and drain common to<br>
T1b and T2b, respectively. The drain of T3b is connected to the gates of T4b and T2b<br><br>
while the drain of T4b is connected to the gates of T3b and T1b. The gate-drain<br>
connection between T1b, T2b and T3b, T4b constitutes two feedback loops which allow<br>
the oscillator to oscillate. Again, there may be provided feedback elements in the feedback<br>
path. The circuit is fed with a supply voltage 210b through the sources of T3b and T4b.<br>
The sources of transistors T1b and T2b are grounded. The feedback elements 207b and<br>
208b are connected between the output (drain) and gates of the active elements T1b, T2b,<br>
T3b and T4b. 207b and 208b provide the additional feedback loops. Thus, the active<br>
elements are connected in pairs and the two pairs are complementary. The circuit may also<br>
comprise grounded source.<br>
A more detailed exemplary implementation embodiment of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3. The resonant elements 301 and 302 comprise LC circuits. The<br>
feedback elements 303 and 304 may comprise transformers or other AC coupling<br>
elements. The additional positive feedbacks, according to the invention, comprise<br>
transistors T5 and T6 having their gates connected to the drains of the transistors T1 and<br>
T2, respectively, and their outputs (drain) connected to the gates of the transistors Tl and<br>
T2. A control voltage (VCTRL) is applied to the sources of the feedback (PMOS) transistors<br>
T5 and T6. Element 305, which may be an inductor or other AC high impedance element,<br>
functions as a current generator with or without additional feedback loop.<br>
In a fourth exemplary embodiment as illustrated in Fig. 4, similar to the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 3, the feedback network comprises an inverter network comprising transistors T5, T6,<br>
T7 and T8, and feedback elements 403 and 404. The inverter network in this case<br>
comprises N-channel transistors T7 and T8 grounded at source and connected via drain to<br>
gates of Tl and T2 and drains of T5 and T6, respectively.<br>
To verify the functionality of a circuit according to the present invention some simulations<br>
have been carried out. The graph of Fig. 6 illustrates the source to ground current in an<br>
oscillator according to Fig. 3, a major difference in current amplitude and the improved<br>
current waveform can be observed. A lower current consumption is apparent. Both AC-<br>
and DC-components of the current has been reduced. This is due to the enhanced<br>
switching and current waveform. In the graph, the dashed line shows the source current<br>
time dependency of an ordinary oscillator and the continuous line the source current time<br><br>
dependency of a circuit according to the present invention. It should be noted that both the<br>
prior art topology and the embodiment according to the invention provide substantially the<br>
same phase noise performance but the power consumption, which is proportional to the<br>
mean value of the source to ground current is much lower for the embodiment according<br>
to the invention.<br>
In the simulated topology, the transistors are assumed as: NMOS 100 um/0.1 μm (W/L =<br>
1000) and PMOS 50 μm/0.1 μm (W/L 500).<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a graph of optimum phase noise performance for the given topology, both<br>
with and without the extra feedback loop. In the graph, the dashed line shows the phase<br>
noise versus offset frequency of an ordinary oscillator and the continuous line the phase<br>
noise versus offset frequency of a circuit according to the present invention. The improved<br>
performance does not come with increased power consumption.<br>
The oscillator of the invention may be used for any frequencies and within for example<br>
radio and communication applications.<br>
The invention is not limited to the shown embodiments but can be varied in a number of<br>
ways without departing from the scope of the appended claims; the arrangement and the<br>
method can be implemented in various ways using different technologies depending on<br>
application, functional units, needs and requirements etc.<br><br>
