				<td>The present invention relates to crystalline carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate hemihydrate and pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a salt of carvedilol and/or corresponding solvates thereof, compositions containing such a salt of carvedilol and/or corresponding solvates thereof, and/or methods of using the aforementioned compound(s) in the treatment of certain disease states in mammals, in particular man.<br>
The present invention further relates to carvedilol phosphate salts, which include novel crystalline forms of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate (i.e., such as dihydrogen phosphate salt of 1-(carbazol-4-yloxy-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]amino]-2-propanol), carvedilol hydrogen phosphate.etc), and/or other corresponding solvates thereof, compositions containing such salts and/or solvates, and methods of using the aformentioned compounds to treat hypertension, congestive heart failure and angina, etc.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The compound, 1-(carbazol-4-yloxy-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]-amino]-2-prbpanol is known as Carvedilol. Carvedilol is depicted by the following chemical structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Carvedilol is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,503,067 to Wiedemann et al. (i.e., assigned to Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH, Mannheim-Waldhof, Fed. Rep. of Germany), which was issued on March 5, 1985.<br>
Currently, carvedilol is synthesized as free base for incorporation in<br><br>
medication that is available commercially. The aforementioned free base form of Carvedilol is a racemic mixture of R(+) and S(-) enantiomers, where nonselective p-adrenoreceptor blocking activity is exhibited by the S(-) enantiomer and a-adrenergic blocking activity is exhibited by both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers. Those unique features or characteristics associated with such a racemic Carvedilol mixture contributes to two complementary pharmacologic actions: i.e., mixed venous and arterial vasodilation and non-cardioselective, beta-adrenergic blockade.<br>
Carvedilol is used for treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure and angina. The currently commercially available carvedilol product is a conventional, tablet prescribed as a twice-a-day (BID) medication in the United States.<br>
Carvedilol contains an a-hydroxyl secondary amine functional group, which has a pKa of 7.8. Carvedilol exhibits predictable solubility behaviour in neutral or alkaline media, i.e. above a pH of 9.0, the solubility of carvedilol is relatively low (
In light of the foregoing, a salt, and/or novel crystalline form of carvedilol with greater aqueous solubility, chemical stability, etc. would offer many potential benefits for provision of medicinal products containing the drug carvedilol. Such benefits would include products with the ability to achieve desired or prolonged drug levels in a systemic system by sustaining absorption along the gastro-intestinal tract of mammals (i.e., such as humans), particularly in regions of neutral pH, where a drug, such as carvedilol, has minimal solubility.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been shown that a novel crystalline form of<br>
carvedilol phosphate salt (i.e., such as carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate and/or carvedilol hydrogen phosphate, etc.) can be isolated as a pure, crystalline solid, which exhibits much higher aqueous solubility than the corresponding free base or other prepared crystalline salts of carvedilol, such as the hydrochloride salt. This novel crystalline form also has potential to improve the stability of carvedilol in formulations due to the fact that the secondary amine functional group attached to the carvedilol core structure, a moiety pivotal to degradation processes, is protonated as a salt.<br>
In light of the above, a need exists to develop different carvedilol forms and/or different compositions, respectively, which have greater aqueous solubility, chemical stability, sustained or prolonged drug or absorption levels (i.e., such as in neutral gastrointestinal tract pH regions, etc.).<br>
There also exists a need to develop methods of treatment for hypertension, congestive heart failure or angina, etc. which comprises administration of the aforementioned carvedilol phosphate salts and/or solvates thereof or corresponding pharmaceutical compositions, which contain such salts, and/or solvates.<br>
The present invention is directed to overcoming these and other problems encountered in the art.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a salt of carvedilol and/or corresponding solvates thereof, compositions containing such carvedilol salts and/or corresponding solvates thereof, and/or methods of using the aforementioned compound(s) in the treatment of certain disease states in mammals, in particular man.<br>
The present invention further relates to carvedilol phosphate salts, which include novel crystalline forms of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate (i.e., such as dihydrogen phosphate salt of 1-(carbazol-4-yloxy-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]amino]-2-propanol), carvedilol hydrogen phosphate.etc.) and/or other carvedilol phosphate solvates thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition, which contains carvedilol phosphate salts and/or solvates thereof.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of treating hypertension, congestive heart failure and angina, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a carvedilol phosphate salt (which include novel crystalline forms), and/or solvates thereof or a pharmaceutical composition (i.e., which contains such salts and/or solvates of carvedilol phosphate), etc.<br>
Carvedilol is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,503,067 to Wiedemann et al. ("U.S. '067 Patent"). Reference should be made to U.S. '067 Patent for its full disclosure, which include methods of preparing and/or using the carvedilol compound, etc. The entire disclosure of the U.S. '067 Patent is incorporated hereby by reference in its entirety.<br>
The present invention relates to a compound, which is a salt and/or novel crystalline forms of carvedilol phosphate (i.e., which include crystalline forms of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate, carvedilol hydrogen phosphate, etc.) and/or solvates of carvedilol phosphate (i.e., which include carvedilol<br>
dihydrogen phosphate hemihydrate, carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (i.e., such as Forms II and IV, respectively, etc.), and/or carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate methanol solvate, etc.)<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been unexpectedly found that carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate can be isolated readily as novel crystalline forms, which displays much higher solubility when compared to the free base of carvedilol. An example in the present invention of a novel carvedilol phosphate salt is a novel crystalline form of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate (i.e., identified as the dihydrogen phosphate salt of 1-(carbazol-4-yloxy-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-propanol).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, other carvedilol phosphate salts, and/or solvates of the present invention may be isolated as different solid and/or crystalline forms. Moreover, a specific identified species of a carvedilol phosphate salt (or a specific identified corresponding solvate species) also may also be isolated in various different crystalline or solid forms. For example, carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate, may be isolated in two different and distinct crystalline forms, Forms II and IV (see, Examples 2 and 4), respectively represented and substantially shown Figures 9 to 6 (for Form II) and Figure 25 (for Form IV), which are represent spectroscopic and/or other characterizing data.<br>
It is recognized that the compounds of the present invention may exist in forms as stereoisomers, regioisomers, or diastereiomers, etc. These compounds may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may exist in racemic and optically active forms. For example, carvedilol may exist as as racemic mixture of R(+) and S(-) enantiomers, or in separate respectively optically forms, i.e., existing separately as either the R(+) enantiomer form or in the S(+) enantiomer form. All of these individual compounds, isomers, and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Suitable solvates of carvedilol phosphate as defined in the present invention, include, but are not limited to carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate hemihydrate, carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (i.e., which include<br>
Forms II and IV, respectively), carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate methanol solvate, and carvedilol hydrogen phosphate, etc.<br>
In particular, crystalline carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate hemihydrate of the instant invention can be prepared by crystallization from an acetone-water solvent system containing carvedilol and HsPCXj.<br>
In accordance with the present invention suitable, solvates of the present invention may be prepared by preparing a slurrying a carvedilol phosphate salt, such as a carvedilol dihydrogen salt, in a solvent, such as methanol.<br>
According to the instant invention, the various forms of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate (i.e. which include salts and/or solvates thereof) are distinguished from each other using different characterization or identification techniques. Such techniques, include solid state 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Infrared (IR), Raman, X-ray powder diffraction, etc. and/or other techniques, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (i.e., which measures the amount of energy (heat) absorbed or released by a sample as it is heated, cooled or held at constant temperature).<br>
in general, the aforementioned solid state NMR techniques are nondestructive techniques to yield spectra, which depict an NMR peak for each magnetically non-equivalent carbon site the solid-state<br>
For example, in identification of compounds of the present invention, 13C NMR spectrum of a powdered microcrystalline organic molecules reflect that the number of peaks observed for a given sample will depend on the number of chemically unique carbons per molecule and the number of non-equivalent molecules per unit cell. Peak positions (chemical shifts) of carbon atoms reflect the chemical environment of the carbon in much the same manner as in solution-state 13C NMR. Although peaks can overlap, each peak is in principle assignable to a single type of carbon. Therefore, an approximate count of the number of carbon sites observed yields useful information about the crystalline phase of a small organic molecule.<br>
Based upon the foregoing, the same principles apply to phosphorus, which has additional advantages due to high sensitivity of the 31P nucleus.<br>
Polymorphism also can be studied by comparison of 13C and 31P spectra. In the case of amorphous material, broadened peak shapes are usually observed, reflecting the range of environments experienced by the 13C or 31P sites in amorphous material types.<br>

The Examples set forth below are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended to limit, in any way, the scope of the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 Form I Carvedilol Dihydrogen Phosphate Hemihydrate Preparation<br>
A suitable reactor is charged with acetone. The acetone solution is sequentially charged with carvedilol and water. Upon addition of the water, the slurry dissolves quicky. To the solution is added aqueous H3P04. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature and carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate seeds are added in one portion. The solid precipitate formed is stirred, then filtered and the collected cake is washed with aqueous acetone. The cake is<br>
dried under vacuum to a constant weight. The cake is weighed and stored in a polyethylene container.<br>
Example 2<br>
Form II Carvedilol Dihydrogen Phosphate Dihydrate Preparation Form I is siurried in acetone/water mixture between 10 and 30°C for several days.<br>
Example 3<br>
Form III Carvedilol Dihydrogen phosphate Methanol Solvate Preparation Form I is siurried in methanol between 10 and 30°C for several days.<br>
Example 4<br>
Form IV - Carvedilol Dihydrogen Phosphate Dihydrate Preparation Carvedilol dihydrogen dihydrogen phosphate is dissolved in an acetone/water mixture. The acetone is removed by distillation. A solid crystallizes during acetone removal and is filtered and dried.<br>
Example 5 Form V - Carvedilol Dihydrogen Phosphate Preparation<br>
Carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate hemihydrate (Form I) was suspended in water, and the suspension was placed on a mechanical shaker at room temperature. After 48 hours of shaking, the solid was isolated from suspension by filtration, then dried in a desiccator under vacuum for a few days.<br>
Example 6<br>
Form VI - Carvedilol Hydrogen Phosphate Preparation<br>
A suitable reactor is charged with acetone. The acetone solution is sequentially charged with SK&amp;F 105517 and water. Upon addition of the water, the slurry dissolves quicky. To the solution is added aqueous H3PO4 (at 1/2 the molar quantity of Carvedilol). The reaction mixture is stirred and allowed to crystallize. The solid precipitate formed is stirred and cooled, then filtered and the collected cake is washed with aqueous acetone.<br>
Example 7<br>
13C and 31P Solid State NMR Data Analysis of Carvedilol Dihydrogen Phosphate Hemihydrate (Form I)<br>
A sample of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate hemihydrate (Form I) was analyzed by solid-state 13C NMR and 31P NMR (i.e., to probe solid compound form structure).<br>
Carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate (Parent MW = 406.5; Salt MW = 504.5) has the following structure and numbering scheme:<br>
Experimental Details and 13C and 31P Analysis<br>
The solid state 13C NMR methods used to analyze compounds of the present invention produce a qualitative picture of the types of carbon sites within the solid material. Because of variable polarization transfer rates and the need for sideband suppression, the peak intensities are not quantitative (much like the case in solution-state 13C NMR).<br>
However, the 31P spectra are inherently quantitative.<br>
For the 13C analysis, approximately 100 mg of sample was packed into a 7-mm O.D. magic-angle spinning rotor and spun at 5 kHz. The 13C spectrum of the sample was recorded using a CP-TOSS pulse sequence (cross-polarization with total suppression of sidebands). An edited spectrum containing only quaternary and methyl carbons was then obtained using an CP-TOSS sequence with NQS (non-quaternary suppression). The 13C spectra are referenced externally to tetramethylsilane via a sample of solid hexamethylbenzene.<br>
For 31P Solid State NMR, approximately 40 mg of sample was packed into a 4-mm O.D. rotor and spun at 10 kHz. Both CP-MAS and single-pulse MAS 31P pulse sequences were used with 1H decoupling. The 31P data are externally referenced to 85% phosphoric acid by a secondary solid-state reference (triphenylphosphine oxide). The Bruker AMX2-360 spectrometer used for this work operates at 13C, 31P and 1H frequencies of 90.556, 145,782 and 360.097 MHz, respectively. All spectra were obtained at 298 K.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
The highly sensitive 13C and 31P Solid State NMR identification methods were used for the analysis and characterization of a polymorphic form of Carvedilol phosphate, which confirms its chemical structure in the solid-state.<br>
The form of Carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate is defined by these spectra, where both 13C and 31P spectra show clear and distinct differences.<br>
In particular, Figure 26 shows the 13C CP-TOSS spectrum of carevedilol dihydrogen phosphate. An assignment of the numerous 13C resonances in Figure 1 can be made by chemical shift assignment, the NQS spectrum and comparisons with solution-state 13C assignments. At least two non-equivalent molecules per unit cell are observed in this form of Carvedilol phosphate.<br>
Figure 27 shows the 31P MAS spectrum of carvedilol dihydrogen phosphate. A single phosphorus signal is observed at 4.7 ppm, which is characteristic of phosphate salts.<br>
