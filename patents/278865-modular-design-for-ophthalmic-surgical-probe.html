				<td>MODULAR DESIGN FOR OPHTHALMIC SURGICAL PROBE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally pertains to microsurgical instruments. More<br>
particularly, but not by way of limitation, the present invention pertains to microsurgical<br>
instruments used in posterior segment ophthalmic surgery, such as vitrectomy probes.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Many microsurgical procedures require precision cutting and/or removal of<br>
various body tissues. For example, certain ophthalmic surgical procedures require the<br>
cutting and/or removal of the vitreous humor, a transparent jelly-like material that fills the<br>
posterior segment of the eye. The vitreous humor, or vitreous, is composed of numerous<br>
microscopic fibers that are often attached to the retina. Therefore, cutting and removal of<br>
the vitreous must be done with great care to avoid traction on the retina, the separation of<br>
the retina from the choroid, a retinal tear, or, in the worst case, cutting and removal of the<br>
retina itself.<br>
The use of microsurgical cutting probes in posterior segment ophthalmic surgery<br>
is well known. Such vitrectomy probes are typically inserted via an incision in the sclera<br>
near the pars plana. The surgeon may also insert other microsurgical instruments such as<br>
a fiber optic illuminator, an infusion cannula, or an aspiration probe during the posterior<br>
segment surgery. The surgeon performs the procedure while viewing the eye under a<br>
microscope.<br>
Conventional vitrectomy probes typically include a hollow outer cutting member,<br>
a hollow inner cutting member arranged coaxially with and movably disposed within the<br>
 <br>
hollow outer cutting member, and a port extending radially through the outer cutting<br>
member near the distal end thereof. Vitreous humor is aspirated into the open port, and<br>
the inner member is actuated, closing the port. Upon the closing of the port, cutting<br>
surfaces on both the inner and outer cutting members cooperate to cut the vitreous, and<br>
the cut vitreous is then aspirated away through the inner cutting member. U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,577,629 (Martinez); 5,019,035 (Missirlian et al.); 4,909,249 (Akkas et al.);<br>
5,176,628 (Charles et al.); 5,047,008 (de Juan et al.); 4,696,298 (Higgins et al.); and<br>
5,733,297 (Wang) all disclose various types of vitrectomy probes, and each of these<br>
patents is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
Conventional vitrectomy probes include "guillotine style" probes and rotational<br>
probes. A guillotine style probe has an inner cutting member that reciprocates along its<br>
longitudinal axis. A rotational probe has an inner cutting member that rotates about its<br>
longitudinal axis. In both types of probes, the inner cutting members are actuated using<br>
various methods. For example, the inner cutting member can be moved from the open<br>
port position to the closed port position by pneumatic pressure against a piston or<br>
diaphragm assembly that overcomes a mechanical spring. Upon removal of the<br>
pneumatic pressure, the spring returns the inner cutting member from the closed port<br>
position to the open port position. As another example, the inner cutting member can be<br>
moved from the open port position to the closed port position using a first source of<br>
pneumatic pressure, and then can be moved from the closed port position to the open port<br>
position using a second source of pneumatic pressure. As a further example, the inner<br>
cutting member can be electromechanically actuated between the open and closed port<br>
positions using a conventional rotating electric motor or a solenoid. U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,577,629 provides an example of a guillotine style, pneumatic piston / mechanical spring<br>
actuated probe. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,909,249 and 5,019,035 disclose guillotine style,<br>
 <br>
pneumatic diaphragm / mechanical spring actuated probes. U.S. Patent No. 5,176,628<br>
shows a rotational dual pneumatic drive probe.<br>
In many conventional vitrectromy probes, the engine and the shell or skin are tied<br>
together to yield a functional probe. A disadvantage to this is that the skin serves as both<br>
an ergonomic component as well as a part that is responsible for function. Changing<br>
between different probe types (i.e. 20, 23, 25 gage probes) requires that the internal<br>
features of the skin be changed to accommodate the corresponding functional interfaces<br>
such as seal design and tip geometry. This results in less flexibility.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for an improved vitrectomy probe that exhibits more<br>
flexibility. Such flexibility should enable future design and manufacturing flexibility,<br>
utilize a number of common components in overall probe design, and be able to convert<br>
to multiple gage size probes using the same engine parts.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is an ophthalmic surgical probe having a skin removably<br>
coupled to an engine, a needle holder, a needle, and a cutter. The engine has a drive shaft<br>
support member and a drive shaft extending axially from the engine. The needle holder<br>
has a bushing disposed therein and an opening for removably engaging the drive shaft<br>
support member. The needle has a first coupling rigidly coupled thereto. The first<br>
coupling is for removably engaging the bushing. The cutter has a second coupling rigidly<br>
coupled thereto. The cutter is slidably disposed within the needle, and the second<br>
coupling is for removably engaging the drive shaft.<br>
 <br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
For a more complete understanding of the present invention, and for further<br>
objects and advantages thereof, reference is made to the following description taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of the ophthalmic surgical probe of the present<br>
invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is an exploded, sectional view of the ophthalmic surgical probe of Figure<br>
1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best<br>
understood by referring to Figures 1-2 of the drawings, like numerals being used for like<br>
and corresponding parts of the various drawings.<br>
Vitrectomy probe 10 consists of engine 12, shell or skin 14, needle holder 16,<br>
drive shaft 18, cutter 20, and needle 24. Although the ophthalmic surgical probe of the<br>
present invention is described herein in connection with a vitrectomy probe 10, the<br>
present invention is applicable to other ophthalmic or other surgical probes, instruments,<br>
and handpieces. Cutter coupling 22 is integrally formed on the proximal end of cutter 20.<br>
Needle coupling 26 is integrally formed on the proximal end of needle 24. Drive shaft 18<br>
extends axially from engine 12. Distal end of drive shaft 18 removably engages cutter<br>
coupling 22 of cutter 20. Drive shaft support member 34 removably engages opening 36<br>
of needle holder 16. Drive shaft support member 34, drive shaft 18, and cutter coupling<br>
22 are disposed within needle holder 16. Bushing 28 within needle holder 16 removably<br>
engages needle coupling 26 of needle 24, such that cutter 20 is slidably disposed within<br>
needle 24. Needle coupling 26, needle holder 16, cutter coupling 22, drive shaft 18, and<br>
 <br>
drive shaft support member 34 are disposed entirely within skin 14. Skin 14 contains<br>
opening 38 which removably engages body 40 of engine 12. Needle 24 extends through<br>
opening 42 in skin 14.<br>
Engine 12 may be any type of engine suitable for driving vitrectomy probe 10, but<br>
is most preferably a pneumatic engine. Drive shaft 18 may be made of any suitable<br>
material, but is most preferably stainless steel. Needle 24 and cutter 20 may be made of<br>
any material suitable for posterior segment ophthalmic surgery, but are most preferably<br>
made from surgical stainless steel. Skin 14, needle coupling 26, and cutter coupling 22<br>
are most preferably made from a lightweight material such as aluminum or rigid plastic.<br>
During manufacturing assembly, the modular design of probe 10 allows a worker<br>
to quickly and easily switch between building probes of various needle gages, such as a<br>
probe 10 with a 20 gage needle 24, a 23 gage needle 24, or a 25 gage needle 24. More<br>
specifically, the ability to quickly attach and remove skin 14 from body 40 of engine 12,<br>
to quickly couple different gages of needle 24 with needle holder 16 and cutter 20 via<br>
needle coupling 26 and bushing 28, and to quickly couple cutter 20 to drive shaft 18 via<br>
cutter coupling 22 greatly increases manufacturing flexibility and simplifies the assembly<br>
process of probe 10.<br>
It is believed that the operation and construction of the present invention will be<br>
apparent from the foregoing description. While the apparatus and methods shown or<br>
described above have been characterized as being preferred, various changes and<br>
modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as defined in the following claims.<br>
