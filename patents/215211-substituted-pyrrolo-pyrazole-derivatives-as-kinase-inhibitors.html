				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
SUBSTITUTED      PYRROLO-PYRAZOLE      DERIVATIVES      AS      K3NASE INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to pyrrolo-pyrazole derivatives, to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and to their use as therapeutic agents, particularly in the treatment of cancer and cell proliferation disorders. Discussion of foe Background<br>
Several cytotoxic drags such as, e.g., fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorabicin and camptothecins, damage DNA or affect cellular metabolic pathways and thus cause, in many cases, an indirect block of the cell cycle. Therefore, by producing an irreversible damage to both normal and tumor cells, these agents result in a significant toxicity and side-effects. In this respect, compounds capable of functioning as highly specific antitumor agents by selectively leading to tumor cell arrest and apoptosis, with comparable efficacy but reduced toxicity than the currently available drugs, are desirable.<br>
It is well known that progression through the cell cycle is governed by a series of checkpoint controls, otherwise referred to as restriction points, which are regulated by a family of enzymes known as the Cyclic-dependent kinases (Cdk). In turn, the Cdks themselves are regulated at many levels such as, for instance, binding to cyclins. The coordinated activation and inactivation of different Cdk/Cyclin complexes is necessary for normal progression through the cell cycle. Both the critical Gl-S and G2-M transitions are controlled by the activation of different Cdk/Cyclin activities. In Gl, both Cdk4/Cyclin D and Cdk2/Cyclin E are thought to mediate the onset of S-phase. Progression through S-phase requires the activity of Cdk2/Cyclin A whereas the activation of Cdc2/Cyclin A (Cdkl) and Cdc2/cyclin B are required for the onset of mitosis. For a general reference, to, • gSgJjn.SL and cyclin-dependentrkinases see, for-instance, Kevin R. Webster et al, in Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 1998, Vol. 7(6), 865-887.<br>
Checkpoint controls are defective in tumor cells due, in part, to disregulation of cdk activity. For example, altered expression of cyclin E and cdks has been observed in tumor cells, and deletion of the cdk inhibitor p27 KIP gene in mice has been shown to result in a higher incidence of cancer.<br>
Increasing evidence supports the idea that the cdks are rate-limiting enzymes in cell cycle progression and, as such, represent molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, the direct inhibition of cdk/cyclin kinase activity should be helpful in restricting the unregulated proliferation of a tumor cell.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide compounds which are useful in treating cell proliferative disorders caused by and/or associated with an altered cell cycle dependent kinase activity. It is another object to provide compounds which have cdk/cyclin kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
The present inventors have now discovered that certain pyrazole compounds are endowed with cdk/cyclin kinase inhibitory activity and are thus useful in therapy as antitumor agents and lack, in terms of both toxicity and side effects, the aforementioned drawbacks associated with currently available antitumor drags.<br>
More specifically, the pyrazole derivatives of the invention are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers including, but not limited to: carcinoma such as bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, including small cell lung cancer, esophagus, gall-bladder, ovary, pancreas, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, and skin, including squamous cell carcinoma; hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage including leukaemia, acute lymphocitic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-ceU-lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett's lymphoma; hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and promyelocytic leukaemia; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including astrocytoma neuroblastoma, glioma and<br>
.•    <. f it- .-></.>
schwannomas;    other   tumors,    including   melanoma,    seminoma,    teratocarcinoma,<br>
osteosarcoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, keratoxanthoma, thyroid follicular cancer and<br>
Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
Due to the key role of cdks in the regulation of cellular proliferation, these pyrazole<br>
derivatives are also useful in the treatment of a variety of cell proliferative disorders such<br>
as,   for   example,   benign   prostate   hyperplasia,   familial   adenomatosis   polyposis,<br>
neurofibromatosis,   psoriasis,   vascular   smooth   cell   proliferation   associated   with<br>
atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis, glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis<br>
and restenosis.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be useful in treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as<br>
suggested by the fact that cdk5 is involved in the phosphorylation of tau protein (J.<br>
Biochem. 117,741-749, 1995).<br>
The compounds of this invention, as modulators of apoptosis, may also be useful in the<br>
treatment of cancer, viral infections, prevention of AIDS development in HTV-infected<br>
individuals, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be useful in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and<br>
metastasis, as well as in the treatment of organ transplant rejection and host versus graft<br>
disease.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also act as inhibitor of other protein kinases, e.g.,<br>
protein kinase C in different isoforms, Met, PAK-4, PAK-5, ZC-1, STLK-2, DDR-2,<br>
Aurora 1, Aurora 2, Bub-1, PLK, Chkl, Chk2, HER2, rafl, MEKl, MAPK, EGF-R,<br>
PDGF-R, FGF-R, IGF-R, PI3K, weel kinase, Src, Abl, Akt, MAPK, ELK, MK-2, IKK-2,<br>
Cdc7, Nek, and thus be effective in the treatment of diseases associated with other protein<br>
kinases.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment and prevention of<br>
radiotherapy-induced or chemotherapy-induced alopecia.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for treating cell proliferative<br>
disorders caused by and/or associated with an altered cell cycle dependent kinase activity,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several heterocyclic compounds are known in the art as protein kinase inhibitors. As an example, 2-carboxamido-pyrazoles and 2-ureido-pyrazoles, and derivatives thereof, have been disclosed as protein kinase inhibitors in the international patent applications WO 01/12189, WO 01/12188, WO 02/48114 and WO 02/70515, all in the name of the applicant itself.<br>
Fused bicyclic compounds comprising pyrazole moieties and possessing kinase inhibitory activity have been also disclosed in WO 00/69846 and WO 02/12242 as well as in WO 03/028720 (PCT/EP02/10534 claiming priority from US patent application No. 09/962162 of September 26, 2001) and copending PCT/EP03/04862 (claiming priority from US patent application 60/381092 of May 17,2002), all in the name of the applicant itself. The compounds object of the present invention fall within the scope of the general formula of the aforementioned WO 02/12242, herewith incorporated by reference, but are not specifically exemplified therein.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, when referring to the compounds of formula (I) per se as well as to' any pharmaceutical composition thereof or to any therapeutic treatment comprising them, the present invention includes all of the hydrates, solvates, complexes, metabolites<br>

Typically, without however representing a limiting example, upon administration of a<br>
compound of formula (I), this same derivative may be converted into a variety of<br>
compounds, for instance including more soluble derivatives like hydroxylated derivatives,<br>
which are easy to be excreted. Hence, depending upon the metabolic pathway thus<br>
occurring, any of these hydroxylated derivatives may be regarded as a metabolite of the<br>
compounds of formula (I).<br>

k) converting them into other compounds of formula (la) or (Ib), respectively, and/or into<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The above process is an analogy process which can be carried out according to methods<br>
well known in the art<br>
From all of the above, it is clear to the person skilled in the art that if a compound of<br>
formula (la) or (Ib), prepared according to the above process, is obtained as a mixture of<br>
isomers, their separation into the single isomers of formula (la) or (Ib), carried out<br>
according to conventional techniques, is still within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Likewise, the conversion into the free compound (la) or (Ib) of a corresponding salt<br>
thereof, according to well-known methods, is still within the scope of the invention.<br>
According to step (a) of the process, a compound of formula (Ilia) or (nib) is reacted with<br>
acrylonitrile in the presence of a suitable base, for instance sodium hydroxide. The reaction<br>
is preferably carried out in water at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to room<br>
temperature.<br>
According to step (b) of the process, the amino group of the compound of formula (IVa) or<br>
(IVb)   is   protected   according  to   conventional   methods,   for   instance   with  tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl anhydride (BocaO) and in the presence of a suitable solvent such as<br>
acetonitrile or dichloromethane, so as to get the corresponding derivative of formula (Va)<br>
or (Vb) wherein the amino protecting group Q just represents tert-butoxycarbonyl (boc).<br>
According to step (c) of the process, the carboxy group of the compound of formula (Va)<br>
or (Vb) is converted into the corresponding alkyl ester derivative, for instance by operating<br>
in the presence of a suitable alkyl halide, for instance methyl iodide.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as dknethylformamide<br>
and under basic conditions, for instance by using sodium or potassium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
According to step (d) of the process, the compound of formula (Via) or (VIb) is converted into the corresponding cyclic derivative of formula (Vila) or (Vllb) through reaction with sodium hydride. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran at refluxing temperature. .<br>
According to step (e) of the process, the compound of formula (Vila) or (Vllb) is reacted with hydrazine hydrate, preferably with an excess of hydrazine monohydrated, for instance up to 10 equivalents, in the presence of a suitable solvent such as halogenated hydrocarbons, lower alcohols or admixtures thereof. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of ethanol, by adding hydrazine to a solution of the compound of formula (Vila) or (Vllb) and under stirring for a suitable time, for instance about 48 hours, at the temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 70°C. Preferably, the above reaction is carried out also in the presence of glacial acetic acid.<br>
According to step (f) of the process, the compound of formula (Villa) or (VHIb) is reacted with ethyl chloroformate so as to get the corresponding derivative of formula (IXa) or (Kb). The reaction is carried out according to well-known operative conditions, in the presence of a suitable base, for instance diisopropylethylamine, and of a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Clearly, the ethoxycarbonyl group may be bound to any one of the.pyrazole nitrogen atoms of both compounds of formula (Villa) and (VTIIb) so as to give rise to the following regioisomers of formula (Ka) or (Kb)<br>
(Formula Remove)<br>
In this respect, each couple of regioisomers of formula (IXa) or (IXb) may be conveniently separated according to well-known methods, for instance under chromatographic conditions, and each regioisomer so isolated subsequently worked out. In the alternative, the mixture of regioisomers can be treated as such in the subsequent steps of the process, without providing any separation.<br>
In fact, as the ethoxycarbonyl group leading to two distinct regioisomers is finally removed at the end of the process, it is clear to the skilled person that both the above pathways can be carried out for preparing the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) of the invention. Preferably, however, the process is carried out by first separating and isolating the regioisomers of formula (IXa) or (Kb) from their mixture, as reported in the working examples, and by subsequently reacting them to the desired compounds. According to step (g.l) of the process, the compound of formula (IXa) or (IXb) is reacted with a suitable derivative of formula (X) wherein Z represents a halogen atom, preferably chlorine or bromine.<br>
Typically, the compound of formula (EXa) or (Kb) is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or the like, and a suitable base such as triethylamine, diisppropylethylamine, sodium carbonate or the !;ke is<br><br>
added. The compound of formula (X) is then added and the mixture stirred for a time of<br>
about 2 to about 15 hours, at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 80°C.<br>
A suitable catalyst such as dimethylamino-pyridine may be optionally used.<br>
According to step (g.2) of the process, the compound of formula (IXa) or (DCb) is reacted<br>
with an isocyanate derivative of formula (XII), by operating substantially as set forth in<br>
step (g.l) of the process, except that the base may not be required.<br>
According to step (g.3) of the process, the compound of formula (IXa) or (IXb) is reacted<br>
with an amine of formula (XIII) in the presence of triphosgene or of a suitable<br>
chloroformate, for instance 4-nitrophenyI chloroformate, so as to get the corresponding<br>
ureido derivative. The reaction is carried out in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or in a suitable<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon, preferably dichloromethane (DCM), and in the presence of a<br>
suitable amine such as diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine at a temperature ranging<br>
from about -70°C to room temperature.<br>
According to step (h) of the process, the protected amino group in formula (XIa) or (Xlb)<br>
is deprotected under well-known operative conditions, for instance under acidic conditions<br>
in the presence of trifluoroacetic or hydrochloric acid.<br>
The compound of formula (XIa) or (Xlb) is thus suspended in a suitable solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane or dioxane, and treated with a concentrated solution of the selected acid.<br>
Alternatively, commercially available solutions of gaseous hydrogen chloride dissolved in<br>
dioxane (4 M HC1) may be advantageously employed. The mixture is then stirred for a<br>
time of about 2 hours to about 15 hours at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about<br>
40°C.<br>
According to any one of steps (i.l), (i.2), (i.3) or (i.4) of the process, the compound of<br>
formula (XTVa) or (XTVb) is further reacted with a suitable derivative so as to obtain the<br>
corresponding carboxamido, ureido or carbamate derivative of formula (XVIa) or (XVIb).<br>
Step (i.l) is carried out with an acyl halide, preferably chloride, of formula (XV) in a<br>
suitable solvent such as dichloromethane and under basic conditions, for instance in the<br>
presence of a suitable amine such as diisopropylethylamine.<br>
The reaction allows to obtain carboxamido derivatives of formula (XVIa) or (XYTb)<br>
wherein R] is as defined in formula (I) under groups from (a) to (c), (Tla) with X as a<br><br>
carbon atom and (lib); from the above, it is clear to the skilled person that the atom of the RI group which is directly linked to the carbonyl moiety of formula (XVIa) or (XVIb) is a carbon atom.<br>
*<br>
Step (i.2) is carried out with a heterocyclic derivative of formula (XVII) or of an amine of<br>
formula (XVni), in the presence of triphosgene, substantially as described under step (g.3)<br>
of the process.<br>
In this respect, step (i.2) allows to obtain ureido derivatives of formula (XVIa) or (XVIb)<br>
wherein RI is a group of formula (Ha) with X as a nitrogen atom or of formula (lie) and<br>
wherein Y, Rc, n, Rd and R'dare as above defined.<br>
Likewise, the condensation of step (i.3) is carried out with a carboxylic acid derivative of<br>
formula (XIX), in the presence of a suitable condensing agent such as, for instance,<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-emyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)<br>
or O-benzotriazolyl tetramethyh'souronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), and by operating<br>
according to well-known methods for preparing carboxamido derivatives.<br>
According to step (i.4) of the process, the compound of formula (XlVa) or (XTVb) is<br>
reacted with a suitable derivative of formula (XX) wherein RI is a group of formula (lid)<br>
and Rc is as set forth in formula (la) or (Ib), so as to obtain the corresponding carbamate<br>
derivatives of formula (XVIa) or (XVIb).<br>
In this respect, the compound of formula (XTVa) or (XTVb) is dissolved in a suitable<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or the like,<br>
and a suitable base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, sodium carbonate or the<br>
like is added therein. The compound of general formula (XX) is then added and the<br>
mixture stirred for a time of about 2 hours to about 15 hours, at a temperature ranging from<br>
about 20°C to about 80°C. According to a preferred embodiment, a suitable catalyst such<br>
as dimethylamino pyridine may be optionally used.<br>
According to step Q of the process, the compound of formula (XVIa) or (XVTb) being<br>
obtained in any one of steps from (i.l) to (i.4) is reacted with a suitable base, for instance<br>
triethylamine, and in the presence of a suitable solvent such as methanol or ethanol so as to<br>
obtain the desired compound of formula (la) or(Jb).<br><br>
Finally, as per step (k) of the process, these latter compounds (la) or (Ib) may be optionally<br>
converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts as formerly reported and by working<br>
according to conventional methods or, alternatively, may converted into additional<br>
compounds of formula (la) or (Ib).<br>
Just as a non limiting example, compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) bearing a carboxyester<br>
function may be converted into a variety of derivatives according to methods well known<br>
in the art to convert carboxyester groups into carboxamides, N-substituted carboxamides,<br>
N,N-disubstituted carboxamides, carboxylic acids, and the like.<br>
The operative conditions are those widely known in the art and may comprise, for instance<br>
in the conversion of a carboxyester group into a carboxamide group, the reaction with<br>
ammonia or ammonium hydroxide in the presence of a suitable solvent such as a lower<br>
alcohol, dimethylformamide or mixtures thereof; preferably the reaction is carried out with<br>
ammonium hydroxide in a mernanol/dimethylformamide mixture, at a temperature ranging<br>
from about 50°C to about 100°C.<br>
Analogous operative conditions apply in the preparation of N-substituted or N,N-<br>
disubstituted carboxamides wherein a suitable primary or secondary amine is used in place<br>
of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Likewise, carboxyester groups may be converted into carboxylic acid derivatives through<br>
basic or acidic hydrolysis conditions, widely known in the art.<br>
As an additional example, compounds of fonnula (la) or (Ib) bearing an amino function<br>
may be easily converted into the corresponding carboxamido or ureido derivatives.<br>
From all of the above it is clear to the skilled person that according to step (k) of the<br>
process, any compound of fonnula (la) or (Ib) bearing a functional group which can be<br>
further derivitized to another functional group, by working according to methods well<br>
known in the art thus leading to other compounds of fonnula (la) or (Ib), has to be<br>
intended as comprised within the scope of the present invention.<br>
According to any variant of the process for preparing the compounds of fonnula (I), the<br>
starting material and any other reactant is known or easily prepared according to known<br>
methods.<br><br>
As an example, whilst the starting materials of formula (Ilia) or (Hlb) are commercially available, the compounds of formula (X), (XII), (XHT), (XV), (XVTI), (XVHI), (XIX) and (XX) are known or can be easily prepared according to known methods. The intermediate compounds of formula (Vila) or (Vllb) of the process<br>
(Formula Remove)<br><br>
wherein Q represents a suitable nitrogen protecting group, for instance tert-butoxycarbonyl (boc), are novel and, hence, respresent a further object of the invention. As it will be readily appreciated, if the compounds of formula (I) prepared according to the process described above are obtained as an admixture of isomers, their separation into the single isomers of formula (I), according to conventional techniques, is within the scope of the present invention. Conventional techniques for racemate resolution include, for instance, partitioned crystallization of diastereoisomeric salt derivatives or preparative chiral HPLC.<br>
In addition, it is clear from the above that a given compound of formula (la) or (Ib) may be prepared either by starting from the mixture of the regioisomers of formula (IXa) or (Kb) or, alternatively, from each one of the two regioisomers themselves. When preparing the compounds of formula (I) according to any one of the aforementioned process variants, optional functional groups within the starting materials or the intermediates thereof and which could give rise to unwanted side reactions, need to be properly protected according to conventional techniques. Likewise, the conversion of these latter into the free deprotected compounds may be carried out according to known procedures.<br>
In addition, the compounds of formula (I) of the invention may be also prepared according to combinatorial chemistry techniques widely known in the art, by accomplishing the aforementioned reactions, .hetj^eea the several intermediates in a seria1 manner and by working under solid-phase-synthesis (SPS) conditions.<br>
(Formula Remove)<br><br>
R<br>
The supported intermediate thus obtained may be then reacted according to step (h) and any one of steps (i.l), (i.2), (i.3) or (i.4) of the process, so as to obtain the corresponding compound of formula (la) or (Ib) of the invention still supported on the polymeric resin. Subsequent resin cleavage, for instance under basic or acidic conditions according to known methods, allows to obtain the desired compounds of formula (la) or (Ib). Clearly, by performing the above reactions of the process in a serial manner, that is by following a combinatorial approach for instance as set forth above, several compounds of formula (la) and (Ib) may be thus prepared and collected. Therefore, it is a further object of the present invention a library of two or more<br>

PHARMACOLOGY<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are active as protein kinase inhibitors and are therefore<br>
useful, for instance, to restrict the unregulated proliferation of tumor cells.<br>
In therapy, they may be used in the treatment of various tumors, such as those formerly<br>
reported, as well as in the treatment of other cell proliferative disorders such as psoriasis,<br>
vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis and post-surgical stenosis<br>
and restenosis and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The inhibiting activity of putative Cdk/Cyclin inhibitors and the potency of selected<br>
compounds was determined through a method of assay based on the use of the SPA<br>
technology (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).<br>
The assay consists of the transfer of radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety by the kinase<br>
to a biotinylated substrate. The resulting 33P-labelled biotinylated product is allowed to<br>
bind to streptavidin-coated SPA beads (biotin capacity 130 pmol/mg), and light emitted<br>
was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>

After 20 min. incubation for substrate capture, 100 ul 5M CsCl were added to allow<br>
statification of beads to the top of the plate and let stand 4 hours before radioactivity<br>
counting in the Top-Count instrument<br>
IC50 determination: inhibitors were tested at different concentrations ranging from<br>
0.0015 to 10 uM. Experimental data were analyzed by the computer program GraphPad<br>
Prizm using the four parameter logistic equation:<br>
y = bottom+(top-bottom)/(l+10A((logIC50-x)*slope))<br>
where x is the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, y is the response; y starts at bottom<br>
and goes to top with a sigmoid shape.<br>
Ki calculation:<br>
Experimental method: Reaction was carried out in buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM<br>
MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 7.5 mM DTT) containing 3.7 nM enzyme, histone and ATP<br>
(constant ratio of cold/labeled ATP 1/3000). Reaction was stopped with EDTA and the<br>
substrate captured on phosphomembrane (Multiscreen 96 well plates from Millipore).<br>
After extensive washing, the multiscreen plates are read on a top counter. Control (time<br>
zero) for each ATP and histone concentrations was measured.<br>
Experimental design: Reaction velocities are measured at different four ATP, substrate<br>
(histone) and inhibitor concentrations. An 80-point concentration matrix was designed<br>
around the respective ATP and substrate Km values, and the inhibitor IC50 values (0.3, 1,<br>
3, 9 fold the Km or IC50 values). A preliminary time course experiment in the absence of<br>
inhibitor and at the different ATP and substrate concentrations allow the selection of a<br>
single endpoint time (10 min) in the linear range of the reaction for the Ki determination<br>
experiment.<br>
Kinetic parameter estimates:  Kinetic parameters were estimated by simultaneous<br>
nonlinear least-square regression using [Eq.l] (competitive inhibitor respect to ATP,<br>
random mechanism) using the complete data set (80 points):<br>
where A=[ATP], B=[Substrate], I=[inhibitor], Vm= maximum velocity, Ka, Kb, Ki the dissociation constants of ATP, substrate and inhibitor respectively, a and p the cooperativity factor between substrate and ATP binding and substrate and inhibitor binding respectively.<br>

the following examples are now given.<br>
General methods<br>
Before taking into consideration the synthetic preparation of the specific compounds of formula (I) of the invention, for instance as reported in the following examples, attention should be given to the fact that some compounds are herewith listed and indicated according to their chemical name whilst others, most of them, have been conveniently and<br>
unambiguously identified through a coding system, together with their 'H-NMR data (see<br>
following tables ffl, IV and V) and HPLC/Mass data (see following table VI).<br>
Each code, in particular, identifies a single specific compound of formula (la) or (Ib) and<br>
consists of three units A-M-B,<br>
A represents any substituent R [see formula (la) or (Ib)] and is attached to the rest of the<br>
molecule through the -NH-group; each specific A group is represented and consecutively<br>
numbered in the following table I.<br>
Likewise, B represents any substituent R! [see formula (la) or (Ib)] and is attached to the<br>
rest of the molecule through the carbonyl (CO) group; each specific B group is represented<br>
and consecutively numbered in the following table II.<br>
M refers to the central core of the divalent moiety which is substituted by groups A and B;<br>
in particular, M may vary from Ml or M2 as per the formulae below, each identifying the<br>
central core of a compound having formula (la) or (Ib), respectively:<br><br><br>
(Formula Remove)<br><br>
For ease of reference, all of the A and B groups of tables I and II have been identified with the proper chemical formula also indicating the point of attachment with the rest of the molecule M.<br>
Therefore, just as an example, the compound A06-M1-B01 of table in represents the<br>
compound of formula (la) having the central Ml core, being substituted by the group A06<br>
and by the group B01, in the positions indicated by the arrows; likewise, the compound<br>
A04-M2-B08 of table V represents the compound of formula (Ib) having the central M2<br>
core, being substituted by the group A04 and by the group BOS, in the positions indicated<br>
by the arrows: (Formula Remove)<br><br><br>

Ethyl 3-[(4-fluorobenzoyl)anmo]-6s6-dimethyl-5,6-dihydropvirolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-l(4H)-carboxylate hydrochloride (0.5 g, 1.3 rmnol), in dichloromethane (25 ml), was treated with N,N-du'sopropylemylamine (1.13 ml, 6.5 mmol, 5 eq) and TBTU (0.542 g, 1.69 mmol, 1.3 eq), at room temperature for 1 hour, and then l-methyl-piperidine-4-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (0.29 g, 1.61 mmol, 1.2 eq) was added. The reaction was stirred overnight (TLC: CH2Cl2/MeOH 90/10). The solution was washed with saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate aqueous solution and brine, the organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in methanol (16 ml), treated with TEA (2 ml, 14.3 mmol, 11 eq) and stirred overnight at room temperature. (TLC: CH2Cl2/MeOH7NH,OH 90/10/1). After evaporation, the solid was purified by flash chromatography (eluent: CH2Cl2/MeOH/NH4OH 90/10/2). The solid was treated with<br>
diisopropylether and filtered to afford 0.36 g of the title compound in 69% yield.<br>
