mixture of (R,S) enantiomers, and as the single (R) or (S) enantiomers, or a<br>
salt thereof,<br><br><br>
wherein R is a protected amino group; and the asterisk * indicates the<br>
stereogenic carbon atom.<br>

and, if desired, the resolution of tire mixture of (R,S) enantiomers of the<br>
compound of formula (I) to yield the single (R) or (S) enantiomer.<br>
	R] is preferably a CrC4 alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl or tert-butyl, in particular ethyl or propyl; or benzyl or phenylethyl.<br>
A salt of a compound of formula (II) is for example a salt with a<br>
mineral acid, preferably an hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric or<br>
     hydrobromic    acid,   or   an   organic   acid,    such   as    acetic,   oxalic   or<br>

camphorsulfonic acid.<br><br><br>
According to the present invention, a protected amino group R can be, for example, a protected amino group in the form of an acylamino, carbamoyl, arylmethylamino, phthalimido or silylamino group.<br>
In an acylamino group, acyl is for example formyl or Ci-C6-CO- alkyl, 5    preferably acetyl, propionyl or pivaloyl, optionally substituted with 1 to 3 halogen atoms, such as chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
In a carbanToyl group, the amino group is linked, for example, to a CrC6 alkoxy-carbonyl group, wherein the alkyl residue is straight or branched, optionally substituted with phenyl. The alkyl residue is preferably a 10 CrC4 alkyl group, optionally substituted with phenyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, benzyl or phenylethyl. in particular tert-butyl.<br>

More preferably the R group is acetylamino, propionylamino or pivaloylamino.<br>
	The hydrolysis of a compound of formula (II) can be carried out by<br>
reaction with an alkali hydroxide, for example sodium or potassium hydroxide, in amounts from about 1 to 4 equivalents, preferably from 1.5 to 2.5 equivalents, in a polar protic solvent, for example water or C|-C4 alkanols,<br><br>
in particular methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, or mixtures thereof; at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to the solvent reflux, preferably from about 10 to 50°C, in particular at approx. 20°C.<br>
According to the invention, a mixture of (R,S) enantiomers can contain 5 the two single enantiomers in any ratio to each other. The enantiomeric purity is generally expressed as "enantiomeric excess" and defined, for example, for the (S) enantiomer as (S-R)/(R+S)xlOO wherein S and R are respectively the amounts of the (S) and (R) enantiomers. According to the invention, the expression single (S) or (R) enantiomer means that the enantiomeric purity is<br>
     usually at least about 96%, preferably at least about 99%.<br>
The optional resolution of the mixture of (R,S) enantiomers of a compound of formula (I) into the single (R) or (S) enantiomers can be carried out, for example, by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts of a compound of formula (I) obtained by reaction with optically active,<br>
enantiomericaiiy" pure acids or bases. An example is the reaction of the compound of formula (I) with an enantiomerically pure aliphatic or aromatic amine, for example a-methylbenzylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, cinchonidine and cinchonine; or with an enantiomerically pure acid, for example tarMric acid or camphorsulfoak acid, in a solvent capable of<br>
promoting the formation of the salt and the subsequent precipitation of the desired diastereomer. Examples of said solvents are CrC4 alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol and i-propanol; ketones, such as acetone; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; alkyl esters, such as ethyl acetate; amides, such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; dimethylsulfoxide; or mixtures<br>
thereof or mixtures of one or more of them with water. The temperature can range from room temperature to the solvent reflux temperature. Alternatively, the resolution can be carried out by means of preparative chromatography using a chiral, optically active stationary phase, including the "Simulating<br><br>
Moving  Bed"  (8MB)  technology.   A   further  alternative   consists   in   the<br>
enzymatic resolution, either by selective hydrolysis of one stereoisomer of an<br>
ester of formula (II) to an acid of formula (I), or by selective esterification of<br>
one stereoisomer of an acid of formula (I) to an ester of formula (II).<br>
	The conversion of a compound of formula (I) into a salt thereof can be<br>
obtained with known methods.<br>
An object of the invention is also a compound of formula (II), and the salts thereof, as a mixture of (R,S) enantiomers and as the single (R) or (S) eriarLtiomers.<br>

Rearrangement can be effected for example according to the Schmidt, Lessen, Hofmann or Curtius reactions.<br>
The sequence of the products formed during the rearrangement reaction is the following:<br><br><br><br><br>
(I)	(la)	(lb)<br>
OCN<br>
H Rs°vVx<br>
^x\    e<br><br><br>
T<br>
(Ic)	(Id)	(VII)<br>
in which Y is NHOCOR4, N3 or NH2, wherein R4 is as defined above; R5 is hydrogen or stoight w branched Ci-C4 alkyl; and R and R3 are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formulae (la), (Ib), (Ic) and (Id) can optionally be 15     isolated during the reaction. The compounds of formulae (la), (Ib), (Ic) and (le), either as mixture of (R,S) enantiomers or as the single (R) or (S) enantiomers, are novel compounds and are a further object of the invention.<br>
All of the Schmidt, Lessen, Hofmann and Curtius reactions make use of an isocyanate of formula (Ic) as defined above.<br>
	A compound of formula (Ic) can be prepared according to the Schmidt<br>
reaction, treating a compound of formula (I) with hydrazoic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid, to obtain a compound of formula (la), wherein Y is N3 and R is as defined above, which is converted to the corresponding compound of formula (Ic) by heating.<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula (Ic) can prepared according to the Lessen reaction, by reaction of a compound of formula (I) with a halogenating agent, preferably thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, and subsequent reaction with an acyl-hydroxylamine, preferably acetyl-hydroxylamine, thereby 5 obtaining the respective acylated hydroxamic acid, i.e. a compound of formula (la) wherein Y is NHOCOR4 and R is as defined above. Treatment of the latter with an alkali hydroxide affords a compound of formula (Ic).<br>
Again, a compound of formula (Ic) can be prepared according to the<br>
Hofmann reaction, by transforming the carboxylic acid into amide according<br>
     to known methods, i.e. into a compound of formula (la) wherein Y is NH2 and<br>
R  is  as  defined  above,  then   treating  it  with  an  alkali  hypohalogenite,<br>
preferably sodium hypochlorite.<br>
Finally, a compound of formula (Ic) can be prepared according to the<br>
Curtius reaction, by reaction of a compound of formula (I) with a halogenating<br>
     agent, preferably thionyl chloride-or oxalyl chloride, and subsequent treatment<br>
with sodium azide to obtain the respective acyl-azide of formula (la) wherein<br>
Y is N3 and R is as defined above; or directly with diphenylphosphorylazide,<br>
in   the    presence    of   an    organic    base,    in    particular    triethylamine,<br>
diisopropytethylamine or pyridine. The acyl-azide of formula (la) is converted<br>
    to the corresponding compound of formula (Ic) by heating.<br>
j^<br>
The rearrangement reactions reported above are carried out according to known methods, for example at a temperature approx. ranging from about 10°C to the reflux temperature, for a time ranging between 2 hours and 15 hours, preferably between 5 hours and 10 hours.<br>
	More particularly, a compound of formula (la), in which Y is N3, is<br>
poured in water in the presence of an acidic agent, thereby converting it to a compound of formula (Id) as defined above. An acidic agent is for example a mineral or organic acid, in particular hydrochloric, sulfuric, formic or acetic<br><br>
acid, in amounts ranging from about 2 to about 5 mols, preferably from about 2.5 to about 3.5 mols. The reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging from room temperature to the reaction mixture reflux, preferably from about 50 to about 80°C. When the nucleophilic solvent is for example water, in the 5 resulting compound of formula (Id) R5 is hydrogen. Alternatively, when the nucleophilic solvent is for example a Ci-C* alkanol, in particular methanol, ethanol or i-propanol, in the resulting compound of formula (Id) R5 is alkyl.<br>
According to a preferred aspect, the rearrangement reaction to form the<br>
acyl-azide of formula (la) in which Y is N3 is carried out according to Curtius<br>
     in a nucleophilic solvent, as  defined above. The reaction  proceeds until<br>
formation of a compound of formula (Id) wherein R5 is a straight or branched<br>
C]-C4 alkyl group, with no need for isolating any intermediate.<br>
A compound of formula (Id) in which R5 is hydrogen spontaneously<br>
transforms into a compound of formula (VII), wherein Ra is a protected amino<br>
     group, R is as defined above and R3 is hydrogen. A compound of formula (Id)<br>
in which R5 is alkyl is a compound of formula (VII) wherein R3 is a R4-O-CO-<br>
group, as defined above and Ra is a protected amino group.<br>
Alternatively, when a compound of formula (la), in which Y is N3, is poured in water, or vice versa, a compound of formula (le) 20<br><br>
-R1<br>
(le)<br>
wherein R and R' are as defined above is obtained, which is hydrolysed<br>
to a compound of formula (VII) wherein Ra is a free amino group, R3 is<br>
hydrogen and the asterisk * has the meaning defined above. The hydrolysis is<br>
    typically an acidic hydrolysis, for example by treatment with hydrochloric<br>
acid according to known methods.<br><br>
The alkylation of a compound of formula (Vll) and, if the case, the<br>
removal of the primary amino group protecting group and, if present, of the<br>
R4-O-CO- group from the secondary amino group present in a compound of<br>
formula (VIII), can be carried out according to US 4,886,812.<br>
	It has now been found a particularly advantageous process for the<br>
conversion of a compound of formula (VII) to a compound of formula (VIII) in which R3 is hydrogen and Ra is as defined above. It should be stressed that a compound of formula (VIII) in which R3 is hydrogen and Ra is -NH2 is pramipexole. Therefore, the invention.provides a process for the preparation<br>
of pramipexole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, comprising the acylation of a compound of formula (VII), in which R3 is hydrogen and Ra is as defined above, either as a mixture of (R,S) enantiomers or as the single (S) enantiomer, by reaction with propionic anhydride and subsequent reduction of the compound of formula (IX) thus obtained,<br><br>
(IX)<br>
wherein Ra is as defined above, by treatment with an alkali metal borohydride and molecular iodine to obtain a compound of formula (VIII) wherein R3 is hydrogen and Ra is as defined above; followed, if necessary, by 20 deprotection of the primary amino group and/or by resolution of the mixture of the (R,S) enantiomers into the single (S) enantiomer and, if desired, by conversion of pramipexole into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The acylation is preferably carried out on a compound of formula (VII),<br>
as the single (S) enantiomer, in particular having the enantiomeric purity as<br>
    obtainable according to present invention. The acylation of a compound of<br><br>
formula (VII) with propionic anhydride can be carried out according to known methods.<br>
An alkali metal borohydride is for example NaBH4 or KBH4, preferably<br>
NaBH4. The amount of alkali metal borohydride used in the reduction, for<br>
     example NaBH4, is about 1-5 mols per mole of compound of formula (IX),<br>
preferably from about 2 to 4 mols, whereas the molar amount of iodine is<br>
about 0.5-3 mols per mole of compound of formula (IX), preferably from<br>
about 1 to 2. The reduction of a compound of formula (IX) is preferably<br>
earned out in an ether solvent, such as tetiakyd+ofuran, dioxane or diethyl<br>
     ether, in particular tetrahydrofuran. The reaction can be carried out at a<br>
temperature ranging from about 0°C to the reflux temperature, preferably at<br>
approx. 20-40°C.<br>
A pramipexole pharmaceutically acceptable salt is for example an addition salt with an organic or mineral acid, as reported in 15 US 4,886,812, preferably the dihydrochloride, and can be obtained with known procedures.<br>
The process of the invention for the preparation of pramipexole is particularly advantageous for the production on an industrial scale. In fact, the resolution of the enantiomers takes place during the first synthetic steps and 20 moreover the discarded enantiomer can be recovered by racemization and recycled. This attains a reduction in the by-products of the more expensive final products and higher yields.<br>
