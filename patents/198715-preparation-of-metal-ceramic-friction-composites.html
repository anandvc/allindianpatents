				<td>The present invention relates to new process for the preparation of novel sintered metal-ceramic friction materials. The invention further discloses process for the use of these materials in applications involving frictional engagements that result in dissipation of high kinetic energies and also produce high temperatures and thermal gradients.<br>
Metal-ceramic friction material composites exhibiting (i) strong and thermally stable metallurgical bond between the friction materials and the supporting back plate, (ii) reduction in noise and judder during high energy frictional engagements in service and (ill) demonstrating high wear - life. The effort is to achieve structures in the resultant friction material that have structural stability, cracking and chipping resistance in the face of steep thermal gradients and loads imposed during service and in particular when subjected to continuous high kinetic energy dissipation applications. The copper and iron based friction material composites are intended for use in applications such as brake pads or liners in brakes of aircraft, high speed trains and heavy commercial vehicles(HCV). The applications of these friction composites also include transmission of high speed / torque in gear boxes and transmission clutch units of HCVs, ships, helicopters and battle tanks.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Various investigators in the past have attempted to achieve materials and processes to for frictional engagements and applications. A brief review will illustrate earlier attempts.<br>
U S Patent No. 3,946,192 describes a process of electrical resistance sintering and<br>
braze bonding of a number of small copper base metallic friction material elements on to<br>
a steel backing plate pre coated with brazing metal/alloys of copper/tin/nickel using two<br>
opposed electrodes and passage of electric cuaent for a short duration. This process<br>
could involve at least three heating/pressing steps instead of a much-desired single<br>
pressure sintering process. The brazed bonds done by resistance brazing for a short<br>
duration as described in this cannot withstand arduous service conditions of very high<br>
torque loads and thermal gradients in high-energy frictional situations such as aircraft<br>
braking. The patent does not address the case of feasibility of this process of bonding<br>
for larger friction material elements and when low thermal conductivity friction material<br>
composites of iron base, possessing a large volume fraction of ceramics, are to be<br>
bonded. The patent also does not address the issues of friction and wear rate of the<br>
friction m.aterial disc and the finer issues such as the structural /thermal stability of the<br>
friction material and ability for noise/judder damping which are critical in most<br>
applications.	^<br><br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3.528,807 and 3,761,256 also deal with brazing bonds where a material is located between a preformed friction material and the bottom of a retainer cup. Although the braze bond can work well in a cup type of design, the cost of the brazing material is high and furthermore this process is again limited to copper base friction materials in a cup type design.<br>
US Patent No. 4,050,620 describes a method of making a brake friction pad which includes the steps of placing a copper base sintered friction material into a retainer cup, heating the friction material and the retainer cup to a temperature of 1400 to 1650^ in an inert atmosphere, and striking the friction material with a single blow of a compressive force between 7000 and 20,000 psi force. This single blow is claimed to increase the density of the friction material and establish a metallurgical bond between the friction material arid the retainer cup. This patent is limited to bonding in copper based cup type friction material elements and does not address bonding in iron base friction materials and flat plate type of configurations.<br>
A typical mechanical bond of copper based friction material in retaining cup is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,784,105 where the sintered friction material is held in a retainer cup by crimping the sides of the cup against the friction material. Although the bonding on the sidewalls is good, the friction material with the cup bottom is not sufficiently strong and is mostly limited to welded screen. The integrity of the friction material with the bottom of the cup depends on the strength of the spot welds with the cup bottom.<br>
The U.S. Patent No. 4,311,524 uses copper, tin, zinc sulphide, pyroceramic, graphite and lead etc. mixed in iron powder, formed by pressure under 294 MPa, then sintered at 1030.degree. C. for three hours under protected atmosphere of 1.96 Mpa. It describes the above composition and the powder metallurgy process of preparation for a specific application condition of operation under liquid lubrication and moderate frictional performance modes. The patent claims a superior wear resistance of the resulting friction material under liquid lubrication conditions but does not indicate the wear performance of the material under dry operating conditions. Moreover, the patent is only limited only to a specific composition of an iron base friction material and does not cover other compositional ranges and copper base materials. The issues related to the nature of bonding and noise damping are also not investigated.<br><br>
U S Patent No. 4,415,363 also describes the formulation and preparation of a sintered iron base friction material. It discloses a specific formulation with iron-tin alloy as the matrix and equal portion mix of graphite - coke incorporated to impart a constant wear upto 300° C and a predictable linear wear between 300 and 500° C. The patent is specific in nature as it describes only an iron base friction material and also does not address the issue of use of a back plate and it"s bonding with the friction material.<br>
U S Patent No. 4,456,578 relates to the method and apparatus for producing a friction element for a disc brake. This patent also describes a method of electrical resistance sintering and bonding of essentially a number of copper based friction materials to an electrically conducting back plate. The method applies specifically to disc brakes used in motorcycles and cars and does not address the problems related to continuous high kinetic energy dissipation applications.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,871,394 uses copper powder mixed with silicon dioxide (or alumina), graphite, lead, tin and zinc, pressed to form green bodies of density 2.9.about.3.1 g/cm.sup.3, with a core plate pinched by two green bodies, and sintered for 1 hour at 650.degree. C. under 0.52 MPa protected in non-oxidizing atmosphere. This patent also is limited to a specific copper base composition suitable for operation only under oil lubrication. The aspects of bond strength and wear resistance have not been addressed.<br>
U S Patent No. 5,5&amp;5,266 describes bonding a friction material brake lining element to a metallic backing plate element. This patent deals with organic resin bonded friction materials and does not address the issues of metal-ceramic sintered friction materials. US patent no. 6,139,673 also deals with bonding of an organic resin based friction material with a metallic back plate.<br>
U S Patent No. 5,824,923 covers frictional and physical properties of composite copper alloy powder sintered friction material and therefore is limited in scope as it does not include iron base materials and also does not qualify the aspects of bonding of the friction material to a backing plate.<br><br>
U S Patent No. 5,925,837 covers manufacturing method and products of metallic friction materials and includes processes of (i) preparing powder materials, (ii) mixing copper as a base, proper proportion of iron powder or steel wool, aluminum powder, zinc or tin or lead powder, graphite powder and alumina or silicon dioxide powder, (iii) pressing mixed materials into green bodies under 375 to 625 MPa at room temperature, (iv) pre-heat treating the green bodies in an air furnace with temperature raised to 100 to SOO.degree. C. for 1 to 3 hours, (v) sintering the green bodies into test samples under 350 to 750 MPa for 24 to 60 hours to gain sintered friction materials having an oxidized layer of less than 1 mm thick, (vi) processing and grinding the sintered test samples with grinders to remove the oxidized layer, (vii) washing the outer surface of the sintered test samples ground into finished products. Products according to the invention has friction coefficient within the standard value, low wear loss and good heat stability. This patent does not address the issues of a strong, thermally stable inferfacial bonding with a backing plate and material integrity at elevated service temperatures. Further it is limited to essentially copper based friction materials.<br>
U S Patent No. 6,004,370A sintered friction material especially suitable for use in a braking system has a matrix of a copper-system metal such as copper, tin, nickel and aluminum, and contains a specific additive, graphite and potassium titanate as friction conditioners. The specific additive consists of at least one material selected from a group consisting of zirconium oxide, silica, dolomite, orthoclase and magnesium oxide. The specific additive, the graphite and the potassium titanate are preferably blended in volume ratios of 1 to 15%, 10 to 50% and 5 to 30% respectively. The fonri of the potassium titanate is at least one of whiskery, platy and spherical forms and preferably plate-like or spherical. The sintered friction material has good abrasion resistance, low abrasion of the counterpart, a high friction coefficient, excellent material strength, good chattering resistance, and good squealing resistance. Although this patent addresses the problem of judder reduction and material integrity, is limited to sintered copper based friction materials and does not cover the aspects of bonding with a backing plate or cup.<br>
U S Patent No. 6,143,051 describes a friction material comprising a sintered mass of iron in which graphite particles are dispersed, which sintered mass is formed from between 13 and 22 vol. % of iron fibers, between 13 and 22 vol. % of iron particles having a particle size of 10-400 ^.m, between 40 and 70 vol. % of graphite particles having a particle size of 25-3000 jam, and between 10 and 15 vol. % of a metallic binder having a melting point of 800-1140.degree. C, and a method of preparing such a friction<br>
/<br><br>
material, wherein a mixture of these components is compressed at a pressure of at least 100 MPa so as to form a compact having a desired form and size, and where the compact thus formed is sintered at a temperature between 800 and 1140.degree. C. for a period of time which is sufficiently long for achieving concretion of iron fibers, iron particles and metallic binder. This patent describes development of a specific iron based friction material with good a thermal material integrity. However interfacial bonding of the material with a back plate is not attempted.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

copper based compositions using cup type backing), (viii)    Single or multi layer compaction of the metal-ceramic friction material mix with or<br>
without adhesive / cushioning layers or compaction of cup-composite loose<br>

In yet another embodiment of the invention Hydrogen atmosphere pressure sintering using variable hydraulic "pull type" loading and static dead weight type loading is employed.<br><br>
in another embodiment of the invention a rapid suiphamate nickel-plating process is introduced for building up thick stress free nickel coating on steel upto 0.15 mm thickness possessing good adhesion power.<br>

(i)        Mixing of metallic powders such as iron, copper, tin, lead, zinc, antimony, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, ferroalloys etc., of specified particle size ranges in-dry state in a roller type pot mill for 1-6 hrs<br>
(ii) Wet mixing of ceramic ingredients (i.e., friction additives/friction stabilisers) such as Silicon Carbide/Nitride, Silica, Aluminosilicates, Barium/Calcium Sulphate etc in alcohol medium in a pasty consistency for 1-4 hrs followed by drying at 60 -100 °C.<br>
(iii) Mixing of metallic mix and dried ceramic mix in a blender for 1-4 hours followed by adding of solid lubricants/friction modifiers/ anti-seizure additives such as natural /synthetic graphite. Ferrous Sulphide, H-Boron Nitride, steel wool fibres etc., and further mixing for 2-8 hours<br>
The final metal-ceramic friction composite mix composition is as follows :<br>
metallic ingredients	: 45- 70% by weight<br>
ceramic ingredients	: 10-30 % by weight<br>
solid lubricants/modifiers	: 10-30% by weight<br>
(B)	Preparation of the alloy steel back plate/cup/contalner<br>
Two types of alloy steel for backing plates are used in the manufacture of copper and iron base friction materials, v.i.z..<br><br>
(a-Type) low to medium plain carbon steel back plates with a hardness of 170 HV maximum to aid forming into cups, forming embossments and other shaped projections<br>
and<br>
(b-Type) medium carbon HSLA steel back plates with a final hardness up to 550 HV with high hardenability and thermal curling resistance and used as backing for high -energy-high temperature friction material compositions.<br>
Processing of "a" type back plates involves the following steps<br>
•	Receiving the raw materials as continuous strip coils in cold rolled and bright annealed condition (thickness from 1.0 to 2.5 mm)<br>
•	Blanking and piercing to segmental shape with a central hole<br>
•	Cup drawing, multiple embossment fonning, shaped rivet seat forming<br>
•	Degreasing,  cleaning and blasting with fine sand to make active surface/ increase surface area<br>
OR<br>
Spot welding of perforated metal blank/mesh/grid on bottom of cup in cup design for copper based composites ^  •    Nickel  or  copper plating/coating  from  cyanide/acid/sulphamate  bath  to  a thickness of 10 - 30 microns<br>
•	Diffusion treatment in hydrogen atmosphere furnace at 800-850 °C for 1-3 hours (applicable only to nickel plating/coating)<br>
•	Ductility and adhesion test of plating by bend test  of the nickel/copper coated back plate/cup by 90 ° minimum<br>
Processino of "b" type back plates<br>
•	Receiving raw material as straight strip lengths or plates in hot rolled and spheroidise annealed condition (thickness from 2.0 to 5.0 mm)<br>
•	Blanking and piercing to segmental shape with multiple, precise rivet holes or machining to back plates /discs<br>

•	Diffusion treatment in hydrogen atmosphere furnace at 900-950 °C for 2-3 hours<br>
•	Adhesion test of plating by metallography of the nickel/copper coated back plate or by abrasion tests/peel tests<br>
(C)	Loose sintering of copper based friction composites involving cup shaped<br>
backing container<br>
In case of copper base friction composites, particularly of higher final thickness, an additional sintering step is carried out prior to compaction on loose mass of friction powder mix contained in the copper plated and spot welded formed cup-mesh assembly. A measured quantity of mix from step (A) is poured Into the backing cup. Since the volume of loose powder will be quite high the vertical cup wall is extended all round by wrapping it with a stainless steel sheet welded canister. Several such assemblies are arranged in Inconnel / Nimonic alloy boats and loose sintering of the powder mix in the cups is carried out in a hydrogen atmosphere continuous type of furnace at a temperature between 700 to 900 "C for 1-3 hours. The reusable canisters are then stripped off the loose sintered cup-assemblies and these are then subjected to compaction in the next operation.<br>
(D)	Preparation of single or multi layer friction material compacts<br>
{]) For iron base fiiction cx&gt;mposites:<br>
•	Cold die compaction of the friction material element comprising of one or more layers, such as adhesive/cushion layer (0.5 to 2.0mm thick) of pure sponge iron powder and friction material layer (2.0 - 5.0 mm thick) of iron base friction material mix prepared as per para A above<br>
•	Compaction is carried out in a die using a hydraulic press at pressures from 440 to 590 MPa and dwell times at pressure from 20 - 40 seconds. The compact is segmental in shape and about 0.5 to 1 mm undersize all round from the profile of the corresponding back plate. The friction material top face of the compact is flat but the bottom pure sponge iron face has technological projections to facilitate precise location of the compact on the back plate when they are assembled together.<br><br>
,/•<br><br>
•    In case of a formed cup type steel backing the above two layers are directly compacted in to the nickel plated cup housed in the die.<br>
f/7j For copper based friction composites:<br>
Formed cup type design of bacl
For thin friction material elements (up to approximately 3 mm friction material layer) friction composite powder mix is directly cold compacted into the cup housed in the compaction die using a hydraulic press at pressures of 310 to 460 MPa and dwell time at pressure from 10 to 25 seconds. For thicker friction material thickness loose sintered friction material - cup assembly is cold compacted in a die at pressures between 235 to 385 MPa and dwell time at pressure between 5 to 10 second<br>
Flat plate design of back plate either in segment stiape or annular disc shape<br>
Friction material compact is made separately as in the case of iron base composites. However only single layer cold die compaction of the friction material mix is carried out at pressures of 310 to 460 MPa and 10-25 seconds dwell time<br><br>
(E)     Pressure sintering of friction material back plate assemblies<br>
"Pressure sintering" is achieved by the following methods:<br>
(i)      Applying a static dead weight load on the powder compact - back<br>
plate/cup assembly at high temperature in a reducing atmosphere<br>
furnace (ii)    Applying   pressure   by two  opposing  electrodes  and  heating   by<br>
passing current through the assembly as done in resistance sintering (iii)   Variable hydraulic or pneumatic compressive or "pushing"    pressure<br>
application  on the  assembly at high temperature in a  reducing<br>
atmosphere furnace (iv)   Variable   hydraulic   or   pneumatic   tensile   or   "pulling"   pressure<br>
application  on the  assembly at high temperature  in  a  reducing<br>
atmosDhere furnace<br><br>
(v)    By hot pressing in a die by hydraulic press and heating the die and part by induction heating/cartridge resistance heating.<br>
Iron base flat plate type and cup type of configurations as well as copper base flat plate type and disc type configurations have been subjected to method (iv), whereas copper base cup type configurations have been subjected to method (i)<br>
(a)       For iron based friction composites<br>
This comprises of the following steps :<br>
(i) Assembly of the friction material compact on the back plates with the pure iron layer facing the nickel-plated back plate surface and its technological projections housed in the respective holes in the back plate, (in case of cup type design this step is not required)<br>
(ii) Stacking of the friction material - back plate assemblies into vertical stacks(1) with appropriate high temperature ceramic paper separators and preparing three vertical stacks. In case of back plates with projections additional inconnel / nimonic alloy fixture plates with necessary clearances/holes to house these projections are used. Three vertical stacks are made with about 30 to 60 friction material - back plate assemblies per stack. These stacks are placed, 120 ° apart from each other, on a circular graphite cushion block placed on the pressure sintering furnace refractory base. The height of the vertical stacks shall be equal. On top of the stacks one more graphite cushion block is placed. A pressure plate made of nimonic alloy is placed on top of the graphite cushion block. A water-cooled central circular pull rod enters the furnace base from the bottom and passes through central holes in the top and bottom graphite cushion blocks and the pressure plate and projects beyond the top of the pressure plate. This projected length has an undercut groove all round and this receives two steel split rings which help lock the pressure plate against the pull rod. After the pressure plate is locked, the hydraulic pressure on the stacks is gradually increased till the set value. For pressure sintering of iron based friction materials a hydraulic load con-esponding to a pressure of about 2.5 to 3.5 Mpa is applied. The pressure is kept at about 1.5 Mpa initially. An inconnel bell shaped furnace muffle is then lowered on to the base to cover the charge and the base. Hydrogen gas is then<br><br>
introduced into the muffle and then the heating hood of the furnace is lowered to sun-ound the muffle and the heating is started.<br>
Pressure sintering is carried out in the following steps :<br>
Temperature Range	Soaking time    Pressure  H2 gas flow rate<br>
(°C)	(Minutes)      (Mpa)        (NmVhr)<br>
400 to 550	30-45        1.5-2.0	0.5-1.0<br>
750 to 900	15-25       2.0-2.5	0.2-0.3<br>
950to1050	120-180        2.5-3.5	0.2-0.3<br>
(final temp)<br>
In case of cup type designs in iron based friction composites the hydraulic pressure is restricted between 1.5 and 2.0 Mpa in order to prevent cup wall defonnation. The other parameters are however the same as above.<br>
(b)   In case of copper based friction composites<br>
(i)     For cup type designs that have undergone pre-sintering and pre-bonding by loose sintering prior to compaction<br>
Pressure sintering is carried out in the above set up in a similar way but instead of using a variable and positive hydraulic load during pressure sintering a static dead weight load is applied on the stacks of cup shaped friction material compact assemblies which is equivalent to a pressure of 0.2 to 0.4 Mpa. Heating during sintering is carried out in two steps as follows :<br>

No heat treatment is required for friction material elements backed by "a" type low carbon steel back plate.<br>
(ii)       The friction material elements are then coined and sized to remove distortion and impart final density to the friction material in a hydraulic .press under flat dies at a pressure of 235 to 465 l\/IPa"for dwell time from 5 to 10 seconds<br>

A 1.3 mm thick 0.2% plain carbon steel sheet used as a backing member was formed in the shape of a segmental cup of top area of 30 sq cm with a wall height of about 5 mm. A,jnesh / grid blanked out from a perforated steel sheet of 0.3 mm thickness was spot welded at 4 places at the inside bottom of the steel cup. The assembly was copper plated from a cyanide bath to a copper coating thickness of approximately 20 microns.<br>
Measured quantity of the above powder mix was poured into the copper plated cup as obtained above after wrapping the cup wall all round with a stainless steel canister to increase the height of the cup to receive the extra volume of powder. The powder was lightly rammed in to this assembly. 18 such assemblies were an^anged in an Inconnel boat and subjected to loose sintering in a laboratory type hydrogen atmosphere pusher type continuous furnace at 750 °C for a total soaking period of 1 hour.<br>
The loose sintered assemblies were then compacted in a shaped die using a.hydraulic press at a load of 100 tons and dwell time of 15 seconds.<br>

A 5mm thick, medium carbon ( 0.35% C) alloy steel plate ( Cr-Mo-V steel ) was machined out in the shape of an annular disc of dimensions : OD = 180 mm and ID = 150 mm to be used as a backing member. Quantity 5 nos. of these machined discs were copper plated from a cyanide bath to a copper coating thickness of approximately 35 microns.<br>
Measured quantity of the above powder mix ( 90 gms ) was poured into a die cavity assembled on a 250 Ton hydraulic press. The die was designed and manufactured in a shape and size so as to produce annular compacts of 180 mm OD and 150 mm ID. Accordingly the die cavity ID was maintained at 180*°^ mm con^esponding to the OD of the compact and the ID of the compact was formed by a core block of 150"°"" mm dia, centrally housed in the die cavity. The powder mix was filled up in the annular space between the core block and the die wall to a fill height of approximately 5 mm.

Compaction was carried out at a load of 240 tons and dwell time of 15 seconds.<br>
Ten compacts made. Two compacts were taken each time and assembled on either side of the copper plated steel annular disc. Five such assemblies were prepared and were then arranged in one single vertical disc stack. The stack was then placed centrally on a pressure sintering furnace base.

Scientific Explanation, Novelty and Inventive steps with respect to prior art<br>
The process for manufacture of iron base friction materials has the following improved features as compared with the prior art:<br>
(a)	In case of iron base friction composites, a thick nickel coating is given on the back<br>
plate by electroplating from a sulphamate bath to a thickness of 50 to 150 microns<br>
on high strength back plates ( meant for high energy-high temperature capability<br>
friction material). The plating is stress free , has high strength and ductility and has<br>
very high adhesion power. This enables a very strong and sound metallurgical bond<br>
between the friction material and the back plate and retention of the bond at<br>
elevated service temperatures and steep thermal gradients encountered in high<br>
energy aircraft braking. The thickness of the plating and also the interfacial alloying<br>
with the friction material pure iron sponge layer on one side and the steel back plate<br>
on the other side ensures a gradual variation of thermal expansion from the friction<br>
material side to the back plate and this ensures retention of a good bonding and the<br>
bonding layer"s capability to withstand very high torque and shear loads at elevated<br>
temperatures during aircraft braking. The requirement of thickness of nickel plating<br>
on low carbon-lower strength and thinner back plates is lower, i.e., of the order of<br>
10-30 microns, due to better ductility and lower thickness of the back plate.<br>
(b)	The pure iron layer comprising of sponge iron powder which is juxtaposed between<br>
the friction material layer and the nickel plated layer and of a thickness from 0.5 to<br>
2.0 mm is incorporated as a special feature by making a multi layer compact. The<br>
sponge iron layer very importantly acts as a cushion layer of good compressibility<br>
due to its high sponginess. This characteristic allows the effective damping of<br>
vibrations/judder/noise caused during braking. This layer also acts as a medium to<br>
further ensure good bonding between the friction material and the steel back plate<br>
through the intermediate nickel layer. The fineness of the sponge iron powder used<br>
and the high porosity of the Sponge iron layer offers a large suri"ace area for<br>
ensuring a good diffusion bonding of the back plate with the friction material. A<br>
portion of lower melting copper/tin, which are the ingredients of the friction material,<br>
also percolate to this sponge iron layer during pressure sintering by capillary action<br>
and are believed to enhance the noise/judder damping characteristics. This structure<br>
also prevents excessive cariDurisation of the back plate which could otherwise occur<br>
by diffusion of carbon from the friction material through the nickel layer.<br><br>
As an example the above unique functions of the multi layers in the friction material assembly is essential to meet the following demanding service conditions ;<br>
The kinetic energy of braking in a modem day high speed jet fighter of a large civilian transport or military aircraft is of the order of several millions of Joules( typically 15 -25 MJ) . This enormous quantum of energy when absorbed by the friction material elements of the brakes within a very short interval of 10 - 15 seconds after landing imposes very severe and steep thermal gradient of more than 5000°C per cm across the friction element section. This leads to a situation where the contacting surface of the friction material may be at a instantaneous temperature of 2000°C whereas the back plate may be closer to ambient temperature. This causes instantaneous and high thermal e)q3ansion on the friction material and at the same time the back plate resists this expansion and therefore the interfacidi layers will be subjected to enormous level of tensile stress which could lead to catastrophic bond failure during service. The sponge iron layer due to a large volume of porosity neutralises the expansion gradient to a large extent due to the pores acting as "stress sinks". The nickel coated layer also contributes to neutralising the thermal gradient due to a compositional gradient that exists across its thickness. The compositional gradient arises due to its alloying with some of the friction material ^   ingredients on one side and with the back plate elements on the other side.<br>
(c)	The diffusion treatment of the nickel plated back plates earned out at temperatures between 800 to 950 ° C in hydrogen atmosphere ensures a sound metallurgical diffusion bonding of the nickel plated layer to the alloy steel back plate which is a prerequisite to the further bonding between the back plate and the friction material. The treatment also serves to ensure a complete stress free and ductile nickel coating with high adhesion power.<br>
(d)	Loose sintering, on copper based friction composites with a cup type backing design, is carried out with the purpose of achieving a superior bonding between the friction material and the backing cup which is realised due to a much higher surface area offered at the bonding interface by a loose mass of powder when heated up to the sintering temperature compared to a fully compacted material. Further this bonding is also aided due to incipient melting of the low melting point metals such as tin/antimony etc which could easily percolate to the bonding interface   in a highly<br><br>
porous mass of powder by strong capillary forces. In the same way during the process of loose sintering particle to particle bonding within the friction powder mass is also enhanced due to easy diffusion of atomic spedes through higher total surface area. This diffusion is aided by the incipient melting of the low melting elements which offer channels of liquid medium for easy transport of diffusing atoms. This also ensures that the friction material will have a higher inter-particle bonding to resist material chipping / break-away in the face of steep temperature gradients encountered during high energy frictional engagements. Loose sintering as a pre-sintering and bonding step is also necessitated in a cup type of design because during final pressure sintering only a small static dead weight load is applied on the friction composites in order to prevent defonnation of the cup walls during the process.<br>
(e) The three step pressure sintering carried out on iron based friction composites and the two step process applied to copper based composites achieve the following beneficial effects:<br>
(i) effective alloying between the various metallic species due to good diffusion under pressure , temperature and a reducing hydrogen atmosphere<br>
(ii) effective sintering and densification and good inter-particle bonding between metallic and ceramic constituents in the friction material due to thorough and uniform distribution of lower melting elements, under pressure and temperature, by capillary action<br>
(iii) effective carbon diffusion in the iron matrix leading to a more profuse peariitic structure<br>
Besides the high quality and thermally stable metallurgical bonding that is achieved, all the above also lead to the following beneficial properties/characteristics of the friction material<br>
(a)	Enhanced,   unifonn   and   more   predictable   dynamic   friction   and   torque characteristics of the friction material during brake application<br>
(b)	Enhanced wear-life of the friction material<br>
(c)	Enhanced resistance to thermal degradation, chipping and material break-away during high energy braking and therefore a higher capability to withstand steep<br>
"    thermal gradients	^<br><br>
