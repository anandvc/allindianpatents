The compounds of the present invention exhibit excellent herbicidal effects when used as an active ingredient (ai) of a herbicide. The herbicide can sometimes be used for a wide range of applications, for example on crop lands such as paddy fields, upland farms, orchards and mulberry fields, and non-crop lands such as forests, farm roads, playgrounds, and factory sites. The application method may be suitably selected for soil treatment application and foliar application.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are capable of controlling noxious weeds including grass (gramineae) such as barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), green foxtail (Setaria viridis), goosegrass (Eleusine indica L.), wild oat (Avena fatua L), Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), quackgrass (Agropyron repens), alexandergrass (Brachiaria plantaginea), paragrass (Panicum purpurascen), sprangletop<br>
" (Leptochloa chinensis) and red sprangletop (Leptochloa paniced); sedges (or Cyperaceae) such as rice flatsedge (Cyperus iria L.), purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundas L.), Japanese bulrush (Scirpus Juncoides), flatsedge (Cyperus serotinus), small-flower umbrellaplant (Cyperus<br>
" dijformis), slender spikerush (Eleocharis acicularis), and water chestnut (Eleocharis kuroguwai); alismataceae such as Japanese ribbon wapato (Sagittaria pygmaea), arrow-head (Sagittaria trifolia) and narrowleaf waterplantain (Alisma canaliculatum); ponttderiaceae such<br><br><br>
as monochoria (Monochoria vaginalis) and monochoria species (Monochoria korsakowii); scrophulariaceae such as false pimpernel (Lindernia pyxidaria) and abunome (Dopatrium Junceum); lythraceae such as toothcup (Rotala indica) and red stem (Ammannia multiflora); and broadleaves such as redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvciieaf (Abutilon theophrasti), morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), prickly sida (Sida spinosa L.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), slender amaranth (Amaranthus viridis L), sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia'), black nightshade (Solatium nigrum L.), pale smartweed (Polygonum lapathifolium L.), common chickweed (Stellaria media L.), common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.), flexuous bittercress (Cardamine jlexuosa WITH.;, henbit (Lamium amplexicaule L.) and threeseeded copperleaf (Acalypha austraiis L.). Accordingly, it is useful for controlling noxious weeds non-selectively or selectively in the<br><br>
cultivation of a crop plant such as corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.), cotton (Gossypium spp.), wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa L), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), sorgo (Sorghum bicolor Moench), rape (Brassica napus L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.), Japanese lawngrass (Zoysia Japonica stend), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) or flax (Linum usitatissimum L.).<br>
For use as herbicides, the active ingredients of this invention are formulated into herbicidal compositions by mixing herbicidally active amounts with inert ingredients known to the art to facilitate either the suspension, dissolution or emulsification of the active ingredient for the desired use. The type of formulation prepared recognizes the facts that formulation, crop and use pattern all can influence the activity and utility of the active ingredient in a particular use. Thus for agricultural use the present herbicidal compounds may be formulated as water dispersible granules, granules for direct application to soils, water soluble concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), microemulsion, suspoemulsion, invert emulsion or other types of formulations, depending on the desired weed targets, crops and application methods.<br>
These herbicidal formulations may be applied to the target area (where suppression of unwanted vegetation is the objective) as dusts, granules or water or solvent diluted sprays. These formulation may contain as little as 0.1% to as much as 97% active ingredient by weight.<br><br>
Dusts are admixtures of the active ingredient with finely ground materials such as clays (some examples include kaolin and montmorillonite clays), talc, granite dust or other organic or inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the active ingredient; these finely ground materials have an average particle size of less than 50 microns. A typical dust formulation will contain 1 % active ingredient and 99% carrier.<br>
Wettable powders are composed of finely ground particles which disperse rapidly in water or other spray carriers. Typical carriers include kaolin clays, Fullers earth, silicas and other absorbent, wettable inorganic materials. Wettable powders can be prepared to contain from 1 to 90% active ingredient, depending on the desired use pattern and the absorbability of the carrier. Wettable powders typically contain wetting or dispersing agents to assist dispersion in water or other carriers.<br>
Water dispersible granules are granulated solids that freely disperse when mixed in water. This formulation typically consists of the active ingredient (0.1% to 95% active ingredient), a wetting agent (1-15% by weight), a dispersing agent (1 to 15% by weight) and an inert carrier (1-95% by weight).   Water dispersible granules can be formed by mixing the ingredients intimately then adding a small amount of water on a rotating disc (said mechanism is commercially available) and collecting the agglomerated granules. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients may be mixed with an optimal amount of liquid (water or other liquid) and passed through an extruder (said mechanism is commercially available) equipped with passages which allow for the formation of small extruded granules. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients can be granulated using a high speed mixer (said mechanism is commercially available) by adding a small amount of liquid and mixing at high speeds to affect agglomeration. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients can be dispersed in water and dried by spraying the dispersion through a heated nozzle in a process known as spray drying (spray drying equipment is commercially available). After granulation the moisture content of granules is adjusted to an optimal level (generally less than 5%) and the product is sized to the desired mesh size.<br>
Granules are granulated solids that do not disperse readily in water, but instead maintain their physical structure when applied to the soil using a dry granule applicator. These granulated solids may be made of clay, vegetable material such as corn cob grits, agglomerated<br><br>
silicas or other agglomerated organic or inorganic materials or compounds such as calcium sulfate. The formulation typically consists of the active ingredient (1 to 20%) dispersed on or absorbed into the granule.  The granule may be produced by intimately mixing the active ingredient with the granules with or without a sticking agent to facilitate adhesion of the active ingredient to the granule surface, or by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent, spraying the dissolved active ingredient and solvent onto the granule then drying to remove the solvent. Granular formulations are useful where in-furrow or banded application is desired.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are homogeneous liquids composed of a solvent or mixture of solvents such as xylenes, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone or other proprietary commercial compositions derived from petroleum distillates, the active ingredient and an emulsifying agent or agents. For herbicidal use, the EC is added to water (or other spray carrier) and applied as a spray to the target area. The composition of an EC formulation can contain 0.1% to 95% active ingredient, 5 to 95% solvent or solvent mixture and 1 to 20% emulsifying agent or mixture of emulsifying agents.<br>
Suspension concentrate (also known as flowable) formulations are liquid formulations consisting of a finely ground suspension of the active ingredient in a carrier, typically water or a non-aqueous carrier such as an oil. Suspension concentrates typically contain the active ingredient (5 to 50% by weight), carrier, wetting agent, dispersing agent, anti-freeze, viscosity modifiers and pH modifiers. For application, suspension concentrates are typically diluted with water and sprayed on the target area.<br>
Solution concentrates are solutions of the active ingredient (1 to 70%) in solvents which have sufficient solvency to dissolve the desired amount of active ingredient. Because they are simple solutions without other inert ingredients such as wetting agents, additional additives are usually added to the spray tank mix before spraying to facilitate proper application.<br>
Microemulsions are solutions consisting of the active ingredient (1 to 30%) dissolved in a surfactant or emulsifier, without any additional solvents. There are no additional solvents added to this formulation. Microemulsions are particularly useful when a low odor formulation is required such as in residential turfgrass applications.<br><br>
Suspoemulsions are combinations of two active ingredients. One active ingredient is made as a suspension concentrate (1-50% active ingredient) and the second active is made as a emulsifiable concentrate (0.1 to 20%). A reason for making this kind of formulation is the inability to make an EC formulation of the first ingredient due to poor solubility in organic solvents. The suspoemulsion formulation allows for the combination of the two active ingredients to be packaged in one container, thereby minimizing packaging waste and giving greater convenience to the product user.<br>
The herbicidal compounds of this invention may be formulated or applied with insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, nematicides, fertilizers, plant growth regulators or other agricultural chemicals. Certain tank mix additives, such as spreader stickers, penetration aids, wetting agents, surfactants, emulsifiers, humectants and UV protectants may be added in amounts of 0.01% to 5% to enhance the biological activity, stability, wetting, spreading on foliage or uptake of the active ingredients on the target area or to improve the suspensibility, dispersion, redispersion, emulsifiability, UV stability or other physical or physico-chemical property of the active ingredient in the spray tank, spray system or target area.<br>

Test Example<br>
A standard greenhouse herbicide activity screening system was used to evaluate the herbicidal efficacy and crop safety of these test compounds. Six broadleaf weed species including redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus, AMARE), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti, ABUTH), sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia, CASOB), ivyleaf morningglory<br><br>
(Ipomoea hederacea, IPOHE), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album, CHEAL) and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L,, AMBEL) were used as test species. Four grass weed species including green foxtail (Setaria viridis, SETVI), barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli, ECHCG), Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense, SORHA), and large crabgrass (Digiiaria sanguinalis, DIGSA) were also used. In addition, three crop species, field corn (Zea mays L., var. Dekalb 535, CORN), soybean (Glycine max L., var. Pella 86, SOY), and upland rice (Oryza sp., var.Tebonnet, RICE) were included.<br>
Test Example 1. Pre-emerge test<br>
All plants were grown in 10 cm square plastic pots which were filled with a sandy loam soil mix. For pre-emerge tests, seeds were planted one day prior to application of the test compounds. Immediately after application, test units of the pre-emerge applications were watered at the soil surface to incorporate the test materials. Subsequently, these test units were bottom-watered.<br>
All test compounds were dissolved in acetone and applied to the test units in a volume of 187 1/ha. Test materials were applied at rates ranging from 125 g ai/ha to 1000 g ai/ha using a track sprayer equipped with a TJ8001E even flow flat fan spray nozzle. Plants were arranged on a shelf so that the top of the canopy (post-emerge) or top of the soil surface (pre-emerge) was 40-45 cm below the nozzle. Pressurized air was used to force the test solution through the nozzle as it was mechanically advanced (via electrically driven chain drive) over the top of all test plants/pots. This application simulates a typical commercial field herbicide application.<br>
Test Example 2. Post-emerge test<br>
In the post-emerge test, a commercial non-ionic surfactant was also included (0.25% v/v) to enhance wetting of the leaf surfaces of target plants at rates ranging from 63g ai/ha to 1000 g ai/ha. For post-emerge tests, seeds were planted 8-21 days prior to the test to allow emergence and good foliage development prior to application of the test substances. At the<br><br>
time of the post-emerge application, plants of all species were usually at the 2-3 leaf stage of development. Post-emerge test units were always bottom-watered.<br>
At 14 days after application of the test materials, phytotoxicity ratings were recorded. A rating scale of 0-100 was used as previously described in Research Methods in Weed Science, 2nd edition, B. Truelove, Ed., Southern Weed Science Society, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, 1977. Briefly, "0" corresponds to no damage and "100" corresponds to complete death of all plants in the test unit. This scale was used both to determine efficacy against weed species and damage to crop species. Herbicide activity data for various compounds of this invention, which are shown by compound number in Tables 1-9, are shown in Tables 13 and 14. The data demonstrate significant differences between compounds for both efficacy against weeds and selectivity for crop species. For selected compounds, excellent activity against a majority of the weed species was observed with minimal damage to at least one of the crop species.<br><br>

The compositions of the present invention may be used in admixture with or in combination with other agricultural chemicals, fertilizers or phytotoxicity-reducing agents. In such a case, they may exhibit even better effects or activities. As other agricultural chemicals, herbicides, fungicides, antibiotics, plant hormones, insecticides, or acaricides may, for example, be mentioned. Especially with herbicidal compositions having the compounds of the present invention used in admixture with or in combination with one or more active ingredients of other herbicides, it is possible to improve the herbicidal activities, the range of application time(s) and the range of applicable weed types. Further, the compounds of the present invention and an active ingredient of another herbicide may be separately formulatet' so they may be mixed for use at the time of application} or both may be formulated together. The present invention covers such herbicidal compositions.<br>
The blend ratio of the compounds of the present invention with the active ingredient of other herbicides can not generally be defined, since it varies depending on the time and method of application, weather conditions, soil type and type of formulation.
