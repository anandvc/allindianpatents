1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"A Process for preparation of stable sustained release antimalarial formulation"<br>
2. APPLICANT (S)<br>
(a) NAME: IPCA LABORATORIES LIMITED<br>
(b) NATIONALITY: INDIAN<br>
(c) ADDRESS: 48, Kandivli Industrial Estate, Mumbai - 400 067, Maharashtra, India<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and its use thereof.<br><br>
Technical Field:<br>
This invention relates to sustained release antimalarial formulation comprising Primaquine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt which has reduced side effects typically associated with the dosing of primaquine and method for preparing the same.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Malaria is one of the most serious protozoal infections in man. According to estimation made in the 90's, about 300 to 500 million people develop clinical infection and one million die of severe infection every year. India is also among the countries to have endemic regions of the disease. It is, therefore, of prime concern and requirement to have therapeutically safe agents for multiple use, especially those that block transmission of malaria through the individuals visiting endemic regions [The Lancet, 350, 717(1997)].<br>
Malaria is caused by infection with any one of the four species of Plasmodia. The transmission of malaria, is through the injection of sporozoites by the bite of mosquitoes. These sporozoites develop in the mosquito feeding on an individual carrying mature gametocytes. Primaquine, over the years, has been the clinical drug of choice with widespread use in the treatment of relapsing Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale malaria [Drugs, 39, 160(1990) D. M. Panisko et al. ibid 39, 337(1990) J. S Keystone].<br>
Primaquine has no sporontocidal activity when provided directly to the insects but has strong gametocytocidal activity and even stops transmission of resistant isolates when mosquitoes are fed on infected blood from primaquine treated animals. Thus, primaquine is also a strong transmission blocking agent. However, primaquine even being associated with radical curative and gametocytocidal activities is not in use as a prophylactic agent.<br>
Primaquine, used clinically as phosphate salt. Primaquine phosphate is a synthetic 8-aminoquinoline derivative.  After oral  administration, the drug  is  usually  well<br><br>
absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels in 1-2 hours, and then is almost completely metabolized and excreted in the urine.<br>
The problems associated with use of 8-aminoquinolines are mainly related to their toxicity because of prolonged use. Primaquine is known to induce hemolytic lesions in patients suffering from a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G-6PD). Anemia is a common complication of hemolysis. Primaquine produces metabolites like o-quinone and p-quinomine functionalities, which because of their oxidative nature, oxidise unsaturated fatty acid of erythrocytes causing red blood cell (RBC) lysis.<br>
Primaquine is absorbed and metabolized very fast and as a consequence, oxidative burst ocuurs very fast. Therefore, its controlled delivery may result in less toxicity.<br>
In clinical practice normally the toxicity of primaquine precludes administration of a single curative dose for humans. Thus, to achieve a radical cure of P. vivax in humans, the dose is ordinarily given in divided doses over 14 to 21 days. This is accompanied with a three-day course of chloroquine, a suppressive drug to clear the blood of schizonts which may "leak" from the tissue cycle of parasite development.<br>
In addition to therapeutic activity against the parasitic infections, primaquine in combination with clindamycin has been successfully used for the treatment as well as prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients [South. Med. J., 83, 403(1990) R. Kay et al.; Lancet i, 1046(1989) E. Toma et al.; Clin. Infect. Dis., 14: 183(1992) G. S. Noskinm et al.].<br>
Over the years, several attempts have been made to improve the therapeutic index of primaquine against malaria and Leishmania through modification of its chemical structure. Introduction of 4-methyl and 5-phenoxy [J. Med. Chem. 25, 1094(1982) M. P. LaMontagne et al.; ibid, 25, 1097(1982) E. A. Nodiff et al.] or alkoxy groups [J. Med. Chem. 30, 1193(1987) E. H. Chen et al.] have produced analogs with much superior tissue and blood schizonticidal activity.<br>

The compounds are highly effective antimalarial agents. In addition, these drugs exhibit significantly better therapeutic indices than primaquine.<br>
US 20060263427 disclosed herein are controlled-release quinine formulations, methods of preparing the same and methods of preventing or treating malaria by administering the same. The controlled-release quinine formulations may help to reduce or eliminate adverse side effects typically associated with the dosing of quinine.<br>
The dosage formulation in the form of sutstain-release tablets are ofetnly be taken less frequently than instant release formulations and that they keep the drug levels steady in the bloodstream. In sustained release tablets formulation, the active ingredient is embedded in the matrix of insoluble substance and it dissolvs through the holes in the matrix.<br>
Thus, there is a need of sustained release pharmaceutical composition with reduced dosage frequency, with enhanced therapeutic effectiveness, minimized side effects and better patient compliances.<br>
The object of the present invention is to prepare a sustained release pharmaceutical formulation of Pramiquine or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the treatment of malaria and methods of preparing the same.<br>
Summary Of The Invention:<br><br>
The invention discloses a monolithic matrix with dosage form that improves patient compliance and reduces the dosage frequency to once daily for the treatment of malaria.<br>
The invention further discloses a dosage form of primaquine that sustained the release of primaquine in such a manner that an effective concentration in blood can be maintained over a longer period of time to improve therapeutic efficacy and minimize the side effects.<br>
