				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/862,540 filed October 23, 2006. The CBi receptor family is primarily found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and to a lesser extent in several peripheral organs. The CB2 receptor is found primarily in the immune system. The pharmacology and therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been reviewed (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, 8, 301- 313; Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., A. Doherty, Ed.; Academic Press, NY 1999, Vol. 34, 199- 208; Exp. Opin. Ther. 2000, 10, 1529-1538; Trends in Pharma. Sci. 2000, 21, 218-224). CBi receptor agonists have been associated with stimulation of feeding, anemetic properties, analgesia, reduction in intraocular pressure in glaucoma, and alleviation of muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis. Conversely, CBi receptor antagonists have been shown effective for reducing feeding and body weight in animal models of obesity. However, most compounds that modulate CBi receptor activity have the pharmacological property of inverse agonism which reduces basal CBi receptor signal transduction as well as the activity of blocking CBi agonist dependent receptor stimulation.<br><br>
A number of selective, centrally acting CBi receptor compounds are currently in development for the treatment of obesity. Nevertheless, there still remains a need for CBi receptor compounds which have increased in vivo potency which are low molecular weight, and have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that provide therapeutic benefit while minimizing adverse events. See for example WO 2007/020502.<br><br>
In addition to appentency disorders, CBi inverse agonists have been shown to further potentiate the activity of antipsychotic agents in assays. Although current antipsychotic therapies are more or less effective at controlling positive symptoms, such therapies are not as effective in treating the negative and cognitive symptoms, rendering many patients incapable of leading normal lives. Convergent evidence suggests drugs that enhance neuronal activation in specific brain areas, hippocampal, striatal, and cortical areas in particular, would be effective in treating both negative and cognitive symptoms. In addition, the weight loss effects of CBi receptor compounds have been demonstrated in animal models of antipsychotic treatment-induced weight gain and therefore may also be <br><br>
effective in controlling the treatment-emergent weight gain and metabolic syndrome seen with current antipsychotic therapies.<br><br>
Moreover, CBi receptor compounds have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in animal models of alcohol drinking and therefore may be useful in the treatment of substance abuse.<br><br>
While oral administration is a preferred route of drug delivery, many CBi receptor compounds suffer from poor oral bioavailability as a consequence of their limited solubility in aqueous media and their metabolic lability. Because of the high lipophilicity of the endogenous cannabinoid ligands and the complementary site to which they bind in the CBi receptor, known CBi receptor compounds are also highly lipophilic. This high lipophilicity leads to poor solubility in aqueous media which limits oral absorption and bioavailability. See for example WO 2007/020502.<br><br>
In addition, compounds which are rapidly metabolized by the liver may undergo metabolic conversion following absorption from the small intestine and prior to reaching the general circulation. During this process, reactive metabolic intermediate (s) may be formed and subsequently may react with other nucleophiles in the body (such as proteins,<br><br>
DNA, RNA, etc.). This could lead to toxicity issues. This so-called "first pass effect" also limits drug bioavailability. See for example WO 2007/020502.<br><br>
In conclusion, there is a need for CBi receptor compounds that have good bioavailability, have increased in vivo potency, are highly selective over CB2, are more readily soluble than previous molecules, and do not form reactive metabolites which could subsequently cause toxicity issues. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.<br><br>

The present invention provides a method of treating a condition in a mammal which is treatable by blockade of CBi receptors via an inverse agonism mechanism in simultaneous, separate or sequential combination with an antipsychotic agent, the method comprising administering to a patient an effective amount of a compound according to any one of Formula (I) or (Ia), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
Compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as diastereomeric mixtures, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of the compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) are contemplated as aspects of the present invention.<br><br>
While compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) in their racemic form are useful agents, it is generally preferable to administer compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) in which one of the enantiomeric forms has been enriched. A preferred aspect of this invention provides compounds of Formulas (Id),or (If) that are substantially pure enantiomers. As such, each of the following specific classes of compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) and (If) are contemplated as aspects of the present invention:<br><br>
(a) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 80% enantiomeric excess; (b) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 90% enantiomeric excess;<br><br>
(c) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 95% enantiomeric excess; and <br><br>
(d) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 99% enantiomeric excess. These enantiomerically pure compounds may be prepared by purification of the desired enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) from a mixture of enantiomers of this compound. The desired enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) may also be prepared by synthesis according to the following general schemes by using precursors that are substantially enantiomerically pure. Those skilled in the art will recognize that either resolution of final compounds or of intermediates will provide compounds of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic) and (Ie) in substantially enantiomerically pure form, to yield for example, compounds of Formulas (Id),or (If) and will employ the method which is most convenient.<br><br>
It will be further recognized that a substantially pure diastereomer may be isolated from a mixture of diastereomers using methods known in the art. Methods for purification of diastereomers include the use of chromatography and crystallization. A mixture of enantiomers may be separated into the individual substantially pure enantiomers by the process known as resolution. Enantiomers may be resolved through the use of chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Suitable chiral solid phases include polysaccharide-based stationary phases such as Chiralpak AD and Chiracel OJ (sold by Chiral Technologies, Inc.). Additionally, enantiomers of basic compounds may be resolved by conversion to a mixture of diastereomeric salts by treatment with a chiral acid. The desired diastereomeric salt is isolated by, for example, crystallization. The substantially enantiomerically pure basic compound may be isolated by treatment with base. Examples of chiral acids include (-)-tartaric acid, (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-mandelic acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-ditoluoyltartaric acid and (+)-ditoluoyltartaric acid. Enantiomers of acidic compounds may be resolved in an analogous manner using a substantially enantiomerically pure base. Examples of such bases include R-alpha- methylbenzylamine, S-alpha-methylbenzylamine, and brucine. Another method for the resolution of a racemic mixture involves reaction with a substantially enantiomerically pure chiral reagent (referred to here as a chiral auxiliary) to form a covalent bond. This reaction results in a mixture of diastereomers, which is purified according to methods known in the art. All, or a portion, of the chiral auxiliary may then be cleaved from the molecule to generate a compound which is substantially enantiomerically pure. In some <br><br>
cases, the asymmetric center introduced by the chiral auxiliary may be retained in the final product.<br><br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain disclosed intermediate compounds may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen, and is thus considered tautomeric. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are contemplated as an aspect of the present invention. Each of the forms of the tautomer may exist, interconvert, and undergo the tautomerization under the conditions specified.<br><br>
Compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) and (If) are selective for the CBi receptor in preference to the CB2 receptor. There is evidence suggesting that these CBi receptor ligands act as inverse agonists.<br><br>
Compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) and (If) are modulators of the CBi receptor, and as such are useful for prevention and treatment of conditions associated with the CBi receptor. Such conditions include, for example, memory deficits, cognitive disorders, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, stress, Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders (particularly to opiates, alcohol, and nicotine), obesity, metabolic disorders, and eating disorders associated with excessive food intake. See DSM-IV-TR., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Revised, 4th Ed., Text Revision (2000). See also DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Ed., (1994). The DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR were prepared by the Task Force on Nomenclature and Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association, and provides descriptions of diagnostic categories. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for pathologic psychological conditions and that these systems evolve with medical scientific progress. The compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) and (If) can also be used to ameliorate weight gain, whether or not the associated weight gain subject can be classified as clinically obese.<br><br>
An effective amount of the compounds of Formulas (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) and (If) may be administered to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis in order to practice the present methods of therapy. The need for a prophylactic administration according to the methods of the present invention is determined via the use of well-known risk factors. The effective amount of an individual compound is <br><br>
determined, in the final analysis, by the physician in charge of the case, but depends on factors such as the exact disease to be treated, the severity of the disease and other diseases or conditions from which the patient suffers, the chosen route of administration other drugs and treatments which the patient may concomitantly require, and other factors in the physician's judgment. The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) or (If) will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) or (If) and its route of administration.<br><br>
The dose may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, based on the properties of the individual compound selected for administration and/or the characteristics of the dosage form (i.e., modified release), the dose may be administered less frequently, e.g., weekly, twice weekly, monthly, etc. The unit dosage may be correspondingly larger for the less frequent administration. When administered via, transdermal routes, or through a continual intravenous solution, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br><br>

It will be understood that the compounds of the present invention described below may exist as distinct crystal forms prepared by crystallization under controlled conditions.<br><br>
Scheme I<br><br><br>
In Scheme I, a compound of Formula (II) may be prepared by the method described by Andreichikov and coworkers (Andreichikov, et al. Zhurnal Organicheskoi Khimii 22(10), 2208-13 (1986)), in which a mixture of an amine of Formula (1) and an aldehyde of Formula (2) is treated with an ester of pyruvic acid (3), where Qi is a Ci_3 alkyl group, in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include glacial acetic acid, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, and toluene. This reaction may also be performed in the <br><br>
presence of solvent mixtures containing these solvents. Suitable esters of pyruvic acid include ethyl pyruvate. The reaction may proceed at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent or solvent mixture. In some cases, the product (II) may precipitate during the course of the reaction or upon addition of a solvent in which the product is not highly soluble. These solvents include diethylether, heptane, MTBE, acetone, water, toluene, and pentane and mixtures thereof. If a precipitate is formed, the compound of Formula (II) may be isolated by filtration and vacuum drying. Alternatively, the compound may be isolated by concentration of the reaction and chromatography of the residue or by aqueous workup and concentration and chromatography of the organic extracts.<br><br>
Scheme II<br><br><br>
In Scheme II, a compound of formula (III) may be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula (II) with water, optionally in the presence of an acid or a mixture of acids. This reaction may also optionally be performed in the presence of additional solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, methanol, acetic acid and toluene. Suitable acids include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. Suitable reaction conditions include treatment of a compound of Formula (II) with acetic acid, water and trifluoroacetic acid at about ambient temperature for around 1 hour or treatment of a compound of Formula (II) in a mixture of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid at around room temperature for about 22 hours. Also, the compound of Formula (III) can be prepared by hydrolysis with acetic acid at around 80 °C for about 8 hours. Also, the compound of Formula (III) can be prepared by hydrolysis with mixing with Dowex 50- 2X200 ion exchange resin in aqueous methanol at about ambient temperature for around 5 hours. Also, the compound of Formula (III) can be prepared by hydrolysis with <br><br>
trifluoroacetic acid in a biphasic mixture with the solvents toluene and water for around 1 hour at about room temperature. It is often advantageous to perform this reaction in the presence of at least one equivalent of 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran. Once the compound of formula (III) has formed, it can be isolated by pouring into water and extraction with organic solvents such as dichloromethane, diethylether, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate and toluene. The extract may be dried over a desiccant such as sodium sulfate and concentrated to provide the product as a crude mixture. It is often advantageous to use this compound directly in the next reaction rather than to purify it further. In some cases, pouring the reaction onto ice/water allows precipitation and isolation of the compound of formula (III) through filtration.<br><br>
Scheme III<br><br><br>
In Scheme III, a compound of Formula (IV) may be prepared by treatment of a solution of a compound of Formula (III) with a compound of Formula (4). Suitable solvents include dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene and may be performed at temperatures ranging from room temperature to around 80 °C. This reaction may be promoted by removal of water as it is formed by treatment with a dehydrating agent such as Na2SO4 or MgSO4 or 4A molecular sieves or azeotropic removal of water. This reaction may also be performed in the presence of a catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, acetic acid or other acidic compound. The compound of Formula (IV) can be isolated, if desired, by methods known in the art such as by precipitation with a solvent such as isopropyl acetate or by silica gel chromatography.<br><br>
Scheme IV <br><br><br>
In Scheme IV, a compound of formula (I), (Ia), and (Ib) may be formed by treatment of a compound of formula (IV) under suitable reducing conditions. Suitable reducing conditions include treatment with NaCNBU3 in the presence of acetic acid with an optional solvent such as dichloromethane at around room temperature for about 30 minutes to about 12 hours, treatment with NaBH4 in an alcoholic solvent, treatment with Na(OAc)3BH in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid in a suitable solvent such a toluene at room temperature for about 23 hours, and hydrogenation conditions in which a solution of compound of formula (IV) is treated with a suitable metal catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. Suitable solvents include methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran. Suitable metal catalysts include palladium on carbon and platinum oxide. Compound of Formula (IV) is dissolved in ethanol and methanol mixture and subjected to a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Pd/C at around room temperature for about 24 hours. The reaction is filtered and concentrated in vacuo to obtain the compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib). The compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib) can be isolated by means such as aqueous workup or precipitation of the product. Further purification may be performed by use of such techniques as SCX-2 ion exchange chromatography, silica gel chromatography, Supercritical Fluid Chromatography, reverse phase chromatography and crystallization. Purification may also be performed by treatment of mixtures containing a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib) with an acid to provide the salt of compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib) which may then be purified by crystallization to provide the purified salt of the compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib). Preferred salts include those formed by addition with hydrochloric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. In the synthesis of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib), either of the intermediates of Formula (III) or Formula (IV) may be used directly in subsequent reactions without purification of the crude intermediates. <br><br>
Single enantiomers of compounds of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib) are generally preferred over the corresponding racemates. These enantiomers may be prepared by resolution of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib) using techniques such as preparative chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase. The enantiomers may also be prepared by resolution which comprises formation of a salt of the racemic mixture with an optically active acid and purification of the desired diastereomeric salt. The desired diastereomeric salt may be purified by crystallization. Alternatively, any of the intermediates of formula (II), (III), or (IV) may be resolved to provide substantially a single enantiomer which may then be converted using the methods described above to provide a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), or (Ib) in its enantiomerically purified form such as compounds of Formula (Ic), (Id), (Ie) or (If). The intermediates of formula (II), (III), or (IV) may be prepared by resolution of compounds of the corresponding racemic compound using techniques such as preparative chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase.<br><br>
Scheme V<br><br><br>
An alternative and often preferred method for the preparation of purified enantiomers of compounds of formula (III) is outlined in Scheme V. A racemic compound of formula (III) is reacted with a compound of formula (5), in which Q2 is hydrogen, halogen, or a (Ci-C3)alkoxy group, to form a diastereomeric mixture of compounds of formula (XIVc), (XIVd), or (XIVe) and (Vb). Preferred compounds of formula (5) include R-alpha-methylbenzylamine, S-alpha-methylbenzylamine, R-4- <br><br>
chloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine, S-4-chloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine, R-4-methoxy- alpha-methylbenzylamine, and S-4-methoxy-alpha-methylbenzylamine. This condensation may be performed by combining a compound of Formula (III) and compound (5) an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene and optionally heating from room temperature to around 80 ° C to until the completion of the reaction. This reaction may be promoted by removal of water as it is formed by treatment with a dehydrating agent such as Na2SO4 or MgSO4 or 4A molecular sieves or azeotropic removal of water. This reaction may also be performed in the presence of a catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, acetic acid or other acidic compound. The diastereomers of formula (XIVc), (XIVd), or (XIVe) and (Vb) are then separated using techniques such as silica gel chromatography or crystallization from inert solvents such as isopropanol or mixtures of solvents. The desired diastereomer (designated (XIVc), (XIVd), or (XIVe) in Scheme V) is then hydrolyzed to form the purified enantiomer of formula (Ilia). Suitable hydrolysis conditions include treating a solution of the desired diastereomer in acetic acid with aqueous hydrochloric acid. In some instances, the crude (Ilia) may contain substantial amounts of the dimer of formula (VI).<br><br>
In Scheme V, the racemic compound of formula (III) may be crude product resulting from the process outlined in Scheme II. In addition, the purified enantiomer of formula (Ilia) may be used directly from the hydrolysis reaction, without further purification, in the process outlined in Scheme III.<br><br>
In Scheme V, the (R)-enantiomer of compound (5) was chosen to exemplify the process. One skilled in the art will recognize that the (S)-enantiomer of compound (5) may also be used in this process. The choice of whether to use the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer may be made depending on which will yield the desired diastereomer that is more readily isolated.<br><br>
Scheme VI <br><br><br><br>
In Scheme VI, the compound of formula (IVb) may also be formed by treatment of compound of formula (VI) with compound (4) under the same conditions as described for the reaction of compound (Ilia) with (4). In some cases, heating the reaction in a microwave reactor may be advantageous.<br><br>

A compound of structure (6) is coupled to a compound (1) with agents such as TBTU, EDCI or HOBt and an optional catalysts such as DMAP and an appropriate solvent such as dimethylformamide and triethylamine at around room temperature for about 18 hours. Aqueous acidic work-up, concentration and silica gel chromatography or trituration with solvents such as hexane gives the compound of structure (7). The ketone group of compound (7) is converted to the alcohol group of compound (8) with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in solvent mixtures such as water, methanol, ethanol, and DME at about room temperature to 0 C°. An alternative and often preferred method, compound (7) may undergo chiral reduction to form compound (8) in which one of the enantiomers is enriched. Methods for chiral reduction of ketones are known in the art <br><br>
(see, for instance, Singh, Synthesis 605 (1992); Wallbaum and Martens, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 3, 1475 (1992); Matteoli, Beghetto, and Scrivanti, J. Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 140, 131 (1999); Heiser, Broger, and Crameri, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 2, 51 (1991)). Suitable chiral reducing conditions include treatment under hydrogenation conditions using a chiral catalyst such as (R-Tol-Binap)RuCl2, and reduction mediated by a chiral oxazaborolidine catalyst (also known as CBS reduction; Corey, Bakshi, and Shibata, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 109, 5551 (1987)). The reaction is performed in a Parr Vessel under hydrogenation atmosphere in a sutiable solvent such as methanol at around 80 °C for about 24 hours.

Compound (IX) is then formed by treatment of compound (VIII) with a compound of <br><br>
Formula Q4SO2N3, in which Q4 is phenyl, optionally substituted with C1-3 alkyl, C1-3 alkoxy, halo, or NHCO Ci_3 alkyl. The reaction may be performed in a solvent such as acetonitrile and stirred for approximately 30 minutes.

CB1 and CB? in vitro functional assays<br><br>
Antibody-Capture SPA GTP-?-35S Binding<br><br>
Test exemplified compounds. Measure GTP-?35S binding in a 96 well format using a modified antibody capture technique previously described (DeLapp et al. 1999). <br><br>
Briefly incubate, CHO or Sf9 cell membranes expressing CBi or CB2, respectively (Applied Cell Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA); prepare as previously described (DeLapp et al, 1999), exemplified compounds and 500 pM GTP-?-35S (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 30 minutes (incubate all at room temperature) in GTP-binding assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). Perform antagonist dose responses in the presence of a saturating dose of full agonist (methanandamide). Add a mixture containing 0.27% Nonidet P40 detergent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), anti-Gi antibody (final dilution of 1 :300; Covance, Princeton, NJ), and 1.25 mg anti-rabbit antibody scintillation proximity assay beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and seal the plates and incubate for an additional 3 hours. Centrifuge the plates at 700 x g for 10 minutes using a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge and count for 1 minute per well using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA).<br><br>
To analyze data, first subtract background from all wells. Determine percent agonist efficacy by normalizing agonist/inverse agonist dose response data to a full agonist (methanandamide) response. Calculating antagonist percent inhibition data by normalizing to results generated with a saturating concentration of methanandamide. Analyze the data using a 4-parameter logistic reduced fit with Activity Base and XLFit3 (IDBS, Emeryville, CA). Determine Kb values using a modification of the Cheng-Prusoff relationship: Kb = IC50/(l + [agonist]/EC50) where IC50 is determined from a four parameter fit of displacement curves, [agonist] = EC50 of full agonist, and EC50 is determined from a four parameter fit of a full agonist concentration response curve (Cheng and Prusoff 1973). Calculate mean Kb values as a mean of at least three independent determinations ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Table 15 summarizes the antagonist/inverse agonist properties of Example 49 in CHO cells expressing human or rat CBi receptors or Sf9 cells expressing human CB2 receptors. The data indicate that Example 49 is a potent CBi antagonist/inverse agonist at both rat and human receptors with low antagonism of human CB2 receptors. Example 49 (Table 16) is an inverse agonist at the human CBi receptor as evidenced by agonist efficacy less than zero which indicates that the compound decreased basal constitutive activity of the CBi receptor in vitro. <br><br>
The exemplified compounds (Table 17) exhibit potent human and rat CBi antagonism/inverse agonism with only low affinity antagonism/inverse agonism of the human CB2 receptor.<br><br>
Exemplified compounds of this invention are potent CBi antagonist/inverse agonist at both rat and human receptors with low antagonism of human CB2 receptors. Exemplified compounds of this invention are inverse agonist at the human CBi receptor as evidenced by agonist efficacy less than zero which indicates that the compound decreased basal constitutive activity of the CBi receptor in vitro.<br><br>

Receive NIH male Swiss mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, weigh 20-25g) 7-10 days prior to testing. House 12 mice/cage. Test animals that weigh 25-30g. On the day of test, bring animals to the testing room at least lhr prior to dosing, when doing starts, 6-8 min. intervals between each dosing with mouse receiving either vehicle or exemplified compounds by p.o., and then put it into a clean cage afterwards (4 mice/cage). Depending on pretreatment time, start the test accordingly.<br><br>
Mice FST: Place NIH-Swiss mice in clear plastic cylinders (diameter: 10 cm; height: 25 cm) filled to 6 cm with 22-25 0C water for six min. Record the duration of immobility during the last 4 min. of the six- minute trial. A mouse is regarded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above the water. Copy the data -immobility (second) into JMP data sheet, and analyze by ANOVA<br><br>
-Dunnett's test. Record the minimum effective dose (MED) as the lowest dose of compound at which statistically significant decrease in immobility time is observed versus a vehicle control.<br><br>
