				<td>AN ELEVATOR<br>
The present invention relates to an elevator.<br>
One of the objectives in elevator development work is<br>
to achieve efficient and economical utilization of<br>
building space. In recent years, this development work<br>
has produced various elevator solutions without ma-<br>
chine room, among other things. Good examples of ele-<br>
vators without machine room are disclosed in specifi-<br>
cations EP 0 631 967 (A1) and EP 0 631 968. The eleva-<br>
tors described in these specifications are fairly ef-<br>
ficient in respect of space utilization as they have<br>
made it possible to eliminate the space required by<br>
the elevator machine room in the building without a<br>
need to enlarge the elevator shaft. In the elevators<br>
disclosed in these specifications, the machine is com-<br>
pact at least in one direction, but in other direc-<br>
tions it may have much larger dimensions than a con-<br>
ventional elevator machine.<br>
In these basically good elevator solutions, the space<br>
required by the hoisting machine limits the freedom of<br>
choice in elevator lay-out solutions. Space is needed<br>
for the arrangements required for the passage of the<br>
hoisting ropes. It is difficult to reduce the space<br>
required by the elevator car itself on its track and<br>
likewise the space required by the counterweight, at<br>
least at a reasonable cost and without impairing ele-<br>
vator performance and operational quality. In a trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator without machine room, mounting<br>
the hoisting machine in the elevator shaft is often<br>
difficult, especially in a solution with machine<br>
above, because the hoisting machine is a sizeable body<br>
of considerable weight. Especially in the case of lar-<br>
ger loads, speeds and/or hoisting heights, the size<br>
and weight of the machine are a problem regarding in-<br>
stallation, even so much so that the required machine<br>
size and weight have in practice limited the sphere of<br>
application of the concept of elevator without machine<br>
room or at least retarded the introduction of said<br>
concept in larger elevators. In modernization of ele-<br>
vators, the space available in the elevator shaft of-<br>
ten limits the area of application of the concept of<br>
elevator without machine room, in many cases, espe-<br>
cially when hydraulic elevators are to be modernized<br>
or replaced, it is not practical to apply the concept<br>
of roped elevator without machine room due to insuffi-<br>
cient space in the shaft, especially in a case where<br>
the hydraulic elevator solution to be modern-<br>
ized/replaced has no counterweight. A disadvantage<br>
with elevators provided with a counterweight is the<br>
cost of the counterweight and the space it requires in<br>
the shaft. Drum elevators, which are nowadays rarely<br>
used, have the drawbacks of heavy and complex hoisting<br>
machines with a high power/torque requirement. Prior-<br>
art elevator solutions without counterweight are ex-<br>
otic, and no adequate solutions are known. Before, it<br>
has not been technically or economically reasonable to<br>
make elevators without a counterweight. One solution<br>
of this type is disclosed in specification WOO9806655.<br>
A recent elevator solution without counterweight pre-<br>
sents a viable solution. In prior-art elevator solu-<br>
tions without counterweight, the tensioning of the<br>
hoisting rope is implemented using a weight or spring,<br>
and this is not an attractive approach to implementing<br>
the tensioning of the hoisting rope. Another problem<br>
with elevator solutions without counterweight, when<br>
long ropes are used e.g. due to a large hoisting<br>
height or a large rope length required by high suspen-<br>
sion ratios, is the compensation of the elongation of<br>
the ropes and the fact that, due, to rope elongation,<br>
the friction between the traction sheave and the<br>
hoisting ropes is insufficient for the operation of<br>
the elevator. In a hydraulic elevator, especially a<br>
hydraulic elevator with lifting force applied from be-<br>
low, the shaft efficiency, in other words the ratio of<br>
the cross-sectional shaft area occupied by the eleva-<br>
tor car to the total cross-sectional area of the ele-<br>
vator shaft, is fairly high. This has traditionally<br>
been a significant factor contributing towards the<br>
choice of a hydraulic elevator as the elevator solu-<br>
tion for a building. On the other hand, hydraulic ele-<br>
vators have many drawbacks associated with their lift-<br>
ing mechanism and oil consumption. Hydraulic elevators<br>
consume plenty of energy, possible oil leakages from<br>
the elevator equipment is an environmental risk, the<br>
required periodic oil changes constitute a large cost<br>
item, even an elevator installation in good repair<br>
produces unpleasant smell as small amounts of oil es-<br>
cape into the elevator shaft or machine room and from<br>
there further into other parts of the building and<br>
into the environment and so on. Because of the shaft<br>
efficiency of the hydraulic elevator, its moderniza-<br>
tion by replacement with another type of elevator that<br>
would obviate the drawbacks of a hydraulic elevator<br>
while necessarily involving the use of a smaller ele-<br>
vator car is not an attractive solution to the owner<br>
of the elevator. Also, the small machine spaces of hy-<br>
draulic elevators, which may be located at a large<br>
distance from the elevator shaft, make it difficult to<br>
change the elevator type.<br>
There are a very large number of traction sheave ele-<br>
vators installed and in use. Such traction sheave ele-<br>
vators were built in their time in accordance with the<br>
users" needs as conceived at the time and the intended<br>
uses of the buildings in question. Afterwards, both<br>
users" needs and the uses of the buildings have<br>
changed in many cases, and an old traction sheave ele-<br>
vator may have proved to be insufficient in respect of<br>
car size or otherwise. For example, older and rela-<br>
tively small elevators are not necessarily suited for<br>
the transportation of prams or wheelchairs. On the<br>
other hand, in older buildings which have been con-<br>
verted from residential use for office or other uses,<br>
a smaller elevator installed in its time is no longer<br>
sufficient in respect of capacity. As is known,<br>
enlarging such a traction sheave elevator is practi-<br>
cally impossible because the elevator car and the<br>
counterweight already take up the cross-sectional area<br>
of the elevator shaft and there is no reasonable way<br>
of enlarging the car.<br>
The object of the invention in general is to achieve<br>
at least one of the following objectives. On the one<br>
hand, it is an aim the invention to develop the eleva-<br>
tor without machine room further so as to allow more<br>
effective space utilization in the building and eleva-<br>
tor shaft than before. This means that the elevator<br>
must be so constructed that it can be installed in a<br>
fairly narrow elevator shaft if necessary. One objec-<br>
tive is to achieve an elevator in which the hoisting<br>
rope has a good grip/contact on the traction sheave.<br>
Yet another objective is to achieve an elevator solu-<br>
tion without counterweight without compromising the<br>
properties of the elevator- A further objective is to<br>
eliminate the adverse effects of rope elongations. It<br>
is an objective of the invention to create a method<br>
for replacing or modernizing a hydraulic elevator<br>
with/into a rope-driven elevator without reducing or<br>
at least without substantially reducing the size of<br>
the elevator car. It is an objective of the invention<br>
to enable a rope-driven elevator to be modernized into<br>
an elevator with a clearly larger car or to be re-<br>
placed with an elevator with a larger car than before.<br>
The object of the invention should be achieved without compromising the possibility<br>
of varying the basic elevator layout.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an elevator, in which elevator the<br>
elevator car is suspended by means of hoisting ropes consisting of a single rope<br>
or several parallel ropes, said elevator having a traction sheave which moves the<br>
elevator car by means of the hoisting ropes, characterized in that the elevator has<br>
rope portions of the hoisting ropes going upwards and downwards from the<br>
elevator car, and the rope portions going upwards from the elevator car are under<br>
a first rope tension (T1) which is greater than a second rope tension (T2), which is<br>
the rope tension of the rope portions going downwards from the elevator car, and<br>
that the elevator has been built in place of an earlier elevator mounted in an<br>
elevator shaft or equivalent or by making modifications in the earlier elevator, the<br>
arrangement being such that the elevator roping is provided with a compensating<br>
system for maintaining a substantially constant ratio (T1/T2) between the rope<br>
forces acting in upward and downward directions.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of forming an elevator in place of an<br>
earlier elevator mounted in an elevator shaft or equivalent or by making<br>
modifications in the earlier elevator, the method involving the steps of replacing<br>
the hoisting function of the earlier elevator by a hoisting function comprising a set<br>
of hoisting ropes, said set of hoisting ropes having one rope or a plurality of<br>
parallel ropes, and an elevator machine driving the hoisting ropes, connecting the<br>
elevator car of the elevator to be formed to the hoisting ropes such that the<br>
elevator has rope portions going downwards and upwards from the elevator car;<br>
and providing the elevator roping with a compensating system for maintaining a<br>
substantially constant ratio (T1/T2) between the rope forces acting in upward and<br>
downward directions.<br>
Preferably, the earlier elevator is a hydraulically lifting elevator or a traction sheave<br>
elevator. Preferably, the elevator car of the elevator has a larger floor area than<br>
the earlier elevator. Preferably, the elevator is an elevator without counterweight.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the elevator has a compensating mechanism<br>
comprising a lever, a set of tensioning sheaves or compensating sheaves. The<br>
compensating mechanism may comprise one and/or more diverting pulleys.<br>
Preferably, the continuous contact angle between the traction sheave and the<br>
hoisting ropes is at least 180°. Preferably, the hoisting ropes used are high-<br>
strength hoisting ropes and have diameters smaller than 8 mm, preferably<br>
between 3-5 mm. Preferably, the hoisting machine is particularly light in relation<br>
to the load. Preferably, the traction sheave is coated with polyurethane, rubber or<br>
some other frictional material suited to the purpose. The traction sheave, at least<br>
in the area of the rope grooves, is made of metal, preferably cast iron, and<br>
preferably has undercut rope grooves. The D/d ratio of the diverting pulleys below<br>
the elevator car is below 40.<br>
Preferably, the replacing hoisting function is installed in place of a hydraulic<br>
hoisting function. The replacing hoisting function may be installed in place of a<br>
traction sheave-operated hoisting function comprising a counterweight. The<br>
replacing hoisting function may be installed in place of a hoisting function<br>
implemented using a drum, a screw or another corresponding hoisting function.<br>
Preferably, the equipment comprised in the hoisting function of the earlier elevator<br>
is removed from the elevator shaft or equivalent. Preferably, a replacing elevator<br>
car of a size larger than the earlier elevator car is formed in the elevator shaft or<br>
equivalent.<br>
Inventive embodiments are also discussed in the description sec-<br>
tion of the present application. The inventive content<br>
of the application can also be defined differently<br>
than in the claims below. The inventive content may<br>
also consist of several separate inventions, espe-<br>
cially if the invention is considered in the light of<br>
expressions or implicit sub-tasks or from the point of<br>
view of advantages or categories of advantages<br>
achieved. Therefore, some of the attributes contained<br>
in the claims below may be superfluous from the point<br>
of view of separate inventive concepts. For example,<br>
the equipment comprising the main components of the<br>
elevator to be installed in place of the earlier ele-<br>
vator, or the equipment designed for modernization of<br>
the hoisting system of the earlier elevator, the<br>
equipment comprising the machinery, ropes and divert-<br>
ing pulleys needed for the hoisting function and ac-<br>
cessories for the installation of these, and possibly<br>
also the elevator car and guide rails, is an inventive<br>
whole together with an instruction to replace or alter<br>
the elevator at least in respect of the hoisting func-<br>
tion so as to make it consistent with the present ap-<br>
plication.<br>
By applying the invention, one or more of the follow-<br>
ing advantages, among others, can be achieved:<br>
— Due to a small traction sheave, an elevator and/or<br>
elevator machine of a fairly compact size are/is<br>
achieved<br>
— A good traction sheave grip, which is achieved in<br>
particular by using Double Wrap roping, and light-<br>
weight components allow the weight of the elevator<br>
car to be considerably reduced.<br>
— A compact machine size and thin, substantially<br>
round ropes permit the elevator machine to be rela-<br>
tively freely placed in the shaft. Thus, the eleva-<br>
tor solution of the invention can be implemented in<br>
a fairly wide variety of ways in the case of both<br>
elevators with machine above and elevators with ma-<br>
chine below.<br>
— The elevator machine can be advantageously placed<br>
between the car and a shaft wall.<br>
— All or at least part of the weight of the elevator<br>
car can be carried by the elevator guide rails.<br>
— Applying the invention allows effective utilization<br>
of the cross-sectional area of the shaft. Thus,<br>
e.g. a hydraulic elevator can be modernized into a<br>
rope-driven elevator or replaced in the same shaft<br>
with a rope-driven elevator without reducing the<br>
size of the elevator car, or an old traction sheave<br>
elevator can be replaced with or modernized into a<br>
larger elevator.<br>
— The light, thin ropes are easy to handle, allowing<br>
considerably faster installation.<br>
— E.g. in elevators for a nominal load below 1000 kg,<br>
the thin and strong steel wire ropes of the inven-<br>
tion have a diameter of the order of only 3-5 mm,<br>
although thinner and thicker ropes may also be<br>
used.<br>
— With rope diameters of about 6 mm or 8 mm, fairly<br>
large and fast elevators according to the invention<br>
can be achieved.<br>
— Either coated or uncoated ropes can be used.<br>
— The use of a small traction sheave makes it possi-<br>
ble to use a smaller elevator drive motor, which<br>
means a reduction in drive motor acquisi-<br>
tion/manufacturing costs.<br>
— The invention can be applied in gearless and geared<br>
elevator motor solutions.<br>
— Although the invention is primarily intended for<br>
use in elevators without machine room, it can also<br>
be applied in elevators with machine room.<br>
— In the invention, a better grip and a better con-<br>
tact between the hoisting ropes and the traction<br>
sheave are achieved by increasing the contact angle<br>
between them.<br>
— Due to the improved grip, the size and weight of<br>
the car can be reduced.<br>
— The space saving potential of the elevator of the<br>
invention is increased considerably as the space<br>
required by the counterweight is at least partially<br>
eliminated.<br>
— As a result of the lighter and smaller elevator<br>
system, energy savings and at the same time cost<br>
savings are achieved.<br>
— The placement of the machine in the shaft can be<br>
relatively freely chosen as the space required by<br>
the counterweight and counterweight guide rails and<br>
roping can be used for other purposes<br>
— By mounting at least the elevator hoisting machine,<br>
the traction sheave and a rope sheave functioning<br>
as a diverting pulley in a complete unit, which is<br>
fitted as a part of the elevator of the invention,<br>
considerable savings in installation time and costs<br>
will be achieved.<br>
— In the elevator solution of the invention, it is<br>
possible to dispose all ropes in the shaft on one<br>
side of the elevator car; for example, in the case<br>
of rucksack type solutions, the ropes can be ar-<br>
ranged to run behind the elevator car in the space<br>
between the elevator car and the back wall of the<br>
elevator shaft.<br>
— The invention makes it easy to implement scenic-<br>
type elevator solutions as well.<br>
— Since the elevator solution of the invention does<br>
not necessarily comprise a counterweight, it is<br>
possible to implement elevator solutions in which<br>
the elevator car has doors in several walls, in an<br>
extreme case even in all the walls of the elevator<br>
car. In this case, the car guide rails of the ele-<br>
vator are disposed at the corners of the elevator<br>
car.<br>
— The elevator solution of the invention can be im-<br>
plemented with several different machine solutions.<br>
— The suspension of the car can be implemented using<br>
almost any suitable suspension ratio.<br>
— Compensation of rope elongations by means of a com-<br>
pensating system according to the invention is a<br>
cheap and simple structure to implement.<br>
— Compensation of rope elongations by means of a lever<br>
is a cheap and light structure.<br>
— Using the rope elongation compensation solutions of<br>
the invention, it is possible to achieve a constant<br>
ratio between the forces T1/T2 acting on the trac-<br>
tion sheave.<br>
— The ratio between the forces T1/T2 acting on the<br>
traction sheave is independent of the load.<br>
— By using the rope elongation compensating system of<br>
the invention, unnecessary stress on the machine and<br>
ropes can be avoided.<br>
— By using the rope elongation compensating solutions<br>
of the invention, the relation between the forces<br>
T1/T2 can be optimized to achieve a desired value.<br>
— The solutions of the invention for compensating rope<br>
elongation are safe solutions which make it possible<br>
to guarantee the required friction / contact between<br>
the traction sheave and the hoisting rope in all<br>
situations.<br>
— In addition, the rope elongation compensating solu-<br>
tions of the invention make it unnecessary to stress<br>
the hoisting ropes in order to ensure friction be-<br>
tween the traction sheave and the hoisting rope by<br>
loads larger than necessary, and consequently the<br>
useful life of the hoisting ropes is increased and<br>
their damage susceptibility is reduced.<br>
— When rope elongation is compensated using the ar-<br>
rangement of the invention for compensating rope<br>
elongation with compensating sheaves of different<br>
diameters, it will be possible using this solution<br>
to compensate even very large rope elongations, de-<br>
pending on the diameters of the pulleys used.<br>
— By using a rope elongation compensating solution ac-<br>
cording to the invention in which the compensating<br>
apparatus used is a differential gear, it is possi-<br>
ble to compensate even large rope elongations, espe-<br>
cially in the case of high hoisting heights.<br>
The primary area of application of the invention is<br>
elevators designed for the transportation of people<br>
and/or freight. A typical area of application of the<br>
invention is in elevators whose speed range is about<br>
1.0 m/s or below but may also be higher. For example,<br>
an elevator having a traveling speed of 0.6 m/s is<br>
easy to implement according to the invention.<br>
In both passenger and freight elevators, many of the<br>
advantages achieved through the invention are pro-<br>
nouncedly brought out even in elevators for only 2-4<br>
people, and distinctly already in elevators for 6-8<br>
people (500 - 63 0 kg).<br>
According to the invention, when an elevator, e.g. a<br>
hydraulic elevator or traction sheave elevator, is to.<br>
be modernized or replaced, the existing elevator is<br>
removed partly or completely and a new elevator is<br>
formed, wherein the elevator car is suspended on a set<br>
of continuous hoisting ropes comprising rope portions<br>
going upwards from the elevator car and downwards from<br>
the elevator car. The new elevator to be set up is a<br>
traction sheave elevator, which is preferably imple-<br>
mented completely without counterweight. The old<br>
hoisting function is always removed from service,<br>
preferably also removed physically, which means that,<br>
for example in the case of a hydraulic elevator, the<br>
hydraulic cylinder and hydraulic machine are removed<br>
from the elevator or that, in the case of a traction<br>
sheave elevator, the old hoisting ropes, hoisting ma-<br>
chine and counterweight are removed. The same elevator<br>
car or an enlarged or new elevator car is suspended on<br>
a new set of hoisting ropes, which can be installed<br>
while the old hoisting function is being removed or as<br>
a separate installation operation. A hydraulic eleva-<br>
tor lifted from below or a corresponding hydraulic<br>
elevator can be easily converted into a roped elevator<br>
without having to reduce the size of the elevator car.<br>
When a so-called roped hydraulic elevator is to be re-<br>
placed or modernized, the invention makes it possible<br>
to use a somewhat larger elevator car because, instead<br>
of a hydraulic cylinder placed at the side of the ele-<br>
vator car, only a space for the hoisting ropes is<br>
needed. When a traction sheave elevator is to be mod-<br>
ernized or replaced, the invention already allows a<br>
clearly larger elevator car to be used, because the<br>
share of the shaft width required for the counter-<br>
weight and counterweight guide rails, either laterally<br>
or towards the back wall, becomes available for accom-<br>
modating a larger elevator car. Thus, for example, an<br>
elevator for 6 persons can be replaced with an eleva-<br>
tor for 8 persons, or an elevator for 8 persons can be<br>
replaced with an elevator for 10 persons. The inven-<br>
tion is also applicable for use in connection with<br>
larger elevators, although the most suitable range of<br>
application is elevators conventionally used in resi-<br>
dential and office buildings, i.e. elevators designed<br>
for a nominal load of about 1000 kg or less. The ele-<br>
vator modernisation or "full replacement" according to<br>
the invention is accomplished by replacing or modern-<br>
izing an elevator installed in an elevator shaft or<br>
equivalent, e.g. in a partially open space located at<br>
the side of a building yet delimiting the elevator in<br>
respect of placement. In general, modernization pri-<br>
marily means modernizing the hoisting function and<br>
secondarily increasing the car size. The motive for<br>
modernization may consist of one or both of the above-<br>
mentioned reasons or some other reason. When an eleva-<br>
tor is to be replaced, generally the car and the<br>
hoisting function are replaced. Heavy modernization of<br>
an elevator system or nearly complete replacement of<br>
the old elevator system are in many cases mutually al-<br>
ternative due to economic factors.<br>
In the elevator of the invention, normal elevator<br>
hoisting ropes, such as generally used steel wire<br>
ropes, are applicable. In the elevator, it is possible<br>
to use ropes made of artificial materials and ropes in<br>
which the load-bearing part is made of artificial fi-<br>
ber, such as e.g. so-called "aramid ropes", which have<br>
recently been proposed for use in elevators. Applica-<br>
ble solutions also include steel-reinforced flat<br>
ropes, especially because they allow a small deflec-<br>
tion radius. Particularly well applicable in the ele-<br>
vator of the invention are elevator hoisting ropes<br>
twisted e.g. from round and strong wires. From round<br>
wires, the rope can be twisted in many ways using<br>
wires of different or equal thickness. In ropes well<br>
applicable in the invention, the wire thickness is be-<br>
low 0.4 mm on an average. Well applicable ropes made<br>
from strong wires are those in which the average wire<br>
thickness is below 0.3 mm or even below 0.2 mm. For<br>
instance, thin-wired and strong 4 mm ropes can be<br>
twisted relatively economically from wires such that<br>
the mean wire thickness in the finished rope is in the<br>
range of 0.15 ... 0.25 mm, while the thinnest wires may<br>
have a thickness as small as only about 0.1 mm. Thin<br>
rope wires can easily be made very strong. In the in-<br>
vention, rope wires having a strength greater than<br>
about 2000 N/mm2 can be used. A suitable range of rope<br>
wire strength is 2300-2700 N/mm2. In principle, it is<br>
possible to use rope wires having a strength of up to<br>
about 3000 N/mm2 or even more.<br>
The elevator of the invention, in which the elevator<br>
car is suspended by means of hoisting ropes consisting<br>
of a single rope or a number of parallel ropes, said<br>
elevator having a traction sheave which moves the ele-<br>
vator car by means of the hoisting ropes, has rope<br>
portions of the hoisting ropes going upwards and down-<br>
wards from the elevator car, and the rope portions go-<br>
ing upwards from the elevator car are under a first<br>
rope tension (T1) which is greater than a second rope<br>
tension (T2) , which is the rope tension of the rope<br>
portions going downwards from the elevator car. In ad-<br>
dition, the elevator comprises a compensating system<br>
for keeping the ratio (T1/T2) between the first rope<br>
tension and the second rope tension substantially con-<br>
stant .<br>
In the method of the invention for forming an eleva-<br>
tor, the elevator car is connected to the elevator<br>
roping used to hoist the elevator car, said roping<br>
consisting of a single rope or a plurality of parallel<br>
ropes and comprising rope portions going upwards and<br>
downwards from the elevator car, and that the elevator<br>
roping is provided with a compensating system for<br>
keeping the ratio (T1/T2) between the rope forces act-<br>
ing in upward and downward directions substantially<br>
constant.<br>
By increasing the contact angle by means of a rope<br>
sheave functioning as a diverting pulley, the grip be-<br>
tween the traction sheave and the hoisting ropes can<br>
be increased. In this way, the car can be made lighter<br>
and its size can be reduced, thus increasing the space<br>
saving potential of the elevator. A contact angle of<br>
over 180° between the traction sheave and the hoisting<br>
rope is achieved by using one or more diverting pul-<br>
leys . The need to compensate the rope elongation<br>
arises from the friction requirements, to ensure that<br>
a grip sufficient for operation and safety of the ele-<br>
vator exists between the hoisting rope and the trac-<br>
tion sheave. On the other hand, it is essential in re-<br>
spect of elevator operation and safety that the rope<br>
portion below the elevator car in an elevator solution<br>
without counterweight should be kept sufficiently<br>
tight. This can not necessarily be achieved using a<br>
spring or a simple lever.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in<br>

tion according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 4 placed in an elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a traction<br>
sheave elevator without counterweight and with machine<br>
above. The passage of the hoisting ropes 3 of the ele-<br>
vator is as follows: One end of the ropes is immovably<br>
fixed to a fixing point 16 on a lever 15 fastened to<br>
the elevator car 1, said fixing point being located at<br>
a distance a from the pivot 17 connecting the lever to<br>
the elevator car 1. In Fig. 1, the lever 15 is thus<br>
pivoted on the elevator car 1 at fixing point 17. From<br>
fixing point 16, the hoisting ropes 3 run upwards to a<br>
diverting pulley 14 placed in the upper part of the<br>
elevator shaft above the elevator car 1, from which<br>
diverting pulley the ropes 3 go further downwards to a<br>
diverting pulley 13 on the elevator car, and from this<br>
diverting pulley 13 the ropes go upwards again to a<br>
diverting pulley 12 fitted in the upper part of the<br>
shaft above the car. From diverting pulley 12, the<br>
ropes go further downwards to a diverting pulley 11<br>
mounted on the elevator car. Having passed around this<br>
pulley, the ropes go again upwards to a diverting pul-<br>
ley 10 fitted in the upper part of the shaft, and hav-<br>
ing passed around this pulley they go downwards again<br>
to a diverting pulley 9 fitted on the elevator car.<br>
After wrapping around this diverting pulley 9, the<br>
hoisting ropes 3 go further upwards to the traction<br>
sheave 5 of the drive machine 4 placed in the upper<br>
part of the elevator shaft, having previously passed<br>
via a diverting pulley 7 with only a "tangential con-<br>
tact" with the ropes. This means that the ropes 3 go-<br>
ing from the traction sheave 5 to the elevator car 1<br>
pass via the rope grooves of diverting pulley 7 while<br>
the deflection of the rope 3 caused by the diverting<br>
pulley 7 is very small. It could be said that the<br>
ropes 3 coming from the traction sheave 5 only touch<br>
the diverting pulley 7 "tangentially". Such "tangen-<br>
tial contact" serves as a solution damping the vibra-<br>
tions of the outgoing ropes and it can be applied in<br>
other roping solutions as well. The ropes pass around<br>
the traction sheave 5 of the hoisting machine 4 along<br>
the rope grooves of the traction sheave 5 . From the<br>
traction sheave 5, the ropes 3 go further downwards to<br>
diverting pulley 7, passing around it along the rope<br>
grooves of the diverting pulley 7 and returning back<br>
up to the traction sheave 5, over which they pass<br>
along the rope grooves of the traction sheave. From<br>
the traction sheave 5, the hoisting ropes 3 go further<br>
downwards in "tangential contact" with diverting pul-<br>
ley 7 past the elevator car 1 moving along guide rails<br>
2, to a diverting pulley 8 placed in the lower part of<br>
the elevator shaft, passing around it along the rope<br>
grooves on it. From the diverting pulley 8 in the<br>
lower part of the elevator shaft, the ropes go upwards<br>
to a diverting pulley 18 on the elevator car, from<br>
where the ropes 3 go further to a diverting pulley 19<br>
in the lower part of the elevator shaft and further<br>
back up to a diverting pulley 20 on the elevator car,<br>
from where the ropes 3 go further downwards to a di-<br>
verting pulley 21 in the lower part of the shaft, from<br>
where they go further to a diverting pulley 22 on the<br>
elevator car, from where the ropes 3 go further to a<br>
diverting pulley 23 in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft. From diverting pulley 23, the ropes 3 go fur-<br>
ther to the lever 15 pivotally fixed to the elevator<br>
car 1 at point 17, one end of the ropes 3 being im-<br>
movably fastened to said lever 15 at point 24 at dis-<br>
tance b from the pivot 17. In the case illustrated in<br>
Fig. 1, the hoisting machine and the diverting pulleys<br>
are preferably all placed on one and the same side of<br>
the elevator car. This solution is particularly advan-<br>
tageous in the case of a rucksack-type elevator, in<br>
which case the above-mentioned components are disposed<br>
behind the elevator car, in the space between the ele-<br>
vator car and the back wall of the shaft. The hoisting<br>
machine and the diverting pulleys may also be laid out<br>
in other appropriate ways in the elevator shaft. The<br>
roping arrangement between the traction sheave 5 and<br>
the diverting pulley 7 is referred to as Double Wrap<br>
roping, wherein the hoisting ropes are wrapped around<br>
the traction sheave two and/or more times. In this<br>
way, the contact angle can be increased in two and/or<br>
more stages. For example, in the embodiment presented<br>
in Fig. 1, a contact angle of 180° + 180°, i.e. 360 °<br>
between the traction sheave 5 and the hoisting ropes 3<br>
is achieved. The Double Wrap roping presented in the<br>
figure can also be arranged in another way, e.g. by<br>
placing diverting pulley 7 on the side of the traction<br>
sheave 5, in which case, as the hoisting ropes pass<br>
twice around the traction sheave, a contact angle of<br>
180° + 90°, i.e. 270° is achieved, or by placing the<br>
traction sheave in some other appropriate location. A<br>
preferable solution is to dispose the traction sheave<br>
5 and the diverting pulley 7 in such a way that the<br>
diverting pulley 7 will also function as a guide of<br>
the hoisting ropes 3 and as a damping pulley. Another<br>
advantageous solution is to build a complete unit com-<br>
prising both an elevator drive machine with a traction<br>
sheave and one or more diverting pulleys with bearings<br>
in a correct operating angle relative to the traction<br>
sheave. The operating angle is determined by the rop-<br>
ing used between the traction sheave an the diverting<br>
pulley/diverting pulleys, which defines the way in<br>
which the mutual positions and angle between the trac-<br>
tion sheave and diverting pulley/diverting pulleys<br>
relative to each other are fitted in the unit. This<br>
unit can be mounted in place as a unitary aggregate in<br>
the same way as a drive machine. In a preferred case,<br>
the drive machine 4 may be fixed e.g. to a car guide<br>
rail, and the diverting pulleys 7,10,12,14 in the up-<br>
per part of the shaft are mounted on the beams in the<br>
upper part of the shaft, which are fastened to the car<br>
guide rails 2. The diverting pulleys 9,11,13,18,20,22<br>
on the elevator car are preferably mounted on beams<br>
disposed in the upper and lower parts of the car, but<br>
they may also be secured to the car in other ways,<br>
e.g. by mounting all the diverting pulleys on the same<br>
beam. The diverting pulleys 8,19,21,23 in the lower<br>
part of the shaft are preferably mounted on the shaft<br>
floor. In Fig. 1, the traction sheave engages the rope<br>
portion between diverting pulleys 8 and 9, which is a<br>
preferable solution according to the invention. In a<br>
preferable solution according to the invention, the<br>
elevator car 1 is connected to the hoisting ropes 3 by<br>
means of at least one diverting pulley from the rim of<br>
which the hoisting ropes go upwards from both sides of<br>
the diverting pulley, and at least one diverting pul-<br>
ley from the rim of which the hoisting ropes go down-<br>
wards from both sides of the diverting pulley, and in<br>
which elevator the traction sheave 5 engages the por-<br>
tion of the hoisting rope 3 between these diverting<br>
pulleys. The roping between the traction sheave 5 and<br>
diverting pulley 7 can also be implemented in other<br>
ways instead of Double Wrap roping, such as e.g. by<br>
using Single Wrap roping, in which case diverting pul-<br>
ley 7 will not necessarily be needed at all, ESW rop-<br>
ing (Extended Single Wrap), XW roping (X wrap) or some<br>
other appropriate roping solution.<br>
The drive machine 4 placed in the elevator shaft is<br>
preferably of a flat construction, in other words, the<br>
machine has a small thickness dimension as compared to<br>
its width and/or height, or at least the machine is<br>
slim enough to be accommodated between the elevator<br>
car and a wall of the elevator shaft. The machine may<br>
also be placed differently, e.g. by disposing the slim<br>
machine partly or completely between an imaginary ex-<br>
tension of the elevator car and a shaft wall. In the<br>
elevator of the invention, it is possible to use a<br>
drive machine 4 of almost any type and design that<br>
fits into the space intended for it. For example, it<br>
is possible to use a geared or gearless machine. The<br>
machine may be of a compact and/or flat size. In the<br>
suspension solutions according to the invention, the<br>
rope speed is often high as compared to the speed of<br>
the elevator, so it is possible to use even unsophis-<br>
ticated machine types as the basic machine solution.<br>
The elevator shaft is advantageously provided with<br>
equipment required for the supply of power to the mo-<br>
tor driving the traction sheave 5 as well as equipment<br>
needed for elevator control, both of which can be<br>
placed in a common instrument panel 6 or mounted sepa-<br>
rately from each other or integrated partly or wholly<br>
with the drive machine 4. A preferable solution is a<br>
gearless machine comprising a permanent magnet motor.<br>
The drive machine may be fixed to a wall of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft, to the ceiling, to a guide rail or to some<br>
other structure, such as a beam or frame. In the case<br>
of an elevator with machine below, a further possibil-<br>
ity is to mount the machine on the bottom of the ele-<br>
vator shaft. Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred suspension<br>
solution in which the suspension ratio of the divert-<br>
ing pulleys above the elevator car and the diverting<br>
pulleys below the elevator car is the same 7:1 suspen-<br>
sion in both cases. To visualize this ratio in prac-<br>
tice, it means the ratio of the distance traveled by<br>
the hoisting rope to the distance traveled by the ele-<br>
vator car. The suspension arrangement above the eleva-<br>
tor car 1 is implemented by means of diverting pulleys<br>
14,13,12,11,10,9 and the suspension arrangement below<br>
the elevator car 1 is implemented by means of divert-<br>
ing pulleys 23,22,21,20,19,18,8. Other suspension so-<br>
lutions can also be used to implement the invention.<br>
The elevator of the invention can also be implemented<br>
as a solution comprising a machine room, or the ma-<br>
chine may be mounted to be movable together with the<br>
elevator. In the invention, the diverting pulleys con-<br>
nected to the elevator car may be preferably mounted<br>
on one and the same beam. This beam may be fitted on<br>
top of the car, on the side of the car or below the<br>
car, on the car frame or in some other appropriate<br>
place in the car structure. The diverting pulleys may<br>
also be fitted each one separately in appropriate<br>
places on the car and in the shaft. The diverting pul-<br>
leys placed above the elevator car in the elevator<br>
shaft, preferably in the upper part of the elevator<br>
shaft, and/or the diverting pulleys placed below the<br>
elevator car in the elevator shaft, preferably in the<br>
lower part of the elevator shaft, may also be fitted<br>
e.g. on a common anchorage, such as e.g. a beam.<br>
The function of the lever, 15 pivoted on, the elevator<br>
car at point 17 in Fig. 1 is to eliminate rope elonga-<br>
tions occurring in the hoisting rope 3. On the other<br>
hand, it is essential to the operation and safety of<br>
the elevator that a sufficient tension be maintained<br>
in the lower rope portion, which refers to that part<br>
of the hoisting rope which is below the elevator car.<br>
By means of the lever arrangement 15 according to the<br>
invention, the tensioning of the hoisting rope and the<br>
compensation of rope elongation can be achieved with-<br>
out using a prior-art spring or weight. By means of<br>
the lever arrangement 15 of the invention, it is also<br>
possible to implement the rope tensioning in such man-<br>
ner that the ratio T1/T2 between the rope forces T1 and<br>
T2 acting in different directions on the traction<br>
sheave 5 can be kept at a desired constant value,<br>
which may be e.g. 2. In connection with rope forces,<br>
we can also speak of rope tensions. This constant ra-<br>
tio can be varied by varying the distances a and b,<br>
because T1/T2 = b/a. When odd suspension ratios are<br>
used in the suspension of the elevator car, the lever<br>
15 is pivoted on the elevator car, and when even sus-<br>
pension ratios are used, the lever 15 is pivoted on<br>
the elevator shaft.<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with the drive machine 204 placed in the eleva-<br>
tor shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator with machine above and without<br>
counterweight, with an elevator car 2 01 moving along<br>
guide rails 2. The passage of the hoisting ropes 203<br>
in Fig. 2 is similar to that in Fig. 1, but in Fig. 2<br>
there is the difference that the lever 215 is immova-<br>
bly pivoted on a wall of the elevator shaft at point<br>
217. As the lever 215 is pivoted on the elevator<br>
shaft, preferably on a wall of the elevator shaft, in-<br>
stead of on the elevator car, this is a case of even<br>
suspension ratio both in the rope portion above the<br>
elevator car 1 and in the rope portion below it. The<br>
suspension above the elevator car comprises the hoist-<br>
ing machine 2 04 and diverting pulleys<br>
209, 210, 211,212,213,214. The suspension below the ele-<br>
vator car comprises diverting pulleys 208,218,219,<br>
229,221,222,223. One end of the hoisting rope is fas-<br>
tened to the lever 215 at point 216, which is at dis-<br>
tance a from the pivot 217, while its other end is<br>
fastened to the lever 215 at point 224, which is at<br>
distance b from the pivot 217. Both in the rope por-<br>
tion above the elevator car and in the rope portion<br>
below it, the suspension ratio of the elevator car is<br>
6:1.<br>
Due to a high suspention ratio, the rope length of the<br>
hoisting rope used in an elevator without counter-<br>
weight is large. For example, in an elevator without<br>
counterweight suspended with a suspension ratio of<br>
10:1, in which the same suspension ratio 10:1 is used<br>
both above and below the elevator car, and which ele-<br>
vator has a hoisting height of 25 meters, the rope<br>
length of the hoisting rope is about 270 meters. In<br>
this case, as a result of variations in rope stress<br>
and/or temperature, the length of the rope may change<br>
by as much as about 50 cm. Therefore, the requirements<br>
regarding compensation of rope elongation are also<br>
greater. For the operation and safety of the elevator,<br>
it is essential that the rope below the elevator car<br>
be kept under a sufficient tension. This can not al-<br>
ways be accomplished by using a spring or a simple<br>
lever.<br>
Fig. 3 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with the drive machine 3 04 placed in the eleva-<br>
tor shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator with machine above and without<br>
counterweight, with an elevator car 3 01 moving along<br>
guide rails 302. In Fig. 3, the lever solution used in<br>
Fig. 1 and 2 has been replaced with two sheave-like<br>
bodies, preferably sheaves 313 and 315, connected to<br>
each other at point 314, where the tensioning sheaves<br>
313,315 are fixedly secured to the elevator car 301.<br>
Of the sheave-like bodies, the sheave 315 engaging the<br>
hoisting rope portion below the elevator car has a di-<br>
ameter larger than the diameter of the sheave 313 en-<br>
gaging the hoisting rope portion above the elevator<br>
car. The diameter ratio between the diameters of the<br>
tensioning sheaves 313 and 315 determines the magni-<br>
tude of the tensioning force acting on the hoisting<br>
rope and therefore also the force of compensation of<br>
hoisting rope elongations. In this solution, the use<br>
of tensioning sheaves provides the advantage that the<br>
structure compensates even very large rope elonga-<br>
tions. By varying the diametric size of the tensioning<br>
sheaves, it is possible to influence the magnitude of<br>
the rope elongation to be compensated and the ratio<br>
between the rope forces T1 and T2 acting on the trac-<br>
tion sheave, which ratio can be rendered constant by<br>
this arrangement. Due to a large suspension ratio or a<br>
large hoisting height, the length of the rope used in<br>
the elevator is large. For the operation and safety of<br>
the elevator, it is essential that the hoisting rope<br>
portion below the elevator car be kept under a suffi-<br>
cient tension and that the amount of rope elongation<br>
to be compensated be large. Often this can not be im-<br>
plemented using a spring or a simple lever. With odd<br>
suspension ratios above and below the elevator car,<br>
the tensioning sheaves are immovably fitted in connec-<br>
tion with the elevator car, and with even suspension<br>
ratios the tensioning sheaves are immovably fitted to<br>
the elevator shaft or some other corresponding loca-<br>
tion which is not fixedly fitted to the elevator car.<br>
The solution can be implemented using tensioning<br>
sheaves as presented in Fig. 3 and 4, but the number<br>
of sheave-like bodies used may vary; for example, it<br>
is possible to use only one sheave with locations fit-<br>
ted for hoisting rope fixing points differing in di-<br>
ameter. It is also possible to use more than two ten-<br>
sioning sheaves e.g. to allow the diameter ratio be-<br>
tween the sheaves to be varied by only changing the<br>
diameter of the tensioning sheaves.<br>
In Fig. 3, the hoisting ropes run as follows. One end<br>
of the hoisting ropes is secured to tensioning sheave<br>
313, which sheave is immovably attached to sheave 315.<br>
This set of sheaves 313,315 is fitted to the elevator<br>
car at point 314. From sheave 313, the hoisting ropes<br>
3 03 go upwards and encounter a diverting pulley 312<br>
placed above the elevator car in the elevator car,<br>
preferably in the upper part of the elevator shaft,<br>
passing around it along rope grooves provided in the<br>
diverting pulley 312. These rope grooves may be coated<br>
or uncoated, e.g. with friction increasing material,<br>
such as polyurethane or some other appropriate mate-<br>
rial . From pulley 312, the ropes go further downwards<br>
to a diverting pulley 311 on the elevator car, and<br>
having passed around this pulley, the ropes go further<br>
upwards to a diverting pulley 310 fitted in the upper<br>
part of the shaft. Having passed around this diverting<br>
pulley 310, the rope goes again downwards to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 309 mounted on the elevator car, and having<br>
passed around this pulley the hoisting ropes go fur-<br>
ther upwards to a diverting pulley 307 preferably fit-<br>
ted near the hoisting machine 304. Between diverting<br>
pulley 307 and the traction sheave 304, the figure<br>
shows X wrap roping, in which roping the hoisting rope<br>
runs crosswise with the rope portion going upwards<br>
from diverting pulley 3 07 to the traction sheave 3 05<br>
and with the rope portion returning from the traction<br>
sheave 305 to diverting pulley 307. Pulleys<br>
313,312,311,310,309 together with the hoisting machine<br>
form the suspension arrangement above the elevator<br>
car, where the suspension ratio is the same as in the<br>
suspension arrangement below the elevator car, this<br>
suspension ratio being 5:1 in Fig. 3. From diverting<br>
pulley 307, the ropes run further to a diverting pul-<br>
ley 308 preferably fitted in place in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft e.g. on a car guide rail 302 or<br>
on the shaft floor or in some other appropriate place.<br>
Having passed around diverting pulley 308, the hoist-<br>
ing ropes 303 go further upwards to a diverting pulley<br>
316 fitted in place on the elevator car, pass around<br>
this pulley and then go further downwards to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 317 in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft, passing around it and returning to a diverting<br>
pulley 318 fitted in place on the elevator car. Having<br>
passed around diverting pulley 318, the hoisting ropes<br>
3 03 go further downwards to a diverting pulley 319<br>
fitted in place in the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft, passing around it and then going further up-<br>
wards to the tensioning sheave 315 fitted in place on<br>
the elevator car and immovably fitted to tensioning<br>
sheave 313.<br>
Fig. 4 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 404 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator shown in the figure is a traction<br>
sheave elevator without counterweight and with machine<br>
above, with an elevator car 401 moving along guide<br>
rails 402. The passage of the hoisting ropes 403 in<br>
Fig. 4 corresponds to that in Fig. 3 with the differ-<br>
ence that in Fig. 4 the tensioning sheaves 413,415 are<br>
fitted in place in the elevator shaft, preferably on<br>
the bottom of the elevator shaft. As the tensioning<br>
sheaves 413,415 are fitted in place in the elevator<br>
shaft and not in connection with the elevator car,<br>
this is a case of even suspension ratio both in the<br>
rope portion above the elevator car 1 and in the rope<br>
portion below it. In Fig. 4, the suspension ratio is<br>
4:1. The end of the hoisting ropes 403 below the ele-<br>
vator car 401 is fastened to the tensioning sheave 415<br>
with a larger diameter while the end of the hoisting<br>
ropes above the elevator car is fastened to the ten-<br>
sioning sheave 413 with a smaller diameter. The ten-<br>
sioning sheaves 413,415 are immovably fitted together<br>
and they are secured to the elevator shaft via a<br>
mounting piece 420. The suspension above the elevator<br>
car comprises the hoisting machine and diverting pul-<br>
leys 412,411,410,409,407. The suspension below the<br>
elevator car comprises diverting pulleys<br>
408,416,417,418,419. A set of tensioning sheaves (415,<br>
413) as illustrated in Fig. 4 used as a compensating<br>
system can also be advantageously mounted in place of<br>
either diverting pulley 419 at the bottom of the<br>
shaft, which pulley is preferably secured to the shaft<br>
floor, or diverting pulley 412 in the upper part of<br>
the shaft, which pulley is preferably secured to the<br>
ceiling of the shaft. In this case, the number of di-<br>
verting pulleys needed is one less than in the embodi-<br>
ment presented in Fig. 4. Thus, in advantageous cases,<br>
installing the elevator is also an easier and faster<br>
operation.<br>
Fig. 5 presents a diagrammatic illustration of the<br>
structure of an elevator according to the invention.<br>
The elevator is preferably an elevator without machine<br>
room, with a drive machine 5 04 placed in the elevator<br>
shaft. The elevator presented in the figure is a trac-<br>
tion sheave elevator without counterweight and with<br>
machine above, with an elevator car 5 01 moving along<br>
guide rails 502. In elevators with a large hoisting<br>
height, the elongation of the hoisting rope involves a<br>
need to compensate the rope elongation, which has to<br>
be done reliably within certain allowed limit values.<br>
Using a set of rope force compensating sheaves 524 ac-<br>
cording to the invention as presented in Fig. 5, a<br>
very long movement is achieved for the compensation of<br>
rope elongation. This permits the compensation of even<br>
large elongations, which often can not be achieved us-<br>
ing simple lever or spring solutions. The compensating<br>
sheave arrangement according to the invention pre-<br>
sented in Fig. 5 produces a constant ratio T1/T2 be-<br>
tween the rope forces T1 and T2 acting on the traction<br>
sheave. In the case illustrated in Fig. 5, the ratio<br>
T1/T2 equals 2/1.<br>
The passage of the hoisting ropes in Fig. 5 is as fol-<br>
lows. One end of the hoisting ropes 503 is fastened to<br>
diverting pulley 525, which diverting pulley has been<br>
fitted to hang on the rope portion coming downwards<br>
from diverting pulley 514. Diverting pulleys 514 and<br>
525 together form a rope force compensating system<br>
524, which in the case of Fig. 5 is a set of compen-<br>
sating sheaves. From diverting pulley 514, the hoist-<br>
ing ropes run further as described in connection with<br>
the previous figures between diverting pulleys<br>
512,510,507 fitted in place in the upper part of the<br>
elevator shaft and diverting pulleys 513,511,509 fit-<br>
ted in place on the elevator car, forming the suspen-<br>
sion arrangement above the elevator car. Between the<br>
hoisting machine 504 and the traction sheave 505, DW<br>
suspension is used, which was already described in de-<br>
tail in connection with Fig. 1. The roping between the<br>
diverting pulley 507 and the traction sheave can also<br>
be implemented using other appropriate roping solu-<br>
tions, such as e.g. SW, XW or ESW suspension. From the<br>
traction sheave, the hoisting ropes go further via di-<br>
verting pulley 507 to a diverting pulley 508 placed in<br>
the lower part of the elevator shaft. Having passed<br>
around diverting pulley 508, the hoisting ropes run<br>
between diverting pulleys 518,520,522 fitted in place<br>
in the lower part of the shaft and diverting pulleys<br>
519,521,523 fitted on the elevator car 501 in the man-<br>
ner described in connection with the previous figures.<br>
From diverting pulley 523, the hoisting ropes 503 go<br>
further to a diverting pulley 525 comprised in the<br>
rope force compensating sheave system 524 and fastened<br>
to one end of the hoisting rope. Having passed around<br>
diverting pulley 525 along its rope grooves, going<br>
further to the anchorage 526 of the other end of the<br>
rope in the elevator shaft or in some other appropri-<br>
ate place. The suspension ratio of the elevator car<br>
both above and below the elevator car is 6:1.<br>
In the embodiment presented in Fig. 5, the rope force<br>
compensating sheave system 524 compensates rope elon-<br>
gations by means of diverting pulley 525. This divert-<br>
ing pulley 525 moves through distance I, compensating<br>
elongations of the hoisting ropes 503. The compensat-<br>
ing distance I equals half the rope elongation of the<br>
hoisting ropes. In addition, this arrangement produces<br>
a constant tension across the traction sheave 505, the<br>
ratio T1/T2 between the rope forces being 2/1. The rope<br>
force compensating sheave system 524 can also be im-<br>
plemented in other ways besides that described in the<br>
example, e.g. by using more complex suspension ar-<br>
rangements with the rope force compensating sheaves,<br>
for example by using different suspension ratios be-<br>
tween the diverting pulleys in the compensating sheave<br>
system.<br>
Fig. 6 presents another implementation for the compen-<br>
sation of rope elongations using a compensating device.<br>
In Fig. 6, the passage of the ropes and the suspension<br>
ratio in the portions above and below the elevator car<br>
are identical to those in Fig. 5 as described above.<br>
The hoisting ropes 603 run between diverting pulleys<br>
609,611,613 mounted on the elevator car and diverting<br>
pulleys 610,612,614 in the upper part of the elevator<br>
shaft and the traction sheave 605 in the manner pre-<br>
sented in Fig. 5, and the ropes go further from the<br>
traction sheave 605 to the lower part of the elevator<br>
shaft to traction sheave 608, and having passed around<br>
it they run further between the diverting pulleys<br>
618,620,622 fitted on the elevator car and the divert-<br>
ing pulleys 619,621,623 fitted in the lower part of<br>
the elevator shaft as described in connection with Fig.<br>
5. The suspension ratio of the elevator car in the por-<br>
tions above and below the elevator car is 6:1. The ele-<br>
vator presented in Fig. 6 differs from the situation<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5 in respect of the compensating<br>
device 624. Fig. 6 presents a different roping arrange-<br>
ment according to the invention in the set of compen-<br>
sating sheaves 624 of the compensating device. In the<br>
set of compensating sheaves, one end 629 of the hoist-<br>
ing ropes 603 is immovably fitted to the elevator<br>
shaft, from which point the hoisting ropes go to the<br>
traction sheave 625, pass around it and go further to a<br>
diverting pulley 614 possibly fitted in place in the<br>
upper part of the elevator shaft, from where they run<br>
further in the manner described above to the traction<br>
sheave 605. Diverting pulley 625 is fixedly fitted in<br>
conjunction with another diverting pulley 626. These<br>
diverting pulleys 626,625 may be placed e.g. on the<br>
same shaft or they may be connected to each other by a<br>
bar or in some other appropriate manner. After passing<br>
around diverting pulley 623, the portion of the hoist-<br>
ing ropes 603 below the elevator car comes to the di-<br>
verting pulley 626 of the compensating device 624, this<br>
pulley being connected to diverting pulley 62 5 in the<br>
manner described above. Having passed around diverting<br>
pulley 626, the hoisting ropes 603 go further to a di-<br>
verting pulley 627 immovably fitted in place in the<br>
shaft and forming part of the compensating system 624.<br>
Having passed around the diverting pulley 627, the<br>
hoisting ropes 603 go further to an anchorage 628, to<br>
which the other end of the hoisting ropes is immovably<br>
secured. This anchorage 628 is on diverting pulley 625<br>
or fixedly connected to it. Using this roping arrange-<br>
ment in the compensating device 624, a constant ratio<br>
T1/T2 = 3/2 between the rope forces T1 and T2 is<br>
achieved. Using this roping arrangement, it is possible<br>
to implement SW roping on the traction sheave, in other<br>
words, the diverting pulley 507 shown in Fig. 5 is not<br>
necessarily needed at all. SW roping can be used on the<br>
traction sheave because the illustrated roping arrange-<br>
ment in the compensating device 624 minimizes the re-<br>
quired friction force on the traction sheave and per-<br>
mits small rope forces T1 and T2. However, the diverting<br>
pulley 507 presented in Fig. 5 can be used if desirable<br>
e.g. to provide a tangential contact with the hoisting-<br>
ropes as described in connection with the previous fig-<br>
ures. In the compensating device 624, the roping and<br>
the number of diverting pulleys may also vary in ways<br>
other than those described in this Fig. 6. Via the rop-<br>
ing suspension ratios in the compensating device 62 4,<br>
the T1/T2 ratio can be maintained at a desired constant<br>
magnitude. In Fig. 6, the compensation of rope elonga-<br>
tion is effected by means of diverting pulley 62 5 and<br>
the diverting pulley 62 6 fixedly fitted to it. The rope<br>
elongation compensating distance in the compensating<br>
device is the shorter the greater is the suspension ra-<br>
tio within it.<br>
Fig. 7 presents an embodiment of the invention in which,<br>
the suspension ratio of the roping is 1:1. In the ele-<br>
vator presented in Fig. 7, the compensation of rope<br>
elongation is implemented using a lever 715, which<br>
lever 715 functions as a rope force compensating device<br>
and is immovably pivoted on the elevator car 701. The<br>
rope forces are compensated and a constant ratio be-<br>
tween the rope forces T1 and T2 is achieved in the man-<br>
ner described in connection with Fig. 1, which yields<br>
the T1/T2 ratio as T1/T2 = b/a, which is independent of<br>
the magnitude of the load. The example of an embodiment<br>
of the elevator of the invention presented in Fig. 7<br>
can be implemented using e.g. commonly used conven-<br>
tional ropes having a diameter of 8 mm in an elevator<br>
for a nominal load of 4 persons, i.e. about 700 kg. In<br>
this elevator, the T1/T2 ratio is 1.5/1 and it uses a<br>
traction sheave having a diameter of 320 mm and conven-<br>
tional undercut grooves, and the mass of the elevator<br>
car is 700 kg. In this case, the force T1 lifting the<br>
elevator car upwards is 1.5 times the force required<br>
for lifting the weight of the elevator car and its<br>
load, and the force T2 acting downwards on the elevator<br>
car is the force required for lifting the weight of the<br>
elevator car and the load. This example is not ideal as<br>
it leads to an unnecessarily high rope tension relative<br>
to the load. By increasing the suspension ratio, it is<br>
possible to reduce this rope tension. The elevator of<br>
the invention may be provided with a geared machine and<br>
it can be constructed e.g. according to Fig. 7 with 1:1<br>
roping.<br>
Fig. 8 presents an elevator according to the invention<br>
in which a suspension ratio of 2:1 is used in the rop-<br>
ing portion 803 of the hoisting ropes above and below<br>
the elevator car 801 and DW roping between the traction<br>
sheave 805 and the diverting pulley 807. Compensation<br>
of rope elongations and constant rope forces are imple-<br>
merited using a rope elongation compensating device as<br>
presented in Fig. 5, which produces a rope force ratio<br>
of T1/T2 =2/1 while the compensating distance traveled<br>
by the diverting pulley 82 5 equals half the magnitude<br>
of the rope elongation.<br>
Fig. 9 presents an embodiment of the invention for com-<br>
pensating rope elongations and maintaining a constant<br>
rope fore ratio. In Fig. 9, the passage of the hoisting<br>
ropes is as described above in connection with Fig. 6,<br>
where the suspension ratio of the elevator car above<br>
and below the elevator car is 6:1. The passage of the<br>
hoisting ropes in Fig. 9 differs from the situation<br>
shown in Fig. 6 in that the ropes go downwards from di-<br>
verting pulley 914 to diverting pulley 924, and also in<br>
respect of the compensating system. In addition, one<br>
end of the hoisting ropes 903 is immovably fixed to the<br>
elevator shaft at point 923 before the ropes go to di-<br>
verting pulley 922. In this figure, the compensation of<br>
rope elongation is implemented by fastening diverting<br>
pulley 908 to the second end of the hoisting ropes 903<br>
at point 926. The elongation of the hoisting ropes is<br>
compensated by allowing diverting pulley 9 08 to move<br>
upwards or downwards through a distance equal to half<br>
the rope elongation, thus compensating the rope elonga-<br>
tion. In the system illustrated in Fig. 9, the compen-<br>
sation of rope elongations and a constant ratio of rope<br>
forces are implemented on the same principle as in the<br>
situation represented by Fig. 5, where the rope force<br>
ratio is T1/T2 and the compensating distance through<br>
which diverting pulley 908 moves equals half the magni-<br>
tude of the rope elongation. The compensating system<br>
presented in Fig. 9 can be implemented by means of any<br>
one of the diverting pulleys 908,919,921 in the lower<br>
part of the elevator shaft by fastening the second end<br>
of the hoisting ropes to the diverting pulley in gues-<br>
tion, as described above in connection with diverting<br>
pulley 9 08.<br>
When the elevator car is suspended with a small suspen-<br>
sion ratio, such as e.g. 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 or 1:4, divert-<br>
ing pulleys of a large diameter and hoisting ropes of a<br>
large thickness can be used. Below the elevator car it<br>
is possible to use smaller diverting pulleys if neces-<br>
sary, because the tension in the hoisting ropes is<br>
lower than in the portion above the elevator car, al-<br>
lowing smaller hoisting rope deflection radiuses to be<br>
used. In elevators with a small space below the eleva-<br>
tor car, it is advantageous to use diverting pulleys of<br>
small diameter in the rope portion below the elevator<br>
car. Since by using the rope force compensating system<br>
of the invention a constant tension in the hoisting<br>
rope portion below the elevator car can be achieved<br>
that is smaller by the ratio T1/T2 than the tension in<br>
the rope portion above the elevator car, this makes it<br>
possible to reduce the diameters of the diverting pul-<br>
leys in the rope portion below the elevator car without<br>
substantially impairing the service life of the hoist-<br>
ing ropes. For example, the ratio between the diameter<br>
D of the diverting pulley to the diameter d of the rope<br>
used may be D/d 
be only D/d = 25...3 0, while the ratio of the diameters<br>
of the hoisting rope portion and diverting pulleys<br>
above the elevator car is D/d = 40. The use of divert-<br>
ing pulleys of a smaller diameter allows the space be-<br>
low the elevator car to be reduced to a very small<br>
size, which may preferably be only 200 mm.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the elevator of the invention<br>
is an elevator without machine room and with machine<br>
above, in which the drive machine has a coated traction<br>
sheave, and which elevator has thin hoisting ropes of a<br>
substantially round cross-section. In the elevator, the<br>
contact angle between the hoisting ropes and the trac-<br>
tion sheave is greater than 18 0°. The elevator com-<br>
prises a unit with a mounting base on which are fitted<br>
a drive machine, a traction sheave and a diverting<br>
pulley ready fitted at a correct angle relative to the<br>
traction sheave. The unit is secured to the elevator<br>
guide rails. The elevator is implemented without coun-<br>
terweight with a suspension ratio of 9:1 so that both<br>
the roping suspension ratio above the elevator car and<br>
the roping suspension ratio below the elevator car is<br>
9:1, and that the roping of the elevator runs in the<br>
space between one of the walls of the elevator car and<br>
the wall of the elevator shaft. The solution for com-<br>
pensating the rope elongations of the elevator rope<br>
comprises a set of compensating sheaves, which creates<br>
a constant ratio T1/T2=2:1 between the forces T1 and T2.<br>
With the compensating sheave system used, the required<br>
compensating distance equals half the magnitude of the<br>
rope elongation.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the elevator of the<br>
invention is an elevator without counterweight in<br>
which the suspension ratio above and below the eleva-<br>
tor car is 10:1. In this embodiment, conventional ele-<br>
vator hoisting ropes are used, which preferably are<br>
ropes of a diameter of 8 mm, and a traction sheave<br>
which is made of cast iron at least in the area of the<br>
rope grooves. The traction sheave has undercut rope<br>
grooves and a diverting pulley is used to adjust the<br>
rope contact on the traction sheave to 180° or more.<br>
When conventional 8-mm ropes are used, the traction<br>
sheave diameter is preferably 340 mm. The diverting<br>
pulleys used are large rope sheaves which, when con-<br>
ventional 8-mm hoisting ropes are used, have a diame-<br>
ter of 320,330,340 mm or even more. The rope forces<br>
are kept constant so that the ratio T1/T2 between them<br>
is 3/2.<br>
Fig. 10a and 10b present another example situation, in<br>
which a roped elevator with counterweight as shown in<br>
Fig. 10a has been replaced with or modernized into a<br>
roped elevator without counterweight according to the<br>
invention as presented in Fig. 10b. The elevator pre-<br>
sented in Fig. 10a is a roped elevator with a counter-<br>
weight 1003, in which elevator the counterweight 1003<br>
and the counterweight guide rails 1004 are placed, as<br>
seen from the door opening 1006, behind the elevator<br>
car 1001 moving along guide rails 1002, in the eleva-<br>
tor shaft 1007 in the space between the elevator car<br>
1001 and the shaft wall 1005. Fig. 10b shows how the<br>
space required by the counterweight 1003 and its guide<br>
rails 1004 has been eliminated in the elevator shaft<br>
1007 and how the space thus freed up can be utilized<br>
for the elevator car 1001 if necessary. This provides<br>
the possibility to install a larger elevator car in<br>
the same shaft. In the case of a conventional passen-<br>
ger elevator as illustrated in Fig. 10b, it is possi-<br>
ble to obtain e.g. about 20 - 25 cm or even more of<br>
additional car depth when the elevator presented in<br>
Fig. 10a is replaced with or modernized into an eleva-<br>
tor without counterweight as shown in Fig. 10b.<br>
Fig. 10c and 10d present another example situation, in<br>
which a roped elevator with counterweight as shown in<br>
Fig. 10c has been replaced with or modernized into a<br>
roped elevator without counterweight according to the<br>
invention as presented in Fig. 10d. in the roped ele-<br>
vator with counterweight presented in Fig. 10a, the<br>
counterweight 1003 and its guide rails 1004 are placed<br>
on one side of the elevator car 1001 as seen from the<br>
door opening 1006. Fig. 10d shows how, according to<br>
the invention, the elevator in Fig. 10c has been re-<br>
placed with or modernized into a roped elevator with-<br>
out counterweight according to the invention. The<br>
space freed up in the elevator shaft 1007 by removing<br>
the counterweight 1003 and its guide rails 1004 can be<br>
utilized for the elevator car 1001, allowing the width<br>
of the elevator car 1001 to be increased. In the case<br>
of a conventional passenger elevator as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 10d, it is possible to obtain e.g. about 10 - 20<br>
cm or even more of additional car width when the ele-<br>
vator presented in Fig. 10c is replaced with or mod-<br>
ernized into an elevator without counterweight as<br>
shown in Fig lOd.<br>
Fig. 10e and 10f present a third example situation, in<br>
which a side-lifting hydraulic elevator as shown in<br>
Fig. 10e has been replaced with or modernized into an<br>
elevator without counterweight according to the inven-<br>
tion as presented in Fig. 10f. The hydraulic elevator<br>
in Fig. 10e comprises a hydraulic cylinder 1009 be-<br>
longing to the hydraulic lifting apparatus, a divert-<br>
ing pulley 1008 comprised in the hoisting rope system,<br>
and its possible guide rails are placed on one side on<br>
the elevator car 1001 as seen from the door opening<br>
1006. In the situation illustrated in Fig. lOe, the<br>
elevator car 1001 is hoisted along guide rails 1002<br>
from one side on the elevator car, but the hoisting<br>
function may also be implemented in other ways. The<br>
hydraulic lifting function to be replaced or modern-<br>
ized may also consist of a system with lifting force<br>
applied from below the elevator car. Fig. 10f illus-<br>
trates how, according to the invention, the elevator<br>
in Fig. 10e is replaced with or modernized into a<br>
roped elevator without counterweight according to the<br>
invention. The space freed up in the elevator shaft<br>
1007 by removing the hydraulic lifting apparatus and a<br>
possible counterweight can be utilized for the eleva-<br>
tor car 1001, allowing the width of the elevator car<br>
1001 to be increased. In the case of a conventional<br>
passenger elevator as illustrated in Fig. 10f, it is<br>
possible to obtain e.g. about 5-15 cm or even more<br>
of additional car width when the elevator presented in<br>
Fig. 10e is replaced with, or modernized into an eleva-<br>
tor without counterweight as shown in Fig 10f.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that<br>
different embodiments of the invention are not limited<br>
to the examples described above, but that they may be<br>
varied within the scope of the claims presented below.<br>
For instance, the number of times the hoisting ropes<br>
are passed between the upper part of the elevator<br>
shaft and the elevator car and between the elevator<br>
car and the diverting pulleys below it is not a very<br>
decisive question as regards the basic advantages of<br>
the invention, although it is possible to achieve some<br>
additional advantages by using multiple rope passages.<br>
In general, applications are so implemented that the<br>
ropes go to the elevator car from above as many times<br>
as from below, so that the suspension ratios of di-<br>
verting pulleys going upwards and diverting pulleys<br>
going downwards are the same. It is also obvious that<br>
the hoisting ropes need not necessarily be passed un-<br>
der the car. In accordance with the examples described<br>
above, the skilled person can vary the embodiment of<br>
the invention, while the traction sheaves and rope<br>
pulleys, instead of being coated metal pulleys, may<br>
also be uncoated metal pulleys or uncoated pulleys<br>
made of some other material suited to the purpose.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the traction sheaves and rope pulleys of metallic<br>
or some other appropriate material that are used in<br>
the invention, functioning as diverting pulleys and<br>
coated with a non-metallic material at least in the<br>
area of their grooves, may have a coating made of e.g.<br>
rubber, polyurethane or some other material suited to<br>
the purpose.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator car and the machine unit may be laid<br>
out in the cross-section of the elevator shaft in a<br>
manner differing from the lay-out described in the ex-<br>
amples. Such a different lay-out might be e.g. one in<br>
which the machine is located behind the car as seen<br>
from the shaft door and the ropes are passed under the<br>
car diagonally relative to the bottom of the car.<br>
Passing the ropes under the car in a diagonal or oth-<br>
erwise oblique direction relative to the form of the<br>
bottom provides an advantage when the suspension of<br>
the car on the ropes is to be made symmetrical rela-<br>
tive to the center of mass of the elevator in other<br>
types of suspension lay-out as well.<br>
It is further obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the equipment required for the supply of power to<br>
the motor and the equipment needed for elevator con-<br>
trol can be placed elsewhere than in connection with<br>
the machine unit, e.g. in a separate instrument panel,<br>
or equipment needed for control can be implemented as<br>
separate units which can be disposed in different<br>
places in the elevator shaft and/or in other parts of<br>
the building. It is likewise obvious to the skilled<br>
person that an elevator applying the invention may be<br>
equipped differently from the examples described<br>
above. It is further obvious to the skilled person that<br>
the elevator of the invention can be implemented using<br>
almost any type of flexible hoisting means as hoisting<br>
ropes, e.g. flexible rope of one or more strands, flat<br>
belt, cogged belt, trapezoidal belt or some other type<br>
of belt applicable to the purpose. It is likewise obvi-<br>
ous to the skilled person that the replacement or mod-<br>
ernization according to the invention of an elevator<br>
with a traction sheave elevator without counterweight<br>
according to the invention can also be implemented in<br>
the case of drum elevators, screw-driven elevators or<br>
elevators having a hoisting function based on almost<br>
any other technique.<br>
It is also obvious to the skilled person that, instead<br>
of using ropes with a filler, the invention may be im-<br>
plemented using ropes without filler, which are either<br>
lubricated or unlubricated. Zn addition, it is also<br>
obvious to the person skilled in the art that the<br>
ropes may be twisted in many different ways.<br>
It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art<br>
that the elevator of the invention can be implemented<br>
using different roping arrangements between the trac-<br>
tion sheave and the diverting pulley/diverting pulleys<br>
to increase the contact angle a than those described as<br>
examples. For example, it is possible to dispose the<br>
diverting pulley/diverting pulleys, the traction sheave<br>
and the hoisting ropes in other ways than in the roping<br>
arrangements described in the examples. It is also ob-<br>
vious to the skilled person that, in the elevator of<br>
the invention, the elevator may also be provided with a<br>
counterweight, in which case the counterweight has e.g.<br>
a weight below that of the car and is suspended by a<br>
separate roping arrangement.<br>
Due to the bearing resistance of the rope pulleys used<br>
as diverting pulleys and to the friction between the<br>
ropes and the rope sheaves and possible losses occur-<br>
ring in the compensating system, the ratio between the<br>
rope tensions may deviate somewhat from the nominal<br>
ratio of the compensating system. Even a deviation of<br>
5% will not involve any significant disadvantage be-<br>
cause in any case the elevator must have a certain in-<br>
built robustness.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. An elevator, in which elevator the elevator car is suspended by means of<br>
hoisting ropes consisting of a single rope or several parallel ropes, said elevator<br>
having a traction sheave which moves the elevator car by means of the hoisting<br>
ropes, characterized in that the elevator has rope portions of the hoisting ropes<br>
going upwards and downwards from the elevator car, and the rope portions going<br>
upwards from the elevator car are under a first rope tension (T1) which is greater<br>
than a second rope tension (T2), which is the rope tension of the rope portions<br>
going downwards from the elevator car, and that the elevator has been built in<br>
place of an earlier elevator mounted in an elevator shaft or equivalent or by<br>
making modifications in the earlier elevator, the arrangement being such that the<br>
elevator roping is provided with a compensating system for maintaining a<br>
substantially constant ratio (T1/T2) between the rope forces acting in upward and<br>
downward directions.<br>

hoisting ropes used are high-strength hoisting ropes.<br>
10. An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
hoisting ropes have diameters smaller than 8 mm, preferably between 3-5<br>
mm.<br>
11. An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
hoisting machine is particularly light in relation to the load.<br>
12. An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
traction sheave is coated with polyurethane, rubber or some other frictional<br>
material suited to the purpose.<br>
13. An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
traction sheave, at least in the area of the rope grooves, is made of metal,<br>
preferably cast iron, and preferably has undercut rope grooves.<br>
14. An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the D/d<br>
ratio of the diverting pulleys below the elevator car is below 40.<br>
15. A method of forming an elevator in place of an earlier elevator mounted in an<br>
elevator shaft or equivalent or by making modifications in the earlier elevator,<br>
said method involving the steps of:<br>
replacing the hoisting function of the earlier elevator by a hoisting function<br>
comprising a set of hoisting ropes, said set of hoisting ropes having one rope<br>
or a plurality of parallel ropes, and an elevator machine driving the hoisting<br>
ropes;<br>
connecting the elevator car of the elevator to be formed to the hoisting ropes<br>
such that the elevator has rope portions going downwards and upwards from<br>
the elevator car; and<br>
providing the elevator roping with a compensating system for maintaining a<br>
substantially constant ratio (T1/T2) between the rope forces acting in upward<br>
and downward directions.<br>
16. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the replacing hoisting function is<br>
installed in place of a hydraulic hoisting function.<br>
17. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the replacing hoisting function is<br>
installed in place of a traction sheave-operated hoisting function comprising a<br>
counterweight.<br>
18. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the replacing hoisting function is<br>
installed in place of a hoisting function implemented using a drum, a screw or<br>
another corresponding hoisting function.<br>
19. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the equipment comprised in the<br>
hoisting function of the earlier elevator is removed from the elevator shaft or<br>
equivalent.<br>
20. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein a replacing elevator car of a size<br>
larger than the earlier elevator car is formed in the elevator shaft or<br>
equivalent.<br>
An elevator built in place of an earlier elevator in an elevator shaft or<br>
equivalent is disclosed. Int he elevator, the elevator car is suspended by means of<br>
hoisting ropes (3) consisting of a single rope of several parallel ropes. The<br>
elevator has a traction sheave (5) which moves the elevator car by means of the<br>
hoisting ropes (3). The elevator has rope portions of the hoisting ropes going<br>
upwards and downwards from the elevator car, and the rope portions going<br>
upwards from the elevator car are under a first rope tension (T1) which is greater<br>
