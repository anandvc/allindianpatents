				<td>Process for the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds<br>
The present invention concerns a process for the<br>
hydrogenation of aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds. In<br>
particular, the invention concerns the hydrogenation of<br>
aromatic compounds such as (I)<br><br>
in the presence of a platinum-rhodium mixed catalyst.<br>
The hydrogenation of aromatic compounds is a standard<br>
reaction in organic chemistry and the resulting products<br>
are utilised commercially in many products.<br>
Ring-hydrogenated amino acids and derivatives thereof, as<br>
structural mimetics of the natural amino acids valine and<br>
isoleucine, are interesting building blocks in peptide<br>
chemistry, for example (J.Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 166; Coll.<br>
Czech. Chem. Commun. 1984, 49, 712; Coll. Czech. Chem.<br>
Commun. 1966, 31, 4563; Synthetic Communications, 1978, 8,<br>
345), and are used in a number of active ingredients,<br>
particularly renin inhibitors (e.g. WO 91/07430, EP 438311<br>
and EP 427939) and thrombin inhibitors (e.g. melagatran<br>
and ximelagatran, Drugs of the Future 2001, 26, 1155).<br>
There is therefore a corresponding level of interest in<br>
the economical production of such amino acids on an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
One possibility for the production of these compounds is<br>
the hydrogenation of corresponding aromatic precursors,<br>
many of which are available at a reasonable cost in<br>
enantiopure form (e.g. phenylalanine, phenylglycine and<br>
tyrosine). However, although the hydrogenation of simple,<br><br>
unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons to the corresponding<br>
saturated compounds under pressure in the presence of a<br>
noble metal catalyst is relatively straightforward, the<br>
hydrogenation of substituted aromatics is substantially<br>
more difficult. Secondary reactions can occur, such as<br>
e.g. a hydrogenolytic cleaving of substituents,<br>
particularly if palladium and platinum catalysts are used<br>
(Synthetic Communications, 1999, 29, 4327). Detailed<br>
investigations of the reactions are therefore necessary in<br>
many of these cases in order to optimise the reaction<br>
conditions (J. Org. Chem., 1958, 23, 276; Org. Syn., 1947,<br>
27, 21).<br>
An additional problem occurs if the substituent is<br>
carrying an asymmetrical C atom (particularly if it is in<br>
the benzyl position), since there is always a danger of<br>
partial racemisation (Synthetic Communications, 1978, 8,<br>
345; EP 0823416). The racemisation-free hydrogenation of<br>
e.g. phenylglycine to cyclohexylglycine is therefore an<br>
especially critical reaction.<br>
Several processes for the hydrogenation of phenylglycine,<br>
phenylalanine and other amino acids having aromatic<br>
substituents are described in the literature. Palladium,<br>
PtO2 (Adam's catalyst), platinum, ruthenium and rhodium<br>
were used therein as catalysts.<br>
However, as a consequence of the hydrogenolytic cleaving<br>
of the benzyl amino group that occurs as a secondary<br>
reaction, the hydrogenation of phenylglycine with Pd(OH)2<br>
(Synthetic Communications, 1978, 8, 345) generates only<br>
moderate yields. In addition, the cyclohexylglycine<br>
produced in this way was partially racemised.<br>
The use of PtO2 as a hydrogenating catalyst is described<br>
in a large number of publications. However, in most cases<br>
(US 4788322; J. Org. Chem., 1988, 53, 873; TH 1992, 48,<br>
307; THL 1996, 37, 1961; TH 1998, 54, 5545) only<br>
phenylalanine was hydrogenated, so no conclusion can be<br>
drawn about racemisation in the benzyl position. In two<br><br>
cases phenylglycine is also described as an educt (J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc, 1982, 104, 363; Chem. Berichte 1986, 119,<br>
2191). In the second case at least, a partial racemisation<br>
of the product is probable because of the specified angle<br>
of rotation. Other disadvantages of this method are the<br>
relatively long hydrogenation times (18 h) and the use of<br>
acetic acid as solvent, since this makes it more difficult<br>
to isolate the products.<br>
Platinum itself has also been used as a catalyst (J. Chem.<br>
Soc. C, 1968, 531; THL, 1991, 32, 3623), although only the<br>
hydrogenation of phenylalanine is described in these<br>
cases, so again no conclusion can be drawn about a<br>
possible racemisation. In addition, no details are given<br>
of yields or of the pressures, reaction temperature and<br>
reaction times required. On the basis of the details given<br>
in Synthetic Communications, 1999, 29, 4332, however, it<br>
must be assumed that these hydrogenation reactions do not<br>
proceed particularly advantageously.<br>
Patent EP 0823416 describes the use of a ruthenium<br>
catalyst for the hydrogenation of phenylglycine and<br>
phenylalanine, although at 65% the yields are moderate and<br>
unacceptable on an industrial scale.<br>
Finally, rhodium catalysts have also been used for the<br>
hydrogenation of phenylglycine (Synthetic Communications,<br>
1999, 29, 4327). In this case, however, the hydrogenation<br>
times (40 h) are very long, despite the use of more than<br>
10 wt.% catalyst. Furthermore, a major disadvantage of the<br>
pure rhodium catalyst described here (5% Rh/C) is the high<br>
price of rhodium, which is by far the most expensive of<br>
the noble metals mentioned here.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to<br>
provide details of another process for the hydrogenation<br>
of aromatic radicals of compounds having formula (I),<br>
which helps to prevent the aforementioned disadvantages of<br>
the prior art processes, particularly with regard to yield<br>
and risk of racemisation. This process should moreover<br><br>
also be able to be used on an industrial scale, i.e. it<br>
should be particularly advantageous from both an economic<br>
and an ecological perspective.<br>
These and other objects not specified in any more detail,<br>
but obviously deriving from the prior art, are achieved by<br>
a process having the characterising part of claim 1.<br>
Claim 2 is limited to the hydrogenation of certain<br>
aromatic compounds. The dependent claims 3 to 9 relate to<br>
preferred embodiments of the process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Quite surprisingly, but no less advantageously for that,<br>
the stated objects are achieved particularly simply<br>
according to the invention in that in a process for the<br>
hydrogenation of aliphatic-substituted aromatic or<br>
heteroaromatic compounds having an asymmetrical C atom,<br>
hydrogenation is performed in the presence of a platinum-<br>
rhodium mixed catalyst. When used according to the<br>
invention the proposed catalyst material leads to an<br>
almost completely racemisation-free hydrogenation product.<br>
With figures in some cases well above 94%, the yields are<br>
at the upper end of what is technically feasible. This<br>
shows that the formation of secondary products is<br>
inhibited correspondingly. A further advantage can be seen<br>
in the fact that the actual hydrogenation is completed in<br>
extremely short times of around 6 to 8 hours, which<br>
advantageously helps to raise the space-time yield, which<br>
is especially critical on an industrial scale.<br>
Aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds displaying the<br>
asymmetrical site in the benzyl position are preferred.<br><br>
In a second aspect the invention relates in particular to<br>
a process for the hydrogenation of the aromatic nucleus of<br>
compounds having the general formula (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
n can be 0,1,2<br>

P1 and P2 mutually independently stand for hydrogen or an<br>

bifunctional amino protective group,<br>
P3 represents hydrogen or a hydroxyl protective group or<br>

this hydrogenation being performed in the presence of a<br>
platinum-rhodium mixed catalyst. In the hydrogenation<br>
according to the invention the same advantages are found<br>
for the compounds claimed here as are described above.<br>
All natural and synthetic aromatic amino acids familiar to<br>
the person skilled in the art can be used according to the<br>
invention as educt, in particular α- and β-amino acids or<br><br>
the amino alcohols produced therefrom by reduction of the<br>
carboxyl function. Examples of natural amino acids can be<br>
found in Bayer-Walter Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie,<br>
1991, S. Hirzel Verlag, 22nd edition, p. 822ff. Preferred<br>
synthetic amino acids are cited in DE19903268.<br>
The amino acids can be used in the reaction in protected<br>
or unprotected form. Protective groups that are inert in<br>
respect of hydrogenation are preferred. A list of common<br>
amino acid protective groups is given in Green et al.<br>
(Greene, T.W., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, J.<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981). Examples of amino protective groups<br>
that are preferably used are: acetyl, MoC, EOC, formyl,<br>
tert-butyl oxycarbonyl. Examples of carboxyl protective<br>
groups and hydroxyl protective groups can likewise be<br>
found in Green et al. They are in particular esters such<br>
as e.g. benzyl, tert-butyl, ethyl and methyl ester. In<br>
terms of the hydroxyl protective group, ethers such as<br>
tert-butyl, methyl, methoxymethyl or acyl protective<br>
groups such as formyl or acetyl are suitable. The<br>
protected derivatives of the aromatic amino acids can be<br>
produced from the free amino acids by simple means using<br>
standard methods (Houben-Weyl Volume XV/1, 1974, Georg<br>
Thieme Verlag).<br>

wherein<br>
n is 0,1,<br>
R1 represents unsubstituted or substituted (C6-C18) aryl,<br>
(C7-C19) aralkyl, ((C1-C8) alkyl)1-3 (C6-C18) aryl radicals,<br>
R2 and R3 are H or together are =0,<br><br>
P1 and P2 mutually independently stand for hydrogen or an<br>
amino protective group or together stand for a<br>
bifunctional amino protective group,<br>
P3 represents hydrogen, a hydroxyl protective group or a<br>
carboxyl protective group and<br>
the C atom marked with * is an asymmetrical C atom,<br>
are preferably used in the reaction according to the<br>
invention. Examples thereof are L-phenylalanine, D-<br>
phenylalanine, L-phenylglycine, D-phenylglycine, L-<br>
tyrosine and D-tyrosine.<br>
In principle the person skilled in the art is free to<br>
choose the relative composition of the hydrogenating<br>
catalyst. He or she will be guided here by operational<br>
results and by the costs of materials. The optimum<br>
composition can then be determined by routine experiments.<br>
A process in which a ratio of platinum to rhodium of<br>
between 20:1 and 1:1 (w/w) is used in the catalyst is<br>
preferred. The ratio is most particularly preferably 10:1<br>
to 2:1, extremely preferably 5:1 to 3:1 (w/w).<br>
The amount of catalyst to be used can be chosen freely by<br>
the person skilled in the art. In this case too, the aim<br>
should be to optimise the reaction in terms of economic<br>
perspectives. The catalyst is preferably used in a<br>
quantity of 0.1 to 20 wt.%, relative to the compound to be<br>
hydrogenated. The quantity is most preferably 1 to 15<br>
wt.%, extremely preferably between 2 and 10 wt.%.<br>
The catalyst is advantageously used in the supported<br>
state. This means that the catalyst is adsorbed on a<br>
support. All compounds used by the person skilled in the<br>
art for this purpose can serve as support materials. A<br>
list of suitable materials can be found in Ullmann's<br>
Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Volume A5, VCH,<br>
1986, p. 347ff and in literature cited therein, and in<br>
Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Volume 4/2,<br>
p. 14 6 ff. Of these, activated carbon and aluminium oxide<br>
should be emphasised in particular.<br><br>
The platinum-rhodium catalysts that are used can contain<br>
between 1 and 10 wt. % noble metal (relative to the<br>
support), 4 to 6 wt.% being particularly preferred.<br>
The hydrogenation according to the invention can be<br>
performed in solvents used for this purpose by the person<br>
skilled in the art. These are in particular those that are<br>
inert in respect of hydrogenation and that dissolve both<br>
educts and products to an adequate extent. The<br>
hydrogenation is preferably performed in the presence of<br>
solvents selected from the group comprising water,<br>
alcohols, ethers or mixtures thereof. In the hydrogenation<br>
of unprotected or only amino-protected or only hydroxyl/<br>
carboxyl-protected aromatic amino acids, it can be<br>
advantageous to add at least 1 equivalent of a base (for<br>
unprotected or only N-protected amino acids) or 1<br>
equivalent of an acid (for unprotected or only hydroxyl/<br>
carboxyl-protected amino acids). Examples of bases that<br>
can be used here are NaOH, KOH, NH3 or amine bases such as<br>
triethylamine. Examples of acids are HC1, H2SO4, H3PO4,<br>
acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The hydrogen pressure that should be present during the<br>
reaction can be freely chosen by the person skilled in the<br>
art, depending on the speed of hydrogenation or possibly<br>
on the presence in the substrate to be hydrogenated of<br>
functional groups that are vulnerable to hydrogenation.<br>
The hydrogenation is preferably performed under hydrogen<br>
pressures of between 1 and 100 bar. Also preferred are<br>
pressures of between 5 and 15 bar, to ensure a<br>
correspondingly rapid hydrogenation.<br>
The temperatures during hydrogenation should be in the<br>
range that appears normal to the person skilled in the<br>
art. A temperature of 10°C to 150°C is preferred. The<br>
process is most particularly preferably performed at<br>
between 30°C and 80°C.<br>
If enantiomer-concentrated substrates are used in the<br>
present process, the hydrogenation is very<br><br>
stereoconservative. The degree of racemisation is<br>
generally 
most particularly preferably 
preferred embodiment, the racemisation during the reaction<br>
can be 
The process provided by the invention is preferably<br>
performed in such a way that the compound to be<br>
hydrogenated is dissolved in the appropriate solvent, the<br>
catalyst is added and in a suitable apparatus the gas<br>
chamber, which has first been rendered inert, is supplied<br>
with hydrogen under a certain pressure. The stirred<br>
suspension is generally fully hydrogenated in 6 to 8<br>
hours. The yields are close to 100% and the degree of<br>
racemisation, even with vulnerable substrates<br>
(phenylglycine) is less than 0.5%. It is precisely the<br>
combination of the possibility of being able to use<br>
expensive rhodium in tiny amounts, combined with the<br>
unexpectedly fast hydrogenation with optimum yields and<br>
enantiomer concentrations in the product, that puts these<br>
hydrogenation catalysts for the reaction according to the<br>
invention, which clearly stands out inventively from the<br>
prior art processes, in an exceptional position.<br>
Furthermore, the catalysts that are used can be recycled<br>
very effectively and reused in the reaction with no loss<br>
of activity. This also helps to save on operating costs,<br>
since on average less catalyst has to be used per quantity<br>
of substrate.<br>
(C1-C8) alkyl radicals should be understood to be methyl,<br>
ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl,<br>
tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl together with<br>
al their bond isomers. These can be substituted with one<br>
or more halogen, OH, NH2, NHR2 or N(R2)2 radicals.<br>
The (C1-C8) alkoxy radical corresponds to the (C1-C8) alkyl<br>
radical, with the proviso that it is bonded to the<br>
molecule by an oxygen atom.<br><br>
Radicals in which the alkyl chain is interrupted by at<br>
least one oxygen function, wherein two oxygen atoms cannot<br>
be connected to one another, are intended as (C2-C8)<br>
alkoxyalkyl. The number of carbon atoms indicates the<br>
total number of carbon atoms contained in the radical.<br>
(C3-C8) cycloalkyl is understood to be cyclopropyl,<br>

atoms, which is bonded to the molecule by a CO function.<br>
A (C6-C18) aryl radical is understood to be an aromatic<br>
radical having 6 to 18 C atoms. Examples include in<br>
particular compounds such as phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl,<br>
phenanthryl, biphenyl radicals or systems of the type<br>
described above which are annelated to the molecule<br>
concerned, such as e.g. indenyl systems, which can<br>
optionally be substituted with halogen, (C1-C8) alkoxy,<br>
(C1-C8) acyl, (C1-C8) acyloxy.<br>
A (C7-C19) aralkyl radical is a (C6-C18) aryl radical bonded<br>
to the molecule by a (C1-C8) alkyl radical.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention a (C3-C18) heteroaryl<br>
radical denotes a five-, six- or seven-membered aromatic<br>
ring system comprising 3 to 18 C atoms, which displays<br>
heteroatoms such as e.g. nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the<br><br>
ring. Such heteroaromatics are understood in particular to<br>
be radicals such as 1-, 2-, 3-furyl, such as 1-, 2-,<br>
3-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2-, 3-thienyl, 2-, 3-, 4-pyridyl, 2-, 3-,<br>
4-, 5-, 6-, 7-indolyl, 3-, 4-, 5-pyrazolyl, 2-, 4-,<br>
5-imidazolyl, acridinyl, quinolinyl, phenanthridinyl, 2-,<br>

A (C4-C19) heteroaralkyl is understood to be a<br>
heteroaromatic system corresponding to the (C7-C19) aralkyl<br>
radical.<br>
Suitable halogens are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and<br>
iodine.<br>
The meaning of the expression "aromatic" or<br>
"heteroaromatic" is as understood by the general person<br>
skilled in the art. Definitions can be found e.g. in<br>
Bayer-Walter Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie, 1991, S.<br>
Hirzel Verlag, 22nd edition, p. 469ff. and p. 656 or p.<br>
704ff.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the term enantiomer-<br>
concentrated or enantiomer excess is understood to be the<br>
content of an enantiomer mixed with its optical antipode<br>
in a range from &gt;50 % to 
calculated as follows:<br>
([enantiomerl]-[enantiomer2])/([enantiomerl]+[enantiomer2])=ee value<br>
The structures shown relate to all possible diastereomers<br>
and in terms of a diastereomer to the possible two<br>
enantiomers of the compound in question that it<br>
encompasses (R or S; D or L).<br><br>

addition of 10 g of the Pt/Rh catalyst, 4 % Pt + 1 % Rh on<br>
activated carbon (water content approx. 50 %,<br>
corresponding to approx. 5 wt.% catalyst relative to D-<br>
phenylglycine used), the reaction mixture is introduced<br>
into a 2 1 hydrogenation autoclave. After being rendered<br>
inert with nitrogen three times, it is rinsed with<br>
hydrogen twice, then a hydrogen overpressure of 8-10 bar<br>
is established and the reaction solution heated to 50-<br>
60°C. After approximately 6 to 8 hours, hydrogen uptake is<br>
completed (theoretical amount of H2 44.4 1). The<br>
hydrogenator is depressurised and once again rendered<br>
inert with nitrogen three times. The still hot reaction<br>
solution is extracted with a nutsch filter and the<br>
catalyst is washed with 200 ml deionised water. The<br>
filtrate is first adjusted at 40-60°C to a pH of 2-2.5<br>
with 50% sodium hydroxide solution, during which process<br>
the first crystals form. It is then stirred for a further<br>
15-30 minutes at this pH and then adjusted to a pH of 5-6<br>
with 50% sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction mixture<br>
is cooled in an ice bath to a temperature of 0-10°C, the<br>
product is extracted with a nutsch filter, washed with<br>
3 00 ml deionised water and dried in a drying oven in vacuo<br>
at 50-70°C.<br>
The catalyst can be reused several times with no loss of<br>
activity.<br>
Yield: 100-102 g (95.8 - 97.7 %)<br><br>
1H-NMR (500 MHz, D20/NaOD) : 5 (ppm) = 1-1.26 and 1.53-1.75<br>
(each m, together 11H, cyclohexyl H), 3.02 (d, 1 H, a-H)<br>
In all the cases analysed, the enantiopurity of the D-<br>
cyclohexylglycine produced in this way (determined by GC<br>
with chiral separation phases) was identical to the<br>
enantiopurity of the D-phenylglycine used.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Production of L-cyclohexylalanine<br>
20 g (121 mmol) L-phenylalanine are dissolved or suspended<br>
in 200 ml deionised water, 200 ml isopropanol and 12.2 ml<br>
(146 mmol) 37 % hydrochloric acid. After addition of 2 g<br>
of the Pt/Rh catalyst, 4 % Pt + 1 % Rh on activated carbon<br>
(water content approx. 50 %, corresponding to approx. 5<br>
wt.% catalyst relative to L-phenylalanine used), the<br>
reaction mixture is introduced into all hydrogenation<br>
autoclave. After being rendered inert with nitrogen three<br>
times, it is rinsed with hydrogen twice, then a hydrogen<br>
overpressure of 8-10 bar is established and the reaction<br>
solution heated to 50-60°C. After approximately 6 to 8<br>
hours, hydrogen uptake is completed (theoretical amount of<br>
H2 8.1 1). The hydrogenator is depressurised and once<br>
again rendered inert with nitrogen three times. The still<br>
hot reaction solution is extracted with a nutsch filter<br>
and the catalyst is washed with 50 ml deionised water. The<br>
filtrate is first concentrated to low volume in vacuo (the<br>
isopropanol largely removed), the residue then adjusted to<br>
a pH of 5-6 with 50% sodium hydroxide solution. It is<br>
cooled to a temperature of 0-10°C, the product is<br>
extracted with a nutsch filter, rinsed with 50 ml<br>
deionised water and dried in a drying oven in vacuo at 50-<br>
70°C.<br>
Yield: 19.5 g (94.2 %)<br><br>
H1-NMR (500 MHz, D2O/NaOD) : δ (ppm) = 0.85-1.0 and 1.1-1.52<br>
and 1.63-1.75 (each m, together 13H, cyclohexyl-H and<br>
cyclohexyl-CH2), 3.3 (t, 1 H, a-H)<br>

20 g (120 mmol) 3-(3'-pyridyl)-D-alanine are dissolved in<br>
200 ml deionised water, 200 ml isopropanol and 12.2 ml<br>
(146 mmol) 37 % hydrochloric acid. After addition of 2 g<br>
of the Pt/Rh catalyst, 4 % Pt + 1 % Rh on activated carbon<br>
(water content approx. 50 %, corresponding to approx. 5<br>
wt.% catalyst relative to 3-(3-pyridyl)-D-alanine used),<br>
the reaction mixture is introduced into a 2 1<br>
hydrogenation autoclave. After being rendered inert with<br>
nitrogen three times, it is rinsed with hydrogen twice,<br>
then a hydrogen overpressure of 8-10 bar is established<br>
and the reaction solution heated to 50-60°C. After<br>
approximately 4 hours, hydrogen uptake is completed<br>
(theoretical amount of H2 8.06 1). The hydrogenator is<br>
depressurised and once again rendered inert with nitrogen<br>
three times. The still hot reaction solution is extracted<br>
with a nutsch filter and the catalyst is washed with<br>
deionised water. The filtrate is evaporated in vacuo,<br>
12 ml 37 % HCl and 200 ml isopropanol are added, and it is<br>
evaporated again.<br>
Yield: 29 g (98.6 %), according to NMR a mixture of<br>
diastereoisomers (2R, l'S)- and (2R, 1'R)- 3-(3'-<br>
piperidine) alanine x 2 HCl<br>
Example 4:<br>
Production of L-cyclohexylglycinol x HCl<br><br>
27.4 g (200 mmol) L-phenylglycinol are dissolved in 220 ml<br>
1 n hydrochloric acid and 200 ml isopropanol. After<br>
addition of 3 g of the Pt/Rh catalyst, 4 % Pt + 1 % Rh on<br>
activated carbon (water content approx. 50 %,<br>
corresponding to approx. 5.5 wt.% catalyst relative to L-<br>
phenylglycinol used), the reaction mixture is introduced<br>
into a 2 1 hydrogenation autoclave. After being rendered<br>
inert with nitrogen three times, it is rinsed with<br>
hydrogen twice, then a hydrogen overpressure of 8-10 bar<br>
is established and the reaction solution heated to 50-<br>
60°C. After approximately 6 to 8 hours, hydrogen uptake is<br>
completed (theoretical amount of H2 13.4 1). The<br>
hydrogenator is depressurised and once again rendered<br>
inert with nitrogen three times. The still hot reaction<br>
solution is extracted with a nutsch filter and the<br>
catalyst is washed with deionised water. The filtrate is<br>
first largely concentrated to low volume in vacuo and the<br>
residue then taken up in 300 ml acetone and 100 ml MtBE<br>
added. It is cooled to a temperature of 0-10°C, the<br>
product extracted with a nutsch filter, rinsed with MtBE<br>
and dried in a drying oven in vacuo at 50°C.<br>
Yield: 34.5 g (96.1 %)<br>
1H-NMR (500 MHz, DMSO): δ (ppm) = 0.95-1.2 and 1.55-1.75<br>
