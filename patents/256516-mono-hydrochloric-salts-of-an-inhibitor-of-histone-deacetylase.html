Title: MONO-HYDROCHLORIC SALTS OF AN INHIBITOR OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE<br>
Applicant: JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA NV having its principal place of business at Turnhoutseweg 30, 2340 Beerse, Belgium<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to<br>
be performed:-<br><br>
MONO-HYDROCHLORIC SALTS OF AN INHIBITOR OF HISTONE<br>
DEACETYLASE<br>
5 Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to novel crystalline forms of mono-HCl salts and a mono-HCl salt hydrate of JNJ-26481585, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. The invention also relates to processes for production of these forms, to intermediates used in these 10 processes, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these forms, and to the use of these forms in medical treatment for instance as a medicine to inhibit proliferative conditions, such as cancer and leukemia.<br>
Background art<br>
15<br>
Many pharmaceutical solids can exist in different physical forms, e.g. in an amorphous form, in one or several crystal form(s) (e.g. anhydrous or solvated forms), in the form of mixture of different crystal forms, or as a mixture of an amorphous form and crystal form(s).<br>
20<br>
An amorphous form is a form in which a three-dimensional long-range order does not exist. In the amorphous form the position of the molecules relative to one another are essentially random, i.e. without regular arrangement of the molecules on a lattice structure. Amorphous and disordered materials often have improved properties, but 25 generating and stabilising this state can be a big challenge.<br>
A crystal or crystalline form is the form in which the position of the molecules relative to one another is organised according to a three-dimensional lattice structure. Crystalline forms typically include polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs. Polymorphs 30 are different crystalline forms of the same compound resulting from different<br>
arrangement of the molecules in the solid state. Different polymorphs have different crystal structures due to a different packing of the molecules in the lattice. This results in a different crystal symmetry and/or unit cell parameters. Polymorphs differ from each other in their physicochemical parameters but not in their chemical composition. 35 Polymorphism is usually difficult to control and poses challenges to the galenists. Pseudopolymorphs, also referred to as solvates, are a particular case of solid state crystalline forms in which either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of<br><br>
solvent molecules are present or incorporated into the lattice structure of the compound.<br>
A water solvate is also referred to as a hydrate.<br>
Solid state chemistry is of interest to the pharmaceutical industry and especially to<br>
5 those involved in the development of suitable dosage forms. For example, solid state<br>
transformations may seriously impact the stability of pharmaceutical drugs (shelf-life).<br>
A metastable pharmaceutical solid form can change into a crystalline structure (e.g.<br>
from amorphous to crystalline) or solvate/desolvate in response to changes in<br>
environmental conditions, processing, or over time.<br>
Different crystal forms or amorphous form of the same drug may have substantial<br>
differences in such pharmaceutically important properties as dissolution rates,<br>
thermodynamic solubility and bioavailability. The rate of dissolution of an active<br>
ingredient in a patient's stomach fluid may have therapeutic consequences since it<br>
15 imposes an upper limit on the rate at which an orally-administered active ingredient<br>
may reach the patient's bloodstream. The rate of dissolution is thus a consideration in<br>
formulating solid dosage forms and liquid medicaments such as syrups and elixirs. .<br>
Likewise, different crystals or amorphous form may have different processing<br>
20 properties, such as hygroscopicity, flowability, compactation, and the like, which could<br>
affect their suitability as active pharmaceuticals for commercial production.<br>
During the clinical development of pharmaceutical drugs, if the polymorphic form is<br>
not held constant, the exact dosage form used or studied may not be comparable from<br>
25 one lot to another. It is also desirable to have processes for producing a compound with<br>
the selected polymorphic form in high purity when the compound is used in clinical<br>
studies or commercial products since impurities present may produce undesired<br>
toxicological effects. Certain polymorphic forms may exhibit enhanced<br>
thermodynamic stability or may be more readily manufactured in high purity in large<br>
30 quantities, and thus are more suitable for inclusion in pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
JNJ-26481585 has the following structure:<br><br>
35<br><br>
The compound is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC).<br>
WO 2006/010750 published on 2 february 2006 discloses an amorphous form of JNJ-<br>
5 2648I585.C2HF3O2 salt and a di- HCI salt and processes for obtaining them.<br>
The synthesis of JNJ-26481585.C2HF302 salt as originally described in WO 97/21701,<br>
is presented in scheme 1.<br>
10 Therein, in step 1 intermediates of formula (III) were prepared by reacting an<br>
intermediate of formula (I) with the carboxaldehyde of formula (II), in the presence of<br>
sodium tetrahydroborate, in methanol.<br>
In step 2 intermediates of formula (IV) were prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
15 formula (III) with sodium hydroxide in ethanol.<br>
In step 3, intermediates of formula (V) were prepared by reacting an intermediate of<br>
formula (IV) with 0-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)- hydroxylamine, in the presence.of<br>
appropriate reagents such as  N-(ethyIcarbonimidoyl)-AfiV-dimethyl-l,3-<br>
20 propanediamine, monohydrochloride (EDO) and 1 -hydroxy-l#-benzotriazole (HOBT).<br>
The reaction was performed in a mixture of dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In step 4, the hydroxamic acid C2HF3O2 salt of formula (VI) was prepared by reacting<br>
the intermediate of formula (V), with trifluoro acetic acid. Said reaction was performed<br>
25 in methanol.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the JNJ-26481585. 2HC1 salt as originally described in WO 97/21701,<br>
5 was prepared by reacting the intermediate of formula (III), with hydroxylamine, in the<br>
presence of sodium hydroxide. Said reaction is performed in methanol, further<br>
conversion to the di-HCl salt was prepared in ethanol.<br>
The process disclosed in WO 2006/010750 is unsuitable for large scale production as<br>
10 the consequence of low yields and high amount of impurities in the different process<br>
steps, which consequently requires several chromatographic steps. The purification of<br>
compounds using chromatography is expensive and environmentaly unfriendly due to<br>
solvent consumption and the specialised equipment required to perform a large scale<br>
chromatography.<br>
15,<br>
The problem solved by the present invention is the provision of novel crystalline forms<br>
of mono-HCl salts and a mono-HCl salt hydrate of JNJ-26481585. Another aspect of<br>
the present invention is a process wherein the novel crystalline HC1 salt and HC1 salt<br>
hydrate form are obtained in high yield and high purity. The advantageous properties of<br>
20 the present HC1 forms are superior physicochemical properties including its non-<br>
hygroscopic nature and chemical stability enabling drugability of this compound.<br><br>

Description of the Invention<br>

Preparation of the intermediates<br>
A. Preparation of the intermediate of formula (II<br>
a) The intermediate of formula (XI) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IX) with an intermediate of formula (X) in the presence of a suitable solvent such as a polar or apolar non-protic hydrocarbon solvent e.g. toluene, methylene 35 chloride, isopropyl acetate, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran and the like. Other aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes can be used in the process. This reaction can also be performed<br>
30<br><br><br>
in protic solvents e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like. The reaction can be performed at a temperature between<br>
25 °C and 60 °C, preferably at a temperature of 45 °C. Higher temperatures are not recommended due to potential instability of the intermediate of formula (X).<br>
5<br>
b) The intermediate of formula (VIII) can be prepared by converting the intermediate of formula (VII) in the presence of a suitable oxidant such as meta-chloroperoxy benzoic 10 acid (MCPBA), in a suitable solvent such as a polar or apolar non-protic hydrocarbon solvent e.g. toluene, methylene chloride, isopropyl acetate, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran and the like. The reaction can be performed at a temperature between —20 °C and 40 °C, preferably at a temperature between 0 °C and 5 °C more preferably at 0°C. At higher temperatures meta-chloroperoxy benzoic acid is unstable and the 15 intermediates of formula (VIII) may decompose. Complete conversion of intermediate (VII) into intermediate (VIII) can be obtained by addition of the appropriate amount of MCPBA. Thus the amount of MCPBA is preferably &gt; 1 equivalent.<br>
20<br>
c) The intermediate of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting the intermediate of formula (VIII) with the intermediate of formula (XI) in the presence of a suitable solvent such as a polar or apolar non-protic hydrocarbon solvent or mixture thereof e.g. toluene, methylene chloride, isopropyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, a mixture of 25 diisopropylethylamine or other tertiary amine bases and ethyl acetate and the like. The reaction can be performed at a temperature between<br>
-20 °C and 40 °C, preferably at a temperature between 0 °C and 5 °C more preferably at 0 °C with warming up to 25 °C.<br><br><br><br>
This synthesis with the temporary protection of the aminopiperidine of formula (IX) with the p-nitrobenzaldehyde of formula (X) with the formation of the intermediate of 5 formula (XI), allows for the preferential reaction of the more substituted ring nitrogen. If this protection is not performed, large amounts of dimer (A) and isomer (B) are formed as both nitrogens of the intermediate of formula (IX) will react with the intermediate of formula (VIII). Warming up the reaction mixture overnight ensures complete reaction of the intermediate of formula (XI) to the intermediate of formula (I) 10 and complete conversion of any remaining intermediate of formula (IX) to the the dimer (A) which, together with remaining MCPBA, can be easily removed in the subsequent acidic workup.<br><br><br><br>
15 An embodiment of the present invention comprises the intermediate of formula (XI). B. Preparation of the intermediate of formula (XIII)<br>
20<br>
a) The intermediate of formula (XII) can be prepared by reacting the intermediate of<br>
formula (I) with the intermediate of formula (II) in a Suitable solvent. The reaction can<br>
be performed at a temperature between 50 °C and 150 °C, preferably at a temperature<br>
of 110 °C (reflux temperature of toluene). Azeotropic removal of water is required for<br>
25 this reaction to proceed. As solvent a polar or apolar non-protic hydrocarbon solvent<br>
can be used, such as toluene, isopropyl acetate and the like. These solvents azeotrope<br>
water well.<br><br>
b) the intermediate of formula (XII) is treated with sodium tetrahydroborate in a<br>
suitable solvent such as polar or apolar non-protic and protic hydrocarbon solvents and<br>
5 mixtures thereof e.g. toluene, isopropyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol and the<br>
like. The reduction with sodium tetrahydroborate can occur between 0 °C and 50 °C,<br>
preferably at 10 °C. Low temperature during reduction is preferred to avoid formation<br>
of over-reduced impurities<br>
10 c) Subsequently, salt formation is performed with furmaric acid in a mixture of<br>
acetone / ethanol with 5% v / v water, with the formation of the intermediate of formula<br>
(XIII).<br>
15<br>
An embodiment of the present invention comprises the fumarate salt of formula (XIII).<br>
C, Preparation of intermediate of formula fXVIII)<br>
20 In a first attempt to find a better synthesis method for the production of JNJ-26481585,<br>
the intermediate of formula (III) was reacted with 0-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-y})-<br>
hydroxylamine, in the presence of a base and a solvent but without coupling reagent.<br>
This attempt was not successful.<br><br><br><br>
In a second attempt it was tried to protect the amino and hydroxamic acid moieties with<br>
acid labile protecting groups in order to effect simultaneous deprotection-salt<br>
formation.<br>
Therefore the intermediate of formula (XIII) was converted to the free base, giving the<br>
5 intermediate of formula (III) and further converted to the intermediate of formula<br>
(XIV), wherein R is tertiair butyl, benzyl or fulveneyl followed by hydrolysis with<br>
NaOH in ethanol and isolation of the intermediate of formula (XV) by acidification and<br>
crystallization directly from the reaction mixture.<br>
20 Attempts to deprotect the intermediate of formula (XVI), wherein R is tertiary butyl,<br>
were then undertaken under a variety of conditions (solvents: ethanol, ethylacetate,<br>
toluiene, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, dimethylformamide; Acids: ethane sulfonic<br>
acid, methane sulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid).<br>
Unfortunately either at ambient temperature (2-3 hours) or at 50 °C (10 min) the only<br>
25 products observed were products from cleavage of the indole moiety.<br>
The hydrogenolysis of intermediates of formula (XVI), wherein R is benzyl, was<br>
attempted under hydrogen atmosphere and in the presence of an appropriate catalyst<br>
such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal and was judged unsuccessful due to<br>
30 competing cleavage (up to 20%) of the N-O bond on the hydroxamic acid product. On<br>
Coupling of the intermediate of formula (XV) with 0-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-<br>
hydroxylamine under standard aminoacid coupling conditions (EDC, HOBT,<br>
triethylamine,tetrahydrofuran) afforded the intermediate of formula (XVI) in excellent<br>
yield. The coupling reaction for intermediates of formula (XV) wherein R is fulvenyl<br>
caused some cleavage of the fulvenyl-group due to the triethylamine needed for<br>
optimal coupling.<br>
10<br>
15<br><br><br><br>
the other hand, cleavage of the fulvenyl group of the intermediate of formula (XVI), wherein R is fulvenyl, herein referred to as the intermediate of formula (XVI-a) under mild conditions and trapping the fulvene by-product by using thiol silica gel was successful. The corresponding free amine of formula (V) can give the compound of 5 formula (XIX) under similar conditions (1.05 equivalents of hydrochloric acid, ethanol, 70°C) as described below.<br>
10 a) Finally, the free base of intermediate (Xffi) can be obtained by an aqueous sodium hydroxide neutralization and extraction in methyltetrahydrofuran. The organic layer containing the free base is then submitted to a basic hydrolysis with 3 mole equivalents sodium hydroxides in water at reflux. The sodium salt in the water layer is then separated from the methyltetrahydofuran layer and acidified with 5 mole equivalents 15 HC1 at 10°C.<br>
The intermediate of formula (XVII) can have a variable water content. Immediately after drying the water content is 0.7 %. When the sample was left 24 h at the atmosphere, the water content increased and stabilized at 8 % water which represents 2 mole of water.<br>
b) The effect of water in intermediate (XVII) is crucial, as the below coupling reaction requires a specific amount of water to be successful. The amount of water in<br>
25 intermediate (XVII) is preferably between 15 and 25 v/v %, most preferably ca 16 v/v %.<br>
The intermediates of formula (XVIII) can be prepared by reacting the intermediate of formula (XVII) with 0-(tetrahydro-2H~pyran-2-yl)- hydroxylamine, in the presence of appropriate reagents such as N-(ethylcarbonimidoyl)-N, N-dimethyl-l ,3-<br><br><br><br>
propanediamine, monohydrochloride (EDC) as coupling reagent. The reaction can be performed in polar or apolar non-protic and protichydrocarbon solvents and mixtures thereof e.g.methyl tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl form amide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), toluene, isopropanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropanol acetate, 5 mixture thereof and mixture of one or more of the diff erent solvents with water, preferably a mixture of ethylacetate and ethanol, more preferably a mixture of ethylacetate, ethanol and water. The temperature during the reaction can be between 10 °C - 40 °C, preferably at room temperature.<br><br>
The reaction is fast and complete when enough water is present. The reaction is slower<br>
under dry conditions, more impurities are present and the reaction rate towards product<br>
drops down.<br>
15 c) The intermediate with formula (XVIII) can be dissolved in a solvent such as<br>
dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, preferably dimethylacetamide. Addition of a<br>
co-solvent allows the product to crystallize out. Co-solvents such as acetone, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone or methyl ethyl ketone, preferably methyl isobutyl ketone, can be used.<br>
Purification can be performed at a temperature between 25°C-90°C, preferably between<br>
20 50°C and 70°C. Crystalization time should not be longer than 5h. At higher<br>
temperatures or longer crystalization periods the yield of the final product goes down.<br>
Recrystallization can be performed in a solvent such as ethanol in the presence of a co-<br>
solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone at a temperature between 50°C and 70°C,<br>
preferably at 70 °C.<br>
25<br>

For the preparation of any of the Forms of the present invention, which proceeds from a<br>
solution of the compound of formula (XVIII), it should be recognized by those skilled<br>
in the art that the solid form of the starting material has no influence on the solid form<br>
10 of the end product and control of the resulting solid Form is performed via the control<br>
of the process parameters.<br>
The invention provides as well the above processes for preparing Form I comprising<br>
between step a) and b) seeding the mixture with Form I.<br>
15<br>
The invention provides as weff the above processes for preparing the hydrate form<br>
comprising between step a) and b) seeding the mixture with Form I.<br>
The invention provides as well a process wherein the obtained crystalline form is<br>
20 isolated by filtration or centrifugation, optionally combined with washing and drying.<br>
The starting material used for the processes of the present invention may be any<br>
crystalline form of the compound of formula (XVIII).<br>
25 With the term "compounds of the present invention" is meant a compound of formula<br>
(XI), (XIII), (XVII), (XVIII) or (XIX).<br>
In one embodiment, the solvents employed in the preparation of the crystalline forms of<br>
the present invention are pharmaceutically acceptable solvents. In another<br>
30 embodiment, the solvents employed in the preparation of the crystalline forms of the<br>
present invention are pharmaceutically non-acceptable solvents since they may also<br>
find their use in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable polymorphs.<br>
The processes for the production of the crystal forms of the present invention typically<br>
35 include obtaining a crystalline solid material from a solution or dispersion of the<br>
compound of formula (XIX) in a solvent medium, or from slurrying the compound of<br>
formula (XIX).<br><br>
One skilled in the art would appreciate that the conditions concerning crystallization<br>
may be modified in order to improve the crystallization process or to induce<br>
precipitation, and without affecting the form of the polymorph obtained. These<br>
conditions may include bringing the solution, dispersion, or slurry of compound of<br>
5 formula (XVIII) or (XIX) and the solvent(s) to a desired concentration, bringing the<br>
said solution, dispersion, or slurry to a desired temperature, adding the desired<br>
concentration of hydrochloric acid, adding crystal seeds, effecting any suitable<br>
pressure, removing and/or separating any undesired material or impurities, drying the<br>
formed crystals to obtain the polymorphs in a solid state, if such state is desired.<br>
10<br>
A preferred way of inducing precipitation is to reduce the solubility of the compounds<br>
of the invention. The solubility of the compound may be reduced, for example, by<br>
adding an anti-solvent.<br>
15 Bringing the solution, dispersion, or slurry of the compounds of the invention and<br>
solvents to a desired concentration does not necessarily imply an increase in the<br>
concentration of the compounds of the invention. In certain cases, a decrease or no<br>
change in concentration of the compound of the invention could be preferable. The<br>
techniques used for obtaining a desired concentration are those common in the art, for<br>
20 instance, evaporation by atmospheric distillation, vacuum distillation, fractioned<br>
distillation, azeotropic distillation, film evaporation, heating, cooling, other techniques<br>
well known in the art and combinations thereof. An optional process for obtaining a<br>
desired concentration could as well involve the saturation of the solution of the<br>
compounds of the invention and solvents, for example, by adding a sufficient volume<br>
25 of a non-solvent to the solution to reach the saturation point. Other suitable techniques<br>
for saturating the solution include, by way of example, the introduction of additional<br>
compound of the invention to the solution and/or evaporation of a portion of the solvent<br>
from the solution. As referred to herein, a saturated solution encompasses solutions at<br>
their saturation points or exceeding their saturation points, i.e. supersaturated. A nearly<br>
30 saturated solution refers to solutions that are near saturation but have not reached their<br>
saturation points.<br>
A way to improve the crystallization process of the present invention, in particular of<br>
accelerating crystallization, is by seeding with a crystal of the product or scratching the<br>
35 inner surface of the crystallization vessel with a glass rod. Other times, crystallization<br>
may occur spontaneously without any inducement. The present invention encompasses<br>
both embodiments where crystallization of a particular form of compound of formula<br><br>
(XIX) occurs spontaneously, or is induced or accelerated, unless if such inducement or.<br>
acceleration is critical for obtaining a particular form.<br>
The term "seeding" refers to the addition of a crystalline material to facilitate<br>
5 crystallization. The term "crystal seeds" means powder of a previously obtained<br>
crystalline form of the compound of formula (XIX). Particular crystal seeds or seeding<br>
material of the present invention, which can be useful for preparing Form I, are the<br>
following:<br>
-	crystal seeds of a mixture of Form I of compound (XIX) and the compound of<br>
10 formula (XVIII);<br>
-	crystal seeds of Form I; or<br>
-	crystal seeds of Form II.<br>
By bringing the said solution, dispersion, or slurry to a desired temperature, one will<br>
15 understand the acts of heating, cooling or leaving at ambient temperature. Warming of<br>
the solution, dispersion, or slurry may be necessary to completely dissolve the<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
Removing and/or separating any undesired material or impurities may be performed by<br>
20 purification, filtering, washing, precipitation or similar techniques. Separation, for<br>
example, can be conducted by known solid-liquid separation techniques. Filtering<br>
procedures known to those skilled in the art can as well be used in the present process.<br>
The filiations can be performed, amongst other methods, by passing the solution,<br>
dispersion, or slurry through paper, sintered glass filter or other membrane material, by<br>
25 centrifugation, or using Buchner style filter, Rosenmund filter or plates, or frame press.<br>
Preferably, in-line filtration or safety filtration may be advantageously intercalated in<br>
the processes disclosed above, in order to increase the purity of the resulting<br>
polymorphic form. Additionally, filtering agents such as silica gel, Celite®, Arbocel®,<br>
dicalite diatomite, or the like, may also be employed to separate impurities from the<br>
30 crystals of interest.<br>
Crystals obtained may be also dried, and such drying process may optionally be used in<br>
the different crystallization passages, if more than one crystallization passage is<br>
applied. Drying procedures include all techniques known to those skilled in the art,<br>
35 such as heating, applying vacuum, circulating air or gas, adding a desiccant, freeze-<br>
drying, spray-drying, evaporating, or the like, or any combination thereof.<br><br>
Processes for crystallization of polymorphs of the compound of formula (XIX) may<br>
embrace multiple combinations of techniques and variations thereof. As such, and by<br>
way of example, crystallization of polymorphs of compound of formula (XIX) may be<br>
executed by dissolving, dispersing, or slurrying compound of formula (XIX) at a<br>
5 suitable temperature in the solvent whereby portion of the said solvent evaporates<br>
increasing the concentration of the compound of formula (XIX) in the said solution,<br>
dispersion, or slurry, cooling the said mixture, and optionally washing and/or filtering<br>
and drying the resulting crystals of compound of formula (XIX). Optionally,<br>
polymorphs of compound of formula (XIX) may be prepared by dissolving, dispersing,<br>
10 or slurrying compound of formula (XIX) in a solvent medium, cooling said solution,<br>
dispersion, or slurry and subsequently filtering and drying the obtained polymorph.<br>
Another example of preparation of crystal forms of compound of formula (XIX) could<br>
be by saturating compound of formula (XIX) in the solvent medium, and optionally<br>
filtering, washing and drying obtained crystals.<br>
15<br>
Crystal formation may as Well involve more than one crystallization process. In certain<br>
cases, one, two or more extra crystallization steps may be advantageously performed<br>
for different reasons, such as, to increase the quality of the resulting crystal form.<br>
20 By dissolving, dispersing, or slurrying the compound of the invention in the solvent,<br>
one may obtain different degrees of dispersion, such as suspensions, slurries or<br>
mixtures; or preferably obtain homogeneous one-phase solutions. The term<br>
"suspension" refers to a two-phase system consisting of a finely divided solid, in<br>
amorphous, crystalline form, or mixtures thereof, dispersed (suspended) in a liquid or<br>
25 dispersing medium, usually the solvent. The term "slurry" refers to a suspension<br>
formed when a quantity of powder is mixed into a liquid in which the solid is only<br>
slightly soluble (or not soluble). "Slurrying" refers to the making of a slurry.<br>
Optionally, the solvent medium may contain additives, for example one or more<br>
30 dispersing agents, surfactants or other additives, or mixtures thereof of the type<br>
normally used in the preparation of crystalline suspensions and which are well<br>
documented in the literature. The additives may be advantageously used in modifying<br>
the shape of crystal by increasing the leniency and decreasing the surface area.<br>
35 The solvent medium containing the solid may optionally be stirred for a certain period<br>
of time, or vigorously agitated using, for example, a high shear mixer or homogeniser<br>
or a combination of these, to generate the desired particle size for the organic<br>
compound.<br><br>
Control of precipitation temperature and seeding may be additionally used to improve<br>
the reproducibility of the crystallization process, the particle size distribution and form<br>
of the product. As such, the crystallization can be effected without seeding with<br>
5 crystals of the compound of the formula (XIX) or preferably in the presence of crystals<br>
of the compound of the formula (XIX), which are introduced into the solution by<br>
seeding. Seeding can also be effected several times at various temperatures. The<br>
amount of the seed material depends on the scale of the experiment and can readily be<br>
determined by a person skilled in the art. Typically, the amount of seeding material is<br>
10 about 0.1 to 1 weight% of the amount of crystalline material expected from the<br>
reaction.<br>
The time for crystallization in each crystallization step will depend on the conditions<br>
applied, the techniques employed and/or solvents used.<br>
15<br>
Breaking up the large particles or aggregates of particles after crystal conversion may<br>
additionally be performed in order to obtain a desired and homogeneous particle size.<br>
Accordingly, the crystals, powder aggregates and coarse powder of the polymorphic<br>
forms of compound of formula (XIX) may be optionally milled and sorted by size after<br>
20 undergoing conversion. Milling or grinding refers to physically breaking up the large<br>
particles or aggregates of particles using methods and apparatus well known in the art<br>
for particle size reduction of powders. Resulting particle sizes may range from<br>
millimeters to nanometers, yielding i.e. nanocrystals, microcrystals.<br>
25 A preferred apparatus for milling or grinding is a fluid energy mill, or micronizer,<br>
because of its ability to produce particles of small size in a narrow size distribution.<br>
Micronizers use the kinetic energy of collision between particles suspended in a rapidly<br>
moving fluid stream to cleave the particles. An air jet is a preferred fluid energy mill.<br>
The suspended particles are injected under pressure into a recirculating particle stream.<br>
30 Smaller particles are carried aloft inside the mill and swept into a vent connected to a<br>
particular size classifier such as a cyclone. One of skill in the art would appreciate that<br>
some crystalline forms may undergo a transition to another form during particle size<br>
reduction.<br>

relative humidity was investigated on about 24 mg Form II<br>
The weight change as a function of relative humidity was registered.<br>
10	The result were displayed in the Figure 9.<br>
During the initial drying step a weight loss of 1.67% is registered for Form II.<br>
The obtained dried product was hygroscopic. It adsorbed up to 9.6% water at<br>
high relative humidity.<br>
The product dryed completely during the desorption cycle and remained<br>
15	crystalline during the test.<br>
c)	Crystallographic stability<br>
The stability of the crystal structure of Form II was studied after storage of the<br>
compound in open conditions for a period of six weeks at room temperature<br>
(RT) under 
20	40°C/75%RH.<br>
The samples were analyzed with thermogravimetry (TGA), differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and infrared<br>
spectroscopy (IR).<br><br>
~Ref: identical with reference Cryst.: crystalline<br>
Form II melted with decomposition, therefore no heat of fusion was reported.<br>
5	The extra endothermic signal in the DSC curve was due to solvent<br>
evaporation.<br>
Form II is crystallographically not stable.<br>
Changes are observed after storage under the different humid conditions.<br>
The IR spectra and XRD patterns are different from the starting material after<br>
10	storage under RT/56%RH, RT/75%RH and 40°C/75%RH condition.<br>
The changes after storage under RT/56%RH, RT/75%RH and 40°C/75%RH .<br>
condition were due to the uptake of water.<br>
