				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel antidiabetic compounds, their tautomeric forms, their   dervatives,    their   analogues,    their    stereoisomers,    their   polymorphs,    their<br>
pharmaceutically   acceptable   salts,   their   pharmaceutically   acceptable   solvates   and	<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them. This invention particularly relates to novel azolidinedione of the general formula (I), their derivativesj their analogues, their tautomeric fprms, .their stereoisomers, their polymorphs and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel azolidinedione compounds, their analogues, their d«ivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
_ This invention also relate to novel intermediates, processes for preparing the intehnediates and processes for using the intermediates.<br>
The azolidinediones of the general fonnula (I) defined above of the present invention are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of hyperlipemia, hypercholesteremia, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and also diseases or conditions in which insulin resistance is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Examples of these diseases and conditions are type II diabetes^ impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis. The azolidinediones of the fonnula (I) are useful for the treatoient of insulin resistance associated with obesity and psoriasis. The Azolidinediones of the fonnula (I) can also be used to treat diabetic complications and can be used for treatment and/or prophylaxis of other diseases and conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome<br><br>
(PCOS), cwtain renal diseases, including diabetic n^hropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, end-stage raial diseases and microalbuminuria as well as certain eating disorders, as aldose reductase Inhibitors and for improving cognitive functions in dementia.<br>
Background of the Invention Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations.  In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing whichj the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes.  Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnonnalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl J. Med. (1987) 317: 350 - 357 ; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., (1988) 66 :580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest, (1975) 68 : 957 - 969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608).   It is now increasingly being reco^iized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclCTOsis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance wifli obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrome-X. In addition, polycystic ovarian syndrome (Patent Application No. WO 95/07697), psoriasis (Patent Application No. WO 95/35108), draientia (Behavioral Brain Research (1996) 75 : 1 - 1  1) etc. may also have insulin resistance as a central pathogenic feature. Recently, it has also been reported that thia2oHdinediones improve the bone mineral density and thus may be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis (EP-783888).<br>
A number of molecular defects have been associated with insulin resistarifee. These include reduced expression of insulin receptors on the plasma membrane of insulin responsive cells and alterations in the signal transduction pathways that become activated after insulin binds to its receptor including glucose transport and glycogen synthesis.<br>
Since defective insulin action is thought to be more important than failure of insulin secretion in the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and other related implications, this raises doubts about the intrinsic suitability of antidiabetic treatment that is based entirely upon stimulation of insulin release. Recently, Takeda has developed a new class of compound^ which are the derivatives of 5-(4-alkoxybenzyl)-2,4-thiazolidinediones of the formula (II) (Ref Chem. Pharm. Bull 1982, Jf?, 3580-3600).

The compound of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to mammals, including man, via eittier oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is<br><br>
essential that the drug be administered parenterally. By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 0. 10 mg to about 200 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day or preferably about 0. 10 mg to about 50 mg / kg body weight per day administered singly or as a diviied dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active compound will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in the amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in the range as described above. Thus, for oral administration, the compounds can be combmed with a suitable solid or liquid carrier or diluent to form capsules, tablets, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions, may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavourants, sweeteners, excipients and the like. For parenteral administration, the compounds can be combined with sterile aqueous or orgamc media to form injectable solutions or. suspensions. For example, solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as well as fqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts or alkali or alkaline eaxth metal salts of the compounds. The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be, administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred in humans.<br>

Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary<br>
regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes<br>
associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and<br>
ob/ob (See Diabetes, (1982) 31(1) : 1- 6) in mice and fa/fa and zucker rats have been<br>
developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and<br>
testing the efficacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu.<br>
Rep. Sankyo Res.  Lab. (1994). 46 : 1-57).  The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db<br>
mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and<br>
insulin resistant (J.  Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 : 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and<br>
normoglycemic.   In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a<br>
feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels<br>
are insufficiently controlled.   The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the<br>
models.  Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes meilitus, the compounds of the<br>
present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
The compounds of the present inventions showed blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities through improved insulin resistance. This was demonstrated by the following in vivo experiments.<br>
Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, procured from the Jackson Laboratory, USA, were used in the experiment. The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) and<br><br>
acidified water, ad libitum. The animals having more than 300 mg / dl blood sugar were used for testing. The number of animals in each group was 4.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 yil) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglyceride levels were measured spectrometrically, by glucose oxidase and glycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase en2yme (Dr. Redd/s Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, hidia) methods respectively. On 6th day the blood samples were collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br>
Test compounds were suspended on 0.25 % carboxymethyl cellulose and administered to test group at a dose of 10 mg to 200 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). Troglitazone (100 mg / kg, daily those) was used as a standard drug which showed 28 % reduction in random blood sugar level on 6th day.<br>
The blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according to the formula:<br><br><br><br>
The experimental results from the db/db /nice suggest that the novel compounds of the present invention also possess therapeutic utility as a prophylactic or regular treatment for obesity, cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and other diseases; as it is known from the literature that such diseases are interrelated to each other.<br>
Blood glucose level and triglycerides are also lowered at doses greater than 30 mg/kg. Normally, the quantum of reduction is dose dependent.<br><br><br><br>
