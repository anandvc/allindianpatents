PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF COMBRETASTATINS The present invention relates to a novel<br>
process for the preparation of combretastatins and of<br>
their derivatives.<br>
The term "combretastatins" or "stilbene<br>
derivatives" is understood to mean the derivatives of<br>
following general formula:<br><br>
in which A represents a hydroxyl group or an amino group, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Mention may be made, among the salts, of the hydrochloride, acetate, phosphate or methanesulphonate. When the compound A is an amino group, it can also be coupled to amino acids to result in amides, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The synthesis of stilbene derivatives or combretastatins, which can be in the form of a pharmaceutical acceptable salt, and the pharmaceutical compositions which comprise them are disclosed in Patents US 4 996 237, US 5 525 632, US 5 731 353 and US 5 674 906. These patents disclose combretastatins and their metabolites and disclose their in vitro oncologic activity.<br>
According to these patents, combretastatins are prepared from (3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)triphenyl-phosphonium salts, which is condensed with a 3-nitro-<br><br>
or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (the hydroxyl group of which is protected) in the presence of sodium hydride or of lithium derivatives, and then the derivative obtained, when it is nitrated, is reduced in the presence of zinc.<br>
The isomer with the cis configuration is subsequently prepared by the action of light or by chromatographic separation of the mixture.<br>
The present invention relates to novel processes for the preparation of combretastatins or of their derivatives and to improvements to- the existing processes.<br>
A first process route VO 1 for the preparation of derivatives of formula (I) for which A represents an amino group has first been discovered, which process is an improvement to the process disclosed in the abovementioned patents, which consists, after the Wittig condensation in the presence of (3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide or chloride and of 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, in carrying out the reduction in the presence of iron, instead of the zinc used in the prior publications, which makes it possible to achieve an overall reaction yield, with respect to the aldehyde charged, of 60% (the yield with respect to the aldehyde charged in Patent US 5 525 632 is between 21% to 33%).<br>
The first process route VO 2 consists in condensing 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde with (4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide<br><br>
or chloride. For both these first two processes routes VO 1 and VO 2, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base chosen in particular from potassium tert-butoxide, sodium tert-pentoxide, sodium hydride, butyllithium, LDA (lithium diisopropylamine), sodium methoxide, potassium carbonate or alkaline derivatives of hexamethyldisil^nes.<br>
This reaction is carried out in various solvents, such as ethers (THF), polar aprotic solvents (acetonitrile, NMP, DMF, DMSO, and the like), alcohols, aromatic solvents or water, at a temperature which will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art to the base used and to the solvent used.<br>
This reaction, as regards the first process route VO 2, is described in particular in the publication by K.G. Piney which appeared in Bioorg. Med. Chem., 8(2000), 2417-2425.<br>
2-Methoxy-5-[2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-vinylJnitrophenyl is reduced according to the improved process of the invention by the action of iron. It is advantageous to use an amount of iron in excess if complete conversion of the starting material is desired. This excess is advantageously greater than 2 equivalents per one mol of starting nitro derivative.<br>
It has been shown that the same stage, carried out in the presence of zinc in acetic acid, a conventional solvent for reductions with zinc, does not make it possible to obtain complete reaction (in Patent US 5 525 632, the yield of the reduction carried out on<br><br>
the pure Z isomer varies between 46 and 66%) and, moreover, the amounts of zinc used are large and consequently result in considerable industrial waste. Furthermore, the process generates a large amount of "azo" compound resulting from coupling between the amino formed and the nitroso intermediate in the reduction.<br>
Reduction with nascent hydrogen, generated by ammonium formate in the presence of a conventional<br>
catalyst, such as palladium or platinum, leads to high isomerization of the double bond to the undesirable E isomer and to partial saturation of the double bond.<br>
The abovementioned Piney publication describes the reduction by sodium hydrosulphite of a pure nitro Z isomer, obtained after chromatography and recrystallization, leading to an amino Z isomer with a yield of only 37%.<br>
Hydrogenations with molecular hydrogen, catalysed by platinum or palladium, are rarely complete and result in particular in the saturation of the ethylenic double bond.<br>
A second process has also been found which avoids the intermediate reduction stage necessary when starting from a nitro derivative. This is because it is much more economical to condense, according to a first method of carrying out this second process, a (3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide or chloride with a 3-amino-4-methoxybenzaldehyde or, according to a second method of carrying out this<br><br>
second process, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde with a (3-amino-4-methoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium salt.<br>
This second process according to its two alternative forms requires a stage in which less in the way of CMR (Cancerogenic, Mutagenic or Reproductive toxic) products are given off in comparison with the first processes routes VO 1 and VO 2, which is a considerable advantage at the industrial level from the viewpoint of safety and production cost.<br>
According to the second process route VO 3 for implementing the invention, the<br>
(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium salt and 3-amino-4-methoxybenzaldehyde are brought together and the reaction is carried out, preferably, in the presence of a base chosen in particular from potassium tert-butoxide, sodium tert-pentoxide, sodium hydride, butyllithium, LDA, sodium methoxide, potassium carbonate or alkaline derivatives of<br>
hexamethyldisilanes. Use is preferably made of sodium methoxide.<br>
This reaction is carried out in various solvents, such as ethers (THF), polar aprotic solvents (acetonitrile, NMP, DMF, DMSO, and the like), alcohols, aromatic solvents or water, at a temperature which will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art to the base used and to the solvent used.<br>
The reaction temperature will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art to the base used. When methoxide is used, it is preferably between 0 and 10°C.<br><br>
After reaction, the base used is neutralized with an acid in aqueous solution, the organic phase is washed and concentrated, and the expected product is obtained after chromatographing the crude concentrate.<br>
According to the second process route VO 4 for implementing the invention, in which the (3-amino-4-methoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium salt and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde are brought together, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an organic base chosen in particular from potassium tert-butoxide, sodium tert-pentoxide, sodium hydride, butyllithium, LDA, sodium methoxide, potassium carbonate or alkaline derivatives of<br>
hexamethyldisilanes. Use is preferably made of sodium methoxide.<br>
This reaction is carried out in various solvents, such as ethers (THF), polar aprotic solvents (acetonitrile, NMP, DMF, DMSO, and the like), alcohols, aromatic solvents or water, at a temperature which will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art to the base used and to the solvent used.<br>
The reaction temperature will be adjusted by a person skilled in the art to the base used. When methoxide is used, it is preferably between 0 and 10°C. After reaction, the base used is neutralized with an acid in aqueous solution, the organic phase is washed and concentrated, and the expected product is obtained after chromatographing the crude concentrate.<br>
The derivative obtained according to the<br><br>
second process route VO 3 or VO 4 or during the second stage of the first process route VO 1 or VO 2 has the following formula:<br><br>
It is advantageous, when it is desired to couple serine with the compound of formula (IIa), to use L-serine doubly protected on the nitrogen of the serine and on the hydroxyl functional group of general formula (IIb)<br><br>
where PG represents a protective group for the amine functional group known to any person skilled in the art, to give a novel intermediate of following general<br>
formula:<br><br>
which is subsequently cleaved, preferably simultaneously with the opening of the ring, by acid hydrolysis according to a deprotection reaction known to any person skilled in the art. Preferably, the PG<br><br>
group of the formulae (lib) or (III) represents a protective group chosen from the following groups: tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC).<br>
The compound of formula (III) above is novel and is claimed as such.<br>
Th.e condensation is advantageously carried out in the presence of EDC1 (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide chloride) or in the presence of DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and of HOBT (hydroxybenzotriazole) or in the presence of DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and of HOSU<br>
(N-hydroxysuccinimide) or, finally, in the presence of TOTU (0-[(ethoxycarbonyl)cyanomethyleneamino]-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate) or of HBTU (O-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) or of N,N-carbonyldiimidazole. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent which is inert with respect to the reaction, which solvent is chosen in particular from polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran or chlorinated aliphatic solvents, such as dichloromethane, or, finally, esters,<br>
The coupling to the derivative of formula (IIa) can also certainly be carried out by the action of a mixed anhydride, synthesized in situ between a chloroformate or a carboxylic acid chloride, for example pivaloyl chloride, and doubly protected L-serine of formula (IIb), in the presence of a<br><br>
tertiary base of the NMM (N-methylmorpholine) type in various solvents which are inert with respect to the reaction, esters, ethers, chlorinated solvents, acetonitrile, and the like. The mixed anhydride is preferably prepared at a temperature of between 0 and 10°C and then the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature. After reaction, the reaction mixture is hydrolysed with an aqueous solution, then the mixture is separated by settling and the organic phase obtained is washed with a hydroxylated base.<br>
The double deprotection of the compound of formula (III) is carried out by the action of an organic or inorganic acid. Use is preferably made of concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid in an alcoholic medium. The reaction temperature is, according to a better means of implementation of the invention, between 50 and 70°C.<br>
The invention will be more fully described with the help of the following examples, which must not be regarded as limiting the invention.<br>
The composition of the mixtures, the monitoring and the progression of the reactions, and the yield of the unisolated products/intermediates and their assays are determined by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis.<br>
Example 1 - First process route V0 2 according to the invention<br>
(Z)-N-[2-Methoxy-5-[2-(3,4,5-trimethoxypheny1)vinyl]-<br><br>
phenyl]-L-serinamide hydrochloride<br>
General scheme of the synthesis<br>
The novel "inverse Wittig" process, starting from (4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, makes it possible to obtain the mixture of Z and E isomers of 2-methoxy~5- [2-(3,4, 5-trimethoxyphenyl) vinyl] -nitrophenyl with a Z/E ratio of 75/25.<br><br>
This ratio is sufficiently high in the Z nitro isomer to be able to use the Z/E mixture directly in the reduction and to obtain, by crystallization of the hydrochloride, the Z amino isomer with an HPLC assay of 97% IS (internal standardization).<br>
(4-Methoxy-3-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (4) is prepared according to the following<br><br><br>
3-Nitro-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (2):<br>
90.5 g of 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (1) are charged, followed by 450 ml of THF and 90 ml of ethanol, to a 2-litre three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a T piece, a funnel for the addition of solid and a reflux condenser surmounted by a bubble counter. The pale-yellow solution obtained is cooled to 10°C and then 10 g of sodium borohydride are charged over 40 minutes at 10/15°C (the reaction is very exothermic and the temperature has to be maintained with an ice/acetone bath); at the end of the addition, the brown solution turns navy blue. The solution is stirred for 30 minutes at 10°C, the end of the reaction is monitored by TLC (thin layer chromatography), the solution is stirred for a further 1 hour at 10°C and then the temperature is allowed to return to ambient temperature.<br>
The addition funnel is replaced by a 500 ml pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, via which 300 ml of distilled water are run in dropwise over 30 minutes while maintaining the mixture at 20°C. Gas evolution is observed when the water begins to be run in.<br>
The mixture is concentrated to 2/3 on a<br><br>
rotary evaporator (50°C/20 mmHg) and a white product crystallizes in the aqueous concentrate in the form of lumps.<br>
The cooled aqueous phase is extracted with 250 ml and then 150 ml of dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases are washed with 250 ml of distilled water and then dried over magnesium sulphate.<br>
After filtration, the dichloromethylene solution is used as is in the following bromination reaction.<br>
Theyield of this stage is regarded as being 100%.<br>
N.B.: The alcohol (2) is commercially available but very difficult to get hold of. 3-Nitro-4-methoxybromobenzyl (3):<br>
The dichloromethylene solution of 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (2) is charged to a 1 litre three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a T piece, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser surmounted by a bubble counter, and 100 ml of dichloromethane are added. The stirred solution is cooled to 5°C and then 135.4 g of phosphorus tribromide are run in dropwise while maintaining the temperature at 5°C.<br>
The solution is stirred at 5°C for 1 hour 3 0 minutes, the end of the reaction is monitored by TLC and then 2 50 ml of saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution are run in dropwise while maintaining the temperature at 15°C. Very strong evolution of gas takes<br><br>
place with a slight delay as "the phosphorus tribrornide is run in.<br>
The medium, separated by settling in a separating funnel, is washed successively with 250 ml of distilled water and 200 ml of saturated sodium hydrogencarbpnate solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (50°C/20 mmHg).<br>
119 g of solid in the form of green-yellow<br>
felt-like needles are obtained with a chemical yield<br>
over two stages of 97%.<br>
N.B.: This product (3) can alsp be prepared according<br>
to the following scheme, described in the publication:<br>
K.G. Piney et al., Bioorg. Med, Chem., 8 (2000), 2417-<br>
2425. <br>
(3-Nitro-4-methoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide<br>
(4) :<br>
119 g of 3-nitro-4-methoxybromobenzyl (3) are charged to a stirred heel of 1 000 ml of toluene in a 2 litre three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a T piece, a funnel for the addition of solid and a reflux condenser surmounted by a bubble counter, and the mixture, warmed to 2 5°C, passes into solution. 126.5 g of triphenylphosphine are then added and the solution obtained is gradually<br><br>
heated to 60°C; a precipitate is formed from 30°C. The mixture is maintained at 60/65°C for 4 hours, is then cooled to 30°C and is filtered through a sintered glass filter. The filter residue is washed on the filter with 2 times 300 ml of toluene, pulled dry and dried in an oven (35°C/20 mmHg/20 hours).<br>
217 g of (4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzyl)triphenyl-phosphonium Bromide are obtained with a chemical yield of 88%.<br>

54.7 g of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (5), 148.6 g of (4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzyl)triphenyl-phosphonium bromide (4) and 1 3 00 ml of toluene are charged, at 20°C and under nitrogen, to a 2 litre three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a T piece, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser surmounted by a bubble counter. The stirred suspension is cooled to 5°C using an ice bath and then 63.2 g of a 25% w/w solution of sodium methoxide in methanol are run in at 5°C over 40 minutes.<br>
As the addition progresses, the suspension changes from off-white to yellow and then to brown.<br>
■  V<br>
The mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 5°C and the end of the reaction is monitored by HPLC (complete consumption of the aldehyde). 3 g (0.05 mol) of acetic acid are then added.<br>
The suspension is heated to 40°C and is maintained at 40°C for 30 minutes. At this temperature, only the salts remain insoluble. The mixture is filtered at 40°C through a sintered glass filter No. 3 and the salts are washed on the filter with 3 times 100 ml of toluene.<br><br>
The filtrate is returned to a round-bottomed flask with 250 ml of distilled water, and the two-phase mixture is stirred for 20 minutes at 40°C and then separated by settling in a separating funnel. The toluene phase is washed again with 2 times 250 ml of distilled water and then concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator.<br>
The residue is taken up in 600 ml of isopropanol and 12 ml of toluene at 40°C, the expected product begins to crystallize and the temperature is allowed to return to ambient temperature overnight with slow stirring.<br>
The stirred suspension is cooled to and maintained for 1 hour at 5°C and then filtered through a sintered glass filter, and the cake is washed with 2 times 125 ml of isopropanol, pulled dry and dried in an oven under vacuum (35°C/30 mmHg/18 hours).<br>
91.7 g of a mixture of Z and E isomers (6) and (7) are obtained with a Z/E ratio of 75/25 (IS HPLC) and- a yield of 95%.<br>

N.B.: Numerous operating conditions were experimented with, such as:<br>
Solvents: THF, acetonitrile, methanol and other alcohols, dichloromethane,   NMP, DMF, DMSO, and the like.<br><br>
Bases: potassium t-butoxide, sodium t-pentoxide, sodium<br>
hydroxide, NaH, BuLi/LDA, potassium carbonate and the<br>
like.<br>
Temperatures: from -10°C to the reflux temperatures of<br>
some solvents<br>
Z-2-Methoxy-5-[2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)vinyl]-<br>
phenylamine hydrochloride (8):<br><br>
80 g of 75/25 Z and E-mixture of 2-methoxy-[2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)vinylnitrophenyl (6) and (7), 640 ml of absolute ethanol and 160 ml of distilled water are charged, at 20°C and under nitrogen, to a 2 litre three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a T piece, a funnel for the addition of solid, a reflux condenser surmounted by a bubble counter, and a heating bath.<br>
The mixture is rapidly stirred and heated on an oil bath, 7.8 ml of 6N hydrochloric acid are added to the suspension at 50°C and then the temperature of the mixture is raised to 77 ± 2°C. The mixture is virtually soluble.<br>
52 g  of iron powder are added portionwise over 5 minutes. With the first addition, the mixture passes into solution and then a blackish deposit is<br><br>
formed on  the walls of the round-bottomed flask.<br>
The mixture is maintained at 77 ± 2°C for 2 hours and the disappearance of the starting nitro compounds (6) and (7) is monitored by HPLC.<br>
The mixture is allowed to cool to 40°C and is filtered through a sintered glass filter covered with clarcel and the cake is rinsed with 2 times 160 ml of 80/2 0 ethanol/water mixture.<br>
The filtrate, aqueous mother liquors and aqueous wash liquors, is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. As soon as the azeotrope has been driven off, an oil begins to precipitate in the residual aqueous phase.<br>
This aqueous phase is extracted in a separating funnel with 2 times 300 ml of dichloromethane and then the organic phase is washed with 2 times 300 ml of half-saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and with 300 ml of distilled water.<br>
The organic phase is concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator and 76 g of an oil are obtained, which oil exhibits a Z/E ratio of 80/20 by HPLC. This oil is dissolved in 591 ml of methanol and transferred into a stirred.1 litre round-bottomed flask, 100 ml of 2.32N methanolic hydrochloric acid are then added, precipitation is initiated and the mixture is allowed to precipitate overnight with stirring.<br>
The amount of methanol+ methanolic hydrochloric acid is such that the final concentration of Z isomer (determined by HPLC)-is equal to 8.8% w/v.<br><br>
In the morning, the mixture is filtered through a sintered glass filter. The dried cake weighs 8.2 g and is composed only of E isomer (HPLC).<br>
The filtrate (693 g), ratio Z/E = 86/14 (IS HPLC), is concentrated to half on a rotary evaporator, 400 ml of acetonitrile are added to the 347 g of concentrate and the mixture is reconcentrated until a concentrate of 347 g is again obtained. 1 000 ml of acetonitrile are then added and the mixture is concentrated until crystallization begins. The concentrate is then transferred into a stirred 4 litre round-bottomed flask containing 1 500 ml of acetonitrile at 60°C. The mixture copiously precipitates.<br>
