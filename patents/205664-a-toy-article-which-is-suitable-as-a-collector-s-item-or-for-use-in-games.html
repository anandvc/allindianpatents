				<th>Full Text</th>

The invention relates to a toy article which is suitable as a collector's item or for use in games, which toy article comprises a handle.<br>
Such a toy article is known per se and is for example added to boxes of cornflakes or to bags of potato crisps. A very well-known example of such a toy article is the so-called flippoÂ®. This is a round disc of for example laminated cardboard or plastic on which a picture is printed and which among other things is used as a collector's item for children and as an aid in playing games.<br>
US-A-3,792,858 discloses a sectional game device having a central portion and a plurality of relatively long arms releasably secured to the central portion. Each player grips one of the arms and tries to manipulate the device in such a way that the central portion is retained on the arm held by him and the arms or arms held by the other player or players become detached from the central portion.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a toy article of the kind referred to in the preamble which offers additional possibilities, in particular with regard to playing games.<br>
In order to accomplish that objective, the toy article according to the invention is characterized by a coupling piece for effecting a connection with a second toy article, which coupling piece is attached to said handle via a connecting element, which breaks off when a predetermined force or torque is exerted thereon.<br>
Such a toy article can be coupled to a second toy article by the user, which second toy article may be identical to the first toy article. Then one user or both users can generate a force or a torque until the connecting element in one of the two toy articles gives way. Thus it becomes possible to playa game or a match, of which for example the user of the toy article whose coupling piece has not given way is held to be the winner.<br>
The toy article from which the connecting element has broken off is visibly defective and can no longer form part of the population of potentially participating specimens. Moreover, the coupling piece that has broken off and/or the handle may serve as a trophy for the winner of the game.<br><br>
of the game.<br>
When the part of the coupling piece that is intended to be coupled to a second toy article is shaped to be able to be coupled to a coupling piece that is identical in shape, the toy articles that form part of the aforesaid population can all have an identical shape. This has advantages from a production point of view, since only one mould or set of moulds will be required in that case. In addition, every owner of such a toy article will be able to play a game or a match with every other owner.<br>
A very suitable embodiment is one wherein the part of the coupling piece that is intended to be coupled to a second toy article comprises a projection and a cavity that is complementary to said projection. It has become apparent that when such a configuration is used, the first and the second toy article can easily be fitted together, and that in addition it is possible to exert a sufficiently large force or torque on the connecting element or the connecting elements. If the projection is moreover wedge-shaped, the coupling pieces will interlock when a connection is being effected, so that the coupling piece of one toy article will remain connected to the coupling piece of the other toy article after one of the connecting elements has given way, and it can be released at a later stage.<br>
Furthermore it is preferably for the coupling piece to be connected to the handle or to the connecting element by means of a once-only snap connection. Such a snap connection can be easily effected and it can only be broken by visibly and permanently damaging at least one of the parts that are involved in the connection.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the toy article according to the invention the coupling piece or the handle comprises a cylindrical portion, by means of which it is fixed in a cylindrical cavity in the handle or in the coupling piece, respectively. When such an embodiment is used, a torque that is generated can be effectively<br><br>
transmitted to the connecting element. With such a toy article the connecting element is preferably fixed to the wall or to the bottom of the cylindrical cavity.<br>
Furthermore it is preferred that there is a certain amount of play between the coupling piece on the one hand and the connecting element and/or the handle on the other hand. Since said play allows some freedom of movement between the parts adjoining or surrounding each other, it is possible to verify, before starting the game or the match, whether the toy article has been tampered with, for example by glueing the coupling piece to the handle.<br>
The invention further pertains to a collection of a number of the toy articles as described above. Such a collection may e.g. be distributed over a (large) number of consumer products and/or be used in a game or game show.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail by means of two exemplary embodiments, which are illustrated in the drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows two identical break-off keys according to the invention, just before they are coupled together.<br>
Figure 2 is a detail view of the break-off keys according to Figure 1, after they have been connected and one of the connecting elements has broken loose.<br>
Figure 3A is a top plan view of a second break-off key according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3B is a side view of the break-off key according to Figure 3A.<br>
Figure 3C is a front view of the break-off key according to Figure 3A.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first break-off key 1 and a second break-off key 2, which are fully identical to each other. Break-off keys 1, 2 comprise a handle 3, in this case in the form of a key for bleeding a central heating system. The upper side of handle 3 of break-off key 1 is flat and thin, but its thickness increases towards the lower side (to the<br><br>
right in Figure 1), where it comprises a hollow cylindrical part 4 that defines a cylindrical cavity 5. A coupling piece 6 is accommodated in cylindrical cavity 5. Said coupling piece 6, which can also be called an adapter, comprises a cylindrical portion 7, whose external diameter is smaller than .the internal diameter of cylindrical cavity 5. The axis of rotational symmetry of cylindrical portion 7 of coupling piece 6 (substantially) coincides with the axis of rotational symmetry of cylindrical cavity 5.<br>
The lower side of coupling piece 6 is intended for being coupled to coupling piece 6' of the second break-off key 2. The two coupling pieces 6, 6T comprise a projection 9 and 9r, respectively, and a complementary cavity 8 and 8' respectively. Break-off key 1 can be connected to break-off key 2 by inserting projection 9 into cavity 8f, whereby projection 9' is simultaneously inserted into cavity 8.<br>
Break-off key 1 furthermore comprises a connecting element or break-off pin 10, which is fixed to the bottom of cylindrical cavity 5. Break-off pin 10 includes a wedge-shaped thickening 11 at its end facing away from the bottom of cylindrical cavity 5, which thickening comprises a right-angled edge. Coupling piece 6 is furthermore provided with a recess 12 at its upper side, for receiving break-off pin 10. Recess 12 comprises a right-angled edge 13, which mates with the right-angled edge of the wedge-shaped thickening 11 so as to establish a snap connection in this manner. Establishing the aforesaid snap connection can furthermore be facilitated by providing recess 12 with a sloping wall 14.<br>
Figure 2 shows the cylindrical cavities 5, 5' and the coupling pieces 6, 6f after a connection has been effected and after a torque moment has been exerted on the connection between the coupling pieces 6, 6* by means of one or both handles 3, 3'. Said torque has resulted in a force at the foot of the break-off pin 10' that exceeds the strength of said break-off pin 10' at that location. As a<br><br>
result, break-off pin 10' has been sheared off and break-off key 2 has been visibly and permanently damaged.<br>
Since the projections 9, 9' are wedge-shaped, the coupling piece 6' of the second break-off key 2 remains clamped down in the coupling piece 6 of the first break-off key 1, so that the former coupling piece can be removed from the cylindrical cavity 5' by pulling break-off keys 1 and 2 apart in the direction of the aforesaid axes of symmetry.<br>
The strength of the break-off pins 10 and 10' can be varied in several manners. For instance, the radial distance of break-off pin 10 can determine the degree to which the exerted torque is converted into a shearing force of break-off pin 10. The closer break-off pin 10 is disposed to the axis of symmetry of cylindrical cavity 5, the larger the shearing force at the foot of the break-off pin 10 resulting from the exerted torque will be, and the sooner the break-off pin 10 will give way.<br>
The strength of the break-off pin can furthermore be adapted by varying the thickness thereof or by means of additives to the material of the break-off key, which additives undermine the properties of the material or which, on the contrary, enhance said properties. Moreover, it has become apparent in practice that break-off keys that have been produced in an identical manner and from identical materials still exhibit a significant difference in strength. This difference is probably due to manufacturing tolerances.<br>
Figures 3A-3C show a second embodiment of the toy article according to the invention, viz. a second type of break-off key 31 comprising a disc-shaped handle 32. Discshaped handle 32 includes a hole 33 by means of which the user can attach one or more break-off keys 31 to a cord or a bunch of keys. In this embodiment the handle 32 has a relatively large surface area, which can be used for placing pictures or text thereon.<br>
Also this break-off key 31 includes a hollow<br><br>
cylindrical portion 34, which comprises a cylindrical cavity 35. A coupling piece 36 is present in said cylindrical cavity 35, which coupling piece is shaped to be able to be coupled to an identical coupling piece, for example of a second break-off key (not shown) that is identical to break-off key 31. Coupling piece 36 is connected by means of a snap connection to break-off pin 37, which is present at the bottom of cylindrical cavity 35. An opening 38 is formed in the wall of hollow cylindrical portion 34, at the location of break-off pin 37. A construction of this type makes it possible to produce break-off key 31 in an simple and accurate manner, since the thickness of shear pin 37 can easily be adapted in the mould in which the break-off key 31 is formed by means of a moving part in said mould. Depending on the degree to which said moving part moves inwardly, for example during an injection moulding process, the resulting shear pin will be thicker or thinner and thus stronger or less strong.<br>
The toy articles according to the invention can be made from various materials, wherein it is preferable to use plastics such as for example polyvinyl chloride, polyamide, polyester or polyolefins. It is also conceivable to use an edible material, such as sugar, for one or more parts.<br>
The toy article according to the invention can be made in various forms and/or colours, which could for example serve as a code or an indication of the force or the torque at which the connecting element that forms part of the toy article will give way.<br>
From the foregoing it will be apparent that the toy article according to the invention allows a great variety of games and competitions. Thus, a competition wherein the toy article is for example distributed nationwide may be considered, for example by adding the toy article to bags of crisps or boxes of cornflakes, and wherein a day is organized on which everybody who thinks he or she has a very strong specimen can participate in the finals. In addition<br><br>
to that the handle and/or the coupling piece of the present toy article can function as a collector's item, in particular if they are made in all kinds of special colours or if they are provided with pictures or texts. Furthermore, the toy article or a specific part thereof can function as a sort of coupon, whereby for example ten specimens can be traded for a bottle of a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste.<br>
The handle and/or the coupling piece may be provided with a symbol, such as a letter or a pictogram. Thus, the owner of several toy articles each provided with a letter which together spell the word "BACKPACK" could be allowed to exchange the said toy articles for an actual backpack. It is preferred that the symbol is invisible as long as the connecting element is still intact.<br>
Combinations of colors and pictures may be used to render the handles suitable as pieces in a game for which the distributor of the toy articles could provide a playing board.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments as described above and shown in the drawing, which can be varied in several ways without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims.<br>
Thus the toy article can be added to packages for crisps, cornflakes, chewing gum, washing-powder or other articles. It is also possible to affix the coupling piece to the inside of a cap of a bottle of a soft drink, whereby the cap also functions as a handle for the present toy article. It stands to reason that it is also possible to sell the toy article as such.<br><br><br>
