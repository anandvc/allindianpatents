FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[02] The present invention pertains to systems, methods and techniques for<br>
encoding audio signals.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[03] A variety of different techniques for encoding audio signals exist.<br>
However, improvements in performance, quality and compression are continuously<br>
desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[04] The present invention addresses this need by, among other techniques,<br>
providing an overall audio encoding technique that uses variable resolution within<br>
transient frames and generates variable-length code book segments based on magnitudes<br>
of the quantization data.<br>
[05] Thus, in one aspect the invention is directed to systems, methods and<br>
techniques for encoding an audio signal. A sampled audio signal, divided into frames, is<br>
obtained. The location of a transient within one of the frames is identified, and transform<br>
data samples are generated by performing multi-resolution filter bank analysis on the<br><br>
frame data, including filtering at different resolutions for different portions of the firame<br>
that includes the transient. Quantization data are generated by quantizing the transform<br>
data samples using variable numbers of bits based on a psychoacoustical model, and the<br>
quantization data are grouped into variable-length segments based on magnitudes of the<br>
quantization data. A code book is assigned to each of the variable-length segments, and<br>
the quantization data in each of the variable-length segments are encoded using the code<br>
book assigned to such variable-length segment.<br>
[06] By virtue of the foregoing arrangement, it often is possible to<br>
simultaneously achieve more accurate encoding of audio data while representing such<br>
data using a fewer number of bits.<br>
[07J The foregoing summary is intended merely to provide a brief description<br>
of certain aspects of the invention. A more complete understanding of the invention can<br>
be obtained by referring to the claims and the following detailed description of the<br>
preferred embodiments in connection with the accompanying figures.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMB0D1MENT(S)<br>
[14] The present invention pertains to systems, methods and techniques for<br>
encoding audio signals, e.g., for subsequent storage or transmission. Applications in<br>
which the present invention may be used include, but are not limited to: digital audio<br>
broadcasting, digital television (satellite, terrestrial and/or cable broadcasting), home<br>
theatre, digital theatre, laser video disc player, content streaming on the Internet and<br>
personal audio players.<br>
[15] Figure 1 is a block diagram of an audio signal encoding system 10<br>
according to a representative embodiment of the present invention. In a representative<br>
sub-embodiment, the individual sections or components illustrated in Figure 1 are<br>
implemented entirely in computer-executable code, as described below. However, in<br>
alternate embodiments any or all of such sections or components may be implemented in<br>
any of the other ways discussed herein.<br>
[16] Initially, pulse-coded modulation (PCM) signals 12, corresponding to<br>
time samples of an original audio signal, are input into frame segmentation section 14.<br>
In this regard, the original audio signal typically will consist of multiple channels, e.g.,<br>
left and right channels for ordinary stereo, or 5-7 normal channels and one low-frequency<br>
effect (LFE) channel for surround sound. A LFE channel typically has limited<br>
bandvridth (e.g., less than 120 Hz) and volume that is higher than a normal channel.<br>
Throughout this description, a given channel configuration is represented as x.y, where x<br>
represents the number of normal chaimels and y represents the number of LFE channels.<br>
Thus, ordinary stereo would be represented in its 2.0 and typical conventional surround<br>
sound would be represented as 5.1, 6.1 or 7.1.<br>
[17] The preferred embodiments of the present invention support chaimel<br>
configurations of up to 64.3 and sample frequencies from 8 kiloHertz (kHz) to 192 kHz,<br>
including 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz, with a precision of at least 24 bits. Generally speaking,<br>
each channel is processed independently of the others, except as otherwise noted herein.<br>
[18] The PCM signals 12 may be input into system 10 from an external source<br>
or instead may be generated internally by system 10, e.g., by sampling an original audio<br>
signal.<br>
[19] In frame segmentation section 14, the PCM samples 12 for each channel<br>
are divided into a sequence of contiguous frames in the time domain. In this regard, a<br>
frame is considered to be a base data unit for processing purposes in the techniques of<br><br>
the present invention. Preferably, each such frame has a fixed number of samples,<br>
selected from a relatively small set of frame sizes, with the selected frame size for any<br>
particular time interval depending, e.g., upon the sampling rate and the amount of delay<br>
that can be tolerated between frames. More preferably, each frame includes 128,256,<br>
512 or 1,024 samples, with longer frames being preferred except in situations where<br>
reduction of delay is important. In most of the examples discussed below, it is assumed<br>
that each frame consists of 1,024 samples. However, such examples should not be taken<br>
as limiting.<br>
[20] Each frame of data samples output from frame segmentation section 14 is<br>
input into transient analysis section 16, which determines whether the input frame of<br>
PCM samples contains a signal transient, which preferably is defmed as a sudden and<br>
quick rise (attack) or fall of signal energy. Based on such detection, each frame is then<br>
classified as a transient frame (i.e. one that includes a transient) or a quasistationary<br>
frame (i.e., one that does not include a transient). In addition, transient analysis section<br>
16 identifies the location and duration of each transient signal, and then uses that<br>
information to identify "transient segments". Any known transient-detection method can<br>
be employed, including any of the transient-detection techniques described in the '722<br>
Application.<br>
[21] The terra "transient segment", as used herein, refers to a portion of a<br>
signal that has the same or similar statistical properties. Thus, a quasistationary frame<br>
generally consists of a single transient segment, while a transient frame ordinarily will<br>
consist of two or three transient segments. For example, if only an attack or fall of a<br>
transient occurs in a firame, then the transient frame generally will have two transient<br>
segments: one covering the portion of the firame before the attack or fall and another<br>
covering the portion of the frame after the attack or fall. If both an attack and fall occur<br>
in a transient firame, then three transient segments generally will exist, each one covering<br>
the portion of the frame as segmented by the attack and fall, respectively. The frame-<br>
based data and the transient-detection information are then provided to filter bank 18.<br>
[22] The variable-resolution analysis filter bank 18 decomposes the audio<br>
PCM samples of each channel audio into subband signals, with the nature of the subband<br>
depending upon the transform technique that is used. In this regard, although any of a<br>
variety of different transform techniques may be used by filter bank 18, in the preferred<br>
embodiments the transform is unitaiy and sinusoidal-based. More preferably, filter bank<br>
18 uses the discrete cosine transform (DCT) or the modified discrete cosine transform<br><br>
(MDCT), as described in more detail in the '722 Application. In most of the examples<br>
described herein, it is assumed that MDCT is used. Accordingly, in the preferred<br>
embodiments, the subband signals constitute, for each MDCT block, a number of<br>
subband samples, each corresponding to a different frequency of subband; in addition,<br>
due to the unitary nature of the transform, the number of subband samples is equal to the<br>
number of time-domain samples that were processed by the MDCT.<br>
[23] In addition, in the preferred embodiments the time-frequency resolution<br>
of the filter bank 18 is controlled based on the transient detection results received from<br>
transient analysis section 16. More preferably, filter bank 18 uses the techniques<br>
described in the '917 Application.<br>
[24] Generally speaking, that technique uses a single long transform block to<br>
cover each quasistationary frame and multiple identical shorter transform blocks to cover<br>
each transient frame. In a representative example, the frame size is 1,024 samples, each<br>
quasistationary frame is considered to consist of a single primary block (of 1,024<br>
samples), and each transient frame is considered to consist of eight primary blocks<br>
(having 128 samples each). In order to avoid boundary effects, the MDCT block is<br>
larger than the primary block and, more preferably, twice the size of the primary block,<br>
so the long MDCT block consists of 2,048 samples and the short MDCT block consists<br>
of 256 samples.<br>
[25] Prior to applying the MDCT, a window function is applied to each MDCT<br>
block for the purpose of shaping the frequency responses of the individual filters.<br>
Because only a single long MDCT block is used for the quasistationary frames, a single<br>
window function is used, although its particular shape preferably depends upon the<br>
window functions used in adjacent frames, so as to satisfy the perfect reconstruction<br>
requirements. On the other hand, unlike conventional techniques, the techniques of the<br>
preferred embodiments use different window functions within a single transient frame.<br>
More preferably, such window functions are selected so as to provide at least two levels<br>
of resolution within the transient frame, while using a single transform (e.g., MDCT)<br>
block size within the frame.<br>
[261 As a result, e.g., a higher time-domain resolution (at the cost of lower<br>
frequency-domain resolution) can be achieved in the vicinity of the transient signal, and<br>
a higher frequency-domain resolution (at the cost of lower time-domain resolution) can<br>
be achieved in other (i.e., more stationary) portions of the transient frame. Moreover, by<br><br>
holding transfonn block size constant, the foregoing advantages generally can be<br>
achieved without complicating the processing structure.<br>
[27] In the preferred embodiments, in addition to conventional window<br>
functions, the following new "brief window function WIN_SHORT_BRIEF2BRIEF is<br>
introduced:<br><br>
where S is the short primary block size (e.g., 128 samples) and B is the brief block size<br>
{e.g., 5=32). As discussed in more detail in the '917 Application, additional transition<br>
window functions preferably also are used in order to satisfy the perfect reconstruction<br>
requirements.<br>
[28] It is noted that other specific forms of "brief window functions instead<br>
may be used, as also discussed in more detiul in the '917 Application. However, in the<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention, the "brief window function used has more of<br>
its energy concentrated in a smaller portion of the transform block, as compared with<br>
other window functions used in the other (e.g., more stationary) portions of the transient<br>
frame. In fact, in certain embodiments, a number of the function values are 0, thereby<br>
preserving the central, or primary block of, sample values.<br>
[29] In recombination crossover section 20, the subband samples for the<br>
current frame of the current channel preferably are rearranged so as to group together<br>
samples within the same transient segment that correspond to the same subband. In a<br>
frame with a long MDCT (i.e., a quasistationary frame), subband samples already are<br>
arranged in frequency ascending order, e.g., from subband 0 to subband 1023. Because<br>
subband samples of the MDCT are arranged in the natural order, the recombination<br>
crossover is not applied in frames with a long MDCT.<br>
[30] However, when a frame is made up of nNumBlocksPerFrm short MDCT<br>
blocks (i.e., a transient frame), the subband samples for each short MDCT are arranged<br>
in frequency-ascending order, e.g., from subband 0 to subband 127. The groups of such<br><br>
subband samples, in turn, are arranged in time order, thereby forming the natural order of<br>
subband samples from 0 to 1023.<br>
(31) In recombination crossover section 20, recombination crossover is applied<br>
to these subband samples, by arranging samples with the same frequency in each<br>
transient segment together and then arranging them in frequency-ascending order. The<br>
result often is to reduce the number of bits required for transmission.<br>
[32] An example of the natural order for frame having three transient segments<br>
and eight short MDCT blocks is as follows:<br><br>
Once again, the linear sequence for the subband samples in the natural order is<br>
[0...1023]. The corresponding data arrangement after application of recombination<br>
crossover is as follows:<br><br><br>
The linear sequence for the subband samples in the recombination crossover order is [0,<br>
2,4,..., 254,1, 3, 5,..., 255,256, 259, 302,.... 637,...].<br>
(33] As used herein, the "critical band" refers to the frequency resolution of<br>
the human ear, i.e., the bandwidth Z/ within which the human ear is not capable of<br>
distinguishing different frequencies. The bandwidth isf rises along with the frequency<br>
/, with the relationship between f mA bf being approximately exponential. Each<br>
critical band can be represented as a number of adjacent subband samples of the filter<br>
bank. For example, the critical bands for a short (128-sample) MDCT typically range<br>
from 4 subband samples in width at the lowest frequencies to 42 subband samples in<br>
width at the highest frequencies.<br>
134] Psychoacoustical model 32 provides the noise-masking thresholds of the<br>
human ear. The basic concept underlying psychoacoustical model 32 is that there are<br>
thresholds in the human auditory system. Below these values (masking thresholds),<br>
audio signals cannot be heard. As a result, it is unnecessary to transmit this part of the<br>
information to the decoder. The purpose of psychoacoustical model 32 is to provide<br>
these threshold values.<br><br>
[35] Existing general psychoacoustical models can be used, such as the two<br>
psychoacoustical models from MPGE. In the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, psychoacoustical model 32 outputs a masking threshold for each quantization<br>
unit (as defined below).<br>
[36] Optional sum/difference encoder 22 uses a particular joint channel<br>
encoding technique. Preferably, encoder 22 transforms subband samples of the lefl/right<br>
channel pair mto a sum/difference channel pair as follows:<br>
Sum channel = 0.5 * (left channel + right channel ); and<br>
Difference channel = 0.5 * (left channel - right channel).<br>
[37] Accordingly, during decoding, the reconstruction of the subband samples<br>
in the left/right channel is as follows:<br>
Left channel = sum channel + difference channel; and<br>
Right channel = sum channel - difference channel.<br>
[38] Optional joint intensity encoder 24 encodes high-frequency components<br>
in a joint channel by using the acoustic image localization characteristic of the human ear<br>
at high frequency. The psychoacoustical model indicates that the sensation of the human<br>
ear to the spatial acoustic image at high frequency is mostly defined by the relative<br>
strength of the left/right audio signals and less defined by the respective frequency<br>
components. This is the theoretic foundation of joint intensity encoding. The following is<br>
a simple technique for joint intensity encoding.<br>
[39] For two or more channels to be combined, corresponding subband<br>
samples are added across channels and the totals replace the subband samples in one of<br>
the original source channels (e.g., the left channel), referred to as the joint subband<br>
samples. Then, for each quantization unit, the power is adjusted so as to match the<br>
power of such original source channel, retaining a scaling factor for each quantization<br>
unit of each channel. Finally, only the power-adjusted joint subband samples and the<br>
scaling factors for the quantization units in each channel are retained and transmitted.<br>
For example, if Es is the power of joint quantization unit in the source channel, and £y is<br>
the power of joint quantization unit in joint channel, then the scale factor can be<br>
calculated as follows:<br><br><br>
[40] Global bit allocation section 34 assigns a number of bits to each<br>
quantization unit. In this regard, a "quantization unit" preferably consists of a rectangle<br>
of subband samples bounded by the critical band in the frequency domain and by the<br>
transient segment in the time domain. All subband samples in this rectangle belong to the<br>
same quantization unit.<br>
[41] Serial numbers of these samples can be different, e.g., because in the<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention there are two types of subband sample arranging<br>
orders (i.e., natural order and crossover order), but they preferably represent subband<br>
samples of the same group nevertheless. In one example, the first quantization unit is<br>
made up of subband samples 0, 1,2,3,128, 129,130, and 131. However, the subband<br>
samples' serial numbers of the first quantization unit become 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7.<br>
The two groups of different serial numbers represent the same subband samples.<br>
[42J In order to reduce the quantization noise power to a value that is lower<br>
than each masking threshold value, global bit allocation section 34 distributes all of the<br>
available bits for each frame among the quantization units in the frame. Preferably,<br>
quantization noise power of each quantization unit and the number of bits assigned to it<br>
are controlled by adjusting the quantization step size of the quantization unit.<br>
[43] Any of the variety of existing bit-allocation techniques may be used,<br>
including, e.g., water filling. In the water filling technique, (1) the quantization unit with<br>
the maximum NMR(Noise to Mask Ratio) is identified; (2) the quantization step size<br>
assigned to this quantization unit is reduced, thereby reducing quantization noise; and<br>
then (3) the foregoing two steps are repeated above until the NMRs of all quantization<br>
units are less than 1 (or other threshold set in advance), or until the bits which are<br>
allowed in the current frame are exhausted.<br>
[44] Quantization section 26 quantizes the subband samples, preferably by<br>
quantizing the samples in each quantization unit in a straightforward manner using a<br>
uniform quantization step size provided by global bit allocator 34, as described above.<br>
However, any other quantization technique instead may be used, with corresponding<br>
adjustments to global bit allocation section 34.<br>
[45] Code book selector 36 groups or segments the quantization indexes by the<br>
local statistical characteristic of such quantization indexes, and selects a code book from<br>
the code book library to assign to each such group of quantization indexes. In the<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention, the segmenting and code-book selection occur<br>
substantially simultaneously.<br><br>
[46] In the preferred embodiments of the invention, quantization index encoder<br>
28 (discussed in additional detail below) perfomis Huffman encoding on the quantization<br>
indexes by using the code book selected by code book selector 36 for each respective<br>
segment. More preferably, Huffinan encoding is performed on the subband sample<br>
quantization indexes in each channel. Still more preferably, two groups of code books<br>
(one for quasistationary frames and one for transient frames, respectively) are used to<br>
perform Huffman encoding on the subband sample quantization indexes, with each<br>
group of code books being made up of 9 Huffinan code books. Accordingly, the<br>
preferred embodiments up to 9 Huffinan code books can be used to perform encoding on<br>
the quantization indexes for a given frame. The properties of such code books preferably<br>
are as follows:<br><br>
(47| Other types of the entropy coding (such as arithmetic code) are performed<br>
in alternate embodiments of the invention. However, in the present examples it is<br>
assumed that Huffinan encoding is used. As used herein, "Huffinan" encoding is<br>
intended to encompass any prefix binaiy code that uses assumed symbol probabilities to<br>
express more common source symbols using shorter strings of bits than are used for less<br>
common source symbols, irrespective of whether or not the coding technique is identical<br>
to the original Huffman algorithm.<br><br>
[48] In view of the anticipated encoding to be performed by quantization index<br>
encoder 28, the goal of code book selector 36 in the preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention is to select segments of classification indexes in each channel and to determine<br>
which code book to apply to each segment. The first step is to identiiy which group of<br>
code books to use based on the frame type (quasistationaiy or transient) identified by<br>
transient analysis section 16. Then, the specific code books and segments preferably are<br>
selected in the following manner.<br>
[49] In conventional audio signal processing algorithms, the application range<br>
of an entropy code book is the same as the quantization unit, so the entropy code book is<br>
defined by the maximum quantization index in the quantization unit. Thus, there is no<br>
potential for further optimization.<br>
[50] In contrast, in the preferred embodiments of the present invention code<br>
book selection ignores the quantization unit boundaries, and instead simultaneously<br>
selects an appropriate code book and the segment to which it is to apply. More<br>
preferably, quantization indexes are divided into segments by their local statistical<br>
properties. The application range of the code book is defined by the edges of these<br>
segments. An example of a technique for identifying code book segments and<br>
corresponding code books is described with reference to the flow diagram shown in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
[51] Initially, in step 82 initial sets of code book segments and corresponding<br>
code books are selected. This step may be performed in a variety of different ways, e.g.,<br>
by using clustering techniques or by simply grouping together quantization indexes<br>
within a continuous interval that can only be accommodated by a code book of a given<br>
size. In this latter regard, among the group of applicable code books (e.g., nine different<br>
code books), the main difference is the maximum quantization index that can be<br>
accommodated. Accordingly, code book selection primarily involves selecting a code<br>
book that can accommodate the magnitudes of all of the quantization indexes under<br>
consideration. Accordingly, one approach to step 82 is to start with the smallest code<br>
book that will accommodate the fust quantization index and then keep using it until a<br>
larger code book is required or until a smaller one can be used.<br>
[52] In any event, the result of this step 82 is to provide an initial sequence of<br>
code book segments and corresponding code books. One example includes segments<br>
101-113 shown in Figure 3. Here, each code segment 101-103 has a length indicated by<br>
its horizontal length in an assigned code book represented by its vertical height.<br><br>
[53] Next, in step 83 code book segments are combined as necessary or<br>
desirable, again, preferably based on the magnitudes of the quantization indexes. In this<br>
regard, because the code book segments preferably can have arbitrary boundaries, the<br>
locations of those boundaries typically must be transmitted to the decoder. Accordingly,<br>
if the number of the code book segments is too great after step 82, it is preferable to<br>
eliminate some of the small code book segments until a specified criterion 85 is satisfied.<br>
[54] In the preferred embodiments, the elimination method is to combine small<br>
code book segments (e.g., the shortest code book segments) with the code book segment<br>
having the smallest code book index (corresponding to the smallest code book) to the left<br>
and right sides of the code book segment under consideration. Figure 4 provides an<br>
example of the result of applying this step 83 to the code book segmentation showm in<br>
Figure 3. In this case, segment 102 has been combined with segments 101 and 103<br>
(which use the same code book) to provide segment 121, segments 104 and 106 have<br>
been combined with segment 105 to provide segment 122, segments 110 and 111 have<br>
been combined with segment 109 to provide segment 125, and segment 113 has been<br>
combined with segment 112 to provide segment 126. If the code book index equals 0<br>
(e.g. for segment 108), no quantization index is required to be transmitted, so such<br>
isolated code book segments preferably are not rejected. Accordingly, in the present<br>
example code book segment 108 is not rejected.<br>
[55] As shown m Figure 2, step 83 preferably is repeatedly applied until the<br>
end criterion 85 has been satisfied. Depending upon the particular embodiment, the end<br>
criterion might include, e.g., that the total number of segments does not exceed a<br>
specified maximum, that each segment has a minimum length and/or that the total<br>
number of code books referenced does not exceed a specified maximum. In this iterative<br>
process, the selection of the next segment to eliminate may be made based upon a variety<br>
of different criterion, e.g., the shortest existing segment, the segment whose code book<br>
index could be increased by the smallest amount, the smallest projected increase in the<br>
number of bits, or the overall net benefit to be obtained (e.g., as a function of the<br>
segment's length and the required increase in its code book index).<br>
[56] Advantages of this technique can be appreciated when comparing a<br>
conventional segmentation, as illustrated in Figure 5, with a segmentation according to<br>
the present invention, as shown in Figure 6. In Figure 5, the quantization indexes have<br>
been divided into four quantization segments 151-154, having corresponding right-side<br>
boudaries 161-163- In accordance with the conventional approach, the quantization<br><br>
segments 151 -154 correspond directly to the quantization units. In this example, the<br>
maximum quantization index 171 belongs to quantization unit 154. Accordingly, a large<br>
code book (e.g., code book c) must be selected for quantization unit 154. It is not a wise<br>
choice, because most of quantization indexes of quantization unit 154 are small.<br>
[57] In contrast, when the technique of the present convention is applied, the<br>
same quantization indexes are segmented into code book segments 181-184 using the<br>
technique described above. As a result, the maximum quantization index 171 is grouped<br>
with the quantization indexes in code book segment 183 (which already would have been<br>
assigned code book segment c based on the magnitudes of the other quantization indexes<br>
within it). Although this quantization index 171 still requires a code book of the same<br>
size (e.g., code book c), it shares this code book with other large quantization indexes.<br>
That is, this large code book is matched to the statistical properties of the quantization<br>
indexes in this code book segment) 83. Moreover, because all of the quantization<br>
indexes within code book segment 184 are small, then a smaller code book (e.g., code<br>
book a) is selected for it, i.e., matching the code book with the statistical properties of<br>
quantization indexes in it. As will be readily appreciated, the technique of code book<br>
selection often can reduce the number of bits used to transmit quantization indexes.<br>
[58] As noted above, however, there is some "extra cost" associated with using<br>
this technique. Conventional techniques generally only require transmitting the side<br>
information of codebook indexes to the decoder, because their application range is the<br>
same as the quantization unit. However, the present technique generally requires not only<br>
transmitting the side information of codebook indexes, but also transmitting the<br>
application range to the decoder, because the application range and the quantization units<br>
typically are independent. In order to address this problem, in certain embodiments the<br>
present technique defaults to the conventional approach (i.e., simply using the<br>
quantization units as of the quantization segments) if such "extra cost" cannot be<br>
compensated, which is expected to occur only rarely, if at all. As noted above, one<br>
approach to addressing this problem is to divide into code book segments that are as<br>
large as possible under the condition of the statistical property allowed.<br>
[59] Upon completion of the processing by code book selector 36, the number<br>
of segments, length (application range for each code book) of each segment, and the<br>
selected code book index for each segment preferably are provided to multiplexer 45 for<br>
inclusion within the bit stream.<br><br>
[60] Quantization index encoder 28 performs compression encoding on the<br>
quantization indexes using the segments and corresponding code books selected by code<br>
book selector 36, The maximum quantization index, i.e., 255, in code book<br>
Huffdec l8_256x1 and in code book Huffdec27_256x1 (corresponding to code book<br>
index 9) represents ESCAPE. Because the quantization indexes potentially can exceed<br>
the maximum range of the two code table, such larger indexes are encoded using<br>
recursive encoding, with q being represented as:<br>
q = m*255 + /-<br>
where m is the quotient of q and r is the remainder of q. The remainder r is encoded<br>
using the Huffman code book corresponding to code book index 9, while the quotient q<br>
is packaged into the bit stream directly. Huffman code books preferably are used to<br>
perform encoding on the number of bits used for packaging tive quotient q.<br>
[61] Because code book Huffdec18_256x1 and code hook Huffdec27_256x1<br>
are not midtread, when the absolute values are transmitted, an additional bit is<br>
transmitted for representing the sign. Because the code books corresponding to code<br>
book indexes 1 through 8 are midtread, the offset is added to reconstruct the quantization<br>
index sign after Huffinan decoding.<br>
[62] Multipiexer 45 packages all the Huffinan codes, together with all<br>
additional information mentioned above and any user-defined auxiliary information into<br>
a single bit stream 60. In addition, an error code preferably is inserted for the cunrent<br>
frame of audio data. More preferably, after the encoder 10 packages all of the audio<br>
data, all of idle bits in the last word (32 bits) are set to 1. At the decoder side, if all of the<br>
idle bits do not equal 1, then an error is declared in the current frame and an error<br>
handling procedure is initiated.<br>
[63] In the preferred embodiments of the invention, because the auxiliary data<br>
are located behind the error-detection code, the decoder can stop and wait for the next<br>
audio frame after finishing code error detection. In other words, the auxiliary data have<br>
no effect on the decoding and need not be dealt with by decoder. As a result, the<br>
definition and the understanding of the auxiliary data can be determined entirely by the<br>
users, thereby giving the users a significant amount of flexibility.<br>
[64] The output structure for each frame preferably is as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
