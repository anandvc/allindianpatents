				<td>BOWED COMPRESSOR AIRFOIL<br>
The US Government may have certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. N00019-96-C-0176 awarded by the US Department of the Navy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more specifically, to compressors or fans therein.<br>
In a turbofan aircraft gas turbine engine, air is pressurized in a fan and compressor during operation. The fan air is used for propelling an aircraft in flight. The air channeled through the compressor is mixed with fuel in a combustor and ignited for generated hot combustion gases which flow through turbine stages that extract energy therefrom for powering the fan and compressor.<br>
A typical turbofan engine includes a multistage axial flow compressor which pressurizes the air sequentially to produce high pressure air for combustion. Fundamental in compressor design is efficiency in compressing the air with sufficient stall margin over the entire flight envelope of operation from takeoff, cruise, and landing.<br>
However, compressor efficiency and stall margin are normally inversely related with increasing efficiency typically corresponding with decrease in stall margin. The conflicting requirements of stall margin and efficiency are particularly demanding in high performance military engine applications which require high level of stall margin in conjunction with high compressor efficiency.<br>
Maximizing efficiency of compressor airfoils is primarily effected by<br><br>
optimizing the velocity distributions over the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil. However, efficiency is typically limited in conventional compressor design by the requirement for a suitable stall margin. Any further increase in efficiency results in a reduction in stall margin, and, conversely, further increase in stall margin results in decrease in efficiency.<br>
High efficiency is typically obtained by minimizing the wetted surface area of the airfoils for a given stage to correspondingly reduce airfoil drag. This is typically achieved by reducing airfoil solidity or the density of airfoils around the circumference of a rotor disk, or by increasing airfoil aspect ratio of the chord to span lengths.<br>
For a given rotor speed, this increase in efficiency reduces stall margin. To achieve high levels of stall margin, a higher than optimum level of solidity may be used, along with designing the airfoils at below optimum incidence angles.  This reduces axial flow compressor efficiency.<br>
Increased stall margin may also be obtained by increasing rotor speed, but this in turn reduces efficiency by increasing the airfoil Mach numbers, which increases airfoil drag.<br>
Accordingly, typical compressor designs necessarily include a compromise between efficiency and stall margin favoring one over the other.<br>
It is, therefore, desired to further improve both compressor efficiency and stall margin together for improving gas turbine engine compressor performance.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A compressor airfoil includes pressure and suction sides extending from root to tip and between leading and trailing edges.   Transverse sections have<br><br>
respective chords and camber lines. Centers of gravity of the sections are aligned along a bowed stacking axis either tangentially, axially, or both, for improving performance.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention, in accordance with preferred and exemplary embodiments, together with further objects and advantages thereof, is more particularly described in the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is an isometric view of a portion of a gas turbine engine compressor rotor stage having bowed airfoils extending radially outwardly from an integral rotor disk in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a forward-facing isometric view of one of the airfoils illustrated in Figure 1 and taken generally along line 2-2 in a tangential and radial plane.<br>
Figure 3 is a side elevation view of one of the airfoils illustrated in Figure 1 and taken generally along line 3-3 circumferentially projected in an axial and radial plane.<br>
Figure 4 is a radial transverse section through an exemplary portion of the airfoil illustrated in Figure 3 and taken along line 4-4.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Illustrated in Figure 1 is a portion of an annular rotor blisk 10 defining one stage of a multistage axial flow compressor for a gas turbine engine. The blisk Includes, a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart rotor blades or airfoils 12 extending radially outwardly from the perimeter of an integral rotor disk 14 forming a one-piece unitary assembly. The blisk may be manufactured using conventional milling and electrochemical machining.<br>
Alternatively, the airfoils may be formed with integral dovetails for being removably mounted in corresponding dovetail slots in the perimeter of discrete rotor disk in another conventional configuration.<br>
During operation, the blisk rotates in the exemplary clockwise direction illustrated in Figure 1 for pressurizing air 16 as it flows between the adjacent airfoils. The airfoils are aerodynamically configured in profile for maximizing the efficiency of air compression while also providing a suitably high stall margin for enhancing performance of the compressor. The blisk 10 illustrated in Figure 1 is only one of several stages of rotor airfoils which may be configured in accordance with the present invention for enhancing compressor performance by increasing together both efficiency and stall margin.<br>
Notwithstanding the conventional compromise made between aerodynamic efficiency and stall margin, modern computer software is conventionally available for solving three-dimensional (3D) viscous flow equations for evaluating airfoil performance. The resulting airfoils generally have distinctive 3D configurations which differ significantly over conventional airfoils which vary little in radial section over the spans thereof.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a specifically bowed airfoil 12 uncovered from 3D analysis having improved performance for increasing both efficiency and stall margin not previously possible.<br>
The rotor disk 14 has three orthogonal axes including axial X, tangential or circumferential Y, and radial Z. The axial axis X extends in the downstream<br><br>
direction relative to the flow of air 16 through the compressor. The tangential axis Y extends in the direction of rotation of the disk and airfoils. And, the radial axis Z extends radially outwardly from the perimeter of the disk for each of the airfoils thereon.<br>
Each airfoil 12 includes a generally concave pressure side 18 and a generally convex suction side 20 extending radially or longitudinally from a root or hub 22 integrally joined with the perimeter of the disk to a radially outer tip 24. The two sides extend chordally or axially between leading and trailing edges 26,28 from root to tip.<br>
In accordance with one feature of the present invention, the airfoil suction side 20 is laterally or tangentially bowed along the trailing edge, 28 near or adjacent the root 22 at the intersection with the disk perimeter. Flow separation of the air at this location may be substantially reduced or eliminated for both increasing blade efficiency and improving stall margin.<br>
The suction side trailing edge is bowed primarily only in the tangential direction as illustrated in Figure 2. In the side projection of the axial and radial plane X-Z illustrated in Figure 3, the suction side bow is imperceptible. However,, the airfoil may also be axially bowed as illustrated in Figure 3 for further improvements in performance as later discussed hereinbelow.<br>
The airfoil illustrated in Figures 1-3 is defined by a plurality of radially or longitudinally stacked transverse sections, one of which is illustrated in Figure 4. Each section has an aerodynamic profile defined by respective portions of the pressure and suction sides 18,20 extending between the leading and trailing edges 26,28. Each profile is defined by a straight chord 30 extending axially between the leading and trailing edges, and an arcuate camber line 32 which is a meanline spaced equidistantly between the pressure and suction sides from leading to trailing edge. The camber line 32 has a camber angle A relative to the axial axis X which varies between the leading and trailing edges, and is typically generally parallel with the incident air 16 at the airfoil leading edge.<br><br>
Each airfoil section also has a center of gravity 34 which is aligned radially along the longitudinal span of the airfoil in a bowed stacking axis 36 as illustrated in Figure 1. The stacking axis 36 in conjunction with the shapes of the corresponding airfoil sections including their chords 30 and camber lines 32 permit 3D definition of the airfoil for enhanced performance in accordance with the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the stacking axis 36 illustrated in Figure 1 has two orthogonal components including a tangential stacking axis 36a illustrated in Figure 2 and an axial stacking axis 36b illustrated in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 2, the tangential stacking axis 36a is non-linear or bowed adjacent the airfoil root 22 to bow the suction side 20 of the airfoil near the trailing edge root or hub.<br>
The tangential stacking axis 36a initially leans onward or in the forward direction of rotation of the airfoils and disk from the root 22 toward the pressure side 18 of the airfoil. The axis 36a then leans hindward or backward, which is opposite to the direction of rotation of the airfoils and disk, toward the suction side 20 adjacent the tip 24. Correspondingly, camber of the airfoil transverse sections adjacent the root varies in turn to bow the suction side thereat.<br>
The bow of the tangential stacking axis 36a and the corresponding shapes of the transverse sections are selected for substantially reducing or eliminating flow separation of the air along the suction side near the airfoil hub at the trailing edge.<br>
The* bowed stacking axis permits the trailing edge 28 as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 to be oriented substantially normal to the root of the bowed suction side 20 and leans hindward thereabove. The trailing edge 28 intersects the perimeter or platform of the rotor disk at an intersection angle B which would otherwise be significantly acute without the trailing edge bow. Computer analysis indicates that acute trailing edge intersection angles promote hub flow separation which decreases efficiency of the airfoil. The suction side<br><br>
bow reduces the acuteness of the intersection angle B for correspondingly reducing flow separation, with an attendant increase in efficiency. The bowed stacking axis permits centrifugal loads developed during operation to slightly straighten the airfoil and introduce local compressive bending stress which locally offsets centrifugal tensile stress.<br>
Accordingly, the preferentially bowed airfoil reduces flow separation at the hub, and is limited only by the degree of stacking axis bow which may be introduced with acceptable bending stresses during operation. Improved hub airflow increases airfoil efficiency without compromising stall margin.<br>
Aerodynamic sweep is a conventional parameter for evaluating performance of a compressor airfoil. In accordance with another feature of the present invention, means are provided for limiting aft aerodynamic sweep of the airfoil 12 between the leading and trailing edges. Aft sweep can adversely affect stall margin, and selectively limiting aft sweep can enhance the stall margin.<br>
Aft sweep of the airfoil 12 illustrated in Figure 3 may be limited by selectively bowing the axial stacking axis 36b, and also by selectively varying the chord distributions of the transverse sections.<br>
For example, aft sweep may be limited by configuring the airfoil leading edge 26 to have an axially coplanar radially outer or outboard portion which includes the tip 24. And, the remaining radially inner or inboard portion of the leading edge 26 is inclined axially forwardly to the root 22 from the outboard portion.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an axial projection of the airfoil 12 from its suction side 20 and shows a straight leading edge outboard portion which is preferably positioned at a constant axial location. The inboard portion of the leading edge 26 leans forward as the airfoil root is approached relative to the radial line illustrated in phantom. Aerodynamic aft sweep of the airfoil is thusly limited at the leading edge from the root to the tip of the airfoil.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, the outboard and inboard portions of the leading edge 26 intersect or transition from each other at about the midspan of the airfoil. In a preferred embodiment the midspan transition is within the range of about 40% span height to about 60% span height. Both airfoil efficiency and stall margin may further be increased by this preferred leading edge configuration.<br>
Aft aerodynamic sweep may be further limited by preferentially configuring the airfoil trailing edge 28 as illustrated in Figure 3. The axial stacking axis 36b in conjunction with corresponding chord lengths may be used to control trailing edge configuration. In a preferred embodiment illustrated in Figure 3, the trailing edge 28 has an axially coplanar inboard portion including the root 22, and an outboard portion inclined axially forwardly to the tip 24 from the inboard portion.<br>
The inboard and outboard portions of the trailing edge 28 intersect or transition from each other radially inwardly between the midspan of the airfoil and the root 22. In a preferred embodiment, this trailing edge inboard transition is within the range of about 15% span height to about 25% span height. The trailing edge configuration is thusly defined by holding a constant axial position of the trailing edge from the root 22 over the minority inboard portion of the span height, at which the majority outboard portion of the trailing edge projects or is inclined forwardly towards the tip 24 relative to the radial line illustrated in phantom. Again, aft aerodynamic sweep is limited for correspondingly increasing airfoil efficiency and stall margin.<br>
.<br>
Since the stacking axis includes both tangential and axial components, the tangential component may be used to advantage to introduce the bowed suction side 20 near the trailing edge at the root as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 for the advantages described above. Correspondingly, the axial component of the stacking axis may be selected for limiting the aft sweep along both the leading and trailing edges 26,28 as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
And, quite significantly, the axial contour of the airfoil cooperates with<br>
8<br><br>
the tangential contour for yet further reducing or eliminating flow separation.<br>
The stacking axis is configured in conjunction with the shapes of the individual transverse sections of the airfoil including the distribution in length of the chords 30 and the camber of the camber lines 32. And, the specific configuration of the stacking axis may also be controlled for limiting centrifugally generated bending stresses in the airfoil within acceptable limits.<br>
Accordingly, the two components of the stacking axis and the shape of the airfoil transverse sections may be additionally configured based on 3D viscous flow analysis to increase both airfoil efficiency and stall margin resulting in the distinctive 3D configuration illustrated in the figures.<br>
The degree of suction side bow and limitation of aft sweep along the leading and trailing edges may be adjusted in different combinations for different airfoil configurations to vary the benefits of increased airfoil efficiency and corresponding stall margin. The resulting airfoil 12 may thusly be designed for truly three dimensional performance attributable to modern advances in computational analysis which makes such improvements possible.<br>
