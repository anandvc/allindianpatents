The present invention also refers to a process of preparation of these general formula I compounds, and the pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and especially their use as medicine for treatment or prevention or inhibition of malaria or other parasitic diseases such as: kaodzera, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, amoebiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, as well as other helminthiases, Moreover, the present invention provides a method of treatment, prevention or inhibition of malaria or other parasitic diseases, including the use of a therapeutical effective amount of a general formula I compound for the human being, who needs the referred treatment, prevention or inhibition, BACKGROUNG OF THE INVENTION<br>
Malaria, also called maleita, palustre fever, impaludism, terca fever or sezao, is a parasitic disease that, according to data from World Health Organization,<br><br>
affects about 300 million people in the world- It is considered to be, besides Aids, a world health problem. Malaria causes approximatelly 1 to 1.5 million deaths a year. It is one of the most important health problems nowadays, since its transmission occurs in almost 100 countries, in tropical and subtropical regions, inhabited by more than one third of the world population.<br>
The distribution of the risk of malaria acquisition is not uniform within the same country and it is often unequal in areas situated in the same region, in addition, it is variable according to the seasons of the year and as time passes. In general, the risk is high in Africa (sub-Saharian area), South America (Amazon basin), Irian Jaia, Madagascar, Papua New Guine, Southeast Asia and Vanuatu. It is sort of low in Afghanistan (East), Central America, South America (except in the Amazon basin) , North America (rural areas of Mexico), China (north), Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, South Iraq, Middle East, Paquistan and Arabian peninsula (southeast). In Africa there are 90% of the cases of malaria, affecting, most of all, children under five years old, especially those who live in distant rural areas with little health assistance available. Malaria is endemic in Brazil where, annually, more than 400 thousand infected people are registered, the majority in the Amazon region.<br>
Malaria is caused by a protozoan genus Plasmodium, which has about 100 species. Among these species only four of them affect humans, P. vivax, responsible for 80% of the current cases in Brazil, P. malariae which hardly ever<br><br>
occurs, P- falciparum responsible for a lethal and serious malaria if not rapidly and correctly treated, and P. ovaler not present in Brazil. Malaria is transmitted to mammals by insects: orrder Diptera, family Culicidae, and genus Anopheles. This genus comprehends about 400 species, but only a reduced number are important to the epidemiology of malaria in each region. In Brazil, five species are considered to be the main vectors: Anopheles darlingi, A, aquasalis, A. albitarsisr A. cruzi and A. bellator.<br>
The paxasite is transmitted by the bite of the infected ins ect that innoculates the sporozoans, which get lodged in the hepatic tissue, when it comes to the human Plasmodium, they multiply intensively (a sporozoan generates from 10 thousand to 40 thousand schizonts within the hepatocyte). Released from the host cell, the parasites fall into the blood stream, invading and multiplying themselves in the red cells, provoking clinical manifestations of the disease, mainly intermittent fever, chronic headache, myalgia, anemia, breathing difficulties, convulsions and coma. In some regions of Africa a serious anemia is the common cause of infant mortality for some reason or another.<br>
There are many classes of active antimalarial medicines against blood forms of the parasite. Among the more used antimalarials are: (a) the antifolates type I and II (e.g. pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine), which inhibit the parasite ditiydrofolate reductase; (b) the aminoquinolines (e.g. chloroquine and amodiaquine); (c) the artemisinin derivatives (e.g. artesunate and arteeter) have as their<br><br>
most important site of action the digestive vacuole of the parasite. Primaquine acts against the hepatic forms of slow development common in P. vivax and responsible for relapses.<br>
In the last decades the use of some blood schizonticides, in determined areas, became inefficient clue to the emergence of resistance to them. Resistance to chloroquine, detected inicially in the 1960 's in Magdalena Valley, Colombia, and later in Vietnam and Brazil, is widely spread and will continue to appear in new areas, as it happened in Africa in the 1980's. As a solution to this problem, it was used again the quinine, a drug with h±gh toxicity, and mefloquine, described by the American Armed Forces based on a selection of thousand of drugs derived from chloroquine. rt was believed that mefloquine was a medicine 100% efficient against chloroquine-resistent parasites. However, P. falciparum developed resistance to mefloquine very fast, this fact was first observed in 19 90, as well as other driags commonly used. In the last 20 years, besides mefloquine, some drugs, such as halofantrine and art ends inin derivatives were developed to treat chloroquine-resistent P. falciparum.<br>
The combination of drugs have been employed successfully in different classes of diseases, AIDS, cancer, and tuberculosis, for instance. This strategy of combination of drugs has also been employed with promising results against malaria. As an example, it can be cited the combination of artemisin derivatives with lumefantrine or doxycycline, as well as the combination of mefloquine<br><br>
with tetracycline or doxycycline (Wdlairatana, P. et al. Archives of Medical Research, 2O02, 33, 416). The combination of quinine and Fansidar (pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine) is employed to treat chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum.<br>
It is known that suppositories of artesunate provide fast response to fighting the parasite and fever in severe cases of P. Falciparum; however, the recrudescence rate is high. Mefloquine (1250 mg) is administered in order to prevent and reduce recrudescence [Looareeswan et al., Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 89, 1995, 46 9-475; Looareeswan et al., Jpn. J. Trop. Med, Hyg. 24 (Suppl. 1) 1996,13-15].<br>
However, as for the presence of multidrug-resistent P. Falciparum in many countries, the treatment of malaria with the drugs available nowadays is not always effective, the same happens to the chemoprophylaxis, not used in Brazil anymore.<br>
It is noticed through patent documents W09425436 and WO02083641, that reasearches are being done in order to obtain amino derivatives. In the docxament WO02083641 these compounds may be combined with antimalarial compounds, such as quinolines (mefloquine) and antimalarial peroxides (artesunate).<br>
This form of treatment, in which is used more than one medicine active in malaria treatment , even if one of them is new as previously reported, is susceptible of failure due to the resistance developed by the P. falciparum in relation to well-known drugs.<br>
Hence, according to the increase in the resistance of<br><br>
this parasite, the research is absolutely necessary to develop new chemotherapeut ic agents capable of fighting malaria effectively, which, tends to aggravate with the planet global warmth and the deteriorating health system in many countries in tropic regions, where the disease is endemic.<br>
The artesunate was developed in 1982 in China and the mefloquine in 1971, in the USA. According to what was previously presented, it is applied a combination of antimalarial drugs or polytherapy, e.g. the use of mefloquine and artesunate.<br>
However, it has never been proposed to develop artesunate salts with quinolines, as it is described in the present invention, with antimalarial activiy or against other diseases caused by other protozoans in order to overcome the difficulties pointed out. It is important to highlight that, since they are water soluble salts, the compounds of the invention allow a simplification in its formulation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to new compounds derive from artesunate salts with quinolines represented by th general formula I:<br>
X+.Y-where X is represented by the general formula II:<br><br>
and Y represented by the general formula III:<br><br><br>
Depending on the radicals substituted in X (formula II) f the relation X to Y (formula III) may vary from 1:1 to 1:7, because the amount of Y depends on the amount of N available in X for the formation of the salt.<br>
The radicals R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 e R6 in the general formula II are represented by: R1 = H, CF3, CH3, OCH3, NH2, halogen;<br>
R2 = Hf CH3r NH2, halogen, NH-CHCH3 (CH2)3N (C2H5) (CH2CH2OH), CH (OH) -2- (C5H11N) , NH-R7-N- (C2H5) 2; R3 = H, m-OC6H4CF3, NH2; R4 = H, CH3, OCH3, NH2, halogen; R5 = H, CH3f CF3, NH2, halogen;<br>

R8 = CHCH3 (CH2) 3, CHCH3 (CH2) CHCH3 , (CH2) 2, (CH2) 3, (CH2) 6, (CH2)30(CH2)3.<br>
The new compounds derived from artesunate salts with quinolines, represented by the general formula I, present proven antimalarial activity, they may be employed in the treatment or prevention from diseases caused by a variaty<br><br>
of protozoans.<br>
Besides that, the compounds of the present invention have been of great advantage in terms of effectiveness when compared to a combination of drugs or polytherapy, as for example, the use of mefloquine and artesunate, the way it is known as the state of the art.<br>
Administering more than one medicine active in the treatment of malaria, either in combination or polytherapy, is susceptible to failure because of the resistance developed by the P. falciparum to well-known drugs.<br>
Another advantage of the compounds described in the current invention, represented by the general formula I, is the fact that they are more water soluble than mefloquine and artesunate, what allows the simplification of its formulation.<br>
The present invention also refers to a simple and original process to obtain the derivatives of artesunate salts with quinolines represented by the general formula I.<br>
The general process to prepare the compounds derived from artesunate salts and quinolines comprises the following stages:<br>
a)	solubilization of quinoline, represented by the general formula II, as a free base form in organic solvents;<br>
b)	solubilization of artesunate, represented by the general formula III, in organic solvents;<br>
c)	addition of the artesunate solution (stage b) to the quinoline solution (stage a) in order to obtain derivatives of artesunate salts of quinolines;<br><br>
d)	solvent evaporation for salt precipitation?<br>
e)	salt filtration in order to obtain derivatives of artesunate salts of quinolines as a solid product. Its effectiveness ranges from 80 to 96%.<br>
When the quinoline becomes a salt it can be converted into quinoline base-free form through the following stages:<br>
i) solubilization of quinoline salt in selected polar solvents such as water, water/ aliphatic alcohol from C1 to C6 and ether;<br>
ii) quinoline convert ion into base-free salt, using a saturated aqueous solution of inorganic base;<br>
iii) extraction of quinoline in base-free form using organic solvents;<br>
iv) drying of the organic phase with desiccant agents;<br>
v) organic solvent evaporation to obtain quinoline in its base-free form.<br>
The stage (i) ether may be selected among diethylether, t-butylmethy lether, tetrahydrofuran and 1,2-dimetoxyethane.<br>
In the conversion of quinoline in base-free form/ stage (ii), it is employed an inorganic base selected among sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate.<br>
Among organic solvents used in the extraction of quinoline into a base-free drug form, stage (iii) as well as in the solubilization of quinolines and artesunate stages (a) and (b), respectively, it is employed ether, halogenide solvents and alcohol. Ether may be selected<br><br>
among The stage (i) ether may be selected among diethylether, t-butylmethylether, tetrahydrofuran and 1, 2-dimetoxyethane. Halogenide Solvents may be dichlorometan and chloroform, and the alcohol may be an aliphatic alcohol from C1 to C6-<br>
In the drying process of the organic phase (stage iv) the diseccant agents may be anhydrous sodium sulphate, anhydrous magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride.<br>
The compounds of the current invention may be used mainly in the treatment or prevention from malaria or other parasitic diseases, such as, kaodzera, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, amoebiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, as well as other helminthiases.<br>
The application of the compound of this invention in the treatment of prevention from these diseases, caused by a variaty of protozoans, is evident to an expert in the field that recognizes a substancial structural homology and superposition of activity and particularity of the substrate among the enzymes of P. falciparum and another protozoan.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the current invention comprises, as an active ingredient, an effective amount of one of the derivatives of artesunate salts with quinolines and an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle.<br>
The acceptabLe pharmaceutical vehicle must be any type of material, inert and non-toxic, to allow the formulation of the active ingredient, in order to permit its administration. These vehicles are well-known by the<br><br>
experts -<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the current invention may be administered through the digestive tract (orally or through the use of suppositories), or via parenteral (cutaneous or intracutaneous).<br>
To be administered by mouth, the medicine may come in tablets, pills, capsules, emulsion, solution or suspension. The inactive components in this case comprise excipients, ligants, desintegrant s, diluents, lubricants, etc.<br>
Solid compositions include the active ingredient mixed with non-toxic excipients suitable to manufacture tablets, such as starch, lactose, certain types of carbonates e bicarbonates, phosphates, talc etc. The tablets may be coated or not, depending on the point of the gastrointestinal tract where the desintegration and the absorption of the drag must occur.<br>
In case of suspensions or aqueous solutions, excipients such as metyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, acacia gum, lecytin etc and one or more additives, such as preservers, colorants, flavouring agents, thickners, polyols, saccharose, glucose etc may be used.<br>

For parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous) route of administration, the medicine must be<br><br>
injectable. The inactive components used in this case include acceptable parenteral diluents and solvents and other non-toxic components such as suspension agents, oils, water, polyols, alcohols, glycerines, vegetable oils, lecytins, liposomes etc.<br>
The quantity of the active principle, which wilZL be combined with the acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle, in order to produce the final dosage form will depend on the organism to be treated as well as on the chosen way to administer it. The active ingredient will preferably range from 0,1 to 99% of the formulation weigth. The concentration of the active principle should be most of all within 0,25 and 99% of the formulation weight.<br>
However, it must be clear that the specific level of the dose for any patient will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the employed compound, age, body weight, general clinical picture, sex, diet, "time and via of administration, excretion rate, combination with other drugs, resistance and severity of the disease to be treated.<br>

EXAMPLE 4 PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
The pharmacological evaluation of the compounds of the current invention, in order to prove the respective therapeutical efficiency, may be demonstrated in the following tests where 3 samples were used, labeled "A", "B" and "C", and all the tests were done with samples that followed the same codes. Sample "A" is constituted of salt of artesunate and mefloquine (compound of artesunate salt according to the current invention), sample "B" is constituted of axrtesunate, while sample "C" is represented by mefloquine. The description of the tests is done in 3 stages: methodology, results and conclusions.<br><br>
TEST METHODOLOGY<br>
To evaluate the antimalarial activity the following tests were carried out in different experiments in vivo using groups of Swiss female albino mice, weighing between 18 and. 22 g. These mice were innoculated with 100,000 red cells infected with strain NK 65 of Plasmodium berghei (cause of malaria in rodents) according to the scheme previously proposed (Peters et al.f Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, 1993, 87, 547). After innoculating the parasite via intraperitoneal, the animals were divided at random into groups of five. The treatment of the mice were initiated the day after the innoculation, for 4 days in sequence, applying samples "A", "B" e "C" administered via oral. The different groups of mice, represented by groups treated and not treated (group control) were kept in the same conditions, in polyacetylene cages, water and ration was offered ad libitum. A group was treated with chloroquine, an antimalarial of reference. The development of the infection was verified in all groups through blood samples collected for parasitaemia on the 5th and 7th day after the infection, and the parasitaemia was measured based on double blind tests, in codified slides, in order to minimize occasional bias.<br>
The tests in vitro to evaluate the antimalarial activity were carried out with P. falciparum cultivated in red cells in 10% of human serum, in slabs of 96 wells, using Rieckman et al' s traditional method, modified by Carvalho et al. Braz J. Med. Biol. Research, 1991. The parasites were incubated for 72 hours in culture medium<br><br>
having samples "A", "B" and "C" in different dilutions in ideal atmospherical conditions at 37°C; drugs and the culture medium was changed every 24 hours. After this period, blood samples were collected for evaluation of the activity of each compound. As to - control wells with complete culture medium were maintained, but with no addition of drugs, and wells in which chloroquine was present in different tested concentrations in triplicate. OBTAINED RESULTS<br>
Not only in vivo but also in vitro, the activity of drugs was evaluated in relation to the group control without any drugs. The results are shown in table 1.<br>
Table 1 - Antimalarial effect of samples "A" (salt of artesunate and mefloquine), "B" (artesunate) and "C" (mefloquine) with a dose of 12 mg/kg in mice infected by Plasmodium berghei and treated via oral for 4 dias in sequence.<br><br><br>
Sd = standard deviation of averages of 5 mice in each group.<br>
*In relation to the group control not treated.<br>
Wot only the artesunate, but also the mefloquine and the new salt of artesunate with quinoline, tested with a dose of 12mg/kg via oral supressed 100% the acute parasltaemia of treated animals, in evaluations carried out on the 5th and 7th day after the infection. We usually follow the evolution of treatment for 30 days but the animals were anemic and mortality occurred in one of the groups r the one treated with sample "B" (which was later decoded as pure artesunate) . Because of "this, we restarted collecting new blood samples.<br>
Tabela 2 - Recrudescence of the parasitaemia in animals infected by P. berghei and treated with sample "B" (pure artesunate in a dose of 12mg/kg) .<br>
Sd = standard deviation; t = Animal death<br>
Meanwhile groups treated with sample "A" (new<br><br>
compound/ salt of mefloquine artesunate) and "C" (mefloquine) remained negative, the animals of the group treated with sample "B" (puxe artesunate) showed recrudescency of the parasitaemia, Therefore, in animals treated with salt of artesunate with quinolines (sample "A") the cure of malaria was observed.<br>
The results of tests in vitro with P. falciparum are depicted in Table 3 showing that artesunate and the salt of artesunate with quinolines presented similar activity in vitro, but higher than pure mefloquine. The variations observed in the activity of the compounds in these two different experiments are expected and take place due to limitations of the methodology which makes use of a microscopic for evaluations. This methodology is little accurate.<br>
Table 3 - Inhibiting concentrations (IC) approximated for the increasing of P. falciparum (W2) in vitro to the chloroquine (QC) and to samples "A", "B" and "C" against P. falciparum, in two distinct experiments.<br><br>
CONCLUSIONS<br><br>
Artesunate and artesunate salt with quinolines demonstrated similar activities in vitro, while artesunate was not able to cure malaria in animals treated with a dose of 12mg/kg. The best tested compound against malaria was<br>
the artesunate salt with quinolines.<br><br>
