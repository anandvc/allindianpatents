				<td>This invention relates to an asymmetric copper complex comprising, as components, an optically active bisoxazoline compound, a copper compound and a strong acid or a Lewis acid or a mixture thereof  a process for producing the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
An optically active cyclopropanecarboxylate is an important<br>
compound as an intermediate for the production of pharmaceuticals and<br>
agrochemicals.	For	example,<br>
(+)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid known<br>
as chrysanthemum-monocarboxylic acid constitutes an acid component of<br>
synthetic	pyrethroid	type	insecticides.<br>
(+)-2,2'Dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid is known to be useful as an intermediate for synthesis of p-lactam type antibiotics.<br>
Conventional methods known to produce the optically active cyclopropanecarboxylic acid derivatives directly by synthetic means are a method of reacting a prochiral olefin with a diazoacetate in the presence of an asymmetric copper complex using optically active bis[2-(4,5-diphenyl'l,3-oxazolynyl)]methane as a ligand (Tetrahedron Lett., 32, 7373, 1991 etc.).<br>
These methods, however, were not always satisfactory as an industrial production method in that complicated procedures were required to produce the copper complex and handling thereof was not always easy because of its poor stability.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

For example, an acid stronger than acetic acid is preferably used together with copper acetate, and an acid that is stronger than hydrochloric acid is used with copper chloride.<br>
Alternatively, preferred strong acid is a strong acid of which acidity falls within a range of Hammett value "Hd of about -10 to about -50, or jD^value range of about 3 or less.<br>
Specific examples of the preferred strong acid include, for example, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, fluorosulfonic acid, chlorosulfonic acid, hydrogen fluoride, fuming sulfuric acid, cone, sulfuric acid, Nafion (trade name) and the like.<br>

a mixture of antimony pentafluoride and trifluoromethanesulfonic<br>
acid and the like.<br>
Further, the invention also relates to a composition comprising the assymetric copper complex and an organic solvent.<br>
The asymmetric copper complex is usually produced by mixing the components typically in a solvent, and any combination of the components recited under (a), (b) and (c) above may be selected and are made to be contacted with each other, and the remaining component(s) can be further added thereto, thus the order of addition of the components are not limited.<br>
For example, the production of the asymmetric copper complex may be conducted by any one of the following methods-"<br>
a method wherein the above-described copper compound is reacted with the optically active bisoxazoline compound of formula (1) and then the strong acid is added thereto;<br>
a method wherein the copper compound is reacted with the strong acid and then the optically active bisoxazoline compound of formula (1) is added and mixed therewith; or<br>
a method wherein the optically active bisoxazoline compound of formula (l) is mixed with the strong acid and then the above-described copper compound is added thereto.<br>
Preferred is a method wherein the copper compound is reacted with the optically active bisoxazoline compound of formula (l) to produce a<br><br>
copper complex, and thereafter the resulting copper complex is reacted with the strong acid or Lewis acid or a mixture thereof.<br>
Any suitable organic solvent can be used in the present production method. A solvent that can form a catalyst solution of the resulting asymmetric copper complex in a solvent is preferably used.<br>
Examples of the solvent that may be used include, for example,<br>
an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene or the like,<br>
an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, cyclohexane, heptane or the like, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform, dichloroethane, monochlorobutane or the like,<br>
an ester such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate or the like, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The optically active bisoxazoline compound of formula (l) is used usually in an amount of about 0.9 to 2 moles per mol of the monovalent or divalent copper compound, and the strong acid or Lewis acid or a mixture thereof is used usually in an amount of about 0.3 to 5 moles per mol of the monovalent or divalent copper compound.<br>
The mixing of the respective components is usually conducted at a temperature range of from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent, and preferably in the range of about 0 to 60 °C for a suitable period of time.<br>
Preferably, the asymmetric copper complex may be used in a solution form, and particularly purification thereof is not required, but the complex can also be used after isolation and purification by removing the solvent. The asymmetric copper complex catalyst can be conveniently used as such in a solution form so as to continuously feed the catalyst in a continuous reaction process. Alternatively, the asymmetric copper complex, which is not a solution, (e.g, in a form of slurry or solid) may also be used, as a catalyst, in a reaction in which a slurry reaction mass is being<br><br>
stirred or in a continuous reaction using a packed tower of solid catalyst.<br>

The diazoacetate including the diazoacetate of formula (3) can be obtained by a method known in the art, and for example, it can be obtained by subjecting a corresponding amino acid ester to diazotization reaction and then extracting the product with a solvent such as chloroform, toluene, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane or the prochiral olefin. If necessary, the product can also be isolated by distillation or the like.<br>
Examples of the solvent that may be used include, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, monochlorobutane or the like,<br>
an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane or the like,<br>
an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene or the like,<br>
an ester such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate or the like, the prochiral olefin (e.g. prochiral olefin of formula (2)), and a mixture thereof<br>
The solvent is used usually in an amount of 2 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 3 to 30 parts by weight per 1 part by weight of the diazoacetate.<br>
An effective amount of the asymmetric copper complex catalyst can be used and it is preferably used in an amount of 0.0001 to 0.01 mol, more preferably from 0.0002 to about 0.005 mol per mol of the diazoacetate.<br>
The asymmetric cyclopropanation reaction is usually conducted in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or the like. The reaction temperature is usually -20 to 130 °C, preferably -10 to about 110 °C.   The<br><br>
reaction may be conducted at a lower range to improve the selectivity of the reaction, typically in a prochiral olefin of lower-boiling point as a solvent, and the catalyst may be activated by adding a reducing agent such as phenylhydrazine prior to use, if necessary.<br>
The reaction (asymmetric cyclopropanation) of the prochiral olefin with the diazoacetate in the presence of the asymmetric copper complex is typically conducted by adding the diazoacetate dissolved in a solvent to a mixture of the prochiral olefin and the asymmetric copper complex.<br>
The asymmetric copper complex catalyst, the diazoacetate and/or the prochiral olefin may be continuously fed into a reaction vessel in the above temperature range, and the reaction solution containing the cyclopropanecarboxylate may be continuously withdrawn from the reaction vessel.<br>
