				<td>WIND TURBINE TOWER SUSPENSION ARRANGEMENT AND<br>
METHOD OF MOUNTING ELEMENTS IN A WIND TURBINE<br>
TOWER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of mounting elements in a wind turbine<br>
tower.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Typically, wind turbine towers carry the nacelle and the rotor of a wind turbine in<br>
order to allow for the desired rotation of the rotor and to raise the rotor into a position<br>
as far as possible from the ground as wind speeds typically increase with the distance<br>
to the ground.<br>
A wind turbine tower may be constructed according to several different principles,<br>
e.g. as tubular steel towers, lattice towers or even concrete towers.<br>
Most-large wind turbines are delivered with tubular steel towers manufactured in<br>
sections of 20-30 meters with flanges at both ends, and bolted together on the site.<br>
The towers are typically conical in order to increase strength and save materials at<br>
the same time.<br>
The steel towers typically comprise an interior with platforms, ladders, illumination<br>
means, power cables, lifts, etc. The components are welded to the inner surface of<br>
the steel tower section, or directly attached to the fittings, which have been welded<br>
and/or bolted to the tower.<br>
One of several problems associated with the above-described wind turbine towers is<br>
that the welding or bolting of especially the interior tower components such as<br>
ladders, cables, etc., weaken the tower structure.<br>
In some cases it is possible to compensate for this problem by taking relatively costly<br>
precautions.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a wind turbine tower suspension arrangement comprising at<br>
least one first member comprising magnetic attachment means and at least one<br>
further mechanical member being mechanically coupled to said first member by<br>
means of at least one coupling means, said coupling means providing at least one<br>
degree of freedom between said magnetic attachment means and said at least one<br>
further member.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, mutually displacement in at least one<br>
direction may be absorbed or damped without transferring the invoking force into the<br>
magnetic attachment means. In this way, the invention provides an optimization of<br>
the attachment provided by the magnetic attachment means, due to the fact that<br>
forces having a direction to which the magnetic attachment may be weak, may be<br>
absorbed or damped in the coupling. Preferably and generally the invention deals<br>
with permanent suspension of elements and structures within a wind turbine tower.<br>
In other words, the elements suspended according to the invention are preferably<br>
intended to be permanently positioned.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at least one degree of freedom is substantially<br>
fixed. Thus, while accepting a certain degree of freedom with respect to movement,<br>
at least one degree of freedom should be substantially fixed, thereby facilitating a<br>
substantially rigid suspension via the coupling between the first and the further<br>
member in at least one direction. This direction is typically in the normal direction,<br>
i.e. in the direction in which the magnetic forces between the magnetic attachment<br>
means and the foundation are strongest.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said coupling means comprising at least one<br>
hinged connection.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the coupling means comprises vibration-<br>
absorbing means. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
vibration absorbing means should absorb vibrations, e.g. in the form of periodically-<br><br>
like vibrations, impulses or transients, thereby protecting the attachment during use.<br>
Evidently, this is important when vibrations are invoked during use of elements<br>
attached to the wind turbine tower.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the vibration-absorbing means comprises at least<br>
one elastic/resilient member. According to the invention an elastic/resilient member<br>
represents a structure, which will return to its original shape after being deformed,<br>
stretched or compressed. Typically, such member will inherit these properties in a<br>
reversible way, although a certain minimal irreversibility may occur due to material<br>
hysteresis.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the vibration-absorbing means comprises at least<br>
one mass.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the vibration-absorbing means comprises at least<br>
one damper. According to the invention, a damper comprises an element, which will<br>
induce loss of kinetic energy when the element is activated. Almost any structure<br>
facilitating the desired properties with respect to movement of the further member<br>
relative to the first member may be designed by means of serial or parallel<br>
combinations of the three elements: mass, damper and spring (analogies).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the first member, the coupling means and the<br>
further member form a single suspension unit. According to an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention, the suspension arrangement may form one single unit,<br>
which may be mounted on the tower wall simply by positioning the unit at the<br>
desired position.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the suspension unit comprises a fitting.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the unit is also mounted<br>
with a fitting to which a mechanical structure may be fitted.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the magnetic attachment means comprise a<br>
permanent magnetic material.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the permanent magnetic material comprises<br>
permanent Neodym magnets.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the permanent magnetic material comprises<br>
permanent Samarium- Cobalt magnets.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises mechanical fixating means.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises at least one barrier encapsulating said magnetic attachment means<br>
completely or partly.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
and wherein the barrier prevents transportation of humidity to the magnetic means.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises means for receiving mechanical attraction forces in at least one first<br>
direction (d3) and means for establishment of magnetic attraction forces in at least<br>
one other direction (d1), said at least one other direction (d1) being substantially<br>
transverse in relation to said at least one first direction.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises ladder-fixating means, a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention has been obtained.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises platform-fixating means, a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention has been obtained.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises cable-fixating means, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
has been obtained.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the wind turbine tower suspension arrangement<br>
comprises illumination means, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
has been obtained.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method of mounting elements in a wind turbine<br>
tower, whereby said elements are partly or completely attached to the wind turbine<br>
tower by means of magnetic attraction forces and where said elements are coupled to<br>
the wind turbine tower via a coupling means having at least one degree of freedom.<br>
According to the invention, a method implying at least one degree of freedom with<br>
respect to mutually movement or displacement facilitates an improved magnetic<br>
attraction by the magnetic attachment means to the foundation, i.e. the wind turbine<br>
tower, due to the fact that the distance between the magnet(s) providing the magnetic<br>
forces needed for the attachment may be uniform over the at least a part of,<br>
preferably all, the area of the magnets. In this aspect it should be noted that the non-<br>
uniform distribution of the distance from the magnet to the magnetic foundation very<br>
likely will decrease the effective magnetic attraction between the attachment means<br>
and the foundation.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said magnetic attraction forces are established by<br>
means of permanent magnetic materials interacting with other magnetic materials.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said magnetic attraction forces is provided by at<br>
least one first member comprising magnetic attachment means,<br>
whereby said elements may be fitted to at least one further mechanical member being.<br>
mechanically coupled to said first member by means of at least one coupling means<br><br>
said coupling means providing at least one degree of freedom between said magnetic<br>
attachment means and said at least one further member<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one degree of freedom facilitates an<br>
optimized and uniform distribution of magnetic attraction forces between the<br>
permanent magnetic materials and the wind turbine tower.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the at least one degree of freedom is limited to a<br>
certain mutual displacement or inclining between said at least one first member and<br>
said at least one further member.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said magnetic attraction forces are established by<br>
means of permanent magnetic materials being comprised in a suspension unit and<br>
interacting with other magnetic materials forming at least a portion of a wind turbine<br>
tower.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said magnetic attraction forces are supplemented<br>
by mechanical fixation in at least one direction.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said mechanical fixation in at least one direction<br>
is established by mechanical fixation to fixation areas, said fixation areas being<br>
arranged at a certain distance from each other in the vertical direction of a wind<br>
turbine tower.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said mechanical fixation in at least one direction<br>
is established by mechanical fixation to fixation areas, said fixation areas being<br>
arranged at a certain distance from each other in the vertical direction of a wind<br>
turbine tower, said distances approximately constituting the vertical length of a wind<br>
turbine tower section.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said fixation areas comprise flanges adapted to<br>
joining the wind turbine tower sections.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the elements comprise ladders or parts of ladders.<br>

to the magnetic means.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the unit comprises means for receiving<br>

Detailed description<br>
Most large wind turbines are delivered with tubular steel towers manufactured in<br>
sections of 20-30 meters with flanges at both ends, and bolted together on the site.<br>
The towers are conical (i.e. the diameter increases towards the base) in order to<br>
increase strength and save materials at the same time.<br>
The production costs of the wind turbine towers are relatively high compared with<br>
the manufacturing costs of the complete wind turbine construction. Moreover, these<br>
costs increase proportionately with the height and especially if it exceeds around fifty<br>
meters. It is therefore quite important with respect to the final cost of energy to build<br>
towers as optimally as possible.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates some basic principles of an embodiment of the invention. The<br>
illustrated wind turbine tower suspension comprises a first member 11 is coupled to a<br>
further member 12 by means of a coupling means 13.<br>
The first member 11 comprises magnetic attachment means 14, preferably a<br>
permanent magnet. The first member 11 may be magnetically attached to a<br>
foundation 15, in this case a wind turbine tower. Other mechanical structures (not<br>
shown) may be fixated to the further member 12, thereby obtaining a fixation of<br>
these structures to the foundation 15 via the coupling means 13 and the first member<br>
11.<br>
The coupling means 13 comprises a structure enabling a relative movement in at<br>
least one degree of freedom between the first member 11 and the further member 12.<br>
The coupling means may e.g. comprise elements or combinations of resilient or<br>
elastic elements, dampers and masses. In other words, movement of the mechanical<br>
structure(s) attached to the further member may be absorbed by means of the<br>
coupling means in at least one direction. This important feature strengthens the<br>
magnetic attachment of the first member to the foundation significantly.<br><br>
It should be noted that the coupling means may be comprised of one single coupling<br>
means or it may comprise several mutually coupled elements. The form of the<br>
coupling means may also vary significantly as well and the functional elements may<br>
be distributed physically near to or in distance from the first member. Likewise, the<br>
first member may comprise a single mechanical structure or for example comprise<br>
several distributed elements. The further member 12 may comprise fittings (not<br>
shown). Example of other structures may e.g. comprise ladders, light armatures,<br>
cable fixations means, etc. When the first member 11 is attached to the foundation 15<br>
wholly or at least partly by means of magnetically forces, the coupling means may<br>
protect the magnetically applied attachment between the first member and the<br>
foundation. In particular, the weakest parts of the attachment may benefit<br>
significantly of the coupling means inserted between the magnetic attachment<br>
provided by the first member and the further member, to which further mechanical<br>
structures may be fitted. In other words, the coupling means 13 should be designed in<br>
such a way that movement and/or forces invoked to the further member 12 are<br>
damped and/or absorbed by means of the coupling.<br>
As the wind turbine tower suspension is applied for attachment of certain necessary<br>
or advantageous structures to the wind turbine tower, it is very important that the<br>
coupling means is designed to absorb or damp movements or forces induced to the<br>
suspension e.g. when a person climbs a ladder suspended according to the invention<br>
thereby protecting or strengthening the desired attachment provided by the above-<br>
described first member 11.<br>
Another type of undesired load potentially weakening the magnetic attachment is a<br>
more static load applied to the first member 11, when a mechanical structure is fitted<br>
to the member 11.<br>
Both above-mentioned loads, a dynamic or a static load, may result in a complete<br>
weakening of the magnetic attachment to the wind turbine tower resulting in that the<br>
first member is disconnected to the foundation and the effect of both types of loads<br><br>
may be effectively reduced or counteracted according to the provisions of the<br>
invention.<br>
Different embodiments of the invention will be described below dealing with<br>
especially one or both of the above-described problems.<br>
Fig. 2a and 2b illustrate a hybrid suspension dealing with both the above-described<br>
problems.<br>
Fig. 2a illustrates a suspension unit 20 as seen from above.<br>
The illustrated and preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a main body 21<br>
comprising a fitting 22 to which mechanical structures may be fitted.<br>
Fig. 2b illustrates the suspension as seen from the side.<br>
Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c show cross-sections of the above-described suspension 20 as seen<br>
from above, the side and the end, respectively.<br>
Fig. 3a illustrates a wind turbine tower suspension unit 20 comprising a main body<br>
21 and a mechanically connectable member or section 22 to which mechanical<br>
structures may be fixated by suitable fixation means.<br>
The dimensions of the main body 21 of the illustrated unit may e.g. be approximately<br>
200 mm x 50 mm x 25 mm and the weight may be approximately Vi kilogram.<br>
The unit comprises two magnets 24, 25. The magnets are permanent magnets.<br>
Evidently, according to the invention, the magnets may comprise almost any number<br>
of magnets grouped and arranged suitably according to the overall design principles.<br>
The characteristics of the magnet(s) will be described in detail subsequently.<br><br>
The magnets 24, 25 are encapsulated by a barrier material 23 of e.g. rubber.<br>
Advantageously, the barrier material should feature a relatively high friction<br>
coefficient, thereby maximizing the transversal conservative forces between the unit<br>
and the tower inner surface when the unit is attached to an inner surface by magnetic<br>
force in the usual directions, here primarily expressed as normal forces.<br>
The barrier material protects the magnet from humidity and dust, thereby preventing<br>
corrosion or other physical degradation of the magnet. Moreover, a mechanically<br>
connectable member or section 22 is secured to the main body of the unit 20 via a<br>
coupling according to the invention. In the present application, the magnet and the<br>
member or section 22 extend to the exterior of the unit and form a bolt, e.g. M10x30,<br>
at the end. The bolt 22 may be fitted to a suitable nut, thereby providing fixation of a<br>
suitable fitting to the unit. Note that the lower part of the rubber sealing is quite thin<br>
in order to obtain the strongest possible attraction forces.<br>
The illustrated suspension unit 20 comprises a U-shaped steel cover 250 arranged to<br>
be in galvanic contact with the permanent magnets 24, 25, e.g. Neodym. The<br>
complete assembly, with the exception of the fitting 22, is encapsulated within a<br>
barrier material as described above, thereby providing airtight and waterproof<br>
enclosure around the magnet 24, 25 once it is mounted. The U-shape of the magnet<br>
provides an improved magnetic coupling means to the underlying surface. Moreover,<br>
the U-shape forms a very advantageous structure for holding the magnets together in<br>
one solid unit. Evidently, other standard types of magnet configurations may be<br>
applied within the scope of the invention.<br>
The fitting 22, a bolt, forms part of a base structure comprising a base portion 26<br>
comprising an end portion 27. The base portion 26 is anchored within the mean body<br>
21 of the suspension unit in a resilient material 28, e.g. rubber. The base portion 22 is<br>
anchored in the U-shaped steel cover 250 and projecting through the cover via an<br>
opening 29.<br><br>
With the terms introduced in fig. 1, the sealed main body 21 and the magnets 24,25<br>
comprises the first member 11, the rigid structure comprising the bolt 22, the base<br>
portion 26 and the end portion 27 comprises the further member 12 and the resilient<br>
material 28 forms the coupling means 13.<br>
In short, the illustrated embodiment of the invention facilitates a certain degree of<br>
freedom with respect to movement of the bolt 22 in several directions, limited by the<br>
nature of the resilient material 28 and the geometrical arranging of the further<br>
member comprising the bolt 22, base portion 26 and the end portion 27 within the<br>
main body 21.<br>
Different natures of those movements and the properties with respect to impulse and<br>
transient absorption/damping will be described below.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the basic dynamic functionality of the already described suspension<br>
unit of fig. 2a and fig. 3c.<br>
The illustrated cross-section in fig. 4 corresponds to the illustrated cross section in<br>
fig. 3c.<br>
The rigid structure forming the further member 22, 26, 27 is movable in several<br>
directions due to the elasticity of the resilient coupling means 28 with respect to the<br>
first member 23, 250, e.g. when the member is fixated magnetically to a foundation<br>
(not shown). It should be noted that the first member might of course be slightly<br>
movable with respect to the foundation, here due to the resiliency of the<br>
encapsulation forming the contact area between the first member 22, 26, 27 and the<br>
foundation.<br>
The resilient coupling means 28 enables a certain degree of freedom with respect to<br>
movement of the further member, especially in the direction d1 parallel with<br>
direction of the axis A of the further member 22, 26, 27. The movement in the<br>
direction dl is restricted outwardly, i.e. away from the foundation (illustrated as 15<br><br>
in fig. 1) by the U-shaped part of the main body 250 in combination with the end<br>
portion 27 of the base portion 26. Inwardly, the movement in the direction d1 is<br>
restricted by the end portion 27 when the unit is mounted at a wall of a wind turbine<br>
tower.<br>
Moreover, the illustrated further member is movable in a direction d2 enabling a<br>
degree of rotational displacement between the first member 250, 23 and the further<br>
member 22,26,27.<br>
Also, a degree of freedom is obtained in a direction d3 substantially transverse to the<br>
axis A.<br>
Also, a degree of freedom is obtained in a direction (not shown) defining a rotation<br>
around the axis A.<br>
In summary, the design should facilitate a certain degree of freedom with respect to<br>
movement of the further member 22, 26, 27 while maintaining a for the purpose<br>
strong attachment between the first member 250, 23 and the foundation to which it is<br>
attached, between the further member 22, 26, 27 and the first member 250, 23 and<br>
between the further member 22,26,27 and the mechanical structure coupled thereto.<br>
Evidently, suspensions according to the invention may define several other<br>
combinations of degrees of freedom.<br>
A small inclination is very often staticly induced in the illustrated direction d2 (or in<br>
one of the other directions) when a mechanical structure is fitted to the suspension.<br>
The further member 22,26,27 should be able to perform a displacement during such<br>
fitting and more or less remain in this position in the rest of its lifetime. Preferably,<br>
the static adaptation of the suspension to the permanent relative positioning of the<br>
first and further member should also absorb or adapt to dynamic vibrations, e.g. in<br>
the form of transients or impulses induced during use of the suspension, e.g. invoked<br><br>
when a person is climbing a ladder suspended to the wind turbine tower wholly or<br>
partly by the suspension.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates further features of the suspension of fig. 2a.<br>
As mentioned above, the further member comprised by the elements 22,, 26, 27<br>
should be sufficiently anchored to the first member 250, 23 to avoid the further<br>
member is simply released by the coupling means.<br>
Due to the relatively weak structure of the illustrated resilient coupling means itself,<br>
the anchoring is secured as described in the following.<br>
Basically, as mentioned above, the rear part of the further member, i.e. the end<br>
portion 27, ensures that the further member is not displaced further than the surface<br>
of the foundation 15 permits, when high pressure is applied towards the foundation<br>
via the first member 250, 23 .<br>
Also, as mentioned above, the rear part of the further member, i.e. the end portion 27<br>
ensures that the tensile forces do not pull the further member out of the main body.<br>
This is ensured, as illustrated in fig. 5, by letting the extension D2 of the end portion<br>
27 being greater the extension D1 of the opening 29 formed in the main body<br>
A further feature of the suspension of fig. 5 is illustrated by the fact that distance 11,<br>
i.e. the thickness of the resilient material on top of the base portion 26 is smaller than<br>
the distance 12 between the end portion 27 and the lower part of the U-shaped steel<br>
member.<br>
This feature minimizes the risk that a mechanical structure (not shown) may be fitted<br>
to the bolt 22 by very strong connection forces without restricting the mobility of the<br>
further member within the main body of the first member.<br><br>
The distance 12 of the illustrated embodiment must be sufficiently large enough to<br>
ensure that the desired degree of displacement may be obtained.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a further feature of an embodiment of the , as seen from above.<br>
The end portion 27 of the further member is geometrically formed and positioned in<br>
a thereto-adapted cradle 60 in the main body 21 of the suspension so that the end<br>
portion restricts the freedom of the rotation of the further member along its axis in<br>
the direction d4. This is rather important if the upper part of the further member 12<br>
comprises a bolt 22 to which a nut (not shown) may be fastened by rotational relative<br>
movement. Evidently, the coupling means 28 according to the invention should be<br>
strong enough to restrict or counteract such forces.<br>
Fig. 7a to 7f illustrate different variants of the suspension within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
All of the main bodies of the below-described suspension unit or arrangements<br>
comprise magnetic attachment means.<br>
Fig. 7a illustrates a simple box-like suspension according to the invention. The<br>
illustrated embodiment features four screw-hole threads 71, each being suspended in<br>
the main body, so as to permit at least one degree of freedom with respect to<br>
movement.<br>
Fig. 7b illustrates a further one-point suspension comprising a bolt 72 suspended by<br>
means of a coupling means to the main body of the suspension unit.<br>
Fig. 7c illustrates a further two-point suspension comprising two bolts 73 suspended<br>
by means of a coupling means to the main body of the suspension unit. The main<br>
body is rounded so as to fit to the inner surface of a wind turbine tower. The<br>
suspension is illustrated with two ladder fittings (dotted).<br><br>
Fig. 7d illustrates a further one- point suspension. The illustrated suspension is<br>
slightly rounded for the purpose of fitting more accurate to a wind turbine tower,<br>
when fitted.<br>
Fig. 7e illustrates a further one-point suspension. The illustrated suspension<br>
comprises a main body fitted with and arm 75 hinged at the one end to the<br>
suspension unit and at the other end facilitating a rigid attachment to mechanical<br>
structures. The arm 75 comprises a built-in spring/damper forming the coupling<br>
between the first and the further member according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 7f illustrates a further one-point suspension according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The illustrated embodiment may basically comprise a main body<br>
substantially as described in fig. 2a and the following figures mounted on a base<br>
plate 76. The base plate reduces the stress on the magnetic attraction between the<br>
suspension and the foundation when the directions of the forces are orientated other<br>
than in the direction of the normal forces (normal: with respect to the base plate).<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a further embodiment of the invention.<br>
The illustrated embodiment comprises an arrangement being primarily adapted for<br>
reducing undesired static stress and the magnetic attachment induced due to slight<br>
misalignment or geometrically misfit between first mam body of the suspension and<br>
the structures intended for attachment to the suspension. The illustrated embodiment<br>
of the invention comprises a main body, e.g. substantially as described in fig. 2a or<br>
one of the other embodiments described in fig. 7a-7f, in which a further member 12<br>
is encapsulated for rotation by means of a conventional ball- and socket joint. The<br>
further member comprises a spherical body 81 held in a socket 83 and rigidly<br>
coupled with a projection 82. Mechanical structures may be fitted to the projection<br>
82.<br>
If a mechanical structure is fitted to the suspension, the further member will<br>
automatically be aligned to fit to the orientation of the fitting or the mechanical<br><br>
structures to be fitted to the projection 82. In this way, undesired static induction of<br>
"rotational" forces in the main body may be avoided. The coupling means according<br>
to the invention is here formed by the geometrically mutually fitting between the first<br>
and the further member.<br>
Figs. 9a and 9b illustrate two principal main force directions Fv and FN acting on a<br>
suspension unit 90 in an attachment according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Vertical fixation must counteract the vertical forces Fv on the structure. Vertical<br>
forces to be counteracted may e.g. typically result from the gravity. According to the<br>
invention, such forces may both be counteracted by means of mechanical forces and<br>
by magnetically forces established between the suspension and the wind turbine<br>
tower. When dealing with heavy suspended structures, a typical application within<br>
the scope of the invention would imply traditional mechanical attachment in the<br>
vertical direction, e.g. with respect to ladders, etc.<br>
Normal forces FN acting on the suspension unit 90 may according to the invention<br>
preferably be counteracted by means of magnetic attraction. The magnetic attraction<br>
In the normal force direction (numerically) may be exploited further, if friction<br>
members are applied between the suspension unit 90 and the corresponding magnetic<br>
tower portion. Hence, according to well-known relationships between normal force<br>
FN and the frictions, transverse force is established to counteract e.g. rotational<br>
movements (tangential movement tm) of e.g. a platform or a ladder suspension.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates some of the properties of different permanent magnetic materials.<br>
The illustrated diagram illustrates the behavior of six groups of magnetic materials,<br>
G1 to G6 at a temperature of approximately 20 degrees Celsius. The x-axis<br>
represents HcJ (Coercivity [kA/m] and the y-axis represents maximum energy<br>
product | BH|max. [kJ/m3], where | BH | max represents the energy potential of the<br>
material, whereas HcJ represents the material's ability to resist demagnetizing fields.<br><br>
Group Gl comprises so-called Neodym magnets, NdFeB. The Neodym magnets are<br>
some of the most powerful permanent magnets on the market.<br>
Groups G2 and G3 comprise SmxCoy magnets characterized by a high degree of<br>
stability with respect to variation in temperature. Group G2 refers to Sm2Co17 and<br>
Group G3 refers to SmCo5.<br>
Group G4 refers to a further group of so-called low Hc-SmxCoy magnets, Sm2Co17.<br>
Group G5 comprises a group of plastic-bounded Neodym magnet material NdFeB.<br>
Finally, group G6 comprises more traditional magnet materials such as Alnico and<br>
FeSr/FeBa materials.<br>
Different magnetic materials may be applied in a suspension unit according to the<br>
invention.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the applied permanent<br>
magnetic materials are primarily selected from materials featuring a high-energy<br>
potential | BH | max. Hence, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
materials are chosen from group Gl, i.e. the Neodym magnets.<br>
Evidently, if for instance temperature variations become critical, Samariurn-Cobalt<br>
magnets may be preferred.<br>
According to the invention, suspension units may e.g. be combined with units having<br>
magnets from different groups, thereby creating a degree of redundancy.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates one of several applicable types of coupling means between the first<br>
member 11a further member 12 within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, the first member 11 (as described in fig. 1)<br>
is magnetically and rigidly attached to a foundation. The further member 12 is<br>
coupled to the first member 11 by means of a coupling means 13 comprising a<br>
damper 110 and an elastic member 111 in parallel. Numerous other configurations of<br>
mass/damper/spring systems may form the coupling means according to the<br>
invention. The above-illustrated embodiment should in no way be regarded as the<br>
only embodiments applicable within the scope of the invention. Several other<br>
embodiments may be applied.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates an advantageous embodiment of the invention.<br>
The figure illustrates a cross-section of a wind turbine tower section 131. According<br>
to the illustrated embodiment, a ladder 113 is fixated to the inner surface 30 of the<br>
wind turbine tower section 13. The ladder is suspended mechanically in two<br>
suspensions to the tower section, an upper mechanical suspension 31 and a lower<br>
mechanical suspension 32.<br>
Bolting, welding, etc may e.g. obtain the suspension of the ladder to the tower.<br>
Moreover the ladder is suspended in the tower by means of a number of wind turbine<br>
suspension units 20, e.g. illustrated in fig. 2a and fig.8, or derivatives thereof,<br>
The units 20 are attached to the inner surface by means of magnetic forces<br>
established by the magnets of the units 20, and the ladder may be attached to the<br>
units 20 e.g. by means of the fittings 22 of the units 20.<br>
Basically, it may be appreciated that the main fixation in the vertical direction is<br>
obtained by means of mechanical end-point fixation to the tower, the upper flange<br>
132 and lower flange 131 of the tower section 31, while the transverse fixation (i.e.<br>
the non-vertical) is obtained magnetically by means of the units 20.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment the vertical mechanical stress is primarily<br>
created by traditional mechanical attachment to the tower, e.g. by welding and/or<br><br>
bolting, while fixation of the ladder 31 is primarily obtained by magnetic fixation to<br>
the inner surface 30 of the tower section 13.<br>
The distance between the suspension units 20 in the vertical direction may e.g. be<br>
between 0.5 meter and 4 meters depending on the requirements to the fixation. A<br>
preferred vertical distance is between 1.5 to 2.3 meters. Evidently, a suspension unit<br>
according to the invention may be applied for fixation of several other interior<br>
components than the illustrated ladder.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, a ladder construction may e.g.<br>
be fixated to the tower by the above-described provisions and the further interior<br>
components such as lamps, power cables, generators, etc. may then be fixated to the<br>
ladder construction itself by traditional attachment mechanics, welding, bolting etc.<br>
Today, most modern wind turbine towers are conical tubular steel towers. Typically,<br>
modern tower weights are 40 metric tonnes for a 50 m tower for a turbine with a 44<br>
m rotor diameter (e.g. a 600 kW wind turbine), and 80 metric tonnes for a 60 meters<br>
tower for a 72 m rotor diameter (e.g. a 2000 kW wind turbine). The illustrated tower<br>
may e.g. be an 80 (eighty) metric tonnes tower. The lower and upper diameters may<br>
e.g. be approximately 4.2 meters and 2.3 meters, respectively. It should be<br>
emphasized that the illustrated wind turbine tower and the illustrated choice of<br>
dimensions should in no way be regarded as restriction of the invention to the<br>
illustrated tower.<br>
A platform within a wind turbine tower may e.g. be attached at the end portion of the<br>
towers, e.g. flanges, by means of wires fixed to the platform at the lower end and to<br>
the flanges at the upper end. Thus, vertically, the platform is mechanically attached<br>
to the flange and hanging in the wires, whereas the platform comprises permanent<br>
magnetic suspension units providing magnetic fixation of the platform with respect<br>
to non-vertical excitation forces of the platform.<br><br>
