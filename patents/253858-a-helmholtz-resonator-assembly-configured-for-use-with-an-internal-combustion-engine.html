ADJUSTABLE HELMHOLTZ RESONATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to an adjustable Helmholtz resonator<br>
configured for use with an internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Various methods may be employed to reduce the intake noise of an<br>
internal combustion engine. One method is to use a Helmholtz resonator on an intake<br>
air pipe configured to communicate intake air to the internal combustion engine. The<br>
intake air pipe is typically disposed upstream from an intake manifold and is configured<br>
to communicate intake air to the intake manifold of the internal combustion engine. A<br>
Helmholtz resonator includes a resonance volume or chamber having a small opening,<br>
typically referred to as a neck. The neck is operable to enable communication between<br>
the resonance chamber and the intake air pipe. Sound waves generated by components<br>
within the internal combustion engine travel along the intake air pipe where their<br>
acoustic pressure impinges on the neck and excites a mass of air within the neck. The<br>
acoustic pressure within the resonance chamber reacts against the air mass within the<br>
neck and produces an out-of-phase acoustic pressure at the intake air pipe to cause<br>
cancellation of intake noise at the resonant frequency. In this way, some of the engine<br>
noise is eliminated as the out-of-phase acoustic pressures in the intake air pipe cancel<br>
each other.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A Helmholtz resonator assembly is provided having a housing partially<br>
defining at least one volume and a first generally cylindrical sleeve member disposed<br>
within the housing and further defining the at least one volume. A second generally<br>
cylindrical sleeve member is generally coaxially disposed within the generally<br><br>
GP-309089-PTE-JK<br>
2<br>
cylindrical first sleeve member and defines a passage through which a gas may pass.<br>
The second generally cylindrical sleeve member is selectively and variably movable<br>
between a first position and a second position with respect to the first generally<br>
cylindrical sleeve member. At least one orifice is defined by the first generally<br>
cylindrical sleeve member and at least one other orifice is defined by the second<br>
generally cylindrical sleeve member. The second generally cylindrical sleeve member<br>
is operable to substantially block the at least one orifice to prevent communication<br>
between the at least one volume and the passage when the second generally cylindrical<br>
sleeve member is in the first position. The at least one other orifice of the second<br>
generally cylindrical sleeve member is operable to unblock the at least one orifice to<br>
allow communication between the at least one volume and the passage when the second<br>
generally cylindrical sleeve member is in the second position. The at least one orifice,<br>
the at least one other orifice, and the at least one volume cooperate to form at least one<br>
Helmholtz resonator when the at least one orifice is unblocked by the second generally<br>
cylindrical sleeve member. An actuator responsive to signals from a controller may be<br>
provided. The actuator is preferably configured to selectively and variably move the<br>
second sleeve member between the first position and the second position.<br>
[0004]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

combustion engine having an intake system with an adjustable Helmholtz resonator<br>
assembly disposed therein;<br>
[0006]	Figure 2 is a perspective three quarter sectional view of the adjustable<br>

[0007]	Figure 3 is a perspective three quarter sectional view of the adjustable<br>
Helmholtz resonator assembly of Figure 2 illustrating the Helmholtz resonator assembly<br>
in an active state.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0008]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures there is schematically depicted<br>
in Figure 1 an internal combustion engine 10. The internal combustion engine 10 may be<br>
configured to operate in one of a spark-ignited or compression-ignited mode of operation.<br>
The internal combustion engine 10 includes an intake system 12 operable to<br>
communicate a gas, such as intake air 14 to a plurality of cylinders 16 defined by an<br>
engine block 18 of the internal combustion engine 10. The internal combustion engine<br>
10 further includes an exhaust system 20 operable to exhaust or extract products of<br>
combustion 22 from the cylinders 16.<br>
[0009] The intake system 12 includes an air box 24 configured to hold a filter<br>
element 26 operable to filter or remove particulate matter from the intake air 14 prior to<br>
introduction to a Helmholtz resonator assembly 28. The Helmholtz resonator assembly<br>
28 is configured to mount to a supercharger assembly 29. The supercharger assembly 29<br>
operates to increase the volume of intake air 14 communicated to an intake manifold 30<br>
thereby increasing the volumetric efficiency of the internal combustion engine 10. The<br>
intake manifold 30 is operable to distribute or communicate intake air 14 to the cylinders<br>
16.<br>
[0010]	The Helmholtz resonator assembly 28 is adjustable, that is, can be<br>
switched from an active state, wherein noise producing pressure pulsations within the<br>
intake air 14 are substantially attenuated, to an inactive state, wherein the noise producing<br>
pressure pulsations within the intake air 14 are not attenuated. This is especially<br>
beneficial in instances where the internal combustion engine 10 is supercharged. The<br>
supercharger 29 may produce a high pitched "whine" which may be objectionable to<br>
some individuals, but not others. The Helmholtz resonator assembly 28 allows the<br>
flexibility to selectively attenuate this whine should the vehicle operator find it<br><br>
GP-309089-PTE-JK<br><br>
4<br><br>
objectionable. An actuator 32 is configured to adjust the Helmholtz resonator assembly<br>
28 in response to signals received from a controller 34. The construction and operation<br>
of the Helmholtz resonator 28 will be described in greater detail hereinbelow with<br>
reference to Figures 2 through 3.<br>
[0011]	Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, there is shown a three quarter sectional<br>
view of the Helmholtz resonator assembly 28. The Helmholtz resonator assembly 28<br>
includes a housing 36 partially defining a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth<br>
chamber or volume 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48, respectively. A first generally cylindrical<br>
sleeve member 50 is disposed within the housing 36 and further defines each of the first,<br>
second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48. A second<br>
generally cylindrical sleeve member 52 is coaxially disposed within the first sleeve<br>
member 50. The second sleeve member 52 is rotatably movable within the first sleeve<br>
member 50, as indicated by arrows 54. The second sleeve member 52 defines a passage<br>
56 through which the intake air 14 passes.<br>
[0012]	The first sleeve member 50 defines a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and<br>
sixth plurality of orifices 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68, respectively, while the second sleeve<br>
member 52 defines a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth plurality of orifices 70,<br>
72, 74, 76, 78, and 80, respectively. The second sleeve member 52 is movable between a<br>
first position, as shown in Figure 2, and a second position, as shown in Figure 3. With<br>
the second sleeve member 52 in the first position, the second sleeve member substantially<br>
blocks the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48<br>
from communicating with the passage 56 through the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and<br>
sixth plurality of orifices 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68. Therefore, with the second sleeve<br>
member 52 in the first position the Helmholtz resonator assembly 28 is in an inactive<br>
state and no attenuation of noise producing pressure pulsations within the intake air 14<br>
occurs.<br>
[0013]	With the second sleeve member 52 in the second position the first, second,<br>
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth plurality of orifices 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68 of the first<br>
sleeve member 50 are aligned with the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth plurality<br>
of orifices 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80 of the second sleeve member 52. Therefore, the<br><br>
GP-309089-PTE-JK<br>
5<br>
second sleeve member 52 allows the communication between the first, second, third,<br>
fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 and the passage 56. As such,<br>
respective first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth plurality of orifices 58, 60, 62, 64,<br>
66, and 68; first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth plurality of orifices 70, 72, 74, 76,<br>
78, and 80; and first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and<br>
48 cooperate to form first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Helmholtz resonators 82,<br>
84, 86, 88, 90, and 92, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, with the second<br>
sleeve member 52 in the second position the Helmholtz resonator assembly 28 is in an<br>
active state to allow the attenuation of noise producing pressure pulsations within the<br>
intake air 14 to occur.<br>
[0014]	The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth plurality of orifices 70, 72,<br>
74, 76, 78, and 80, defined by the second sleeve member 52, may include slot-like<br>
orifices to permit the second sleeve member 52 to unblock the first, second, third, fourth,<br>
fifth, and sixth plurality of orifices 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, and 68 in a staggered or step-like<br>
fashion as the second sleeve moves from the first position to the second position thereby<br>
enabling variable tuning of the Helmholtz resonator assembly 28. As illustrated in<br>
Figures 2 and 3, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes 38, 40, 42, 44, 46,<br>
and 48 are of different sizes; therefore, a plurality of frequencies may be attenuated by<br>
the Helmholtz resonator assembly 28 when in the active state. The housing 36 and the<br>
first and second sleeve members 50 and 52 are preferably formed from plastic. The<br>
housing is configured to be mounted within the intake system 12 of the internal<br>
combustion engine 10, shown schematically in Figure 1, by a coupling member 94. The<br>
coupling member 94 is preferably formed from an elastomeric material such as rubber.<br>
Preferably, the actuator 32, shown in Figure 1, would effect movement of the second<br>
sleeve member 52, through the coupling member 94. In this way, a seal is maintained<br>
within the intake system 12 to prevent the leakage of ambient air into the intake air 14.<br>
Actuation may be effected by pressing a lever, not shown, attached to the second sleeve<br>
member 52 through the coupling member 94. Additionally, actuation may be effected via<br>
a solenoid, not shown, acting on the second sleeve member 52 via a ferrous plunger, not<br>
shown, or lever, not shown. Although the second sleeve member 52 is shown in Figures<br><br>
GP-309089-PTE-JK<br>
6<br>
2 and 3 to rotate within the first sleeve member 50 between the first and second position,<br>
movement of the second sleeve member 52 in the axial position is also envisioned. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the housing 36 and the first and second sleeve members 50 and 52<br>
are formed from plastic; however, those skilled in the art will recognize other materials<br>
may be used, such as aluminum, while remaining within the scope of that which is<br>
claimed.<br>
[0015]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
