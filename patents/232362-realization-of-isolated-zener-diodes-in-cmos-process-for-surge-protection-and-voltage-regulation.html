				<td>This invention relates to an isolated zener diode prepared in the CMOS process during the manufacture of a CMOS device. The zener diode so prepared is useful in the CMOS circuits such as rectifier circuits, analog circuits for voltage regulation and emf protection of an inductor circuits.<br>
normally   in  a  CMOS  complementry   metal   oxide semiconductor  technology,  the  diodes  available   are drain-substrate  junction diodes and the  wel1-substrate diodes  where background concentration is guite high  to cause  zener  breakdown. By using   additional  implant, which would also otherwise be reguired for high  voltage process,  a  good  zener diode can  be  realised.  These components  can be of great use in analog  circuits  for voltage  regulations,  rectification  and  high  voltage drive circuitry.<br>
There  are  disadvantages   associated   with  the conventional  zener diodes wherein both polarity of  the signal cannot be applied across the diode i.e. they  can be  operated only in reverse bias mode  with one  of the electrode tied to substrate potential.<br>
Another disadvantage associated with the zener diode with source to well junction diodes is that it is dangerous to use in forward bias condition which give rise to high substrate current.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to realize a isolated zener diode using CMOS process and without any additional masking or process steps in the preparation of I.C. components.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a zener diode with good regulation characteristics for use in analog circuits.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a diode for input surge protection in an automobile circuitry.<br>
According to this invention there is provided realization of isolated zener diodes in CMOS process for surge protection and voltage regulation comprising isolated P-well provided for each diode (Dl, D2, D3, D4). The said diodes being ananged in series with identical layout and close to each other, and each diodes having implant along with P+ and N+ source/drain, when 24 V is applied at cathode with anode grounded along with P-well, then the voltage at various nodes is 6V, 12V, 18V, and 24V with single diodes breakdown of 6V.<br>
the diode with isolated P-wel1 in a single N-substrate characterised fay applying 24 V is applied at cathode with anode grounded along with P-well, the voltage at various nodes is 6V, 12V, 18V, and 24V with single diodes breakdown of 6V.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non limiting examplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>

In conventional CMOS technology the following diodes (Fig.l) are available:<br>
i. Source ( or drain) to   well junction diodes (Dl) ii . Source ( or drain) to substrate diode (D2) iii. Well substrate diode (D3)<br>
Diodes D2 and D3 are having their ono of the electrodes as substrate. But, in any VLSI ci rcuitj subatrace  will be<br>
at fixed bias i.o. at VDD it it is N-sub, and at Vss   it it Is<br>
P-sub. This implies that a.c. signal can not be applied ac-ross this dioda i.e. this can be operated only in the reverse bias moda with one of the electrode tied to substrate potential. On the other hand n  /P- well  diode (Dl) is dangerous to use in forward bias condition because n<br>
forms a high gain vertical npn transistor with collector tied to VDD    . Base of this transistor has sufficient intrinsic as well as extrinsic resistance. Therefore emitter-base (E-B) junction if forward biased will immediately switch npn "ON" and the terminal' "A" will get shorted to N-substrate giving rise to high substrate current.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the cros. sectional diagram of the<br>
structure used here to realise isolated zener diode. Emitter<br>
 base (p+ -n)diode of the pnp transistor with n  — concentration base (p  -n) diode of the pnp transistor with n<br>
of 8El8/Cm gives very good zenor diode characteristics. This structure can be realized without any additional masking or process steps in SCL's analog high voltage (15V)  process. This zener diode wai found to have good regulation characteristics. This diode has been used successfully as a  5.6V regulating<br>
zener and also for input: surge protection in a automobile circuit.<br>
In case the doping density of both sides of a p-n junction is high and the diode is reverse biased then.<br>
a.   Field across the diode junction increases to high level (  106   V/Cm).<br>
b.  Depletion width is very narrow( generally less than 100A) because of. high doping concentration on both sides.<br>
Under this circumstances the breakdown  phenomenon can be explained based on field emission theory. According to this theory/ electrons and holes generated because of break ing of covalent bonds in the depletion region due to high electric field can tunnel  directly to the othec side. This causes early reserse breakdown of such diodes. Zener action can take place only at voltage less that 4E9 / q. (4.4 volts for Si),<br>
where E9  is the bandgap and q is electron charge, when field<br>
reaches of the order of 1E6  V/Cm and depletion width is less<br>
than 300A. If these conditions are not satisfied,  avalanche breakdown play dominant role. For example if the depletion width is more than 300A then breakdown phenomenon may be pure avalanche or a combination of tunneling (zener action) and avalanche phenomena.<br>
In a CMOS technology the well and substrate concentration ranges from 1E15 to 5E16 per Cm" . As shown in Table 1 Zener breakdown of p   /substrate ( or well) will not be possible without an additional implant to raise the concentration to about 8E18 per Cm" .<br>

In SCL's analog high voltage (15V) 3µm process (C3H) an additional phosphorus implant. (Dose = 3El4/Cm  , Energy = 75KeV) is U3»d to achieve higher snapback/ by employing double diffused drain (DUD) structure. As shown in Fig. 2, making use of this implant along with p  source/drain implant (Boron 3El5/Cm2 , 25KeV) and n+  source/drain (  As/ 91315/Cm', 75KeV) a vertical pnp transistor with isolated collector haa been realised. The n junction depth and sheet resistivity are 0.9A m and 180 Ohm/sq respectively. Emitter-base (p-n) diode of this pnp transistor with n peak concentration of 8El8/Cm  gives very good zener diode characteristics.<br><br>
The t-v characteristics of this zener (10µ mx 10µm)is  The I-V characteristics <br>
of this zener ( 10' mx 10/ m) is<br>
shown in Fig. 3. A zener breakdown of  5.63 volts has been obtained. 98. 6t load regulation, which can be defined as,<br>
1-  (VZ - V1) /  V 2 *100, has been obtained. The values of<br>
  V1=5.63v corronponding to 80µ load current and v2   6.71v.<br>
corresponding   to   l.8mA   load   current   have  baon   taken   from<br>

Rz ( Reverse resistance)	= 41.8 Ohm<br>
RF (Forward resistance)	= 24.5 Ohm<br>
There are various applications of the isolated Zener d iodes.<br>
The Zener diode described here is of great use in analog and mixed signal ICs where voltage  regulation, surge protection arid voltage rectification are difficult to achieve by conventional diodes or by other structures. This structure can be used for realizing regulating, input surge protection, rectifier and reverse EMF protection zener.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 , a single zener diode has been used for tapping 5.6 V regulated supply ( to the low  voltage logic circuit of the 1C) from 8 to 24 input supply. The characteristics have been shown in Fig. 3.<br>
A combination of 4 such diodes have been used to form a 23V zener to protect a circuit from high voltage and current surge. The schematic is shown in fig. 5. The design and layout have been done such a way that the diodes have maximum periphery so that it can handle higher current and the zener<br>
resistance R  is low. The diode has been designed for 40 mA z<br>
absolute rating. Tentative sizes have bean obtained by doing<br>
a detailed simulation using HSPICE circuit simulator having z*ner diode model. However actual size is about 25% bigger than that of simulated one. This increase of size  had to be done to accommodate required number of contacts as it has to withstand high operating current which flows through metal, contacts and then silicon. It has been seen that the current handling capacity is  mainly determined by total contact area avaailable as the failure occurs due to blow-up of contacts. Forlorn metal thickness and 3µm  x  3 µm  contact sizes the maximum absolute d.c. current rating per contact has been found to be around 1mA. Based on this 40 contacts oE 3µ m  x 3µm  each have been accomndated for each diode.<br>
These diodss when configured in series must have perfectly matching reverse characteristics. Therefore layout for each diods has to be identical and thase diodes have to be as close to each other as possible. It has been seen that isolated P-well has to be as close to each other as possible. It has been seen that isolated P - well has to be provided for each diode as shown in Fig. 6. It may be tempting to use a single P-well for all 4 diodes as   it will reqaire less area (Fig.7).However this is not advisable because when 24V is applied at cathode with anode grounded along with P-well, then the voltage at various nodes will be 6V, 12V, 18V and 24V ( assuming sinqle diode breakdown of 6V). This will result 24V appearing across n/Pwell junction of D. diode  which is more than the junction breakdown (21V) . Moreover because of varying depletion widths in from<br>
D1 to D4 the diode   clincactor intico   will   not   bo   matching  . Therefore  configuration shown   in Fig.   6  should  be   ursed. Minimum  distance   between   two  wells  will   be   governed   by minimum geometrical  design   rules   from  the  consideraton of punchthrouqh   voltage  between   two  walls   at   different   potentials. The   nuchthrough   voltage  must   be   more  than   the   zener   breakdown    which   is  5.6V   in   this   case.   The   I-V   characteristics   of   this structure  is   shown   in   fiq.   8.<br>
As   discuss      in   section  2   diodes   available   in   conventional CMOS  processes  cannot  be   used   for  forward   bias  operation.   In case  of  rectifier  and  reverse  emf  protection  applications<br>
the   configuration  shown   in  fig.   9  and  fig.   10   are  generally used.     It  is  clear  that all  the  diodes     are  required  to operate<br>
in   forward  bias  as    well  as  reverse bias mode.     In  such applications  zener  diodes  developed  by  the  inventors  and<br>
described here will   be  of great help  as  these  can be  integrated in  the  chip  so  that  reliability  can  be  enhanced  and  also component  count  can  be  reduced.<br><br><br>
