DESCRIPTION<br>
ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENCE DEVICE AND ANTHRACENE<br>
DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescence device and an anthracene derivative and, more particularly, to an electroluminescence device exhibiting a great efficiency of light emission and having a long life and an anthracene derivative providing the device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An organic electroluminescence ("electroluminescence" will be occasionally referred to as "EL", hereinafter) device is a spontaneous light emitting device which utilizes the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by energy of recombination of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is applied. Since an organic EL device of the laminate type driven under a low electric voltage was reported by C. W. Tang of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Volume 51, Pages 913, 1987), many studies have been conducted on organic EL devices using organic materials as the constituting materials. Tang et al. used a laminate structure using tris(8-hydroxyquinolinol)aluminum for the light emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer. Advantages of the laminate structure are that the efficiency of hole injection into the light emitting layer can be increased, that the<br><br>
efficiency of forming excited particles which are formed by blocking and recombining electrons injected from the cathode can be increased, and that excited particles formed within the light emitting layer can be enclosed. As the structure of the organic EL device, a two-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer and a three-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known. To increase the efficiency of recombination of injected holes and electrons in the devices of the laminate type, the structure of the device and the process for forming the device have been studied.<br>
As the light emitting material, chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum, coumarine derivatives, tetraphenyl-butadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives and oxadiazole derivatives are known. It is reported that light in the visible region ranging from blue light to red light can be obtained by using these light emitting materials, and development of a device exhibiting color images is expected (For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. Heisei 8(l996)-239655, Heisei 7(1995)-138561 and Heisei 3(l991&gt;200289).<br>
A device using a phenylanthracene derivative as the light emitting material is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 8(1996)-012600. This anthracene derivative is used as the material for emitting bluish light, but an increase in the life of the device have been desired. A compound having fluoranthene group at the 9- and 10-positions of anthracene is disclosed as the material for the device in Japanese   Patent   Application   Laid-Open   No.    2001-257074.       This<br><br>
compound is also used as the material for emitting bluish light, but an increase in the life of the device have also been desired. It is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-182776 that various anthracene derivatives are used as the hole transporting material. However, these derivatives have not been actually synthesized, and the evaluation of these compounds as the light emitting material has not been made.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems and has an object of providing an EL device exhibiting a great efficiency of light emission and has a long life and an anthracene derivative providing the device.<br>

The present invention has been completed based on this knowledge.<br>

Among the   above   constructions,   construction   (8)   is  preferable. However, the construction of the organic EL device is not limited to those<br><br>
shown above as the examples.<br>
In general, the organic EL device is prepared on a substrate which transmits light. The substrate which transmits light is the substrate which supports the organic EL device. It is preferable that the substrate which transmits light has a transmittance of light of 50% or greater in the visible region of 400 to 700 nm. It is also preferable that a flat and smooth substrate is used.<br>
As the substrate which transmits light, for example, glass plates and synthetic resin plates are advantageously used. Examples of the glass plate include plates made of soda lime glass, glass containing barium and strontium, lead glass, aluminosilicate glass, borosilicate glass, barium borosilicate glass and quartz. Examples of the synthetic resin plate include plates made of polycarbonate resins, acrylic resins, polyethylene terephthalate resins, polyether sulfide resins and polysulfone resins.<br>
As the anode, an electrode made of a material such as a metal, an alloy, a conductive compound and a mixture of these materials which has a great work function (4 eV or more) is preferable. Specific examples of the material for the anode include metals such as Au and conductive materials such as Cul, ITO (indium tin oxide), Sn02, ZnO and In*Zn*0.<br>
The anode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the electrode material described above in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process and the sputtering process. When the light emitted from the light emitting layer is obtained through the anode, it is preferable that the anode has a transmittance of the emitted light greater than 10%. It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the anode is several hundred<br><br>
 or smaller.    The thickness of the anode is, in general, selected in the<br>
range of 10 nm to 1 μm and preferably in the range of 10 to 200 nm.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable<br>
that a layer of a chalcogenide, a metal halide or a metal oxide (this layer<br>
may occasionally be referred to as a surface layer) is disposed on the<br>
surface of at least one of the pair of electrodes prepared as described above.<br>
Specifically, it is preferable that a layer of a chalcogenide (including an<br>
oxide) of a metal such as silicon and aluminum is disposed on the surface<br>
of the anode at the side of the light emitting layer, and a layer of a metal<br>
halide or a metal oxide is disposed on the surface of the cathode at the<br>
side of the light emitting layer.    Due to the above layers, stability in<br>
driving can be improved.<br>
Preferable examples of the chalcogenide include SiOx (l^x^2),<br>
A10x , SiON and SiAlON.    Preferable examples of the metal<br>
halide  include  LiF,  MgF2,   CaF2  and  fluorides  of rare  earth  metals.<br>
Preferable examples of the metal oxide include Cs20, I^O, MgO, SrO,<br>
BaO and CaO.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable that a mixed region of an electron transfer compound and a reducing dopant or a mixed region of a hole transfer compound and an oxidizing dopant is disposed on the surface of at least one of the pair of electrodes prepared as described above. Due to the mixed region disposed as described above, the electron transfer compound is reduced to form an anion, and injection and transportation of electrons from the mixed region into the light emitting medium can be facilitated. The hole transfer compound is oxidized to form a cation, and injection and transportation of<br><br>
holes from the mixed region into the light emitting medium is facilitated. Preferable examples of the oxidizing dopant include various types of Lewis acid and acceptor compounds. Preferable examples of the reducing dopant include alkali metals, compounds of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and compounds of these metals.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the light emitting layer has the following functions-<br>
(1)	The injecting function- the function of injecting holes from the anode or<br>
the hole injecting layer and injecting electrons from the cathode or the<br>
electron injecting layer when an electric field is applied;<br>
(2)	The transporting function^ the function of transporting injected charges (electrons and holes) by the force of the electric field; and<br>
(3)	The light emitting function: the function of providing the field for recombination of electrons and holes and leading the recombination to the emission of light.<br>
As the process for forming the light emitting layer, a conventional process such as the vapor deposition process, the spin coating process and the LB process can be used. It is particularly preferable that the light emitting layer is a molecular deposit film. The molecular deposit film is a thin film formed by deposition of a material compound in the gas phase or a thin film formed by solidification of a material compound in a solution or in the liquid phase. In general, the molecular deposit film can be distinguished from the thin film formed in accordance with the LB process (the molecular accumulation film) based on the differences in the aggregation structure and higher order structures and functional differences caused by these structural differences.<br><br>
As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Showa 57(1982)-51781, the light emitting layer can also be formed by dissolving a binder such as a resin and the material compounds into a solvent to prepare a solution, followed by forming a thin film from the prepared solution in accordance with the spin coating process or the like.<br>
In the present invention, where desired, the light emitting layer may comprise conventional light emitting materials other than the light emitting material of the present invention, or a light emitting layer comprising other conventional light emitting material may be laminated to the light emitting layer comprising the light emitting material of the present invention as long as the object of the present invention is not adversely affected.<br>
The hole injecting layer and the hole transporting layer are layers which help injection of holes into the light emitting layer and transport the holes to the light emitting region. The layers exhibit a great mobility of holes and, in general, have an ionization energy as small as 5.5 eV or smaller. For the hole injecting layer and the hole transporting layer, a material which transports holes to the light emitting layer at a small strength of the electric field is preferable. A material which exhibits, for example, a mobility of holes of at least 10~6 cm2/V-sec under application of an electric field of 104 to 106 V/cm is preferable. A material can be selected as desired from materials which are conventionally used as the charge transporting material of holes in photoconductive materials and conventional materials which are used for the hole injecting layer in organic EL devices.<br>
To form the hole injecting layer or the hole transporting layer, a<br><br>
thin film may be formed from the material for the hole injecting layer or the hole transporting layer, respectively, in accordance with a conventional process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process and the LB process. The thickness of the hole injecting layer and the hole transporting layer is not particularly limited.    In general, the thickness is 5 nm to 5 (im.<br>
The electron injection layer and the electron transporting layer are layers which help injection of electrons into the light emitting layer, transport electrons to the light emitting region and exhibit a great mobility of electrons. The adhesion improving layer is a layer made of a material exhibiting excellent adhesion with the cathode among the electron injecting layers. As the material for the electron injecting layer, metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline and derivatives thereof are preferable. Examples of the metal complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline and derivatives thereof include metal chelates of oxinoid compounds including chelates of oxine (in general, 8-quinolinol or 8-hydroxyquinoline). For example, tris(8_quinolinol)aluminum can be used as the electron injecting material.<br>
In general, an organic EL device tends to form defects in pixels due to leak and short circuit since an electric field is applied to ultra-thin films. To prevent the formation of the defects, a layer of an insulating thin film may be inserted between the pair of electrodes.<br>
Examples of the material used for the insulating layer include aluminum oxide, lithium fluoride, lithium oxide, cesium fluoride, cesium oxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium fluoride, calcium oxide, calcium fluoride,  aluminum nitride,  titanium oxide,  silicon oxide,  germanium<br><br>
oxide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, molybdenum oxide, ruthenium oxide and vanadium oxide. Mixtures and laminates of the above compounds can also be used.<br>
To prepare the organic EL device of the present invention, for example, the anode, the light emitting layer and, where necessary, the hole injecting layer and the electron injecting layer are formed in accordance with the above processes using the above materials, and the cathode is formed in the last step. The organic EL device may be prepared by forming the above layers in the order reverse to that described above, i.e., the cathode being formed in the first step and the anode in the last step.<br>
An embodiment of the process for preparing an organic EL device having a construction in which an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron injecting layer and a cathode are disposed successively on a substrate transmitting light will be described in the following.<br>
On a suitable substrate transmitting light, a thin film made of a material for the anode is formed in accordance with the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process so that the thickness of the formed thin film is 1 \xm or smaller and preferably in the range of 10 to 200 nm. The formed thin film is used as the anode. Then, a hole injecting layer is formed on the anode. The hole injecting layer can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process or the LB process, as described above. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small.<br><br>
When the hole injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, in general, it is preferable that the conditions are suitably selected in the following ranges- the temperature of the source of the deposition- 50 to 450°C; the vacuum- 10~7 to 10"3 Torr; the rate of deposition- 0.01 to 50 nm/second; the temperature of the substrate* -50 to 300°C and the thickness of the film; 5 nm to 5 jam; although the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition are different depending on the used compound (the material for the hole injecting layer) and the crystal structure and the recombination structure of the hole injecting layer to be formed.<br>
Then, the light emitting layer is formed on the hole injecting layer formed above. Using the light emitting material described in the present invention, a thin film of the light emitting material can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the sputtering process, the spin coating process or the casting process, and the formed thin film is used as the light emitting layer. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable because a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. When the light emitting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, in general, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process can be selected in the same ranges as those described for the vacuum vapor deposition of the hole injecting layer although the conditions are different depending on the used compound. It is preferable that the thickness is in the range of 10 to 40 nm.<br>
An electron injecting layer is formed on the light emitting layer formed above.    Similarly to the hole injecting layer and the light emitting<br><br>
layer, it is preferable that the electron injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process since a uniform film must be obtained. The conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition can be selected in the same ranges as those described for the vacuum vapor deposition of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer.<br>
A cathode is formed on the electron injecting layer formed above in the last step, and an organic EL device can be obtained. The cathode is made of a metal and can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process or the sputtering process. It is preferable that the vacuum vapor deposition process is used in order to prevent formation of damages on the lower organic layers during the formation of the film.<br>
In the above preparation of the organic EL device, it is preferable that the above layers from the anode to the cathode are formed successively while the preparation system is kept in a vacuum after being evacuated.<br>
The organic EL device which can be prepared as described above emits light when a direct voltage of 3 to 40 V is applied in the condition that the anode is connected to a positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to a negative electrode (-). When the connection is reversed, no electric current is observed and no light is emitted at all. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, the uniform light emission is observed only in the condition that the polarity of the anode is positive and the polarity of the cathode is negative. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, any type of wave shape can be used.<br>
