PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing benzimidazolidinone derivatives as muscarinic agents.<br>
[0001] The novel benzimidazolidinone derivatives have been identified as having high affinity for muscarinic M2 and M, receptors. The treatment of mental disorders associated with increasing the activity of a cholinergic receptor using these novel compounds is anticipated. Moreover, these compounds also have dopamine D2 antagonist activity, rendering them particularly interesting as anti-psychotic agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Muscarinic receptors play a critical role in the central nervous system mediating higher cognitive functions, as well as in the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system where they mediate cardiac, respiratory, digestive, and endocrine and exocrine responses. Five distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes have been identified, M1-M5. The muscarinic Mt receptor subtype is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and is believed to be involved in the control of higher cognitive functions; the M2 receptor is the predominant subtype found in heart and is involved in the control of heart rate; the M3 receptor is widely expressed in many peripheral tissues and is believed to be involved in gastrointestinal and urinary tract stimulation as well as sweating and salivation; the M4 receptor is present in brain and may be involved in locomotion; the Ms, receptor is present in the brain where its role is at present poorly defined. Mj and M» have been particularly associated with the dopaminergic system.<br>
[0003] Conditions associated with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, are accompanied by a reduction of acetylcholine content in the brain. This is believed to be the result of degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, which widely innervate multiple areas of the brain, including the association cortices and hippocampus, that are critically involved in higher processes.<br>
[0004] Efforts to increase acetylcholine levels have focused on increasing levels of choline, the precursor for acetylcholine synthesis, and on blocking acetylcholineesterase (AChE), the enzyme that metabolizes acetylcholine. Attempts to augment central cholinergic function through the administration of choline or phosphatidylcholine have not been successful. AChE inhibitors have shown therapeutic efficacy, but have been found to have frequent cholinergic side effects due to peripheral acetylcholine stimulation, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. These gastrointestinal side effects have been observed in about a third of the patients treated. In addition, some AChE inhibitors, such as tacrine, have also been found to cause significant hepatotoxicity with elevated liver transaminases observed in about 30% of patients. The adverse effects of AChE inhibitors have severely limited their clinical utility.<br>
2<br><br>
[0005] The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia suggests that increased dopamine neurotransmission underlies the positive symptoms of the disease and is supported by the evidence that dopamine receptor blockade is effective in ameliorating such psychotic symptoms. Further, drugs that enhance dopamine neurotransmission in the brain cause psychotic-like episodes in man and exacerbate psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. In animal studies, drugs that increase dopamine neurotransmission cause behavioural effects such as increased locomotion, climbing and deficits in prepulse inhibition. Known antipsychotics and dopamine receptor antagonists can block these behavioural effects. Unfortunately, dopamine receptor antagonists also cause severe extrapyramidal side effects in patients as predicted by induction of catalepsy in animal models. These extrapyramidal side effects include tremor, bradykinesia, akithesias, and tardive dyskinesias.<br>
[0006] Due in part to these observations, the discovery of agents with Mi receptor agonist activity has been sought after for the treatment of dementia. However, existing agents lack specificity in their actions at the various muscarinic receptor subtypes. Known Mi muscarinic agonists such as arecoline have also been found to be weak agonists of M2 as well as M3 receptor subtypes and are ineffective in the treatment of cognitive impairment, due in large part to their dose-limiting M2 and M3 receptor mediated side effects.<br>
[0007] Xanomefine (Shannon et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994, 269, 271; Shannon et al., Schizophrenia Res. 2000, 42, 249) is an Mi/M4 preferring muscarinic receptor agonist with little or no affinity for dopamine receptors despite inhibiting A10 but not A9 dopamine cells. The thiadiazole derivative PTAC has been reported (Shannon et al., European Journal of Pharmacology , 1998, 356, 109) to have partial agonist effect at muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors and antagonist effect at muscarinic Mi, M3, and M5 receptors as well as exhibiting functional dopamine antagonism.<br>
[0008] Recently, muscarinic agonists including xanomeline have been shown to be active in animal models with similar profiles to known antipsychotic drugs, but without causing catalepsy (Bymaster et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 356, 109, Bymaster et al., Life Sci. 1999, 64, 527, Shannon et al., J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 1999, 290, 901, Shannon et al., Schizophrenia Res. 2000, 42, 249). Further, xanomeline was shown to reduce psychotic behavioural symptoms such as delusions, suspiciousness, vocal outbursts, and hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease patients (Bodick et al., Arch. Neurol. 1997, 54, 465), however treatment induced side effects that severely limit the clinical utility of this compound.<br>
[0009]	Analogues of 1,2,5-thiadiazole have been reported (Sauerberg et al., J. Med<br>
Chem. 1998, 41, 4378) to have high affinity and selectivity for central muscarinic receptors as well as exhibiting functional dopamine antagonism despite lack of affinity for dopamine receptors.<br>
[0010]	The present investigators have focussed their efforts on the development of a<br>
molecule that simultaneously reduced the positive symptoms and improved the negative symptoms and the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia as a novel treatment of mental<br>
3<br><br>
disorders. It is the intent of the present investigators to demonstrate that muscarinic M1 and/or M4 agonists with combined D2 antagonist activity may possess superior antipsychotic efficacy without the side effects associated with high dose D2 antagonism alone. The D2 antagonist properties of these molecules may contribute to a reduction in the positive symptoms of this disease.<br>
[0011] Based on distribution of M1 and M4 receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (the areas involved in higher order cognitive functions), the M1 and/or M4 agonist properties of these compounds may reduce the cognitive dulling and perhaps ameliorate other negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. (Friedman, Biol. Psychiatry, 1999, 45, 1; Rowley, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, All; Felder, J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4333). This unique combination of central nervous system activities in one molecule is unprecedented and may lead to the development of an entirely new class of antipsychotic drugs, ones with the superior clinical properties without the limiting side-effect profile.<br>

[0022] A second aspect of the invention relates to a method of increasing an activity of a cholinergic receptor comprising contacting the cholinergic receptor or a system containing the cholinergic receptor with an effective amount of at least one compound of Formula I.<br>
[0023] An increase in activity of the cholinergic receptor and the cholinergic system is, as discussed supra, associated to the activity of anti-psychotics. Accordingly, further aspects of the present invention relate to a method of treating or preventing a mental disorder in a mammal, such as a human, comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I and to the use of a compound of Formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition containing either entity, for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylactic or curative treatment of psychosis or alleviation of symptoms of psychosis. In the context of the present invention a mammal may be selected from the group consisting of mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, cows, primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and apes, and humans. Most preferably, the mammal is a human.<br>
[0024] Aspects of the invention relate to compounds of Formula I for use as selective modulators of M1 and/or M4 muscarinic receptors for the treatment of disorders associated with muscarinic receptors and especially with said receptor subtypes.<br>
   8<br><br>
[0025] As stated, compounds of Formula I have surprisingly been found to have selectivity for the M\ and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes. Therapeutic advantages may be derived from this selectivity. Further therapeutic advantages may be derived from the concomitant muscarinic Mx and M4 agonist activity and dopaminergic D2 antagonist activity.<br>
[0026] Compounds of Formula I, by the modulation of muscarinic receptors may be implicated in the control of amyloid precursor processing, in particular by the activation of the Mi receptor. Thus, a further aspect of the present invention relates to a method of modulating or preventing the progression or formation of amyloid plaques in an individual susceptible to or affected by Alzheimer's Disease by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, said effective amount sufficient to modulate amyloid precursor protein processing.<br>

ammonium salt, an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, such as a calcium or a magnesium salt, a salt of organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like.<br>
[0034] A "prodrug" refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety.<br>

[0073] As will be clear to the person skilled in the art, embodiments of compound I may be chiral or comprised of one or more chiral centres. Where the compounds according to the invention have at least one chiral center, they may exist as a racemate, enantiomers or diastermeomers. It should be noted that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for compounds of the present invention may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the present invention may form solvates with water (i.e. hydrates) or common organic solvents. Such solvates are also included in the scope of this invention.<br>
   17<br><br>
[0074] Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, such isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chiral chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by stereoselective synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoy1-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-/?-toluoyl-/-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.<br>
[0075] During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>

In a suitable embodiment, Rx is a C1-8-alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, or hexyl, typically methyl, ethyl or propyl.<br>
[0077] As can be derived from the Examples and from the disclosure herein, the compounds according to Formula I are intended for use as a pharmaceutical. Thus, a further aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound as described herein, together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. Excipients and carriers will depend on, amongst other factors, the route of administration of the compound.<br>
[0078] Compounds of the present invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever specific pharmacological modification of the activity of muscarinic receptors is required.<br>
18<br><br>
[0079] The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of Formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or excipient. Preferably such compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules (including sustained-release or delayed-release formulations), powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, syrups and emulsions, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous), intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation, and may be formulated in an appropriate manner and in accordance with accepted practices such as those disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton PA, 1990. Alternatively, the compositions may be in sustained-release form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. The present invention also contemplates providing suitable topical formulations for administration to, e.g., eye or skin or mucosa.<br>
[0080] For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, flavoring agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include, without limitation, sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
[0081]	For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the active ingredient is mixed<br>
with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, e.g., such as the ones described above, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g., water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. By the term "homogeneous" is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. The solid preformulation composition may then be subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 50 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the present composition may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner core containing the active compound and an outer layer as a coating surrounding the core. The outer coating may be an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the<br>
19<br><br>
inner core to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with conventional materials such as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
[0082] The liquid forms in which the present compositions may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical carriers. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, methylcellulose or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone. Other dispersing agents, which may be employed, include glycerin and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations, which generally contain suitable preservatives, are employed when intravenous administration is desired. The compositions can also be formulated as an ophthalmic solution or suspension formation, i.e., hOeye drops, for ocular administration.<br>
[0083] Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention may be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to persons skilled'in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
[0084] The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the disease or disorder, which is being treated.<br>
[0085] The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 100 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0 or 50.0 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A unit dose typically contains from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient, preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg of active ingredient. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from<br>
20<br><br>
about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
[0086] Compounds according to the present invention may be used alone at appropriate dosages defined by routine testing in order to obtain optimal pharmacological effect on a muscarinic receptor, in particular the muscarinic M1 or M4 receptor subtype, while minimizing any potential toxic or otherwise unwanted effects. In addition, co-administration or sequential administration of other agents, which improve the effect of the compound, may, in some cases, be desirable.<br>
[0087] The pharmacological properties and the selectivity of the compounds of this invention for specific muscarinic receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number of different assay methods using recombinant receptor subtypes, preferably of the human receptors if these are available, e.g., conventional second messenger or binding assays. A particularly convenient functional assay system is the receptor selection and amplification assay disclosed in US 5,707,798 describing a method of screening for bioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells transfected with receptor DNA, e.g., coding for the different muscarinic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a ligand of the receptor. Cell amplification is detected as increased levels of a marker also expressed by the cells.<br>
[0088] An important aspect of the present invention relates to a method of increasing an activity of a cholinergic receptor comprising contacting the cholinergic receptor or a system containing the cholinergic receptor with an effective amount of at least one compound of Formula I, as defined supra. The present investigators have surprisingly found that the compounds of Formula I act as cholinergic agonists and, most remarkably, the compounds of Formula I are selective for the either the Mi or M4, or both the Mi and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes.<br>
[0089] Furthermore, beyond the remarkable selectivity of the compounds of the present invention for the Mi and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes, the present investigators have surprisingly found that compounds of Formula I further act as dopaminergic D2 antagonists or D2 inverse agonists.<br>
[0090] As was discussed earlier, this combined activity (M1 and M4 agonism, dopaminergic D2 antagonism) is an attractive method of treating an array of mental disorders. Consequently, a further important aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating or preventing a mental disorder in a mammal, such as a human, comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.<br>
[0091] Disorders considered to be suitable for treatment by either Mi and/or M4 agonism, or combined M1/M4 agonism and dopaminergic D2 antagonism are selected from the group consisting of cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, depression, pain, sleep disorders, psychosis, and increased intraocular pressure.<br>
21<br><br>
[0092] Further, suitable disorders considered to be suitable and particularly attractive may be selected from the group consisting of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's chorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Pick disease, dementia, clinical depression, age-related cognitive decline, attention-deficit disorder, sudden infant death syndrome, and glaucoma.<br>
[0093] Furthermore the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment of mania, bipolar disorder, unipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder and anxiety. It should be noted that other non-schizophrenic causes of psychosis, including drug induced, those associated with dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders (such as Huntington's) are also anticipated to be suitable.<br>
[0094] The Tic disorders also include a spectrum of disorders including Tourettes and OCD.<br>
[0095]	The affective disorder spectrum, including unipolar, bipolar are also anticipated<br>
to be suitable for treatment using compounds of Formula I.<br>
[0096] An important aspect of the invention therefore relates to the use of a compound according or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition containing either entity, for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylactic or curative treatment of psychosis or alleviation of symptoms associated with psychosis.<br>
[0097] The medicament acts, at least in part, as an Mi agonist or as Mi and M4 agonist. The compound according to Formula I may further act as a D2 antagonist. Thus, an important aspect of the invention relates to a use of compounds of Formula I as Mi and M4 agonist, as well as D2 antagonists. Illustrative examples of compounds with this combined activity are tabulated in Example 1.<br>
[0098] Compounds 61KS19,45NK70, 45NK71, 45NK110, 61KS12 and 61KS13 have high binding efficacy for the Mi and M4 receptor subtypes. Moreover, compounds of Formula I have high selectivity for the Mi and M4 receptor subtypes over M2, M3, M5 receptor subtypes. Further, compounds of Formula I have D2 antagonistic activity.<br>
[0099]	As discussed in Felder et al (J. Med. Chem. 2000), muscarinic receptors may be<br>
implicated in the control of amyloid precursor processing, in particular by activation of the Mi receptor. Thus, a further aspect of the present invention relates to a method of modulating or preventing the progression or formation of amyloid plaques in an individual susceptible to or affected by Alzheimer's Disease by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, said effective amount sufficient to modulate amyloid precursor protein processing.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
[0100] Embodiments of the present invention is disclosed in further detail in the following examples, which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed.<br>
Example 1:       Screening Assay<br>
[0101]	In the present example, methods for R-SAT and radioligand binding are<br>
described. In addition, screening of test compounds in assays using muscarinic receptor subtypes Mi and M4 and dopamine receptor subtype D2 are described.<br>
Methods<br>
[0102]	The M] and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes were cloned substantially as<br>
described by Bonner et al., (1987) Science 273 p. 527 and Bonner et al, (1988) Neuron 1, p. 403. R-SAT assays were carried out substantially as described in U.S. 5,707,798 and by Braiiner-Osborne, H.B. and Brann, M.R. (1995), Eur. J. Pharmacol 295:93-102. NIH-3T3 cells (available from the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC CRL 1658) were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the ml and m4 receptors and plasmid DNA encoding P-galactosidase. Transfected cells were grown in the presence of between 1 nM and 40 uM of the test compound for 5 days. On day 5, the cells were lysed using 0.5% nonidet-P and P-galactosidase expression was quantified using the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-p-D-galactoside (ONGP).<br>
[0103] Data were normalized relative to the maximum response of the cells to the muscarinic agonist carbachol, and the following equation was fitted to the data:<br>
response = minimum + (maximum - minimum)/(l + ([ligand]/EC50))<br>
% Efficacy was defined as (maximum - minimum)/(maximum response of cells to carbachol). pEC50 = -log (EC50). Where data gave a bell-shaped curve, "maximum" was defined as the highest observed response.<br>
[0104] The D2 dopamine receptor subtype was cloned substantially as described by Stormann, Gdula, Weiner and Brann, 1990 [Mol Pharmacol 37, 1-6]. Cell membranes expressing the D2 receptor were prepared by transfecting tSA cells (Chahine, M., Bennet, P. B., George, A. L., Horn, R. (1994) Pfluegers Arch. 421, 136-142) with 10 ug plasmid DNA encoding the human dopamine D2 receptor and 40 pl Superfect (Qiagen). The cells were harvested 48 hours and transfection and membranes were prepared by homogenizing the cells using a Polytron harvester in 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 37,000g. The pellet was homogenized again in 60 ml 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM EDTA. The homogenate was<br>
23<br><br>
centrifuged for 30 minutes at 37,000g. The supernatant was discarded. The pellet was homogenized again in 10 ml 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA. The resultant membranes were frozen at -80°C.<br>
[0105] The membranes were combined with 150 pM [3H]-Spiperone (Amersham-Pharmacia, 107 Ci/mmol) and ligand concentrations between 1 nM and 10 uM, or haloperidol concentrations between 0.1 nM and 1 uM in 460 ul 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 1 uM haloperidol. The membranes were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C, and then filtered onto Packard GFB Filterplates using a Packard harvester. The membranes were dried and 50 ul Microscint (Packard) was added to each well. The amount of bound radioligand was quantified using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter.<br>
[0106] Data were normalized relative to the maximum inhibition of [3H]-Spiperone binding by 1 uM haloperidol, and the following equation was fitted to the data:<br>
% inhibition = minimum + (maximum - minimum)/(l + ([ligand]/[IC5o]))<br>
% inhibition was defined as (maximum - minimum)/(maximum response of cells to haloperidol). pIC50 = -log (IC5o). NT= not tested.<br>

Example 2:       Behavioral Studies<br>
Methods Animals<br>
[0107]        Male Non-Swiss Albino mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were housed (4 mice/cage) in rooms with temperature and humidity controlled and water and food (Harlan Teklad) freely available. Mice were kept on a 12-hr lightdark cycle. Procedure Locomotor Activity<br>
[0108] Plastic 20x20x30cm activity cages were equipped with photocell beams (AccuScan Instruments). For spontaneous activity, 61KS19(1,3 and 10 mg/kg) was administered alone i.p. 30 min before the session. For hyperactivity experiments, mice were treated with 0.3 mg/kg dizocilpine, 3.0 mg/kg d-amphetamine or 3.0 mg/kg scopolamine i.p. 15 min before the session (15 min after 6IKS 19). Locomotor data were collected during a 15 min session without habituation in a lit room. Each dose combination was tested in a separate group of animals (n=8). Distance traveled (cm) was calculated and averaged followed by ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's t-test comparisons.<br>
Catalepsy<br>
[0109] A custom-built 8-mm rod that is raised 3.5 cm from the lab benchtop was used. 6IKS 19 (10 mg/kg) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg) were administered i.p. 60 min before the start of the session. The forepaws of each animal is placed on the rod and the time to step down is measured. If the animal steps off immediately, another attempt is made until the animal stays on for more than 10 sec or 10 attempts have been made. A maximum of 2 min is allowed at which time the animal is taken away from the rod and returned to the homecage. Each dose or dose combination was tested in a separate group of animals (n=6). Averages and standard errors were calculated and compared using an ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's Wests.<br>

Example 3:       Synthetic Procedures<br>
3.1	General preparative LC-MS procedure<br>
[0110] Preparative purification was performed on a Waters auto purification system ( 600 pumps, 2700 sample manager, 996 PDA detector, ZMD massspectrometer).<br>
[0111] The columns used were YMC C18 J'sphere ODS H80. Buffer A was 0.15% TFA in water, buffer B was 0.15% TFA in acetonitrile/water 95/5. The columns were operated at 17 ml/min. Following an initial hold of 2.5 min at 30% buffer B, compounds were separated using a gradient af 30-100% buffer B in 8.5 min. A dual column setup with two pumps was used to equilibrate one column, while running on the other.<br>

[0112] LDA was generated by adding BuLi (20 mL, 1.68M, 32.6 mmol) to a solution of diisopropylamine (2.38 g, 32.6 mmol) in dry THF (lOmL) at -78°C under argon. The mixture was kept at that temperature for 30 min followed by the addition of a solution of N-Bocnortropinone (5.27 g, 23.4 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL). The mixture was then left stirring for lh while maintaining the temperature at 78°C. Then a solution of 2-[N,N-Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amino]-5-chloropyridine (10.08 g, 25.7 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) and the mixture was slowly allowed to reach room temperature overnight and subsequently concentrated and exposed to column chromatography (Si02; EtOAc/heptane 1:6, Rf(product) = 0.31) to give the title compound (104KS22) (6.68 g, 80%) which on prolonged standing crystallised into a white solid.

The mixture was shaken for 2 h followed by filtration and concentration. The residual syrup was taken up in DCM (2 mL) followed by careful addition of TFA (0.5 mL). The mixture was shaken for 10 min before it was concentrated, basified with NaOH (2M, 3 mL), extracted (EtOAc), concentrated and put on an ionexchange column (Varian BondElut®-SCX, H+).
