IN 164194 and US-PS 3,440,690. Also in the field of the combing machine it is<br>
known from IN 175661 and from JP-OS-53-86841 to provide an autoleveller device<br>
for the drafting arrangement installed in the combing machine.<br>
The increasingly rising production rates automatically lead to an increase in the<br>
production speed of the fibre material or the conveying speed of the formed end<br>
produvt (e.g. of a sliver).<br>
This means that the requirements placed on the described autoleveller devices have<br>
continuously risen. The requirements placed on the measuring members for measuring<br>
the fibre masses for detecting short- and long-wave fluctuations in mass have also<br>
risen, for example. This was caused on the one hand by the aforementioned higher<br>
conveying speeds and on the other hand by the increasingly larger supplied masses<br>
which are to be scarmed and also by the risen requirements with respect to the quality<br>
ofthe end product.<br>
The slivers formed in the described machines are usually deposited in cans by way of<br>
special   coiling   apparatuses,   which   are   then   transported   either   manually   or<br>
automatically to a machine downstream for further processing.<br>
There is the requirement, on the one hand, of the formation of an even sliver and, on<br>
the other hand, of depositing an uninterrupted sliver. A sliver breakage in a can creel<br>
leads to additional and undesirable standstill periods in the subsequent processing<br>
process.<br>
With the existing and known autoleveller devices in drafting arrangements it is<br>
possible to achieve	<br><br>
favourable results with respect to the evenness of the formed sliver. However, these results are only partly adequate with respect to the risen requirements concerning quality and a desired coiling. Particularly the piecing positions arising during the detaching and piecing process in the combing machine can be leveled only with a considerable amount of work and partly with several drafting passages. The invention now has the object of providing an apparatus and a method for forming a sliver, which with respect to its evenness is of high quality and which ensures the coiling of an uninterrupted sliver.<br>
In this respect it is proposed that the second drafting arrangement is provided with a control device for compensating short-wave fluctuations in mass which intervenes in the drive of the second drafting arrangement on the basis of the signals issued by the measuring member.<br>
The measuring member, which is arranged downstream of the first drafting<br>
arrangement, is supplied with a reduced fibre mass for the measuring process. In this<br>
way it is possible to also use measurmg members for detecting short-wave fluctuations<br>
in mass, e.g. for detecting piecing positions in the combing machine, which can also<br>
detect the fibre mass with a non-mechanical device. This means that commercially<br>
available, pure electronic or piezo-electronic sensors can be used, which on the basis<br>
of the reduced fibre mass can carry out a very precise detection of occurring<br>
fluctuations in mass. The fluctuations in	<br><br>
piecing which may occur during the piecing process are mutually displaced so that they cannot add up. The fluctuation in mass which may occur during the piecing process is thus halved with respect to the joined sliver.<br>
By using individual electrical drives for the drafting arrangements or the coiling apparatus it is possible to provide a simple separation of certain drive zones in order to separate faulty fibre mass from the process.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are explained in closer detail by reference to the<br>
enclosed embodiments, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic side view of a combing machine with the arrangement<br>
proposed in accordance with the invention.<br>
