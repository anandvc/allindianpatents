				<td>HIGH TEMPERATURE RESISTANT VITREOUS INORGANIC FIBER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The insulation material industry has determined that it is desirable to utilize fibers in heat and sound insulating applications which are not durable in physiological fluids, such as lung fluid. While candidate materials have been proposed, the use temperature limit of these materials have not been high enough to accommodate many of the applications to which high temperature resistant fibers, including vitreous fibers and ceramic fibers, are applied. In particular, high temperature resistant fibers should exhibit minimal linear shrinkage at expected exposure temperatures., in order to provide effective thermal protection to the article being insulated.<br>
Many compositions within the man-made vitreous fiber family of materials have been proposed which are decomposable in a physiological medium. These fibers generally have a significant alkali metal oxide content, which often results in a low use temperature limit.<br>
Canadian Patent Application 2017344 describes a glass fiber having physiological solubility formed from glasses containing as required components silica, calcia and Na2O, as preferred components, magnesia and K2O, and as optional components boria, alumina, titania, iron oxides, and fluoride.<br>
International Publication WO 90/02713 describes mineral fibers which are soluble in saline solutions, the fibers having a composition including silica, alumina, iron oxide, calcia, magnesia, Na2O and K2O.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,108,957 describes glass compositions useful for forming fibers which are able to be degraded in a physiological medium containing as required components silica, calcia, Na2O plus K2O, and boria, and optionally alumina, magnesia, fluoride and P2O5. It describes the presence of phosphorus as having the effect of increasing the rate of decomposition of the fibers in a physiological medium.<br>
Other patents which cite the effect of phosphorus in favoring biological solubility of mineral fibers include International Publication WO 92/09536, describing mineral fibers containing substantially silica and calcia, but optionally magnesia and Na2O plus K2O, in wliich the presence of phosphorus oxide decreases the stabilizing effect of aluminum and iron on the glass matrix. These fibers are typically produced at lower temperatures than refractory ceramic fibers. We have observed that at melt temperatures required for high temperature resistant fibers (1700-2000°C), phosphorus oxide at levels as low as a few percent can cause severe degradation and/or erosion of furnace components.<br>
Canadian Patent Application 2043699 describes fibers which decompose in the presence of a physiological medium, wliich contain silica, alumina, calcia, magnesia, P205, optionally iron oxide, and Na2O plus K2O. French Patent Application 2662687 describe mineral fibers which decompose in the presence of a physiological medium, wliich contain silica, alumina, calcia, magnesia, P2O5, iron oxide and Na2O plus K2O plus Ti02.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,604,097 describes a bioabsorbable glass fiber comprising generally a binary mixture of calcia and phosphorous pentoxide, but having other constituents such as calcium fluoride, water, and one or more oxides such as magnesia, zinc oxide, strontium oxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, lithium oxide or aluminum oxide.<br>
International Publication WO 92/07801 describes a bioabsorbable glass fiber comprising phosphorous pentoxide, and iron oxide. A portion of the P2O5 may be replaced by silica, and a portion of the iron oxide may be replaced by alumina. Optionally the fiber contains a divalent cation compound selected from Ca, Zn and/or Mg, and an alkali metal cation compound selected from Na, K, and/or Li.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,055,428 describes a soda lime aluminoboro-silicate glass fiber composition which is soluble in a synthetic lung solution. Alumina content is decreased with an increase in boria, and an adjustment in silica, calcia, magnesia, K20 and optionally Na2O. Other components may include iron oxide, titania, fluorine, barium oxide and zinc oxide.<br>
International Publication WO 87/05007 describes inorganic fiber having solubility in saline solution and including silica, calcia, magnesia, and optionally alumina. International Publication WO 87/05007 discloses that the fiber composition preferably includes 55-64 weight percent silica. Moreover, none of the exemplary fiber compositions disclosed in WO 87/05007 include greater than 62.7 weight percent silica.<br>
International Publication WO 89/12032 describes inorganic fiber having extractable silicon in physiological saline solution and including silica, calcia, optionally magnesia, alkali metal oxides, and one or more of alumina, zirconia, titania, boria and iron oxides. International Publication WO 89/12032 discloses that the fiber composition preferably includes 35-70 weight percent silica. None of the exemplary fiber compositions disclosed in International Publication WO 89/12032 include greater than 68.01 weight percent silica. The overall objective of both WO 87/05007 and WO 89/12032 was to provide a fiber composition useful as a substitute for traditional mineral wool fibers.<br>
International Publication WO 93/15028 describes vitreous fibers that are saline soluble which in one usage crystallize to diopside upon exposure to 1000°C and/or 800°C for 24 hours and have the composition described in weight percent of silica 59-64, alumina 0-3.5, calcia 19-23 and magnesia 14-17, and which in another usage crystallize to wollastonite/pseudowollastonite aid have the composition described in weight percent of silica 60-67, alumina 0-3.5, calcia 26-35 and magnesia 4-6. International Publication WO 93/15028 discloses that fiber compositions having a silica content greater than 70 weight percent fiberized poorly.<br>
The fibers described in the above identified patent publications are limited, however, in their use temperature, and are therefore unsuitable for high temperature insulation applications, such as furnace linings for use above 1000°C, and reinforcement applications such as metal matrix composites and friction applications.<br>
International Application WO 94/15883 discloses CaO/MgO/SiO2 fibers with additional constituents AI2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2, for which saline solubility and refractoriness were investigated. That document states that saline solubility appeared to<br>
increase with increasing amounts of MgO, whereas ZrO2 and A1203 were detrimental to solubility. The presence of Ti02 (0.71-0.74 mol%) and A1203 (0.51-0.55 mol%) led to the fibers failing the shrinkage criterion of 3.5% or less at 1260°C. The document further states that fibers that are too high in SiO2 are difficult or impossible to form, and cites samples having 70.04, 73.09, 73.28 and 78.07% Si02 as examples which could not be fiberized.<br>
There is no clear teaching in either WO 93/15028 or WO 94/15883 that fiber melt compositions having greater than 71.24 weight percent silica are fiberizable. The poorly fiberized fibers manufactured according to the teachings of WO 93/15028 or WO 94/15883, do not possess adequate shrinkage and/or solubility properties and, therefore, would not be suitable for use as high temperature resistant insulation.<br>
In addition to temperature resistance as expressed by shrinkage characteristics that are important in fibers that are used in insulation, it is also required that the fibers have mechanical strength characteristics during and following exposure to the use or service temperature, that will permit the fiber to maintain its structural integrity and insulating characteristics in use.<br>
One characteristic of the mechanical integrity of a fiber is its after service friability. The more friable a fiber, that is, the more easily it is crushed or crumbled to a powder, the less mechanical integrity it possesses. We have observed that, in general, inorganic fibers that exhibit both high temperature resistance and non-durability in physiological fluids also exhibit a high degree of after service friability. Tins results in the fiber's lacking the strength or mechanical integrity after exposure to the service temperature, to be able to provide the necessary structure to accomplish its insulating purpose.<br>
We have found high temperature resistant, non-durable fibers that do exhibit good mechanical integrity, including after service temperature exposure compression strength and compression recoveiy, according to tests that were performed on them.<br>
Inorganic fiber compositions which may exhibit target durability, shrinkage at temperature, and strength characteristics may not, however, be susceptible to fiberization, either by spinning or blowing from a melt of its components.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,874,375 to Unifrax Corporation, the assignee of the present application, discloses particular inorganic fibers comprising the products of a substantially silica and magnesia fiberizable melt, that are soluble in physiological fluid and have good mechanical characteristics at a high use temperature limit.<br>
A product based on non-durable fiber chemistry has been marketed by Unifrax Corporation (Niagara Falls, New York) under the trademark INSULFRAX, having the nominal weight percent composition of 65% Si02, 31.1% CaO, 3.2% MgO, 0.3% A1203 and 0.3% Fe2O3. Another product is sold by Thermal Ceramics (located in Augusta, Georgia) under the trademark SUPERWOOL, and is composed of 58.5% Si02, 35.4% CaO, 4.1% MgO and 0.7% A1203 by weight. This material has a use limit of 1000°C and melts at approximately 1280°C, which is too low to be desirable for the high temperature insulation purposes described above.<br>
It is desirable to produce a readily manufacturable inorganic vitreous fiber from a fiberizable melt comprising high silica content and calcia that exhibit low shrinkage, low brittleness, superior mechanical strength, such as demonstrated by compression strength and recovery from compression after exposure to service temperatures of 1260°C or higher.<br>
It is desirable according to the present invention to provide high temperature resistant inorganic vitreous fiber, that is readily manufacturable from a melt having a viscosity suitable for blowing or spinning fiber, and which is non-durable in physiological fluids.<br>
It is further desirable according to the present invention to provide high temperature resistant inorganic vitreous fiber, which is non-durable in physiological fluids, and which exhibits high compression strength and recovery from compression after exposure to service temperature.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided inorganic fiber useful as a heat or sound insulation material, which has a temperature use limit up to at least 1330°C and which is non-durable in physiological fluids, such as lung fluid. By non-durable in physiological fluids is meant that the fiber at least partially dissolves in such fluids (such as simulated lung fluid) during in vitro tests.<br>
In order for a inorganic composition to be a viable candidate for producing a satisfactory high temperature inorganic fiber product, the fiber to be produced must be manfacturable, sufficiently soluble in physiological fluids, and capable of surviving high temperatures with minimal shrinkage and minimal loss of integrity. To identify materials that meet these criteria, a set of screening tests were used to identify fibers that exhibit the target properties. These tests include (a) viscosity/fiberization (b) durability, (c) shrinkage at temperature and (d) after-service friability, strength and resilience.<br>
"Viscosity" refers to the ability of a glass melt to resist flow or shear stress. The viscosity-temperature relationship is critical in detennining whether it is possible to<br>
fiberize a given glass composition. An optimum viscosity curve would have a low viscosity (5-50 poise) at the fiberization temperature and would gradually increase as the temperature decreased. If the melt is not sufficiently viscous (i.e., too thin) at the fiberization temperature, the result is a short, thin fiber, with a high proportion of unfiberized material (shot). If the melt is too viscous at the fiberization temperature, the resulting fiber will be extremely coarse (high diameter) and short.<br>
Viscosity-temperature profiles may be measured on a viscometer, capable of operating at elevated temperatures. In addition, an adequate viscosity profile may be inferred by routine experimentation, examining the quality of fiber (index, diameter, length) produced.<br>
The durability test measures the rate at which mass is lost from the fiber (ng/cm2-hr) under conditions which simulate the temperature and chemical conditions found in the human lung. This test consists of exposing approximately O.lg of de-shotted fiber to a 0.3 ml/min flow of simulated lung fluid (SLF). The entire test system is maintained at 37°C, to simulate the temperature of the human body. Tests preferably last for between about two and four weeks.<br>
After the SLF has flowed through the fiber, it is collected and analyzed for glass constituents using Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy. A "blank" SLF sample is also measured and used to correct for elements present in the SLF. Once this data has been obtained, it is possible to calculate the rate at which the fiber has lost mass over the time interval of the study.<br>
Fibers are tested for shrinkage by wet-forming them into a pad, measuring by means of calipers the pad's length and width dimensions (typically 3x5 inches), placing the pad into a furnace, ramping to temperature and holding for a fixed period of time. After heating, the pads are re-measured to determine any changes in dimension, which have occurred.<br>
In one such test, pads were made by mixing about 427 grams fiber, 27.2 grams of phenolic binder and about 4 gallons of water, pouring the mixture into a sheet mold and<br>
allowing the water to drain through the bottom of the mold. The pad was dried and a piece measuring 3 inches by 5 mches by 1 inch was cut. The length and width of this piece were carefully measured, and the pad was placed in a furnace and brought to a service temperature of 1150°C, 1260°C or 1330°C for 24 hours. After cooling, the lateral dimensions were measured and the linear shrinkage was determined by comparing "before" and "after" measurements. If the fiber is available in blanket form, measurements may be made directly on the blanket without the need to form a pad. (Such blanket shrinkage measurements con-elate to, but are not identical to, pad shrinkage measurements.)<br>
After-service friability refers to the ability of fiber to retain its mechanical integrity after exposure to high temperatures. This is an important property, since fiber must support its own weight in any application and must also be able to resist abrasion due to moving air or gas. Indications of fiber integrity and mechanical strength are provided by visual and tactile observations, as well as mechanical measurement of these properties of after-sendee temperature exposed fibers.<br>
Shrinkage pads' after-sendee integrity is indicated by two tests: compression strength and compression recovery. These tests measure, respectively, how easily the pad may be deformed and the amount of resiliency (or compression recovery) the pad exhibits after a compression of 50%.<br>
Shrinkage pads prepared from fibers of the present invention were heated at a tested service temperature, such as 1150°C and 1260°C for 24 hours, and were then compression tested using an Instron testing device. A 2.5 inch diameter cylindrical ram was pushed into the shrinkage pad until the pad was compressed to half its original thickness. At this point, the crosshead was stopped and the peak load (in psi) encountered during compression was recorded.<br>
Compression recovery was then measured by slowly reversing the travel direction of the crosshead and backing the cylindrical ram out of the shrinkage pad until the load reading was zero. The distance of travel from'the 50% compression point to the<br>
zero load point was recorded and expressed as a percentage of original pad thickness. This number is indicative of the amount of resiliency of the fiber pad.<br>
By this testing criteria, a poorly performing pad would have low values for compressive strength indicating that it is easily compressed, and low values for compression recovery indicating that once deformed the pad experiences little recovery. Conversely, a pad/fiber composition with high values for these parameters exhibits high mechanical strength and is considered a good-perfonner. An ideal fiber would have a compressive strength. within a target range comparable to a standard, commercial aluminosilicate fiber, and additionally having high compression recovery, or resiliency.<br>

*Not tested.<br>
As seen from the data above, the vitreous inorganic fibers of the present invention are less brittle after exposure to service temperatures of 1260°C and demonstrate less linear shrinkage at temperatures of 1330°C than the comparative commercial calcium silicate compositions 4 and 5. Additionally, they possess greater mechanical strength than the commercial calcium silicate fibers.<br><br>
In preferred ranges, the non-durable refractory glass fiber comprises the fiberization product of about71.5 to about 79 weight percent silica, 0 to about 16.5 weight percent magnesia, about 9 to about 27 weight percent calcia, and 0 to about 4.6 weight percent zirconia; 71.5 to about 76.1 weight percent silica, 0 to about 16.5 weight percent magnesia, and about 9.25 to about 28 weight percent calcia; and 72 to about 75 weight percent silica, 0 to about 16.5 weight percent magnesia, about 9.25 to about 28 weight percent calcia, and 0 to about 4.6 weight percent zirconia. . Zirconia.may optionally be present in up to about 5 weight percent, more preferably up to about 4.6 weight percent. Listed in Table I below are examples of compositions of the present invention that have target shrinkage and mechanical strength characteristics for a service temperature of at least 1330°C, and that among others, are suitable to be fiberized from melts.<br>
In the melt and fibers of the present invention, the operable silica level is greater than 71.25 weight percent, preferably greater than 71.25 to about 85 weight percent silica, more preferably from greater than about 71.5 to about 79 weight percent silica, more preferably from about 72 to about 79 weight percent silica, and most preferably from about 72 to about 75 weight percent silica, with the upper level of silica limited only by manufacturability. This is contrary to the teachings in the art, which state that fibers having silica levels above 71.24 weight percent are not manufacturable.<br>
The fibers of the present invention preferably contain substantially no alkali metal, greater than trace impurities. The alkali metal content of these fibers is generally in the range of trace impurities, or hundredths of a percent at most, calculated as alkali metal oxide.<br>
Further specific embodiments of the fiber composition comprise the fiberization product of about 72 to about 79 weight percent silica, 0 to about 1 weight percent magnesia, about IS to about 27 weight percent calcia, and 0 to about 4.6 weight percent zirconia; the fiberization product of about 72 to about 75 weight percent silica, about 8 to about 12.5 weight percent magnesia and about 12.5 to about 18 weight percent calcia; and the fiberization product of about 72.5 to about 73 weight percent silica, about 3 to about 4 weight percent magnesia and about 22 to about 23 weight percent calcia.<br>
The inventive vitreous inorganic fiber compositions listed in Table I were produced by blowing techniques and as noted above, were tested for linear shrinkage at temperatures of 1330°C and after-service friability. The results of these tests are listed below in Table II. These same tests were also perfonned on a commercial magnesium silicate fiber and two different commercial calcium silicate fibers, all of which were produced using spinning techniques. The latter compositions are labeled as comparative compositions 3-4 and their compositions are also set forth in Table I. The test results of the comparative fibers are also shown in Table II.<br>

Example 1<br>
Composition 1 is a fiber blown' from a melt comprising about 72.57 weight percent SiO2, about 22.4 weight percent CaO, and about 3.21 weight percent MgO. The diameter of the blown fiber was 1.56 µm.<br>
Example 2<br>
Composition 2 is a fiber blown from a melt comprising about 72.64 weight percent SiO2, about 22.23 weight percent CaO, and about 3.18 weight percent MgO. The diameter of the blown fiber was 1.27µm.<br>
Example 3<br>
Comparative Composition 3 was a commercial magnesia silicate fiber spun from a melt comprising 76.46 weight percent silica and 20.87 weight percent magnesia having a diameter of 4.5 µm. Comparative composition 3 demonstrated 11% linear shrinkage after being exposed to temperatures of 1330°C. The inventive calcium magnesia silicate<br><br>
Viscosity vs. Temperature<br>
The shape of the viscosity vs. temperature curve for a glass composition is representative of the ease with which a melt will fiberize and thus, of the quality of the resulting fiber (affecting, for example, the fiber's shot content, fiber diameter, and fiber length). Glasses generally have low viscosity at high temperatures. As temperature decreases, the viscosity increases. The value of the viscosity at a given temperature will vary as a function of composition, as will the overall steepness of the viscosity vs. temperature curve.<br>
One approach to testing whether a fiber of a defined composition can be readily manufactured at an acceptable quality level is to determine whether the viscosity curve of the experimental chemistry matches that of a known product which can be easily fiberized. Such a target viscosity curve is shown in FIG. 1 A, being the viscosity curve for a commercially available spun aluminosilicate fiber, and in FIG. IB, being the viscosity curve for a commercially available blown aluminosilicate fiber.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the viscosity curve for a calcia-magnesia-zirconia-silica fiber melt chemistry comprising 75 percent silica, 8 percent magnesia, 15 percent calcia and 2 percent zirconia, by weight. This curve approximates the target viscosity curve of FIG. 1A for the commercially available, spun aluminosilicate fiber. FIG. 3 shows the viscosity curve for a calcia-magnesia-silica fiber melt chemistry comprising 73.5 percent silica, 13.5 percent magnesia, and 13.5 percent calcia, by weight. This curve approximates the target viscosity curve of FIG. IB for the commercially available, blown aluminosilicate fiber. These fiber melt chemistries, according to the present invention, are well suited to fiberization by conventional blowing or spinning techniques.<br>
Further examples of the inventive vitreous inorganic fiber compositions listed in Table III below were produced and various samples were tested for linear shrinkage at temperatures of 1150°C, 1260°C, and 1330°C as well as compression recoveiy and solubility in a physiological solution. The results of these tests are listed below in Table<br><br>
IV. The fibers of Composition 6 had an average diameter of about 2.37 microns and the fibers of Composition 7 had an average diameter of about 2.42 microns.<br>

These same tests were also performed on two different calcium silicate fibers and two different magnesium silicate fibers. The latter compositions are labeled as comparative compositions C20-C23 and their compositions are also set forth in Table III. The shrinkage test results of the comparative fibers are also shown in Table IV.<br><br><br>
(Table removed)<br><br>
Tests not conducted where shrinkage data is not provided.<br>
The inventive fibers possess excellent shrinkage resistance, and mechanical strength as measured by compression recovery, after service temperatures of 1150°C, 1260°C, and 1330°C, and are soluble in physiological fluid, as measured in simulated lung fluid.<br>
Analysis of the durability of the above fibers in simulated lung fluid indicates that these fibers are significantly less durable than normal refractory ceramic fiber, such as ahmiinosilicates (about 50/50 weight percent) and alumino-zirconia-silicates or AZS (about 30/16/54 weight percent).<br>
The tests on the inventive fiber have been conducted on fibers that have been produced using a blowing technique. The inventive fibers can also be produced using a spinning technique.<br>
Table V below lists several illustrative additional examples of the fiber composition of the present invention.<br><br>

It has, therefore, been demonstrated that a fiber composition comprising the fiberization product of greater than 71.25 silica, preferably in the range of about 71.5 to about 79 weight percent silica, more preferably in the range of about 72 to about 79 weight percent silica, more preferably in the range of about 72 to about 75 weight percent silica, and containing calcia, optionally magnesia, optionally zirconia, and optionally a viscosity modifier, is readily fiberizable into a high temperature resistant insulating fiber. This is contrary to the teachings of the prior art, which teaches that melt compositions having greater than 71.24 weight percent silica are very difficult, if not impossible, to be fiberized into a fiber.<br>
It has also been demonstrated that the fiber composition of the present invention containing the fiberization product of greater than 71.25 silica, preferably in the range of about 71.5 to about 79 weight percent silica, more preferably in the range of about 72 to about 79 weight percent silica, more preferably in the range of about 72 to about 75 weight percent silica, and containing calcia, optionally magnesia, optionally zirconia, and optionally a viscosity modifier possesses acceptable shrinkage characteristics not only at service temperatures of 1150°C and 1260°C, but also at sendee temperatures of 1330°C. This surprising and unexpected feature of low shrinkage at a service temperature of 1330°C has not been disclosed or suggested by the prior art relating to fiber compositions containing silica, calcia and optionally magnesia. Additionally, the fiber composition possesses excellent after service mechanical strength and is soluble in physiological fluids.<br>
