Title:      Elongated and Multiple Spacers in Activatible Prodrugs<br>
Cross-reference to related application:<br>
This application is a continuation of EP-A-01201095.5, filed 23 March 2001, the disclosure<br>
thereof being incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to prodrugs that can be activated at the preferred site of action in order to selectively deliver the corresponding therapeutic or diagnostic parent moiety to target cells or to the target site. This invention will therefore primarily but not exclusively relate to tumor cells as target cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lack of selectivity of chemotherapeutic agents is a major problem in cancer treatment. Because highly toxic compounds are used in cancer chemotherapy, it is typically associated with severe side effects. Drug concentrations that would completely eradicate the tumor cannot be reached because of dose-limiting side effects such as gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow toxicity. In addition, tumors can develop resistance against anticancer agents after prolonged treatment. In modem drug development, targeting of cytotoxic drugs to the tumor site can be considered one of the primary goals.<br>
A promising approach to obtain selectivity for tumor cells or tumor tissue is to exploit the existence of tumor-associated enzymes. A relatively high level of tumor-specific enzyme can convert a pharmacologically inactive prodrug to the corresponding active parent drug in the vicinity of the tumor. Via this concept a high concentration of toxic anticancer agent can be generated at the tumor site. All tumor cells may be killed if the dose is sufficiently high, which may decrease development of drug resistant tumor cells.<br>
There exist several enzymes that are present at elevated levels in certain tumor tissues. One<br>
example is the enzyme p-glucuronidase, which is liberated from certain necrotic tumor areas.<br>
Furthermore, several proteolytic enzymes have been shown to be associated with tumor<br>
i  invasion and metastasis. Several proteases, like for example the cathepsins and proteases from<br><br>
the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) system are all involved in tumor metastasis. The serine protease plasmin plays a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis. The proteolytically active form of plasmin is formed from its inactive pro-enzyme form plasminogen by u-PA. The tumor-associated presence of plasmin can be exploited for targeting of plasmin-cleavable prodrugs.<br>
In this invention a new technology is disclosed that can be applied to prepare improved prodrugs or conjugates for targeting drugs to disease-related or organ-specific tissue or cells, for example tumor-specific prodrugs. This technology can furthermore find application in (non-specific) controlled release of compounds, with the aim of facilitating release of the parent moiety. The present invention is deemed to be applicable to all drugs that need to be delivered at a specific target site where a specific disease-related biomolecule can convert the prodrug into the drug or induce conversion of the prodrug into the drug.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The technology of this invention relates to novel linker systems to be inserted between a specifier (= part of prodrug to be cleaved by the enzyme) and parent drug. A great number of anticancer prodrugs that have been developed in the past contain a self-eliminating connector or linker, also called self-elimination spacer. This spacer is incorporated between the specifier and the drug in order to facilitate enzymatic cleavage and so enhance the kinetics of drug release (as shown in figure 1). The specifier (which for example can be an oligopeptide substrate for a protease or for example a (3-glucuronide substrate for p-glucuronidase) must be site-specifically removed, followed by a spontaneous spacer elimination to release the cytotoxic parent drug. In this invention, greatly improved linker systems are disclosed. These are applicable in prodrugs, for example anticancer prodrugs, and significantly enhance enzymatic activation rates.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to compounds of the formula:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
V is an enzymatically removable specifier,<br><br>
(W)ic-(X)rA is an elongated self-eliminating spacer system, W and X are each a l,(4+2n) electronic cascade spacer, being the same or different, A is either a spacer group of formula (Y)m, wherein Y is a l,(4+2n) electronic cascade spacer, or a group of formula U, being a cyclisation elimination spacer, Z is a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety, k, 1 and m are independently an integer of 0 (included) to<br>
5 (included), n is an integer of 0 (included) to 10 (included), with the provisos that:<br>
when A is 0%: then k+l+m &gt; 1, and<br>
ifk+l+m=l,thenn&gt;l;<br>
when A is U: then k+1 &gt; 1.<br>
These novel elongated linker systems show improved enzymatic activation characteristics, which is demonstrated in the following Examples.<br>
An activatible prodrug according to this invention comprises a specifier V, which is meant to consist of a group that can be site specifically removed and that is covalently attached to a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety Z via the novel elongated self-eliminating connector system (W)k-(X)rA of the invention (figure 2). These self-eliminating connector systems possess increased lengths, which places the parent moiety Z at an increased distance from the specifier.<br>
It is observed that spacers which self-eliminate through a l,(4+2n)-elimination (n = 0,1,2,3,4,5... 10) (for example 1,6-elimination, 1,8-elimination, or 1,10-elimination) are from now called "electronic cascade* spacers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention are the electronic cascade spacers W, X, and Y independently selected from compounds having the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent H, Cw alkyl, C3-20 heterocyclyl, C5.20 aryl, d-6 alkoxy, hydroxy (OH), amino (NH2), mono-substituted amino (NRXH), di-substituted amino (NRx'Rx2), nitro (NO2), halogen, CF3, CN, CONH2, S02Me, CONHMe, cyclic C1-5 alkylamino, imidazolyl, C^ alkylpiperazinyl, morpholino, thiol (SH), thioether (SRx), tetrazole, carboxy (COOH), carboxylate (COORx), sulphoxy (S(=0)20H), sulphonate (S(O)20Rx), sulphonyl (S(=0)2Rx)» sulphixy (S(=0)OH), sulphinate (S(=0)ORx), sulphinyl (S(=0)Rx), phosphonooxy (OP(=0)(OH)2), and phosphate (OP(=0)(ORx)2), where Rx, Rx1 and Rx2 are independently selected from a C1-6 alkyl group, a C3.20 heterocyclyl group or a C5-20 aryl group, two or more of the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, or R9 optionally being connected to one another to form one or more aliphatic or aromatic cyclic structures.<br>
It is further observed that the principle of 1,Elimination, as such developed in 1981, can be considered one of the most versatile self-elimination principles that can be used in prodrug design. According to this principle, spacer elimination proceeds via the mechanism depicted in figure 3. This particular elimination process has proven to be very successful when applied in the prodrug concept Spacers that self-eliminate through an electronic cascade sequence as indicated in figure 3 generally show much faster half-lives of elimination than do spacers that ; eliminate via a cyclisation reaction. This is a significant difference between cyclisation spacers<br><br>
and electronic cascade spacers.<br>
In the following Examples, para-aminoben2yloxycarbonyl (PABC) and related electronic cascade spacer systems are used because they eliminate more rapidly upon wwnflgking of the amine, when compared to hydroxybenzyl-based electronic cascade spacers, which need electron-withdrawing substituents on the phenyl part of the spacer in order to let spacer elimination take place. Drug release will not take place when the spacer is an un-substituted hydroxybenzyl electronic cascade spacer.<br>
Most efforts were, in the past, directed to the synthesis of electronic cascade spacers containing electron-withdrawing substituent(s). It was hypothesized that the withdrawal of electrons from the site where enzymatic activation occurs would enhance the rate of enzymatic activation. However, the activation rate of prodrugs containing an electron-withdrawing group on the spacer is usually not significantly different from that of un-substituted electronic cascade spacer containing prodrugs: A chloro-substituent on an aminobenzyl spacer for example only marginally enhances the rate of enzymatic prodrug activation by plasmin. In the case  of aminobenzyl   spacer-containing  anthracycline   prodrugs  for  activation  by   p~ glucuronidase, chloro- or bromo-substituents showed only a marginal effect. It must further be considered that, although electron-withdrawing substituents on aminobenzyl spacers may increase enzymatic activation rates, spacer elimination rates will decrease as a consequence of substituents with such electronic properties. In the case of generation of hydroxylamino benzyl electronic cascade spacers it appeared that indeed electron-donating substituents on the benzyl ring accelerated fragmentation. This effect can probably be ascribed to stabilization of the developing positive charge on the benzylic carbon by these substituents. In some cases, when one or more of the spacer substituents are too electron-withdrawing, spacer elimination will not occur at all. An aminobenzyl spacer containing a nitro substituent at the meta position with respect to the specifier did not self-eliminate to release the free drug. It was also found that a hydroxylamino benzyl spacer with a nitro substituent at the meta position with respect to the specifier showed the slowest spacer elimination rate of such substituted hydroxylamino benzyl spacers* It appears that electron-withdrawing properties of spacer substituents have only marginal impact on enzymatic activation rates, whereas spacer elimination is greatly dependent on electronic properties of spacer substituents and occurs only in a relatively narrow characteristic electronic profile depending on the type of cascade spacer that is used.<br>
In several previously reported prodrugs, containing one electronic cascade spacer, differences<br><br>
in enzymatic activation rates can still be observed when different parent drugs are connected with the same promoiety or when a parent drug is connected to the same promoiety via a different site of the drug. For example, ^-glucuronidase cleaves the glucuronide from a p-glucuronide-cyclisation spacer promoiety much slower when paclitaxel is the parent drug in comparison with the prodrug containing doxorubicin as the parent drug. In another example, a dipeptide derivative of paclitaxel, linked via an aminobenzyl spacer was more readily cleaved by cathepsin B when paclitaxel was linked via its 7-position than via its 2'-position. In addition, half-lives of cathepsin B cleavage of electronic cascade spacer containing prodrugs of doxorubicin or mitomycin C were much shorter than the half-life of the corresponding prodrugs with paclitaxel as the parent drug. Finally, plasmin cleaves the tripeptide from an electronic cascade spacer containing doxorubicin prodrug much more readily than the tripeptide from the corresponding paclitaxel prodrug. Thus, in several prodrug systems the parent drug still exerts a significant effect on the rate of enzymatic activation, even though the mentioned prodrugs all contained one electronic cascade spacer.<br>
The invention obviates the above-mentioned drawbacks by reduction of the influence of substituents of the spacer group on prodrug activation and/or spacer elimination and of the parent drug on the ratfe of enzymatic activation of the prodrug due to the presence of elongated spacer systems.<br>
The invention is in a second aspect related to compounds of the above-mentioned formula wherein group U is a cyclisation spacer, from now called 'co-amino aminocarbonyr cyclisation spacer, and Z is a molecule having a hydroxyl group.<br>
More preferably, the co-amino aminocarbonyl cyclisation elimination spacer U of the invention is a compound having the formula:<br><br><br>
b is an integer of 0 or 1; and<br>
c is an integer of 0 or 1; provided that<br>
a + b + c = 2or3;<br>
and wherein R1 and/or R2 independently represent H, CM alkyl, said alkyl being optionally substituted with one or more of the following groups: hydroxy (OH), ether (ORx), amino (NH2), mono-substituted amino (NRXH), disubstituted amino (NRx^x2), nitro (NO2X halogen, CF3, CN, CONH2, SC^Me, CONIIMe, cyclic C1-5 alkylamino, imidazolyl, CM alkylpiperazinyl, morpholino, thiol (SH), thiocthcr (SRX), tetrazole, carboxy (COOH), carboxylate (COORx), sulphoxy (S(=OhOH), sulphonate ^(O^ORx), sulphonyl (S(=0)2Rx), sulphixy (S(=0)OH), sulphinate (S(-0)ORx), sulphinyl (S(=0)Rx), phosphonooxy (OP(=OXOH)2), and phosphate (OP(OXORt)2), where Rx, Rx! and Rx2 are selected from a d. 6 alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group or a C5.20 aryl group; and<br>
R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 independently represent H, d« alkyl, C3-20 heterocyclyl, C5-20 aryl, CM alkoxy, hydroxy (OH), amino (NH2), mono-substituted amino (NRXH), disubstituted amino (NR^Rx2), nitro (N02), halogen, CF3, CN, CONH2, S02Me, CONHMe, cyclic CM alkylamino, imidazolyl, CM alkylpiperazinyl, morpholino, thiol (SH), thioether (SRX), tetrazole, carboxy (COOH), carboxylate (COORx), sulphoxy (S(=O)20H), sulphonate (S(=0)20RX), sulphonyl (S(=0)2RX), sulphixy (S(=0)OH), sulphinate (S(=0)ORx), sulphinyl (S(=0)Rx), phosphonooxy (0P(=O)(0H)2), and phosphate (OP(=OXORx)2), where R*, Rx1 and Rx are selected from a CM alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group or a C5-20 aryl group, two or more of the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, or R8 optionally being connected to one another to form one or more aliphatic or aromatic cyclic structures.<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent H, C^ alkyl, C3.20 heterocyclyl, C5.20 aryl, d-6 alkoxy, hydroxy (OH), amino (NH2), mono-substituted amino (NRXH), disubstituted amino (NRXXKX2), nitro (NO2), halogen, CF3, CN, CONH2, S02Me, CONHMe, cyclic Q.5 alkylamino, imidazolyl, C\* alkylpiperazinyi, morpholino, thiol (SH), thioether (SRX), tetrazole, carboxy (COOH), carboxylate (COORx), sulphoxy (S(=0)20H), sulphonate (S(=0)2ORx), sulphonyl (S(=0)2Rx), sulphixy (S(=0)OH), sulphinate (S(=0)ORx), sulphinyl (S(==0)Rx), phosphonooxy (OP(=0)(OH)2), and phosphate (OPCOXORxk), where Rx, Rx and Rx are independently selected from a Q-6 alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group or a C5-20 aryl group, two or more of the substituents Rl, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, or R9 optionally being connected to one another to fqrm one or more aliphatic or aromatic cyclic structures.<br>
In one embodiment the elongated spacer system (W)k-(X)i-A is a molecule that self-eliminates<br>
via a l,(4+2n)-elimination (n = 2,3,4,5... 10), for example a 1,8-eIimination (figure 4). The<br>
length of this novel spacer system can be extended, for example to a 1,10-elimination spacer<br>
system, in which two or more double or triple bonds instead of one are conjugated with the<br>
aromatic part of the spacer (figure 5).<br>
In another embodiment, the spacer system of the invention consists of two or more electronic<br>
cascade spacers that are connected to one another. Release of the leaving group (the drug)<br>
occurs after two or more subsequent spacer eliminations.<br>
In again another embodiment, prodrugs of hydroxy! functionality containing drugs (such as for<br>
example paclitaxel) are claimed that contain both one or more electronic cascade spacers and a<br>
cyclisation spacer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the spacer that is directly connected to die paclitaxel molecule is an<br>
co-amino aminocarbonyl cyclisation spacer that is linked to the 2*-position of paclitaxel via a<br><br>
carbamate linkage. A convenient synthetic route to this class of paclitaxel derivatives is disclosed.<br>
In another embodiment the elongated electronic cascade spacer system is coupled to the phenolic hydroxyl group of the drug moiety via an ether linkage. When the leaving group (i.e., the drug) is an phenolic hydroxyl group, a para-aminobenzylether has been reported to self-eliminate. The elongated spacer systems provide for improved enzymatic activation characteristics.<br>
Hie self-eliminating connector systems in this invention possess increased lengths with respect to an electronic cascade spacer system available at present. It is observed that one end of the linker system must be able to react with the specifier, for example the tripeptide that is a substrate for plasmin. Typically, this end of the spacer system is an amino group or a hydroxyl group, but it can also be another functionality. The functionality at the other end of the linker system must be able to react with the drug. Typically, this end of the spacer system is a hydroxyl group, but it can also be another functionality. In one embodiment this functionality reacts with an amino group of the drug to form a carbamate linkage between linker and drug. In another embodiment, this functionality reacts with a hydroxyl group of the drug to form a carbonate linkage between linker and drug. In again another embodiment, this functionality reacts with a sulfhydiyl group of the drug to form a thiocarbonate linkage between linker and<br>
1 drug. In again another embodiment this functionality reacts with a carboxylic acid group of the drug to form an ester linkage between linker and drug.<br>
Typically, the spacer system is p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-<br>

In the compounds of formula V-(WX-(X)r A-Z, the specifier V typically contains a substrate molecule that is specifically cleaved by an enzyme present in the vicinity of the target cells, for example tumor cells. More preferably, the specifier V contains a substrate that is specifically cleaved by an enzyme present at elevated levels in the vicinity of the target cells as compared to other parts of the body, and most preferably the enzyme is present only in the vicinity of the target cells.<br>
The specifier V may also contain a moiety that targets the compounds of formula V-(W)k-(X)r A-Z to the target site by selective complexing with a receptor or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population or by causing accumulation of compounds V-(W)k-(X)i-A-Z in the vicinity of the target cells by another mechanism. This targeting moiety may, for example, be bombesin, transferrin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, a molecule that specifically binds ctvp3 and/or otvPs-integrin receptors, such as RGD-containing peptides, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, a tumor growth factor, vaccinia growth factor, insulin and insulin-like growth factors I en II, an antigen-recognizing immunoglobulin or an antigen-recognizing fragment thereof, or a carbohydrate. Preferably, that antigen recognized by the immunoglobulin (or fragment thereof) is specific for the target cells, e.g. a tumor-specific antigen. The specifier V may also contain a polymer, which causes accumulation of compounds V-^WVPQi-A-Z in the vicinity of the target cells, e.g. tumor cells, because of the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect.<br>
In one embodiment, the specifier is a di-, tri-, or oligopeptide which consists of an amino acid sequence specifically recognized by a protease, for example plasmin, a cathepsin, cathepsin B, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), or a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases, present in die vicinity of the target cells, for example tumor cells, or, in another embodiment, a p-glucuronide that is specifically recognized by p-<br><br>
glucuronidase present in the vicinity of tumor cells. In again another embodiment the specifier is a nitro-aromatic moiety that can be reduced under hypoxic conditions or by nitroreductases. After removal of the nitro-aromatic specifier, elimination of the spacer systems described in this invention leads to drug release. It can be understood that any specifier that is specifically cleaved following recognition by a disease-specific and/or organ-specific enzyme and/or receptor can be incorporated into prodrugs that contain the linker systems claimed in this invention.<br>
The moiety Z is a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety. Z can for instance be an anticancer drug, an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory agent, or an anti-viral agent. Typically, the moiety Z is an anticancer drug. Preferably the anticancer drug is the amino containing daunorubicin, doxorubicin, N-(5,5-diacetoxypentyl)doxonibicin, an anthracycline, mitomycin C, mitomycin A, 9-amino camptothecin, aminopterin, actinomycin, bleomycin, Ns-acetyl spermidine, l-(2-ch!oroethyl)-l,2-dimethanesulfonyl hydrazine, tallysomycin, or derivatives thereof. The anticancer drug can also be the hydroxyl containing etoposide, camptothecin, irinotecan, topotecan, 9-amino camptothecin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, esperamycin, 1,8-dihydroxy-bicyclo[7.3. l]trideca-4-ene-2,6-diyne-13-one, anguidine, doxorubicin, morpholine-doxorubicin, N-(5,5-diacetoxypentyl) doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine,- or derivatives thereof. The anticancer drug can also be the sulfhydryl containing esperamicin, 6-mercaptopurine, or derivatives thereof. The drug can also be the carboxyl containing methotrexate, camptothecin (ring-opened form of the lactone), butyric acid, retinoic acid, or derivatives thereof.<br>
To show the principle of elimination of elongated spacer systems, tumor-specific prodrugs that are selectively hydrolyzed by the tumor-associated protease plasmin were synthesized. The synthesized prodrugs consist of a tripeptide specifier that is coupled to the drug via an elongated self-eliminating spacer. The tripeptide specifier contains an amino acid sequence that is specifically recognized by the tumor-associated enzyme plasmin. The synthesis of these derivatives is disclosed.<br>
There is an increasing body of literature that links production of certain proteases to tumor malignancy. Mostly, proteolytic activity is required for tumor cells when they become invasive and form metastases. A primary tumor is encapsulated in an extracellular matrix, which<br><br>
consists of proteins. In order to form metastases, the primary tumor must break through this matrix. For this reason, enhanced expression of proteolytic enzymes by invading and metastasizing tumors is generated Recent studies' indicate that proteases are involved also in earlier stages of tumor progression, at both primary and metastatic sites. A number of proteases, like cathepsins, the u-PA system, and the matrix metalloproteinases, take part in the proteolytic cascade.<br>
The u-PA system has received broad attention in the literature, especially in the last decade. Several invasive and metastasizing human tumors express a significantly higher plasminogen activator activity in comparison with normal tissue. An increased activity and expression of u-PA is found in several tumor cell lines and human solid tumors, like lung tumors, prostate cancers, breast cancers, ovarian carcinomas and several other cancer types. u-PA is an important enzyme in proteolytic reactions that are required for the spreading and invasiveness of cells, both in cancer and in tissue remodeling processes. u-PA interacts with a specific high-affinity receptor on the cell surface. Receptor-bound u-PA is catalytically active on the surface of the cell without requiring internalization. It interacts with plasminogen to produce plasmin that is still bound to the cell surface. The high u-PA level via this pathway leads to elevated levels of plasmin. There exists substantial evidence that the protease plasmin itself plays a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Plasmin itself catalyses the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins. Thus, the plasminogen activator system is intimately associated with tumor metastasis. Even the process of angiogenesis, nowadays considered as an important target mechanism for the development of new therapeutic strategies, is a urokinase dependent process. The plasminogen activation system may be involved in cell adhesion processes by regulating integrin functions. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic molecule, is suggested to interact with u-PA in tumor progression. u-PA catalyzed plasmin generation proved to be an important determinant of tumor metastasis in many experiments with animal model systems.<br>
For the reasons outlined above, plasmin can be a very promising enzyme for the targeting of peptide prodrugs of anticancer agents. Active plasmin is localized in tumor tissue because it is formed from its inactive pro-enzyme form plasminogen by u-PA, produced by cancer and/or stroma cells. In the blood circulation active plasmin is rapidly inhibited by inhibitors that block the active site, such as Gfe-antiplasmin. Cell-bound plasmin as present in tumor tissue is not inhibited. In addition, plasmin is suitable as a target enzyme for prodrugs, because it is generated at the end of the proteolytic cascade. One molecule of u-PA can generate more than<br><br>
one molecule of plasmin.<br>
The amino acid sequence of the tripeptide to be a plasmin substrate must be chosen such that it is a specific substrate for the serine protease plasmin. The C-terminal amino acid that is coupled to the spacer-drug moiety is arginine or lysine, preferably an X-lysine residue. Plasmin is known to cleave most easily after a lysine residue. The amino acid at the N-terminus possesses the ^-configuration in order to prevent in vivo cleavage by ubiquitous amino peptidases. Protecting the N-terminal amino function by a Boc or Fmoc group can also prevent unwanted peptidase cleavage. The amino acid in the middle is preferably a hydrophobic L-amino acid and is selected from the group consisting of alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, cyclohexylglycine, tryptophan and proline. Preferred tripeptide sequences are D-alanylphenylalanyllysine, D-valylleucyllysine, D-alanylleucyllysine, D-valylphenylalanyllysine, D-valyltryptophanyllysine, and D-alanyltryptophanyllysine. By converting the two amino groups of the tripeptide into the corresponding ammonium salts, the water solubility of the prodrug should be improved.<br>
In the present invention the synthesis and application of new elongated spacer systems is described. In one embodiment, this spacer self-eliminates through a l,(4+2n)-elimination process (figures 4,5). These l,(4+2n)-elimination spacers are elongated with respect to the conventional 1,6-elimination spacer. Proof of principle of 1,8-elimination was delivered upon chemical reduction of the nitrocinnamyl carbonate derivative of paclitaxel using zinc and acetic acid (figures 6,7). Released paclitaxel was isolated in good yield. Firstly, the doubly protected tripeptide was synthesized (figure 8). The 1,8-elimination spacer itself was synthesized from 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol as depicted in figure 9. 4-Aminocinnamyl alcohol was incorporated between doxorubicin and a tripeptide for plasmin activation (figure 10). What is also disclosed in this invention are prodrugs that contain two or more electronic cascade spacers connected to one another, incorporated between specifier and drug (figure 11). Prodrugs containing linker systems of this kind have not been reported before. This embodiment of the present invention was exemplified by synthesizing two prodrugs containing &gt; a tripeptide specifier coupled to doxorubicin or paclitaxel via two 1,6-elimination spacers. This protected tripeptide was subsequently coupled with 4-aminobenzyl alcohol, and the resulting benzylic alcohol was activated with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate to yield the corresponding 4~ nitrophenyl carbonate (figure 12). In a very efficient reaction a second molecule of 4-<br><br>
aminobenzyl alcohol was coupled to the activated carbonate in which hydroxy benzotriazole (HOBt) was employed as a catalyst to yield the corresponding tripeptide-double spacer conjugate (figure 13). When this reaction was performed using diphenyl phosphinic acid as a catalyst, the product was isolated in only 16 percent yield (figure 14). The peptide-double spacer conjugate was incorporated into a doxorubicin prodrug (figure IS) and a paclitaxel prodrug (figure 16), by subsequent chloroformate activation, coupling with the drug and final deprotection. A double spacer-containing doxorubicin prodrug with a tryptophan residue instead of phenylalanine was also synthesized (figures 17,18). According to a further embodiment a third 4-aminobenzyl alcohol spacer was reacted with die 4-nitrophenyl carbonate activated tripeptide-double spacer conjugate to yield the corresponding tripeptide-triple spacer conjugate (figure 19). This compound was subsequently converted to the corresponding triple electronic cascade spacer containing doxorubicin prodrug employing a similar route as depicted in figures 15 and 16.<br>
What is also claimed are prodrugs in which the promoiety is coupled to a hydroxyl group of parent moiety Z via a carbamate linkage. These carbamate coupled prodrugs contain an elongated linker system that contains both one or more electronic cascade spacers and an co-amino aminocarbonyl cyclisation spacer (figure 20), Paclitaxel-2*-carbamate prodrugs of this type were synthesized via a novel convergent route, which leads to high yields, as claimed in claims 35 and 36. Paclitaxel will be released after one or more l,(4+2n)-eliminations (n -0,1,2,3,4,5,....10) and a subsequent intramolecular cyclisation. In the present invention the cyclisation spacer is connected to the 2*-OH group of paclitaxel through a carbamate linkage (figure 20). Firstly, paclitaxel was selectively activated at the 2*-position (figure 21) Secondly, a mono-protected cyclisation spacer was coupled to the 2'-activated paclitaxel analog and the protective group was removed under acidic conditions to yield the first fragment (figure 22). The second fragment was synthesized by connecting the 1,6-elimination spacer to the tripeptide specifier and subsequent 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate activation of the benzylic alcohol function (figure 12). Then, both fragments were coupled to one another (figure 23) and the coupled product was deprotected (figure 24). Coupling of two separate fragments according to this strategy in which in the final stage the chemical link between the two spacers &gt; is established, did provide the most efficient route to the paclitaxel prodrug. This is a novel route to obtain prodrugs of this type, in which a specifier is connected to a hydroxyl containing drug via an electronic cascade spacer system (connected to the specifier) and a cyclisation spacer (connected to the drug). The preparation of two other prodrugs of paclitaxel that contain<br><br>
both an electronic cascade spacer system and a cyclisation spacer is depicted in figures 25 -27, In figure 28 previously reported plasmin-activatible prodrugs containing one electronic cascade spacer are depicted.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to processes for the synthesis of the prodrugs as defined above. The invention e.g. relates to a process for the synthesis of prodrugs as defined above having at least one electronic cascade spacer group, and an ©-amino aminocarbonyl cyclisation elimination spacer group, connected to each other, incorporated between a specifier group and a drug molecule such that said drug molecule is connected to said cyclisation elimination spacer group, via the hydroxyl functionality of the drug molecule, by coupling a first electronic cascade spacer group, connected to said specifier group, if desired via at least one, second electronic cascade spacer group, being the same or different as said first electronic cascade spacer group, to said cyclisation elimination spacer group. In a preferred process said drug molecule is paclitaxel, and in a first step a cyclisation elimination spacer group is coupled to paclitaxel via its 2'-hydroxyl group through a carbamate linkage via addition of the free spacer-amine to a 4-nitrophenyl carbonate activated drug, followed by deprotection to obtain a first fragment consisting of a cyclisation spacer connected with paclitaxel, and in a second step one or more l,(4+2n) electronic cascade spacers, being the same or different, wherein n is an integer of 0 to 10, are coupled to a specifier group, subsequently activated to the corresponding 4-nitrophenyl carbonate, whereafter in a third step the fragments obtained in the first and second step are coupled to one another under basic reaction conditions. The invention further relates to a process for the synthesis of prodrugs as defined above, in which electronic cascade spacers are connected to one another by coupling of the terminal alcohol group of an electronic cascade spacer to the aniline amino group of another electronic cascade spacer through a carbamate linkage by conversion of the alcohol group of the first-mentioned electronic cascade spacer to the corresponding 4-nitrophenyl carbonate and reacting this molecule with the other electronic cascade spacer in the presence of a catalytic amount of 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole either in the presence or absence of base.<br>

To a solution of 200 mg (1.12 mmol, 4.8 equiv) 4-nitrocinnamyl alcohol in dry dichloromethane/tetrahydrofuran under an Argon atmosphere was added pyridine (94 |al, 5.0 equiv) and 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate (236 mg, 5.0 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and a catalytic amount of DMAP, a few drops of triethyl amine and 200 mg paclitaxel (1.0 equiv) were added.

To a solution of protected prodrug 48 (50.0 mg, 27.1 umol) in methanol (5 mL) was added acetic acid (1.5 mL) and zinc (88.5 mg, 1.35 mmol). The resultant suspension was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Then, the reaction mixture was filtered over HYFLO. Water was<br>
it<br>
added and methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resultant solution was freeze-dried to obtain a slightly yellow solid, which was dissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (2 mL, 1:1 v/v). This solution was added to cold diisopropyl ether. The white precipitate was collected by means of centrifugation and washed two times with diisopropyl ether, which afforded prodrug 49 (27.8 mg, 173 jimol, 64%).<br><br>
Example 34<br>
Stability of both double spacer containing paclitaxel prodrugs 22 and 43.<br>
The prodrugs were incubated at concentrations of 150 \JM in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.3) for 3 days and showed no formation of degradation products (TLC, RPu; CH3CN/H2O/ACOH 19/19/2).<br>
Stability of the double spacer containing doxorubicin prodrug 20.<br>
The prodrug was incubated at a concentration of 100 - 270 jaM in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.3) for 90 hours and showed no formation of degradation products (TLC, RPu; CH3CN/H20/AcOH 19/19/2).<br>
Example 35<br>
Enzymatic hydrolysis of the double spacer containing prodrugs by plasmin.<br>
Hydrolysis of the doxorubicin prodrugs was investigated by incubation at a prodrug concentration of 100 \xM in 0.1 M Tris/hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.3) in the presence of 50 or 20 |ig/mL human plasmin (Fluka). Analysis was carried out with the following HPLC system using a Chrompack Microsphere-C18 column (3 urn, 2 x 100 x 4.6 mm). Elution of the analytical column was performed using 7:3 methanol/50 mM Et3N-formate buffer (pH 3.0). Detection was performed using an UV-detector (X = 500 nm).<br><br>
Hydrolysis of the paclitaxel prodrugs was investigated by incubation at a prodrug concentration of 200 jiM in 0.1 M Tris/hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.3) in the presence of 100 lig/mL human plasmin (Fluka). All double spacer containing paclitaxel prodrugs were<br><br>
converted to yield the corresponding parent drug. Capillary electrophoresis was carried out with a CE Ext. Light Path Capillary (80.5 cm, SOμn), with 1:1 methanol/0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) as eluent Detection was performed at 200 and 254 nm.<br><br>
Cytotoxicity.<br>
The antiproliferative effect of prodrugs and parent drugs was determined in vitro applying seven well-characterised human tumor cell lines and the microculture sulphorhodamine B (SRB) test. The antiproliferative effects were determined and expressed as IC50 values, that are the (pro)drug concentrations that gave 50% inhibition when compared to control cell growth after 5 days of incubation.<br><br>
