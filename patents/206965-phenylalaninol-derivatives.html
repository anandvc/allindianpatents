PHENYLALANINOL DERIVATIVES<br>
Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) supergene family, is expressed on activated, but not resting, endothelium. The integrin VLA-4 (OJPI), which is expressed on many cell types<br>
including circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, but not neutrophils, is the principal receptor for VCAM-1. Antibodies to VCAM-1 or VLA-4 can block the adhesion of these mononuclear leukocytes, as well as melanoma cells, to activated endothelium in vitro. Antibodies to either protein have been effective at inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and preventing tissue damage in several animal models of inflammation. Anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to block T-cell emigration in adjuvant-induced arthritis, prevent eosinophil accumulation and bronchoconstriction in models of asthma, and reduce paralysis and inhibit monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to prolong the survival time of cardiac allografts. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-VLA-4 mAbs can prevent insulitis and diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice, and significantly attenuate inflammation in the cotton-top tamarin model of colitis.<br>
Thus, compounds which inhibit the interaction between c^-containing integrins, such as VLA-4, and VCAM-1 are useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammation caused by chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), pulmonary inflammation (e.g., asthma), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br>

The pulmonary inflammation which occurs in asthma is related to eosinophil infiltration into the lungs wherein the eosinophils bind to endothelium which has been activated by some asthma-triggering event or substance.<br>
Furthermore, acylphenylalanine derivatives metabolically derived from compounds of the invention also inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and MadCAM to the cellular receptor alpha4-beta7, also known as LPAM, which is expressed on lymphocytes, eosinophiles and T-cells. While the precise role of alpha4-beta7 interaction with various ligands in inflammatory conditions such as asthma is not completely understood, compounds of the invention which inhibit both alpha4-betal and alpha4-beta7 receptor binding are particularly effective in animal models of asthma. Furthermore work with monoclonal antibodies to alpha4-beta7 indicate that compounds which inhibit alpha4-beta7 binding to MadCAM or VCAM are useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They would also be useful in the treatment of other diseases in which such binding is implicated as a cause of disease damage or symptoms.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered orally, rectally, or parentally, e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally or transdermally; or sublingually, or as opthalmalogical preparations, or as an aerosol in the case of pulmonary inflammation. Capsules, tablets, suspensions or solutions for oral administration, suppositories, injection solutions, eye drops, salves or spray solutions are examples of administration forms.<br>
Intravenous, intramuscular, oral or inhalation administration is a preferred form of use. The dosages in which the compounds of the invention are administered in effective amounts depending on the nature of the specific active ingredient, the age and the requirements of the patient and the mode of administration. Dosages may be determined by any conventional means, e.g., by dose-limiting clinical trials. Thus, the invention further comprises a method of treating a host suffering from a disease in which VCAM-1 of fibronectin binding to VLA-4-expressing cells is a causative factor in the disease symptoms or damage by administering an amount of a compound of the invention sufficient to inhibit VCAM-1 or fibronectin binding to VLA-4-expressing cells so that said symptoms or said damage is reduced. In general, dosages of about 0.1-100 mg/kg body weight per day are preferred, with dosages of 1-25 mg/kg per day being particularly preferred, and dosages of 1-10 mg/kg body weight per day being especially preferred.<br>
In another aspect, the invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions which contain a pharmaceutical^ effective amount of a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be formulated by any conventional means. In this connection the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation, especially a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment or prophylaxis of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma containing a compound according to any one of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof together with a compatible pharmaceutical carrier material. Tablets or granulates can contain a series of binders, fillers, carriers or diluents. Liquid compositions can be, for example, in the form of a sterile water-miscible solution. Capsules can contain a filler or thickener in addition to the active ingredient. Furthermore, flavour-improving additives as well as substances usually used as preserving, stabilizing, moisture-retaining and emulsifying agents as well as salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers and other additives can also be present.<br><br>
The previously mentioned carrier materials and diluents can comprise any conventional pharmaceutical^ acceptable organic or inorganic substances, e.g., water, gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic, polyalkylene glycols and the like.<br>
Oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, preferably contain from 25 mg to 1000 mg of a compound of the invention.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any conventional means. In reaction Scheme 1, a compound of formula 2 in which Z is lower alkyl, and which is a known compound prepared as described in WO 99/10313 and WO 99/10312 is treated with a reducing agent capable of selectively reducing a carboxylic ester. For example treatment with a compound of formula 2 with an alkali borohydride, such as sodium borohydride in alcohol solution at about room temperature smoothly effects reduction to give a compound of formula 1.<br><br>

Example 4. Acute airway inflammation in the atopic primate.<br>
Airway inflammation in the monkey was determined using a modification of the protocol described by Turner et al. (Turner et aL, 1994). Adult male cynomolgus monkeys {Macaca fascicularis, Hazelton Labs, Denver, PA) weighing between 3.6 -5.8 kg were used in these studies. All animals exhibited positive skin and airway<br><br>
responses to Ascaris suum antigen and had at least a 3-fold increase in the sensitivity to methacholine (MCh) when subjected to an aerosol of ascaris extract.<br>
On the day of each experiment the animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride, 12 mg/kg, and xylazine, 0.5 mg/kg, intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube (3 mm, Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, MO), then seated in an upright position in a specially designed Plexiglass chair (Plas-Labs, Lansing, MI). The endotracheal tube was connected to a heated Fleisch pneumotachograph. Airflow was measured via a Validyn differential pressure transducer (DP 45-24) that was attached to the pneumotachograph. Transpulmonary pressure was measured via a second Validyne transducer (DP 45-24) connected between a sidearm of the tracheal cannula and a 18-gauge intrapleural needle inserted in the intercostal space located below the left nipple. Recordings of pressure and flow and the calculation of RL were made using the Modular Instruments data acquisition system as described above. Baseline RL was measured for all animals on the day of each experiment and had an average value of about 0.04 cmH20/ml/sec.<br>
Protocol<br>
Airway inflammation was induced by exposing the animal to an aerosol of A. Suum extract for 60 sec. The aerosol was delivered via a nebulizer (De Vilbiss Model 5000, Healt Care Inc., Somerset, PA) that was attached to the endotracheal tube. The concentration of extract was predetermined for each animal (500 to 50,000 PNU) and caused at least a doubling in the airway resistance. At 24 hour after the antigen challenge, the animals were anesthetized as described previously and placed on a stainless steel table. Airway inflammation was assessed by inserting a pediatric bronchoscope into the airway lumen down to about the 4 or 5 generation bronchi and gently lavaging with 3 X 2 ml aliquots of sterile Hanks Balanced Salt Solution. The recovered lavage fluid then was analyzed for the total cell and differential cell counts using standard hematological techniques.<br>
Drug Treatment<br>
The animals received drug or a vehicle, p.o., administered 2 hours prior to antigen challenge. The compound of example 1 caused a significant decrease in the number and percent of inflammatory cells present in the lavage fluid relative to vehicle treated control animals.<br><br><br><br><br>
