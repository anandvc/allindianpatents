				<td>This invention relates to an automatic liquid feed dispenser- An automatic feed dispenser may be used as an automatic feeding utensil for animals and birds.<br>
The animals and birds drink/eat the water/liquid feed from a container and which has to be filled with the water/liquid feed manually which is a very cumbersome job and the user has to remain vigilant whole day and niqht so as to provide water/liquid feed to the animals-<br>
Therefore  the  main  object of  this  invention is  to provide   an  automatic  liquid  feed  dispenser which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Anotfier object of this invention is to provide an automatic liquid feed dispenser for use for feeding animals/birds.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide an automatic liquid feed dispenser which is maintenance free and no operator is required day and night to keep the device in operation.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided an automatic liquid feed dispenser characterized in that a tank, liquid feed dispenser secured therewith at the bottom surface, inside tank, an air carrying tube being provided periphery of the liquid feed dispenser, such that to be connected with feed reservoir provided above said dispenser, a feed carry tube connected to the bottom end of the said reservoir being provided such that to supply the feed into said reservoir for supplying the same into the tank, a sight glass is provided at one side of said reservoir for the observation of the level of the liquid feed contained in the reservoir and a drain pipe is provided at the bottom end of said reservoir for cleaning purposes as and when required.<br>
In accordance with this invention an automatic liquid feed dispenser has a feed tank having a vessel secured therein at the bottom surface thereof. An air carrying tube secured at the top end of the vessel is secured at the top end of a reservoir provided for containing the<br><br>
liquid feed material therein and for supplying the air into said reservoir during the filling operation of said tank with the liquid feed. A liquid feed tube secured with the bottom end of the feed reservoir is secured at the top end of the vessel such that to supply the liquid feed material into the tank as and when required automatically. Control valves are provided with the feed supplying tube and air carrying tube for controllinq the amount of supply. A sight glass is provided at one side of the reservoir to observe the level of the liquid feed contained in the reservoir. An air tight lid is provided at the inlet of said reservoir provided at the top end thereof. A drain pipe is secured at the bottom end of said reservoir for cleaning the reservoir as and when required. The reservoir is kept on a stand to keep the reservoir above the height of the liquid feed dispenser.<br>
An  automatic  liquid  feed  dispenser  according  to  a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Fig- 1 shows the plan view of the liquid feed dispenser.<br><br>
Referring to the drawings, the liquid feed dispenser of this invention has a tank X provided for containing feed material therein for feeding purposes. A liquid feed dispenser 2 is secured at the bottom surface inside tank i. The liquid feed dispenser 2 has an outlet 3 is provided near the bottom end of the liquid feed dispenser 2 for the supply of the liquid feed into the tank 1- An air carrying channel 4 is provided periphery of the liquid feed dispenser 2 such that to supply air inside the liquid feed dispenser- When the level of the liquid feed comes down from the open end of the air carrying tube. An air displacement tube 5 provided at the top close of the liquid feed dispenser tube is connected to the top-closed end of the reservoir 6 provided for storing the liquid feed therein. A liquid feed supplying tube 7 secured at the bottom end of the reservoir 6 is secured with the top close end of the liquid feed dispenser 2 for supplying the liquid feed into the liquid feed dispenser 2 to supply the same into the tank 1. A control valve 8 is provided with said feed supplying tube 7 for controlling the supply of feed into the liquid feed dispenser 2.  Joints Jl, J2, J3, J4<br><br>
are provided to make the connections of the tubes easily with the liquid feed dispenser 2 and reservoir 6 respectively. A side glass 9 is provided at one side of the reservoir 6 to observe the level of the liquid feed contained in the reservoir 6. A drain pipe 10 ia provided at the bottom end of the reservoir 6 for the cleaning purposes of the reservoir 6 as and when required. An air tiqht lid 11 is provided at the top end of the reservoir 6 for supplying the liquid feed material into the reservoir. The reservoir 6 is placed over a stand 12 so as to keep the reservoir 6 above the height of the liquid feed dispenser 2. If one outlet 3 is provided in the dispenser then it is necessary to provide atleast two air channels 4 in the liquid feed dispenser 2- The bottom ends of the liquid feed dispenser 2 and reservoir 6 are provided witti an elivation 13 such that to displace feeding material completely from said reservoir as well as liquid feed dispenser respectively.<br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
