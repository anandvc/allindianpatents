Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to cellular communication systems, and, in<br>
particular, to mobile station registration in a cellular communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) standard provides a compatibility<br>
standard for cellular mobile telecommunications systems. The GPRS standard ensures<br>
that a mobile station (MS) operating in a GPRS system can obtain communication<br>
services when operating in a system manufactured according to the standard. To ensure<br>
compatibility, radio system parameters and call processing procedures are specified by the<br>
standard, including call processing steps that are executed by an MS and a base station<br>
subsystem serving the MS in order to provide for cell reselection.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary GPRS communication system 100 of<br>
the prior art. Communication system 100 includes multiple Base Station Systems (BSSs)<br>
110, J20. Each BSS 110, 120 includes a respective transceiver 112, 122 that is coupled<br>
to a respective controller 114,124. Each BSS 110,120 is coupled to a respective Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 116,126. In turn, each SGSN 116, 126 is further coupled<br>
to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 130 and, via the GGSN, to an external<br>
network 132. BSSs 110,120, SGSNs 116,126, and GGSN 130 are collectively referred<br>
to as an infrastructure of communication system 100. Communication system 100 further<br>
includes an MS 102 that resides in a first Routing Area (RA) and is provided<br>
communication services by a serving, or source, BSS 110 and a serving, or source, SGSN<br>
116 serving the first RA. Typically, data is transferred between MS 102 and the serving<br><br>
BSS 110 over an air interface, or wireless communication link, 104 that includes a<br>
forward link and a reverse link.<br>
As MS 102 moves around in communication system 100, the MS may experience<br>
deterioration in radio frequency (RF) signal conditions or congestion conditions with<br>
respect to the communication services provided to the MS by BSS 110. As a result, the<br>
MS 102 may decide to perform a cell reselection. In GPRS communication systems, such<br>
as communication system 100, the burden of cell selection is imposed on the MS. That<br>
is, in a GPRS communication system, the MS initiates a cell reselection and selects a<br>
target cell. During cell reselection, the MS may decide to abandon a serving RA, that is,<br>
the RA serviced by BSS 110 and SGSN 116, and to move to a neighboring, or target, RA,<br>
such as an RA serviced by BSS 120, and SGSN 126. In the current implementation of a<br>
GPRS system such as system 100, when MS 102 switches RAs, that is, is handed over<br>
from the source RA to the target RA, the MS establishes a wireless communication link<br>
106 with the target BSS 120 serving the target RA and terminates the communication link.<br>
104 with the source RA. Upon estabhihing communication link 106, MS 102 must then<br>
register with the target SGSN 126 servicing the target RA.<br>
Upon establishing communication link 106 with BSS 120, MS 102 ceases<br>
listening to the forward link associated with source BSS 110. As a result, MS 102 does<br>
not receive any data packets that may be conveyed by source BSS 110 to MS 102<br>
subsequent to the MS establishing communication link 106 with target BSS 120. Any<br>
such data packets must be reconveyed to SGSN 126 and then conveyed by SGSN 126 to<br>
MS 102 via BSS 120. However, MS 102 must first register with SGSN 126 before the<br>
SGSN conveys any data packets to the MS. As a result, all data flows are put on hold<br>
while MS 102 registers with the new SGSN 126, which registration process may take<br>
several seconds. Initially, GPRS did not support real-time services and a data flow<br>
disruption of several seconds during cell reselection was not an important issue.<br>
However, as real-time services are added to GPRS communication systems, the need has<br>
arisen for minimizing the disruption to data flows during a cell reselection involving a<br>
switch of RAs.<br><br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus that reduces a length of time<br>
that data flows are disrupted during a cell reselection involving a switch of RAs in a<br>
GPRS communication system.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To address the need for a method and apparatus that reduces a length of time that<br>
data flows are disrupted during a cell reselection involving a switch of Routing Areas<br>
(RAs) in a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) communication system, a<br>
communication system provides for a mobile station (MS) to pre-register with a Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node (SGSN) servicing a neighboring Routing Area (RA) that is a<br>
handoff candidate. In pre-registering with the neighboring RA and SGSN, the MS at least<br><br>
partially registers with the RA and SGSN, that is, at least a portion of the MS's<br>
registration information is conveyed to the neighboring SGSN serving the neighboring<br>
RA, prior to the MS being served by an associated neighboring BSS 230, for example,<br>
prior to an initiation of a handoff of the MS to neighboring BSS 230. By pre-registering<br>
with the candidate SGSN, the duration of a registration process and the corresponding<br>
service disruptions when the MS is handed off to such an SGSN are reduced.<br>
Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
registering a mobile station comprising registering the mobile station with a first Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node (SGSN), wherein the first SGSN services a first Base Station<br>
System (BSS) that provides communication services to the mobile station, assembling a<br>
Neighbor List that comprises a plurality of communication channels, wherein a<br>
communication channel of the plurality of communication channels is associated with a<br>
second BSS that is serviced by a second SGSN that is different than the first SGSN, and<br>
at least partially registering the mobile station with the second SGSN prior to the mobile<br>
station being served by the second BSS.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses an apparatus for pre-<br>
registering a mobile station, the apparatus comprising a first Serving GPRS Support Node<br>
(SGSN) having at least one memory device that maintains registration information<br>
concerning a mobile station and a processor operably coupled to the memory device that<br>
pre-registers the mobile station with a second SGSN, wherein the processor pre-registers<br>
the mobile station with the second SGSN prior to the mobile station being served by a<br>
Base Station System associated with the second SGSN.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a mobile station<br>
comprising at least one memory device and a processor operably coupled to the memory<br>
device that receives a Neighbor List, stores the Neighbor List in the at least one memory<br>
device, and conveys, to a Base Station System associated with a Serving GPRS Support<br>
Node, a request to pre-register the mobile station.	<br>
The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs. 2-6B.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a wireless communication system 200 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 200 includes multiple<br><br>
Base Station Systems (BSSs) 220, 230 (two shown). Each BSS 220, 230, includes a<br>
respective at least one transceiver 222, 232, such as a Base Transceiver Station (BTS),<br>
that is operably coupled to a respective controller 224,234. As is known in tide art, each<br>
BSS 220, 230 may include elements such as a Base Station Controller (BSC), and a<br>
Packet Control Unit (PCU) or a Packet Control Function (PCF). When a BSS, such as<br>
BSS 220 or 230, includes such elements, controller 224 may be implemented in any one<br>
of such elements or may be distributed among such elements. Each BSS 220, 230 is<br>
coupled to a respective Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 240, 250 by an interface,<br>
for example by a Gb interface or an Iu-ps interface, that includes a bearer path and a<br>
signaling interface. In turn, each SGSN 240, 250 is further coupled to a Gateway GPRS<br>
Support Node (GGSN) 260 and, via the GGSN, to an external network 280. BSSs 220,<br>
230, SGSNs 240,250, and GGSN 260 are collectively referred to as an infrastructure 270<br>
of communication system 200.<br>
Each SGSN 240, 250 provides communication services via an associated BSS<br>
220, 230 to a respective Routing Area (RA) 206, 208. Communication system 200<br>
further includes an MS 202 that resides in a first Routing Area (RA) 206 serviced by a<br>
first serving, or source, BSS 220 and a first serving, or source, SGSN 240. Data is<br>
transferred between MS 202 and serving BSS 220 via an air interface 210 that includes a<br>
forward link 211 and a reverse link 212. Forward link 211 comprises multiple .<br>
communication channels including at least one broadcast channel, at least one traffic<br>
channel, and at least one control channel. Reverse link 212 also comprises multiple<br>
communication channels, including an access channel, at least one traffic channel, and at<br>
least one control channel.<br>
Each of MS 202, controllers 224,234 and SGSNs 240,250 includes a respective<br>
processor 203, 226,236,242,252 operably coupled to, or associated with, a respective at<br>
least one memory device 204,228,238, 244,254. Each of processors 203,226,236,242,<br>
and 252 comprises one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal<br>
processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Each of the at least one memory devices 204,228,238,244, and<br>
254 comprises at least one memory device such as a random access memory (RAM), a<br>
dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or a read only memory (ROM) or<br><br>
equivalents thereof, that maintains data and programs that may be executed by the<br>
corresponding processor. In addition, each of the at least one memory devices 244 and<br>
254 of respective SGSNs 240 and 250 may further maintain a list of BSSs, such as BSSs<br>
220 and 230, operating in communication system 200 in association with an SGSN, that<br>
is, SGSNs 240 and 250, servicing each BSS. Furthermore, each of the at least one<br>
memory devices 228 and 238 of respective controllers 224 and 234 and/or each of the at<br>
least one memory devices 244 and 254 of respective SGSNs 240 and 250 may further,<br>
maintain a record of a geographical location of each BSS 220, 230 in communication system 200.<br>
Communication system 200 comprises a wireless packet data communication,<br>
system. In order for MS 202 to establish a packet data connection with an external<br>
network such as external network 280, each of MS 202 and multiple BSSs 220, 230,<br>
multiple SGSNs 240, 250, and GGSN 260 operates in accordance with the General<br>
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) standard, and in particular with 3GPP (Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project) TS (Technical Specification) 23.060 v5.0.0,3GPP TS 44.060 v4.4.0,<br>
3GPP TS 45.008 v5.4.0, 3GPP TS 04.18 v8.12.0, which standards are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference herein and copies of which may be obtained from the 3GPP via.<br>
the Internet or from the 3GPP Organization Partners' Publications Offices at Mobile<br>
Competence Centre 650, route des Lucioles, 06921 Sophia-Antipolis Cedex, France. The.<br>
GPRS standard specifies wireless telecommunications system operating protocols,<br>
including radio system parameters and call processing and handoff procedures, for GPRS<br>
communication systems. By operating in accordance with the GPRS standard, a user of<br>
MS 202 can be assured that MS 202 will be able to communicate with infrastructure 270<br>
and establish a packet data communication link with an external network, such as<br>
network 280, via infrastructure 270. In communication system 200, a communication<br>
channel comprises one or more time slots of multiple time slots transmitted in a<br>
frequency bandwidth. However, those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that<br>
communication system 200 may operate in accordance with any one of a variety of<br>
wireless packet data communication systems, such as a Global System for Mobile<br>
Communication (GSM) communication system, a Time Division Multiple Access<br>
(TDMA) communication system, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)<br><br>
- communication system, or an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM)<br>
communication system.<br>
Each controller 224,234 maintains a record, in an associated at least one memory<br>
device 228, 238, of each MS that is active in communication system 200 and is serviced<br>
by the controller. Preferably, the controller maintains the records of active MSs by<br>
storing an MS identifier (MS ID) uniquely associated with each such MS in an associated<br>
at least one memory device 228,238. For example, when MS 202 initiates a packet data<br>
session, the MS conveys a request for a channel assignment, preferably a Channel Request message, to a BSS servicing the MS, that is, BSS 220. The channel assignment<br>
request is received by BSS 220, and in particular transceiver 222, and forwarded to<br>
controller 224. In response receiving the request, controller 224 assigns to MS 202 one or<br>
more communication channels, including a traffic channel, in air interface 210 at<br>
transceiver 222 and conveys to transceiver 222 an Uplink Immediate Assignment (ULIA)<br>
message informing of the one or more assigned communication channels. Transceiver<br>
222 then forwards the ULIA message to MS 202. Channel Request messages and ULIA<br>
messages are well known in the art and will not be described in detail herein. Upon receiving the ULlA message from BSS 220, MS 202 conveys a message including uplink . data (ULData) and an MS identifier (MS ID) uniquely associated with the MS, such as a Temporarily Logical Link Identifier (TLLI), to serving BSS 220. BSS 220 stores the<br>
received MS ID in the least one memory device 228 and forwards the message to<br>
associated serving SGSN 240.<br>
Upon receiving the message, SGSN 240 stores the received MS ID in the at least<br>
one memory device 244 of the SGSN. SGSN 240 further establishes communication<br>
links between the SGSN and GGSN 260 for conveyance of data and other messages to<br>
and from MS 202, such as GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) tunnels and flow identifiers<br>
for Packet Data Protocol (PDP) contexts. In addition, serving BSS 220 assembles and<br>
maintains, in the at least one memory device 244 and in association with MS 202, a<br>
Neighbor List 216 comprising communication channels associated with BSSs, such as<br>
BSS 230, that are potential handoff candidates for MS 202. In another embodiment of<br>
the present invention, Neighbor List 216 may be assembled by serving SGSN 240. BSS<br>
220 or SGSN 240, whichever is appropriate, then conveys the assembled Neighbor List to<br><br>
MS 202. Upon receiving Neighbor List 216, MS 202 monitors one or more of the<br>
communication channels included in the Neighbor List.<br>
As MS 202 moves around in communication system 200, the MS may experience<br>
deterioration in radio frequency (RF) signal conditions or congestion conditions with<br>
respect to the communication services provided to the MS by serving BSS 220.<br>
Alternatively, MS 202 may be informed of a preferred cell reselection candidate, such as<br>
a neighboring cell in target RA 208 and/or an associated neighboring BSS 230, by<br>
infrastructure 270. As a result, the MS 202 may decide to perform a cell reselection.<br>
During cell reselection, MS 202 may decide to abandon a first, source RA, that is, RA<br>
206, and to move to a neighboring, target RA, such as a second RA 208 serviced by a<br>
second BSS 230 and a second SGSN 250.<br>
■	■	■<br>
In a prior art communication system such as communication system 100, when an<br>
MS is handed off from a first, source RA to a second, neighboring RA, and in particular<br>
from, a first, source SGSN to a second, target SGSN, the MS must re-register in the<br>
second, neighboring RA, that is, with the second, target SGSN. The re-registration may<br>
cause a disruption in the data flow of several seconds and as many as seven to eight<br>
seconds, which disruption is unacceptable for real time services such as voice services.<br>
As a result, communication system 200 provides for an MS, such as MS 202, to pre-<br>
register with an SGSN, such as SGSN 250, servicing a neighboring RA, that is, RA 208,<br>
that is a handoff candidate. In pre-registering in a neighboring RA 208 with SGSN 250,<br>
the MS at least partially registers with the SGSN, that is, at least a portion of the MS's<br>
registration information is conveyed to the neighboring SGSN serving the neighboring<br>
RA, prior to the MS being served by an associated neighboring BSS 230, for example,<br>
prior to an initiation of a handoff of the MS to neighboring BSS 230. By pre-registering<br>
with a potential target SGSN, the duration of a registration process and the corresponding<br>
service disruptions when the MS is handed off to such an SGSN are reduced.<br>
 FIG. 3 is a logic flow diagram 300 of a process whereby an MS in communication<br>
system 200, such as MS 202, pre-registers in a potential target RA, and in particular with<br>
a potential target SGSN, such as SGSN 250, in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Logic flow diagram 300 begins (302) when an MS, such as MS 202,<br><br>
initially registers (304) with a serving BSS and a serving SGSN, that is, BSS 220 and<br>
SGSN 240. As part of the registration process, serving BSS 220, and in particular<br>
controller 224 of serving BSS 220, assembles (306) Neighbor List 216 and conveys (308)<br>
the assembled Neighbor List to MS 202. In another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
Neighbor List 216 may be assembled by serving SGSN 240 and conveyed by the SGSN<br>
to MS 202. Unless otherwise specified herein, all functions performed herein by MS 202,<br>
controller 224, controller 234, SGSN 240, or SGSN 250 are respectively performed by<br>
processor 203, 226, 236, 242, and 252. Furthermore, unless otherwise specified herein,<br>
all functions performed herein by BSS 220 or BSS 230 are respectively performed by<br>
controllers 224 and 234, and specifically by processors 226 and 236 of controllers 224<br>
and 234.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, Neighbor List 216 may be a typical<br>
Neighbor List of the prior art, comprising a list of broadcast channels (BCCH) associated<br>
with each of multiple neighboring BSSs, such as a broadcast channel associated with BSS<br>
230. In such an embodiment of the present invention, each BSS of the multiple<br>
neighboring BSSs broadcasts information concerning an RA and or SGSN associated<br>
with the BSS via the associated broadcast channel. In response to receiving Neighbor<br>
List 216, MS 202 monitors the listed broadcast channels and receives the RA and/or<br>
SGSN information from each BSS included in the Neighbor List.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, Neighbor List 216, in addition to<br>
including a list of broadcast channels (BCCH) associated with each of multiple-<br>
neighboring BSSs, further includes, in association with each broadcast channel listed in<br>
the Neighbor List, an indicator of an RA or SGSN associated with the corresponding<br>
BSS. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, Neighbor List 216 may<br>
include a single bit that indicates whether the BSS is a member of a same RA 206 as the<br>
first, serving or source, BSS 220. That is, from another perspective, Neighbor List 216<br>
may indicate, for each listed broadcast channel, whether the corresponding BSS is<br>
serviced by a same SGSN as the SGSN 240 servicing the serving BSS 220. For example,<br>
Neighbor List 216 may include, in association with each listed broadcast channel, an RA<br>
membership data field. When the corresponding BSS is included in a same RA as source<br>
BSS 220, that is, is serviced by a same SGSN 240 as source BSS 220, then serving SGSN<br><br>
240 may embed a value of '1' in the RA membership data field. When the corresponding<br>
BSS is included in an RA, such as RA 208 with respect to BSS 230 and SGSN 250,<br>
different from the RA serviced by source BSS 220 and source SGSN 240, then serving<br>
SGSN 240 may embed a value of '0' in the RA membership data field.<br>
For example, Neighbor List 216 may be conveyed to MS 202 via a modified<br>
version of a System Information (SI) message, such as a modified SI 2, SI2bis, SI5, or an<br>
SI5bis message. La order to provide an indicator of an RA or SGSN associated with each<br>
BSS in the Neighbor List, infrastructure 270 may modify the SI message to include the<br>
RA or SGSN indicator. An example of such a modified SI message is depicted in FIG. 4.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, an exemplary, modified SI message 400 may include a Layer 2<br>
Pseudo Length data field 402, a Protocol Discrirninator data field 404, a Skip Indicator<br>
data field 406, a Message Type data field 408, a Neighbor Cell Description data field 410<br>
that informs of multiple neighbor cells and associated BSSs, such as a list of broadcast<br>
frequencies of each of multiple neighboring BSSs, a Network Colour Code (NCC)<br>
Permitted data field 412, and a Random Access Channel (RACH) Parameters data field<br>
414. Such data fields are typical of an SI message. However, unlike a typical SI<br>
message, SI message 400 further includes an RA Membership data field 416 informing of<br>
an RA/SGSN associated with, or not associated with, each of the multiple neighbor cells<br>
and associated BSSs. SGSN 240 may then embed the RA/SGSN indicators in data field<br>
416.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, instead of an indicator indicating<br>
a 'same' or 'different' RA or SGSN, each indicator may comprise an identifier associated<br>
with the RA in which the corresponding BSS located or an identifier associated with the<br>
SGSN servicing the corresponding BSS. For example, the identifier may comprise a code<br>
mat is uniquely associated with the RA or may comprise an identifier, such as a routing<br>
address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, that is uniquely associated with the<br>
SGSN. However, an advantage of using an indicator comprising a single bit is that a<br>
mere 16 bits, or two octets, are consumed in indicating an RA, or SGSN, associated with<br>
each of 16 broadcast channels typically included in a Neighbor List.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 3, in response to receiving (310) Neighbor List 216, MS<br><br>
202 stores (312) the received Neighbor List in the at least one memory device 204 of the<br>
MS. Based on Neighbor List 216 and/or in response to at least one of a change in channel<br>
conditions between MS 202 and BSS 220, a change in channel conditions between MS<br>
202 and a neighboring BSS associated with an SGSN other than serving SGSN 240, such<br>
as BSS 230 and SGSN 250, and a movement of MS 202, MS 202 then pre-registers (314)<br>
in at least one RA, such as RA 208, and with an associated SGSN, that is, SGSN 250,<br>
that is associated with a BSS 230 corresponding to a channel in the Neighbor List and<br>
that is different than the RA 206/SGSN 240 associated with serving BSS 220. In pre-<br>
registering with a neighboring RA 208/SGSN 250, MS 202 at least partially registers with<br>
such an RA/SGSN prior to MS 202 being served by the associated neighboring BSS 230. .<br>
In pre-registering MS 202 with neighboring RA 208/SGSN 250, at least a portion of the<br>
registration information associated with the MS is conveyed to, and received by,<br>
neighboring SGSN 250. In response to receiving the registration information, SGSN 250<br>
stores (316) the registration information in the at least one memory device 254 of the<br>
SGSN and logic flow 300 then ends (318).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the step of pre-registering (314) with<br>
RA 208/SGSN 250 may be initiated.by MS 202. FIG. 5 is a logic flow diagram 500<br>
depicting an MS-initiated pre-registration in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 500 begins (502) when MS 202 determines (504)<br>
to pre-register with a neighbor SGSN, that is, SGSN 250. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, step 504 may comprise the following steps. In response to receiving ,<br>
Neighbor List 216, MS 202 determines whether any neighbor BSS, that is, a BSS<br>
associated with a communication channel in the Neighbor List, is further associated with<br>
an RA or SGSN different than the RA 206 or SGSN 240 associated with serving BSS<br>
220. In response to determining that a BSS, such as BSS 230, associated with a<br>
communication channel in the Neighbor List is further associated with a neighbor RA or<br>
SGSN, such as RA 208 and SGSN 250, different than the serving RA 206 or serving<br>
SGSN 240, MS 202 determines to pre-register with the neighbor RA or SGSN.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, step 504 may comprise the<br>
following steps. In response to receiving Neighbor List 216, MS 202 may monitor each<br>
broadcast channel identified in the Neighbor List. MS 202 determines a signal quality<br><br>
metric, such as a signal strength, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or a bit error rate (BER),<br>
with respect to each monitored channel and compares each determined signal quality<br>
metric to a pre-registration signal quality metric threshold that is maintained in the at least<br>
one memory device 204 of the MS. When a determined signal quality metric compares<br>
favorably with the pre-registration signal quality metric threshold, for example, exceeds a<br>
signal strength threshold or a SNR threshold, then MS 202 determines to pre-register with<br>
a neighbor SGSN associated with the monitored broadcast channel and an associated<br>
BSS. MS 202 may further determine that the neighbor RA/SGSN is different than the<br>
serving RA/SGSN, or the serving SGSN, that is, SGSN 240, may determine that the<br>
neighbor RA/SGSN associated with the neighbor BSS is different than the serving<br>
RA/SGSN.<br>
In response to detennining to pre-register with a neighbor SGSN, that is, SGSN<br>
250, MS 202 conveys (506) a pre-registration request to infrastructure 270. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, MS 202 may convey a pre-registration request to<br>
infrastructure 270 by conveying a first pre-registration request 218 to BSS 220 via the at<br>
least one control channel in reverse link 212, and via BSS 220 to serving SGSN 240. First pre-registration request 218 requests that infrastructure 270 pre-register MS 202<br>
with neighbor SGSN 250. Pre-registration request 218 may specifically identify the<br>
neighbor SGSN, that is, SGSN 250, or an RA, that is, RA 208, associated with the<br>
neighbor BSS 230 and neighbor SGSN, or serving SGSN 240 may determine the<br>
neighbor SGSN by retrieving Neighbor List information stored in the at least one memory<br>
device 244 of the serving SGSN in response to receiving the pre-registration request.<br>
In response to receiving pre-registration request 218, serving SGSN 240 conveys<br>
(508) registration information associated with MS 202 to the neighbor SGSN, that is,<br>
SGSN 250. In one embodiment of the present invention, serving SGSN 240 may convey<br>
to SGSN 250 at least a portion of the registration information associated with MS 202<br>
and maintained by the serving SGSN in the at least one memory device 244. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, pre-registration request 218 may further include<br>
registration information intended for SGSN 250. In response to receiving pre-registration<br>
request 218, serving SGSN 240 forwards the received registration information to SGSN<br>
250. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, in response to receiving pre-<br><br>
registration request 218, serving SGSN may request registration information from MS<br>
202, for example, by conveying a registration request to MS 202. In response to<br>
receiving the registration request, MS 202 may convey registration information to SGSN<br>
240, which registration information is forwarded by SGSN 240 to SGSN 250. Serving<br>
SGSN 240 may convey the registration information to SGSN 250 via GGSN 260 or, in<br>
response to receiving pre-registration request 218, may establish a point-to-point<br>
communication with SGSN 250 and convey the information via the established point-to-<br>
point communication. In response to receiving the registration information from SGSN<br>
240, SGSN 250 stores (510) the registration information in the at least one memory<br>
device 254 of the SGSN. In addition, in response to receiving registration information for<br>
MS 202 from SGSN 240, SGSN 250 may also establish (518) communication links with<br>
BSS 230 and/or GGSN 260 for transmission of data to and from MS 202. Logic flow 500<br>
then ends (520).		<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, instead of conveying first pre- registration request 218 to serving BSS 20, MS 202 may convey a second pre-registration<br>
request 219 to neighbor BSS 230 via a control channel in a reverse link 214 between the MS and BSS 230, and via BSS 230 to SGSN 250. Second pre-registration request 219<br>
requests that BSS 230 and associated SGSN. 250 pre-register MS 202. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, second pre-registration request 219 may identify serving SGSN 240. In response to receiving pre-registration request 219, SGSN 250 may<br>
request (512), from serving SGSN 240, at least a portion of registration information<br>
associated with MS 202. The request maybe conveyed by SGSN 250 to SGSN 240 via<br>
GGSN 260 or via a communication link established between SGSN 250 and SGSN 240.<br>
In response to receiving the request for at least a portion of the registration information,<br>
SGSN 240 then conveys (514) the requested information to SGSN 250 and SGSN 250<br>
stores the received registration information in the at least one memory device 254. In<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, second pre-registration request 219 may not<br>
identify SGSN 240. In such an embodiment of the present invention, in response to<br>
receiving the second pre-registration request, SGSN 250 may initiate (516) a pre-<br>
registration process with MS 202 that comprises steps of a typical registration process<br>
involving an exchange of registration information between MS 202 and SGSN 250. In<br><br>
yet another embodiment of the present invention, pre-registration request 219 may further<br>
include registration information associated with MS 202. In response to receiving pre-<br>
registration request 219, serving SGSN 250 stores the received registration information in<br>
the at least one memory device 254. Logic flow 500 then ends (520).<br>
In each of the above embodiments of an MS initiated pre-registration, in addition<br>
to obtaining registration information concerning MS 202, neighboring SGSN 250 may<br>
also establish (518) communication links with BSS 230 and/or GGSN 260 for<br>
transmission of data to and from MS 202 as part of the pre-registration process. In still<br>
other embodiments of the present invention, the step of pre-registering (314) MS 202<br>
with RA 208/SGSN 250 may be initiated by infrastructure 270. Referring now to FIGs.<br>
6A and 6B, a logic flow diagram 600 is depicted of an infrastructure-initiated pre-<br>
registration in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. In one<br>
embodiment of an infrastructure-initiated pre-registration process, logic flow diagram 600<br>
begins (602) when infrastructure 270 receives (604), from MS 202, signal quality<br>
information corresponding to Neighbor List communication channels monitored by the<br>
MS. In one such embodiment, similar to the MS-imtiated pre-registration embodiment,<br>
in response to receiving Neighbor List 216, MS 202 monitors each broadcast channel<br>
identified in the Neighbor List. MS 202 determines a signal quality metric, such as a<br>
signal strength, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or a bit error rate (BER), with respect to<br>
each monitored channel and conveys the signal quality metrics to infrastructure 270 via<br>
serving BSS 220.<br>
Based on the received signal quality information, serving BSS 220, and in<br>
particular serving controller 224, or serving SGSN 240 then determines (606) whether to<br>
pre-register MS 202 with a neighboring RA 208/SGSN 250 associated with a<br>
communication channel of Neighbor List 216. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, wherein infrastructure 270 receives signal quality metrics from MS 202,<br>
serving BSS 220 or serving SGSN 240 then compares each received signal quality metric<br>
to a pre-registration signal quality metric threshold. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, MS 202 may perform the comparison and convey the results of the comparison<br>
to infrastructure 270. When serving BSS 220 performs the comparison or receives<br>
comparison results from MS 202 and a determination of whether to pre-register MS 202<br><br>
with a neighboring RA/SGSN resides in serving SGSN 240, the serving BSS conveys the<br>
comparison results to serving SGSN 240. When a determined signal quality metric<br>
compares favorably with the pre-registration signal quality metric threshold and serving<br>
BSS 220 or serving SGSN 240, whichever element of communication system 200 is<br>
making the pre-registration decision, further determines that the SGSN associated with<br>
the monitored signal, such as SGSN 250, is different than the serving SGSN, then the<br>
serving BSS or SGSN determines to initiate a pre-registration of MS 202 with such<br>
neighbor SGSN.<br>
In another infrastructure-initiated embodiment of the present invention, serving<br>
BSS 220, and in particular serving controller 224, or serving SGSN 240 may determine<br>
whether to pre-register MS 202 based on a location of the MS. In such an embodiment,<br>
logic flow diagram 600 may begin (602) when a location of MS 202 is determined (608).<br>
In one such embodiment, MS 202 may self-determine its geographical location and<br>
convey the determined geographical location to infrastructure 270. Methods by which an<br>
MS may self-determine its geographical location are well-known in the art and will not be<br>
described in detail herein. For example, MS 202 may self-determine its geographical<br>
location based on location information received from each of multiple BSSs in<br>
communication system 200, such as based on a time difference of arrival (TDOA) of pilot<br>
signals received from each of the multiple BSSs. By way of another example, MS 202<br>
may further include a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (npt shown) and may<br>
self-determine its geographical location by reference to a constellation of GPS satellites.<br>
MS 202 then conveys its determined geographical location, or at least the received<br>
location information, to infrastructure 270 via serving BSS 220, which geographical<br>
location or location information is routed to SGSN 240 or to controller 224 of BSS 220.<br>
Upon receiving the location information from MS 202, serving SGSN 240 or<br>
serving BSS 220 determines a geographical location of the MS based on the geographical<br>
location determined by MS 202 or based on the location information received from MS<br>
202 and further retrieves the geographical locations of the BSSs associated with the<br>
Neighbor List of MS 202 from a respective at least one memory device 228,244. When<br>
controller 224 determines the locations of MS 202 and/or BSSs 220 and 230, the<br>
controller may convey each such location determination to SGSN 240. Based on the<br><br>
determined locations of MS 202 and at least one of BSSs 220 and 230, serving BSS 220<br>
or serving SGSN 240 then determines (610) whether to initiate a pre-registration of MS<br>
202 with SGSN 250.<br>
For example, serving BSS 220 or serving SGSN 240 may determine, based on<br>
multiple determinations of a geographical location of MS 202, that MS 202 is headed in a<br>
direction toward BSS 230. In response to determining that MS 202 is headed toward BSS<br>
230, BSS 220 or SGSN 240 may determine (612) to initiate a pre-registration of MS 202<br>
with SGSN 250. By way of another example, based on a determined location of MS 202<br>
and BSS 230, BSS 220 or SGSN 240 may determine that MS 202 has moved to within a<br>
predetermined distance of BSS 230. In response to deterrnining that MS 202 has moved<br>
to within the predetermined distance, BSS 220 or SGSN 240 may determine (612) to<br>
initiate a pre-registration of MS 202 with SGSN 250. By way of yet another example, the<br>
at least one memory device 228, 244 of BSS 220 or SGSN 240 may maintain a<br>
geographical location of a border, for handoff purposes, between a coverage area<br>
associated with BSS 220 and a coverage area associated with BSS 230. When BSS 220<br>
or SGSN 240 determines that MS 202 has moved to within a geographical distance of the<br>
border, the BSS or SGSN may determine (612) to initiate a pre-registration of MS 202<br>
with RA 208/SGSN 250.<br>
In response to deterrnining to initiate a pre-registration of MS 202 with RA<br>
208/SGSN 250, BSS 220 or SGSN 240 may either instruct (616) the MS to pre-register or<br>
may pre-register (614) the MS with SGSN 250. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention wherein serving BSS 220 or serving SGSN 240 pre-registers (614) MS 202<br>
with RA 208/SGSN 250, serving BSS 220 may instruct serving SGSN 240 to pre-register<br>
MS 202, or serving SGSN 240 may on its own pre-register MS 202, with neighboring<br>
SGSN 250 as is described in detail above. For example, serving SGSN 240 may pre-<br>
register MS 202 by conveying to neighboring SGSN 250 at least a portion of the<br>
registration information associated with MS 202 and maintained in the at least one<br>
memory device 244 of the serving SGSN. Serving SGSN 240 may convey the<br>
information via GGSN 260 or may establish a point-to-point communication with SGSN<br>
250 and convey the information via the established point-to-point communication.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention wherein BSS 220 or SGSN 240<br>
instructs (616) the MS to pre-register, serving BSS 220 or serving SGSN 240 may convey<br>
a pre-registration instruction to MS 202 via the broadcast channel or the at least one<br>
control channel in forward link 211. The pre-registration instruction instructs MS 202 to<br>
 pre-register. In one such embodiment, in response receiving the pre-registration<br>
instruction, MS 202 conveys (618) to serving SGSN 240 via serving BSS 220, and the<br>
serving SGSN receives (620) from the MS, a pre-registration request such as pre-<br>
registration request 218. In response to receiving me pre-registration request, serving<br>
SGSN 240 then pre-registers (622) MS 202 with neighbor SGSN 250 as described above,<br>
 for example, by conveying to SGSN 250 registration information stored in the at least one<br>
memory device 244 of serving SGSN 240 or by forwarding registration information<br>
received by the serving SGSN from MS 202. Logic flow 600 then ends (636).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, in response receiving the pre-<br>
registration instruction, MS 202 may identify (624) neighboring SGSN 250 or an<br>
associated RA 208 based on the Neighbor List maintained in the at least one memory<br>
device 204 of the MS and convey (626) a pre-registration request, such as pre-registration<br>
request 219, to the neighboring SGSN. In response to receiving the pre-registration<br>
request, neighboring SGSN 250 pre-registers (628) MS 202 as described above, for<br>
example, by obtaining registration information associated with MS 202 from SGSN 240,<br>
by engaging in a registration procedure with MS 202, or by storing registration<br>
information that may be included in the received pre-registration request Logic flow 600<br>
then ends (636).<br>
In still another embodiment, the pre-registration instruction may include an<br>
identifier associated with neighboring SGSN 250. In response to receiving the pre-<br>
registration instruction, MS 202 identifies (630) neighboring SGSN 250 based on the<br>
received instruction and conveys (632) a pre-registration request to the neighboring<br>
SGSN. In response to receiving the pre-registration request, SGSN 250 pre-registers<br>
(634) MS 202 as described above and logic flow 600 men ends (636).<br>
In each of the above embodiments, as part of the pre-registration of MS 202 with<br>
SGSN 250, SGSN 250 may further establish communication links with BSS 230 and/or<br><br>
GGSN 260 for transmission of data to and from MS 202.<br>
By providing for a pre-registration of MS 202 with a neighboring SGSN 250<br>
serving a neighboring RA 208 and a neighboring BSS 230 that are handoff candidates for<br>
MS 202, communication system 200 reduces a duration of a registration process and the<br>
corresponding service disruptions when the MS is handed off to such an RA and SGSN.<br>
In pre-registering in the neighboring RA 208 with SGSN 250, MS 202 at least partially<br>
registers with SGSN 250, that is, at least a portion of the MS's registration information is<br>
conveyed to the neighboring SGSN prior to the MS being served by an associated<br>
neighboring BSS 230, for example, prior to an initiation of a handoff of the MS to the<br>
neighboring BSS 230. In various embodiments of the present invention, the at least a portion of the MS's registration information may be conveyed by the serving SGSN 240<br>
to the neighboring SGSN 250 in response to a self-initiated transfer by the serving SGSN<br>
or in response to a request received by the serving SGSN from MS 202 or from the<br>
neighboring SGSN. In other embodiments of the present invention, the at least a portion<br>
of the MS's registration information may be conveyed by MS 202 to neighboring SGSN<br>
250 in response to a self-initiated pre-registration by the MS or in response to an<br>
instruction received by the MS from either serving BSS 220 or SGSN 240.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REGISTERING A MOBILE STATION"<br>
A communication system (200) provides for a mobile station (MS) (202) to pre-register with a Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node (SGSN) (250) servicing a neighboring Routing Area (RA) (208) that is a handoff<br>
candidate. In pre-registering with the neighboring RA and SGSN, the MS at least partially registers<br>
with the RA and SGSN, that is, at least a portion of the MS's registration information is conveyed to<br>
the neighboring SGSN serving the neighboring RA, prior to the MS being served by an associated<br>
neighboring BSS (230), for example, prior to an initiation of a handoff of the MS to the neighboring<br>
BSS. By pre-registering with the candidate SGSN, a duration of a registration process and the<br>
corresponding service disruptions when the MS is handed off to such an SGSN are reduced.</td>
