The invention relates to a process for producing a compound according to formula (i),<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
or salt thereof,<br>
wherein R1 and R1 are independently hydrogen or an amine protecting group, and R2 is a carboxyl group or an ester group, comprising reacting a compound according to formula (ii),<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
or salt thereof,<br>
wherein R1, R1' and R2 are defined as above, with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and a chiral ligand, wherein the transition metal is selected from group 7, 8 or 9 of the periodic table.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to products obtainable by said process and to their use in the production of NEP inhibitors. Moreover, the invention relates to<br>
the use of transition metal catalyst in the preparation NEP inhibitors or prodrugs thereof, in particular NEP inhibitors comprising a y-amino-5-biphenyl-a-methylalkanoic acid, or acid ester, backbone.<br>
Endogenous atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP), also called atrial natriuretic factors (ANF) have diuretic, natriuretic and vasorelaxant functions in mammals. The natural ANF peptides are metabolically inactivated, in particular by a degrading enzyme which has been recognized to correspond to the enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11), also responsible for e.g. the metabolic inactivation of enkephalins.<br>
In the art biaryl substituted phosphonic acid derivatives are known which are useful as neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors, e.g. as inhibitors of the ANF-degrading enzyme in mammals, so as to prolong and potentiate the diuretic, natriuretic and vasodilator properties of ANF in mammals by inhibiting the degradation thereof to less active metabolites. NEP inhibitors are thus particularly useful for the treatment of conditions and disorders responsive to the inhibition of "neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11), particularly cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, renal insufficiency including edema and salt retention, pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.<br>
Processes for preparing NEP-inhibitors are known. Those processes usually comprise a hydrogenation step with a palladium catalyst on carbon:<br>
US 5 217 996 describes biaryl substituted 4-amino-butyric acid amide derivatives which are useful as neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors, e.g. as inhibitors of the ANF-degrading enzyme in mammals. US 5 217 996 discloses N-(3-carboxyl-1-oxopropyl)-(4S)-(p-phenylphenylmethyl)-4-amino-(2R)-methyl butanoic acid ethyl ester as a preferred embodiment. In the preparation of said compound N-t-butoxycarbonyl-(4R)-(p-phenylphenylmethyl)-4-amino-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid ethyl ester 1(ii-a) (4.2 g) is hydrogenated in the presence of palladium on charcoal to give N-t-butoxycaTbonyl-(4S)-(p-phenylphenylmethyl)-<br>
4-amino-2-methylbutanoic acid ethyl ester as a 80 : 20 mixture of diastereomers 1(i-a):1(i-b).<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
US 5 250 522 describes phosphonomethyl-biaryl substituted amino acid derivatives which show NEP inhibitor activity. A preferred embodiment is (S)-5-(Biphenyl-4-yl)-4-[(dimethylphosphonomethyl)-amino]-2-pentenoic acid ethyl ester. In an intermediate step of the preparation of said NEP inhibitor, (S)-4-(t-Butoxycarbonylamino)-5-(biphenyl-4-yl)-pentenoic acid ethyl ester is hydrogenated with a palladium catalyst on carbon to yield (S)-4-(t-butoxycarbonylamino)-5-(biphenyl-4-yl)-pentanoic acid ethyl ester.<br>
Several dicarboxylic acid dipeptide neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors are described in G.M. Kasander et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1689-1700, "Dicarboxylic Acid Dipeptide Neutral Endopeptidase Inhibitors". In the preparation of said inhibitors a palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation occurs.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide an alternative hydrogenation step in a process 1m-produc\ng NEP inhibitors or prodrugs thereof, in particular it was an object to provide an alternative process for producing compounds according to formula (i), or salts thereof, which can be used as intermediates in the preparation of NEP inhibitors,  or prodrugs thereof,  in  particular NEP<br>
inhibitors comprising a y-amino-8-biphenyl-a-methylalkanoic acid, or acid ester, backbone.<br>
It was a further object to provide a process in which heterogeneous carriers can be avoided.<br>
It was a still further object to provide a process for producing compounds according to formulae (i-a) and (i-b), or salts thereof, wherein R1, R1" and R2 are defined as above, having a high diastereomeric ratio, preferably more than 88: 12.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
It was an even further object to provide a process for obtaining a high diastereomeric ratio of compounds according to formula (i-a), or salts thereof, to compounds according to formula (i-b), or salts thereof; preferably higher than 88 : 12; more preferably higher than 90 : 10. It was also an object to provide a process in which the compounds according to formula (i-b), or salts thereof, can be completely removed and compounds according to formula (i-a), or salts thereof, can be provided in pure form.<br>
It was yet a further object to provide a process for obtaining a diastereomeric ratio of compounds according to formula (i-b), or salts thereof, to compounds according to formula (i-a), or salts thereof, higher than 88 : 12, preferably more than 90 :10. It was also an object to provide a process in which the compounds<br>
according to formula (i-a), or salts thereof, can be completely removed and compounds according to formula (i-b), or salts thereof, can be provided in pure form.<br>
It was a still further object to provide a process for producing compounds according to formulae (i-c) and (i-d), or salts thereof, wherein R1, R1' and R2 are defined as above, having a high diastereomeric ratio, preferably more than 88:12.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
It was an even further object to provide a process for obtaining a diastereomeric ratio of compounds according to formula (i-c), or salts thereof, to compounds according to formula (i-d), or salts thereof, higher than 88 :12, preferably more than 90 : 10. It was also an object to provide a process in which the compounds according to formula (i-c), or salts thereof, can be completely removed and compounds according to formula (i-d), or salts thereof, can be provided in pure form.<br>
It was another object to provide a hydrogenation step in a process for producing NEP inhibitors or prodrugs thereof, in particular KEP inhibitors comprising a y-amino-5-biphenyl-α-methylalkanoic acid, or acid ester, backbone, wherein the hydrogenation step preferably has a high yield and preferably leads to products<br>
having a high purity degree, preferably products in a diasteromeric ratio higher than 88: 12~<br>
The objects of the present invention can be achieved by using a specific catalyst and a specific chiral ligand in a hydrogenation step in the production of an NEP inhibitor, in particular a NEP inhibitor comprising a y-amino-8-biphenyl-α-methylalkanoic acid, or acid ester, backbone. Preferably, a specific catalyst and a specific chiral ligand are used in a hydrogenation reaction of compounds according to formula (ii), or salts thereof, particularly in a hydrogenation reaction of compounds according to formula (ii-a), or salts thereof,<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein R1, R1' and R2 are defined as above.<br>
In a further embodiment a specific catalyst and a specific chiral ligand are used in a hydrogenation reaction of compounds according to formula (ii-b),<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
or salts thereof,<br>
wherein R1, R1' and R2 are defined as above.<br>
Therefore, the subject-matter of the present invention is a process for producing a compound according to formula (i),<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
or salt thereof,<br>
wherein R1 and R1" independently are hydrogen or an amine protecting group<br>
and R2 is a carboxyl group or an ester group.,<br>
comprising reacting a compound according to formula (ii),<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
or salt thereof,<br>
wherein R1, RV and R2 are defined as above,<br>
with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and a chiral ligandT<br>
wherein the transition metal is selected from group 7, 8 or 9 of the periodic table.<br>
In formulae (i) and (ii) the term " " represents a covalent bond, wherein the stereochemistry of the bond is determined, as either (S) configuration or as (R) configuration of such a chiral centre.<br>
Consequently, compounds according to formula (ii), or salts thereof, are chiral compounds and refer to compounds according to formula (ii-a), or salts thereof, or compounds according to formula (ii-b), or salts thereof.<br>
Accordingly, compounds according to formula (i), or salts thereof, are chiral compounds and refer to compounds according to formulae (i-a), (i-b), (i-c) and (i-d), or salts thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for diastereoselectively hydrogenating a compound of formula (ii) with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and a chiral ligand. The starting material of formula (ii) is chiral, therefore the chirality of both the substrate and the ligand affect the diasteoselectivity in a phenomenon termed "double diastereodifferentiation", ("matched" and "mistmatched" double asymmetric induction).<br>
The degree of facial selectivity observed in the hydrogenation of a chiral compound of formula (ii) in the absence of any other chiral element is the degree of substrate control.<br>
If the facial selectivity of the substrate matches the facial selectivity of the ligand ("matched" double asymmetric induction), the diastereoselectivity of the hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst and a chiral ligand would be expected to increase. But, if the facial selectivity of the substrate does not match the facial selectivity of the ligand ("mismatched" double asymmetric induction), high diastereoselectivity would not be expected.<br>
It has been discovered that by employing a process according to the present invention, the hydrogenation of a compound of formula (ii) can be achieved in high diastereoselectivity regardless of the degree of substrate control. Therefore, even when the degree of substrate control is high (for example a diasteromeric ratio of up to 80 to 20), the process of the present invention provides means to obtain any of the possible diasteromeric products with high diastereoselectivity. Thus, advantageously, the present invention allows the stereocontrolled hydrogenation of compounds of formula (ii) regardless of the stereochemistry of the starting compound of formula (ii). The process described herein can thus provide any of (i-a), (i-b), (i-c) and (i-d) with high diastereomeric excess. Accordingly, by employing the process of the present invention, the hydrogenation of a compound of formula (ii-a) can lead to both (i-a) and (i-b) with high diastereomeric excess. Similarly, the hydrogenation of a compound of formula (ii-b) can lead to both (i-c) and (i-d) with high diastereomeric excess.<br>
The compounds of formula (i) have a y-amino-5-biphenyl-α-methylalkanoic acid backbone. There are known NEP inhibitors, which have a y-amino-5-biphenyl-α-methylalkanoic acid backbone, such as N-(3-carboxy-1-oxopropyl)-(4S)-p-phenylphenylmethyl)-4-amino-(2R)-methylbutanoic acid. Therefore, the present invention provides a novel asymmetric approach towards the preparation of NEP inhibitors. More importantly, the approach proceeds with high stereocontrol.<br>
In formulae (i) and (ii) R1 and R1" are independently hydrogen or an amine protecting group.<br>
It is preferred that R1 is an amine protecting group. It is further preferred that RV is hydrogen. That means, in a preferred embodiment R1 is one of the below explained preferred amine protecting groups and R1' is hydrogen. Alternatively, R1 and R1' can together form a cyclic ring structure (and thus form a bifunctional cyclic amine protecting group).<br>
The term "amine protecting group" comprises any group which is capable of reversibly protecting the amino functionality. Suitable amine protecting groups are conventionally used in peptide chemistry and are described e.g. in standard reference works such as J. F. W.

Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, and in "Methoden der organi-schen Chemie" (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
