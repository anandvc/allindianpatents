A METHOD AND A SYSTEM FOR STATELESS LOAD SHARING FOR A SERVER CLUSTER IN AN IP-BASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to telecommuni¬cations. In particular, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and system for state¬less load sharing for a server cluster in an IP based telecommunications network with high availability re¬quirements .<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A server cluster is a cluster of multiple server nodes across which server functionalities are distributed. Thus each functionality or application is divided into multiple parallel processes each running on different nodes.<br>
In . an IP (Internet Protocol, IP) based tele¬communications network a server cluster typically has a single IP address identifying it to network elements utilizing its services. Internally, however, each node has at least one unique IP address. Using either a technique referred to as load sharing or a technique referred to as load balancing incoming IP traffic is distributed between the nodes. Load sharing refers to forwarding requests to server nodes. Load balancing refers to distributing requests to server nodes based on feedback from each node.<br>
A typical server cluster comprises hundreds of nodes. New nodes may need to be added to the clus¬ter, existing nodes may need to be removed or existing nodes may simply break down. A change in the cluster size will cause a reconfiguration or a reassignment of the nodes.<br>
The IP traffic transmitted to a server clus¬ter comprises sessions each of which comprises indi¬vidual packets. All the packets of a session must be forwarded  to  the  same  server  node.  This  can  be<br><br>
achieved using either a stateful implementation or stateless implementation.<br>
A stateful implementation of load sharing typically uses a stateful load balancer maintaining a session table which contains sessions served at one time. Using the session table the- load balancer can forward subsequent IP packets belonging to a particu¬lar session to the same server node as the first packet of the session. An example of this approach is the Serverlron switch by Foundry Networks (http : //www. f oundrynet. com) .<br>
However, there are problems with stateful im¬plementations . First of all, session awareness lowers the throughput of the load balancer. In practice, up to several million session entries are kept in the session table at one time. Thus memory requirements for a session table are significant which makes them difficult to implement. Also, a fault tolerant load balancer must checkpoint all the state information with another unit so that in case of switchover the other unit can assume the role of the failed unit without  interrupt ion.  Thus,  making a stateful load balancer fault tolerant means added complicity and in¬creased signaling load. In addition, there is no way of knowing when a session ends. Usually a timer is used to clear sessions after 1-24 hours.<br>
Stateless implementations of load sharing, such as broadcast based mechanisms for load sharing, do not use a load balancer. Instead they use a static algorithm to decide which server node to process. Typically the algorithm uses a hash function and hash bucket assignments. Examples of stateless implementa¬tions are Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service and DHC Load Balancing Algorithm described in publica¬tion RFC3 074 by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF).<br><br>
However, there are problems with present stateless implementations also. They rely on a broad¬cast mode of communication; incoming packets are re¬ceived by all nodes in a cluster and each node sepa¬rately checks whether it should serve the request. The main problem with current stateless implementations is that they require a great deal of processing power since every packet must be received by all nodes. Ad¬ditionally, they are not designed for systems with high availability requirements. In order to provide carrier grade level service the system downtime must be extremely low, e.g. 0,001% or lower. In addition, systems must be able to undergo normal maintenance op¬erations which should not result in a complete system-wide shutdown or reset. The present solutions do not provide this.<br>
Thus, there is need for a load balancer pro¬viding both scalability and high availability for car¬rier grade level service.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a method and a system for stateless load sharing for a server cluster in an IP based telecommunications network. The system comprises an IP based telecommunications network for dispatching IP traffic comprising sessions comprising packets. Examples of sessions in the context of the present invention are TCP/IP connections (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), SCTP-associations (Stream Control Transmission Protocol); and addition¬ally higher level protocol sessions such as SIP (Ses¬sion Initiation Protocol) sessions and VoIP (Voice over IP) calls. The system further comprises a server cluster comprising functionally identical server nodes for running an application process, each server node of which is assigned at least one unique IP address. The system further comprises one or more functionally<br><br>
identical, stateless loaa Daian^ex t&gt; J_OX reueivmy UXAC IP packets and forwarding them to various server nodes. Forwarding in this context comprises changing destination address including destination port number and modifying checksums accordingly. Forwarding can also include modification to fields of higher-level protocols e.g. changing Stream-ID in the case of SCTP. The load balancers are connected to the server clus¬ter.<br>
According to the invention the load balancers further comprise a distribution key obtainer for iden¬tifying and extracting at least one predetermined field from each dispatched packet or PDU (Protocol Data Unit, PDU) contained within to be used as a packet or PDU specific distribution key. Examples of such fields are Call-ID fields of SIP (Session Initia¬tion Protocol) and Transaction-ID field of TCAP. TCAP refers to Transaction Capabilities Part and it is used in connection with SS7 (Signaling System 7). In a case where a PDU is distributed over several packets, said packets have the same distribution key.<br>
The load balancers further comprise a hasher for hashing each distribution key to obtain an .offset value for each IP packet. Thus the offset value is calculated using the formula:<br>
offset  =  hash(key)   mod Mt<br>
where key represents the distribution key, hash represents a hash function, M represents the num¬ber of hash bucket assignments and mod M represents modulus M of hash value.<br>
The load balancers further comprise a re-solver for resolving a packet specific destination ad¬dress for each packet using the obtained offset val¬ues, said destination address comprising the IP ad-<br><br>
dress of the server node to which said packet is to be forwarded.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the load balancers further comprise an assignment table con¬sisting of entries each comprising an IP address as¬signed to a server node, said table containing the IP address of each server node in one or more entries, and a retriever for retrieving the destination address for a packet from the assignment table by using the obtained offset value of the packet as an index. In an embodiment of the invention the number of entries in the assignment table is larger than the number of server nodes.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention TCP (Trans¬mission Control Protocol, TCP) protocol is used in IP traffic, and a connection tuple <ips ports ipd portd> as a whole or in part is used as the distribu¬tion key. IPs represents the source IP address, port5 represents the source port number, IPD represents the destination IP address and port^ represents the desti¬nation port number.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol, SCTP) protocol is used in IP traffic, and an association <ips ports ipd portd protocol> as a whole or in part is used as the distribution key. IPS represents the source IP ad¬dress, ports represents the source port number, IPD represents the destination IP address, portD repre¬sents the destination port number and protocol repre¬sents the identifier of the higher-level protocol used.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a new node is added to the server cluster, and at least one entry in the assignment table is updated to contain the IP address of the added new node.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a node from the server cluster is removed, and each entry in the<br><br>
assignment table containing the IP address of the re¬moved node is updated to contain the IP address of one of the remaining nodes.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the load balancers further comprise an adder for adding the ob¬tained offset value of a packet to a base address as¬signed to the server cluster to obtain the destination address for the packet, which destination address is one of a range of IP addresses, of which range more than one address is assigned per each server node. Preferably said range of IP addresses is continuous. In an embodiment of the invention the number of ad¬dresses in the range of IP addresses is larger than the number of server nodes.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a new node is added to the server cluster, and at least one ad¬dress of the range of IP addresses is reassigned to the added new node.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a node from the server cluster is removed, and the IP addresses of the removed node are reassigned to the remaining nodes.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention at least one old server node is replaced with at least one new server node, each packet is analyzed to determine whether it initiates a session, packets initiating a session are forwarded to the new server node, and packets not initiating a session are forwarded to both the new server node an'd the old server node. Thus, this approach allows for graceful reassignment of a set of hash buckets from one server node to another. A packet initiating a session is sent only to the new node taking over. All other packets are sent both to the new and the old node or nodes. After a pre¬determined period of time it can be assumed that all sessions served by the old server node have ended and the old node can be taken off-line. In this approach<br><br>
the assignment table has at least two columns; one for new or current assignment and one or more for the old or outgoing assignment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention unicast IP addresses are used as the unique IP addresses assigned to each server node, at least one multicast IP address is bound to several server nodes, each packet is ana¬lyzed to determine whether it initiates a session, packets initiating a session are forwarded using the unicast address as the destination address, and pack¬ets not initiating a session are forwarded using the multicast address as the destination address. Thus this approach allows for graceful reassignment without any assignment table. Each bucket is assigned two IP addresses; a normal unicast address associated with one server node and an IP multicast address bound to several server nodes. The normal unicast address is bound to the incoming node and all packets initiating a session are forwarded with this address. Addition¬ally each outgoing node is bound to one unicast ad¬dress in the scope of the multicast address and all packets not initiating a session are forwarded with this address. Thus reconfiguration of server nodes causes no change in the load balancers. The bindings of the IP addresses to the server nodes are changed to direct traffic to correct nodes.<br>
The present invention provides a load bal¬ancer with both scalability and high availability. Since each load balancer is identical, traffic can pass through any load balancer. If an anycast mecha¬nism, such as IPv6 (Internet Protocol, Version 6) any-cast addresses, is used, each individual packet can be routed through any load balancer. Since the number of hash buckets is larger than the number of server nodes, dynamic scaling and configuration of the server cluster is possible. In particular, the following three scenarios can be handled without having to re-<br><br>
set: unexpected failure of a server node, controlled shutdown of a server node and addition of a new server node to a server cluster.<br>
