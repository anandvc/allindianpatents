				<td>The present invention concerns a machine processing textile material with work- ing elements (W1 -W4, 01 -04,6) for processing textile material (F, 3) which via feeding means (1, 2; 4, 5) is supplied to the working elements and with drive ele- ments (A 1 -A4, 70, 71, 68, 72, 73) for the working elements as well as bearings of the drive elements, and of the working elements respectively, in which ar- rangement the working elements and the drive elements with the respective bearings co-ordinated to them at least partially are located in respective rooms (48,49, 78, 90, 91, 92) during the processing which are separated and limited by walls (50, 51,52, 53,55, 56; 79, 80, 81,44) and in which parts of the working ele- ments via openings (58) in the walls (51&#x27;) extend into the room (90, 91) of the drive elements (70, 71, A1 -A4), and in which means (64) are provided for apply- ing a below atmospheric pressure to the room (48, 49) of the working elements. In machines of this type the danger persists that due to the below atmospheric pressure applied in the zone of the working elements a below atmospheric pres- sure is generated partially too in the zone of the drive elements. This causes free-floating fibres (fibre fly waste) to be sucked in from the room surrounding the machine into these zones resulting in contamination of these zones after a short period of time. Therefore provision of further means (75, 76) is proposed for sup- plying air to said room (90, 91, 92) of the drive elements (A 1 -A4, 70,71,68) and of their respective bearing arrangements at a pressure which is higher than the one in the room surrounding the machine.</td>

Textile Machine<br>
The present invention concerns a textile processing machine according to the introductory part of the patent claim 1.<br>
In textile processing machines, e.g. in combing preparatory machines and draw frames, zones are present in which the textile material supplied is processed using working elements. Thus e.g. in combing preparatory machines fibre slivers taken in from cans are drafted in drafting units and fibre webs are formed. A plurality of fibre webs thus formed are superimposed on a feed table and conveyed to a subsequent lap forming device for formation of a lap. Processing of the textile material is effected in the zone of the rolls of the drafting system in which the fibre material is drafted owing to the different rotational speeds of the drafting rolls. During the drafting process fibres can be loosened from the textile material due to the movements of the working elements (e.g. drafting rolls, pressure rolls) which are dispersed into the surrounding room a so-called fly waste.<br>
During this process also dust still present in the fibre material is given off to the surrounding room. In order to prevent these particles from settling, in particular in the zone of the outer ends of the drafting rolls and of the pressure rollers, air is sucked off at the corresponding points. The drafting system in arrangements of such type as a rule is arranged in a room limited by walls in which corresponding openings are provided for the input and the output of textile material into, and out of, the zone of the drafting system. In these walls also openings must be provided which permit transmission of the drive to the drafting rolls using suitable drive means (e.g. drive shafts). These openings must be of sufficient width as to ensure adaptability of the distances between the drafting rolls. This means that the room provided for the drafting rolls and the pressure rollers due to the openings and to the accessibility required can not be sealed off completely against the other encapsulated zones of the machine in which also the drive means and, partially, the bearings of the drive elements are housed. Thus if a below atmospheric pressure is applied in the working zone, a vacuum necessarily also is created in the other zones and rooms in which drive elements and bearings are<br><br>
housed, especially since both rooms are located directly side by side, or adjacent to each other respectively. Thus also impurities which are present in the surrounding room of the machine e.g. fibre fly waste, via gaps and various openings penetrate into the encapsulated zone, and into the rooms respectively in which the drive elements and in part their bearings are housed.<br>
In order to avoid disturbances and interruptions of the working process these rooms must be cleaned and maintained periodically at certain time intervals.<br>
The effect which results in contamination of drive elements and bearings generally is called also "vacuum cleaner effect". This effect requires considerable maintenance effort and increased attention by the operating personnel.<br>
Similar conditions as found on the combing preparatory machines described also prevail in the drafting systems of draw frames.<br>
Similar conditions also prevail in combing machines where a circular comb for combing fibre material presented clamped by a nipper arrangement is supported in a noil suction chute. This noil suction chute is surrounded by a room limited by walls. In this room in which bearing elements and drive elements are located, impurities consisting of dust and fibre fly waste also can accumulate due to the vacuum created via the comber noil suction chute. As these zones furthermore are not easily accessible, maintenance of these rooms is most difficult and costly.<br>
The goal of the present invention thus is to design the machine processing textile material in such a manner that the maintenance efforts for cleaning are reduced, also for the room limited by walls for the drive elements and the bearings located in this room.<br>
This goal is achieved in that further means are provided for supplying air to said room containing the drive elements and their bearings at a pressure which is higher than the air pressure in the surrounding room. This arrangement prevents fibre fly waste and dust from the surrounding room from being sucked into the<br><br>
room containing the drive elements their bearings. Owing to the proposed combination the settling of, and contamination with, fibre fly waste and dust is avoided as a sub-atmospheric pressure is applied in the zone of the working elements and an above atmospheric pressure is applied in the zone of the drive elements and bearings. Using this arrangement the time required for manual maintenance can be reduced considerably.<br>
The term "working elements" essentially refers to the tools which directly act onto the fibres and which effect a change in the structure of the fibre arrangement of the input textile material.<br>
The term "drive elements" essentially comprises gears, pulleys, drive belts, chains, shafts, etc.<br>
The term "bearings" essentially concerns bearings for shafts, and of axles respectively, of the drive elements and the working elements.<br>
For transmitting the drive power openings are required between the room of the working elements and the room of the drive elements through which e.g. drive shafts can extend. The drive shafts in this arrangement can be the drive axles of the drafting rolls. For sealing these two rooms more efficiently (in one of which above atmospheric pressure and in the other below atmospheric pressure prevails) it is proposed that said openings at lest partially be covered with yielding cover elements. Thus a non-required and undesirable air circulation between these two rooms is stopped.<br>
These cover elements advantageously can be formed by bristles attached on one side of the wall in the zone of the respeective opening.<br>
These cover elements also can be formed by sealing lips, e.g. rubber elements, attached on one side of the wall in the zone of the respecting opening.<br>
Advantageously the means generating an above atmospheric pressure is a fan.<br><br>
For influencing the processing of the textile material it is proposed that said means comprise a device for controlling the humidity of the air supplied to said room.<br>
Furthermore it is proposed that the means comprise a device for controlling the temperature of the air supplied to said room.<br>
In order to maintain said room substantially dust-free it is proposed that a device for filtering the air to be supplied be provided. Essentially a suitable filter element is arranged upstream from the fan in order to keep the air sucked in by the fan dust-free.<br>
Advantageously the means can comprise an air conditioning plant.<br>
It furthermore is proposed that the feed means can consist of a nipper aggregate of a combing machine which presents a fibre beard to be combed clamped in the nipper arrangement to a circular comb which is surrounded by a comber noil suction chute in turn surrounded by a room limited by walls.<br>
Advantageously the suction side of the fan is connected to the comber noil suction chute.<br>
Further advantages of the present invention are described in more detail in the following with reference to illustrated design examples. It is shown in the:<br>
Fig. 1   a schematic vertical section of a combing machine in the zone of a combing head thereof,<br>
Fig. 2   a schematic horizontal section along the line A-A according to the Fig. 1, with further elements indicated schematically with boxes,<br>
Fig. 3   a schematic top view of a drafting system unit in the feed plate zone of a<br><br>
lap-forming combing preparatory machine,<br>
Fig. 4   a schematic side view according to the Fig. 3,<br>
Fig. 5 an enlarged part view according to the Fig. 4 in the transition zone of the drive shafts from the room in which above atmospheric pressure prevails into the room in which below atmospheric pressure prevails, and in the:<br>
Fig. 6   a part top view according to the Fig. 5.<br>
According to the Fig. 1 a combing head of a combing machine comprises an oscillating nipper aggregate 1 in which an intermittently rotatable feed roll or cylinder 2 is supported. From a lap 3 supported on two rotatable lap rolls 4 and 5 a lap layer to be combed is fed to the feed cylinder 2. In a retracted position of the nipper aggregate 1 a fibre beard of the lap layer supplied is clamped between the nipper plates of the nipper aggregate 1 and is combed by a rotating circular comb 6 with which a circular comb brush 7 co-operates. The nipper aggregate 1 then moves into its forward end position and is opened, and the fibre beard is detached from the lap layer by a detaching aggregate with pairs of rolls 8 and 9 and is joined to the previously formed web of combed fibre material.<br>
The combed sliver from a combing head then is transferred via a web guide plate 10 (also called web dish) to the take-off roll pairs 11 and 12, which convey it in sliver or web form onto a delivery plate 13 which is co-ordinated jointly to all combing heads of the machine.<br>
The circular comb 6 is surrounded by a comber noil suction chute provided with a front wall 14, two side walls 15 (Fig. 2) and 16, and with a back wall 17. The chute 14,15,16,17 merges into a lower suction duct 18 which again is co-ordinated jointly to all combing heads on a combing machine. Via the chute 14, 15, 16,17 and the duct 18 comber noils (short fibres) and impurities are carried off pneumatically which were taken off the fibre beards by the circular comb 6 and by a fixed comb (not shown specifically). In the chute 14,15,16,17 also the ro-<br><br>
tating circular comb brush roll 7 is arranged.<br>
The comber noil suction chute 14,15,16,17 is surrounded by a room limited laterally by walls 19, 20, 21 and 22, namely by a front cover plate 19, a back cover plate 20, and two side plates 21 and 22. In the side plates 21 and 22 the shafts of the driven rolls of the combing head are supported. To each of the side plates 21 and 22 each further combing head units can be added which are laid out substantially identically with the one described above.<br>
Combing machines of the type described above are well known. In the known combing machines the fibres and impurities accumulating in the room surrounding the comber noil suction chute 14,15,16,17 present a problem. These fibres and impurities in particular originate from the lap layer which moves from the lap 3 to the feed roll 2 and from the web which moves from the detaching aggregate 8, 9 via the web guide plate 10 and through the take-off rolls 11 and 12. Cleaning of the walls of said room, in particular upstream, and to the sides, of the comber noil suction chute 14,15,16, 17 proves difficult and time-consuming these walls not being easily accessible.<br>
According to the present invention means are provided for supplying air into said room under an pressure which is higher than the one prevailing in the room surrounding the combing machine. These means comprise an air supply duct 23 extending from a fan 24 and ending in an opening merging into said room as e.g. indicated schematically in an opening 25 in the front cover plate 19. Thus in said room an elevated pressure prevails and air streams are generated escaping from the room into the surrounding room. These air streams prevent fibres and impurities, which can be lost from the lap layer moving towards the feed roll 2 or from the web between the detaching aggregate 8, 9 and the take-off rolls 11,12 from penetrating into said room.<br>
In the combing machines known thus far the effect was exactly inverse: as the combing noil suction chute 14, 15,16,17 is connected at least at its upper end with the surrounding room and as a below atmospheric pressure prevails in the<br><br>
chute for pneumatically carrying off the comber noils and impurities, in the known combing machines also in the room surrounding the suction chute a below atmospheric pressure resulted and thus air flows with fibre fly waste from the surrounding room can enter the room.<br>
On the suction side of the fan 24 preferentially a device 26 is arranged which conditions the air sucked in, i.e. which controls the humidity of the air, or air-conditions, i.e. controls the humidity and the temperature of the air, and cleans the air. The device 26 can be laid out a an air conditioner. If the air blown from the room surrounding the comber noil suction duct upward towards the lap layer moving towards the feed roll 2 and towards the web between the detaching aggregate 8, 9 and the detaching rolls 11,12 is conditioned or air-conditioned, the requirements concerning the air-conditioning normally provided in the zone of the combing machine can be chosen less stringent.<br>
The device 26 of course can be arranged also on the pressure side of the fan 24, in the duct 23, instead of on the suction side of the fan.<br>
The air sucked in by the fan 24 can be supplied via an inlet duct 27 from the surrounding room.<br>
The fan 24 at the same time can function also as the fan creating the sub-atmospheric pressure for sucking comber noils and impurities from the chute 14, 15, 16,17, i.e. the suction side of the fan 24 can be connected, if so desired, via the device 26 and via a duct 28 and a conventionally used comber noil separator device 29 with the suction duct 18.<br>
In the following Figures, e.g. in the Fig. 3, a further design example of the present invention is shown. In the Fig. 3 a feed table 35 is shown with consecutively arranged drafting units 36 and 37. Fibre slivers F arranged side by side are fed in via a feed device which is not shown specifically. The drafting units consist of driven bottom rolls W1 - W4 to which a pressure roll D1 - D4 each is co-ordinated. The two drafting units being identical the same reference signs were used.<br><br>
The fibre slivers after being drafted in the drafting unit 36 are conveyed as a fibre web V1 via the pair of rolls 40, 41 onto the guide plate 44 of the feed table 35. In this arrangement the bottom roll 41 is driven. The fibre slivers F supplied to the subsequent drafting unit 37 after being drafted are also deposited as a fibre web V2 onto the guide plate 44, or onto the fibre web V1 supplied by the first drafting unit 36 and doubled with the later, respectively. The doubled fibre web V is transferred to a subsequently arranged lap forming device in which a lap is formed. A complete description of the machine shown herein can be found e.g. in EP-A1 679 741. The fibre web V2 is transferred via the pairs of rolls 42 and 43 onto the guide plate 44, or onto the fibre web V1 respectively. In this arrangement the roll 43 is driven .<br>
In the view according to the Fig. 3 only the bottom rolls W1 - W4 and the rolls 41 and 43 are shown only, which are driven via the drive means to be described in the following. From the Fig. 3 in combination with the Fig. 4 it can be seen that the drafting units (W1 - W4 and D1 - D2) as well as the pair of take-off rolls 40, 41 and 42, 43) are located essentially in closed rooms 48, and 49 respectively, which are surrounded by walls 50, 51, 52 and 53. The cover wall 55 in the feed zone of the fibre slivers F as well as the cover wall 56 in the delivery zone of the respective fibre webs V1 and V2 are provided with corresponding openings through which the textile material can enter, or leave respectively.<br>
In the Figures 3 and 4 it is shown schematically that via the ducts 60, 61 and 62 and via a suction fan 64 air is sucked in from the rooms 48 and 49, a sub-atmospheric pressure being built up. From the Fig. 4 it can be seen that the ducts 60 and 61 merge into the zone of a suction slot 66 arranged above the pressure rolls. This arrangement is to permit specifically the elimination of fibre fly waste and dust which is settling in the rooms 48 and 49.<br>
In particular for maintenance work and for remedying disturbances the cover of the drafting units is designed in two parts the upper hood of which is pivotable upward using a hinge indicated in the Fig. 5. This signifies that the side walls 50, 51 and the walls 56 also are laid out in two parts each. At the separation lines of<br><br>
these walls rubber gaskets (not shown) can be provided which are sealing the two wall part while the hood is closed.<br>
Beneath the drafting units 36 and 37 a fan wheel 75 is provided at a face side of the feed table 35, which via a filter sieve 76 blows air from the room surrounding the machine into the room 78 surrounded by walls. The room 78 is surrounded by the walls 79 and 80 as well as by the bottom wall 81 and the guide plate 44. The rooms 90, 91 and 92, also surrounded by walls, in which drive means to be described later as well as gear trains 70 and 71 and bearings are located, are connected with the room 78 in which an above atmospheric pressure prevails.<br>
The rolls W1 - W4 are driven via the gear trains 70, and 71 respectively, via the drive shafts A1 - A4, which extend through the openings 58 in the wall 51 into the room 48, and 49 respectively. The drive shafts A1 - A4 can be designed as cardan shafts (not shown) permitting adaptation of the distances between the rolls W1 - W4.<br>
The opening 58 through which the drive shafts A1 - A4 extend is shown enlarged and in more detail in the Fig. 5. The opening 58 is located in the stationary part 51' of the wall 51 and its dimensions are chosen such that the distances between the rolls W1 - W4 can be adjusted. In the upper and in the lower edge zone of the opening 58 a row of bristles B1 and B2 each is attached the bristles of which extend into the zone of the opening 58 overlapping partially in the centre zone. The bristles of the rows of bristles B1 and B2 being yielding, they can hug the drive shafts A1 - A4 and leave the passage unobstructed for the shafts to extend through the opening. This arrangement effects that the rooms 90, and 91 respectively, in which the drive elements are located and in which an above atmospheric pressure prevails, are partially sealed against the rooms 48, and 49 respectively, in which a below atmospheric pressure prevails, the adjustability of the distances between the rolls W1 - W4 being ensured. Similar sealing can be provided also for the shafts 41, 43 respectively, in the zone through which the drive shafts A5 extend. The rolls W1 - W4 are supported in bearings L shown schematically at the opposite ends of the drive shafts A1 - A4. The gear trains 70, 71 each<br><br>
are driven via a schematically indicated belt drive 68 and via a cross-shaft 72, and 72 respectively, each. By this cross-shaft 72, and 73 respectively, also the drive shaft A5 of the rolls 41 and 43 are driven via a schematically shown drive belt arrangement. The drive belt arrangement 68 which is driven by a drive motor not shown specifically also is located in the room 92 in which an above atmospheric pressure prevails. Of course also further drive elements of the lap-forming aggregate which is not shown in more detail can be housed in rooms in which also an above atmospheric pressure prevails.<br>
The covers and walls of course can not seal the rooms absolutely tightly against the room surrounding the machine. At several locations small gaps and openings still are present via which mainly from the rooms in which above atmospheric pressure prevails air can escape. This presents a positive aspect, however, in that accumulations of fibres and impurities on the machine can also be prevented owing to the escaping air. As already described with reference to the combing machine (Fig. 1) a device can be co-ordinated also to the fan 75 which conditions, or air-conditions respectively, the air sucked in.<br>
Owing to the arrangement described the rooms in which the processing proper of the fibre material is effected can be maintained free of the fibre fly waste and dust generated, whereas in the other rooms in which essentially the drive elements and/or bearing arrangements are located can be maintained free of dust and fibre fly waste. In this manner the maintenance intervals for the machine can be extended over longer time periods. Furthermore the machine aquires a certain self-cleaning effect.<br>
The application of the present invention is not restricted to the machine types shown but is applicable to all branches of textile machine construction wherever processing of textile material on one hand is effected and working elements as well as bearing arrangements on the other hand are provided.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Summary<br>
The present invention concerns a machine processing textile material with working elements (W1 - W4, D1 - D4,6) for processing textile material (F, 3) which via feeding means (1, 2; 4, 5) is supplied to the working elements and with drive elements (A1 - A4, 70, 71, 68, 72, 73) for the working elements as well as bearings of the drive elements, and of the working elements respectively, in which arrangement the working elements and the drive elements with the respective bearings co-ordinated to them at least partially are located in respective rooms (48, 49, 78, 90, 91, 92) during the processing which are separated and limited by walls (50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56; 79, 80, 81, 44) and in which parts of the working elements via openings (58) in the walls (5V) extend into the room (90, 91) of the drive elements (70, 71, A1 - A4), and in which means (64) are provided for applying a below atmospheric pressure to the room (48, 49) of the working elements. In machines of this type the danger persists that due to the below atmospheric pressure applied in the zone of the working elements a below atmospheric pressure is generated partially too in the zone of the drive elements. This causes free-floating fibres (fibre fly waste) to be sucked in from the room surrounding the machine into these zones resulting in contamination of these zones after a short period of time. Therefore provision of further means (75, 76) is proposed for supplying air to said room (90, 91, 92) of the drive elements (A1 - A4, 70,71,68) and of their respective bearing arrangements at a pressure which is higher than the one in the room surrounding the machine.<br>
