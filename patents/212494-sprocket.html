DESCRIPTION SPROCKET<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a sprocket associated with a chain in a power transmission system to transmit power.<br>
Background Art<br>
A combination of a chain and sprocket as a power transmission system is widely employed in a motorcycle, bicycle or other various industrial machines. The shape and size of the chain and sprocket are defined in JISB1801 and JISB1802 of the Japan Industrial Standards.<br>
To reduce the amount of material or the production cost, or to reduce the weight of a motorcycle and improve responsivity during acceleration, a predetermined pattern of weight reduction holes are formed in the sprocket. A sprocket which is mounted on a rear wheel of a motorcycle is, in many cases, exposed to ambient atmosphere. Such holes have an effect on the aesthetics of the motorcycle. To this end, there have been proposed holes of various shapes and sizes.<br>
As mentioned above, such holes are effective for reducing the weight of the sprocket to some extent. The holes can not, however, be formed at the outer periphery of the sprocket since it is necessary to maintain the strength and rigidity of the teeth. Thus, a further<br><br>
reduction in the weight of the sprocket is not possible. It should be noted that to improve responsivity during acceleration, it is preferable to reduce the weight of the outer periphery of the sprocket. However, the weight of the outer periphery of the sprocket can not be reduced by the holes as mentioned above.<br>
A chain is typically composed of two pin link plates and roller link plates extending parallel to each other and arranged in an alternate fashion, and mechanically connected by pins. This arrangement inevitably places limits on tensile strength- As such, the use of a narrower chain creates a problem as to strength.  In contrast, the sprocket has no mechanical connection. Various materials have been recently proposed to increase the strength and rigidity of a sprocket* A sprocket made of such materials enjoys the same strength and rigidity if the thickness is reduced by one-half that of a conventional sprocket.<br>
There may be employed a combination of a thin and lightweight sprocket and a conventional chain with a sufficient degree of strength. Such a combination may, however, create rattling in the thickness direction of the sprocket.  Such vibration or rattling, if occurs, results in improper engagement of the sprocket with the chain, produces noise, and causes irregular wear of the sprocket and the chain and twisting of the sprocket and chain due to application of uneven loads.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present<br><br>
invention to provide a sprocket which is thin, but enables smooth engagement of the sprocket with an associated chain, and which provides a sufficient degree of torsional strength and has an aesthetic appearance-<br>

According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sprocket comprising a wavy region formed at least at its outer periphery, and a plurality of teeth. The wavy region extends in an undulating fashion along the circumference of the sprocket and includes a plurality of convex joint portions. The teeth are formed at least at the outer end of the wavy region.<br>

The teeth are formed at the outer periphery of the wavy region.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sprocket comprising thick and thin portions formed at its outer periphery and<br><br>
arranged alternately along the circumference of the sprocket, and a plurality of teeth formed at the outer end of the wavy region*<br>
In its preferred form, there is provided a means for reducing noise arising from contact between the sprocket and an associated chain.<br>
In its preferred form, the means for reducing noise is mounted to roots formed between adjacent teeth.<br>
In its preferred form, the means for reducing noise comprises a cushion element.<br>
In its preferred form, the means for reducing noise comprises an annular resilient element and extends along the teeth so as to position part of the resilient element in the roots.<br>

In its preferred form, the means for reducing noise comprises cushion elements, and the sprocket includes<br><br>
through holes adjacent to the roots. The cushion elements extend through the through holes and are interconnected so that the cushion elements are disposed along the roots.<br>
The sprocket according to the present invention comprises a wavy region formed at least at its outer periphery, and a plurality of teeth. The wavy region extends in an undulating fashion along the circumference of the sprocket and includes a plurality of convex joint portions. The teeth are formed at least at the outer end of the convex joint portions* The teeth of the sprocket are engaged with opposite sides of chain rollers so as to constantly provide an appropriate amount of axial play between the sprocket and a chain. The wavy region enables a reduction in the thickness of the sprocket. The teeth of such a thin sprocket has in appearance a nominal thickness identical to those of a typical sprocket and can thus be maintained in proper engagement with an associated chain. Also, the wavy region provides a higher degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket. Advantageously, the wavy region promotes the flow of air during rotation of the sprocket so as to prevent an increase in the temperature of the sprocket - As the sprocket is rotated, the resulting centrifugal force causes mud and other foreign substances, which may be attached to the outer surface of the sprocket during use, to be moved to a part where the sprocket is engaged with the chain. The wavy region, formed at least at the outer periphery of the sprocket, is effective for allowing such<br><br>
mud to flow along the grooves of the wavy region and then, out of the sprocket. Thus, the sprocket is substantially free from mud and other foreign substances.<br>
In the sprocket, one pitch between adjacent convex joint portions may be different from the other pitches between the other convex joint portions. With this arrangement, an odd number of teeth can be formed by providing an odd number of convex joint portions.<br>
The sprocket according to the present invention comprises an annular wavy region formed at least at its outer periphery, and a plurality of teeth. The wavy region extends in an undulating fashion in a direction radially of the sprocket. The teeth are formed at the outer periphery of the wavy region. This arrangement provides an appropriate amount of axial play between the sprocket and the chain. The wavy region which is formed at least at the outer periphery of the sprocket enables a reduction in the thickness of the sprocket. The distance between adjacent convex joint portions of such a thin sprocket is, however, identical to the thickness of teeth of a typical sprocket. Thus, the sprocket is maintained in proper engagement with the chain. The wavy region also provides a higher degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket. Advantageously, the wavy region promotes the flow of air during rotation of the sprocket so as to prevent an increase in the temperature of the sprocket. As the sprocket is rotated, the resulting centrifugal force causes mud and other foreign<br><br>
substances, which may be attached to the outer surface .of the sprocket during use, to be moved to a part where the sprocket is engaged with an associated chain. The wavy region, formed at least at the outer periphery of the sprocket, is effective to allow such mud to flow along the grooves of the wavy region and then, out of the sprocket. Thus, the sprocket is substantially free from mud and other foreign substances.<br>
The sprocket according to the present invention comprises thick and thin portions formed at its outer periphery and arranged alternately along the circumference of the sprocket, and a plurality of teeth formed at the outer end of the thick portions. This arrangement provides an appropriate amount of axial play between the sprocket and an associated chain. The thick portions are capable of maintaining proper engagement of the sprocket with the chain while the thin portions enable a reduction in the weight of the sprocket. The alternate arrangement of the thin and thick portions provides a sufficient degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket. Mud and other foreign substances are caused to flow along the grooves of the wavy region and out of the sprocket. Thus, the sprocket is substantially free from mud.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the drawings.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 4, a sprocket 1 is made by pressing a disc-shaped member by means of a press machine. Various portions of the sprocket are substantially identical in thickness. Further, the sprocket may be made by a forging technique.<br>
The sprocket 1 includes a wavy region 2. The wavy region 2 extends from the outer periphery toward the center of the sprocket 1 by approximately one-third of the radius of the sprocket 1 and is arranged, with a fixed pitch, in an undulating fashion along the circumference of the sprocket 1, The wavy region 2 has opposite convex joint portions 3 and slant portions 4 between adjacent<br><br>
convex Joint portions 3, The wavy region 2 includes a plurality of teeth 5, The teeth 5 include crests 3a located at the outer end of the convex joint portions 3 and roots 4a located at the outer end of the slant portions 4. The top of each of the teeth 5 is beveled to provide a chamfer 5a. The sprocket 1 has a thickness Tl which is in the range between 1/5 and 4/5 of the axial distance T2 between the tops of adjacent teeth 5. If the T2 is equal to or greater than 4/5 of the distance T2, the sprocket 1 can not be sufficiently reduced in weight.  If, on the other hand, the thickness Tl is equal to or less than 1/5 of the distance T2, the sprocket 1 can not be given a sufficient degree of strength*  If the strength of the sprocket 1 needs not be considered, the thickness Tl may be in the range between 1/10 and 4/5.  Illustratively, the thickness Tl is approximately 1/2 of the distance T2. The sprocket 1 would be substantially identical in cross-section to a conventional sprocket if two of the sprockets 1 were displaced in a circumferential direction and superimposed together.<br>
The sprocket 1 has a central opening 6• The sprocket 1 includes an annular body 7 between the wavy region 2 and the central opening 6, Four holes 8 are formed in the annular body 7 in a circumferentially equally spaced relationship. The shaft of a rear wheel, for example, of a motorcycle is inserted through the central opening 6 of the sprocket 1. Four bolts are inserted through the correspondinq holes 8 so as to secure<br><br>
the annular body 7 to the flange of that shaft. Any number of holes 8, for example, 3, 5, 6 or 8 holes, may be formed in the annular body 7 of the sprocket 1,<br>
The axial center of the wavy region 2 is located in the same plane as the axial center of the annular body 7, Alternatively, one side of the annular body 7 may be located in the same plane as one of the opposite convex joint portions of the wavy region 2.<br>
Reference will next be made to the operation and advantages of the sprocket 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a chain 10 extends around the sprocket 1 so that the teeth 5 are alternately engaged with opposite sides of each roller 11. A clearance is left between the teeth 5 and roller link plates 12 and pin link plates 13 so as to insure proper engagement of the sprocket 1 with the chain 10,<br>
The sprocket 1 has a thickness approximately half of that of a typical sprocket known in the art, but enables proper engagement of the sprocket with the conventional chain. It requires only half the amount of material to make a conventional sprocket and eliminates the need for openings to reduce the weight of the sprocket. The sprocket 1 has a wavy periphery. This contour provides a higher degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket 1. The wavy region 2 has a plurality of grooves 2a along which mud and the like, as attached to the sprocket, is discharged. The grooves 2a prevent damage to the sprocket 1 and the chain 10 which<br><br>
may occur when mud and the like exist between the sprocket 1 and the chain 10.<br>
Reference will now be made to other embodiments of the sprocket 1, Like parts are given like reference numerals and will not be described herein.<br>
(1)	Referring to Fig. 6, a sprocket lA includes a wavy region 2A which extends between the outer periphery of the sprocket lA and the opening 6. Referring to Fig. 1,   a sprocket IB includes a wavy region 2B which is formed only at the outer periphery of the sprocket IB.<br>
(2)	The sprocket IB may have four and eight openings to reduce its weight as shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.<br>
The sprocket IB may alternatively have four oblong openings 21 as shown in Fig. 10, Still alternatively, the sprocket IB may have four openings connected to the central opening 6 as shown in Fig. 11, The openings may take various other forms to reduce the weight of the sprocket IB. Although not shown in the drawings, the sprocket 1 may also have various openings formed only in the wavy region 2 or both in the wavy region 2 and the annular body 7 to reduce its weight unless they causes a reduction in the strength of the teeth 5. Similarly, the sprocket lA may have circular, oblong or other openings formed in the wavy region 2A.<br>
(3)	The convex joint portions 3 of the wavy region 2<br>
extend radially of the sprocket 1, but the invention is<br>
not limited thereto. Referring to Fig. 12, a sprocket IC<br>
includes a wavy region 2C wherein a plurality of convex<br><br>
joint portions 3C extend in a direction transverse to the radial direction of the sprocket IC. Similarly, the sprockets lA and IB may have inclined convex joint portions. The convex joint portions 3 of the wavy region 2B extend radially of the sprocket IB. As shown in Fig. 13, a sprocket ID includes a wavy region 2D wherein a plurality of convex joint portions 3D extend in a curved fashion.  Similarly, the convex joint portions 3 of the sprockets 1 and lA may extend in a curved fashion.<br>
(4)	In the sprockets 1 and lA to ID, the convex joint portions 3 are flat. Referring to Fig. 14, convex joint portions 3E may be bent. As shown in Fig. 15, the convex joint and adjacent portions are flat so that the teeth 5 are in the form of a flat plate. Also, the wavy regions 2 and 2A to 2D may have a longer pitch so that the teeth 5 may be formed at the outer end of the slant portions 4. Referring to Fig. 15, a set of adjacent teeth 5 are connected to form a top portion 3F,<br>
(5)	In the sprockets 1 and lA to ID, the wavy regions have a fixed pitch to provide an even number of teeth.  In the wavy region 2 of a sprocket IG shown in Figs. 16 to 18, at least one pitch between adjacent convex joint portions<br>
3 is two times greater than the other pitches PI. In other words, the number of the convex joint portions in the sprocket IG is less than that of the other sprockets by one.  In the sprocket IG, a tooth 5G is formed at the outer edge of a slant portion 4G between the convex joint portions 3, Where an even number of the slant portions 4G<br><br>
are provided, the sprocket IG has an even number of tee^th. Where an odd number of the slant portions 4G are provided, the sprocket IG has an odd number of teeth.  It should be noted that where the sprocket IG is provided with a plurality of slant portions 4G, the slant portions 4G are preferably arranged in a circumferentially fixed relationship. Similarly, the sprockets lA to ID may be provided with an odd number of teeth by eliminating at least one convex joint portion, forming one tooth at the outer edge of the slant portion and then, providing an odd number of slant portions.<br>
(6)	Referring to Figs. 19 and 20, a sprocket 31 includes an annular wavy region 32 formed at least at its outer periphery. The wavy region 32 radially extends in an undulating fashion with a fixed pitch. The wavy region 32 has a plurality of teeth 35 at its outer periphery. As shown in Fig. 21, opposed roller link plates 12 extend between two adjacent convex joint portions 33 to insure proper engagement of the sprocket 31 with the chain 10. The wavy region 32 is located at the outer periphery of the sprocket, but may extend over any other part of the sprocket 31.<br>
(7)	Referring to Figs. 22 and 23, a sprocket 41 includes thick portions 42 and thin portions 43. The thick portions 42 and the thin portions 43 are formed at least at its outer periphery and alternately arranged along the circumference of the sprocket 41. A plurality of teeth 45 are formed at the outer end of the thick<br><br>
portions 42. Referring to Fig. 24, each of the teeth 45 is engaged with the roller 11 along the entire length of the roller 11, as is conventional, to insure engagement of the sprocket 41 and the chain 10. As shown in Fig. 25, the sprocket 41 may have thin wavy portions 43A, Also, the thick portions 42 may extend radially in an inclined or curved fashion as in the sprockets IC and ID.<br>
The sprockets may be provided with means for reducing noise which may occur due to contact between the sprockets and the chain. Referring specifically to Fig. 26, a flexible and resilient or elastic annular cushion element 50 may extend around the sprocket 1 shown in Fig. 1. The cushion element 50 is forced to extend alternately between the teeth adjacent to the roots 4a. The cushion element 50 is secured to the sprocket by an adhesive. With the cushion element 50 provided adjacent to the roots 4a, the rollers 11 of the chain 10 are contacted with the cushion element 50 during engagement of the sprocket with the chain 10 to eliminate the occurrence of noise.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig- 26, the cushion element 50 is the form of a ring. Referring to Fig. 27, a cushion element 51 may have recesses 52 to receive the teeth 5. This arrangement retards deformation of the cushion element 51 when disposed around the sprocket. In this case, the cushion element 51 can be made of not only rubber, but also non-flexible resin. The recesses 52 may have a shape complementary to that of the teeth 52 so as to eliminate any clearance between the teeth 5 and the<br><br>
cushion element. Also, the cushion element may have a shape complementary to that of the wavy region of the sprocket so as to eliminate any clearance between the teeth and the cushion element.<br>
In the embodiments shown in Figs. 26 and 27, the cushion elements are in the form of rings. Alternatively, a plurality of cushion elements 54 may separately be mounted to the roots 4a, In Fig. 28, the cushion elements 54 extend over the roots 4a, Alternatively, a plurality of cushion elements 55 may be located in a part of the roots 4a as shown in Fig, 29.<br>
Referring to Fig. 30, a sprocket has a plurality of through holes 60 adjacent to the roots. A plurality of cushion elements 56 extend through the holes 60 and are interconnected together so that the cushion elements 56 are disposed adjacent to the roots.<br>
Referring to Fig. 31, a cushion element 57 is disposed in one side of the roots 4a rather than directly in the roots 4a.  In this case, the cushion elements 57 are partly forced into the through holes 60 for securement to the sprocket. The cushion elements 57 may alternatively be attached to the sprocket by an adhesive.<br>
Referring to Fig. 32, a plurality of cushion elements 58 are attached to opposite sides of the roots 4a.<br>
Like the embodiment shown in Fig. 30, these cushion elements 58 extend through the through holes 60 and are interconnected together for securement to the sprocket. Discrete cushion elements may be attached to the sprocket<br><br>
by an adhesive.<br>
Preferably, the cushion elements extend around the roots. The cushion elements may alternatively extend from the roots to the inner ends of the grooves 2a.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The sprocket according to the present invention comprises a wavy region formed at least at its outer periphery, and a plurality of teeth formed at least at the outer end of convex joint portions of the wavy region. The sprocket is simple in structure and is easily made by a press machine or a forging technique. The sprocket thus made is maintained in proper engagement with an associated chain. Advantageously, the thickness of the sprocket can be reduced according to the strength of a chain so as to reduce the weight of the sprocket. Also, the wavy region which is formed at least the outer periphery of the sprocket provides a sufficient degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket. Advantageously, the wavy region promotes the flow of air so as to effectively cool down the sprocket and prevent thermal deformation of the sprocket. Mud and other foreign substances, which may be attached to the sprocket, is caused to smoothly flow out of the sprocket without remaining between the sprocket and the chain, thereby preventing damage to the sprocket and the chain. The sprocket can have an odd number of teeth.<br>
The sprocket according to the present invention<br><br>
comprises a wavy region formed at least at its outer periphery, and a plurality of teeth formed at the outer periphery of the wavy region. The sprocket is simple in structure and is easily made by a press machine or a forging technique. The sprocket thus made is maintained in proper engagement with an associated chain* Advantageously, the thickness of the sprocket can be reduced according to the strength of a chain so as to reduce the weight of the sprocket. Also, the wavy region which is formed at least the outer periphery of the sprocket provides a sufficient degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket. Mud and other foreign substances, which may be attached to the sprocket, is caused to smoothly flow out of the sprocket, thereby preventing damage to the sprocket and the chain.<br>
The sprocket according to the present invention comprises thick and thin portions formed at its outer periphery and arranged alternately along the circumference of the sprocket, and a plurality of teeth formed at the outer end of the thick portions. The sprocket is simple in structure and is easily made by a press machine or a forging technique. The sprocket thus made is maintained in proper engagement with a chain while the weight of the sprocket can readily be reduced. The alternate arrangement of the thin and thick portions provides a sufficient degree of torsional strength and rigidity to the entire sprocket. Mud and other foreign substances which may be attached to the sprocket are caused to<br><br>
smoothly flow out of the sprocket, thereby preventing .. damage to the sprocket as well as the chain*<br>
In its preferred form, there is provided a means for reducing noise arising from contact between the sprocket and an associated chain. The means for reducing noise is mounted to roots formed between adjacent teeth. The means for reducing noise comprises a cushion element. The cushion element can be made of not only rubber, but also elastic resin or elastic plastic. The cushion element may damp and eliminate the occurrence of noise during engagement of the sprocket with the cain.<br><br><br><br>
