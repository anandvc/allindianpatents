				<td>POLYURETHANE-UREA ELASTOMERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to polyurethane-urea elastomers which are preferably optically clear, and to a process for their production.<br>
Various light stable cast elastomers and processes for the production of these elastomers are known and described in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,755,262, 3,866,242, 4,153,777, 4,404,353 and 4,808,690, and German Offenlegungsschrift 2,109,901.<br>
Transparent high-impact polyurethane products are disclosed by U.S. Patent 3,755,262. These products may be elastomeric or non-elastomeric in nature. Suitable liquid polyurethane reaction mixtures for preparing these optical polyurethanes are made by the one-shot or prepolymer method. Preferred mixtures comprise a non-aromatic polyisocyanate and a reactive hydrogen containing polyol having an average of more than two hydroxyl groups per molecule and molecular weights of up to about 800.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,866,242 discloses protective shields consisting of a polyurethane, shaped in the contour of a clipboard, windshield, face shield, etc. These polyurethanes are described as being transparent and having excellent optical clarity. Suitable polyurethanes are prepared by reacting a polyester glycol or a polyether glycol with methylenebis(cyclo-hexylisocyanate) to form a prepolymer, and reacting this prepolymer with a primary amine group containing compound, preferably one having a methylene bridge between two aromatic rings such as methylenebis(2-chloroaniline).<br>
U.S. Patent 4,153,777 describes polyurethanes having improved physical properties. This reference specifically discloses non-porous polyurethanes which exhibit good optical clarity and resistance to weathering, ultra-violet and thermal exposure. These polyurethanes<br>
comprise an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer which is formed by first eacting the isocyanate with water, and then with a polyol to form the Drepolymer. This prepolymer is then chain extended or crosslinked with a Dolyol to form the cured polyurethane. Suitable isocyanates include cyclo)aliphatic isocyanates and suitable chain extenders and crosslinkers nclude compounds such as 1,4-butanediol and trimethylolpropane.<br>
High heat distortion temperature transparent polyurethanes which are highly crosslinked are described by U.S. Patent 4,808,690. These comprise a prepolymer prepared from a polyisocyanate and at least one multifunctional hydroxy containing intermediate, with a polyol curing component. Suitable multifunctional hydroxyl containing intermediates include polyhydric alcohols, polyester polyols and blends thereof. Suitable polyisocyanates include (cyclo)aliphatic polyisocyanates, and the polyol curing component can be a polyester or a polyhydric alcohol.<br>
Other light stable elastomers are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patents 5,510,445, 5,646,230, 5,714,562 and 6,174,984. These elastomers may be polyurethanes as in U.S. 5,714,562 and 6,174,984; polyurethane/ureas in as U.S. 5,646,230 or polyureas as in U.S. 5,510,445.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,174,984 discloses clear resilient polyurethane elastomers. These elastomers comprise the reaction product of A) a prepolymer of at least one diisocyanate and at least one polyether polyol, laving a free diisocyanate content of less than 1% of the prepolymer, B) at least one alkylated aromatic diamine in a quantity sufficient to react with about 50 to 105% of the available isocyanate content in the prepolymer, and C) at least one organic acid catalyst in a quantity sufficient to reduce the pot life to no more than two minutes. These elastomers possess high resilience and clarity.<br>
Polyurea elastomers prepared by a one-step process are described in U.S. Patent 5,510,445. The process comprises reacting (a) one or more (cyclo)aliphatic diisocyanates, (b) one or more liquid amine-terminated polymers containing at least two aromatically bound isocyanate-reactive primary or secondary amine groups and/or aliphatically bound isocyanate-reactive secondary amino groups and having a molecular weight of from 400 to 6,000, and (c) one or more aromatic diamine chain extenders having a molecular weight of from 108 to 399, optionally in admixture with one or more crosslinkers. Suitable diisocyanates include 4,4'-dicyclo-hexylmethane diisocyanate (rMDI) and prepolymers thereof. DETDA is disclosed as a suitable aromatic diamine chain extender.<br>
U.S. Patents 5,811,506 and 6,258,917 describe extrudable thermoplastic urea-extended polyurethanes. The polyurethanes in U.S. 5,811,506 comprise the reaction product of (a) a polyurethane prepolynrier, (b) at least one first diamine curing agent, and (c) at least one second diamine curing agent that is different from the first diamine curing agent. Polyurethanes of U.S. 6,258,917 comprise the reaction product of (a) a polyurethane prepolymer, and (b) at least one diamine curing agent selected from the group consisting of 2,4-diamino-3,5-diethyltoluene, 2,6-diamino-3,5-diethyltoluene, 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-6-diisqpropylaniline), trimethylene glycol di-para aminobenzoate and mixtures thereof. These polyurethanes have a Shore A hardness of 72 to 84, a DMA Tg of -80°C or less and a TMA softening point of 205 to 208°C.<br>
Polyurethane materials are also disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,962,617 and 6,127,505. In U.S. 5,962,617, these comprise the reaction product of (a) a polyurethane prepolymer prepared by reacting methylene-bis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) with an OH-containing intermediate having a MWW of 500 to 2000, in an equivalent ratio of 2.5 to 4.0 NCO/1.0 OH, and (b) an aromatic diamine curing agent which has two aromatic ring groups attached by a methylene group, in which each aromatic ring is substituted by one NH2 group, and 3 of the remaining 4 positions on the aromatic ring<br>
are substituted, with the equivalent ratio of NH2:NCO ranging from 0.95:1.0 to 1.02:1.0.<br>
U.S. 6,127,505 discloses that these polyurethane materials comprise the reaction product of (a) a polyurethane prepolymer and (b) at least a first aromatic diamine curing agent. Suitable prepolymers are prepared by reacting an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diisocyanate with an OH containing intermediate having a MWW of 400 to 2,000, in which the equivalent ratio is about 2.5 to 4.0 NCO/1.0 OH. The diamine curing agent is selected from 2,4-diamino-3,5-diethyl toluene, 2,6-diamino-3,5-diethyl toluene and mixtures thereof, in an equivalent ratio of 0.85 to 1.02 NH2: 1.0 NCO.<br>
Light stable one-shot urethane-urea elastomers and a process for their production are described in U.S. Patent 6,562,932. This process comprises reacting a polyisocyanate or prepolymer thereof with an isocyanate-reactive component, in the presence of C) at least one organometallic catalyst. Suitable isocyanate-reactive components comprise (1) at least one aromatic diamine compound and (2) at least one organic compound having at least two hydroxyl groups and having a molecular weight of 62 to 6,000.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,939,939 discloses a polyurea/urethane material and a process for making this material. These polyurea/urethane materials are described as having good optical quality and high impact resistance. These comprise the reaction product of A) a urethane prepolymer prepared by reacting a first diisocyanate with a first polyol in amounts such that the prepolymer has an equivalent ratio of at least about 3 isocyanate groups per hydroxyl group; with B) a curing agent comprising (1) a hydroxyl-terminated extended chain polymer prepared by reacting a second diisocyanate with a second polyol in an amount such that the resultant polymer has an equivalent ratio of between about 3 and about 8 hydroxyl groups per isocyanate group; and (2) a diamine; in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
There are processing advantages in both U.S. 6,562,932 and U.S. 6,939,939 due to the isocyanate prepolymers containing a high ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups. In spite of these advantages, the need for additional improvements exists, particularly with regard to further processing improvements and cure rates.<br>
It is known to use polyaspartic acid esters in coating compositions. These coatings are based on polyurethanes and/or polyureas which comprise the reaction product of a polyisocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component corresponding to the specified formula which represents polyaspartic acid esters. For example, see U.S. Patents 5,126,170, 5, 236,741, 5,243,012, 5,489,704, 5,580,945 and 5,736,604. U.S. Patent 5,489,704 describes aldimine/aspartates which correspond to a specific formula and the preparation of coating compositions from the reaction of these aldimine/aspartates with polyisocyanates. Polyaspartic acid esters have not, however, been used in optically clear polyurethane/ureas.<br>
Advantages of the presently claimed process include additional improvements in processing. Frequently, a significantly faster rate of production of parts is also seen. The improved processing in the present invention results in parts having decreased distortions, striations, flow lines and the absence of haze. Thus, the present invention results in blemish-free parts which may be removed from the mold in as few as 2-3 hours (referred to as green-cure time), and are subsequently post-cured offline. The presently required combination of an aromatic primary diamine compound and an isocyanate-reactive compound containing 2 secondary amine groups results in improved parts and improved processing over other known systems and processes.<br>

More specifically, these compositions are preferably optically clear, and vary in properties from elastomers having a Shore A hardness in the range of 60 to 95 Shore A to hard solid polyurethane-ureas having a Shore D hardness in the range of 50 to 85.

Examples of di- and poly-hydric alcohols are: ethanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,10-decanediol, 1,12-dodecanediol, glycerol and trimethylolpropane. A preferred group of polyester polyols to be used in the preparation of isocyanate prepolymers for the present invention include those made from lactones, e. g. e -caprolactone or hydroxycarboxylic acids, e.g. omega-hydroxycaproic acid. As is known to one skilled in the art of polyurethane chemistry, polyester polyols can be prepared by reacting lactone with a glycol (i.e. diol or triol) to form a polyester polyol suitable for making prepolymers in accordance with the present invention. Preferred polyester polyols for the production of optically clear polyurethane ureas according to the invention include those polyesters which do not have a tendency to crystallize.<br>
To prepare the polyester polyols, the organic, e.g. aromatic and preferably aliphatic, polycarboxylic acids and/or derivatives of these and polyhydric alcohols may be polycondensed without a catalyst or preferably in the presence of esterification catalysts, usefully in an atmosphere of inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, argon, etc., in the melt at from 150 to 250QC, preferably from 180 to 220QC, if desired under reduced pressure, as far as the desired acid number, which is advantageously less than 10, preferably less than 2. In a preferred embodiment, the esterification mixture is polycondensed to an acid number of from 80 to 30, preferably from 40 to 30, under atmospheric pressure and then under a pressure of less than 500 mbar, preferably from 50 to 150 mbar. Examples of possible esterification catalysts are catalysts comprising iron, cadmium, cobalt, lead, zinc, antimony, magnesium, titanium or tin, in the form of metals, metal oxides or metal salts. However, the polycondensation may also be carried out in a liquid phase in the presence of diluents and/or carriers, such as benzene, toluene, xylene or chlorobenzene for azeotropic removal of the water of condensation by distillation.<br>
Also, suitable compounds to be used as component (A)(2) include polycarbonate polyols obtained by a ring-opening polymerization of ethylene carbonate using the low molecular weight diols and low molecular weight triols as an initiator; and natural polyols such as castor oil and/or soy oil; polyolefin polyols such as polybutadiene polyol and polyisoprene polyol and hydrated products thereof. These may be used alone or as mixtures of two or more of them.<br>
Other suitable polyols for component (A)(2) include polycarbonate diols, which may be obtained by reacting diphenyl or dimethyl carbonate with low molecular weight diols or triols, e -caprolactone-modified diols or triols of the type mentioned above.<br>

The polyethers suitable for use in accordance with the present invention are known and may be obtained, for example, by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran or epoxides such as, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide or epichlorohydrin in the presence of suitable catalysts, such as, for example, BF3 or KOH, or by chemically adding these epoxides, preferably ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, in admixture or successively to components containing reactive hydrogen atoms such as water, alcohols or amines.

100% by weight of (B).<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, component<br>

In addition, component (B) may comprise a % by weight of (B)(1) ranging between any combination of these upper and lower values, inclusive, a % by weight of (B)(2) ranging between any combination of these upper and lower values, inclusive, and a % by weight of (B)(3) ranging between any combination of these upper and lower values, inclusive.

In accordance with the present invention, the relative quantities of (B)(1), (B)(2) and, when present, (B)(3), may vary from those amounts disclosed hereinabove. The relative quantities of components (B)(1), (B)(2) and, optionally (B)(3), are selected such that the equivalent ratio of NH2: NCO, i.e. equivalents of primary amine from component (B)(1) to equivalents of NCO from component (A), is from at least about 0.6 NH2 :1.0 NCO, more preferably from at least about 0.65 NH2 :1.0 NCO and most preferably from at least about 0.68 NH2:1.0 NCO.

This is commercially available under the tradename Ethacure 100 from Albermarle Corporation. The color stabilized version of Ethacure 100 which is available under the tradename Ethacure 100LC is particularly preferred.<br>
As previously discussed, in accordance with the present invention, the relative quantities of (B)(1) and (A) should be selected such that the equivalent ratio of NH2: NCO (i.e. primary amine to NCO) disclosed above is satisfied. Thus, the relative quantities of (B)(1) and (A) are typically selected such that the NH2:NCO equivalent ratio ranges between any combination of the following upper and lower values, inclusive, e.g. from about 0.6 NH2 :1.0 NCO to about 0.95 NH2:1.0 NCO, preferably from about 0.6 NH2 :1.0 NCO to about 0.9 NH2:1.0 NCO, more preferably from about 0.65 NH2:1.0 NCO to about 0.75 NH2:1.0 NCO and most preferably from about 0.68 NH2:1.0 NCO to about 0.7 NH2:1.0 NCO.<br>

These compounds which contain two secondary amine groups may have a molecular weight of at least about 100, preferably at least about 200, and most preferably at least about 300. The compounds containing two secondary amine groups also typically have a molecular weight of less<br>

It is most preferred that secondary amine compounds which are used as component (B)(2) herein contain ester functionality and, more particularly that these are free of ether functionality.<br>
In the broadest sense, suitable compounds to be used as component (B)(2) herein may correspond to the general structure (I):<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>

R1, R2 and R3	may be the same or different and<br>
each represents an aliphatic, an aromatic or a cycloaliphatic moiety that is inert to isocyanates. Some examples of suitable compounds which contain two secondary amine groups to be used herein include, for example, N-alkyl-substituted and N,N'-dialkyl-substituted aromatic diamines, which may also be substituted by alkyl groups on their aromatic radical, and comprising 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms in their N-alkyl radical, such as N,N'-dimethyl-, N,N'-diethyl-, N,N'-di-sec.-pentyl-, N,N'-di-sec.-hexyl-, N,N'-di-sec.-decyl-, N,N'-dicyclohexyl-, and N,N'-di-p-tolyl-,(o-, p- or m-) phenylenediamine; N,N'-dimethyl-, N,N,'-diethyl-, N,N'-diisopropyl-, N,N'-di-sec.-butyl-, and N,N'-dicyclohexyl- 4,4'-diamino-diphenylmethane; and N,N'-di-sec.-butylbenzidine.<br>
Other secondary diamines useful in the invention are the N,N'-dialkyl substituted isophorone diamines. Such compounds have recently been commercialized by Huntsman and designated by the tradenames Jefflink® 754 and Jefflink® 755. Suitable diamines also include 4,4'-methylene bis(n-sec butylaniline), designated PolyLink® 4200 and PolyClear® 136, an aliphatic secondary diamine, both from The Hanson Group.<br>
A particularly preferred group of secondary diamine compounds includes the polyaspartic esters. Suitable polyaspartic esters include those corresponding to the general formula (II):<br>

wherein:<br>
X:	represents an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic moiety<br>
that is inert towards isocyanate groups and is divalent and R4 and R5:    may be identical or different, and each<br>
independently represents an organic group which is inert towards isocyanate groups. In the above structure, X may represent an alkyl moiety containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, and that the alkyl radical may be straight chain or branched; or a cycloalkyl radical<br>

These polyaspartic esters can be prepared in a known manner as described in, for example, U.S. Patents 5,126,170 and 5,236,741, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. More specifically, these compounds are prepared by reacting the corresponding primary polyamines which correspond to the general formula:<br>

which<br>
X, R4, and R5:	are defined as above;<br>
R6 and R7:	may be identical or different and<br>
each may represent organic groups which are inert towards isocyanate groups or each may represent a hydrogen atom; and<br>
n:	represents an integer with a value<br>

It is also possible to use relatively high molecular weight polyether polyamines that contain aliphatically bound primary amino groups such as, for example, the products commercially available under the Jeffamine tradename.<br>
Some examples of optionally substituted maleic acid esters or fumaric acid esters which can be used to form the polyaspartic esters corresponding to the general formula (II) above, include dimethyl, diethyl, and di-n-butyl esters of maleic acid and fumaric acid and the corresponding maleic or fumaric acid esters substituted by methyl in the 2-and/orthe 3-position.<br>
These polyaspartic esters can be prepared from the above described starting materials, at a temperature of 0°C to 100°C, by using these starting materials in such proportions that at least 1, and preferably 1, olefinic double bond is present for each primary amino group. Excess starting materials may be removed by distillation after the reaction. The reaction may be carried out solvent-free or in the presence of suitable solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The isocyanate reactive component (B) may also optionally comprise (B)(3) one or more hydroxyl-functional compounds selected from the group consisting of polyether polyols, polythioethers, polyesters, polycaprolactones, glycols, polycarbonates, polyacetals, hydroxyl-terminated prepolymers, etc. as well as mixtures of these hydroxyl-functional compounds.

Suitable hydroxyl-functional organic compounds may have a molecular weight ranging between any combination of these upper and lower values, inclusive, e.g. from about 100 to about 6,000, preferably of about 200 to about 4,000, and most preferably about 200 to about 2,000. Polyester polyols are preferred. It is most preferred that the hydroxyl-functional compounds comprise polyester polyols that are the reaction product of e-caprolactone with a glycol.<br>
Examples of glycols and other suitable components for (B)(3) include compounds known to be suitable as low molecular weight chain extenders as well as low molecular weight diols.

It is also possible that mixtures of the above mentioned compounds with small amounts of mono-functional and/or higher-functional compounds can be used as component (B)(3) provided that the above functionality and molecular weight requirements are satisfied.<br>
Suitable polyester polyols may, for example, be prepared from organic dicarboxylic acids having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, and polyhydric alcohols, preferably diols, having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.

These dicarboxylic acids may be used individually or else in a mixture with one another. Instead of the free dicarboxylic acids, it is also possible to use the corresponding dicarboxylic acid derivatives, such as esters of dicarboxylic acids with alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids. Examples of di- and polyhydric alcohols are: ethanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,10-decanediol, 1,12-dodecanediol, glycerol and trimethylolpropane. In accordance with the present invention, it is preferred to use polyester polyols made from lactones, e. g. e -caprolactone or hydroxycarboxylic acids, e.g. omega-hydroxycaproic acid. These and other suitable lactones are typically reacted with a glycol (e.g. a diol such as 1,-4-butane diol or 1,6-hexanediol) to form a polyester polyol. Preferred polyester polyols for the production of optically clear polyurethane ureas according to the present invention include those polyesters which do not have a tendency to crystallize.<br>
To prepare the polyester polyols, the organic, e.g. aromatic and preferably aliphatic, polycarboxylic acids and/or derivatives of these and polyhydric alcohols may be polycondensed without a catalyst or preferably in the presence of esterification catalysts, usefully in an atmosphere of inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, argon, etc., in the melt at from 150 to 250gC, preferably from 180 to 220QC, if desired under reduced pressure, as far as the desired acid number, which is<br>
advantageously less than 10, preferably less than 2. In a preferred embodiment, the esterification mixture is polycondensed to an acid number of from 80 to 30, preferably from 40 to 30, under atmospheric pressure and then under a pressure of less than 500 mbar, preferably from 50 to 150 mbar. Examples of possible esterification catalysts are catalysts using iron, cadmium, cobalt, lead, zinc, antimony, magnesium, titanium or tin, in the form of metals, metal oxides or metal salts. However, the polycondensation may also be carried out in a liquid phase in the presence of diluents and/or carriers, such as benzene, toluene, xylene or chlorobenzene for azeotropic removal of the water of condensation by distillation.<br>
Also suitable compounds to be used as the hydroxyl-functional compounds are polycarbonate polyols. Suitable polycarbonate polyols include those obtained by a ring-opening polymerization of ethylene carbonate using the low molecular weight diols and low molecular weight triols as an initiator; and natural polyols such as castor oil and/or soy oil; polyolefin polyols such as polybutadiene polyol and polyisoprene polyol and hydrated products thereof. These may be used alone or as mixtures of two or more of them.<br>
Other suitable hydroxyl-functional compounds include polycarbonate diols, which may be obtained by reacting diphenyl-or dimethyl-carbonate with low molecular weight diols or triols, e -caprolactone-modified diols or triols of the type mentioned above.<br>
Hydroxyl-terminated prepolymers suitable for use as component (B)(3) of the present invention include, for example, those which are prepared by reacting conventional hydroxyl-group containing compounds such as, for example, diols, polyether diols and polyols, polyester diols and polyols, and/or caprolactone diols and polyols, with a (cyclo)aliphatic diisocyanate or polyisocyanate. Suitable (cyclo)aliphatic diisocyanates and polyisocyanates include those which are described above as being suitable for component (A)(1). The quantities of the hydroxyl-group<br>
containing compound to the isocyanate group containing compound is such that there is an excess of hydroxyl groups to isocyanate groups. Typically, the relative quantities are such that in the final product there are from about 3 to about 8 hydroxyl groups per isocyanate group, and preferably from about 3 to about 5 hydroxyl groups per isocyanate group.<br>
Other suitable polyesters, polythioethers, polyacetals, polycarbonates and other polyhydroxyl compounds which may be used in accordance with the invention may be found, for example, in High Polymers, Volume XVI, "Polyurethanes, Chemistry and Technology," by Saunders-Frisch, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Vol. I, 1962, pages 32-42 and 44-54, and Volume II, 1964, pages 5-6 and 198-199; and in Kunststoff-Handbuch, Vol. VII, Vieweg-Hochtlen, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, 1966, pages 45-71.<br>
The polyethers suitable for use in accordance with the invention are known and may be obtained, for example, by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran or epoxides such as, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide or epichlorohydrin in the presence of suitable catalysts, such as, for example, BF3 or KOH, or by chemically adding these epoxides, preferably ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, in admixture or successively to components containing reactive hydrogen atoms such as water, alcohols or amines. Suitable initiator compounds which can be alkoxylated to form component (B)(3) in the present invention include, for example, the low molecular weight chain extenders, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butyl carbitol, butanediol, pentanediol, bisphenol A, neopentyl glycol, trimethyl pentanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol, trimethylol propane, etc. Mixtures of suitable initiator compounds can also be used provided that the functionality of the resultant polyol mixture is at least about 2.0.<br>
Suitable polyethers include, for example, those compounds based on di-functional starters such as, for example, water, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, etc. These compounds include'copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>
Another suitable group of polyethers includes polyoxyalkylene polyols, and particularly, the low unsaturation (low monol) poly(oxypropylene/oxy-ethylene) polyols manufactured with double metal cyanide catalyst. The poly(oxypropylene/oxyethylene) low unsaturation polyols as herein defined are prepared by oxyalkylating a suitably hydric initiator compound with propylene oxide and ethylene oxide in the presence of a double metal cyanide catalyst. Preferably, double metal cyanide complex catalysts such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,158,922 and 5,470,813, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, are used. Particularly preferred polyols include the random poly(oxypropylene/oxy-ethylene) polyols having low unsaturation as described herein, for example, U.S. Patent 5,605,939, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The amount of ethylene oxide in the ethylene oxide/propylene oxide mixture may be increased during the latter stages of the polymerization to increase the primary hydroxyl content of the polyol. Alternatively, the low unsaturation polyol may be capped with ethylene oxide using non-DMC catalysts. Of course, it is necessary here to observe the above described limits for ethylene oxide content in the resultant polyether polyols.<br>
When the oxyalkylation is performed in the presence of double metal cyanide catalysts, it is preferable that initiator molecules containing strongly basic groups such as primary and secondary amines be avoided. Further, when employing double metal cyanide complex catalysts, it is generally desirable to oxyalkylate an oligomer which comprises a previously oxyalkylated "monomeric" initiator molecule. It has been found, particularly with vicinal hydroxyl groups, that DMC oxyalkylation is initially slow and may be preceded by a considerable "induction period" where<br>
essentially no oxyalkylation takes place. Use of a polyoxyalkylene oligomer having an hydroxyl number greater than about 600 has been found to mitigate these effects. The polyoxyalkylene oligomeric initiators may be prepared by oxyalkylating a "monomeric" initiator in the presence of traditional basic catalysts such as sodium or potassium hydroxide or other non-DMC catalysts. It is typically necessary to neutralize and/or remove these basic catalysts prior to addition and initiation of the DMC catalyst.<br>
Suitable catalysts (C) include organic metal compounds, especially organic tin compounds, organic bismuth compounds, and organic tin-sulfur compounds. Suitable organic tin compounds include preferably those which contain sulfur atoms, such as dioctyl tin mercaptide (German Auslegeschrift 1,769,367 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,927), and, preferably, tin(ll) salts of carboxylic acids, such as tin(ll) acetate, tin(ll) octoate, tin(ll) ethylhexoate, and tin(ll) laurate, as well as tin(IV) compounds. Some examples of suitable tin catalysts include compounds such as, for example, dimethyltin carboxylates such as, for example, dimethyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dichloride, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin maleate, dibutyltin oxide, and dioctyltin diacetate. The preferred organometallic catalyst comprises a tin(IV) catalyst comprising dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dilaurate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable catalysts to be used also include, for example, tertiary amine catalysts such as, for example, triethylamine, triethylenediamine, tributylamine, N-methyl-morpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, triethanolamine, triisopropanol-amine, N-methyldiethanol-mine, N-ethyldiethanolamine, and N,N-dimethylethanol-amine.<br>
Other catalysts that may be employed, but are less preferred are the salts of cobalt, mercury, bismuth and zinc, which contain organic ligands. Suitable bismuth compounds include, for example, bismuth neodecanoate, bismuth versalate, and various bismuth carboxylates known in the art.<br>
Any of the above-mentioned catalysts may, of course, be used as mixtures. Further representatives of catalysts to be used according to the invention and details concerning their mode of action are described in Kunststoff Handbuch, Volume VII, published by Vieweg and Huchtlen, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich, 1966, for example, on pages 96 to 102.<br>
The catalyst is typically used in a quantity ranging from about 0.001 to about 5%, preferably from about 0.0015 to about 2% by weight, based on 100% by weight of the total system. The catalyst is preferably added to the polyisocyanate or the polyisocyanate prepolymer at the time of processing.<br>
In addition, various additives may also be present in the reaction such as, for example, surface-active additives such as air-release agents, defoamers, and other additives such as anti-oxidants, ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers, flame retarding agents, plasticizers, antioxidants, adhesion promoters, dyes, viscosity depressants, color blockers, optical brighteners, internal mold release agents, etc. known to be useful in polyurethane chemistry. Suitable antioxidants include multifunctional hindered phenols such as, for example, Irganox 245, Irganox 1010, Irganox 1135, etc. Suitable UV stabilizers include, for example, benzotriazoles and hindered amine light stabilizers. Specific examples include Tinuvin 328, Tinuvin 765, Cyasorb 3604, Cyasorb 5411 and Cyasorb 5411, etc. Formamidines such as Givsorb UV-1 may also be employed. However, any of the known antioxidants and/or UV stabilizers may be used. If a stabilizer selected from the group consisting of antioxidants, UV-stabilizers, hindered amine light stabilizers, and mixtures thereof is present, it maybe added to either the polyisocyanate prepolymer or to the isocyanate-reactive component. Specific advantages, particularly with regard to weathering, have been found in reaction mixtures which contain antioxidants and/or UV stabilizers.<br>
Other additives which may be used in the process according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, surface-active additives, defoamers and air-release agents. Suitable air release agents or defoamers may be either silicone based or non-silicones. The preferred defoamers are those that do not affect the clarity of the product. Alkali metal or ammonium salts of sulfonic acid such as dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid or dinaphthyl methane sulfonic acid and also fatty acids may also be used as surface-active additives.<br>
In addition, internal mold release agents may or may not be used in accordance with the present invention. Suitable internal mold release agents include, for example, those which are known to be suitable for polyurethane and/or polyurea systems, including, for example, metallic stearates such as, for example, zinc stearate, N-stearyl-N',N'-bis-hydroxyethyl urea, oleyl polyoxyethylene amide, stearyl diethanol amide, isostearyl diethanolamide, polyoxyethylene glycol monoleate, a pentaerythritol/adipic acid/oleic acid ester, a hydroxy ethyl imidazole derivative of oleic acid, N-stearyl propylene diamine and the sodium salts of castor oil sulfonates or of fatty acids. Other internal mold release agents include, for example, various proprietary blends and formulations which are commercially available as Axel INT-1685/OG and AXEL INT-1681/OG from Axel Plastics. Axel INT-1685-OG is a preferred internal mold release agent. Other internal mold release agents such as those based on fluorine may also be employed. Examples of these include those which are commercially available from DuPont under the trade name Zonyl.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, when an internal mold release agent is included, it is preferred that the internal mold release agent does not have a detrimental affect on optical clarity of the resultant part. It is also preferred that the maximum transmittance is attained while simultaneously maintaining very low haze in the resultant parts. Due to differences in chemistry resulting from the selection of the<br>
isocyanates/isocyanate prepolymers, primary and secondary amine components, and, optionally, hydroxyl containing components, as well as the relative amounts of components, which component the internal mold release agent is added to (i.e. isocyanate or isocyanate-reactive component), etc., different internal mold release agents may work better for one system than another. This is, however, readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
When using the polyurethane-ureas of the present invention for end-use applications in which optical clarity is important such as, for example, prescription lenses, it is generally necessary that the materials have a transmittance greater than or equal to 90%.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is preferred that the various additives are included in the isocyanate component and/or the isocyanate-reactive component by means of suitable additive packages as described herein below. These additive packages as described herein provide a package of additives in various amounts that are preferably included in the isocyanate or prepolymer component, and a separate package of additives in various amounts that are preferably included in the isocyanate-reactive component. The ranges for additives in these packages as set forth below are given in % by weight, based on 100% by weight of the total system. By total system, it is meant the total weight of the isocyanate component and the stoichiometrically required amount of. the isocyanate-reactive component to achieve a specified isocyanate index within the ranges given herein. Suitable ranges for the isocyanate index are from 95 to 110, and preferably from 100 to 105.<br>
Suitable ranges for the additive package used in combination with the isocyanate component in one embodiment of the present invention are as follows:<br>
Broad Range:	Preferred Range:<br>
Catalyst	0.0010 to 5.0	0.0015 to 2.0<br>
Stabilizer	0.5 to 10.0	1.0 to 6.0<br>
Mold Release	0 to 2.0	0 to 1.0<br>
Defoamer	0.2 to 2.0	0.2 to 1.0<br>
Brightener	0.0001 to 0.002	0.0001 to 0.0005<br>
As used herein, stabilizer refers to one or more UV stabilizers that may be used synergisticaiiy. For example, a combination of benzotriazole or formamidine and a hindered amine light stabilizer may be employed.<br>
Suitable ranges for additives for the package used in combination with the isocyanate reactive component in one embodiment of the present invention are as follows:<br>
Broad Range:	Preferred Range:<br>
, Antioxidant	0.1 to 5.0	1.0 to 3.0<br>
Defoamer	0.2 to 2.0	0.2 to 1.0<br>
Brightener	0.0001 to 0.001	0.0001 to 0.0005<br>
In the one-stage (or "one-shot") method, the isocyanate reactive component as well as any additives and auxiliaries are typically combined and thoroughly blended in a premix. The liquid polyisocyanate or polyisocyanate prepolymer (A) is then mixed with the premix in a container by agitation or in the mixhead of a low-pressure, meter-mix machine. External release agents, such as silicone oils, or the commercially available RainX which is useful for glass molds, are often applied to the mold surface prior to the molding process. It is, however, also possible to use both the so-called "internal release agents", and external release agents.<br>
The reactants are used in quantities such that the Isocyanate Index is from about 95 to 110, preferably from about 100 to about 105. By "isocyanate index" is meant the quotient of the number of isocyanate<br>
groups divided by the number of isocyanate-reactive groups, multiplied by<br>
100.<br>
The polyurethane-urea materials of the present invention are prepared in open or closed molds maintained at temperatures of 25°C to about 80°C, preferably from 25°C to about 65°C. The gel time for the one-shot process of the present invention is preferably greater than 2 minutes. These materials may be hand-cast or machine cast. The resultant solid polyurethane-ureas of the. invention may be demolded after an initial green cure at 110°C for 2-4 hours, and subsequently post-cured at 110°C for 16 hours. Green Cure Time as used herein is defined as the time required for the solid polyurethane-urea to acquire sufficient physical and mechanical integrity to enable demolding. Optimum physical properties of these polyurethane-ureas are obtained by then continuing the postcure at 110°C for 16 hours. These solid polyurethane-ureas exhibit very good dimensional stability at elevated temperature and do not show "creep" even in the lower hardness range.<br>
The optically clear, solid light-stable polyurethane-ureas obtainable by the novel process may be used as a glass substitute, for example as sun roofs, front windows, back windows or side windows in automotive or aircraft construction and/or as lamp covers, for example as front lamps or rear lamps in aircraft or automotive construction. The solid optically-clear polyurethane-ureas prepared according to the invention may preferably be used, for example, in optical applications such as lenses for ophthalmic lenses and lens blanks for eyeglasses, sunglasses and safety glasses, visors, goggles, shaped masks, and security glass.<br>
The following examples further illustrate details for the preparation and use of the compositions of this invention. The invention, which is set forth in the foregoing disclosure, is not to be limited either in spirit or scope by these examples. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions of the following procedures can be used. Unless otherwise noted, all temperatures are degrees Celsius, and<br>
all parts and percentages are parts by weight and percentages by weight, respectively.<br>

General Procedure for Preparation of Prepolymers:<br>
An amount of ISO A required to produce the desired isocyanate group content was charged to a one-gallon flask equipped with a stirrer and an outlet for vacuum degassing. The required amount of catalyst (see formula for Isocyanate Component) was then added to the reactor. The isocyanate was stirred and heated to 70-80°C. Calculated amounts of pre-melted isocyanate-reactive components (i.e. polyethers or polyesters as shown in formula for Isocyanate Component) were then added to the reactor at such a rate that the temperature of the reacting mixture did not exceed 80°C. After addition of the isocyanate-reactive components was completed, accurate amounts of the remaining additives were added to the reactor. The reaction mixture was then degassed under continuous stirring at 80 ± 5°C for a period of 3-4 hours as required to achieve the<br>
desired isocyanate content.<br>
In addition to the compositional information shown in Tables 1A and 1B for each isocyanate/prepolymer component, suitable ranges for additives to be included in the isocyanate/prepolymer component of the present invention are provided in the specification. The following is a particularly preferred additive package for a prepolymer composition of the invention herein. This particular formula (i.e. Isocyanate Component) corresponds to Prepolymer A which was used in some examples. As shown in Table 1 A, Prepolymer A contains only the isocyanate and polypi components of the prepolymer. The pbw's for the components of prepolymers in Tables 1A and 1B have been normalized to 100%. The pbw's shown below (in Isocyanate Component) for these components of the prepolymer also include the additive package that is added to the base Prepolymer A in Table 1 A.   (Table Removed)<br>
Table 1 A:      Prepolymer Compositions A1  (Table Removed)<br>
General Procedure for Preparation of Polyol Compositions:<br>
Under a continuous stream of dry nitrogen, a three-necked flask<br>
was charged with  required amounts of (i)  hydroxy functional polyol<br>
(polyether or polyester), (ii) primary aromatic diamine component, (iii)<br>
secondary diamine component, (iv) defoamer, (v) antioxidant and (vi)<br>
brightener. The blend was kept stirred and degassed at 60°C until it was<br>
completely free of air. Vacuum was broken with dry nitrogen and material<br>
transferred to dry containers and blanketed with dry nitrogen. These<br>
blends   were   then   reacted   with   the   isocyanates   and   isocyanate<br>
prepolymers to form polyurethane-ureas. These polyol compositions are<br>
shown in Tables 2A and 2B.<br>
In addition to the compositional information shown in Tables 2A<br>
and 2B for each polyol blend, suitable ranges for additives to be included<br>
in the polyol blends suitable for the present invention are provided in the<br>
specification. As with the isocyanate/prepolymer component, there is a<br>
preferred additive package for the polyol blends of the present invention.<br>
The following is a particularly preferred additive package for polyol blends<br>
of the invention herein. This particular polyol blend corresponds to Polyol<br>
Blend B which was used in some of the examples. As shown in Table 2A,<br>
Polyol Blend B contains only the isocyanate-reactive components of the<br>
polyol blend. The pbw's for the isocyanate-reactive components of the<br>
polyol blends shown in Tables 2A and 2B have been normalized to 100%.<br>
The pbw's shown below for the isocyanate-reactive components of the<br>
polyol blend include the additive package added to base Polyol Blend B in<br>
Table 2.<br>
The following additives were included in each Polyol Blend B: (Table Removed)<br><br>

General Procedure for Preparation of Solid Polyurethane-Ureas:<br>
All castings were made at an isocyanate to polyol/amine index of 105. Hand castings were made by batch mixing stoichiometric amounts of the isocyanate and isocyanate reactive components on a Hauschild High Speed Mixer DAC400FV from FlackTek Inc. at mixing speeds of 1000-1600 RPM for 10-40 seconds and pouring into suitable molds. All examples from Tables 3A and 3B were hand cast. Machine castings with continuous pour capability were made on a Max Machine which has the capability to degas in the re-circulation mode. Of the Examples shown in Tables 3A and 3B, only Examples 1 and 2 were also processed on the Max machine. However, all results reported in Tables 3A and 3B are for the hand cast molds which were prepared using the Hauschild High Speed Mixer to mix the two components as described above.<br>
Hand Castings:<br>
Calculated amounts of the Isocyanate component and the polyol/amine or amine component were separately degassed at 25°C until completely free of dissolved air. A stoichiometric amount of the polyol/amine component was added to the isocyanate component, the container closed and placed in the High Speed Mixer. After high speed stirring for 10-40 seconds to homogenously mix the two components, the container was removed from the mixer, the lid removed and the reacting clear liquid mixture poured into either an open or closed, reinforced glass mold. The mold sizes varied, with most being either 6" square or 12" square. In general, they were maintained at 25°C, but they may be warmed if needed to a temperature of, for example, 65°C. If a mold release agent was used, the mold release agent was applied before heating. In addition, any mold release agent used should be optically-clear, if the resultant parts are for optical applications. Once the mold was filled, it was placed in a convection oven at 110°C for a period of time (see Table 3A and Table 3B) after which the part was easily demoldable. The  demolded parts were then post-cured at<br>
110°C for 16 hours in an electric convection oven.<br>
Machine Castings:<br>
Isocyanate and Polyol components were charged to the day tanks on the machine and degassed thoroughly in the re-circulation mode until all the dissolved air was removed. The isocyanate component was maintained at a temperature of 32 to 45°C while the polyol component was maintained at (25-30°C). The RPM's on the isocyanate and polyol pumps were adjusted to dispense accurate amounts of Isocyanate and polyol for an index of 105. The mix ratio was checked with the machine in the calibration mode. The machine was switched to the pour mode and parts produced by pouring the reaction mixture into either open or closed, glass molds. Typical mold sizes were also 6" square or 12" square. As in Hand Casting, demolding was typically after 2-3 hours (see Table 3A and Table 3B). Parts were then post-cured at 110°C for 16 hours in an electric convection oven.<br>
