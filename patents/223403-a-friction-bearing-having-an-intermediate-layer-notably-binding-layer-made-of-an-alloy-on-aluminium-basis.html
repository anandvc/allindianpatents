				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to friction bearing having an intermediate layer, notably binding layer,<br>
made of an alloy on aluminium base intended to enhance the mechanical properties of<br>
metallic substances of differing composition and a method of producing this friction bearing.<br>
It is becoming more commonplace for multi-layered materials, in particular those used in<br>
plain bearings for components designed to rotate at high speeds, e.g. motor shafts, to be made<br>
such that the layered materials have a structure comprising basic shell-bonding layer-bearing<br>
shell, especially if the bearing shell is made from a light metal alloy. The bonding layer fulfils<br>
an important function, particularly if the light metal alloy contains mechanically soft<br>
components such as tin, lead or similar, for example.<br>
It is common practice to use a pure aluminium which is technically pure for the bonding layer,<br>
e.g. A 199.5. Over the course of development, light metal bearing alloys designed for use in<br>
modern motors and machinery have been required to withstand increasingly high loads and<br>
are fast becoming the weakest link of the multi-layered material. For example, pure<br>
aluminium has now been found to have distinct disadvantages as regards dynamic strength<br>
and heat resistance as compared with the new generation of light metal-bearing alloys.<br>
Various concepts have already been suggested as a means of alleviating these problems. DE<br>
40 37 746 Al and DE 43 12 537 Al, for example, propose using hardenable aluminium alloys<br>
for the bonding layer. However, since the production process used to join layers also involves<br>
several heat treatments, these hardenable materials rank on the highest level of strength in<br>
terms of their structure. In addition to a partially inadmissible adverse effect on the desired<br>
ductility, there is also the risk of over-ageing and hence an undesirable reduction in the<br>
service life of the finished product when the bearing point is subjected thermal and dynamic<br>
load.<br>
A totally different approach is to use nickel, copper or similar layers, galvanised onto the base<br>
shell and dispense with an aluminium-based bonding layer altogether. Because of the low<br>
metallurgical affinity between bearing alloys of light metal on the one hand and nickel, copper<br>
or similar on the other, the bonding strength remains limited by the degree of adhesion and<br>
clamping, whereas if using pairs comprising a bonding layer of light metal/light metal bearing<br>
layer the adhesive joining forces produced in the bonding plane by means of heat treatment<br>
and diffusion improves the strength of an increased number of layers, which virtually exhibit<br>
the traits of metallurgical diffusion and reaction zones.<br>
Various different aluminium alloys for friction bearings or friction bearings of differing<br>
compositions are known from WO 98/17833 A, WO97/22725 A, EP 0 672 840 A and DE 30<br>
00 772 A. The different compositions of alloys described therein are intended to improve the<br>
durability of the soft phases, including those present in particularly high proportions,<br>
dispersed in the aluminium alloy. A number of ways of achieving this objective are described,<br>
for example by embedding hard particles as a means of interrupting an end-to-end tin<br>
network. EP 0 672 840 A in particular proposes a solution which involves using a hardenable<br>
aluminium alloy as an intermediate layer for friction bearings.<br>
The underlying objective of the invention is to provide an intermediate layer with an<br>
aluminium base which will improve the quality of the bonding material, for example its<br>
mechanical properties, by matching the individual layers with one another more effectively.<br>
This objective is achieved by a friction bearing having at least three layers of differing<br>
composition, at least one intermediate layer being made from an alloy with an aluminum base<br>
containing 0.015% by weight to 10% by weight of at least one element from the group<br>
consisting of So, Y, Hf, Ta, La, lanthanides and actinides and optionally a total of up to 12%<br>
by weight of at least one element from the group consisting of Li, Zn, Si, Mg or up to a total<br>
of 10% by weight of at least one element from the group consisting of Ma, Cu, Be. Ca, Zr.<br>
Mo. W, Ag or up to a total of 10% by weight of at least one element from the group<br>
consisting of Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni or up to a total of 10% by weight of at least one element<br>
from the group consisting of Pd, Au, Pt, In. Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, Te. and the remainder being<br>
formed by aluminium with smelt-related impurities. The advantage here is thai an<br>
intermediate layer for a friction bearing made from an Al alloy can be provided, which does<br>
not exhibit any marked hardening behaviour whilst exhibiting a high ductility due to the<br>
finely dispersed distribution of A3M-phases and, in spite of the breakdown of solidified<br>
materials occurring during the manufacturing process due to heat treatments, high values of<br>
mechanical strength can be preserved. As a result, a product can be made which exhibits good<br>
thermal, static and dynamic stability. This intermediate layer is particularly well suited to<br>
plain bearings and the anti-friction layer of such plain bearings can be made from high-<br>
strength materials of a new kind. The advantage of this is the fact that this intermediate layer<br>
or the material used to produce it may have a high re-crystallisation temperature, which means<br>
that heat treatments or deformation processes can be performed at increased temperatures<br>
without giving rise to an undesirable reduction in hardness. Yet another advantage is that<br>
because of the possibility of using multiple combinations of individual elements, material<br>
characteristics can be freely adjusted within specific limits, thereby enabling the inherent cost<br>
of producing the intermediate layer to be controlled accordingly. On the other hand, however,<br>
being able to introduce radioactive elements or isotopes such as U235 into the alloy<br>
simultaneously means that tracers can be incorporated in the alloy for test purposes so as to<br>
monitor the behaviour of the material on different test machines.<br>
By using different proportions of the large number of possible element combinations, <br>
particularly when using the intermediate layer as a bonding layer for a friction bearing, this<br>
layer can be readily adapted to specific requirements, in particular to the properties of the<br>
other layers comprising the friction bearing. The effects which can be achieved by introducing<br>
the specified elements into the alloy can be taken from the detailed description below.<br>
Also different heat treatments provide an intermediate layer whose hardness is high enough to<br>
allow this intermediate layer to be combined with higher-strength materials such as new types<br>
of bearing materials, for example, and the process used to produce these intermediate layers<br>
can be shortened since it is possible to operate heat treatments at higher temperatures.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for producing a friction<br>
bearing, wherein the intermediate layer made from a previously hardened material made by a<br>
casting process, an extrusion process or a continuous casting process is rolled with at least one<br>
other material. As a result, the friction bearing can be made so that it has a surface which is<br>
suitable as a bearing for shafts rotating at high speed on the one hand, and, on the other hand,<br>
has a coating by means of which the forces transmitted onto the multi-layered material can be<br>
transferred. Advantageously, the quality of the bonding can be improved since the properties<br>
are intrinsic to multiple layers of the aluminium base.<br>
The layers of the friction bearing may be rolled together and are tempered after every overall<br>
forming process by at least 25% and at most 91% in one or more forming step at a<br>
temperature in the range of between 85 ° C. and 445 ° C. This is of advantage because<br>
undesirable tension can be released after each massive forming process.<br>
The friction bearing can be made by a whole range of possible methods, which means that the<br>
method best suited to the desired friction bearing can be selected. Thus, an anti-friction layer<br>
may be applied on top of the intermediate layer or the intermediate layer may be applied on<br>
top of the anti-friction layer and/or the intermediate layer may be applied on top of a base<br>
shell by a rolling process, a CVD process, galvanic processing, cathode sputtering, or a<br>
vacuum vapour deposition process.<br>
The thickness of intermediate products of the friction bearing may be reduced by means of a<br>
plating process in a rolling mill in the range of 20% to 75% with each pass. Thus, the number<br>
of individual method steps can be selectively controlled during the plating process so that the<br>
manufacturing costs or time needed can also be controlled accordingly.<br>
Advantageously, the friction bearing may be used as a thrust ring or thrust washer.<br>
In order to provide a clearer understanding, the invention will be described in more detail<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a very simplified diagram of the bonding layer used to impart adhesion in a friction<br>
bearing as proposed by the invention;<br>
FIG. 2 shows the grain pattern of the intermediate layer with finely dispersed Al3Sc<br>
precipitations;<br>
FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating the bearing behaviour during service of friction bearings with<br>
anti-friction and intermediate layers of different aluminium alloys plated on a layer of steel, as<br>
the bearing load changes over a period of time;<br>
Firstly, it should be pointed out that the same parts described in the different embodiments are<br>
denoted by the same reference numbers and the same component names and the disclosures<br>
made throughout the description can be transposed in terms of meaning to same parts bearing<br>
the same reference numbers or same component names.<br>
Furthermore, individual features or combinations of features from the different embodiments il-<br>
lustrated and described may be construed as independent inventive solutions or solutions pro-<br>
posed by the invention in their own right.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a multi-layered material 1 as proposed by the invention, for example in the form<br>
of a friction bearing 2. Although the description concentrates on an anti-friction bearing 2 as an<br>
example of one application of this multi-layered material 1, this does not mean that the use of the<br>
multi-layered material 1 is restricted and in fact, on the contrary, the multi-layered material 1<br>
finds numerous conceivable and different embodiments and applications, for example where a<br>
steel base shell is dispensed with or in which the steel base shell is replaced by other materials,<br>
e.g. for manufacturing thrust bearings or thrust washers and for known designs of friction bear-<br>
ings 2 subjected to radial or axial loads.<br>
The multi-layered material 1, in particular the friction bearing 2. usually comprises a first periph-<br>
eral layer 3, hereafter referred to as the anti-friction layer 4, an intermediate layer 5 and a second<br>
peripheral layer 6, hereafter referred to as the base shell 7. Again, this structure is not restrictive<br>
and in particular several layers of a same and/or different composition may be incorporated be-<br>
tween the anti-friction layer 4 and the base shell 7, in which case the specific layout may be var-<br>
ied depending on the intended application.<br>
The hardness of the individual layers of the multi-layered material 1 is preferably different and in<br>
particular increases starting from the first peripheral layer 3 in the direction towards the second<br>
peripheral layer 6 opposing it. Clearly, however, it would also be possible to arrange layers of<br>
differing hardness values in the opposite direction or to provide two or more layers may of a<br>
same, mean hardness. If the multi-layered material 1 is used in a friction bearing 2, however, it<br>
has proved to be of advantage if the anti-friction layer 4 has the lowest hardness and the base<br>
shell 7 is the hardest.<br>
As may be seen from Fig. 1, the bearing member is designed as a half-shell. Clearly, however, it<br>
would also be possible to make full-shell variants using the multi-layered material 1 proposed by<br>
the invention, as shown by the broken lines in Fig. I.<br>
Bearing members, e.g. friction bearings 2, are generally used to support rotary components, e.g.<br>
shafts for machines, motors, etc.. Since these shafts are normally operated at high rotation speeds<br>
- with the exception of the run-up and shut-down phase - it is necessary to prevent driving fric-<br>
tion on the bearing and shaft. One possible way of doing this, apart from designing the anti-<br>
friction layer 4 as an aluminium alloy with a high proportion of tin, is to provide a groove 8 in<br>
the anti-friction layer 4, in which an appropriate lubricant such as oil can be placed and guided.<br>
This groove 8 may either be provided in the form of a flat groove having side walls 10 which be-<br>
come wider in the direction of an end face 9 and/or as a circumferential groove, as illustrated by<br>
the dotted-dashed lines of Fig. 1. Clearly, there are other possible ways of introducing lubricants,<br>
e.g. by end-to-end bores.<br>
The groove 8 may also serve as a means of picking up any solid particles which might result<br>
from friction on the anti-friction layer 4 for example, which may optionally be carried away with<br>
the lubricant. It would also be possible for at least one of the edges of the anti-friction layer 4 op-<br>
posite a surface 11 to be discontinuous, thereby enabling undesirable solid particles to be carried<br>
away to the side.<br>
The individual layers of the multi-layered material 1, in particular of the friction bearing 2, are<br>
joined so as to prevent any displacement, e.g. by plating, rolling, welding, bonding, clamping,<br>
etc., in order to ensure that the load is reliably transmitted. In selecting joining methods, particu-<br>
lar care should be taken to allow for high loads, in particular increased temperatures.<br>
The base shell 7 may be made from a metallic substance such as steel or similar and should ab-<br>
sorb some of the forces transmitted to the anti-friction layer 4 from a shaft.<br>
Although the description below relates to a friction bearing 2 with a structure of three layers, it<br>
would, of course, also be possible for such a friction bearing 2 to be made with two layers. This<br>
is a distinct possibility more especially if the alloys used for the intermediate layer 5 are specifi-<br>
cally selected as a means of producing a hardness capable of assuming and transmitting the<br>
forces which arise or if the intermediate layer 5 is selected to have properties that will support the<br>
functions of the anti-friction layer.<br>
The intermediate layer 5, which in particular may operate as a bonding layer between the indi-<br>
vidual layers adjacent thereto, e.g. the anti-friction layer 4 and the base shell 7, preferably con-<br>
sists of an alloy with an aluminium base, the alloy having a content of scandium (Sc) in added<br>
quantities of a maximum 10% by weight, preferably 4% by weight, and in particular between<br>
0.015% by weight and 3.25% by weight, the remainder being aluminium (Al) with the usual im-<br>
purities which occur during smelting. All the specified quantities given here for the composition<br>
of alloys should be understood as proportions by weight relative to 100% by weight of the total<br>
alloy.<br>
It has also proved to be of particular advantage if the scandium content of the aluminium alloy is<br>
between 0.015% by weight and 2.5% by weight or between 0.015% by weight and 1.0% by<br>
weight.<br>
In addition to Sc, other elements may also be incorporated in the alloy as a means of adjusting or<br>
improving the properties of the intermediate layer 5. For example, Sc may be at least partially<br>
replaced by an element from the group consisting of yttrium (Y), hafnium (Hf), niobium (Nb),<br>
tantalum (Ta) and lanthanum (La) or Sc may be at least partially replaced by at least one element<br>
from the group consisting of lanthanides, for example cerium (Ce), praseodym (Pr), neodym<br>
(Nd), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gaudolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dys-<br>
prosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb) or lutetium (Lu). Alter-<br>
natively, it is also possible to replace the Sc, at least partially, by an element from the group con-<br>
sisting of actinides, such as thorium (Th), protactinium (Pa), uranium (U) or similar, for exam-<br>
ple.<br>
In addition, the aluminium alloy may contain other elements for modifying the structure or for<br>
modifying its properties. For example, it would be possible to incorporate at least one element<br>
from the group consisting of lithium (Li), zinc (Zn), silicon (Si) or Magnesium (Mg) in a maxi-<br>
mum quantity in total of 12% by weight, preferably a maximum of 6.5% by weight and in par-<br>
ticular a maximum of 4.2% by weight. Moreover, the aluminium alloy of the intermediate layer<br>
5 may also contain at least one element from the group consisting of manganese (Mn), copper<br>
(Cu), beryllium (Be), calcium (Ca), zircon (Zr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) or silver (Ag)<br>
in a maximum quantity of 10% by weight in total, preferably a maximum quantity of 5% by<br><br>
weight, in particular a maximum of 1.5% by weight. It would also be possible to incorporate at<br>
least one element from the group consisting of titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), iron<br>
(Fe), cobalt (Co) or nickel (Ni) in the alloy in a total maximum quantity of 10% by weight, pref-<br>
erably a maximum of 4% by weight, in particular 1.5% by weight. Furthermore, the alloy might<br>
additionally contain at least one of the elements from the group consisting of palladium (Pd),<br>
gold (Au), platinum (Pt), indium (In), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), bis-<br>
muth (Bi), tellurium (Te) in a maximum quantity of 10% by weight in total, preferably a maxi-<br>
mum of 6.5% by weight.<br>
The properties of the aluminium alloy can be specially adjusted to suit specific purposes by in-<br>
corporating the alloying elements listed above.<br>
Adding Sc to Al-alloys is a practice that has long been known. For example, structural materials<br>
with an aluminium base containing added quantities of scandium are known from the prior art<br>
and are primarily used in space travel and the aircraft industry. Not only are these alloys light-<br>
weight, they also exhibit the property of super-elasticity, which is mainly attributable to a highly<br>
degenerative re-crystallisation behaviour.<br>
Aluminium-lithium alloys, for example, are known form US 5,226,983 A, EP 0 158 769 B1 and<br>
US 4,816,087 A, which contain a greater or lesser proportion of added quantities of scandium.<br>
The possibility of using these alloys as a structural material is primarily due to precipitations of<br>
tri-aluminides. e.g. Al3Li, Al3Zr or Al3Sc, Al3Sc precipitations of this type are also described in<br>
both US patents US 4,874,440 A and US 5,055,257 A. They discuss the possibility of replacing<br>
the scandium partially or in full with an element from the group consisting of the lanthanides and<br>
state that, in obtaining the desired properties of the structural materials, it is important that the<br>
tri-aluminides mentioned should be contained in the aluminium matrix.<br>
Al alloys which contain Zr and a number of other elements in addition to Sc are known from US<br>
5,620,652 A. In this US patent, a plurality of possible options is described, for example for fit-<br>
ness equipment, structural materials for the aircraft industry, the automotive industry or for ap-<br>
plications in the marine sector. One of the advantages is stated as being that by using these alloys<br>
in the specified applications, the mass to be displaced, in other words the weight, can bring a not<br>
inconsiderable saving on the quantity of fuel needed, whilst preserving mechanical strength.<br>
As may be seen from the paragraphs above, these alloys have long been regarded as important,<br>
particularly in the field of structural materials. The possibility of using Al-Sc alloys of this type<br>
as multi-layered materials 1, however, in particular for friction bearings 2, has not been disclosed<br>
until now.<br>
Having specifically endeavoured to seek out new possibilities of improving the quality of multi-<br>
layered materials 1, the applicant has now found, surprisingly, that Al-Sc alloys are especially<br>
suitable for use as multi-layered materials 1, in particular friction bearings 2. In the case of fric-<br>
tion bearings 2 of a structure comprising anti-friction layer 4/intermediate layer 5/ base shell 7, it<br>
is important for the intermediate layer to be able to assume a function whereby it imparts adhe-<br>
sion between the anti-friction layer 4 and the base shell 7. To this end, the intermediate layer 5<br>
should combine, as far as possible, at least a part of the mechanical and/or chemical properties of<br>
said two other layers, thereby affording a more or less continuous transition of the properties<br>
between the individual layers.<br>
The fact that Al3Sc precipitations occur if Sc is incorporated in Al-alloys has been found to be of<br>
advantage. This inter-metallic tri-aluminide phase crystallises with a cubic primitive structure<br>
(three-dimensional group Pm3m) and is isotypical of the Cu3Au structural type. The Sc atoms are<br>
located at the corners of the unit cell. The Al atoms assume the face-centred positions, in other<br>
words 1/2 / 1/2 / 0, 1/2 / 0 / 1/2, etc., for example. In metallic aluminium, on the other hand, the<br>
aluminium atoms are known to assume the positions in a cubic face-centred lattice. Because of<br>
the slight difference in the metal radii of Sc (162 pm, co-ordination number 12) and aluminium<br>
AL (143 pm, co-ordination number 12) (covalent bond proportions are optionally overlooked), it<br>
can be assumed that the tri-aluminide of the Cu3Au type will also assume at least an almost hy-<br>
pothetically cubic face-centred structure. Because, in addition, the lattice parameters of alumin-<br>
ium (a = 0.4049 nm) and Al3Sc (a = 0.4105 nm) are comparable, what are referred to as coherent<br>
phases occur, i.e. the lattice network lines of the aluminium matrix are disrupted but not inter-<br>
rupted. As a result, good deformability is imparted to these alloys, due to the ever present occur-<br>
rence of displacements, as is the case in sliding directions along the octahedral surfaces {111}<br>
which occur with cubic face-centred crystals. Each of these slide planes in turn contains three<br>
slide directions of equal value , making slip possible in 12 different sliding systems.<br>
In addition to the good ductility of this Al-Sc material, however, another advantage is the fact<br>
that Al-alloys of this type do not exhibit any marked hardening behaviour. As a result, optimum<br>
adherence strength can be achieved between the individual layers of the multi-layered material.<br>
However, the hardness may be varied by other alloying elements, as will be described in more<br>
detail below. In particular, the hardness of this intermediate layer 5 may be adjusted so that its<br>
value lies between the hardness of the anti-friction layer 4 and the base shell 7.<br>
Another advantage of these Al-Sc alloys is that high mechanical strength values, are maintained<br>
in spite of the break-down of solidified material due to heat treatments during the production<br>
process. As a result, corresponding thermal, static and dynamic strength can be achieved in the<br>
product. The inter-metallic tri-aluminides mentioned above, for example Al3Sc, are partially re-<br>
sponsible for these properties.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates one of the possible Al-Sc alloys, the composition of which is Al Mn 0.5, SC<br>
0.15. It is clearly evident from the intermediate layer 5 in this grain pattern that Al3Sc crystallite<br>
12 is finely dispersed as stable, spherical precipitations in the aluminium matrix. In addition dif-<br>
ferent binary Al-Mn precipitations 13 can be clearly distinguished by their dimensions. This<br>
finely dispersed pattern structure is made possible due to the coherence of the Al3Sc crystallite 12<br>
relative to the aluminium matrix. In conjunction, the capacity for displacement perpendicular to<br>
the slide planes and the re-crystallisation behaviour can be reduced by increasing the re-<br>
crystallisation temperature. Furthermore, coalescence of the sub-grains is prevented as far as pos-<br>
sible. In comparison with conventional refiners such as Ti, Zr, Mn, etc., for example, the Al-Sc<br>
dispersoids are capable of absorbing a greater volume fraction due to their improved solubility.<br>
As a result of this fine distribution of the Al3Sc crystallite 12. it is also possible that micro-tears<br>
which occur within the Al-Sc alloy "run dead" on these Al3Sc crystallites, thereby producing im-<br>
proved mechanical properties. Due to the heterogeneous seed formation, caused by the high tem-<br>
perature of the Al-Al3Sc eutectics, susceptibility to hot tearing can be reduced, for example, and,<br>
in addition, the weldability of alloys of this type can be improved so that a better bond is possible<br>
between the individual layers of the multi-layered material 1.<br>
The larger volume fraction of the Sc is an important factor in preventing re-crystallisation and<br>
protects against annihilation of the sub-grains. The high coherence can also prevent<br>
displacement of the grain boundaries, thereby enabling a finer grain pattern to be achieved.<br>
Re-crystallisation temperatures of up to 600 ° C. can be achieved if a quantity of Sc is<br>
incorporated. By comparison, aluminium alloys containing manganese (325 °. C). chromium<br>
(325 C.) or zirconium (400 C.) have significantly lower re-crystallisation temperatures.<br>
The advantage which can be achieved by this feature is the improved capacity to process<br>
alloys of this type, i.e. processing can take place at higher temperatures without having to<br>
make allowance for any reduction in mechanical strength to speak of due to re-crystallisation.<br>
Re-crystallisation is caused, for example, by the fact that a cold formed metal, such as a rolled<br>
metal, is in a forced state and when heat is applied to the metal, e.g. when friction bearings are<br>
used in motors with shafts rotating at high speeds for example, tries to break down the<br>
deformation stress and repair disruptions in the lattice. This would be associated with a<br>
significant reduction in the mechanical properties, for example the hardness of these alloys,<br>
and would therefore significantly reduce the service life of friction bearings 2, for example,<br>
i.e. the periods between maintenance and hence the maintenance costs would be increased by<br>
a significant factor.<br>
Over-ageing of alloys of this type can be improved due to the thermal stability of Al3Sc <br>
crystallite 12.<br>
The intermediate layer 5 proposed by the invention and made from Al3Sc crystallite 12 may<br>
have a grain size in the region of between 0.005 .µm and 5 .µm. preferably between 0.1 urn<br>
and 1 urn.<br>
As already mentioned. Sc may be replaced at least partially by a series of other metals. As a<br>
result, not only is it possible to control the costs inherent in the manufacture of the<br>
intermediate layer 5, it is also possible to make adjustments so as to select the properties of<br>
this intermediate layer 5.<br><br>
Elements which may be considered as substitute elements for Sc are those which are able to form<br>
inter-metallic bonds with aluminium, similar to Al3Sc . As a result, it will in turn be possible to<br>
precipitate these inter-metallic bonds from the so-called "solid solution" in aluminium and these<br>
precipitations will have a positive effect on the strength of the Al matrix.<br>
As a III A element, Sc has chemical similarities to Y, the lanthanides and specific transition ele-<br>
ments (rare earths). Similarly to scandium, Y, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb and Lu, for example, form Al3Sc <br>
crystallite and these phases are partially isotypical of the Cu3Au type. Furthermore, as stated in<br>
US 4,874,440 A, the lattice parameter of the cubic primitive unit cell for these precipitations is of<br>
a value which more or less corresponds to that of Al3Sc . At the same time, the differences rela-<br>
tive to the cubic face-centred lattice of the Al matrix are not that significant, which means that<br>
coherent phases can occur embedded in the aluminium matrix. Clearly, the Sc might not be fully<br>
replaced by said elements and instead combined crystals of the Al3M1-xM' x type will form.<br>
If the difference in electron negativity between aluminium and the above-mentioned lanthanide<br>
elements or their metal radii are also compared, it would be conceivable and is indeed possible to<br>
replace the Sc at least partially by these elements or it would be possible for all metals to form<br>
ternary, quaternary or even higher combined crystal series with one another.<br>
Details to this effect are to be found, for example, in the article entitled "Explanatory Alloy De-<br>
velopment in the System Al-Sc-X" (Ralph R. Sawtell and J.W. Morris, Jr.; Dispersion Strength-<br>
ened Aluminium Alloys; Edited by Y.-W. Kim and W.M. Griffith; The Minerals, Metals &amp; Ma-<br>
terial Society, 1988; P. 409 - 420).<br>
Elements from the actinide group may also behave in a similar way.<br>
Although transition elements such as Hf, Nb, Ta, La are significantly larger than Sc, they may<br>
nevertheless exhibit behaviour similar to Sc in aluminium alloys, which can be attributed to<br>
elastic effects.<br>
Transition elements typically crystallise in structure types other than the above-mentioned Cu3Au<br>
type, for example in the cubic Mg2Cu type, of a Laves phase or the orthorhombic AlDy type.<br>
However, combined crystal formations would also be conceivable and the properties could be<br>
adjusted by adding transition elements, thereby increasing the strength, for example, as a result.<br>
This being the case, the transition elements may be almost entirely absorbed in the A3M phases,<br>
which may increase the strength of Al-Sc alloys, for example.<br>
Clearly, it would also be possible to crystallise the elements of lanthanides in other types of<br>
structure, as is the case with the Al3Dy type mentioned above, for example, although an impor-<br>
tant factor in producing coherent phases appears to be that the lattice constants of these A3M<br>
phases must have a value more or less the same as that of the lattice constants of cubic face-<br>
centred aluminium.<br>
In addition to the elements mentioned above, however, the Li and Zr elements may also form<br>
phases of the A3M type in the aluminium matrix. Lithium may be used to avoid producing a sig-<br>
nificant increase in the density of the aluminium alloy. Moreover, it would be possible to vary, in<br>
particular increase, the E-modulus of the Al-Sc alloy by adding lithium.<br>
As established in the article entitled "Influence of the particle size recrystallization and grain<br>
growth in Al-Mg-X alloys" (J.S. Vetrano, S.M. Beuemmer, L.M. Pawlowski, I.M. Robertson;<br>
Materials, Science and Engineering A 238; 1997; 101 ff), zirconium may be substituted for scan-<br>
dium in a quantity of up to 50%-atom. More heat-resistant precipitations can be produced, the<br>
size of this crystallite being largely independent of the homogenisation temperature after casting,<br>
for example, and may lie within the range of between 50 nm and 150 nm. Al3(Zr, Sc) precipita-<br>
tions of this type may prevent recrystallisation almost up to the melting point of the aluminium<br>
alloy, which means that the capacity of alloys of this type to withstand high temperatures and<br>
hence the resultant multi-layered material 1 can be improved.<br>
By adding Zn, however, it is also possible to modify the form of resultant primary aluminides,<br>
for example Mn-, Fe-, Cr-aluminides, etc., for example from the needle shape to spherical<br>
shapes. As a result, alloys of this type are also able to withstand higher temperatures since alu-<br>
minides of a rounded shape form fewer recrystallisation seeds of a rounded shape than of a nee-<br>
dle shape and the recrystallisation behaviour of alloys of this type can be optimised due to the co-<br>
operation of Sc and Zr.<br>
In addition to the metals mentioned above, however, there is a whole series of other elements<br>
which may be added, the explanation below attempting to give a general outline of how these<br>
affect the respective alloys.<br>
Cu, Mg, Si and Zn are absorbed by aluminium in solid solution, which may result in the occur-<br>
rence of aluminium-rich mixed crystals. Cu or Cu and Mg, together with Al for example, form<br>
what are known as thermo-settable Kent alloys, which can be readily formed and rolled. Cu also<br>
has the effect of strengthening the matrix due to hardening of the mixed crystals. More informa-<br>
tion on this aspect can be found in the conference report entitled "The effect of Scandium on the<br>
age-hardening behavior of an Al-Cu alloy" (The fourth international conference on aluminium<br>
alloys; M. Nakayama, Y. Miura, P. 538 ff; 1994). Al2Cu and Al3Sc crystallite precipitate inde-<br>
pendently of one another, thereby avoiding any heterogeneous seed formation. However, pre-<br>
cipitation of these crystallites commences almost simultaneously.<br>
At this stage, it should be pointed out that the precipitation of Al3M phases, in particular Al3Sc ,<br>
usually commences prior to the precipitation of aluminides of other types and these precipitations<br>
can therefore form a crystal seed for the latterly mentioned aluminides. However, as a result of<br>
this early precipitation, it is also possible to distribute Al3Sc crystallite 12 or corresponding pre-<br>
cipitates in a fine dispersion in the aluminium matrix, especially if the A3M phases do not grow<br>
any further after the initial formation of seed but form a plurality of individual crystal seeds.<br>
Al3Sc crystallites 12 may grow to a size of 10 nm and as a result remain finely and almost uni-<br>
formly dispersed. Consequently, as mentioned above, over-ageing of these alloys, can be largely<br>
prevented (see, for example, "The ageing behavior and tensile properties of Al-Sc alloy"; The<br>
third International Conference on Aluminium Alloys: T. Tan, Z. Zheng, B. Wang, Page 290 ff;<br>
1992) and the thermal stability increased. Al3Sc crystallites 12 usually only grow to 100 nm if<br>
they are not dissolved during solution annealing.<br>
Adding Mg alone to alloys of this type does not normally impart hardening capacity.<br>
Si and Mg may form an inter-metallic compound Mg2Si, which is also soluble in the aluminium<br>
matrix depending on temperature and can lead to alloys capable of hardening. Al-Si mixed crys-<br>
tals can increase strength. When adding Mg, however, care should be taken to ensure that the<br>
respective proportion by weight is not too high, which would cause Al3Mg2 phases to precipitate<br>
at the different grain boundaries, which can lead to inter-crystalline corrosion.<br>
Due to the precipitation of Al7Cr, for example, Cr may help to produce finer gains as well as Zr.<br>
Cr is barely soluble in Al and the creep resistance is enhanced due to precipitation of Al7Cr. As a<br>
result, the hardness and strength of aluminium alloys of this type at high temperature can be im-<br>
proved. Furthermore, iron may be bonded due to Al7Cr, thereby preventing a precipitation of<br>
Al3Fe needles. Needle formation of this type affects the mechanical properties of Al alloys and<br>
under certain circumstances can lead to embrittlement.<br>
However, in combination with Mn, Fe forms aluminides which help to impart strength at higher<br>
temperatures.<br>
Co is also insoluble in Al but can increase creep resistance due to the precipitation of Al9Co2 and<br>
also bond Fe.<br>
Cu may increase the tensile strength of the aluminium to a large degree. Alloys containing large<br>
amounts of copper, for example, may be hardened by quenching at almost 555°C.<br>
Like Co and Fe, Ni is insoluble in Al but can increase creep resistance and strength at higher<br>
temperatures as with Co for example, due to precipitations of Al3Ni.<br>
Like Zr, the elements Cr, Hf, Ti, V and Mn may be added to Al alloys in order to produce a finer<br>
grain, in particular to control the grain structure.<br>
Added Mn has a solidifying effect and improves resistance to corrosion, which means that the<br>
recrystallisation temperature can be increased accordingly. Furthermore, as mentioned above,<br>
especially with a small Fe content, the formation of long-spiked brittle Al3Fe needles can be pre-<br>
vented as the iron is absorbed by the more favourably shaped Al6Mn crystals.<br>
Using the elements Sn, Sb, Pb and Bi, the so-called soft-phase formers, the properties of the in-<br>
termediate layer 5 can be adjusted to co-operate with those of the anti-friction layer 4 so that a<br>
good bond is produced between the individual layers of the multi-layered material 1 and in par-<br>
ticular so that the hardness of the anti-friction layer 4 increases in the direction of the base shell<br>
7.<br>
The hardening capacity of Al alloys can be varied with the aid of Ag, Au, Pd and Pt and Al-Ag<br>
alloys can be hardened by precipitation of the AlAg2 equilibrium phase, for example.<br>
The elements W, Ta, Re, Mo, Nb and Ca can also have a positive effect on the plastic properties,<br>
in particular the deformability, of Al alloys of this type.<br>
Be, particularly in multi-element alloys, improves the fine grain structure of the precipitations<br>
from over-saturated solid solution phases.<br>
The elements In, Ge and Te can be used to vary the properties of the aluminium alloy used for<br>
the intermediate layer 5 still further so that it combines to a certain extent both the properties of<br>
the anti-friction layer 4 and the base shell 7.<br>
As already mentioned, the multi-layered material 1 may comprise the anti-friction layer 4. All<br>
materials and alloys which are suitable for the anti-friction layer 4 of the friction bearing 2 may<br>
be used as the materials of the anti-friction layer 4. Bearing materials of this type should have<br>
good sliding properties, a good ductility, a capacity to embed foreign particles, etc., for example.<br>
In addition, they should exhibit corresponding properties of strength.<br>
Suitable materials for anti-friction layers 4 of this type are, for example, aluminium alloys with a<br>
corresponding proportion of soft-phase formers, e.g. Pb, Sn, Sb, Bi, etc.. For example, in addi-<br>
tion to aluminium, the anti-friction layer 4 may also contain tin as the main alloying element, in<br>
which case the proportion of tin will be in the range of between 5% by weight and 45% by<br>
weight, preferably between 14% by weight and 40% by weight, in particular between 16% by<br>
weight and 32% by weight.<br>
In addition to Sn, however, a whole series of other alloying elements may be incorporated, in<br>
which case their proportion as a total may be at most 11 % by weight relative to the total alloy.<br>
For example, at least one alloying element from a group containing Mn, Fe, Cr, Zr, Co and Zn<br>
may be alloyed with at least one alloying element from a group containing Pb, Bi, Sb and In.<br>
However, the anti-friction layer 4 may also be provided as an aluminium alloy with at least 16%<br>
by weight of tin and a total of at most 11 % by weight of other elements, such as Mg, Zn, Pb, Bi,<br>
Li, Sb, In, Fe, Cr, Mn, Cu or similar.<br>
The above-mentioned elements may be present in the alloy individually, i.e. they need not neces-<br>
sarily be combined, although this poses a restriction in that whenever an element from the group<br>
Mg and Zn is used, an element from the group Pb and Bi must be incorporated in the alloy.<br>
The proportion of Cu may be between 0.65% by weight and 1.80% by weight, preferably be-<br>
tween 1.35% by weight and 1.45% by weight, in particular 1.44% by weight, that of Mn between<br>
0.25% by weight and 0.75% by weight, preferably between 0.35% by weight and 0.50% by<br>
weight, in particular 0.47% by weight, that of Fe between 0.15% by weight and 0.55% by weight,<br>
preferably between 0.18% by weight and 0.28% by weight, in particular 0.24% by weight and<br>
that of Cr between 0.05% by weight and 0.18% by weight, preferably between 0.07% by weight<br>
and 0.15% by weight, in particular 0.08% by weight. The rest making up 100% is Al with the<br>
usual impurities occurring within the range at which the raw material is broken down and inher-<br>
ent in the production process.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an alloy of the following composition is used, the fig-<br>
ures being given as percentages by weight:<br><br>
This composition is, of course, only one of many examples of different variations, too numerous<br>
to list here. However, this does not mean that the invention is limited to this example.<br>
Characteristic of alloys of this type based on the specified limits of elements incorporated in the<br>
alloy is the fact once the constituent elements have been melted and then cooled, a precipitation<br>
of what are referred to as hard particles occurs, which form bonds, for example an aluminide<br>
bond, containing a multi-component system. These hard particles on the one hand assume the<br>
hardness function of the alloy and on the other ensure that, if a high proportion of tin is present, a<br>
coherent network of tin is prevented from forming, which would be highly susceptible to dis-<br>
rupting the matrix structure and hence the structural strength. The strengthening of the alumin-<br>
ium matrix is, however, largely dependent on the morphology of these inter-metallic phases.<br>
Since in the case of annealing to produce spheroids, such as used as a means of minimising the<br>
friction effect of aluminium alloys containing hard particles of silicon for example, disadvan-<br>
tages can be anticipated with regard to precipitation and compacting of the tin, elements such as<br>
antimony, for example, are added to the alloy in order to reduce the scoring effect of the hard<br>
particles.<br>
As a result of the special combination of elements in the matrix alloy, in which the content of<br>
aluminide formers which are not readily soluble is reduced to a minimum, elements can be intro-<br>
duced to strengthen the matrix, which will be less restricted in terms of dissolving in the alu-<br>
minium matrix. It is possible to act on the tensions at the boundary surface of the Sn by adding<br>
elements from the group consisting of Pb, Bi, Sb and In and the wettability of the aluminium and<br>
hence the aluminium matrix as a whole can be acted on by adding elements from the group con-<br>
sisting of Mg, Zn, Li so that when the aluminium matrix hardens, the tin cannot precipitate on<br>
the grain boundaries of the matrix as a coherent network. Interrupting the network structure of<br>
the tin phase therefore causes a change in the pattern structure and advantageously increases the<br>
structural strength of the alloy and hence the bearing element, additionally improving formabil-<br>
ity.<br>
In this connection, it has proved to be of particular advantage to use Al-Sc alloys for multi-<br>
layered materials 1 of this type, which means that it is also possible to use new. higher-strength<br>
bearing materials for the intermediate layers 5, whose properties can be matched to the mechani-<br>
cal properties of the anti-friction layer 4 and the base shell 7, for example.<br>
In order to produce the desired effect, the elements, predominantly soluble in tin or predomi-<br>
nantly soluble in aluminium, are incorporated in the alloy in a quantity dependant on the tin or<br>
aluminium content, which is determined by the maximum solubility of the individual elements at<br>
eutectic temperature. The proportion of the respective element from the group of elements con-<br>
taining Sb and In in addition to Pb and Bi should be between 10% and 75% of the maximum<br>
solubility of the respective element in the total tin content, but the total proportion of this ele-<br>
ment group should be at least 50% and at most 350% of the maximum solubility of the element<br>
group that is at least soluble in tin. The proportion of the respective element from the group of<br>
elements containing Li in addition to Mg and Zn should be between 6% and 50% of the maxi-<br>
mum solubility of the respective element in the total aluminium content but the total proportion<br>
of this element group should be at least 25% and at most 150% of the maximum solubility of the<br>
group element that is at least soluble in aluminium.<br>
The specified upper and lower threshold values for the proportions of elements relative to the tin<br>
or aluminium content represent the limits within which the change in the tensions of the bound-<br>
ary surfaces will prevent tin from forming a coherent network structure without any fear of a det-<br>
rimental inter-reaction with the elements of the matrix alloy. In this connection, however, it<br>
should be borne in mind that a proportion of element above the maximum solubility may also<br>
actually be of use in the context of the specified limits because these elements in fact already<br>
start to act on the smelt as it gradually hardens.<br>
In order to demonstrate the advantages of the Al-Sc bearing alloy as compared with a conven-<br>
tional friction bearing material, a standard friction bearing material containing 20% by weight of<br>
tin, 0.9% by weight of copper and the rest being aluminium with the usual impurities of an alu-<br>
minium alloy will be compared with the composition given above.<br>
However, this does not mean that friction bearing materials containing 20% by weight of Sn,<br>
0.9% by weight of Cu and the remainder being Al can not be used in the multi-layered materials<br>
1 proposed by the invention. The point is merely intended to demonstrate that Al-Sn bearing al-<br>
loys containing spheroid-type particles in the Sn-soft metal phase can exhibit higher strengths,<br>
bringing the added advantage of increasing the strength of the intermediate layer 5. Clearly,<br>
bearing materials of a "mean value" may be used for the anti-friction layer 4 as necessary, par-<br>
ticularly if the demands on the anti-friction layer 4 are not very high, in which case it would be<br>
more appropriate to use bearing materials of this type for reasons of cost, for example.<br>
The two alloys to be tested were cast under the same conditions in a horizontal continuous cast-<br>
ing process to produce a strip 100 mm wide and 10 mm high. The heat was dispersed during the<br>
hardening process in both cases on the basis of the selected dispersion conditions of between 3.4<br>
J/s to 3.7 J/s. Since the highest possible overall deformation can be produced without interrup-<br>
tion by intermediate annealing of bearing materials made from an aluminium alloy to produce<br>
advantageous mechanical and tribological properties, the deformability of the two alloys was<br>
tested. To this end, the known friction bearing material was subjected to a heat treatment at<br>
350°C for a period of 3 hours. This annealing process produces a stronger globulisation of the tin<br>
particles. The alloy proposed by the invention was tested without heat treatment at a temperature<br>
of 350°C over a period of 3 and 19 hours. In order to conduct these tests, the casting skin was<br>
removed from the samples, both of the known aluminium alloy and that proposed by the inven-<br>
tion, by milling. The sample cross section was then respectively 80 x 8 mm2. Permissible roll<br>
reductions without intermediate annealing were defined with these samples.<br>
Initial macroscopic tears had already started to occur at a reduction of just over 30% in the<br>
known friction bearing material. At a deformation of up to 45%, these rapidly spreading tears<br>
soon caused the sample to be totally destroyed. From the hardness measurements taken on the<br>
rolled surface after each pass, it was observed that after reaching a maximum hardness, the hard-<br>
ness started to drop as a result of damage to the pattern structure from pass to pass. The material<br>
proposed by the invention, on the other hand, exhibited an increased hardness from one pass to<br>
the next.<br>
From the behaviour described above, it can therefore be concluded that the structural properties,<br>
in particular strength, had improved significantly. In the sample over-aged by heating, macro-<br>
scopic tearing was not perceptible until a total deformation of over 55%. In the sample which had<br>
not been heat-treated, such tearing did not occur until after an overall deformation of more than<br>
60% and was not observed in the sample that had been subjected to 3 hours of heat treatment un-<br>
til after a total deformation of 70%. By contrast with the known friction bearing material, these<br>
tears did not cause the samples to tear through altogether.<br>
The aluminium alloy in the cast state after cooling was found to have a Vickers hardness of 42<br>
HV2 in and transversely to the casting direction. After plating the steel of the base shell 7 with<br>
the anti-friction layer 4 using rolls rated for a 45% pass and a temperature treatment at 350° for 3<br>
hours, the hardness was found to be 52 HV2 in and transversely to the casting direction. After<br>
plating on steel by means of rolls and an annealing treatment at 300°C to 400°C for two to five<br>
hours, preferably at 350°C for three hours, the hardness of the aluminium alloy in and trans-<br>
versely to the rolling direction should be at least 20% higher in each case than it is transversely to<br>
the casting direction in the cast state. Furthermore, the hardness in and transversely to the rolling<br>
direction should be at a value of 48 HV2 to 88 HV2, preferably 50 HV2 to 54 HV2. After plating<br>
with the anti-friction layer by rolling with at least a 40% pass in at most two passes or at least a<br>
25% pass in at most one pass followed by heat treatment at 300°C to 400°C for two to five hours,<br>
preferably 350°C for three hours, the hardness in and transversely to the rolling direction should<br>
be at least 175 HV2. From these measurements, it can therefore be concluded that the aluminium<br>
alloy proposed by the invention has the advantageous property of being strengthened by forming,<br>
in particular by rolls, and hence also for use in high-speed motors. This is also attributable to the<br>
fact that alloys with an aluminium base as proposed by the invention have a sufficiently high<br>
content of soft phases so that aluminium matrix alloys of this type overall have tribological prop-<br>
erties, which satisfy the desired requirement of allowing increasingly longer periods between<br>
maintenance. The content of soft phases means that damage to bearing and shaft caused by ex-<br>
tensively soiled lubricant entraining solid particles caused by friction is avoided.<br>
However, another advantageous property of this aluminium alloy and the bearing materials in<br>
which it is used is the fact that it subsequently hardens, e.g. in motors, because of the temperature<br>
load during operation, which, as is known, can only be avoided to a limited extent by lubricant.<br>
As a result, the finely distributed non-bonded tin particles can coalesce to form larger particles as<br>
a result of multiple temperature changes - tin is known to have a melting point of 232°C, a tem-<br>
perature rapidly reached by shafts during operation - and be precipitated.<br>
Again, this demonstrates the advantage of using Al-Sc alloys with their good mechanical proper-<br>
ties, whereby, for example, the hardness of the intermediate layer 5 can advantageously be<br>
adapted to the hardness of the anti-friction layer 4 so that Al-Sc alloys of this type can also be<br>
used for higher-strength bearing materials.<br>
Multi-layered materials 1 proposed by the invention can also be made from any method known in<br>
the state of the art. For example, the aluminium alloy for the intermediate layer 5 and/or the alu-<br>
minium alloy for the anti-friction layer 4 can be made using a continuous casting process and the<br>
blanks made to a predeterminable thickness. In order to make the individual layers for the multi-<br>
layered material 1, these blanks can be rolled to a predetermined thickness, for example. The<br>
rolling process may be effected in several steps, the thickness of the blank being reduced by ap-<br>
proximately 10% to 70% with each pass, and this process is repeated until the layers are of the<br>
required wall thickness.<br>
However, it would also be possible, particularly when producing the multi-layered material 1<br>
proposed by the invention, to operate the rolling process in such a way that two or more different<br>
and/or identical layers are placed one on top of the other, the rolling and plating process produc-<br>
ing a solid join between the individual layers. For example, the surface 11 of the Al alloy for the<br>
anti-friction layer 4 on the Al-alloy for the intermediate layer 5, in other words an Al-Sc alloy<br>
and the surface of the anti-friction layer 4 lying opposite the surface 11, may be covered, for ex-<br>
ample with a pure aluminium sheet. This latter approach prevents soft phases, which generally<br>
have a melting temperature below or close to the annealing temperature, from escaping from the<br>
aluminium matrix of the bearing alloy, which would then be lost during subsequent annealing of<br>
the resultant layered joint. In order to impart the mechanical strength needed for use in a friction<br>
bearing 2, an additional step may be incorporated in which the base shell 7, for example steel, is<br>
applied to the joined unit by another rolling process, thereby producing a bond. After another<br>
subsequent heat treatment of the resultant multi-layered material 1 now comprising three layers<br>
for example, the final shape is imparted thereto in a die, to produce the half-shell illustrated in<br>
Fig. 1, for example. The aluminium layer used to prevent the tin from escaping can then be re-<br>
moved from the anti-friction layer, for example by boring. Final finishing processes such as<br>
breaking off the edges, forming the groove 8, etc., can then follow.<br>
However, it would also be possible to temper the Al-based alloy or joining material after each<br>
overall forming of at least 25% and at most 91 % in one or more forming steps at a temperature in<br>
the range of between 85°C and 445°C, preferably between 150°C and 400°C.<br>
Furthermore, it would be possible to operate a plating process in a rolling mill to reduce the<br>
thickness of the multi-layered material and the respective intermediate products within a range of<br>
between 20% and 75% with each pass, preferably between 25% and 50%.<br>
In addition to the known methods, however, a series of other processes could be used, such as the<br>
CVD process (Chemical Vapour Deposition), various vacuum coating techniques such as vapour<br>
deposition, ion plating, cathode sputtering, galvanic techniques, dipping processes without cur-<br>
rent, spray coating methods, etc.. Laser techniques might also be used, for example.<br>
In all the methods used, the base shell 7 and/or the intermediate layer 5 and/or the anti-friction<br>
layer 4 may be selected as the initial material that will then be plated or coated.<br>
It goes without saying that any specific intermediate steps which might be needed can be incor-<br>
porated, such as de-greasing the surfaces, for example with solvents.<br>
As already mentioned, the individual layers, in particular the Al alloys, may be subjected to a<br>
heat treatment during the manufacturing process, especially after a roll reducing process, in order<br>
to release tension induced by deformation. For example, the intermediate layer 5 may be sub-<br>
jected to a heat treatment for 0.5 to 48 hours at a temperature from 85°C to 445°C, in which case<br>
the value of the hardness of the intermediate layer 5 after this heat treatment will advantageously<br>
be no more than 35% below the hardness value exhibited by the intermediate layer 5 prior to<br>
massive forming, e.g. by rolling, smelting, die pressing or similar. The hardness value for this<br>
intermediate layer 5 after massive forming may be in the range of between 70% and 80% of the<br>
hardness value prior to massive forming, for example, in which case a heat treatment will be ap-<br>
plied for 1 to 24 hours at a temperature in the range of between 100°C and 350°C.<br>
The thickness of the individual layers may be between 0.3 mm and 0.6 mm, preferably 0.4 mm to<br>
0.5 mm in the case of the anti-friction layer 4, for example, in the range of between 0.05 mm and<br>
0.2 mm, preferably 0.1 mm and 0.18 mm in the case of the intermediate layer 5, and between 0.8<br>
mm and 1.8 mm, preferably between 1.0 mm and 1.5 mm in the case of the base shell 7. Clearly,<br>
the individual thicknesses of the layers are given by way of illustration only since the overall<br>
thickness of the multi-layered material I may be adjusted to suit any specific application, which<br>
means that the thicknesses of the individual layers may also be adjusted accordingly.<br>
After plating, the hardness of the anti-friction layer 4 may be in the region of between 30.0 HV2<br>
and 110 HV2, preferably between 45.0 HV2 and 85 HV2, and after heat treatment in the range of<br>
between 25.0 HV2 and 85.0 HV2, preferably between 40.0 HV2 and 75. HV2,that of the inter-<br>
mediate layer 5 after plating in the range of between 55.0 UMHV20p to 100 UMHV20p, pref-<br>
erably 60 UMHV20p and 85 UMHV20p, and after heat treatment between 45 UMHV20p and 80<br>
UMHV20p, preferably between 55 UMHV20p and 75 UMHV20p, and that of the base shell 7,<br>
made from steel for example, in the range of between 110 HV2 and 260 HV2, preferably be-<br>
tween 150 HV2 and 240 HV2 after plating and, after heat treatment, in the range of between 105<br>
HV2 and 240 HV2, preferably between 145 HV2 and 235 HV2.<br>
By way of comparison, an intermediate layer 5 made from pure aluminium, such as known from<br>
the prior art for example, has a hardness of 45 UMHV20p prior to heat treatment and approxi-<br>
mately 29 UMHV20p after heat treatment, in other words a significantly lower hardness than the<br>
Al-Sc alloy of the intermediate layer 5 proposed by the invention.<br>
The heat treatment used to attain the above-mentioned values is applied for three hours at ap-<br>
proximately 350°C. However, tests conducted at higher temperatures, for example 350°C to<br>
400°C, did not show any significant change in the hardness of the intermediate layer 5, which, as<br>
mentioned earlier, is attributable to the fact that the recrystallisation temperature for Al-Sc alloys<br>
is in the region of approximately 600°C.<br>
As other measurements showed, the hardness of the intermediate layer 5 is at least more or less<br>
identical both in the casting direction and transversely to the casting direction, which is explained<br>
by the finely dispersed distribution of the AhSc crystallite 12 across the entire volume of the Al<br>
alloy.<br>
At this point, it should be reiterated that all the compositions listed for Al alloys are given by way<br>
of example only and there are any number of combinations to choose from. However, this does<br>
not mean that the invention is restricted to these combinations or Al alloys and, on the contrary,<br>
all possible combinations fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 gives a logarithmic scale, with the load in bar plotted on the ordinate and the operating<br>
time in minutes plotted on the abscissa.<br>
It is known that the load on a friction bearing 2, in particular stress due to temperature and/or<br>
pressure, during what is referred to as a run-in phase as well as afterwards will bring about a<br>
change in strength, the strength being dependent on the constituent elements of the alloy. De-<br>
pending on this run-in time and the time taken to reach specific threshold values, no further sig-<br>
nificant changes in strength will occur throughout the service life, which ends when a bearing of<br>
this type becomes unusable due to material fatigue.<br>
The layered structure proposed by the invention and the effect it has on the behaviour of bearings<br>
of this type will be described in more detail below with reference to specific examples of differ-<br>
ent layer structures used for friction bearings 2 of this type.<br>
In all the friction bearings 2 described as examples below, steel is always used for the base layer<br>
6 so that this base layer 6 will no longer be mentioned in examples 1 to 6 below and can be im-<br>
plicitly taken as read. Furthermore, the individual layers in the friction bearings 2 described be-<br>
low are joined to one another so that they can not be displaced.<br>
Example 1: In this friction bearing 2, the anti-friction layer 4 is made from an aluminium alloy<br>
incorporating tin, in particular from AlZn 4.5.<br>
Example 2: In this three-layered friction bearing 2, an intermediate layer 5 of pure aluminium is<br>
used with an anti-friction layer 3 made from an Al-Sn alloy, e.g. AlSn6Cu.<br>
Example 3: This example relates to a friction bearing 2 with an intermediate layer 5 made from<br>
pure aluminium and an anti-friction layer 4 made from an Al-Sn alloy, in particular AISn20Cu.<br>
Example 4: For this friction bearing 2, an intermediate layer made from a CuPb alloy is used,<br>
onto which an anti-friction layer of AlSn20 is applied by sputtering.<br>
Example 5: The friction bearing 2 in this example is an improved version of example 1, but in<br>
this case an AlZn alloy is no longer used for the anti-friction layer 4 but is used instead for the<br>
intermediate layer 5, whilst the anti-friction layer is an AlSn20 alloy. Instead of the AlZn alloy, it<br>
would also be possible to use AlSc alloys proposed by the invention for the intermediate layer 5<br>
in this example.<br>
Example 6: This final example relates to a friction bearing 2 with an intermediate layer 5 as pro-<br>
posed by the invention made from an AlSc alloy. An Al alloy was used the for anti-friction layer<br>
4 which may contain up to 32% by weight of Sn as the main alloying element and which addi-<br>
tionally contains a hard substance selected from at least one element from the group of elements<br>
containing Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Co, Cu, Pt, Mg, Sb, W, Nb, V, Ag, Mo or Zr. The hard substance may<br>
be an inter-metallic phase, e.g. by forming aluminide in the boundary regions of the matrix so<br>
that the tin network resulting from the high tin content can be interrupted. By preference, the<br>
hard substance is spherical or cuboid. For example, in addition to Al with its inherent impurities,<br>
the alloy may contain 22.1 % by weight of Sn, 1.44% by weight of Cu, 0.47% by weight of Mn,<br>
0.24% by weight of Fe, 0.08% by weight of Cr and 0.5% by weight of Mg.<br>
In order to test the bearing service behaviour of a friction bearing 2 and classify it into categories<br>
of use, service behaviour for bearing purposes can be tested and monitored using predefined test<br>
methods. In order to simulate changes in stress, a shaft rotating at a predefined rotation speed for<br>
the cylinder size used, likely to causes stress to the bearing housing, can be operated at a hydrau-<br>
lic pressure of 75 bar. Once the maximum bearing load is reached, the test is continued until the<br>
bearing becomes so damaged due to compression of the anti-friction layer 4 or burring in the re-<br>
gion of the anti-friction and intermediate layers 4, 5 or due to friction, that it has to be replaced.<br>
Details incorporated in the definition as to the point from which this damage is so severe that the<br>
bearing can no longer be used are established prior to every individual test series.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates service behaviour in a bearing application of the embodiments of the individual<br>
friction bearings 2 given as examples 1 to 6 above.<br>
As may be seen from the graph, showing for example a simple bearing structure of a type de-<br>
scribed in example 1, known from the prior art, this type of friction bearing 2 fails even before<br>
reaching maximum load denoted by time 14 - as shown in the graph - due to friction at the bear-<br>
ing point.<br>
Better service behaviour is already in evidence in the case of another embodiment of a friction<br>
bearing, also known from the prior art, having a triple-layered structure, in which the base shell 7<br>
is made from steel, the intermediate layer 5 from pure aluminium and the anti-friction layer 4<br>
from Al alloys incorporating tin - as detailed in examples 2 and 3.<br>
Whilst the aluminium alloy with a lower tin content described in example 2 also fails even before<br>
reaching maximum load at time 15, the more highly alloyed Al remains resistant over a longer<br>
period of maximum load up to a time 16 before the bearing is crushed or up to a time 17 when<br>
the bearing is worn.<br>
As known from the prior art, very high service periods for bearings can be achieved with a bear-<br>
ing structure as outlined in example 4, since a friction bearing 2 of this type does not fail until<br>
after a period of approximately 10,000 minutes, in other words at time 18. Bearings of this type<br>
which proved capable of a long service life in this comparative test are also referred to as "passed<br>
components".<br>
Example 5 illustrates the effect which the material used for the intermediate layer 5 has on the<br>
properties of a friction bearing 2. Whilst a friction bearing 2 with an intermediate layer 5 of an<br>
AlZn alloy has already failed by time 19, service life can be significantly increased if this AlZn<br>
intermediate layer is replaced by an intermediate layer 5 made from an AlSc alloy as proposed by<br>
the invention. This is illustrated by times 20, 21 in Fig. 3, which denote the point at which the<br>
friction bearing 2 breaks or fails.<br>
Finally, the times 22, 23 show the test results for a friction bearing 2 in which the intermediate<br>
layer 5 is made from an improved AlSc alloy proposed by the invention on the one hand and an<br>
AlSn alloy with a high tin content is used for the anti-friction layer 4 on the other. In comparison<br>
with the anti-friction layer 4 of example 5, however, the tin network which forms as a result of<br>
the high proportion of tin in this high-strength AlSn alloy is interrupted by hard substances and<br>
the problematic effect which these hard substances would normally have due to shearing forces<br>
can be overcome if this hard substance is spherical or cuboid in shape.<br>
The upshot of this observation is that, on the one hand, by using an intermediate layer as pro-<br>
posed by the invention with an AlSc base, a friction bearing 2 can be produced whose properties,<br>
in particular due to the combination of the intermediate layer 5 proposed by the invention with a<br>
high-strength anti-friction layer 4, are such that a long service life can be achieved, totally com-<br>
parable with what are known as "high-tech" friction bearings 2 made using a sputtering tech-<br>
nique, and, on the other that friction bearings 2 with a sustained service life can be produced<br>
more cheaply if an intermediate layer 5 as proposed by the invention is used.<br>
For the sake of good order, it should finally be pointed out that in order to provide a clearer un-<br>
derstanding of the structure of the multi-layered material 1 and the intermediate layer 5, they and<br>
their constituent parts have been illustrated out of scale to a certain extent and/or on an enlarged<br>
and/or reduced scale.<br>
The tasks underlying the independent inventive solutions can be found in the description.<br>
Above all, subject matter of the individual embodiments illustrated in Figs. 1; 2: 3 can be con-<br>
strued as independent solutions proposed by the invention. The related tasks and solutions can be<br>
found in the detailed descriptions of these drawings.<br><br>
