				<td>A CUTTING INSERT FOR ROTATING CUTTING TOOLS<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a cutting insert for rotating cutting tools of the type intended<br>
for chip-breaking metal machining, said tools comprising a part with a seat opening<br>
radially outwards for accommodating the cutting insert, the cutting insert being<br>
delimited by a top side, adjacent to which there is/are one or more cutting edges, an<br>
opposed bottom side and one or more relief surfaces extending between the top side and<br>
the bottom side, and the cutting insert being arranged to be fixed into the seat by means<br>
of a clamping element that may be pressed against its top side, a female recess and/or a<br>
male means being formed in the bottom side for co-operation with a suitable male<br>
means and/or a female recess in said tool part.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the technology of chip-breaking metal machining by means of rotating cutting tools,<br>
there is a trend in development aimed at making it possible to run the tools at very high<br>
speeds of rotation, more specifically in order to reduce to a minimum the time required<br>
for different machining operations. Thus, in professional circles one reckons on running,<br>
e.g., milling cutters, bores and the like, at speeds of rotation up to the range of 20 000 to<br>
30 000 rpm. In modern cutting tools as means of machining, one uses replaceable<br>
cutting inserts made of extremely hard and wear-resistant materials, such as cemented<br>
carbide, ceramics or other compositions, e.g., with inclusions of diamond and cubic<br>
bore nitride. In for instance milling tools, such cutting inserts are often held in place by<br>
clamping elements, primarily wedges, instead of by means of screws. In the cases when<br>
the cutting insert is mounted into seats opening radially outwards (i.e., when using<br>
square shoulder facemills or facemills), then the cutting inserts represent a latent<br>
security risk, whenever the tool is run at a high rotation speed, in that the centrifugal<br>
force then becomes large.<br>
Objects and Features of the Invention<br>
The present invention aims at removing the above mentioned security risk and creating<br>
a cutting insert which in a reliable way is withheld in the appurtenant seat, even if the<br>
same under extreme conditions would tend to move radially outwards relative to the<br>
seat and the clamping element. A further object is to create a cutting insert that may be<br>
made of hard and sometimes brittle materials without running the risk of fracture if the<br>
same would be submitted to not only large centrifugal forces, but also large straining<br>
forces from the clamping element. It is also an object to create a cutting insert of a<br>
simple geometrical shape that makes possible a rational production by means of<br>
conventional production methods.<br>
According to the present invention, the above objects are achieved by means of the<br>
features that are defined in the characterizing clause of claim 1. Advantageous<br>
embodiments of the invention are further defined in the dependent claims.<br>
Brief Elucidation of Prior Art<br>
In US-A-5 658 101a milling tool is disclosed that is suitable for the machining of wood<br>
or similar materials, which tool comprises a number of thin regrindable steel blades<br>
provided with cutting edges, which blades are clamped between on the one hand a<br>
support plate and on the other hand a clamping element in the form of a pressing plate<br>
that is pressable against the blade by means of a screw. In the blade with the cutting<br>
edge is provided a through-hole, in which is accommodated a male means in the form of<br>
a short tap, coupled with the support plate. However, in that case the hole is a through<br>
hole; something that would weaken a cutting insert intended for metal machining in an<br>
unacceptable way, said insert in practice being of the type that on the one hand is<br>
relatively small, and on the other hand is made of materials that are considerably less<br>
tough than steel.<br>
US 4 396 315 discloses a cutting insert which on a top side turned towards a clamping<br>
wedge completely lacks any depression and which on a bottom side presents a conically<br>
shaped recess for receiving a fixing screw which is arranged to be tightened until it<br>
reaches the bottom of the conical recess. The purpose of this fixing screw is to position<br>
the cutting insert even after repeated grinding of the edges of the cutting insert. As a<br>
result of the screw being screwed down into the recess, the screw in its operative<br>
condition will not be smaller on all sides than the recess as the present invention<br>
stipulates.<br>
US 5 558 142 discloses a cutting insert which in a topside has a depression which co-<br>
operates with a protrusion on a clamping wedge. This recess does not, however, have a<br>
V-shaped cross-sectional shape. Nor is the protrusion wedge-shaped in order to co-<br>
operate with a slanting flange surface in the manner stipulated by the present invention.<br>
Brief Description of the Appended Drawings<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective exploded view showing a part of a milling tool, more<br>
specifically of a square shoulder facemill, in which are included a number of<br>
cartridges and the appurtenant cutting inserts, which are made according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of an individual cutting insert according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 is a planar top view of the cutting insert according to Fig. 2,<br>
Fig. 4 is a planar view from underneath of the same cutting insert,<br>
Fig. 5 is a partial, schematic side view showing a cartridge, a cutting insert and a<br>
clamping wedge in a first stage of function,<br><br>
Fig. 6 is a side view corresponding to Fig. 5 showing the same components in a<br>
second stage of function, and<br>
Fig. 7 is a third side view showing a third stage of function.<br>
Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br><br>
In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 designates in general a milling cutter body that is<br>
rotatable around a central geometrical axis (not shown), more precisely in the direction<br>
of the arrow A. Recesses 3 opening radially outwards, for the accommodation of a<br>
cartridge 4, two clamping wedges 5, 5a and a cutting insert 6, according to the invention<br>
are provided in an envelope surface 2. The two clamping wedges 5, 5a cooperate with<br>
screws 7 which have double threads, of which one is tightenable in a hole 8 in the<br>
bottom of the recess 3 and the other in a threaded through hole 9 in the clamping wedge.<br>
The cartridge 4 has serrations 10, which engage, with corresponding serrations 10a in a<br>
trailing wall of the individual recess. A seat 11 for accommodating the cutting insert 6 is<br>
to be found on the leading side of the cartridge. The only purpose of the clamping<br>
wedge 5a is the clamping of the cartridge 4, while the clamping wedge 5 has the double<br>
purposes of on the one hand contributing to the clamping of the cartridge, and on the<br>
other hand also of clamping the cutting insert 6 into the seat 11.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2 to 4, where it can be seen that the cutting insert 6 is<br>
delimited by a topside 12, a bottom side 13 and one or several relief surfaces 14<br>
adjacent to edges or cutting edges 15.<br>
According to the invention, a first depression in the shape of a groove 16 with a V-<br>
shaped cross-sectional is provided in the top side 12 of the cutting insert, which groove<br>
according to the example extends between opposed ends of the cutting insert. However,<br>
it is also feasible to form the depression with a length that is smaller than the length of<br>
the cutting insert, the depression in its entirety being surrounded by the planar top side<br>
or surface 12. The groove 16 is delimited by two planar flange surfaces 17, 17'.<br>
According to the example shown, the angle between these flange surfaces is 164°. In<br>
practice, this angle may vary, but it should lie within the range of 160 to 170°. It should<br>
also be noted that the groove 16 extends at a certain, restricted angle to the edges or<br>
cutting edges 15. According to the example, the oblique angle between the groove 16<br>
and the edges 15 amounts to about 4,5°. However, this angle may vary upwards as well<br>
as downwards, the maximum value of the oblique angle amounting to 45°.<br>
A female recess 18 ends in the bottom surface 13 of the cutting insert, which recess<br>
advaritageously has the basic shape of a frustum of a cone. When the cutting insert is<br>
installed in the seat 11, a male means 19 engages into the recess 18. Also the male<br>
means 19 may advantageously have the shape of a frustum of a cone, although the male<br>
means is smaller than the recess on all sides. In other words, the male means has a<br>
smaller diameter and a smaller height than the recess 18. Therefore, under normal<br>
conditions, a free gap is created between the external surfaces of the male means and the<br>
internal surfaces of the recess 18. The recess 18 has a depth that as such may vary, but<br>
that in practice should not exceed half the thickness of the cutting insert.<br>
In Fig. 5 to 7 three different stages of function for the clamping wedge 5 that has the<br>
function of clamping the cutting insert 6 are shown. As may be seen in all figures, the<br>
clamping wedge 5 has a protrusion 20 with a wedge-shaped cross-section the function<br>
of which is to cooperate with the cutting insert.<br>
In Fig. 5 the clamping wedge 5 is shown in an outer end position, in which it lacks<br>
contact with the cartridge 4 as well as the cutting insert 6. In Fig. 6 is shown how the<br>
clamping wedge has been pulled in a bit into the recess 3 by means of the screw 7. At<br>
this stage, the cartridge 4 is clamped, but not the cutting insert 6, in that the protrusion<br>
20 may freely pass at a distance from the flange surface 17 of the groove 16. In Fig. 7<br>
the clamping wedge 5 is shown in a finally tightened stage, in which the protrusion 20<br>
has come into contact with and been pressed against the flange surface 17'. At this<br>
stage, the cutting insert is fixed into the seat 11 of the cartridge. Thereby, mechanical<br>
male/female joints are created on the two opposed sides of the cutting insert. Thus, the<br>
protrusion 20 forms a male means that engages into the female depression or groove 16<br>
in the topside of the cutting insert. At the same time, the male means 19 engages into<br>
the recess 18 in the bottom side of the cutting insert. However, since the male means 19<br>
is smaller than the recess 18, an air gap 21 is formed between the external surfaces of<br>
the male means and the internal surfaces of the recess. This implies that, under normal<br>
conditions, the male means is not in active, mechanical engagement with the recess and,<br>
therefore, does not influence the possibility of the cutting insert to exactly fit into the<br>
seat. Only if the cutting insert under extreme conditions should be exposed to such large<br>
centrifugal forces, that it would tend to move radially outwards relative to the clamping<br>
wedge and the cartridge, the male means will come in contact with the inside of the<br>
recess and hinder the cutting insert from being flung out radially from the seat.<br>
Feasible Modifications of the Invention<br>
The invention is not restricted solely to the embodiment as described above and shown<br>
in the drawings. Thus, the seat for the cutting insert may be located on other parts of a<br>
rotatable cutting tool than specifically in a cartridge of the type as exemplified in the<br>
drawings. Furthermore, the cutting insert and the appurtenant seat may be used for other<br>
rotatable cutting tools than just milling cutters. Further, other types of clamping<br>
elements than just clamping wedges may also be used for fixing the cutting insert into<br>
the appurtenant seat. Within the framework of the invention, it is also feasible to use a<br>
male means that may engage into a larger female recess in the cartridge or the tool part,<br>
instead of a female recess in the bottom side of the cutting insert. It is even feasible to<br>
shape the bottom side of the cutting insert with on the one hand a female recess, and on<br>
the other hand a male means, for engagement with a male means and a female recess,<br>
respectively, in the tool part.<br>
