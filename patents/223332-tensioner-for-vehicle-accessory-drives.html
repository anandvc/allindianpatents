THE GATES CORPORATION, a corporation organised under the laws of the State of Delaware, of 900 South Broadway, Denver, Colorado 80209, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
GRANTED<br><br>

WO 01/79727<br>
Title Tensioner<br>
Field of the Invention The invention relates to tensioners, more particularly to tensioners that are spring biased, wedge actuated belt tensioning devices having damping and used with belts for vehicle accessory .drives.<br>
Background of .the Invention<br>
Most engines used for automobiles and the like include a number of belt driven accessory systems which are necessary for the proper operation of the vehicle. , The accessory systems may include an alternator, air conditioner compressor and a power steering pump.<br>
The accessory systems are generally mounted on a front surface of the engine. Each accessory would have a pulley mounted on a shaft for receiving power from some form of belt drive. In early systems, each accessory was driven by a separate belt that ran between the accessory and the crankshaft. With improvements in belt technology, single serpentine belts are now used in most applications. Accessories are driven by a single serpentine belt routed among the various accessory components. The serpentine belt is driven by the engine crankshaft.<br>
Since the serpentine belt must be routed to .all accessories, it has generally become longer than its predecessors. To operate properly, the belt is installed with a pre-determined tension. As it operates, it stretches slightly. This results in a decrease in belt tension, which may cause the belt to slip.   Consequently, a belt<br><br>
I<br>
W0 01/79727<br>
tensioner is used to maintain the proper belt tension' as "the belt stretches during use.<br>
As a belt tensioner operates, the running belt may excite oscillations in the tensioner spring. These oscillations are undesirable, as they cause premature wear of the belt and tensioner. Therefore, a damping mechanism is added to the tensioner to damp the oscillations.<br>
Various damping mechanisms have been developed. They include viscous fluid based dampers, mechanisms based on frictional surfaces sliding or interaction with each other, and dampers using a series of interacting springs.<br>
Representative of the art is US patent no. 4,402,677(1983) to Radocaj which discloses a tensioner having an L-shaped housing. A pair of cam plates having camming surfaces are slideably mounted in the L-shaped housing. A compression spring biases the camming plates into sliding engagement with each other. The included angle of the camming surfaces equal 90° with the angle of a first camming surface being greater than the angle of a second camming surface.<br>
Also representative of the art is U.S. patent no. 5,951,423(1999) to Simpson which discloses a mechanical friction tensioner having spring loaded wedge-shaped blocks and friction damping. The tensioner has a wedge-shaped piston that interacts with spring biased wedge-shaped blocks. As the piston moves inward the wedge-shaped blocks are pushed outward to provide friction damping.<br>
The prior art devices rely on springs or other components, each oriented on axes that are set at a pre¬determined angle to each other. They also rely on a plurality  of  springs  to  properly  operate  the  damping<br><br>
WO 01/79727<br>
components and to urge the belt pulley into contact with a belt. The prior art does not teach a damping components that operate coaxially. Further, the prior art does not teach use of an expandable camming body. Nor does it teach the use of an expandable camming body that expands radially. Nor does it teach the use of an expandable camming body that expands radially in response to movement against a piston. Nor does" it teach the use of an expandable camming body that expands radially in response to movement against a tapered piston.<br>
What is needed is a tensioner having a coaxial piston and camming body operating coaxially. What is needed is a tensioner having an expandable camming body. What is -needed is a tensioner having an expandable camming body that is radially expandable. What is needed is a tensioner having an expandable camming body that is radially expandable in response to movement against a piston. What is needed is a tensioner having an expandable camming body that expands radially in response to movement against a tapered piston. The present invention meets these needs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The primary aspect of the invention is to provide a tensioner having a coaxial tapered piston and camming body.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a tensioner having an expandable camming bociy.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a tensioner having an expandable camming body that is radially expandable.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a tensioner  having  an  expandable  camming  body  that  is<br><br>
WO 01/79727<br>
radially expandable  in response  to movement against a 'piston.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide a linear tensioner having an expandable camming body that expands radially in response to movement against a tapered piston.<br>
Other aspects of the invention will be pointed out or made obvious by the following description of the invention and the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention comprises a self-contained mechanical belt tensioner that produces damping which is a function of applied hubload through the effect of frictional forces derived from the sliding action of mutually opposing wedges. A conical piston is contained within a housing. The conical piston cooperates with a conical wedge or camming body. The conical wedge slides on the inner surface of the housing. The conical wedge is radially expandable in a direction normal to the housing. A spring urges the conical wedge into engagement with the conical piston. As the pulley is loaded, as with an impulse load, the piston will move into the conical wedge. This, in turn, will cause the conical wedge to radially expand against the inner surface of the housing. The expansion of the conical wedge in the housing will increase the frictional force between the conical wedge and the housing. This will have the effect of damping movements of the wedge and conical piston. The greater the impulse, then the greater the expansion of the conical wedge. Hence, this increases the resultant frictional force resisting movement between the conical wedge and the housing. As the load moves toward a minimum, the camming body radially contracts and the frictional force is abated to a low level allowing ease of retraction of the piston.<br><br>

WO 01/79727<br>
Compressible member or spring 6 bears on wedge 13. "Wedge or camming body 13 comprises a tapered or conical hole 15. Wedge outer surface 16 is slidingly engaged with housing inner surface 17. Wedge outer surface 16 may comprise a nonmetallic material, such as plastic or phenolic. Piston 14 comprises a cylindrical shape. End 19 of piston 14 has a tapered or frustoconical shape that cooperates with hole 15 in wedge 13. End 20 of piston 14 opposite the conical end cooperates with bearing point 18. Bearing point 18 allows pivot arm 3 to press upon the end 20 of piston 14 without undue binding.<br>
Fig. 2(a) is a top plan view of the wedge through section 2a-2a in Fig. 3. Wedge or camming body 13 comprises slots 40, 41. Slots 40 project from an outer surface of the wedge toward the hole 15. Slots 41 project from hole 15 toward an outer surface of the wedge. Slots 40, 41 allow wedge 13 to radially expand and contract, shown as bi-directional arrow E, as the tensioner operates according to the following descriptions. One should note chat although the surface 16 is shown as smooth and of circular shape in this Fig. 2a, surface 16 may have other shapes or profiles as described in the other figures described in this specification.<br>
Fig. 2(b) is a side elevation view of the wedge through section 2b-2b in Fig. 3. Slots 40 extend from a first surface 44 of the wedge and slots 41 extend from an opposing surface 45 of the wedge as compared to the, first surface. Slots 40, 41 further comprise holes 42, 43 respectively, which allow the wedge sides to expand and contract without causing cracking or failure of the wedge at each slot end.<br><br><br>
WD 01/79727<br>
Fig. 3 is a side cross-section view of the damping section of the invention as described in Fig. 1. Movement of the pivot arm 3 drives piston 14 into the wedge 13. Spring 6 biases wedge 13 into piston 14. In operation, piston 14 is driven into wedge 13, thereby expanding wedge 13 against surface 17. The frictional force between wedge surface 16 and surface 17 damps the motion of the wedge and thereby the motion of the piston 14. Note that although surface 17 is shown as cylindrical in this Fig. 3, surface<br>
17	may have other shapes or profiles as shown in the other<br>
figures described in this specification.<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the. wedge. Camming body or wedge 13 comprises surface 16 that slidingly engages inner surface 17 of housing 1. Wedge 13, and more particularly, surface 16 may have a pleated or star shape. This shape serves to increase the frictional forces, between surface 16 and inner surface 17. Inner surface 17 and surface 16 may have any shape, so long as they are able to be properly mated to maximize surface contact between them and are able to slide relative to each other along a common axis, A, without binding.<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the piston 14. Piston 14 comprises tapered end 19 and end 20. Tapered end 19 cooperates with tapered hole 15'in wedge 13.  Bearing point<br>
18	bears upon end 20. Although surface 16 is star shaped,<br>
tapered end 19 and tapered hole 20 each have a conical or<br>
frustoconcical shape. In the preferred embodiment, piston<br>
14 comprises steel, although any durable material having<br>
similar frictional and compressive properties would be<br>
acceptable.<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view of the housing 1. Housing  1  comprises  inner surface  17.    Inner surface<br><br>
WO 01/79727<br>
describes a pleated or star profile in order to cooperate with surface 16 of wedge 13. In the preferred embodiment, housing 1 is constructed of aluminum, although any durable material having similar frictional and strength bearing properties would be acceptable. Housing 1 may b attached to a base (not shown) as part of a tensioner assembly as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The operation of the tensioner is as follows. Reference is made to Fig. 7(a), a schematic free body diagram of the damping mechanism during a compression stroke. During the compression stroke, the hubload HC bears upon piston 14, which acts upon wedge 14, shown as R. The movement of the tapered end 19 into hole 15 causes an outer circumference of wedge 13 to increase and press surface 16 against the inner surface 17. Due to friction between the sides of the tapered end 19 and the sides of the tapered hole 15, movement of piston 14 in direction C acts to move wedge 13 also in direction C. However, the movement of wedge 13 in direction C is resisted by spring 6, the spring force being depicted as F5. A normal force is formed between the sides of the tapered end 19 and the sides of the tapered hole 15, and is resolved into normal forces between them, Nic and N2c A frictional force acts between the sides of the tapered end 19 and the sides of the tapered hole 15 as well as between the sides of the wedge and the inner surface of the housing. A frictional force resisting the motion of the wedge in the housing is formed. These forces are uN1c and uN2c. This force is additive with the spring force, Fs, as each acts in the same direction. As the hubload increases, so increases HC. An increase in HC increases N1c and N2C until wedge 13 starts<br><br>
WD 01/79727<br>
moving, which in turn increases the friction forces uN1c and pN2c resisting movement of the wedge in the housing. It should be noted that there is no further substantive increase in N1C and N2c when wedge 13 moves.<br>
On the return stroke, depicted in Fig. 7(b) a free body diagram of the damping mechanism during the return stroke, the hubload is diminished.   Once the hubload HR becomes less than the spring force Fs minus friction uN1R, the wedge will be pushed in direction B, The normal forces, N1R and N2R are less than Nlc and N20  Further, the friction force vector is in the opposite direction as compared to the compression stroke, uN1R and UN2R. This frictional force resists the effort of the spring to move the wedge in direction B.  The hubload HR required to keep the blocks in static  equilibrium is  reduced.   Since the hubload is reduced, the frictional forces between the wedge and the inner surface of the housing are correspondingly reduced. Hence, the damping, or frictional force, is greater during the compression  stroke  than during  the  return stroke. Therefore, the tensioner exhibits asymmetric damping.<br>
An alternate embodiment is depicted in Fig. 8. Damper 100 comprises a cylinder slidingly engaged with another cylinder. Outer tube or housing 101 slidingly engages tube 108. Cap 105 is attached to tube 101. Cap 110 is attached to tube 108. Spring 102 extends between cap 105 and end of tube 108, thereby urging the tubes apart. Plastic liner 106 facilitates movement between outer tube 101 and tube 108. Piston 111 is affixed to cap 110 and is parallel to a major axis of the tubes 101, 108. Wedge 109 slidingly engages an inner surface 112 of tube 108. Piston tapered end 104 engages tapered hole 113 in wedge 109.  Wedge 109<br><br>
WO 01/79727<br>
is urged into contact with piston 111 by spring 107. Biasing member or spring 107 bears upon cap 110 and wedge 109. Cap 110 may be affixed to a mounting surface, such as on a tens'ioner body as described in Fig. 1.<br>
In operation, cap 105 moves in direction C during a compression stroke. It moves in direction R during a return stroke.  The detailed description of operation is set forth in Fig.   1(a)   and  Fig.   7(b).   Further,   during  the compression stroke, the wedge 109 is pushed in direction C, thereby causing behavior as described in Fig. 7(b) for the return stroke.   The damping force in is increased during the return stroke in direction R since the inner surface 112 is moving in a manner so as to press wedge 109 into the tapered end 119 of piston 104. This is described in Fig. 7(a).   One skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanism described  in  this  Fig.  8 depicts  a damping mechanism  that  is  operable  in  various  applications including a belt tensioner with a pulley.<br>
Fig. 9 is a detail of the wedge in Fig. 8. Wedge 109 comprises splines or pleats 114. Splines 114 cooperatively engage a like shape on the inner surface 112 of tube 101 as shown in Fig. 10. Wedge 109 may have radially extending slots 115 that facilitate expansion of the wedge against the inner surface 112. Wedge splines 114 may comprise a nonmetallic material, such as plastic or phenolic.<br>
Fig. 10 is an end view of the outer tube. Tube 101 comprises inner surface 112. Surface 112 describes a pleated or splined profile that cooperatively engages splines 114 on wedge 104. Surface 112 and splines 114 each comprise materials that create a desired frictional coefficient. For example, the splines 114 may comprise a plastic,  phenolic or non-metallic material while surface<br><br><br>
WO 01/79727<br>
may comprise like materials.   The preferred embodiment comprises a non-metallic material on splines 114 and a metallic material on surface 112, as well as surface 112 (Fig. 10), surface 212 (Fig. 11, 18), surface 312 (Fig. 20) .<br>
Fig.  11  is  a  cross-sectional  view  of  a  second alternate embodiment of the invention. In this alternate embodiment, spring 202  is  contained within tube 201. Damper 200 comprises a cylinder slidingly engaged within another cylinder.  Outer tube 201 slidingly engages tube 208.  Cap 205 is attached to tube 208. Cap 210 is attached to tube 201.  Biasing member or spring 202 extends between tube 208 and cap 210, thereby urging them apart.  Plastic liner 206 facilitates sliding movement between outer tube 201 and tube 208.  One end of piston 211 is affixed to cap 210 and is parallel to a major axis of the tubes 201, 208.  Wedge 209 slidingly engages an inner surface 212 of tube 208. Piston tapered end 204 engages tapered hole 213 in wedge 209.   Wedge  209  is  urged against tapered end 204  by compressible member or spring 207.  Spring 207 bears upon cap 210 and wedge 209. Cap 210 is affixed to a mounting surface, such as on a tensioner body as described in Fig. 1.  One  skilled  in  the art will  appreciate  that  the mechanism described in this Fig.  11 depicts a damping mechanism that is   operable on other applications including a tensioner with a pulley.<br>
In operation, cap 205 moves in direction C during a compression stroke. Cap 205 moves in direction R during a return stroke. The detailed description of operation is set forth in Fig.'s 7(a), 7(b) and Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 12 depicts another alternate embodiment of the damper 300.   The elements are generally as described in<br><br><br>
f<br>
WO 01/79727<br>
Fig. 11 with the following differences; washer, ring or bearing surface 308 is affixed to piston 211 at a pre¬determined point. Bearing surface 308 extends normally to the piston axis D. Compressible member or spring 307 bears on the bearing surface 308, The other end of spring 307 bears on camming body or wedge 309. Wedge 309 is of substantially the same form as wedge 209 in Fig. 11. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanism described in this. Fig. 12 depicts a damping mechanism that is operable on other applications including a tensioner with a pulley.<br>
Reference to Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 also illustrates the change in length L1 and L2 as the invention operates. Lengths increase during the return stroke R {L2) and decrease during the compression stroke C (L1) .<br>
Fig. 13 is a cross-sectional view along axis A~A of yet another alternate embodiment of the invention. First housing or cap 405 comprises first housing surface or side 408. Second housing or tube 401 further comprises outer surface 4 12. Side 408 describes a conical form having an angle a to the major axis A in the range of 0° to 30°. Side 408 may have any form required by a user, including pleated. Wedge 409 slides between side 408 and outer surface 4 12. Spring 402 urges wedge 409 into contact with side 408 and outer surface .412. As wedge 409 is urged against surface 412, it is radially compressed. Radial compression of wedge 409 occurs due to the presence of the slots as described in Fig. 2 and Fig. 21. Spring 402 bears on base 4 10, which is affixed to tube 410. Cap 405 moves in direction C during a compression stroke and in direction R during a return stroke. A load L may be applied to the<br><br><br>

Side 508 describes a conical form having an angle p to the. major axis A in the range of 0° to 30°. Side 508 may have any profile required by a user including pleated.  Wedge 509 slides between first housing surface or side 508 and outer surface 516 of piston 514. Wedge 509 has the same form as shown in Fig. 21 for wedge 409. Body 519 and surfaces 516 have the same form as shown in Fig. 21 for surface 412.  Spring 502 bears on end 510 and piston 514. Spring  502  resists  an  axial  movement  of  piston  514. Compressible member or spring 502 also bears on base 510 against piston 514. Compressible member or spring 507 urges wedge 509 into contact with side 508 and outer surface 516 of piston 514. As wedge 509 is urged against surface 516, it is radially compressed.  Radial compression of wedge 509 occurs due to the presence of the slots as described in Fig. 2 and Fig. 21. Piston 514 moves in direction C during a compression stroke and in direction R during a return stroke. An axial load L may.be applied to the device at bearing point 518. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanism described in Fig. 14 depicts a damping mechanism that is operable on other applications including a tensioner with a pulley.<br>
