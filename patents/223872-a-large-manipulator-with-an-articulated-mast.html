				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a device for actuating an articulated<br>
mast, which is preferably linked to a mast base rotatable on a<br>
chassis about a vertical axes and which includes at least<br>
three mast arms, which are limitedly pivotable relative to the<br>
mast base about parallel horizontal articulation axis or an<br>
adjacent mast arm by means of respectively one drive unit,<br>
with a control device for actuation of the drive units for<br>
movement of the mast, which includes, preferably in chassis-<br>
referenced or mast-referenced coordinate system, a coordinate<br>
transformer responsive to given guiding parameters and<br>
measured angular values determined by means of angle sensors<br>
located on the mast arms for translation into articulation<br>
movement signals relevant for the drive units in accordance<br>
with a pre-determined path/slew characteristic.<br>
Devices of this type are employed for example in large<br>
manipulators, particularly for concrete pumps. This type of<br>
Targe manipulator is manipulated by an operator, who is<br>
responsible, via a remote control device, both for the control<br>
of the pump as well as for the positioning of a terminal hose<br>
provided at the tip of the articulated mast. The operator<br>
must control multiple rotational degrees of freedom of the<br>
articulated mast via the associated drive units for movement<br>
of the articulated mast in the non-structured three<br>
dimensional work space, taking into consideration the<br>
construction site boundary conditions or constraints. The<br>
control of the individual axis does have the advantage that<br>
the individual mast arms can be brought respectively<br>
individually into any desired position, limited only by their<br>
pivot range. Each axis of the articulated mast or the mast<br>
base is assigned in this case a main adjustment direction of<br>
the remote control elements of the remote control device, so<br>
that in the case of the presence of three or more mast arms<br>
the operation becomes unmanageable. The operator must<br>
continuously keep an eye on both the actuated axes as well as<br>
the end hose, in order to avoid a risk of uncontrolled<br>
movement of the end hose and therewith an endangerment of the<br>
construction site personnel.<br>
In order to simplify manipulation in this respect, a control<br>
device has already been proposed (DE-A-4306127), in which the<br>
redundant articulation axis of the articulated mast, in each<br>
rotation position of the mast base independent of the rotation<br>
axis thereof, are controlled conjunctively with one single<br>
control movement of the control element. Therein the<br>
articulated mast carries out an extension and retraction<br>
movement overseeable by the operator, wherein the elevation of<br>
the mast tip is maintained constant. In order to make this<br>
possible, this control device includes a computer supported<br>
coordinate transformer for the drive units controllable via<br>
the remote control element, via which in the one main<br>
adjustment direction of the remote control element the drive<br>
units of the articulated axes are controllable independent of<br>
the drive unit of the rotation axes of the mast base with<br>
carrying out of an extension and retraction movement of the<br>
articulated mast with predetermined height of the mast tip.<br>
In another main adjustment direction or main positioning<br>
direction the drive units of the articulated axes are<br>
controllable independent of the drive units of the rotation<br>
axis with carrying out of a raising and lowering movement of<br>
the mast tip. For optimization of the movement sequence<br>
during the extension or retraction process it is there<br>
considered to be important that the drive units of the<br>
redundant articulated axes of the articulated mast are<br>
respectively controllable in accordance with a path/slew<br>
characteristic. Included therein is that the path/slew<br>
characteristic in the coordinate transformer is modified due<br>
to the influence of bending or torsional moments acting on the<br>
individual mast arms.<br>
In order to detect the movement sequences in the articulated<br>
mast, angular sensors are provided on the mast arms for<br>
determining the articulation angle. The individual angle<br>
sensors respectively measure only the articulation angle<br>
between two mast arms of one articulation axis. This type of<br>
angular measurement is robust, since the system is relatively<br>
stiff in the axis area and since the angle sensor provides the<br>
actual articulation angle with great precision. The axis<br>
associated measurement value is independent of the measurement<br>
values at the other axes. Thereby, one obtains a relatively<br>
simple mathematical relationship between the articulation<br>
angles on the one hand and the instantaneous position of the<br>
end hose on the other hand. One refers to this as a<br>
coordinate transformation between the articulation axis-<br>
associated angle coordinates and the chassis-based cylinder<br>
coordinates, in which the end hose of the device is being<br>
moved.<br>
The articulation axis related angular measurement value is<br>
also independent of the bending of the individual mast arms<br>
due to the loads acting thereon. The bending must<br>
supplementally be mathematically taken into consideration.<br>
For this, one must first determine the mass of the individual<br>
arm parts and therein, in particular, filling of the<br>
associated distribution pipes with concrete. The bending is<br>
then input purely mathematically into the coordinate<br>
transformation. This is considered disadvantageous.<br>
On the other hand, it has been found advantageous, in the<br>
dynamic respect, that the articulation axis related angular<br>
measurements do not contain any information components<br>
regarding the swivel condition itself, so that, with regard to<br>
the angular measurements, a dynamic decoupling occurs. The<br>
relatively stable axis angles thus make possible an error<br>
magnitude feedback relying on supplemental information<br>
regarding the swivel condition in the individual axes, for<br>
example, the dynamic pressure progression in associated<br>
control cylinders. Therewith, an effective oscillation<br>
damping is made possible (see DE-A-10046546).<br>
The known device, in which the mast arm angle is measured in<br>
an articulation axis referenced chassis-based coordinate<br>
system, has the following disadvantages:<br>
a) The assembly of the angle sensors in the area of the<br>
articulation axes is laborious, since the design provides<br>
for many components to already be located in the area of<br>
the axis, which interfere with the attachment of the<br>
angle sensor.<br>
b) The weight of the axis-associated angle sensor inclusive<br>
of cabling is approximately 50 Kg per axis, which is<br>
relatively high.<br>
c) With the articulation axis associated angle sensors only<br>
the articulation axes are measured, and this without<br>
taking into consideration the bending of the individual<br>
mast arms. For the bending due to the torsional moments,<br>
with and without filling of the distribution pipes with<br>
concrete, a supplemental mathematical model is necessary,<br>
which can introduce errors.<br>
Beginning therewith it is the task of the invention to develop<br>
a device for controlling an articulated mast, in particular<br>
for large scale manipulators, for which the measuring devices<br>
(sensors), securing components and cabling exhibit a lower<br>
weight and are mountable in simple manner, and with which it<br>
is also possible to detect and use, in the control technology,<br>
information detectable by the measurement technology regarding<br>
the bending of the mast arms and the dynamics of the system.<br>
For solving this task the combination of characteristics set<br>
forth in Claims 1 and 11 are proposed. Advantageous<br>
embodiments and further developments of the invention can be<br>
found in the dependent claims.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the invention<br>
geodetic angle sensors are inelastically provided on the mast<br>
arms, preferably away from the articulation axes, for<br>
determination of the individual mast arm associated<br>
geographically referenced angular measurement values. In<br>
order to also be able to take into consideration in the<br>
coordinate transformation a non-horizontal orientation of the<br>
mast base and the chassis which carries this, it is<br>
advantageous to provide at least one geodetic angle sensor on<br>
the mast base and/or on the chassis for measuring a<br>
geographically referenced or fixed angular measurement value<br>
associated with the mast base and/or the chassis.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
geodetic angle sensors are tilt angle sensors sensitive to the .<br>
gravitation of the earth.<br>
The geographically referenced or referenced angular<br>
measurement values determined with the inventive geodetic<br>
angle sensors can be evaluated or utilized in various manners<br>
in the inventive control device:<br>
a) Statically the individual articulation angles can be<br>
calculated or worked out therefrom. Having the<br>
articulation angles, then the relationship to the chassis<br>
fixed cylinder coordinates can be produced. The<br>
conventional coordinate transformation determines, from<br>
the articulation angles, the orientation of the<br>
individual mast arms in space, and from this, the<br>
instantaneous position of the end hose in the radial<br>
direction and the height above the substrate.<br>
b) The inventive geodetic angle measurement values of the<br>
mast arms can also be converted directly, without the<br>
detour over the articulation angles, into the cylinder<br>
coordinates of the end hose.<br>
c) In both cases a) and b) the static deformation effects<br>
due to the load or torsional moments are already<br>
contained in the measurement values. Even a setup tilt<br>
attributable to a deformation in the substrate or<br>
undercarriage is already taken into consideration.<br>
d) During opening up and folding together of the articulated<br>
mast the angle positions in the articulation axes<br>
according to a) must be known, so that the mast arms can<br>
be moved relative to each other free of collision. This<br>
includes also collision with self, namely the collision<br>
between the individual mast arms and their add-on<br>
components.<br>
In order to make all of this possible it is proposed in<br>
accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
that the coordinate transformer includes a software routine<br>
for conversion of geographically referenced or fixed mast arm<br>
related angle measurement values into articulation angles. In<br>
addition, the coordinate transformer should include a software<br>
routine for conversion of the guidance parameters into<br>
guidance articulation angles in the chassis fixed cylinder<br>
coordinate system in accordance with a predetermined path/slew<br>
characteristic of the articulated mast.<br>
In the use of geodetic angle sensors on the mast arms the<br>
inclination or tilting of the preceding arms and their changes<br>
act directly on the angle measurement values of the subsequent<br>
arms. Thus in the case of the first mast arm is changed in<br>
its angle of inclination, then also the inclination of the<br>
following mast arms change by a corresponding amount. This is<br>
to be taken into consideration not only in the stationary<br>
condition, but rather also in dynamic inclination changes.<br>
Weight effects or inertial effects, which appear in the case<br>
of these changes, distribute themselves dynamically upon the<br>
individual mast arms. During the coordinate transformation it<br>
must be distinguished whether the tilt angle change is<br>
attributable to the measurement arm itself or to a preceding<br>
mast arm. This leads to the allocation problem: For each<br>
measured angular change at the individual mast arms it must be<br>
determined which change component concerns which mast arm.<br>
For this, a mathematical model is necessary, which brings<br>
about a decoupling of the geodetic angle measurements in the<br>
individual mast arms. According to the invention, for this a<br>
dynamic decoupling of the signals, converted to the<br>
articulation axes referenced angular coordinates, is carried<br>
out. For this there is provided, in accordance with the<br>
invention, a software routine responsive to the dynamic angle<br>
measurement values for their apportionment into low frequency<br>
and high frequency angle measurement components. Further, in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a<br>
group of articulation axis referenced control comparisons are<br>
provided, which are acted upon by the stationary or low<br>
frequency components of the articulation angle as actual or<br>
instantaneous values and with the guidance articulation angle<br>
as set or desired value and which, on the output side, are<br>
connected with the articulation axes referenced guidance<br>
parameter controller for controlling the drive units of the<br>
concerned articulation axes.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention a<br>
group of articulation axis referenced disturbance amplitude<br>
controllers is provided, which are acted upon with the<br>
articulation axis related high frequency components of the<br>
dynamic angle measurement values and which are connected to<br>
the signal inputs of the associated drive units of the<br>
articulated axes with formation of an error value circuit<br>
input. In this case, preceding the error value controller,<br>
there can be a software routine responsive to the/ dynamic<br>
geographic-based angle measurement value and the summed high<br>
frequency component of the articulation angle for determining<br>
the high frequency component of the individual articulation<br>
angle.<br>
The presently described disassembly or deconstruction of the<br>
dynamic angle measurement values leads thereto, that various<br>
control signals are assigned to different categories, and are<br>
evaluated in different control circuits: A guide value<br>
controller, which influences the guide relationship or<br>
behavior input by the operator and an error value controller,<br>
which influences the oscillation behavior. The two control<br>
groups are acted upon with the instantaneous value components<br>
from this disassembly. The set or desired values of the<br>
guidance value controller are produced from the incoming data,<br>
for example, of a joy stick, thus from the input of the<br>
operator, with supplemental taking into consideration a preset<br>
path/slew characteristic, while the sub-divided out error or<br>
interference values are controlled via the error or<br>
interference value controller for the purpose of controlling<br>
the oscillation dampening to zero. The guidance behavior<br>
includes, in accordance with the invention, supplementally the<br>
static deformation of the mast arms and the setp-up tilt of<br>
the chassis or base frame.<br>
A second alternative solution is comprised therein, that on<br>
the mast arms respectively one satellite supported GPS-module<br>
(Global Positioning System) is provided inelastically for<br>
determining of the individual mast arm associated<br>
geographically referenced position measurement values, wherein<br>
the coordinate transformer can be acted upon with the position<br>
measurement values of the GPS modules. Preferably there is<br>
provided a mast base associated GPS-module and, in certain<br>
cases, at least one chassis associated GPS-module for<br>
determining of the mast base and/or the chassis associated<br>
geographically referenced position measurement values. The<br>
geographically referenced mast arm related position<br>
measurement values are preferably transformed or converted<br>
with the aid of a software routine of the coordinate<br>
transformer into articulation angles. Preferably the<br>
coordinate transformer additionally includes a software<br>
routine for conversion of the guidance values, in accordance<br>
with a predetermined path/slew characteristic of the<br>
articulation mast, into chassis fixed guidance articulation<br>
angles. When the position measurement values also include<br>
dynamic position information with sufficiently high frequency,<br>
it is advantageous to provide a software routine responsive to<br>
the dynamic position measurement values for their division<br>
into low frequency and high frequency position measurement<br>
value components. In this case it is advantageous when a<br>
group of control comparers is provided, which are acted upon<br>
with the stationary or low frequency components of the<br>
articulation angle as instantaneous value and the guidance<br>
articulation angles as set or desired values and are connected<br>
on the output side with an articulation axes referenced<br>
guidance value controller for controlling the drive units of<br>
the concerned articulation axes. The guidance value or<br>
magnitude controllers ensure that the inputs or commands of<br>
the operator, for example, with the aid of a joystick, are<br>
converted into the desired retraction or extension movement of<br>
the articulated mast. For oscillation damping there can also<br>
be supplementally provided a group of articulation axes<br>
referenced error amplitude or interference magnitude<br>
controllers, which can be acted upon with the articulation<br>
axes referenced high frequency component of the dynamic angle<br>
measurement values, and which are connected to the signal<br>
inputs of the associated drive units of the articulated axes<br>
with formation of an error magnitude circuit input. The error<br>
magnitude controllers are preferably preceded by a software<br>
routine responsive to the dynamic geographically referenced<br>
position measurement values and the summed high frequency<br>
component of the articulation angle, for determining the<br>
articulation axes referenced high frequency component of the<br>
articulation angle.<br>
In the following the invention will be described in greater<br>
detail on the basis of an illustrative embodiment shown in<br>
schematic manner in the figures. There is shown:<br>

associated articulated mast;<br>

articulated mast in the work position;<br>

(geographically referenced) angle measurement value<br>
into articulation axes based angle measurement<br>
values;<br>
Fig. 4 a schematic of a device for control or operation of<br>
the articulated mast.<br>
The mobile concrete pump 10 includes a vehicle chassis "11, a<br>
thick matter pump 12 which may be, for example, a two cylinder<br>
piston pump, as well as a concrete distribution mast 14 as<br>
carrier for a concrete conveyance conduit 16. Liquid<br>
concrete, which is continuously introduced into a receptacle<br>
container 17 during concretizing, is conveyed via the concrete<br>
conveyance conduit 16 to a concretizing location 18 at a<br>
distance from the location of the vehicle 11. The<br>
distribution mast 14 is comprised of a mast base 21 rotatable<br>
about the vertical axis 13 via a hydraulic rotation drive 19<br>
and an articulation mast 22 pivotable thereon, which is<br>
continuously adjustable to different reach and height<br>
differentials between the vehicle 11 and the concretizing<br>
location 18. The articulated mast 22 is comprised in the<br>
illustrated example of five mast arms 23 to 27 connected<br>
articulated with each other, which are pivotable about axes 28<br>
through 32 running parallel to each other and at right angles<br>
to the vertical axis 13 of the mast base 21. The articulation<br>
angles a1 through a5 (Fig. 2) of the articulation linkages<br>
formed by the articulation axes 28 through 32 and their<br>
arrangement or disposition relative to each other are so<br>
coordinated relative to each other, that the distribution mast<br>
can be folded into the multiply folded room saving transport<br>
configuration on the vehicle 11 as seen in Fig. 1. By the<br>
activation of the drive units 34 through 38, which are<br>
associated with the individual articulation axes 28 through<br>
32, the articulated mast 22 can be unfolded into various<br>
distances r and/or height differentials h between the location<br>
to be concreted 18 and the vehicle location (Fig. 2).<br>
The operator controls the movement of the mast using a<br>
wireless remote control device 50, via which the mast tip 33<br>
with the end hose 42 is moved over the area to be supplied<br>
with concrete. The end hose 42 has a typical length of 3 to 4<br>
m and can, due to its articulated hanging in the area of the<br>
mast tip 33 and on the basis of its inherent flexibility, be<br>
held by a hose man with its output end in a desired position<br>
relative to the location to be supplied with concrete 18.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 2, a geodetic angle sensor 44 through<br>
48 is rigidly (inelastically) provided on each mast arm 23<br>
through 27 for determining the individual mast arm associated<br>
geographic referenced angle measurement values ev (see Fig. 3).<br>
A further geodetic angle sensor 49 is located on the mast base<br>
21. Therewith the tilt of the chassis vertical axis 13<br>
relative to the vertical, and therewith the also the tilt of<br>
the vehicle chassis relative to the substrate, can be<br>
measured. The angle sensors 44 through 48 will replace the<br>
articulation axes based angle sensors provided in the<br>
conventional articulated mast control device.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, in the stationary condition the<br>
articulation axes based articulation angles ev / can be<br>
calculated from the geographically referenced angles ev of the<br>
mast arms determined by the geodetic angle sensors 44 through<br>
48 as follows:<br>
when v &gt; 1<br>
and<br>
a1 = e1 when v = 1,<br>
wherein the setup tilt angle is assumed to be zero. The<br>
geodetic angle sensors 44 through 49 preferably provide tilt<br>
angle signals responsive to the gravity to the earth. Since<br>
the angle sensors are provided on the mast arms 23 through 27<br>
outside of the articulation axes 28 through 32, their<br>
measurement values include additional information components<br>
regarding the bending of the mast system and the dynamic<br>
oscillation condition. Further contained in the measurement<br>
values is also information regarding the setup tilt and the<br>
deformation in the base frame or body, which can be separated<br>
using a supplemental measurement cite 49 on the mast base or<br>
the chassis.<br>
The remote control device 50 includes in the embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 4 at least one remote control element 60 in the form a<br>
control lever, which can be moved back and forth in three main<br>
directions with output of control signals 62. The control<br>
signals 62 are transmitted over a radio path 64 to a vehicle<br>
mounted radio receiver 66, which is connected on the output<br>
side via a, for example, CAN-Bus type Bus system 68, to a<br>
microcontroller 70. The microcontroller 70 contains software<br>
modules 74, 76, 78, 80 via which the control signals 62<br>
(?, r,h) received from the remote control device 50 and the<br>
measurement signals 82 (ev) received from the geodetic angle<br>
sensors 44 through 48 are interpreted, transformed and, via an<br>
operating command or steering value controller 84, an error<br>
value controller 86 and a downstream signal provider 88, are<br>
converted into actuation or operation signals (Dav) for the<br>
drive units 34 through 38 (actuators) of the articulation axes<br>
28 through 32.<br>
In the shown illustrative embodiment the output signals of the<br>
remote control element 60 are interpreted into the three main<br>
servo or control directions "advance/retract tilting" for<br>
adjusting the radius r of the mast tip 33 from the rotation<br>
axis 13 of the mast base, "right/left tiling" for controlling<br>
the rotation axes 13 of the mast base 21 about the angle ? and<br>
"right/left rotation" for adjusting the height h of the mast<br>
tip 33 above the location to be supplied with concrete 18.<br>
The deflection of the remote control element 60 in the<br>
respective directions is converted in a not shown<br>
interpretation routine into a speed signal, wherein a boundary<br>
value data ensures that the movement speed of the axes and the<br>
acceleration thereof does not exceed a preset maximal value<br>
(see DE-A-10060077).<br>
The software module 74 labeled "transformation routine" has<br>
the task of transforming, in predetermined time clock pulses,<br>
the incoming control signals (desired values), interpreted as<br>
cylinder coordinates ?,r,h, into angle signals ?srasv for the<br>
rotation and articulation axes 13, 28 through 32. Each<br>
articulation axes 28 through 32 is so controlled by software<br>
within the transformation routine 74 with utilization of a<br>
predetermined path/slew characteristic, that the articulation<br>
linkages, depending upon the path and time, move harmonically<br>
relative to each other. The control of the redundant degrees<br>
of freedom of the articulation linkages occurs therewith<br>
according to a preprogram strategy via which it is also<br>
possible to eliminate the possibility of a self-collision with<br>
adjacent mast arms 23 through 27 during the sequence of<br>
movement.<br>
The geodetic angle sensors 44 through 48 measure, in a<br>
predetermined clock cycle, the instantaneous geographically<br>
referenced angle ev and transmit the measurement value over the<br>
bus system 68 to the microcontroller 74. The measurement<br>
values ev are converted in the software module 76 into the<br>
articulation angle instantaneous values aiV. The time<br>
dependent articulation angles are then distributed or<br>
subdivided in the software module 78, labeled "filter<br>
routine", into low frequency (quasi stationary) articulation<br>
angles aivN and into a high frequency summed articulation angle<br>
signal aH. The low frequency axes associated articulation<br>
angle instantaneous values aiVN are compared in the control<br>
comparator 90 with the set or desired values asv and used via<br>
the guidance value controller 84 and the signal provider 88<br>
for controlling the valves or magnitudes going to the drive<br>
units 34 through 38. The high frequency summed component aH<br>
is converted, using the geographically referenced mast related<br>
angle measurement value ev, in a software module 80 labeled as<br>
"correlation routine", into high frequency articulation axes<br>
related interference or error magnitude signals aH, which via<br>
a control comparer 92 and the error value controller 86 are<br>
supplied to the signal provider 88 in the sense of an error<br>
value circuit entry, and thereby are adjusted to zero.<br>
It is basically possible, in place of the geodetic angle<br>
sensors, to also provide satellite controlled GPS-position<br>
sensors on the mast arms. The therewith measured position<br>
values as instantaneous values can be converted by suitable<br>
transformation routines 76 into articulation angles and in<br>
like manner be evaluated as the geographically referenced<br>
angle measurement values with the microcontroller 70.<br>
In summary the following can be concluded: The invention<br>
relates to a device for actuating an articulated mast<br>
particularly for large manipulators and concrete pumps. Said<br>
articulated mast 22 is pivotally connected to a mast base 21<br>
that is rotatable about a vertical axis and comprises at least<br>
three mast arms 23 to 27 which are pivotable to a limited<br>
extent about horizontal articulated axis 28 to 32 that are<br>
located parallel to each other, the pivoting movement being<br>
relative to the mast base 21 or an adjacent mast arm 23 to 27<br>
and being performed by means of a respective drive unit 34 to<br>
38. The inventive device further comprises a control unit for<br>
actuating the drive units for the mast movement. The control<br>
unit is provided with coordinate transformer 74, 76 which<br>
responds to a given guiding parameter r and measured angular<br>
values eg that are determined by means of angle sensors 44 to<br>
48 located on the mast arms 23 to 27. The coordinate<br>
transformer 74, 76 does a conversion into movement signals Dav<br>
for the drive units 34 to 38 in accordance with predefined<br>
path/slew characteristics, said movement signals being related<br>
to the articulation axis. In order to make the inventive<br>
device lighter and easier to build, geodetic angle sensor 44<br>
to 48 which determine geostationary measured angular values eg<br>
that are assigned to the individual mast arms 23 to 27 are<br>
disposed in a rigid manner on the mast arms 23 to 27.<br>
