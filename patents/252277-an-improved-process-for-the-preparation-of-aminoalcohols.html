				<td>An improved process for the preparation of aminoalcohols<br>
Field of present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for opening of diverse epoxides by amine using a Zirconium compound as catalysts in the presence or absence of a solvent at an appropriate temperature to give 2-aminoalcohols. In case of unsymmetrical epoxides, the ratio of regioisomeric product obtained can be altered by an appropriate selection of zirconium (IV) compound as a catalyst, solvent and/or reaction temperature.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
2-Aminoalcohols are well known in the art as a class of cardiovascular agents in the<br>
treatment of hypertension e.g., propranolol. The most general method for the synthesis of<br>
2-aminoalcohols involves reaction of epoxide and amine. The reaction is generally<br>
carried out at high temperature, under high pressure or under the influence of a catalyst.<br>
Various synthetic methods are known where epoxide-opening reaction by amines<br>
constitutes a key step.<br>
Most of the methodologies involve unsymmetrical epoxide i.e. different substitutions on<br>
two carbons constituting the epoxide ring. The reaction leads to the formation of two<br>
regioisomers. Nucleophilic opening of epoxide in regioselective fashion is a key issue in<br>
these transformations. In the synthesis of propranolol,  1-naphthyl glycidyl ether is<br>
reacted with 2-propyl amine.<br>
Various processes are known for opening of epoxides by amines.<br>
Opening of the epoxide ring takes place on heating the epoxide with amine at high<br>
temperature.<br>
Posner et al (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977, 99, 8208-8214) described an investigation for<br>
epoxide opening with amines using alumina. Alumina works well with aliphatic amines.<br>
However, large excess of reagent and alumina is required for completion of reaction and<br>
hence the process is not useful for large-scale synthesis.<br>
Crotti et al (Tet. Lett. 1990, 31, 4661-4664) described an investigation for epoxide<br>
opening with  amines  using  various  salts  such  as  lithium  perchlorate,  magnesium<br>
perchlorate, lithium tetrafluoroborate etc. The report describes lithium perchlorate to be<br>
the best candidate among these salts. With LiClO4, the reaction works for aliphatic,<br>
^enzylic and aromatic amines. For reaction of benzylamine, using lithium perchlorate for<br>
2 h, the ratio of compounds 3 and 4 (see figure 1) is 60:40. The major disadvantage of<br>
this protocol is the use of stoichiometric amounts of lithium perchlorate. The strong<br>
oxidizing properties and the potential explosion hazourds of perchlorates are also notable<br>
drawbacks of this methodology.<br>
Auge et al (Tet. Lett. 1996, 7715-7716) described an investigation using LiOTf (lithium<br>
trifluoromethanesulphonate) for aminolysis of epoxides. The reaction of styrene oxide<br>
with benzylamine carried out in acetonitrile for 3.5 h gave 83% yield with regioisomers<br>
in the ratio of 60:40 selectivity. The use of large amounts (0.5 equivalent) of the costly<br>
catalyst is considered to be the notable disadvantage for industrial applications.<br>
Singh et al (J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 287-289) described an investigation using Cu(OTf)2<br>
and Sn(OTf)2. However, the process describes reactions with symmetrical except 1-<br>
dodecene oxide and the issue of regioselectivity remains unanswered. Requirement of<br>
extended reaction time (20 h) and the use of costly and water sensitive catalysts do not<br>
make this invention attractive for industrial applications.<br>
Akamanchi   et   al   (Synthesis   2000,   78-80)   described   a   method   using   DIPAT<br>
(diisopropoxyaluminium trifluoroacetate) in which compound 4 was formed as the only<br>
product at room temperature in 1.5 h. However, DIPAT was used in stoichiometric<br>
amounts, it is moisture sensitive and its preparation involves tedious steps.<br>
Chandrasekar et al (Synthesis 2000, 1817-1818) described an investigation using TaCls.<br>
The reaction was reported for symmetrical epoxides. The reaction time is not mentioned.<br>
Ramarao et al (Synthesis 2001, 831-832) described an investigation using CeC^. The<br>
reaction is carried out for 12 h with 30-mol% of the catalyst. In the reaction of styrene<br>
oxide with aniline, compound 6 (see figure 2) was obtained in 76% yield but the amount<br>
of compound 5 formed is not reported. However, the catalyst works only in case of<br>
aromatic amines.<br>
The zirconium catalysts have been used for epoxide opening reaction with other<br>
nucleophiles are described as under.<br>
Whittaker et al (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1993, 1427-1428) had earlier described a<br>
process where crystalline polymeric zirconium phosphate was used as heterogeneous<br>
catalyst for epoxide opening reaction using methanol and acetic acid.<br>
Curini et al (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2001, 4149-4152) described a process where zirconium<br>
sulfophenyl phosphate is used as heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of P-amino<br>
cohols from epoxides. The reaction of styrene oxide and aniline carried out at 40Â°C for 24 h gives 83% yields of the mixture of products 5 and 6 in the percentage ratio of 88:12. Nugent et al (J. Org. Chem. 1998, 6656-6666) describes a process where the complex [(L*)Zr]2(OH)(02CCF3) in which L* = (+)-(S,S,S) -triisopropanolamine was used for the diastereoselective epoxide opening reaction with trialkylsilyl azide to give 2-azidoalkanol trialkylsilyl ether.<br>
Shibasaki et al (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 1245-1246) described a process in which Zr iPro 4 was used for synthesis of (3-acetoxy alcohols from olefins in presence of bis(trimethylsilyl) peroxide (BTSP) and trimethylsilylacetate. The reaction involves formation of epoxide followed by opening of the epoxide ring. The protocol was extended by Shibasaki et al (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 1256-1257) for synthesis of p-cyano alcohols from olefins using BTSP and trimethylsilylcyanide. The reaction was found to be sluggish and required the use of triphenylphosphine oxide to increase the rate of the reaction.<br>
Thus, the epoxide opening reaction with amine as nucleophile using any zirconium compound as catalyst described in this invention is not known in the prior art. The epoxide opening reaction, when carried out in the presence of strong acids, bases or alkoxides results in less yield of the desired product. In these cases, the major reaction is polymerization, rearrangement, nucloephilic opening etc. leading to undesired by-products. The various byproducts could be characterized as alcohol, aldehyde or ketone and 1,2-diols. Polymerization can occur when the un-reacted epoxide gets activated due to presence of promoter or catalyst and undergoes reaction with another epoxide molecule. Due to the presence of these byproducts, the isolation of the desired product becomes a tedious job.<br>
In order to obviate all the drawbacks existing with the prior art processes, it is necessary to develop an efficient process for the preparation of 2-aminoalcohols. This has been achieved in the present invention by reacting, an epoxide with amine as a nucleophile using Zirconium compound as a catalyst in the absence or presence of a solvent, preferable at an appropriate temperature.<br>
Thus, the epoxide opening reaction with amine as a nucleophile using any zirconium compound as catalyst as described in the present invention is not reported earlier.<br>
that is needed is an efficient and improved procedure for nucleophillic ring opening 01 diversely functionalised epoxides which gives higher yield, reduces formation of alcohol and/or carbonyl compound that are side products obtained from rearrangement of epoxide, and in case of unsymmetrical epoxides, used as a substrate, the choice of reaction parameters such as solvent, catalyst and/or reaction temperature can be altered for obtaining regioselectivity of the required product.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
An objective of the invention is to provide an improved process for epoxide opening reaction by amines in the presence of various zirconium (IV) compounds as a catalyst. Another object of the present invention provides the use of unsymmetrical epoxides where the ratio of regioisomers of the product can be controlled by the selection of zirconium compounds used as a catalyst, solvent and/or reaction temperature. Yet, another objective of the invention provides the use of various solvents to control the ratio of regioisomers in the product.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention provides the use of a solvent for carrying out the reaction is selected from a group consisting of chlorinated solvents such as methylene chloride chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane aprotic polar solvents such as acetonitrile aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene and ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, diisopropylether and tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>
Still another objective of the invention provides temperature in the range of 0Â°C to 150Â°C to perform the reaction.<br>
Still yet another objective of the present invention uses an epoxide is mono-substituted epoxide, a di-substituted epoxide, a tri-substituted epoxide., or a tetra-substituted epoxide.<br>
