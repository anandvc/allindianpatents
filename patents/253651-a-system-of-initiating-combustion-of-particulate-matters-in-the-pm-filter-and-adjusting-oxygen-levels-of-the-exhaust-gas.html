				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to "a system of initiating combustion of<br>
Particulate matters in the PM filter and adjusting oxygen levels of the exhaust gas".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The statements in this section merely provide background information<br>
related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br><br>
[0006] Engines such as diesel engines produce particulate matter (PM)<br>
that is filtered from exhaust gas by a PM filter. The PM filter is disposed in an<br>
exhaust system of the engine. The PM filter reduces emission of PM that is<br>
generated during combustion.<br>
[0007] Over time, the PM filter becomes full. During regeneration, the<br>
PM may be burned within the PM filter. Regeneration may involve heating the<br>
PM filter to a combustion temperature of the PM. There are various ways to<br>
perform regeneration including modifying engine management, using a fuel<br>
burner, using a catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature with after<br>
injection of fuel, using resistive heating coils, and/or using microwave energy.<br>
The resistive heating coils are typically arranged in contact with the PM filter to<br>
allow heating by both conduction and convection.<br>
[0008] Diesel PM combusts when temperatures above a combustion<br>
temperature such as 600 Â°C are attained. The start of combustion causes a<br>
further increase in temperature. While spark-ignited engines typically have low<br>
oxygen levels in the exhaust gas stream, diesel engines have significantly higher<br>
oxygen levels. While the increased oxygen levels make fast regeneration of the<br>
PM filter possible, it may also pose some problems.<br>
[0009] PM reduction systems that use fuel tend to decrease fuel<br>
economy. For example, many fuel-based PM reduction systems decrease fuel<br>
economy by 5%. Electrically heated PM reduction systems reduce fuel economy<br>
by a negligible amount. However, durability of the electrically heated PM<br>
reduction systems has been difficult to achieve.<br><br>
[0010] Face cracks have been an issue with the electrically heated PM<br>
filters. These cracks are created by large thermal expansion forces generated by<br>
the burning soot near a rear endplug region of the PM filter.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011] A system comprises a particulate matter (PM) filter that<br>
comprises an upstream end for receiving exhaust gas, a downstream end and at<br>
least one portion. A control module initiates combustion of PM in the PM filter<br>
using a heater and selectively adjusts oxygen levels of the exhaust gas to adjust<br>
a temperature of combustion adjacent to the at least one portion of the PM filter.<br>
[0012] A method comprises providing a particulate matter (PM) filter<br>
that comprises an upstream end for receiving exhaust gas, a downstream end<br>
and at least one portion; heating the PM filter with a heater; initiating combustion<br>
of PM in the PM filter; selectively adjusting oxygen levels of the exhaust gas to<br>
adjust a temperature of combustion adjacent to the at least one portion of the PM<br>
filter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0027] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0028] The present disclosure relates to zoned and unzoned heaters<br>
for PM filters. The electrical heater may be in contact with or spaced from the PM<br>
filter. The heater selectively heats all or portions of the PM filter. The PM filter<br>
may be in contact with or mounted close enough to the front of the PM filter to<br>
control the heating pattern. The length of the heater may be set to optimize the<br>
exhaust gas temperature.<br>
[0029] Thermal energy is transmitted from the heater to the PM filter.<br>
The PM filter may be heated by convection and/or conduction. The electrical<br>
heater may be divided in zones to reduce electrical power required to heat the<br><br>
PM filter. The zones also heat selected downstream portions within the PM filter.<br>
By heating only the selected portions of the filter, the magnitude of forces in the<br>
substrate is reduced due to thermal expansion. As a result, higher localized soot<br>
temperatures may be used during regeneration without damaging the PM filter.<br>
[0030] The PM filter may be regenerated by selectively heating one or<br>
more of the zones in the front of the PM filter and igniting the soot using the<br>
heated exhaust gas. When a sufficient face temperature is reached, the heater<br>
may be turned off and the burning soot then cascades down the length of the PM<br>
filter channel, which is similar to a burning fuse on a firework.<br>
[0031] In other words, the heater may be activated only long enough to<br>
start the soot ignition and is then shut off. Other regeneration systems typically<br>
use both conduction and convection and maintain power to the heater (at lower<br>
temperatures such as 600 degrees Celsius) throughout the soot burning process.<br>
As a result, these systems tend to use more power than the system proposed in<br>
the present disclaimer.<br>
[0032] The burning soot is the fuel that continues the regeneration.<br>
This process is continued for each heating zone until the PM filter is completely<br>
regenerated.<br>
[0033] The present disclosure uses a control strategy that is designed<br>
to limit thermal stress by reducing the temperature of combustion as the<br>
cascading flamefront nears selected portions of the PM filter. The basic<br>
electrically heated PM filter strategy is to maximize a temperature of a burn zone<br><br>
for robustness and soot removal but limit the temperature in areas that are easily<br>
damaged.<br>
[0034] The rear endplugs on the PM filter are an area where<br>
temperature control may be needed. The present disclosure reduces the<br>
temperature at the rear end plugs of the PM filter by monitoring the position of<br>
the cascading flamefront and using exhaust oxygen control to reduce the<br>
temperature when the burn zone nears the rear endplugs or other selected<br>
components.<br>
[0035] Many techniques could be used to limit the exhaust oxygen<br>
concentration. For example only, temperature control can be achieved by<br>
injecting fuel into a hot catalyst (Post fuel), increasing EGR (Exhaust Gas<br>
Recirculation), and/or throttling the engine.<br>
[0036] The heater zones may be spaced in a manner such that thermal<br>
stress is mitigated between active heaters. Therefore, the overall stress forces<br>
due to heating are smaller and distributed over the volume of the entire<br>
electrically heated PM filter. This approach allows regeneration in larger<br>
segments of the electrically heated PM filter without creating thermal stresses<br>
that damage the electrically heated PM filter.<br>
[0037] A largest temperature gradient tends to occur at edges of the<br>
heaters. Therefore, activating one heater past the localized stress zone of<br>
another heater enables more actively heated regeneration volume without an<br>
increase in overall stress. This tends to improve the regeneration opportunity<br><br>
within a drive cycle and reduces cost and complexity since the system does not<br>
need to regenerate as many zones independently.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary diesel engine system 10<br>
is schematically illustrated in accordance with the present disclosure. It is<br>
appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
that the zone heated particulate filter regeneration system described herein can<br>
be implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate filter.<br>
Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct injection<br>
engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine systems.<br>
For ease of the discussion, the disclosure will be discussed in the context of a<br>
diesel engine system.<br>
[0039] A turbocharged diesel engine system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0040] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, the systems and methods of the<br>
present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders<br>
including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders. It is also<br>
appreciated that the systems and methods of the present disclosure can be<br><br>
implemented in a V-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected into the cylinders<br>
26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites the air/fuel mixture.<br>
Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust exits the cylinders<br>
26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0041] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PM filter) assembly 34 with<br>
an inlet heater 35. The heater 35 may be zoned. Optionally, an EGR valve (not<br>
shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold 22.<br>
The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to drive a<br>
turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the<br>
air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC 32,<br>
through the heater 35 and into the PM filter assembly 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes<br>
the exhaust based on the post combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation<br>
increases the temperature of the exhaust. The PM filter assembly 34 receives<br>
exhaust from the DOC 32 and filters any soot particulates present in the exhaust.<br>
The inlet heater 35 is in contact with or spaced from the PM filter assembly 34<br>
and heats the exhaust to a regeneration temperature as will be described below.<br>
[0042] A control module 44 controls the engine and PM filter<br>
regeneration based on various sensed information. More specifically, the control<br>
module 44 estimates loading of the PM filter assembly 34. When the estimated<br>
loading is at a predetermined level and the exhaust flow rate is within a desired<br>
range, current may be controlled to the PM filter assembly 34 via a power source<br>
46 to initiate the regeneration process. The duration of the regeneration process<br><br>
may be varied based upon the estimated amount of particulate matter within the<br>
PM filter assembly 34.<br>
[0043] Current is applied to the heater 35 during the regeneration<br>
process. More specifically, the energy may heat selected zones of the heater 35<br>
of the PM filter assembly 34 for predetermined periods, respectively. Exhaust<br>
gas passing through the heater 35 is heated by the activated zones. The heated<br>
exhaust gas travels to the downstream filter of PM filter assembly 34 and heats<br>
the filter by convection and/or conduction. The remainder of the regeneration<br>
process is achieved using the heat generated by the heated exhaust passing<br>
through the PM filter.<br>
[0044] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary zoned inlet heater 35 for<br>
the PM filter assembly 34 is shown in further detail. The electrically heated PM<br>
filter assembly 34 is arranged spaced from or in contact with the PM filter<br>
assembly 34. The PM filter assembly 34 includes multiple spaced heater zones<br>
including zone 1 (with sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C), zone 2 (with sub-zones 2A, 2B<br>
and 2C) and zone 3 (with sub-zones 3A, 3B and 3C). The zones 1, 2 and 3 may<br>
be activated during different respective periods.<br>
[0045] As exhaust gas flows through the activated zones of the heater,<br>
regeneration occurs in the corresponding portions of the PM filter that initially<br>
received the heated exhaust gas (e.g. areas downstream from the activated<br>
zones) or downstream areas that are ignited by cascading burning soot. The<br>
corresponding portions of the PM filter that are not downstream from an activated<br>
zone act as stress mitigation zones. For example in FIG. 2, sub-zones 1A, 1B<br><br>
and 1C are activated and sub-zones 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, and 3C act as stress<br>
mitigation zones.<br>
[0046] The corresponding portions of the PM filter downstream from<br>
the active heater sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C thermally expand and contract during<br>
heating and cooling. The stress mitigation sub-zones 2A and 3A, 2B and 3B,<br>
and 2C and 3C mitigate stress caused by the expansion and contraction of the<br>
heater sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C. After zone 1 has completed regeneration,<br>
zone 2 can be activated and zones 1 and 3 act as stress mitigation zones. After<br>
zone 2 has completed regeneration, zone 3 can be activated and zones 1 and 2<br>
act as stress mitigation zones.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 3, another exemplary zoned inlet heater<br>
arrangement is shown. A center portion may be surrounded by a middle zone<br>
including a first circumferential band of zones. The middle portion may be<br>
surrounded by an outer portion including a second circumferential band of zones.<br>
[0048] In this example, the center portion includes zone 1. The first<br>
circumferential band of zones includes zones 2 and 3. The second<br>
circumferential band of zones comprises zones 1, 4 and 5. As with the<br>
embodiment described above, downstream portions from active zones are<br>
regenerated while downstream portions from inactive zones provide stress<br>
mitigation. As can be appreciated, one of the zones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be<br>
activated at a time. Others of the zones remain inactivated.<br>
[0049] Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary resistive heater 200<br>
arranged adjacent to one of the zones (e.g. zone 3) from the first circumferential<br><br>
band of zones in FIG. 3 is shown. The resistive heater 200 may comprise one or<br>
more coils that cover the respective zone to provide sufficient heating.<br>
[0050] Referring now to FIG. 5, the PM filter assembly 34 is shown in<br>
further detail. The PM filter assembly 34 includes a housing 200, a filter 202, and<br>
the zoned heater 35. The filter 202 may include a rear endplug 208. The heater<br>
35 may be arranged between a laminar flow element 210 and a substrate of the<br>
filter 202. An electrical connector 211 may provide current to the zones of the<br>
PM filter assembly 34 as described above.<br>
[0051] As can be appreciated, the heater 35 may be in contact with or<br>
spaced from the filter 202 such that the heating is convection and/or conduction<br>
heating. Insulation 212 may be arranged between the heater 35 and the housing<br>
200. Exhaust gas enters the PM filter assembly 34 from an upstream inlet 214<br>
and is heated by one or more zones of the PM filter assembly 34. The heated<br>
exhaust gas is received by the filter 202.<br>
[0052] Referring now to FIG. 6, heating within the PM filter assembly<br>
34 is shown in further detail. Exhaust gas 250 passes through the heater 35 and<br>
is heated by one or more zones of the heater 35. If spaced from the filter 202,<br>
the heated exhaust gas travels a distance "d" and is then received by the filter<br>
202. The distance "d" may be 1/2" or less. The filter 202 may have a central inlet<br>
240, a channel 242, filter material 244 and an outlet 246 located radially outside<br>
of the inlet. The filter may be catalyzed. The heated exhaust gas causes PM in<br>
the filter to burn, which regenerates the PM filter. The heater 35 transfers heat<br>
by convection and/or conduction to ignite a front portion of the filter 202. When<br><br>
the soot in the front face portions reaches a sufficiently high temperature, the<br>
heater is turned off. Combustion of soot then cascades down a filter channel 254<br>
without requiring power to be maintained to the heater.<br>
[0053] Referring now to FIG. 7, steps for regenerating the PM filter are<br>
shown. In step 300, control begins and proceeds to step 304. If control<br>
determines that regeneration is needed in step 304, control selects one or more<br>
zones in step 308 and activates the heater for the selected zone in step 312. In<br>
step 316, control estimates a heating period sufficient to achieve a minimum filter<br>
face temperature based on at least one of current, voltage, exhaust flow and<br>
exhaust temperature. The minimum face temperature should be sufficient to<br>
start the soot burning and to create a cascade effect. For example only, the<br>
minimum face temperature may be set to 700 degrees Celsius or greater. In an<br>
alternate step 320 to step 316, control estimates current and voltage needed to<br>
achieve minimum filter face temperature based on a predetermined heating<br>
period, exhaust flow and exhaust temperature.<br>
[0054] In step 324, control determines whether the heating period is<br>
up. If step 324 is true, control determines whether additional zones need to be<br>
regenerated in step 326. If step 326 is true, control returns to step 308.<br>
Otherwise control ends.<br>
[0055] In use, the control module determines when the PM filter<br>
requires regeneration. Alternately, regeneration can be performed periodically or<br>
on an event basis. The control module may estimate when the entire PM filter<br>
needs regeneration or when zones within the PM filter need regeneration. When<br><br>
the control module determines that the entire PM filter needs regeneration, the<br>
control module sequentially activates one or more of the zones at a time to<br>
initiate regeneration within the associated downstream portion of the PM filter.<br>
After the zone or zones are regenerated, one or more other zones are activated<br>
while the others are deactivated. This approach continues until all of the zones<br>
have been activated. When the control module determines that one of the zones<br>
needs regeneration, the control module activates the zone corresponding to the<br>
associated downstream portion of the PM filter needing regeneration.<br>
[0056] The present disclosure may substantially reduce the fuel<br>
economy penalty, decrease tailpipe temperatures, and improve system<br>
robustness due to the smaller regeneration time.<br>
[0057] Referring now to FIG. 8, soot thickness is shown as a function<br>
of axial location for various oxygen levels. As can be appreciated, there is a<br>
tradeoff between soot thickness and oxygen levels. As the oxygen level<br>
increases (from 7% to 9% to 11% to 14%), the soot thickness after regeneration<br>
decreases. However, soot levels are reduced greater than 50% more at 9% as<br>
compared to 7%. Likewise, soot levels are reduced greater than 50% more at<br>
11 % as compared to 9%.<br>
[0058] Referring now to FIG. 9, peak temperature is shown as a<br>
function of axial location for various oxygen levels (including 7% to 9% to 11% to<br>
14%). The peak temperature of the different oxygen levels are initially similar.<br>
As the axial location increases, the temperatures diverge from eachother. Lower<br>
oxygen levels tend to have lower peak temperatures. For the exemplary values<br><br>
of 7%, 9%,11% and 14%, the temperature range at 7 inches is from<br>
approximately 790 degrees Celsius to 870 degrees Celsius. Therefore, a<br>
tradeoff can be made between soot reduction and peak temperature. As can be<br>
appreciated, the oxygen levels may be controlled (e.g. reduced) as the cascading<br>
flamefront nears sensitive components.<br>
[0059] Referring now to FIG. 10, oxygen levels of the exhaust gas can<br>
be adjusted during regeneration to change the resultant temperature of the<br>
cascading flamefront as it reaches the sensitive components of the PM filter. For<br>
example, the oxygen levels can be adjusted to reduce the likelihood that the<br>
flamefront will damage the rear end plugs of the PM filter. To that end, the<br>
oxygen levels may be set high initially to initiate heating of an upstream surface.<br>
After a predetermined period sufficient to allow the flamefront to reach the<br>
sensitive components, the oxygen level can be reduced to reduce a temperature<br>
of the burning soot.<br>
[0060] Referring now to FIG. 11, control begins with step 400. In step<br>
404, control determines whether regeneration has been enabled. If step 404 is<br>
true, control continues with step 412 and determines whether the burn zone<br>
location is in a face crack area or other sensitive area. If step 412 is false,<br>
control returns to step 412. When step 412 is true, control continues with step<br>
416 and determines whether the burn zone temperature will greater than a first<br>
predetermined temperature TTH1 at a current oxygen level. The burn zone<br>
temperature may be measured or estimated. For example, the burn zone<br><br>
temperature may be estimated based on flow rates, oxygen levels in the exhaust<br>
stream and elapsed time since regeneration was started.<br>
[0061] If step 416 is true, control decreases oxygen in the exhaust<br>
stream in step 420. The oxygen level in the exhaust can be adjusted using any<br>
suitable approach. For example only, the oxygen level in the exhaust can be<br>
adjusted using post fuel, exhaust gas regeneration (EGR), throttle or other<br>
suitable adjustments.<br>
[0062] If step 416 is false, control continues with step 421 and<br>
determines whether the burn zone temperature will less than a second<br>
predetermined temperature TTH2 at a current oxygen level. If true, control<br>
increases oxygen in the exhaust gas in step 422. Control continues from steps<br>
420, 422 and 421 (if false) with step 424. In step 424, control determines<br>
whether the zone is done. If not, control returns to step 412. If step 424 is false,<br>
control continues with step 426, where control determines whether another zone<br>
needs to be regenerated. If step 426 is true, control returns to step 412.<br>
Otherwise control ends.<br><br>
