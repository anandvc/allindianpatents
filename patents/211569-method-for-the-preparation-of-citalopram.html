Method for the Preparation of Citalopram<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of the well known anti¬depressant drug citalopram, l-[3"(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5« isobenzofiirancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-PsychopharmacoL &amp; Biol Psychiat., 1982, 
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,271 corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram by one method and outlines a further method which may be used for preparing citalopram.<br>
According to the process described, the corresponding l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is reacted with 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-chloride in the presence of methylsulfinylmethide as condensing agent. The starting material was prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide.<br>
According to the method, which is only outlined in general terms, citalopram may be obtained by ring closure of the compound:<br><br><br>
in the presence of a dehydrating agent and subsequent exchange of the 5-bromo group with cyano using cuprous cyanide. The starting material of Formula II is obtained from 5-bromophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium chloride and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium chloride, respectively.<br>
A new and surprising method and an intermediate for the preparation of citalopram were described in US Patent No 4,650,884 according to which an intermediate of the formula<br><br>
is subjected to a ring closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid in order to obtain citalopram. The intermediate of Formula III was prepared from 5-cyanophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium halogenide and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively.<br>
Further processes are disclosed in International patent application Nos. WO 98019511, WO 98019512 and WO 98019513. WO 98019512 and WO 98019513 relate to methods wherein a 5-amino-, 5-carboxy- or 5-(sec. aminocarbonyl)phthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resulting 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram. International patent application No. WO 98019511 discloses a process for the manufacture of citalopram wherein a (4-substituted-2-hydroxymethylphenyl-(4-fluorphenyl)methanol compound is subjected to ring closure and the resulting 5-substituted 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofiiran converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative which is alkylated with a (3-dimethylamino)propylhalogenide in order to obtain citalopram.<br><br>
Finally, methods of preparing the individual enantiomers of citalopram are disclosed in US Patent No 4,943,590 from which it also appears that the ring closure of the intermediate of Formula III may be carried out via a labile ester with a base.<br>
With respect to the above methods for the preparation of citalopram the proces comprising exchange of the 5-bromo group with cyano proved not to be very convenient in commercial scale, since it was the yield was rather low, the product was impure and in particular that it was difficult to separate the resulting citalopram from the corresponding 5-bromo compound.<br>
It has now been found that citalopram may be obtained in a high yield as a very pure product by a new catalytic process in which 5-cyano is exchanged for a 5-halogen or a 5-triflate group of l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyI)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuran thus avoid¬ing the extensive work up of the old cyanide exchange process.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of citalopram comprising reaction of a compound of Formula IV<br><br>
wherein R is iodo, bromo, chloro, or CF3-(CF,)n-S02- wherein n is an integer in the range 0-8, incl., with a cyanide source, for example KCN, NaCN or (R'4N)CN where R'4 indicates four groups which may be the same of different and are selected from hydrogen and straight chain or branched C,_6 alkyl, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a catalytic amount of Cu+ or Zn2+, or with Zn(CN)2 in the presence a palladium catalyst, and isolation of the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram<br><br><br>
as the base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the novel intermediates of Formula IV wherein R is CF3-(CF2)n-S02- wherein n is an integer in the range 0-8 or R is iodo.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to the above process in which the compound of Formula IV is the S-enatiomer.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to an antidepressant pharmaceutical composition comprising citalopram manufactured by the process of the invention.<br>
By the process of the invention citalopram is obtained as a pure product in high yield thus reducing costly purification processes. Furthermore, the reaction may be carried out in more convenient solvents, at a low temperature and at a low excess of CN" compared to the known cyano exchange process. The process has environmental advantages in that it only uses small amounts of heavy. Finally, this process gives an improved crystalline product enabling easy conversion to desired salts. The intermediates of Formula IV wherein R is CF3-(CF2)n-SO:-wherein n is an integer in the range 0-8 or R is iodo have been found to show pharmacological activity, i.e. 5-HT reuptake inhibiting effects, and accordingly they are useful as antidepressants<br>
The cyanide source used may be any useful source. Preferred sources are KCN, NaCN or (R,4N)CN where R'4 is as defined above. The cyanide source is used in a stoichiometric amount or in excess, preferably 1-2 equivalents are used pr. equivalent starting material of Formula IV. R%N+ may conveniently be (Bu)4N+ , The cyanide compound is preferably NaCN or KCN or Zn(CN)2.<br>
The palladium catalyst may be any suitable Pd(0) or Pd(II) containing catalyst, such as Pd(PPh3)4, Pd2(dba)3, Pd(PPh)2Cl2, etc. The Pd catalyst is conveniently used in an amount of 1-10, preferably 2-6, most preferably about 4-5 mol%.<br><br>
Catalytic amounts of Cu+ and Zn2+, respectively, means substoichiometric amounts such as 0.1 - 5, preferably 1 - 3 eq. %. Conveniently, about 54 eq. is used per eq. Pd . Any convenient source of Cu+ and Zn"~ may be used. Cu+ is preferably used in the form of Cul and Zn2+ is conveniently used as the Zn(CN)2 salt.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, R is CF3-(CF2)n-S02- wherein n is an integer from the range 0 to 8 or R is bromo or iodo, most preferably CF3-(CF2)8-S02-, CF3-S02-, bromo or iodo, in particular bromo.<br>
In another particularly preferred embodiment the compound of Formula IV is reacted with ZnCl2 in the presence of a Palladium catalyst, preferably Pd(PPh3)4 (tetrakis(triphenylphos-phine)palladium).<br>
The intermediate of Formula IV wherein R is bromo or chloro may be prepared from bromo-and chlorophthalide, respectively, as described in DE 2,657,271 and the corresponding US 4,136,193. The iodo may be prepared analogously from the corresponding phthalide derivatives and the compounds wherein R is CF3-(CF2)n-S02- may be prepared from the corresponding hydroxy compounds by a conventional triflation reaction.<br>
The reaction may be performed in any convenient solvent, preferably acetonitril, propionitrile, THF and ethylacetate.<br>
Other reaction conditions, solvents, etc. are conventional conditions for such reactions and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The compound of general Formula I may be used as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. As acid addition salts, such salts formed with organic or inorganic acids may be used. Exemplary of such organic salts are those with maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, oxalic, bismethylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, rnandelic, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzene sulfonic and theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines, for example 8-bromotheophylline.
