				<td>BALL CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY FOR HYDRAULIC CONTROL CIRCUIT<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY AND CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/952,972, filed on July 31, 2007, which is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to hydraulic check valves, and<br>
more particularly to ball check valves for use in vehicle powertrain hydraulic control<br>
units to reduce seat-to-seat transition time and thereby improve system response time.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Generally, a motor vehicle automatic transmission includes a number of<br>
gear elements, such as planetary gear sets, for coupling the transmission's input and<br>
output shafts, and a related number of hydraulically actuated torque establishing devices,<br>
such as clutches and brakes (the term "torque transmitting device" often used to refer to<br>
both clutches and brakes), that are selectively engageable to activate the above mentioned<br>
gear elements for establishing desired forward and reverse speed ratios between the input<br>
and output shafts. Engine torque and speed are converted by the transmission in response<br>
to the tractive-power demand of the motor vehicle.<br>
[0004]	Shifting from one speed ratio to another is performed in response to engine<br>
throttle and vehicle speed, and generally involves releasing one or more (off-going)<br>
clutches associated with the current or attained speed ratio, and applying one or more (on-<br>
coming) clutches associated with the desired or commanded speed ratio. To perform a<br>
"downshift", a shift is made from a low speed ratio to a high speed ratio. The downshift is<br>
accomplished by disengaging a clutch associated with the lower speed ratio, and engaging<br>
a clutch associated with the higher speed ratio, to thereby reconfigure the gear set to<br>
operate at the higher speed ratio. Shifts performed in the above manner are termed clutch-<br>
to-clutch shifts and require precise timing in order to achieve high quality shifting.<br>
 <br>
[0005]	Some transmission configurations incorporate a hydrodynamic input<br>
device, such as a torque converter, positioned between the engine and the transmission.<br>
The torque converter is a hydrokinetic fluid coupling employed predominantly to allow<br>
the engine to run without stalling when the vehicle wheels and transmission gears come<br>
to a stop, and to provide torque multiplication in the lower speed range of the engine.<br>
Certain torque converter assemblies include a torque converter clutch, also known as a<br>
lockup clutch, operated to provide a bypass mechanism, allowing the engine to<br>
circumvent the torque converter and transmit power directly to the transmission.<br>
[0006]	The various hydraulic subsystems of an automatic transmission, such as the<br>
torque transmitting devices, torque converter assembly, torque converter clutch, etc., are<br>
typically controlled through operation of a hydraulic circuit, also known as a hydraulic<br>
valve system. The hydraulic circuit traditionally engages (actuates) or disengages<br>
(deactivates) the various transmission subsystems through the manipulation of hydraulic<br>
pressure generated within a transmission oil pump assembly. The valves used in a<br>
conventional hydraulic control circuit commonly comprise electro-hydraulic devices (e.g.,<br>
solenoids), spring-biased accumulators, spring-biased spool valves, and ball check valves.<br>
[0007]	Ball check valves derive their name from their use of a spherical fluid<br>
control element, referred to in the art as a "ball", to close (seal) and open (unseal) one or<br>
more valve ports. Ball check valves are generally used in applications where it is<br>
desirable to selectively seal or unseal an opening based upon one or more physical factors<br>
such as, for example, pressure gradients, and thereby permit hydraulic fluid to flow in<br>
one direction, and prevent fluid flow in another direction. Ball check valves, as discussed<br>
herein, should not be confused with ball valves - a distinct type of valve assembly<br>
wherein a ball acts as a controllable rotor to stop or direct fluid flow.<br>
[0008]	In shuttle- or floating-type ball check valves, there are traditionally two<br>
independent hydraulic ("inlet") circuits configured to feed a third ("discharge" or<br>
"outlet") circuit. In this configuration, when the first inlet circuit is "pressurized" and the<br>
second inlet circuit is "exhausted", the check ball is seated against the second inlet port.<br>
Accordingly, the second circuit is sealed by the check ball, and the discharge circuit is<br>
fed hydraulic fluid by way of the first inlet circuit. Conversely, if the second circuit is<br>
thereafter pressurized, and the first circuit exhausted, the check ball will transition or<br>
 <br>
"float" from the seated position against the second inlet port to a seated position against<br>
the first inlet port through the generated pressure differential. Consequently, the first<br>
inlet circuit is sealed by the check ball, and the discharge circuit is fed hydraulic fluid by<br>
way of the second inlet circuit. Additionally, when neither inlet circuit is pressurized,<br>
fluid must be allowed to flow from the discharge circuit into at least one of the inlet<br>
circuits, which ensures that the discharge circuit is exhausted when neither inlet circuit is<br>
pressurized. A typical application in which a shuttle-type ball check valve assembly is<br>
used is where the same torque transmitting device (e.g., a clutch) is engaged (i.e., fed<br>
hydraulic fluid) from two different ports.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	In order to improve the efficiency and response time of a vehicle<br>
powertrain, the present invention provides a novel dual check ball design for a ball check<br>
valve assembly. The dual check ball design described hereinbelow reduces the seat-to-<br>
seat travel distance of the fluid distribution control element, and thus the travel time<br>
required for the fluid distribution control element to switch between operating modes. In<br>
so doing, the present invention provides faster and more consistent hydraulic circuit<br>
pressurization and a smoother, more responsive shift.<br>
[0010]	According to one embodiment of the present invention, a ball check valve<br>
assembly is provided. The ball check valve assembly has a valve housing that defines<br>
first and second openings that are spaced from one another such that respective centers<br>
thereof are a seat-to-seat length apart. The ball check valve assembly also includes a<br>
fluid distribution control element arranged substantially inside the valve housing. The<br>
fluid distribution control element includes a first obstruction element configured to<br>
fluidly seal the first opening, and a second obstruction element configured to fluidly<br>
seal the second opening. The first obstruction element is connected, secured, or<br>
attached to the second obstruction element by a web portion having a web length. The<br>
web length is configured to restrict one of the first and second obstruction elements<br>
from sealing its respective opening when the other obstruction element is positioned to<br>
seal the other respective opening.<br>
 <br>
[0011]	According to one aspect of the present embodiment, the fluid distribution<br>
control element transitions between the first and second openings along a substantially<br>
linear path of displacement. In this instance, the web length is preferably configured to<br>
minimize a seat-to-seat distance of travel along the linear path of displacement. The<br>
seat-to-seat distance of travel is the length the fluid distribution control element must<br>
travel to transition from one seated position (e.g., sealing the first opening) to the other<br>
seated position (e.g., sealing the second opening).<br>
[0012]	In accordance with another aspect, the first and second obstruction<br>
elements respectively comprise first and second substantially spherical members. In<br>
this respect, the web length is configured such that a center-to-center length between<br>
respective centers of the first and second spherical members is less than the seat-to-seat<br>
length. Specifically, it is preferred that the center-to-center length is approximately<br>
1mm less than the seat-to-seat length.<br>
[0013]	According to yet another aspect of the present embodiment, the fluid<br>
distribution control element is characterized by a lack of a continuous connection to the<br>
valve housing. It may also be preferred that the fluid distribution control element<br>
consists essentially of a single-piece member.<br>
[0014]	According to another embodiment of the present invention, a ball check<br>
valve assembly for use in a hydraulic control circuit of a vehicle powertrain is provided.<br>
The ball check valve assembly includes a valve housing which defines a valve chamber,<br>
first and second inlet openings laterally spaced from one another such that respective<br>
centers thereof are a seat-to-seat length apart, and a discharge port in selective fluid<br>
communication with the first and second inlet openings. A fluid distribution control<br>
element is arranged inside the valve chamber to transition between first and second<br>
openings along a substantially linear path of displacement. The fluid distribution<br>
control element includes a first obstruction element configured to fluidly seal the first<br>
inlet opening, and a second obstruction element configured to fluidly seal the second<br>
inlet opening. The first obstruction element is connected, secured, or attached to the<br>
second obstruction element by a web portion having a web length. The web length is<br>
configured to restrict one of the first and second obstruction elements from sealing its<br>
 <br>
respective inlet opening when the other obstruction element is sealing the other<br>
respective inlet opening. The web length is also configured to minimize a seat-to-seat<br>
distance of travel along the linear path of displacement.<br>
[0015]	According to one aspect of the present embodiment, the first and second<br>
obstruction elements respectively comprise first and second substantially spherical<br>
members. In this respect, the web length is configured such that a center-to-center<br>
length between respective centers of the first and second spherical members is less than<br>
the seat-to-seat length. Specifically, it is preferred that the center-to-center length is<br>
approximately 1mm less than the seat-to-seat length.<br>
[0016]	According to vet another embodiment of the present invention, a check<br>
ball valve assembly for use in a hydraulic control unit of a vehicle powertrain is<br>
provided. The check ball valve assembly includes a valve housing with a spacer plate<br>
operatively secured to a valve upper body to define a valve chamber therebetween. The<br>
spacer plate defines first and second circular inlet openings laterally spaced from one<br>
another such that respective centers thereof are a seat-to-seat length apart. The valve<br>
upper body defines a discharge port in selective fluid communication with the first and<br>
second inlet openings.<br>
[0017]	A fluid distribution control element is arranged substantially inside the<br>
valve chamber to transition between the first and second openings along a substantially<br>
linear path of displacement. The fluid distribution control element including a first<br>
substantially spherical member dimensioned to fluidly seal the first inlet opening when<br>
seated therein, and a second substantially spherical member dimensioned to fluidly seal<br>
the second inlet opening when seated therein. The first and second substantially<br>
spherical members are attached to one another by a web portion having a web length.<br>
The web length is configured such that a center-to-center length between respective<br>
centers of the first and second spherical members is substantially equal to and less than<br>
the seat-to-seat length. In addition, the fluid distribution control element is<br>
characterized by a lack of a continuous connection to the valve housing - i.e., spacer<br>
plate or valve upper body.<br>
 <br>
[0018]	The above features and advantages, and other features and advantages of<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023]	The present invention is described herein in the context of an exemplary<br>
automotive powertrain - an engine operatively connected to a final drive system via a<br>
multi-ratio power transmission through operation of an electro-hydraulic control system.<br>
Notably, the gear sets and control elements shown in FIG. 1 hereof have been greatly<br>
simplified, it being understood that further information regarding differential gear sets,<br>
fluid pressure routings, and so on may be found in the prior art. Furthermore, it should be<br>
readily understood that FIG. 1 is merely a representative application by which the present<br>
invention may be incorporated. As such, the present invention is by no means limited to<br>
the particular configuration of FIG. 1. Finally, the drawings provided herein - i.e., FIGS.<br>
1-3B are not to scale, and are provided purely for clarification purposes. Thus, the<br>
particular dimensions of the drawings presented herein are not to be considered<br>
limiting.<br>
 <br>
[0024]	Referring to the drawing, wherein like reference numbers refer to the same<br>
or similar components throughout the several views, FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a<br>
vehicle power train, designated generally by reference numeral 10, including a prime<br>
mover, such as engine 12, a multi-speed power transmission 14, and a torque converter<br>
assembly 16 fluidly coupling engine 12 to transmission 14 via input shaft 18. A torque<br>
converter clutch (or TCC) 19 is shown downstream of the torque converter assembly 16.<br>
The TCC 19 is selectively engaged to provide a direct mechanical coupling between the<br>
damper (not shown) may be implemented between the engine 12 and the transmission<br>
input shaft 18.<br>
[0025]	The transmission output shaft 20 is coupled to the driving wheels of the<br>
vehicle (not shown) in any of several conventional ways. FIG. 1 depicts a four-wheel-drive<br>
(4WD) application in which the transmission output shaft 20 is connected to a transfer case<br>
21 that is coupled to a rear drive shaft R and a front drive shaft F. Typically, the transfer<br>
case 21 is manually shiftable to selectively establish one of several drive conditions,<br>
including various combinations of two-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive, and high or low<br>
speed ranges, with a neutral condition occurring intermediate the two and four wheel drive<br>
conditions. Recognizably, the present invention can also be incorporated into additional<br>
applications not illustrated in FIG.l, including, but not limited to, all-wheel drive vehicles<br>
(AWD), two-wheel drive vehicles (2WD), etc.<br>
[0026]	The transmission 14 utilizes a plurality of differential gear sets, preferably<br>
in the nature of first, second, and third interconnected planetary gear sets designated<br>
generally as 23, 24 and 25, respectively, to establish desired forward and reverse speed<br>
ratios between the transmission input and output shafts 18, 20. The first planetary gear<br>
set 23 includes an outer gear member 29, typically designated as the ring gear, which<br>
circumscribes an inner gear member 28, typically designated as the sun gear, and a planet<br>
carrier assembly 30. The planet carrier assembly 30 includes a plurality of pinion gears<br>
27 rotatably mounted on a carrier member and disposed in meshing relationship with<br>
both the sun gear member 28 and the ring gear member 29.<br>
[0027]	The second planetary gear set 24 includes a ring gear member 32 coaxially<br>
disposed and rotatable with respect to a sun gear member 31 and a planet carrier<br>
 <br>
assembly 33. The planet carrier assembly 33 includes a plurality of pinion gears 37<br>
rotatably mounted on a carrier member and disposed in meshing relationship with both<br>
the sun gear member 31 and the ring gear member 32.<br>
[0028]	The third planetary gear set 25, similar to the first and second gear sets 23,<br>
24, includes a ring gear member 35 circumscribing a sun gear member 34 and a planet<br>
carrier assembly 36. The planet carrier assembly 36 includes a plurality of pinion gears<br>
41 rotatably mounted on a carrier member and disposed in meshing relationship with<br>
both the sun gear member 34 and the ring gear member 35. Each of the carriers<br>
described above can be either a single-pinion (simple) carrier assembly or a double-<br>
pinion (or compound) carrier assembly.<br>
[0029]	Still referring to FIG. 1, the input shaft 18 is continuously connected to the<br>
sun gear 28 of the first gear set 23, selectively connectable to the sun gears 31, 34 of the<br>
second and third gear sets 24, 25 via clutch C1, and selectively connectable to the carrier<br>
assembly 33 of the second gear set 24 via clutch C2. The ring gears 29, 32, 35 of first,<br>
second and third gear sets 23, 24, 25 are selectively connectable to a stationary member,<br>
such as transmission housing or casing 42, via brakes C3, C4 and C5, respectively.<br>
[0030]	In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the clutches C1-C5 are fluid-<br>
operated (e.g., hydraulic), preferably multi-plate, friction devices. The state of the<br>
clutches C1-C5 (i.e., fully-engaged, partially-engaged, or disengaged) can be controlled<br>
to provide six forward speed ratios (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), a reverse speed ratio (R) and a<br>
neutral condition (N). For example, the first forward speed ratio is achieved by engaging<br>
clutches C1 and C5. Downshifting from one forward speed ratio to another is generally<br>
achieved by disengaging one clutch - referred to as the off-going clutch - while engaging<br>
another clutch - referred to as the on-coming clutch. By way of example, the<br>
transmission 14 is downshifted from the second forward speed ratio to the first forward<br>
speed ratio by disengaging clutch C4 while contemporaneously engaging clutch C5.<br>
[0031]	The torque converter clutch 19 and the transmission clutches C1-C5 are<br>
controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system, generally designated by reference<br>
numeral 44 in FIG. 1. The hydraulic portions of the control system 44 include a pump 46<br>
which draws hydraulic fluid 49 from a sump or reservoir 48, and a pressure regulator 50<br>
which returns a portion of the pump output to reservoir 48 to develop a regulated pressure<br>
 <br>
in line 52. The hydraulic portions of the control system 44 also include a secondary<br>
pressure regulator valve 54, a manual valve 56 manipulated by the operator of the<br>
vehicle, and a number of fluid control valves, represented herein by first, second, third,<br>
and fourth valves 58, 60, 62 and 64, respectively. Each control valve is configured to<br>
provide fluid to the apply chamber 91 of its respective clutch C1-C5 at either a full feed<br>
state or a regulating state.<br>
[0032]	The electronic portion of the electro-hydraulic control system 44 is<br>
primarily defined by the transmission control unit or controller 66, which is depicted in<br>
FIG. 1 as microprocessor-based and conventional in architecture. The transmission<br>
control unit 66 controls the fluid control valves 58-64 based, at least in part, on a number<br>
of inputs 68 to achieve a desired transmission speed ratio. Such inputs include, for<br>
example, signals representing the transmission input speed (TIS), a driver torque<br>
command (TQ), the transmission output speed (TOS), and the hydraulic fluid temperature<br>
(TSUMP). The sensors traditionally employed for developing such signals may be<br>
conventional in nature, and have been omitted for simplicity.<br>
[0033]	The control lever 82 of manual valve 56 is coupled to a sensor and display<br>
module 84 that produces a diagnostic signal on line 86 based on the position of the<br>
control lever 82; such signal is conventionally referred to as a "PRNDL signal", since it<br>
indicates which of the transmission ranges (P, R, N, D or L) has been selected by the<br>
vehicle driver. Finally, one or more fluid control or relay valves 60 are provided with a<br>
plurality of pressure switches, e.g., 74, 76, 78, for supplying diagnostic signals to control<br>
unit 66, e.g., via lines 80, based upon the respective positions of each relay valve 60. The<br>
control unit 66, in turn, monitors the various diagnostic signals for the purpose of<br>
verifying proper operation of the various controlled elements.<br>
[0034]	The fluid control valves 58-64 of FIG. 1 are generally characterized as<br>
being of the "on/off or modulated type. The fluid control valves 60 include a set of on/off<br>
relay valves (depicted collectively in FIG. 1 as a consolidated block) that are utilized in<br>
concert with manual valve 56 to enable controlled engagement and disengagement of the<br>
clutches C1-C5 with only two modulated valves 62, 64. For any selected ratio, the control<br>
unit 66 activates a particular combination of relay valves 60 for coupling one of the<br>
modulated valves 62, 64 to the on-coming clutch, and the other one of the modulated<br>
 <br>
valves 62, 64 to the off-going clutch. The modulated valves 62, 64 each comprise a<br>
conventional pressure regulator valve (not shown) biased by a variable pilot pressure that is<br>
developed by current controlled force motors (not shown). The fluid control valve 58 is<br>
also a modulated valve. Valve 58 controls the fluid supply path to converter clutch 19 in<br>
lines 70, 72 for selectively engaging and disengaging the converter clutch 19.<br>
[0035]	The transmission control unit 66 of FIG. 1 is configured to determine,<br>
among other things, the commands for smoothly engaging the on-coming clutch while<br>
smoothly disengaging the off-going clutch, to thereby shift from one speed ratio to<br>
another. The transmission control unit 66 develops the corresponding force motor<br>
current commands, and supplies current to the respective force motors in accordance with<br>
the current commands. Thus, the clutches C1-C5 are responsive to the pressure<br>
commands via the valves 58-64 and their respective actuating elements (e.g., solenoids,<br>
current-controlled force motors), described in more detail below with respect to FIG. 2.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 2 provides a schematic representation of a portion of the hydraulic<br>
control system 44 utilized to control the engagement and disengagement of the hydraulic<br>
components and subsystems of the transmission 14 of FIG. 1 (e.g., torque converter<br>
assembly 16, TCC 19, clutches C1-C5, etc.). More particularly, a shuttle-type ball check<br>
valve assembly 100, also referred to herein as "check valve" or "valve assembly", in<br>
accordance with the present invention is shown in fluid communication with a hydraulic<br>
"on/off valve (referred to hereinafter as spool valve 150) via discharge port 118 through<br>
control orifice 154. The check valve 100 and spool valve 150 define, in part, a "shift<br>
valve system" that, as will be further explained below, is multiplexed to control<br>
engagement and disengagement of one or more torque transmitting devices, e.g., clutches<br>
C1-C5 of FIG. 1. The control orifice 154 is employed to regulate the rate of flow (e.g., in<br>
gallons/minute or cubic inches/ second) of the control medium into the fill cavity 158.<br>
[0037]	The spool valve 150 includes a spool piston 156 (or "valve spool")<br>
extending slidably inside, and coaxially oriented with a spool housing 162, which has a<br>
longitudinal form and generally cylindrical configuration. As an axial extension thereof,<br>
there is a fill cavity 158 and housing space 160 coaxially arranged at opposing ends of the<br>
spool housing 162. The housing space 160 accommodates a biasing member 152 which,<br>
for example, consists of a compression spring arrangement having its two ends bearing<br>
 <br>
respectively against a distal end 172 of the of the valve housing 162 and a spring seat<br>
surface 170 of the spool piston 156.<br>
[0038]	A plurality of valve ducts 164 open peripherally into the intermediate part<br>
of spool housing 162, arranged between fill cavity 158 and housing space 160. Similarly,<br>
a plurality of fluid passages 166 open peripherally into the intermediate part of spool<br>
housing 162, arranged between fill cavity 158 and housing space 160 in selective fluid<br>
communication with one or more of the plurality of valve ducts 164. The fluid passages<br>
166 lead to an outer connection side of the hydraulic control system 44, where fluid line<br>
or ducts (not illustrated) may be connected to other parts of the system (e.g., clutches Cl-<br>
C5 of FIG.1.)<br>
[0039]	The spool piston 156 includes first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth<br>
substantially cylindrical landing portions 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, and 184, respectively,<br>
separated by respective first, second, third, fourth, and fifth substantially cylindrical<br>
groove portions 186, 188, 190, 192 and 194, respectively. A spring seat 196 extends<br>
substantially perpendicularly from the spring seat surface 170 of the first land 174, and a<br>
housing connection 198 extends substantially perpendicularly from the sixth land 184.<br>
[0040]	According to the arrangement of FIG. 2, the spool piston 156 is engaged<br>
(i.e., urged in a leftward direction with respect to FIG. 2), through the introduction into fill<br>
cavity 158 of control medium (e.g., hydraulic fluid 49 of FIG. 1) having a pressure that is<br>
greater than the return force of the biasing member 152. Lateral translation (i.e., leftward<br>
movement) of the spool piston 156 inside spool housing 162 places one or more of the<br>
valve ducts 164 in fluid communication with one or more respective fluid passages 166, to<br>
hydraulically actuate a corresponding transmission component (e.g., clutches C1-C5 of<br>
FIG. 1). That same lateral translation of the spool piston 156 inside spool housing 162<br>
also eliminates fluid communication between one or more valve ducts 164 and one or more<br>
respective fluid passages 166 by positioning a respective landing portion (e.g., landings<br>
174-184) therebetween, so as to obstruct fluid flow. The return movement (i.e., rightward<br>
movement with respect to FIG. 2) of spool piston 156 is effected through the venting of fill<br>
cavity 158, owing to the return force of the biasing member 152.<br>
[0041]	As described in detail below with respect to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the check<br>
valve 100 determines whether pressurized fluid is supplied to fill cavity 158 from a first<br>
 <br>
hydraulic circuit 130 via a first feeding or inlet opening 114 (depicted for explanatory<br>
purposes by hidden arrow Fl in FIG. 2), or whether pressurized fluid is supplied to fill<br>
cavity 158 from a second hydraulic circuit 132 via a second feeding or inlet opening 116<br>
(depicted for explanatory purposes by solid arrow F2 in FIG. 2). The pressurized control<br>
medium entering the check valve assembly 100 via the first inlet opening 114 (e.g., arrow<br>
Fl) preferably has a pressure that is greater than the control medium entering the valve<br>
housing 101 via the second inlet opening 116 (e.g., arrow F2).<br>
[0042]	Figures 3A and 3B are cross-sectional illustrations of the dual check ball,<br>
check valve assembly 100 of FIG. 2. The check valve assembly 100 includes a valve<br>
housing 101, defined herein by a portion of the control valve upper body 102 and spacer<br>
plate 104. The spacer plate 104 portion of the valve housing 101 in turn defines the first<br>
and second inlet openings 114, 116 therethrough; oriented as shown in FIG. 2 for<br>
transmitting pressurized control medium (e.g., hydraulic fluid 49 of FIG. 1) from<br>
respective first and second hydraulic circuits 130, 132 to a fill cavity, such as fill cavity<br>
158 of FIG. 2. In a similar regard, the control valve upper body 102 portion of the valve<br>
housing 101 defines the discharge port 118 fluidly communicating the check valve<br>
assembly 100 with the fill cavity 158 (FIG. 2). Although depicted in FIGS. 3A-3B as<br>
incorporated into a "bathtub" floating check valve configuration, the dual check ball<br>
design of the present invention may be integrated into other check valve configurations,<br>
including, but not limited to, orifice check valves and the like, without departing from the<br>
scope of the claimed invention.<br>
[0043]	Also included in the check valve assembly 100 is a fluid distribution<br>
control element or "dual check ball" 106, which consists of a first obstruction element,<br>
depicted herein as first spherical member 108, connected, secured, or attached by central<br>
web portion 112 to a second obstruction element, depicted herein as second spherical<br>
member 110. As will be described in extensive detail hereinbelow, the first and second<br>
spherical members 108, 110 are each configured to respectively engage, interact, or mate<br>
with, and thereby fluidly seal the first and second inlet openings 114, 116.<br>
[0044]	The dual check ball 106 is disposed inside a valve chamber 126, and<br>
operable to translate laterally between first and second seated positions, shown<br>
respectively in FIGS. 3A and 3B, for alternatively opening and closing the first and<br>
 <br>
second inlet openings 114, 116, to thereby selectively pressurize the discharge port 118<br>
with hydraulic fluid from the first or second hydraulic circuits 130, 132. Referring to<br>
FIG. 3A, for example, as pressurized control medium enters the valve chamber 126 via<br>
the second inlet opening 116 (e.g., arrow F2), and acts upon the second spherical member<br>
110, the dual check ball 106 is urged in a leftward direction along a substantially linear<br>
path, represented herein by arrow A1. Contemporaneously, the first hydraulic circuit 130<br>
is exhausted, creating a pressure gradient across first inlet opening 114, pulling the first<br>
spherical member 108 into a seated position, thereby fluidly sealing the first inlet opening<br>
114. In contrast, as pressurized control medium enters the valve chamber 126 via the<br>
first inlet opening 114 (e.g., arrow F1), and acts upon the first spherical member 108, the<br>
dual check ball 106 is urged in a rightward direction along a substantially linear path,<br>
represented herein by arrow A2 in FIG. 3B. Contemporaneously, the second hydraulic<br>
circuit 132 is exhausted, creating a pressure gradient across the second inlet opening 116,<br>
pulling the second spherical member 110 into a seated position, thereby fluidly sealing<br>
the second inlet opening 116.<br>
[0045]	The dual check ball 106 defines certain geometric characteristics that may<br>
be selectively modified depending upon the intended application of the check valve<br>
assembly 100 and the particular configuration of the valve body 101. For example, the<br>
length 120 of the web portion 112 is designed to restrict the dual check ball 106 from<br>
sealing both first and second inlet openings 114, 116 at any one time. Additionally, the<br>
length 120 of the web portion 112 is configured to reduce the distance of travel required for<br>
the first and second spherical members 108, 110 to translate from an unseated, unsealed<br>
position (e.g., spherical member 110 in FIG. 3A) to a seated, sealing position (e.g.,<br>
spherical member 110 in FIG. 3B). Optimally, the length 120 of the web portion 112 is<br>
designed such that the center-to-center length 124 (that being from center C1 of the first<br>
spherical member 108 to center C2 of the second spherical member 110, as shown in FIG.<br>
3B) of the dual check ball 106 is substantially equal to, but less than (on the order of about<br>
1mm) the seat-to-seat length 122 (also shown in FIG. 3B) between center point of the first<br>
and second inlet openings 114, 116, thereby minimizing the seat-to-seat distance and, thus<br>
the seat-to-seat travel time of the dual check ball 106, while always allowing for at least<br>
one path to exhaust oil from fill cavity 158. In effect, the seat-to-seat distance is the space<br>
 <br>
the dual check ball 106 must travel when transitioning from one seated position (e.g., first<br>
spherical member 108 seated in the first inlet opening 114, FIG. 3A) to the other (e.g.,<br>
second spherical member 110 seated in the second inlet opening 116, FIG. 3B.)<br>
[0046]	In a similar respect, the geometric configuration of each first and second<br>
obstruction elements (i.e., first and second spherical members 108, 110) is such that when<br>
seated in their respective inlet openings 114 and 116 (as described above with respect to<br>
FIGS. 3A and 3B) a pressure-tight seal is created. For example, the diameter 142 of the<br>
second spherical member 110 (as seen in FIG. 3A) is sized with respect to the diameter<br>
146 of the second inlet opening 116 to thereby create a fluid seal when the second<br>
spherical member 110 is seated thereupon. Similarly, referring to FIG. 3B, the diameter<br>
140 of the first spherical member 108 is sized with respect to the diameter 144 of the first<br>
inlet opening 114 to thereby create a fluid seal when the first spherical member 108 is<br>
seated thereupon.<br>
[0047]	According to preferred practices, the dual check ball 106 is characterized<br>
by a lack of a continuous connection to the valve housing 101. In other words, there is<br>
no connecting piece attaching the dual check ball 106 to any one portion of the upper<br>
valve body 102 or spacer plate 104. Moreover, the dual check ball 106 preferably<br>
consists of a single-piece member, eliminating such unnecessary components as a<br>
separate biasing member (e.g., spring), control arm, or guide piece to properly operate.<br>
Although depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B as having substantially spherical designs, the first<br>
and second obstruction members can take on other geometric configurations, such as<br>
semi-spherical, tear-drop, etc., without departing from the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
[0048]	While the best modes for carrying out the present invention have been<br>
described in detail herein, those familiar with the art to which this invention pertains will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention<br>
within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
