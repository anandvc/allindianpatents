				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
FUNCTIONAL STARCH POWDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to functional<br>
starch powder, a composition including the functional<br>
starch powder and one or more active ingredients, and a<br>
method for producing the functional starch powder.<br>
More particularly, it relates to functional starch<br>
powder which permits control of the release of an<br>
active ingredient(s) when used in medicines,<br>
agrochemicals, fertilizers, feed, food, industry,<br>
cosmetics, etc. The composition containing the active<br>
ingredient (s) can be obtained as a sustained-release or<br>
rapid-release composition, depending on the amount of<br>
the functional starch powder incorporated into the<br>
composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
For compositions having sustained-release<br>
properties, there are, for example, solid sustained-<br>
release medicines. The solid sustained-release<br>
medicines are very useful for controlling the blood<br>
level of the active ingredient(s), reducing the<br>
frequency at which the medicine must be taken;<br>
prolonging the effect of active ingredients that have a<br>
short half-life; and reducing the side effects of the<br><br>
W1796<br>
71/10<br><br><br>
active ingredients that have a narrow range between a<br>
minimum effective blood concentration and a side effect<br>
exhibition concentration. Regarding conventional solid<br>
sustained-release medicine, there are matrix type<br>
 sustained-release tablets that use a hydrophilic<br>
polymer capable of forming a gel upon contact with<br>
water, and reservoir type sustained-release capsules<br>
that enclose granules of medicine. The granules<br>
within the capsules are formed by coating core<br>
 particles with an active ingredient(s) and then coating<br>
the surface of the coated particles with a coating film<br>
capable of imparting sustained-release properties.<br>
Tablets are preferable to capsules and granules from<br>
the viewpoint of ease of taking, but reservoir<br>
 sustained-release tablets have been disadvantageous in<br>
that when the sustained-release granules are compressed<br>
into the tablets, the coating film capable of imparting<br>
sustained-release properties is destroyed, so that the<br>
controlled release of the active ingredient (s) by<br>
 dissolving becomes difficult.<br>
On the other hand, patent document 1 and the<br>
like describe that hydrophilic polymers such as methyl<br>
cellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) can be used as a<br>
 release-sustaining base ingredient used in the matrix<br>
type sustained-release preparations. These hydrophilic<br>
polymers are advantageous, for example, in that they<br>
impart sustained-release properties by the formation of<br><br><br>
a complete gel layer by hydration in a solution having<br>
a low ionic strength, are hardly affected by pH, and<br>
are excellent in the stability of release by<br>
dissolution over a long period of time. They, however,<br>
5 have a problem, which is called dose dumping. If dose<br>
dumping occurs, it becomes impossible to hydrate the<br>
polymer in a solution having an intermediate or higher<br>
ionic strength, their gelation is suppressed, so that a<br>
large portion of the active ingredient(s) of a<br>
 pharmaceutical preparation designed to have sustained-<br>
release properties is rapidly released, thus, the<br>
 preparation exhibits no sustained-release properties.<br>
When the dose dumping occurs, the resulting rapid<br>
increase of the active ingredient(s) in the blood can<br>
 induce death, depending on the efficacy of the active<br>
ingredient(s) that have a narrow range between the.<br>
minimum blood level and the concentration where side<br>
effects are exhibited. Since the value of ionic<br>
strength in the gastrointestinal tract varies depending<br>
 on regions of the tract and the food consumed, there<br>
has been a desire for a release-sustaining base<br>
ingredient which makes it possible to avoid the dose<br>
dumping in a wide ionic strength value range throughout<br>
the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
	Patent documents 2 to 5 describe simultaneous<br>
use of pregelatinized starch and a hydrophilic polymer<br>
such as hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose as a means for avoiding the dose dumping.<br><br><br>
However, the pregelatinized starch (preferably drum-<br>
dried waxy corn starch) used in patent document 2 has<br>
no sustained-release effect in itself and is such that<br>
sustained-release properties are imparted by an<br>
 ingredient other than the pregelatinized starch. In<br>
addition, the pregelatinized starch is disadvantageous<br>
in that the pregelatinized starch has only auxiliary<br>
effect on the release-sustaining base ingredient,<br>
because both the base ingredient and this auxiliary are<br>
 necessary and the amounts added should be large,<br>
resulting in an increased size of a preparation.<br>
Patent documents 3 to 5 describe that the tablet<br>
tensile strength of pregelatinized starch at a solid<br>
fraction of 0.8 is 0.15 kN/cm2. They, however, do not<br>
 describe the upper limit of the tablet tensile<br>
strength. The tensile strength of the pregelatinized<br>
starch used in the comparative examples in these patent<br>
documents is 0.220 to 0.323 kN/cm2, while the tensile<br>
strength of the functional starch powder of the<br>
 invention is 0.7 to 1.5 kN/cm2. Thus, they are clearly<br>
different. In patent documents 2 to 4, sustained-<br>
release properties are imparted by a combination of<br>
pregelatinized starch and hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose. These documents, however, neither describe<br>
 nor suggest that starch having a tensile strength of<br>
0.15 kN/cm2 or more imparts sustained-release properties<br>
by itself. In addition, no starch having a tensile<br>
strength of more than 0.323 kN/cm2 has been reported.<br><br><br>
As starch used in the fields of medicines,<br>
agrochemicals, fertilizers, feed, food, industry,<br>
cosmetics, etc., there are pregelatinized starch,<br>
partly pregelatinized starch, crosslinked starch and<br>
 the like. They are used as a disintegrating agent<br>
mainly in the medicine field.<br>
All of the starches described in patent<br>
documents 6 to 15 rapidly collapse and do not impart<br>
any sustained-release properties. They are essentially<br>
 different in the following respects from the starch of<br>
the invention, from which tablets that contain 60 to<br>
100% of the starch powder are not disintegrated in 3<br>
hours or more. That is, the modified starch of patent<br>
document 6 has a low degree of swelling of 2.5 to 12<br>
 and breadks down in 30 minutes. The tablets of patent<br>
document 7 that contain waxy starch disintegrate such<br>
that tablets containing 50% of the waxy starch are<br>
disintegrated within 60 seconds. The tablets of patent<br>
document Î² contain Î²-starch with an Î±-starch surface<br>
 and tablets containing 17 to 30% of the p-starch are<br>
disintegrated within 2 minutes. The tablests of patent<br>
document 9 containing p-starch having 1 to 4% of Î±-<br>
starch adhered thereto disintegrate such that tablets<br>
containing 17 to 87% of this Î²-starch are disintegrated<br>
 within 20 seconds. The starch of patent document 10,<br>
which is obtained by 5 to 20% pregelatinization of the<br>
surface of Î²-starch, breaks down within 2 minutes. The<br>
modified starch of patent document 11 has a cold-water-<br><br><br>
soluble matter content of 10 to 20%, and tablets<br>
containing 64 to 80% of this modified starch are<br>
disintegrated within 20 minutes. The processed starch<br>
of patent document 12 has a low degree of swelling of<br>
 3.0 to 6.0 and the tablets containing 10% of this<br>
processed starch are disintegrated within 6 minutes.<br>
The processed starch of patent document 13 has a cold-<br>
water soluble matter content of less than 10% by<br>
weight, a small swelling volume of 3 to 15 ml/g and a<br>
 low water retention capacity of at most 610% and breaks<br>
down within 2 minutes. The starch of patent document<br>
14	is a cross-linked starch powder having a low<br>
swelling property (swelling property in cold water: 3<br>
to 25 ml) and breaks down more rapidly than Starch 1500<br>
 (Comparative Example 6). The processed starch of<br>
patent document 15 has a small swelling volume of 3 to<br>
15	ml and is the starch represented by PCS (Comparative<br>
Example 5) and Starch 1500 (Comparative Example 6).<br>
Thus, these starches are essentially different from the<br>
 starch of the invention.<br>
Patent documents 16 to 20 describe a starch<br>
is used as a matrix base ingredient. Patent document<br>
16	describes that matrix tablets are made of a high-<br>
molecular weight polysaccharide existing in nature.<br>
 This document, however, describes only working examples<br>
relating to xanthan gum and no working example using<br>
starch and does not specifically describe starch<br>
capable of imparting sustained-release properties.<br><br><br>
Patent document 17 describes that a matrix agent<br>
substantially contains a crystalline straight-chain<br>
glucan and a glucan-degrading reagent. The straight-<br>
chain glucan, however, refers to amylose. The<br>
 functional starch powder of the invention is different<br>
from the matrix agent because it contains amylopectin<br>
besides amylose as described hereinafter. In addition,<br>
in the case of the functional starch powder of the<br>
invention, the glucan-degrading reagent is not<br>
 necessary for controlling the release of an active<br>
ingredient. Patent document 18 describes that a matrix<br>
raw material substantially contains a crystalline<br>
straight-chain glucan. This document, however,<br>
describes that amylopectin is removed from starch. The<br>
 functional starch powder of the invention is different<br>
from the matrix raw material because it contains<br>
amylose and amylopectin.<br>
Patent document 19 describes that the core<br>
tablets of film-coated tablets contain pregelatinized<br>
 starch having an average degree of pregelatinization of<br>
35 to 95%. Since the average degree of<br>
pregelatinization of the functional starch powder of<br>
the invention ranges from 40 to 98%, it is difficult to<br>
distinguish the starch of the invention from that of<br>
 patent document 19 only by the average degree of<br>
pregelatinization. The functional starch powder of the<br>
invention, however, is clearly different from the<br>
latter, for example, in gel indentation load and the<br><br>
amount of swollen or dissolved amylose and amylopectin.<br>
The purpose of the starch of patent document 19 is to<br>
prevent the tablets from being impregnated with a<br>
liquid at the time of coating, and hence is obviously<br>
 different from that of the functional starch powder of<br>
the invention. The coated tablets (the amount of the<br>
starch used: 14 wt%) themselves have excellent<br>
disintegrating properties. From these facts, it is<br>
clear that the starch of patent document 19 does not<br>
 control the release of a drug. Patent document 20<br>
describes spherical fine particles wholly or partly<br>
composed of a water-insoluble cottony polysaccharide.<br>
The fine particles of patent document 20 are produced,<br>
for example, by a biocatalyst process using starch<br>
 synthase. On the other hand, the functional starch<br>
powder of the invention is produced only by heat<br>
treatment without using a catalyst such as an enzyme.<br>
Thus, the functional starch powder is obviously<br>
different from the fine particles of patent document<br>
 20. As to the shape of the functional starch powder of<br>
the invention, the functional starch powder comprises<br>
starch particles with a particle size of 50 to 100 Âµm<br>
having a structure formed by indenting a sphere or an<br>
oval in one or more parts thereof. Thus, the<br>
 functional starch powder is clearly different from the<br>
fine particles of patent document 20, i.e., the<br>
spherical fine particles of 1 nm to 100 Âµm having a<br>
narrow particle size distribution. Patent document 21<br><br><br>
describes starch particles obtained by drying an<br>
emulsion of an active ingredient and starch which has<br>
an amylopectin content of 65% or more and 80% by weight<br>
or more of which has a limited molecular weight of 10<br>
 to 10000 kDa. This starch, however, is water-soluble<br>
and the functional starch powder of the invention is<br>
different from the starch because it contains a water-<br>
insoluble component. Patent document 22 describes a<br>
method for making starch and a material into a slurry<br>
 in a saturated aqueous salt solution and making the<br>
slurry into capsules, which includes blowing steam<br>
through starch at a pressure of at least 110 psi (0.78<br>
MPa) in the presence of a salt to disperse the starch<br>
completely, heating the resulting starch slurry to a<br>
 temperature of 120 to 180Â°C at 55 to 120 psi (0.39 to<br>
0.84 MPa) or more, and immediately exposing the slurry<br>
to atmospheric pressure to lower the temperature to<br>
112Â°C or lower. However, when the salt is present,<br>
amylose is precipitated, so that the product obtained<br>
 by the method is not the starch particles according to<br>
the invention, i.e., starch particles with a particle<br>
size of 50 to 100 Âµm having an indentation in one or<br>
more parts thereof but a filmy and leaf-like product<br>
formed by the crystallization of amylose. Therefore,<br>
 the product is different in shape from the fine<br>
particles according to the invention.<br>
On the other hand, pregelatinized starch is<br>
used mainly in the food field as a thickening agent,<br><br><br>
feed for eel breeding or the like has been<br>
disadvantageous in that a gel formed by the starch is<br>
destroyed in the presence of Î±-amylase, resulting in a<br>
deteriorated release-sustaining capability, as reported<br>
 in Chem. Pharm. Bull., 35(10)4346-4350(1987). It has<br>
been disadvantageous also in that at a high ionic<br>
strength, and it loses release-sustaining properties.<br>

 starch raw material and subsequently drying the swollen.<br>
starch particles to obtain a powder mixture comprising<br>
starch particles and amylose and amylopectin which are<br>
present in the exteriors of these starch particles.<br>
(8) A method for producing functional starch<br>

 conventional natural or processed starch, is excellent<br>
in pH stability and long-term stability and, moreover,<br>
is not affected by ionic strength, so that it is free<br>
from the dose dumping problem in conventional release-<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is explained below in detail.<br><br><br>
The functional starch powder of the invention<br>
should have a water retention capacity of 400% or more,<br>
more preferably 500% or more, particularly preferably<br>
700%. The term "water retention capacity" is defined<br>
 as the volume of pure water retained by starch after<br>
the centrifugation (2000G, 10 minutes) of a dispersion<br>
of 1 g of dry starch powder in pure water. When the<br>
water retention capacity is less than 400%, the starch<br>
powder is hydrated to form no gel, resulting in<br>
 disintegration of tablets, or the starch powder cannot<br>
exhibit satisfactory release-sustaining properties<br>
because of rapid diffusion of an active ingredient(s)<br>
even when the starch powder forms a gel layer. The<br>
gel-forming capability is enhanced with an increase of<br>
 the water retention capacity. When the water retention<br>
capacity is high, the gel is desirably not destroyed<br>
even at a high ionic strength, though the maximum water<br>
retention capacity is dependent on characteristics of a<br>
starch raw material and is at most 3000%.<br>
 	In addition, the functional starch powder of<br>
the invention should have a collapse time of 5 hours or<br>
more. The term "collapse time" is defined as the<br>
disintegration time, in a test solution, of a<br>
cylindrical molded article with a diameter of 0.8 cm<br>
 obtained by compressing 0.2 g of starch powder at 50<br>
MPa. Here, the test solution is the second solution<br>
(pH 6.8) prescribed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, the<br>
14th revision, p. 204 and a disintegration test is<br><br><br>
carried out by the use of an auxiliary plate according<br>
to the disintegration test method described in the<br>
Japanese Pharmacopoeia (14th revision). When the<br>
collapse time is less than 5 hours, no satisfactory<br>
 release-sustaining properties can be attained. The<br>
upper limit of the collapse time depends on the desired<br>
degree of release-sustaining properties and is at most<br>
240 hours.<br>
Furthermore, the functional starch powder of<br>
 the invention should have a gel indentation load of 200<br>
g or more, preferably 300 g or more, particularly<br>
preferably 4 00 g or more. The term "gel indentation<br>
load" is defined as a maximum load applied when a<br>
cylindrical adapter is pressed for 3 mm at a rate of<br>
 0.1 mm/sec into a gel formed by immersing, in pure<br>
water for 4 hours, a cylindrical molded article with a<br>
diameter of 1.13 cm obtained by compressing 0.5 g of<br>
starch powder at 50 MPa. Here, the term "maximum load"<br>
means the following: when a layer of the gel is broken,<br>
 the term means a load value at the time of the<br>
breaking; and when the gel layer is not broken, the<br>
term means a maximum load value which the adapter<br>
applies before it intrudes for 5 mm into the<br>
gelatinized cylindrical molded article. When the gel<br>
 indentation load is less than 200 g, the diffusion of<br>
an active ingredient(s) in a gel layer formed by the<br>
starch powder becomes rapid, so that no satisfactory<br>
release-sustaining properties are exhibited. Although<br><br><br>
the gel indentation load is preferably high because the<br>
release-sustaining capability of the starch powder is<br>
enhanced with an increase of the gel indentation load,<br>
it is at most about 3000 g.<br>
 	As to the shape of starch particles<br>
constituting the functional starch powder of the<br>
invention, the starch particles have more preferable<br>
characteristic in that they have a structure formed by<br>
indenting a sphere or an oval in one or more parts<br>
 thereof. As to the particle size of the starch<br>
particles constituting the functional starch powder of<br>
the invention, the functional starch powder preferably<br>
includes starch particles having a particle size in the<br>
range of 50 to 500 urn, preferably 50 to 300 Âµm, more<br>
 preferably 50 to 100 urn, when observed by SEM (scanning<br>
electron microscope) at a magnification of 200 to 1500.<br>
As to the content of such starch particles having a<br>
structure formed by indenting a sphere or an oval in<br>
one or more parts thereof, the functional starch powder<br>
 preferably contains such starch particles so that for<br>
example, when it is observed at a modification of 600,<br>
the proportion (% by the number of particles) of such<br>
starch particles to all particles observable in the<br>
field of vision may be 5% or more, preferably 10% or<br>
 more. The content (% by the number of particles)<br>
measured by such observation is considered as the<br>
content (% by weight) based on the weight of all the<br>
starch particles. When particle size of the starch<br><br><br>
particles having an indentation in one or more parts<br>
thereof is less than 50 Âµm, the starch particles hardly<br>
release, outside them, amylose and amylopectin which<br>
can be swollen or dissolved in a sufficient volume of<br>
 water, and hence no sufficient sustained-release<br>
properties can be imparted. This is not desirable.<br>
When the functional starch powder is dispersed in<br>
water, the amount of amylose and amylopectin, each of<br>
which is present in a swollen or dissolved state, is<br>
 preferably in the range of 10 to 90% by weight based on<br>
the weight of all the starch particles. When the<br>
particle size of the starch particles having an<br>
indentation in one or more parts thereof is more than<br>
500 Âµm, the amount of amylose and amylopectin, which<br>
 are present in the exterior of starch particles,<br>
exceeds 90% by weight based on the weight of all the<br>
starch particles and hence the resistance to Î±-amylase<br>
is decreased, so that no satisfactory sustained-release<br>
properties can be imparted. This is not desirable.<br>
 	The starch particles constituting the<br>
functional starch powder of the invention have a<br>
structure formed by indenting a sphere or an oval in<br>
one or more parts thereof, have a particle size of 50<br>
to 500 Âµm, and may be an aggregate having particles of<br>
 1 to 50 Âµm having a structure formed by indenting a<br>
sphere or an oval in one or more parts thereof, as<br>
particles adhered to a part of the exterior of the<br>
aggregate.<br><br><br>
The starch particles constituting the<br>
functional starch powder of the invention are<br>
preferably non-crystalline. The starch particles can<br>
be judged to be crystalline or non-crystalline by a<br>
 polarization image (magnification: 10) under an optical<br>
microscope. When the starch particles are crystalline,<br>
a light polarization image (for example, an image<br>
called "crisscross observed by polarization microscope"<br>
in the case of raw starch) appears.<br>
	The bulk density of the functional starch<br>
powder of the invention is preferably in the range of<br>
0.1 to 0.70 g/cm3, more preferably 0.15 to 0.70 g/cm3,<br>
and most preferably 0.20 to 0.70 g/cm3. When the bulk<br>
density is less than 0.1 g/cm3, the fluidity is low, so<br>
 that segregation by weight is undesirably caused when a<br>
composition comprising the functional starch powder and<br>
an active ingredient(s) is tablets. On the other hand,<br>
when the bulk density is more than 0.70 g/cm3, the<br>
moldability of the composition is deteriorated, so that<br>
 a suitable practical hardness is undesirably<br>
unattainable. The viscosity of the functional starch<br>
powder of the invention is preferably 1000 mPa.s or<br>
less, more preferably 500 mPa.s or less, and most<br>
preferably 400 mPa.s or less, in an aqueous solution of<br>
 2% concentration at 25Â°C. When the viscosity is more<br>
than 1000 mPa.s, handling of the functional starch<br>
powder undesirably becomes troublesome when the<br>
functional starch powder is added in the form of an<br><br><br>
aqueous solution. The lower limit of the viscosity is<br>
preferably as close to the viscosity of water of 1<br>
mPa.s as possible.<br>
A method for producing the functional starch<br>
 powder of the invention is described below.<br>
The functional starch powder of the invention<br>
is produced through a step of heating a starch raw<br>
material in the presence of water at 60 to 150Â°C to<br>
swell some or all of starch particles of the starch raw<br>
 material and a step of drying the resulting swollen<br>
starch particles to obtain a powder mixture including<br>
starch particles with an indentation in one or more<br>
parts and amylose and amylopectin which are present in<br>
the exteriors of these starch particles.<br>
 	The starch raw material referred to herein is<br>
not particularly limited so long as it contains a<br>
starch material such as natural starch, aged starch or<br>
crosslinked starch of rice, glutinous rice, corn, waxy<br>
corn, amiro corn, sorghum, wheat, barley, taro, green<br>
 gram, potato, lily, dogtooth violet, tulip, canna, pea,<br>
shiwa pea, chestnut, arrowroot, yam, sweet potato,<br>
broad bean, snap bean, sago, tapioca (cassava),<br>
bracken, lotus, water caltrop or the like. Potato is<br>
preferred because its starch particles have a high<br>
 swelling property, so that the water retention capacity<br>
can easily be controlled to be high.<br>
A material obtained by subjecting a starch<br>
raw material to wet heat treatment such as heat<br><br><br>
treatment at 100 to 130Â°C under reduced pressure is<br>
discussed in JP-A-4-130102 or JP-A-7-25902 and is<br>
preferred because when such a material is used, the<br>
gelatinization initiation temperature is raised, so<br>
 that the swelling properties of particles are enhanced.<br>
That is, JP-A-4-130102 discusses (1) a method in which<br>
starch is placed in a sealable container resistant to<br>
both internal and external pressures and having both a<br>
pressure-reducing line and a pressurized steam line<br>
 attached, and the pressure is reduced, followed by<br>
application of pressure and heat by steam introduction,<br>
or the above procedure is repeated, whereby the starch<br>
is heated for a predetermined time, and then the heated<br>
starch is cooled. JP-A-4-130102 discusses (2) a method<br>
 according to (1), wherein by adjusting the temperature<br>
in a can to at least 120Â°C, starch having a very high Î±-<br>
amylase adsorption capability is produced, which is<br>
that when an aqueous suspension of the starch is<br>
heated, it has substantially no viscosity though starch<br>
 particles expand. JP-A-4-130102 describes a method<br>
according to (1) and (2), wherein cooling is conducted<br>
under reduced pressure after the heating. JP-A-7-25902<br>
discusses, for example, (1) a method for producing wet-<br>
heat-treated starch grains obtained by wet heat<br>
 treatment of starch grains, which includes repeating at<br>
least once a first step of subjecting starch grains<br>
charged into a pressure container to pressure reduction<br>
and a second step of introducing steam into the<br><br><br>
container to conduct heating and pressurizing, after<br>
the pressure reduction; and (2) a production method<br>
according to (1), wherein in the above second step, the<br>
heating is conducted at 80Â°C or higher for 5 minutes to<br>
 5 hours. Thus, the wet-heat-treated starch is composed<br>
of particles each of which has a hollow interior and a<br>
shell having an increased crystallinity. It is<br>
characterized in that a polarization crisscross pattern<br>
observed as a polarization image under an optical<br>
 microscope is vaguer than that observed in the case of<br>
raw starch, namely, non-birefringent particles are<br>
decreased. The hollow portion seems to have a<br>
structure formed by the loosening of the crystalline<br>
states of amylose and amylopectin, and the treated<br>
 starch is characterized in that its digestibility with<br>
Î±-amylase is higher than that of raw starch. The<br>
viscosity of an emulsion of the wet-heat-treated starch<br>
adjusted to 5% concentration is preferably 400<br>
Brabender units (BU) or less during heating from 50Â°C to<br>
 95Â°C, and the maximum viscosity of the emulsion is<br>
preferably 1000 BU or less when the emulsion is<br>
maintained at 95Â°C for 30 minutes. As the starch raw<br>
material, one or a mixture of two or more of the above-<br>
exemplified materials may be freely used. The size of<br>
 particles of the starch raw material is preferably as<br>
large as possible from the viewpoint of ease of<br>
expanding.<br>
The term "in the presence of water" used<br><br><br>
herein with respect to the starch raw material means a<br>
state in which the starch raw material and water are<br>
present and the water content is 40% by weight or more.<br>
A method for heating in the invention is not<br>
 particularly limited so long as it is a well-known<br>
method. As the method, one embodiment is a method of<br>
placing the starch raw. material in the presence of<br>
water in a jacketed reactor and introducing steam into<br>
the reactor to heat the starch raw material; a method<br>
 of mixing the starch raw material in the presence of<br>
water with steam; a method of heating the starch raw<br>
material in the reservoir of a drum dryer; and a method<br>
of carrying out gelatinization and spraying at the same<br>
time during spray drying while supplying steam to a<br>
 starch slurry. The method of mixing the starch raw<br>
material in the presence of water with steam is<br>
preferable because it facilitates the assurance of time<br>
for heating starch particles. The heating temperature<br>
is any temperature so long as the temperature of a<br>
 liquid obtained by the gelatinization of starch by the<br>
above methods is 60 to 150Â°C, preferably 90 to 140Â°C,<br>
more preferably 90 to 130Â°C, and most preferably 100 to<br>
120Â°C.<br>
The functional starch powder of the invention<br>
 should be produced by heating the starch raw material<br>
in the presence of water at 60 to 150Â°C to swell some or<br>
all of starch particles of the starch raw material at a<br>
volume ratio of 10 or more. The term "volume ratio" is<br><br><br>
defined as [b/a]3 when the average particle sizes before<br>
and after the swelling are taken as a (Âµm) and b (Âµm) ,<br>
respectively. The average particle size referred to<br>
here is calculated by summing up the maximum diameters<br>
 m (Âµn) of individual particles observed under an<br>
optical microscope (magnification: 10, OPTIPHOT-POL<br>
mfd. by Nikon) and dividing the sum by the number (n)<br>
of particles subjected to the measurement (Î£m/n). When<br>
starch particles constituting the starch raw material<br>
 is heated in the presence of water, they expand near a<br>
gelatinization initiation temperature intrinsic to the<br>
starch particles. During the swelling, in the starch<br>
particles of the starch raw material, the hydrogen<br>
bonds of amylose and amylopectin, which constitute the<br>
 shells of the starch particles, are destroyed by the<br>
heating, and water intrudes into the interiors of the<br>
starch particles, so that amylose and amylopectin in<br>
the interiors of the particles are decreased in<br>
molecular weight by heat to be released to the<br>
 exteriors of the starch particles. The ratio between<br>
amylose and amylopectin is intrinsic to the kind of the<br>
starch raw material (the amylose content of potato<br>
starch is about 25%). The ratio between amylose and<br>
amylopectin is not changed even after they are released<br>
 to the exteriors of the starch particles. It is<br>
inferred that the molecular weight distribution is<br>
shifted to a low molecular weight side.<br>
Whether or not amylose and amylopectin, which<br><br><br>
constitute the interiors of the particles, have been<br>
released to the exteriors of the particles during the<br>
expansion can be confirmed by a photomicrograph<br>
(magnification: 20 to 30) by adding several drops of a<br>
 1/50 to 1/200 normality iodine solution to a suspension<br>
of starch subjected to the swelling treatment by<br>
heating. In the field of vision of the<br>
photomicrograph, portions stained blue other than the<br>
starch particles are amylose and amylopectin released<br>
 from the interiors of the particles. When the starch<br>
particles expand and then dried, a mixture of starch<br>
particles and amylose and amylopectin released to the<br>
exteriors of the particles from the interiors is dried<br>
to become powder. When the amount of expanded or<br>
 dissolved amylose and amylopectin defined herein is<br>
measured in the resulting dry powder, it can be<br>
confirmed that the amount of amylose and amylopectin<br>
released to the exteriors of the starch particles<br>
ranges from 10 to 90% by weight.<br>
 	When the swelling of the starch particles is<br>
insufficient, the volume ratio in the swelling cannot<br>
be 10 or more and the amount of amylose and amylopectin<br>
released to the exteriors of the starch particles<br>
becomes less than 10%, so that no satisfactory release-<br>
 sustaining properties can be exhibited. This is not<br>
desirable. In addition, unless such starch particles<br>
are added in a large amount of more than 10% like<br>
partly pregelatinized starch, it becomes difficult to<br><br><br>
bind an active ingredient(s) to other additives, which<br>
is not desirable. An example of such starch particles<br>
is partly pregelatinized starch such as the starch<br>
particles of Comparative Example 5. As to the shape of<br>
 such starch particles after drying, indented particles<br>
having a particle size of less than 50 pm are observed<br>
in only a small amount, and most of the starch<br>
particles become an aggregate in which indented<br>
particles of less than 50 pm are aggregated to such an<br>
 extent that the boundary surfaces among constituent<br>
particles are not clear. Such an aggregate has a size<br>
of 50 to 100 pm but is utterly different from the<br>
functional starch particles of the invention because<br>
its particles cannot be distinguished from one another<br>
 as individual particles having clear boundary surfaces<br>
among them.<br>
The upper limit of the volume ratio in the<br>
swelling is at most 400, preferably 100, though it<br>
varies depending on the starch raw material. When the<br>
 volume ratio is more than 400, amylose and amylopectin,<br>
which form the shell structure of starch, are also<br>
expanded to be dispersed as molecules and are gradually<br>
dissolved and released to the exteriors of starch<br>
particles, so that the starch particles themselves<br>
 disappear. Therefore, the amount of amylose and<br>
amylopectin, which are present in the exteriors of the<br>
particles, exceeds 90% based on the total amount of the<br>
starch particles, so that no sufficient gel strength is<br><br><br>
attained, and moreover, the resistance to Î±-amylase is<br>
lost, so that no sufficient release-sustaining<br>
capability is exhibited. This is not desirable. When<br>
the starch particles become unable to retain the shape<br>
 of their shell structures and substantially all of them<br>
become amylose and amylopectin that can expand or<br>
dissolved in water, they become flaky or massive<br>
crystalline particles (showing a polarization image in<br>
a photomicrograph) after drying, for example, because<br>
 swollen or dissolved amylose and amylopectin become Î²-<br>
amylose and Î²-amylopectin. Such particles are clearly<br>
different from starch particles constituting the<br>
functional starch powder of the invention.<br>
In the case of the functional starch powder<br>
 of the invention, starch particles are swollen by a<br>
volume ratio of 10 or more by heating, so that the<br>
particle size of the swollen starch particles after<br>
drying is 50 to 500 Âµm. Although a method for drying<br>
is not particularly limited, it includes, for example,<br>
 freeze-drying, spray drying, drum drying, tray drying,<br>
air-drying, vacuum drying, and drying by solvent<br>
replacement. Industrially, spray drying and drum<br>
drying are preferred. The solid content of a liquid at<br>
the time of the drying is approximately 0.5% to 60%.<br>
 When the solid content is less than 0.5%, the<br>
productivity is undesirably deteriorated. When the<br>
solid content is 60% or more, the viscosity becomes<br>
high, so that the yield is undesirably decreased. The<br><br><br>
solid content is preferably 1 to 30%, more preferably 1<br>
to 20%.<br>
When 1 g of the functional starch powder of<br>
the invention is dispersed in 100 cm3 of pure water and<br>
 stands for 16 hours, the lower layer portion of the<br>
dispersion separated into upper and lower layers is<br>
observed under an optical microscope (magnification:<br>
 10), it is preferable that the shell structure inherent<br>
in a starch raw material for the functional starch<br>
 powder is completely present without loss thereof. The<br>
functional starch powder of the invention is<br>
essentially different from a starch where nothing is<br>
observed in the above-mentioned lower layer portion, or<br>
a starch which has a flaky, massive or the shell-like<br>
 structure formed by the conversion of swollen or<br>
dissolved amylose and amylopectin to Î²-amylose and (Î²-<br>
amylopectin in the lower layer portion.<br>
For imparting release-sustaining properties,<br>
resistance to Î±-amylase and resistance to ionic<br>
 strength, the amount of amylose and amylopectin, each<br>
of which is present in a swollen or dissolved state,<br>
should be in a definite range. The term "swollen or<br>
dissolved amylose and amylopectin" means amylose and<br>
amylopectin expanded or dissolved by heating of a<br>
 starch raw material in the presence of water that are<br>
so transparent or semitransparent that their shapes<br>
cannot be observed under an optical microscope. Their<br>
amount (% by weight) can be determined by dispersing 1<br><br><br>
g of starch powder in 100 cm3 of pure water, allowing<br>
the resulting dispersion to stand for 16 hours and<br>
calculating the amount from the volume of the upper<br>
layer portion of the dispersion separated into upper<br>
 and lower layers and the weight of solids in 30 cm3 of<br>
the upper layer (the volume (cm3) of the upper layer<br>
portion Ã· 30 x the weight (g/cm3) of solids in 30 cm3 of<br>
the upper layer Ã· the dry weight (g) of 1 g of the<br>
starch x 100). The amount in the case of the starch<br>
 powder of the invention ranges from 10 to 90% by<br>
weight. When the amount is less than 10% by weight,<br>
the water retention is insufficient, so that no<br>
release-sustaining properties are exhibited. This is<br>
not desirable. When the amount is more than 90% by<br>
 weight, the water retention is lowered, so that the<br>
resistance to Î±-amylase, release-sustaining capability<br>
and resistance to ionic strength are undesirably<br>
deteriorated.<br>
When the amount of swollen or dissolved<br>
 amylose and amylopectin is controlled to be within the<br>
above range, the shell structures of starch particles<br>
are not completely lost and can be clearly observed in<br>
the lower layer portion in the above-mentioned<br>
measurement. The term "degree of swelling" is defined<br>
 as the volume of the lower layer portion of a<br>
dispersion separated into upper and lower layers which<br>
is obtained by dispersing 1 g of starch powder in 100<br>
cm3 of pure water, followed by standing for 16 hours.<br><br><br>
The degree of swelling of the functional starch powder<br>
of the invention is approximately 0.5 cm3 to 60 cm3 and<br>
is preferably 10 cm3 to 50 cm3.<br>
Pregelatinized starch and partly<br>
 pregelatinized starch, which are used mainly in<br>
medicines, are obtained by gelatinizing natural starch<br>
by heating and then drying the gelatinized starch. As<br>
described in JP-B-59-47600, starch with excellent<br>
disintegrating properties can be obtained with starch<br>
 mostly composed of particles with a shell structure and<br>
inhibited as much as possible from releasing swollen<br>
amylose and amylopectin by dissolution by heating at a<br>
temperature, which is above 50Â°C and below a temperature<br>
about 10Â°C higher than an intrinsic gelatinization<br>
 initiation temperature (which is a temperature lower<br>
than 90Â°C though depending on the kind of starch) .<br>
However, although such starch includes particles with a<br>
shell structure, the particle size of a single swollen<br>
particle in the starch is less than 50 Âµm and<br>
 sufficient water retention is impossible because of the<br>
insufficient swelling in water, or because of the<br>
amount of swollen amylose and amylopectin is<br>
insufficient which results in an insufficient gel<br>
indentation load. Therefore, such starch does not<br>
 exhibit release-sustaining properties.<br>
Pregelatinized starch used mainly in food is<br>
produced by a method such as drum drying at about 150Â°C<br>
or extrusion with an extruder at 120 to 160Â°C under high<br><br><br>
pressure. In pregelatinized starch obtained by such a<br>
method, its particles are excessively swollen because<br>
of too high a gelatinization temperature, almost no<br>
particles having a shell structure are present, and its<br>
 particles have a flaky or massive shape different from<br>
a shell structure inherent in starch particles, which<br>
is the same as a flaky, massive or the like structure<br>
formed by the conversion of swollen amylose and<br>
amylopectin to (3-amylose and (Î²-amylopectin. That is,<br>
 in conventional pregelatinized starch, swollen or<br>
dissolved amylose and amylopectin and flaky or massive<br>
particles formed by the conversion to [Î²-amylose and Î²-<br>
amylopectin are present at the same time, and only the<br>
flaky or massive particles have a visually confirmable<br>
 shape. Starch particles composed mainly of amylose and<br>
amylopectin swollen with loss of the shell structures<br>
by such excessive gelatinization are not desirable<br>
because they have a low gel indentation load and a low<br>
resistance to Î±-amylase and do not exhibit release-<br>
 sustaining capability and resistance to ionic strength.<br>
That is, the functional starch powder of the<br>
invention is produced by heating a starch raw material<br>
at 60 to 150Â°C to swell starch particles at a volume<br>
ratio of 10 or more and then drying the swollen starch<br>
 particles to obtain a powder mixture including starch<br>
particles and, lying in the exterior thereof, amylose<br>
and amylopectin. Surprisingly, the functional starch<br>
powder obtained by such a production process has a high<br><br><br>
resistance to Î±-amylase, a high resistance to ionic<br>
strength and a sufficient release-sustaining<br>
capability, which are not possessed by conventional<br>
pregelatinized starch and partly pregelatinized starch.<br>
 	The composition of the invention including<br>
the functional starch powder and one or more active<br>
ingredients can be used for controlling the<br>
concentration of the active ingredient (s) in the fields<br>
of medicines, agrochemicals, fertilizers, feed, food,<br>
 industry, cosmetics, etc. The amount of the starch<br>
powder of the invention incorporated into the<br>
composition is approximately 0.1 to 99.99% by weight.<br>
When the amount is less than 0.1% by weight, the<br>
concentrate of the starch powder of the invention is<br>
 not controlled. When the amount is more than 99.99% by<br>
weight, a sufficient amount of the active ingredient(s)<br>
cannot be added, so that the therapeutic effect,<br>
efficacy and the like of the active ingredient(s)<br>
cannot be expected. The starch powder of the invention<br>
 is usually used in the range of 0.5 to 95% by weight,<br>
preferably about 0.5 to about 90% by weight.<br>
The active ingredient(s) referred to herein<br>
includes the following, but is not limited to:<br>
pharmaceutically active ingredients, agrochemical<br>
 ingredients, ingredients for fertilizer, ingredients<br>
for feed, ingredients for food, ingredients for<br>
cosmetic, coloring maters, flavoring materials, metals,<br>
ceramics, catalysts, surfactants and the like. The<br><br><br>
active ingredient (s) may be in the form of any of<br>
powder, crystals, oil, a liquid, a semisolid and the<br>
like. The shape may be any of powder, fine granules,<br>
granules and the like. The active ingredient(s) may be<br>
 coated to control the rate of dissolution, to reduce<br>
bitterness, or the like. The above-exemplified active<br>
ingredients may be used alone or in combination. As<br>
the active ingredient(s), the pharmaceutically active<br>
ingredients are the most preferable.<br>
 	For example, for the pharmaceutically active<br>
ingredients orally administrable drugs such as<br>
antipyretic analgesic antiphlogistics, hypnotic<br>
sedatives, sleepiness inhibitors, dinics, infant<br>
analgesics, stomachics, antacids, digestives,<br>
 cardiotonics, drugs for arrhythmia, hypotensive drugs,<br>
vasodilators, diuretics, antiulcer drugs, drugs for<br>
controlling intestinal function, therapeutic drugs for<br>
osteoporosis, antitussive expectorants, antasthmatics,<br>
antibacterials, drugs for pollakiuria, tonics, vitamin<br>
 preparations, and the like can be used. These active<br>
ingredients may freely be used alone or in combination.<br>
One of the functions of the functional starch<br>
powder of the invention is its ability to control the<br>
release of the active ingredient(s) in the composition<br>
 including the functional starch powder and the active<br>
ingredient(s). Here, the phrase "control the release<br>
of the active ingredient(s)" means controlling the<br>
release so that the amount of the active ingredient(s)<br><br><br>
released by the composition in a liquid medium may be<br>
in a definite range at intervals of a definite tine; or<br>
releasing the whole of the active ingredient(s) Within<br>
a definite time. The phrase "controlling the release<br>
 so that the amount of the active ingredient(s) may be<br>
in a definite range at intervals of a definite time"<br>
means that for example, when the whole of the acnive<br>
ingredient(s) is released in 10 to 12 hours, the<br>
release is controlled so that the rate of release by<br>
 dissolution measured according to the release-by-<br>
dissolution test method, which is the second method<br>
(paddle method) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia<br>
(14th revision) may be 20 to 40% after 1 hour, 40 to 60%<br>
after 5 hours, and 70% or more after 7 hours. In<br>
 addition, when the whole of the active ingredient(s) is<br>
released in a long time such as 12 to 240 hours, it is<br>
also possible to control the release by properly<br>
lengthening the intervals of 1, 5 and 7 hours. The<br>
phrase "releasing the whole of the active ingredient(s)<br>
 within a definite time" means that the whole of the<br>
active ingredient(s) is released in a short time such<br>
as 30 minutes. Here, although the term "the whole"<br>
means the whole of the theoretical amount of the active<br>
ingredient(s) added, the release is considered as the<br>
 release of the whole when the amount of the active<br>
ingredient(s) released is in the range of 95 to 105%,<br>
inclusive of analysis errors.<br>
In the case of the functional starch powder<br><br><br>
of the invention, there are two possible, seemingly<br>
different, ways to control the rate of dissolution, as<br>
described above. By these ways of controlling the<br>
release by dissolution, the so-called sustained-release<br>
 effect, an effect of controlling the release so that<br>
the amount of the active ingredient (s) released may be<br>
in a definite range at intervals of a definite time,<br>
can be obtained (in other words, a sustained-release<br>
composition containing the functional starch powder of<br>
 the present invention can be obtained) by incorporating<br>
the functional starch powder into the composition in an<br>
amount of, for example, approximately 10 to 95% by<br>
weight based on the weight of the composition. In<br>
addition, the so-called rapid-release effect, an effect<br>
 of releasing the whole of the active ingredient(s)<br>
within a definite time can be obtained (in other words,<br>
a rapid-release composition containing the functional<br>
starch powder of the present invention can be obtained)<br>
by incorporating the functional starch powder into the<br>
 composition in an amount of, for example, approximately<br>
0.1 to 5% by weight based on the weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
The active ingredient(s) and optionally other<br>
additives can be granulated by a well-known wet<br>
 granulation method such as high-speed stirring<br>
granulation, extrusion granulation or fluidized-bed<br>
granulation. In this case, when the functional starch<br>
of the invention is used in the composition in an<br><br><br>
amount of approximately 0.1 to 10% by weight,<br>
preferably approximately 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the composition, the amount of<br>
amylose and amylopectin, each of which is in a swollen<br>
 or dissolved state, is in a specified range, so that it<br>
becomes possible to bind the active ingredient(s) and<br>
optionally other additives to the functional starch.<br>
Moreover, granules having an average particle size in<br>
the range of 50 to 500 urn can be obtained.<br>
 Furthermore, a sufficient hardness can be imparted to a<br>
composition obtained by compression-molding the<br>
obtained granules by a well-known method. When a<br>
comparison is made at the same adding amount, the<br>
functional starch powder of the present invention can<br>
 impart a higher hardness than do cellulose derivatives<br>
such as hydroxypropyl cellulose. The functional starch<br>
powder of the invention gives a sharp particle size<br>
distribution when used either in the form of powder or<br>
in the form of a suspension, solution or semi-solution<br>
 in a medium such as water. For obtaining granules<br>
having a sharper particle size distribution, the<br>
functional starch powder is preferably used in the form<br>
of powder.<br>
In addition, the functional starch powder is<br>
 advantageous in that it includes starch particles with<br>
a particle size of 50 to 500 urn having a structure<br>
formed by indenting a sphere or an oval in one or more<br>
parts thereof, so that when the granules are compressed<br><br><br>
into tablets, the disintegration time of the tablets<br>
having a practical hardness of 40N or more can be<br>
reduced because the starch particles are swollen in<br>
water. In the case of a conventional binder such as a<br>
 cellulose derivative (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose),<br>
when its amount is increased, coarse particles are<br>
formed, so that the average diameter of granules is<br>
increased. As a result, the disintegration of tablets<br>
obtained by compressing such granules is slowed.<br>
 Therefore, the diameter of granules should be set at a<br>
suitable diameter. The functional starch powder of the<br>
invention is advantageous in that even when its adding<br>
amount is increased, it can be granulated without<br>
remarkable increase of the average diameter of<br>
 granules, so that the disintegration of tablets<br>
obtained by compressing such granules is not slowed.<br>
Most of pregelatinized starches in use as a binder are<br>
completely gelatinized starches and do not include<br>
starch particles with a particle size of 50 to 500 Âµm<br>
 having a structure formed by indenting a sphere or an<br>
oval in one or more parts according to the inventon.<br>
Therefore, they have been disadvantageous in that the<br>
disintegration of tablets obtained by compressing<br>
granules is slow. They have been disadvantageous<br>
 particularly in that the disintegration is slowed with<br>
the lapse of time because they contain a large amount<br>
of gelatinized amylose and amylopectin.<br>
If necessary, the composition of the<br><br><br>
invention may contain other components such as<br>
disintegrating agents, binders, fluidizing agents,<br>
lubricants, correctives, flavoring materials, coloring<br>
matters, sweeteners, etc. besides the active<br>
 ingredient(s) and the functional starch powder. The<br>
other components may be used as a diluent.<br>
The binders are not particularly limited and<br>
include, for example, sugars such as sucrose, glucose,<br>
lactose, fructose, trehalose, etc.; sugar alcohols such<br>
 as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, erythritol, sorbitol,<br>
etc; water-soluble polysaccharides such as gelatin,<br>
pullulan, carrageenan, locust bean gum, agar, konjak<br>
mannan, xanthan gum, tamarind gum, pectin, sodium<br>
alginate, gum arabic, etc.; celluloses such as<br>
 crystalline celluloses (e.g. "Avicel" PH-101, PH-101D,<br>
PH-101L, PH-102, PH-301, PH-301Z, PH-302, PH-F20, PH-<br>
M06, M15, M25, "Ceolus" KG-801 and KG-802, manufactured<br>
by Asahi Kasei Corp.), powdered cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, etc.;<br>
 starches such as pregelatinized starch, starch paste,<br>
etc.; synthetic polymers such as<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidone)s, carboxyvinyl polymers,<br>
poly(vinyl alcohol)s, etc.; and inorganic compounds<br>
such as calcium hydrogenphosphate, calcium carbonate,<br>
 synthetic hydrotalcite, magnesium aluminate silicate,<br>
etc. These binders may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
The crystalline celluloses usable as the<br><br><br>
binder are preferably those having an excellent<br>
compactibility. Use of the crystalline cellulose<br>
having an excellent compactibility permics compression<br>
into tablets at a low striking pressure. Therefore,<br>
 granule-containing tablets can be obtained which permit<br>
retention of the activity of an active ingredient(s)<br>
that is inactivated by striking pressure. Moreover, a<br>
high hardness can be imparted by adding a small amount<br>
of such crystalline cellulose, and hence, a bulky<br>
 active ingredient(s) or a drug containing various kinds<br>
of active ingredients can be made into tablets. Such<br>
crystalline cellulose is advantageous, for example, in<br>
that in some cases, it permits reduction of the size of<br>
tablets, is excellent in ability to support a liquid<br>
 component and can suppress hindrances in compression<br>
into tablets.<br>
The disintegrating agents are not<br>
particularly limited and include, for example,<br>
celluloses such as sodium croscarmellose, carmellose,<br>
 calcium carmellose, sodium carmellose, low-substituted<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, etc.; starches such as sodium<br>
carboxymethyl starch, hydroxypropyl starch, rice<br>
starch, wheat starch, corn starch, potato starch,<br>
partly pregelatinized starch, etc.; celluloses such as<br>
 crystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, etc.; and<br>
synthetic polymers such as crospovidone, crospovidone<br>
copolymers, etc. These disintegrating agents may be<br>
used alone or in combination.<br><br><br>
The fluidizing agents are not particularly<br>
limited and include silicon compounds such as hydrated<br>
silicon dioxide, light silicic anhydride, etc. These<br>
fluidizing agents may be used alone or in combination.<br>
 	The lubricants are not particularly limited<br>
and include magnesium stearate, calcium stearate,<br>
stearic acid, sucrose fatty acid esters, talc, etc.<br>
These lubricants may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The correctives are not particularly limited<br>
 and include glutamic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid,<br>
citric acid, sodium citrate, tartaric acid, malic acid,<br>
ascorbic acid, sodium chloride, 1-menthol, etc. These<br>
correctives may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The flavoring materials are not particularly<br>
 limited and include orange, vanilla, strawberry,<br>
yogurt, menthol, oils (e.g. fennel oil, cinnamon oil,<br>
orange-peel oil and peppermint oil), green tea powder,<br>
etc. These flavoring materials may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
 	The coloring matters are not particularly<br>
limited and include food colors (e.g. food red No. 3,<br>
food yellow No. 5 and food blue No. 11), copper<br>
chlorophyllin sodium, titanium oxide, riboflavin, etc.<br>
These coloring maters may be used alone or in<br>
 combination.<br>
The sweeteners are not particularly limited<br>
and include aspartame, saccharin, glycyrrhizic acid<br>
dipotassium salt, stevia, maltose, maltitol, thick malt<br><br><br>
syrup, powdered sweet hydrangea, etc. These sweeteners<br>
may be used alone or in combination.<br>
When the composition is used as a medicine,<br>
the composition includes, for example, solid<br>
 pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets, powders,<br>
fine granules, granules, extracts and pills. They can<br>
be produced by well-known methods such as extrusion<br>
granulation, crushing granulation, fluidized-layer<br>
granulation, high-speed stirring granulation, tumbling<br>
 flow granulation and the like. The composition may be<br>
utilized not only as medicines but also as foods (e.g.<br>
confectionery, health food, texture improvers and<br>
dietary fiber supplements), solid foundations, bath<br>
agents, animal drugs, diagnostic drugs, agrochemicals,<br>
 fertilizers, ceramic catalysts and the like.<br>
As an example of the composition, tablets are<br>
preferably prepared from the viewpoint of productivity,<br>
the ease of administration/ingestion and the ease of<br>
handling. The tablets are obtained by a direct<br>
 tableting method, dry granule compression method, wet<br>
granule compression method, wet granule compression<br>
(extragranular addition of MCC) or the like. Although<br>
the tablets may be multi-core tablets containing, as<br>
inner cores, tablets previously obtained by compression<br>
 molding, they are preferably, in particular, tablets<br>
obtained by direct tabletting, from the viewpoint of<br>
cost and ease.<br>
The composition of the invention makes it<br><br><br>
possible to impart sustained-release properties to<br>
pharmaceutical preparations by a simple method<br>
including mixing one or more active ingredients with<br>
the functional starch powder of the invention and<br>
 formulating the mixture into tablets, a powder,<br>
granules, fine granules or the like using a known<br>
method. Therefore, troublesome operations such as<br>
coating of granules or tablets with a coating agent and<br>
the time and the labor required for the assurance of<br>
 production conditions for a constant quality are<br>
unnecessary. Thus, the composition is useful also from<br>
the viewpoint of cost and productivity.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations containing the<br>
functional starch powder of the invention may have a<br>
 coating for taste masking, dampproofing or the like. A<br>
coating agent is not particularly limited and includes,<br>
for example, cellulose type coating agents (e.g. ethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate,<br>
carboxymethylethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
 cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate<br>
succinate, cellulose acetate phthalate and cellulose<br>
acetate), acrylic polymer type coating agents (e.g.<br>
Eudragit RS, Eudragit L and Eudragit NE), shellac and<br>
silicone resins. These coating agents may be used<br>
 alone or in combination. As a method for using these<br>
coating agents, a well-known method can be adopted.<br>
The coating agents may be dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent or suspended in water. A suspension of the<br><br><br>
coating agent in water may be granulated together with<br>
a pharmaceutically active ingredient(s) and other<br>
components.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations containing<br>
 the functional starch powder of the invention include<br>
those which permit sustained release of an active<br>
ingredient(s) by diffusion from a gel layer formed from<br>
only the functional starch powder of the invention or a<br>
gel layer formed substantially from the functional<br>
 starch powder of the invention used in combination with<br>
another release-sustaining base ingredient. These<br>
pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by well-<br>
known methods such as mixing, stirring, granulation,<br>
particle size regulation, tabletting, etc. The phrase<br>
 "formed substantially from the functional starch powder<br>
of the invention" means that the functional starch<br>
powder of the invention is incorporated into the<br>
pharmaceutical preparation in order to endow the<br>
pharmaceutical preparation with the various functions<br>
 of the functional starch powder of the invention, such<br>
as a function of increasing the resistance to Î±-<br>
amylase, a function of enhancing the sustained-release<br>
capability and a function of assuring the sustained-<br>
release capability in a medium having a high ionic<br>
 strength. For example, if formulation into a<br>
pharmaceutical form and the impartment of sustained-<br>
release properties can be achieved by the addition of<br>
the functional starch powder of the invention in a case<br><br><br>
where a release-sustaining base ingredient such as<br>
HPMC, methyl cellulose, HPC or the like is co-used<br>
which does not bring about a sufficient sustained-<br>
release effect under a high ionic strength, the<br>
 achievement can be considered to be attributable to the<br>
effect of the functional starch powder of the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention is illustrated in detail with<br>
the following examples, which should not be construed<br>
 as limiting the scope of the invention. Methods for<br>
measuring physical properties in the examples and<br>
comparative examples are as follows.<br>
(1) Volume ratio<br>
The term "volume ratio" is defined as [b/a]3<br>
 when average particle sizes before and after swelling<br>
are taken as a (Âµm) and b (Âµm) , respectively. The<br>
average particle size referred to here is calculated by<br>
summing up the maximum diameters "m" -(Âµm) of individual<br>
particles observed under an optical microscope<br>
 (magnification: 10, OPTIPHOT-POL mfd. by Nikon) and<br>
dividing the sum by the number "n" of particles<br>
subjected to the measurement (Î£m/n). The average<br>
particle size is calculated for each of the following:<br>
starch particles before swelling, and starch particles<br>
 swollen by heating at 60 to 150Â°C.<br>
(2) Water retention capacity (%)<br>
Wo (g) (about 1 g) of dried starch powder is<br>
placed in small portions in a 50-ml centrifuge tube<br><br><br>
containing about 15 ml of pure water and dispersed in<br>
the pure water while stirring until the dispersion<br>
becomes transparent or semitransparent. Pure water was<br>
added to fill the 50-ml centrifuge tube about 70% full<br>
 therewith, followed by centrifugation (2000G, 10<br>
minutes). After completion of the centrifugation, the<br>
separated upper layer is immediately discarded and then<br>
the water retention capacity is calculated from the<br>
weight W (g) of the residue as the lower layer (the<br>
 total weight of starch and pure water retained by the<br>
starch) by the following equation:<br>
Water retention capacity(%) = 100 x [W - Wo] /<br>
Wo<br>
(3) Collapse time (hr)<br>
 	The term "collapse time" is defined as the<br>
disintegration time, in a test solution, of a<br>
cylindrical molded article with a diameter of 0.8 cm<br>
obtained by compressing 0.2 g of starch powder at 50<br>
MPa. The test solution is the second solution (pH 6.8)<br>
 described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (14th revision,<br>
p. 204) and a disintegration test is carried out by the<br>
use of an auxiliary plate according to the<br>
disintegration test method described in the Japanese<br>
Pharmacopoeia (14th revision).<br>
 (4) Gel indentation load (g)<br>
The term "gel indentation load" is defined as<br>
a maximum load applied when a cylindrical adapter is<br>
pressed for 3 mm at a rate of 0.1 mm/sec with a<br><br><br>
rheometer (RHEONER, RE-33005, mfd. by YAMADEN) into a<br>
gel obtained by immersing, for 4 hours in pure water, a<br>
cylindrical molded article with a diameter of 1.13 cm<br>
obtained by compressing 0.5 g of starch powder at 50<br>
 MPa. The term "maximum load" means the following: when<br>
a gel layer is broken, the term means a maximum load<br>
value at the time of the breaking; and when the gel<br>
layer is not broken, the term means a maximum load<br>
value, which the adapter applies before it intrudes for<br>
 5 mm into the gelled cylindrical molded article. The<br>
maximum load is calculated as the average of five<br>
measurements.<br>
(5) Amount (% by weight) of swollen or dissolved<br>
amylose and amylopectin<br>
 	The amount of swollen or dissolved amylose<br>
and amylopectin is determined by dispersing about 1 g<br>
of dried starch powder in 100 cm3 of pure water, allowing<br>
the resulting dispersion to stand for 16 hours,<br>
calculating the volume of the upper layer portion of<br>
 the dispersion separated into upper and lower layers<br>
and the weight percentage of solids in 30 cm3 of the<br>
upper layer, and calculating the amount by the<br>
following equation:<br>
The amount (% by weight) of swollen or<br>
 dissolved amylose and amylopectin = the volume (cm3) of<br>
the upper layer portion Ã· 30 x the weight (g/cm3) of<br>
solids in 30 cm3 of the upper layer Ã· the dry weight (g)<br>
of the starch powder x 100<br><br><br>
(6) Particle size (Âµm) of starch particles<br>
The term "particle size of starch particles"<br>
is defined as the maximum diameter of a single particle<br>
when the starch particles are observed at a<br>
 magnification of 200 to 1500 by the use of SEM (JEOL<br>
JSM-5510LV, mfd by JEOL LTD.; vapor deposition of Pt;<br>
JEOL JFC-1600 AUTO FINE COATER, mfd by JEOL LTD.). If<br>
single particles aggregate, then the diameter of the<br>
multi-particle aggregate is not considered in the<br>
 particle size evaluation. However, even if particles<br>
are aggregated, their diameters can be considered as<br>
the particle size referred to when the boundary<br>
surfaces among the particles are clear and the maximum<br>
diameter of the single particle is clear because of,<br>
 for example, the small size of the aggregated<br>
particles. The reason is that the maximum diameter of<br>
a single particle among them is precise.<br>
(7)	Degree of swelling (cm3/g)<br>
Degree of swelling is determined by<br>
 dispersing about 1 g of dried starch powder in 100 cm3<br>
of pure water, allowing the resulting dispersion to<br>
stand for 16 hours, and calculating the degree of<br>
swelling from the volume V of the lower layer portion<br>
of the dispersion separated into upper and lower<br>
 layers, by the following equation:<br>
Degree of swelling (cm3/g) = V (cm3) / the dry<br>
weight (g) of the starch powder<br>
(8)	Shell structure<br><br><br>
As to the shell structure, 1 g of starch<br>
powder is dispersed in 100 cm3 of pure water and after<br>
standing for 16 hours, the lower layer portion of the<br>
dispersion separated into upper and lower layers is<br>
 observed under an optical microscope (magnification:<br>
10). In the case of the starch powder of the<br>
invention, the shell structure inherent in a starch raw<br>
material for the starch powder is completely present<br>
without loss thereof. On the other hand, in the case<br>
 of pregelatinized starch, nothing is observed in the<br>
lower layer portion, or a flaky, massive or the like<br>
shell structure formed by the conversion of swollen or<br>
dissolved amylose and amylopectin to (Î²-amylose and (Î²-<br>
amylopectin is observed in the lower layer portion.<br>
 [Example 1]<br>
A starch emulsion having a solid<br>
concentration of 5% was prepared by using potato starch<br>
as a starting material. The starch emulsion was<br>
gelatinized by heating at 95Â°C for 45 minutes in a<br>
 jacketed agitation vessel (4 L), diluted 2-fold with<br>
warm water at 60Â°C, and then continuously spray-dried at<br>
a flow rate of 8.3 L/hr while being maintained at 60Â°C,<br>
to obtain starch powder A. A cylindrical molded<br>
article with a diameter of 0.8 cm was obtained by<br>
 compressing 0.2 g of prepared powder of acetaminophen<br>
(APAP)/starch powder A/crystalline cellulose "Ceolus"<br>
KG-802 (weight ratio: 10/60/30) at 60 MPa with a<br>
static-pressure press, and was subjected to a release-<br><br><br>
by-dissolution test. As test solutions, there were<br>
used solution I (pH 1.2), solution II (pH 6.8, ionic<br>
strength 0.14) and Mcilvaine solution (pH 7.2, ionic<br>
strength 0.39) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia.<br>
 The test was carried out by adding Î±-amylase to each of<br>
these solutions to a concentration of 5 Âµm/cm3.<br>
Table 1 shows the physical properties of<br>
starch powder A, and Table 2 shows the release-by-<br>
dissolution test result of the molded article of the<br>
 prepared powder. The molded article containing starch<br>
powder A was not disintegrated in the test solutions<br>
even after the lapse of 8 hours. It had a sustained-<br>
release capability equal to that imparted by release-<br>
sustaining base ingredients which have been generally<br>
 used. In addition, the molded article was free from pH<br>
dependence and the influence of ionic strength and<br>
moreover, had a good stability over a long period of<br>
time. Thus, it can be seen that the molded article is<br>
an excellent pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
 [Example 2]<br>
Potato starch was packed in a stainless-steel<br>
vat (50 cm x 25 cm) to a thickness of 5 cm, subjected<br>
to pressure reduction (600 mmHg) in a pressure<br>
container for 5 minutes, and then treated with<br>
 compressed steam (120Â°C) for 20 minutes. Using the<br>
treated potato starch as a starting material, a starch<br>
emulsion having a solid concentration of 5% was<br>
prepared. The starch emulsion was gelatinized by<br><br><br>
heating at 95Â°C for 45 minutes in a jacketed agitation<br>
vessel (4 L), diluted 2-fold with warm water at 60Â°C,<br>
and then continuously spray-dried at a flow rate of 8.3<br>
L/hr while being maintained at 60Â°C, to obtain starch<br>
 powder B. A cylindrical molded article with a diameter<br>
of 0.8 cm was obtained by compressing 0.2 g of prepared<br>
powder of acetaminophen (APAP)/starch powder<br>
B/crystalline cellulose "Ceolus" KG-802 (weight ratio:<br>
10/60/30) at 60 MPa with a static-pressure press, and<br>
 was subjected to a release-by-dissolution test. As<br>
test solutions, solution I (pH 1.2), solution II (pH<br>
6.8, ionic strength 0.14) and Mcilvaine solution (pH<br>
7.2, ionic strength 0.39) were used as described in the<br>
Japanese Pharmacopoeia. The test was carried out by<br>
 adding Î±-amylase to each of these solutions to a<br>
concentration of 5 Âµm/cm3.<br>
Table 1 shows the physical properties of<br>
starch powder B, Table 2 shows the release-by-<br>
dissolution test result of the molded article of the<br>
 prepared powder, and Fig. 1 shows an electron<br>
micrograph (600 magnifications) of starch powder B.<br>
Table 3 shows the result of subjecting the cylindrical<br>
molded article to a release-by-dissolution test in the<br>
same manner as above after storing the cylindrical<br>
 molded article in a sealed-in state at 40Â°C and 75%RH<br>
for 2 weeks. The molded article containing starch<br>
powder B was not disintegrated in the test solutions<br>
even after the lapse of 8 hours. It had a sustained-<br><br><br>
release capability equal to that imparted by release-<br>
sustaining base ingredients that have been generally<br>
used. In addition, the molded article was free from pH<br>
dependence and the influence of ionic strength and<br>
 moreover, had a good stability over a long period of<br>
time. Thus, it can be seen that the molded article is<br>
an excellent pharmaceutical preparation.<br>

[Example 6]<br>
Potato starch was packed in a stainless-steel<br>
 vat (50 cm x 25 cm) to a thickness of 5 cm, subjected<br>
to pressure reduction (600 mmHg) in a pressure<br>
container for 5 minutes, and then treated with<br>
compressed steam (120Â°C) for 20 minutes. Using the<br>
treated potato starch as a starting material, a starch<br>
 emulsion having a solid concentration of 5% was<br>
prepared. The starch emulsion was gelatinized (outlet<br>
temperature: 100Â°C) by heating at 20 L/hr in a jet<br>
cooker, continuously passed through a residence tube<br>
(100Â°C) with a capacity of 3 L, and then spray-dried to<br>
 obtain starch powder F. The residence time was 9<br>
minutes.<br>
In an agitation granulator (Vertical<br>
Granulator FM-VG-10, mfd. by Powrex Co.) 15 g of starch<br>
powder F, 1120 g of 200M lactose (Pharmatose 200M, mfd.<br>
 by DMV International) and 480 g of official corn starch<br>
(mfd. by Nippon Starch Chemical Co., Ltd.) were placed<br>
and premixed for 3 minutes under conditions of a blade<br>
revolution rate of 280 rpm and a cross-screw revolution<br><br><br>
rate of 3000 rpm. Then, 400 g of pure water was added<br>
all at once as binding water, followed by granulation<br>
for 3 minutes under conditions of a blade revolution<br>
rate of 280 rpm and a cross-screw revolution rate of<br>
 3000 rpm. The resulting granulation product was dried<br>
on trays at 60Â°C for 16 hours and then sifted through a<br>
screen having a screen opening of 1410 urn, and granules<br>
that could pass through the screen were used as<br>
granules A for tabletting. To granules A for<br>
 tabletting was added magnesium stearate in an amount of<br>
0.5% by weight based on the weight of the resulting<br>
mixture, and the mixture was compressed into tablets at<br>
a compression pressure of 5 kN, 10 kN or 15 kN with a<br>
rotary tabletting machine (Clean Press, correct 12HUK,<br>
 mfd. by Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd.) under the following<br>
conditions: 54 rpm, attachment of a Î¦8mm-12R pestle,<br>
and open feed.<br>
Table 1 shows the physical properties of<br>
starch powder F and Fig. 2 shows an electron micrograph<br>
 (600 magnifications) of starch powder F. Fig. 9 shows<br>
the particle size distribution of granules A for<br>
tabletting and Table 4 shows physical properties of the<br>
tablets obtained. Granules A for tabletting produced<br>
by adding starch powder F in the form of powder showed<br>
 the sharp particle size distribution and the tablets<br>
produced from granules A for tabletting had a high<br>
hardness and excellent disintegrating properties.<br>
The weight frequency (%) in Fig. 9 is<br><br>
explained below. Using IS screens having screen<br>
openings of 45, 75, 106, 150, 212, 250, 300, 500 and<br>
710 Âµm, respectively, 10 g of the granules for<br>
tabletting are sieved with a low-tap screen classifier<br>
 for 10 minutes, and the weight percentage of granules<br>
remaining on each screen is calculated and converted to<br>
a weight frequency (at intervals of 10 urn) in each of<br>
the above screen opening ranges. For example, when the<br>
weight percentage of granules for tabletting in the<br>
 screen opening range of 45 Âµm to 75 urn is a (%), the<br>
weight frequency b is calculated to be [a/(75-45)] x<br>
10(%) by conversion. The same applies to Figs. 10 to<br>
12 described hereinafter.<br>
[Example 7]<br>
 	Placed in a vessel was 500 g of pure water,<br>
and 40 g of starch powder E of Example 5 was added in<br>
small portions while stirring at 5000 rpm in a TK<br>
homomixer (Model MARKII, mfd. by Tokushu Kika Kogyo<br>
Co., Ltd.). After the whole amount of starch powder E<br>
 was added, the resulting mixture was stirred for 30<br>
minutes to obtain a homogeneous suspension of starch<br>
powder E. In an agitation granulator (Vertical<br>
Granulator FM-VG.-10, mfd. by Powrex Co.) were placed<br>
1120 g of 200M lactose (Pharmatose 200M, mfd. by DMV<br>
 International) and 480 g of official corn starch (mfd.<br>
by Nippon Starch Chemical Co., Ltd.), and premixed for<br>
3 minutes under conditions of a blade revolution rate<br>
of 280 rpm and a cross-screw revolution rate of 3000<br><br><br>
rpm. Then, 400 g of the homogeneous suspension of<br>
starch powder E obtained above was added all at once as<br>
a binder, followed by granulation for 3 minutes under<br>
conditions of a blade revolution rate of 280 rpm and a<br>
 cross-screw revolution rate of 3000 rpm. The<br>
granulation product obtained was dried on trays at 60Â°C<br>
for 16 hours and then sifted through a screen having a<br>
screen opening of 1410 Âµm, and granules that could pass<br>
through the screen were used as granules B for<br>
 tabletting. To granules B for tabletting was added<br>
magnesium stearate in an amount of 0.5% by weight based<br>
on the weight of the resulting mixture, and the mixture<br>
was compressed into tablets at a compression pressure<br>
of 5 kN, 10 kN or 15 kN with a rotary tabletting<br>
 machine (Clean Press, correct 12HUK, mfd. by Kikusui<br>
Seisakusho Ltd.) under the following conditions: 54<br>
rpm, attachment of a Î¦8mm-12R pestle, and open feed.<br>
Fig. 11 shows the particle size distribution<br>
of granules B for tabletting and Table 4 shows physical<br>
 properties of the tablets obtained. Granules B for<br>
tabletting produced by adding starch powder E in the<br>
form of the suspension showed the sharp particle size<br>
distribution and the tablets produced from granules B<br>
for tabletting had a high hardness and excellent<br>
 disintegrating properties.<br>
