FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of indolylmaleimides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinase C (PKC), and particularly its various isozymes, have been associated with a variety of diseased states including cancer, central nervous system disorders, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, dermatological diseases, inflammation, auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and also diabetic complications. As a result, there is a high level of research aimed at identifying therapeutic agents for inhibiting PKC activity as a way of treating these various conditions, and especially PKC inhibitors that are isozyme selective. Substituted indolylmaleimides, particularly the substituted bis-indolylmaleimides, are one major class of compounds which have been found to be selective PKC inhibitors (Steglich et. al., Angew. Chem. Ed. Engl., 1980, 19, 459).<br>
Various symmetrical and non-symmetrical bis-indolylmaleimide derivatives are reported in literature. Examples include, US 5,043,335; US 5,380,746; US 5,491,242; US 5,516,915; US 5,821,365; EP 0 657 458; and PCT applications, WO 91/13071, WO 93/18765, WO 93/18766, WO 98/04551 and WO 00/47575. Further, bis-indolylmaleimide macrocycles are reported in US 6,057,440; US 5,821,365 and US 5,624,949.<br>
Another class of indolylmaleimide derivatives described in US 5,057,614; are reported to be useful in control or prevention of inflammatory, immunological, bronchopulmonary or cardiovascular disorders; while indolylmaleimide derivatives described in WO 93/18765 and WO 93/18766 (US 5,547,976) are mentioned to have anti-viral activity.<br>
The process to prepare such indolylmaleimide derivatives is a known art and is included in patents like US 4,785,085; US 5,057,614; US 5,380,746; US 5,547,976; US 5,516,915; US 5,665,877; US 6,037,475 and US 6,228,877. Also some research articles describe alternative approaches to synthesize various indolylmalemide derivatives, for example, Davis P. et. al. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 177-184; Bit et. al. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 21-29; Bit et. al.. Tetrahedron Lett, 1993, 34, 5623, Bergman et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1987, 28, 4441-4444; Davis et. al.. Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31, 2353, Davis et. al.. Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31, 5201-5204, and Bemner et. al.. Tetrahedron, 1988,44,2887-2892.<br><br>
The general approach has been to prepare the title compoudns by using suitable mole ratio of indolyl magnesium halide with dihalomaleimide in appropriate solvent mixture. In most of the methods, ratio of indolyl grignard reagent: 2,3-dihalomaleimide is 4:1. Here we discuss in brief the prior art as found in the literature.<br>
Another approach employs 1:2 ratio of N-benzyloxymethyl 2,3-dibromomaleimide : optionally substituted indolyl magnesium iodide as described in US patent 4,785,085.<br>
US patent 5,057,614, gives preparation for 3,4-bis(3-indolyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione wherein indolyl magnesium bromide and 2,3-dibromomaleimide in 4:1 mole ratio were heated to reflux in benzene for 65 hours to obtain the bis-product.<br>
US patent 5,380,746, gives preparation for 4-bromo-3-(3-indolyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione wherein indolyl magnesium bromide and 2,3-dibromomaleimide are reacted in 5:1 mole ratio and the time required for this reaction is 30 hrs under reflux.<br>
US patent 5,547,976, gives preparation for 3,4-bis(3-indolyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione wherein indolyl magnesium bromide and 2,3-dibromomaleimide are reacted according to the procedure given in Bernner et. al., Tetrahedron, 1988, 44, 2887-2892. Further it also reports that the reaction is significantly dependent on solvent conditions (same as given in. Synthesis, 1995 (12), 1511-1516).<br>
US patent 5,516,915 gives various schemes to prepare differently substituted bis-indolyl derivatives using an indole grignard reagent and dibromomaleimide. In the method 3:1 to 5:1 molar ratios of optionally substituted indole: 2,3-dibromomaleimide is used, and the reaction is completed in about 30 hours for unsubstituted monoindolylmaleimide and in about 20 hours for symmetrical bis-5-methoxyindolylmaleimide derivative. Sometimes, formation of an impurity is reported, the exact structure of which is not disclosed.<br>
US patent 5,665,877, gives preparation for 3,4-bis(3-indolyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione wherein indolyl magnesium bromide and 2,3-dichloromaleimide are reacted in 4:1 mole ratio.<br>
According to US patent 5,821,365, it is preferable to use 2,3-dichloromaleimide in the synthesis of bis-indolylmaleimide. It also describes method of preparation of 2,3-dichloro-N-methylmaleimide. This is the closest known prior art of the present invention. The process of the present invention is different from the method disclosed in the following respects:<br><br>
1.	Molar ratio of indolyl magnesium bromide and N-methyl-2,3-dichloromaleimide is 4.28:1 moles in the process of the US Patent.<br>
2.	Solvent : solid (reaction mass) ratio are higher in the process of the US Patent..<br>
3.	The present invention envisages shorter reaction time for identical reaction.<br>
4.	The process of the present invention is more economical y as relatively smaller amounts of indole, solvent, 2,3-dichloromaleimide are required to produce same amount of final product.<br>
5.	Method of isolation of product is different in the two processes.<br>
6.	Yields are higher in the process of the present invention.<br>
7.	The purity of the cmde product of the present invention is more than 98.50 %, with less than 0.5 % of indole in it. These impurities are easily removed during recrystalization to increase the purity &gt; 99.5 %.<br>
8.	Solvent recovery is different in the two cases.<br>
To prepare such indolyl derivatives, most of patent and literature including those cited above, refer to Bernner et. al., in Tetrahedron, 1988, 44, 2887-2892. According to this process indolyl magnesium bromide and N-methyl-2,3-dibromomaleimide in 5:1 mole ratio when refluxed for 2 hrs yield the corresponding bis-indolyl derivative. However, when we attempted to reproduce the same, the reaction mixture at the end of 25 hrs contained mostly the mono indolylmaleimide.<br>
It is reportedly confirmed, a number of times that synthesis of bis-indolylmaleimides is sensitive to the solvent composition (for example in, Synthesis, 1995 (12), 1511-1516). This is the only process we found in literature wherein the ratios of indolyl magnesium bromide : 2,3-dichloromaleimide is about 2:1 moles. According to their observation when toluene:tetrahydrofuran is used as solvent in the ratios between 10:1 to 1:1 there is increase in the percentage proportion of unreacted 2-chloro-3-indolylmaleimide as impurity from 9 % to 65 % in the corresponding bis-derivative. It also states that in presence of toulene:diethylether tetrahydrofuran leads to increase in 1,2-carbonyl adduct, while the same reaction in toluene:tetrahydrofuran:diethylether (5:1:1) leads to decrease in the impurity. Hence, most of the methods found in patents literature prefer to use above solvent mixture. The paper also states that yield of reaction is also<br><br>
affected by the ratio of reactants and solvent. Increase in reactant concentration leads to increase in amount of the said impurity and consequent decrease in the yield. It also states that there exists no difference in the reactivity of 2,3-dichloromaleimide and 2,3-dibromomaleimide.<br>
No data on the effect of molar ratio of the two reactants on the formation of impurity and formation of polar impurity in the Toluene:Tetrahydrofuran is described in the literature.<br>
Our attempts to reproduce the most widely reported process i.e. Bemner et. al., in Tetrahedron, 1988, 44, 2887-2892 resulted in formation of mostly monosubstituted derivative even at the end of 25 hrs of reaction.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a straight forward process to prepare indolylmaleimides useful as either an intermediate or as a bio-active molecule. Alternative method should be a simplified process with higher yields, shorter reaction time, easier (e.g. milder) reaction conditions, inexpensive reagents and the like.<br>
The present process involves the general approach of condensation of an organometallic-3-indole with dihalomaleimide. The process gives exact science of preparing the indolyl maleimide derivatives in most convenient way. It has optimized the molar ratios of reactants, solvents, reduced formation of 1,2-addition product and shortened reaction time and thus conserves energy and reduces the overall cost of production. This reaction is also versatile and the principle can be applied to obtain wide variety of products. Further, on completion of reaction, the mass left behind contains product along with excess amount of indole added, which can easily be washed off and recycled without any elaborate procedure. Thus, the process of this invention offers simple procedure to obtain a pharmaceutical grade intermediate or a drug, which can easily fit the regulatory requirements.<br>
The main advantage is that both the steps involved in the preparation of bis-indolylmalemides have relatively faster reaction kinetics than ever reported before in the prior art. This increased rate of reaction does not adversely affect the yield and purity of the various bis-indolylmalemides formed; rather, certain side-products were not formed in the experiments done by us.<br>
The principle of this invention can be essentially applied to other indolylmaleimides derivatives wherein there is at least one-indolylnitrogen unsubstituted<br><br>
in the intermediate formed. Such compounds are known to be useful intermediates, for example bis-indolylmaleimides macrocycles, non-symmetrical bis-indolylmaleimides etc.<br>
Further, this is a single-pot synthesis for symmetrical bis-indolylmalemide derivatives starting with the preparation of grignard reagent.<br>
The present invention involves formation of ethyl magnesium halide, followed by indolyl magnesium halide and the final bis-indolyl maleimide, sequentially in the same pot.<br>
Mono-substituted maleimides can also be prepared by this approach, potentially permeating the eventual synthesis of non-symmetrical bis-indolyl maleimides.<br>
The advantages of the present invention as envisaged by us are as follows:<br>
1.	The present process is a one-pot synthesis, wherein the desired substituted symmetrical bis-indolylmaleimide is made using the appropriately substituted indole, ethyl magnesium bromide and dihalomaleimide.<br>
2.	The approach of this process can also be extended to monosubstituted maleimides as well as monosubstituted pyrrole indoles and non-symmetrical bis-indolylmaleimides.<br>
3.	Further the reaction time for the entire process as such is considerably short, without incurring any additional operational changes or costly equipment.<br>
4.	This process has smoother temperature gradient and hence reduced energy costs.<br>
5.	Along with all of the above advantages, the process does not compromise on yield and purity of the product. It provides bis-indolylmaleimides in greater than 65 % yield, with more than 99 percent purity.<br>
6.	The recovery of organic solvent/s used, is upto 80 %.<br>

The term "aryl" when used alone or in combination represents a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl. Aryl may optionally be substituted with any substituent that does not prevent or interfere with the desired synthesis step and generally includes substitution with up to four and usually with one or two groups independently selected from hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, preferably a d-Cioalkoxy, an alkyl, preferably a Cr Cioalkyl, a haloalkyi, nitro, monoalkylaminoalkyi, dialkylaminoalkyi, trialkylaminoalkyi, -NHCO{Ci-Cioalkyl), -NHC0(ben2yl), -NHCO(Phenyl), -SH, -S(C1C10alkyl), -OCO(Ci-Cioalkyl), -SO2 (NR4 R5), -SO2 (C1C10 alkyl), -S02(phenyl), or halo. The term aryloxy is one such aryl covalently bonded through an -O- linkage. The term arylalkyi can be considered a substituted alkyl and represents -(CH2)aryl with m being an integer of generally 1 to 3, and preferably is benzyl. In contrast, the term alkylaryl can be considered a substituted aryl and may, for example, represent a moiety such as -aryl(CH2)m-CH3 where m is an integer of generally 0 to 2.<br>
The term "alkenyl" means a two to seven carbon, straight or branched hydrocarbon containing one or more double bonds, preferably one or two double bonds. Examples of alkenyl include ethenyl, propenyl, 1, 3-butadienyl, and 1, 3, 5-hexatrienyl.<br>
The acyl moiety of an acylamino or acylaminoalkyi group is derived from an alkanoic acid containing a maximum of 7, preferably a maximum of 4, carbon atoms (e.g., acetyl, propionyl or butyryl) or from an aromatic carboxylic acid (e.g. benzoyl). An acyloxy is one such acyl bonded by an -O- linkage, for example, acetyloxy, CH3C(=0)0-. An acylamino is, for example, CH3 (C=0)NH-- (acetylamino). Likewise, an acylaminoalkyi is<br>
CH3(C=0)NH(CH2)m.<br>
The heterocyclic group denoted by "Het" or "heterocyclyl" can be a stable, saturated, partially unsaturated, or aromatic 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic group. The heterocyclic ring consists of carbon atoms and from one to three heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The heterocyclic group can be optionally substituted with one to three substituents independently selected from halogen, alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, haloalkyi, nitro, amino, acylamino, monoalkylamino, dialkylamino, alkylthio, alkylsulfinyl and alkylsulfonyl or, when the heterocyclyl group is an aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group, the<br><br>
nitrogen atom can carry an oxide group. Examples of such heterocyclyl groups are imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, thiazotinyl, pyridyl, indolyl, furyl, and pyrimidinyl.<br>
The term "leaving group" (LG) as used in the specification and claims is readily understood by those skilled in the art. Generally, a leaving group is any group or atom that enhances the electrophilicity of the atom to which it is attached for easy displacement. Preferred leaving groups are triflate ("OSO2CF3), mesylate, tosylate, imidate, chloride, bromide, and iodide. Triflate is particularly preferred.<br>

Under certain circumstances it is at least desired and often required to protect the nitrogen (N) of intermediates during the synthesis of the compounds of formulae (I) and (II) with suitable "protecting groups" which are known. Introduction and removal of such nitrogen protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In this regard, the term "--NH protective groups" and "protecting group" when used in a similar context, and as used in the specification and claims, refers to sub-class of amino protecting groups that are commonly employed to block or protect the -NH functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. The species of protecting group employed in carrying out the method of the present invention is not critical so long as the derivatized --NH group is stable to the condition(s) of subsequent reaction(s) and can be removed at the appropriate point without disrupting the remainder of the molecule. Prior art (T. W. Greene and P. Wats, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Chapter 7, pages 385-394 and 397-403), provide a list of commonly employed protecting groups for indoles and maleimides. Preferred indole protecting groups are trimethylsilylethoxymethyl, benzyl, tosyl, carbamate, amide, alkyl or aryl sulfonamide, while maleimide protecting groups include alkoxy, benzyl, dialkoxybenzyl, benzyioxyalkyi or allyl. The related term "protected ~NH" defines a group substituted with an -NH protecting group as defined.<br>
In certain circumstances there may also be a need to protect hydroxy groups and amino groups during the synthetic processes of the present invention. Those skilled in the<br><br>
art are familiar with such "hydroxy protecting groups" and such "amino protecting groups." The term "hydroxy protecting group" refers to one of the ether or ester derivatives of the hydroxy group commonly employed to block or protect the hydroxy group while reactions are carried out on other functional groups on a compound. The species of hydroxy protecting group employed is not critical so long as the derivatized hydroxy group is stable to the condition of subsequent reaction(s) and can be removed at the appropriate point without disoipting the remainder of the molecule. Preferred hydroxy protecting groups are tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (TBDMS), triphenylmethyl (trityl), mono- or di- methoxytrityl, or an alkyl or aryl ester.<br>
The term "amino protecting group'* refers to substituents of an amino group commonly employed to block or protect the amino functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. The species of amino-protecting group employed in carrying out the method of the present invention is not critical so long as the derivatized amino group is stable to the condition(s) of subsequent reaction(s) and can be removed at the appropriate point without dismpting the remainder of the molecule. Preferred amino-protecting groups are t-butoxycarbonyl, phthalimide, a cyclic alkyl, and benzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
The term "indolylmaleimide" embraces a genus of compounds having as their root structure a 3-(indol-3-yl)-pyrrolyl-2,5-dione and includes the subgenus of "bisindolylmaleimides" having as their root stoicture a 3,4-(indol-3-yl)"pyrrolyl-2,5-dione", wherein the indol-3-yi moiety or moieties is/are optionally N-substituted, may optionally be substituted on the fused 6-membered aromatic ring of the indolyl moiety and may optionally be substituted at position 2 of the indol-3-yl moiety or moieties. Compounds falling within this definition of indolylmaleimide are described, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,242 (PCT publication WO 95/35294), PCT publication WO 95/17182, and published European patent application EP 0657458, which are all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The prior art describes a wide range of such optionally substituted indolylmaleimides and the present invention can advantageously be used to make such compounds as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Compounds of formula (1) are themselves useful as PKC inhibitors or represent intermediates useful for the preparation of compounds exhibiting PKC inhibitory activity. A particularly preferred feature of this aspect of the invention is the use of an indolylmaleimide of the following formula (I) for preparing other compounds of formula (I) by reaction with an organometallic reagent: (II) wherein the substitutents are as defined above in connection<br><br>
with formula (I). These compounds are useful for preparing compounds of formula (I) or (II) having PKC inhibitory activity or for preparing intermediates of PKC inhibitors.<br>
The preferred aspect of the present invention involves a process suitable for producing bisindolylmaleimides, including non-symmetrical bisindolylmalemides starting from commercially available materials. In a particulariy preferred approach, an optionally substituted indolyl magnesium halide, is prepared in situ according to the general procedures available in the prior art. The grignard reaction can be conducted in two steps, introducing the maleimide substituents for the halogen atoms one at a time. In such case, it is preferable to use 2,3-dibromomaleimide in a 1:1.2 molar ratios with indolyl magnesium halide. If needed, the protecting groups are subsequently de-protected, using known techniques and procedures, and additional steps may be performed to introduce, for example, a hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, substituted«aryl, alkylaryl, aminoalkyi, heteroaryl, carbonylalkyi, amidinothioalkyi, nitroguanidinoalkyi or another desired moiety. The general approach is described in US patent 5,516,915 and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
For example, a indolyl magnesium halide can be treated with 2,3-dibromomaleimide to yield an optionally substituted 3-bromo-4-(indol-3-yl)pyrrole-2,5-dione. This may be further alkylated, halogenated and the resulting product be subjected to another cycle of grignard reacted with a differently substituted indolyl magnesium halide according to the novel process of this invention to obtain non-symmetrical bisindolylmalemides.<br>
Another aspect of this invention involves a process suitable for producing bisindolylmaleimides, including symmetrical bisindolylmalemides. The general method involves reacting about 3 moles of indolyl magnesium halide with 1 mole of 2,3-dichloromaleimide according to the novel process of this invention when it is desired to prepare a symmetrical bis-indolyl derivative. Similar to above, the protecting groups are subsequently de-protected, using known techniques and procedures, and additional steps may be performed to introduce, for example, a hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, substituted-aryl, alkylaryl, aminoalkyi, heteroaryl, carbonylalkyi, amidinothioalkyi, nitroguanidinoalkyi or another desired moiety. The general approach is described in US patent 5,516,915 and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another particular aspect of this invention includes reacting about 1 mole of indolyl magnesium halide with 1 mole of 2,3-dibromomaleimide when it is desired to prepare either a mono substituted indolyl maleimide derivative.<br><br>
The reaction may be monitored by conventional techniques such as gas chromatography, thin layer chromatography etc or any other convenient technique known in the field of art. After it is confirmed that the reaction is complete the reaction mixture is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.<br>
The products of various reactions contemplated by the practice of this invention can be isolated using conventional procedures including precipitation, extraction, distillation, chromatography and the like.<br>
The product preferably is isolated by addition of reaction solvent to an aqueous solvent, which may contain pH-modifying agents. Water is such preferred solvent, and the reaction mixture is later neutralized with a suitable acid such as citric acid, ammonium chloride and the like. Later the residue obtained after filtration, if needed, may be further purified by using column chromatography over a silica gel column using a solvent system containing ether, hexane, pentane, ethyl acetate, alcohols etc. or mixtures thereof. The solvent/s may be evaporated in an inert atmosphere under vacuum to obtain pure product.<br>
The process of this invention has been demonstrated with the following examples:<br>
•	3-bromo-4-(indol-3-yI)-1H"pyrrole2,5-dione<br>
•	3-chloro-4-(indol-3-yl)-1H"pyrrole2,5-dione<br>
•	3,4-bis-(indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole2,5-dione<br>
The following preparation and examples are presented to illustrate and explain the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to parts and percentages are based on weight and all temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius. The scope of this invention is not construed as merely consisting of the following examples. In the following example and preparations, melting point, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, mass spectra, high pressure liquid chromatography over silica gel and tetrahydrofuran are abbreviated as M. Pt, NMR, MS, HPLC and THF respectively.<br>
Commercial reagents were utilized without further purification. Melting points are uncorrected. NMR data are reported in parts per million (8) and are referenced to the deuterium lock signal from the sample solvent. Unless othenA/ise stated, all mass spectra were performed using ESI conditions. IR spectra were taken using KBr pellet. Room temperature refers to 25-30 °C. Chromatography refers to column chromatography performed using 60 - 120 mesh silica gel and executed under nitrogen pressure (flash chromatography) conditions. The "NMR"spectra and "MS" indicate that the spectrum was<br><br>
consistent with  the  desired   structure  the  product.   This   is  further  confirmed  by characteristic IR spectra and melting point.<br>
