				<td>Vanadium-free catalyst for selective catalytic reduction and method of production<br>
thereof<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a novel, vanadium-free catalyst for the selective catalytic<br>
reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia or a compound that decomposes to ammonia<br>
as reducing agent, which is especially suitable for removing nitrogen oxides from<br>
exhaust gases from primarily lean-burn internal combustion engines in motor vehicles.<br>
The invention relates further to a method of activation of a homogeneous cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxide for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.<br>
The emissions of a motor vehicle can basically be divided into two groups. Thus, the<br>
term raw emission denotes pollutant gases that are formed directly in the engine through<br>
the fuel combustion process and are already contained in the exhaust gas before passing<br>
through the exhaust gas cleaning system. Exhaust gas components that may form as by-<br>
products in the exhaust gas cleaning system are termed secondary emissions.<br>
Exhaust gases from motor vehicles with a primarily lean-burn internal combustion<br>
engine contain, in addition to the usual primary emissions carbon monoxide CO,<br>
hydrocarbons HC and nitrogen oxides NOx, a relatively high oxygen content of up to 15<br>
vol.%. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons can easily be made harmless by oxidation.<br>
However, reduction of the nitrogen oxides to nitrogen is much more difficult, on<br>
account of the high oxygen content.<br>
A known method for the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases in the presence<br>
of oxygen is the method of selective catalytic reduction (SCR process) by means of<br>
ammonia on a suitable catalyst, called an SCR catalyst for short. In this method, the<br>
nitrogen oxides that are to be removed from the exhaust gas are reacted with ammonia<br>
to nitrogen and water. The ammonia that is used as reducing agent can be made<br>
available by feeding a compound that decomposes to ammonia, for example urea,<br>
ammonium carbamate or ammonium formate, into the exhaust system and subsequent<br>
hydrolysis. Furthermore, exhaust gas cleaning concepts for motor vehicles are known in<br>
which ammonia is produced as secondary emission on a series-installed catalyst during a<br>
rich operating phase of the engine, for example a nitrogen oxide storage catalyst, and is<br>
stored temporarily in the SCR catalyst until the time of consumption during the lean<br>
operating phases.<br><br>
Use in a discontinuously operating SCR system, in which the ammonia used as reducing<br>
agent is produced exclusively as secondary emission in the exhaust system, requires<br>
SCR catalysts with sufficient ammonia storage capacity to provide if at all possible the<br>
entire requirement for the reducing agent for removal of nitrogen from the exhaust gas<br>
during the lean phase. Zeolite-based SCR catalysts, as described in numerous<br>
publications and patent applications, are particularly suitable for this. For example, US<br>
4 961 917 describes a method for reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia using a<br>
catalyst which, in addition to a zeolite with defined properties, contains iron and/or<br>
copper as promoter. Other SCR catalysts based on transition-metal-exchanged zeolites<br>
and methods of selective catalytic reduction using said SCR catalysts are described for<br>
example in EP 1 495 804 Al, US 6 914 026 B2 or EP 1 147 801 Bl.<br>
For use in exhaust gas cleaning systems with metering devices for urea or other<br>
compounds that decompose to ammonia, providing continuous supply of reducing agent<br>
to the system, it is not necessary for the SCR catalyst to have a large ammonia storage<br>
capacity. Accordingly we try to avoid using zeolite-based SCR catalysts, as they are<br>
very expensive on account of the high production costs for zeolite compounds.<br>
SCR catalysts that contain vanadium oxide in addition to titanium dioxide or tungsten<br>
oxide or mixtures thereof are suitable for this. For example,<br>
EP 0 385 164 Bl describes such a catalyst that contains, in addition to titanium dioxide,<br>
at least one oxide of tungsten, silicon, boron, aluminium, phosphorus, zirconium,<br>
barium, yttrium, lanthanum or cerium, and at least one oxide of vanadium, niobium,<br>
molybdenum, iron or copper and that is produced as a moulded article by compaction or<br>
extrusion of the components, optionally after adding suitable auxiliary agents. EP<br>
1 153 648 Al describes a structured SCR catalyst, which contains, beneath a coating of<br>
hydrolysis catalyst, a reduction coating whose composition corresponds to the recipe<br>
known from EP 0 385 164 Bl. EP 0 246 859 describes an SCR catalyst that contains<br>
vanadium, applied on a mixture of cerium oxide and aluminium oxide.<br>
An important problem when using vanadium-containing SCR catalysts for cleaning<br>
exhaust gases from motor vehicles is the possible emission of volatile, toxic vanadium<br>
compounds at higher exhaust gas temperatures, probably with harmful effects on<br>
humans and the environment. Accordingly there is low market acceptance of vanadium-<br>
containing car exhaust catalysts.<br>
Efforts have already been made since long ago to provide vanadium-free SCR catalysts<br>
as a cost-effective alternative to high-priced, zeolite-based systems.<br><br>
For example, US 4 798 817 describes an SCR catalyst that essentially contains from 0.5<br>
to 50% iron sulphate applied on a mixture of 2 to 60% cerium oxide and aluminium<br>
oxide. US 4 780 445 describes an SCR catalyst with 0.1 to 25% nickel sulphate or<br>
manganese sulphate or mixtures thereof applied on a mixture of 2 to 60% cerium oxide<br>
and aluminium oxide.<br>
JP 2005-238195 or EP 1 736 232 describes a catalyst system for the removal of nitrogen<br>
oxides, containing a first reaction section for denitration by reaction of nitrogen oxides<br>
with ammonia and a second reaction section for oxidation of excess ammonia, in which<br>
the first reaction section contains a first catalyst, which contains as active component at<br>
least one complex oxide containing two or more oxides selected from the group<br>
comprising silicon oxide, aluminium oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and<br>
tungsten oxide, and a rare-earth metal or transition metal except Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, Cr and<br>
V.<br>
Apostolescu et al. describe, in Appl. Catal. B: Environmental 62 (2006) 104,<br>
investigations on SCR powder catalysts of Fe2O3/ZrO2 with WO3 doping in synthetic<br>
model exhaust gas.<br>
The known vanadium-free and zeolite-free SCR catalysts are sometimes of complicated<br>
composition, difficult to manufacture and/or do not satisfy the more stringent<br>
requirements on activity and ageing stability for use in motor vehicles.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is therefore to provide an SCR<br>
catalyst that is vanadium-free, and can be manufactured more cheaply than zeolite-based<br>
systems and with simple means. In comparison with existing known systems the catalyst<br>
should have a high catalytic activity and good ageing stability, and it should be suitable<br>
in particular for the removal of nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gas of primarily lean-<br>
burn internal combustion engines in motor vehicles with a continuous SCR system<br>
including a metering device for ammonia or a compound that decomposes to ammonia.<br>
This problem is solved by a SCR catalyst containing a catalytically active coating on an<br>
inert support, with the catalytically active coating comprising, completely or partially, a<br>
homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide, which contains 10 to 90 wt.% cerium<br>
oxide based on the total weight of the homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide and<br>
which is activated for the SCR reaction by the introduction of sulphur or a transition<br>
metal selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and<br>
mixtures thereof or by combinations thereof.<br><br>
A "homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide" (shortened to: cerium-zirconium<br>
mixed oxide) means, in the sense of this description, an oxidic, solid pulverulent<br>
material, comprising at least the two components cerium oxide and zirconium oxide.<br>
The components form a mixture at the atomic level. This term excludes physical<br>
mixtures of cerium oxide-containing powders with zirconium oxide-containing<br>
powders. The composition of said mixed oxides is, within the limits of measurement<br>
accuracy, constant over the cross-section of a powder grain, i.e. they are homogeneous.<br>
Materials of this kind are sometimes also called "solid solutions" in the literature.<br>
In the untreated state, these cerium-zirconium mixed oxides do not display any<br>
significant catalytic activity in the SCR reaction, as is demonstrated by the activity data<br>
shown in Fig. 1 for two examples of untreated cerium-zirconium mixed oxides with<br>
86 wt.% cerium oxide (VK1 from Comparative Example 1) or 48 wt.% cerium oxide<br>
(VK2 from Comparative Example 2), in each case based on the total weight of the<br>
homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide. The inventors' investigations led to the<br>
surprising result that a homogeneous cerium-zirconium oxide, when suitably pretreated,<br>
shows better SCR activity than existing SCR catalysts according to the state of the art.<br>
Homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxides, treated by one of the methods described<br>
below, are meant when discussing, in this description, cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
that has been activated for the SCR reaction.<br>
Activation of the cerium-zirconium mixed oxides for the SCR reaction is carried out by<br>
the introduction of sulphur or of a transition metal selected from the group consisting of<br>
chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and mixtures thereof. The activating components are<br>
incorporated in the oxide framework of the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide. Especially<br>
advantageous embodiments can be obtained by combining both activating measures.<br>
The introduction of sulphur and the introduction of the transition metal take place in<br>
separate, successive process steps.<br>
Sulphur can be introduced by treating the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide that is to be<br>
activated, with a gas mixture that contains sulphur dioxide SO2 in addition to oxygen.<br>
The treatment is carried out at temperatures between 150 and 800°C, preferably between<br>
250 and 650°C, especially preferably between 300 and 400°C. A suitable gas mixture<br>
contains, in addition to 0.15 to 15 vol.% oxygen, 5 to 50000 ppm sulphur dioxide,<br>
preferably 5 to 500 ppm sulphur dioxide, especially preferably 10 to 100 ppm SO2. The<br>
gas mixture can also contain up to 20 vol.% water.<br><br>
Sulphur can also be introduced by treating the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide with<br>
dilute sulphuric acid at room temperature or slightly elevated temperature up to 80°C,<br>
followed by drying. Drying can be carried out in air at temperatures between 80 and<br>
150°C.<br>
The amount of sulphur introduced into the activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
depends on the type and duration of treatment. A cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
activated for the SCR reaction contains 0.01 to 5 wt.% sulphur, preferably 0.02 to<br>
3 wt.% sulphur, based on the total weight of the activated cerium-zirconium mixed<br>
oxide.<br>
Furthermore, the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide can be activated for the SCR reaction<br>
by introducing a transition metal selected from the group comprising chromium,<br>
molybdenum, tungsten and mixtures thereof. For this, the cerium-zirconium mixed<br>
oxide is impregnated with an aqueous solution of a compound of chromium,<br>
molybdenum, tungsten or mixtures thereof, the amount of solution being selected such<br>
that the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide powder is moistened so that its pores are filled,<br>
but it remains free-flowing. Then the powder is dried in air at 300 to 700°C for a time<br>
from 0.5 to 5 hours, leading to thermal fixation of the transition metal in the cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxide. The operation is repeated if necessary, until the cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxide thus produced contains, after drying, 2 to 20 wt.%, preferably 5<br>
to 15 wt.% of chromium, molybdenum, tungsten or mixtures thereof, based on the total<br>
weight of the activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide. The above procedure ensures<br>
that the transition metal is distributed in highly dispersed form in the cerium-zirconium<br>
oxide. This is a prerequisite for effective activation of the cerium-zirconium mixed<br>
oxide.<br>
Ageing-resistant cerium-zirconium mixed oxides with particularly good activation for<br>
the SCR reaction are obtained when in addition a transition metal selected from the<br>
group consisting of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, ruthenium, rhodium,<br>
palladium, silver, iridium, platinum or gold or mixtures thereof is used as a promoter.<br>
The additional transition metal can be introduced in the same process that was also used<br>
for activation with chromium, molybdenum or tungsten. In particular, the transition<br>
metals used as promoters can be added to the solution containing chromium,<br>
molybdenum, tungsten or mixtures thereof and applied with the activating transition<br>
metal in the same process step. The resultant, activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
preferably has a content of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, ruthenium, rhodium,<br>
palladium, silver, iridium, platinum or gold or mixtures thereof from 0.1 to 10 wt.%,<br><br>
preferably 0.5 to 5 wt.%, in each case based on the total weight of the activated cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxide.<br>
Especially preferred embodiments of the activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
contain 0.02 to 3 wt.% sulphur and/or 5 to 15 wt.% molybdenum or tungsten and 0.5 to<br>
3 wt.% iron or copper, based in each case on its total weight.<br>
The method described is very suitable for the activation of homogeneous cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxides for the SCR reaction, when the latter contain 10-90 wt.%<br>
cerium(IV) oxide, based on the total weight of the homogeneous cerium-zirconium<br>
mixed oxide. Use of homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxides with a BET surface<br>
area of more than 50 m2/g and a cerium(IV) oxide content of 40-90 wt.% is preferred,<br>
and those with 45-55% CeO2 are especially preferred. The cerium-zirconium mixed<br>
oxides used can be doped with rare-earth metals and contain 1 to 9 wt.% rare-earth<br>
oxide based on the total weight of the homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide.<br>
Rare-earth oxides of scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium,<br>
samarium, europium, gadolinium or mixtures thereof are especially preferred.<br>
As already mentioned, a combination of the introduction of sulphur and of the<br>
introduction of transition metal can lead to especially advantageous embodiments. For<br>
this, on the one hand, sulphur can be introduced into a transition metal-containing<br>
homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide by treatment with a gas mixture<br>
containing SO2 and oxygen or by treatment with dilute sulphuric acid and subsequent<br>
drying. The transition metal contained in the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide can be one<br>
selected from the group consisting of chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese,<br>
iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, iridium, platinum or<br>
gold, or combinations thereof. On the other hand, a transition metal can be introduced,<br>
by the method described, in a homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide that already<br>
contains sulphur. The order of the process steps leads to embodiments of the catalyst<br>
with different chemical composition. Which order of the process steps leads to the<br>
overall more advantageous activation of the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide depends on<br>
the homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide selected as starting material and on the<br>
transition metal oxide used for activation. This constitutes a task of optimization for the<br>
catalysts that are finally produced from the activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide,<br>
with reference to the particular target application.<br>
If a cerium-zirconium mixed oxide activated in the manner described for the SCR<br>
reaction is applied on an inert support, a catalyst is obtained for the selective catalytic<br><br>
reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia or a compound that decomposes to<br>
ammonia. The support can consist of ceramic or metal. If a ceramic flow-through<br>
honeycomb monolith or a ceramic wall-flow filter substrate is used, a SCR catalyst is<br>
obtained that is especially suitable for the removal of nitrogen oxides from the exhaust<br>
gas of primarily lean-burn internal combustion engines in motor vehicles. The support<br>
can be coated completely or only partially with an activated cerium-zirconium mixed<br>
oxide. Complete coating of the support is always selected when sufficient installation<br>
space is available in the exhaust system of the motor vehicle for which the catalyst is<br>
intended, for arranging an additional hydrolysis catalyst on the inflow side and an<br>
additional ammonia trapping catalyst on the outflow side. In such an arrangement the<br>
purpose of the hydrolysis catalyst is to decompose a compound that decomposes to<br>
ammonia, which is fed into the exhaust system, with release of ammonia. The purpose<br>
of an ammonia trapping catalyst is to oxidize excess ammonia that passes through the<br>
SCR catalyst at certain operating points, to nitrogen, thus preventing its emission to the<br>
environment. If there is insufficient installation space, the hydrolysis catalyst can be<br>
applied on the coating with activated cerium-zirconium oxide, utilizing the entire length<br>
of the support. It is also possible for the coating with the cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
according to the invention to be applied to just a portion of the support, whereas in a<br>
zoned arrangement of the coating either a hydrolysis catalyst coating can be applied on<br>
the inflow side and/or an ammonia trapping catalyst coating and/or another SCR catalyst<br>
coating on the outflow side.<br>
SCR catalysts that are produced by complete or partial coating of an inert support with a<br>
cerium-zirconium mixed oxide according to the invention, activated for the SCR<br>
reaction, comprising a homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide containing 10 to<br>
90 wt.% cerium oxide, preferably 40 to 90 wt.%, especially preferably 45 to 55 wt.%<br>
cerium oxide, in each case based on the total weight of the homogeneous cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxide, and also covered by this invention, contain in their preferred<br>
embodiments 1 to 9 wt.% rare-earth metal oxide based on the total weight of the<br>
homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide. In that case the rare-earth oxide<br>
comprises an oxide of a metal selected from the group consitsing of scandium, yttrium,<br>
lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium and gadolinium or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The cerium-zirconium mixed oxide that is contained in the catalyst according to the<br>
invention, and was activated by the introduction of sulphur and/or transition metal,<br>
contains 0.01 to 5 wt.%, preferably 0.02 to 3 wt.% sulphur and/or 2 to 20 wt.%,<br><br>
preferably 5 to 15 wt.% chromium, molybdenum, tungsten or mixtures thereof,<br>
especially preferably molybdenum and/or tungsten. The amounts stated are in each case<br>
based on the total weight of the activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide. Especially<br>
preferred embodiments additionally contain 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.5 to 5 wt.% of<br>
a transition metal selected from the group consisting of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel,<br>
copper, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, iridium, platinum, gold or mixtures<br>
thereof, especially preferably 0.3 to 3 wt.% iron or copper, which acts as a promoter.<br>
Said catalyst provides a cost-effective and vanadium-free alternative to zeolite-based<br>
SCR catalysts, and the catalysts according to the invention are characterized by very<br>
good SCR activity for the requirements of appropriate ageing stability under<br>
hydrothermal conditions.<br>

catalysts that contain tungsten oxide, cerium oxide and zirconium oxide<br>
(VK6: Ce{ZrO2-WO3}; VK7: W{CeO2-ZrO2})<br><br>
Investigation of nitrogen oxide conversion as a measure for SCR activity:<br>
All the cerium-zirconium mixed oxides prepared in the examples described below were<br>
suspended in water, ground and applied to a ceramic honeycomb element with a volume<br>
of 0.5 L and number of cells of 62 cells per square centimetre with a wall thickness of<br>
0.17 mm. After calcination of the honeycomb element in air at 500°C for two hours,<br>
cylindrical core samples were taken from the coated honeycomb element for testing in a<br>
model-gas system with a diameter of 25.4 mm and a length of 76.2 mm.<br>
Testing was carried out in a laboratory model-gas system in the following conditions.<br><br>
During the measurement, the nitrogen oxide concentrations of the model exhaust gas<br>
after the catalyst were determined using suitable analysis. The nitrogen oxide conversion<br>
on the catalyst was calculated for each temperature measurement point from the known,<br>
metered nitrogen oxide contents, which were verified by pre-catalyst exhaust gas<br>
analysis during the conditioning at the start of each test run, and the measured nitrogen<br>
oxide contents after the catalyst, as follows:<br><br><br>
To assess SCR activity of the test materials, the nitrogen oxide conversion values UNOX<br>
[%] obtained were plotted as a function of the temperature measured before the catalyst.<br>
Comparative Example 1:<br>
A homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide, containing 86 wt.% cerium oxide and<br>
4 wt.% lanthanum oxide based on its total weight, was suspended in water, ground and<br>
applied to a ceramic honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and number of cells of<br>
62 cells per square centimetre with a wall thickness of 0.17 mm. After calcination of the<br>
honeycomb element in air at 500°C for two hours, a core sample VK1 was taken from<br>
the comparative catalyst thus prepared, for testing in the model-gas system, and its<br>
nitrogen oxide conversion was investigated.<br>
Comparative Example 2:<br>
A homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide, containing 48 wt.% cerium oxide<br>
based on its total weight, was suspended in water, ground and applied to a ceramic<br>
honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and number of cells of 62 cells per square<br>
centimetre with a wall thickness of 0.17 mm. After calcination of the honeycomb<br>
element in air at 500°C for two hours, a core sample VK2 was taken from the<br>
comparative catalyst thus prepared, for testing in the model-gas system, and its nitrogen<br>
oxide conversion was investigated.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the result of the model-gas investigation of the unactivated homogeneous<br>
cerium-zirconium mixed oxides as VK1 (o) and VK2 (D). AS expected, both materials<br>
show no significant nitrogen oxide conversion in the SCR reaction with ammonia. The<br>
conversion of 3.4% observed for VK2 at 250°C is within the stated variation of the<br>
method of measurement.<br><br>
Comparative Example 3;<br>
As a reference to the state of the art, a commercial SCR catalyst based on an iron-<br>
exchanged zeolite, applied to a honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and number<br>
of cells of 62 cells per square centimetre with a wall thickness of 0.17 mm, was<br>
prepared as a comparative catalyst. A core sample VK3 was taken from this comparative<br>
catalyst for testing in the model-gas system, and its nitrogen oxide conversion was<br>
investigated in the freshly prepared state.<br>
Another core sample that was taken from the comparative catalyst, and is designated<br>
VK3' in the following, was submitted to artificial ageing at 650°C for 48 hours. Ageing<br>
was carried out in a stove under hydrothermal conditions in an atmosphere consisting of<br>
10 vol.% O2 and 10 vol.% oxygen in air.<br>
Comparative Example 4:<br>
As another point of reference to the state of the art, a commercial SCR catalyst based on<br>
V2O5/TiO2/WO3 was prepared, comprising a coating on a honeycomb element with a<br>
volume of 0.5 L and number of cells of 62 cells per square centimetre with a wall<br>
thickness of 0.17 mm. A core sample VK4 was taken from the comparative catalyst for<br>
testing in the model-gas system, and its nitrogen oxide conversion was investigated in<br>
the freshly prepared state.<br>
As in Comparative Example 3, another core sample was taken from the comparative catalyst and was exposed at 650°C for 48 h to an atmosphere consisting of 10 vol.% O2<br>
and 10 vol.% oxygen in air. This core sample is designated VK4' in the following.<br>
Comparative Example 5:<br>
Based on the work by Apostolescu et al. in Appl. Catal. B: Environmental 62<br>
(2006) 104, another comparative catalyst was prepared, with a coating comprising<br>
1.4 wt.% iron and 7 wt.% tungsten on a zirconium-oxide support (cerium oxide-free).<br>
As in the other Comparative Examples and Examples, a ceramic honeycomb element<br>
with a volume of 0.5 L and number of cells of 62 cells per square centimetre with a wall<br>
thickness of 0.17 mm was used as support for the coating. A core sample VK5 was<br>
taken from the comparative catalyst for testing in the model-gas system, and its nitrogen<br>
oxide conversion was investigated in the freshly prepared state.<br><br>
As in Comparative Example 4, another core sample was taken from the comparative<br>
catalyst and was exposed at 650°C for 48 h to an atmosphere consisting of 10 vol.% O2<br>
and 10 vol.% oxygen in air. This core sample is designated VK5' in the following.<br>
Comparative Example 6:<br>
EP 1 736 232 Al discloses two different methods of production for SCR catalysts<br>
comprising the components tungsten oxide, cerium oxide and zirconium oxide.<br>
Paragraph [0007] of that specification describes a catalyst that is very suitable for the<br>
selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with urea, which was stated to be<br>
obtained by adding cerium to a tungsten oxide-zirconium oxide.<br>
In this comparative example, a comparative catalyst was prepared according to the<br>
information given in that specification, with the proportions of the components used<br>
being selected so that the composition of the resultant comparative catalyst roughly<br>
corresponded to that of the catalyst according to the invention described in Example 3.<br>
Thus, 420 g of a ZrO2/WO3 mixture (containing 88 wt.% ZrO2 and 12 wt.% WO3, based<br>
on the total weight of the mixture used) was suspended in water. While stirring<br>
continuously, a cerium nitrate solution containing 202 g cerium was added to the<br>
suspension.<br>
A honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and number of cells of 62 cells per square<br>
centimetre with a cell wall thickness of 0.17 mm was coated with the suspension thus<br>
1 obtained. After drying and calcination, two core samples were taken from the<br>
honeycomb element. For one of the core samples (VK6), the nitrogen oxide conversion<br>
of the catalyst in the freshly prepared state was determined in the model-gas system.<br>
The second core sample (VK6') was submitted to artificial ageing at 650°C for a period<br>
of 48 hours in an atmosphere consisting of 10 vol.% oxygen and 10 vol.% water vapour<br>
in air, and was only used for determination of the nitrogen oxide conversion in the<br>
model-gas system after this treatment.<br>
Comparative Example 7:<br>
This comparative catalyst was prepared according to the second method of preparation<br>
of SCR catalysts comprising tungsten oxide, cerium oxide and zirconium oxide disclosed in EP 1 736 232 Al. As described in Example 3 of that specification, first a<br>
cerium-zirconium mixed compound was precipitated from aqueous solution, and it was<br>
then impregnated with a tungsten-containing solution.<br><br>
For this, an aqueous solution containing 500 g zirconyl nitrate and 200 g cerium(III)<br>
nitrate (containing water of crystallization) was neutralized with ammonia solution, so<br>
that a cerium/zirconium oxide-hydroxide species was precipitated. A solution of 60 g<br>
ammonium metatungstate in water was added to the suspension obtained, stirring<br>
continuously.<br>
A honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and number of cells of 62 cells per square<br>
centimetre with a cell wall thickness of 0.17 mm was coated with the suspension thus<br>
obtained. After drying and calcination, two core samples were taken from the<br>
honeycomb element. The nitrogen oxide conversion of the catalyst in the freshly<br>
prepared state was determined on one of the core samples (VK7) in the model-gas<br>
system.<br>
The second core sample (VK7') was submitted to artificial ageing at 650°C for a period<br>
of 48 hours in an atmosphere consisting of 10 vol.% oxygen and 10 vol.% water vapour<br>
in air, and was used for determination of the nitrogen oxide conversion in the model-gas<br>
system only after this treatment.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A core sample was taken from the catalyst from Comparative Example 1 and was<br>
sulphurized in a stove for a period of 48 hours at a temperature of 350°C in an<br>
atmosphere of 10 vol.% oxygen, 10 vol.% water and 20 vol.-ppm sulphur dioxide in<br>
nitrogen. The resultant catalyst according to the invention Kl was investigated in the<br>
model gas.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen oxide conversion of the catalyst according to the invention Kl<br>
(•) in comparison with the nitrogen oxide conversions of the comparative catalysts VK3<br>
(0; Fe-zeolite-based), VK4 (D; vanadium-containing) and VK5 (x, Fe/W/Zr02) prepared<br>
according to the state of the art. The catalyst according to the invention Kl shows, over<br>
the entire temperature range, better nitrogen oxide conversions in the SCR reaction than<br>
the comparative catalyst according to the state of the art VK5, which is also zeolite-free<br>
and vanadium-free. Moreover, surprisingly, in the temperature range between 300°C<br>
and 500°C the nitrogen oxide conversion performance of VK3, a commercially<br>
available, Fe-zeolite-based catalyst, is exceeded and the conversion performance of the<br>
vanadium-based comparative catalyst VK4 is almost reached.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
A core sample was taken from the catalyst from Comparative Example 2 and was<br>
sulphurized in a stove for a period of 48 hours at a temperature of 350°C in an<br>
atmosphere of 10 vol.% oxygen, 10 vol.% water and 20 vol.-ppm sulphur dioxide in<br>
nitrogen. The resultant catalyst according to the invention K2 was investigated in the<br>
model gas.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the result of the investigation, also in comparison with the existing SCR<br>
catalysts VK3 (0; Fe-zeolite-based), VK4 (a; vanadium-containing) and VK5 (x,<br>
Fe/W/ZrO2). The catalyst according to the invention K2 also exceeds the conversion<br>
performance of VK5 over the entire temperature range and the conversion performance<br>
of the Fe-zeolite-based catalyst VK3 at temperatures above 300°C. The nitrogen oxide<br>
conversion performance of the vanadium-based comparative catalyst VK4 is reached<br>
completely starting from 350°C.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide with a cerium oxide content of<br>
48 wt%, based on its total amount, was activated for the SCR reaction by the<br>
introduction of tungsten. For this, first the amount of water that can be taken up by the<br>
homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide, without the material losing its free-<br>
flowing properties, was determined. The proportion of a tungsten compound with good<br>
water-solubility that corresponded to 10 wt.% tungsten based on the total weight of the<br>
activated cerium-zirconium-oxide that was to be prepared, was dissolved in the<br>
corresponding amount of water. The homogeneous cerium-zirconium oxide was<br>
impregnated with the tungsten-containing solution thus prepared until the pores were<br>
filled, and then, for thermal fixation of the tungsten, was stored in air in the stove at<br>
500°C for 2 hours.<br>
The activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide thus obtained was suspended in water,<br>
ground and applied to a ceramic honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and<br>
number of cells of 62 cells per square centimetre with a wall thickness of 0.17 mm.<br>
After calcination of the honeycomb element in air at 500°C for two hours, a core sample<br>
K3 was taken from the catalyst according to the invention thus prepared, for testing in<br>
the model-gas system, and its nitrogen oxide conversion was investigated.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the result of the investigation of K3 in the model gas in comparison with<br>
the nitrogen oxide conversion performance of the existing SCR catalysts VK3 (0; Fe-<br><br>
zeolite-based), VK4 (□; vanadium-containing) and VK5 (x, Fe/W/ZrO3). K3 shows,<br>
over the entire temperature range, a conversion performance that largely corresponds to<br>
that of the vanadium-based catalyst VK4, which has the highest performance of the<br>
selected comparative catalysts. Slight losses of activity, relative to the vanadium-based<br>
and the zeolite-based comparative catalyst, are only observed for the high-temperature<br>
measurement point at 500°C.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the nitrogen oxide conversion of the freshly prepared catalyst K3 in<br>
comparison with the two comparative catalysts VK6 (*) and VK7 (A), which are also<br>
only composed of cerium oxide, zirconium oxide and tungsten oxide, but do not contain<br>
a defined, homogeneous cerium/zirconium mixed oxide, but at best, as in the case of<br>
VK7, an inhomogeneous mixed species. The catalyst according to the invention shows<br>
far better SCR activity in the temperature range below 300°C.<br>
The decisive advantages of the catalyst according to the invention relative to these<br>
catalysts according to the state of the art are especially pronounced after hydrothermal<br>
ageing.<br>
A second core sample (K3') was exposed at 650°C for 48 hours to an atmosphere<br>
containing 10 vol.% oxygen and 10 vol.% water vapour in air. After this treatment, the<br>
nitrogen oxide conversion on this catalyst was investigated in the model-gas system and<br>
the result was compared with the nitrogen oxide conversions of the similarly aged<br>
comparative catalysts VK6' (*) and VK7' (A). As can be seen from the data shown in<br>
Fig. 9, the catalytic performance of the catalysts according to the state of the art drops<br>
dramatically as a result of hydrothermal ageing. Conversions of 50% nitrogen oxide<br>
conversion are no longer exceeded even at temperatures above 350°C. In contrast, even<br>
after ageing, the catalyst according to the invention K3' still shows nitrogen oxide<br>
conversions of approx. 80% in the temperature range above 300°C.<br>
Example 4:<br>
A homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide with a cerium oxide content of 86 wt.%<br>
and a lanthanum oxide content of 4 wt.%, based on its total amount, was activated for<br>
the SCR reaction by the introduction of iron and tungsten. For this, first the amount of<br>
water that can be taken up by the homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide without<br>
the material losing its free-flowing properties, was determined. The proportion of an<br>
iron(III) compound with good water-solubility that corresponded to 1.3 wt.% iron, and<br>
the proportion of a tungsten compound of good solubility that corresponded to 10 wt.%<br><br>
tungsten, were dissolved in the corresponding amount of water. (The figures for the<br>
contents were based on the total weight of the activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide<br>
that was to be prepared.) The homogeneous cerium-zirconium oxide was impregnated<br>
with the iron-containing and tungsten-containing solution until the pores were filled,<br>
and then, for thermal fixation of the transition metals, was stored in air in the stove at<br>
500°C for 2 hours.<br>
The activated cerium-zirconium mixed oxide thus obtained was suspended in water,<br>
ground and applied to a ceramic honeycomb element with a volume of 0.5 L and<br>
number of cells of 62 cells per square centimetre with a wall thickness of 0.17 mm.<br>
After calcination of the honeycomb element in air at 500°C for two hours, a core sample<br>
K4 was taken from the catalyst according to the invention thus prepared, for testing in<br>
the model-gas system, and its nitrogen oxide conversion was investigated.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the result of the investigation of K4 in the model gas in comparison with<br>
the nitrogen oxide conversion performance of the existing SCR catalysts VK3 (0; Fe-<br>
zeolite-based), VK4 (n; vanadium-containing) and VK5 (x, Fe/W/ZrC)2). In the<br>
temperature range 150 to 400°C, K4 displays nitrogen oxide conversion performance<br>
roughly corresponding to that of the commercial vanadium-containing catalyst VK4 and<br>
well above that of the vanadium-free comparative catalysts VK3 and VK5. The decline<br>
in nitrogen oxide conversion above 450°C results from a loss of selectivity, due to the<br>
overoxidation of ammonia that occurs at high temperatures.<br>
Example 5;<br>
According to the procedure described in Example 4, another activated cerium-zirconium<br>
mixed oxide and another catalyst according to the invention were prepared, using, as<br>
raw material, a homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide that contained 48 wt.%<br>
cerium oxide based on the total weight of the homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed<br>
oxide. Two core samples with a diameter of 25.4 mm and a length of 76.2 mm were<br>
taken from the catalyst obtained. One of the core samples (K5) was submitted, in the<br>
freshly prepared state, to investigation of SCR activity.<br>
The second core sample (K5') was first aged at 650°C for 48 hours in an atmosphere<br>
consisting of 10 vol.% O2 and 10 vol.% oxygen in air. Then the nitrogen oxide<br>
conversion of this core sample was also investigated in the model gas.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the result of determinations of the nitrogen oxide conversions of K5<br>
(freshly prepared) and K5' (hydrothermally aged) in comparison with the similarly<br><br>
hydrothermally aged comparative catalysts VK3' (0; Fe-zeolite-based), VK4' (a;<br>
vanadium-containing) and VK5' (x, Fe/W/ZrO2). It is clear that the catalyst according to<br>
the invention K5, in the fresh state, displays excellent nitrogen oxide conversion<br>
performance especially in the temperature range 150 to 400°C. The decline in nitrogen<br>
oxide conversion starting from 450°C results - as with K4 - from the overoxidation of<br>
ammonia.<br>
Comparison of the performance of the hydrothermally aged core sample K5' with the<br>
conversion performance of the hydrothermally aged commercial catalysts also provides<br>
evidence of excellent ageing resistance of the catalyst according to the invention.<br>
Example 6:<br>
Another core sample was taken from the catalyst prepared in Example 5 and was<br>
sulphurized in a stove at 350°C for a period of 48 hours in an atmosphere of 10 vol.%<br>
oxygen and 20 vol.-ppm sulphur dioxide in nitrogen. The resultant catalyst according to<br>
the invention K6, which contains cerium-zirconium mixed oxide activated by the<br>
introduction of tungsten, iron and sulphur, was investigated in the model gas.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the result of the activity tests in comparison with the existing SCR<br>
catalysts VK3 (0; Fe-zeolite-based), VK4 (a; vanadium-containing) and VK5 (x,<br>
Fe/W/ZrO2). K6 shows excellent nitrogen oxide conversion performance in the<br>
temperature range between 300 and 450°C. The nitrogen oxide conversions in the low-<br>
temperature range are completely comparable with those of the zeolite-based<br>
comparative catalyst VK3. K6 is another example of a catalyst according to the<br>
invention that is characterized by excellent conversion performance in the SCR reaction<br>
with ammonia.<br>
All the examples show that by deliberate introduction of sulphur and/or transition metal<br>
in a homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide, extremely effective activation of the<br>
material for the SCR reaction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia takes place and the<br>
correspondingly prepared catalysts are suitable as an alternative to the existing zeolite-<br>
and/or vanadium-based standard technologies.<br><br>

Selective catalytic reduction with ammonia or a compound that decomposes to ammonia is a known method for the removal of nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gas of primarily lean-burn internal combustion engines. The vanadium-containing SCR catalysts that have long been generally used for this are characterized by a good conversion profile. However, the volatility of vanadium oxide can, at higher exhaust gas temperatures, lead to the emission of toxic vanadium compounds. Zeolite-based SCR catalysts, which are<br>
used in particular in discontinuous SCR systems, constitute a very cost-intensive solution for the problem. A method is proposed by which a homogeneous cerium-zirconium mixed oxide is<br>
activated for the SCR reaction in a defined manner by the introduction of sulphur and/or<br>
transition metal. Using this method, a highly active, ageing-resistant SCR catalyst is<br>
provided, which represents a vanadium-free, cost-effective and high-performance alternative to the existing SCR catalysts and is suitable in particular for use in motor vehicles.</td>
