The present invention relates to an improved process for converting an insulin precursor into<br>
an insulin compound, optionally via an insulin ester.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION<br>
Insulin is a pancreatic hormone involved in the regulation of blood-glucose concentrations.<br>
For example, human, porcine, and bovine insulin, insulin analogues and mixed insulins are<br>
given to patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to control their blood-glucose<br>
concentrations.<br>
Porcine and bovine insulin are, usually, prepared from pancreas glands. Human<br>
insulin can, semisynthetically, be prepared from porcine insulin. Alternatively, human insulin,<br>
as well as many insulin analogues, can be prepared by genetic engineering. By genetic<br>
engineering, which may, for example, be performed in bacteria or in yeast, an insulin<br>
precursor is prepared which, thereafter, is to be converted into the desired product. This<br>
conversion can be performed in different ways.<br>
One possibility is the so-called transpeptidation where a peptide cleavage and a<br>
peptide coupling takes place consecutively in the same reaction mixture, under the same<br>
reaction conditions, vide, for example, US patent No. 4,343,898 (Novo Industri).<br>
Another possibility is, in the first step, to cleave the insulin precursor, wofe, for<br>
example, Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Cliem. 359 (1978), 799, thereafter, to isolate the<br>
intermediate product and, then, to perform the desired coupling in another reaction mixture<br>
than that used in the first step, vide, for example. Nature 280 (1979), 412.<br>
According to EP 87,238, a transpeptidation reaction is performed in a solvent system<br>
comprising between about 75% and 97% (vol/vol) of at least one non-aqueous reaction<br>
miscible solvent including at least about 50% (vol/vol) butane-1,4-diol.<br>
According to US 4,579,820, the transpeptidation process is performed using an L-<br>
specific serine carboxypeptidase enzyme, for example carboxypeptidase Y.<br>
According to US 4,601,979 (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium), the transpeptidation or only<br>
the peptide coupling is performed in an aqueous reaction medium substantially free of<br>
organic solvent.<br>
According to WO 83/00504 (Nordisk insulinlaboratorium), a porcine product was<br>
treated with carboxypeptidase A, the resulting des-alanine-B30 insulin product was<br>
suspended in a lower alcohol, and this suspension was mixed with a solution of an L-<br>
threonine ester and trypsin. In all the specific examples, the des-alanine-B30 insulin product<br>
was isolated, either by freeze-drying or by precipitation.<br>

amino acid from which hydroxy has been removed from a carboxy group and/or hydrogen<br>
has been removed from an amino group.<br>
Similarly, the terms peptide and peptide residue consists of amino acid residues.<br>
Preferably, the peptide contains not more than 10 amino acid residues.<br>

disulphide bridges (from one cysteine (Cys) residue to another cysteine residue) between<br>
the two peptide chains and wherein, lilce in insulin, there is an disulphide bridge from one<br>
cysteine residue in the A chain to another cysteine residue in the A chain. In this insulin<br>
precursor there is, at least, one lysine or arginine residue in the B chain. Optionally, in this<br>
insulin precursor, the A and B chains are connected with each other via a third peptide chain<br>
(corresponding to the connecting peptide in insulin) between the C terminal end of the B<br>
chain and the N terminal end of the A chain. In case the A and B chains are connected with<br>
each other via this third peptide chain, lysine is present at the C terminal end of this third<br>
peptide. Optionally, in this insulin precursor, a fourth peptide chain may be connected to the<br>
N terminal end of the B chain. In case this fourth peptide chain is connected to the N<br>
terminal end of the B chain, lysine is present at the C terminal end of this fourth peptide<br>
chain. Furthermore, in this insulin precursor, there is an identity of the amino acid residues of<br>
at least 80 %, preferably at least 85 %, more preferred at lest 90 %, and even more<br>
preferred at least 95%, compared with human insulin, with the proviso that the third and<br>

Preferably, the peptide ester contains not more than 10 amino acid residues.<br>
The term nucleophile compound, as used herein, refers an amino acid ester, an<br>
amino acid amide, a peptide, a peptide ester, and a peptide amide. In any of these amino<br>
acid esters, amino acid amides, peptides, peptide esters, and peptide amides, the amino<br>
group in any lysine group is, optionally, derivatised, preferably with a hydrophobic group, for<br>
example, an acyl group having at least 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "insulin compound", as used herein, refers to insulin from any species such<br>
as porcine insulin, bovine insulin, and human insulin and salts thereof such as zinc salts, and<br>

with another amino acid residue and/or from which one or more amino acid residue has<br>
been deleted and/or from which one or more amino acid residue has been added, provided<br>
that said insulin analogue has a sufficient insulin activity. Examples of insulin analogues are<br>
described in the following patents and equivalents thereto: US 5,618,913; EP 254,516; EP<br>
280,534; US 5,750,497; and US 6,011,007. Examples of specific insulin analogues are<br>
insulin aspart (i.e., [Asp^^^] human insulin), insulin lispro (i.e., [Lys^^^Pro^^®] human insulin),<br>
and insulin glargin (i.e., [Gly*^\Arg^^\Arg^^^] human insulin). The term "insulin analogue", as<br>
used herein also covers what could be designated insulin derivatives, i.e., compounds which<br>
a skilled art worker would generally considers derivatives of insulin, vide general textbooks,<br>
for example, insulin having a substituent not present in the parent insulin molecule.<br>
Examples of insulin derivatives are insulins or insulin analogues having an optionally<br>
substituted carboxamide group. Also compounds which can be considered being both an<br>
insulin derivative and an insulin analogue are herein covered by the term insulin analogue.<br>
Examples of such compounds are described in the following patents and equivalents<br>
thereto: US 5,750,497 and US 6,011,007. Hence, a further example of a specific insulin<br>
analogue is insulin detemir (i.e., des-Thr^^° human insulin y Lys^^^ tetradecanoyi). The insulin<br>
compounds prepared by this invention have an anti-diabetic activity sufficiently high to be<br>
4<br><br>
used to treat diabetic patients. The anti-diabetic activity can be determined using the so-<br>
called free fat cell assay.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing insulin compounds. These insulin<br>
compounds can be used as medicaments. In a preferred embodiment of this invention,<br>
insulin compounds having threonine (Thr) in the C terminal end of the 8 chain are prepared.<br>
Any sl<illed art worker for example a physician is able to determine which dosages></illed>
of the insulin compounds to administer to a diabetic patient, and when.<br>
The starting material for the process of this invention is an insulin precursor which is<br>
subjected to both a peptide cleavage and a peptide coupling at conditions favoring both<br>
reactions but where no isolation of the intermediate product takes place. In other words, the<br>
insulin precursor is subjected to a peptide cleavage and the resulting product, i.e., the<br>
intermediate, is subjected to a peptide coupling. The conditions favoring a peptide cleavage<br>
are not identical with the conditions favoring a peptide coupling. Hence, in the first step of<br>
this invention, i.e., the cleavage step or the cleavage reaction, the reaction conditions in the<br>
reaction mixture are chosen so as to favor the peptide cleavage and, in the second step of<br>
this invention, i.e., the coupling step or the coupling reaction, the reaction conditions in the<br>
reaction mixture are altered so as to favor the peptide coupling.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the insulin precursor is, in the first step,<br>
dissolved in a predominantly aqueous medium and the enzyme used for cleavage is added.<br>
This reaction mixture may be free or substantially free of organic solvent. Alternatively, the<br>
reaction mixture may contain a certain amount of organic solvent which may ensure a proper<br>
5<br><br>
solubility of the insulin precursor. However, it is desired not to use so much organic solvent<br>
that it has an undesired influence on the enzymatic cleavage. In the first step of the process<br>
of this invention, the reaction parameters such a pH value, temperature, and time, are<br>
chosen so that they are favorable to cleavage at the lysine residue(s) or arginine residue(s).<br>
When the cleavage reaction has taken place to a certain, desired degree, a<br>
nucleophile compound and an organic solvent is mixed with the reaction mixture (without<br>
previous isolation of the intermediate product), so that the coupling of the nucleophile<br>
compound to the lysine or arginine residue of the desired intermediate product takes place.<br>
In this step, the reaction parameters are set so as to be favorable to the coupling reaction. In<br>
a preferred embodiment of this invention, the nucleophile compound is an amino acid ester,<br>
for example a threonine ester, or a peptide ester.<br>
Thereafter, the protecting group(s) may, if desired, be removed from the resulting<br>
compound.<br>
Compared with the known transpeptidation reaction, the advantages obtained by the<br>
process of this invention is a shorter, over all reaction time with the same amount of enzyme<br>
and a similar or higher yield. Compared with a two pot reaction with cleavage in an aqueous<br>
medium, isolation of the intermediate product, and coupling in a mixture of organic solvent<br>
and water, the advantages obtained by the process of this invention is a shorter, over all<br>
reaction time, the use of a lower amount of enzyme, and an easier process flow.<br>
More precisely, this invention relates to the following embodiments:<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION<br>
As appears from claim 1, first a peptide cleavage takes place and, thereafter, a coupling<br>
reaction takes place.<br>
Briefly, the cleavage reaction (i.e., the enzymatic cleavage) is performed as follows:<br>
The enzymatic cleavage of the insulin precursor (i.e., the peptide cleavage) takes place in a<br>
reaction mixture containing at least about 55%, preferably at least about 60%, more<br>
preferred at least 70%, water (weight/weight).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the concentration of the insulin precursor<br>
in the reaction mixture wherein the enzymatic cleavage takes place is at least 2 %,<br>
preferably in the range from about 5 to about 10% (weight/vol).<br>
6<br><br>
The cleavage reaction is performed in a neutral or alkaline medium, preferably<br>
having a pH value in the range from about 6 to about 11, more preferred in the range from<br>
about 8 to about 10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention the amounts of enzyme compared with<br>
the amount of insulin precursor is in the range from approximately 0.05 to approximately 5%<br>
(weight/weight), preferably from approximately 0.1 to approximately 2%.<br>
The tryptic enzyme is not material to practice of this invention. Trypsin is a well-<br>
characterized enzyme available in high purity, notably from bovine or porcine origin. From<br>
microbial origin, Acromobacter lyticus protease I (hereinafter designated ALP) can be<br>
obtained. Moreover, the enzyme form, whether it is a native enzyme or an active<br>
immobilized enzyme or an enzyme derivative, is not material to practice of this invention, if it<br>
is desired to split at the C terminal end of arginine, trypsin can be used and if it is desired to<br>
split at the C terminal end of lysine, either trypsin or ALP can be used. For the splitting at the<br>
C terminal end of lysine, ALP is preferred.<br>
As examples of active enzyme derivatives can be mentioned acetylated trypsin,<br>
succinylated trypsin, glutaraldehyde treated trypsin, and immobilized trypsin or ALP<br>
derivatives.<br>
If an immobilized trypsin or ALP is used, it is suspended in the reaction mixture or<br>
may be packed into a column.<br>
To a great extent, the action of the enzyme is controlled by an interrelation of water<br>
and solvent content, the pH value, and the reaction temperature. Increasing the<br>
concentration of organic solvent in the reaction mixture and lowering of the pH value to<br>
around neutral shifts the usual enzymatic reaction from cleavage towards coupling.<br>
Reducing the temperature reduces the reaction rate, but might also reduce biproduct<br>
formation and enzyme denaturation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the insulin precursor is dissolved in an<br>
aqueous medium having a concentration of acetate ions in the range from about 5 mM to<br>
about 500 mM, preferably in the range from about 20 mM to about 200 mM. For example,<br>
sodium, potassium, ammonium acetate ortriethyl ammonium acetate can be used.<br>

which, optionally, one or two of the amino acid residues have been exchanged with another<br>
amino acid residue or wherein one or two of the amino acid residues are not present.<br>
During both the cleavage reaction and the coupling reaction, the reaction<br>
temperature is in the range from the freezing point of the reaction mixture to about 50°C. The<br>
preferred temperature is in the range from about 0°C to about 25°C.<br>
Briefly, the coupling reaction is performed as follows:<br>
When at least about 25 %, preferably at least 50 %, more preferred at least 75 %, preferably<br>
at least 85 %, more preferred at least 95 %, of the insulin precursor has been cleaved to the<br>
desired intermediate product, on one hand, the nucleophile compound and, on the other<br>
hand, organic solvent is mixed with the reaction mixture in which the cleavage took place so<br>
as to obtain reaction conditions which are convenient or favorable to the coupling step. The<br>
percentage of cleavage (conversion) is based upon the equilibrium possible in the reaction<br>
mixture used for cleavage. Usually, from the beginning of the enzymatic cleavage reaction<br>
and until a certain period of time has lapsed, the yield of the desired intermediate product,<br>
10<br><br>
i.e., the desired cleavage product, increases and reaches a maximum concentration.<br>
Thereafter, the concentration of the desired cleavage product may decrease.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, no components are removed from the<br>
reaction mixture resulting from the cleavage reaction before the coupling reaction takes<br>
place. A simple way of doing this is, after the cleavage reaction, to add the nucelophile<br>
compound and a sufficient amount of organic solvent. In this way, for example, the enzyme<br>
used in the cleavage step is also used in the coupling step.<br>
The process of this invention also covers coupling reactions in a reaction mixture<br>
which besides the desired intermediate product contains a small amount of partially cleaved<br>
insulin precursor and/or unreacted insulin precursor.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of this invention, the nucleophile compound is an<br>
amino acid amide or a peptide amide wherein the carboxamide group isn't substituted or is<br>
mono or disubstituted with an alkyl group with not more than 16 carbon atoms which alkyl<br>
group(s), together with the adjacent nitrogen atom, may form a ring or the carboxamide<br>
group is mono or disubstituted with an aryl group. The aliphatic substituents are preferred.<br>
Examples of substituted carboxamide groups are N,N-dimethylcarboxamide, N,N-diethyl-<br>
carboxamide, and N-hexylcarboxamide.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the nucleotide compound is an amino<br>
acid ester wherein the carboxyl group is protected and any hydroxy group optionally is<br>
protected. In a further preferred embodiment of this invention, the nucleotide compound is a<br>
threonine ester wherein the carboxyl group is protected and, optionally, the hydroxy group is<br>
protected. Hence, an L-threonine ester can be illustrated by the following general formula<br>
Ilia:<br>
Thr(R')-OR'	(Ilia)<br>
wherein R® represents a carboxyl protecting group, and R^ represents hydrogen or a<br>
hydroxyl protecting group. To make it more clear, a threonine ester can be illustrated by the<br>
general formula CH3-CH(OR^)-CH(NH2)COOR^ wherein R^ and R^ are as mentioned above.<br>
Some nucleophile compounds are known compounds and the remaining nucleophile<br>
compounds can be prepared in analogy with the preparation of known compounds or in<br>
analogy with known methods.<br>
The nucleophile compounds may be employed in the form of the free base or soluble<br>
salts thereof such as hydrochlorides, acetates, propionates, and butyrates.<br>
When the coupling reaction starts, it is desirable that a substantial excess of<br>
nucleophile compound is present in the coupling reaction mixture solution, with the molar<br>
11<br><br>
ratio I	,	,	^	^	^<br>
exceeding about 5;1. When the coupling reaction starts, the concentration of the nucleophile<br>
compound in the reaction mixture should preferably exceed 0.1 molar, the upper<br>
concentration	limit	being	the	solubility	thereof.<br>
To obtain a 60% yield considered herein as an important aspect to practice of this<br>
invention, the reaction temperature, water content and pH value are interrelated within the<br>
described ranges.<br>
The organic solvents suited to practice of this invention are polar solvents which are<br>
miscible with water and preferably such that are capable of containing therein high<br>
concentrations of the desired intermediate product (for example of formula II) and the<br>
nucleophile compound. Examples of suitable organic solvents are aprotic solvents, such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone-2, and dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, and protic solvents, such as acetic acid, ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol, 1-<br>
propanol, butanol and 1,4-butanediol. Dioxane, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, formamide, and<br>
acetonitrile may also be used and even an amino acid ester used as the nucleophile<br>
compound can, fully or partially, be used as the organic solvent. The nature of the solvent<br>
does affect the system as a whole, and interrelationships suited to one solvent productive of<br>
high yields may not apply with a different solvent. Best yield results have been obtained with<br>
aprotic solvents, and aprotic solvents are most preferred for practice of this invention.<br>
Obviously, when calculating or determining the content of water in the reaction<br>
mixture, the nucleophile compound is considered an organic solvent.<br>
The addition of an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic<br>
acid, or butyric acid, or of a base, such as pyridine, TRIS, N-methylmorpholine,<br>
triethylamine, or N-ethylmorpholine, is optional. They are included in the reaction mixture to<br>
bring about a suitable pH value. Although mineral acids or bases may be used in practice of<br>
this invention, organic acids and bases are preferred, particularly those identified above.<br>
Organic acids are most preferred.<br>
When the coupling reaction starts, the weight ratio between trypsin or ALP<br>
(calculated as crystalline trypsin or ALP or an amount of trypsin or ALP derivative<br>
corresponding thereto) and the desired intermediate product in the reaction mixture is<br>
preferably in the range from about 1:1000 to about 1:10, more preferred in the range from<br>
about	1:200	to	about	1:50.<br>
In some cases, the enzyme added in the cleavage step is sufficient for performing<br>
the coupling reaction and, in such case, there is no need for adding a further amount of<br>
enzyme during the coupling step. In other cases, it may be desirable to add an additional<br>
amount of enzyme during the coupling step.<br>
12<br><br>
Inasmuch as high concentrations of the desired intermediate product and of<br>
nucleophile compound in solution promote high conversion rates, solvent selection is biased<br>
towards those solvents in which the reactants are very soluble. The solubility of the<br>
nucleophile compound in particular is important, because that reactant should be present in<br>
high concentration. When the coupling reaction starts, the molar ratio of the nucleophile<br>
compound to the desired intermediate product should preferably exceed 5:1, preferably<br>
exceed 50:1. When the coupling reaction starts, the concentration of the nucleophile<br>
compound    in   the   reaction   mixture   should    preferably   be   at   least   0.1    molar.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a nucleophile compound having carboxy<br>
protecting group(s) which can be removed from the resulting insulin compound under<br>
conditions, which do not cause substantial irreversible alterations in the insulin molecule, is<br>
used. As examples of such carboxyi protecting groups can be mentioned lower alkyl, for<br>
example, methyl, ethyl, and tert-butyl, substituted benzyl groups such as p-methoxybenzyl,<br>
diphenylmethyl, and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl, and groups of the general formula<br>
-CH2-CH2-S02R^ wherein R^ represents lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-<br>
butyl.<br>
Suitable hydroxyl protecting groups are those which can be removed under<br>
conditions which do not cause substantial irreversible alteration in the insulin molecule. As<br>
an example of such a group can be mentioned ferf-butyl.<br>
Further protection groups usually used are described by Wunch; Metoden der<br>
Organischen Chemie (Houben-Weyl), Vol. XV/1, editor: Eugen Muller, Georg Thieme Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart 1974.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, the process of this Invention will<br>
result in a compound of the general formula IV:<br>
R'^-Cys-Zn-Cys-R'^<br>
I	I	(IV)<br>
R'-Cys-Zm-Cys-R'^-R'<br>
wherein Zn and Zm, independent of each other, represents two peptide moieties each<br>
containing n and m amino acid residues, respectively, R'^ represents a peptide residue, R'^<br>
represents an amino acid residue or a peptide residue, R'^ represents a peptide residue, R'"<br>
is as mentioned above, and R'® is an amino acid carrying a carboxy protecting group or a<br>
peptide residue, optionally carrying a carboxy protecting group.<br>
Any carboxy protecting group (for example, R®) and any hydroxy protecting group (for<br>
example, R^) present in an insulin compounds can be removed by known methods or<br>
methods known per se. In case the carboxy protecting group is methyl, ethyl, or a group of<br>
13<br><br>
the general formula -CH2-CH2-S02R^ wherein R^ is as defined above, said protecting group<br>
can be removed at gentle basic conditions in an aqueous medium, preferably at a pH value<br>
in the range from about 8 to about 12, for example, at about 9.5. As the base can be used<br>
strong bases, for example, a tertiary amine, for example triethylamine, hydroxides of alkali<br>
metals such as sodium hydroxide or hydroxides of alkaline earth metals such as calcium, or<br>
magnesium hydroxide, in case the carboxy protecting group is fert-butyl, substituted benzyl<br>
such as p-methoxybenzyl or 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl, or diphenylmethyl, said group can be<br>
removed by acidolysis, preferably with trifluoroacetic acid. The trifluoroacetic acid may be<br>
nonaqueous or may contain some water, or it may be diluted with an organic solvent, such<br>
as dichloromethane. In case the hydroxy protecting group (for example, R^) is tert-butyl,<br>
said        group        can        be        removed        by        acidolysis,	vide        above.<br>
Preferably, the insulin compounds prepared have no hydroxy protecting group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the process of this invention converts the<br>
insulin precursor (for example, of formula I) into an insulin compound (for example, formula<br>
IV), having a carboxy protecting group in the C terminal amino acid residue in the B chain<br>
which, then, can be deblocked to form an insulin compound having no carboxy protecting<br>
group.<br>
When selecting the reaction conditions according to the above explanation and<br>
considering the results obtained in the following examples it is possible to obtain a yield of<br>
insulin compound which is higher than 60%, and even higher than 80%, and under certain<br>
preferred conditions higher than 90%.<br>
By the process of this invention, insulin compounds of an acceptable purity can be<br>
obtained and be further purified, if desired, for therapeutic purpose.<br>
More specifically, insulin aspart may, for example, be prepared by enzymatic<br>
cleavage with ALP of an insulin precursor such as [Asp^^]-des(30-65) human proinsulin<br>
being N-terminally extended with Glu-(Glu-Ala)3-Pro-Lys- (SEQ ID NO.: 1) and coupling with<br>
a nucleophile compound such as L-threonine methyl ester, followed by hydrolysis.<br>
insulin lispro may, for example, be prepared by enzymatic cleavage with trypsin of a<br>
precursor such as porcine insulin and coupling with a nucleophile compound such as Gly-<br>
Phe-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Lys-Pro-Thr (SEQ ID NO.: 3).<br>
Insulin glargin may, for example, be prepared by enzymatic cleavage with ALP of an<br>
insulin precursor such as [Gly^®]-des(30-65) human proinsulin and coupling with a<br>
nucleophile compound such as Thr-Arg-Arg-OMe, followed by hydrolysis.<br>

The following examples are offered by way of illustration, not by limitation.<br>
Example 1.<br>
200 mg [Ala^\Lys^^]-des(33-63) porcine proinsulin was suspended in 1.35 ml water and the<br>
pH value was adjusted to 9 with 10 ^1 triethylamine. A mixture of 375 |j| N,N-dimethyl-<br>
acetamide and 460 |jl water was added with slightly agitation and to the resulting solution<br>
was added 315 |j| of a 5.4 mg/ml aqueous solution of Achromobacter lyticus lysyl specific<br>
protease (EC 3.4.21.50) (herein designated ALP). The pH value was adjusted to 9.8 with 20<br>
|j| triethylamine and the reaction solution was left for 1 hour at 23°C. The reaction solution<br>
was acidified by addition of 70 (JI 4 N hydrochloric acid and cooled in an ice bath. A solution<br>
of 300 mg L-threonine methyl ester in 4.85 ml N,N-dimethylacetamide was added and the<br>
pH value was adjusted to 6.5 by addition of 450 |jl 4 N hydrochloric acid. The reaction<br>
solution was left for 4 hours at 23°C after which the reaction was stopped by addition of<br>
hydrochloric acid to a pH value 
5 pm C18 silica column with an ethanol-water eluent containing 0.125 M ammonium<br>
sulphate adjusted to a pH value 4, a conversion yield of 86% to human insulin methyl ester<br>
was found after a total reaction time of 5 hours.<br>
For comparison, a one-step conversion was performed:<br>
100 mg [Ala^\Lys^^]-des(33-63) porcine proinsulin was suspended in a mixture of<br>
887 |jl water and 175 |JI N,N-dimethylacetamide. 150 mg L-threonlne methyl ester was<br>
dissolved in 2.265 ml N,N-dimethylacetamide and was slowly added to the ice-cooled<br>
mixture. The pH value was adjusted to 6.5 with 340 |jl acetic acid and 158 \^\ of a 5.4 mg/ml<br>
aqueous solution of ALP was added. The conversion reaction was followed by RP-HPLC<br>
analysis of acidified samples. After 5 hours, a 53% conversion to human insulin methyl ester<br>
was found and after 24 hours the conversion reached a maximum of 87%.<br>
15<br><br>
The isolated human insulin methyl ester was converted into human insulin by<br>
dissolution in water at a pH value of 10 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The reaction was<br>
terminated after 24 hours by adjusting the pH value to 5.2 with 1 N hydrochloric acid and the<br>
precipitated human insulin was isolated by centrifugation and purified by reverse phase high<br>
performance liquid chromatography.<br>
At the same reaction time, i.e., 5 hours, the yield by the process of this invention,<br>
compared with the per se known process, was improved with 62 %. The two processes<br>
obtained almost the same yield, if the reaction time of the per se known one-step conversion<br>
was extended almost 5 times, compared with the reaction time for the process of this<br>
invention.<br>
Example 2.<br>
200 mg porcine insulin was suspended in 1.37 ml water and a mixture of 294 [i\ N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidon and 326 |jl water was added with slightly agitation. The pH value was adjusted to<br>
9.0 with 10 |jl 2 N sodium hydroxide and to the resulting solution was added 315 M' of a 5.4<br>
mg/ml aqueous solution of ALP. The pH value was adjusted to 9.8 with 12 |jl 2 N sodium<br>
hydroxide and the reaction solution was left for 4 hours at 23°C. The reaction solution was<br>
acidified by addition of 70 |jl 4 N hydrochloric acid and cooled in an ice bath. A solution of<br>
300 mg L-threonine methyl ester in 4.4 ml N-methyl-2-pyrrolidon was acidified with 500 |jl 4<br>
N hydrochloric acid. The insulin solution was slowly added and the pH value was adjusted to<br>
6.5 with 50 |jl 2 N hydrochloric acid. The reaction solution was left for 4 hours at 23°C after<br>
which the reaction was stopped by addition of hydrochloric acid to a pH value 
reversed phase HPLC analysis on a 4mm x 250 mm 5 |jm C18 silica column with an<br>
ethanol-water eluent containing 0.125 M ammonium sulphate adjusted to a pH value 4, a<br>
conversion yield of 86% to human insulin methyl ester was found after a total reaction time<br>
of 8 hours.<br>
For comparison, a one-step conversion was performed:<br>
100 mg porcine insulin was suspended in a mixture of 848 pi water and 147 pi N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidon. 150 mg L-threonine methyl ester was dissolved in 2.2 ml N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidon and was slowly added to the ice-cooled mixture. The pH value was adjusted to 6.5<br>
with 300 pi acetic acid and 158 pi of a 5.4 mg/ml aqueous solution of ALP was added. The<br>
reaction solution was left at 23°C and the conversion reaction was followed by RP-HPLC<br>
analysis of acidified samples. After 8 hours, the conversion was found to 54% and after 48<br>
hours a conversion maximum of 86% to human insulin methyl ester was reached.<br>
16<br><br>
The isolated human insulin methyl ester can be converted to human insulin by<br>
alkaline hydrolysis.<br>
At the same reaction time, i.e., 8 hours, the yield by the process of this invention was<br>
improved with 59 %, compared with the perse known process. The two processes obtained<br>
the same yield, if the reaction time of the per se known one-step conversion was extended 6<br>
times, compared with the reaction time for the process of this invention.<br>
Example 3.<br>
200 mg [Asp^^]-des(30-65) human proinsulin, N-terminally extended with the peptide Glu-<br>
(Glu-Ala)3-Pro-Lys- (SEQ ID NO.: 1), was suspended in 1.35 ml water. A mixture of 350 ^1<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and 425 |jl water was added with slightly agitation and the pH value<br>
was adjusted to 9 with 45 |jl triethylamine. To the resulting solution was added 200 pi of a<br>
8.5 mg/ml aqueous solution of ALP and the pH value was adjusted to 9.8 with 20 pi triethyl-<br>
amine. The reaction solution was left for 1 hour at 23°C. The reaction solution was acidified<br>
by addition of 70 pi 4 N hydrochloric acid and cooled in an ice bath. A solution of 300 mg L-<br>
threonine methyl ester in 4.95 ml N,N-dimethylformamide was added and the pH value was<br>
adjusted to 6.5 by addition of 470 pi 4 N hydrochloric acid. The reaction solution was left for<br>
4 hours at 23°C after which the reaction was stopped by addition of hydrochloric acid to a pH<br>
value 
with an ethanol-water eluent containing 0.125 M ammonium sulphate adjusted to a pH value<br>
4, a conversion yield of 87% to [Asp^^^j-human insulin methyl ester was found after a total<br>
reaction time of 5 hours.<br>
For comparison, a one-step conversion was performed:<br>
90 mg [Asp^^]-des(30-65) human proinsulin, N-terminally extended with the peptide<br>
Glu-(Glu-Ala)3-Pro-Lys- (SEQ ID NO.: 1), was suspended in a mixture of 887 pi water and<br>
175 pi N,N-dimethylformamide. 150 mg L-threonine methyl ester was dissolved in 2.13 ml<br>
N,N-dimethyiformamide and was slowly added to the ice-cooled mixture. The pH value was<br>
adjusted to 6.5 with 250 pi acetic acid and 118 pi of a 8.5 mg/ml aqueous solution of ALP<br>
was added. The conversion reaction was followed by RP-HPLC analysis of acidified<br>
samples. After 5 hours, the conversion was found to 47% and after 24 hours the conversion<br>
to [Asp^^^j-human insulin methyl ester reached a maximum of 81%.<br>
The isolated insulin methyl ester can be converted to [Asp^^^j-human insulin by<br>
alkaline hydrolysis.<br>
17<br><br>
At the same reaction time, i.e., 5 hours, the yield by the process of this invention was<br>
almost doubled, compared with the perse known process. Comparable yields ware obtained<br>
by the two processes, if the reaction time of the per se known one-step conversion was<br>
extended nearly 5 times, compared with the reaction time for the process of this invention.<br>
Example 4<br>
1.5 g insulin aspart precursor [Asp^^Met^^Trp^^Lys^^]-des(33-65) human proinsulin, N-<br>
terminally extended with the peptide Glu-Glu-Gly-Glu-Pro-Lys- (SEQ ID NO.: 2) was<br>
suspended in 3.5 g water. With slight agitation and at ambient temperature, the precursor<br>
was dissolved by gradually adding 4M sodium hydroxide to a pH value of 10.67. 3.7 g of a<br>
45 % (weight/weight) solution of ethanol in water was added.1.5 ml of a 5.8 mg/ml aqueous<br>
solution of ALP was added and the mixture was left to react for 2 hours. The pH value was<br>
adjusted to 4.7 by addition of 4 N hydrochloric acid. 2.025 g L-threonine ethyl ester was<br>
dissolved in 16.2 ml ethanol and the solution was added at a maximum temperature of 15°C.<br>
The pH value was adjusted to 6.5 with 4 N hydrochloric acid. The temperature was adjusted<br>
to ambient temperature and the reaction mixture was left for 20 hours at this temperature. By<br>
reversed phase HPLC analysis on a 4mm x 250 mm 5 pm CI8 silica column with an<br>
acetonitrile-water eluent containing 200mM sodium sulphate adjusted to a pH value of 3.6, a<br>
conversion yield of 89.1 % insulin aspart ethyl ester was found after 1 hours reaction time<br>
and after 20 hours reaction time, a conversion yield of 90.5% was found.<br>
The isolated insulin aspart ethyl ester can be converted to insulin aspart by alkaline<br>
hydrolysis.<br>
Example 5<br>
10.9 g insulin aspart precursor [Asp^^Met^°,Trp^^Lys^^]-des(33-65) human proinsulin, N-<br>
terminally extended with the peptide Glu-Glu-Gly-Glu-Pro-Lys- (SEQ ID NO.: 2) was<br>
suspended in 49.3 g water. With slight agitation and at ambient temperature, the precursor<br>
was dissolved by gradually adding 37.6 g from a mixture containing 0.36 M sodium<br>
hydroxide, 0.27 M sodium acetate and 36 % N-methyl-2-pyrrolidon. The pH value was<br>
adjusted to 9.7 with 9.2 ml 0.5 M sodium hydroxide. 7.1 mL of a 7.1 mg/mL aqueous solution<br>
of ALP was added, and the mixture was left to react for 5 hours. The pH value was kept<br>
constant at 9.7 by adding more 0.5 M sodium hydroxide throughout the reaction. The<br>
18<br><br>
reaction mixture was cooled to 5 °C and the pH value was adjusted to 5.7 by addition of 2.73<br>
g 4 N hydrochloric acid. 14.02 g L-threonine ethyl ester was added and the pH value was<br>
adjusted to 6.0 with 4 N hydrochloric acid. 344 g cold (4 °C) N-methyl-2-pyrrolidon was<br>
added. The temperature was adjusted to 22 °C and the pH value adjusted to 6.5 with 4 N<br>
hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was left for 9 hours at this temperature. By reversed<br>
phase HPLC analysis on a 4mm x 250 mm 5 pm C18 silica column with an acetonitrile-water<br>
eluent containing 200mM sodium sulphate adjusted to a pH value of 3.6, a conversion yield<br>
of 87.5 % to insulin aspart ethyl ester was found after a total reaction time of 14 hours.<br>
The isolated insulin aspart ethyl ester can be converted to insulin aspart by alkaline<br>
hydrolysis.<br><br><br>
