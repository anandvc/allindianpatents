Mixture of sulfide dyes<br>
The present invention relates to mixtures of sulfide dyes, compositions thereof, and to their use for the dyeing of organic materials, such as keratin fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, especially keratin-containing fibers, cotton or nylon, and preferably hair, more preferably human hair.<br>
It is known, for example, from WO 95/01772 that cationic dyes can be used for the dyeing of organic material, for example keratin, silk, cellulose or cellulose derivatives, and also synthetic fibers, for example polyamides. Cationic dyes exhibit very brilliant shades. A disadvantage is their unsatisfactory fastness to washing.<br>
The technical problem is to provide dyes that are distinguished by deep dying having good fastness properties with respect to washing, light, shampooing and rubbing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a dye composition comprising a mixture of dyes selected from the compounds of formula (1)   D^—(Z^)^—Y^—S—A , wherein<br>

R31 is hydrogen; C1-C5-alkoxy; halogen; or-NR69R70, wherein<br>
R69 and R70, independently from each other are hydrogen; C1-C12alkyl; "(CO)-H; or<br>
-(C0)-Ci-C5alkyl; and An  is an anion.<br>
Examples of these dyes are listed in the Table below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
All compounds of the present invention mentioned above can exist as hydrates or solvates.<br>
The mixture of dyes according to the invention are suitable for dyeing organic materials, such as keratin-containing fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, cotton or nylon, and preferably human hair. The dyeings obtained are distinguished by their depth of shade and their good fastness properties for example to washing, fastness to light, shampooing and rubbing. The stabilities, in particular the storage stability of the dyes and the dyes in formulations according to the invention are excellent.<br>
Gernerally, hair dyeing agents on a synthetic base may be classiefied itnto three groups: temporary dyeing agents semipermanent dyeing agents, and permanent dyeing agents.<br>
 <br>
The multiplicity of shades of the dyes can be increased by combination with other dyes.<br>
Therefore the mixture of dyes of the present invention may be combined with dyes of the same or other classes of dyes, especially with direct dyes, oxidation dyes; dye precursor combinations of a coupler compound as well as a diazotized compound, or a capped diazotized compound; and/or cationic reactive dyes.<br>
Direct dyes are of natural origin or may be prepared synthetically. They are uncharged, cationic or anionic, such as acid dyes.<br>
The mixture of dyes may be used in combination with at least one single direct dye different from the dyes of formula (1) and (2).<br>
Direct dyes do not require any addition of an oxidizing agent to develop their dyeing effect. Accordingly the dyeing results are less permanent than those obtained with permanent dyeing compositions. Direct dyes are therefore preferably used for semipermanent hair dyeings.<br>
Examples of direct dyes are described in "Dermatology", edited by Ch. Culnan, H. Maibach, Verlag Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, Basle, 1986, Vol. 7, Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, chapter 7, p. 248-250, and in "Europaisches inventar der Kosmetikrohstoffe", 1996, published by The European Commission, obtainable in diskette form from the Bundesverband der deutschen Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen fur Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und Korperpflegemittel e.V., Mannheim.<br>

Suitable aqueous cosmetic carriers include, for example W/0, OM, OAA//0, W/OA/V or PIT emulsions and all kinds of microemulsions, creams, sprays, emulsions, gels, powders and also surfactant-containing foaming solutions, e.g. shampoos or other preparations, that are suitable for use on keratin-containing fibers. Such forms of use are described in detail in Research Disclosure 42448 (August 1999). If necessary, it is also possible to incorporate the dyeing compositions into anhydrous carriers, as described, for example, in US-3 369 970, especially col 1, I. 70 to col 3,1. 55. The dyeing compositions according to the invention are also excellently suitable for the dyeing method described in DE-A-3 829 870 using a dyeing comb or a dyeing brush.<br>

 <br>
  alkali metal salts of ether carboxylic acids, alkali metal oxides, hydroxides or alcoholates are used as catalysts.<br>
The use of products having restricted homologue distribution may be preferred.<br>
Examples of cationic surfactants that can be used in the dyeing compositions according to the invention are especially quaternary ammonium compounds.

Alkylamidoamines. especially fatty acid amidoamines, such as the stearylamidopropyl-dimethylamine obtainable under the name Tego Amid 18 are alos preffered as surfactants in<br>
the present dyeing compositions. They are distinguished not only by a good conditioning action but also especially by their good biodegradability.<br>
Quaternary ester compounds, so-called "esterquats", such as the methyl hydroxyalkyl-dialkoyloxyalkylammonium methosulfates marketed under the trademark Stepantex®, are also<br>
very readily biodegradable.<br>
An example of a quaternary sugar derivative that can be used as cationic surfactant is the commercial product Glucquat®100, according to CTFA nomenclature a "lauryl methyl glu-ceth-10 hydroxypropyl dimonium chloride".<br>
 <br>
The alkyi-group-containing compounds used as surfactants may be single substances, but the use of natural raw materials of vegetable or animal origin is generally preferred in the preparation of such substances, with the result that the substance mixtures obtained have different alky! chain lengths according to the particular starting material used.<br>
The mixture of dyes of the present invention are suitable for the dyeing of organic materiaL perferably keratin-containig fibers.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of treating keratin-containig fibers with the mixture of dyes of the present invention.<br>

(a)	optionally a reduction agent,<br>
(b)	a mixture of dyes of the present invention s defined above, and<br>
(c)	with an oxidizing agent.<br>
 <br>
The step (a) may be of short duration from o.1 sec to 30 minutes, fro example from 0.1 seconds to 10 minutes with a rducing agent mentioned above.<br>
