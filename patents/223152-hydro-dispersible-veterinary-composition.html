				<td>HYDRO-DISPERSIBLE VETERINARY COMPOSITION Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a stable, safe and an efficient hydro-dispersible synergistic composition containing Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer), Oil of Melaleuca in combination with a solvent, stabilizer and emulsifiers having cent percent tick-kill rate (acaricidal activity) and fly repellent activity. The said composition also provides an enhanced protection time for re-infestation by parasites. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the composition.<br>
Background and Prior art of the invention<br>
Dairy animals suffer from heavy infestation of external parasites like ticks, mites, lice and flies. The infestation is particularly severe in tropical countries in Asia and Africa and more so in summers.<br>
Cattle can be infested with several types of ticks like Boophilus spcs, Hyalomma species, Amblyomma species, Rhipicephalus species, Haemaphysalis species, Dermacentor species, Ixodes species, Otobius species, Ornithodorus spcs, etc.<br>
External parasites bring about itching and skin irritations causing animals to scratch, rub, and bite infested areas. Severe case with mange infestation results in thickened skin, hair loss, and lesions. Losses occur from these parasites due to irritation, blood loss, depressed appetite, and decreased milk production. Ectoparasites act as vectors for various haemo-protozoan and tick-borne infections like babesiosis, trypanosomiasis, theileriosis, tick-fever etc. Infested cows produce less milk, affecting herd's profits. Blood loss caused by sucking parasites can become so severe it causes anemia and may lead to abortion in young heifers. Extreme infestations can result in death.<br>
Currently available products for the control of external parasites include synthetic pyrethroids (Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer), Cypermethrin, Fenvalerate etc.) Amitraz and, organophosphorus preparations such as Malathion, DDT etc.<br>
Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer), fourth generation synthetic dibromo-pyrethroid, consists of one exclusive therapeutic pure isomer of a composite ester. Of the eight possible stereoisomers, it contains only the (d-cis isomer) or [1R, c/'s; alpha S] which acts as an axonic poison by acting on axons in peripheral and central nervous system by interacting with sodium channels in mammals and/or insects giving a knockdown effect. They stimulate nerve cells to produce repetitive discharge and eventually cause paralysis, convulsions and death. Prior art formulations of deltamethrin are prepared in non-aqueous solvents such as CIX, which have high to moderate acute oral toxicity (LD50 Value 
Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer) as a sole active ingredient of the composition is marketed by few companies like Intervet India Private Limited (Butox), Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (Deltarin) and Jubilant Organosys Limited (Anytix). These products are used to control only the infection caused by parasites in animals.<br>
Existing prior art preparations do not provide complete and long-lasting freedom from ectoparasites. Drug-resistance has developed with Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer) and other existing products due to prolonged use. Reinfestation or reoccurrence takes place within 4-8 days after applying these products on skin of the animals.<br>
Other disadvantages of using existing Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer) formulation are low tick-kill rate (upto 70-80%), lack of fly-repellant action, higher volatility, low biodegradability and adverse side-effects. Side effects associated with its use are tremors, convulsions, salivation and frothy discharge from mouth etc. Poor biodegradability of existing products is a key issue with environmentalists.<br>
Melaleuca alternifolia, or Australian tea tree oil as it is more commonly known, is 100% natural oil which is an antiseptic, acaricide, and a fungicide. It is made entirely from a renewable natural resource and is completely eco friendly. Its major active component is terpinen-4-ol. Australian Tea Tree Oil<br>
(Melaleuca Oil) has shown its antimicrobial activity against a variety of micro organisms.<br>
The composition of the present invention contains active ingredients Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer) and Oil of Melaleuca in combination with a solvent, stabilizer and emulsifiers having cent percent tick-kill rate (acaricidal activity) and fly repellant activity. The said composition also provides an enhanced protection time by two folds for reinfestation by parasites.<br>
This dual effect is not achieved from any of the existing prior art composition containing Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer). In addition, composition of the present invention overcomes the limitations associated with the compositions of the prior art containing ectoparasiticidal agents, providing an eco friendly, efficient and safe product. The dual effect and an enhanced protection time for reinfestation by parasites has never been achieved by any of the prior art compositions.<br>
An optimum level of acaricidal activity coupled with fly repellant activity of a stable and safe composition of the present invention is achieved by human intervention in the present work and is not to be considered as a mere coincidence.<br>

An object of the present invention is to develop an effective, safe and stable synergistic composition to act against ecto-parasites in animals<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a composition having cent percent tick-kill rate and fly repellant activity.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a composition which can have long duration of action to delay the re-infestation period by ecto-parasites.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition containing Deltamethrin(d-cis isomer) in combination with a product of herbal origin, solvent, stabilizer and emulsifiers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to use a herbal oil which also provides an effect of an adjuvant.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide composition having minimum toxicity<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a biodegradable and eco friendly composition.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a composition having low volatility.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a hydro dispersible veterinary composition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a stable, safe and an efficient emulsifiable synergistic composition containing Deltamethrin (d-cis isomer), Oil of Melaleuca in combination with a solvent, stabilizer and emulsifiers having cent percent tick-kill rate (acaricidal activity) and fly repellant activity. The said composition also provides an enhanced protection time for re-infestation by parasites. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the composition.<br>
