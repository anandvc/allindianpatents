LUBRICANT FOR POWDER METALLURGICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to a powder metallur¬gical composition. Specifically, the invention relates to a powder metal composition comprising a new particulate composite lubricant. The invention further relates to the new particulate composite lubricant as well as a method of preparing this lubricant.<br>
In the Powder Metallurgy industry (PM industry) pow¬dered metals, most often iron-based, are used for produc¬tion of components. The production process involves com¬paction of a powder metal blend in a die to form a green compact, ejecting the compact from the die and sintering the green compact at temperatures and under such condi¬tions that a sintered compact having sufficient strength is produced. By using the PM production route costly ma¬chining and material losses can be avoided compared to conventional machining of components from solid metals as net shape or nearly net shape components can be produced. The PM production route is most suitable for the produc¬tion of small and fairly intricate parts such as gears.<br>
In order to facilitate the production of PM parts lubricants may be added to the iron-based powder before compaction. By using lubricants the internal frictions between the individual metal particles during the compac¬tion step are reduced. Another reason for adding lubri¬cant is that the ejection force and the total energy needed in order to eject the green part from the die af¬ter compaction are reduced. Insufficient lubrication will result in wear and scuffing at the die during the ejec¬tion of the green compact.<br>
The problem with insufficient lubrication can be solved mainly in two ways, either by increasing the amount of lubricant or by selecting more efficient lubri¬cants. By increasing the amount of lubricant, an under-sired side effect is however encountered in that the gain<br>
 <br>
in density through better lubrication is reversed by the increased amount of the lubricants.<br>
A better choice would then be to select more efficient lubricants. This is however a problem as compounds having good lubricity in PM context tends to agglomerate during storage or contributes to agglomerate formation in the powder metallurgical composition, a consequence of which is that the subsequently compacted and sintered component may include comparatively large pores which have a detrimental effect of the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the component. Another problem is that lubricants having good lubrication properties often have negative effects on the so-called powder properties, such as flow rate and apparent density (AD). The flow rate is important because of its impact on the die filling which in turn is important for the production rate of the PM parts. A high AD is important in order to enable shorter filling depths and even AD is important in order to avoid variations in dimensions and weight of the finished components. It is thus desirable to obtain a new lubricant for powder metal compositions that overcomes or reduces the above mentioned problems.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a lubricant having good lubrication properties but no or reduced tendency to agglomerate.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a lubricant having good lubrication properties and yet imparting flow or improved flow properties when it is used in an iron or iron-based powder composition.<br>
Another object is to provide a new iron or iron-based powder composition which includes the new lubricant and which has good flow properties and a high and even apparent density.<br>
Still another object is to provide a process for producing a lubricant.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to the invention it has now unexpectedly been found that the above objects can be met by an iron-based powder metallurgical composition comprising an iron or iron-based powder and a new particulate composite lubricant, said composite lubricant comprising particles having a core comprising a solid organic lubricant having fine carbon particles adhered thereon.<br>
The invention also concerns the particulate composite lubricant per se as well as the preparation thereof.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The type of solid organic lubricant- of the composite lubricant according to the invention is not critical, but due to the disadvantages with metal-organic lubricants, the organic lubricant should preferably not include metal constituents. Thus the organic lubricant may be selected from a wide variety of organic substances having good lu¬bricating properties. Examples of such substances are fatty acids, waxes, polymers, or derivates and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred solid organic lubricants are fatty acids selected from the group consisting of palmitic acid stearic acid, behenic acid and; fatty acid monoamides se¬lected from the group consisting of palmitamide, steara-mide, behenamide, oleamide and erucamide, fatty acid bis-amldes, such as ethylene bisstearamide (EBS), ethylene bisoleamide (EBO), polyethylene, polyethylene wax; secondary fatty acid amides selected from the group con¬sisting of erucyl stearamide, oleyl palmitamide, stearyl erucamide, stearyl oleamide, stearyl stearamide, oleyl stearamide.<br>
Especially preferred solid organic lubricants are stearamide, erucamide, stearyl oleamide, erucyl stearamide, stearyl erucamide, EBO, EBS, and EBS in<br>
 <br>
combination with oleamide, erucamide, stearyl override , stearyl erucamide or erucyl stearamide. Presently-available results indicate that powder metal compositions comprising these composite lubricants according to the invention are distinguished by especially high apparent densities and/or flow rates. Additionally these lubricants are known for their excellent lubricating properties.<br>
The average particle size of the organic core parti¬cles may be 0.5-100  μ m, preferably 1-50  μ m and most pref¬erably 5-40 μ m. Furthermore it is preferred that the par¬ticle size of the core is at least five times the particle size of the carbon particles and it is preferred that the fine carbon particles form a coating on the core surface.<br>
In this context the term "fine carbon particles" is intended to mean crystalline, semi-crystalline or amorphous carbon particles. The fine carbon particles may originate from natural or synthetic graphite, carbon black, activated carbon, coal and anthracite etc and may also be a mixture of two or more of these. The fine carbon particles adhered onto the surface of the solid organic lubricant core may preferably be selected from the group consisting of carbon black and natural or synthetic graphite, having an average particle size of less than 10 μ m and larger than 5 nm.<br>
The primary particle size of the carbon black may be less than 200 nm, preferably less than 100 nm, and most preferably less than 50 nm and larger than 5 nm. The spe¬cific surface area may be between 20 and 1000 m^/g as measured by the BET-method. Carbon black may be obtained from a supplier such as Degauss AG, Germany. The content of carbon black in the composite lubricant may be 0.1-25 % by weight, preferably 0.2-6 % by weight and most pre¬ferably 0.5-4 % by weight.<br>
The average particle size of the graphite may be less than 10 μ m and larger than 500 nm. The content of<br>
 <br>
graphite in the composite lubricant may be 0.1-25 % by weight, preferably 0.5-10 % by weight and most preferably 1-7 % by weight. Graphite may be obtained from a supplier such as Graphit Kropfmiihl AG, Germany or a synthetic graphite with an ultra-high surface area from Asbury Carbons, USA.<br>
The content of the composite lubricant in the powder metal composition may be 0.05-2 % by weight.<br>
The particulate composite lubricant according to the invention may be prepared by ordinary particle coating technique involving mixing an organic particulate lubri¬cating material and fine carbon particles. The method may further comprise a heating step. The temperature for the heat-treatment may be below the melting point of the solid particulate organic lubricant.<br>
The particulate solid organic lubricant may be thor¬oughly mixed with the fine carbon particles in a mixer. The mixer may be a high-speed mixer. The mixture may be heated during mixing at a temperature and during a time period sufficient to let the fine carbon particles adhere to the surface of the particulate organic lubricating ma¬terial during a subsequently followed optional cooling step.<br>
The iron-based powder may be a pre-alloyed iron-based powder or an iron-based powder having the alloying elements diffusion-bonded to the iron-particles. The iron-based powder may also be a mixture of essentially pure iron powder or pre-alloyed iron-based powder and al¬loying elements selected from the group consisting of Ni, Cu, Cr, Mo, Mn, P, Si, V, Nb, Ti, W and graphite. Carbon in the form of graphite is an alloying element used to a large extent in order to give sufficient mechanical prop¬erties to the finished sintered components. By adding carbon as an individual constituent to the iron-based powder composition the dissolved carbon content of the iron-based powder may be kept low enhancing improved com¬pressibility. The iron-based powder may be an atomized<br>
 <br>
powder, such as a water atomized powder, or a sponge iron powder. The particle size of the iron-based powder is se¬lected depending on the final use of the material. The particles of the iron or iron-based powder may have a weight average particle size of up to about 500 μ m,   more preferably the particles may have a weight average particle size in the range of 25-150 μ m, and most pref¬erably 40-100 μ m.<br>
The powder metal composition may further comprise one or more additives selected from the group consisting of binders, processing aids, hard phases, machinability enhancing agents if there is a need of machining of the sintered component, and solid lubricants conventionally used in PM-industry such as EBS, zinc-stearate and Kenolube available from Hogan AB. The concentration of the powdered composite lubricant according to the inven¬tion plus optional solid lubricants may be in the range of 0.05 to 2 % of a powder metal composition.<br>
The new iron or iron-based powder composition may be compacted and optionally sintered by conventional PM techniques.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the in¬vention but the scope of the invention should not be lim¬ited thereto.<br>
Examples Materials<br>
The following materials were used.<br>
(1)	As iron-based water atomized powder (ASCI00.29, available from Hogan’s AB, Sweden) was used.<br>
(2)	As lubricating core materials the following substances were used; ethylene bis-stearamide (EBS) available as Licowax™ from Clarions (Germany), stearamide, erucamide, oleyl palmitamide, stearyl oleylamide, erucyl stearamide, stearyl erucamide.<br>
 <br>
ethylene bis-oleamide (EBO) and polyethylene waxes. The average particle sizes of the lubricants can be seen in Table 2.<br>
(3)	Graphite UF-4 (from Graphit Kropfmiihl AG, Germany) was used as added graphite in the iron-based powder composition.<br>
(4)	Coating particles were Graphite UF-1 (UFl) (from Graphit Kropfmiihl AG, Germany) and Graphite 4827 (4827) {from Asbury Carbons, USA) having an average particle size of 2 jxm  and 1.7 /xm respectively, and Carbon black (CB) (from Degussa AG, Germany) having a primary particle size of 3 0 nm.<br>
The iron-based powder compositions consisted of ASC100.29 mixed with 0.5 % by weight of graphite and 0.8 % by weight of composite lubricant.<br>
Different composite lubricants were prepared by mix¬ing core material according to Table 1 and 2 with fine carbon particles at different concentrations in a high¬speed mixer from Hosokawa. Carbon black was added at the concentrations of 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 4 % by weight, respectively. Graphite was added at the concentrations of 1.5, 3, 5 and 6% by weight, respectively to the composite lubricants. The process parameters for the mixing process, such as temperature of the powder in the mixer and the mixing times for each composite can be seen in Table 2. The rotor speed in the mixer was 1000 rpm and the amount of lubricant core material was 500 g.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
Different iron-based powder compositions (mix no 1-63) of 25 kg each were prepared by mixing the obtained composite liibricant or a conventional particulate lubri¬cant (used as reference) with graphite and ASC100.29 in a 50 kg Nauta mixer The solid organic lubricant particles in mixes no 36-38 and 50-61 were melted, subsequently solidified and micronised before used as a core material for preparing the composite liobricants or before added to the reference mixes. Apparent density (AD) and Hall flow (flow), were measured, according to ISO 4490 and IS03923-1, respectively, on the obtained iron-based powder compositions 24 hours after the mixing. Table 3 shows the results of the measurements.<br>
As can be seen from table 3, the flow rate of the iron-based powder compositions is improved and higher ap¬parent densities may be obtained when using the different composite lubricants according to the invention as lubri¬cants compared with the use of a conventional lubricant. In fact, when a PM composition containing a conventional lubricant has no flow the PM composition containing the inventive composite lubricant provides flow. Especially high apparent densities and/or flow rates were obtained for powder metal compositions containing composite lubri¬cants according to the invention containing stearamide, erucamide, erucyl stearamide, stearyl erucamide, EBO, EBS and EBS in combination with oleamide or stearyl erucamide.<br>
In order to measure the tendency of the composite Invariants and the conventional lubricants to form ag¬glomerates the lubricants were sieved on a standard 315<br>
 <br>
 μ m  sieve after storage of at least one week. The amount of the retained material was measured.<br>
Table 4 shows that the tendency of forming agglomer¬ates decreases when the organic lubricating core material is covered by fine carbon particles resulting in a com¬posite lubricant according to the invention.<br>
The same type of measurements as shown in table 4 was repeated with certain iron-based powder compositions in order to evaluate the tendency of forming agglomerates in an iron-based powder composition containing conven¬tional Ixobricants and composite lubricants according to the invention, respectively.<br>
Table 5 shows that the tendency of forming agglomerates is less pronounced in iron-based powder compositions containing the composite lubricant according to the invention compared with compositions comprising a conventional lubricant.<br>
