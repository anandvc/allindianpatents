The present invention relates to 3-(indolyl)-4-arylmaIeimide derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as angiogenesis inhibitors.<br>
Angiogenesis is a morphogenetic process which relates to the formation of new blood vessels from the endothelial cells of already existing capillary vessels. A number of pathological events in humans have been found to be associated with angiogenesis. Angiogenetic processes are pathologically responsible inter alia in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ischemia and malignant diseases. The occurrence of angiogenesis in connection with cancer and neoplasms, in particular in connection with tumor invasion and metastases formation, is remarkable. Therefore, angiogenesis inhibitors are contemplated as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of solid tumors for which no effective therapies are known so far, such as bronchial carcinoma, mamma carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, glioblastoma, Karposi sarcoma, melanoma, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.<br>
Many key functions in the angiogenetic process are controlled by protein kinases which therefore can be considered as signal integrators. Essential angiogenesis factors, such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) mediate their effects by means of phosphorylations via thyrosine kinases. The development of selective kinase inhibitors is therefore of particular relevance.<br><br><br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to known methods, for example according to the methods, which are disclosed in WO 02/38561, EP 328 026 and WO 03/095452. For the purposes of the present invention a modified procedure reported in Tetrahedron Letters (1999) 40:1109-1112 has been proven to be particularly efficient. This procedure can be illustrated by the following reaction sequence:<br><br>
An indole glyoxyl ester is reacted with a phenyl acetamide derivative in a one-pot reaction in an inert solvent in the presence of a strong base. Preferably an ether is used as an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofurane or dioxane. As a base potassium t-butoxide can for example be used. The water formed during the reaction is removed, for example by using a molecular sieve. The phenyl acetamides used as starting material are readily available from the corresponding acetic acids which are converted to the acid chloride and hydrolyzed with ammonia. The indole glyoxyl esters (R = methyl, ethyl) were synthesized by Friedel-Crafts-type acylation of the corresponding indole derivative with methyl or ethyl oxalyl chloride, cf. Tetrahedron 1999, 55 (43), 12577-12594. The corresponding azaindole glyoxyl esters can be prepared according to the method reported in J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 6226-6227 or by Friedel-Crafts acylation in the presence of dialkyl aluminium chloride, cf. Organic Letters (2000) vol. 2, no. 10, 1485-1487. The 4- and 6-azaindole starting compounds can be prepared by reacting 2-chloro-3-nitropyridine or 3-nitro-4-chloropyridine with vinyl magnesium bromide to give the 7-chloro-substituted 4- or 6-azaindole. The chloro substituent is then removed by catalytic hydrogenation. Said reactions are carried out as described in J. Org. Chem. 67, 2345-2347 (2002) and J. HeterocycL Chem. 29, 359-363(1992).<br>
The 5- and 7-azaindole starting compounds can be prepared by reacting 2- or 4-aminopyridine with di-tert-butyldicarbonate to 2- or 4- t-butoxycarbonylaminopyridine which is then reacted with methyl iodide and dimethylformamide in the presence of t-butyl lithium. The obtained product is then treated with a strong acid to give 5- or 7-<br><br>
azaindole. Said reactions are described in Synthesis 7, 877-882 (1996).<br>

For use the compounds of the present invention can be incorporated into standard pharmaceutical dosage forms. Thus, the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a phamaceutically acceptable carrier and an amount therapeutically effective for control of angiogenesis and/or vascular dysfunction of a compound of formula (I) as above-defined. For example, they are useful when administered in systemic or local, oral or parenteral applications and for this purpose are combined with the usual pharmaceutical excipients, diluents and<br><br>
adjuvants, e.g., organic and inorganic inert carrier materials such as water, gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, gums, polyalkyleneglycols, etc. These pharmaceutical preparations can be employed in a solid form, e.g., as tablets, capsules, and especially in combination with or for admixture with a palatable food item suitable for mammals; or they can be administered in liquid form, e.g., as solutions and elixirs. Pharmaceutical excipients and adjuvants which can be added to include preservatives, antioxidants, antimicrobial agents and other stabilizers; wetting, emulsifying, and suspending agents, and anticaking compounds; fragrance and coloring additives; compositions for improving compressibility, or to create a delayed-, sustained-, or controlled-release of the active ingredient; and various salts to change the osmotic pressure of the pharmaceutical preparation or to act as buffers.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) as defined may be administered systemicaily to said mammal, wherein said systemic administration comprises: (1) injection or infusion into suitable body tissues or cavities of a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound in suitable liquid form such as aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions for intraarterial, intra- or transdermal (including subcutaneous) and most commonly intramuscular or intravenous delivery thereof; or for serving as a depot for delivery thereof; (2) instillation into suitable body tissues or cavities of a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound in suitable solid form, e.g., comprising a matrix of bio-compatible and bio-erodible materials in which particles of a compound of Formula (I) are dispersed for serving as a solid implant composition for delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release delivery thereof; or (3) ingestion or administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound in suitable solid or liquid form for transdermal delivery thereof, for instance a transdermal patch or a subepidermal (subcuticular) implant, for peroral delivery thereof.<br>
The dosage forms described herein may be formulated so as to provide controlled-, sustained-, and/or delayed release of the active ingredient from said dosage form.<br>
Preferred peroral dosage forms for systemic administration are solids, e.g., palatable oral compositions such as fast dissolving palatable wafers, tablets, capsules, caplets,<br><br>
etc., and liquids, e.g., solutions, suspensions, emulsions, etc. Pharmaceutical compositions of special types suitable for oral administration to mammals may be used, and include, but are not limited to such items as an oral paste to be delivered to the back of the tongue of the mammal being treated, a granular form to be delivered through incorporation in the mammal's food, and a chewable form wherein the active ingredient is consumed along with the palatable chew, or a chewable form which may deliver the active ingredient by leaching from the body of the chew which is not consumed, during mastication by the mammal being treated. Tablets and capsules are preferred dosage forms.<br>
Said therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) as defined may also be administered locally to said mammal, wherein said local administration comprises: (1) injection or infusion into a local site affected with abnormal angiogenesis and/or vascular dysfunction of a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound of formula (I) in suitable liquid form for delivery thereof, including components which provide delayed-release, controlled-release, and/or sustained-release of said compound into said local site; or for serving as a depot for delivery thereof wherein said composition provides storage of said compound and thereafter delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release thereof; or (2) instillation of a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound in suitable solid form for serving as a solid implant for delivery thereof, said composition optionally providing delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release of said compound to said local site.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula (I), is administered to a mammal to be treated in an amount expressed as milligrams per kilogram of body weight of said mammal, per day: "mg/kg/day". The dose, ;.e., the therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) will usually range from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 20.0 mg/kg/day, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 12.0 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 10.0 mg/kg/day, and most preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 8.0 mg/kg/day. It is necessary for the skilled artisan, not only to determine the preferred route of administration and the corresponding dosage form and amount, but said artisan must also determine the dosing regimen, i.e., the frequency of dosing. In general terms it is most likely that the choice will be between once-a-day (s.i.d.) dosing and twice-a-<br><br>
day (bid.) dosing, and that the former will provide more rapid and profound therapy, while the latter will provide less profound but more sustained therapy.<br>
The method of the present invention can be further defined to comprise two basic steps: (I) establishing the status of a candidate mammal as presently or prospectively being in a condition of pathological angiogenesis and/or vascular dysfunction, thereby confirming that said mammal is in need of such treatment; and thereupon (II) treating or preventing said condition by administering to said mammal an amount therapeutically effective for treating or preventing said disorder of a compound of Formula (I).<br>
The antiangiogenic activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined by the following assays:<br>
Chick Embryo assay as in vivo angiogenesis model.<br>
The assay was basically performed as described in Anticancer Research 24: 1545-1552 (2004). Test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and used as stock solution. For the preparation of agarose pellets, the stock solution was mixed with 2 % agarose solution at 80 °C and 10 μLpellets were produced (final content 5-100 pg).<br>
Fertilised chicken eggs (White leghorn) were incubated at 37.5°C and 62 % relative humidity in an automatically turning egg incubator (Ehret). After 70 hours of incubation and removal of 8 μLalbumin, a window was opened in the shell to uncover the developing germination layer. The window was sealed with transparent tape, the eggs returned to the incubator and stored at 90 % relative humidity without turning. At 75-h incubation time the angiogenic experiment was initiated (start-time: 0 h) and 15 agarose pellets were placed on the area vasculosa preparations. After 24 h, images of the control and sample-treated areas were taken. Images were digitised via Leica QWinTM-Software and the angiogenic response was measured using the automatic image analysis system programmed in a routine. The digitised images were analysed for total, major (capillaries with a diameter of more than 50 pm) and minor blood vessel areas using the customized image analysis software Leica QWinTM (Leica Microsystems Bensheim, Germany). Calculated data were sent<br><br>
automatically via Dynamic Data Exchange to an Excel table and processed statistically. An antiangiogenic response due to agent-treated samples was considered positive if the mean of minor blood vessel area showed &gt; 20 % inhibition compared to control samples. Differences between treated and control samples were evaluated using Student's t-test.<br>
Tubulin Polymerisation Assay<br>
The antimitotic activity of the compounds was determined using a slightly modified version of the turbidimetric tubulin assembly in vitro assay described by Gaskih et al., J. MoL Biol 1974, 89(4), 737-755).<br>
In this assay, the assembly of microtubule protein isolated from porcine brain is monitored in vitro in presence of effectors. The principle is based on the fact that microtubules increase the turbidity of the test solution, compared to unpolymerized tubulin dimers. The degree of assembly is measured by detecting the change in absorbance of the test solution compared to a control.<br>
The measurements were performed at 360 nm with a Uvikon 930 UV spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) equipped with a multicell holder connected to a thermostat The influence of the test substances on tubulin assembly (protein concentration 1 mg/ml) was determined by comparing the change of absorption to a control without effectors. Assembly was performed for 20 min in a PIPES (Piperazine-1,4-bis-(2-ethanesuIfonic acid)) buffer containing 10 mM GTP at pH 6.8 and a temperature of 37°C. To exclude protein denaturation and to check reversibility of assembly, the measurement was continued for additional 20 min during decreasing the temperature to 4°C that should shift turbidity to the pre-assembly level.<br>
Selectivity profiling of compounds in two concentrations using protein kinases<br>
Recombinant protein kinases: The inhibitory profile of compounds was determined using the following 12 protein kinases: CDKI/CyclinB, CDK2/CycIinE, CDK4/CyclinD1, CDK6/CycIinD1, PKC-alpha, PKC-gamma, PKC.epsilon, PKC-iota, EGF-R, ERBB2, TIE2, VEGF-R2. All protein kinases were expressed in Sf9 insect cells as recombinant GST-fusion<br><br>
proteins or His-tagged proteins by means of the baculovirus expression system.<br>
Except for PKC-alpha (mouse), PKC-epsilon (mouse) and PKC-gamma (rat), human<br>
cDNAs were used for the expression of the protein kinases. Kinases were purified by<br>
affinity chromatography using either GSH-agarose (Sigma) or Ni-NTH-agarose<br>
(Qiagen). The purity and identity of each kinase was checked by SDS-PAGE/silver<br>
staining and by western blot analysis with specific antibodies.<br>
Protein kinase Assay: A proprietary protein kinase assay (33PanQinase® Activity<br>
Assay) was used for measuring the kinase activity of the 12 protein kinases. All<br>
kinase assays were performed in 96-well FlashPlates™ from Perkin Elmer/NEN<br>
(Boston, MA, USA) in a 50 μLreaction volume.<br>
The assay for all enzymes (except for the PKC assay, see below) contained 60 mM<br>
HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCI2l 3mM MnCI2l 3 pM Na-orthovanadate, 1.2 mM<br>
DTT, 50 pg/μLPEG2oooo, 1 pM [y-33P]-ATP (approx. 5x10s cpm per well),<br>
recombinant protein kinase (50-400 ng) and depending from the kinase, the following<br>
substrate proteins: Rb-CTF (CDK1, CDK4, CDK6), poly(Glu,Tyr)4:1 (EGF-R, ERBB2,<br>
TIE2, VEGF-R2), Histone H1 (CDK2).<br>
The PKC assay contained 60 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1.25 mM<br>
EGTA, 5 mM MgCI2, 1.32 mM CaCI2, 5 pg/μLPhosphatidylserine, 1 pg/μL1,2 Dioleyl-<br>
glycerol, 1.2 mM DTT, 50 pg/μLPEG20ooo, 1 pM [y-33P]-ATP(approx. 5xl05cpm per<br>
well), recombinant protein kinase (20-100 ng) und Histone H1 as substrate.<br>
The compounds were tested at a concentration of 10 pM and 100 pM in singlicate.<br>
The final DMSO concentration in the assay was 1%.<br>
The reaction cocktails were incubated at 30°C for 80 min. The reaction was stopped<br>
with 50 pi of 2 % (v/vj H3P04, plates were aspirated and washed two times with 200<br>
pi of 0.9 % (w/v) NaCI. Incorporation of 33Pj was determined with a microplate<br>
scintillation counter (Microbeta Trilux, Wallac). All assays were performed with a<br>
BeckmanCoulter/Sagian robotic system.<br>
For each compound inhibition was calculated as percentage relative to control values<br>
without test compound.<br>
Examples<br>
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 1310 infrared spectrophotometer. 1H (300 MHz, digital resolution 0.3768 Hz) and 13C (75 MHz, digital resolution 1.1299 Hz) NMR were recorded on a Bruker AC 300: the data are reported as<br><br>
follows: chemical shift in ppm from Me4Si as external standard, multiplicity and coupling constant (Hz). El-Mass spectra were recorded on a Varian MAT 311A (70 eV) and FD-Mass spectra on a MAT-95 (Finnigan). For clarity only the highest measured signal is given for FD-mass spectra. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyzer Carlo Erba Strumentazione Mod. 1106. Combustion. analyses agreed with the calculated data within ±0.4 unless otherwise stated. Melting points/decomposition temperatures were determined on a BQchi apparatus according to Dr. Tottoli and are uncorrected. Where appropriate, column chromatography was performed for crude precursors with Merck silica gel 60 (0.063-0.200 mm) or Acros organics silica gel (0.060-0.200 mm; pore diameter ca. 60 nm). Column chromatography for test compounds was performed using a MPLC-System B-680 (BQchi) with Merck silica gel 60 (0.015-0.040 mm). The progress of the reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) performed with Merck silica gel 60 F-245 plates. Where necessary reactions were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere using 4 A molecular sieves. All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received (THF was used after distillation over K/benzophenone),<br>
General procedure for the preparation of 3-phenyl-4-indoIyl-maleimides<br>
A modified procedure of Faul et alM Tetrahedron Letters 1999, 40, 1109-1112 and J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 6053-6058 was used. A stirred solution of the corresponding phenylacetamide (1 equiv.) and indolylmethyl- or indolylethylglyoxylate (2-4 equiv.) in dry THF containing 15 g molecular sieve (4 A) was cooled to 0°C under nitrogen. At this temperature 1.0 M KOBu* in lBuOH (3.0 equiv.) was added via septum and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring over night, the reaction was again cooled to 0°C and quenched with saturated NH^CI-solution.
