				<td>The invention relates to an electrical spring-loaded clamped connection.<br>
An important generic feature of such spring-loaded clamped connections is a<br>
rectangular material rail with a curved bottom through the busbar piece made of a flat<br>
material. The above mentioned rail serves as an opening for the insertion of a conductor<br>
and has a hollow collar extending in the direction of the conductor insertion, so that a<br>
contact point for an electrical conductor is formed between the inner wall surface of the<br>
collar and an end of a leaf spring extending into the material rail (see DE 28 25 291 C2).<br>
Such busbar pieces can be provided with one, but also with many material rails, which<br>
are preferably arranged in a line to obtain a possibly narrow structural form of the busbar<br>
piece (e.g. in the shape of a punched out material strip), as it is required, for example for<br>
the series terminal arrangements. In the region of the material rails, such particularly<br>
narrow busbar pieces have merely narrow edge-shoulders extending in the busbar<br>
direction, the current conduction cross-sections of which as a rule are not sufficient. This<br>
disadvantage is compensated by the collar of the material rails, the collar cross-sections<br>
of which are simultaneously also current conducting cross-sections, so that the cross-<br>
sections of the edge shoulders together with the collar cross-sections form a sufficiently<br>
large current conducting cross-section in the direction of the busbar piece.<br>
However, the known spring-loaded clamped connections of this type have the<br>
disadvantage that the current transition values between the inner wall surface of the collar<br>
and the clamped electrical conductor are very much insufficient. Practical tests to solve<br>
this problem by increasing the clamping forces of the leaf spring were unsatisfactory,<br>
because higher clamping forces have an adverse effect on the inserting forces, which are<br>
to be applied manually for the clamping of the electrical conductor.<br>
Therefore the task of the invention is to retain the advantages of the generic feature of<br>
a spring-loaded clamped connection having in its busbar, a material rail with a collar, but<br>
at the same time to improve the current transition values in the contact point without<br>
increasing the conductor inserting forces or deteriorating the conductor inserting action in<br>
another way.<br>
As per the invention, this task is solved such that a cross-edge projecting towards the<br>
electrical conductor and extending across the direction of conductor insertion is provided<br>
at the collar inner wall surface, which with the clamping side end of a leaf spring forms the<br>
contact point, and that the clamping side of the leaf spring is dimensioned and shaped in<br>
such a way that the end-side clamping edge of the clamping side end in the position of the<br>
clamping of the electrical conductor more or less faces the cross-edge present at the inner<br>
wall surface of the collar.<br>
The cross-edge can be provided at different positions of the arrangement along the<br>
stretch of the collar extending in the direction of conductor insertion, however a very<br>
advantageous and production-related extremely cost-effective embodiment provides for,<br>
that the cross-edge is formed by the bottom edge - in direction of conductor insertion - of<br>
the collar of the material rail. For this purpose, the aforesaid bottom edge is advanced<br>
towards the electrical conductor to be clamped. This can be effected either with an<br>
inclined arrangement of the busbar piece on the whole or for example, by upsetting,<br>
pressing or forging the assigned collar wall region.<br>
The other collar wall regions which contribute nothing to the formation of the contact<br>
point, are not affected by this measure, however can also be deformed, if this could<br>
facilitate the production-related procedures in the manufacture and shaping of the material<br>
rail and collar.<br>
As per the invention, the solution is new for spring-loaded clamped connections, which<br>
in their busbar piece have a material rail with a collar, and considerably improves the<br>
current conduction and contact security in the contact point. This results firstly from the<br>
advantage of the formation of a contact point, which appears as intersecting point<br>
between the electrical conductor and the projecting cross-edge at the collar inner wall<br>
surface and which geometrically minimises the contact bearing surface between the<br>
electrical conductor and the collar of the material rail to a smaller defined contact bearing<br>
surface; secondly in combination with a maximum possible application of contact forces,<br>
which results from the fact that the clamping side of the clamping spring is dimensioned<br>
and shaped in such a way that the end-side clamping edge of the clamping side end in the<br>
position of the clamping of the electrical conductor has an almost direct effect on the<br>
geometrically minimised bearing surface of the contact, as the clamping edge of the<br>
clamping side end more or less faces the cross-edge formed at the collar inner wall<br>
surface. A high specific contact pressure in the bearing surface of the contact, which<br>
improves the current conductions and in addition, a guaranteed gastight contact results<br>
from this.<br>
The positioning of the clamping side end of the leaf spring, more or less facing the<br>
cross-edge at the collar inner wall surface, has the additional advantage, that none of the<br>
overturning moment resulting from the clamping force of the leaf spring will act on the<br>
clamped electrical conductor.<br>
If preferably the "projecting cross-edge" at the collar inner wall surface is formed by the<br>
"advanced bottom edge" of the collar of the material rail, then the contact point for<br>
electrical conductor shifts to the maximum extent into the depth of the material rail, from<br>
which additional significant advantages result.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the region of the collar inner wall surface which in the<br>
direction of the conductor insertion is extended in front of the contact point, can be<br>
designed as relatively large inclined planes and with smooth transitions formed without<br>
jerk or jolt (preferably flat shaped), which during the insertion action leads the forward end<br>
of the electrical conductor smoothly and softly (i.e. without "hard" jerky transitions), so that<br>
the conductor inserting forces are reduced and possibly existing surface coatings, such as<br>
for example, a tin coating on the collar inner wall surface and in the region of the contact<br>
point, are protected against undesired abrasion.<br>
The task, to provide a conductor trap for spring-loaded clamping connections of this<br>
type, so that even multiwire electrical conductors can be inserted without any problem,<br>
without their fanning out and/or deflecting in some other way. This task is solved thereby,<br>
that for uncoated and closed contact point, an end-side section of the clamping side of the<br>
leaf spring is located within the contour of the material rail (i.e. is positioned in the depth of<br>
the material rail), in fact with a flat extension of the section which is equal to or greater<br>
than the nominal cross-section of the conductor to be clamped, in such a way that the<br>
ring-shaped, closed collar inner wall surfaces with the end-side section of the clamping<br>
side form an all-sided metal enclosed conductor trap for the forward end of the electrical<br>
conductor which is to be inserted.<br>
For the geometrical shape of the aforementioned conductor trap, it is advantageous to<br>
provide the end-side section of the clamping side of the leaf spring to be, as far as<br>
possible, flat within the collar contour, so that a possibly blunt seating of the front face of<br>
the clamping side end against the surface of the electrical conductor results, whereby<br>
when conductor pull-out forces occur, a sharp-edged clamping of the conductor is<br>
prevented and even highly sensitive fine wire conductors can be clamped without any<br>
damages.<br>
The conductor trap as such bundles multiwire conductors and has for all types of<br>
electrical conductors. The advantage that in a plug-in connection, the front end of the<br>
electrical conductor is to be inserted first, without applying any force, into the conductor<br>
trap and as a result of this is fixed against deflecting movements, before the opening of<br>
the contact point is initiated by means of a manually applied axial force on the conductor.<br>
The task, of being able to open the contact point in spring-loaded clamped connections<br>
of this type even when the contact point is located in the depth of the material rail, is to be<br>
solved. In case of spring-loaded clamped connections of the generic type, it is always a<br>
problem, for opening the contact point, to be able to push back the clamping side of the<br>
leaf spring, by applying a force against its spring resistance, so far that the contact point is<br>
optimally, i.e. fully open. This is applicable especially when because of a compact wiring<br>
system the tool (screwdriver) can be pushed forward only axially for opening the contact<br>
point.<br>
This problem is solved with that a middle section of the clamping side of the leaf spring<br>
outside the contour of the material rail has a protrusion (convexity) in the direction of<br>
spring clamping force of the clamping side, to such an extent that a spinning tool placed<br>
on this protrusion and mainly perpendicular to the surface of the busbar piece pushes<br>
back the clamping side up to a position, in which the contact point is fully open.<br>
Basically it is to be noted that a spring-loaded clamped connection conceived as per the<br>
principle of the invention can be realised in the model with a leaf spring - in mirror image<br>
design - for two material rails arranged adjoining one another in a busbar piece (refer to<br>
the type in DE 28 25 291 C2) as well in a model with a leaf spring, which has a locating or<br>
holding side, which can be fixed to the busbar piece in any way (e.g. by riveting or<br>
pressing), or a type is selected, in which the spring leaf is bent U-shaped and has a<br>
locating side at its end which is opposite to the clamping side, which along with the<br>
clamping side of the leaf spring extends into the same material rail of the busbar piece<br>
and which rests against the collar inner wall surface, which faces the collar inner wall<br>
surface which forms the contact point.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the following an embodiment of the invention is described in detail with help of the<br>
drawings. They show:<br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2a + 2b            a spring-loaded clamped connection as per the<br>
invention<br>
Figure 3,4, 5                               functional sequence of the spring-loaded clamped<br>
connection as per Figure 1, when used as a plug-in<br>
connection<br>
Figure 6                                           the spring-loaded clamped connection as per Figure 1<br>
upon opening the contact point.<br>
According to Figure 1 there is provided a busbar piece 10 with a rectangular material<br>
rail 11, which can be seen in detail in the illustration in Figure 2a (longitudinal section) and<br>
Figure 2b (top view). The piece of the busbar 10 described in Figure 2a and 2b also<br>
shows that any number of such material rails can be positioned adjoining one another in a<br>
row. For the busbar, the shape of a narrow material strip can be selected, which in the<br>
region of the material rails has edge shoulders 12 having a very small width.<br>
The material rail 11 has a ring-shaped closed collar 13 - drawn (by plunging) from the<br>
top surface of the busbar piece - with collar inner walls 14 and 15. The transitions from<br>
the top surface of the busbar piece to the collar inner wall surfaces can be designed as<br>
leading-in rounding or leading-in inclinations 16 and 17.<br>
A mainly U-shaped bent leaf spring is placed in the material rail, which in the given<br>
embodiment rests with its rear bend of the spring on a plastic mandrel 18 of an housing<br>
made of insulating material in which such spring-loaded clamped connections are<br>
mounted, and is thus additionally fixed in its position. The width of the leaf spring<br>
corresponds at least in the region of the locating side 19 extending into the material rail<br>
and of the clamping side 20 dipping into the material rail, to the width of the rectangular<br>
rail. Instead of the additional position-fixing by means of the plastic mandrel 18, for<br>
example, other means such as the locating shoulders of the locating side resting on the<br>
top side of the busbar piece and/or, for example, a press fit of the locating side in the<br>
material rail can be used for the additional position-fixing of the leaf spring. However, such<br>
kind of an additional position-fixing of the leaf spring can be entirely dropped in many<br>
applications, because the pre-tension of the U-shaped leaf spring ensures also a self-<br>
holding of the leaf spring in the material rail.<br>
For uncoated and closed contact point, the end-side clamping edge 21 of the clamping<br>
side 20 rests on the collar inner wall surface 15 and is thus held in the material rail by stop<br>
lug fixing.<br>
As per the principle of the invention, a cross-edge projecting towards the electrical<br>
conductor, i.e. in the direction of the center of the material rail and extending across the<br>
direction of conductor insertion through the material rail is formed on the collar inner wall<br>
surface 15. In the embodiment described, the aforesaid cross-edge is formed by the<br>
bottom edge 22 of the collar 13, which for this purpose is moved forward in the direction of<br>
the center of the material rail.<br>
Further, as per the principle of the invention, the clamping side 20 of the leaf spring is<br>
dimensioned and shaped in such a way, that in the position of the clamping of the<br>
electrical conductor 23 (refer Figure 5) it dips maximum into the depth of the material rail,<br>
whereby in the clamping of the electrical conductor its end-side clamping edge 21 more or<br>
less faces the bottom edge 22 of the collar, so that the electrical conductor is clamped<br>
free of overturning moment in the contact point 21/22.<br>
The embodiment described realises the formation of a so-called conductor trap 24 also<br>
(refer Figure 3). This results from the fact, that for uncoated and closed contact point, the<br>
end-side section 25 of the clamping side 20 is located within the contour of the material<br>
rail, in fact with a flat extension which is equal to or greater than the nominal cross-section<br>
of the conductor 23 which is to be clamped (refer Figure 3). The all-sided metal enclosed<br>
conductor trap 24 allows at first a force-free insertion of the forward end of the electrical<br>
conductor into the trap and prevents thereupon undesired deflecting movements of the<br>
front end of the conductor, when an axial force is applied manually for the insertion of the<br>
conductor in the contact point (so-called plug-in connection).<br>
Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the functional sequence in the insertion of the electrical<br>
conductor in the contact point, whereby the formation of the collar inner wall surface 15 as<br>
smooth and flat-shaped inclined plane reduces the axial force, which is to be applied on<br>
the electrical conductor for the plug-in connection.<br>
The described embodiment of a spring-loaded clamped connection as per the invention<br>
considers also the requirement that it should be possible to use spring-loaded clamped<br>
connections of this type for non-pluggable electrical conductors (e.g. for fine-wire flexible<br>
conductors) also and/or to remove a clamped electrical conductor from the contact point.<br>
For this purpose, the clamping side 20 of the leaf spring has a protrusion 26 (refer Figure<br>
5), which is provided outside the contour of the material rail in such a way that a spinning<br>
tool 27 placed on the protrusion and mainly perpendicular to the top side of the busbar<br>
piece pushes back the clamping side up to a position, in which the contact point is fully<br>
open (see Figure 6).<br>
