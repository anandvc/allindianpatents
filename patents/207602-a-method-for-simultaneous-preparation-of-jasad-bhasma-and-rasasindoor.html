FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for simultaneous preparation of Jasad Bhasma and Rasasindoor.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Bhasmas (a dosage form in ayurveda) having medicinal properties are obtained by the Bhasmikaran procedure i.e. processing of metal like zinc or lead alongwith ingredients like mercury or herbs at high temperatures typically flame temperatures of 500 - 900°C. At such high temperatures the metal changes its original appearance in terms of lustre, particle size and weight. Usually, it also changes from its elemental form to compounds like oxide or sulfide. Depending on the basic raw material used different Bhasmas are formed.<br>
Kupipakwa Rasayana (another dosage form in ayurveda) having medicinal properties is obtained by the Kupipakwa methocL For instance, Sameerpannag rasa is prepared by first making Kajjali or Kajjalika or Kajjal (a soft black compound) by triturating Shuddha Parad (ayurvedically processed mercury), Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulfur),<br><br>
Shuddha Somal (ayurvedically processed arsenic), Shuddha Hartal (ayurvedically processed arsenic trisulfide), Shuddha Manashila (ayurvedically processed arsenic bisulfide) and Kumari rasa (juice of aloe species) followed by heating it at flame temperature of 750 ± 20°C by the Kupipakwa method, which comprises filling the Kajjali in a glass bottle (Kupi) covered with cloth dipped in a slurry of clay like fullers earth and dried (Matkapad) keeping the mouth open. Two-third portion of the bottle is immersed in a sand bath (Valuka-yantra) which is heated using Khadir (Acacia catechu) wood as fuel. Sameerpannag rasa is obtained at the bottom of the bottle. Sameerpannag rasa is used, for instance, in respiratory tract or joint disorders. [Ayurveda Sara Sangraha, Page 225; Publisher - Shree Baidyanath Ayurveda Bhavan Ltd., Nagpur; 5th Edition 1991.]. Poornachandrodaya Makardhwaj is obtained by first making Kajjali by triturating Shuddha Parad (ayurvedically processed mercury), Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulfur) and Shuddha Suvarna (ayurvedically processed gold) followed by heating it at flame temperature 800 ± 20°C by the Kupipakwa method. Poornachandrodaya Makardhwaj is obtained at the neck region of the bottle whereas Suvarna (gold particles) is obtained at the bottom, which can be used for the production of Suvarna Bhasma. Poornachandrodaya Makardhwaj is used as a nerve tonic besides<br><br>
being used in the treatment of chronic disorders or sexual dysfunction. [Bharat Bhaishajya Ratnakar, Part II, Sr. No. 19G8; Publisher - B. Jain Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi; 2nd Edition 1999]. Suvarna Bhasma is used in the treatment of heart or joint diseases or other chronic diseases [Bharat Bhaishajya Ratnakar, Part V, Sr. No. 8357; Publisher - B. Jain Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi; 2nd Edition 1999]. To prepare Suvarnaraj Vangeshwar rasa, Kajjali obtained by trituration of Shuddha Vanga (ayurvedically processed tin), Shuddha Parad (ayurvedically processed mercury), Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulfur), Navasagar (ammonium chloride), Turati (alum) and Suryakshar (potassium nitrate) is heated at flame temperature of 600 ± 10°C by the Kupipakwa method. Suvarnaraj Vangeshwar formed at the bottom of the bottle is used in the treatment  of diseases like diabetes or  genito-urinary tract complaints.<br>
Jasad Bhasma, an ayurvedic medicine containing zinc and sulphur, is reported to possess medicinal properties like Kapha-pitta hara (Kapha-pitta pacifier), tuvara (astringent), shishira (cool), katu (pungent) and bala-veerya-vivek samruddhikar (increasing body strength, vigour and intelligence), vranasansrava rodhanam (preventing oozing from wounds), shrama-avasada shamanam (relieving fatigue) or    rajasrava nishudanam (regulation of<br><br>
menstrual bleeding). It is used in treating nayanamaya (eye diseases), panduroga (anemia), prameha (diabetes), kasa (cough), shwasa (breathlessness), nisha-sweda nibarhanam (night sweats associated with tuberculosis) or kampavata (tremors) [ Rasatarangini by Vaidya Sadanand Sharma; Chapter 19, Shloka No. 120-123; Publisher - Motilal Banarasidas; 11th Edition 1979],<br>
For preparing Jasad Bhasma, Kajjali is first prepared by triturating Shuddha Jasad (ayurvedically processed zinc) with Shuddha Parad (ayurvedically processed mercury), washing the resulting amalgam with lemon juice and then with water till the amalgam is free of lemon juice and then triturating the amalgam with Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulfur) till a homogenous black powder, namely Kajjali is obtained, which is taken in a Sharava Samputa arrangement and heated in a Gajaputa Bhatti i.e. furnace at a flame temperature of 850 ± 20°C using cow dung as fuel. The Sharava Samputa arrangement comprises two Sharavas i.e flat earthen pots placed one above the other mouth to mouth with the joint sealed using a cloth strip dipped in a slurry of mud like fullers earth and dried (Matkapad). The resulting product is triturated in mortar - pestle [Rasatarangini by Vaidya<br><br>
Sadanand Sharma; Chapter 19, Shloka No. 104-107; Publisher - Motilal Banarasidas; 11th Edition 1979].<br>
Rasasindoor, an ayurvedic medicine containing mercury and sulphur, is obtained by first making Kajjali by triturating Shuddha Parad (ayurvedically processed mercury), Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulfur) and Navasagar (ammonium chloride). Kajjali thus obtained is heated at flame temperature of 800 ± 20°C by Kupipakwa method to obtain Rasasindoor at the neck region of the bottle.<br>
Rasasindoor has therapeutic properties like shoolahara (analgesic), vranahara (wound healing agent), roukshyapaha (reducing roughness in body), prasarati dhamaninam (dilating arteries to improve blood circulation) or mild laxative. It is used in the treatment of diseases like prameha (diabetes mellitus), bhagandar (fistula in ano), jwara (pyrexial conditions), shosha (tuberculosis), gulma (flatulence), pleehahara (affections of spleen), panduroga (anemia), sthoulya (obesity), agnimandya (loss of appetite), kushtha (variety of skin diseases) or regulation or smooth excretion of waste products [Rasatarangini by Vaidya Sadanand Sharma; Chapter 6, Shloka No. 190-198; Publisher - Motilal Banarasidas; 11th Edition 1979].<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a method for simultaneous preparation of Jasad Bhasma and Rasasindoor, which is economical.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for simultaneous preparation of Jasad Bhasma and Rasasindoor, which is efficient.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for simultaneous preparation of Jasad Bhasma and Rasasindoor, which is time saving.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION:<br>
According to the invention there is provided a method for simultaneous preparation of Jasad Bhasma and Rasasindoor consisting of:<br>
a) preparing an amalgam of Shuddha Jasad (ayurvedically processed zinc) and Shuddha Parad (ayurvedically processed mercury) in the weight ratio 1:1 by  heating  and melting  the Shuddha Jasad and<br><br>
adding the Shuddha Parad to the molten Jasad, followed by triturating the blend and washing it with lemon juice followed by water and drying;<br>
b)	preparing Kajjali by trituration of the amalgam with Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulphur) in the weight ratio of 2 : 1 ;<br>
c)	heating the Kajjali by the Kupipakwa method at bottle temperature of  550±20°C;<br>
d)	removing Rasasindoor deposited at the neck region of the bottle; and<br>
e)	collecting the Jasad Bhasma at the bottom of the bottle and powdering it followed  by frying it  at 450 ± 10 °C in cow's ghee.<br>
Shuddha Jasad is obtained by shodhan (ayurvedic processing) of Jasad (zinc) in known manner, for instance, by melting Jasad (zinc) at flame temperature of800±20°Cand pouring the melt molten Jasad in sesame oil, butter milk, cow's urine, Kanji (rice - paste) and Kulith kwath (decoction of horse gram<br><br>
Shloka No. 29; Publisher - Choukhambha Sanskrit Bhavan, Varanasi; 1st Edition 1998].<br>
Shuddha Parad is obtained by shodhan (ayurvedic processing) of Parad (mercury) in known manner, for instance by triturating it in garlic juice [Parad Samhita; Chapter 30, Shloka No. 85; Publisher - Shree Venkateshwar Steam Press, Mumbai; 1932].<br>
Shuddha Gandhak (ayurvedically processed sulfur) is obtained by shodhan (ayurvedic processing) of Gandhak (sulphur) in known manner, for instance by melting Gandhak (sulphur) at flame temperature of 300 ± 20°C and then pouring it into cow milk, followed by washing with water and drying [Ayurved Prakash; Chapter 2, Shloka No. 17; Publisher - Y. G. Dikshit, Pune; 1925].<br>
The products formed in the Kupi (glass bottle) may be removed in known manner, for instance, by tying a rope dipped in kerosene just below the neck of the bottle and igniting it, followed by sudden cooling by sprinkling water on the heated area which causes breaking of the  neck of the bottle. Jasad<br><br>
bhasma is obtained at the bottom region whereas Rasasindoor is obtained at the neck region of the bottle.<br>
Conventionally both Jasad Bhasma and Rasasindoor are prepared separately independently, by Sharava Samputa and Gajaputa arrangement for Jasad bhasma and Kupipakwa method for Rasasindoor. According to the invention both Jasad bhasma and Rasasindoor are prepared simultaneously by the Kupipakwa method. It is, therefore, economical, efficient and time saving.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1<br>
Shuddha Jasad (66.7 g) was heated to melt and Shuddha Parad (66.7 g) was added to it. The blend was triturated in mortar and pestle (Khala) for 15 minutes to obtain a homogeneous amalgam, which was powdered and sifted through 40 mesh and washed with lemon juice (100 ml) followed by water (q.s.) till the amalgam was free of lemon juice. It was then dried at 70 ± 5°C.<br><br>
Shuddha Gandhak (66.7 g) and the amalgam obtained above, were triturated in a ball mill for 72 hours till a homogeneous black powder - Kajjali was obtained. 200 grams of the above Kajjali was heated by the Kupipakwa method for 7.5 hours (maximum bottle temperature attained was 538 °C). The deposit (45 g) at the neck region of the bottle was removed, powdered and sieved through 80 mesh. The powder was reddish brown, odourless , tasteless and contained<br>
Mercury 82.53% [Determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry] Sulphur   12.25% [Determined by Gravimetry method]<br>
The above findings corresponded to the analysis of Rasasindoor prepared by traditional method [ Pharmacopoeial Standards for Ayurvedic Formulations by Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha; Page No. 296; Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi; Revised Edition 1987] and therefore the compound obtained was identified as Rasasindoor.<br>
The product (105 g) at the bottom of the bottle was powdered and sieved through 80 mesh. The powder was pale yellow, tasteless, odourless and contained<br><br>
Zinc    62.32%     [Determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry] Sulphur 29.27%    [Determined by Gravimetry method]<br>
The above findings conformed to the analysis of Jasad bhasma prepared by traditional method [Shree Dhootapapeshwar Standards-BH-04-Rasatarangini, Chapter 19, ShlokaNo. 104-107] and therefore the compound obtained was identified as Jasad bhasma.<br>
Jasad bhasma was fried in cow ghee (10.5 g) at 450°C till the vapours ceased to come.<br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed using 100 gms of each of shuddha Jasad, shuddha Parad and shuddha Gandhak and Kajjali was heated by the Kupipakwa method for 7.5 hours (maximum bottle temperature attained was 560°C).<br><br>
Yield of Rasasindoor was 68 grams and it contained<br>
Mercury 82.78% [Determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry] Sulphur     12.65% [Determined by Gravimetry method]<br>
Yield of Jasad bhasma was 154.5 grams and it contained<br>
Zinc      61.99%o    [Determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry] Sulphur 29.04%)   [Determined by Gravimetry method]<br>
The physical appearances of the products were as stated in Example 1. The identity of the products was established as described in Example 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed using 66.67 g each of shuddha Jasad, shuddha Parad and shuddha Gandhak and Kajjali was heated by the Kupipakwa method for 7.5 hours (maximum bottle temperature attained was 565 °C).<br><br>
Yield of Rasasindoor was 48 grams and it contained<br>
Mercury  83.63% [Determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry] Sulphur    13.26%o [Determined by Gravimetry method]<br>
Yield   of Jasad bhasma was 107 grams and it contained<br>
Zinc      61.80%o   [Determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry] Sulphur 31.93%   [Determined by Gravimetry method]<br>
The physical appearances of the products were as stated in Example 1. The identity of the products was established as described in Example 1.<br><br>
