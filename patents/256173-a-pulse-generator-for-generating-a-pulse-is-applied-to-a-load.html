				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
Tbe present invention relates to systems and methods for generating high voltage pulses.   More particularly, flip present invention relates to systems and methods for generating high Voltage pulses controlled by solid state switches. Related Technology<br>
Many applications need a pulsed power supply that is able lo deliver high voltage pulses. Spectrometers, accelerators, radar transmitters, high impedance electron guns, ion tubes, liquid polarizing cells, etc.* arc examples of applications that need high voltage pulses. In conventional systems, a pulsed power supply uses a high voltage pulse forming network and some sort of switch such as a spark gap or a tbyratron.<br>
These types of pulsed power supplies are often created using principles of Marx Generators. Generally, a Marx Generator is circuitry that generates a voltage pulse by charging a group of capacitors in parallel and then discharging the capacitors in series. Figure I illustrates an example of a typical Marx Generator. In Figure 1, a charging voltage 101 is applied to a pulse forming network 100. The stage capacitors 104 charge through the rcsisfors 102 in a parallel fashion. The spark gaps 106 prevent the capacitors 104 from discharging into a load 108 until certain conditions are satisfied.<br>
When ths capacitors 104 are sufficiently charged, the lowest gap is typically allowed to break down or is triggered. When the lowest gap breaks down or triggers, two capacitors are effectively in series and the next gap, breaks down. Very .quickly, all of the gaps break down. The result of this process is that the capacitors 104 are connected in series and a voltage pulse is generated and delivered to tbe load 108. The capacitors 104 of a Marx Generator may also be charged using inductors or a series of transformers. In other example, tfie resistors 102 are replaced with inductors. The spark gaps can alternatively bo replaced, for example, with switches such as thyratrons.<br>
Because a Marx Generator is charged in parallel, the magnitude of the voltage pulse can be inujeased by adding additional charging sections. However, it has been found that the nutaiber of sections that can be stacked together is effectively limited by stray capacitance. As tbe number of sections in the pulse forming network increases, the stray capacitance fo ground Also increases. One of the effects of stray capacitance is that the current is diverted to ground. The stray capacitance also has an adverse affect on tbe<br><br>
rise time and/oi fall times of die voltage pulse. The Stray capacitance therefore limits the number of sections that can be included in the pulse generator.<br>
The stay capacitance can also have an impact on the voltage that a particular section sees. In addition, the stray capacitance seen by one section is usually different from the stray capacitance seen by another section of tius Marx Generator. Because the stray capacitance is not .balanced across the sections of the pulse generator, some of die sections may experience higher voltages and may therefore malfunction. Although most systems are affected by stray capacitance, the inductors, resistors, transformers, and isolated supplied! needed to charge the capacitors in the pulse generator also add stray capacitance to the pulse generator. In other wordst the components of conventional pulse generators introduce additional stray capacitance to the system and further reduce the number of sections that can be successfully connected together.<br>
Because Marx Generators are often used to .generate high voltages, (hoy can be quite large in both size and weight In addition, a Marx Generator that generates hundreds of kitovolts should be using oil. Oil is typically necessary* but is often undesirable. Conventional pulsed power supplies or Marx Generators arc often large and expensive, are limited by stray capacitance, and .use components (such as thyratrans) that reduce their rdialjulity.<br>
BRIEf? SUMMARY OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
These and other limitations are overcome by embodiments of the present invention, which irelates to systems and methods for generating a voltage pulse. In one embodiment of .the invention, a series voltage cells with relatively low- voltage requirements can be stacked together in series, each voltage cell including a capacitor connected in series with a switch (such as a solid state switch) that can he turned on and off. When multiple voltage ceils are connected to form a pulse generator, the capacitors of trie voltage cells are charged in parallel and discharged in series using one or more switches. Main switches are used at least to discharge the capacitors and return switches arc used at least to charge the capacitors.<br>
When the voltage cells are stacked, for example, the capacitors and main switches are connected in series. The capacitors are isolated from each other by the main switches which are turned j off. When the main switches are on, the capacitors are connected in series and a voltage pulse is generated. When the main switches are off, the return switches may be turned on and pzovide a return path for the current that charges the<br><br>
capacitors in the voltage cells. Thus, the return switches are off when the main switches are on such that the capacitors discharge to the load Advantageously, the capacitors can be charged without the use of inductors, resistors, or isolated supplies, thereby reducing some of file stray capacitance associated with conventional Marx Generators. In addition, the switches can be driven by use pf an auxiliary supply without using inductors, resistors, isolated supplies, or step down supplies.<br>
The capacitors in each voltage cell can be charged through a diode string supply line. A return ptth for the charging current is provided through return switches. When the capacitors a{e charging or are charged, main switches placed between successive capacitors are in £n off state and prevent the capacitors From discharging in series. When the main switches are turned on, the capacitors are then connected in series and discharge. During discharge; the return switches are turned off. To recharge the capacitors, the main switches are turned off and the return switches are turned back on. The. return switches can also be turned on during discharge to help, in one embodiment, decrease die fall time of the pulse by providing a path for the stray capacitance to discharge.<br>
The voltage cells can also be configured to generate either a ptuutive or a negative voltage pulse. In one embodiment, a bipolar pulse generator has a capacitor bank that includes a series pf voltage cells configured to generate a positive pulse can be connected with a capacitor bank that includes a series of voltage cells configured to generate a negative pulse. This bipolar pulse generator can charge all of the capacitors in both sets of voltage cells ajt the same time. The switches in the respective capacitor banks can be controlled to discharge one set of capacitors to generate either the positive or the negative pulse. In addition, voltage cells mat ate configured to charge in series can be added to provide droop control and control the shape of the generated voltage pulse.<br>
Bach voltage cell may also includes a balance network (hat balances the stray capacitance seen 'by that voltage bell. Because each voltage .cell in a series of voltage cells "sees" a different stray capacitance, the balance networks can be adapted to match the stray capacitance seen by the voltage cells. This has the benefit of balancing the voltage seen by each celt.<br>
The voltage cells can be used to adjust the voltage pulse by .controlling which voltage cells are active. In other words, one or more of the voltage cells can be made inactive to alter the voltage pulse without affecting the ability to generate the voltage pulse. At the s$roe tune, the ftihire of a particular cell does not prevent the poise generator from pulsing. Thus, embodiments of the present invention can control the<br><br>
amplitude of the -voltage pulse, a duration or width of the voltage pulse, the rise and fell times of the voltajgc pulse, and the like or any combination thereof.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the doseriptibfl whiofc follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of the invention. The features and advantage? of die invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBQlMMEPfTfi Of TftR INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for generating a voltage pulse. Embodiments of the invention can control an amplitude pf the voltage pulse, a duration or width of the voltage pulse, a rise time of the voltage pulse, a fall time of the voltage pulse, and the like or any combination thereof.<br>
Embodiments of die invention include voltage cells that typically have both a capacitor and a switch in series. The Hist and last voltage cells in a series of voltage cells may be adapted to connect to the load. Return switches ate also included in most voltage cells. The return switches provide a path for die charging current supplied through e diode chain or a diode chain supply line. Advantageously, the return switches eliminate the use of inductors, resistors, and isolated supplies prevalent in conventional pulse generators. The Switch drives are also provided with energy through an auxiliary diode chain, thereby elbninating the need for inductors, resistors, isolated supplies, and step dowfl supplies that would otherwise be needed to provide the auxiliary power to the switch drives. Afco, the elimination of these components reduces the stray capacitance to ground associated with the systems and methods described herein, which enables more voltage cells or sections to be stacked in series.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a pulse generator or system for generating and delivering a high voltage pulse to a load. Mote particularly, me system 200 generates and delivers a high voltage pulse to the load 206. In the system 200, a switched capacitor bank 202 includes one or more capacitor or voltage cells 210 that are typically arranged in series. The voltage cells 210 are used to store the energy that is delivered to the load 206 as a voltage pulse.<br>
The voltage cells 210 are typically associated with switches 212 that are controlled by the switch drivers 204. By controlling die control signals 208, the switch drivers 204 can turn the switches 212 on/off. The state of the switches 212, determines whether the voltage cells 210 arc charging or discharging through the load 206. In one embodiment, the effects of stray capacitance ate reduced such that more voltage cells can be connected in aeries. Because more voltage cells can be connected in series, a lower voltage source can be used to generate a larger voltage pulse. Also, the switch drivers can be raited for lower voltages. As a result, the cost and size of the pulse generator ate typically reduced.<br><br>
In one embodiment bf the system 200, the voltage cells ate charged in parallel and discharged in scnes by controlling the state of the switches 212. One of the advantages of the system 200 i$ that one or more of tire voltage cells 210 can fail without preventing the system 200 from delivering a high voltage pulse to the load 206. The system 200 can be configured IQ deliver a positive voltage pulse, deliver a negative voltage pulse, or deliver either a positive or negative voltage pulse (bipolar output). In addition, the control signals 208 can be used to control a duration of the voltage pulse, a magnitude of the voltage pulse, a rise time of the voltage pulse, and the like or any combination thereof. The control signals may be Optically coupled to the switch drivers 204 in One embodiment.<br>
Figure 3A illustrated a diagram of one embodiment of a system for storing.and/or delivering a high voltage pulse to a load. More particularly, Figure 3A illustrates a tew voltage cells connected in series, but one of skill in the art can appreciate the more or fewer voltage cells can be included. Bach vollage cell U similarly configured and operate together to (i) charge the capacitors hi parallel or independently of other voltage cells and (ii) discharge thacapacitors in series.<br>
For example, the voltage cell 362 includes, in mis example, a capacitor 366 that is used to store a charge. At the same time, the capacitor 378 in the voltage cell 374 is also storing a charge. When storing a charge, the switches 364 .and 376 (and similar switches in other voltage tells) are off. Thus, the capacitors 366 and 378 can charge in parallel or independently.<br>
The capacitors 366 and 378 are charged by the supply line 388 and because the switches 364 and 376 are o£C the return switches 368 and 380 are turned on to provide a return path for th* charging current provided through the supply line 388. As illustrated in Figure 3B, the supply line 388 is a diode string and typically includes one or more diodes to separate the voltage cells. The switch drives 370 and 382 control the state of the switches 364iand 376, respectively. The switch drives 372 and 384 control the state of the return swijtches 368 and 380, respectively. The control lines 390 can be used to control the states*of the switches 364,376 and the states of the return switches 368,380.<br>
When the switches 364, 376 are turned on and the return switches 368, 380 are turned off, then the capacitors 366,378 are connected and discharge in series to the load 392. In other words, connecting and discharging the capacitors 366, 378 in series generates a high Voltage pulse that is applied to the load 392. Turning off the switches 364, 376 can terminate the pulse. Thus* the duration of the pulse can be controlled<br><br>
through controlling the switches 364, 376. If a particular voltage cell is non-functional, the supply line 388 is an example of the path that the current can follow during delivery of the poise. In jpther words, a non-functional voltage cell does not prevent a poise from being generated or delivered to the load 392.<br>
Figure 3P illustrates one embodiment of a high voltage pulse generator. This embodiment includes three voltage cells, but as previously stated, one of skill in the art can appreciate that more or fewer stages can be included. Ln this example, the capacitors 310, 314, and 318 store charge. Charge is stared by turning the switches 308, 312, and 316 to an off state.<br>
When charging the capacitors 310,314, and 318, the return switches 332,334, and 336 are in an ori state and the main switches 30?, 312, and 316 arc off. The path 326 illustrates a path {of the Current from the power supply 304 that charges the capacitor 318. At the same time, the power supply 304 delivers current through the path 324 to charge Ibe capacitor 314. The path 324, after passing through the capacitor 314, proceeds through the return switch 336 via the.connection 330. A similar path through the diode 320 and the return switches 334, and 336 is used to charge the capacitor 310. The current that charges the capacitor 310 proceeds through the connection 328 and then through the return switches 334 and 336. The diodes 320 and 322 isolate the power supply 304 from the pulse and ensure that the current flows to the load 306 during discharge. At the same time, the diodes permit the pulse to pass around any voltage cell that is not functioning.<br>
During discharge of the capacitors, the switches 308, 312, and 316 are turned on using the control signals provided to the switch drives 33$, 342, and 346, respectively. At the same time, the control signals are delivered to Jhe switch drives 340, 344, and 348 to turn the return switches 332, 334, and 336 off When the return switches 332,334, and 336 are turned off, the discharge current does not flow through the return switches and is delivered to the load 306.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3B, the connection 328 is shown as a wire or short while the connection 330 is illustrated as an inductor. Typically, all of the connections hi the voltage cells are the same, but two (ypcs of connections are illustrated in this example to describe additional embodiments of the invention. When the connection is an inductor like the connection 330, the tuning between turning the switch 316 on and the return switches off can bo delayed. An inductive connection 330 can increase the rise time of the leading edge of the pulse.<br><br>
For example, when the switches 308, 312, and 316 are turned on and the return switches 332, 334, and 336 ate also on, a current begins to build in the inductive connections like the connection 330. After allowing: the inductance to build, die return switches 332, 384, and 336 can be turned off. There is thus a delay in turning the switches 308,31J2, and 316 off and turning the return switches 332,334, and 336 on. The energy stored iji the inductive connection 330 is then added to the energy being discharged from jthe capacitors 210,314, and 318. Combining (he inductive energy of be inductive connection 330 with the capacitrve energy stored in the capacitors 310,314, and 318 results hi a faster rise time of the voltage pulse. One of skin in the art, however, can appreciate that an inductive connection does not require a delay to be incorporated between turning the switches 308, 312, and 316 to an on State and turning the return switches 332,334, and 336 to an off state.<br>
When top pulse generator is ready to terminate Die high voltage pulse, the switches 308, 31.2, and 316 are typically turned oft The fall time of the high voltage pulse can be improved by turning on the return switches 332, 334r and 336. Opening the path through the return switches can help discharge stray capacitance and/or load capacitance, which improves the fall time of the high voltage poise.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a block diagram of a poise generator that includes multiple voltage cells (also referred to herein as stages or sections). The example of the pulse generator illustrated in Figure 4 generates a positive voltage pulse. Figure 4 illustrates the voltage cells 474, 472, 470, and 468 mat are connected as previously described using main switches 414,416,418, and 420 controlled by switch drives 448,452,456, and 460, and return switches 438,440,442, and 444 controlled by switch drives 446,450,454, and 458. In this example, the return path from the supply line 404 includes inductive connections 415, 417, and 419 from the charging capacitors 422, 424, 426, and 426 through the return switches;<br>
Figure 4 further illustrates an auxiliary path 473 that is used by the power supply 466 to provide power to the switch drives 446, 448, 450, 452, 454, 456, 458, and 460 (446-460). The auxiliary path 472 includes the auxiliary diodes 476,478, 480, and 482 (476-482). The auxiliary diodes 476-482 help isolate the power supply 466 and help deliver pulse to the load 402.<br>
lite auxiliary diode string that includes the auxiliary diodes 476-482 represent a voltage drop for efach diode in the diode string. Thus, the Voltage availabk at a particular stage is affected by the forward voltage drops of the diodes in the diode string. The<br><br>
voltage provided by the auxiliary power 466 simply provides sufficient voltage to overcome the forward voltage drops of the diodes and/or the charging switch voltage drops. If a largo number of voltage cells are included, boosting voltage supplies may be included to provide adequate voltage levels.<br>
The switch drives or switches 446-460, in one embodiment can be any type of solid state switches known in the art. Bipolar junction transistors, field effect transistors, IGBTs, Darlington Bipolar transistor, solid state switches, and the like are examples of switches that cart be used as described herein. Each voltage cell includes a switch drive for a main switch and a switch drive for a return switch. For example* the voltage cell 468 includes a switch drive 448 used to control the mam switch 414. In (his example, the gate of the main switch 414 is controlled by the switch drive 448. The switch drive. 446 controls a state of Ihe return switch 438.<br>
The voltage available to the switch drives 446-460 is often reduced at successive switch drives by the voltage drop across previous diodes in me diode string and switches. Each switch drive can be driven from either ground or from the previous voltage cell. In one Embodiments DC-DC converters may be used to provide adequate voltage. In another embodiment, the switch drives are optically coupled from ground.<br>
The energy storage capacitors 422, 424, 426* and 428 are charged by way of the diodes 406,408,410, and 412 and the return switches. Charging the capacitors in this manner eliminates the use of inductors, resistors, or isolated supplies that ate common in conventional Marx Generators. In addition, the energy needed to drive the switches can also be provided through the diode string in the auxiliary path 473, eliminating the use of inductors, resistors, or isolated supplies or step down supplies that may otherwise be needed. The switches can be triggered by way of example, fiber optic coupling, transformer coupling, or by the auxiliary power diodes.<br>
The diode! string that includes the diodes 406,408,410, and 412 provides several advantages. First; the diode string isolates each voltage cell of voltage stage from other voltage cells or stages during the pulse. The diode string also an alternate current path around a particular voltage cell or stage of the switch for that particular voltage cell is not turned on or is delayed The diode suing enables a voltage pulse to be delivered even though a voltage gel) is delayed or fails.<br>
Figure 4 further illustrates balance networks 430, 432, 434, and 434. Each balance network typically includes a capacitor in series with a resistor and each balance network helps balance the stray capacitance to ground. The capacitance in the balance<br><br>
netwodcs helps tp equally distribute the voltages from section to section during the rise time and the fal| time of the voltage pulse. Because the stray capacitance to ground associated with a, particular voltage cell is typically different from the stay capacitance to ground associate^ with other voltage cells of the pulse transformer, die capacitance and/or resistance of each voltage cell can be adapted to match the stray capacitance "seen" by that voltage cell, Thus the capacitance of the balance network 430 may be different from the capacitance of the balance networks 432, 434, and 436. The capacitance of each balance network is selected to match the stray capacitance. The resistance in each balance network helps reduce ringing of the stray inductance and/or die stray capacitance. The power supply 462 can provide a source of power at the high voltage end of the load 402. For example, if the load 402 is a pulsed tube, then the power supply 462 can provide power for the filament or beater of the pulsed tabs. Thus power supply 462 provides a powersource at the high voltage end without additional equipment<br>
Figure 5 Illustrates another embodiment of a pulse generator. Figure 5 is similar to the pulse generator illustrated in Figure 4, with the difference that the pulse generator in Figure 5 generates a negative voltage pulse whereas the pulse generator of Figure 4 generates a positive pulse. The charging diodes 502, 504, 506, 508, and 510 and the auxiliary diodes 512,514,516, and 518 are configured to accommodate a negative power supply 500, 520. The switches and the return switches are also adapted to a negative supply.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an embodiment of a pulse generator that has a bipolar output. In other words, the pulse generator 600 illustrated in Figure 6 can generate both positive and negative type voltage pulses. The bipolar pulses can be generated by stacking voltage cells configured to generate a positive voltage pulse hi series with voltage cells configured to generate « negative voltage pulse.<br>
In Figure 16 the positive voltage cells 618 generate a positive type voltage pulse and the negative voltage cells 620 generate a negative type voltage pulse. The voltage cells 618 are in series with the voltage cells 620. In this example, the diode string 602, which is used to charge the capacitors in the voltage cells 618, is connected with the return line switch string 604 of the voltage cells 620 via the connection 606. Similarly, the diode string 610, which is used to charge the capacitors in the voltage cells 620, is connected in series with the return line switch string 622 of the voltage cells 618 via the connection 60S. The negative supply auxiliary diode string 614 is connected with the positive supply auxiliary diode string 616 using an inverting DC-DC supply 612. All of<br><br>
the capacitors in the positive voltage cells 618 and the negative voltage cells 620 can be charged at the same time.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates an embodiment of a pulse generator that includes droop correction. Mori* particularly, Figure 7 illustrates droop correction for a negative type puls* generator. The embodiment of the pulse generator illustrated in Figure 7 includes a plurality of voltage cells 714 99 previously described. In this example, the voltage cells 714 are connected with a series of cells 702 that an? different from the voltage cells 714.<br>
In this example, the voltage cells 702 ate configured such that they charge in series and discharge in parallel, the switch drives 708,716,718,720, and 722, control the switches 70S, 732, 734b 736, and 738 such that the capacitors 704,724,726,728.730, and 740 charge ia series. At the same time, the storage capacitors of the voltage cells 714 are charging in parallel. However, the voltage cells 702 are configured to provide droop correction.<br>
When the switches in the voltage eells 702 are on, the capacitors charge in series. During the voltage pulse, the voltage cells 702 can be discharged such that the shape of the voltage pulse can be adjusted, in one embodiment, .the droop can be corrected across the entire pulse by controlling or delaying the discharge of the capacitors in the voltage cells 702.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pulse may drive a pulse transformer with a core that needs to be reset A reset supply could be included in series with the ground end of the charging switch to provide the core reset current This eliminates the need to have a core reset inductor.<br>
