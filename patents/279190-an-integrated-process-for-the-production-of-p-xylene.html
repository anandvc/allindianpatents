				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated process for the production of p-xylene.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
P-xylene (PX) is one of basic organic feedstock's in petrochemical industry, and finds widespread use in the production of various chemicals such as chemical fibers, synthetic resins, agrochemicals and medicines. P-xylene is typically produced from an ethylbenzene-containing xylene stream, i.e., C8 aromatic hydrocarbon stream (C8A), in thermodynamic equilibrium derived from catalytic reforming of naphtha, wherein p-xylene is separated from a mixture of isomers having similar boiling points through a multi-stage cryogenic crystallization separation technique or a simulated moving bed molecular sieve adsorption separation (briefly referred to as adsorption separation) technique. The separated o- and m-xylenes are generally isomerized into p-xylene through a C8A isomerization (briefly referred to as isomerization) technique. Disproportionation of toluene or disproportionation and transalkylation of toluene and Cg+ aromatic hydrocarbons (briefly referred to as toluene disproportionation and transalkylation) may be utilized to produce benzene and C8A, thereby obtaining even more p-xylene.<br>
Until now, the relatively well-developed processes associated with toluene disproportionation include conventional Tatoray toluene disproportionation process as industrialized at the end of 1960's, MTDP process as put forward at the end of 1980's, and S-TDT process and TransPlus process as put forward in recent years. Toluene selective disproportionation is a new route for the production of p-xylene, wherein toluene undergoes selective disproportionation over a modified ZSM-5 catalyst to produce benzene and C8A with a high concentration of p-xylene, and a majority of p-xylene can be separated through only a simple step of freezing separation. In recent years, as the performance of the catalysts is continuously improved, this process is significantly developed. It is represented by MSTDP toluene selective disproportionation process as industrialized in the later stage of 1980's and pX-Plus process as put forward in recent years.<br>
The MSTDP toluene selective disproportionation process comprises treating a toluene feedstock with a modified ZSM-5 mesoporous molecular sieve catalyst, to produce C8A with a high concentration of p-xylene (85-90%, by weight, the same below unless otherwise specified)<br>
 <br>
and nitration grade benzene. The pX-Plus process, of which industrial application has not been reported, has the following main technical parameters: in the case of a toluene conversion of 30%, the selectivity of PX in xylenes reaches 90%, and the molar ratio of benzene to PX is 1.37.<br>
However, such toluene selective disproportionation processes have a strict requirement on the selection of feedstock while having a high para-selectivity. These processes can only employ toluene as the feedstock, and C9A cannot be used (at least cannot be directly used) in these processes, resulting in the waste of aromatic hydrocarbon resources. Furthermore, these processes produce a large quantity of benzene as by-product, resulting in a relatively low yield of p-xylene, which is a fatal shortcoming of the selective disproportionation processes.<br>
Typical feed to a reactor in Tatoray process comprises toluene and C9 aromatic hydrocarbons (C9A). The xylene produced by Tatoray process is a mixture of isomers in thermodynamic equilibrium, wherein the content of p-xylene that is the most valuable in industry is generally only about 24%. It is undoubted that Tatoray process possesses an obvious disadvantage relative to the toluene selective disproportionation processes that can produce mixed xylenes having a p-xylene concentration of about 90%. However, relative to the toluene selective disproportionation processes, Tatoray process has a great advantage that it is capable of converting C9A into benzene and xylenes. Literatures relating to Tatoray process include, for example, US4341914, CN98110859.8, US2795629, US3551510, and CN97106719.8. A representative process as set forth in US4341914 comprises the steps of: subjecting a reformed product to fractionation of aromatic hydrocarbons; feeding the resulting toluene and C9A to a Tatoray process unit for disproportionation and transalkylation; separating a reaction effluent; recycling toluene, C9A and a portion of C10 aromatic hydrocarbons (Ci0A), and collecting benzene as a product; passing C8 aromatic hydrocarbons together with additional Cg aromatic hydrocarbons from an isomerization unit to a PX separation unit to separate a high purity p-xylene product; and passing other Cg aromatic hydrocarbon isomers to the isomerization unit for isomerization of xylene, to obtain mixed xylenes in thermodynamic equilibrium again.<br>
In recent years, as the rising of the toluene selective disproportionation processes, a process for the production of C6-C8 aromatic hydrocarbons by dealkylation of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons draws more and more attention. US5763721 and US5847256 respectively propose catalysts useful in the dealkylatoin of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons. Among these, US5847256 discloses a rhenium-containing mordenite catalyst, which is especially suitable for the conversion of feedstock enriched in aromatic hydrocarbons having one or more ethyl<br>
 <br>
groups to form toluene, xylenes, benzene, etc.<br>
The various Cg aromatic hydrocarbons have similar boiling points: 136.2°C for ethylbenzene, 138.4°C for p-xylene, 139.1°C for m-xylene, and 144.4°C for o-xylene. O-xylene having the highest boiling point can be separated by rectification process, which however requires more than one hundred of theoretical plates and a relatively great reflux ratio. Ethylbenzene having the lowest boiling point can also be separated by rectification process, which however is much more difficult. The various Cg aromatic hydrocarbons have markedly different melting points: 13.3°C for p-xylene, -25.2°C for o-xylene, -47.9°C for m-xylene, and -94.95°C for ethylbenzene. P-xylene has the highest melting point, and can be separated by crystallization process. If the concentration of p-xylene in the feedstock is not high, a two-stage crystallization process is generally employed in order to achieve an industrially acceptable yield. The process disclosed in US3177255 and US3467724 comprises the steps of: crystallizing most of p-xylene at a low temperature of -80 to -60°C, to achieve a yield close to the maximum theoretical yield, the crystal obtained having a purity of 65 to 85%; melting the crude xylene crystal followed by a second crystallization at a temperature of generally -20 to 0°C, to obtain p-xylene with a purity of above 99%; and recycling the mother liquor from the second crystallization, which has a relatively high p-xylene level, to the first crystallization stage.<br>
By virtue of the difference in selectivity of an adsorbent for various Cg aromatic hydrocarbons, p-xylene can be separated by an adsorption separation process. This process has become one of the major processes for the production of p-xylene once it has been industrialized in 1970's. US2985589 describes a process for the separation of p-xylene by using a countercurrent simulated moving bed; US3686342, US3734974 and CN98810104.1 describe the use of Ba-type or Ba and K-type X or Y zeolite as an absorbent in adsorption separation; US3558732 and US3686342 respectively describe the use of toluene and p-diethylbenzene as a strippant in adsorption separation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to overcome the problem regarding a large circulation quantity and a high energy consumption in xylene separation unit and isomerization unit due to a low concentration of p-xylene in mixed xylenes or regarding a low overall yield of p-xylene, suffered by the existing techniques for the production of p-xylene, the inventors made diligently studies.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a conventional process for the production of p-xylene. Figs. 2 and 3 depict the integrated processes for the production of p-xylene according to the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In step A) of the present process, a conventional technique is used to separate a mixed feedstock containing benzene, toluene, C8 aromatic hydrocarbons, C9 and higher aromatic hydrocarbons (C9+A, also referred to as heavy aromatic hydrocarbons hereinafter), and non-aromatic hydrocarbons from a reforming unit, to obtain benzene, toluene, C8 aromatic hydrocarbons, C9 and higher aromatic hydrocarbons, and non-aromatic hydrocarbons. Such a technique and processing conditions employed therein are well known to a person skilled in<br>
 <br>
the art.<br>
In step B) of the present process, C9 and higher aromatic hydrocarbons are subjected to dealkylation reaction over a dealkylation catalyst in the presence of hydrogen in a C9+A dealkylation unit, to produce benzene, toluene, and CgA. Toluene separated from the reaction effluent is fed to a toluene selective disproportionation unit. Benzene separated from the reaction effluent may be collected as a product or circulated in this unit. Preferably, at least a portion of the benzene is circulated in this unit, and this can reduce the formation of benzene as a by-product in the dealkylation reaction. CgA separated from the reaction effluent is fed to an adsorption separation unit, to produce pure p-xylene and a C8A stream mainly composed of m-xylene and o-xylene, which CgA stream is fed to an isomerization unit.<br>
In step B) of the present process, any of the catalysts for dealkylating aromatic hydrocarbons known in the art can be used. In an embodiment, the catalyst used in the C9+A dealkylation unit is a molecular sieve catalyst containing bismuth and/or its oxide in an amount of from 0.005 to 5 wt%, wherein the molecular sieve is at least one selected from the group consisting of [3-zeolite, mordenite and MCM-22.<br>
In an embodiment, the C9A dealkylation unit is operated under the following conditions: a reaction pressure of from 1 to 5 MPa (absolute, the same below), a reaction temperature of from 250 to 480°C, a molar ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbons of from 0.5:1 to 8: 1, and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.8 to 10 hr"1.<br>
In step C) of the present process, both the toluene obtained from the C9A dealkylation unit and the toluene obtained from step A) are fed to a toluene selective disproportionation unit, where toluene selective disproportionation reaction occurs in the presence of a toluene selective disproportionation catalyst. From the reaction effluent, a benzene stream and a CgA stream with a high concentration of p-xylene (which may be up to 80 to 95%) are separated. This CgA stream is sent to a crystallization separation unit to separate pure p-xylene, and the remaining of this CgA stream is sent to the adsorption separation unit to obtain pure p-xylene, or to the isomerization unit to obtain a mixed xylene stream having a thermodynamic equilibrium composition.<br>
In step C) of the present process, any of toluene selective disproportionation catalysts known in the art can be used. In an embodiment, the catalyst used in the toluene selective disproportionation unit is a ZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst containing at least one metal selected from platinum, molybdenum and magnesium and/or oxides thereof in an amount of from 0.005 to 5 wt%. Preferably, the toluene selective disproportionation catalyst used is a ZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst containing platinum and/or its oxides in an amount of from<br>
 <br>
0.005 to 5 wt%.<br>
In an embodiment, the toluene selective disproportionation unit is operated under the following conditions: a reaction pressure of from 1 to 4 MPa, a reaction temperature of from 300 to 480°C, a molar ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbons of from 0.5:1 to 10: 1, and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.8 to 8 hr"1.<br>
In the present process, p-xylene is separated in the p-xylene separation unit by means of adsorption separation in combination with crystallization separation. The CgA stream having a high concentration of p-xylene is separated by means of crystallization separation, whereby the separation can be fulfilled with a high efficiency at a low cost. The C8A stream having a concentration of p-xylene close to equilibrium concentration is separated by means of adsorption separation, whereby pure p-xylene can be obtained directly. The crystallization separation can be accomplished by falling-film crystallization separation or suspension crystallization separation. The crystallization temperature in falling-film crystallization separation is from -80 to 5°C. In suspension crystallization separation, the crystallization temperature is from -80 to 5°C, the weight ratio of washing liquid to crystal is from 0.05:1 to 0.5: 1. The adsorption separation process as well as the adsorbents and processing conditions used therein is well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
In the present process, the isomerization unit can be operated under the conditions well known to a person skilled in the art, and effluent from the isomerization unit may be fed to the adsorption separation unit to obtain additional pure p-xylene, and/or to the catalytic reforming unit.<br>
The present process not only makes well use of C9A resources, but also greatly increases the concentration of p-xylene in the mixed xylene produced, to thereby decrease the processing scales of the isomerization unit and the adsorption separation unit, effectively reduce the energy consumption and the equipment investment, lower the production cost, and achieve a preferable technical effect.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be further described in detail by reference to the figures. Fig. 1 shows a conventional process for the production of p-xylene. Figs. 2 and 3 show integrated processes for the production of p-xylene according to the present invention.<br>

 <br>
A conventional process for the production of p-xylene is shown in Fig. 1. The bottoms 1 from the depentanizing column in the reforming unit are fed to the deheptanizing column I, from the top of which the stream 2 of C7 and lower aromatic hydrocarbons and non-aromatic hydrocarbons is withdrawn. The stream 2 is fed to the aromatic hydrocarbon extraction unit II to separate the aromatic hydrocarbons from the non-aromatic hydrocarbons, with the non-aromatic hydrocarbons steam 5 separated being discharged, and the benzene/toluene stream 4 being fed to the benzene/toluene separation unit III. The benzene product stream 6 is withdrawn from the top of the benzene column in the unit III, and the mixed xylenes stream 8 is withdrawn from the bottom of the toluene column in the unit III. The stream 8 and the stream 3 from the bottom of the deheptanizing column are fed to the CgA separation unit IV. The steam of mixed xylenes 11 is withdrawn from the top of the xylene column in the unit IV, and then fed to the p-xylene adsorption separation unit IX. The C9A-containing stream 10 from the CgA separation unit IV and the toluene stream 7 from the top of the toluene column are sent as a feedstock to the toluene disproportionation and transalkylation unit V. The Cio+A stream 12 from the C8A separation unit IV is discharged as a by-product. The product stream 19 from the toluene disproportionation and transalkylation unit V is directly fed to the unit III for separation. From the adsorption separation unit IX, the stream 15 of p-xylene as the target product, a minor amount of toluene stream 14 and the stream 16 of a mixture of other xylenes are obtained. The toluene stream 14 is returned to the toluene disproportionation unit V, and the stream 16 of other mixed xylenes is fed to the xylene isomerization unit VIII for isomerization. The C8A stream 17 withdrawn from the bottom of the deheptanizing column in the isomerization unit is sent to the CgA separation unit IV, and the stream 18 containing benzene and toluene withdrawn from the top of the deheptanizing column is sent to the catalytic reforming unit.<br>
The integrated processes for the production of p-xylene according to the present invention are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. As compared with the conventional process shown in Fig. 1, the modifications of the present processes are: (1) the toluene disproportionation unit in the conventional process is changed to the heavy aromatic hydrocarbon dealkylation unit in the present processes; (2) the toluene selective disproportionation unit VI is added; and (3) the CgA stream is separated by means of crystallization separation or adsorption separation, depending on the concentration of p-xylene in the CgA stream, to obtain pure p-xylene. The difference between Figs. 2 and 3 and Fig. 1 is described in detail below, while the commonness between them is not mentioned herein anymore. In the present processes, the C9+A stream 10 that originally serves as a feedstock in the toluene disproportionation and transalkylation unit V is<br>
 <br>
used as a feedstock in the heavy aromatic hydrocarbon dealkylation unit VII, and benzene produced in this dealkylation reaction is circulated within the unit. The C7A stream 13 obtained from the dealkylation unit VII is sent to the toluene column in the benzene/toluene separation unit III for separation. The toluene stream 7 (including toluene introduced by the feedstock and toluene produced by the heavy aromatic hydrocarbon dealkylation reaction) is used as a feedstock in the toluene selective disproportionation unit VI. The product stream 9 from the toluene selective disproportionation unit VI enters the aromatic hydrocarbon fractionation unit X, where the benzene stream 20 is withdrawn from the top of the benzene column, the toluene stream 21 is withdrawn from the top of the toluene column and sent back to the toluene selective disproportionation unit VI, the bottoms 23 is withdrawn from the bottom of the xylene column and sent to the CgA separation unit IV, and the CgA stream 22 is withdrawn from the top of the xylene column.

Examples<br>
The following examples are given for further illustrating the invention, but do not make limitation to the invention in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
A C9A feedstock was obtained by separating a feedstock from a petrochemical aromatic hydrocarbon united plant. The C9A feedstock was subjected to dealkylation reaction in a fixed bed reactor in the presence of hydrogen. The reactor had an inner diameter of 25 mm and a length of 1000 mm, and was made of stainless steel. The reactor was packed with 20 g of a |3-zeolite catalyst containing 0.05 wt% bismuth, which had been prepared by impregnating a powdery ammonium-form [3-zeolite having a content of sodium oxide of 0.062wt% and a molar ratio of silica to alumina of 30 with a 30 wt% aqueous solution of chemically pure bismuth nitrate, adding a 20 wt% aqueous solution of chemically pure nitric acid to the impregnated powder, sufficiently blending and homogenizing the mixture, extruding the mixture into strips, and calcining the extrudates at 550°C for 4 hours to give the [3-zeolite catalyst containing 0.05 wt% bismuth. Glass beads of cp3 mm were packed below and above the catalyst bed layer, to take the effect of distributing gas and supporting. The C9+A feedstock was mixed with hydrogen and then passed through the catalyst bed layer downwards to perform dealkylation reaction of C9A, thereby producing benzene, toluene, and CgA. The<br>
 <br>
reaction temperature was 425°C, the reaction pressure was 3.0 MPa, the weight hourly space velocity was 2.0 hr"1, and the molar ratio of hydrogen/hydrocarbon was 5.0: 1. The hydrogen was electrolytic hydrogen, and was subjected to a dehydration drying treatment before use. The reaction results are listed in Table 1.

It could be seen from the above experiment that the dealkylation reaction of the feedstock C9A produced benzene, toluene, and CgA.<br>
A toluene feedstock was obtained by separating a feedstock from a petrochemical aromatic hydrocarbon united plant. The toluene feedstock was subjected to toluene selective disproportionation reaction in a fixed bed reactor in the presence of hydrogen. The reactor had an inner diameter of 25 mm and a length of 1000 mm, and was made of stainless steel. The reactor was packed with 20 g of a ZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst containing 0.05 wt% platinum, which had been prepared according to the process as described in CN 1340486A (Process for the preparation of catalysts for toluene selective disproportionation). Glass beads of cp3 mm were packed below and above the catalyst bed layer, to take the effect of distributing gas and supporting. The toluene feedstock was mixed with hydrogen and then passed through the catalyst bed layer downwards to perform toluene selective disproportionation reaction, thereby producing benzene and CgA consisting mainly of p-xylene. The hydrogen was electrolytic hydrogen, and was subjected to a dehydration drying treatment before use. The reaction temperature was 420°C, the reaction pressure was 1.5 MPa, the weight hourly space velocity was 4.0 hr"1, and the molar ratio of hydrogen/hydrocarbon was 3.0: 1. The reaction results are listed in Table 2.<br>

The product of the toluene selective disproportionation reaction was separated in an<br>
 <br>
aromatic hydrocarbon fractionation unit, to obtain CgA. The CgA was subjected to crystallization separation in a falling-film crystallizer. The falling-film crystallizer had an inner diameter of 25 mm, an outer diameter of 30 mm and a length of 500 mm, and was made of stainless steel. In the crystallizer, the feedstock went through the tube pass, and the cryogen went through the shell pass. The feedstock and the cryogen underwent countercurrent heat exchange in the crystallizer to perform crystallization separation, to thereby obtain a mother liquor, a sweating liquor, and pure p-xylene.<br>
The crystallization separation process was carried out in the following three stages: 1) feeding the feedstock at a flow rate of 5 mL/min and a temperature of 25°C, and the cryogen at a flow rate of 50 mL/min and a temperature of -20°C, so as to crystallize p-xylene on the wall of the crystallizer and leave a mother liquor, with the feeding being stopped after 2 hours; 2) increasing the temperature of the cryogen to 20°C, whereby the crystal obtained was heated and partially melted to obtain a melt which was called as a sweating liquor, with the second stage being sustained for 15 min; and 3) increasing the temperature of the cryogen to 30°C so as to melt totally the remaining crystal, to obtain pure p-xylene. The results of the falling-film crystallization separation process are listed in Table 3.<br>

Example 2<br>
This experiment was performed by following the procedure as described in Example 1, except that the CgA obtained by separating the product of the toluene selective disproportionation reaction in an aromatic hydrocarbon fractionation unit was subjected to suspension crystallization separation. The suspension crystallizer had a volume of 500 L, was equipped with a jacket and a stirrer, and was made of stainless steel. The washing tower had a volume of 40 L, and was made of stainless steel. The feedstock was subjected to suspension crystallization in the crystallizer, and the slurry obtained after the crystallization was sent to the washing tower to perform solid-liquid separation and product purifying/washing.<br>
The suspension crystallization separation process comprised a step of suspension crystallization and a step of washing/purifying. In the step of suspension crystallization, the feedstock was fed at a flow rate of 200 L/min and a temperature of 20°C, and the crystallization temperature was -5°C. In the step of washing/purifying, the washing liquid was fed at a flow rate of 15 L/min and a temperature of 20°C. The results of the suspension<br>

The experiment was carried out by using the flow rates of aromatic hydrocarbons (fresh feed) as listed in Table 5 according to the process as shown in Fig. 2. The conditions and catalyst used in dealkylation reaction of C9A, the conditions and catalyst used in toluene selective disproportionation reaction, and the conditions used in falling-film crystallization separation were the same as described in Example 1. The data regarding feed and discharge for toluene selective disproportionation unit, for C9A dealkylation unit, and for isomerization unit are listed in Table 6. The processing scales of various units in the equipment for the production of p-xylene are listed in Table 7. The yields of p-xylene and benzene as products are listed in Table 8.<br>
The results demonstrate that, by using the present process, it is possible to use the aromatic hydrocarbon feedstock as listed in Table 5 to produce p-xylene and benzene at a total yield of the both of 78324 Kg/hr. As compared with the Comparative Example 1 below, the processing scales of xylene isomerization unit, adsorption separation unit and aromatic hydrocarbon fractionation unit are reduced by 26%, 27% and 27%, respectively. This implies that the design scale of the equipment can be notably decreased. The energy consumption of the equipment is 19890 x 106 J/ton of (p-xylene + benzene), which is reduced by 25% in relative to the energy consumption of 26579 x 106 J/ton of (p-xylene + benzene) in Comparison Example 1. Thus,<br>
 <br>
the present invention overcomes the problems suffered by the existing techniques for the production of p-xylene that the concentration of p-xylene in mixed xylenes is low, that circulation quantity is large, and that energy consumption is high, and provides a new and economical process for the production of p-xylene.<br>
