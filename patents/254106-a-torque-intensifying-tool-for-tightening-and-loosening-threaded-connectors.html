				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a torque intensifying tool.<br>
	In tightening fasteners, once the nut hits the flange surface<br>
the turning degree to tighten it up is very little. What the customer wants,<br>
on the other hand, is high turning speed so that a nut can be run down or<br>
off very fast.<br>
	The usual impact wrenches, which provide a high run down<br>
and run off speed, have the disadvantage that they are not very accurate<br>
and very slow once the nut hits the flange face. Torque power tools are<br>
torque accurate, but relatively slow in run up and run down of fasteners.<br>
Yet, still they are faster than impact guns once the nut is turned on the<br>
flange face. Torque power tools usually have an air, electric or hydraulic<br>
motor. It turns gears, which reduce the speed but increases the relatively<br>
low torque output of the motor. The higher the torque, the larger the gear<br>
ratio and obviously the slower the speed with which the nut is turned. It is,<br>
therefore, common to have a two speed mechanisms; one for run down<br>
and run off and one for the final higher torque.<br>
	It is known that running a nut down takes usually less torque<br>
than running it off due to possible thread corrosion when loosening a nut.<br>
2<br><br>
This means that the torque derived by means of an air motor used for<br>
smaller air wrenches might have to be increased with a small intensifier to<br>
increase the turning torque provided by the motor without towering the run<br>
up and run off speed too much. For most hand held torque power tools<br>
where the motor housing is independent to the gear housing it becomes<br>
important that the free motor-turning torque does not exceed the hand<br>
torque resistance or the tool's motor housing can not be held and starts<br>
spinning in the hand.<br>
	There are many motor driven torque multipliers in the market<br>
and some of them have two speed mechanisms, some of them react on<br>
the bolt tip, others with a reaction arm. What they all have in common is<br>
that no matter what torque or speed is applied by them their gear housing<br>
turns in the opposite direction to the output shaft. None provides a run<br>
down or run off speed where the entire gear housing together with the<br>
inner gear assembly and the output drive turn at the same high speed in<br>
the same direction.<br>
	There are also portable power driven tools in the market<br>
such as disclosed in US 2,569,244 where a push of the tool onto the<br>
fastener increases or decreases the air inlet and thus the torque output.<br>
There is, however, none in the market where a push onto the fastener<br>
changes from turning the gear housing, its gears and its output shaft in the<br>
3<br><br>
same direction at the same speed to applying a turning force to the gears<br>
and the output shaft in one direction and simultaneously an opposite<br>
turning force to the gear housing. There are also portable power driven<br>
tools in the market where the torque of the motor can be reduced to<br>
increase the motor speed and thus the speed of the tool.<br>
	Also, the two speed mechanism of motor driven torque<br>
multipliers usually works in a way that one or several planet gear stages<br>
rae disconnected so that merely the remaining ones function. This<br>
reduces the gear ratio to obtain a higher speed and lower torque and so<br>
that once the nut stalls out all planet gear stages become functional to<br>
achieve the higher torque at a lower speed. Nevertheless, the housing<br>
still wants to react in the opposite direction to the turning direction of the<br>
gears in low ratio and high ratio. In other words, while the drive and the<br>
gears receive a turning force in one direction, the housing receives the<br>
same turning force in the opposite direction. The problem with that is that<br>
a high speed, the gears and the output shaft turn so fast in the gear<br>
housing that almost all turning parts require bearings, which makes the<br>
tool larger and heavier.<br>
4<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a torque intensifying tool which eliminates the disadvantage of the prior<br>
art.<br>
	The torque intensifying tool in accordance with the present<br>
invention is based on the idea to stop the usual equal, simultaneous but<br>
opposite turning of action and reaction when high nut turning speed is<br>
required so as to avoid that almost all turning parts require bearings.<br>
	In keeping with these objects and with others which will<br>
become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention resides,<br>
briefly stated, in a torque intensifying tool for tightening and loosening<br>
threaded connectors, comprising torque intensifier means having a torque<br>
intensifier housing portion, having input means and having a first output<br>
means and a second output means; a drive operatively connected with<br>
said input means for transmitting a torque from said drive through said<br>
intensifying means to a threaded connector, so that in one mode of<br>
operation when the fastener is subjected to a relatively low turning friction<br>
said torque intensifier housing portion together with said first and said<br>
second output means turn in the same direction and the same speed and<br>
torque as said input means, and in another mode of operation when the<br>
5<br><br>
fastener is subjected to a relatively high turning friction which can exceed<br>
the torque of said input means, said torque intensifier housing portion<br>
together with one of said first and second output means receives a turning<br>
force in one direction while the other one of said first and second output<br>
means receives an equal turning force in the opposite direction at a lower<br>
speed but higher torque than said input means, and so that one of said<br>
first and second output means turns in said one mode and in said another<br>
mode while the other of said first and second output means turns in said<br>
one mode and reacts in said another mode.<br>
	In the inventive tool in order for the housing, the gears of the<br>
torque intensifier and the input-and output means to turn in the same<br>
direction at the same speed, the usual equal and opposite turning of parts<br>
has to be blocked temporarily. This can be done in many way. For<br>
example, one can block the gears so that they cannot freely turn in the<br>
housing, or one blocks the planet gears so that the sun gear cannot turn<br>
them, or one blocks the housing and the output shaft so that they cannot<br>
turn independently from one another, or one blocks the action drive and<br>
the reaction drive or their attachment, or one blocks one part of the<br>
fastener with the other if both are to be turned down together and then<br>
turned independently from one another, etc.<br>
6<br><br>
	To achieve the same result without turning the housing, the<br>
gears and the output and input shaft together would be quite complex<br>
simply because one would have to cut out all or at least all but one gear<br>
cage temporarily, whereas in accordance with the present invention the<br>
entire intensifier housing is cut off temporarily by merely blocking two<br>
usually opposite turning parts.<br>
	With the tool in accordance with the present invention,<br>
during turning of one part of the threaded connector such as a nut and<br>
applying an action force, a reaction force can be compensated by reacting<br>
against a neighboring object for example against a neighboring nut,<br>
against another part of the threaded connector for example a washer,<br>
against a further part of the threaded connector for example a sleeve, etc.<br>
	The novel features which are considered as characteristic for<br>
the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims.<br>
The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of<br>
operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be<br>
best understood from the following description of specific embodiments<br>
when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

8<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
	A torque intensifying tool for tightening and loosening<br>
threaded connectors has drive means which are identified as a whole with<br>
reference numeral 1. The drive means 1 can have a drive housing 2 and<br>
a drive which is identified with reference numeral 3. The drive means 1<br>
can be formed as a motor drive means, in which case it can include a<br>
motor. It is also possible that the drive means 1 is formed as manual drive<br>
means, for example as a torque wrench. The drive means 1 generate a<br>
torque which is to be transmitted for operation. In the embodiment shown<br>
in Figures 1 a, 1 b the drive housing 2 has a handle 4 which is to be held by<br>
an operator and provided with switching means 5 for switching the drive<br>
means between an inoperative position and an operative position.<br>
	The torque intensifying tool in accordance with the present<br>
invention further has at least one torque intensifier means which are<br>
identified as a whole with reference numeral 6. The torque intensifier<br>
means 6 have a torque intensifier housing 7 and gear means connected to<br>
the drive means 1. In the embodiment shown in Figures 1a, 1b the gear<br>
means include a sun gear 8 having a shaft which forms an input means,<br>
planetary gears 9 and a planet cage 10. The torque intensifier housing 7<br>
is provided with an internal gear 11 which extends only over a longitudinal<br>
portion of the housing 7.<br>
9<br><br>
	The torque intensifying tool in accordance with the present<br>
invention further has a driving element which is identified as a whole with<br>
reference numeral 12 and forms a first output means. The driving element<br>
12 has a driving part 13 which can be formed for example as a square<br>
drive and a rear part 14 which is drivingly connected with the torque<br>
intensifier means, for example by interengaging splines. The connection<br>
of the drive means 1 with the torque intensifier means 6 and the driving<br>
element 12 provides transmission of torque from the drive means to the<br>
driving element. The torque intensifier means 6 can be configured to<br>
provide any desired intensification of a torque generated by the drive<br>
means 1.<br>
	The torque intensifying tool further has a reaction element<br>
which is identified with reference numeral 15 and forms a second output<br>
means. The reaction element 15 is provided with means 16 for<br>
connecting with an element reacting against a stationary object, for<br>
example a reaction arm, for example with splines. The reaction element<br>
15 is non rotatably connected with the torque intensifier housing 7. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figures 1a and 1b, the reaction element 15 is<br>
formed integral one-piece with the torque intensifier housing.<br>
	The torque intensifying tool has two different modes of<br>
operation. In one mode of operation when the torque is transmitted from<br>
10<br><br>
the drive means 1 through the torque intensifier means to the driving<br>
element 12 the driving element 12 provides a lower torque and a higher<br>
speed of turning. This is advantageous when it is necessary to turn one<br>
part of the threaded connector, for example a nut, on another part of the<br>
threaded connector, for example a bolt, with a high speed until the nut is<br>
seated on a washer or on the face of an application. In this mode of<br>
operation the torque is transmitted from the drive means, through the<br>
torque intensifier housing 7, the gears of the torque intensifier, the second<br>
output means or the reaction element 15, and the first output means or the<br>
driving element 12, so that the torque intensifier housing 7 together with<br>
the first output means and the second output means turn in the same<br>
direction and at the same torque and speed as the input means.<br>
	In another mode of operation the torque is transmitted from<br>
the drive means 1 through the torque intensifier means to the driving<br>
element 12 so that the torque intensifier housing 7 together with the<br>
second output means or the reaction element 15 receives a turning force<br>
in one direction, while the first output means or the driving element 12<br>
receives an equal turning force in the opposite direction at a lower speed<br>
but higher torque then the input means.<br>
	For switching the tool between these two different modes, in<br>
the embodiment shown in Figures 1a, 1b for example pushing elements<br>
11<br><br>
17, formed as pins and the like are provided. When the nut is seated on<br>
the washer, the pushing elements 17, which in Figure 1a illustrating one<br>
mode of operation extend outwardly beyond the torque intensifier housing<br>
7, are pushed in an axial direction as shown in Figure 1b, and the planet<br>
cage 10 which was previously engaged with the internal gear 11 of the<br>
torque intensifier housing 7 disengages from the internal gear, so that the<br>
first output means or the driving element 12 and the second output means<br>
or the reaction element 15 can turn in opposite directions. It is to be<br>
understood that different means for switching the torque intensifying tool<br>
between two different modes of operation are possible.<br>
	In accordance with the present invention in the torque<br>
intensifying tool the torque intensifier housing 7 and the drive housing 2<br>
are functionally connected with one another. In particular, the torque<br>
intensifier housing 7 can turn relative to the drive housing 2. For this<br>
purpose, as shown in Figures 1a, 1b, a part of the drive housing 2, which<br>
can contain additional torque intensifier means, can extend into the torque<br>
intensifier housing 7 and be supported in the latter through a bearing 18.<br>
With this construction, the torque intensifier housing 7 can freely turn<br>
relative to the drive housing 2. The drive housing 2 can be formed as an<br>
enclosure, as a support, as a frame, etc. for the drive. This also can be<br>
done by a switch automatically once the torque required exceeds a given<br>
force.<br>
12<br><br>
	In another embodiment of the present invention which is<br>
shown in Figures 2a-2c the first output means is formed as a driving<br>
socket 21 which has a portion 22 with a polygonal inner surface to engage<br>
the nut and a portion 23 with a polygonal outer shape. The second output<br>
means is also formed as a reaction socket having a portion 24 with a<br>
polygonal shape for engaging a neighbouring object, for example a<br>
washer, and a portion 25 with an inner polygonal opening configured to<br>
cooperate with the polygonal portion 23 of the driving socket. The driving<br>
socket has a receiving opening 26 in which a square drive 27 of a tool can<br>
be received. A spline portion 28 of the tool is received in an inwardly<br>
spline adaptor 29 which is non-rotatably connected with the reaction<br>
socket.<br>
	The driving socket is axially movable relative to the reaction<br>
socket. For one mode of operation the portion 23 of the driving socket<br>
engages in the portion 25 of the reaction socket so that the sockets<br>
become non-rotatably connected with one another as shown in Figure 2a<br>
and the torque of the drive means 1 is transmitted through the torque<br>
intensifier to the driving socket at the same speed and torque as the input<br>
means. In this mode the first and second output means turn.<br>
13<br><br>
	When as shown in Figure 2b the driving socket is axially<br>
displaced for example so that its portion 23 is disengaged from the portion<br>
25 of the reaction socket, the driving socket and the reaction socket are no<br>
longer non-rotatably connected with one another in the other mode of<br>
operation and they turn in opposite directions with equal turning forces at<br>
a lower speed but higher torque than the input means. In this mode the<br>
first output means or the driving socket turn, while the second output<br>
means or the reaction socket reacts.<br>
	In this embodiment in one mode of operation the torque<br>
intensifier housing together with the driving socket and reaction socket<br>
turn in the same direction and at the same speed and torque as the input<br>
means, wherein in the other mode of operation the torque intensifier<br>
housing together the reaction socket receives a turning force in one<br>
direction while the driving socket receives the turning force in the opposite<br>
direction.<br>
	It is to be understood that in the other mode the first and<br>
second output means can both act as driving means or reaction means in<br>
opposite directions depending on the application.<br>
	In the embodiment shown in Figure 3 a nut to be tightened<br>
or loosened is identified with reference numeral 31, a bolt on which the nut<br>
14<br><br>
is to be tightened or loosened is identified with reference numeral 32, and<br>
a washer is identified with reference numeral 33 and has a radially outer<br>
holding portion 34 and a radially inner portion 35 engageable with the bolt<br>
32. Means is provided for transmitting torque in the two modes of<br>
operation. They can be formed for example as connecting pins 36 which<br>
engage in aligned openings 38 of the nut and the washer.<br>
	In one mode of operation the pins 36 non-rotatably connect<br>
the nut with the washer so that they turn together with the same speed<br>
and torque as the input means. After the nut is seated on the washer, and<br>
a torque increases, the pins 36 are disintegrated, for example sheared off,<br>
so that the nut is turned with a higher torque and a lower speed than the<br>
input means while the washer provides a reaction.<br>
	It is to be understood that the at least two modes as<br>
described herein are merely examples. Further modes can be added to<br>
said one or said other modes and/or said input means and/or output<br>
means.<br>
	While the torque intensifying tool described hereinabove is a<br>
two speed tool, the present invention is not limited to merely two speeds<br>
but can have multiple speeds, as shown for example in Figures 4a, 4b.<br>
For example the drive operatively connected with the input means of the<br>
15<br><br>
torque intensifier means can be configured as an intermediate drive<br>
housing 50 so that the drive includes for example the drive housing 2 and<br>
the intermediate drive housing 50.<br>
	When two usually opposite turning parts are temporarily<br>
connected with one another in the torque intensifier means or at an end<br>
thereof and the intermediate drive housing 50, which contains at least one<br>
intensifier unit such as for example a planetary gear stage, is connected<br>
with the torque intensifier housing so as not to rotate relative to it a), the<br>
turning of the torque intensifier housing together with the first and second<br>
output means is at a speed and torque of what is derived from the drive<br>
housing portion 2. When the torque required to turn the fastener exceeds<br>
that torque derived from the drive housing 2 and the intermediate drive<br>
housing 50 is non-rotatably connected with the drive housing 2<br>
b), and rotatably connected with the torque intensifier housing, the turning<br>
of the torque intensifier housing 7 together with the first and second output<br>
means is at a lower speed but higher torque of what is derived from the<br>
drive housing 2. When the turning friction of the fastener is such that the<br>
tool switches from one mode to another, the torque applied to the fastener<br>
is one more times increased while the turning speed is further decreased.<br>
In Figure 4a the intermediate drive housing portion 50 is non-rotatably<br>
connected with the torque intensifier housing 7, while in Figure 4b the<br>
16<br><br>
intermediate drive housing 50 is non-rotatably connected with the drive<br>
housing 2.<br>
	It will be understood that each of the elements described<br>
above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other<br>
types of constructions differing from the types described above.<br>
	While the invention has been illustrated and described as<br>
embodied in a motor-driven torque intensifier, it is not intended to be<br>
limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural<br>
changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
	Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the<br>
gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current<br>
knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting<br>
features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential<br>
characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention.<br>
	What is claimed as new and desired to be protected by<br>
