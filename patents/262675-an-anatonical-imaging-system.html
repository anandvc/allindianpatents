(Attorney's Docket No. NLOGICA-14 PROV).<br>
The two above-identified patent applications are<br>
hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to anatomical imaging<br>
systems in general, and more particularly to<br>
anatomical imaging systems of the sort utilizing<br>
Computurized Tomography (CT) systems and the like.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Strokes are the third leading cause of death in<br>
the United States (causing approximately 177,000<br>
deaths per year) and the number one cause of long-term<br>
disability (affecting nearly 5 million people) .<br>
Strokes result from abrupt damage to the brain or<br>
spinal cord caused by an abnormality of the blood<br>
supply.<br>
Strokes typically occur in one of two forms: (i)<br>
hemorrhagic, which occurs with the rupture of a blood<br>
vessel; and (ii) ischemic, which occurs with the<br>
obstruction of a blood vessel.<br>
Rapid diagnosis is a key component of stroke<br>
management. This is because treatments for ischemic<br>
strokes may be contra-indicated for treatment of<br>
hemorrhagic strokes and, furthermore, the<br>
effectiveness of a particular treatment can be<br>
time-sensitive. In particular, the only approved<br>
therapy for acute ischemic strokes, i.e., the<br>
administration of tPA to eliminate clots, is .<br>
contra-indicated for hemorrhagic strokes.<br>
Furthermore, tPA is most effective if it is<br>
administered within 3 hours of the onset of an<br>
ischemic stroke. However, current diagnosis times<br>
(i.e., the time needed to identify that the patient is<br>
suffering from a stroke and to identify the<br>
hemorrhagic or ischemic nature of the stroke)<br>
frequently exceeds this 3 hour window. As a result,<br>
only a fraction of ischemic stroke victims are<br>
properly treated with tPA.<br>
Imaging is generally necessary to: (i)<br>
distinguish strokes from other conditions; (ii)<br>
distinguish between the different types of strokes<br>
(i.e., hemorrhagic or ischemic); and (ii) determine<br>
suitable treatments. Computerized Tomography (CT) has<br>
emerged as the key imaging modality in the diagnosis<br>
of strokes. CT scans, including Non-Enhanced CT, CT<br>
angiography and CT perfusion, provide the necessary<br>
and sufficient information for diagnosing and treating<br>
strokes.<br>
Unfortunately, however, the "round-trip" time<br>
between the emergency room (where the patient is<br>
typically first received) and the radiology department<br>
(where the CT machine is typically located) can<br>
frequently take up to several hours, even in the best<br>
hospitals. As a result, the time spent in<br>
transporting the patient from the emergency room to<br>
the CT machine and back again can consume critical<br>
time which can compromise treatment of the patient.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a new and improved CT<br>
machine which is particularly well suited for use in<br>
stroke applications.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention comprises a new and<br>
improved anatomical imaging system which addresses the<br>
foregoing problems. More particularly, the present<br>
invention comprises a small, mobile CT machine that<br>
can be moved to the patient so that the patient can be<br>
scanned at their current location, thus dramatically<br>
reducing diagnostic times. The mobile CT machine can<br>
be located in the emergency room, is easy to transport<br>
directly to the patient's bedside, and provides image<br>
quality favorably comparable to traditional,<br>
fixed-location CT machines which require patient<br>
transport.<br>
In essence, the new CT machine eliminates<br>
traditional transportation delays by allowing patients<br>
to be scanned in the emergency room, while remaining<br>
on their gurney.<br>
More particularly, with a conventional CT<br>
machine, the CT machine is fixed in place, typically<br>
in the radiology department. The patient is moved to<br>
the CT machine, placed on a precision-advancement<br>
patient platform and then, with the scanning apparatus<br>
remaining stationary, the patient is advanced into the<br>
scanning zone of the CT machine using the<br>
precision-advancement patient platform. In contrast,<br>
with new CT machine of the present invention, the<br>
patient remains in the emergency room on their gurney,<br>
the CT machine is moved to the patient and then, while<br>
the patient remains stationary, the CT machine is<br>
precision-advanced relative to the patient so that the<br>
scanning zone of the CT machine moves relative to the<br>
patient. Thus, the new CT machine of the present<br>
invention can be wheeled into position in an emergency<br>
room and the patient scanned while remaining on their<br>
gurney, without ever having to move the patient from<br>
the emergency room to the radiology department, and<br>
then off the gurney and onto the moving platform of a<br>
traditional, fixed-location CT machine.<br>
As a consequence of this novel approach to CT<br>
scanning, the new CT machine requires a<br>
precision-advancement mechanism for moving the entire<br>
CT machine relative to the patient during the scanning<br>
process.<br>
To this end, the present invention provides a<br>
novel centipede belt drive which provides high<br>
precision movement of the CT machine relative to the<br>
patient during scanning. In particular, the centipede<br>
belt drive is designed to provide substantially the<br>
same degree of precision when moving the CT machine<br>
about the patient as conventional CT machines provide<br>
when moving the precision-advancement patient platform<br>
relative to the fixed scanning zone of the<br>
conventional CT machine.<br>
Preferably the novel CT machine comprises two<br>
transport mechanisms: one for moving the CT machine<br>
relatively quickly across room distances prior to<br>
scanning, and one for moving the CT machine precisely<br>
relative to the patient during scanning.<br>
In one preferred form of the invention, there is<br>
provided an anatomical imaging system comprising:<br>
a CT machine; and<br>
a transport mechanism mounted to the base of the<br>
CT machine, wherein the transport mechanism comprises<br>
a fine movement mechanism for moving the CT machine<br>
precisely, relative to the patient, during scanning.<br>
In another preferred form of the invention, there<br>
is provided an anatomical imaging system comprising:<br>

the CT machine relatively quickly across room<br>
distances; and<br>

machine precisely, relative to the patient, during<br>
scanning.<br>

Detailed Description Of The Preferred Embodiments<br>
CT Machine 5<br>
Looking first at Figs. 1-6, there is shown a<br>
novel CT machine 5 formed in accordance with the<br>
present invention. CT machine 5 generally comprises a<br>
base 10 which supports a torus 15. Torus 15 defines a<br>
center opening 20. Base 10 and torus 15 together<br>
comprise the CT scanning apparatus which is used to<br>
scan the patient anatomy positioned in center opening<br>
20. Such scanning apparatus typically comprises a<br>
rotating X-ray source and X-ray detector, and various<br>
electronic hardware and software for controlling the<br>
apparatus and processing the acquired data so as to<br>
generate the CT scans. Such scanning apparatus may be<br>
of the sort well known in the art.<br>
CT machine 5 also comprises the novel transport<br>
mechanism 100 which will hereinafter be discussed.<br>
Transport Mechanism 100<br>
As noted above, CT machine 5 is intended to be<br>
moved to the patient, and then scan the patient while<br>
the patient remains stationary on their gurney.<br>
To this end, in one preferred form of the<br>
invention, and looking now at Fig. 7, CT machine 5<br>
preferably comprises a transport mechanism 100 which<br>
comprises two different mechanisms for moving CT<br>
machine 5: (i) a gross movement mechanism 105 for<br>
transporting CT machine 5 quickly across significant<br>
distances (e.g., across a room to the patient); and<br>
(ii) a fine movement mechanism 110 for moving CT<br>
machine 5 precisely across small distances (e.g.,<br>
relative to the patient during scanning). As will<br>
hereinafter be discussed, fine movement mechanism 110<br>
preferably comprises the aforementioned centipede belt<br>
drive for precisely moving the CT machine relative to<br>
the patient during scanning.<br>
As seen in Figs. 8-10, gross movement mechanism<br>
105 and fine movement mechanism 110 are both secured<br>
to the _frame 115 of base 10 so that they can,<br>
alternatively, support CT machine 5.<br>
Gross Movement Mechanism 105<br>
Gross movement mechanism 105 is used to transport<br>
CT machine 5 quickly across significant distances<br>
(e.g., across a room to the patient). More<br>
particularly, and looking now at Figs. 8-14, gross<br>
movement mechanism 105 preferably comprises two<br>
identical, spaced-apart caster units 117 which<br>
cooperate to form the gross movement mechanism 105.<br>
Each caster unit 117 comprises a chassis 120<br>
having a pair of casters 125 rotatably mounted<br>
thereto. Chassis 120 is movably mounted to a support<br>
block 130, and support block 130 is in turn secured to<br>
frame 115. More particularly, chassis 120 is movably<br>
mounted to support block 130 by means of a pair of<br>
slide rods 135 and support block 130 are slidably<br>
received in slide housings 140 which are secured to<br>
support block 130. An actuator (hydraulic or<br>
otherwise) 145, which is mounted to support block 130,<br>
has its actuator rod 150 engaging chassis 120. As<br>
noted above, support block 130 is secured to frame 115<br>
of CT machine 5.<br>
As a result of this construction, when it is<br>
desired to move CT machine 5 about on gross movement<br>
mechanism 105, gross movement mechanism 105 is<br>
operated as follows. The two caster units 117 are<br>
operated in a coordinated fashion so that their<br>
actuators (hydraulic or otherwise) 145 extend their<br>
actuator rods 150 so as to cause chassis 120 to<br>
project downward from support blocks 130, whereby to<br>
cause the casters 125 to engage the floor and support<br>
CT machine 5 on the casters 125. CT machine 5 can<br>
then be maneuvered about a room on the casters 125.<br>
When it is desired to use the CT machine 5 for<br>
scanning, the gross movement mechanism 105 is operated<br>
as follows. The two caster units 117 are operated in<br>
a coordinated fashion so that their actuators<br>
(hydraulic or otherwise) 145 retract their actuator<br>
rods 150 so as to cause chassis 120 to return towards<br>
support blocks 130, whereby to seat fine movement<br>
mechanism 110 of CT machine 5 securely on the floor.<br>
In one configuration, gross movement mechanism<br>
105 comprises two identical caster units 117, with one<br>
caster unit 117 located on each side of the patient.<br>
Alternatively, more than two caster units 117 may be<br>
provided (e.g., three or four), and they may be<br>
distributed about base 10 of CT machine 5 in any<br>
desired configuration.<br>
Fine Movement Mechanism 110<br>
Fine movement mechanism 110 is used to move CT<br>
machine 5 precisely relative to the patient during<br>
scanning. More particularly, and looking now at Figs.<br>
7 and 9, fine movement mechanism 110 preferably<br>
comprises two identical, spaced-apart centipede belt<br>
drive units 153 which cooperate to form the fine<br>
movement mechanism 110.<br>
Looking next at Figs. 15-25, each centipede belt<br>
drive unit 153 comprises a chassis 155 which is<br>
secured to frame 115. Chassis 155 preferably<br>
comprises two halves (Fig. 18) which are secured<br>
together to form a single housing with an interior<br>
space. Chassis 155 has a belt 160 drivably mounted<br>
thereto. More particularly, chassis 155 comprises a<br>
pair of drive gears (sometimes referred to as a timing<br>
pulley) 165 which are rotatably mounted to chassis<br>
155. Drive gears 165 comprise teeth 170 which engage<br>
counterpart ribs (not shown) formed on the interior of<br>
belt 160, such that when drive gears 165 are rotated,<br>
their rotational motion is transferred to belt 160.<br>
Preferably teeth 170 have an arched configuration, so<br>
as to provide a uniform engagement between adjacent<br>
teeth and the drive belt, thereby allowing precision<br>
transfer of motion between the drive gear and the<br>
drive belt. One or more motors 175 are secured to<br>
chassis 155. Preferably motors 175 are located inside<br>
the centipede belt drive unit to save space. A<br>
transmission belt 180 connects the drive shaft of<br>
motor 175 to at least one of the drive gears 165,<br>
whereby the one or more motors 175 can be used to turn<br>
belt 160 and thereby drive the unit.<br>
A suspension unit 185, such as the one shown in<br>
Figs. 18-25, or another suspension unit of the sort<br>
well known in the belt drive art, is preferably<br>
secured to chassis 155 within the interior of belt 160<br>
so as to distribute the load of CT machine 5 across a<br>
plurality of rollers and onto the belt 160. In one<br>
preferred construction, suspension unit 185 comprises<br>
(Figs. 21-25) a pair of roller assemblies 190 balanced<br>
with a pair of rockers 195 which are mounted on an<br>
axle 200 and balanced with four springs 205.<br>
Additional suspension rollers (e.g., rollers 210 in<br>
Figs. 18-20) may also be provided if desired.<br>
As a result of this construction, when it is<br>
desired to move CT machine 5 on fine movement<br>
mechanism 110, CT machine 5 is lowered onto fine<br>
movement mechanism 105 (i.e., by retracting the<br>
casters 125 of gross movement mechanism 105), and then<br>
fine movement mechanism 110 is operated as follows.<br>
The two centipede belt drive units 153 are operated in<br>
a coordinated fashion so that their motors 175 rotate<br>
drive gears 165, whereby to turn belts 160 and thereby<br>
precisely advance CT machine 5 (e.g., relative to a<br>
patient).<br>
The centipede belt drive unit 153 is designed to<br>
move the CT machine relative to the patient in one of<br>
two motions: (I) indexed movement using discrete<br>
steps for slice scanning; and (2) smooth movement<br>
using substantially continuous motion for helical<br>
scanning. The centipede belt drive unit 153 achieves<br>
this through the use of the aforementioned<br>
floor-engaging drive belts 160 which provide the<br>
necessary precision movement and repeatability<br>
The centipede belt drive system is preferably<br>
configured to allow multi-directional patient<br>
scanning, i.e., scanning in both forward and backward<br>
directions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, two<br>
independent centipede belt drive units 153 are used,<br>
one on each side of the patient. The two centipede<br>
belt drive units are driven in a coordinated fashion<br>
so as to effect the precise movement desired. In this<br>
respect it should be appreciated that, due to the use<br>
of two independent belt drives, differences in<br>
components or external conditions (e.g., floor tilt)<br>
may create a yawing effect. This is resolved by<br>
driving each belt separately at an appropriate rate.<br>
A feedback system is preferably used to ensure<br>
that each centipede belt drive unit 153 is moving at<br>
the desired speed. An encoder device (e.g., an<br>
optical encoder or a rotary potentiometer or other<br>
device) may be used to determine the rate of drive<br>
gear movement so as to regulate belt movement. In<br>
this respect it should be appreciated that, in view of<br>
the very small movements associated with CT scanning,<br>
hysteresis problems may arise with the drive belts<br>
160. The encoder device may also be used to identify<br>
and compensate for any such hysteresis.<br>
In one configuration, the fine movement mechanism<br>
105 comprises two identical centipede belt drive units<br>
153, with the two identical drives straddling the<br>
patient. Alternatively, the CT machine could be<br>
provided with wheels on each side of the patient, and<br>
a single centipede belt drive unit 153 could be<br>
provided to move the wheeled assembly during scanning<br>
movement.<br>
Use<br>
In accordance with the present invention,<br>
transport mechanism 100 can be used to move CT machine<br>
5 as follows. Initially, CT machine 5 is raised on<br>
its gross movement mechanism 105 by causing actuators<br>
(hydraulic or otherwise) 145 to extend their actuator<br>
rods 150, whereby to cause casters 125 to engage the<br>
floor and support CT machine 5 on the casters 125. CT<br>
machine 5 can then be maneuvered about a room on its<br>
casters 125, i.e., so that a patient lying on a gurney<br>
may be positioned within the center opening 20 of CT<br>
machine 5 without moving the patient off the gurney.<br>
Thereafter, gross movement mechanism 105 is operated<br>
so that the caster units 117 retract their actuator<br>
rods 150 so as to cause chassis 120 to return towards<br>
their support blocks 130, whereby to permit the drive<br>
belts 160 of fine movement mechanism 110 to engage the<br>
floor. Thereafter, when scanning is commenced, motors<br>
175 are used to precisely advance belt 160, and hence<br>
CT machine 5, relative to the patient during scanning.<br>
Thus, in one preferred form of the invention, the<br>
fine movement mechanism 110 operates only during the<br>
scanning process. More particularly, prior to<br>
scanning, the CT machine is moved to the patient on<br>
gross movement mechanism 105; thereafter, the fine<br>
movement mechanism 105 engages the floor and operates<br>
during scanning to move the CT machine relative to the<br>
patient during the scanning process. Alternatively,<br>
where fine movement mechanism 110 is capable of<br>
reasonably rapid rates of speed, gross movement<br>
mechanism 105 may be omitted entirely and only fine<br>
movement mechanism 110 provided.<br>
Application To Other Types Of Scanning Systems<br>
It should be appreciated that the present<br>
invention is not limited to use in medical<br>
applications or, indeed, to use with CT machines.<br>
Thus, for example, the present invention may be used<br>
in connection with CT machines used for non-medical<br>
applications, e.g., with CT machines used to scan<br>
inanimate objects. Furthermore, the present invention<br>
may be used with non-CT-type scanning systems. In<br>
essence, the present invention has application to any<br>
scanning device which requires that the scanning<br>
apparatus be precisely moved relative to the scanned<br>
object. Thus, for example, the present invention may<br>
be used in conjunction with other types of scanners.<br>
