The invention relates to a process for preparing a carbon black having at least one organic group such as herein described grafted thereto. The process involves reacting a diazonium salt with a carbon black to yield a carbon black product having an organic group attached to the carbon black. The invention also relates to new carbon black products and their uses.<br>
Much effort has been expended over the several decades to modify the surface chemistry of carbon black. While it is possible to deposit physically adsorbed material onto the surface of carbon black, permanently changing the surface chemistry of carbon black is substantially more difficult.<br>
Some processes for chemically changing the surface of carbon black are known and used commercially. For example, it is well known that a carbon black surface can be oxidized with a variety of treating agents. Surface oxidation is used to make some commercial products. Sulfonation using sulfuric acid or chlorosulfuric acid and halogenation of a carbon black surface are also known. Some known methods for grafting polymers to the carbon black surface are reviewed by<br><br>
Tsubakowa in Polym. Sci., Vol. 17, pp 417-470, 1992.  See also United States Patent No. 4,014,844 which grafts polymers' onto carbon black by contacting the carbon black with the polymer and heating.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,479,300 describes carbon catalyst compositions and a process for their production. The catalyst compositions are prepared by treating carbon particles with an alkali or alkaline earth metal and subsequently treating the resulting carbon/metal composition with a solvating ether. The carbon portions of the catalytic compositions can be reacted with various reagents, including organic compounds, to produce carbon compositions.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,043,708 describes modified carbon blacks having hydrocarbon groups chemically attached to the surface of the carbon black.- The modified carbon blacks are prepared by reacting carbon black with an alkylating agent in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts type reaction catalyst. The hydrocarbon groups which reportedly can attach to the surface of the carbon black include aliphatic and aromatic groups. A modified carbon black containing aryl groups attached to the surface of a carbon black is reported as being preparable by reacting a halogenated carbon black with an aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts type catalyst. United States Patent No. 3,025,259 describes rubber compositions containing<br><br>
the modified carbon blacks of United States Patent No. 3,043,708.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,335,020 describes modified carbon blacks where the carbon black is treated with benzene which is then polymerized on the carbon black.  To prepare these modified carbon blacks, benzene and carbon black are mixed with a Lewis Acid catalyst under anhydrous conditions for about ten minutes. The benzene on the carbon black is then polymerized to parapolyphenyl by means of a combination co-catalyst-oxidizing agent and is reportedly thereby bonded to the carbon black.<br>
United States Patent Nos. 2,502,254 and 2,514,236 describe the manufacture of pigments containing carbon black. United States Patent No. 2,502,254 reports that highly dispersed pigments suitable for mass pigmentation of viscose can be obtained by generating an azo pigment in the presence of carbon black.<br>
The pigment is produced by coupling a diazotized amine and another usual intermediate for a yellow, orange, or red pigment in the presence of carbon black in one or the other of the aqueous solutions of which the mixing brings about the coupling.  United States Patent No. 2,514,236 reports that this process can also prepare a chocolate brown pigment by coupling one molecular proportion of a tetrazotized benzidine<br><br>
with two molecular proportions of an arylmethyl pyrazolone in the presence of carbon black.<br>
PCT Patent Application No. WO 92/13983 describes a process for modifying the surfaces of carbon-containing materials by electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts. The process is reportedly applicable, in particular, to carbon plates and carbon fibers for composite materials. Carbon-containing materials modified by the process are also described.  Electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts containing functionalized aryl radicals to covalently modify carbon surfaces is also described in Delmar et al., J.  Am. Chem.   Soc.   1992, 114,   5883-5884.<br>
According to WO 92/13983, the process for modifying the surface of a carbon-containing material consists of grafting an aromatic group to the surface of this material by electrochemical reduction of a diazonium salt including this aromatic group.  The carbon-containing material is placed in contact with a diazonium salt solution in an aprotic solvent and is negatively charged with respect to an anode which is also in contact with the diazonium salt solution.  Use of a protic solvent is reported to prevent the electrochemical process from producing the intended product as a result of reducing the diazonium triple bond to yield a hydrazine.<br><br>
   Despite the technology discussed above, there remains a need to modify the surface chemistry of carbon black and impart desired properties to the carbon black.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention relates to processes for preparing a carbon black product having an organic group attached to the carbon black.  One process comprises the step of reacting at least one diazonium salt with a carbon black in the absence of an externally applied electric current sufficient to reduce the diazonium salt. Another process comprises the step of reacting at least one diazonium salt with a carbon black in a protic reaction medium.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention relate to novel carbon black products, which may be prepared according to a process of the invention.  The carbon black products may be used in the same applications as conventional carbon blacks. Such uses include, but are not limited to, plastic compositions, aqueous inks, aqueous coatings, rubber compositions, paper compositions, and textile compositions.<br>
The description which follows sets out additional features and advantages of the invention. These functions will be apparent from that description or may be learned by practice of the invention as described. The objectives and other advantages will be realized and attained by the<br><br>
processes, products, and compositions particularly pointed out in the description below and the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION Processes for Preparing a Carbon Black Product A first embodiment of the invention provides processes for preparing a carbon black product having an organic group attached to the carbon black.  One process involves the reaction of at least one diazonium salt with a carbon black in the absence of an externally applied current sufficient to reduce the diazonium salt. That is, the reaction between the diazonium salt and the carbon black proceeds without an external source of electrons sufficient to reduce the diazonium salt. Mixtures of different diazonium salts may be used in the process of the invention.  This" process can be carried out under a variety of reaction conditions and in any type of reaction medium, including both protic and aprotic solvent systems or slurries.<br>
In another process, at least one diazonium salt reacts with a carbon black in a protic reaction medium. Mixtures of different diazonium salts may be used in this process of the invention. This process can also be carried out under a variety of reaction conditions.<br>
Preferably, in both processes, the diazonium salt is formed in situ.     If desired, in either process, the carbon black product can be isolated and dried by means known in the<br><br>
art.  Furthermore, the resultant carbon black produdt can be treated to remove impurities by known techniques.  The various preferred embodiments of these processes are discussed below and are shown in the examples.<br>
Any carbon black may be used in the processes of this invention.  The resulting carbon black products are useful in applications known for conventional carbon blacks.  The properties of the carbon blacks are selected based upon the intended application. More importantly, the processes of this invention can be used to provide carbon black products having advantageous properties not associated with conventional carbon blacks.<br>
The processes of the invention can be carried out under a wide-variety of conditions and in general "are not limited by any particular condition.  The reaction conditions must be such that the particular diazonium salt is sufficiently stable to allow it to react with the carbon black.  Thus, the processes can be carried out under reaction conditions where the diazonium salt is short lived. As the examples below illustrate, the reaction between the diazonium salt and the carbon black occurs, for example, over a wide range of pH and temperature.  The processes can be carried out at acidic, neutral, and basic pH.  Preferably, the pH ranges from about 1 to 9.  The reaction temperature may preferably range from 0°C to 100°C.<br><br>
Diazonium salts, as known in the art, may be formed for example by the reaction of primary amines with aqueous solutions of nitrous acid. A general discussion of diazonium salts and methods for their preparation is found in Morrison and Boyd, Organic Chemistry, 5th Ed., pp. 973-983, (Allyn ?nd Bacon, Inc. 1987) and March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structures, 4th Ed., (Wiley, 1992). According to this invention, a diazonium salt is an organic compound having one or more diazonium groups.<br>
In the processes of the invention, the diazonium salt may be prepared prior to reaction with the carbon black or, more preferably, generated in situ  using techniques known in the art. In situ  generation also allows the use of unstable diazonium salts such as alkyl diazonium salts and avoids unnecessary handling or manipulation of the diazonium salt. In particularly preferred processes of this invention, both the nitrous acid and the diazonium salt are generated in situ.     Each of these variations is shown in the examples below.<br>
A diazonium salt, as is known in the art, may be generated by reacting a primary amine, a nitrite and an acid. The nitrite may be any metal nitrite, preferably lithium nitrite, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite, or zinc nitrite, or any organic nitrite such as for example isoamylnitrite or ethylnitrite. The acid may be any acid, inorganic or<br><br>
organic, which is effective in the generation of the diazonium salt.  Preferred acids include nitric acid, HN03, hydrochloric acid, HCl, and sulfuric acid, H2S04.<br>
i<br>
The diazonium salt may also be generated by reacting the primary amine with an aqueous solution of nitrogen dioxide.  The aqueous solution of nitrogen dioxide, N02/H20, provides the nitrous acid needed to generate the diazonium salt.<br>
Generating the diazonium salt in the presence of excess HCl may be less preferred than other alternatives because HCl is corrosive to stainless steel.  Generation of the diazonium salt with N02/H20 has the additional advantage of being less corrosive to stainless steel or other metals commonly used for reaction vessels.  Generation using H2S04/NaNO2 or HN03/NaN02 are also relatively non-corrosive.<br>
In general, generating a diazonium salt from a primary amine, a nitrite, and an acid requires two equivalents of acid based on the amount of amine used.  In an in situ process, the diazonium salt can be generated using one equivalent of the acid. When the primary amine contains a strong acid group, adding a separate acid may not be necessary in the processes of the invention. The acid group or groups of the primary amine can supply one or both of the needed equivalents of acid. When the primary amine contains a strong acid group, preferably either no additional acid or<br><br>
up to one equivalent of additional acid is added to a process of the invention to generate the diazonium salt in situ.    A slight excess of additional acid may be used.  One example of such a primary amine is para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (sulfanilic acid).  Others are shown in the examples below<br>
In general, diazonium salts are thermally unstable. They are typically prepared in solution at low temperatures, such as 0-5°C, and used without isolation of the salt. Heating solutions of some diazonium salts may liberate nitrogen and form either the corresponding alcohols in acidic media or the organic free radicals in basic media.<br>
However, to accomplish the process of the invention, the diazonium salt need only be sufficiently stable to allow * reaction with the carbon black.  Thus," the processes of the present invention can be carried out with some diazonium salts otherwise considered to be unstable and subject to decomposition.  Some decomposition processes may compete with the reaction between the carbon black and the diazonium salt and may reduce the total number of organic groups attached to the carbon black.  Further, the reaction may be carried out at elevated temperatures where many diazonium salts may be susceptible to decomposition.  Elevated temperatures may also advantageously increase the solubility of the diazonium salt in the reaction medium and improve its handling during the process.  However, elevated temperatures may result in some<br><br>
loss of the diazonium salt due to other decomposition processes.<br>
The processes of the invention can be accomplished by adding the reagents to form the diazonium salt in situ, to a suspension of carbon black in the reaction medium, for example,   water. Thus, a carbon black suspension to be used may already contain one or more reagents to generate the diazonium salt and the process of the invention accomplished by adding the remaining reagents.  Some permutations of such processes are shown in the examples below.<br>
Reactions to form a diazonium salt are compatible with a large variety of functional groups commonly found on organic compounds.  Thus, only the availability of a diazonium salt for reaction with a carbon black limits the processes of the invention.<br>
The processes of this invention can be carried out in any reaction medium which allows the reaction between the diazonium salt and the carbon black'to proceed.  Preferably, the reaction medium is a solvent-based system.  The solvent may be a protic solvent, an aprotic solvent, or a mixture of solvents.  Protic solvents are solvents, like water or methanol, containing a hydrogen attached to an oxygen or nitrogen and thus are sufficiently acidic to form hydrogen bonds. Aprotic solvents are solvents which do not contain an acidic hydrogen as defined above. Aprotic solvents include,<br><br>
for example, solvents such as hexanes, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile, and benzonitrile.  For a discussion of protic and aprotic solvents see Morrison and Boyd, Organic Chemistry, 5th Ed., pp. 228-231, (Allyn and Bacon, Inc. 1987).<br>
The processes of this invention are preferably carried out in a protic reaction medium, that is, in a protic solvent alone or a mixture of solvents which contains at least one protic solvent.  Preferred protic media include, but are not limited to water, aqueous media containing water and other solvents, alcohols, and any media containing an alcohol, or mixtures of such media.<br>
According to the processes of the invention, the reaction between a diazonium salt and a carbon black can take place with any type of carbon black, for example, in fluffy or pelleted form.  In one embodiment designed to reduce production costs, the reaction occurs during a process for forming carbon black pellets.  For example, a carbon black product of the invention can be prepared in a dry drum by spraying a solution or slurry of a diazonium salt onto a carbon black. Alternatively, the carbon black product can be prepared by pelletizing a carbon black in the presence of a solvent system, such as water, containing the diazonium salt or the reagents to generate the diazonium salt in situ. Aqueous solvent systems are preferred. Accordingly, another<br><br>
embodiment of the invention provides a process for forming a pelletized carbon black comprising the steps of: introducing a carbon black and an aqueous slurry or solution of a diazonium salt into a pelletizer, reacting the diazonium salt with the carbon black to attach an organic group to the carbon black, and pelletizing the resulting carbon black having an attached organic group.  The pelletized carbon black product may then be dried using conventional techniques.<br>
In general, the processes of the invention produce inorganic by-products, such as salts.  In some end uses, such as those discussed below, these by-products may be undesirable.  Several possible ways to produce a carbon black product according to a process "of the invention without unwanted inorganic by-products or salts are as follows:<br>
First, the diazonium salt can be purified before use by removing the unwanted inorganic by-product using means known in the art.  Second, the diazonium salt can be generated with the use of an organic nitrite as the diazotization agent yielding the corresponding alcohol rather than an inorganic salt.  Third, when the diazonium salt is generated from an amine having an acid group and aqueous N02, no inorganic salts are formed.  Other ways may be known to those of skill in the art.<br><br>
In addition to the inorganic by-products, a process of the invention may also produce organic by-products.  They can be removed, for example, by extraction with organic solvents. Other ways may be known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Carbon Black Products<br>
The reaction between a diazonium salt and a carbon black according to a process of this invention forms a carbon black product having an organic group attached to the carbon black.  The diazonium salt may contain the organic group to be attached to the carbon black.  Thus, the present invention relates to carbon black products having an organic group attached to the carbon black, particularly those prepared by a process of this invention.  It may be possible to produce the carbon black products of this invention by other means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The organic group may be an aliphatic group, a cyclic organic group, or an organic compound having an aliphatic portion and a cyclic portion.  As discussed above, the diazonium salt employed in the processes of the invention can be derived from a primary amine having one of these groups and being capable of forming, even transiently, a diazonium salt.  The organic group may be substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched. Aliphatic groups include, for example, groups derived from alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and<br><br>
carbohydrates.  Cyclic organic groups include', but"are not limited to, alicyclic hydrocarbon groups {for example, cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls), heterocyclic hydrocarbon groups {for example,   pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, and the like), aryl groups {for  example,   phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and the like), and heteroaryl groups (imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridinyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, furyl, indolyl, and the like).  As the steric hinderance of a substituted organic group increases, the number of organic groups attached to the carbon black from the reaction between the diazonium salt and the carbon black may be diminished. When the organic group is substituted, it may contain any functional group compatible with the formation of a diazonium salt.  Preferred functional groups include, but are not limited to, R, OR, COR, COOR, OCOR, carboxylate salts such as COOLi, COONa, COOK, COO~NR4+, halogen, CN, NR2, SO3H, sulfonate salts such as S03Li, S03Na, SO3K, S03~NR4+, OSO3H, 0S03~ salts, NR(COR), CONR2, N02, PO3H2/ phosphonate salts such as P03HNa and P03Na2, phosphate salts such as OP03KNa and 0P03Na2, N=NR, NR3+X", PR3+X", SkR, SSO3H, SSO3" salts, S02NRR', S02SR, SNRR', SNQ, S02NQ, C02NQ, S-(l,4-piperazinediyl)-SR, 2-(1,3-dithianyl) 2-(1,3-dithiolanyl), SOR, and S02R.  R and R', which can be the same or different, are independently hydrogen, branched or unbranched C]_-C2g substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated<br><br>
hydrocarbon, e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted alkylaryl, or substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl.  The integer k ranges from 1-8 and preferably from 2-4.  The anion X~ is a halide or an anion derived from a mineral or organic acid.  Q is (CK2)W, (CH2)xO(CH2)z, (CH2)XNR(CH2)Z, or (CH2)XS(CH2)z, where w is an integer from 2 to 6 and x and z are integers from 1 to 6.<br>
A preferred organic group is an aromatic group of the formula Ayr-, which corresponds to a primary amine of the formula AyA.rNH2.  In this formula, the variables have the following meanings:  Ar is an aromatic radical such as an aryl or heteroaryl group.  Preferably, Ar is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, biphenyl, pyridinyl, benzothiadiazolyl, and benzothiazolyl;  A is a substituent on the aromatic radical independently selected from a preferred functional group described above or A is a linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon radical (preferably containing 1 to 2 0 carbon atoms), unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of those functional groups; and y is an integer from 1 to the total number of -CH radicals in the aromatic radical.  For instance, y is an integer from 1 to 5 when Ar is phenyl, 1 to 7 when Ar is naphthyl, 1 to 9 when Ar is anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, or biphenyl, or 1 to 4 when Ar is pyridinyl.<br><br>
In the above formula, specific examples of R and R" are NH2-C6H4-, CH2CH2-C6H4-NH2, CH2-CgH4-NH2, and CgH5.<br>
Another preferred set of organic groups which may be attached to the carbon black are organic groups substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group as a functional group. An ionizable group is one which is capable of forming an ionic group in the medium of use.  The ionic group may be ?n anionic group or a cationic group and the ionizable group may form an anion or a cation.<br>
Ionizable functional groups forming anions include, for example, acidic groups or salts of acidic groups.  The organic groups, therefore, include groups derived from organic acids.  Preferably, when it contains an ionizable group forming an anion, such an organic group Has a) an aromatic group and b) at least one acidic group having a pKa of less than 11, or at least one salt of an acidic group having a pKa of less than 11, or a mixture of at least one acidic group having a pKa of less than 11 and at least one salt of an acidic group having a pKa of less than 11.  The pKa of the acidic group refers to the pKa of the organic group as a whole, not just the acidic substituent.  More preferably, the pKa is less than 10 and most preferably less than 9.  Preferably, the aromatic group of the organic group is directly attached to the carbon black.  The aromatic group may be further substituted or unsubstituted, for example,<br><br>
with alkyl groups.  More preferably, the organic group is a phenyl or a naphthyl group and the acidic group is a sulfonic acid group, a sulfinic acid group, a phosphonic acid group,<br>
i<br>
or a carboxylic acid group.  Examples of these acidic groups and their salts are discussed above.  Most preferably, the organic group is a substituted or unsubstituted sulfophenyl group or a salt thereof; a substituted or unsubstituted (polysulfo)phenyl group or a salt thereof; a substituted or unsubstituted sulfonaphthyl group or a salt thereof; or a substituted or unsubstituted (polysulfo)naphthyl group or a salt thereof.  A preferred substituted sulfophenyl group is hydroxysulfophenyl group or a salt thereof.<br>
Specific organic groups having an ionizable functional group forming an anion (and their corresponding primary* amines for use in a process according to the invention) are p-sulfophenyl (p-sulfanilic acid), 4-hydroxy-3-sulfophenyl (2-hydroxy-5-amino-benzenesulfonic acid), and 2-sulfoethyl (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid).  Other organic groups having ionizable functional groups forming anions are shown in the examples below.<br>
Amines represent examples of ionizable functional groups that form cationic groups.  For example, amines may be protonated to form ammonium groups in acidic media. Preferably, an organic group having an amine substituent has a pKb of less than 5.  Quaternary ammonium groups (-NR3+) and<br><br>
quaternary phosphonium groups (-PR3+) also represent examples of cationic groups.  Preferably, the organic group contains an aromatic group such as a phenyl or a naphthyl group and a quaternary ammonium or a quaternary phosphonium group.  The aromatic group is preferably directly attached to the carbon black.  Quaternized cyclic amines, and even quaternized aromatic amines, can also be used as the organic group. Thus, N-substituted pyridinium compounds, such as N-methyl-pyridyl, can be used in this regard.  Examples of organic groups include, but are not limited to, (C5H4N)C2H5+, C6H4(NC5H5)+, C6H4COCH2N(CH3)3+( C6H4COCH2(NC5H5)+, (C5H4N)CH3+, and C6H4CH2N(CH3)3+.<br>
An advantage of the carbon black products having an attached organic group substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group is that the carbon black product may have increased water dispersibility relative to the corresponding untreated carbon black.  As shown in the Examples, water dispersibility of a carbon black product increases with the number of organic groups attached to the carbon black having an ionizable group or the number of ionizable groups attached to a given organic group.  Thus, increasing the number of ionizable groups associated with the carbon black product should increase its water dispersibility and permits control of the water dispersibility to a desired level.  It can be noted that the water dispersibility of a carbon black product<br><br>
containing an amine as the organic group attached to the carbon black may be increased by acidifying the aqueous medium.<br>
Because the water dispersibility of the carbon black products depends to some extent on charge stabilization, it is preferable that the ionic strength of the aqueous medium be less than 0.1 molar. More preferably, the ionic strength is less than 0.01 molar.<br>
When such a water dispersible carbon black product is prepared by a process of the invention, it is preferred that the ionic or ionizable groups be ionized in the reaction medium.  The resulting product solution or slurry may be used as is or diluted prior to use.  Alternatively, the carbon black product may be dried by techniques used for conventional carbon blacks.  These techniques include, but are not limited to, drying in ovens and rotary kilns. Overdrying, however, may cause a loss in the degree of water dispersibility.<br>
In addition to their water dispersibility, carbon black products having an organic group substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group may also be dispersible in polar organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and formamide.  In alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, use of complexing agents such as crown ethers increases the dispersibility of carbon black products having an organic group containing a metal salt of an acidic group.<br><br>
Aromatic sulfides encompass another group of preferred organic groups. Carbon black products having aromatic sulfide groups are particularly useful in rubber compositions.  These aromatic sulfides can be represented by the formulas Ar(CH2)gSk(CH2)rAr' or A- (CH2)qSK(CH2) rAr" wherein Ar and Ar' are independently substituted or unsubstituted arylene or heteroarylene groups, Ar" is an aryl or heteroaryl group, k is 1 to 8 and q and r are 0-4. Substituted aryl groups would include substituted alkylaryl groups.  Preferred arylene groups include phenylene groups, particularly p-phenylene groups, or benzothiazolylene groups. Preferred aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl and benzothiazolyl. The number of sulfurs present, defined by k preferably ranges from 2 to 4.  Particularly preferred aromatic sulfide groups are bis-para-(CgH4)-S2-(CgH4)- and para-(CgH^)-S2-(CgHj).  The diazonium salts of these aromatic sulfide groups may be conveniently prepared from their corresponding primary amines, H2N-Ar-S^-Ar'-NH2 or H2N-Ar-Sjc-Ar".<br>
Another preferred set of organic groups which may be attached to the carbon black are organic groups having an aminophenyl, such as (CgH4)-NH2, (CgH4)-CH2-(CgH4)-NH2, (CgH4)-S02-(CgH4)-NH2.<br>
Uses of the Carbon Black Products<br>
The carbon black products of this invention may be used in the same applications as conventional carbon blacks. The organic groups attached to the carbon black, however, can be used to modify and improve the properties of a given carbon<br><br>
black for a particular use.  If desired these organic groups attached to the carbon black may also be chemically changed using means known in the art into other groups for a particular use. For example, an acid group can be converted to its salt or its amide.<br>
Carbon black products according to the invention have been prepared and evaluated in a number of end use applications.  These uses include, for example, plastic compositions, aqueous inks, aqueous coatings, rubber compositions, paper compositions and textile compositions.

The carbon black products of the invention may also be used in paper compositions.  Preferred carbon black products<br><br>
for this use are the water dispersible carbon black products discussed above. Accordingly, the invention relates to an improved paper product comprising paper pulp and a carbon black, the improvement comprising the use of a carbon black according to the invention.<br>
The carbon black products of the invention, either as a solid or a predispersion, can be incorporated into paper pulp using standard papermaking techniques as with conventional carbon blacks.  Use of a water dispersible carbon black product discussed above may provide a significant advantage and cost savings by reducing or eliminating the steps generally used to disperse other conventional carbon blacks. Example 100 shows a paper product using a carbon black product according to the invention".<br>
The paper products of the invention may incorporate other known paper additives such as sizing agents, retention aids, fixatives, fillers, defoamers, deflocculating agents, and the like. Advantageously, the water dispersible carbon black products discussed above are retained more efficiently at low loading levels when compared to the untreated carbon black when retention aids and acidic or alkaline sizing agents are used.<br>
The carbon black products of the invention may also be used, as with conventional carbon blacks, as pigments, fillers, and- reinforcing agents in the compounding and<br><br>
preparation of rubber compositions.  Accordingly, the invention relates to an improved rubber composition containing rubber and a carbon black, the improvement comprising the use of a carbon black product according to the invention.  The properties of the carbon black are important factors in determining the performance of the rubber composition containing a carbon black.<br>
Carbon blacks, for example, are useful in the preparation of rubber vulcanizates such as those in tires. It is generally desirable in the production of tires to utilize carbon blacks which produce tires with satisfactory abrasion resistance and hysteresis performance.  The treadwear properties of a tire are related to abrasion resistance. The greater the abrasion resistance, the greater the number of miles the tire will last without wearing out. The hysteresis of a rubber compound means the difference between the energy applied to deform a rubber compound, and the energy released as the rubber compound recovers to its initial undeformed state.  Tires with lower hysteresis values reduce rolling resistance and therefore are able to reduce the fuel consumption of the vehicle utilizing the tire. Thus, it is particularly desirable to have carbon black products capable of imparting greater abrasion resistance and lower hysteresis in tires.<br><br>
The carbon black products of this invention are useful in both natural and synthetic rubber compositions or mixtures of natural and synthetic rubbers.  Carbon black products containing aromatic sulfides as the organic group, which are discussed above, are prefered for this use.  Particularly preferred for use in rubber compositions are carbon black products having an attached aromatic sulfide organic group of the formula - (C6H4) -Sk- (C6H4) -, where k is an integer from 1 to 8, and more preferably where k ranges from 2 to 4.  The carbon black products of the invention can be used in rubber compositions which are sulfur-cured or peroxide-cured.<br>
The carbon black products may be mixed with natural or synthetic rubbers by normal means, for example by milling. Generally, amounts of the carbon black product ranging from about 10 to about 250 parts by weight can be used for each 100 parts by weight of rubber in order to impart a significant degree of reinforcement.  It is, however,<br>
i<br>
preferred to use amounts varying from about 20 to about 100 parts by weight of carbon black per 100 parts by weight of rubber and especially preferred is the utilization of from about 40 to about 80 parts of carbon black per 100 parts of rubber.<br>
Among the rubbers suitable for use with the present invention are natural rubber and its derivatives such as chlorinated rubber.  The carbon black products of the<br><br>
invention may also be used with synthetic rubbers such as: copolymers of from about 10 to about 70 percent by weight of styrene and from about 90 to about 30 percent by weight of butadiene such as copolymer of 19 parts styrene and 81 parts butadiene, a copolymer of 30 parts styrene and 70 parts butadiene, a copolymer of 43 parts styrene and 57 parts butadiene and a copolymer of 50 parts styrene and 50 parts butadiene; polymers and copolymers of conjugated dienes such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, and the like, and copolymers of such conjugated dienes with an ethylenic group-containing monomer copolymerizable therewith such as styrene, methyl styrene, chlorostyrene, acrylonitrile, 2-vinyl-pyridine, 5-methyl 2- vinylpyridine, 5-ethyl-2-vinylpyridine, 2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine, alkyl-substituted acrylates, vinyl ketone, methyl isopropenyl ketone, methyl vinyl either, alphamethylene carboxylic acids and the esters and amides thereof such as acrylic acid and dialkylacrylic acid amide; also suitable for use herein are copolymers of ethylene and other high alpha olefins such as propylene, butene-1 and pentene-1.<br>
The rubber compositions of the present invention can therefore contain an elastomer, curing agents, reinforcing filler, a coupling agent, and, optionally, various processing aids, oil extenders, and antidegradents.  In addition to the examples mentioned above, the elastomer can be, but is not<br><br>
limited to, polymers (e.g., homopolymers, copolymers, and terpolymers) manufactured from 1,3 butadiene, styrene, isoprene, isobutylene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3 butadiene, acrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, and the like.  It is preferred that these elastomers have a glass transition point (Tg), as measured by DSC, between<br>
-120°C and 0°C. Examples of such elastomers include poly(butadiene), poly(styrene-co-butadiene), and poly(isoprene).<br>
Advantageously, the carbon black products of the present invention can impart improved abrasion resistance and/or reduced hysteresis to rubber compositions containing them.  Examples 104-116 show the use of carbon black products of the invention in various rubber compositions and various properties of those compositions.<br>

The copending application No.l653/MAS/95 describes and claims "A process for preparing a carbon product having an organic group attached to carbon material".<br><br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate, not limit, the claimed invention. EXAMPLES Analytical Methods<br>
Unless otherwise specified, BET nitrogen surface areas obtained according to ASTM D-4820 are used for surface area measurements.  CTA3 areas and iodine numbers are used occasionaly and were obtained according to ASTM D-37 65 and D-1510, respectively. DBPA data were obtained according to ASTM D-2414.<br>
Volatile content was determined as follows-.  A carbon black sample was dried to constant weight at 125°C.  A 45 mL sample of the dry carbon black was placed in a covered 50 mL<br><br>
crucible that had been dried at 950oc and heated in a muffle furnace for 7 minutes at 950°C.  The volatile content is expressed as the percentage of weight lost by the carbon sample.<br>
The following procedure was used in various Examples below to determine the aqueous residue of carbon black products according to this invention and untreated carbon blacks. The carbon black product (5 g) was shaken with 45 g of water for 5 minutes. The resulting dispersion was poured through a screen and rinsed with water until the washings were colorless. A 325 mesh screen was used unless indicated otherwise. After drying the screen, the weight of residue on the screen was determined and expressed as a percentage of the carbon black product used in the test.<br>
For the Examples relating to rubber compositions, modulus, tensile strength, and elongation were determined according to ASTM D-412.  Shore A hardness was determined according to ASTM D-2240-86.<br>
The abrasion data on the rubber compositions were determined using an abrader which is based on a Lambourn type machine. Abrasion rates (cubic centimeter/centimeter travel) were measured at 14% and 21% slip.  The slip is based on the relative velocity between the sample wheel and grindstone. In the following examples, the abrasion index is the ratio of the abrasion rate of a control compositon divided by the<br><br>
abrasion rate of a rubber compostion prepared with a carbon<br>
black product of the invention.<br>
Tan 6 was measured with a Rheometrics Dynamic<br>
Spectrometer Model RDS-2 at a constant frequency cf 10 Hz, a<br>
constant temperature, and in the shear mode of strain.<br>
Strain sweeps were run from 0.2% to 120% DSA. Measurements<br>
were taken at five points per decade and the maximum Tan 6<br>
was reported.<br>
Bound rubber was determined as follows: A 0.5 g sample<br>
of an uncured rubber composition containing a rubber and a known amount of a carbon black was placed in a wire cage and submerged in toluene at room temperature. After standing for one day, the sample was placed in fresh toluene, and allowed to stand for three additional days at room temperature." The sample was then removed, dried in an oven, and weighed. The weight of the carbon black was subtracted from weight of the sample before and after toluene treatment to give a value for the amount of rubber in each sample. The weight of the sample after toluene treatment, adjusted for the weight of the carbon black and other insoluble ingredients in the composition, represents the amount of insoluble rubber remaining.  Bound rubber was expressed as the percentage of the weight of insoluble rubber in the sample after standing in toluene versus the amount of rubber in the original sample.<br><br>

Fifty grams of the fluffy carbon black were added to a solution of 8.83 g of sulfanilic acid dissolved in 420 g of water.  The resulting suspension was cooled to room temperature. Nitrogen dioxide (5.16 g) was dissolved in 30 g of ice cold water, and then added to the fluffy carbon black suspension over a period of several minutes and stirred rapidly, to produce 4-sulfobenzenediazonium inner salt in situ, which reacts with the fluffy carbon black.  The resulting dispersion was dried in an oven at 125°C, leaving only the carbon black product.  The carbon black product contained 1.94% sulfur after Soxhlet extraction with ethanol overnight, compared to 0.24% sulfur for the untreated carbon black.  This corresponds to attaching 52% of the p-C6H4S03-groups to the carbon black product.  Therefore, the<br><br>
carbon black product had 0.53 mmol/g of attached p-CgH4S03-groups.<br>

The carbon black product contained 1.97% sulfur after Soxhlet extraction with ethanol overnight, compared to 0.24% sulfur for the untreated fluffy carbon black.  This corresponds to attaching 53% of the p-C6H4S03- groups to the carbon black product.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.54 mmol/g of attached p-C6H4S03- groups.<br>
Example 10 Preparation of a carbon black product with an aliphatic<br>
diazonium salt This example shows another method for the preparation of a carbon black product of the present invention. A fluffy carbon black with a surface area of 230 m2/g and a DBPA of 70 ml/100 g was used.  Twenty grams of this black<br><br>
were added to a solution of 4.9 g of 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid in 180 g of-water.  Concentrated nitric acid (4.32 g) was -added.  A solution of 3.33 g of sodium nitrite in 15 g of water was added slowly with stirring, forming 2-sulfoethanediazonium nitrate in situ, which reacted with t.ie fluffy carbon black.

The resulting solution was added slowly to a cold (10oC), stirring suspension of 4.65 g of 4-aminophenyl disulfide in 100 g water.  The resulting solution of 4-diazophenyl disulfide dinitrate was added to a cold stirring suspension of 125 g of carbon black (iodine number of 120 mg/g and a DBPA of 125 ml/100 g) in 800 g cold (12-14°C) water. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days, and allowed to warm to room temperature in the process.  The resulting carbon black product was recovered by filtration and was dried. A sample of the carbon black product extracted with THF overnight had 1.81% sulfur, compared to 1.07% sulfur in the untreated carbon black<br><br>
product.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.12 mmol/g of attached dithiodi-4,1-phenylene groups.<br>
Example 85 Preparation of a carbon black product This example further illustrates the preparation of a carbon black product of the present invention.  The procedure of Example 80 was followed, except that a carbon black with an iodine number of 90 mg/g and a DBPA of 114 ml/100 g was used, and except that an additional 50 ml of water was used to form the aminophenyl disulfide dihydrochloride suspension. A sample of the resulting carbon black product that had been extracted overnight with THF and dried contained 2.12%^sulfur, compared to 1.45% for the untreated carbon black.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.10 mmol/g of attached dithiodi-4,1-phenylene groups.<br>

After stirring for two hours, the resulting carbon black product was filtered off, washed with ethanol, washed with water, and then dried in an oven at 125°C. A sample of the carbon black product that was subjected to Soxhlet extraction overnight with THF and dried had a sulfur content of 1.60%, compared to 1.08% for the untreated carbon black.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.081 mmol/g of attached dithiodi-4,1-(3-chlorophenylene) groups.<br>

1.4 L of water.  A solution of 5.28 g NaN02 in about 50 g water was added, forming 4-diazophenyl disulfide in situ, which reacted with the carbon black.  After stirring for two hours, the resulting carbon black product was removed by filtration, washed with ethanol, washed with water, and dried at about 125°C.  A sample of the carbon black product that had been subjected to Soxhlet extraction overnight with THF and dried contained 1.89 % sulfur, compared against 1.08 % for the untreated carbon black.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.13 mmol/g of attached dithiodi-4,1-phenylene groups.<br>

After mixing briefly, 150 g of water, 11.2 g of concentrated<br><br>
nitric acid, 30 g of water and a solution of 8.78 g of NaN02 in 35 g of water were added in succession with 15 seconds of mixing after each addition.  4-Sulfobenzenediazonium hydroxide inner salt was formed in situ and it reacted with the carbon black.  The resulting carbon black product was dried in an oven at 125°C. A dispersion of this carbon black product was prepared by dispersing it in water in a laboratory homogenizer for 30 seconds.<br>
A comparative dispersion was made by grinding 200 g of the same unreacted carbon black in a solution of 7 g of a lignosulfonate dipsersant, 5 ml concentrated NH4OH and 770 g water with grinding media in a ball mill for 4 hours, at which point a Hegman gauge reading of 7 was obtained. Penobscott bleached hardwood kraft pulp (160 g) and*St. Felician bleached softwood kraft pulp (240 g) were dispersed in water in a Cowles dissolver.  The stock solution was transferred into a TAPPI standard laboratory beater and diluted to a volume of 23 liters.  The stock solution was circulated in the beater for five minutes, and then placed under load and beaten for 50 minutes to a corrected Canadian Standard Freeness of 355 ml.<br>
Sufficient pulp to make three 2.75 g hand sheets was diluted to 3L, and the appropriate amount of carbon black dispersion was incorporated. A suspension was prepared for each carbon black loading level.  Each suspension was<br><br>
divided into three portions.  The first portion was used as is.  Rosin and alum were added to the second portion at the rates of 80 pounds and 60 pounds per bone dry ton, respectively.  HERCON 79 (AKD) size and BL 535 retention aid were added to the third portion at the rates of four pounds and three pounds per bone dry ton, respectively.  One 8" x 8" Noble &amp; Wood handsheet was made from each sample. The resulting handsheets were evaluated for TAPPI brightness using 45°/0° geometry.<br>

Examples 161-166<br>
These examples illustrate the use of the carbon black products of Examples 118, 121, 122 and the comparative Example 160 in two different rubber formulations.  The polymer was milled in a Brabender mixer for 1 minute at 100 °C. The carbon black product or comparative carbon black was added and mixed for 3 addiiional minutes or until a temperature of 160 °C was reached.  The mixture was then dumped and passed through an open mill 3 times.  After allowing the compound to stand at room temperature for 2 hours, it was transferred back into the Brabender and mixed for 1 minute at 100 °C.  After I minute, ZnO and stearic acid were added and mixed for 2 minutes and then Flexzone 7P antidegradent was added and mixed for an additional minute or until a temperature of 160 °C was reached.  The sample was then dumped, passed through an open mill 3 times and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours. The sample was placed back into the Brabender and mixed for 1 minute at 100 °C. The curatives were then added and mixed for 1 minute and<br><br>
the sample then dumped and passed through an open mill 3 times.  The formulations  ' used were selected from Table I.<br>
The data in Table 11 show that carbon black products of the present invention are useful in rubber formulations.  In the case where a blend of NS-116 and NS-114 was used, significant increases in 100% modulus, bound rubber, tensile strength, hardness and abrasion resistance can be obtained, as can significant decreases in Tan 6.  In Duradene 715, higher modulus, hardness, and bound rubber are obtained, while tensile strength, elongation at break and 70 °C Tan 6 are reduced.  The magnitude of the effect depends on the specific groups attached to the carbon black product.<br>
