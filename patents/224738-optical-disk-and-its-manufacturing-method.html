				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL DISK AND ITS MANUFACTURING METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an optical disk such as a Blu-ray disk (BD) or<br>
digital versatile disk (DVD) and manufacturing method of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Polycarbonate, epoxy resin and so forth have frequently been used as the substrate<br>
materials of conventional optical disks since these substrate materials are required to<br>
have low contents of extraneous materials and impurities, high permeability and low<br>
double refractive index to enable stable reading and writing, a low moisture absorption<br>
rate and superior heat resistance to prevent deformation of the optical disk, as well as<br>
high fluidity and superior mold release to facilitate molding processing (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 05-258349).<br>
However, since bisphenol A is used as monomer for the aforementioned<br>
polycarbonate and epoxy resin substrate materials, unreacted bisphenol A remained seven<br>
after polymerization. Due to the growing interest in environmental issues in recent<br>
years, materials containing bisphenol A have tended to be shunned, and studies have been<br>
conducted on substrate materials that do not contain bisphenol A.<br>
The use of glass has been considered for use as a substrate material since it does<br>
not contain bisphenol A and satisfactory optical characteristics in the form of high<br>
transmittance. However, glass substrates have problems in terms of strength in that they<br>
are unable to accommodate the pressure and stress during production and use due to<br><br>
limitations on disk thickness.<br>
Another problem with conventional optical disks is that, although silk screen<br>
printing has mainly been used in the case of printing characters or images on the surface,<br>
there is the problem of the difficulty in obtaining highly detailed images with silk screen<br>
printing.<br>
In addition, in the case of silk screen printing, in order to print serial numbers or<br>
other different characters and images for each disk, it is necessary to change the form<br>
plate each time, thereby resulting in the problem of being unable to in fact impart<br>
variable information by printing to conventional optical disks.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk, and<br>
manufacturing method of the same, which has performance equal to that of conventional<br>
optical disks and has a minimal effect on the environment during disposal.<br>
In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk on<br>
which highly detailed images are printed, and manufacturing method of an optical disk<br>
that enables highly detailed images to be printed inexpensively and impart variable<br>
information by printing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An optical disk of the present invention has a substrate included resin-impregnated<br>
paper in which a resin has been impregnated into paper or resin-coated paper in which<br>
the paper surface has been coated with a resin, and a recording layer provided on at least<br>
one side of the substrate. Since this type of optical disk uses resin-impregnated paper in<br>
which a resin has been impregnated into paper or resin-coated paper in which the paper<br>
surface has been coated with a resin for the substrate, it has a minimal effect on the<br>
environment during disposal while having performance equal to that of conventional<br><br>
optical disks.<br>
Here, the centerline average roughness Ra of at least one side of the substrate is<br>
preferably 0.5 ?m or less, and the maximum roughness Rmax is preferably 6.0 ?m or<br>
less.<br>
In addition, if a printing layer is additionally provided on the side opposite from<br>
the side of the substrate provided with the recording layer, then water absorption and<br>
moisture absorption of the substrate can be suppressed, and warping and other<br>
deformation of the optical disk can be suppressed.<br>
Similarly, if the aforementioned recording layer is provided on both sides of the<br>
substrate, then water absorption and moisture absorption of the substrate can be<br>
suppressed, and warping and other deformation of the optical disk can be suppressed.<br>
In addition, if the substrate additionally has a protective layer that protects the<br>
aforementioned recording layer, then together with preventing scratching of the recording<br>
layer, water absorption and moisture absorption of the substrate can be further suppressed,<br>
and warping and other deformation of the optical disk can be further suppressed.<br>
In addition, if the aforementioned recording layer has a recording layer base<br>
material that serves as a support for the recording layer, and that recording layer base<br>
material includes a non-hydrophilic film, then the water absorption and moisture<br>
absorption of the substrate can be further suppressed, and warping and other deformation<br>
of the optical disk can be further suppressed.<br>
In addition, if the aforementioned printing layer has a printing base material that<br>
serves as a support for the printing layer, and that printing base material includes a<br>
non-hydrophilic film, then the water absorption and moisture absorption of the substrate<br>
can be further suppressed, and warping and other deformation of the optical disk can be<br>
further suppressed.<br><br>
In addition, if a release layer is provided between the substrate and the recording<br>
layer and/or printing layer, since the substrate and recording layer and/or printing layer<br>
can be separated and disposed of separately at the time of disposal, each layer can be<br>
disposed of in accordance with the material of which it is made, thereby making it<br>
possible to further reduce the effect on the environment.<br>
In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention has a<br>
recording layer sheet fabrication step in which a recording layer sheet is fabricated by<br>
forming tracks on a recording layer base material; and, a recording layer sheet lamination<br>
step in which a recording layer included the recording layer sheet is provided on a<br>
substrate included resin-impregnated paper or resin-coated paper by laminating the<br>
recording layer sheet with resin-impregnated paper in which a resin is impregnated into<br>
paper or resin-coated paper in which the surface of the paper is coated with a resin.<br>
In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention also<br>
preferably has a printing sheet fabrication step in which a printing sheet is fabricated by<br>
carrying out printing on a printing base material; and, a printing sheet lamination step in<br>
which a printing layer included the printing sheet is provided on a substrate composed of<br>
resin-impregnated paper or resin-coated paper by laminating the printing sheet with<br>
resin-impregnated paper in which a resin is impregnated into paper or resin-coated paper<br>
in which the surface of the paper is coated with a resin.<br>
In addition, the manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention<br>
also preferably has a protective film lamination step in which a protective layer included<br>
a protective film is provided on the recording layer by laminating the protective film onto<br>
the recording layer.<br>
In addition, the manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention<br>
also preferably has a release layer formation step in which a release layer is formed on at<br><br>
least one side of the resin-impregnated paper or resin-coated paper in advance.<br>
In this type of the manufacturing method of an optical disk, since the substrate,<br>
recording layer and as necessary, printing layer and protective layer, are formed by<br>
prefabricating their corresponding sheets followed by their lamination, an optical disk<br>
having little substrate warping can be produced inexpensively.<br>
In addition, since the method has fabricating a printing sheet by carrying out<br>
printing on a printing base material in advance followed by laminating it to the substrate,<br>
highly detailed images can be obtained inexpensively. In addition, variable information,<br>
such as sequentially changing serial numbers, that differs for each disk can be imparted<br>
by printing onto the optical disk.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An optical disk of the present invention has a substrate composed of<br>
resin-impregnated paper in which a resin is impregnated into paper or resin-coated paper<br>
in which the surface of the paper is coated with a resin, a recording layer provided on at<br>
least one side of said substrate, and as necessary a printing layer or different recording<br>
layer on the side opposite from the side of the substrate provided with the recording layer,<br>
and additionally as necessary a release layer between the substrate and the recording<br>
layer.<br>
Specific examples of the layer composition of an optical disk of the present<br>
invention include: (1) recording layer/ substrate, (2) recording layer/substrate/pnnting<br>
layer, (3) recording layer/substrate/recording layer, (4) protective layer/recording,<br>
layer/substrate/printing layer, (5) protective layer/recording layer/substrate/protective,<br>
layer, (6) protective layer/recording layer/substrate/recording layer/protective layer, (7)<br>
protective layer/recording layer/ release layer/substrate/printing layer, (8) protective<br>
layer/ recording layer/release layer/substrate/release layer/ printing layer, and (9)<br>
protective layer/recording layer/ release layer/substrate/release layer/recording layer/<br>
protective layer. Here, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer for laminating each layer<br>
may be provided between each layer as necessary. In particular, that having a recording<br>
layer on one side of the substrate and a printing layer on the other side, or that having a<br>
recording layer on both sides of the substrate are preferable since the water absorption<br>
and moisture absorption of a substrate composed of resin-impregnated paper can be<br><br>
suppressed as a result of both sides of the substrate being covered.<br>
The following provides an explanation of an optical disk having the layer<br>
composition of (4) above with reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is schematic cross-sectional view showing an example of an optical disk of<br>
the present invention. This optical disk 10 is roughly composed of a substrate 11<br>
composed of resin-impregnated paper or resin-coated paper, a recording layer 13<br>
laminated on one side of substrate. 11 with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12<br>
interposed between, a printing layer 15 laminated on the other side of substrate 11 with a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 14 interposed between, and a protective layer 17<br>
laminated on recording layer 13 with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16 interposed<br>
between.<br><substrate><br>
Substrate 11 retains strength required for use as an optical disk, and is required to<br>
have rigidity, moisture resistance and water resistance. Consequently, in the present<br>
invention, resin-impregnated paper in which a resin is impregnated into paper or<br>
resin-coated paper in which the surface of the paper is coated with a resin is used for the<br>
substrate. Since the paper functions as a reinforcing material, resin-impregnated paper<br>
and resin-coated paper have adequate rigidity, and since the paper is impregnated with<br>
resin or the surface of the paper is coated with a resin, it has moisture resistance and<br>
water resistance, superior dimensional stability, little warping and satisfactory surface<br>
smoothness. In addition, since the material uses paper, it can be easily disposed of by<br>
incineration and so forth, and there is little effect on the environment at this time.<br>
(Resin-Impregnated Paper)<br>
There are no particular limitations on the paper of the resin-impregnated paper<br>
provided it is a paper that uses pulp. Examples of such paper include 100% virgin pulp<br><br>
paper, coated board paper containing used paper, and paper that has been clay-coated on<br>
one side. In addition, this paper may also be paper produced from wood chips instead<br>
of pulp, as well as paper produced from non-wood materials such as kenaf. Moreover,<br>
vulcanized fibers may also be used in which the pulp has been bound in gluey form with<br>
zinc chloride and so forth. The apparent specific gravity (basis weight) of these papers<br>
is preferably 20 to 600 g/m2 in consideration of the rigidity of the resin-impregnated<br>
paper, the ease of impregnation of resin into the paper.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the resin of the resin-impregnated paper<br>
provided it does not contain bisphenol A. Examples of such resins include urea<br>
formaldehyde resin; melamine resin; polyamide amine and its epichlorhydrin denatured<br>
form; latexes such as natural rubber latex and synthetic rubber latex (such as SBR, NBR,<br>
or polychloroprene); polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of vinyl chloride and other<br>
monomers; polyvinylidene chloride and copolymers of vinylidene chloride and other<br>
monomers; acrylic resin; polyester; and polyolefins such as polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene.<br>
In addition, the resin of the resin-impregnated paper may be a polyisocyanate resin<br>
obtained by impregnating polyisocyanate into paper and allowing the polyisocyanate to<br>
react with the moisture in the paper. Examples of polyisocyanates include aromatic<br>
diisocyanates such as phenylene diisocyanate (PDI), tolylene diisocyanate (TDI),<br>
naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), 4,4'-diisocyanate diphenylmethane (MDI), or<br>
tetramethylxylene diisocyanate; aromatic aliphatic diisocyanates such as xylylene<br>
diisocyanate (XDI); hydrogenated TDI, hydrogenated MDI, and hydrogenated XDI;<br>
aliphatic or alicyclic diisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) and<br>
isophorone diisocyanate and their polyol derivatives or their burette forms; trimers of the<br>
aforementioned diisocyanates; trifunctional isocyanates such as lysine triisocyanate (LTI)<br><br>
and triphenylmethane triisocyanate; and oligomers or polymers having an isocyanate<br>
group.<br>
In addition, the resin of the resin-impregnated paper may be a silane resin obtained<br>
by impregnating a silane coupling agent into paper and allowing the silane coupling<br>
agent to react with moisture in the paper in the presence of an acid catalyst. In addition,<br>
a polyol may be added to the silane coupling agent and the silane coupling agent may<br>
then be allowed to react therewith. Examples of silane coupling agents include ethyl<br>
trimethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, vinyl trimethoxysilane, ?-chloropropylmethyl<br>
dimethoxysilane, ?-chloropropyl trimethoxysilane, glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane,<br>
?-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane and ?-methacryloxy- propylmethyl<br>
dimethoxysilane. Examples of acid catalysts include hydrochloric acid. Examples of<br>
polyols include acrylic polyol.<br>
Examples of methods for impregnating resin into paper include a method in which<br>
paper is immersed in a resin solution or liquid resin; a method in which a resin solution<br>
or liquid resin is coated onto paper; a resin in which resin is mixed into pulp during paper<br>
production (internal addition); and a method in which resin is sprayed onto the pulp<br>
during paper production. Here, an organic solvent such as alcohol for preventing<br>
moisture absorption by the paper is preferable for the solvent of the resin solution. In<br>
addition, in the case of coating a resin solution or liquid resin onto paper, it is preferably<br>
coated onto both sides of the paper.<br>
The amount of resin impregnated (dry weight excluding organic solvent) is<br>
preferably 1 to 10% by mass, and more preferably 3 to 10% by mass, in the<br>
resin-impregnated paper (100% by mass) in consideration of the rigidity, productivity<br>
and ease of disposal of the resin-impregnated paper.<br>
Resin-impregnated paper can be obtained after impregnating resin into the paper<br><br>
by curing, drying or solidifying the resin as necessary.<br>
The thickness of resin-impregnated paper obtained in this manner is preferably 0.5<br>
to 1.6 mm in consideration of optical disk strength and optical disk specifications.<br>
(Resin-Coated Paper)<br>
Resin-coated paper is paper in which resin has been coated and/or laminated onto<br>
the paper surface. Examples of resin-coated paper include that in which a resin solution<br>
has been coated onto the paper surface, that in which a thermoplastic resin has been<br>
laminated onto the paper surface by a molten lamination method, that in which a UV<br>
(photo)-cured resin or electron beam (EB)-cured resin is coated onto the paper surface,<br>
that in which a resin film has been laminated onto the paper surface, and that in which a<br>
resin solution has been coated onto the paper surface and a resin film is additionally<br>
laminated thereon.<br>

it is paper that uses pulp. The same paper used for the resin-impregnated paper can be<br>
used for this type of paper.<br>

does not contain bisphenol A.<br>
Examples of resins of resin solutions for coating include urea formaldehyde resin,<br>
melamine resin, polyamide amine and its epichlorhydrin denatured form, latexes such as<br>
natural rubber latex and synthetic rubber latexes (such as SBR, NBR, or<br>
polychloroprene), polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and other monomers,<br>

Resin-coated paper can be obtained after coating and/or laminating resin onto the<br>
paper surface by curing, drying or solidifying the resin as necessary.<br>
The thickness of resin-coated paper obtained in this manner is preferably 0.5 to 1.6<br>
mm in consideration of optical disk strength and optical disk specifications.<br>
(Surface Smoothness)<br>
Substrate 11 is required to have surface smoothness in order to use as an optical<br>
disk. The centerline average roughness Ra (JIS B 0601) of at least one side of substrate<br>
11 is preferably 0.5 ?m or less, and the maximum roughness Rmax (JIS B 0601) is<br>
preferably 6.0 ?m or less. In addition, it is particularly preferable that the centerline<br>
average roughness Ra and maximum roughness Rmax of both sides of substrate 11 be<br>
within the aforementioned ranges.<br>
Examples of methods for imparting surface smoothness to substrate 11 include a<br>
method in which a resin film having superior smoothness is laminated on the surface of<br>
the paper, a method in which surface transfer of a material having superior surface<br>
smoothness (such as glass, film, ceramics or metal) is carried out after impregnating or<br>
coating resin onto the paper, and a method in which resin-impregnated paper or<br>
resin-coated paper is hot-pressed.<br>
(Peripheral Edge Protection)<br><br>
Deformation prevention effects can be maintained by protective treatment of the<br>
peripheral edges of substrate 11. The peripheral edges of substrate 11 are protected by<br>
resin coating or by attaching a resin cover. Examples of resins used in the case of resin<br>
coating include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, polyamide amine and its<br>
epichlorhydrin denatured form, latexes such as natural rubber latex and synthetic rubber<br>
latex such as SBR, NBR and polychloroprene, polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl<br>
chloride and other monomers, polyvinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinylidene<br>
chloride and other monomers, polyvinyl alcohol resin, polyacrylamide, acrylic resin,<br>

polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and other monomers,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinylidene chloride and other monomers,<br>
polystyrene, ABS plastic, methacrylic resin, epoxy resin, unsaturated polyester resin,<br>
phenol resin and melamine resin.<br><recording layer><br>
Recording layer 13 is a layer on which information is recorded and/or a layer on<br>
which information can be recorded, and is able to record and/or read information by<br>
being irradiated with light.<br>
Recording layer 13 includes that on which information has been recorded in<br>
advance at the time of optical disk production, and that on which information can be<br>
recorded after production, and is normally classified into one of three types consisting of:<br>
(1) that on which information is recorded in advance at the time of optical disk<br>
production but on which information cannot be recorded after production (playback-only<br>
type); (2) that on which information is not recorded at the time of optical disk production<br>
but on which information can be recorded after production (write-once type); and, (3)<br><br>
that from which recorded information can be erased and on which information can be<br>
re-recorded (rewritable type).<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of each type of recording layer.<br>
(Playback-Only Type)<br>
FIG 2 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of a playback-only type of<br>
recording layer. This recording layer 13 is roughly composed having a recording layer<br>
base material 31, an information pit forming layer 32 having irregularities in its surface<br>
formed on recording layer base material 31, and a light reflecting layer 33 that covers the<br>
surface irregularities of information pit forming layer 32, and the side having recording<br>
layer base material 31 contacts a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 (not shown), while<br>
the side having light reflecting layer 33 contacts a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16.<br>
Recording layer base material 31 serves as a support of recording layer 13. A<br>
resin film is normally used for recording layer base material 31. There are no particular<br>
limitations on the resin film provided it is a film composed of a resin mat does not<br>
contain bisphenol A. The resin film is preferably a non-hydrophilic film in<br>
consideration of suppressing the water absorption and moisture absorption of substrate<br>
11.<br>
Preferable examples of a non-hydrophilic film in particular include polyolefin<br>
films composed of low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene<br>
(LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene, non-crystalline cyclic<br>
polyolefins, tetracyclododecene polymers or cycloolefin polymers in consideration of<br>
enabling disposal by incineration and minimal effects on the environment as a result of<br>
being decomposed into water and carbon dioxide by incineration.<br>
In addition, a biodegradable resin film is preferable for the non-hydrophilic film in<br>
consideration of minimal effects on the environment as a result of being decomposed by<br><br>
microbes in the soil and so forth even if disposed directly. Polylactic acid resin, for<br>
example, can be used as a biodegradable resin. Examples of polylactic acid resins<br>
include "Ecoloju" manufactured by Mitsubishi Plastics Inc.. "Terramac" manufactured by<br>
Unitika, Ltd., and "Palgreen LC" manufactured by Tohcello Co., Ltd. In addition,<br>
copolymer polyesters of polyvalent alcohols such as 1,4-butadiol and pentaerythritol,<br>
and succinic acid or adipic acid, for example, can also be used as biodegradable resins.<br>
Examples of this type of biodegradable polyester resins include "Biomax" manufactured<br>
by DuPont and "Bionolle" manufactured by Showa High Polymer Co., Ltd.<br>
The thickness of the resin film is preferably 30 urn or more in consideration of<br>
maintaining the strength of a support.<br>
Information pit forming layer 32 has irregularities in its surface, and tracks and<br>
information pits are represented by these surface irregularities. Information pit forming<br>
layer 32 is the result of curing an ultraviolet-cured resin in which a photoinitiator is<br>
combined with an oligomer or monomer such as urethane acrylate oligomer, polyester<br>
acrylate oligomer or low-viscosity acrylic monomer; and curing an electron beam-cured<br>
resin such as urethane-denatured acrylate resin and acrylic-denatured polyester resin.<br>
However, it is preferable not to use an epoxy resin that contains bisphenol A.<br>
The thickness of information pit forming layer 32 is normally 20 to 80 ran.<br>
Light reflecting layer 33 is provided along the surface irregularities of information<br>
pit forming layer 32 and reflects irradiated light. Light reflecting layer 33 is a thin film<br>
composed of a metal such as aluminum, aluminum alloy, silver or silver alloy formed by,<br>
for example, vacuum deposition or sputtering.<br>
The thickness of light reflecting layer 33 is normally 10 to 100 nrn, and the<br>
thickness is preferably uniform.<br>
(Write-Once Type)<br><br>
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of a write-once type of<br>
recording layer. This recording layer 13 is roughly composed having a recording layer<br>
base material 41, an information track forming layer 42 having irregularities in its surface<br>
formed on the surface of recording layer base material 41, a light reflecting layer 43 that<br>
covers the surface irregularities of information track forming layer 42, and information<br>
pit recording layer 44 formed on the surface of light reflecting layer 43, and the side of<br>
recording layer base material 41 contacts a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 (not<br>
shown), while the side of information pit recording layer 44 contacts a pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive layer 16.<br>
Recording layer base material 41 serves as a support of recording layer 13. The<br>
same resin films as the aforementioned recording layer base material 31 can be used for<br>
recording layer base material 41.<br>
Information track forming layer 42 has irregularities in its surface having a depth<br>
of 50 to 110 nm, and tracks are represented by these surface irregularities. However,<br>
differing from a playback-only type, information pits are not formed. A cured<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin or electron beam-cured resin can be used in the same manner as<br>
the aforementioned information pit forming layer 32 for information track forming layer<br>
42.<br>
Light reflecting layer 43 is provided along the surface irregularities of information<br>
track forming layer 42, and reflects irradiated light. Light reflecting layer 43 is a metal<br>
thin film formed by vacuum deposition or sputtering in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned light reflecting layer 33.<br>
Information pit recording layer 44 is a colored film composed of, for example, an<br>
organic pigment, and as a result of being irradiated with laser light for information<br>
recording, this portion becomes information pits where information signals are recorded<br><br>
as a result of undergoing a physical change (destruction) following the occurrence of a<br>
change in the molecular structure of organic pigment at the irradiated site. Since the<br>
site where the physical change has occurred decreases in optical transmittance, when<br>
irradiated with light for reading, the amount of reflected light from light reflecting layer<br>
43 decreases, and as a result, information signals can be detected in the same manner as<br>
in the case of surface irregularity pits being formed.<br>
Examples of organic pigments include phthalocyanine pigment, naphthalocyanine<br>
pigment, and naphthoquinone pigment.<br>
The thickness of information pit recording layer 44 is normally 50 to 200 nm.<br>
(Rewritable Type)<br>
FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of a rewritable type of<br>
recording layer. This recording layer 13 is roughly composed having a recording layer<br>
base material 51, an information track forming layer 52 having irregularities in its surface<br>
formed on the surface of recording layer base material 51, a light reflecting layer 53 that<br>
covers the surface irregularities of information track forming layer 52, and an<br>
information pit forming layer 54 formed on the surface of light reflecting layer 53, and<br>
the side of recording layer base material 51 contacts a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer<br>
12 (not shown), while the side of information pit recording layer 54 contacts a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16.<br>
Recording layer base material 51 serves as a support of recording layer 13. The<br>
same resin films as the aforementioned recording layer base material 31 can be used for<br>
recording layer base material 51.<br>
Information track forming layer 52 has irregularities in its surface having a depth<br>
of 50 to 110 nm, and tracks are represented by these surface irregularities. However,<br>
differing from a playback-only type, information pits are not formed. A cured<br><br>
ultraviolet-cured resin or electron beam-cured resin can be used in the same manner as<br>
the aforementioned information pit forming layer 32 for information track forming layer<br>
52.<br>
Light reflecting layer 53 is provided along the surface irregularities of information<br>
track forming layer 52, and reflects irradiated light. Light reflecting layer 53 is a metal<br>
thin film formed by vacuum deposition or sputtering in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned light reflecting layer 33.<br>
Information pit recording layer 54 is a transparent dielectric film composed of<br>
three layers consisting of, for example, an SiO2 film, GeSbTe film and SiO2 film, and the<br>
information pit recording layer shown in the drawing has a bilayer structure laminated in<br>
the order of SiO2 film 61, GeSbTe film 62, SiO2 film 63, GeSbTe film 64 and SiO2 film<br>
65.<br>
The recording, erasure and reading of information by information pit recording<br>
layer 54 is carried out in the manner described below.<br>
Laser light is focused on a GeSbTe layer to heat this layer followed by rapid<br>
cooling to record information by polycrystallizing or decrystallizing the GeSbTe film.<br>
Laser light that is weak enough not to affect the GeSbTe film is irradiated, the laser light<br>
penetrates the polycrystallized or decrystallized GeSbTe film, and the light reflected by<br>
the light reflecting layer is received allowing information to be read depending on<br>
whether or not there is crystallization of the GeSbTe film. On the other hand,<br>
information is erased by crystallizing the GeSbTe film as a result of focusing laser light<br>
of a lower intensity onto a polycrystallized or decrystallized GeSbTe film to slowly heat<br>
the film. This recording and erasure is reversible, and different information can again<br>
be recorded after a recording has been erased.<br>
A ZnS-SiO2 film, Ta2O5 film, SiN film or A1N film can be used instead of an SiO2<br><br>
film. In addition, an AgInSbTe film can be used instead of a GeSbTe film.<br>
Each of these films can be formed by sputtering, vacuum deposition and so forth.<br>
The thickness of each film is roughly 10 to 300 nm, and should be suitably set<br>
according to the type and number of layers. For example, the thickness of each film of<br>
information pit recording layer 54 is 220 nm for the SiO2 film, 13 nm for the GeSbTe<br>
film, 25 nm for the SiO2 film, 40 nm for the GeSbTe film and 95 nm for the SiO2 film in<br>
that order.<br><printing layer><br>
Printing layer 15 is formed by printing by printing ink 22 on printing base material<br>
21. Here, although printing is carried out on the side of pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
layer 14, namely the back side of printing base material 21, this is preferable since in<br>
addition to being able to protect the printed surface composed of printing ink 22, unique<br>
images having both luster and depth can be obtained.<br>
A resin film is normally used for printing base material 21. There are no<br>
particular limitations on the resin film provided it is a film that does not contain<br>
bisphenol A. A non-hydrophilic film is preferable for the resin film since it suppresses<br>
water absorption and moisture absorption of substrate 11.<br>
Preferable examples of a non-hydrophilic film in particular include polyolefin<br>
films in consideration of enabling disposal by incineration and minimal effects on the<br>
environment as a result of being decomposed into water and carbon dioxide by<br>
incineration. In addition, a biodegradable resin film is preferable for the<br>
non-hydrophilic film in consideration of minimal effects on the environment as a result<br>
of being decomposed by microbes in the soil and so forth even if disposed of directly.<br>
The same films as those used in the aforementioned recording layer base material<br>
31 can be used for the polyolefin film and biodegradable resin film.<br><br>
The thickness of printing base material 21 is normally 12 to 80 ?m.<br>
There are no particular limitations on printing ink 22 provided it does not contain<br>
bisphenol A. An example of printing ink 22 is a printing ink having a biodegradable<br>
resin such as polylactic acid resin as a binder while also containing various types of<br>
additives in consideration of minimal effects on the environment during disposal.<br>
Examples of additives include coloring pigments, pigment dispersants and viscosity<br>
adjusters.<br>
Examples of characters and images formed by printing include markings that at<br>
least indicate the type of optical disk, additional information relating to the optical disk<br>
(such as manufacturer, retailer, price, storage capacity and usage precautions), and<br>
full-color decorative images having intermediate gradations (such as images of the<br>
recorded information). In addition, an area enabling the writing of additional<br>
information with a pencil, ballpoint pen or ink jet printer and so forth may also be<br>
provided.<br><protective layer><br>
Protective layer 17 protects the surface of recording layer 13 and prevents damage<br>
to the recording layer. In addition, protective layer 17 also fulfills the role of<br>
suppressing water absorption and moisture absorption of substrate 11.<br>
Since it is necessary for protective layer 17 to allow light irradiated onto the optical<br>
disk to penetrate to recording layer 13, it is preferably a resin film having high optical<br>
transmittance. In addition, preferable examples of resin films include polyolefin films<br>
and biodegradable resin films in consideration of minimal effects on the environment<br>
during disposal.<br>
The same films used for the aforementioned recording layer base material 31 can<br>
be used for the polyolefin film and biodegradable resin film.<br><br>
The thickness of protective layer 17 is normally 0.03 to 1.0 mm, and preferably 0.1<br>
to 0.6 mm.<br>
Furthermore, protective layer 17 may be composed by directly coating a liquid<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin, electron beam-cured resin, and so forth onto recording layer 13 by<br>
spin coating without using a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16 to be described later,<br>
followed by the curing thereof.<br><pressure-sensitive adhesive layers><br>
Pressure-sensitive adhesive layers 12, 14 and 16 are for laminating each layer, and<br>
are layers composed of a pressure-sensitive adhesive. Acrylic pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesives and other known pressure-sensitive adhesives can be used for the<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive.<br>
The amount of pressure-sensitive adhesive should be suitably determined<br>
according to the material of each layer to be laminated. It is preferable that<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 laminated between substrate 11 and recording layer<br>
13 have a smooth surface on the side of recording layer 13.<br><release layers><br>
As shown in FIG 5, an optical disk of the present invention may be an optical disk<br>
20 in which release layers 18 and 19 are provided between substrate 11 and recording<br>
layer 13 and between substrate 11 and printing layer 15 for separation of each layer<br>
during disposal.<br>
Release layers 18 and 19 are preferably made of materials having low levels of<br>
surface activity, examples of which include polyolefins such as polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene.<br>
The thickness of release layers 18 and 19 is normally 5 ?m to 1 mm.<br><optical disk production process><br><br>
The following provides an explanation of a process for producing an optical disk<br>
of the present invention.<br>
An optical disk production process of the present invention is a process for<br>
producing an optical disk consisting of producing a printing layer, substrate, recording<br>
layer and protective layer separately with each sheet-like member wound as shown in<br>
FIG. 6, coating a pressure-sensitive adhesive in a predetermined order in the final step,<br>
and then pressing and laminating them together to obtain the desired layer composition<br>
followed by punching out into the shape of a disk.<br>
The following provides an explanation of an example of a production process of<br>
optical disk 20 having the layer composition shown in FIG. 5.<br>
A printing sheet is fabricated in advance by printing onto printing base material 21<br>
(printing sheet fabrication step), release layers 18 and 19 are formed on both sides of<br>
resin-impregnated paper (release layer formation step), and a recording layer sheet is<br>
fabricated by forming tracks on recording layer base material 31 (41 or 51) (recording<br>
layer sheet fabrication step). Next, a printing layer 15 composed of the printing sheet is<br>
provided on substrate 11 composed of resin-impregnated paper by laminating<br>
resin-impregnated paper and the aforementioned printing sheet (printing sheet lamination<br>
step), recording layer 13 composed of the printing layer sheet is provided on substrate 11<br>
composed of resin-impregnated paper by laminating resin-impregnated paper and the<br>
aforementioned recording layer sheet (recording layer sheet lamination step), and<br>
protective layer 17 composed of a protective film is provided on recording layer 13 by<br>
laminating a protective film on recording layer 13 (protective film lamination step) to<br>
form a roll having the desired layer composition followed by punching out said roll into<br>
the shape of disks to produce optical disk 20.<br><printing sheet fabrication step><br><br>
A printing sheet is fabricated by carrying out printing by printing ink 22 on<br>
printing base material 21 according to the step shown in FIG. 7A followed by winding<br>
onto a roller. At this time, positioning patterns are printed onto the printing sheet as<br>
shown in FIG. 6.<br>
Examples of printing methods include offset printing, gravure printing, relief<br>
printing, screen printing, ink jet printing and electrophotography. Offset printing or<br>
gravure printing is particularly preferable in the case of full-color printing having<br>
intermediate gradations since these methods allow the obtaining of high-definition<br>
images. In addition, ink jet printing or electrophotography is preferable in the case of<br>
imparting variable information that differs for each disk.<br><release layer formation step><br>
Release layers 18 and 19 are formed in advance on resin-impregnated paper<br>
serving as substrate 11 by molten extrusion coating of a polyolefin such as polyethylene<br>
onto both of its sides according to the step shown in FIG 7(b). The resin-impregnated<br>
paper on which release layers 18 and 19 are formed (to also be referred to as a substrate<br>
sheet) is wound into the shape of a roll.<br><recording layer sheet fabrication step><br>
A recording layer sheet is fabricated by forming tracks on recording layer base<br>
material 31 (41 or 51), forming various layers respectively corresponding to a<br>
playback-only type, write-once type or rewritable type, and winding into the shape of a<br>
roll according to the step shown in FIG 7(c). At this time, positioning patterns<br>
(surface irregularities and so forth) are formed in the printing layer sheet as shown in FIG.<br>
6.<br>
(Playback-Only Type)<br>
First, an ultraviolet-cured resin is coated onto recording layer base material 31, and<br><br>
a transfer mold having surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information pits<br>
is pressed against its surface to transfer the surface irregularities to the surface of the<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin (embossing processing). Next, the ultraviolet-cured resin is<br>
cured by irradiating with ultraviolet light to form information pit forming layer 32. At<br>
this time, by using a transfer mold having a diffraction grating pattern or hologram<br>
pattern in addition to the surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information<br>
pits for the transfer mold, an anti-theft or other pattern can also be formed on information<br>
pit forming layer 32.<br>
Next, light reflecting layer 33 composed of a metal thin film is formed on<br>
information pit forming layer 32 by vacuum deposition or sputtering.<br>
(Write-Once Type)<br>
The formation of information track forming layer 42 and light reflecting layer 43 is<br>
carried out in the same manner as information pit forming layer 32 and light reflecting<br>
layer 33 of the playback-only type. However, a transfer mold that does not have surface<br>
irregularities corresponding to information pits is used for the transfer mold.<br>
Next, an organic pigment is coated onto light reflecting layer 43 to form<br>
information pit recording layer 44 composed of an organic pigment colored film.<br>
Examples of coating methods include gravure coating, microgravure coating, die coating,<br>
comma coating, air knife coating and roll coating.<br>
(Rewritable Type)<br>
The formation of information track forming layer 52 and light reflecting layer 53 is<br>
carried out in the same manner as the write-once type.<br>
Next, SiO2 film 61, GeSbTe film 62, SiO2 film 63, GeSbTe film 64 and SiO2 film<br>
65 are sequentially formed on light reflecting layer 53 by sputtering or vacuum<br>
deposition.<br><br><lamination steps><br>
As shown in FIG 8, a pressure-sensitive adhesive is first coated on the printed side<br>
of a printing sheet, and this is laminated with a substrate sheet (resin-impregnated paper<br>
on which a release layer is formed).<br>
Next, a pressure-sensitive adhesive is coated onto a recording layer sheet and this<br>
is laminated onto the other side of the substrate sheet to which the printing sheet has been<br>
laminated. At this time, the printing sheet and recording layer sheet are positioned by<br>
reading the positioning patterns on the printing sheet and the positioning patterns on the<br>
recording layer sheet with a position reading sensor.<br>
Next, a pressure-sensitive adhesive is coated onto a protective sheet, and this is<br>
laminated onto recording layer 13 on the substrate sheet to form an optical disk roll.<br><punching step><br>
Next, the optical disk-shaped processed portions of the roll are synchronized with a<br>
disk-shaped cutting blade by reading the positioning patterns with a sampling position<br>
reading sensor, and then roll is punched out in the shape of disks with the disk-shaped<br>
cutting blade to obtain optical disks.<br>
Optical disks obtained in this manner can be deformed depending on the material<br>
of each layer. Accordingly, in order to ensure smoothness, a step may be inserted in<br>
which warping of the roll is removed by heating the optical disks from both sides with a<br>
flat heating plate.<br>
In addition, the shape of the peripheral edges of the optical disks can be changed in<br>
order to sustain the effect of preventing changes caused by environmental changes. The<br>
peripheral edge of an optical disk is formed to be curved so that the protective layer and<br>
so forth covers the peripheral edge of substrate 11 within a range that does not affect the<br>
recording area of the recording layer. The formation of this curvature can be carried out<br><br>
by a method such as using a disk-shaped cutting blade that is able to curve the peripheral<br>
edge when punching out the optical disk from the roll, or by a method in which the<br>
periphery of the optical disk is pressed to form a curve after being punched out. As a<br>
result of forming this curvature, the area over which the peripheral edge of substrate 11<br>
contacts the outside air can be reduced along the peripheral edge of the optical disk,<br>
thereby making it possible to further sustain the effect of preventing deformation of the<br>
optical disk.<br>
In an optical disk of the present invention as has been explained above, since<br>
resin-impregnated paper or resin-coated paper is used for substrate 11, it can be disposed<br>
of easily by incineration or burying underground, and there is only a minimal effect on<br>
the environment at that time. In addition, in an optical disk of the present invention,<br>
since resin- impregnated paper or resin-coated paper is used for substrate 11, the optical<br>
disk has the required strength for use as an optical disk as a result of the paper<br>
functioning as a reinforcing material, and since the paper is in the state of being<br>
impregnated with resin or the surface of the paper is in the state of being coated with<br>
resin, it is resistant to absorption of water and moisture, has superior dimensional<br>
stability and demonstrates little warping.<br>
In addition, since printing layer 12 is additionally provided on the side of substrate<br>
11 opposite from the side on which recording layer 13 is provided, both sides of substrate<br>
11 are covered, thereby making it possible to further suppress water absorption and<br>
moisture absorption by substrate 11, as well as further suppress warping and other<br>
deformation of the optical disk.<br>
Action similar to this is also demonstrated even in the case recording layer 13 is<br>
provided on both sides of the substrate.<br>
In addition, since protective layer 17 that protects recording layer 13 is additionally<br><br>
provided, together with preventing recording layer 13 from being damaged, water<br>
absorption and moisture absorption by substrate 11 can be further suppressed, thereby<br>
making it possible to further suppress warping and other deformation of the optical disk.<br>
In addition, if recording layer 13 has a recording layer base material 31 (41 or 51)<br>
composed of a non-hydrophilic film, water absorption and moisture absorption of<br>
substrate 11 can be further suppressed, thereby making it possible to further suppress<br>
warping and other deformation of the optical disk.<br>
In addition, if printing layer 15 is provided with printing base material 21<br>
composed of a non-hydrophilic film, then the water absorption and moisture absorption<br>
of substrate 11 can be further suppressed, thereby making it possible to further suppress<br>
warping and other deformation of the optical disk.<br>
In addition, since release layers 18 and 19 are provided between substrate 11 and<br>
recording layer 13 and between substrate 11 and printing layer 15, substrate 11, recording<br>
layer 13 and printing layer 15 can be separated at the time of disposal and disposed of<br>
separately, thereby enabling disposal corresponding to the material of each layer and<br>
making it possible for further reduce the effects on the environment.<br>
In addition, in an optical disk production process of the present invention, since<br>
substrate 11, recording layer 13, printing layer 15 and protective layer 17 are formed by<br>
fabricating their corresponding sheets in advance followed by laminating those sheets,<br>
differing from coating by spin coating and so forth, there is less material waste, and<br>
differing from the case of preliminarily laminating each layer that composes printing<br>
layer 13, recording layer 15 and protective layer 17 on a substrate in order, an optical<br>
disk having little warping of substrate 11 can be produced inexpensively without being<br>
subjected to stress caused by differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion.<br>
In addition, since a method is employed in which printing is carried out in advance<br><br>
on printing base material 21 to fabricate a printing sheet followed by laminating this onto<br>
substrate 11, high-definition printing can be carried out, and highly detailed images can<br>
be obtained inexpensively. In addition, serial numbers and other variable information<br>
that differs for each disk can be printed onto an optical disk in the aforementioned<br>
printing sheet fabrication step.<br>
Furthermore, an optical disk of the present invention is not limited to that<br>
described in the aforementioned embodiments, but rather the design and so forth may be<br>
altered within a range that does not deviate from the gist of the present invention.<br>
For example, an optical disk of the present invention is not limited to a disk shape,<br>
but may be rectangular or any other arbitrary shape provided the region where<br>
information is recorded is circular.<br>
In addition, although a pressure-sensitive adhesive is used when laminating each<br>
layer in the aforementioned embodiments, an adhesive layer, adhesive material, or a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive material in which a pressure-sensitive adhesive or adhesive<br>
has been formed into the shape of a sheet may also be used for the pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive.<br>
In addition, in the aforementioned optical disk production example, although the<br>
substrate sheet was wound into a roll, in the case of being wound into a roll, there are<br>
cases in which warping occurs in the substrate and the optical disk becomes susceptible<br>
to deformation. Accordingly, the substrate sheet may also be in the form of a flat sheet<br>
free of curling instead of a wound roll.<br>
Examples<br>
The following indicates examples of the present invention.<br>
[Example 1]<br><br>
(Fabrication of Printing Sheet)<br>
Gravure printing was carried out using biodegradable polyester printing ink<br>
(Dainichiseika Color and Chemicals, Biotech Color HGP) on a polylactic acid film<br>
drawn to a thickness of 0.04 mm (Mitsubishi Plastics, Ecoloju) to obtain a printing sheet<br>
on which was printed markings indicating the type of optical disk, additional information<br>
relating to the optical disk, decorative images and so forth.<br>
(Fabrication of Substrate Sheet)<br>
Polyethylene was molten extrusion coated onto both sides of resin-impregnated<br>
paper having a thickness of 1.0 mm (Hokuetsu Paper Mills, water-resistant vulcanized<br>
fiber) followed by preliminarily forming a release layer having a thickness of 0.015 mm.<br>
(Fabrication of Recording Layer Sheet)<br>
Surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information pits were transferred<br>
to a copper-plated roll after which the roll was chrome-plated from above to obtain a<br>
transfer mold.<br>
An ultraviolet-cured resin was coated onto a high-density polyethylene film drawn<br>
to a thickness of 0.05 mm with a die coater to a thickness of 0.1 mm, and the transfer<br>
mold was pressed against its surface to transfer the surface irregularities to the surface of<br>
the ultraviolet-cured resin.<br>
Next, the ultraviolet-cured resin was irradiated with ultraviolet light to cure the<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin and form tracks.<br>
Next, aluminum was vacuum deposited on the tracks and a light reflecting layer<br>
having a thickness of 60 nm was formed to obtain a playback-only type of recording<br>
layer sheet.<br>
(Lamination)<br>
An acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive was coated onto the printed surface of the<br><br>
printing sheet to a thickness of 0.005 mm by microgravure coating after which it was<br>
laminated with the substrate sheet.<br>
Next, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive was coated on the recording layer<br>
sheet to a thickness of 0.005 mm by microgravure coating after which it was laminated<br>
onto the other side of the substrate sheet to which the printing sheet had been laminated.<br>
Next, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive was coated onto a protective sheet<br>
(high-density polyethylene film drawn to a thickness of 0.065 mm) to a thickness of<br>
0.005 mm by microgravure coating after which it was laminated onto the substrate sheet<br>
to obtain an optical disk roll.<br>
(Punching)<br>
Next, the optical disk roll was punched into the shape of disks using a disk-shaped<br>
cutting blade to obtain optical disks. The optical disks were subsequently placed<br>
between flat plates followed by the application of heat at 50° for 24 hours to remove any<br>
warping and obtain smooth optical disks.<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
When information recorded on the resulting optical disks was read using an optical<br>
disk drive manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd. (product name: DDU-1000), the<br>
information was able to be read without problem.<br>
In addition, the substrate (+ release layer), recording layer (+ pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive layer + protective layer) and printing layer (+ pressure-sensitive adhesive layer)<br>
were able to be separated, and the substrate and printing layer were able to be disposed of<br>
by burying underground. The protective layer was able to be further separated from the<br>
recording layer (+ pressure-sensitive adhesive layer + protective layer), and the<br>
protective layer was able to be disposed of by burying underground. The metal thin<br>
film component was recovered from the recording layer.<br><br>
[Example 2]<br>
With the exception of changing the fabrication of the recording layer sheet as<br>
described below, optical disks were obtained in the same manner as Example 1.<br>
(Fabrication of Recording Layer Sheet)<br>
Surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information pits were transferred<br>
to a copper-plated roll after which the roll was chrome-plated from above to obtain a<br>
transfer mold.<br>
An ultraviolet-cured resin was coated onto a high-density polyethylene film drawn<br>
to a thickness of 0.05 mm with a die coater to a thickness of 0.1 mm, and the transfer<br>
mold was pressed against its surface to transfer the surface irregularities to the surface of<br>
the ultraviolet-cured resin.<br>
Next, the ultraviolet-cured resin was irradiated with ultraviolet light to cure the<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin and form tracks.<br>
Next, aluminum was vacuum deposited on the tracks and a light reflecting layer<br>
having a thickness of 60 nm was formed.<br>
Next, a cyanine pigment was coated onto the light reflecting layer by microgravure<br>
coating to form a colored film having a thickness of 60 nm and obtain a write-once type<br>
of recording layer sheet.<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
When information was recorded (writing) and information recorded on the<br>
resulting optical disks was read using an optical disk drive manufactured by Pulstec<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd. (product name: DDU-1000), the information was able to be recorded<br>
and read without problem.<br>
In addition, the substrate (+ release layer), recording layer (+ pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive layer + protective layer) and printing layer (+ pressure-sensitive adhesive layer)<br><br>
were able to be separated, and the substrate and printing layer were able to be disposed of<br>
by burying underground. The protective layer was able to be further separated from the<br>
recording layer (+ pressure-sensitive adhesive layer + protective layer), and the<br>
protective layer was able to be disposed of by burying underground. The metal thin<br>
film component was recovered from the recording layer.<br>
[Example 3]<br>
With the exception of changing the fabrication of the recording layer sheet as<br>
described below, optical disks were obtained in the same manner as Example 1.<br>
(Fabrication of Recording Layer Sheet)<br>
Surface irregularities corresponding to tracks were transferred to a copper-plated<br>
roll after which the roll was chrome-plated from above to obtain a transfer mold.<br>
An ultraviolet-cured resin was coated onto a high-density polyethylene film drawn<br>
to a thickness of 0.05 mm with a die coater to a thickness of 0.1 mm, and the transfer<br>
mold was pressed against its surface to transfer the surface irregularities to the surface of<br>
the ultraviolet-cured resin.<br>
Next, the ultraviolet-cured resin was irradiated with ultraviolet light to cure the<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin and form tracks.<br>
Next, aluminum was vacuum deposited on the tracks and a light reflecting layer<br>
having a thickness of 60 nm was formed.<br>
Next, an SiO2 film having a thickness of 220 nm, a GeSbTe film having a thickness<br>
of 13 nm, an SiO2 film having a thickness of 25 nm, a GeSbTe film having a thickness of<br>
40 nm and an SiO2 film having a thickness of 95 nm were sequentially formed by<br>
sputtering on the light reflecting layer to obtain a rewritable type of recording layer sheet.<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
When information was recorded (writing), information recorded on the resulting<br><br>
optical disks was read, the recorded information was erased and information was then<br>
rewritten using an optical disk drive manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd.<br>
(product name: DDU-1000), the information was able to be recorded, read, erased and<br>
rewritten without problem.<br>
In addition, the substrate (+ release layer), recording layer (+ pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive layer + protective layer) and printing layer (+ pressure-sensitive adhesive layer)<br>
were able to be separated, and the substrate and printing layer were able to be disposed of<br>
by burying underground. The protective layer was able to be further separated from the<br>
recording layer (+ pressure-sensitive adhesive layer + protective layer), and the<br>
protective layer was able to be disposed of by burying underground. The metal thin<br>
film component was recovered from the recording layer.<br>
[Example 4]<br>
An optical disk 70 was fabricated having a substrate 74, in which resin films 73<br>
were laminated onto both sides of paper 71 with adhesive layers 72 interposed between, a<br>
recording layer 75 laminated onto one side of substrate 74 with a pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive layer (not shown) interposed between, a protective layer 76 laminated onto<br>
recording layer 75 with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (not shown) interposed<br>
between, and a protective layer 77 laminated onto the other side of substrate 74 with a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer (not shown) interposed between as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of this optical disk 70.<br>

Adhesive layers composed of a pressure-sensitive adhesive were provided on both<br>
sides of paper having a thickness of 0.6 mm followed by the lamination of a resin film<br>
thereon having a thickness of 0.18 mm to fabricate a substrate sheet having a thickness of<br>
1.1 mm.<br><br>
(Fabrication of Recording Layer Sheet)<br>
Surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information pits were transferred<br>
to a copper-plated roll after which the roll was chrome-plated from above to obtain a<br>
transfer mold.<br>
An ultraviolet-cured resin was coated onto a high-density polyethylene film drawn<br>
to a thickness of 0.05 mm with a die coater to a thickness of 0.1 mm, and the transfer<br>
mold was pressed against its surface to transfer the surface irregularities to the surface of<br>
the ultraviolet-cured resin.<br>
Next, the ultraviolet-cured resin was irradiated with ultraviolet light to cure the<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin and form tracks.<br>
Next, aluminum was vacuum deposited on the tracks and a light reflecting layer<br>
having a thickness of 60 nm was formed to obtain a playback-only type of recording<br>
layer sheet.<br>
(Lamination)<br>
An acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive was coated onto the recording layer sheet to<br>
a thickness of 0.005 mm by microgravure coating after which it was laminated onto the<br>
other side of the substrate sheet to which a printing sheet had been laminated.<br>
Next, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive was coated onto a protective sheet<br>
(high-density polyethylene film drawn to a thickness of 0.065 mm) to a thickness of<br>
0.005 mm by microgravure coating after which it was laminated onto the recording layer<br>
of the substrate sheet.<br>
Moreover, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive was coated onto a protective<br>
sheet (high-density polyethylene film drawn to a thickness of 0.065 mm) to a thickness<br>
of 0.005 mm by microgravure coating after which it was laminated onto the back of the<br>
substrate sheet to obtain an optical disk roll.<br><br>
(Punching)<br>
Next, the optical disk roll was punched into the shape of disks using a disk-shaped<br>
cutting blade to obtain optical disks. The optical disks were subsequently placed<br>
between flat plates followed by the application of heat at 50° for 24 hours to remove any<br>
warping and obtain smooth optical disks.<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
When information recorded on the resulting optical disks was read using an optical<br>
disk drive manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd. (product name: DDU-1000), the<br>
information was able to be read without problem.<br>
