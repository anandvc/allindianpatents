				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved oxy-gas burner for heating of newly lined vessels and ladles,  and scraps,in relatively small-size electric arc furnaces as used in steel plants.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to an oxy-gas burner which is  capable of producing a relatively long and wide flame of temperature upto 2000°C with coke oven gas and upto 2600°C with natural gas at a high safety margin during application under critical, environment of high temperature and pressure,  at a reduced fuel consumption and pollution of environment by releass of unburnt fuel gases from the burner.<br>
The conventional oxy-gas burners comprise basically a central tube for supplying the fuel gases to the burner and one or more concentric outer tubes for supplying oxygen to the burner through the annular space between the outer tube or tubes and the central tube,<br>
The main drawback of the conventional oxy-gas burners is that the central tube used for supplying gases,  outer concentric tube or tubes for supplying oxygen,   other internal parts and  outside wall of these burners are not adequately cooled during applications of the burners, causing damage of the burner tip by the high-current arcs of     electric arc furnaces  or by the high pressure atmosphere generated inside the vessels or reactors in which these burners  are introduced during operation,  and also of the burner tubes or gas/oxygen feeding hoses by the backward travelling flame entering into the  inadequately cooled burners during idle period of the burners.<br>
-     2    -<br><br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved oxy-gas burner in which the gas and oxygen feeding tubes and  also the outside surface of the burner wall are cooled sufficiently for overcoming the said drawback of the conventional oxy-gas burners,<br>
 The other objective  is  to  provide an  oxy-gas burner of higher fuel  efficiency,   and longer, wider and hotter flame generating capability with reduced  pollution of  environment and probability of being damaged during its operation compared  with the conventional oxy-gas burners.<br>
The main constructional feature which distinguishes the invented burner from the conventional burners is  that a plurality of relatively small diameter tubes  are provided  in separate positions  around  a central relatively large diameter tube,for feeding  oxygen at the burner exit in the invented burner,  whereas one or more outer tubes of diameter larger than that  of the central tube are   provided  concentrically with the latter In the conventional burners for supplying oxygen at the burner exit through the. annular space between the said tubes.<br>
The  use  of multiple,  dispersedly located,   tubes  of relatively small diameter assists  on the one hand the supply of oxygen in separate  streams  of high velocity round the gas stream supplied through the central large diameter tube to cause thorough mixing of  oxygen with the gas and hence complete combustion of the gas  and  also generation of a long and wide flame of high temperature;   and  on the other hand  allows  a<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
relatively rapid cooling of the burner tip and outside surfaces of said multiple small diameter oxygen supplying tubes and the central large diameter gas feeding tube,  the  said surfaces being in direct contact with the cooling water circulated in the invented burner.<br>
Thus the  invention provides an improved oxy-gas burner which is durable and capable of producing a relatively long,  wide and hot flame at a reduced consumption of fuel gas and reduced pollution of environment caused by discharge of unburnt fuel gas, comprising a celntral tube for feeding gas,  an outermost tube,  a plate at the top end,  a copper tip at the bottom end,  characterised in that a plurality of relatively small diameter tubes,  such as, of outer diameter 26.7 mm and wall thickness 3•9 mm for feeding oxygen and a plurality of relatively small diameter tubes,  such as, of outer diameter 13.6 mm and wall thickness 1.8 mm for circulating cooling water are dispersedly located in the annular space between the said central tube and outermost tube,  and that said annular space is divided into an upper chamber for holding inlet cooling water,  an intermediate chamber for holding  inlet oxygen and a lower chamber for holding outlet cooling water,  by means of two plates disposed across the burner internal space.<br>
The invention is now described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to a particular embodiment the oxy-gas burner as illustrated in the accompanying drawings,  in which<br>
Figure 1a is the longitudinal sectional view of the burner;<br>
Figure 1b is the bottom view of the burner; and<br>
.    4    -<br><br>
Figure  1c is  the bottom view at  Section B-B of the burner.<br>
Referring to  Figs.   1a,   1b and  1c,  the "burner comprises a centrally located tube  (1) for feeding fuel gases received through gas  inlet   (1A)   provided  at  the top end   (1B);   a plurality<br>
of tubes   (4),   preferably eight  in number,   of relatively small<br>
* diameter,^'dispersedly located  around the central tube  (1) with<br>
 their axes lying along a circle,  concentric with tube  (1), preferably at an  equal angular separation of 45° from the adjacent ones,  for supplying  oxygen  received through inlet (4A);   inlet tube   (7A)  and outlet tube   (7B)  supplying cooling water for the burner;  tubes   (5),  typically four in number, distributed preferably at  an equal angular separation of  90° from the  adjacent ones,  with their axes lying on  a circle, concentric with tube   (1),   for circulating cooling water inside the burner.     Two circular metal  plates   (8 and  9),   each of preferred thickness 5 mm are provided across the burner to divide the burner internal space into three separate chambers (6A,  6B and 6C)  of which the upper chamber (6A) is  for holding the inlet cooling water,  the lower chamber (6C)  is for holding the outlet cooling water and the intermediate chamber (6B) is for holding the  oxygen supplied  through oxygen  inlet tube   (4A). Copper tip  (2) having  eight oxygen  outlet inclined holes   (2B) and   a central gas  outlet hole   (2C)   is  fitted to form exit end   (2A)  of the burner.    Typical height of copper tip  (2) is 20 mm.     The  axes  of holes   (2B)  are inclined   inward    at  an angle of 20-40° with the burner axis.<br>
-     5     -<br><br>
Typical dimensions of the central gas feeding tube (1), each intermediate oxygen feeding tube (4), each intermediate water circulating tube (5), outermost tube (10), oxygen inlet tube (4A), water inlet tube (7A), water outlet tube (7B) and gas inlet tube (1A) are presented in Table I.<br>
Each of four water circulating tubes (5) passes through a hole made in plates (8 and 9) each and is welded to the upper surface thereof. The upper end of each tube (5) is disposed in upper chamber (6A) at a preferred distance of 31 mm from top end (1B) of the burner and its lower end is disposed in lower chamber (6c) at a preferred distance of 40 mm from exit end (2A) of the burner.<br>
Each of eight oxygen supplying tubes (4) passes through a hole in plate (8) and is welded to the upper surface thereof.  The upper end of each tube (4) is disposed in intermediate chamber (6B) at a preferred distance of 70 mm from top end (1B) of the burner and its lower end is embedded at the upper end of each of eight holes (2B) in copper tip (2) to a depth of 8mm and welded thereto.<br>
Holes (2B) are inclined towards the burner axis at the exit end (2A) at a preferred angle of 20-40°.<br>
For operating the burner, cooling water is supplied at a pressure of about 2 kg/cm2 for preventing any gas from entering the burner to ensure safety against burning of the gas inside the burner.  The preferred flow rate of the cooling water-in the burner is 3 m3/hour.<br>
The burner is capable of operating from fuel gases like coke oven gas, mixed gas or. blast furnace gas.  Coke oven<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
gas can be fired at a maximum flow rate of 2000 Nnr/hour.    The required  purity  of  oxygen is 40 to 90% and required  pressure of oxygen is  0.1  to  1.0 atmosphere.<br>
Field  trials have been  conducted  on the  invented burner under conditions of varying flow rate and pressure of oxygen  (O2)  and  coke oven gas   (COG)  and  oxygen to gas flow rate ratio.    The temperature, length and characteristics of the  flame  produced under said different conditions  are  presented in Table II from which it is noted that  (a) the temperature at the  flame  axis, at. a distance  of 50 mm from the burner tip varies from 1371 to  1964°C and that at the flame tip varies from 948 to 1372°C,   (b) the length of the flame varies from 2.2 to 3.0 m and  (c) characteristics of flame varies from less yellowish to completely blue with large width at the top.<br>
The fuel  gas consumption  rate  and  pollution of environment from discharge of  unburnt fuel gas have been found to be appreciably less for the invented burner in comparison with the conventional oxy-gas burners.<br>
