The invention concerns a connection device and a connection system for a plurality<br>
of electrically insulated conductors.<br>
For the connection of telephone- or data lines in telephone exchanges or distribution<br>
systems, frequently connection devices, for example, connector blocks are provided.<br>
These as a rule comprise a plurality of guides for first lines ("incoming lines"), a<br>
plurality of guides for second lines ("outgoing lines") as well as contact elements for<br>
the connection of each of a first with a second line. Preferred are connection devices,<br>
which are provided solder-free for insulated conductors and which are based on the<br>
Insulation Displacement Contact' (IDC) - technology. The contact elements then in<br>
preference each possess at least two insulation displacement contacts or - less<br>
preferably - two piercing contacts or one insulation displacement contact and one<br>
piercing contact.<br>
Devices of this kind are known in diverse embodiments, and many of these are<br>
available on the market. Mentioned as documents, which demonstrate devices of this<br>
kind, shall be, for example, EP-A-0 321 151, DE-A-2 301 398, and<br>
DE-A-196 52 422.<br>
From the European disclosure document 0 994 528 a multiple connector block is<br>
known, which is based on the insulation displacement contact technology and which<br>
is characterised by the fact that the housing is in one part. Assigned to the contact<br><br>
elements, apart from the insulation displacement contacts on one side (on the side of<br>
the incoming lines), is also a cutting edge. This makes it possible upon connecting a<br>
conductor to be connected to simultaneously cut the conductor to the necessary<br>
length, without this requiring an elaborate tool. A one piece terminal box is also<br>
known from US 4,964,812.<br>
In case of connection devices of the type mentioned, at least some of the following<br>
problem fields respectively come to bear.<br>
1.	Cross-talk behaviour between adjacent contact element pairs. This is of<br>
significance in particular in case of data transmission. The higher the data<br>
transmission rate, the greater the problems become. In order to assure the data<br>
transmission security, therefore the contact elements of connection devices for<br>
higher transmission frequencies have to be arranged as far apart as possible or all<br>
contact banks have to be equipped with compensating functionalities. This,<br>
however, is undesirable, or in many cases not possible for reasons of space and<br>
cost.<br>
2.	Easy connectability. Naturally there is the need to make the connection procedure<br>
as easy and as comfortable as possible. The necessity of complicated tools is to<br>
be avoided.<br>
3.	Manufacturing costs. In the market, there is an enormous pressure on prices for<br>
telecommunications equipment.<br>
In the US - patent document 5,556,296 and the US - patent document 5,160,273 a<br>
connection device with a disconnecting contact is disclosed. A disconnecting contact<br><br>
of this kind consists of two separate contact elements each with an insulation<br>
displacement contact and a spring-loaded end contact, wherein the spring-loaded end<br>
contacts of both contact elements are pressed against one another by the spring force.<br>
Between the two end contacts a separate element may now be inserted. Such an<br>
element may be electrically insulating, as a result of which the electric circuit is<br>
capable of being disconnected. It is also possible that a separate element of this kind,<br>
for example, is designed as a printed circuit and takes over a certain function, e.g., as<br>
an overload protection or for receiving signals. In accordance with the two<br>
documents mentioned, the two contacts elements now are asymmetrically shaped, so<br>
that the distance between the end contacts within a disconnection contact pair is<br>
smaller than the distance between adjacent end contacts between disconnection<br>
contact pairs, which results in a reduced cross-talk.<br>
Similar connection devices may be found in US 5,967,826, where apart from this a<br>
variant is demonstrated, in which the two contact elements opposite one another are<br>
connected by a bridge and therefore form a one-piece, U-shaped connection contact<br>
element.<br>
Connection devices of this type with disconnecting contacts are advantageous for<br>
special applications on the basis of their versatile functionality, they are, however,<br>
elaborate to manufacture, consist of many individual components and for geometrical<br>
reasons require a housing made out of several parts. Apart from this - also for<br>
geometrical reasons - the incoming and outgoing line are conducted on the same side<br>
of the housing and in the same direction, which calls for a precise cutting-off of the<br>
lines by a separate cutter and which may lead to uncontrolled contacts between<br>
conductors.<br><br>
Common to all devices in accordance with the documents mentioned above, is that<br>
they would not be suitable for high transmission rates of, for example, 100 Mbit/s or<br>
more on the basis of the cross-talk behaviour, unless they would be dimensioned to<br>
be very large. In addition they are partially very complex (i.e., expensive) in<br>
manufacture and in part elaborate in the wiring.<br>
It is consequently the objective of the invention to create a connection device, which<br>
also for high transmission rates and with small dimensions assures a satisfactory data<br>
transmission security according to the standards. An easy connectability and low<br>
manufacturing costs should in preference also be assured.<br>
The device in accordance with the invention possesses a housing, which is in one part<br>
and in which there are a plurality of one-piece contact elements, each of which<br>
respectively comprises at least one first and at least one second insulation<br>
displacement - or piercing contact. Between the first and the second contact of each<br>
contact element there is a transition section. The contact elements are arranged in<br>
pairs in an as such known manner. In accordance with the invention, the contact<br>
elements are now asymmetrical in such a manner, that the transition section is<br>
constructed in such a way, that the transition sections of both the contact elements of<br>
the pairs are closer together than the transition sections of adjacent contact elements<br>
of different pairs.<br>
As a result of these differing distances between the transition sections, the cross-talk<br>
behaviour between adjacent pairs is reduced with fixed distances between the<br>
contacts. The differing distances between the transition sections are the result of an<br>
asymmetrical design of the contact elements. This results in a range of advantages. A<br>
first advantage is the fact, that the insulation displacement -, or piercing contacts if so<br>
required may be arranged equidistantly. The asymmetrical shaping ensures, that the<br><br>
sections of the contact elements mainly relevant for the cross-talk behaviour - these<br>
are those, in which current flows - are nonetheless optimised, i.e., are arranged as far<br>
apart from one another as possible between the different pairs. This makes it<br>
possible, without any change of dimensions in comparison with existing connection<br>
devices, to fulfil the requirements of a higher data transmission rate. For example, on<br>
the basis of the invention it is possible that a connection device corresponds to the<br>
category 5 according to ISO/TEC 11801 (2002), and this with dimensions, as are<br>
known from an existing device of the category 3. Plugs, sockets, etc., of the existing<br>
system therefore may be utilised for the higher category 5. With the invention also<br>
connection devices of the category 6 are capable of being implemented in a tight<br>
space, wherein for this purpose preferably screening plates are utilised between the<br>
contact element pairs.<br>
By the approach in accordance with the invention it is made possible, that the<br>
housing is a single part. The manufacturing of the housing as a single, for example,<br>
injection-moulded part, has significant advantages: The manufacturing costs are<br>
lower than in case of multi-part housings. The construction in accordance with the<br>
invention enables the simple inserting of the contact elements into the single part<br>
housing. For the assembling of the connection device, therefore in the single part<br>
housing solely chambers for the contact elements have to be provided.<br>
Apart from this, as a further advantage the contact elements may be designed as plane<br>
and it is possible that they lie in a common plane. This is particularly favourable for<br>
the manufacture: all contact elements or at least groups of contact elements can be<br>
jointly stamped out of one metal sheet. Following possible deformations, in particular<br>
by embossing and/or shearing, they are able to be inserted into the housing together,<br>
held together by a transport strip (bridge).<br><br>
If the contact elements comprise at least one essentially plane section, they are, for<br>
example, asymmetrical with respect to that plane, which connects the two insulation<br>
displacement - or piercing contacts and which runs vertically to the plane section.<br>
It is possible that the contact elements comprise elements protruding from the contact<br>
element plane and deviating from the plane configuration, produced, e.g., by<br>
embossing. Such elements may be designed as latching catches, which prevent a<br>
longitudinal displacement of the contact elements inserted into the housing. As<br>
further contact plane elements protruding from the contact element plane,<br>
reinforcements may be present, which at critical points increase the mechanical<br>
stability and which therefore permit the utilisation of very thin metal sheets.<br>
Reinforcements of this type may in particular serve to assure the forces of the two<br>
forks of an insulation displacement contact.<br>
It is possible that the first and second conductors run essentially parallel to one<br>
another and vertical to the contact elements, in an as such known manner in the area,<br>
in which they are contacted. Apart from this, they are conducted in general at<br>
opposite sides ("front" and "back") of the housing, when they are contacted.<br>
Although a construction of this kind is preferred, it is also possible to utilise the<br>
invention for connection devices, in which the first and second conductors are not<br>
parallel (angled connection device). This may be implemented, for example, with<br>
bent contact elements.<br>
Frequently the contact elements of each pair corresponding to one another (i.e., all<br>
"left-hand" or all "right-hand" contact elements of each pair) are designed identically.<br>
Every pair then contains respectively a first and a second contact element, wherein<br>
the first and the second contact element differ by their shaping or their orientation.<br>
Within the contact element pair therefore the contact elements with a defined<br><br>
orientation are in accordance with the invention not identical. In the case of many<br>
preferred embodiments, however, the first and the second contact element of each<br>
pair of contact elements are mirror inverted to one another.<br>
Therefore it is possible, that so-to-say two types of contact elements, "right-hand"<br>
and left-hand" ones, or first and second ones are present. The first and the second<br>
contact elements may have an identical shape and solely differ with respect to their<br>
orientation. I.e., the second contact elements are then first contact elements, which,<br>
for example, are rotated by 180 degree around a longitudinal axis. This is applicable<br>
in particular in those cases, in which contact elements do not comprise any elements<br>
protruding from the plane (latching catches, reinforcements, etc.).<br>
Into the - for this purpose enlarged - intermediate spaces between the transition<br>
sections of contact elements of adjacent pairs, it is possible for screening elements to<br>
be inserted. These are advantageous in particular in case of connection devices,<br>
which are foreseen for high data transmission rates: they make a more compact<br>
construction possible, while adhering to the standards (for example, category 6).<br>
The housing in an as such known manner may comprise insertion slots for the<br>
conductors. By the insertion of insulated conductors into the insertion slots and the<br>
subsequent pressing into the contact, the conductors are contacted, because the<br>
cutting terminals or piercing tips of the contacts protrude into these slots. It is<br>
possible that the sliding-in of the conductors - i.e. the connection - takes place with<br>
the help of a wiring tool.<br>
It is possible, that the housing furthermore comprises catches for the attachment to an<br>
installation channel. These may be asymmetrical in such a manner, that it is possible<br><br>
to latch on to the installation channel in two orientations. In a first orientation then a<br>
first side (for the wiring of the first, here the "incoming" lines) and in the other<br>
orientation a second side (for the wiring of the second, here the "outgoing" lines) is<br>
located at the front and as a result of this is easily accessible. Catches of this type are<br>
known, for example, from EP-A-0 994 528, to which document reference is<br>
explicitly made here, in particular to Figure 1 and to its description.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the contact elements are each assigned at<br>
least one, frequently two cutters. By means of this or these, an over-length of a<br>
conductor is cut off directly during the wiring. As a result of the fact that the cutter is<br>
integrated into the connection device, the wiring tool is able to be designed in a very<br>
simple manner. Nonetheless, for the wiring and the cutting-off of over-lengths only a<br>
single working step is necessary. Solutions, in the case of which a cutter is provided<br>
on the wiring tool, in contrast are more complicated.<br>
The cutter or at least one cutter may be provided as a component separate from the<br>
contact element. This has advantages with respect to manufacturing technology: the<br>
cutter (or its cutting edge) naturally has to fulfil the prerequisite, that it is provided in<br>
a different plane than the insulation displacement contact or the piercing contact.<br>
From prior art it is known, that the cutter is constructed as a single piece together<br>
with the contact element. In this case it is only possible to comply with the<br>
prerequisite mentioned, if the contact element (with cutting edge) is three-<br>
dimensionally shaped, therefore not in a single plane. Following the manufacture by<br>
punching out from a metal sheet, in accordance with prior art therefore some<br>
reshaping of the element still has to be carried out, which is expensive. A further<br>
advantage of having the cutter as a separate component is that the selection of<br>
materials in case of the components contact element and cutter may be optimised.<br>
Thus, for example, in the case of the cutter it is possible to select a harder material<br>
than for the contact element itself.<br><br>
Especially preferred is a construction, in the case of which the contacted conductors<br>
do not touch the cutter anymore following the wiring operation. Then the cutter does<br>
not contribute to the cross-talk behaviour and the capacitance of the arrangement<br>
becomes smaller, which also minimises losses. Also the electrical potential of the<br>
cutter is not relevant then, and in principle it is possible that an electrical contact<br>
exists between the cutters of adjacent contact elements. The connection device may<br>
even be designed in such a manner, that a cutting element forms several cutters and<br>
possibly comprises a single, common cutting edge running transverse to the direction<br>
of the conductor, which cuts off the over-lengths of several adjacent conductors.<br>
Apart from the housing, the contact elements if so applicable the cutters, it is possible<br>
that the connection device still comprises further components.<br>
For example, on one of the sides (typically on the side of the second "outgoing"<br>
conductors) there may be a wiring lid serving as a covering, on which it is possible to<br>
write or print. With this component the insertion slots can be covered and the pairs of<br>
conductors may be written or printed on in accordance with their function.<br>
As a further additional component, it is possible that the connection device - typically<br>
for the side of the first "incoming" conductors - is provided with a second cover,<br>
which may comprise a tension relieving element for a multi-strand cable.<br>
Also additionally in one of the wiring lids and/or coverings or directly in the insertion<br>
slots for the conductors it is possible that a gel or a weather protection grease is<br>
present, which acts as a corrosion protection.<br><br>

accompanying drawings. These drawings illustrate:<br>

The connection device 1 according to Figure 1 complies with the category 5. It<br>
comprises a housing 2, which in an as such known manner comprises a plurality of<br>
chambers for contact elements. The chambers a located between insertion slots 2.1,<br>
which serve as guides for electrically insulated conductors to be contacted (not<br>
illustrated). The contact elements are arranged in pairs. In the depicted embodiment,<br>
the contact element pairs 11 are provided with a numbering 2.2. The insertion slots<br>
2.1 in the embodiment illustrated are arranged equidistantly, i.e., the distances<br>
between two insertion slots 2.1 of a pair are at the same distance from one another as<br>
the distance from one insertion slot to the closest insertion slot of an adjacent pair.<br>
Laterally relative to the contact elements the housing comprises catches 2.3, which<br>
serve for the attachment in an installation channel. Apart from the housing and the<br>
contact elements, the connection device comprises cutters 4, 5. Their function will be<br>
explained further below. In addition shown are a marking covering 6 for second lines<br>
(outgoing) lines) as well as a cable covering 7 for first lines (incoming lines). The<br><br>
cable covering 7 comprises a tension relief shackle 7.1, on which an incoming cable<br>
comprising several conductors may be mechanically guided and/or attached.<br>
In Figure 2 the housing 2 is illustrated only in part. Therefore one can see the contact<br>
elements 3 arranged in pairs next to one another as well as first cutters 4 and second<br>
cutters 5. Per contact element there is a first cutter 4 and a second cutter 5. The<br>
contact elements are essentially plane and define a contact element plane. The cutters<br>
in preference are arranged parallel to this contact element plane and are electrically<br>
insulated from the contact elements. The construction and arrangement of the contact<br>
elements in contact element pairs 11 are particularly well visible in the Figures 3<br>
and 4. Each contact element forms a first insulation displacement contact 3.1, a<br>
second insulation displacement contact 3.2 and a transition section 3.3 running in<br>
between. It is possible that the insulation displacement contacts 3.1, 3.2 are shaped in<br>
an as such known manner and are provided for the multiple contacting of insulated<br>
conductors of a certain diameter or diameter range. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
insulation displacement contacts possess reinforcements 3.4, which have been<br>
produced by embossing and which ensure a mechanical stability and sufficient<br>
clamping forces also in case of the utilisation of very thin sheet metal. The also<br>
visible embossings (here as rectangular elements) in the area on the tightest point of<br>
the insulation displacement contact serve for the adjustment of the width of the<br>
contact slot, independent of the punching tool. In the area of the transition section 3.3<br>
the contact elements comprise latching catches 3.5 formed by shearing, which<br>
following the insertion of the contact elements into the chambers of the housing 2<br>
latch with a latching cog 2.4 of the housing and prevent a displacement of the contact<br>
elements in the direction of their longitudinal axis. During "shearing" contrary to<br>
punching, the material is not completely removed; here simultaneously the latching<br>
catch is bent over. Depicted are two latching catches 3.5 per contact element. If the<br>
chambers are asymmetrical and shaped in such a manner, that during the insertion<br>
they form a stop for the latching elements; then one latching catch per latching<br>
element is sufficient.<br><br>
The contact elements are asymmetrically shaped and in particular in such a manner,<br>
that also in the case of an equidistant arrangement of the insulation displacement<br>
contacts the transition sections 3.3 of the two contact elements of a contact element<br>
pair are closer to one another than to the transition section of a contact element of an<br>
adjacent pair. This is in contrast to the prior art, in accordance with which the contact<br>
elements are respectively symmetrical (in this, the plane of symmetry is the plane<br>
extending in longitudinal direction, vertically to the contact element plane).<br>
On the basis of the elements provided by embossing (latching catches 3.5,<br>
reinforcements 3.4), the first and the second contact element 3 of every contact<br>
element pair are not only different with respect to their orientation, but they also<br>
differ geometrically. In the illustrated example, the first and the second contact<br>
elements are mirror inverted to one another.<br>
During the wiring operation, conductors are inserted into the insertion slots 2.1 of the<br>
housing from the outside, as a result of which in an as such known manner the<br>
insulation is locally cut through and displaced by the cutters of the insulation<br>
displacement contacts 3.1, 3.2, so that the insulation displacement contacts contact<br>
the conducting insides of the conductors. During the wiring simultaneously over-<br>
lengths of the conductor are cut off by the cutters 4, 5. The cutters are constructed<br>
and arranged in such a manner, that following the wiring operation they are not<br>
contacted by the conductors. This is illustrated particularly clearly in Figure 5, where<br>
a wired conductor 12, a section of a contact element 3 and a cutter 4 are depicted.<br>
The cutter in the illustrated embodiment comprises an indentation 4.1, on the basis of<br>
which a safety distance between the conductor and the cutter is assured, as a result of<br>
which it is also ensured, that no electrical contacting between the conductor and the<br>
cutter takes place.<br><br>
Figure 6 illustrates how the utilisation of essentially plane contact elements makes<br>
possible a particularly simple manufacturing of the device in accordance with the<br>
invention. The housing 1 is in preference manufactured as a single injection-moulded<br>
part. For the manufacturing of the contact elements 3, of the first cutters 4 and of the<br>
second cutters 5, by punching and subsequent embossing respectively out of a metal<br>
sheet - for example sheet steel - a primary product is manufactured. This comprises a<br>
plurality of contact elements/cutters, which are held together by bridges 13, 14, or 15.<br>
The primary products if so required are cut to a length, which corresponds to the<br>
length of the connection device and subsequently in the orientation according to<br>
Figure 6 are pressed into the chambers of the housing provided for this purpose.<br>
Thereupon the bridges are broken off. The cutters are held in the housing by wedging<br>
the cutters in the plastic housing (by barbs).<br>
The contact elements - for example, in contrast to the contact elements in accordance<br>
with EP 0 994 528 - do not comprise any sections, which are bent over by more than<br>
90 degrees relative to the contact element plane. It is only this circumstance that<br>
makes it possible for the contact elements (and also the cutters) to be manufactured<br>
solely by punching and embossing.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates two connection devices, in the case of which the coverings 6, 7<br>
are affixed, in an installation channel 21. The catches 2.3 engage in opening 21.1<br>
provided for this purpose on the side walls of the cable channel, by means of which<br>
the connection devices are attached.<br>
In Figure 8 the housing 31 of an alternative embodiment of the connection device in<br>
accordance with the invention is illustrated. This connection device differs from the<br>
one described above by the fact, that between the contact element pairs (not<br>
illustrated) respectively a screening element is present. This is formed by screening<br><br>
walls 32.1, which are present on a screening element 32. For the screening walls in<br>
the housing 31, special insertion slots 31.1 between contact element pairs are<br>
provided. As a result it is also possible to insert the screening element into the<br>
housing from the outside. The screening walls 32.1 screen the contact elements of<br>
adjacent pairs, in particular in the zone, where the insulation displacement contacts<br>
are spatially closer together than in the zone of the transition sections. The screening<br>
walls 32.1 are all electrically connected with one another. Apart from this, the<br>
screening element 32 as a whole is grounded through fork contacts 32.2, which in the<br>
installed condition of the device make contact with side walls of the installation<br>
channel 21.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 8, for example, corresponds to the category 6.<br>
The contact elements may be identical with the contact elements illustrated in Figure<br>
4, wherein the distances between the contact element pairs possibly are greater than<br>
in the case of the embodiment described above. Of course the utilisation of different<br>
types of asymmetrical contact elements is also possible. In contrast to the device of<br>
the category 5 with 10 contact element pairs described above, in the device with the<br>
same overall width according to Figure 8 only 8 pairs are provided.<br>
In Figure 9 a contact element pair of an embodiment is illustrated, in which the<br>
incoming and outgoing conductors are at an angle relative to one another. Even if for<br>
the manufacturing of these angled contact elements 42 one additional processing step<br>
is necessary than in the case of the above embodiments and the housing possibly is<br>
not in a single piece, the idea in accordance with the invention is still implemented<br>
also in this embodiment. The transition sections 41.3 of the two contact elements of a<br>
pair also here on the basis of the asymmetrical construction (with respect to a plane,<br>
which connects the insulation displacement contacts together and runs vertically to<br>
the plane sections) are closer together than the distance to the adjacent contact<br>
element of a different pair amounts to.<br><br>
The Figures 10 and 11 illustrate a plug of a connection system, which instead of the<br>
direct contacting of cable cores (corresponding to the conductors) is capable through<br>
the insulation displacement contacts of being utilised to make a contact between a<br>
two-core cable and a contact element pair. The plug possesses a plug housing 51 with<br>
at least two plug contacts 52. The plug, for example, can be plugged into the<br>
connection device on the side of the outgoing conductors, wherein the housing, e.g.,<br>
comprises holding tongues 51.1, which are inserted into the connection device and<br>
there guide and hold the plug. During the insertion into the connection device, a<br>
contact between the plug contacts 52 and the contact elements is made. This can be<br>
seen particularly clearly in Figure 11, where apart from a plug contact 52 also a<br>
section of a contact element 2 is illustrated. In Figure 11 the drawing A depicts a side<br>
view of a contact element with plug contact. Drawing B is a view of this arrangement<br>
obliquely from above, while drawing C represents the arrangement in a section along<br>
the line C-C (in drawing A) in a view from above.<br>
The plug contact at the end side comprises a wire-like section 52.1, which for the<br>
purpose of forming the electric contact is brought between the forks of the insulation<br>
displacement contact 3.2. The wire-like section in cross-section, for example, is<br>
round or rectangular. It has, for example, a diameter, which corresponds to that of a<br>
conductor with its insulation stripped off. It extends between two parallel tongues<br>
52.3, which form a plane. Here, this plane extends vertically to the contact element<br>
plane. At the other end the plug contact comprises a cable contacting section 52.4,<br>
which on its part may comprise at least one insulation displacement contact 52.5.<br>
Conceivable are also plugs with more than two plug contacts, for example, with four<br>
plug contacts.<br><br>
