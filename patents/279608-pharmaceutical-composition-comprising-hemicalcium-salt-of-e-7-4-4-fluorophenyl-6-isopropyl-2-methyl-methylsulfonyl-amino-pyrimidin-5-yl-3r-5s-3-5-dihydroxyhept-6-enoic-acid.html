Present invention from the field of phamiaceutics relates to pharmaceuficsd composition contaMrtng(EH44-{4-fluorophenyl)-6-l8opropyl-2Hm^^<br>
ylK3R, 5S)-3.5-dihydrDxyhep(-6<enoic acid or a phannaoeutlcally-acceptable salt thereof agents especially ttie h></enoic>
Byyicflrpymi jnytn^p<br>
The agent is a 3-hydioxy-3-methytgtutaryi (HMG) CoA reductase InhOjitor loiown from EP 521471 and formulated into a phamnaceutical composition can be used for (manutacturnig the medicament for) treating hyperchoiesteroiemia, hyperlipidproteinemia and atherosclerosis. A mqjor issue assotiated with the bulk agent or fonnulated into a composition is that It is particularly sensHive to degradation. The major degradation products fbnned (as known from US 6548513) are the lactone (N-{4-(4^luoro-phenyl)-5H2-(4- hydroxy-«-oxo-tetrtahydropyran-2-yl)-vtnyi)-e-i8opropyHifyrimk^ methanesulfonamide) and the oxklatton product (7-[4-(4-fluoropheny()-6-isopropyl-2- [me0)yKtnethy(sulfonyi)aminoK&gt;yrimidhvS-yl}-3-hydrox^5-oxo-hept-e«r^ add). Also, when exposed to ligM, the agent undergoes degradatkm to two diastereomeric cydk: products, described in US 2005/0187234 A1. The mentioned degradations of the agent under conditions of humkfity, acidity, oxygen and light is a challenge for tfie manufacture of a pharmaoeutk»l fonnulatkm, stable enough for ordinary storage condttions.<br>
This stabiSzation of the agent or chemtoalty simflar compounds, espedaiiy those belonging to HM6-C0A reductase inhibitorB, could be achieved by controlling pH in a formulaSon (by addition of components such as a carboruite or bicarbonate) and by adding to compo^on a stabilizing inorganic salt, particularly tribask: Mbasks caldum phosphate. AnUoxklants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene may also be used to hinder oxkiatkm of the ageint. Ararther option is to stabilize a pharmaceutteal compositkxi using an amino sugar. Pharmaceutk^l composition of the agent currently marketed under name Creator contains 5,10,20, or 40 mg of the agent, tnlMUlc cateium phosphate as the stabilizing inoiganic salt and the foltowing inactive ingredients: mkxocrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, crospovklone,<br>
magnesium stearate, hypromellose. triacetin, titanium doxide. yellow fenric oxide, and red ferric oxide.<br>
Pescriatton of the figure<br>
Figure represents the comparison of the amount of the main degradation product (lactone form of the agent, as measured by IHPLC), wMch is fomned if ttie compositions corresponding to currently mar1(eted formulation and the composition in accordance with our imwntion are subjected to accelerated stability program (as proposed by ICH guidelines: 40*C and 75 % relative humidity, stored in the primary padcage). The y axis represents the % of the fornied degradation product (lactone), and x axis the time in months.<br>

The phamiaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared using standard techniques and manufacturing processes generally known in the art, for example by dry blending the components. The components of the blend prior to blending, or the blend Itself, may be passed through a mesh screen. Conveniently a lubricant may also be added to the blend and bianding cor4inued until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. The mixture is then compressed into tablets. Alternatively, a wet granul^ion technique can be employed.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising (E)-7-[4-(4-auorophenyl}-6-isopropyl-2- (methyi(methylsulf6nyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yi]-(3R, 5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic add hemicak^m salt and ingrecKents finm aforesaid first group and second group ate prepared by dry blencHng the agent and all excipients (inactive bigrsdients) except hdmcant in a double cone mixer. Next a lubricant, in one embodiment glyceryl behenate, and in another embodiment sodium stearyl fumarate is added to the mixture and blended for a short period of time, such as needed to substantiany homogeniu the mixture, e.g. up to 5 miutes. The mixture is then compressed into tablets and film coated with a conventiorid coatbig composition coning of film forming polymer sudi as hypromeOose or hydroxypropyl ceflulose, film softener such as polyethylene glycol, pigments, talc.<br>
A typical composition in accordance with our invention wiH comprise (wt.)<br>
agent (hemicaicium salt)	5-20%<br>
lactose	40-60%<br>
siHcifled microcrystalHne cellulose	20 - 30%<br>
cornstarch	1-25%<br>
and further<br>
a gOdant (talc and/or o&gt;lloidal silidum dioxide)	0,5-5%<br>
 <br>
1 a hilMlcant (sodium stearyl fumarate and/or glyceryl behanate)	0,1-3%<br>
and opHonally further<br>
sodium starch gylcolate	0-5%<br>
<br>
based film coating formulation. Coating ingredient combinations are readily avaHatrie. In an embodiment of the invention coatings contaming pigments or colorants reduce the rate of fomuition of photo degradation products of the agent<br>
Experimental part<br>
The bulk agent is subjected to stress conditions, such as elevated temperature (40*C and above), elevated humldi^ (75 % or higher relative iHimicfity, dish comfitlons), oi^gen atmosphere or solutions vntti different pH. An HPLC analysis, capable of resolving the s^ent and its degradation products is then employed, to quantify the amount (given as a mass percentage relative to the agent) of degriad^ion products in the stressed samples. Good chromatographic resolution can be achieved on a C18 reversed phase column udth acidic phosphate buffer and an increasing gradient of acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran. Degraditfon products are quantified using UV detection at 242 nm. The reporting Hmit of the (tegradatlon products has been set at 0,05 %. The % reported for HPLC analysis are in general area %.<br>
When bulk (E)-7-{4-(4^fkiorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-{methyt(methylsulfonyl)amino]^^ ylK3R, 5S)-3,S-dliydroxyhept-6-enok: acM hemteahdum scdt is exposed to stress conditnns the compound cheinkally degrades, showHig its instability as denwnstrated by foUomn findings:<br>
stress condition	amount of lactone (%)	amount of oxkiatton pro(fcjct(%)<br>
aqueous solutkm of the agerrt, buffered to pH = 5 at room temperature (24 hours)	2,30	
the agent under oxygen at 60*C for 14 days	0,17	0,71<br>
<br>
The results of exposing to the same stress condition a mixture of agent and commonly used exdpients such as lactose, crosslinked cartwxymethyteelkilose sodium or crosslinked PVP are substantially similar to resists of the bulk agent subjected to the stress conditk&gt;ns.<br>
However exposing mixtiras of agent and ttie ingredierts from ttw aforementioned first and second group, the amounts of lactone fbnned are sutistantiaHy lower then as wtth the ^jent alone, showing their stabifizing property.<br>
When a t&gt;inary mii(ture (w 1:1) of the agent and any of the ingredients fimn the first group is stored under oxygen at 60*C for 14 days, no oxidation product is fbnned compared to 0,71% fomtedon exposing the ixjik agent<br>
Two working examples of stable formulations are presented, foUowed by two reference examples (first with commonly used tableUng exdpients and second including an allcalizing excipient).<br>
WORKING EXAMPt^l<br>
The following pharmaceutical composition is a novel composition, prepared by the process as described above, using ingredients from both two groups of stabilizing ingrecfients.<br>
Ingredient	Function	w%<br>
The Agent (cateium salt)	acHve 		.9,2<br>
Lactose	fHler	55,9<br>
Silidfied Microcrystalliro Celtuk&gt;se	filler, binder, disintegrant, active stabilizer	24,4<br>
Cornstarch	filter, binder, disintegrant. active stabilizer	3,6<br>
Sodium Starch Glycolate	disMegrant, active stabilizer	2.4<br>
Tate	gridant	2,7<br>
Glyceryl Behanate	lubiteant	1.8<br>
<br>
The pH of the fonnulatton is 6,2. The amount of lactone is only 0.50% after 14 days at 40'C and 75% relative humidity (open dish). The o}ddation product is nci formed.<br>
Ttie amount of lactone does not increase above 0.25% after 6 months at 40*C in bnpemieable package. The amount of the oxkiatton product after 6 months at 40*C in impermeable package is only 0,05% or below. Comparatively the amounts of lactone and oxidatton product in a phamraceutfcal composition of the agent such as the one currently marketed (Figure) are 0,51 % and 0,38 %, respectively. <br>
The tablet film coating (2.5% coating on weight of coated tabM) consisting of hyimmetlose. hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, pigments and talc had no sut&gt;stantial effect on fonnation of lactone or oxidation product. <br>
