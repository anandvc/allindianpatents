				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for making ice-cream, and other like items slush, milk-shake and separating butter from the curd.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Motor operated ice-cream makers are as such known in the art. Such ice-cream maker comprises an outer drum having a metallic container disposed therein. A motor is provided at the bottom of the container assembly such that to rotate the container at a predetermined r.p.m. There are disadvantages associated with the assembly as such known in the art.<br>
One of the main disadvantages is that it takes lot of time to prepare the ice -cream.<br>
Another disadvantage is that such machines can work only in the presence of the electricity. Therefore these machines are useless where the electricity is not available.<br>
A still another disadvantage is that the whipping of ice-cream is not satisfactory as the container rotates only in one direction.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the machine is very costly and the maintenance thereof is also costly.<br><br>
A hand operator ice maker is also known in the prior art which comprises an outer wooden drum having a metallic box disposed therein and such that a mixture of ice and salt is filled there between during the preparation of ice cream. A cog wheel is provided over the metallic container such that to rotate the same by means of a handle in order to rotate the metallic container for preparing the ice-cream. There are disadvantages associated with the manually operated ice¬cream maker.<br>
One of the main disadvantage is that it requires too much physical power so as to rotate the metallic container.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the manually operated device takes a lot of time to prepare ice-cream.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that a lot of energy is wasted due to the friction existing in the container rotating system.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the lubricant used to lubricate the rotating system gets mixed with the ice-cream if operator is not careful everytime.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that some time the wooden drum starts rotting or decaying due to its contact with salt &amp; water.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a device for making ice¬cream whose operation is easy and the maintenance cost is negligible.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a device which can be operated as well as by an electric motor as per user's choice.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a device for making ice-cream which takes very little time to prepare the ice-cream.<br>
Still another object if this invention is to propose a device for making ice-cream whose cost is affordable even by the lower and middle class people.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a device which can be used by any user in the absence of the electric power.<br>

b)	an operation cord (4) provided around the said metallic container (2)<br>
and adapted to rotate the said metallic container (2) in clock-wise and<br>
anti-clockwise direction;<br>
c)	a scrapper made of ABS and rough and tough plastic or Aluminium<br>
comprising a square or rectangular shaped piece having plurality of<br>
openings (16) near both the sides, a holding bar (13) secured centrally<br>
in the said metallic container (2) and passing throughout the piece of<br>
scrapper, a cut (18) being provided to expose lower end (19) of the<br>
said holding bar (13) and scrap head point (5) of the said holding bar<br>
projecting out from the scrap holder (6) as herein described, a<br>
plurality of angles (20) being secured to the openings (16);<br>
d)	a scrapper holder (6) secured to the top end of said outer drum (1) by<br>
screw means (7) and having central hole (12) to hold the head point<br>
(5) of the holding bar (13) of the said scrapper.<br><br>
To make the ice-cream, the mixture of ice and salt is filled in the space between the outer plastic drum and inner metallic container. The inner metallic container having the ice-cream making mixture contained therein is rotated manually in the clock-wise as well as in anti-clock-wise directions with the help of rotating cord so as to freeze the ice-cream.<br>
