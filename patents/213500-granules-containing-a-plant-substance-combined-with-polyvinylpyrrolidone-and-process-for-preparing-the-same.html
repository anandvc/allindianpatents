COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"GRANULES CONTAINING A PLANT SUBSTANCE COMBINED WITH POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE<br>
SAME"<br>
DBF, a French company of 120, Bureaux de la Colline, 92210 Saint Cloud, France,<br>
GRANTED<br>
8-11-2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
The present invention relates to granules containing  a plant substance combined with polyvinylpyrrolidone and process for preparing the same.<br>
The subject of the present invention is a new   formulation    in   ±he  form  of  granules containing a plant substance as well as the process for preparing it.<br>
More precisely, the present invention relates to granules' containing at least one plant substance and •' each comprising a neutral core coated 'with a layer . containing the said plant substance combined  with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
The formulations containing plant substances which are already described in the prior art are in the form of powders, granules, tablets or oral solutions.<br>
The  major'  problem  with  formulations  in . powdered form is that the plant powder has to be mixed with excipients which are also in powdered form. A mixture of powders is then obtained which is not very homogeneous and hardly reproducible.<br>
Furthermore, powders are very hygroscopic'and<br>
they therefore pump moisture from the granules and from<br>
the gelatin capsule, which become brittle. This poses<br>
.problems  of  stability,  and  the  proportion  in  the<br>
gelatin capsule is not homogeneous.<br>
This problem is solved within the framework<br>
v<br>
of the present invention by the application of a plant substance in dry or liquid form onto neutral micrograins; in this case, there is no mixing of powder but only the application of dry or liquid substances onto neutral granules.<br>
The granules according to the invention have the advantage of being easier to package into gelatin capsules than powders, of being more stable to storage than the formulations of. the prior art and of allowing a reproducible proportion.<br>
As for tablets, they have the same problems as powders.  Moreover,  plant extracts are not always<br><br>
compressible  and  compressing  agents  are  not  always authorized in the food industry..<br>
Finally, the oral fluid forms are often bitter and foul-smelling to the extent that sweeteners and stabilizers need to be added. In addition, the oral fluid  forms may exhibit physical or chemical instability during storage, a low content of characteristic plant constituents, and frequently contain ethyl alcohol in a moderately large quantity, which is not generally desirable for the oral administration of medicinal products.<br>
The multiparticulate form of the formulation of the invention makes it possible to obtain a uniform and reproducible release profile.<br>
In addition, the granules of the invention which each contain a layer of plant substance mounted on a neutral core may be coated with an outer layer so as to modify their properties. The outer layer comprises, for example, an enteric polymer, a polymer intended to prolong the release of the plant substance or a polymer intended to mask the taste or the odour of the plant substance.<br>
The formulation according to the invention has the advantage of being stable during storage, of having an enhanced bioavailability, and of being able t.o   integrate high doses of plant substance.<br>
FR 2,721,512 describes a process for the preparation of granules by extrusion-spheronization from a polymer with absorbent or adsorbent properties. the polymer is sprayed with an aqueous-alcoholic fluid slant extract.<br>
The synthetic or natural polymer is optionally combined with' auxiliary substances, such as lactose or PVP, which make it possible to modulate the porosity of the spheroids and their rate of dissolution.<br>
The extrusion-spheronization technique has many  disadvantages:  it  requires  the  addition  of  a<br><br>
quantity of water at least equal to the quantity of excipients,  the  grariules  obtained by this  technique have high moisture levels and their drying takes too. long.   In   addition,   the   process   described   in<br>
FR 2, 721,512	uses powder<br>
FR 2,616,068 describes a process which consists in granulating a dry or soft plant extract with methyl cellulose or silica.<br>
FR 2,682,874 describes a process for the preparation of an extract of active ingredient in dry form from a fluid extract, which consists in adsorbing an aqueous-alcoholic solution of the active ingredient onto porous grains of cellulose or silica. The grains have a particle size which is in the micron range. These grains are then adsorbed onto porous granules 0.1 to 0.5 mm in diameter,  which for example consist of<br>
sugar.<br>
FR 2,737,134   describes   a   process   which consists in coating cores, having a diameter of less<br>
than 0.01 mm, consisting of maltisorb or of a sodium bicarbonate/citrate mixture,- with a - compound in powdered form and a compound in solution. The compound in splution is an essential oil and/or a concentrated fluid plant extract.<br>
The subjecjt of ' the" present invention is granules which overccjme the disadvantages of the prior art formulations. Thjese granules containing at least one plant substance a|re characterized in that they each comprise a neutral core having a particle size of between 0.2 and 4 mm coated with a layer containing the plant substance combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
The plant substance may be derived from plants chosen from garlic, Echinacea, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, harpagophytum, kava, St.-John s-wort, green tea, valerian, Missouri grape, artichoke, hawthorn, burdock, birch, alder buckthorn, blackcurrant, blessed thistle,  Fucus,  hamamelis,  horse  chestnut,   balm,<br><br>
Orthosiphon, passion . flower, dandelion, horsetail, meadowsweet, sage, spirulina, boldo, nettle, North American palm and mixtures thereof.<br>
The neutral core consists of a substance chosen from sugar, starch, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, cellulose, talc and mixtures thereof.<br>
The neutral cores may also consist of a starch/sucrose core in 20/80 mass ratios which is coated with 80% by weight of starch. In such neutral cores, the proportion by mass of sugar is advantageously less than 20%.<br>
The layer containing the plant substance may contain   a   binder.   A   sugar   such   as   sucrose, polyvinylpyrrolidone      (PVP),     lac     gum     or hydroxypro'pylmethylcellulose is advantageously used as binder.<br>
The granules according to the invention may-consist of a neutral core coated with a layer containing the plant substance, itself coated with an outer layer intended to mask the taste and/or the odour of the plant substance, to delay its release or to control its release.<br>
When the outer layer is intended to control the release of the plant substance, it advantageously contains lac gum, PVP, a copolymer of methacrylic acid (Eudragit®) or a colloidal dispersion of ethyl cellulose (Aquacoat®) with a plasticizer.<br>
When the outer layer is intended to delay the release of the plant substance, it contains a methacrylic acid copolymer, lac gum or a colloidal dispersion of ethyl cellulose (Aquacoat®) with a olasticizer.<br>
As polymer intended to mask the taste and/or bhe odour of the plant substance, a copolymer of tiethacrylic acid (Eudragit E 100®), a polyacrylate iispersion (Eudragit NE 30D®) or hydroxypropylmethyl-;ellulose (Pharmacoat®) may be used.<br><br>
It ' is also possible to use, as enteric polymer, lac gum by spraying an alcoholic solution containing 10% by weight of lac gum. At higher concentrations, between 20 and 40%, lac gum fulfils the function of a delayed-release polymer. In the granules., the content of plant substance is between 0.1 mg/g and 750 mg/g.<br>
The present invention relates in particular to garlic granules.with masked odour and taste, Ginkgo biloba granules, one daily dose, prolonged-release ginseng granules, enteric Harpagophytum granules, prolonged-release green tea granules, prolonged-release Orthosiphon granules, valerian granules with masked taste and odour and prolonged-release St.-John's-wort granules.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the granules described above. The process according to the invention allows better reproducibility of the proportion. The granules according to the invention may contain several plant substances used in the form of plant powder, of dry, soft or fluid plant extracts or of mixtures thereof.<br>
According to the definition given in the pharmacopoeia, plant extracts are concentrated preparations which are liquid, solid or of intermediate consistency, generally obtained from dried plant raw materials. For some preparations, the materials to be extracted may undergo a preliminary treatment such as inactivation of enzymes, grinding or defatting.<br>
Fluid extracts are liquid preparations of which, in general, a portion by mass or by volume corresponds to a portion by mass of dried raw material. These preparations are adjusted, if necessary, so as to meet the requirements of content of solvents, of constituents or of dry residue.<br>
Soft extracts are preparations having an intermediate consistency between fluid extracts and dry extracts.  Soft  extracts  are  prepared  by  partial<br><br>
evaporation of the solvent which served for their preparation. Only ethanol at an appropriate titre or water are used. Soft extracts have in general a dry residue which is not less - than 70 per cent m/m. They may contain appropriate antimicrobial preservatives .<br>
Dry extracts are solid preparations obtained by evaporation of the solvent which served for their production. Dry extracts have' in general a dry residue which is not less than 95 per cent m/m. Appropriate inert substances may be added. .<br>
The plant powders are obtained from whole plants or fragmented or cut plant portions, used as they are, in desiccated form.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the granules are obtained by powder-coating when the plant substance is in the form of plant powder or of a dry extract.<br>
Powder-coating is advantageously carried out by alternately spraying an alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic solution of a binder, and the plant substance in desiccated form (powder or dry extract).<br>
The granules are obtained by spray-coating when the plant substance is in the form of a soft or fluid extract.<br>
In the case of a fluid extract, the active layer may. be coated with a layer obtained by spraying a solution of a binder. The fluid extract preferably contains about 30 to 40% alcohol.<br>
The process according to the invention advantageously makes it possible to limit the quantity of organic solvent used. During the process of the Invention, 5 to 2 5% by weight of organic solvents are used.<br>
The size of the granules used will be chosen as a function of the type of extract used and as a function of the desired proportion.<br><br>
Preferably, the size of the Neutres is between 200 and 900 tim, when the plant substance is in desiccated form (powder or dry extract).<br>
The size of the Neutres is between 900 and 1250 μm,    when the plant substance is in liquid form (soft or fluid extract).<br>
The percentage by mass of plant substance in the form of fluid extract, used in the process of the invention is advantageously between 15 and 5 0% relative to the weight of the granules.<br>
The percentage by mass of plant substance in desiccated form (extract, powder) may be as high as 75% relative to the weight of the granules; it is preferably between 35 and 55%.<br>
The granules according to the invention are prepared according to coating techniques known in the art, preferably in a pan or in a fluidized air bed.<br>
The invention is illustrated without any limitation by the following examples.<br>
Example 1; Green tea (dry extract)<br>
