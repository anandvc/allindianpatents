				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention refers to a dampened suspension<br>
unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or'similar. ^Particular<br>
reference  is made  to motorcycles  commonly  known as<br>
scooters,<br>
In order to guarantee riding safety and comfort, the<br>
connection between the motorcycle frame and the rear<br>
wheel is effected always by shock absorbers, which allow<br>
the absorption of an uneven road surface.<br>
Motorcycles are usually made of a frame to which is<br>
hinged, so that it can oscillate, one end of a plate or<br>
motor timing case supporting a rear wheel hub. A second<br>
end of the plate is connected to the motorcycle frame<br>
through shock absorbers.<br>
Traditionally there are one or two shock absorbers and,<br>
in the latter case, these are symmetrically situated on<br>
both sides of the motorcycle.<br>
In particular, one of the shock absorbers is fixed to a<br>
bore made in a casing of the transmission, while the<br>
other is fixed to a bore made directly in the hub support<br>
plate.<br>
It is a well-known fact that traditional type dampened<br>
suspension units   take up a lot of space, especially<br>
above the rear wheel, i.e. since the shock absorbers need<br>
a given space to be able to work properly.<br>
As a consequence, on one hand, the seat must be placed at<br>
a certain height from the ground, and on the other hand,<br>
that it is impossible to fit a container or storage case<br>
below the seat, unless of very limited size.<br>
The aim of the invention is, therefore, to eliminate the<br>
technical problems encountered, by producing a dampened<br>
suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar<br>
with a substantially reduced overall height.<br>
Another aim of the invention is to produce a dampened<br>
suspension  unit  which  allows  the  mounting  on  the<br>
motorcycle  of  a  larger  storage  case  than has  been<br>
possible until now.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to produce a dampened<br>
suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar<br>
which is essentially simple, safe and reliable.<br>
These and other aims, according to the present invention,<br>
are satisfied by producing a dampened suspension unit of<br>
a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar according to claim<br>
1.<br>
Other features of the present invention are defined,<br>
besides, in the subsequent claims.<br>
Advantageously, the dampened suspension unit, according<br>
to the present invention,  allows  the production of<br>
motorcycles	with  low  seats  and,  in  addition,  the<br>
provision of	a large container or storage area below the<br>
seat itself,	big enough to house a small case or a crash<br>
helmet.<br>
•Accordingly there is provided a dampened suspension unit (29) of a motorcycle's (11) rear wheel (18) said dampened suspension unit (29) being connected to a frame (12) and including a first (32) and second (30) shock absorber, where said<br>
»<br>
first shock (32) is connected to a transmission casing (22) and said second shock absorber (30) is connected to a plate (16), which is connected, in turn, at one end to a motor (20) of said motorcycle (11), and at the other end to the rear wheel (18) hub (27), characterized in that said motorcycle (11) frame (12), is thus inclined with respect to an axis of said hub (27) so that it may limit the bulk above said ,rear wheel (18).<br>
Additional  features  and  advantages  of  a  dampened suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar, according to the present invention, will be made more apparent by the following illustrative and non limiting description, referring to the enclosed outline diagrams, in which:<br>
Fig. -i* shows a partial perspective view of a motorcycle with a dampened suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar according to the present invention; Fig. 2 shows a partial perspective view of the motorcycle in Fig. 1, on which the ^storage case is mounted; Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of a rear portion of the .motorcycle  in  Fig.  1,  where  the  storage  case  is represented by the dotted l"fne/ and<br>
Fig.  4  shows a schematic side elevation view of a motorcycle detail according to the present invention. With reference to the Figures mentioned,  a dampened suspension unit  of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar is shown, where the motorcycle, taken as aT~~wh~61e7" is ~ denoted by reference number 11. The motorcycle 11 includes a frame 12 supporting a motor<br><br>
20, in such a way that this can oscillate. A plate 16 is<br>
fixed to the motor 20 at 14 which, in turn, supports the<br>
motorcycle's 11 rear wheel 18 hub 27.<br>
The plate 16 is located along one side of the motorcycle<br>
11 and is placed between the same wheel 18 and the<br>
exhaust 19.<br>
Along the opposite side of the motorcycle 11 to that<br>
where there  is  the plate  16,  instead  is  housed a<br>
transmission unit held by a casing 22, that transfers<br>
motion from the motor 20 to the wheel 18.<br>
The frame 12 is of metallic tube type and includes two<br>
lateral side members 24, 26 which go from the front part<br>
of the motorcycle 11 to its rear end, in line with the<br>
wheel 18, passing over the relative hub 27. The two<br>
lateral side members  24,  26 are shaped and are at<br>
different distances from the hub 27.<br>
In particular, the lateral side member 24 is the nearest<br>
to the hub 27 of the wheel 18 with respect to lateral<br>
side member 26,  so that a tubular cross member 28,<br>
interposed between lateral side members 24 and 26, is<br>
inclined with respect to an axis of the hub 27 so as to<br>
minimise bulk, especially above the rear wheel 18.<br>
The cross member 28 is connected to the support 16 by a<br>
dampened suspension unit 29 which includes two shock<br>
absorbers 30, 32.<br>
A first shock absorber 30 has a pivoted end in a bore 34<br>
of the cross member 28, placed near the lateral side<br>
members 24, with the opposite end pivoted in a bore 36 of<br>
plate 16.<br>
A second shock absorber 32 has one pivoted end in a bore<br>
38 of the cross member 28, placed near the lateral side<br>
member 26 with the opposite end pivoted in a bore 40<br>
joined to the transmission casing 22.<br>
As  is  particularly  apparent  in  Fig.  1,  the  shock<br>
absorbers  30,  32 which are virtually the same,  are<br>
mounted at different heights with respect to hub 27 of<br>
wheel 18, taken as the reference height.<br>
Instead, in Fig. 4 it is apparent how the same shock<br>
absorbers 30, 32 are mounted  in a basically vertical<br>
position with the motorcycle 11 properly upright  and,<br>
although  being  parallel  between  themselves  are  not<br>
mutually aligned. In fact, in Fig. 4 the axes 30a, 32a<br>
respectively, of the shock absorbers 30, 32 are parallel,<br>
but not overlapping. Besides, neither the axes 30a, 32a<br>
of the shock absorbers 30, 32 nor one of their extensions<br>
passes through hub 27.<br>
Above frame 12 is housed a container or storage case 42<br>
fixed to the housing 44 of the same frame 12 by screws or<br>
wing nuts.<br>
Due to the frame's special structure 12, the storage case<br>
42 has a bigger volume and, in particular, has a portion 46 which increases its volume compared to previous solutions, allowing the placing of a case 48 or similar inside it.<br>
The seat is mounted above the storage case 42 (not shown for simplification purposes).<br>
The functioning of the dampened suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar according to the invention is essentially the same as that of traditional suspension units.<br>
Alterations and variations are certainly possible so that, for example, the storage case 42 may be click-fitted to the frame 12 of the motorcycle 11 in the jointed front part while, towards the rear, it may be fixed by screws or wing nuts.<br>
It has basically been confirmed how the dampened suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar, according to the present invention appears especially advantageous since it allows the limiting of bulk above the motorcycle wheel.<br>
The dampened suspension unit of a motorcycle's rear wheel or similar, thus designed, is capable of additional numerous alterations and variations, all coming within :he scope of the invention; besides, all the details may )e substituted by other technically equivalent parts.<br>
In practice, any suitable materials as well as sizes may be used, depending on the technical needs.<br><br><br><br>
