				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel catalyst system,<br>
a novel carbonylation reaction medium and a process for<br>
the carbonylation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds<br>
using a novel catalyst system.<br>
The carbonylation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds<br>
using carbon monoxide in the presence of an alcohol or<br>
water and a catalyst system comprising a Group VIII metal,<br>
eg. palladium, and a phosphine ligand eg. an alkyl<br>
phosphine cycloalkyl phosphine, aryl . _p_hosphine, pyridyl<br>
phosphine or bidentate phosphine, has been described in<br>
numerous European patents and patent applications, eg. EPA-<br>
0055875, EP-A-04489472, EP-A-0106379, EP-A-0235864, EPA-<br>
0274795, EP-A-0499329, EP-A-0386833, EP-A-0441447, EP-A-<br>
0489472, EP-A-0282142, EP-A-0227160, EP-A-0495547 and EPA-<br>
0495548. In particular, EP-A-0227160, EP-A-0495547 and<br>
EP-A-0495548 disclose that bidentate phosphine ligands<br>
provide catalyst systems which enable higher reaction<br>
rates to be achieved.<br>
WO 96/19434 discloses a bridging group in the form of an<br>
optionally substituted aryl moiety, linked to the said<br>
phosphorous atoms via available adjacent carbon atoms on<br>
the said aryl moiety. Such a ligand is more stable and<br>
leads to reaction rates which are significantly higher<br>
than those previously disclosed and produces little or no<br>
impurities for the carbonylation of ethylene. Each<br>
phosphorous atom in the said ligand is also linked to two<br>
tertiary carbon atoms.<br>
However, conventional metal-catalysed reactions, such as<br>
those described in WO 96/19434 tend to suffer from the<br>
drawback that the catalyst tends to de-activate over the<br>
course of a period of continuous operation as the<br>
palladium compound is reduced to palladium metal, this<br>
contributing to the economic viability of the process. <br>
01/10551 addressed this problem via the use of stabilising<br>
compounds such as polymeric dispersants in the reaction<br>
medium, thus improving in the recovery of metal which has<br>
been lost from the catalyst system.<br>
Although catalyst systems have been developed which<br>
exhibit reasonable stability during the carbonylation<br>
process and permit relatively high reaction rates to be<br>
achieved, there still exists a need for improved catalyst<br>
systems. Suitably, the present invention aims to provide<br>
an improved catalyst for carbonylating ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compounds.<br>
J.Mol.Cat.A 204-205 (2003) pgs 295-303 suggests that a<br>
relative increase in the ligand concentration, for example<br>
by the addition of more ligand, has a detrimental effect<br>
on productivity. Similar results are reported in<br>
J.Mol.Cat.A.Chem. 110 (1996) pgs 13-23 and<br>
J.Mol.Cat.A.Chem. 151 (2000) pgs 47-59.<br>
Moreover, WO-A-01/72697 describes a process for the<br>
carbonylation of pentenenitrile but teaches that there are<br>
disadvantages associated at relatively high acid:palladium<br>
ratios. The authors state that the disadvantages occur<br>
because high acid concentration conditions are corrosive<br>
and more ligand degradation results from quaternisation<br>
with the acid and the olefinic compound.<br>
WO-A-01/68583 discloses a process for the carbonylation of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds using phosphine-based<br>
bidentate ligands. However, this disclosure is directed<br>
towards the use of relatively low acid levels, leading to<br>
low acid:ligand values. Moreover, the ligand:metal ratios<br>
are low. WO-A-03/040159 similarly discloses low<br>
acid:ligand and ligand:metal ratios.<br>
WO-A-98/45040 discloses catalyst systems comprising<br>
palladium compound and bidentate phosphorus ligands.<br>
However, acid:ligand ratios of less than 1:1 are taught.<br>
Finally, WO-A-01/72697 discloses a process for the<br>
preparation of a 5-cyanovaleric acid by carbonylation of a<br>
pentenenitrile. The disclosure points out the<br>
disadvantages in using high acid concentrations and<br>
teaches towards the use of relatively low acid levels.<br>
Hence, an aim of the present invention is to seek to<br>
establish a catalyst system wherein the levels of ligand<br>
and acid are relatively high, but wherein the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art noted hereinbefore are<br>
addressed and alleviated, at least to some extent, the<br>
aforesaid being one object of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a<br>
catalyst system, a process for the carbonylation of an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compound, a reaction medium, and<br>
use as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
Preferred features of the invention will be apparent from<br>
the dependent claims, and the description which follows.<br>
According to a first aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a catalyst system capable of catalysing the<br>
carbonylation of an ethylenically unsaturated compound,<br>
which system is obtainable by combining:<br>
a) a metal of Group VIB or Group VIIIB or a compound<br>
thereof,<br>
b) a bidentate phosphine, arsine, or stibine ligand,<br>
preferably a bidentate phosphine ligand, and<br>
c) an acid,<br>
wherein said ligand is present in at least a 2:1 molar<br>
excess compared to said metal or said metal in said metal<br>
compound, and that said acid is present in at least a 2:1<br>
molar excess compared to said ligand.<br>
Typically, component b) is a bidentate phosphine, arsine,<br>
or stibine.<br>
Suitably, all of components a) to c) of the catalyst<br>
system can be added in situ to the reaction vessel wherein<br>
the carbonylation is to take place. Alternatively, the<br>
components a) to c) can be added sequentially in any order<br>
to form the catalyst system, or in some specified order,<br>
either directly into the vessel or outside the vessel and<br>
then added to the vessel. For instance, the acid<br>
component c) may first be added to the bidentate ligand<br>
component b) , to form a protonated ligand, and then the<br>
protonated ligand can be added to the metal or compound<br>
thereof (component a)) to form the catalyst system.<br>
Alternatively, the ligand component b) and metal or<br>
compound thereof (component a)) can be mixed to form a<br>
chelated metal compound, and the acid (component c) ) is<br>
then added. Alternatively, an~y two components can be<br>
reacted together to form an intermediate moiety which is<br>
then either added to the reaction vessel and the third<br>
component added, or is first reacted with the third<br>
component and then added to the rreaction vessel.<br>
As such, the present invention d.s directed to a catalyst<br>
system wherein the relative molar concentrations of both<br>
the bidentate ligand and the add are at levels in excess<br>
of those previously envisaged, .leading to surprising and<br>
unexpected advantages when using the catalyst system in<br>
the carbonylation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds,<br>
and the alleviation or at least ireduction of at least some<br>
of the disadvantages of the prior art systems. In<br>
particular, the use of a catalyst system of the present<br>
invention leads at least to a more stable system,<br>
increased reaction rates, and improved turnover numbers in<br>
carbonylation reactions of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compounds.<br>
As stated above, the ligand is present in the catalyst<br>
system, or precursor thereto, in such quantity that the<br>
ratio of said ligand to the said metal (i.e. component b)<br>
to component a)) is at lea.st a 2:1 molar ratio.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of said ligand to the said metal is<br>
greater than a 2:1 molar ratio, more preferably in the<br>
range 2:1 to 1000:1, even mores preferably in the range<br>
2.5:1 to 1000:1, yet more preferably in the range 3:1 to<br>
1000:1, even more preferably in the range 5:1 to 750:1,<br>
more preferably in the range 7:H to 1000:1, especially in<br>
the range 8:1 to 900:1, still more preferably in the range<br>
10:1 to 500:1, yet still more preferably in the range 20:1<br>
to 400:1, even more preferably in the range 50:1 to 250:1,<br>
most preferably in the range in excess of 50:1, for<br>
example 51:1 and upwards, more specifically 51:1 to 250:1<br>
or even to 1000:1. Alternatively, the said ratio can be<br>
in the range 15:1 to 45:1, preferably 20:1 to 40:1, more<br>
preferably 25:1 to 35:1.<br>
As stated above, the acid is present in the catalyst<br>
system, or precursor thereto, in such quantity that the<br>
ratio of said acid to the said ligand (i.e. component c)<br>
to component b)) is at least a 2:1 molar ratio.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of said acid to the said ligand is<br>
greater than a 2:1 molar ratio, more preferably in the<br>
range 2:1 to 100:1, even more preferably in the range 4:1<br>
to 100:1, yet more preferably in the range 5:1 to 95:1,<br>
still more preferably in the range greater than 5:1 to<br>
95:1, yet more preferably in the range greater than 5:1 to<br>
75:1, more preferably in the range 10:1 to 50:1, even more<br>
preferably in the range 20:1 to 40:1, still more<br>
preferably in the range greater than 20:1 to 40:1 (e.g.<br>
25:1 to 40:1, or 25:1 to less than 30:1), more preferably<br>
in excess of 30:1, suitably with any of the upper limits<br>
provided hereinbefore (e.g. 30:1 to 40:1, or 50:1, etc.),<br>
or more preferably in excess of 35:1, yet more preferably<br>
in excess of 37:1, suitably either with any of the upper<br>
limits provided hereinbefore. Each of the ranges in this<br>
paragraph can be used in conjunction with each of the<br>
ligand to metal ratio ranges disclosed hereinabove, i.e.<br>
ratios of component b) to component a).<br>
By "acid", we mean an acid or salt thereof, and references<br>
to acid should be construed accordingly.<br>
The advantages in working within the ligand to metal, and<br>
acid to ligand ratios, set out above are manifest in that<br>
the stability of the catalyst system is improved, as<br>
evidenced by increases in the turnover number (TON) of the<br>
metal. By improving the stability of the catalyst system,<br>
the usage of metal in the carbonylation reaction scheme is<br>
kept to a minimum.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
by working within the specific ratio ranges noted herein,<br>
it is surprisingly found that the ligand component of the<br>
catalyst system is protected against inadvertent aerial<br>
oxidation (in instances where there is any ingress of air<br>
into the reaction system), and the overall stability of<br>
the catalyst system is improved, thus keeping the usage of<br>
the metal component of the catalyst system to a minimum.<br>
Moreover, the forward reaction rate of the reaction is<br>
surprisingly improved.<br>
In effect, the level of acid should be such that for the<br>
particular bidentate ligand employed, the level of acid<br>
should be such that phosphine, arsine or stibine is fully<br>
protonated. Hence, to show the improved effects, the<br>
level of ligand should be above some, minimum level, as<br>
given by the ligand:metal molar ratio, and the level of<br>
acid should be above some minimum level with respect to<br>
the level of ligand present to encourage protonation, as<br>
given by the acid:ligand molar ratio.<br>
Preferably, the acid is present in the catalyst system, or<br>
precursor thereto, in such quantity that the molar ratio<br>
of said acid to said metal (i.e. component c) to component<br>
a)) is at least 4:1, more preferably from 4:1 to 100000:1,<br>
even more preferably 10:1 to 75000:1, yet more preferably<br>
20:1 to 50000:1, yet still more preferably 25:1 to<br>
50000:1, yet still more preferably 30:1 to 50000:1, yet<br>
even more preferably 40:1 to 40000:1, still more<br>
preferably 100:1 to 25000:1, more preferably 120:1 to<br>
25000:1, more preferably 140:1 to 25000:1, yet still more<br>
preferably 200:1 to 25000:1, most preferably 550:1 to<br>
20000:1, or greater than 2000:1 to 20000:1.<br>
Alternatively, the said ratio can be in the range 125:1 to<br>
485:1, more preferably 150:1 to 450:1, even more<br>
preferably 175:1 to 425:1, yet even more preferably 200:1<br>
to 400:1, most preferably 225:1 to 375:1. Each of these<br>
ranges in this paragraph can be used in conjunction with<br>
each of the ligand to metal ratio ranges disclosed<br>
hereinabove, i.e. ratios of component b) to component a),<br>
and/or each of the acid to ligand ratio ranges disclosed<br>
hereinabove, i.e. ratios of component c) to component b).<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, .all of the aforementioned<br>
ratios and ratio ranges apply to all of the ligand<br>
embodiments set out in more detail hereinafter.<br>

The term wAr" or "aryl" when used herein, includes<br>
five-to-ten-membered, preferably, six-to-ten membered<br>
carbocyclic aromatic groups, such as phenyl and naphthyl,<br>

Substitution at Het may be at a carbon atom of the Het<br>
ring or, where appropriate, at one or more of the<br>

cyclopentadienyl rings, two indenyl rings or one indenyl<br>
and one cyclopentadienyl ring (each of which ring systems<br>
may optionally be substituted as described herein). Such<br>
compounds may be referred to as "sandwich compounds" as<br>
the metal M or metal cation thereof is sandwiched by the<br>
two ring systems. The respective cyclopentadienyl and/or<br>
indenyl ring systems may be substantially coplanar with<br>
respect to each other or they may be tilted with respect<br>
to each other (commonly referred to as bent metallocenes) .<br>
Alternatively, when n = 1 and LI represents aryl, the<br>
compounds of the invention may contain either one<br>
cyclopentadienyl or one indenyl ring (each of which ring<br>
systems may optionally be substituted as described herein)<br>
and one aryl ring which is optionally substituted as<br>
defined herein. Suitably, when n = 1 and LI represents<br>
aryl then the metal M of the compounds of formula III as<br>
defined herein is typically in the form of the metal<br>
cation.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in a compound of formula III, n = 1, LI is as<br>

indenyl or aryl ring which LI may represent is bonded<br>
directly to the cyclopentadienyl ring of the ferrocenyl<br>
group), wherein R19 to R30 is as defined herein. More<br>
preferably, if the cyclopentadienyl, indenyl or aryl ring<br>
which LI may represent is substituted it is preferably<br>
substituted with one or more substituents selected from<br>
unsubstituted Ci-C6 alkyl, halo, cyano, -OR19, -OC(0)R20,<br>

and R24 each independently represent hydrogen or Ci-Ce<br>
alkyl. Even more preferably, if the cyclopentadienyl,<br>
indenyl or aryl ring which LI may represent is<br>
substituted, it is preferably substituted with one or more<br>
substituents selected from unsubstituted Ci-Ce alkyl.<br>
Preferably, when n = 1, LI represents cyclopentadienyl,<br>
indenyl, phenyl or napthyl optionally substituted as<br>
defined herein. Preferably, the cyclopentadienyl, indenyl,<br>
phenyl or napthyl groups are unsubstituted. More<br>

Alternatively, when n = 0, the compounds of the invention<br>
contain only one cyclopentadienyl or indenyl ring (each of<br>
which ring systems may optionally be substituted as<br>
described herein) . Such compounds may be referred to as<br>
"half sandwich compounds". Preferably, when n = 0 then m<br>
represents 1 to 5 so that the metal M of the compounds of<br>
formula III has an 18 electron count. In other words, when<br>
metal M of the compounds of formula III is iron, the total<br>
number of electrons contributed by the ligands La is<br>
typically five.<br>
In a particularly preferred alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention, in a compound of formula III, n = 0, La<br>
is as defined herein and m = 3 or 4, particularly 3.<br>
Preferably, when n is equal to zero and m is not equal to<br>
zero in a compound of formula III, L2 represents one or<br>
more ligands each of which are independently selected from<br>
lower alkyl, halo, -CO, -P (R43) (R44) R45 or -N (R46) (R47) R48.<br>
More preferably, L2 represents one or more ligands each of<br>
which are independently selected from unsubstituted Ci to<br>

selected from hydrogen, unsubstituted Ci to Ce alkyl or<br>
aryl, such as phenyl.<br>
Suitably, the metal M or metal cation thereof in the<br>
compounds of formula III is typically bonded to the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring(s), the cyclopentadienyl moiety of<br>
the indenyl ring(s) if present, the aryl ring if present,<br>
and/or the ligands L2 if present. Typically, the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring or the cyclopentadienyl moiety of<br>
the indenyl ring exhibits a pentahapto bonding mode with<br>
the metal; however other bonding modes between the<br>
cyclopentadienyl ring or cyclopentadienyl moiety of the<br>
indenyl ring and the metal, such as trihapto coordination,<br>
are also embraced by the scope of the present invention.<br>
Most preferably, in a compound of formula III, n = l, m =<br>
0 and LI is defined herein, particularly unsubstituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl.<br>
Preferably M represents a Group VIB or VIIIB metal. In<br>
other words the total electron count for the metal M is<br>
18.<br>
Preferably, in the compound of formula III, M represents<br>
Cr, Mo, Fe, Co or Ru, or a metal cation thereof. Even more<br>
preferably, M represents Cr, Fe, Co or Ru or a metal<br>
cation thereof. Most preferably, M is selected from a<br>
Group VIIIB metal or metal cation thereof. An especially<br>
preferred Group VIIIB metal is Fe. Although the metal M as<br>

person in the art would appreciate that other bidentate<br>
ligands can be envisaged without departing from the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a catalyst system capable of catalysing the<br>
carbonylation of an ethylenically unsaturated compound,<br>
said system comprising:<br>
a) a metal of Group VIB or Group VII IB or a compound<br>
thereof,<br>
b) a bidentate phosphine, arsine, or stibine ligand,<br>
preferably a bidentate phosphine ligand, and<br>
c) an acid,<br>
wherein said ligand is present in at least a 2:1 molar<br>
excess compared to said metal or said metal in said metal<br>
compound, and that said acid is present in at least a 2:1<br>
molar excess compared to said ligand.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is hereby stated that<br>
any of the features and embodiments described hereinbefore<br>
are equally applicable to this aspect.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a process for the carbonylation of an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compound comprising contacting<br>
an ethylenically unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide<br>
and a hydroxyl group containing compound in the presence<br>
of a catalyst system as defined in the present invention,<br>
such as defined in the first aspect of the present<br>
invention. Preferably, the process is a liquid phase<br>
continuous process comprising the step noted above.<br>
Nevertheless, although the process is preferably operated<br>
continuously, batch operation is possible.<br>
According to a yet further aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a process for the carbonylation of an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compound comprising contacting<br>
an ethylenically unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide<br>
and a hydroxyl group containing compound in the presence<br>
of a catalyst system, said system comprising:<br>
a) a metal of Group VIB or Group VII IB or a compound<br>
thereof,<br>
b) a bidentate phosphine, arsine, or stibine ligand,<br>
preferably a bidentate phosphine ligand, and<br>
c) an acid,<br>
wherein said ligand is present in at least a 2:1 molar<br>
excess compared to said metal or said metal in said metal<br>
compound, and that said acid is present in at least a 2:1<br>
molar excess compared to said ligand.<br>
Suitably, the hydroxyl group containing compound includes<br>
water or an organic molecule having a hydroxyl functional<br>
group. Preferably, the organic molecule having a hydroxyl<br>
functional group may be branched or linear, and comprises<br>
an alkanol, particularly a Ci-Cao alkanol, including aryl<br>
alkanols, which may be optionally substituted with one or<br>
more substituents selected from lower alkyl, aryl, Het,<br>
halo, cyano, nitro, OR19, OC(O)R20, C(0)R21, C(0)OR22,<br>
NR23R24, C(0)NR25R26, C(S)R25R26, SR27 or C(0)SR28 as defined<br>
herein. Highly preferred alkanols are Ci-Ce alkanols such<br>
as methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol,<br>
t-butyl alcohol, n-butanol, phenol and chlorocapryl<br>
alcohol. Although the monoalkanols are most preferred,<br>
poly-alkanols r preferably, selected from di-octa ols such<br>
as diols, txiols, tetra-ols and sugars may also be<br>
utilised. Typically, such polyalkanols are selected from<br>
1, 2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, 1,2,4<br>
butanetriol, 2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, 1,2,6<br>
trihydroxyhexane, pentaerythri tol, 1,1,1<br>
tri(hydroxymethyl) ethane, nannose, sorbase, galactose and<br>
other sugars. Preferred sugars include sucrose, fructose<br>
and glucose. Especially preferred alkanols are methanol<br>
and ethanol. The most preferred alkanol is methanol.<br>
The amount of alcohol is not critical. Generally, amounts<br>
are used in excess of the amount of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compound to be carbonylated. Thus the alcohol<br>
may serve as the reaction solvent as well, although, if<br>
desired, separate solvents may also be used.<br>
It will be appreciated that the end product of the<br>
reaction is determined at least in part by the source of<br>
hydroxyl group containing compound used. If water is used<br>
as the hydroxyl group containing compound then the end<br>
product is the corresponding carboxylic acid, whereas use<br>
of an alkanol produces the corresponding ester.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the process of the<br>
present invention may start with a catalyst system having<br>
components providing molar ratios above or below those<br>
claimed but such ratios will progress to values within<br>
said ranges claimed during the course of the reaction.<br>
It will of course also be appreciated that the levels of<br>
such components present within the catalyst system may<br>
change during the process of the invention as further<br>
amounts off some or all of the components are added to<br>
maintain the usable levels of components within the<br>
catalyst system. Some of the components of the catalyst<br>
system may drop out of the system during the reaction<br>
process and therefore levels may need to be topped-up to<br>
maintain levels within the actual catalyst system.<br>
As stated hereinbefore, it will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art that the phosphines described herein<br>
may function as ligands that coordinate with the Group VIB<br>
or Group VIIIB metal or compound, together with the<br>
present acid, to form a complex. This complex may<br>
represent part of the effective catalyst in the present<br>
invention and hence may represent part of the catalyst<br>
system defined herein.<br>
Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides<br>
a complex capable of catalysing the carbonylation of an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compound, said complex<br>
obtainable by combining:<br>
a) a metal of Group VIB or Group VII IB or a compound<br>
thereof,<br>
b) a bidentate phosphine, arsine, or stibine ligand,<br>
preferably a bidentate phosphine ligand, and<br>
c) an acid,<br>
wherein said ligand is present in at least a 2:1 molar<br>
excess compared to said metal or said metal in said metal<br>
compound, and that said acid is present in at least a 2:1<br>
molar excess compared to said ligand.<br>
In a yet further aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
process for the carbonylation of an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and a hydroxyl<br>
group containing compound in the presence of a complex,<br>
said complex as defined above.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, the<br>
carbon monoxide may be used in pure form or diluted with<br>
an inert gas such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide or a noble<br>
gas such as argon. Small amounts of hydrogen, typically<br>
less than 5% by volume, may also be present.<br>
The ratio (volume/volume) of ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compound to hydroxyl group containing compound may vary<br>
between wide limits and suitably lies in the range of<br>
1:0.1 to 1:10, preferably from between 2:1 to 1:2 and up<br>
to a large excess of hydroxyl group containing compounds<br>
when the latter is also the reaction solvent such as up to<br>
a 50:1 excess of hydroxyl group containing compounds.<br>
The mqlar ratio of the ethylenically unsaturated compound<br>
to carbon monoxide is preferably in the range 1:1 to 100:1<br>
more preferably greater than 1:1, even more preferably at<br>
least 3:1, especially from 3:1 to 50:1, and most<br>
preferably in the range from 3:1 to 15:1.<br>
The amount of the catalyst of the invention used in the<br>
carbonylation process of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compound is not critical. Good results may be obtained<br>
when, preferably, the amount of Group VIB or VIIIB metal<br>
is in the range 10"7 to 10"1 moles per mole of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compound, more preferably, 10~6<br>
to 10~2 moles, most preferably 10"5 to 10~2 moles per mole<br>
of ethylenically unsaturated compound. Preferably, the<br>
amount of bidentate compound of formula I or formula III<br>
to unsaturated compound is in the range 10"7 to 10"1, more<br>
preferably, 10~6 to 10"2, most preferably, 10~5 to 10"2<br>
moles per mole of ethylenically unsaturated compound.<br>
Suitably, although non-essential to the invention, the<br>
carbonylation of an ethylenically unsaturated compound as<br>
defined herein may be performed in one or more aprotic<br>
solvents. Suitable solvents include ketones, such as for<br>
example methylbutylketone; ethers, such as for example<br>
anisole (methyl phenyl ether), 2,5,8-trioxanonane<br>
(diglyme), diethyl ether, dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
diphenylether, diisopropylether and the dimethylether of<br>
di-ethylene-glycol; esters, such as for example<br>
methylacetate, dimethyladipate methyl benzoate, dimethyl<br>
phthalate and butyrolactone; amides, such as for example<br>
dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and dimethyl<br>
formamide; sulfoxides and sulphones, such as for example<br>
dimethylsulphoxide, di-isopropylsulphone, sulfolane<br>
(tetrahydrothiophene-2,2-dioxide), 2-methylsulfolane,<br>
diethyl sulphone, tetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide and 2-<br>
methyl-4-ethylsulfolane; aromatic compounds, including<br>
halo variants of such compounds eg. benzene, toluene,<br>
ethyl benzene o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, chlorobenzene,<br>
o-dichlorobenzene, m-dichlorobenzene: alkanes, including<br>
halo variants of such compounds eg, hexane, heptane,<br>
2,2,3-trimethylpentane, methylene chloride and carbon<br>
tetrachloride; nitriles eg. benzonitrile and acetonitrile.<br>
Very suitable are aprotic solvents having a dielectric<br>
constant that is below a value of 50, more preferably in<br>
the range of 3 to 8, at 298.15 K and 1 x 105Nm"2. In the<br>
present context, the dielectric constant for a given<br>
solvent is used in its normal meaning of representing the<br>
ratio of the capacity of a condenser with that substance<br>
as dielectric to the capacity of the same condenser with a<br>
vacuum for dielectric. Values for the dielectric constants<br>
of common organic liquids can be found in general<br>
reference books, such as the Handbook of Chemistry and<br>
Physics, 76th edition, edited by David R. Lide et al, and<br>
published by CRC press in 1995, and are usually quoted for<br>
a temperature of about 20°C or 25°C, i.e. about 293.15k or<br>
298.15 K, and atmospheric pressure, i.e. about 1 x 105Nm~2,<br>
or can readily be converted to that temperature and<br>
pressure using the conversion factors quoted. If no<br>
literature data for a particular compound is available,<br>
the dielectric constant may be readily measured using<br>
established physico-chemical methods.<br>
For example, the dielectric constant of anisole is 4.3 (at<br>
294.2 K), of diethyl ether is 4.3 (at 293.2 K) , of<br>
sulfolane is 43.4 (at 303.2 K), of methylpentanoate is 5.0<br>
(at 293.2 K), of diphenylether is 3.7 (at 283.2 K), of<br>
dimethyladipate is 6.8 (at 293.2 K), off tetrahydrofuran is<br>
7.5 (at 295.2 K), of methylnonanoate is 3.9 (at 293.2 K) .<br>
A preferred solvent is anisole.<br>
If the hydroxyl group containing compound is an alkanol,<br>
an aprotic solvent will be generated by the reaction as<br>
the ester carbonylation product of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compound, carbon monoxide and the alkanol is<br>
an aprotic solvent.<br>
The process may be carried out in an excess of aprotic<br>
solvent, i.e. at a ratio (v/v) of aprotic solvent to<br>
hydroxyl group containing compound of at least 1:1.<br>
Preferably, this ratio ranges from 1:1 to 10:1 and more<br>
preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. Most preferably the ratio<br>
(v/v) ranges from 1.5:1 to 3:1.<br>
Despite the aforegoing it is preferred that the reaction<br>
is carried out in the absence of any external added<br>
aprotic solvent ie. an aprotic solvent not generated by<br>
the reaction itself.<br>
The catalyst compounds of the present invention may act as<br>
a "heterogeneous" catalyst or a "homogeneous" catalyst.<br>
By the term "homogeneous" catalyst we mean a catalyst,<br>
i.e. a compound of the invention, which is not supported<br>
but is simply admixed or formed in-situ with the reactants<br>
of the carbonylation reaction (e.g. the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compound, the hydroxyl containing compound and<br>
carbon monoxide) , preferably in a suitable solvent as<br>
described herein.<br>
By the term "heterogeneous" talyst we mean a catalyst,<br>
i.e. the compound of the invasion, which is carried on a<br>
support.<br>
Thus according to a further aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a process for the carbonylation of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compounds as defined herein wherein the<br>
process is carried out with the catalyst comprising a<br>
support, preferably an insoluble support.<br>
Preferably, the support comprises a polymer such as a<br>
polyolefin, polystyrene or polystyrene copolymer such as a<br>
divinylbenzene copolymer or other suitable polymers or<br>
copolymers known to those skilled in the art; a silicon<br>
derivative such as a functionalised silica, a silicone or<br>
a silicone rubber; or other porous particulate material<br>
such as for example inorganic oxides and inorganic<br>
chlorides.<br>
Preferably the support material is porous silica which has<br>
a surface area in the range of from 10 to 700 m2/g, a<br>
total pore volume in the range of from 0.1 to 4.0 cc/g and<br>
an average particle size in the range of from 10 to SOOjum.<br>
More preferably, the surface area is in the range of from<br>
50 to 500 m2/g, the pore volume is in the range of from<br>
0.5 to 2.5 cc/g and the average particle size is in the<br>
range of from 20 to 200 JOTI. Most desirably the surface<br>
area is in the range of from 100 to 400 m2/g, tine pore<br>
volume is in the range of from 0.8 to 3.0 cc/g and the<br>
average particle size is in the range of from 30 to 100<br>
um. The average pore size of typical porous support<br>
materials is in the range of from 10 to 1000 A.<br>
Preferably, a support material is used that has an average<br>
pore diameter of from 50 to 500 A, and most desirably from<br>
75 to 350 A. It may be particularly desirable to dehydrate<br>
the silica at a temperature of from 100°C to 800°C<br>
anywhere from 3 to 24 hours.<br>
Suitably, the support may be flexible or a rigid support,<br>
the insoluble support is coated and/or impregnated with<br>
the compounds of the process of the invention by<br>
techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the process of the<br>
invention are fixed to the surface of an insoluble<br>
support, optionally via a covalent bond, and the<br>
arrangement optionally includes a bifunctional spacer<br>
molecule to space the compound from the insoluble support.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be fixed to the surface<br>
of the insoluble support by promoting reaction of a<br>
functional group present in the compound of formula I or<br>
III, for example a substituent K, D, Z and E (or: K1, D1<br>
and E1) of the aryl moiety, with a complimentary rreactive<br>
group present on or previously inserted into the support.<br>
The combination of the reactive group of the support with<br>
a complimentary substituent of the compound of the<br>
invention provides a heterogeneous catalyst where the<br>
compound of the invention and the support are linked via a<br>
linkage such as an ether, ester, amide, amine, urea, keto<br>
group.<br>
The choice of reaction conditions to link a compound of<br>
the process of the present invention to the support depend<br>
upon the ethylenically unsaturated compound and the groups<br>
of the support. For example, reagents such as<br>
ca rbodi imi des, 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole, and processes<br>
such as the use of mixed anhydrides, reductive amination<br>
may be employed.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention<br>
provides the use of the process of any aspect of the<br>
invention wherein the catalyst is attached to a support.<br>
Conveniently, the process of the invention may be carried<br>
out by dissolving the Group VIB or VIIIB metal or compound<br>
thereof as defined herein in a suitable solvent such as<br>
one of the hydroxyl group containing compounds or aprotic<br>
solvents previously described (a particularly preferred<br>
solvent would be the ester or acid product of the specific<br>
carbonylation reaction e.g. Methyl propionate for ethylene<br>
carbonylation) and subsequently admixing with a compound<br>
of formula I or III as defined herein and an acid.<br>
The carbon monoxide may be used in the presence of other<br>
gases which are inert in the reaction. Examples of such<br>
gases include hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the<br>
noble gases such as argon.<br>
Suitable Group VIB or VIIIB metals or a compound thereof<br>
which may be combined with a compound of formula I or III<br>
include cobalt, nickel, palladium, rhodium, platinum,<br>
chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, preferably include<br>
cobalt, nickel, palladium, rhodium and platinum.<br>
Preferably, component a) is a Group VIIIB metal or a<br>
compound thereof. Preferably, the metal is a Group VIIIB<br>
metal, such as palladium. Preferably, the Group VIIIB<br>
metal is palladium or a compound thereof. Thus, component<br>
a) is preferably palladium or a compound thereof.<br>
Suitable compounds of such Group VIB or VIIIB metals<br>
include salts of such metals with, or compounds comprising<br>
weakly coordinated anions derived from, nitric acid;<br>
sulphuric acid; lower alkanoic (up to .Cia) acids such as<br>
acetic acid and propionic acid; sulphonic acids such as<br>
methane sulphonic acid, chlorosulphonic acid,<br>
fluorosulphonic acid, trifluoromethane sulphonic acid,<br>
benzene sulphonic acid, naphthalene sulphonic acid,<br>
toluene sulphonic acid, e.g. p-toluene sulphonic acid, tbutyl<br>
sulphonic acid, and 2-hydroxypropane sulphonic acid;<br>
sulphonated ion exchange resins; perhalic acid such as<br>
perchloric acid; ; halogenated carboxylic acids such as<br>
trichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid;<br>
orthophosphoric acid; phosphonic acids such as<br>
benzenephosphonic acid; and acids derived from<br>
interactions between Lewis acids and Broensted acids.<br>
Other sources which may provide suitable anions include<br>
the optionally halogenated tetraphenyl borate derivatives,<br>
e.g. perfluorotetraphenyl borate. Additionally, zero<br>
valent palladium complexes particularly those with labile<br>
ligands, e.g. triphenylphosphine or alkenes such as<br>
dibenzylideneacetone or styrene or<br>
tri(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium may be used.<br>
Nevertheless, an acid is present in the catalyst system as<br>
set out hereinbefore, even if other sources of anion such<br>
as those noted above are also present.<br>
Thus, the acid is selected from an acid having a pKa<br>
measured in aqueous solution at 18°C of less than 4, more<br>
preferably less than 3, most prefer-ably less than 2.<br>
Suitable acids include the acids listed supra.<br>
Preferably, the acid is not a carboxylic acid, more<br>
preferably the acid is either a sulprionic acid, or some<br>
other non-carboxylic acid such as those selected from the<br>
list consisting of perchloric acid,, phosphoric acid,<br>
methyl phosphonic acid, sulphuric acid, and sulphonic<br>
acids, even more preferably a sulphonic acid or other noncarboxylic<br>
acid (selected from the li_st above) having a<br>
pKa measured in aqueous solution at 1 8°C of less than 2,<br>
yet even more preferably a sulphonic acid having a pKa<br>
measured in aqueous solution at 18°C off less than 2, still<br>
more preferably the acid is selected from the list<br>
consisting of the following sulphonic acids:<br>
methanesulphonic acid, trifluoromethaanesulphonic acid,<br>
tert-butanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, 2-<br>
hydroxypropane-2-sulphonic acid, and 2,4,6-<br>
trimethylbenzenesulphonic acid, most preferably the acid<br>
is methanesulphonic acid.<br>
As mentioned, the catalyst system of the present<br>
invention may be used homogeneously or heterogeneously.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst system is used homogeneously.<br>
The catalyst system of the present invention is<br>
preferably constituted in the liquid phase which may be<br>
formed by one or more of the reactants or by the use of a<br>
suitable solvent.<br>
The molar ratio of the amount of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated compound used in the reaction to the amount of<br>
hydroxyl providing compound is not critical and may vary<br>
between wide limits, e.g. from 0.001:1 to 100:1 mol/mol.<br>
The product of the carbonylation reaction using the<br>
ligand of the invention may be separated from the other<br>
components by any suitable means. However, it is an<br>
advantage of the present process that significantly fewer<br>
by-products are formed thereby reducing the need for<br>
further purification after the initial separation of the<br>
product as may be evidenced by the generally significantly<br>
higher selectivity. A further advantage is that the other<br>
components which contain the catalyst system which may be<br>
recycled and/or reused in further reactions with minimal<br>
supplementation of fresh catalyst.<br>
Preferably, the carbonylation is carried out at a<br>
temperature of between -10 to 150°C, more preferably 0°C<br>
to 140°C, even more preferably 15°C to 140°C, most<br>
preferably 20°C to 120°C. An especially preferred<br>
temperature is one chosen between 80°C to 120°C.<br>
Advantageously/ the carbonylation can be carried out at<br>
moderate temperatures, it is particularly advantageous to<br>
be able to carry out the reaction at room temperature<br>
(20°C) .<br>
Preferably, when operating a low temperature<br>
carbonylation, the carbonylation is carried out between -<br>
30°C to 49°C, more preferably, -10°C to 45°C, still more<br>
preferably 0°C to 45°C, even more preferably 10°C to 45°C,<br>
most preferably 15°C to 45°C. Especially preferred is a<br>
range of 15 to 35°C.<br>
Preferably, the carbonylation is carried out at a CO<br>
partial pressure of between 0.80 x 105 N.m~2-90 x 105N.m"2,<br>
more preferably 1 x 105 N.m~2-65 x 105N.m~2, most preferably<br>
1-30 x 105 N.m"2. Especially preferred is a CO partial<br>
pressure of 5 to 20 x 105N.nf2.<br>
Preferably, a low pressure carbonylation is also<br>
envisaged. Preferably, when operating a low pressure<br>
carbonylation the carbonylation is carried out at a CO<br>
partial pressure of between 0.1 to 5 x 105N.m~2, more<br>
preferably 0.2 to 2 x 105N.m~2, most preferably 0.5 to 1.5<br>
x 105N.m~2.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated compounds may be substituted<br>
or non-substituted with groups as defined above for the<br>
"aryl" group above. Particularly suitable substituents<br>
include alkyl and aryl groups as well as groups containing<br>
heteroatoms such as halides, sulphur, phosphorus, oxygen<br>
and nitrogen. Examples of substituents include chloride,<br>
bromide, iodide and hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, amino,<br>
amido, nitro, cyano, thiol or thioalkoxy groups. Suitable<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds include ethene,<br>
propene, hexene, vinyl compounds such as vinyl acetates,<br>
heptene, octene, nonene, decene, undecene, dodecene, etc<br>
up to Cao, i.e. having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, which<br>
may be linear or branched, cyclic or uncyclic or part<br>
cyclic and in which the double bond may take any suitable<br>
position in the carbon chain and which includes all<br>
stereisomers thereof.<br>
Moreover, the unsaturated compound may have one or more<br>
unsaturated bonds and therefore, for example, the range of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds extends to dienes.<br>
The unsaturated bond(s) may be internal or terminal, the<br>
catalyst system of the invention being particularly<br>
advantageous in the conversion of internal olefins.<br>
Particularly preferred are olefins having from 2 to 22<br>
carbon atoms per molecule, such as ethene, propene, 1-<br>
butene, 2-butene, isobutene, pentenes, hexenes, octenes,<br>
e.g. oct-2-ene, oct-3-ene, oct-4-ene, decenes and<br>
dodecenes, triisobutylene, tripropylene, internal Cn<br>
olefins, and internal Cis-Cie olefins, 1,5-cyclooctadiene,<br>
cyclododecene, methyl pentenoate and pentene nitriles,<br>
e.g. pent-2-ene nitrile.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated compound is preferably an<br>
alkene having 1 to 3 carbon-carbon double bonds per<br>
molecule. Non-limiting examples of suitable dienes<br>
include the following: 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-l,3-<br>
butadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 2,4-<br>
heptadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, particularly<br>
1,3-butadiene.<br>
Another preferred category of unsaturated compounds<br>
consists of unsaturated esters of carboxylic acids and<br>
esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids. For example, the<br>
starting material may be a vinyl ester of a carboxylic<br>
acid such as acetic acid or propanoic acid, or it may be<br>
an alkyl ester of an unsaturated acid, such as the methyl<br>
or ethyl ester of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.<br>
A further preferred category of unsaturated compounds<br>
consists of cycloalkadienes, which will ordinarily refuse<br>
carbonylation. For example, the starting material may be<br>
dicyclopentadiene or norbornadiene, to give diesters,<br>
diamides or diacids, etc., which may find subsequent use<br>
as monomers in polymerisation reactions.<br>
The use of stabilising compounds with the catalyst system<br>
may also be beneficial in improving recovery of metal<br>
which has been lost from the catalyst system. When the<br>
catalyst system is utilized in a liquid reaction medium<br>
such stabilizing compounds may assist recovery of the<br>
Group VI or VIIIB metal.<br>
Preferably, therefore, the catalyst system includes in a<br>
liquid reaction medium a polymeric dispersant dissolved in<br>
a liquid carrier, said polymeric dispersant being capable<br>
of stabilising a colloidal suspension of particles of the<br>
Group VI or VIIIB metal or metal compound of the catalyst<br>
system within the liquid carrier.<br>
The liquid reaction medium may be a solvent for the<br>
reaction or may comprise one or more of the reactants or<br>
reaction products themselves. The reactants and reaction<br>
products in liquid form may be miscible with or dissolved<br>
in a solvent or liquid diluent.<br>
The polymeric dispersant is soluble in the liquid reaction<br>
medium, but should not significantly increase the<br>
viscosity of the reaction medium in a way which would be<br>
detrimental to reaction kinetics or heat transfer. The<br>
solubility of the dispersant in the liquid medium under<br>
the reaction conditions of temperature and pressure should<br>
not be so great as to deter significantly the adsorption<br>
of the dispersant molecules onto the metal particles.<br>
The polymeric dispersant is capable of stabilising a<br>
colloidal suspension of particles of said Group VI or<br>
VIIIB metal or metal compound within the liquid reaction<br>
medium such that the metal particles formed as a result of<br>
catalyst degradation are held in suspension in the liquid<br>
reaction medium and are discharged from the reactor along<br>
with the liquid for reclamation and optionally for re-use<br>
in making further quantities of catalyst. The metal<br>
particles are normally of colloidal dimensions, e.g. in<br>
the range 5 - 100 run average particle size although larger<br>
particles may form in some cases. Portions of the<br>
polymeric dispersant are adsorbed onto the surface of the<br>
metal particles whilst the remainder of the dispersant<br>
molecules remain at least partially solvated by the liquid<br>
reaction medium and in this way the dispersed Group VI or<br>
VIIIB metal particles are stabilised against settling on<br>
the walls of the reactor or in reactor dead spaces and<br>
against forming agglomerates of metal particles which may<br>
grow by collision of particles and eventually coagulate.<br>
Some agglomeration of particles may occur even in the<br>
presence of a suitable dispersant but when the dispersant<br>
type and concentration is optimised then such<br>
agglomeration should be at a relatively low level and the<br>
agglomerates may form only loosely so that they may be<br>
broken up and the particles redispersed by agitation.<br>
The polymeric dispersant may include homopolymers or<br>
copolymers including polymers such as graft copolymers and<br>
star polymers.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric dispersant has sufficiently<br>
acidic or basic functionality to substantially stabilise<br>
the colloidal suspension of said Group VI or VIIIB metal<br>
or metal compound.<br>
By substantially stabilise is meant that the precipitation<br>
of the Group VI or VIIIB metal from the solution phase is<br>
substantially avoided.<br>
Particularly preferred dispersants for this purpose<br>
include acidic or basic polymers including carboxylic<br>
acids, sulphonic acids, amines and amides such as<br>
polyacrylates or heterocycle, particularly nitrogen<br>
heterocycle, substituted polyvinyl polymers such as<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone or copolymers of the aforesaid.<br>
Examples of such polymeric dispersants may be selected<br>
from polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylamide,<br>
polyacrylonitrile, polyethylenimine, polyglycine,<br>
polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, poly(3-<br>
hydroxybutyricacid), poly-L-leucine, poly-L-methionine,<br>
poly-L-proline, . poly-L-serine, poly-L-tyrosine,<br>
poly(vinylbenzenesulphonic acid) and poly(vinylsulphonic<br>
acid).<br>
Preferably, the polymeric dispersant incorporates acidic<br>
or basic moieties either pendant or within the polymer<br>
backbone. Preferably, the acidic moieties have a<br>
dissociation constant (pKa) of less than 6.0, more<br>
preferably, less than 5.0, most preferably less than 4.5.<br>
Preferably, the basic moieties have a base dissociation<br>
constant (pKb) being of less than 6.0, more preferably<br>
less than 5.0 and most preferably less than 4.5, pKa and<br>
pKb being measured in dilute aqueous solution at 25°C.<br>
Suitable polymeric dispersants, in addition to being<br>
soluble in the reaction medium at reaction conditions,<br>
contain at least one acidic or basic moiety, either within<br>
the polymer backbone or as a pendant group. We have found<br>
that polymers incorporating acid and amide moieties such<br>
as polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP) and polyacrylates such as<br>
polyacrylic acid (PAA) are particularly suitable. The<br>
molecular weight of the polymer which is suitable for use<br>
in the invention depends upon the nature of the reaction<br>
medium and the solubility of the polymer therein. We have<br>
found that normally the average molecular weight is less<br>
than 100,000. Preferably, the average molecular weight is<br>
in the range 1,000 - 200,000, more preferably, 5,000 -<br>
100,000, most preferably, 10,000 - 40,000 e.g. Mw is<br>
preferably in the range 10,000 - 80,000, more preferably<br>
20,000 - 60,000 when PVP is used and of the order of 1,000<br>
- 10,000 in the case of PAA.<br>
The effective concentration of the dispersant within the<br>
reaction medium should be determined for each<br>
reaction/catalyst system which is to be used.<br>
The dispersed Group VI or VIIIB metal may be recovered<br>
from the liquid stream removed from the reactor e.g. by<br>
filtration and then either disposed of or processed for<br>
re-use as a catalyst or other applications. In a<br>
continuous process the liquid stream may be circulated<br>
through an external heat-exchanger and in such cases it<br>
may be convenient to locate filters for the palladium<br>
particles in these circulation apparatus.<br>
Preferably, the polymer:metal mass ratio in g/g is between<br>
1:1 and 1000:1, more preferably, between 1:1 and 400:1,<br>
most preferably, between 1:1 and 200:1. Preferably, the<br>
polymer :metal mass ratio in g/g is up to 1000, more<br>
preferably, up to 400, most preferably, up to 200.<br>

The following examples further illustrate the present<br>
invention. These examples are to be viewed as being<br>
illustrative of specific materials falling within the<br>
broader disclosure presented above and are not to be<br>
viewed as limiting the broader disclosure in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of 1,2 bis (diadamantylphosphinomethyl) benzene<br>
1,2 bis(diadamantylphosphinomethyl) benzene<br>
(Method 1)<br>
The preparation of this ligand was carried out as follows.<br>
1.1 Preparation of (1-Ad) 2P (O) Cl<br>
Phosphorous trichloride (83 cm3, 0.98 mol) was added<br>
rapidly via cannula to a combination of aluminium chloride<br>
(25.0 g, 0.19 mol) and adamantane (27.2 g, 0.20 mol)<br>
affording a tan suspension. The reaction was heated to<br>
reflux. After 10 mins, a yellow-orange suspension was<br>
formed. The reaction was refluxed for a total of 6 h. The<br>
excess PCla was removed by distillation at atmospheric<br>
pressure (BP 75 °C). On cooling to ambient temperature, an<br>
orange solid was formed. Chloroform (250 cm3) was added<br>
yielding an orange suspension, which was cooled to 0 °C.<br>
Water (150 cm3) was added slowly: initially the suspension<br>
viscosity increased, but on full addition of water the<br>
viscosity lessened. From this point the reaction was no<br>
longer kept under an atmosphere of Ar. The suspension was<br>
Buchner filtered to remove the yellow-orange solid<br>
impurity. The filtrate consisted of a two phase system.<br>
The lower phase was separated using a separating funnel,<br>
dried over MgS04 and Buchner filtered. The volatiles were<br>
removed via rotary evaporation, drying finally in-vacuo,<br>
affording an off-white powder. Yield 35.0 g, 99 %. 31P<br>
NMR: 5 = 85 ppm, 99 % pure. FW = 352.85.<br>
1.2 Preparation of (l-Ad)2PH<br>
L±A1H4 (2.54 g, 67.0 mmol) was added over 90 minutes to a<br>
chilled (-10 °C) solution of (l-Ad)2P (0) Cl (10.00 g, 28.3<br>
mmol) in THF. (120 cm3) . The reaction was allowed to warm<br>
to ambient temperature then stirred for 20 h. The grey<br>
suspension was cooled to -10 °C. HC1 (aq., 5 cm3 c. HC1 in<br>
5O cm3 degassed water) was added slowly via syringe<br>
(initially very slowly due to exotherm of reaction),<br>
yielding a two phase system, with some solid material in<br>
the lower phase. Further HC1 (~ 5 cm3 c. HC1) was added to<br>
improve the separation of the layers. The upper phase was<br>
removed via flat ended cannula, dried over MgSO* and<br>
filtered via cannula. The volatiles were removed in-vacuo<br>
affording the product as a white powder, isolated in the<br>
glovebox. Yield 6.00 g, 70 %. 31P NMR: 6= 17 ppm, 100 %<br>
pure. FW = 302.44.<br>
1.3 Preparation of (l-Ad)2PCl<br>
A solution of Ad2PH (10.5 g, 34.7 mmol) and DBU (6.12 cm3,<br>
4O.9 mmol) in toluene (250 cm3) was chilled to -10 °C.<br>
Phosgene solution (30.0 cm3, 56.7 mmol, was added slowly<br>
via cannula, transferring via a measuring cylinder. This<br>
afforded a highly viscous pale yellow suspension.<br>
Additional toluene (100 cm3) was added via cannula to<br>
lessen the viscosity and ease the stirring. The reaction<br>
was filtered via cannula affording a yellow filtrate. The<br>
residue was washed with additional toluene (2 x 100 cm3)<br>
and the washings combined with the original filtrate. The<br>
volatiles were removed in-vacuo affording a pale yellow<br>
solid, which was washed with pentane (2 x 30 cm3, washings<br>
practically colourless). The product was dried in-vacuo<br>
and isolated in the glovebox as a lemon yellow powder.<br>
Yield 7.84 g, 67 %. 31P NMR: 6 = 139 ppm, 99-1- % pure. FW =<br>
336.88.<br>
1.4 Preparation of 1,2-bis (di-1-<br>
adamantylphosphinome thyl) benzene<br>
1.4.1 Preparation of DI-SODIO-ORTHO-XYLENE (DISOD)<br>
BunLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 11.28 cm3, 28.2 mmol) was added<br>
dropwise via syringe over 15 minutes to a stirred<br>
suspension of NaOBu* (crushed, 2.71 g, 28.2 mmol), oxylene<br>
(1.15 cm3, 9.4 mmol) and N,N,N',N' - tetramethyl<br>
ethylene diamine (TMEDA) (4.26 cm3, 28.2 mmol) in heptane<br>
(100 cm3) . The reaction was heated at 60 °C for 2 h, then<br>
allowed to cool / settle, affording a bright orange solid<br>
(DISOD) and pale yellow solution. The solution was removed<br>
via cannula filtration and the solid washed with<br>
additional heptane (50 cm3) and dried in-vacuo. 90 % yield<br>
assumed, 8.47 mmol.<br>
1.4.2 Reaction of DI-SODIO-ORTHO-XYLENE with 2 equiv (1-<br>
Ad)<br>
A suspension of DISOD (8.47 mmol) in Et20 (100 cm3) was<br>
prepared at -78 °C. A suspension of Ad2PCl (5.70 g, 16.9<br>
mmol) in Et2O (120 cm3) was stirred rapidly at -78 °C and<br>
added via wide-bore cannula to the DISOD suspension. The<br>
reaction was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and<br>
stirred for 18 h, affording a pale yellow turbid solution.<br>
Water (degassed, 100 cm 3) added via cannula affording a<br>
two phase system, with a great deal of white solid present<br>
(product) due to the low solubility of this material. The<br>
upper phase (Et2O) was removed via cannula. The solid in<br>
the aqueous phase was extracted using dichloromethane (200<br>
cm3), forming two clear phases. The lower phase (CH2C12)<br>
was removed via cannula and combined with the original<br>
Et2O phase. The volatiles were removed in-vacuo yielding a<br>
slightly sticky solid. The solid was washed with pentane<br>
(200 cm3) with attrition being performed, the washings<br>
being removed via cannula filtration. The white solid was<br>
dried in-vacuo and isolated in the glovebox as a friable<br>
white powder. Yield 3.5 g, 59 %. FW = 707.01.<br>

8.1 Preparation of (l-Ad)2PLi<br>
BunLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 42.02 cm3, 105.1 mmol) was added<br>
dropwise via syringe to a stirred solution of AdaPH (10.59<br>
g, 35.0 mmol) in THF (150 cm3). This resulted in a<br>
darkening of the solution to yellow and the precipitation<br>
of a large quantity of yellow solid, in a mildly<br>
[cro<br>
exothermic reaction. The reaction was stirred at ambient<br>
temperature for 3 h. The volatiles were removed in-vacuo,<br>
affording a very pale orange solid. The solid was washed<br>
with pentane (2 x 50 cm3) to remove excess BunLi, resulting<br>
in the isolation of a white powder (washings orange) which<br>
was dried in-vacuo. The yield for this step was assumed to<br>
be quantitative, on the basis of previous NMR experiments.<br>

added dropwise via syringe to a stirred suspension of<br>
Ad2PLi (35.0 mmol, prepared as above) in THF (150 cm3) .<br>
Initially a yellow solution was formed, then a great deal<br>
of white solid crashed out (product). The volatiles were<br>
removed in-vacuo and dichloromethane (300 cm3) added via<br>
cannula affording a turbid solution. The turbidity was<br>
lost on addition of water (degassed, 100 cm3) , a two phase<br>
system being formed. The lower phase was removed via<br>
cannula filtration. The volatiles were removed in-vacuo,<br>
affording a white powder, which was washed with pentane<br>
(100 cm3), dried and isolated in the glovebox. Yield 6.45<br>

Example 33<br>
Preparation of methyl propanoate from ethylene, carbon<br>

Condition 2 ratio of ligand:palladium = 5.2:1, ratio of<br>
acid:palladium = 480:1 and ratio acid:ligand = 90:1<br>
A mechanically stirred autoclave (Hastelloy) of 2 litre<br>
capacity was evacuated of air and then charged with a<br>
solution of tri (dlbenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (1.44 x<br>
10~5 moles), 1,2-bis- (di-tertbutylphosphinomethyl)<br>
ferrocene of Example 10, (7.61 x 10"5 moles) and methane<br>
sulfonic acid (2.30 x 10"3 moles condition 1, 6.90 x 10"3<br>
moles condition 2) in 300 ml of methyl propanoate/methanol<br>
(70 wt% methyl propanoate) . The autoclave was heated to<br>
100°C and when at that temperature, ethylene (8 x 105Nm"2)<br>
was added on top of the vapour pressure of the solvents<br>
and immediately an equimolar mixture of carbon monoxide<br>
and ethylene (2 x 105Nm"2) added to the system through a<br>
pressure regulating valve set to 10 x 105Nm~2 above the<br>
solvent vapour pressure. Suitably, the molar ratio of<br>
ethylene to carbon monoxide in the reactor is<br>
approximately 9:1. The temperature of the reactor was<br>
maintained at 100°C and as the reaction proceeded<br>
additional carbon monoxide and ethylene was added (on an<br>
equimolar basis) through the pressure regulating Tescom<br>
valve. No catalyst precipitation was observed.<br>
Initial reaction rates measured in moles of methyl<br>
propanoate (MeP) per mole of palladium, per hour and<br>
turnover measured in moles of methyl propanoate per mole<br>
of palladium were determined for the catalyst. This may be<br>
accomplished by an analysis of the amount of gas consumed<br>
per unit time (rate) and the total amount of gas consumed<br>
during the reaction, assuming ideal gas behaviour and 100%<br>
selectivity to methyl propanoate.<br>
Table 1 shows the effect in increasing the relative acid<br>
concentration compared to phosphine ligand concentration<br>
(and metal concentration) for a batch process on both the<br>
maximum initial rate and the turnover number (TON) after <br>
hour, wherein initial reaction rates are measured in moles<br>
of methyl propanoate (MeP) per mole of palladium per hour<br>
and TON is measured as moles of methyl propanoate per mole<br>
of palladium. For both TON and maximum initial rate,<br>
values are significantly increased passing from condition<br>
1 to condition 2, i.e. when increasing both the<br>
acid:palladium and acid:ligand ratios at constant<br>
ligand:palladium values.<br>

heated to 100C with stirring (3 .0 barg vapour pressure).<br>
The reaction was started by the introduction of<br>
CO/ethylene (1:1) gaseous mixture to the autoclave. The<br>
total pressure of the autoclave vras controlled by a TESCOM<br>
(9.8 barg) . This resulted in a 9:1 ratio of ethylene to<br>
CO. The temperature and pressure were maintained 3 hours<br>
during which period these values were recorded.<br>
The gases were isolated and "the unit cooled to room<br>
temperature. The depressurised unit was emptied and the<br>

For the ligand 1,3-bis (di-tert-butylphosphino)2-methylenepropane<br>
(ligand 5) additional ligand with or without<br>
excess acid results in a drop in catalyst performance.<br>
The optimum conditions of low ligand and acid, e.g. Run<br>
Nos. 3 and 4, result in the highest catalyst productivity<br>
under the conditions studied. Addition of excess ligand<br>
at high acid ratio as in Run No. 1 results in a<br>
significant drop in performance, as does addition of<br>
excess ligand at low acid ratios.<br>
The following two tables contain data for the ligand 1,2-<br>
Bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl) benzene. The data was<br>
collected at 80C hence th* rates and turnover numbers are<br>
lower than the data we have already included. However,<br>
the data shows that at constant acid:ligandb levels, an<br>
increase in ligand:Pd ratio provides large increases in<br>
initial rate and TON values. This data also used the<br>
preformed catalyst [(L-L)Pd(dba) (for details see below)<br>
and adds the ligand excess as the protonated salt. The<br>
experimental detail is provided below.<br>

The number of moles of palladium is equal to the number of<br>
moles of L2Pd(dba).<br>
The work described in these examples was carried out in 2L<br>
capacity autoclaves. In each test lOmg of L2Pd(dba)<br>
catalyst and 32mg (4 equivalents) or 72mg (9 equivalents)<br>
of protonated phosphine were added to the preparation<br>
flask in a nitrogen purged glove box. 175mL of azeotrope<br>
product consisting of 50:50 wt% methanol and methyl<br>
propanoate and 125mL of methyl propanoate were then<br>
degassed and added to the flask to provide a reaction<br>
solution which was close to 70wt% methyl propanoate.<br>
After addition of the required quantity of<br>
methanesulphonic acid the solution was transferred to the<br>
evacuated autoclave and heated to 80°C in vacuo. During<br>
this period and at all subsequent times the autoclave was<br>
stirred at -1000 r.p.m. When this temperature had been<br>
reached the total pressure of the system was increased to<br>
9 bar (from the vapour pressure baseline of ~1 bar) by the<br>
addition of ethylene and then topped up with 2bar of 1:1<br>
C2H4/CO such that the total pressure was ~llbar and the<br>
headspace C2H4/CO ratio was 9:1. After this time only the<br>
1:1 gas was fed to the system at the rate which was<br>
required to hold the pressure within the system constant.<br>
Reaction rates and catalyst TONs were calculated from the<br>
rate of removal of gas from the feed reservoir assuming<br>
ideal gas behaviour and 100% selectivity for methyl<br>

Example 35<br>
Preparation of methyl propanoate from ethylene, carbon<br>
monoxide and methanol catalysed by a compound of the<br>
present invention<br>
The continuous process exemplified involved the reaction<br>
of purified streams of carbon monoxide, ethylene and<br>
methanol in the liquid phase, in the presence of a<br>
catalyst system, to generate the desired product, methyl<br>
propanoate.<br>
The reaction was carried out at 100°C and at 12 barg<br>
pressure in the reactor vessel.<br>
The catalyst system was made up of three components, being<br>
a palladium salt, a phosphine ligand and an acid. The<br>
three catalyst components, when combined together and<br>
dissolved in the reaction mixture, constitute the reaction<br>
catalyst or catalyst system, a homogeneous catalyst, which<br>
converted dissolved reactants to the product methyl<br>
propanoate in the liquid phase.<br>
During continuous operation, the catalyst decomposed at a<br>
slow but steady rate, and was replaced by adding fresh<br>
catalyst, or the rate of generation of the product, methyl<br>
propanoate reduces.<br>
The reactor vessel was fitted with an agitator, and also a<br>
means of re-circulating the unreacted gas that collected<br>
in the upper headspace area of the reactor. The unreacted<br>
gas from the reactor vessel headspace, which was made up<br>
of a mixture of ethylene and carbon monoxide, was returned<br>
continuously to the reactor via an entry pipe at the base,<br>
such that the gas passed up through the reaction mixture<br>
continuously.<br>
Upon entering into the reactor vessel the gas was<br>
dispersed by the agitator into fine bubbles. In this way<br>
the ethylene and carbon monoxide were dissolved in the<br>
reaction mix.<br>
Fresh ethylene and carbon monoxide gases were added to the<br>
re-circulating gas to make up for the amount of the two<br>
gases that have been used up by the reaction. Fresh<br>
methanol was also added continuously to the reactor<br>
vessel, in order to replace the methanol that has been<br>
used up in the reaction.<br>
The reactor vessel held the bulk liquid reaction mixture,<br>
along with the three components of the homogeneous<br>
catalyst, being a palladium salt, a phhosphine ligand, and<br>
a sulphonic acid.<br>
In order to recover the product methyl propanoate, a<br>
stream of reaction mixture was passed continuously out of<br>
the reactor and into the distillation column.<br>
The distillation column, being a single stage 'flash' type<br>
distillation column, provided a means of separating a<br>
fraction of the methyl propanoate and methanol components<br>
of the reaction mixture from the non-volatile dissolved<br>
catalyst components. This was achieved by vaporising a<br>
fraction of the reaction mixture as it passed through the<br>
flash column. The part of the reaction mixture which<br>
remained as liquid after passing through the flash column,<br>
and which still contained useful catalyst components, was<br>
returned to the reactor vessel so that the catalyst<br>
components could take part in the on-going reaction.<br>
If the methyl propanoate product was required free of<br>
methanol, a second distillation column was required. In<br>
this case, the vapour stream from the flash column, which<br>
is a mixture of methyl propanoate and methanol was passed<br>
into the second distillation column, where the pure methyl<br>
propanoate was generated as the heavier product, and taken<br>
off from the base of the column. A low boiling mixture of<br>
methanol and methyl propanoate was generated as the light<br>
product, and was removed continuously from the top of the<br>
MeP purification column. In order to utilise the methanol<br>
as efficiently as possible in the process, the low boiling<br>
mixture of methanol and methyl propanoate was returned<br>
continuously to the reactor vessel.<br>
135.<br>
After start up of the continuous reactor unit, when the<br>
desired rate of generation of methyl propanoate had been<br>
achieved, a process of gradual reduction of the feed rates<br>
of the catalyst components was undertaken.<br>
In order to sustain the rate of generation of methyl<br>
propanoate it was necessary to continuously replace the<br>
palladium catalyst component which was lost to<br>
decomposition with fresh palladium at a rate which<br>
balanced the rate of loss.<br>
This led to the situation where the standing<br>
concentrations of catalyst components became constant for<br>
a given rate of generation of methyl propanoate, and just<br>
able to sustain flow sheet reaction rate, as indicated by<br>
constant concentrations of carbon monoxide and ethylene in<br>
the headspace area of the reactor vessel. This was called<br>
the balance point, because under these conditions the rate<br>
of palladium decomposition was balanced exactly by the<br>
rate of addition of fresh palladium.<br>
From the rate of addition of fresh palladium catalyst<br>
component under balance point conditions, the palladium<br>
turnover number (TON) was calculated. This is defined as<br>
the number of mol of methyl propanoate generated per hour,<br>
for each mol of palladium consumed by the decomposition<br>
process per hour.<br>
Upon reaching a steady rate at a pre-determined set of<br>
control conditions, the instantaneous values of all of the<br>
variables were recorded, and used as representative data<br>
to show the performance of the process under the<br>
conditions in use at the time.<br>
To gather data on the effect of levels of phosphine ligand<br>
and acid present in the reaction mixture on palladium<br>
turnover number, all variables were held constant except<br>
the background levels of ligand and acid in the reaction<br>
mixture. These levels were changed by making small<br>
additions of these compounds to the reaction vessel via a<br>
dedicated tank and pumping system. The additions were<br>
then followed by careful adjustment of the catalyst<br>
solution feed rate to re-establish the balance position.<br>
The experimental design was such that after collecting<br>
each new set of balance point data, the system was<br>
returned to a previous set of conditions to check for any<br>
drifting of performance before moving on to the next set<br>
of experimental conditions.<br>
In this way, comparative sets of results were drawn up<br>
which showed clearly the changes to catalyst stability<br>
that were caused by the variations in the background<br>
levels of phosphine ligand and acid levels.<br>
The amount of palladium in the feed to the reactor is<br>
critical to calculation of. turnover number results.<br>
Assurance on the rate of fresh catalyst being fed to the<br>
system was provided by analysis of each batch of catalyst<br>
prior to transfer to the catalyst feed tanks for palladium<br>
content. Further assurance was gained by determination of<br>
the actual feed rate of catalyst from timing of the fall<br>
in the level in a burette, which is part of the catalyst<br>
feed system.<br>
Table 9 shows the effect on palladium turnover number<br>
(TON) when increasing the acid:ligand ratio and the<br>
ligand:metal ratio.<br>
In this Example, the acid used was methanesulphonic acid,<br>
the bidentate phosphine ligand was 1,2-bis-<br>
(ditertbutylphosphinomethyl) benzene, and the palladium<br>
compound was tri (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Further trends are seen in Figures 1-3 of the accompanying<br>
figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows TON versus acid:ligand mol ratio. Clearly,<br>
as the acid:ligand ratio increases above about 10, there<br>
is a large increase in TON for this particular catalyst<br>
system.<br>
Figure 2 shows TON versus amount of methanesulphonic acid<br>
present free in the reactor. Clearly, as the level of<br>
acid increases, there is a large increase in TON for this<br>
particular catalyst system.<br>
Figure 3 shows Pd amount in solution versus amount of<br>
methanesulphonic acid. Clearly, as the level of acid<br>
increases, there is a decrease in the amount of Pd in<br>
solution for this particular catalyst system, whilst the<br>
reaction rate remains constant. Therefore, working at<br>
these elevated acid levels, reaction rates can be<br>
maintained even as the palladium levels decrease. The<br>
advantages in view of the relative cost of the palladium<br>
component of the catalyst system is clear.<br>
