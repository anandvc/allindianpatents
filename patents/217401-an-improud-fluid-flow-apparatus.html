				<td>Technical Field<br>
The preterit invention relates to fluid flow apparatus and, in particular, to fluid tlowmelers, fluid mixers and fluid dispersing devices.<br>
Background Art<br>
U.S. patents 4,638,672, 4,812,049 and 5,363,699 disclose fluid flowmsters and fluid dispersing and mixing devices which are characterized by a unique static fluid flow displacement member which is mounted symmetrically within a conduit and which is effective to linearize fluid flow through the conduit within a region defined between the displacement member arid the interior surface of che conduit  and to flatten the velocity profile of fluid flow in the conduit both upstream and downstream from the displacement member.   The apparatus insures reliable measurement of fluid flow conditions within the conduit and also provides for homogeneous blending and dispersing of diverse fluids and/or fluids containing participate matter.<br>
The unique fluid ilowmeters and mixers are made and sold under the registered trademark "V-CONE" by McCrometer, Inc. of Kernel, California, which is the owner of the abovu patents and the assignee of the present invention,<br>
The fluid flow displacement member in the V-CONE devices is comprised of two frustums, usually conical, joined al their larger ends and mounted coaxially in an individualized section of conduit.   The frustums are mounted substantially normal to the axis of the section and the direction of fluid flow and with their peripheries spaced symmetrically inwardly from the<br>
imerior surface of the conduit section.   Depending upon the dimensions of the displacement member relative to the size of the conduit section, the displacement member is effective to linearize fluid flow over a predetermined range of flow rates through (he section.<br>
The displacement member is made by joining two frustums together at their larger ends, usually by welding.   The frustum facing in the upstream direction is customarily joined, e.g., by welding, at its upstream and smaller end to a pipe or rube which extends through the displacement member to its downstream face and through which a pressure rending is taken or through which a secondary fluid is introduced for mixing with a primary fluid flowing through the conduit.   The pipe or tube is bent outwardly and extends through the wall of the conduit section upstream from the displacement member. The pipe or tube is joined, e.g., welded, to the wall of the conduit section and conveniently serves as the means for mounting the displacement member coaxially within the section.<br>
Becau.se of the requirements for material joining, manufacture of the "V-CONE" meters and mixers is quite labor intensive.   Further, since the mounting pipe or tube is located upstream from the displacement member, it is in a position to introduce anomalies in fluid flow into the region where the velocity of the fluid flow is intended to be linearized.<br>
Also, as presently constructed, a separate flowmcier and its associated flow sensing devices is required for each of the various sizes of flowmcters needed for linearizing and measuring fluid flows over respective ranges of flow rates.<br>
Thus, while the "V-CONE" meters and mixers have heretofore served the needs of industry effectively and efficiently anil have met with widespread acceptance and commercial success, there is, as always, room for improvement.<br>
Djsclosure of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to improve in several respects upon the devices; disclosed in the above listed patents and the commercial embodiments of the "V-CONE" flowmeters and fluid mixing and dispersing devices.<br>
In a firsi respect, it is an object of the invention to provide f'uid How devices of the type described that do not require material joining, e.g., that eliminate the need for welding and/or other means of fixedly securing one component or part to another component or part.<br>
In another aspect, it is an object of the invention to accommodate manufacture of the described fluid flow devices from a broader range of materials than heretofore deemed feasible.<br>
In a second respect, it is an object of the invention to provide fluid How devices of the type described wherein the fluid flow displacement member is removably and replaceably mounted in the conduit section so that a given displacement member can be removed and replaced by one or more different displacement members in order to accommodate different fluids and different ranges of fluid flow through the conduit section,   in this way, a single .section of conduit, i.e., a single meter body., can be used with a variety of displacement members to accommodate various liquids and gases and a broad range of flows through the meter body.<br>
In a third respect, it is an object of the invention to support the displacement member at a location downstream from the displacement member thereby to eliminate flow disturbances within the region between the meter body and the displacement member.  Elimination of disturbances in such region insures a much morn uniform and stable fluid flow, and in turn, much more stable, reliable and accurate measurements.<br>
In a fourth respect, it is an object of the invention to provide flow measurement taps through the wall of the conduit section or meter body so that no measurement taps or other holes or passages arc required in the<br>
displacement member, as was previously required.  Attainment of this object contributes to and facilitates attainment of the other objects, and provides fluid How apparatus that is relatively easy to manufacture and very reliable in operation,<br>
In yet another respect, it is an object of the invention to provide fluid flow devices in waich there are no stagnant areas within the devices and wheren fluids are compelled to flow smoothly and continuously through the device without flow stagnation.   This, in turn, accommodates the use of the devices in sanitary environments, i.e., in areas and under conditions where sanitation is paramount.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention are attained by virtue of a particular mode of construction of the fluid flow devices, the presently preferred embodiment of which will now be described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying  Out the Invention<br>
The following is a detailed description of a preferred embodiment of a fluid tlowmeter presently contemplated by the inventors to be the hesr. mode of carrying out the invention.   Modifications and changes therein will become apparent to persons of reasonable skill in the an as the description proceeds,<br>
Referring first to Fig. 5, the fluid flowmctcr of the invention, indicated generally at 10, is adapted to be installed in a pipeline or other fluid flow conduit which is depicted as being comprised of pipe sections 12 having bolting flanges 14 at their ends.   The flowmeter 10 is comprised of a meter body 20 and a fluid flow displacement device 40 mounted coaxially within the body.   The meter body 20 comprises, in essence, a. section of pipe or conduit adapted to be bolted or otherwise secured between two sections of pipe, for<br>
example between the flarger 14 o the ithstraled pipe  section 12     The meter <br>
body is preferably of the so-called wafer design and is simply confined<br>
between Die flanges 14 and ^ciucicd ui usually al.ig.ncU willi Lhc pipe Mourns<br>
12 by means of circumferentially spaced bolts 16 (only one shown) extending between and interconnecting the flanges.<br>
use: comprises a parf ot, and constimte.s a continuarinn nt the path ot fluid flow<br>
flow is from left to right as viewed in the drawings.   The pipe line 12 and conduit section 20 are usually cylindrical and the bore 22 is usually, (hough not always, of the same internal cross section and size as the pipe sections 12.<br>
Longitudinally spaced pressure taps 24 and 26 extend radially through the wall of the body 20 at locations and for purposes to be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 and 4, the interior wall of the body 20 is provided, at the rearward or downstream end thereof, with a plurality of circumferentially spaced, rearwardly open recesses or grooves 28 of limited longitudinal, ladial and aicualc extent.   In the picfcned embodiment, llieic arc<br>
two diametrically opposed grooves in the rearward end portion of the meter body.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the displacement device 40 is comprised of a How conditioning portion or displacement member 42 and a supporting or mounting portion or member 44.<br>
The flow conditioning or displacement member 42 is comprised of a body, usually cylindrical, which has a major transverse diameter or dimension at edge 46 and two oppositely facing, usually conical, sloped walls 48 and 50 which lace, respectively, in the upstream and downstream directions in the meter body 20 and which taper .symmetrically inward toward the axis of the body.   Except as hereinafter described, the flow conditioning member 42 has essentially the san:e physical characteristics and functions in essentially the same manner as the flow displacement members utili/.ed in the "V-CONH" devices available from McCrometer, Inc. and those described in patents 4,638,672, 4,812,049 and 5,363,699, the disclosures of which arc incorporated herein as though here set forth in fuil.<br>
A« described in fhr prior paints, the member 42 is of smaller size than <br>
to the direction of fluid flow and with the sloped walls 48 and 50 spaced symmetrically inward from the interior or inner surface of the wall Df the conduit.   The larger and contiguous ends of thr: sloped walls arc of the same size and shape and define at their juncture a sharp peripheral edge 46, the plane of which lies normal to the direction of fluid flow.   The upstieam wall 48 is longer than the downstream wall 50 and preferably tapers inwardly to a point, or substantially a point, at its upstream end.   The wall is formed at an angle in the order of from about 39 degrees to about 75 degrees to the plane defined by the peripheral edge 46, a preferred angle being in the order of about 67.5 degrees.   The angle of the downstream wall 50 relative Lo the plane defined by the ed.ge 46 is within the range of from about 15° to about 30", a<br><br>
preferred angle being in the order of about 26 degrees.   The beia ratio ul ilic member 42 relative to the inner diameter of the conduit 20 is preferably in the order of from about 0.4 up to about 0.94.<br>
As fluid enters ihc inlet or upstream end of the conduit 20, the fluid is displaced or deflected by the upstream wall 48 of" the member 42 into an annular region of progressively decreasing cross sectional area, lo a minimum area at the plane of the peripheral edge 46.  The fluid then flows into an annular region of progressively increasing area as defined by the downstream wall 50.   As a consequence, the fluid flow is stabilized and conditioned both upstream and downstream from the member 42.   In particular, the member 42 is effective to linearize fluid flow in the region between the member 42 and (he wall of the conduit 20 and lo flatten the velocity profile of fluid flow in the conduit both upstream and downstream from the displacement member over a predetermined range of flow rates.   Consequently, the flow profile both upstream and downstream is relatively flat, symmetrical, axially centered within the conduit, and of a large and essentially constant mean flow diameler irrespective of iluw isle.   Also, the fluid or fluids and any solid materials therein are homogenized so that the conduit 20 is filled with an essentially homogeneous mixture throughout substantially its full cross sectional area.<br>
The downstream wall 50 is, in addition, effective to optimize the return velocity of the fluid as it returns to free stream conditions in the corduit downstream from the member.   The sharp peripheral edge 46 in conjunction with Ihe downstream wall 50 causes short vortices to be shed from the peripheral edge in the downstream direction.   These vortices are of small amplitude and high frequency and thereby contribute to optimization of the return velocity of the fluid flow.   Vortices of small amplitude and high frequency effectively eliminate extraneous downstream disturbances or so-called "noise", and thereby facilitate highly accurate and reliable measurements.<br>
For purpose of mounting the member 42 coaxially within the bore 22, Hit: displacement member 42 is provided, pursuant to the present invention, with an integral mounting or support portion or member 44.   Specifically, the member 40 is provided at one end thereof with a plurality of circumlerentially spaced radially outwardly extending projections or tongues 52 of the same number as and located at the same spacing as the recesses or grooves 28 in the meter body or conduit section 20.   In the preferred embodiment, the tongue:, 52 are provided at the rear or downstream end of the member 40 and arc comprised of two diametrically opposed tongues which in effect form a rigid cross bar at the downstream end of the member 40, as is shown in Fig. 2. Preferably, the cross bar is located a short distance downstream from the sloped wall 50 and is united therewith by a cylindrical extension 54. The extension 54 may be of different lengths for different sizes and shapes of displacement members so as to properly locale the displacement member relative to the measurement taps 24 and 26 AS will be described later herein.<br>
As is shown by comparison of Figs. 2 and 4, the tongues 52 aave a radial extent and distal configuration the same as and matching thai of the grooves 28 in the meter body.   Consequently, the displacement member 40 can be conveniently assembled within the meter body 20 simply by inserting the same inio the downstream end of the conduit or bore 22 and causing the tongues 52 to seat firmly and securely within the grooves 28.   Upon assembly of the meter body in the pipe line,   the flange 14 of the downstream pipe section 12 locks the tongues 52 in place in the grooves 28 and prohibits di&amp;lodgement or dislocation of the displacement member 42 relative to the bore 22 of the meter body 20.<br>
When assembled in the body 20, die peripheral edge 46 oi th« displacement member is located intermediate the two pressure taps 24 and 26 .so that the taps are located on opposite sides of the area or plane 46 at which the fluid How area is the smallest and the velocity of fluid flow is the greatest. The taps communicate respectively with upstream and downstream areas in theconduit where the velocity profile of the fluid flow is relatively flat, linear and stable.   This enables highly accurate tlow measurements via the taps by means of conventional fluid flow measurement instrumentation connected with the taps, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.   The apparatus of the invention provides to the measuring instrumentation a highly reliable and stable signal having excellent accuracy.<br>
The upstream measurement tap 24 may be located within an area between the edge 46 and a point about two conduit diameters, i.e., about two limCN the diameter of the bore 22, upstream from the upstream end c:f the upstream sloped wall 48.   A preferred location is in the area immediately upstream from the pointed end of the wall 48, as illustrated in Fig. 5.  The downstream tap 26 may be located within the area between the edge 46 and a point about two conduit diameters downstream from the edge.   In particular, the displacement member 42 will cause a vena contracta, i.e., an area of contracted flow, to form in the fluid flow at a predictable or ascertainahle distance downstream from the edge 46, and the preferred location for the downstream tap is within the area where the vena contracts occurs.   Pressure measurements at these locations, and the differential between the measured pressures, provide information from which flow conditions within the pipe l-ne earn be determined and measured by appropriate instrumentation, as depicted<br>
schematically in fig. 5.<br>
The mcAsurcmcnt inAtmmcritatiori cuM.uniiiiilj
a How totalizing register and/or an instantaneous flow rate indicator.   If desired for exceptional accuracy, the taps 24 and 26 may be equipped with solid state or electronic transducers for generating signals which arc transmitted to an appropriate processing unit such as a computer or microprocessor.   Such instrumentation is nut illustrated in the drawings as the same are conventional in the flow measurement industry.   With the. components described, the overall system accuracy, i.e., the combined<br>
accuracy of the hydraulic, mechanical, electrical and/or electronic systems, is 99% or better.   All system errors combined arc typically within plus or minus 1 % of the register or indicator reading.  As is known, (he totalizing rcgisier may provide a reading in gallons, cubic feet, acre feet, cubic meters and other standard measurements.   Similarly, the flow rate indicator may provide a reading in gallons per minute, cubic feet per second and other standard measures.<br>
Because the displacement member in the preferred embodiment is supported at a location downstream from the pressure taps 24 and 26, the supporting elements or tongues 52 do not introduce any flow disturbances or anomalies into the region where the taps are located,   Fluid flow measurements arc taken before the fluid eiicuumen; the supports, which contributes further to the reliability, stability and accuracy of flow measurements.<br>
The employment of radial pressure taps 24 and 26 in the conduit section 20 eliminai:es the prior art need for a conduit extending axially through the displacement member for purposes of measuring the pressure at r.he downstream side of the member, and in turn eliminates the void and stagnate area of zero fluid flow that existed in such conduit.   Consequently, the flow meter of the invention can be utilized for measuring fluid flow in industrial applications where cleanliness and sanitation are of paramount concern.   In particular, by utilizing diaphragm type pressure sensors in the two taps, sanitary conditions are assured.<br>
furthermore, employment of radial pressure laps accommodates manufacture of the displacement member and its support structure as an integral, unitary, solid component, which docs not require any material joining, such as welding.   Also, the supporting system provided by the tongues 52 and grooves 28 eliminates any need tor material joining, e.g., welding, of a support to (he member 40 and the wall of the conduit section 20. Consequently, labor costs are significantly reduced.<br>
lso, manui'actiire of tlie member 40 as a solid body permits the use of materials of construction not previously deemed suitable for the purpose, for example plastics, particularly plastics having nonstick properties such as Teflon, Delrin and polytetrafluoroethylene.  Additionally, use of such materials of construction permits casting or molding of the displacement member as a unitary component, thereby cutting costs still further.<br>
The displacement member mounting or support system of the invention also facilitates convenient and quick conversion of the device from a first beta ratio to another beta ratio or from a first range of flow rates to other and different ranges of flow rates.   Specifically, (he size and/or configuration, e.g., slope angles, of the displacement member relative to the bore 22 in the conduit section 20 determines the beta ratio, the types of fluids and ihe range of flows over which the displacement member is effective to linearize fluid flow through the region between the displacement member and the interior surface of the wall of the conduit.   Changes in the size and/or configuration of the displacement member changes the type and ranges of flows to which the system is responsive.  Consequently, by removing a first displacement member and replacing it with a different displacement member, the system can be rendered accurately responsive to different flow rates and different fluids. By value of the invention, this can be accomplished simply and expeditiously by loosening and removing the bolts 16 that extend between the flanges 14, removing the wafer section 20 from the pipe line, removing the displacement member from the mounting grooves 28 and the conduit 20, replacing the displacement member with a different displacement member, and returning the section 20 to its place in the pipe line 12.   Consequently, there is no need to replace a given meter body with an entirely different meter body.   One conduit section 20 and its associated sensors will suffice for purposes of measuring fluid flow over a number of ranges of flow rates and a number of different fluids, both liquid and gas.<br>
The objects and advantages of the invention have therefore been shown to be attained in a convenient, practical, economical and facile manner.<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been herein illustrated and described, it is to be appreciated that various changes mndififiarions rnav be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
