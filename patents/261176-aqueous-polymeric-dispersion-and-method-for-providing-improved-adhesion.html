according to the methods disclosed in US Patent No. 5,897,811. Preferred moieties incorporated in the polymer are those resulting from the formation of the aqueous polymeric dispersion in the presence of anthracene, anthracene acid, acridene, or mixtures thereof. "Anthracene acid" herein refers to an anthracene derivative including a carboxylic acid group.<br>
The emulsion polymerization techniques typically used in the method for forming the aqueous polymeric dispersion of the present invention are well known in the art such as, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,325,856; 4,654,397; and 4,814,373. Conventional surfactants may be used such as, for example, anionic and/or nonionic emulsifiers such as, for example, alkali metal or ammonium alkyl sulfates, alkyl sulfonic acids, fatty acids, phosphate surfactants such as, for example, Rhodfac™ RS-610 and Rhodfac™ RS-960 and oxyethylated alkyl phenols.   The amount of surfactant used is usually 0.1% to 6% by weight, based on the weight of total monomer. Either thermal or redox initiation processes may be used. Conventional free radical initiators, also referred to as catalysts, may be used such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, t-amyl hydroperoxide, ammonium and/or alkali persulfates, typically at a level of 0.01% to 3.0% by weight, based on the weight of total monomer. Redox systems using the same initiators coupled with a suitable reductant, also referred to as an activator, such as, for example, sodium sulfoxylate formaldehyde, sodium hydrosulfite, isoascorbic acid, hydroxylamine sulfate and sodium bisulfite may be used at similar levels, optionally in combination with metal ions such as, for example iron and copper, optionally further including complexing agents for the metal. Chain transfer agents such as mercaptans may be used to lower the molecular weight of the polymers. The monomer mixture may be added neat or as an emulsion in water. The monomer mixture may be added in a single addition or in multiple additions or continuously over the reaction period using a uniform or varying composition. Additional ingredients such as, for example, free radical initiators, oxidants, reducing<br>
agents, chain transfer agents, neutralizers, surfactants, and dispersants may be added prior to, during, or subsequent to any of the stages. Processes yielding polymodal particle size distributions such as those disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,384,056 and 4,539,361, for example, may be employed.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the aqueous polymeric dispersion may be formed by a multistage emulsion polymerization process, in which at least two stages differing in composition are polymerized in sequential fashion. Such a process usually results in the formation of at least two mutually incompatible polymer compositions, thereby resulting in the formation of at least two phases within the polymer particles. Such particles are composed of two or more phases of various geometries such as, for example, core/shell or core/sheath particles, core/shell particles with shell phases incompletely encapsulating the core, core/shell particles with a multiplicity of cores, and interpenetrating network particles. In all of these cases, the majority of the surface area of the particle will be occupied by at least one outer phase and the interior of the particle will be occupied by at least one inner phase. Each of the stages of the multi-staged emulsion polymer may contain the same monomers, surfactants, chain transfer agents, etc. as disclosed herein-above for the emulsion polymer. For a multi-staged emulsion polymer, the composition shall be determined from the overall composition of the emulsion polymer without regard for the number of stages or phases therein. The polymerization techniques used to prepare such multistage emulsion polymers are well known in the art such as, for example, US Patents No. 4,325,856; 4,654,397; and 4,814,373.<br>
The calculated glass transition temperature ("Tg") of the polymer included in the aqueous polymeric dispersion is typically from -65°C to 105°C, or in the alternative, from -25°C to 35°C. Tgs of the polymers are calculated herein by using the Fox equation (T.G. Fox, Bull. Am. Physics Soc, Volume 1, Issue No. 3, page 123(1956)), that is, for calculating the Tg of a copolymer of monomers Ml and M2,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
Tg(calc) is the glass transition temperature calculated for the copolymer w(Ml) is the weight fraction of monomer Ml in the copolymer w(M2) is the weight fraction of monomer M2 in the copolymer Tg(Ml) is the glass transition temperature of the homopolymer of Ml Tg(M2) is the glass transition temperature of the homopolymer of M2, all temperatures being in °K.<br>

The amount of inorganic particles included in the aqueous coating composition is from 0 to 95 volume %, based on the total dry volume of the aqueous composition and inorganic particles. Typically, the aqueous coating composition of this invention, when used to prepare dried coatings, has a solids level in the range of from 20 to 50 volume %, based on the volume of the aqueous composition. The pH of the aqueous composition is typically in the range of from 3 to 11, and preferably, in the range of from 7 to 10.

The aqueous compositions including inorganic particles are prepared by techniques which are well known in the coatings art. First, the inorganic particles are typically are well dispersed in an aqueous medium under high shear such as is afforded by a COWLES (R) mixer.<br>
Then, the aqueous polymeric dispersion of the present invention is added under low shear stirring along with other coatings adjuvants as desired. The aqueous composition may contain, in addition to the aqueous polymeric dispersion and optional pigment(s), film-forming or non-film-forming solution or other emulsion polymers in an amount of 0% to 200% by weight of the aqueous polymeric dispersion of the present invention, and conventional coatings adjuvants such as, for example, emulsifiers, coalescing agents(coalescents), plasticizers, antifreezes, curing agents, buffers, neutralizers, thickeners, photosensitive moieties, rheology modifiers, humectants, wetting agents, biocides, plasticizers, antifoaming agents, UV absorbers, fluorescent brighteners, light or heat stabilizers, biocides, chelating agents, dispersants, colorants, waxes, water-repellants, and anti-oxidants.<br>
The aqueous composition optionally contains a volatile organic compound ("VOC"). A VOC is defined herein as a carbon containing compound that has a boiling point below 280 °C at atmospheric pressure. Water and ammonia are excluded from VOCs. Frequently a VOC is deliberately added to a paint or coating to improve the film properties of a coating or to aid in the application properties of the composition employed to prepare the coating. Examples are glycol ethers, organic esters, aromatic compounds, ethylene and propylene glycol, and aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
In one embodiment, the aqueous composition contains up to 20 weight % VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition; preferably the aqueous coating composition contains less than 5% VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition; more preferably the aqueous coating composition contains less than 3% VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition! even more preferably the aqueous coating composition contains less than 1.7% VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition.<br>
Typical methods of aqueous paint or coating preparation introduce adventitious VOCs from the preparation of the aqueous composition, biocides, defoamers, soaps, dispersants, and thickeners. These typically account for 0.2% VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition. Additional methods such as steam stripping and choice of low VOC containing additives like biocides, defoamers, soaps, dispersants, and thickeners are suitable for further reducing the aqueous coating composition to less than 0.05% VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition. In one embodiment, the aqueous coating composition has less than 0.1% VOC by weight based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition.<br>
Additionally, the low VOC aqueous coating composition optionally contains coalescing agents that are not VOCs. A coalescing agent is a compound that is added to a water-borne emulsion polymer, paint, or coating, which reduces the minimum film forming temperature (MFFT) of the emulsion polymer, paint or coating by at least 1°C. The MFFT is measured using ASTM test method D2354. A non-VOC coalescing agent is a coalescing agent which has a boiling point above 280°C at atmospheric pressure. Examples of coalescing agents that are not VOCs include plasticizers, low molecular weight polymers, surfactants, and autooxidizable plasticizers such as alkyl esters of unsaturated fatty acids. Preferred are alkyl esters prepared from oils such as linseed, tung, dehydrated castor, soybean, tall, sunflower, and corn. Examples of non-VOC coalescing agents include esters of unsaturated fatty acids, such as mono, di-, or trrunsaturated fatty acids. Suitable unsaturated fatty acid esters include monounsaturated fatty acid esters formed from palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, or caproleic acid; diunsaturated fatty acid esters formed from linoleic acid; triunsaturated fatty acid esters formed from linolenic acid or eleosteric acid, or mixtures thereof. Suitable esters of unsaturated fatty acids includes alkyl esters such as, such as methyl and ethyl esters; substituted alkyl esters, such as esters formed from ethylene glycol and propylene glycol; and alkyl ether esters of unsaturated fatty acids,<br>
diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, and diethylene glycol monobutyl ether. In one embodiment, the above auto autooxidizable plasticizers are used in conjunction with an aqueous composition contains 0.25% to 12.5% of acetoacetoxyethyl (meth)acrylate as polymerized units. Auto oxidation can further be enhanced by the use of metal ion catalysts such as cobalt, zirconium, calcium, manganese, copper, zinc and iron. Simple salts such as halides, nitrates, and sulfates maybe used but in many cases an organic anion such as the acetate, naphthenate or acetoacetonate is used.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention a method for providing a coating having improved adhesion to a substrate is provided. By "improved adhesion to a substrate" herein is meant that the adhesion of a coating including the aqueous polymeric dispersion of the present invention to a substrate is superior to that of a corresponding coating, i.e., a coating including a polymer of the same composition absent the required acid monomer and moiety of the present invention. Conventional coatings application methods such as, for example, brushing, rolling, and spraying methods such as, for example, air-atomized spray, air-assisted spray, airless spray, high volume low pressure spray, and air-assisted airless spray may be used to apply the aqueous composition of this invention. Additionally, for some systems, other application techniques may be used to apply the aqueous polymer composition, such as, caulk gun, roll coaters, and curtain coaters. The aqueous polymer composition may be advantageously applied to substrates such as, for example, plastic, wood, metal, primed surfaces, previously painted surfaces, weathered painted surfaces, glass, composites, and cementitious substrates; preferred is a metal substrate. Drying is typically allowed to proceed under ambient conditions such as, for example, at 0°C to 35°C but may be accelerated with heat or low humidity.<br>
