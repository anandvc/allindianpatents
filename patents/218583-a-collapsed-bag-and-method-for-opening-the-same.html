				<td>A COLLAPSED BAG AND METHOD FOR OPENING THE SAME<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1. This invention relates to the art of plastic bags, and in particular to a method of opening bags<br>
of supple polymeric material subject to interlaycr cling. The invention also relates to collapsed bags<br>
made of supple materials, such as thermoplastic films, which have, integral to their design, features<br>
which render them easy to open from the collapsed state so they can be filled with materials. The<br>
invention applies to bags of plain or side-gussetted design.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Collapsed plastic bags as supplied empty and ready for use from stacks, rolls or various kinds of<br>
dispensers arc often difficult or tedious to open manually, partly due to being packed for a long<br>
period in a flat or compressed state and sometimes due as well to factors arising from manufacture<br>
methods, for instance "cold welding" by which cut edges tend to form a weak bond, or materials.<br>
for instance "static cling". Such problems affect most severely bags made of thin films. With thick<br>
materials, flexing two adhered layers can place tension on the layer outermost in the curve and<br>
compression on the layer innermost in the curve and, depending on thickness and elasticity and the<br>
radius of flexion, a point may be easily reached where the static force is overcome by the energy<br>
stored in the compressed and tensioned layers so that they spontaneously disengage. This process is<br>
not very reliable with thin-film bags because even with very tight curves the tension and<br>
compression differential is small on account of the difference in radius of curvature being small in<br>
turn on account of the small layer thickness, and the tension and compression generated is<br>
more easily accommodated by elasticity of the material and layers often do not disengage.<br>
Thin film bags are used routinely as checkout bags, produce bags, and general purpose bags.<br>
It is thus of advantage to design such bags to be more easily opened, in order to save time<br>
and reduce wastage of bags that are damaged during the opening attempt or discarded in<br>
frustration.<br>
Additives may sometimes help to make layers separable, but additives generally add<br>
cost and also add a further control step in the manufacturing. Furthermore, additives<br>
may have unwanted effects such as odor or allergcnicity, and some plastic<br>
additives have derived from animal fats that in some traditions and religions are<br>
strictly prohibited - for example animal-derived components even as an ingredient<br>
in food packaging materials may be unacceptable under Kosher, Halal, Hindu, or<br>
strict vegetarian standards. The public has also been sensitised to animal-derived<br>
substances used in non-traditional ways by the BSE (Bovine Spongiform<br>
Encephalopathy) problem, and also by the recent finding that some plastic additives<br>
act as hormone analogues with implications for human health and also ecological<br>
effects. Therefore not only is a solution needed to make collapsed bags easier to<br>
handle, but that solution is preferable and more consumer-acceptable if it is<br>
mechanical rather than chemical-<br>
In confirmation of the above, the number of patents for mechanical methods show<br>
that major companies recognise a strong desire for mechanical solutions to ease<br>
handling of plastic bags.<br>
CA 916383 (Walsh and Klein assigned to Leco Industries Ltd) teaches a method of<br>
selective cooling of a extruded polymeric tube for preparing blown material with<br>
thicker and thinner portions in the same sheet. Because increased thickness of<br>
material generally reduces the interlayer adhesion problem/ this can be used to<br>
make bags with thicker material near the mouth while economising on the use of<br>
material overall- An added benefit may be relatively increased strength in the area<br>
of handles. This approach to improving the opening properties of bags is now<br>
public domain and can be seen in the market, including in small bags at retail<br>
establishments like Canadian Tire. But if the objective is to have a thickened zone<br>
where the bag mouth occurs for greater ease in opening, application of the thick-thin<br>
extrusion method is restricted to bags in which the vertical bag axis is perpendicular<br>
to the direction of extrusion, for example common side-weld bags with punched<br>
handles, and not in that sense applicable to bags supplied on rolls, or T-shirt bags, or<br>
other bags whose vertical axis is parallel to the direction of extrusion.<br>
Block-headed bags, bags with tear tabs at the top, tabs in a stack of bags being block-<br>
welded together and provided with a hanger hole, are popular in many department<br>
stores- They are commonly based on the T-shirt plan but have a design feature to<br>
address ease of handling. Block-headed T-shirt bags are typically used on racks<br>
with pegs supporting the bag handles and most critically a block-welded tab of tear-<br>
off sections of a wad of bags. "These tabs are in the mouth area of each bag and<br>
attached by a weakened or partially cut zone to the main portion of the bag. When<br>
the bag is removed from the stack the tab remains behind. The principle is that the<br>
user can grasp the front of the front-most bag and tha t the force so applied will<br>
gather the front panel until a small region of that panel separates from the back<br>
layer, becomes folded and pinched by the user; then the idea is that pulling on the<br>
portion of the front panel so grasped will cause failure of the weakened portion<br>
whereby the front panel attaches to the block-welded tab and then further pulling<br>
against resistance maintained by the corresponding attachment of the back panel.<br>
This renders the bag open and supported by the rack for filling. Removal of the<br>
filled bag separates the back panel from the back panel tab, leaving the waste tab,<br>
and leaving exposed the front panel of the next bag. In practise however, while an<br>
improvement over plain T-shirt bags, reliable performance requires moist or sticky<br>
fingers, and performance is poor if the bags have to be used without racks (many<br>
situations are not compatible with racks, and sometimes supply is short and the<br>
wrong size bags are all that are available), which presumably is why many stores<br>
still do not use this type of bag.<br>
A further type of mechanical approach to easy opening of produce bags is known in<br>
the market (Sealed Air Corp. listing US 5,941,393; 5,556,019 on product; and<br>
QuikStar™ listing US 5,752,666 on product). It is analogous to a deeply gussetted<br>
bag which is then folded on its vertical axis, and which has tabs of a stack of bags<br>
block-welded and with a hanger hole. Tabs of each bag are connected by weakened<br>
zones to a part of either the front or the back panel (four tabs per bag). This concept<br>
gives a multiplicity of layers in which ease of opening benefits from the greater<br>
tension-compression differential achieved between innermost and outermost layers<br>
subjected to bending around a given radius as formed when the user pinches several<br>
layers simultaneously. Ease of opening also benefits from the improved chance of<br>
the cling between at least two adjacent layers being weak enough to be easily<br>
overcome by simple finger friction.<br>
U-S. Fat. No. 5,611,627 to Belias et al. discloses for flat bags a type having at least one<br>
main panel top edge cut on an undulating sinusoidal or sawtooth or like pattern and<br>
the other panel being either flat or similarly shaped edge but cut 180 degrees out of<br>
phase. This yields upward projections from the mouth of the bag that can be used to<br>
grasp and separate main panels and also to tie the bag closed.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 3,023,947 to McDuffie confronts problems associated with semirigid<br>
multilayer paper bags that are to be opened for filling with bulk materials and then<br>
reclosed by sewing on assembly lines. McDuffie"s solution uses gusset panels tha t<br>
are both offset and glued to mam sidewalls, reforming the bag mouth as a<br>
parallelogram and leaving the remaining gussets to form a pair of planar semirigid<br>
struts that come under compression when the bag as a whole is placed under<br>
horizontal tension in the plane of the main panels; the struts swing and expand the<br>
bag mouth, which is a parallelogram because of the glued gusset panel. In<br>
McDuffie"s solution the bag opening is limited to a width about one-half of the<br>
general cross-section of the bag. McDuffie"s approach uses not shearing as much as<br>
prying, the bag being semirigid; the pulling on McDuffie"s tabs causes the free<br>
gusset to rotate away from the adjacent main (front or rear) panel, thus prying the<br>
front and rear panels apart (vs. peeling of extra folds or shearing of main panels or<br>
portions thereof), as in Hoover or the present invention). Indeed: the ratio of the<br>
direct outward motion per unit lateral motion (pull) in McDuffie"s solution can be<br>
calculated as [sinA/(1-cosA)], where A represents the angle so formed between the<br>
free gusset and adjacent main panel. Initially this ratio is infinity (i.e. all pull and no<br>
shear)- Just after initiation, assuming an angle of 1 degree, the outward pull is over<br>
100 times as much as the shear. The only shearing that would occur in McDuffie"s<br>
solution would be better described as a brief rubbing of some portion of the center of<br>
the main panels that remain briefly in contact due to air pressure retarding (but not<br>
preventing) the opening of the bag. A planar strut as per McDuffie is unlikely to be<br>
practicable in thin-film bags. While the reduced opening in McDuffie"s solution<br>
suffices to accommodate the ingress of granular goods or goods of relatively small<br>
dimensions, Hoover and the present invention allow full opening of the bag mouth<br>
for items up to the size of the bag volume itself.<br>
US Pat. No. 4,911,560 to Hoover et al (also filed as CA 1,329,384) addresses supple<br>
plastic bags and uses an approach that combines shearing of a part of the front and<br>
back panels and an unpeeling of extra vertical pleats which are made in the main<br>
panels of the bag and arranged in such a way as to collapse or unfold when the bag<br>
is placed under horizontal tension. If the extra pleats are located opposite each other<br>
the action is all peeling and no shear, if otherwise there is a combination. To open this type of bag<br>
requires a greater amount of movement, and a larger workspace space to accommodate it, to take up<br>
the slack provided by unfolding of the extra pleats. This solution creates at least two further<br>
problems. In many applications extra folds would be undesirable because of both complication of<br>
the printing operation and the subsequent disruption of any printed image that covers the area of the<br>
pleats. Also, this approach necessitates extra folds not otherwise required in the bag, so there is<br>
added difficulty in manufacture and indeed one source (C. Mutton of Fast Coast Converters, St.<br>
John"s) considers it impossible from his experience.<br>
The bag disclosed in JP 11349005 is locked to a central locking piece and the bag can be<br>
opened using a single hand. This bag only appears to contemplate introducing a shearing action by<br>
pulling exposed portions or directly onto the side walls. This bag relies on the provision of the<br>
central portion against which the pulling force on either one of the projecting parts is biased.<br>
Paper bags and plastic bags may have analogy by virtue of use, but not from the standpoint<br>
of practitioners of either art; techniques of manufacture in the business of cutting and gluing paper<br>
sheets are unlike those in the business of extruding thermoplastic materials. The former involves<br>
already-formed planar feedstock, laminating of multiple layers, cutting into patterned shapes that are<br>
perforated, crimped, glued, stapled, or stitched together, and requires knowledge of cutters, rollers,<br>
stitchers, and glues; whereas the latter involves pelletised feedstock that is mixed, pumped, heated,<br>
inflated, cooled, and those ordinarily skilled in the art require familiarity with melting points,<br>
extrusion of tubular material and expansion by a controlled bubble of air, frost lines, uniform or<br>
structured cooling rates. Training and qualification in the one would be a sparse recommendation<br>
for employment in the other. Most strikingly, even despite citing McDuffie, Hoover et al did not<br>
contemplate the use of offset main panels as an alternative to the additional pleats, and neither is<br>
there any evidence that McDuffie"s solution influenced any practice in the art of thermoplastic resin<br>
bags. In the case of Hoover et al, this implies either that McDuffie did not present itself as a<br>
solution, or that Hoover and proprietors chose to patent an inferior solution and rely on McDuffie"s<br>
solution not being realised by others.<br>
The number of patents addressing mechanical approaches to rendering supple bags easy to<br>
open is evidence of a long-felt need and the prospect of commercial returns from solutions to the<br>
problem. No convenient solution has so far been found, as is evidenced by the frustration many<br>
shoppers feel in the local supermarket.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a collapsed bag of unitary construction made of<br>
supple polymeric material, comprising first and second opposed contiguous flat sidewalls with<br>
joined lateral edges defining left and right sides of the bag and subject to interlayer cling; a bag<br>
mouth defined by upper edges of said sidewalls; said sidewalls being configured so that each has an<br>
exposed graspable sidewall portion, at least where proximate to said bag mouth, to permit that<br>
sidewall to be grasped independently of the other sidewall at said exposed graspable sidewall<br>
portion, the exposed graspable sidewall portions of said respective opposed sidewalls being located<br>
on laterally opposite edges of said bag, said exposed graspable sidewall portions thereby being<br>
diagonally opposed, and said sidewalls being joined such that they are laterally displaceable relative<br>
to each other, whereby a clinging tendency of the contiguous sidewalls to each other can be<br>
overcome by tensioning the exposed graspable portions against each other and laterally displacing<br>
relative to each other said sidewalls over substantially the full width between said exposed<br>
graspable portions to introduce a shearing action between said contiguous sidewalls.<br>
The invention further provides a collapsed bag of unitary construction made of supple<br>
polymeric material subject to interlayer cling, comprising first and second opposed contiguous flat<br>
sidewalls with joined lateral edges defining left and right sides of the bag; a bag mouth defined by<br>
upper edges of said sidewalls; said sidewalls being configured so that each has an exposed<br>
graspable sidewall portion, at least where proximate to said bag mouth, the exposed graspable<br>
sidewall portions of said respective opposed sidewalls being located on laterally opposite edges of<br>
said bag, said exposed graspable sidewall portions thereby being diagonally opposed, whereby a<br>
clinging tendency of the contiguous sidewalls to each other can be overcome by tensioning the<br>
exposed graspable portions against each other and laterally displacing relative to each other said<br>
sidewalls over substantially the full width between said exposed graspable portions to introduce a<br>
shearing action between said contiguous sidewalls; a pair of opposed side gussets located between<br>
said first and second opposed contiguous sidewalls, each said gusset having first and second gusset<br>
panels hingedly joined to respective side edges of said first and second sidewalls, said gusset panels<br>
being freely displaceable and deformable relative to said sidewalls; and said sidewalls being<br>
configured such that a said diagonally opposed pair of exposed graspable sidewall portions is<br>
provided proximate to said bag mouth, and wherein said graspable sidewall portions are exposed by<br>
weakenings, voids, truncations or openings formed in or adjacent to the lateral edge of said<br>
sidewalls and their associated gusset panels.<br>
The invention further provides a method of opening a collapsed bag of unitary construction<br>
made of supple polymeric material and having first and second opposed contiguous fiat sidewalls<br>
with joined lateral edges defining left and right sides of the bag and subject to interlayer cling, and a<br>
bag mouth defined by upper edges of said sidewalls, comprising the steps of : grasping exposed<br>
graspable sidewall portions of said respective opposed sidewalls located on laterally opposite edges<br>
of said bag independently of each other at said exposed graspable sidewall portions; and laterally<br>
displacing relative to each other said sidewalls, by a movement that may be relatively small, over<br>
substantially the full width between said exposed graspable portions to introduce a shearing action<br>
between said contiguous sidewalls and thereby overcome a clinging tendency of the contiguous<br>
sidewalls to each other to open the bag by tensioning the exposed graspable sidewall portions.<br>
The bag designed with such graspable tensioning points may otherwise be of almost any<br>
ordinary form, for example gusseted or plain, finished as a T-shirt or handle bag or with a flat top,<br>
with or without rack holes, supplied on rolls or in stacks, with or without blocked tabs, and in many<br>
cases can be made with existing machinery and materials.<br>
The present invention teaches that it is possible to render bags easily opened by providing<br>
graspable points for readily and positively shearing said first and second side-walls that are loosely<br>
statically and otherwise adhered to each other, and that shearing can thus be effected over the full<br>
width between tensioning points so that interlayer cling forces are instantly disrupted and the bag is<br>
rendered readily openable. In some cases the shearing action may generate repulsive static forces<br>
that assist opening. The amount of shearing movement is very small, possibly in the order of the<br>
wall thickness.<br>
More specifically, the invention proposes forming bags in such a way as to exploit the fact<br>
that if the front and rear walls of the bag can be forced to slide laterally against each other then most<br>
of the adhesion forces which commonly impede opening will be disrupted and an opening will<br>
spontaneously appear. This method allows considerable force to be applied to seperating the front<br>
and rear panels, and is a very positive method compared to other systems.<br>
For a flat bag, this can be exploited by designing each panel oi the bag to have a void<br>
exposing a portion of the other panel which can be grasped to tension the sidewalls<br>
against each other.<br>
For a gussetted bag, one method of exploiting is to design the edge pleating systems<br>
of the bags so that graspable regions are either placed, formed or revealed at the<br>
edges which are diagonally opposite and therefore directly connecting one to the<br>
front panel and the other to the rear panel so that said sliding of panels against each<br>
other can be effortlessly or easily caused by outward tugging of the graspable<br>
regions and the bag therefore easily opened.<br>
One method is to make asymmetrical gussets with exposed and graspable regions<br>
such that the most direct connection of the exposed tabs is at one edge to the front<br>
and at the other to the rear panel. Or instead of normal gussets any number of edge<br>
folds can be used provided the most direct connection of the exposed tabs is at one<br>
edge to the front and at the other to the rear panel.<br>
Another method is to fold in or over the front panel"s gusset pleat on one side of the<br>
bag and the back panel"s gusset pleat on the other side, thus leaving exposed on one<br>
side of the bag a gusset pleat directly continuous with the front panel and on the<br>
other side one continuous with the back panel. Another method is, near the bag<br>
mouth, to remove, shrink or weaken a portion of these diagonally opposite gusset<br>
pleats.<br>
Other methods follow from this key method: for example, the asymmetry can be<br>
limited to, or fold in diagonally opposite exterior pleats in, only a part (near the<br>
desired opening region) of one external pleat, or create the asymmetry in pleats, or<br>
create a tab only near the desired opening region; and for such methods do the same<br>
on the diagonally opposite pleat, so the remaining intact pleats most directly<br>
connected one to the front and the other to the rear panel become graspable regions<br>
that may be tugged in order to shear the front and rear panels, apart.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of<br>
opening a collapsed bag of unitary construction made of supple polymeric material<br>
subject to interlayer cling and having first and second opposed contiguous flat<br>
sidewalls with joined lateral edges defining left and right sides of the bag, and a bag<br>
mouth defined by upper edges of said sidewalls, comprising the steps of grasping<br>
exposed graspable sidewall portions of said respective opposed sidewalls located on<br>
laterally opposite edges of said bag; and laterally displacing relative to each other<br>
said sidewalls over substantially the full width between said exposed graspable<br>
portions to introduce a shearing action between said contiguous sidewalls and<br>
thereby overcome a clinging tendency of the contiguous sidewalls to each other to<br>
open the bag-<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
It will be generally understood that certain features typical and normal in the range<br>
of features found in manufacture need not be specified as such, for example the tops<br>
of bags may be plain, or finished as T-shirt bags, and can but need not have block<br>
tabs, rack holes, etc Likewise, certain other common features are to be assumed<br>
where required by common sense, for example the bottoms of bags are sealed.<br>
Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a section through mouth region of<br>
generalised bag 1 with hypothetical graspable region 2 to be tensioned in direction 3<br>
against hypothetical graspable region 4 tensioned in direction 5, causing first<br>
sidewall 6 and second sidewall 7 to shear in opposite directions thus firstly<br>
confirming correct identification by user of mouth end of bag, secondly shearing<br>
sidewalls 6 and 7 in directions as shown by arrows 8 and 9. Shearing disrupts<br>
interlayer cling between the first and second sidewalls between the grasped points 2<br>
and 3-<br>
This concept is applicable to gussetted bags. Figure 2 shows a section through<br>
mouth region of generalised gusseted bag 20 with hypothetical graspable region 22<br>
to be tensioned in direction 23 against hypothetical graspable region 24 tensioned in<br>
direction 25, causing first sidewall 26 and second sidewall 27 to shear in opposite<br>
directions 28 and 29 thus firstly confirming correct identification by user of mouth<br>
end of bag, secondly disrupting interlayer cling and separating the first and second<br>
sidewalls over the entire distance between the grasped points.22 and 24.<br>
Making the hypothetical graspable regions practical, Figure 3A shows a section<br>
through mouth region of bag 40 having offset gussets rendering graspable region 42<br>
which can be tensioned in direction 43 against graspable region 44 tensioned in<br>
direction 45, developing tension in first sidewall 46 and second sidewall 47, in<br>
opposite directions, between the grasped points 42 and 44- The thin vertical lines<br>
are to mark the positions of gusset pleat ends before and after tensioning the bag.<br>
Gusseted bag 40.1 shows the configuration after a small amount of movement in<br>
tension which has caused first sidewall 46.1 and second sidewall 47.1 to shear in<br>
opposite directions and interlayer cling to be disrupted between the grasped points<br>
42 and 44; being a supple material it lies loose after the two layers separate.<br>
To compare this with an item in the prior art. Figure 3B shows a section through<br>
mouth region of bag according to US 3,023,947 (to McDuffie) for a multi-wall paper<br>
bag: bag 440 of stiff material and having offset gussets, of which one set of pleats<br>
451 is glued together creating graspable region 442 which can be tensioned in<br>
direction 443 against graspable region 444 tensioned in direction 445, developing<br>
tension in first sidewall 446 and second sidewall 447, in opposite directions, between<br>
the grasped points 442 and 444- This tension results in compression on the free<br>
gussets 452, which rotate and act as planar struts pushing the semirigid sidewalls<br>
446 and 447 apart. Bag 440-1 is in the open configuration after laterally tensioning<br>
sidewall 447 against sidewall 446 has induced compression of the planar strut and<br>
caused it to rotate and push the sidewalls 446-1 and 447.1 apart. Unlike the present<br>
invention and also unlike others discussed above, US 3,023,947 results in a limitation<br>
of mouth opening to only about half of the general cross-sectional area of the bag. It<br>
will be further seen that the action and result differ, because planar struts are an<br>
impossibility in supple materials, and that the intent of McDuffie could not translate<br>
to supple materials except in the limited sense of making graspable the tensioning<br>
points.<br>
Revealing another approach to making the hypothetical graspable regions practical.<br>
Figure 4 shows a section through mouth region of bag 60 having in the region of the<br>
bag mouth openings in or truncated portions 69.1 of gusset panels rendering<br>
graspable region 62 which can be tensioned in direction 63 against hypothetical<br>
graspable region 64 tensioned in direction 65, developing tension in first sidewall 66<br>
and second sidewall 67, in opposite directions, between the grasped points 62 and<br>
64. A small amount of movement in tension causes first sidewall 66 and second<br>
sidewall 67 to shear in opposite directions 68 and 69 and interlayer cling to be<br>
disrupted between the grasped points 52 and 64.<br>
Revealing yet another approach to making the hypothetical graspable regions<br>
practical, Figure 5 shows a section through mouth region of bag 80 having refolded<br>
portions 89.1 of gussets creating graspable region 82 which can be tensioned in<br>
direction 83 against hypothetical graspable region 64 tensioned in direction 85,<br>
developing tension in first sidewall 86 and second sidewall 87, in opposite<br>
directions, between the grasped points 82 and 84- A small amount of movement in<br>
tension causes first sidewall 86 and second sidewall 87 to shear in opposite<br>
directions 88 and 89 and interlayer cling to be disrupted between the grasped points<br>
82 and 84. It will be seen by one ordinarily skilled in the art that the refolding could<br>
be inwards or outwards, or could take the form of a sub-gusset of the one pleat of a<br>
principal gusset.<br>
Making practical the hypothetical graspable regions illustrated in Figure 1, Figure 6<br>
shows a section through mouth region of a flat ungussetted bag 100 having region<br>
102, rendered graspably independent of sidewall 106 by opening 110 in sidewall 106,<br>
to be tensioned in direction 103 against graspable region 104, rendered graspably<br>
independent of sidewall 107 by opening 111 in sidewall 107, tensioned in direction<br>
105, causing first sidewall 106 and second sidewall 107 to shear in opposite<br>
directions 108 and 109 respectively. Tensioning by user has results of, firstly,<br>
confirming correct identification by user of mouth end of bag, secondly shearing<br>
sidewalls and thus disrupting interlayer cling between the first and second sidewalls<br>
106 and 107 between the grasped points 102 and 103.<br>
Further illustrating the sectional view of FIG. 3, Figure 7 shows a perspective view<br>
of bag 120 having offset gussets creating graspable region 122 which can be<br>
tensioned in direction 123 against graspable region 124 tensioned in direction 125,<br>
developing tension in upper edges of first sidewall 126 and second sidewall 127, in<br>
opposite directions, between the grasped points 122 and 124, and disrupting<br>
interlayer cling between the sidewalls under tension-<br>
Further illustrating the sectional view of Figure 5, Figure 8 shows a perspective view<br>
of bag 140 having refolded portions 149.1 of gussets creating graspable region 142<br>
which can be tensioned in direction 143 against hypothetical gTaspable region 64<br>
tensioned in direction 145, developing tension in first sidewall 146 and second<br>
sidewall 147, in opposite directions, between the grasped points 142 and 144- A<br>
small amount of movement in tension causes first sidewall 146 and second sidewall<br>
147 to shear in opposite directions 148 and 149 and interlayer cling to be disrupted<br>
between the grasped points 142 and 144- It will be seen by one ordinarily skilled in<br>
the art that the refolding could be inwards or outwards, or could take the form of a<br>
sub-gusset of the one pleat of a principal gusset-<br>
Further illustrating the sectional view of FIG- 4, FIG- 9 shows a perspective view of<br>
bag 160 having openings in or truncated portions 169.1 of gusset panels creating<br>
graspnble region 162 which can be tensioned in direction 163 against hypothetical<br>
graspable region 164 tensioned in direction 165, developing tension in first sidewall<br>
166 and second sidewall 167, in opposite directions, between the grasped points 162<br>
and 164. A small amount of movement in tension causes first sidewall 166 and<br>
second sidewall 167 to shear in opposite directions 168 and 169 and interlayer cling<br>
to be disrupted between the grasped points 162 and 164.<br>
The principles used above are also applicable to multipocketed bags, having various<br>
numbers of pockets These bags may for example be convenient to the user of a<br>
packaged product by containing separately yet keeping related in storage a number<br>
of ingredients to be later mixed or used in a common process. Convenience in terms<br>
of filling the pockets is firstly due to the ease of opening the pockets which is<br>
accomplished by laterally tugging from a gxaspable point while the common back or<br>
second sidewall remains held in the filling process. Convenience may thus also be<br>
facilitated by provision of such bags on a roll which can be fed through a filling<br>
station and remaining attached one bag to the next while fed also through a<br>
reclosing station after filling, and can either be left attached up to the product"s retail<br>
stage or can be detached at any time before that For the example of two pockets.<br>
Figure 10 shows a perspective view of a plurality of multipocketed bags 180 having<br>
similar features in each- The upper two bags are shown in ideal opened view, the<br>
lower bag is shown closed. First sidewall 186 is segmented according to the number<br>
of side by side pockets separated by weld 188 or a number of such welds, while<br>
second sidewall 187 is common to all pockets. Overextending gussets create<br>
graspable regions 182 and 184. Graspable region 182 can be tensioned in direction<br>
183, against the second sidewall 187 or any part of same that does not overlap with<br>
the first sidewall segment 186.1, to cause shearing of first sidewall segment 1861<br>
and second sidewall 187, thence opening of the pocket pertaining to first sidewall<br>
segment 186.1. Or it may be tensioned against graspabJe region 184 tensioned in<br>
direction 185 thus developing tension in upper edges of first sidewall 186 (left and.<br>
right segments 186.1 and 186.2) and second sidewall 187, in opposite directions,<br>
between the grasped points 122 and 124, and disrupting interlayer cling between the<br>
sidewalls under tension. A transverse weld 189 seals the bottom of the bag. If bags<br>
are made or supplied in sequence, a cut or weakening (respectively) 190 separates<br>
one bag from the next.<br>
The foregoing is considered illustrative of the principles of the invention. Other<br>
embodiments and variations as may occur to those skilled within the art are<br>
considered to fall within the scope of the invention.<br>

second sidewalls, said gusset panels being freely displaceable and deformable relative to said<br>
sidewalls, wherein said sidewalls are laterally offset, at least where proximate to the bag mouth, to<br>
leave protruding portions that provide exposed narrow graspable sidewall portions on each sidewall<br>
below said bag mouth, the exposed graspable sidewall portions of said respective opposed sidewalls<br>
being located on laterally opposite edges of said bag and being diagonally opposed, wherein each<br>
narrow graspable sidewall portion is less than the width of said pair of opposed side gussets, the<br>
method comprising:<br>
grasping said exposed graspable sidewall portions permitting a corresponding sidewall to be<br>
grasped independently of the other sidewall at said exposed graspable sidewall portion;<br>
tensioning said exposed graspable sidewall portions to introduce a shearing action between<br>
said first and second opposed contiguous flat sidewalls over substantially the full width between said<br>
exposed graspable sidewall; and<br>
laterally displacing said sidewalks relative to each other by a movement that may be relatively<br>
small, over substantially the full width between said exposed graspable portions.<br>
11. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein one of said exposed graspable portions may be<br>
passively restrained to reduce the number of hands or moving parts required to open the bag.<br>
A collapsed bag (40) of unitary construction made of supple polymeric material having first<br>
and second opposed contiguous flat sidewalls (46. 47) joined at edges and at the bottom but free or<br>
with user-releasable weakening at upper edges. The upper edges define a bag mouth. Appropriately<br>
situated graspable points (42, 44) at or near bag edges allow the sidewalls (46, 47) to be tcnsioned<br>
or snapped in opposing directions (43. 45) thereby causing the interlayer cling, to which supple<br>
polymeric bags are renownedly susceptible, to be readily disrupted for the full distance of contact<br>
between the tensioning points and thus for virtually the entirety of the bag mouth to be opened.</td>
