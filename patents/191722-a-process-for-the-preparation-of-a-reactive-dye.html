E:P-A-369 385 discloses azo-based reactive dyes which contain L—hydroxy-3-hydroxysulfonyl-7-(2-cyano—, 2-hydroxysulfonyl— or 2-carbamoylethylamino)naphthalene as a coupling component.<br>
Furthermore, Indian Patent Nos.138559 and 138633 describe reactive iyes of this class having 1—hydroxy-3-hydroxysulfonyl-7-methyl— sr phenylaminonaphthalene as a coupling component.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel reac¬tive dyes which are derived from phenylazonaphthalene dyes. The novel dyes should have advantageous performance characteristics.<br>
;^e have found that this object is achieved by the reactive dyes of the formula I which are defined at the outset.<br>
The novel reactive dyes of the formula I are each present in the form of the free aC1d. Of course, the claims also relate to the salts thereof.<br>
Suitable cations are derived from metal or ammonium ions. Metal ions are in particular the lithium, sodium or potassium ions. For the purposes of the present invention, ammonium ions are to be<br><br><br>
understood as meaning unsubstituted or substituted ammonium cations. Substituted ammonium cations are, for example, mono-alkyl-, dialkyl—, trialkyl-, tetraalkyl- or benzyltrialkyl-ammonium cations or cations which are derived from nitrogen-containing 5— or 6-imembered saturated heterocycles, such as pyrrolidinium, piperidinium, morpholinium, piperazinium or N-alkylpiperazinium cations or the N-monoalkyl- or N,N-dialkyl-substituted products thereof. Alkyl is to be understood in general as meaning straight-chain or branched C1-C2o-al}<yl which may be substituted by hydroxyl and interrupted oxygen as an ether function.></yl>
All alkyl and alkylene radicals occurring in the abovementioned<br>
formula I may be either straight-chain or branched.<br>
If substituted alkyl groups occur in the abovementioned formula I, they have, as a rule, 1 or 2 substituents.<br>
If substituted phenyl, phenylene or benzenetriyl groups occur in the abovementioned formula, suitable substituents are, for example, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, halogen, hydroxysulfonyl, sulfamoyl or C1-C^-mono— or dialkylsulfamoyl, unless stated other¬wise. In this case, they have, as a rule, from 1 to 3, preferably 1 or 2, substituents.<br>
If R- and R1, together wiuh the nitrogen atom linking them, form a 5-membered or 6-membered saturated heterocyclic radical which may have further hetero atoms, suitable radicals of this type are, for example, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpho-linyl, thiomorpholinyl S,S-dioxide, piperazinyl or N-(C].-C4-al-kyDpiperazinyl, such as N-methyl- or N-ethylpiperazinyl.<br>

where L^.^ L2 and L^, independently of one another, are each C1-C4-alkyl or benzyl and An® in each case is one equivalent of an anion. Suitable anions are, for example, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, mono—, di- and trichloroacetate, methanesul-fonate, benzenesulfonate and 2— or 4-methylbenzenesulfonate.<br>
Anchors E1 and E1  are those which undergo a substitution or addi¬tion reaction with the hydroxy1-containing or nitrogen-containing groups of the substrates to be treated.<br>
That the anchor undergoes a substitution reaction with the rele¬vant groups in the substrates, for example with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, means that the leaving groups or leaving atoms (for example fluorine and chlorine) in the anchor are sub¬stituted by the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose according to the following scheme:<br><br><br>
heterocyclic anchors E1 and E2 are, for example, halogen-substi-:uted radicals of 1,3,5-triazine, quinoxaline, phthalazine, py-rimidine or pyridazone, or a 2-alkylsulfonylbenzothiazole radical.<br>
