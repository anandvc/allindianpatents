				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to syphonically operated flushing device which is suitably adjusted for flushing solid or liquid waste. In particular this device reduces the wastes of water.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Water is scarce and has to be saved by using it carefully, economizing the use of water, avoid wastage of water and to flush the water as required. Individuals, States &amp; Countries have been advocating and implementing various measures and means to conserve water.<br>
One of the area, which has drawn attention of all of us, is to use less water as far as possible for flushing, in the cistern. Earlier the capacity of the cisterns was 12.5 liters to 15 liters. Now, even ISI had recommended the capacity of the cistern as 10 liters. It is a well-known fact that even 8 liter capacity cistern is sufficient to clean excreta in the W.C. and 3 liter capacity would be sufficient to clean the W.C. after urination. The present scenario is that the toilets of all old buildings, particularly Govt. Rental houses, Govt. Offices, Schools, Colleges and Hospitals are pre-dominantly using old cistern of 12.5 liters capacity and/or 15 liters capacity. We can save, on an average with one flushing water to the tune of 7 to 8 liters. Thus in fact, the average water consumed with old cistern is double the actual requirement. The problem is acute and lot of water will be saved if the extra use of water can be checked.<br>
Government of India and many other departments had advocated changing the old cistern with new cistern. Well, water would be saved however, it is highly cost intensive and the departments are either reluctant to do it due to shortage of funds or plan to do it in phases. The problem is well appreciated since change of each cistern would cost about Rs. 855.00. The result is that we are unable to change the cistern and we continue to waste scarce water.<br><br>
As per new proposed technique, objective of saving water can be achieved cent percent without substantially changing old cistern at almost no cost. Moreover, the technique proposed is simple and can be implemented straightaway. We will be able to make the old cistern to discharge water of the capacity as we want. For example., 15 litres or 12.5 litres capacity, old cistern can be converted to discharge 8 litres of water and act as 8 litres capacity cistern and further as per the additional technique the modified 8 litres capacity cistern can be used to flush only 3 liter water to clean the W.C. after urination.<br>
In this connection it is pointed out that more water can be saved by using present flushing device. The working of Cast Iron(CI) high level cistern of 12.5 to 15 liter capacity is very smooth, efficient, durable and life long, flushes the solid waste with more pressure due to height of water, least maintenance, economical, useful for public as well as residential buildings instead of latest designed cisterns of smaller size generally made out of PVC and are not useful specially in public buildings because these are damaged by the public after a very short period due to its rough handling.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a siphonically operated flushing device for flushing cisterns. The flushing device comprising a cistern having a front wall, rear wall, a pair of laterally spaced side walls and a bottom wall that forms an open top water chamber,<br>
means provided at the inlet in the cistern to control the inflow of the water, a water inlet provided in one of the said side wall of the cistern, a drain outlet provided at the bottom wall of the cistern and means provided in the cistern to actuate spilling of the enclosed water in the cistern. The said means is having at least a hole for introducing the air and interrupting the flow of flushing water. The cistern is of high level or low level cistern. The means to initiate siphon action is a bell placed over the flush pipe in high level cistern. The Flush pipe is provided at its has its upper end projection, protruding a little above the maximum water level in the cistern, while its lower end discharges into the WC pan. The flush pipe is of 32 mm bore in a high level Cast Iron (CI) cistern. The bell is made out of cast iron in a high level CI cistern. The Cl bell is connected to a lever arm which in turn connected to chain for lifting and releasing the bell. The bell is having a hole of 25 mm diameter and preferably having diametrically equal and opposite holes of 12.7 mm diameter. The hole(s) are at a height of 95 mm from the base of the bell. The means provided at the inlet are the water level controlled device. The syphon having a movable plunger plate to initiate siphon action in low level cistern. The plunger plate is having rubber washer on the top of it. The syphon is made of Chinaware in low level cistern. The low level cistern is having a handle which is connected to a lever to move the plunger plate for actuating siphon action. The hole is of minimum 1 inch diameter on the top of the syphon for air passing in low level cistern. The hole is drilled or molded in the direction parallel to water level and perpendicular to vertical axis of syphon. It is acute angle with respect to water level and obtuse angle with respect to vertical axis. The hole is provided with an air valve for allowing the air to enter into the siphon and to break the siphon action. The air valve is connected to a push button which is provided at the top of the cover to control the capacity of water flushed.<br>
The CI cistern made out of cast iron is having a suitable cover with a sump formed in the center through which a flush pipe of 32 mm bore passes. The flush pipe has its upper end projecting a little above the maximum water level in the cistern, while its lower end discharges into the WC pan. This vertical part which is of cast iron where the siphonic action occurs is indicated as syphon. And this is covered up in the cistern by a CI bell to the top of which a lever arm with a chain is attached. On pulling the<br>
chain, the bell is lifted and on releasing it, it is lowered to its original position. As a result of this movement, the water enclosed is spilled over the top of the flushing pipe(Syphon), causing siphonic action and there by emptying entire contents of the cistern.<br>
The bell is taken out after marking the level of quantity of that we want to reduce in addition to the quantity of water that comes back at the last stage of flushing process because as and when the air through slots enters into the bell, the quantity of water which is in action comes back which is about to be 1 liter. A point is located and a hole or two holes are made on the opposite side or a slot will lift the bell up and on releasing it, it is lowered to its original position. The siphonic action will take place, the water starts flowing into the WC through flush pipe. The level of water inside the cistern starts coming down and when the level of water reaches at this hole which was earlier emerged in water, it comes in contact with air, and air through this hole will enter into the bell and break the siphonic action. Thus, the quantity of water below this hole will not flush and further intake of water is reduced to our requirement. In this way the capacity of flushing water of these old CI high-level cisterns can be reduced to conserve water and need not be replaced.<br>
Further, there are three more options for new cisterns vide which the bell shaped part of the CI high level cistern can be made/manufactured.<br>
1.	The slots are molded vertically in the bell shaped part as shown in figure No.<br>
6.<br>
2.	The slots are molded horizontally in the cylindrical part of the bell as shown in<br>
figure No. 7.<br>
3.	The number of holes are drilled or molded in the bell as shown in figure 8.<br>
The water will enter inside the bell during siphonic action through these slots/holes. In addition to this approach there is another approach for reducing flushing capacity of old CI cistern of 12.5 or 15 liter capacity to 8 to 10 liter. We would like to explain another method for further reducing the flushing capacity of these old cisterns because<br>
when we pass urine in W.C. very small quantity of water for flushing liquid waste/ urine is required. On the contrary all the water is wasted just to flush liquid waste/urine. According to this method there is no financial implication, but only the general public is required to be educated through media/press by giving wide publicity. The method/theory is given as under:-<br>
That when we pull the chain of lever and release it, the lever then lifts the bell up and it comes back to its original position. As a result of this movement a syphon action takes place and the water starts flowing into the WC through flush pipe. In case the flow of water is not checked at this stage, it will discharge all the water. But we require very small quantity of water for flushing urine to save the water. After a second the chain has to be pulled again gently/slowly to its maximum and kept in the pulling position. By doing this the bell will go up and remain in hanging position as shown in the enclosed figure 4. The position of hole or slot will attain height and when water level reaches this hole, the hole will come in contact with air and air through this hole will enter into the bell and break the syphon action at that height. After that release the chain slowly. By using this method of pulling the chain only 3 to 4 litre of water will be flushed instead of 8 to 10 litres of water. In this way we can save more water. Thus these old CI cisterns fulfill our requirement and are fit for new as well as existing buildings. Hence it is suggested we may not replace these cisterns to save water and money for Government exchequer. It is further added that the bell inside the cisterns is a weighted item, which needs more water for its proper functioning like a whale in the sea. Thus the quantity of stored water in the cisterns should not be less but flushing capacity can be fixed by using the above suggested method.<br>
Existing Chinaware Low Level Cistern of 10 litres Capacity having Chinaware Syphon:<br>
The existing chinaware Low Level Cistern were designed to flush excreta only and discharges 10 liters of water per flushing, we require small quantity of water to flush urine and provision for this is not there in these cisterns. Thus a lot of water goes to<br>
waste. We can save water in these cisterns by replacing its syphon and cover to the above mentioned proposed design of syphon and cover in which provision for installation of an air valve is suggested which will allow the air to enter into the syphon by pushing the button provided at the top of the cover to break the syphon action as and when required. In this way we will be able to reduce the capacity of these cisterns to our requirement i.e. For flushing excreta and for flushing urination. The proposed design of the cistern is explained in the accompanying figures.<br><br><br>
