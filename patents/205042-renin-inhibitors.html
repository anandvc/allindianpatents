The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or adjuvant The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise in addition one or more compounds active against restenosis, glaucoma, cardiac infarct, high blood pressure and end organ damage, e.g. cardiac insufficiency and kidney insufficiency. Examples for these additional compounds are angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors, e.g. captopril, lisinopril, enalapril and cilazapril; angiotensin^ l)-receptor antagonists, e.g. lorsartan and valsartan; diuretica, e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, mefrusid and furosemid; endothelin receptor antagonists, e.g. bosentan; endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors or neutral endopeptidase inhibitors; calcium channel blockers (antagonists), e.g. nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem; nitrates, e.g. glyceroltrinitrates (nitroglycerin) and isosorbid-dinitrates; beta-receptor blockers, e.g. carvedilol, alprenolol and propranolol; alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists, e.g. prazosin and terazosin; and reserpin.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention refers to the use of a compound as defined above for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment or prophylaxis of restenosis, glaucoma, cardiac infarct, high blood pressure and end organ damage, e.g. cardiac insufficiency and kidney insufficiency.<br>
An additional embodiment of the invention relates to a method for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of disorders in which renin plays a significant pathological role, especially restenosis, glaucoma, cardiac infarct, high blood pressure and end organ<br><br>
damage, e.g. cardiac insufficiency and kidney insufficiency which method comprises administering a compound as defined above to a human being or an animal.<br>
The compounds as defined above maybe manufactured by cleaving off the protecting group P and optionally hydroxy protecting groups which may be present in compounds of formula (II)<br><br>
wherein P represents a NH-protecting group and the remaining symbols have the significance given above wherein hydroxy groups which may be contained in R , R , and<br>
3<br>
R may optionally be present in protected form. If desired, reactive groups may be functionally modified in the thus-obtained compound of formula I (e.g. into esters) and/or converted into a pharmaceutically usable salt<br>
The cleavage of a protecting group P and hydroxy protecting groups which may be present can be carried out in a manner known per se. Examples of protecting groups P are usual amino protecting groups such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, allyioxycarbonyl, vinyloxycarbonyl, alkylsilylalkyloxycarbonyl such as 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyi, and trichloroethoxycarbonyl. Examples of hydroxy protecting groups are ether protecting groups such as tetrahydropyranyl, allyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, trityl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl or ester protecting groups such as acetyl. Examples of diol protecting groups are cyclic ether protecting groups such as isopropylidene or benzylidene.<br>
The cleavage of these protecting groups is effected by acidic or basic hydrolysis, by reductive methods or by means of Lewis acids or fluoride salts. A solution of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric £cid, phosphoric acid and the like in an inert solvent or solvent mixture is advantageously used for the acidic hydrolysis. Suitable solvents are alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofiiran or dioxan, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, and the like. Alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal carbonates such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide<br><br>
or potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate, organic amines such as piperidine, and the like can be used for the basic hydrolysis. Inert organic solvents as referred to above for the acidic hydrolysis can be used as solubilizers. The reaction temperature for the acidic and basic hydrolysis can be varied in a range from 0°C to the reflux temperature, with the reaction preferably being carried out at between about 0°C and room temperature. The tert-butoxycarbonyl group is conveniently cleaved off with hydrochloric acid, hydrogen chloride, trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid in the presence or absence of an inert solvent. Furthermore, the tert-butoxycarbonyl group can be cleaved off by means of anhydrous zinc bromide in the presence of an inert solvent, preferably methylene chloride* The cleavage of the trichloroethoxycarbonyl group can be advantageously effected reductively with zinc in glacial acetic acid. The reaction temperature can lie in a range of 0°C to 40°C, with the reaction preferably being carried out at room temperature. The cleavage of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl group can be effected by means of fluoride ions in the presence of an inert solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran, preferably by means of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures from about 0°C to about room temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are novel and are also an object of the invention. Their preparation is described in more detail hereinafter in Schemes 1-4 and in the Examples.<br><br><br>
Derivatives of general formula 2 in which P1 has, in addition to the meanings of P1, the meaning of benzyl or (R)- or (S)-2-phenethyl, can be obtained by alkylation of the 3-hydroxy function in a suitably N^-O-di-protected 4-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-l,23&gt;6-tetrahydro-pyridin-3-ol of the general formula 1. The alkylation can be performed in solvents as ethers, like tetrahydrofiiran and 1,2-dimethoxyethane, N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide with aliphatic chlorides, bromides, iodides, tosylates or mesylates in the presence of a base like sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide. The alkylating agents used can contain optionally suitably protected functional groups which allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the synthesis. Hydroboration of the ether compounds formed (general formula 2) followed by subsequent basic oxidative working-up produces compounds of the general formula 3 with high diastereoselectivity, the isomer bearing only equatorial substituents at the piperidine ring being formed almost exclusively. The absolute stereochemistry at carbon 3 of the piperidine ring remains unaffected during the transformation of compounds i to compounds 3. The hydroboration can be effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g.<br><br>
1,2-dimethoxyethane, at a temperature between about 0°C and 70°C, and with a diborane-containing or diborane-liberating reagent such as e.g. borane in tetrahydrofiiran or a mixture of sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride etherate. The carboboranes which are formed as intermediates can be converted into the secondary alcohols of general formula 3 by reaction with bases, e.g. potassium hydroxide, and an oxidizing agent, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C. Removal of the N- and O-protective functions and reintroduction of a optionally different N-protective group (P3), e.g. a N-Boc group, by well established procedures as e.g.: hydrogenolysis with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst followed by introduction of the Boc group with di-tert-butyldicarbonate in dioxan/water converts compounds of the general formula 3 into a compound of the general formula 4 bearing a phenolic and an aliphatic OH-function which can be derivatized selectively.<br>
Selective derivatization of the phenolic function in compounds of general formula 4 can be performed by alkylation reactions using aliphatic chlorides, bromides, iodides, tosylates or mesylates in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate in solvents such as an ether like tetrahydrofiiran, in N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, methyl-ethyl-ketone, or pyridine at temperatures between 0°C and 140°C leading to compounds of the general formula 5. The substituent introduced can function as a protecting group, being e.g. an allyl ether, or can be a unit which contains optionally suitably protected functional groups to allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the synthesis or consist of the whole substituent desired. Derivatization at the secondary hydroxy function of the piperidine ring can than be performed in solvents as ethers, like tetrahydrofiiran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or in N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of an anion-forming base, like sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide, and a suitable alkylating agent, preferentially an aryl methyl chloride, bromide, mesylate or tosylate at temperatures between 0°C and 40°C thus giving compounds of the general formula 6. If R"1 represents allyl, then this protective function can be replaced by a suitable substituent at any stage of the synthesis, e.g. by treatment with a palladium catalyst as palladium-II-acetate in the presence of triphenylphosphine and lithiumborohydride in a solvent like tetrahydrofiiran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane followed by an alkylation procedure as described above.<br><br><br>
In case R l contains a diol function protected as 1,3-dioxolane derivative, then the free diol can be liberated using hydrochloric acid in methanol, a procedure which also liberates the secondary amino function of the piperidine ring, if protected with a Boc-protective group. The Boc-protective function can optionally be reintroduced using di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate in a solvent, like a mixture of water and dioxane, methanol or acetonitril, in the presence of a base, like sodium hydrogencarbonate or triethylamine, leading to compounds of the general formula 7. A primary/secondary diol unit can be modified by transformation of e.g. the primary hydroxy function into a leaving group, e.g. a tosyloxy- or a mesyloxy- group. Selective tosylation of a primary hydroxy function in the presence of a secondary hydroxy function can be performed with tosyl chloride in a solvent like pyridine. If an excess of tosyl chloride is used, a short reaction time can prevent the formation of substantial amounts of the undesired ditosylate. Treatment of the monotosylate with base, e.g. with sodium hydroxide in dimethylsulfoxide, affords the corresponding oxiran 8. Optionally, the oxiran 8 can be prepared from the corresponding<br><br>
diol in a one step procedure by using reagents as diethoxytriphenylphosphorane (DTPP) in a solvent like dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran, ether or 1,2-dimethoxyethane at temperatures between 40°C and 100°C under essentially neutral conditions (P. L. Robinson; J. W. Kelly; S. A. Evans, J. R. Phosphorus and Sulfur 1986,26,12-24). The oxiran opens regioselectively at the less hindered site when reacted with an alkali salt of an alcohol as methanol or methoxyethanol or an alkali salt of a heterocycle as [l,2,4]triazol or imidazol in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide&gt; dimethylsulfoxide or an ether like tetrahydrofuran to give compounds of the general formula 9. Final removal of e.g. a Boc-protective group can be performed in the presence of acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, trifluoroactic acid in a variety of solvents such as alcohols and alcohol/water mixtures, ethers and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The Boc-protective group can also be removed with anhydrous zinc bromide in inert solvents such as dichloromethane leading to compounds of the general formula 10.<br><br><br><br>
Derivatives of general formula .14 in which Pr has, in addition to the meanings of P1, the meaning of benzyl can be obtained in accordance with Scheme 3 from the compound of general formula il (with R being e.g. methyl or ethyl; commercially available compounds, e.g. Aldrich) by reduction to the diol analogously to the process described by E. Jaeger and J. H. Biel in J. Org. Chem. 30(3), 740-744 (1965), followed by the introduction of a suitable protecting group for the primary alcohol, e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, preferably trityL The oxidation of the secondary alcohol of general formula 13 can be carried out in manner known per se, e.g. by using oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulphoxide as described by A. J. Mancuso and D. Swern in Synthesis 1981,165, to yield the ketone of general formula 14.<br>
Compounds of general formula .16 can be obtained by reacting compounds of general formula 14 in a manner known per se with metal-organic derivatives, preferably lithium or magnesium derivatives, prepared from compounds of general formula 15 wherein P2 represents lower-alkoxy, preferably methoxy, or benzyloxy.<br>
The reaction with such a metal-organic compound is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, at a temperature between about -78 C and 75 C.<br>
The compounds of general formula Y7_can be obtained therefrom in the presence of an acid or another water-cleaving reagent, optionally in the presence of a base, in an organic solvent As acids there come into consideration e.g. hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or p-toluenesulphonic acid, and as the water-cleaving reagent there can be used e.g. phosphorus oxytrichloride in pyridine. The reaction temperature lies between 0-120 C; as solvents there can be used e.g. toluene, dimethylformamide or alcohols.<br>
Compounds of general formula .18 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 17 by hydroboration and subsequent basic oxidative working-up. The hydroboration can be effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. 1,2-dimethoxyethane, at a temperature between about 0°C and 70 C, and with a diborane-containing or diborane-liberating reagent such as e.g. borane in tetrahydrofuran or a mixture of sodium borohydride and boron trifluoride etherate. The carboboranes which are formed as intermediates can be converted into the secondary alcohols of general formula Jj8 by reaction with bases, e.g. potassium hydroxide, and an oxidizing agent, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, at a temperature between about room temperature and 120°C. Hydroboration of compounds of the general formula .17, followed by basic oxidative<br><br>
working-up produces compounds of the general formula 18 with high diastereoselectivity; the isomer bearing only equatorial substituents at the piperidine ring is almost exclusively formed.<br>
Compounds of formula 18 in which P" is lower-alkoxy can be converted into compounds of general formula 19 by an alkyl-aryl ether cleavage. The ether cleavage is effected according to methods known per se by, preferably starting from compounds in which P2 has the meaning methoxy, reacting the alkyl-aryl ether with mineral acids such as hydrobromic acid or hydroiodic acid or preferably with Lewis acids such as boron trichloride or boron tribromide in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon, at a temperature between about -10°C and room temperature. Under these conditions, the protecting group P4 which, preferably, has the meaning trityl, tert-butyl-diphenylsilyl or tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl, is also cleaved.<br>
Compounds of formula 19 in which P" is benzyl can be converted into compounds of general formula 20 by hydrogenolysis with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst in an inert solvent or solvent mixture. Suitable solvents are alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, ethyl acetate and the like, at temperatures from about 0° C to 40° C.<br>

Compounds of general formula 21 can be used as starting materials for the preparation of compounds of general formula 22 in which R22 is the group -(CKb^-O-R2 with the meanings referred to above. The linkage of the group -(GH^-O-R can be effected selectively by reaction with a derivative of the group to be introduced which carries a suitable leaving group. The selective linkage with the phenolic alcohol is effected according to alkylation methods which are known per se in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. Chlorides, bromides, iodides, tosylates or mesylates come into consideration as alkylating agents. The reaction is effected in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as e.g. an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as e.g. toluene, pyridine, acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, at a temperature between about 0 C and 100 C.<br>
Compounds of general formula 23 can be obtained by introduction of a protecting group P4 selective for primary alcohols and selectively cleavable at an appropriate later stage of die reaction sequence in presence of the N-protecting group and the other functionalities. Examples of such hydroxy protecting groups are tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, and preferably trityl.<br>
Compounds of general formula 24 can be obtained from 23 by alkylation with a compound which yields the group -CH2-R1. The alkylation of the secondary alcohol is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or dimethylformamide, with the aid of an alcoholate-forming base, e.g. sodium hydride, at a temperature between about 0 C and 40 C and using a halide, preferably chloride or bromide, or a sulfonic acid ester, e.g. a mesylate or tosylate, as the compound which yields the group -CH2-R1.<br>
Compounds of general formula 25 can be obtained from 24 by selective cleavage of protecting group P4. The cleavage of these protecting groups is effected by acidic hydrolysis or by means of Lewis acids. The trityl group is conveniently cleaved off with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid anhydride in the presence of an inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane in a very short time at temperatures from about —10° C to 0° C. The cleavage of the silyl protecting groups can be effected by means of fluoride ions in the presence of an inert solvent such as acetonitril, dimethylsulphoxide, N,N-dimethylfbrmamide or tetrahydrofuran, preferably by means of tetrabutyiammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures from about 0° C to about room temperature.<br>
Compounds of general formula 26 can be obtained from 25 by alkylation with a compound which yields the group R33, where R33 has the meaning of H-[CH(OR4)]2-CH2-.<br><br>
The alkylation of the primary alcohol is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or dimethylformamide, with the aid of an alcoholate-forming base, e.g. sodium hydride, at a temperature between about 0° C and 40° C and using a halide, preferably chloride or bromide, or a sulfonic acid ester, e.g. a mesylate or tosylate, as the compound which yields the group R33. Optionally, the alkylating agents used can contain suitably protected functional groups which allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the reaction sequence. As alkylating agent there comes into consideration e.g. allylbromide which then can be hydroxylated according to methods known per se, or (R)-(-)-2,2-dimethyl«4-(hydroxymethyl)-[l,3]dioxolane-p-toluenesulfonate. In case the diol function is protected as a 1,3-dioxolane derivative, then the free diol can be liberated using hydrochloric acid in methanol, a procedure which also liberates the secondary amino function of the piperidine rihg, if protected by a Boc-group. The Boc-protective function can optionally be reintroduced using di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate in a solvent, like a mixture of water and dioxane, methanol or acetonitril, in the presence of a base, like sodium hydrogencarbonate or triethylamine. The resulting primary/secondary diol unit can be manipulated analogously as described for compounds of the general formula 8,9 and JJ).<br>
Compounds of general formula 27 in which R54 is imidazolyl or triazolyl can be obtained from compounds of general formula 25. The reaction is effected according to methods known per se, for example in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or N.N-dimethylformamide, with the aid of an anion-forming base, e.g. sodium hydride, at a temperature between about 0° C and 40° C and using a sulfonic acid ester, e.g. a tosylate, mesylate or triflate, as the activated derivative of the primary alcohol.<br>
Compounds of general formula 27 where R54 has the meaning of H~[CH(OR4)J2-can be obtained by transforming compounds of general formula 25 into the corresponding halides, preferably into chlorides or bromides, reacting thsm with metallorganic reagents according to methods known per se, e.g. with vinylmagnesium bromide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran, and hydroxylating them according to methods known per se.<br>
Piperidines of general formula 25* 26 and 27 can also be obtained in optically pure form. Separation into antipodes can be effected according to methods known per se, preferably at an early stage of the synthesis by salt formation with an optically active acid. For example, compounds of general formula 18 in which Pr has the meaning of benzyl can be obtained in their optically pure form by treatment with (+)- or (-)- mandelic acid and separation of the diastereomeric salts by fractional crystallization. Or, at a later stage, by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary substance such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-<br><br>
camphamoyl chloride and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallization and subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chiral auxiliary substance. In order to determine the absolute configuration of the piperidine derivative obtained, the pure diastereomeric salts and derivatives can be analyzed by conventional spectroscopic methods, with X-ray spectroscopy on single crystals being an especially suitable method.<br>
Starting compounds I are known in the art and may be prepared according to the methods described in WO97/09311 or according to a reaction wherein a compound of formula 28 or a salt thereof<br><br>
wherein A is arylene; R1' is -C*R3 R4 Ry; R2' is -O-alkyI, -O-cycloalkyI, -O-alkenyl, or a group-OP2 as defined above, -O-aryl, -O-aralkyl, -O-aralkoxyalkyl, -O-alkylsulfonyl, -<br>
3'	4*	5*<br>
O-arylsulfonyl, chlorine, bromine or iodine; R   is hydrogen; R  is aryl; R is alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, aryl, alkoxyalkyl or hydroxyalkyl; and, wherein C* is an asymmetric carbon<br>
atom;<br>
is epoxidated, optionally followed by isolation of the desired stereoisomer, resulting in<br>
a compound of formula 29<br><br><br>
The reaction may be performed by transforming a compound of general formula 28 into a halohydrinejwhich by treatment with base gives the epoxide of general formula 29.<br>
In detail, examples for compounds which are known for use in such epoxidation reactions are halogens and organic bromo-compounds such as N-bromosucrinimide, dibromoisocyanurate and l,3-dibromoo,5-dimethylhydantoin. Preferred is bromine, especially in the presence of an acid, preferably HBr and chemical equivalents thereof. Inert solvents taken alone or in combination can be used, particularly, solvents which are known for their utilization in epoxidation reactions. Examples of such solvents are straight or cyclic ethers dimethylether, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran and monoglyme or diglyme alone or in such a combination that a sufficient miscibility with water is given. A preferred solvent is dioxane. Preferred is the above reaction in the presence of an acid. Examples of such acids are optically active or inactive acids such as the hydrohalic acids, sulfonic acids and H2SO4. Particularly preferred is HBr. In general the above reaction can be performed in a wide pH range. Preferred is a pH range from about 1 to 4 and particularly preferred is a pH range from about 1,5 to 3. A temperature range of from about -20°C to the boiling point of the solvent is suitable for the reaction of the present invention. The preferred temperature range is between about -20°C to about 20°C preferably from about 0°C to about 5°C<br>
The above reaction is followed by addition of a base such as NaOH, KOH, or a nitrogen-base such as triethylamine. Preferred is the use of NaOH or KOH. The temperature range for the addition of the base is between -20°C and the boiling point of the solvent. Preferred is a temperature range between -20°C and 20°C. Particularly preferred is the addition of the base between 0°C and 5°C. In case the epoxidising agent reacts with a compound of the formula 28 without addition of an acid, the epoxide can be obtained without using a base.<br>
According to the above process compounds of formula 29 are formed as a mixture of stereoisomers and particularly as a mixture of diastereomers, or only one of the diastereomers is formed. In a preferred aspect one of the diastereomers is formed preferably. Optionally the desired stereoisomer especially diastereomer can be isolated by methods known in the art such as crystallisation, chromatography or distillation, preferably crystallisation or chromatography. These methods also include the formation of salts or derivatives of compounds of the formula 29 and in a following step the separation of these salts or derivatives by the above methods. These methods, especially methods for the separation of diastereoisomers are well known in the art and<br><br>
are for example described in Houben-Weyl, Methods of Organic Chemistry (pp. Vol. E21,p.81,91).<br>
Allylic alcohols of general formula 1 can be obtained from compounds of general formula 29 by rearrangement of the epoxide by a base. A preferred method is the reaction with a metal alcoholate such as potassium t-butoxide, aluminium isopropoxide, titanium (IV) t-butoxide, with a lithium amide such as lithium diisopropylamide or with an organolithium compound such as phenyllithium, scc-butyllithium or methyllithium to give a compound of the general formula L<br>
Moreover, a preferred aspect of the above process is the reaction of a compound of the formula 29 or a salt thereof, with phenyllithium. Particularly preferred is the above reaction, wherein the desired stereoisomer of a compound of the formula 29 reacts with phenyllithium. Solvents for this reaction taken alone or in combination are for example: ethers such as tetrahydrofiiran, diethyl ether, or tert-butyl methyl ether, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or chlorobenzene or pyridine. The solvent, which is preferred, depends on the reagent. In the case of phenyllithium as the reagent, tert-butyl methyl ether is a particularly preferred solvent.<br>
The rearrangement of the epoxide can be performed in a temperature range from about -40°C up to the boiling of the solvent. Preferred is a temperature range from about -25°C up to 0°C. Particularly preferred is a temperature of about -15°C.<br>
The present invention relates to all compounds of formula (I), whenever prepared by one of the processes described above.<br>
The invention also relates to compounds as defined above for the treatment of diseases which are associated with restenosis, glaucoma, cardiac infarct, high blood pressure and end organ damage, e.g. cardiac insufficiency and kidney insufficiency.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable salts have an inhibitory activity on the natural enzyme renin. The latter passes from the kidneys into the blood and there brings about the cleavage of angiotensinogen with the formation of the decapeptide angiotensin I which is then cleaved in the lungs, the kidneys and other organs to the octapeptide angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure not only directly by arterial constriction, but also indirectly by the liberation of the sodium ion-retaining hormone aldosterone from the adrenal gland, with which is associated an increase in the extracellular fluid volume. This increase is attributed to the action of angiotensin II itself or to that of the hepapeptide angiotensin III which is formed therefrom as a cleavage<br><br>
product. Inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of renin bring about a decrease in the formation of angiotensin I and as a consequence of this the formation of a smaller amount of angiotensin II. The reduced concentration of this active peptide hormone is the direct reason for the blood pressure-lowering activity of renin inhibitors.<br>
The in-vitro potency of renin inhibitors can, as described by W. Fischli et al. in Hypertension, Vol. 18 (1), 22-31 (1991) or Hypertension Vol. 22 (1), 9-17 (1993) be demonstrated experimentally by means of the tests described hereinafter. The tests can be carried out in analogy to those described by D. T. Pals et al. in Hypertension Vol. 8,1105-1112 (1986) or J. Boger et al. in J. Med. Chem. 28,1779-1790 (1985) or J. F. DeUaria et al. in J. Med. Chem. 30,2137-2144 (1987) or T. Kokubu et al. in Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 118,929-933 (1984):<br>
In vitro test with pure human renin:<br>
The test is carried out in Eppendorf test tubes. The incubation mixture consists of (1) 100 pi of human renin in buffer A (0.1 M sodium phosphate solution, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide and 1 mM ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid), sufficient for a renin activity of 2-3 ng of angiotensin I/ml/hr.; (2) 145 }il of buffer A: (3) 30 \i\ of 10 mM human tetradecapeptide renin substrate (hTD) in 10 mM hydrochloric acid: (4) 15 jol of dimethyl sulphoxide with or without inhibitor and (5) 10 pi of a 0.03 molar solution of hydroxyquinoline sulphate in water.<br>
The samples are incubated for three hours at 37°C and, respectively, 4°C in triplicate. 2 x 100 pi samples per test tube are used in order to measure the production of angiotensin I via RIA (standard radioimmunoassay; clinical assay solid phase kit). Cross reactivities of the antibody used in the RIA are: angiotensin 1100%; angiotensin II 0.0013%; hTD (angiotensin I-Val-Ile-His-Ser-OH) 0.09%. The production of angiotensin I is determined by the difference between the test at 37°C and that at 4°C.<br>
The following controls are carried out:<br>
n—i.     i mil ii—	^	■	i    .IIWIB	.ii<br>
(a)	Incubation of hTD samples without renin and without inhibitor at 37°C and 4°C. The difference between these two values gives the base value of the angiotensin I production.<br>
(b)	Incubation of hTD samples with renin, but without inhibitor at 37°C and 4°C. The difference between these values gives the maximum value of the angiotensin I production.<br><br>
In each sample the base value of the angiotensin I production is subtracted from the angiotensin I production which is determined. The difference between the maximum value and the base value gives the value of the maximum substrate hydrolysis (= 100%) by renin.<br>
The results are given as IC50 values which denote the concentration of the inhibitor at which the enzymatic activity is inhibited by 50%. The IC50 values are determined from<br>
a linear regression curve from a logit-log plot.<br>
The results obtained in this test are compiled in the following Table:<br>

(a)	50.0 g (129.7 mmol) of (3S)-4-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-l-[(lR)"phenyl-ethyl]-l&gt;2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridin-3-ol were dissolved in 700 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, treated portionwise with 41.5 g (about 1040 mmol) of sodium hydride dispersion in refined oil (55-65%) and the reaction mixture was stirred under argon for 1 hour. Then the mixture was treated portionwise with 153.1 g (519 mmol) of (R)-(-)-2,2-dimethyl-4-(hydroxymethyl)-[l,3]dioxolane-p-toluenesulfonate and stirred for two hours. Thereupon, the reaction mixture was poured into 2 liter of ice-water and extracted three times with 750 ml of ether. The combined ether phases were subsequently washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated on a rotary evaporator at a maximum 40°C. The residue which was thereby obtained was chromatographed on silica gel with methylenechloride/ethyl acetate (95/5). There were thus obtained 64.8 g (115 mmol), 88.7%, (3S)-4-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-3-[(4S)-2,2-dimethyl-[l,3]dioxolan-4-ylmethoxy]-l-[(R)-l-phenyl-ethyl]»l,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine as light yellow solid; MS: 500 (M+Hf.<br>

Then, the reaction mixture was again cooled to 5°C, treated slowly with 110 ml of water followed by 44.3 g (282 mmol) of sodium percarbonate. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was stirred at 50°C for 17 hours. After cooling to room temperature the reaction solution was poured into 1.6 liters of water and extracted twice with 600 ml of dichloromethane each time. The combined dichloromethane phases were washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated on a rotary evaporator at a maximum 40°C.
