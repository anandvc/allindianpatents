				<td>A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, A COMMUNICATION UNIT AND A METHOD OF<br>
FREQUENCY RE-PLANNING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a wireless communication system, a<br>
communication unit and a method of frequency re-planning in a<br>
wireless communication system. The invention is applicable to, but<br>
not limited to, use of multiple 'S' curves for frequency planning in<br>
a multiple technology wireless cell-based communication environment.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Wireless communication systems, for example cellular<br>
telephony or private mobile radio communication systems,<br>
typically provide for radio telecommunication links to be<br>
arranged between a plurality of base transceiver stations<br>
(BTSs) and a plurality of subscriber units, often termed<br>
mobile stations (MSs).<br>
In a wireless communication system, each BTS has<br>
associated with it a particular geographical coverage<br>
area (or cell). Primarily, a transmitter power level of<br>
a BTS defines a coverage area where a BTS can maintain<br>
acceptable communications with MSs operating within its<br>
serving cell. In addition, receiver sensitivity<br>
performance of receiving wireless communication units<br>
also affect3 the extent of a given coverage area. In<br>
large cellular communication systems, these cells are<br>
combined and often overlapped to produce an extensive,<br>
wide coverage area.<br>
Wireless communication systems are distinguished over<br>
fixed communication systems, such as the public switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN), principally in that subscriber<br>
units/mobile stations move between coverage areas, where<br>
communications in the different coverage areas are served<br>
by different BTS (and/or different service providers).<br>
In doing so, the MSs encounter varying radio propagation<br>
environments.<br>
In a cellular system, adjacent cells are typically<br>
configured to overlap, to ensure a contiguous signal<br>
coverage area, whilst the MSs move between cells. The<br>
cell overlap region is deliberately designed into the<br>
system plan to ensure that MSs can successfully handover<br>
between communication cells. The frequencies used in<br>
particular cells are generally selected to minimise a<br>
level of radio interference generated on adjacent cells.<br>
A system design based on cells is typically based on an<br>
ideal cell pattern. However, an idealised cell pattern<br>
never occurs in practice, due to the nature of the<br>
terrain and the fact that cell sites and antennae are not<br>
ideally located on a regular grid pattern. The wireless<br>
system designer therefore uses frequency-planning tools<br>
to estimate the radio propagation for each cell and<br>
predict a corresponding coverage area. Based on these<br>
propagation models, the system designer is able to<br>
develop a frequency plan for the system intended to<br>
minimise the expected interference.<br>
Frequency planning is arguably the most challenging and<br>
time consuming task in designing a mobile communication<br>
system. Effective usage of the frequency spectrum, one<br>
of the scarcest resources for any operator, leads to both<br>
better system quality and increased capacity. In this<br>
regard, the frequency plan considers such factors as<br>
antenna heights and location, terrain topology,<br>
transmitted power levels and the anticipated number of<br>
subscriber units.<br>
In the context of frequency planning, recent developments<br>
in simulation tools have provided the opportunity to<br>
'automatically' perform a frequency re-planning (AFP)<br>
operation, based on analysis of measured data and system<br>
parameters such as transmit power, subscriber receiver<br>
sensitivity, etc. Automating a frequency planning<br>
process typically produces better quality frequency plans<br>
and yields a multitude of benefits, such as:<br>
(i) A better quality of service may be achieved in<br>
systems with minimal opportunity for frequency reuse,<br>
particularly in systems with tight frequency reuse;<br>
(ii) A major capital expenditure in infrastructure may<br>
be deferred, as the current system is able to handle more<br>
traffic at a given quality of service; and<br>
(iii) The time for frequency planning is reduced -<br>
enabling system designers enough time to concentrate on<br>
other, more complex enhancements to system quality.<br>
For systems supporting AFP applications, there is a<br>
requirement on active subscriber units to scan as many<br>
frequencies as possible to aid frequency planning. This<br>
information, in the form of measurement reports, is fed<br>
into an AFP application that is able to determine an<br>
optimal frequency plan for the communication system.<br>
A number of techniques exist for allocating frequencies<br>
to cells in a radio system within a frequency planning<br>
operation. Typically, these techniques are based on<br>
maximising the Carrier to Interference ratio (C/I) for<br>
those 'pixels' included in the 'analysis space' of a<br>
frequency planning tool. The major weakness of these<br>
techniques is that they assume a uniform distribution of<br>
subscriber units in a cell. As such the known techniques<br>
do not accurately reflect the actual distribution of C/I<br>
that can be encountered in a cell. A further weakness of<br>
these techniques is that the non-uniform distribution of<br>
communication traffic, where the traffic may include<br>
speech, data, signalling, video, etc., each of which has<br>
different minimum interference requirements, is not<br>
captured in the frequency planning algorithm.<br>
Furthermore, with the advent of packet switched and<br>
adaptive multi-rate technologies, frequency planning<br>
based on a single criterion is no longer an optimal<br>
solution. Typically, frequency planning tools seek to<br>
exceed a minimum C/I in all radio cells. However, radio<br>
carriers will now need to support traffic with<br>
heterogeneous minimum C/I requirements.<br>
Thus, there exists a need in the field of the present<br>
invention to provide a wireless communication system, a<br>
communication unit and method for frequency re-planning;<br>
wherein the aforementioned disadvantages may be<br>
alleviated.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present<br>
invention there is provided a wireless communication<br>
system, as claimed in Claim 1.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a method of frequency re-<br>
planning in a wireless communication system, as claimed<br>
in Claim 14.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a storage medium, as claimed<br>
in Claim 19.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a communication unit, as<br>
claimed in Claim 20.<br>
In summary, the inventive concepts of the present<br>
invention propose a wireless communication system (100),<br>
a method of frequency planning and a communication unit<br>
to generate a frequency plan based on a relationship<br>
between one or more interference metrics and one or more<br>
quality of services for a plurality of communication<br>
types.<br>
Preferably, the one or more interference metrics may<br>
comprise a carrier to interference metric and the one or<br>
more quality of services may comprise frame erasure rate<br>
(FER). The preferred embodiment generates and uses<br>
multiple 'S' curves, where each curve describes a<br>
relationship between, say, C/I and frame erasure rate<br>
(FER) for a given technology, traffic class and/or<br>
context under specific radio conditions. Thus, each 'S'<br>
curve is defined for specific technologies and/or traffic<br>
types and/or contexts.<br>
Once multiple 'S' curves have been generated, they are<br>
applied to a frequency-planning tool. Multiple 'S'<br>
curves can then be assessed against each other, for<br>
example in the context of a penalty matrix, to identify a<br>
specific interference relationship, for example, between<br>
a frequency carrier supporting a first communication<br>
technology and/or traffic type and/or context on a first<br>
cell and a frequency carrier supporting a second<br>
communication technology and/or traffic type and/or<br>
context on a second cell.<br>
Preferably, an overall 'penalty' value is calculated for<br>
one or more radio interference scenarios, i.e. a value<br>
representing the effect of applying a specific frequency<br>
assignment to a cell with specific interference<br>
relationships to a set of neighbouring cells. In this<br>
manner, the inventive concepts facilitate frequency<br>
planning for a non-uniform allocation of penalty values<br>
on different radio carriers, for example within the same<br>
radio cell. This allows different re-use distances to be<br>
achieved for different radio carriers. In so doing, it<br>
is now possible to plan for a different quality of<br>
service on respective, individual radio carriers.<br>
By systematically applying a number of 'S' curves to<br>
identify an interference relationship, a carrier-to-<br>
carrier penalty matrix can also be derived. In this<br>
regard, the frequency planning tool is then able to use<br>
the derived penalty matrix to analyse the impact of, and<br>
interference interrelationship between, different<br>
communication technologies being applied to different<br>
cells or BTSs within the cells. This, in turn, enables<br>
the frequency planning tool to generate an improved<br>
frequency plan for a cellular radio system, particularly<br>
one supporting multiple technologies and/or traffic types<br>
and/or contexts.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring first to FIG. 1, a multi-layer cellular<br>
telephone communication system 100 is shown, in outline,<br>
supporting a Global System for Mobile communication (GSM)<br>
air-interface, in accordance with a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention. The European Telecommunications<br>
Standards Institute (ETSI) has defined the GSM air-<br>
interface. The multi-layer cellular system is shown in a<br>
simplified form, with a limited number of system elements<br>
shown for clarity purposes only.<br>
Generally, the air-interface protocol is administered<br>
from base transceiver sites, within the system<br>
architecture 110, that are geographically spaced apart -<br>
one base site supporting a cell (or, for example, sectors<br>
of a cell).<br>
A plurality of subscriber units 112-115 is shown as<br>
communicating over the selected air-interface 117-120<br>
with a plurality of base transceiver stations (BTS) 122-<br>
132. A limited number of MSs 112-115 andBTSs 122-132<br>
are shown for clarity purposes only. The BTSs 122-132<br>
may be connected to a conventional public-switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN) 134 through base site<br>
controllers (BSCs) 136-140 and mobile switching centres<br>
(MSCs) 142-144. Each BTS 122-132 is principally designed<br>
to serve its primary cell, with each BTS 122-132<br>
containing one or more transceiver units to communicate<br>
156-166 with the rest of the cellular system<br>
infrastructure<br>
Each BSC 136-140 may control one or more BTSs 122-132,<br>
with BSCs 136-140 generally interconnected through MSCs<br>
142-144. Processes within the MSCs are provided to<br>
account for the situation where a MS (112-115) passes<br>
between two BTS serving areas, for example MS 112 moving<br>
from an area covered by BTS 122 to an area covered by BTS<br>
124, where the two BTSs are controlled by different BSCs<br>
(BSC 136 and BSC 138 in this example).<br>
Each MSC 142-144 provides a gateway to the PSTN 134, with<br>
MSCs 142-144 interconnected through an operations and<br>
management centre (OMC) 146 that administers general<br>
control of the cellular telephone communication system<br>
100, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
The various system elements, such as BSCs 136-138 and OMC<br>
146, include control logic 148, 150, 152, with the<br>
various system elements usually having an associated<br>
memory function 154 (shown only in relation to BSC 138<br>
for the sake of clarity). A memory function 153 of the<br>
OMC 146 typically stores historically compiled<br>
operational data, as well as in-call data, control<br>
algorithms and system information such as neighbouring<br>
cell-site lists, for example a list of frequencies to be<br>
scanned by the respective MSs. In operation, an initial<br>
frequency re-use plan is set by an intelligent<br>
optimisation system (IOS) 172 and notified to the OMC<br>
146. The OMC 146 commands the BTSs 122-132 via their<br>
BSCs 136-140 to set their operating frequencies<br>
accordingly.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, an intelligent optimisation system<br>
(IOS) 172 is operably coupled to the OMC 146 and the base<br>
station controllers 136-140. Notably, the IOS 172<br>
comprises an 'S' curve processing/analysing function 175,<br>
which is configured to process/analyse a number of 'S'<br>
curves relating to particular technologies and/or traffic<br>
types and/or contexts and identify an interference<br>
relationship between the technologies and/or traffic<br>
types and/or contexts employed in neighbouring cells.<br>
The processing of multiple yS' curves enables the OS 172<br>
to generate an improved frequency re-use plan in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In alternative embodiments, it is envisaged that the 'S'<br>
curve processing/analysing function 175 may be located<br>
within the OMC 146. Indeed, it is envisaged that in<br>
alternative embodiments, the 'S' curve<br>
processing/analysing function 175 may be operably coupled<br>
to other functions within the wireless communication<br>
system, or even distributed across a number of elements,<br>
if appropriate.<br>
The 'S' curve processing/analysing function 175 is<br>
configured to receive C/I information and related quality<br>
of service metrics, such as frame error rate (FER)<br>
information for each communication cell supported by the<br>
OMC 146. In the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, this 'S' curve information is pre-generated<br>
by, say, an Operator, and. loaded into the 'S' curve<br>
processing/analysing function 175.<br>
In order to derive multiple S-curves, it is envisaged<br>
that a physical layer simulation model may be used by,<br>
say, the Operator. Advantageously, in the context of<br>
frequency planning a cellular system that incorporates a<br>
multitude of radio technologies/ the use of multiple 'S'-<br>
curves can also be used to capture the effect of<br>
discontinuous transmission and frequency hopping. For<br>
example in the case of a frequency hopping wireless<br>
communication technology, the effect of different Mobile<br>
Allocation List lengths on the FER of different<br>
technologies, for a given level of radio interference<br>
(C/I), could be modelled by the simulator. The results<br>
of the simulation may be used to derive corresponding<br>
frequency-hopping S-curves for the different<br>
technologies. Correspondingly, the effect of combining<br>
discontinuous transmission and frequency hopping can be<br>
modelled such that the 'S' curve relates their effect on<br>
the relationship between C/I and FER.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention/ it<br>
is envisaged that the 'S' curve data can be automatically<br>
generated in a real-time manner based on received<br>
measurement reports (MRs), generated by BTSs or MSs<br>
operational within particular cells. Notably, the<br>
information received in this scenario, in order to<br>
classify the 'S' curve data, also preferably indicates<br>
real-time traffic types, technologies used within the<br>
cell, system parameters, etc.<br>
In this regard, the 'S' curve processing/analysing<br>
function 175 within the IOS 172 is operably coupled to a<br>
collection function 176, which is operably coupled to the<br>
BSCs 136-140 for collating cell information. The 'S'<br>
curve processing/analysing function 175 then analyses the<br>
interference relationship between multiple 'S' curves,<br>
when considered in the context of configuring<br>
corresponding cells as neighbouring cells in a wireless<br>
communication system.<br>
Each 'S' curve describes a relationship between one or<br>
more interference metrics, such as C/I, and one or more<br>
quality of service (QoS) metrics such as frame erasure<br>
rate (FER) for, say, a traffic class under specific radio<br>
conditions. Thus, each 'S' curve is defined for specific<br>
traffic types and contexts. In this regard, the 'S'<br>
curve processing/analysing function 175 generates an<br>
interference penalty matrix for each technology and/or<br>
traffic type and/or context. The 'S' curve<br>
processing/analysing function 175 then analyses a number<br>
of these matrices, in the context of neighbouring cells,<br>
to identify an overall interference penalty value. These<br>
aggregated values are preferably generated by combining<br>
matrices, for example in the manner as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 3. Once an overall penalty value has been<br>
generated, it is applied to a frequency-planning tool<br>
174, within the IOS 172.<br>
Thus, multiple 'S' curves can then be assessed against<br>
each other, for example in the context of a penalty<br>
matrix, to determine an anticipated interference<br>
relationship. Preferably, one example could be a<br>
relationship between a frequency carrier supporting a<br>
first communication technology and/or traffic type and/or<br>
context on a first cell and a frequency carrier<br>
supporting a second communication technology and/or<br>
traffic type and/or context on a second cell.<br>
More generally, the 'S' curve processing/analysing<br>
function 175 may be programmed into, say, the IOS 172 in<br>
any suitable manner. For example, new apparatus may be<br>
added to a conventional IOS 172 (or OMC 146)<br>
communication unit. Alternatively existing parts of a<br>
conventional IOS 172 (or OMC 146) communication unit may<br>
be adapted, for example, by reprogramming one or more<br>
processors therein. As such the required adaptation may<br>
be implemented in the form of processor-implementable<br>
instructions stored on a storage medium, such as a floppy<br>
disk, hard disk, programmable read only memory (PROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM) or any combination of these or<br>
other storage media.<br>
Thus, a skilled artisan will appreciate that the<br>
configuration 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely a<br>
representative preferred example of an architecture that<br>
is able to benefit from the inventive concepts described<br>
herein.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, a typical 'S' curve 200 is<br>
illustrated. The S-Curve 200 illustrated in FIG. 2<br>
indicates the C/I ratio versus FER for a GSM full rate<br>
speech signal relating to a radio environment<br>
characterised by a TU3 fading profile with no frequency<br>
hopping. The 'S' curve processing/analysing function 175<br>
of FIG. 1 preferably contains (receives and/or generates)<br>
a number of 'S' curves in the manner shown in FIG. 2, for<br>
the various technologies and/or traffic types and/or<br>
contexts.<br>
When applying the inventive concepts to frequency<br>
planning for a radio system, it is envisaged that •<br>
different S-curves may be generated for different radio<br>
cells and radio carriers within those cells, depending on<br>
contextual parameters. For example in a GSM radio<br>
system, contextual parameters might include the level of<br>
discontinuous transmission in a neighbouring cell. In<br>
the case of frequency planning for a radio network<br>
employing frequency-hopping algorithms, contextual<br>
parameters might include the number of frequencies being<br>
hopped over and the probability of frequency clashes.<br>
Other contextual parameters may include, for example, a<br>
Rayleigh fading profile in the radio cell. A skilled<br>
artisan would appreciate that many other contextual<br>
parameters could be used within the 'S' curve concept.<br>
In order to consider the interference relationship of the<br>
two (or more) neighbouring wireless communication cells,<br>
where each cell may support different technologies and/or<br>
traffic types and/or contexts, a number of penalty<br>
matrices are generated by the 'S' curve<br>
processing/analysing function 175. The matrices are<br>
based on the corresponding 'S' curve, such as the 'S'<br>
curve illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, two penalty matrices 310, 330<br>
and an aggregate penalty matrix 350 are shown. The<br>
concept of a penalty matrix having a number of penalty<br>
values is described in the published co-pending patent<br>
application - GB 2382503 A - having the same Applicant as<br>
the present invention, and is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. As illustrated in FIG. 3, each penalty matrix<br>
310, 330 indicates the relative impact, defined as a<br>
penalty value (or performance metric) relating to the<br>
radio interference between respective pairs of cells 'A'<br>
to 'C' when they employ the same frequencies. Each of<br>
the penalty values relates to a particular 'S' curve for<br>
a given technology and/or traffic type and/or context.<br>
In each penalty matrix, cells 'A', 'B' and 'C' are<br>
illustrated as columns 312, 314, 316 and rows 318, 320,<br>
322 for a first technology and/or traffic type and/or<br>
context. Notably, in accordance with the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the penalty matrix<br>
is generated for each technology and/or traffic type<br>
and/or context based on 'S' curve data. For example, let<br>
us assume a technology-based scenario where a first<br>
penalty matrix 310 is generated for GSM voice<br>
communication and a second penalty matrix 330 is<br>
generated for packet data communication in a general<br>
packet radio system (GPRS).<br>
Let us first consider the first penalty matrix 310. The<br>
'S' curve processing/analysing function 175 (of FIG. 1)<br>
is able to determine, for a given technology and/or<br>
traffic type and/or context, the relative impact on cell<br>
'A', assuming that cell 'C' is allocated the same channel<br>
frequency as cell 'A'. In FIG.3, this interference<br>
impact (penalty) value is '12'. In this case, the<br>
penalty value may indicate that 12% of measurement<br>
reports received from cell 'A' would have a received<br>
signal strength lower than the neighbouring cell 'C' by<br>
some value, say 'x' dBs.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the 'S' curve processing/analysing<br>
function 175 generates a penalty matrix for each<br>
technology and/or traffic type and/or context. Let us<br>
then consider the second penalty matrix 330, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3. Cells 'A', 'B' and 'C' are<br>
illustrated as columns 332, 334, 336 and rows 338, 340,<br>
342 for the second technology, which is GPRS. Notably,<br>
in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the penalty matrix is generated for<br>
GPRS technology based on corresponding GPRS 'S' curve<br>
data.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the two penalty matrices are combined,<br>
for example using a summation approach (although it is<br>
envisaged that other aggregate techniques could be used)<br>
to produce an aggregate penalty matrix 350 for the<br>
scenario where the two technologies are used in<br>
neighbouring cells. Thus, the aggregate penalty matrix<br>
350 is the matrix that is used to optimise the frequency<br>
plan within the frequency planning tool 174.<br>
In summary, the 'S' curve processing/analysing function<br>
175 is able to utilise a number of 'S' curves for a<br>
particular technology and/or traffic type and/or context<br>
to identify and generate a penalty matrix for that<br>
technology and/or traffic type and/or context, where each<br>
'S' curve produces a penalty value. A number,, preferably<br>
two, of penalty matrices can then be combined to produce<br>
an aggregate penalty matrix 350. Advantageously, the<br>
aggregate penalty matrix 350 can be generated from<br>
dissimilar technologies and/or traffic types and/or<br>
contexts. The 'S' curve processing/analysing function<br>
175 is then able to calculate an overall 'penalty' value,<br>
i.e. a value representing the interference effect of<br>
applying a specific frequency assignment to a cell having<br>
specific interference relationships, to a set of<br>
neighbouring cells.<br>
Thus, by systematically applying the multiple 'S' curve<br>
concept to an interference relationship, irrespective of<br>
the interfering technologies/ a carrier-to-carrier,<br>
aggregate penalty matrix 350 can be derived by the 'S'<br>
curve processing/analysing function 175. In this regard,<br>
the frequency planning tool 174 is then able to use the<br>
multiple derived penalty matrices for each technology or<br>
traffic type or context to minimise the impact of, and<br>
interference interrelationship between, different<br>
communication technologies being applied to different<br>
cells or BTS 122-132 within the cells. This, in turn,<br>
enables the frequency planning tool 174 to generate an<br>
improved frequency plan for a cellular radio system.<br>
By using multiple 'S' curves in this manner, it is<br>
therefore possible to capture the effect of interference<br>
on a specific traffic type, such as voice, data short<br>
message services (SMS), video, etc., across multiple<br>
technologies, for example, cells supporting general<br>
packet radio system (GPRS) communications, adaptive<br>
multi-rate codec (AMR) communications, EDGE<br>
communications, GSM full rate speech communications, etc.<br>
In order to illustrate the benefits provided by the<br>
aforementioned inventive concepts, let us consider a few<br>
practical examples.<br>
Example 1;<br>
At a specific C/I, the probability of an erased frame is<br>
different for the different technologies and/or traffic<br>
types and/or contexts. Let us therefore consider a radio<br>
carrier cell with 100% traffic occupancy of which 50% is<br>
contributed by Adaptive Multi-rate (AMR) Enhanced Full<br>
Rate (EFR) speech and 50% by standard GSM full rate<br>
speech. In the case of the GSM full rate speech<br>
communication, a FER of close to 100% might be expected<br>
for C/I of 
higher C/I might be required to achieve this FER<br>
performance.<br>
Thus, in order to capture these requirements, different<br>
'S' curves pertaining to the different technologies<br>
and/or traffic types and/or contexts are employed in the<br>
calculation of respective 'penalty' values and the<br>
subsequent generation of the penalty matrices. Thus,<br>
penalties are defined for interference relationships<br>
between radio carriers. Therefore, when a specific<br>
carrier frequency supports traffic from more than one<br>
traffic type, a number of 'S' curves are generated for<br>
each context.<br>
In this example, if there are eight timeslots available<br>
for both types of traffic, then a penalty value can be<br>
calculated as follows:<br><br>
Where:<br>
x_Occupany_on_Server is a value associated with<br>
the occupancy of a particular traffic type on a specific<br>
carrier, e.g. AMR (EFR) or full rate speech;<br>
Occupancy_on_interferer is a value associated<br>
with the traffic occupancy on the interferer carrier; and<br>
Intf(x) is the mean FER value for a particular<br>
speech codec such as the AMR (EFR) or full rate GSM<br>
speech.<br>
The penalty calculation is based on the potential<br>
interference resulting from a particular frequency<br>
assignment and a context or type of traffic or<br>
communication technology such as GPRS, AMR, EDGE, GSM<br>
full rate speech, etc.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Again, let us consider a radio carrier with 100%<br>
occupancy, of which 50% is contributed by AMR EFR<br>
communication and 50% by GSM full rate speech. If there<br>
are eight timeslots available for both types of traffic,<br>
then a penalty value may be calculated as follows:<br>
Penalty - 8 * (Intf_(AMR) * AMR_Occupancy_on_Server<br>
*Occupancy_on_Interferer + Intf_full rate speech *<br>
full_rate_Occupancy_on_Server *<br>
Occupancy_on_Interferer)<br>
Where the following definitions apply:<br>
Intf_AMR: a mean FER for AMR speech frames, which<br>
is based on the potential interference resulting from a<br>
particular frequency assignment. {N.b. it is envisaged<br>
that this could be calculated by applying the specific<br>
AMR 'S' curve to the distribution of server-interferer<br>
signal level differences for a given server-interferer<br>
relationship.}<br>
Intf_full_rate: a mean FER for full rate speech<br>
frames, which is based on the full rate speech 'S' curve;<br>
AMR_Occupancy_on_Server: the occupancy of AMR<br>
traffic on a specific carrier;<br>
full_rate_Occupancy_on_Server: speech traffic<br>
occupancy on a server carrier; and<br>
Occupancy_on_Interferer: the traffic occupancy on<br>
the interferer carrier.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a flowchart 400 illustrates an<br>
overview of the preferred frequency planning process.<br>
The flowchart commences in step 405 with the IOS<br>
collecting a number of measurement reports (MRs). These<br>
MRs are preferably entered into a database located<br>
within, or operably coupled to, the IOS in step 410. For<br>
each radio carrier in each cell, the IOS derives a<br>
distribution of measured server cell-to-neighbour cell<br>
received signal strength indication (RSSI) differences,<br>
as shown in step 415.<br>
In accordance with an enhanced embodiment of the present<br>
invention, for each measured sample of server-neighbour<br>
RSSI difference, the IOS 172 computes a (quality index)<br>
penalty value using the appropriate 'S' curves, and,<br>
having calculated a number of penalty values, generates<br>
one or more penalty matrix from the 'S' curves, as shown<br>
in step 420. For each server-neighbour pairing,<br>
particularly when the pairings contain dissimilar<br>
technologies, traffic types and/or contexts, the IOS 172<br>
then preferably performs a weighted summation of the<br>
penalty values (effectively from the multiple 'S'<br>
curves), as shown in step 435.<br>
Based on the weighted summation of (quality index)<br>
penalty values for each server-neighbour pairing, the IOS<br>
derives an overall aggregate penalty matrix as shown in<br>
step 440. Following the generation of the overall<br>
aggregate penalty matrix in step 440, the frequency<br>
planning tool is able to run a frequency planning<br>
algorithm based on such an improved derived penalty<br>
matrix that, for example, relates to two or more<br>
technologies and/or traffic types and/or contexts, as<br>
shown in step 445.<br>
Thus, in this manner, an IOS 172 is able to determine<br>
rapidly an optimal set of frequencies to be allocated to<br>
cells in a multiple technology environment.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been described with reference to a<br>
relationship between carrier-to-interference and FER on a<br>
given cell for a particular technology, traffic type<br>
and/or context, it is within the contemplation of the<br>
invention that one or more interference metrics (such as<br>
C/I) could be used, in conjunction with one or more<br>
quality of services (such as bit error rate (BER), frame<br>
error rate, received signal strength indication (RSSI),<br>
etc., as would be appreciated by a skilled artisan.<br>
It is also within the contemplation of the present<br>
invention that the inventive concepts are not limited to<br>
minimising interference between voice and data<br>
technologies. Indeed, it is envisaged that the inventive<br>
concepts can be applied to any wireless cellular<br>
communication system. Notably, the inventive concepts<br>
can be applied to any wireless communication system that<br>
employs multiple radio frequencies, and is therefore<br>
particularly suited to frequency planning in a GSM<br>
cellular system.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been described with regard to a cellular telephony<br>
communication system, such as the global system for<br>
mobile communications (GSM), supporting a number of<br>
traffic types. It is envisaged that the invention is<br>
equally applicable to other wireless communication<br>
systems, such as a universal mobile telecommunication<br>
system (UMTS), any code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
or time division multiple access (TDMA) system,, or an<br>
integrated digitally enhanced network (iDEN)TM as supplied<br>
by MotorolaTM. It is also within the contemplation of the<br>
invention that alternative radio communication<br>
architectures, such as private or public mobile radio<br>
communication systems could benefit from the inventive<br>
concepts described herein.<br>
It is also envisaged that: the inventive concepts herein<br>
described can be equally applied in commercial frequency<br>
planning tools such as NetplanTM, PlanetTM, CellOptTM and<br>
OdysseyTM.<br>
It will be understood that the communication system,<br>
communication unit (such as an IOS or adapted OMC), and<br>
improved method for frequency re-planning, as described<br>
above, provides at least one or more of the following<br>
advantages that could not be reliably obtained using<br>
existing frequency planning methods:<br>
(i) Supports frequency planning for a radio<br>
system with multiple traffic types;<br>
(ii) Facilitates frequency planning where there<br>
is a non-uniform allocation of penalty values on<br>
different radio carriers, for example within the same<br>
radio cell. This allows different re-use distances to be<br>
achieved for different radio carriers. In so doing, it<br>
is now possible to plan for a different quality of<br>
service on respective, individual radio carriers;<br>
(iii) A multiple 'S' curve processing algorithm<br>
can be readily incorporated into a penalty generation<br>
system employing measurement reports (MRs). This means<br>
that the penalty values generated for individual radio<br>
carriers are representative of an actual subscriber's<br>
perceived interference; and<br>
(iv) The inventive concepts allow for the<br>
automatic frequency planning of a radio system supporting<br>
multiple technologies such as AMR, GSM, GPRS, EDGE and<br>
traffic types, such as voice, data, video or contexts,<br>
such as a level of discontinuous transmission in a<br>
neighbouring cell, a Rayleigh fading profile for a cell,<br>
etc.<br>
Whilst the specific and preferred implementations of the<br>
embodiments of the present invention are described above,<br>
it is clear that a skilled artisan could readily apply<br>
variations and modifications of such inventive concepts.<br>
Thus, a wireless communication system, a communication<br>
unit, and a method for frequency re-planning have been<br>
provided wherein the aforementioned disadvantages<br>
associated with prior art arrangements have been<br>
substantially alleviated.<br>
