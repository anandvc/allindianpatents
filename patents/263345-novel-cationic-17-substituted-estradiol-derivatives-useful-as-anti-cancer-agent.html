				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel cationic 17α substituted estradiol derivative useful as anti cancer agent. Particularly, the present invention relates to a novel series of cationic lipid-based, derivatives of estradiol, which is the natural ligand for estrogen receptors. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel cationic 17a substituted estradiol derivative of formula A<br>
(Formula Removed) wherein:<br>
each of R1 and R2 is independently hydrogen or a lipophilic moiety containing at least two carbon atoms and is selected from 2-22 carbon containing alkyl, mono-, di- and tri-unsaturated alkenyl (C2-C22) provided both R1 and R2 are not hydrogen; R3 is independently hydrogen or C1-C5, straight or branched chain alkyl group; n is an integer varies from 2 to 7; and X is selected from chlorine, bromine or iodine atom.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel cationic 17α substituted estradiol derivative of formula A. The invention provides information about highly selective anticancer activities of these molecules in estrogen responsive cell lines. The area of medical science that is likely to benefit most from the present invention is targeted cancer therapy.<br>
Background and Prior art of the invention<br>
Chemotherapy and radiation therapies are two current clinical modalities commonly used for the treatment of cancer. Mostly these techniques are effective to block the growth of tumor. However, there is often a recurrence of the disease, possibly because of incomplete cell killing or cells acquiring drug resistance. There is also an added disadvantage of non-specific accumulation and killing of normal cells leading to irreparable cytotoxicity in humans. This is mainly because cytotoxic drugs generally do not posses targeting property. The need of the hour is to develop newer drugs which will<br>
be targeted to cancers of certain specific origin by utilizing the cancer specific molecular targets, such as, utilizing breast cancer specific proteins, e.g., estrogen receptor, for targeting and killing breast cancer cells.<br>
Estrogen receptor (ER) is a nuclear hormone receptor residing in mostly gynecological cells mainly, breast, uterus, and ovary cells that bear both cancerous and non-cancerous phenotype. The ER is also found to express avidly in vascular endothelial cells wherein it regulates the production of nitric oxide synthases and hence directly help in the positive production and regulation of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) (3). The VEGF is one of the well-known angiogenic factors for the sustained growth of tumor mass.<br>
ER has two subtypes a and ß. This receptor, a ligand activated transcription factor upon activation translocates itself into the nucleus. Classically, as a homodimer it binds to specific DNA sequences called Estrogen response elements (ERE) and positively or negatively regulates transcription of target genes. In breast cancer cells ER regulates cancer up-regulating genes such as BCI-2, BRCA-1, and VEGF through ERE-promoter activation of respective genes (1). Therefore, ER is a positive regulator of cancer causing effects and hence ER serves as a very useful target for treating cancer through designing novel ER-targeted therapeutics.<br>
Recently, we have shown that the estrogen the natural ligand to ER, when attached to stealth, cationic liposomal system, mediates anti-cancer gene delivery to breast cancer cells in a target specific manner (2). Estradiol, the endogenous ligand for ER is chemically modified to modulate the ER function which is of high importance for containing variety of diseases including breast cancer and osteoporosis. During the primary stage, i.e., estrogen responsive phase the breast cancer can be successfully contained through chemotherapeutic management. A variety of structural modification and several proactive chemical moieties are included in 17-beta estradiol to develop new generation drugs for the treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis. There are several examples that can be cited towards this effect: 17α-alkynyl conjugate of estradiol that links between an enediyne system to that of steroidal moiety, possesses comparable ER affinity to estradiol. The compound tentatively acts as anti-cancer, targeted, prodrug through generation of diyl radicals produced by the cycloaromatization<br>
of enediyne systems which are known classes of antitumor agents (4). 17-alkylestradiols with alkyl group size is widely varied for their carbon chains from methyl to dodecyl, are also synthesized and tested to find excellent inhibitory effect against steroid sulfatase, the enzyme that is responsible for conversion of sulfated estrogens into free estrogens in normal and cancer cells(5). 17-α azido-alkynyl group containing estradiol is found to possess ER agonistic property (6). C-16 position of estradiol is also utilized for synthesizing ER targeting antagonist/agonists. The C-16 position has been introduced with a carbon chain length and amide bond to induce anti-estrogenic property (7). Synthetic analogues of 2-methoxy estradiol (2-ME2), the endogenous mammalian metabolite of natural hormone estradiol, are also extensively synthesized and studied to find elevated antimitotic activity compared to what is naturally possessed by the metabolite 2-ME2 itself (8-12). An aniline mustard conjugate at 7-α position of estradiol is developed that possess genotoxicity to only ER positive cells through formation of covalent DNA adducts in those cells (13).<br>
The present invention relates to development of a novel series of estrogen receptor binding chemical compounds that contain 17a-estradiol and cationic twin chain lipid moieties. The delivery induced anti-cancer properties of this new class of cationic estradiol described herein is remarkably cell tropic for only gynecological cancer cells, especially, breast cancer cells and also cervical cancer cell. The cellular toxicity of this class of molecules is minimal to null in case of non-gynecological cancer cells and in cells of non-cancerous lineage. This indicates that the cellular toxicity in respective cells is probably mediated through estrogen receptors which are highly implicated in gynecological cancer phenotypes. Thus, the present class of cationic estradiol derivative is likely to find future applications in anticancer therapy for cancers that are implicated with estrogen receptors. Moreover, the present class of compound has cationic moiety in their structure and that the cationic group with optimized length of carbon-chain may have aggregative property as that of cationic liposomes, which may help the molecule to bind with DNA (a poly-anionic biologically important macromolecule). So, the present class of molecule may act as a DNA delivery agent to the cancer cells implicated with ER for the purpose of treating cancers and the references may be made to Carolyn M. Klinge.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to process for the synthesis of a series of novel cationic estradiol derivatives and evaluation of their estrogen receptor-mediated anticancer activity in various human breast and cervical cancer cells. The novel cationic lipid based derivatives containing 17ß-estradiol moiety acts as anticancer drugs that target specifically act upon cancer cells implicated directly/indirectly with estrogen<br>
receptors. The area of science that is likely to be benefited most from the present invention is targeted cancer therapy.<br>
The distinctive novel structural features common to the cationic estradiol derivatives disclosed in the present invention include: (1) The presence of hydrophobic groups which are directly linked to the positively charged nitrogen atom and (2) the presence of estrogen receptor-binding 17ß-estradiol group. It is believed that these unique structural features contribute significantly directly/indirectly to estrogen receptor-mediated anticancer activities of the novel cationic estradiol derivatives disclosed herein.<br>
According to the practice of the present invention, "cationic" means the positive charge either on quaternized nitrogen or on a protonated nitrogen atom. The cationic characters of the present lipid-based derivatives may contribute to the enhanced, selective interaction of the lipid-based derivatives with cell constituents such as plasma membrane glycoproteins specifically in breast and cervical cancer cells. Although the reason of specificity arising from this angle is yet not deciphered but such enhanced interaction between the cationic lipid-based derivatives and cell membrane constituents may also play a key role in successfully transporting the intended therapeutic moiety that remains conjugated to the molecule, into the cancer cells.<br>
The cationic estradiol derivative of the present invention has certain common structural and functional groups. As such, the said cationic estradiol derivative may be represented by the following generic formula (A):<br>
(Formula Removed) wherein<br>
each of R1 and R2 is independently hydrogen or a lipophilic moiety containing at least<br>
two carbon atoms and is optionally selected from 2-22 carbon containing alkyl, mono-,<br>
di- and tri-unsaturated alkenyl (C2-C22) provided both R1 and R2 are not hydrogen;<br>
R3 is independently hydrogen or alkyl (C1-C5, straight or branched);<br>
n is an integer between 2 and 7<br>
and X is selected from chlorine, bromine or iodine atom.<br>
The cationic estradiol derivatives of the present invention have a lipophilic domain that may or may not facilitate the formation of lipid complexes or aggregates in aqueous solutions. However, the molecule because of the presence of estradiol moiety remains stably soluble in serum associated in vivo mimicking conditions. This is in conformity to the fact that estrogen, a predominantly hydrophobic molecule, freely moves out of ovary and swims through vascular and lymphatic bodies to intended organs such as breast and uterus by remaining as naturally 'pocketing-in' condition in blood serum proteins.<br>
Exemplary lipophilic R1 and R2 groups include (1) saturated C2-C22 alkyl groups and (2) unsaturated C2-C22 alkenyl groups containing 1, 2, or 3 double bonds. In one preferred embodiment of the presently disclosed cationic lipids R1 = R2 = n-octyl, R3 is a methyl, n= 3, and X" is a chloride ion. Accordingly, the compound no. 1 is a representative example of the presently described novel cationic estradiol derivatives:<br>

The in vitro cytotoxicities of the derivative A to various cancer and non-cancer cells across different molar concentrations (0.5 µM-50 µM) were performed. The cancer cells were chosen from various origins, such as breast cancer cells MCF-7 (primary carcinoma), T47D (ductal carcinoma), MDA-MB-468 (secondary, metastatic); cervical cancer cell Hela; lung cancer cell A549 (metastatic). The non cancer cells that were chosen for this study were CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells) and COS-1 (Monkey kidney cells). In one set of experiments, the cells were treated at different concentrations of derivative A for 4h, washed and kept in serum media for 6 days to observe cellular toxicity using MTT assay (Figures 1, 2, 4, 6A and 6B), except for one cell line where the assay was done after 4 days (Figure 3). In another set of experiment, the cells were treated continuously for 48h in presence of serum media and cellular toxicities were assayed promptly (Figure 5). As is evident from Figures 1-3, the breast cancer cells showed less than 50% viability for an initial exposure of only 4h of 10 uM derivative A. As is evident from Figure 4, upon only 4h exposure, 10 µM derivative A did not elicit toxicity to A549, Hela, CHO and COS-1 cells. This shows that the breast<br>
cancer cells which are directly/indirectly implicated with estrogen receptors were susceptible to undergo cell killing when derivative A was treated upon. MCF-7 and T47D are natural ER expressing breast cancer cells whereas MDA-MB-468 is a natural ER knockout breast cancer cell. But MDA-MB breast cancer cells upon estrogen exposure showed very interesting biochemical properties such as enhanced gene transfection (14-15), thereby showing that even though the ER expression is nil but the biochemical pathway that may utilize extraneous estrogen is still active in this cell line. So, estrogen or its derivatives such as derivative A does show some unexplained, biochemical phenomenon in certain breast cancer cells that do not express natural ER any more. So, the Figures 1-4 showed that even at low time of exposure of derivative A the breast cancer cells were the worst affected cells which are directly/indirectly implicated with ER.<br>
In the second set of experiments, upon continuous exposure of 10uM of derivative A for 48h, not only the breast cancer cells but also cervical cancer cell Hela showed very low viability (Figure 5). Even in the continuous treatment of 10µM derivative A for 48h, cancer cell A549 and non-cancer cell CHO showed no sign of toxicity. This set of results evidently pointed out that at continuous exposure of derivative A the cancer cells that are of gynecological origins i.e., breast, cervix etc. showed 50% or much less viability at even a miniscule concentration of 10 µM. Estrogen is a natural ligand which has direct/indirect role for normal growth of gynecological organs. Upon binding with ER estrogen can regulate several of the cancer up-regulating genes in breast and other gynecological cancers (1). So, it is quite natural that any derivative of estradiol may show targeted delivery into gynecological organs which are directly/indirectly implicated with ER. Our estradiol derivatives probably due to some unexplainable genetic regulation up-regulates anticancer activities in gynecological cancer cells alone, leaving non-gynecological cancer cells and non-cancer cells untouched. Applications<br>
The present invention can be exploited for treating gynecological cancers such as breast, cervical cancer etc. The lipid derivatives of this invention can also be used to deliver polyanions, polypeptides or nucleopolymers into cells via estrogen receptors<br>
only to cancer cells for the purpose of targeted healing. The cationic estrogen derivative disclosed herein can be used to deliver an expression vector into a cell for therapeutic use. The expression vectors can be used in gene therapy protocols to deliver a therapeutically useful protein to a cell or for delivering nucleic acids encoding therapeutically useful protein molecules. The invention i.e. cationic estradiol derivative can be formulated with anionic, zwitter-ionic and lipophilic therapeutic agents including adjuvant anticancer agents such as doxorubicin, a lipophilic compound, to obtain complexes comprising the invention derivatives and a therapeutic agent(s). In particular, the presently disclosed cationic estradiol derivatives hold potential for future exploitation in targeted, anticancer therapeutic modality to combat cancer.<br>
Cells and Cell Culture. CHO (Chinese hamster ovary), COS-1 (African Green monkey kidney cells) HeLa (Human cervical carcinoma), MCF-7 (Human breast primary adenocarcinoma), T47D (Human breast ductal carcinoma), MDA-MB-468 (Human breast secondary adenocarcinoma), and A-549 (Human lung carcinoma) cell lines were procured from the National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Pune, India and were mycoplasma free. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) [for MDA MB-468 cells, RPMI 1640 medium] with 10% Fetal Bovine serum, 50 µg/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin and 20 µg/mL kanamycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cultures of 85-90% confluency were used for all of the experiments. The cells were trypsinized, counted, subcultured in 96-well plates for viability studies. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight before they were used for experiments.<br>
Preparation of Samples and sample treatment. The cationic estradiol derivatives were dissolved in cell culture grade DMSO to get a primary stock. The stock is progressively diluted with DMSO to get secondary stocks. Finally, the working concentrations of the derivatives were obtained by adding the secondary DMSO stocks in 10% Fetal Bovine serum containing cell culture medium. The amount of DMSO in working solutions never exceeded more than 0.2% with respect to the serum containing culture medium. The 100 µl of cell culture solutions containing respective concentrations of cationic estradiol derivatives are given to cells pre-washed with Phosphate buffer<br>
saline. The cells were either kept in exposure with respective concentrations of estradiol derivatives for 4h or 48h. For 4h treatment, the cells were washed and kept in presence of cell culture media without the working concentrations of estradiol derivatives for 4 or 6 days, as the case may be. The cells were then assayed for viability using MTT. For 48h continuous treatment, the cells were washed and promptly assayed for viability using MTT.<br>

 Percent Cell Viabilities.<br>
Cytotoxicities of the cationic estradiol derivative 1 were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay. The assay was performed in 96-well plates. Depending on the duration of experiment 8000-15000 cells were plated in 96 well plates and kept overnight. After say, 12 h when the cells were adhered to the bottom of plates the solutions containing respective concentrations of derivative 1 were added to triplicate wells. The treatment of derivative 1 to the cells was for either 4h or 48h as mentioned earlier.
