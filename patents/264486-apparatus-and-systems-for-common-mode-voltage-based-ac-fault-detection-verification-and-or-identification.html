				<td>APPARATUS AND SYSTEMS FOR COMMON MODE VOLTAGE-<br>
BASED AC FAULT DETECTION, VERIFICATION AND/OR<br>
IDENTIFICATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to protection of electric and<br>
hybrid vehicle power systems, and more particularly relates to detecting an<br>
alternating current fault (ACF), and/or verifying an ACF and/or identifying a<br>
source of an ACF.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Electric and hybrid vehicles typically include an alternating current<br>
(AC) electric motor which is driven by a direct current (DC) power source,<br>
such as a storage battery. Motor windings of the AC electric motor can be<br>
coupled to inverter module(s) which perform a rapid switching function to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power which drives the AC electric motor.<br>
[0003] Many electric and hybrid vehicles implement an isolated high<br>
voltage DC bus which couples the inverter module(s) to the DC power source.<br>
Other modules, such as devices, components or circuits, can also be coupled to<br>
the high voltage DC bus. In some situations one of more of these modules can<br>
operate improperly and cause an electrical AC fault (ACF) to occur along the<br>
high voltage DC bus which causes high voltage spikes that can potentially<br>
damage other modules coupled to the high voltage DC bus.<br>
[0004] One way to address ACFs is to implement a Ground Fault<br>
Interrupter (GFI) (sometimes also referred to as a residual current device<br>
(RCD), residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit<br>
interrupter (GFCI)), that observes the respective currents at a ground terminal<br>
and a supply terminal, and disconnects a circuit coupled between these<br><br>
terminals when the differential current flow between these terminals is not<br>
balanced (i.e., zero (0)) since this signifies current leakage. Such ground fault<br>
detection circuits typically implement current transformers to detect ACF<br>
currents in the ground path. However, transformer-based ground fault<br>
detectors are expensive and bulky.<br>
[0005] Another way to address ACFs is to implement ground fault<br>
detection using software algorithms. However, such software algorithms have<br>
long detection times.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a fast, simple, low cost and<br>
reliable ACF detection and/or verification circuit. It would also be desirable<br>
to provide a fast, simple, low cost and reliable ACF identification circuit<br>
which can aid in diagnosing the source of an ACF so that the source of the<br>
ACF can be turned off or disconnected from the high voltage DC bus when an<br>
ACF occurs. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the<br>
present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Embodiments of the present invention relate to apparatus for AC<br>
fault (ACF) detection, apparatus for AC fault (ACF) detection and<br>
verification, and apparatus for identification of a module which is the cause of<br>
an AC fault (ACF). In one embodiment, one or more of these apparatus can<br>
be combined to provide a fast, simple, low cost and reliable ACF detection,<br>
verification and/or identification circuit.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a hybrid/electric power train system is<br>
provided that includes a bus, one or more modules coupled to the bus, and a<br>
circuit designed to detect an AC fault (ACF) caused by one of the modules.<br>
Each module has a fundamental operating frequency (fCM)associated<br>
therewith. The circuit comprises a common mode voltage detector circuit<br><br>
designed to generate a common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) by removing a<br>
differential mode voltage component from a DC input signal from the bus.<br>
The circuit comprises a magnitude detector coupled to the common mode<br>
voltage detector circuit and designed to determine whether a measured<br>
magnitude of the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) is greater than or<br>
equal to a threshold voltage (VTH). The magnitude detector also generates an<br>
AC fault (ACF) detection signal when the measured magnitude of the<br>
common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) is greater than or equal to the<br>
threshold voltage (VTH)-<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] As used herein, the word "exemplary" means "serving as an<br>
example, instance, or illustration." The following detailed description is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the<br>
application and uses of the invention. Any embodiment described herein as<br>
"exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous<br>
over other embodiments. All of the embodiments described in this Detailed<br>
Description are exemplary embodiments provided to enable persons skilled in<br>
the art to make or use the invention and not to limit the scope of the invention<br>
which is defined by the claims. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound<br>
by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field,<br>
background, brief summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0020] Before describing in detail embodiments that are in accordance<br>
with the present invention, it should be observed that the embodiments reside<br>
primarily in combinations of method steps and apparatus components related<br>
to AC fault (ACF) detection, verification and/or identification. It will be<br>
appreciated that embodiments of the invention described herein can be<br>
implemented using hardware, software or a combination thereof. The AC<br>
fault (ACF) detection, verification and/or identification circuits described<br>
herein may comprise various components, modules, circuits and other logic<br><br>
which can be implemented using a combination of analog and/or digital<br>
circuits, discrete or integrated analog or digital electronic circuits or<br>
combinations thereof. In some implementations, the ACF detection,<br>
verification and/or identification circuits described herein can be implemented<br>
using one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), one or<br>
more microprocessors, and/or one or more digital signal processor (DSP)<br>
based circuits when implementing part or all of the ACF detection, verification<br>
and/or identification logic in such circuits. It will be appreciated that<br>
embodiments of the invention described herein may be comprised of one or<br>
more conventional processors and unique stored program instructions that<br>
control the one or more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain<br>
non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions for AC fault (ACF)<br>
detection, verification and/or identification, as described herein. As such, these<br>
functions may be interpreted as steps of a method for AC fault (ACF)<br>
detection, verification and/or identification. Alternatively, some or all<br>
functions could be implemented by a state machine that has no stored program<br>
instructions, or in one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs),<br>
in which each function or some combinations of certain of the functions are<br>
implemented as custom logic. Of course, a combination of the two approaches<br>
could be used. Thus, methods and means for these functions have been<br>
described herein. Further, it is expected that one of ordinary skill,<br>
notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated<br>
by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic<br>
considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein<br>
will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs<br>
and ICs with minimal experimentation.<br>
[0021] Overview<br>
[0022] Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and<br>
apparatus for AC fault (ACF) detection, methods and apparatus for AC fault<br>
(ACF) detection and verification, and methods and apparatus for identification<br>
of a module which is the cause of an AC fault (ACF). In one embodiment,<br><br>
one or more of these methods and apparatus can be combined to provide a<br>
fast, simple, low cost and reliable ACF detection, verification and/or<br>
identification circuit.<br>
[0023] The disclosed methods and apparatus can be implemented in<br>
operating environments where ACFs are caused by or as a result of modules<br>
implemented along a high-voltage bus in hybrid/electric vehicle (HEV). In the<br>
exemplary implementations which will now be described, the fault detection,<br>
verification and/or identification techniques and technologies will be described<br>
as applied to a hybrid/electric vehicle (HEV). However, it will be appreciated<br>
by those skilled in the art that the same or similar fault detection, verification<br>
and/or identification techniques and technologies can be applied in the context<br>
of other AC systems which are susceptible to damage caused by an AC fault<br>
(ACF) event. In this regard, any of the concepts disclosed here can be applied<br>
generally to "vehicles," and as used herein, the term "vehicle" broadly refers<br>
to a non-living transport mechanism having an AC motor or device that can<br>
cause an AC fault to ground (chassis) potential. Examples of such vehicles<br>
include automobiles such as buses, cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, vans,<br>
vehicles that do not travel on land such as mechanical water vehicles including<br>
watercraft, hovercraft, sailcraft, boats and ships, mechanical under water<br>
vehicles including submarines, mechanical air vehicles including aircraft and<br>
spacecraft, mechanical rail vehicles such as trains, trams and trolleys, etc. In<br>
addition, the term "vehicle" is not limited by any specific propulsion<br>
technology such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Rather, vehicles also include<br>
hybrid vehicles, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, and vehicles<br>
which operate using various other alternative fuels.<br>
[0024] Exemplary Implementations<br>
[0025] FIG. 1A illustrates a simplified block diagram of a power<br>
distribution system architecture 10 implemented in a hybrid/electric vehicle<br>
(HEV) according to one exemplary implementation of the present invention.<br>
[0026] The system 10 comprises a DC power source 20 (e.g., a battery or<br>
batteries), an inverter module 30, a high voltage DC bus 40 having two DC<br><br>
bus terminals (+HV, -HV) 42, 44, an AC motor 50, a number of<br>
modules/devices/circuits 60-80 coupled to the high voltage DC bus 40, a fault<br>
detection, verification and/or identification (FDVI) circuit or module 100<br>
designed to detect and verify an AC fault (ACF) and to identify a particular<br>
one of the modules/devices/circuits 30, 60-80 which is the source or cause of<br>
the ACF, a processor 92, a display 94 and a speaker 96.<br>
[0027] The high-voltage bus 40 is a conductor used to couple the DC<br>
power source 20, inverter module 30 and modules 60-80. The high-voltage<br>
bus 40 can be made of a conductive material, such as copper or aluminum. In<br>
these implementations, the high-voltage DC bus 40 is isolated from the vehicle<br>
chassis or "ground."<br>
[0028] The AC motor 50 can be a 'wound motor" with a stator wound into<br>
definite poles.<br>
[0029] The inverter module 30 is coupled to the AC motor 50 using<br>
another bus. The inverter module 30 is a circuit or other device which<br>
converts direct current (DC) power to alternating current (AC) power, usually<br>
with an increase in voltage. Among other things, an inverter module<br>
oftentimes includes a DC input filter know as an electromagnetic interference<br>
(EMI) filter 32 which includes expensive filter capacitors (referred to as "Y<br>
capacitors") connected between chassis (ground) and the high voltage DC bus<br>
40. In this implementation, the two DC bus terminals +HV 42,-HV 44 are<br>
referenced to ground (e.g., the vehicle chassis), and two Y-capacitors (not<br>
illustrated) are coupled together (at ground) between the two terminals +HV<br>
42,-HV 44. The DC high voltage bus 40, 42 is isolated from chassis ground<br>
with a DC resistance usually greater than 1.0 megaohm. The voltage on the<br>
DC bus can range anywhere from +/- 50 V DC to +/- several hundred volts<br>
DC. Usually the DC high voltage bus is referenced at 1/2 the amplitude<br>
relative to chassis ground. For example, terminals of the a 100 V DC bus can<br>
be biased at +50 V relative to chassis ground and - 50 V relative to chassis<br>
ground. The two DC bus terminals +HV 42,-HV 44 are coupled to the<br>
inverter 30. Such capacitors are not only expensive, but are relatively difficult<br><br>
to replace in the event they fail. An ACF event may cause a high-AC current<br>
to be applied to the two Y-capacitors in excess of 100 times the normal<br>
operating current, to which the two Y-capacitors will fail.<br>
[0030] As used herein the term "module" refers to a device, a circuit, an<br>
electrical component, and/or a software based component for performing a<br>
task. The modules/devices/circuits 30, 60-80 each have an identifiable,<br>
fundamental operating switching frequency (fCM) associated therewith, that<br>
switches power from the DC bus.	Although only four<br>
modules/devices/circuits 30, 60-80 are illustrated for purposes of discussion, it<br>
will be appreciated that in other implementations fewer or more<br>
modules/devices/circuits 60-80 can be coupled to the terminals (+HV 42,-HV<br>
44) of the high-voltage bus 40. The modules/devices/circuits 60-80 can be, for<br>
example, a converter (e.g., a DC-to-DC converter module), an inverter (e.g., a<br>
Power Inverter Module (PIM) such as a quad-PIM) or modules and/or sub-<br>
modules thereof which have an identifiable switching frequency (fCM), an<br>
engine cooling fan module, etc. Each of the modules/devices/circuits 60-80<br>
has a fundamental operating frequency (fCM) associated therewith, and can act<br>
as a source or cause of an ACF along the high voltage DC bus 40. As used<br>
herein, the term "AC fault (ACF)" refers to the switched (AC) output of an<br>
inverter which inadvertently becomes partially or totally shorted to ground<br>
(chassis). An ACF is typically observed or detected by a series of ACF events<br>
or a particular number of consecutive ACF-type voltage spikes.<br>
[0031] FIG. IB illustrates the high voltage DC input signal 115 from the<br>
bus. The high voltage DC input signal 115 includes a common mode noise on<br>
a high-voltage (HV) bus relative to chassis ground. As illustrated in FIG. IB,<br>
the high voltage DC input signal 115 has two components one on the +HV bus<br>
42 relative to chassis ground and another on the -HV bus 44 relative to chassis<br>
ground, and the common mode voltage has the same amplitude and phase<br>
relative to chassis ground. When amplitude of the ripple portion of the high<br>
voltage DC input signal 115 becomes high enough (e.g., when there is a direct<br><br>
short AC fault (ACF) event), components, such as the Y-capacitors can be<br>
damaged.<br>
[0032] As will be described in detail below, the FDVI module 100 can<br>
detect an ACF event or event(s), and/or verify that ACF event(s) signal an<br>
actual ACF, and/or identify one of the modules which is the cause or source of<br>
a detected ACF or verified ACF. While FIG. 1A illustrates the FDVI module<br>
100 as an independent module that is implemented outside of the inverter<br>
module 30 and the modules 60-70, in other implementations, the FDVI<br>
module 100 can be implemented within or as part of the inverter module 30,<br>
or within or as part of one or more of the modules 60-70.<br>
[0033] FIG. 2A illustrates a simplified block diagram of a fault detection<br>
circuit (FDC) 102 according to one exemplary implementation of the present<br>
invention. The FDC 102 will be described below with reference to an<br>
implementation where the FDC 100 is utilized in a battery or fuel-cell<br>
operated HEV which includes a hybrid/electric power train system 10 such as<br>
that illustrated in FIG. 1A, however, the FDC 102 can be implemented in a<br>
variety of other applications or implementations to detect an ACF. In this<br>
exemplary implementation, the FDC 102 is coupled to the high voltage DC<br>
bus 40 by a high voltage DC input circuit which generates a high-voltage DC<br>
input signal 115 between the DC bus terminals 42, 44.<br>
[0034] The FDC 102 comprises a common mode voltage detector circuit<br>
120 and a level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140. The common mode<br>
voltage detector/measurement circuit 120 designed to receive the high-voltage<br>
DC input signal 115, and to generate a scaled, common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 by removing a differential mode DC voltage component<br>
from the high-voltage DC input signal 115. The scaled common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 indicates a scaled value of the common mode AC<br>
voltage measured across the high voltage DC bus 40. For example, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2C, when the high-voltage DC input signal 115 passes<br>
through the common mode voltage detector circuit 120, the differential mode<br>
DC component is eliminated and the resultant scaled, common mode AC<br><br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 is biased at approximately zero volts (and, in this<br>
example ranges 123 between 13.6 volts and -13.6 volts)<br>
[0035] The level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 is coupled to the<br>
common mode voltage detector circuit 120. The level/amplitude/magnitude<br>
detector 140 is designed to measure a level of the scaled, common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125, and compare the measured magnitude/amplitude of<br>
the scaled, common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 to a fault detection<br>
threshold voltage (VTH).<br>
[0036] FIG. 2B is a graph which illustrates a measured level of the voltage<br>
on +HV bus 42 relative to chassis ground. Reference numeral 122 illustrates<br>
the voltage waveform during a normal operation of the HV DC bus 40,<br>
whereas reference numeral 124 illustrates the voltage waveform when an ACF<br>
event is occurring on the HV DC bus 40.<br>
[0037] FIG. 2C is a graph which illustrates a measured level of the<br>
common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 when the differential mode<br>
voltage is removed. In this particular example, during normal operation of<br>
the HV DC bus 40, the scaled, common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 127 is<br>
DC offset at approximately 0.0 volts DC (i.e., the normal ripple voltage 127 is<br>
5 volts peak-to-peak (5VPP) (between arrows 126) and biased at 0.0 volts. By<br>
contrast, during an exemplary ACF event 128 when ACF voltages are present,<br>
the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is approximately 27.6 volts<br>
peak-to-peak (Vpp) (between arrows 123) and centered at 0.0 volts.<br>
[0038] Thus, when the measured magnitude/amplitude of the scaled,<br>
common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the<br>
fault detection threshold voltage (VTH) (e.g., when the<br>
level/amplitude/magnitude of the scaled, common mode AC voltage signal<br>
(VCM) 125 crosses the fault detection threshold voltage (VTH)), the<br>
level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 generates and outputs a signal 145<br>
(e.g., a logical one) which indicates that a ACF event has been detected. By<br>
contrast, when the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 determines that the<br>
magnitude/amplitude of the scaled, common mode AC voltage signal (VCM)<br><br>
125 is less than the fault detection threshold voltage (VTH), the<br>
level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 does not generate an output and does<br>
not indicate that an ACF event has been detected.<br>
[0039] In some implementations it is desirable to provide fault verification<br>
to help ensure that a perceived ACF event is actually caused by an ACF, and is<br>
not a false indicator due, for instance, to noise or some other intermittent<br>
disturbance in the system.<br>
[0040] FIG. 2D illustrates a simplified block diagram of a fault detection<br>
and verification circuit (FDVC) 104 according to one exemplary<br>
implementation of the present invention. As above, the FDVC 104 will be<br>
described below with reference to an implementation where the FDVC 104 is<br>
utilized in a battery or fuel-cell operated HEV which includes a hybrid/electric<br>
power train system 10 such as that illustrated in FIG. 1 A, however, the FDVC<br>
104 can be implemented in a variety of other applications or implementations<br>
to detect and verify an ACF. As above, in this exemplary implementation, the<br>
FDVC 104 is coupled to the high voltage DC bus 40 by a high voltage DC<br>
input circuit which generates a high-voltage DC input signal 115 between the<br>
DC bus terminals 42, 44.<br>
[0041] The FDVC 104 comprises a common mode voltage detector circuit<br>
120, a level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140, and a fault verification unit<br>
150. The common mode voltage detector circuit 120, and the<br>
level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 operate as described above with<br>
reference to FIGS. 2A and 2B.<br>
[0042] When the measured magnitude/amplitude of the scaled, common<br>
mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the fault<br>
detection threshold voltage (VTH) (e.g., when the level/amplitude/magnitude of<br>
the scaled, common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 crosses the fault<br>
detection threshold voltage (VTH)), the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140<br>
generates and outputs a counter enable signal 145 (e.g., a logical one) which it<br>
provides to a cycle counter 152 which is implemented in the fault verification<br>
unit 150. By contrast, when the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140<br><br>
determines that the magnitude/amplitude of the scaled, common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 is less than the fault detection threshold voltage<br>
(VTH), the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 does not generate an output<br>
(or maintains an output signal (e.g., a logical zero)) which it provides to the<br>
cycle counter 152 in which case the cycle counter 152 is not enabled.<br>
[0043] The cycle counter 152 is enabled by the counter enable signal 145<br>
whenever an ACF event is detected by the level/amplitude/magnitude detector<br>
140 (e.g., signal 145 is high). The cycle counter 152 increments a register (not<br>
illustrated) in the cycle counter 152 if, and only if, the cycle counter 152 is<br>
enabled and an ACF voltage spike is present in the scaled, common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 while the cycle counter 152 is enabled by the counter<br>
enable signal 145.<br>
[0044] The cycle counter 152 maintains a count which indicates a number<br>
of consecutive periods that the magnitude/amplitude of the scaled, common<br>
mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the fault<br>
detection threshold voltage (VTH) while the cycle counter 152 is enabled.<br>
When the count maintained by the cycle counter 152 is greater than or equal a<br>
particular or predetermined threshold number of consecutive cycles (e.g., 3<br>
consecutive times) or "count," then the fault verification unit 150 generates a<br>
fault verification signal 155 to indicate that the ACF has been verified (i.e.,<br>
verifies that the number of ACF voltage spikes is sufficient to signify a true<br>
ACF condition). When the count is greater than or equal to the particular<br>
number, this signifies that the number of consecutive periods during which an<br>
ACF-type pulse or "ACF voltage spike' is received is greater than some<br>
threshold number, and therefore it can be assumed that an actual AC fault<br>
(ACF) exists since this indicates that the scaled, common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 includes a consecutive string of ACF-type pulses or ACF<br>
voltage spikes rather than an intermittent or random ACF-type pulse or ACF<br>
voltage spike.<br>
[0045] The cycle counter 152 resets whenever the counter enable signal<br>
145 is not received during consecutive periods (as determined from the scaled,<br><br>
common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125). When the cycle counter 152<br>
resets before reaching a particular or predetermined number of consecutive<br>
cycles or "count," then it can be assumed that the ACF-type pulse is an<br>
intermittent or false fault indicator (e.g., in a situation where a single ACF-<br>
type pulse occurs that is not associated with an actual ACF, but is instead<br>
attributable to noise). In this situation, the fault verification unit 150 does not<br>
output a fault verification signal 155.<br>
[0046] In some cases, multiple modules can be provided in a system (as<br>
illustrated for example in FIG. 1A), and each of these modules can act as a<br>
cause or a source of an ACF event. In such cases, it is desirable to provide a<br>
mechanism for identifying the particular module which is the source or cause<br>
of the ACF. In some implementations, once the ACF has been detected and/or<br>
verified, the source of the ACF can be identified so that a control system can<br>
take an appropriate action given the nature of the ACF. In some<br>
embodiments, the methods and apparatus can aid in diagnosing the source of<br>
an ACF so that the source of the ACF can be turned off or disconnected from a<br>
high voltage DC bus.<br>
[0047] FIG. 2E illustrates a simplified block diagram of a fault detection,<br>
verification and identification circuit (FDVIC) 100 according to one<br>
exemplary implementation of the present invention. The FDVIC 100 will be<br>
described below with reference to an implementation where the FDVIC 100 is<br>
utilized in a battery or fuel-cell operated HEV which includes a hybrid/electric<br>
power train system 10 such as that illustrated in FIG. 1A, however, the FDVIC<br>
100 can be implemented in a variety of other applications or implementations<br>
to detect and/or verify an ACF, and/or to identify a module, device or circuit<br>
which is a source of such an ACF. In this exemplary implementation, the<br>
FDVIC 100 is coupled to the high voltage DC bus 40 by a high voltage DC<br>
input circuit which generates a high-voltage DC input signal 115 between the<br>
DC bus terminals 42, 44.<br>
[0048] The FDVIC 100 comprises a common mode voltage detector<br>
circuit 120, a level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140, a fault verification unit<br><br>
150; a period/frequency detector 160, a module identification unit 170, and a<br>
fault indicator unit 180. The common mode voltage detector circuit 120 and<br>
the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 are described above.<br>
[0049] When the measured magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the fault detection<br>
threshold voltage (VTH) (e.g., when the level/amplitude/magnitude of the<br>
common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 crosses the fault detection<br>
threshold voltage (VTH)), the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140<br>
generates and outputs a counter enable signal 145 (e.g., a logical one) which it<br>
provides to a cycle counter 152 which is implemented in the fault verification<br>
unit 150. The cycle counter 152 indicates that a ACF event has been detected.<br>
[0050] By contrast, when the level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140<br>
determines that the magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 is less than the fault detection threshold voltage (VTH), the<br>
level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140 does not generate an output (or<br>
maintains an output signal (e.g., a logical zero) which it provides) to the cycle<br>
counter 152 in which case the cycle counter 152 is not enabled.<br>
[0051] The fault verification unit 150 is coupled to the<br>
level/amplitude/magnitude detector 140.<br>
[0052] The cycle counter 152 is enabled by the counter enable signal 145<br>
whenever an ACF event is detected by the level/amplitude/magnitude detector<br>
140 (e.g., signal 145 is high). The cycle counter 152 increments a register (not<br>
illustrated) in the cycle counter 152 if, and only if, the cycle counter 152 is<br>
enabled and an ACF voltage spike is present in the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal 125 while the cycle counter 152 is enabled by the counter enable signal<br>
145.<br>
[0053] The cycle counter 152 maintains a count which indicates a number<br>
of consecutive periods that the magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC<br>
voltage signal 125 is greater than or equal to the fault detection threshold<br>
voltage (VTH) while the cycle counter 152 is enabled. When the count<br>
maintained by the cycle counter 152 is greater than or equal a particular or<br><br>
predetermined threshold number of consecutive cycles (e.g., 3 consecutive<br>
times) or "count," then the fault verification unit 150 generates a fault<br>
verification signal 155 to indicate that the ACF has been verified (i.e., verifies<br>
that the number of ACF voltage spikes is sufficient to signify a true ACF<br>
condition). When the count is greater than or equal to the particular number,<br>
this signifies that the number of consecutive periods during which an ACF-<br>
type pulse or "ACF voltage spike" is received is greater than some threshold<br>
number, and therefore it can be assumed that an actual AC fault (ACF) exists<br>
since this indicates that the common mode AC voltage signal 125 includes a<br>
consecutive string of ACF-type pulses or ACF voltage spikes rather than an<br>
intermittent or random ACF-type pulse or ACF voltage spike.<br>
[0054] The cycle counter 152 resets whenever the counter enable signal<br>
145 is not received during consecutive periods (as determined from the<br>
common mode AC voltage signal 125). When the cycle counter 152 resets<br>
before reaching a particular or predetermined number of consecutive cycles or<br>
"count," then it can be assumed that the ACF-type pulse is an intermittent or<br>
false fault indicator (e.g., in a situation where a single ACF-type pulse occurs<br>
that is not associated with an actual ACT, but is instead attributable to noise).<br>
In this situation, the fault verification unit 150 does not output a fault<br>
verification signal 155.<br>
[0055] In this implementation, the fundamental frequency (fCM) of the<br>
module causing the ACF can be determined. The frequency detector 160 is<br>
also coupled to the common mode AC voltage signal 125. The frequency<br>
detector 160 is designed to determine a frequency (f) of the common mode AC<br>
voltage signal 125, and to generate a frequency (f) identification signal 165<br>
which indicates the center frequency (fc) of the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal 125.<br>
[0056] The module identification unit 170 is coupled to the frequency<br>
detector 160. The module identification unit 170 is designed to receive the<br>
fundamental operating frequency (ECM) identification signal 165, and<br>
determine the module that is the source of the AC fault (ACF) based on the<br><br>
fundamental operating frequency (fCM) For example, in one implementation,<br>
the module identification unit 170 can determine the module that is the source<br>
of the AC fault (ACF) by performing a lookup in a lookup table which<br>
associates each module with a corresponding operating frequency of that<br>
module. After determining which module is the source of the AC fault (ACF),<br>
the module identification unit 170 can generate a module identification signal<br>
175 which identifies the module that is the source of the AC fault (ACF).<br>
[0057] The fault indicator unit 180 is coupled to the fault verification unit<br>
150 and the module identification unit 170. When the fault indicator unit 180<br>
receives both the fault verification signal 155 and the module identification<br>
signal 175, the fault indicator unit 180 generates information 185 which<br>
identifies the module which is causing the AC fault (ACF). In one<br>
implementation, the information 185 comprises a fault indicator signal 185.<br>
The fault indicator signal 185 may include, for example, an output fault code<br>
with a corresponding module identifier (ID) which identifies the module<br>
which is causing the AC fault (ACF). In some implementations, the processor<br>
92, upon processing the fault indicator signal 185, can generate a signal which<br>
either stops operation (e.g., turns off) of the module causing the AC fault<br>
(ACF) or disconnects the module causing the AC fault (ACF) from the high<br>
voltage DC bus 40.<br>
[0058] In one implementation, the processor 92, upon processing the fault<br>
indicator signal 185, can send a signal to the display 94 which causes the<br>
display 94 to visually display the module identifier (ID) which identifies the<br>
module which is causing the AC fault (ACF).<br>
[0059] In another implementation, the processor 92, upon processing the<br>
fault indicator signal 185, can send a signal to the an audio unit which includes<br>
speaker 96 thereby causing the speaker 96 to provide an audible indicator<br>
which indicates the AC fault (ACF) and/or identifies the module which is<br>
causing the AC fault (ACF).<br>
[0060]	FIG. 3A illustrates a method 200 for detecting, verifying and<br>
identifying an AC fault (ACF) according to one exemplary implementation of<br><br>
the present invention. The method 200 will be described below with reference<br>
to an implementation where the method 200 is utilized to detect an ACF,<br>
verify an ACF and/or identify a module causing an ACF in a battery or fuel-<br>
cell operated HEV which includes a hybrid/electric powertrain system 10 such<br>
as that illustrated in FIG. 1A; however, the method 200 can be applied in a<br>
variety of other applications or implementations to detect an ACF, verify an<br>
ACF and/or identify a module, device or circuit which is a source or cause of<br>
an ACF.<br>
[0061] At step 205 a counter 205 and/or other calibration parameters are<br>
initialized. At step 210, a high-voltage DC input signal 115 is received, and at<br>
step 220, the differential (DC) voltage component is removed from the high-<br>
voltage DC input signal 115 to generate a scaled, common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 which indicates a scaled value of a common mode AC<br>
voltage that is measured across the high voltage DC bus 40.<br>
[0062] At step 230, a magnitude of the common mode AC voltage signal<br>
(VCM) 125 is determined at least once during each particular period, and at<br>
step 240, it is determined whether the magnitude of the common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to a fault detection threshold<br>
voltage (VTH)-<br>
[0063] When the magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 is less than the fault detection threshold voltage (VTH), the<br>
method 200 proceeds to step 242 where the cycle counter 152 is reset, and the<br>
method 200 then loops back to step 210. When the magnitude/amplitude of<br>
the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the<br>
fault detection threshold voltage (VTH), the method 200 proceeds to step 244<br>
where a cycle counter 152 (not illustrated), which counts a number of<br>
consecutive particular periods during which the cycle counter 152 input signal<br>
is received, is incremented.<br>
[0064] Method 200 then proceeds to step 246, where it is determined<br>
whether a count maintained by the cycle counter 152, which indicates a<br>
number of consecutive periods that the magnitude/amplitude of the common<br><br>
mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the fault<br>
detection threshold voltage (VTH), is greater than or equal to is greater than or<br>
equal to a particular threshold number (e.g., 3).<br>
[0065] When it is determined at step 246 that the count maintained by the<br>
cycle counter 152 is less than the particular threshold number (e.g., 3), the<br>
method 200 loops back to step 210, to continue monitoring for additional ACF<br>
voltage spikes. Notably, if another spike is not detected at step 240 before<br>
reaching a particular count, then the counter resets since the number of<br>
consecutive particular periods during which the counter input signal is<br>
received is less than a threshold number, and it can therefore be assumed that<br>
the prior ACF-type pulses were intermittent or false fault indicators.<br>
[0066] When it is determined at step 246 that the count maintained by the<br>
cycle counter 152 is greater than or equal to the particular threshold number<br>
(e.g., 3), the method 200 proceeds to step 248, where a fault verification signal<br>
155 is generated. When the number of consecutive particular periods during<br>
which an ACF-type pulse is received is greater than the particular threshold<br>
number, detection of an ACF is verified by generating a fault verification<br>
signal. In short, it can be assumed that an actual AC fault (ACF) exists (as<br>
opposed to false indicator, for instance, in a situation where a single pulse<br>
occurs that is not associated with an actual ACF), when the count exceeds the<br>
particular threshold number (e.g., 3). Stated differently, if the number of<br>
consecutive particular periods during which the cycle counter 152 input signal<br>
is received is greater than or equal to the threshold number, there is a good<br>
chance that an actual AC fault (ACF) exists since this indicates that the<br>
common mode AC voltage signal 125 includes a continuous number of ACF-<br>
type pulses rather than an intermittent or random ACF-type pulse.<br>
[0067] Steps 250, 260 and 270 are optional (as indicated by dotted-line<br>
boxes) and can be implemented when module identification is performed.<br>
When steps 250 and 260 are performed, at step 250, a frequency (f) of the<br>
common mode AC voltage signal 125 is determined and a frequency (f)<br>
identification signal 165, which indicates the center frequency (fc) of the<br><br>
common mode AC voltage signal 125. is generated. Then, based on the<br>
frequency (f) identification signal 165, at step 260 the method 200 determines<br>
which module is the source of the AC fault (ACF). For example, in one<br>
implementation, the module that is the source of the AC fault (ACF) can be<br>
determined by using the center frequency (fc) of the common mode AC<br>
voltage signal 125 to perform a lookup in a lookup table which associates each<br>
module with a corresponding operating switching frequency of that module.<br>
[0068] Once the ACF has been verified (step 248) and the module which<br>
is the source or cause of the ACF has been identified (step 260), the method<br>
can proceed to step 270, where information 185 is generated which identifies<br>
the module that is the source or cause of the AC fault (ACF). In one<br>
implementation, the information 185 comprises a fault indicator signal 185<br>
which can include, for example, an output fault code with a corresponding<br>
module identifier (ID) which identifies the module which is causing the AC<br>
fault (ACF).<br>
[0069] Steps 280, 290 and 295 are optional (as indicated by based-line<br>
boxes). The method 200 can optionally perform one or more of steps 280,<br>
290, and 295, and in this regard, each of steps 290 and 295 are optional (as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3 where step 280 can be performed in combination with<br>
either of steps 290, 295). In other implementations, two or more of steps 280,<br>
290, and 295 can be performed in series and/or in parallel with each other<br>
(e.g., step 280, then step 290; step 280, then step 295; step 280, step 290, then<br>
step 295; step 280, step 290, then step 295; step 290, then step 295 or vice-<br>
versa, etc.).<br>
[0070] When the method 200 proceeds to optional step 280, operation of<br>
the module causing the ACF can be stopped (e.g., turned off or disconnected<br>
from the high voltage DC bus 40). At optional step 290, a module identifier<br>
(ID) which identifies the module which is causing the AC fault (ACF) can be<br>
visually displayed on a user interface. At optional step 295, an audible<br>
indicator cab be generated which indicates the AC fault (ACF) condition<br>
and/or identifies the module which is causing the AC fault (ACF).<br><br>
[0071]	FIG. 4 illustrates a method 300 for detecting, verifying and<br>
identifying an AC fault (ACF) according to another exemplary<br>
implementation of the present invention. As above, method 300 can be<br>
applied in a variety of applications or implementations to detect an ACF,<br>
verify an ACF and/or identify a module, device or circuit which is a source of<br>
an ACF.<br>
[0072] At step 305 a counter and/or other calibration parameters are<br>
initialized. A high-voltage DC input signal 115 is received, and at step 320, a<br>
common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is measured by removing the<br>
differential (DC) voltage component from the high-voltage DC input signal<br>
115. This results in a scaled, common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125<br>
which is scaled to a level suitable for processing by electronic circuits.<br>
[0073] At step 330, a magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC<br>
voltage signal (VCM) 125 is determined, and at step 340, it is determined<br>
whether the magnitude of the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is<br>
greater than or equal to a fault detection threshold voltage (VTH)-<br>
[0074] When the magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 is less than the fault detection threshold voltage (VTH), the<br>
cycle counter 152 resets, and the method 300 loops back to step 320.<br>
[0075] When the magnitude/amplitude of the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal (VCM) 125 is greater than or equal to the fault detection threshold<br>
voltage (VTH), the method 300 proceeds to steps 350-376, where module<br>
identification is performed. At step 350, a common mode frequency (fCM) of<br>
the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 is determined. At step 362,<br>
364, 366 a series of checks are performed to identify a module which in the<br>
source or cause of the ACF. For example, at step 362, it is determined<br>
whether an absolute value of the difference between the common mode<br>
frequency (fCM) of the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 and a first<br>
threshold frequency (fTH1) is less than a first frequency differential (Af1). If<br>
the absolute value of the difference between the common mode frequency<br>
(fCM) of the common mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 and the first<br><br>
threshold frequency (fTH1) is less than the first frequency differential (Af1),<br>
then method 300 proceeds to step 472 where a first module (Set Module ID =<br>
1) is identified as being the source or cause of the ACF. If the absolute value<br>
of the difference between the common mode frequency (fcm) of the common<br>
mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 and the first threshold frequency (fTH1) is<br>
greater than or equal to the first frequency differential (Af1), then method 300<br>
proceeds to step 364 where it is determined whether an absolute value of the<br>
difference between the common mode frequency (fcm) and a second threshold<br>
frequency (fTH2) is less than a second frequency differential (Δf2). If the<br>
absolute value of the difference between the common mode frequency (fCM)<br>
and the second threshold frequency (fTH2) is less than the second frequency<br>
differential (Δf2), then method 300 proceeds to step 374 where a second<br>
module (Set Module ID = 2) is identified as being the source or cause of the<br>
ACF. If the absolute value of the difference between the common mode<br>
frequency (fCM) and the second threshold frequency (fTH2) is greater than or<br>
equal to the second frequency differential (Δf2), then method 300 proceeds to<br>
step 366 where it is determined whether an absolute value of the difference<br>
between the common mode frequency (fCM) and a third threshold frequency<br>
(fTH3) is less than a third frequency differential (Δf3).<br>
[0076] If the absolute value of the difference between the common mode<br>
frequency (fCM) and the third threshold frequency (fTH3) is less than the third<br>
frequency differential (Δf3), then method 300 proceeds to step 376 where a<br>
third module (Set Module ID = 3) is identified as being the source or cause of<br>
the ACF. If the absolute value of the difference between the common mode<br>
frequency (fCM) and the third threshold frequency (fTH3) is greater than or<br>
equal to the third frequency differential (Δf3), then method 300 loops back to<br>
step 320. Although FIG. 3 illustrates three check steps 362, 364, 366 being<br>
performed (i.e., when there are only three modules present that are potential<br>
ACF sources), it will be appreciated that any number of checks can be<br>
performed depending on the number of potential modules to be identified.<br><br>
[0077] After identifying a module that is causing the ACF, the method 300<br>
proceeds to step 380, where a fault counter (Nfault) is incremented. The fault<br>
counter (Nfault) counts a number of consecutive particular periods during which<br>
an ACF event is detected.<br>
[0078] Method 300 then proceeds to step 385, where fault verification is<br>
performed. At step 385, it is determined whether a count maintained by the<br>
fault counter (Nfault), which indicates a number of consecutive ACF events<br>
detected, is greater than or equal to is greater than or equal to a particular<br>
threshold number (NTH) (e.g., 3). When the number of consecutive particular<br>
periods during which an ACF-type pulse is received (Nfault) is greater than the<br>
particular threshold number (NTH), detection of an ACF is verified. An actual<br>
AC fault (ACF) exists when the count (Nfault) exceeds the particular threshold<br>
number (NTH) (e.g., 3) since this means that the common mode AC voltage<br>
signal 125 includes a continuous number of ACF-type pulses rather than an<br>
intermittent or random ACF-type pulse. Counting a number of ACF events<br>
reduces the likelihood of a false indicator, for instance, in a situation where a<br>
single pulse occurs that is not associated with an actual ACF.<br>
[0079] When it is determined at step 385 that the count maintained by the<br>
fault counter (Nfault) is less than the particular threshold number (NTH) (e.g., 3),<br>
the method 300 loops back to step 320, to continue monitoring the common<br>
mode AC voltage signal (VCM) 125 for additional ACF voltage spikes.<br>
Notably, if another spike is not detected at step 340 before reaching a<br>
particular count, then the counter resets since the number of consecutive<br>
particular periods during which the counter input signal is received is less than<br>
a threshold number (NTH) (e.g., 3), and it can therefore be assumed that the<br>
prior ACF-type pulses were intermittent or false fault indicators.<br>
[0080] When it is determined at step 385 that the count maintained by the<br>
fault counter (Nfault) is greater than the particular threshold number (NTH) (e.g.,<br>
3), the ACF has been verified and the module which is the source or cause of<br>
the ACF has been identified. The method 300 can then proceed to step 390.<br>
At step 390, operation of the module causing the ACF can be stopped (e.g., the<br><br>
module can turned off or disconnected from the high voltage DC bus 40), a<br>
module identifier (ID) can be generated which identifies the module which is<br>
