The parent application no.l09/MAS/94 (184081) relates and describe an internal combustion engine of the piston and cylinder type.<br>
The present invention relates to a spherical rotary intake valve for use in rotary valve internal combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine of the piston and cylinder type and more particularly to an improved spherical rotary valve assembly for use with a rotary valve internal combustion engine for the introduction of the fuel/air mixture to the cylinder and the evacuation rot exhaust-gases.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
In an internal combustion engine of the piston and cylinder type, it is necessary to charge the cylinder with a fuel/air mixture for the combustion cycle and to vent or evacuate the exhaust gases at the exhaust cycle of each cylinder of the engine. In the conventional piston and cylinder type engines, these events occur thousands of times per minute per cylinder. In the conventional internal combustion engine, the rotation of a cam shaft causes a spring-loaded valve to open to enable the fuel and air mixture to flow from the carburetor to the cylinder and combustion chamber during the induction stroke. This cam shaft closes this intake valve during the compression and combustion stroke of the cylinder and the same cam shaft opens another spring-loaded valve, the exhaust valve, in order to evacuate the cylinder after compression and combustion have<br><br>
occurred.  These exhaust gases exit the cylinder and   enter the exhaust manifold.<br>
The hardware associated with the efficient operation of conventional internal combustion engines having spring-loaded valves includes such items as springs/ cotters/ guides/ rocker sha fts and valves themselves which are usually positioned in the cylinder head such that they normally operate in a substantially vertical position with their opening discending into the cylinder for the introduction or venting or evacuation of gases.<br>
As the revolution of the engine increase/ the valves open and close more frequently and the timing and tolerances become critical in order to prevent the inadvertent contact of the piston with an open valve which can cause serious engine damage. With respect to the aforementioned hardware and operation/ it is normal practice for each cylinder to have one exhaust valve and one intake valve with the associated hardware mentioned heretofore; however/ many internal combustion engines have now progressed to multiple valve systems/ each having the associated hardware and multiple cam shafts.<br>
In the standard internal combustion engine/ the cam shaft is rotated by the crankshaft by means of a timing belt or chain. The operation of this cam shaft and the associated valves operated by the cam shaft presents the opportunity to decrease engine efficiency through friction associated with the operation of the various elements.<br><br>
Applicant has developed a rotary valve assembly for use with internal combustion engines; U.S. Patent 4,944,261; U.S. Patent 4,953,527; U.S. Patent 4,989,558 and U.S. Patent 4,976,232. Applicant's spherical rotary valve assembly el inn. nates much of the hardware associated with the conventional and standard poppet valve assembly used in conventional automobiles. The advantages of Applicant' s spherical rotary valves have been set forth in the prior cited United States patents.<br>
Not only do the spherical rotary valves of Applicant reduce the number of parts required for the operation of an internal combustion engine/ but Applicant' s spherical rotary valves increase efficiency and decrease emissions.<br>
The present application is directed towards an improved spherical rotary valve for use with Applicant' s assembly which allows the intake valve to be fed with a fuel/air mixture from both sides of the intake valve in order to improve the breathing of the engine and the charging of the cylinder with the fuel/air mixture; and permits the exhaust valve to be evacuated from both sides of the valve to improve the evacuation of the spent mixture and to simultaneously decrease the operating temperature of the exhaust rotary valve to further decrease emissions. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide for a novel and uniquely improved spherical rotary valve for use wi th<br><br>
a rotary valve assembly for an internal combustion engine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a novel ' and uniquely improved spherical rotary valve wh ich permits the intake valve to be fed with a fuel and air mixture simultaneously from both sides of the valve.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a novel and uniquely improved spherical rotary valve for use with a rotary valve assembly for an internal combustion engine in which the exhaust valve is evacuated from both sides of the valve to improve the evacuation of spent gases from the cylinder and to maintain the temperature of the exhaust valve at a lower temperature.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide for a novel and uniquely improved spherical rotary valve for use with a rotary valve assembly for internal combustion engines in which the weight of the improved rotary valves is decreased,<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide for a novel and uniquely improved spherical rotary valve for use with a rotary valve assembly for internal combustion engines in which the internal passageways of the spherical rotary valve improve the introduction of the fuel/air mixture to the cylinder and improve the evacuation of the spent gases from the cylinder.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An improved spherical rotary valve for use with an internal  combustion engine with improved sealing means which<br><br>
permits the introduction of fuel/air mixture into the cylinder from both lateral sides of the intake spherical rotary valve and permits the evacuation of the spent exhaust gases from the cylinder from both sides of the exhaust spherical rotary valve, the exhaust spherical rotary valve having the capability of providing additional impetus to the flow of exhaust gases to the exhaust manifold.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spherical rotary intake valve for use in rotary valve internal combustion engines comprising a drum body of spherical section defined by two parallel planes of a sphere disposed symmetrically about the center of said sphere thereby defining a spherical periphery and planar sidewalls, said rotary intake valve formed with a shaft receiving aperture centrally, radially disposed therethrough, said drum body formed with a doughnut-shaped cavity in each of said sidewalls thereof, about said shaft receiving aperture, said doughnut cavities segregated by a partition wall, said doughnut-shaped cavities in communication with a passageway formed in said spherical periphery of said drum body.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Considering Figures 1, 2 and 3/ there is illustrated a side view, end view, and perspective view of an intake spherical drum which is the subject of the present invention- Intake spherical drum 10 is defined by a spherical section formed by two parallel sidewalls 14 and 16 disposed about the spherical center/ thereby defining a spherical circumferential end wall 12. Sidewalls 14 and 16, respectively have depending inwardly therefrom/ circular doughnut-shaped cavities 18 and lid. Circular doughnut-shaped cavities 18 and 20 are separated wit'hin intake spherical drum 10 by a partition wall 22 positioned within intake spherical drum 10 an equi distance from annular sidewalls 14 and 16.<br>
Partition wall 22 has positioned centrally therethrough/ a shaft mounting element 24/ the length of which is complimentary with the width of spherical end wall 12. Central shaft mounting element 24 has an axial throughbore 26 positioned therethrough. Central shaft mounting element 24 and axial throughbore 26 provide the means for mounting intake spherical drum 10 on a centrally-disposed shaft 28 (not shown) to provide for the rotational disposition of intake spherical drum 10 for the introduction of fuel and air mixture into an automotive cylinder as more further described hereafter.<br>
Spherical circumferential end wall 12 has positioned on its  surface  an  aperture  30 for communication with circular<br><br>
doughnut-shaped cavities 18 and 20. Partition wall 22 has a passageway defined therethrough for communication between circular doughnut-scaped cavities 18 and 20. This passageway 32 being positioned in partition wall 22 adjacent aperture 30 in spherical circumferential end wall 12.<br>
In this configuration/ both circular doughnut-shaped cavities 18 and 20 will be in communication with a source of fuel/air mixture or air mixture from an intake manifold/ for introduction into the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. Intake spherical drum 10 can therefore be fed the fuel/air mixture or air mixture from both sides of the drum.<br>
Aperture 30 in spherical end wall 12 will communicate with the inlet opening of the cylinder of the internal combustion engine as a result of the rotation of intake spherical drum 10 on shaft 28. The intake aperture will permit the fuel/air mixture or air mixture/ in the case of fuel-injected engines/ to pass from circular doughnut-shaped cavities 18 and 20 through aperture 30 and into the cylinder.<br>
Further rotation of spherical intake drum 10 will move the intake aperture 30 away from the inlet to the cylinder with the spherical circumferential end wall 12 of intake spherical drum 10 causing a seal with the inlet to the cylinder/ thus interrupting the flow of the fuel/air mixture into the cylinder. The fuel air mixture or air mixture will continue to flow from the intake manifold into circular doughnut-shaped cavities 18<br><br>
and 20 of intake spherical drum 10 for introduction into the cylinder on the next rotation of the spherical intake drum 10 when intake aperture 30 again becomes complimentary with the inlet to the chamber.<br>
Considering Figures 4, 5 and 6/ there is illustrated a side view/ end view and perspective view of an exhaust spherical drum 40 which is the subject of the present invention. Exhaust spherical drum 40 is defined by a spherical section formep I by two (2) parallel sidewalls 44 and 46 disposed about I.the spherical center/ thereby defining a spherical circumferential end wall 42. Sidewalls 44 and 46/ respectively/ have depending inwardly therefrom/ cavities 48 and 50. Cavities 48 and 50 are separated within exhaust spherical drum 40 by a partition wall 52 positioned within exhaust spherical drum 40.<br>
Partition wall 52 has positioned centrally therethrough a shaft mounting element 54/ the length of which is complimentary with the width of spherical end wall 42. Central shaft mounting element 54 has an axial throughbore 56 positioned therethrough. Central shaft mounting element 54 and axial throughbore 56 provide the means for mounting exhaust spherical drum 40 on a centrally-disposed shaft 28 (not shown) to provide for the rotational disposition of exhaust spherical drum 40 for the evacuation of spent gases from an automotive cylinder as more further described hereafter.<br>
Spherical circumferential end wall 42 has positioned on its surface, an aperture 60 for communication with cavities 48<br><br>
and 50. Partition wall 52 has a passageway defined therethrough for communication between cavities 48 and 50- This passageway 62 is positioned in the partition wall 52 adjacent aperture 60 in spherical circumferential end wall 42.<br>
In this configuration, both cavities 48 and 50 will be in communication with an exhaust manifold for the evacuation of spent gases from the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. Exhaust spherical drum 40 can therefore evacuate the spent gases from a cylinder utilizing both sides of the drum.<br>
Aperture 60 and spherical end wall 42/ in operation/ will<br>
communicate with the outlet opening of the cylinder of the<br>
internal combustion engine as a result of the rotation of the<br>
exhaust spherical drum 40 on shaft 58.  The exhaust aperture<br>
i will permit the spent gases to pass from the cylinder/ through<br>
aperture 60/  and thence cavities 48 and 50 to the exhaust<br>
manifold.<br>
The further rotation of exhaust spherical drum 40 will<br>
move the exhaust aperture 60 away from the outlet to the<br>
cylinder with spherical circumferential end wall 42 of exhaust<br>
spherical drum 40 causing a seal with the outlet from the<br>
cylinder/ thus, interrupting the evacuation of the spent gases<br>
from the cylinder.   With the exhaust spherical drum 40 in the<br>
closed or  interrupted state/  the cylinder would undergo its<br>
charging and compression/power stroke/ and the further rotation<br>
of the exhaust spherical drum 40 would bring aperture 60 into<br><br>
contact witn cne exhaust outlet on tne cylinder so as to permit the spent gases to be released from the cylinder during the exhaust*stroke, through the outlet port of the cylinder/ through aperture 60/ and thence along cavities 48 and 50 to the exhaust mani fold.<br>
In the preferred embodiment/ cavities 48 and 50 would vary in depth from annular sidewalls 44 and 46 to partition wall 52  in order to encourage  the evacuation of exhaust ga^efl. Partition wall 52 would define the maximum depth in cavities 48 and 50 immediately adjacent the edge of aperture 60 which would rotate  into  initial  alignment  with  outlet  opening  of the cylinder.  The depth of cavities 48 and 50 would decrease such that there would be a plug 49 and 51 formed in cavities 48 and 50 adjacent the opposite edge of aperture 60.  This opposite edge  of  aperture  60  being that portion which  is last  in communication with the outlet opening of the cylinder during rotation.   The  incline within cavities 48 and 50 could be gradually helical shaped or a severe upslope proximate to plugs 49 and  51.   The purpose is to provide a thrust effect to encourage rapid evacuation of exhaust gases to the manifold.  It should be understood that the exhaust valve would also function with cavities 48 and 50 at a fixed depth.  Plugs 49 and 51 are a preferrable embodiment in order to impart additional thrust to the exhaust gases.<br>
The concept of the spherical rotary valve is to eliminate the need for push-rod valves and their associated hardware and<br><br>
to  provide  a means  for charging the cylinder for its power stroke and evacuating the cylinder during its exhaust stroke. As will be more apparent hereafter with reference to Figure 1, intake spherical drum 10, and in particular, cavities 18 and 20 are in constant communication with the incoming fuel/air mixture from  inlet  port  114  from  the carburetor and  this  fuel/air mixture in cavities 18 and 20 is introduced into the cylinder when inlet aperture 30 comes into rotational alignment with the inlet port in lower half of the cylinder head as described hereafter.  When intake aperture 30 is not in alignment with the inlet port of the cylinder/ arcuate circumferential periphery of end wall 12 serves to seal the inlet port of the cylinder.  With respect to the exhaust stroke of the cylinder/  the arcuate circumferential periphery of end wall 42 of exhaust spherical drum 40 maintains a seal on the exhaust port of the cylinder until  exhaust  aperture  60  on  the  arcuate  circumferential periphery of exhaust spherical drum 40 comes into rotational alignment with the exhaust port of the cylinder positioned in the lower half of the cylinder head.  The exhaust stroke of the piston  then  forces the evacuation of the gases through the exhaust port into cavities 48 and 50 of exhaust spherical drum 40  and  thence  to  the  exhaust  manifold  120.    It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the positioning of intake aperture 30 on intake spherical drum 10 and exhaust aperture 60 on exhaust spherical drum 40 is done with respect to<br><br>
the power strokes and exhaust strokes of the piston within the cylinder and the timing requirements of the engine.<br>
Referring to Figure 8/ there is shown a side sectional view of the cylinder and cyl inder head with internal piston in conjunction with the intake spherical drum 10.  The cylinder and piston and block are similar to that of a conventional internal combustion engine.   There is shown an engine block 100 having disposed therein a cylinder cavity 102 there being positioned within cylinder cavity 102, a reciprocating piston 104 whicn lis secured to a crankshaft 103 and which moves in a reciprocating action within cylinder cavity 102.  The cylinder cavity itself is  surrounded  by  a  plurality  of  enclosed passageways 106 designed to permit the passage therethrough of a cooling fluid to  maintain  the  temperature  of  the  engine.   As will be recognized by one skilled in the art/ when the head is removed from an internal combustion engine/  the cylinder cavity and piston enclosed therein can be viewed.  Applicant's engine head is a split head comprised of a lower section 110 which is secured to the engine block 100 and contains an intake port 108 for  cylinder  102.    Intake  port  108  is  positioned  in a hemispherical drum-accommodating cavity 107 defined by the inner section  of  two  perpendicular  parallel  planes  in  order  to accommodate the positioning of intake spherical drum 10.   The upper  half  112 of the split head assembly also contains a hemispherical drum-accommodating cavity 113 defined by the inner<br><br>
section of two parallel planes in order to define a cavity for receipt of the upper half of intake spherical drum 10. When upper half 112 and lower half 110 of the head are secured to the engine block by standard head bolts/ intake spherical drum 10 is rotationally encapsulated within the cavity defined by the two halves of the split head assembly.<br>
There is formed in upper and lower split head assemblies 112 and 110/ a cavity coincidental with sidewalls 14 and 16 and hence with cavities 18 and 20 in intake spherical drum 10. These cavities 115 and 117 are in communication with the intake manifold and an inlet port 114 to permit the fuel/air mixture to flow into cavities 18 and 20 of inlet spherical drum 10. In this manner/ inlet spherical drum 10 is in constant communication with the source of fuel/air mixture being fed into cavities 18 and 20 such that when intake aperture 30 on circumferential end wall periphery 12 of intake spherical drum 10 comes into alignment with the inlet port to the cylinder/ the fuel/air mixture is positioned for introduction into the cylinder.  This arrangement is best illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
A sealing mechanism 116 as described hereafter is positioned about inlet port 108 to cylinder cavity 102 in order o provide an effective seal during the rotational disposition Of intake spherical drum 10. Sealing mechanism 116 provides an effective seal with the circumferential periphery of end wall 12 &gt;f intake spherical drum 10.<br><br>
In  this  configuration,  cavities  18 and 20 on intake spherical  drum  10  are  continually  charged  with  a  fuel/air mixture through inlet port 114.   This fuel/air mixture is not introduced into cylinder cavity 102 until  intake aperture 30 comes  into rotational  alignment with  inlet port  108 to the cylinder 120.  Sealing mechanism 116 cooperates with the arcuate circumferential  periphery 12 of  intake spherical  drum 10 to provide the effective gas tight seal to ensure the fuel/air mixture passes from cavities 18 and 20 through inlet port 'jldB and  into  cylinder  cavity  102.   In normal  operation/  this introduction occurs with the downward movement of piston 104 during the intake stroke thus charging the cylinder with the fuel/air mixture.   As soon as the inlet aperture 30 has been closed such that it no longer is in alignment with inlet port 108  to  the  cylinder/  the arcuate spherical circumferential periphery 12 of intake spherical drum 10 would seal the inlet port in cooperation with seal 116 in preparation for the power stroke of piston 104 and the ignition of the fuel/air mixture. The rotation of intake spherical drum 10 is accomplished by means  of shaft 28 upon which intake spherical drum 10 is mounted.  Shaft 28 in communication with a timing chain or other similar device and the crankshaft to which the pistons 104 are mounted  ensures  the  appropriate  timing  of  the  opening  and closing of inlet port 108 by means of alignment with inlet aperture 30 on intake spherical drum 10.<br><br>
Exhaust spherical drum 40 is disposed within the same engine block 100 having a cylinder cavity 102 disposed therein in a reciprocating piston 104 within the cylinder cavity 102. Lower and upper heads 110 and 112 are secured to the engine block 100. Exhaust spherical drum 40 is rotationally disposed within the lower half and upper half 110 and 112 of the split head assembly in a drum accommodating cavity 107 and 113 similar to the intake spherical drum 10, Exhaust spherical drum 40 is in communication with an exhaust port 109 for cylinder cavity 102.<br>
In the exhaust mode/ piston 104 has completed its power stroke; thus compressing and igniting the fuel/air mixture within the cylinder. This power stroke is accomplished with the arcuate spherical circumferential periphery of intake spherical<br>
drum 10 and exhaust spherical drum 30 providing the required<br>
i<br>
sealing closure of the respective intake port 108 and exhaust port 109. The ignition of the fuel/air mixture serves to drive • piston 104 downwardly within cylinder cavity 102 and thence piston 104 begins its ascent in the exhaust stroke. Exhaust spherical drum 40 rotating on shaft 28 and in timing communication with the crankshaft rotates to bring aperture 60 on the spherical periphery of exhaust drum 40 in communication with exhaust port 109. In this configuration, a conduit passageway is defined through the exhaust spherical drum 40 from exhaust port 109 at the top of the cylinder head with the spent<br><br>
gases being exhausted from the cylinder through exhaust port<br>
109/ through aperture 60, and into cavities 48 and 50.  Thence<br>
to exhaust conduit 120 through chambers 121 and 123 on opposing<br>
sides of exhaust valve 40 which exit to the exhaust manifold and<br>
to the ambient atmosphere (see Figure 7).  The initial opening<br>
of  exhaust  spherical  drum  40  introduces  spent  gases  into<br>
cavities 48 and 50 at the point where their depth is greatest.<br>
As previously explained/ cavities 48 and 50 gradually decrease<br>
in depth until a seal is formed by plug walls 49 and 51 • Ms<br>
design serves to accelerate the exhaust gases through spherical<br>
exhaust drum 40 in order to hasten the evacuation of cylinder<br>
cavity  102-   Upon completion of the evacuation of cylinder<br>
cavity 102/ the circumferential periphery end wall 42 of exhaust<br>
spherical drum 40 again contacts a sealing means 116/ similar to<br>
that of the intake spherical drum 10 to form a seal with respect<br>
to exhaust port 109 until the next exhaust stroke of piston 104<br>
occurs within cylinder cavity 102.<br>
Figure 9 is a perspective view of a paired intake spherical drum 10 and exhaust spherical drum 40 positioned within the lower section 110 of the split head assembly with respect to a single cylinder. Similarly/ it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that if a V-6 or V-8 or V-12 engine or the like is utilized/ each bank of cylinders would have a similarly-positioned spherical rotary valve assembly associated therewith.  Another embodiment of the invention would<br><br>
be to provide the intake spherical drums 10 and the exhaust spherical drums 40 would be positioned on a single shaft if the size of the engine were such so that the twin feeding of the intake valve and the twin exhausting of the exhaust valve could be accomplished without affecting the structure integrity of the engine•<br>
Shaft 28 and rotary spherical drums 10 and 40 are supported in a split head assembly by a plurality of bearing surfaces 130. Spherical drums 10 and 40 are machined as is the drum accommodating cavities 107 and 113/ the tolerances between the spherical drums and the cavities being approximately l/1000th of an inch. When shaft 28 and the spherical drum asssembly is positioned within the split head/ shaft 28 contacts bearing surfaces 130 and spherical drums 10 and 40/ respectively are in contact with only the sealing means 116/ the embodiments of which are described hereafter.<br>
Figure 10a/ b, c and d illustrates the manner in which the exhaust gases are evacuated from the cylinder through exhaust drum 40 and thence to the exhaust manifold. Figure 10 illustrates the manner in which the airflow exits cylinder 102 through exhaust outlet 109 and through aperture 60 on the spherical periphery of exhaust drum 40/ thus entering cavities 48 and 50 of exhaust drum 40. The spent exhaust gases then exit cavities 48 and 50 by way of exhaust chambers 121 and 123/ respectively (see Figure 7).   These exhaust gases are given a<br><br>
final impetus by means of plugs 49 and 51 immediately prior to<br>
the  exhaust  process  commencing  anew with  the  alignment  of<br>
aperture 60 with exhaust port 109.<br>
Figure 11 is a side exploded view illustrating sealing<br>
means  116 and Figure 12  is an exploded perspective view of<br>
sealing means 116.  The description of sealing means 116 is made<br>
herein with respect to the rotary intake valve 10/ but sealing<br>
means 116 is of the same design and serves the same purpose and<br>
i function  with  respect  to  its  relationship with  the  rdtdry<br>
exhaust valve 40.<br>
Sealing means 116 is comprised of two primary members. A lower receiving ring 140 is configured to be received within annular groove 138 in the lower half of the split head assembly and circumferentially positioned about inlet port 108. Inner circumferential wall 144 and outer circumferential wall 142 are secured by a planar circumferential base 148 thereby defining an annular receiving groove 150 for receipt of the upper valve seal r i ng 15 2.<br>
Upper valve seal ring 152 has a centrally-disposed aperture 154 in alignment with aperture 146 and lower receiving member 140. The outer wall 153 of upper valve seal 152 is stepped inwardly from upper surface 156 to lower surface 158 in order to define an annular groove 160 for receipt of a blast ring 162. Upper valve seal member 152 is designed to fit within annular groove 150 in lower valve seal receiving member 140.<br><br>
The upper surface 156 of upper valve seal ring 152 is curved inwardly towards the center of aperture 154, the upper surface"having an annular indent 164 for the receipt of a carbon insert lubricating ring 166. Carbon insert lubricating ring 166 extends above upper surface 156 of upper valve seal ring 152 and ontacts the spherical peripheral surface of the rotary intake valve 10. The curvature of upper surface 156 is such that it conforms to the peripheral curvature of intake rotary valve 10 with carbon insert lubricating ring 166 in intimate contact with the peripheral surface of rotary intake valve 10.<br>
The contact between carbon insert lubricating ring 166 and the peripheral surface of rotary intake valve 10 is maintained by annular beveled springs 170 positioned in the annular receiving groove 150 below upper valve seal ring 152. The pressure to be maintained upwardly on the upper valve seal ring 152 is in the range of between 1 to 4 ounces. As such/ this pressure can be accomplished by either a single bevel spring located in annular receiving groove 150 or a plurality of annular beveled springs.<br>
Upper valve seal ring 152 has positioned about annular groove 160/ a blast ring 162 which functions similar to a piston ring associated with a piston. Blast ring 162 serves to provide additional sealing contact between valve seal 116 and the peripheral surface of rotary intake valve 10 and the rotary exhaust  valve during the compression and power stroke.   The<br><br>
increased gas pressure within the cylinder and within annular groove 150 will increase the pressure below the blast ring 162 which forms a seal with the outer circumferential wall 142 preventing the escape of gases/ and yet providing an upward force on upper valve seal ring 152/ thus forcing a better contact seal between the carbon insert ring 164 and the peripheral surface of rotary intake valve 10. The same interaction will occur with the valve seal associated with rotary exhaust valve 40. During the intake and exhaust stroke/ the carbon insert ring 64 will be maintained in contact with the rotary exhaust valve by means of beveled springs positioned in annular groove 150.<br>
The upward pressure during the combustion or power stroke is transmitted to upper valve seal ring 152 by means of a compression of the gases in the cylinder and an inlet port 102 by means of passageway 163 between the upper valve seal ring 152 and lower receiving ring 140 such that the gases can expand into annular receiving groove 50 beneath upper valve seal 52/ but are presented from escaping by means of blast ring 60 in contact with the outer circumferential wall 142 of lower receiving ring 140. This provides additional pressure along with bevel spring 170 in providing contact between carbon insert 166 and the peripheral surface of the valve.<br>
The configuration of sealing means 116 provides for an intimate seal with the rotary intake and rotary exhaust valve<br><br>
and in fact/ is the only contact with the intake rotary valve or exhaust rotary valve during the course of its revolution within the drum accommodating cavities. This significantly reduces the number of mechanical parts within the engine and thereby reduces the friction encountered in the operation of the engine.<br>
While the present invention has been described in connection with the exemplary embodiments thereof/ it will be understood that many modifications be be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and the application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations thereof. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that this invention be only limited by the claims and the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
