POLYAMIDE MOLDING MATERIALS REINFORCED WITH FLAT GLASS FIBERS AND INJECTION MOLDED PARTS MADE THEREOF;<br>
EMS-CHEMIE AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS REICHENAUERSTRASSE, CH-7013 DOMAT/EMS, SWITZERLAND<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Related Applications<br>
The present application claims priority to European Patent Application No. EP 06 027 036.0, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety as if fully disclosed herein.<br>
Field<br>
The present invention relates to reinforced polyamide molding materials comprising low viscous polyamides and glass fibers with flat shape, especially glass fibers with non-circular cross-sectional area and a dimensional relation of the main cross-sectional axis to the secondary cross-sectional axis of between 2 and 5. The present invention further relates to a process for the production of polyamide molding materials, as well as molded parts made thereof, i.e. in particular injection molded parts. According to the invention a polyamide with a solution viscosity of r|rei in the range of more than 1.3 to less than 1.9 (measured in m-cresole, 0.5 wt.-%, 20°C) is regarded as a low viscous polyamide. The relative viscosity of r|rei less than 1.9 corresponds to a molecular weight (Mn, numerical average) of the polyamides of less than 20,000 g/mol.<br>
Background<br>
Reinforced polyamides are playing an increasing role in the field of technical construction materials, since they have high rigidity, high toughness and high heat distortion temperature. Fields of application are, for example, internal and external parts in the automotive sector and in the field of other means of transport, housing material for appliances and equipment for telecommunication, consumer electronics,  household appliances, machinery equipment,<br>
 <br>
 <br>
apparatus in the field of heating and fixing parts for installation. Metal like properties are important for parts, for example, in the automotive sector, but these can only be achieved by highly filled, reinforced molding materials. For thin-walled parts, particularly a high flow length of the molding materials is necessary, which flow length, however cannot or can only very poorly be achieved in molding materials that are reinforced by endless fibers.<br>
There is also a special advantage of reinforced polyamides in the exceptionally good bonding between polymer matrix and reinforcing materials. This is true even at high reinforcement levels, resulting in products with high tensile modulus of elasticity. However, the toughness of the products is not sufficient to fulfill all requirements.<br>
In the following such polymers are regarded as polyamides in the present invention that have basic building blocks, which are held together by amide bonds (-NH-CO-), and which can be prepared by polycondensation or polymerization of monomers, as for example dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acid halides, dinitriles, diamines, aminocarboxylic acids and/or lactames. They can be homopolyamides or copolyamides. The average molecular weight of the polyamide should be more than 5,000, preferably more than 10,000 but less than 20,000, corresponding to solution viscosities of r|rei lower than 1.9, especially r|rei lower than 1.8, particularly preferred T|rei lower than 1.7.<br>
EP 0 190 011 Bl describes glass fibers with elliptical or rectangular cross-section, as well as their manufacture. The use of these particular glass fibers for the manufacture of composite parts is mentioned. Due to the larger surface of the fibers, higher strength values result in the composites.<br>
EP 0 196 194 Bl describes a strand consisting of a variety of glass monofilaments with a non-circular cross-section, as well as their manufacture. The cross-section of the glass fibers can be oval, elliptical, cocoon shaped or polygonal.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
EP 0 199 328 Bl describes a fabric for printed circuit boards, which is essentially made of glass fibers with non-circular cross-section. The individual fibers have oval, elongated or elliptical cross sections. Unsaturated polyester resins, epoxy resins, phenol resins, polyimide resins or PTFE are described as matrices for this fabric.<br>
EP 0 246 620 Bl describes an article made of a glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin. The, glass fibers have a rectangular, elliptical or cocoon shaped cross section. It is shown that glass fibers with non-circular cross-section have advantages in terms of strength and toughness, especially at a high degree of reinforcement (&gt; 60%).<br>
EP 0 376 616 Bl describes a thermoplastic polymer composition comprising a thermoplastic resin and 1 to 65% of a fiber like reinforcement with a non-circular cross-section, wherein the cross-sectional area and the ratio of the perpindicular cross-sections of the reinforcing fibers are characterized in more detail. The cross-section of the reinforcing fibers has a semicircular or arcuate contour. The composition is characterized by high dimensional stability and reduced warpage.<br>
EP 0 400 935 Bl describes a flame retardant fiber reinforced polyester composition that includes 1 to 60 wt% glass fibers. According to EP 0 400 935 Bl, the used glass fibers have a cross-sectional shape, which is selected from the group-of flattened, elliptical, oval, partly circular, curved and rectangular cross-sectional shapes. These flame retardant reinforced polyester composites according to EP 0 400 935 Bl show a decreased deformation without their mechanical properties being adversely influenced by crystalline polyester resins. In this respect, it was found according to EP 0 400 935 Bl that the deformation, i.e. warping of crystalline polyester resins can be reduced without reducing the mechanical properties of the resin, for example, the bending strength and rigidity and the processability.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
According to JP 10219026 A2 the thermoplastic matrix is reinforced by a mixture of glass fibers with a circular cross-section and glass fibers with a flat cross section to reduce warpage of thermoplastic parts. Polyamide 66 is used as a polymer matrix in the only example of this document.<br>
JP 2004285487 Al describes a bundle of glass fibers, consisting of glass filaments with a flat cross-section, which are hold together by a non-volatile sizing, and a thermoplastic composition, consisting of 5 to 75% of glass fiber bundles and a polyolefin matrix.<br>
JP 2006045390 A2 describes a granulate reinforced by long glass fibers, consisting of a thermoplastic matrix and up to 60 wt.-% of glass fibers with a flat cross section. Granulate length and fiber length is identical. Advantageous features of molded parts made from the reinforced composition according to JP 2006045390 A2 are good surface quality and high impact strength.<br>
Polyamide molding materials, which have good mechanical properties and a very small warpage, are described in the still unpublished patent application EP 06014372.4. These properties are obtained by a combination of transparent polyamide with fibrous reinforcing materials and particulate fillers. Regarding the fibrous reinforcement materials there are basically no restrictions. They are preferably selected from the group consisting of glass fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers, aramide fibers, whiskers and mixtures thereof. The glass fibers can be added as endless fibers or as chopped glass fibers. The glass fibers can have round, oval or rectangular cross section.<br>
The also still unpublished application EP 05025216.2 describes reinforced polyamide molding materials made from a blend of polyamide 66 and a copolyamide 6T/6I. A mixture of glass fibers and carbon fibers is used as a reinforcing material. To further increase the<br>
 <br>
 <br>
rigidity, a portion of the glass fibers is substituted by carbon fibers, so that a hybrid fiber reinforced compound is used.<br>
Summary<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide new reinforced polyamide molding materials based on low viscous polyamides, i.e., with molecular weights (Mn) of less than 20,000 g/mol, which are clearly superior to the molding materials with glass fibers with a circular cross-section in terms of mechanical properties and processing properties. The molded parts made from the molding materials should also have high transversal rigidity and transversal resistance.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
According to the invention it has been found that flat glass fibers (ratio of the cross-sectional axes &gt; 2) show significant advantages in the mechanical properties, processing and surface quality compared to those with circular cross-section. This is particularly true for high glass fiber contents of &gt; 50 %. Thus, in inventive polyamide molding materials, particularly for example, in PA 12 with 65 wt.-% glass fibers with otherwise same formulation, twice as high notch impact strength has been found using flat glass fibers when compared to glass fibers with a circular geometry. These high toughness values are also found, if an inventive polyamide molding material, particularly a PA12 with lower molecular weight, is used. A PA12 with lower molecular weight has a low melt viscosity. Therefore, it has advantages in the injection molding process.<br>
Usually lower toughness values are found in polyamides with low molecular weights than in those with higher molecular weights. However, at high filling levels the thermoplastic processing is complicated due to higher viscosity of the higher molecular polyamides. This manifests in difficult form filling, sink marks and poor surface quality.<br>
According to the invention it has been further found that, especially for high<br>
percentages of flat glass fibers, products can be made, which have good processability, low<br>
warpage, high surface quality and substantially higher toughness compared to those materials,<br>
 <br>
 <br>
which contain glass fibers that have a circular cross-section, when using the inventive molding materials, preferably with the low viscous, aliphatic partly crystalline polyamides, more preferably with low viscous PA 12.<br>
Compared to glass fibers with a circular cross-section, glass fibers with a cross-section with different values of main axis and secondary axis (flat glass fibers) have a significantly higher packing density at high levels of reinforcement, which results in higher moduli and strength, especially transverse to the fiber orientation. However, the expected improvement in rigidity and strength is only completely realized, if the rather smaller spaces between the flat glass fibers are sufficiently infiltrated with polymer matrix, and the matrix allows sufficient forwarding of the forces occurring during deformation. Only the polyamides with low viscosity according to the invention make full use of the potential of geometrically advantageous flat glass fibers.<br>
Especially components which are under pressure during use, as for example, valve housings or water meter housings, benefit from the increased rigidity and strength transversal to the fiber orientation, because burst pressure and deformation resistance are improved among others. Due to the higher transverse rigidity of components made from the inventive molding materials, which is 10 to 40 % above the level of molding compounds with glass fibers with circular cross-section, depending on the composition, there are significantly fewer deformations of the component under varying pressure loads. This is of particular interest, because molding compounds based on aliphatic polyamides with usual glass fibers of circular cross-section often show low transverse rigidity compared to the longitudinal rigidity. This shortcoming can be offset by using flat glass fibers in combination with polyamides, since not only the individual values for the longitudinal and transverse rigidity are increased, but also the ratio of transverse to longitudinal rigidity.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The matrix of polyamide molding materials, which is used according to the invention, is based, as described above, on at least one aliphatic, partly crystalline polyamide (component (A)) or at least one amorphous and microcrystalline polyamide (component B), or a mixture of components A and B, wherein at least 50 wt.-parts aliphatic components (A) must be present in the mixture of (A) and (B).<br>
The aliphatic, partly crystalline polyamide (component (A)) has a solution viscosity r\K\, measured in m-cresol (0.5 wt-%), of more than 1.3 to less than 1.9, preferably more than 1.35 and less than 1.9 and more preferably of more than 1.4 to less than 1.9, preferably by r|rei less than 1.8, particularly r|rei less than 1.7.

 <br>
The flat glass fibers used according to the invention are glass fibers with a flat shape, and a non-circular cross-sectional area, with the ratio of perpendicular cross-sectional axes greater than or equal to 2, and the smaller cross-sectional axis of a length &gt; 3 urn. The glass fibers have the form of chopped glass strands with a length of 2 to 50 mm.

In a special embodiment of the invention the glass fiber amount is always more than 60 wt.-%.<br>
By using chopped glass strands according to the invention granules of long glass fiber can be excluded. Surprisingly, high notch impact values have been achieved according to the invention, which have otherwise only been observed for long-fiber reinforcement and polyamides with high molecular weights and which are here observed for chopped glass fibers. Also, the individual filaments are not hold together by any "glue" or special sizings. According to the invention, high notch impact values, particularly at high reinforcement values are achieved: notch impact values of more than 25 kJ/m2 for a glass fiber percentage of 50 to 60 wt.-%, notch impacts of more than 30 kJ/m2 for a glass fiber percentage of more than 60 wt.-%.<br>
Furthermore high flow lengths are achieved according to the invention, especially for the thin-walled (injection molding) parts made from the inventive molding materials: flow lengths of &gt; 200 mm at reinforcement levels of &gt; 40 wt.-%. The surface quality of the injection-molded parts made from the molding materials is also quite excellent, as can be seen from the attached Table 1 (gloss values).<br>
Optionally, additional fillers and reinforcing agents can be added to the polyamide molding compounds (component (D)) in quantities of 0 to 40 wt.-%, wherein carbon fibers are excluded.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The molding materials according to the invention may also include other additives (E), for example from the group of inorganic stabilizers, organic stabilizers, lubricants, dyes, nucleating agents, metallic pigments, metal gewgaw, metal coated particles, halogen- comprising flame retardants, halogen-free flame retardants, impact modifiers, antistatics conductivity additives, mold releasing agents, optical brighteners, natural sheet silicates, synthetic sheet silicates or mixtures of the above additives.<br>
For example, carbon black and/or carbon nanotubes can be used as antistatics in the inventive molding materials.<br>
The use of carbon black can also improve the black color of the molding material.<br>
For example, kaolins, serpentines, talc, mica, vermiculite, illite, smectite, montmorillonite, hectorit, doublehydroxydes or mixtures thereof may be used as sheet silicates in the inventive molding materials. The sheet silicates may be surface treated, but may also be untreated.<br>
For example, antioxidants, light stabilizers, UV stabilizers, UV absorbers, or UV-Blocker may be used as stabilizers and aging protection products, respectively, in the inventive molding materials.<br>
As outlined above, the flat glass fibers (C) are added as chpooed glass strands according to the invention. These glass fibers have a diameter of the small cross-sectional axis of 3 to 20 urn and a diameter of the large cross-sectional axis of 6 to 40 urn, wherein the ratio of orthogonal cross-sectional axes is between 2 and 5, preferably between 3 and 4. Particularly, E glass fibers are used according to the invention. However, all other glass fiber types, such as A, C, D, M, S, R glass fibers or any mixtures thereof or mixtures with E glass fibers may be used. The usual sizings for polyamide are used, such as various amino silane sizings.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The preparation of the polyamide molding materials according to the invention can be effected on customary compounding machines, such as, for example, single-screw or twin-screw extruders or screw kneaders. As a rule, the polymeric fraction is first melted and the reinforcing material (glass fibers) can be introduced at the same point or at different points of the extruder, for example, by means of a side feeder. The compounding is preferably effected at set barrel temperatures of 280°C to 320°C. Gentler processing of the inventive molding materials results in reinforced molded parts, wherein the fiber length distribution is significantly shifted to higher fiber lengths. Thus, the inventive molding materials have an average fiber length, which is by 20 to 200 % higher as compared to molded parts based on glass fibers with a round cross-section.<br>
The molded parts produced from the molding materials according to the invention are used for the production of interior and exterior parts, preferably having a supporting or mechanical function, in the electrical, furniture, sport, mechanical engineering, sanitary and hygiene areas, medicine, energy and drive technology, in the automotive sector and the sector relating to other means of transport, or housing material for devices and apparatuses for telecommunication, entertainment electronics, household appliances, mechanical engineering, the heating sector or fixing parts for installations or for containers and ventilation parts of all types.<br>
In particular the area of metal die casting replacement in which extremely high rigidity in combination with good toughness is expected may be mentioned as possible applications for the molded parts produced from the molding materials according to the invention.<br>

The following examples illustrate the advantages of inventive molding materials in terms of improved transversal strength and transversal rigidity.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
To determine the rigidity and strength longitudinal and transversal to the sprue, test specimens of the dimension 10 x 100 x 2 mm were used. They were both seperated from the middle of plates of the dimension 100 x 100 x 2 mm (with film-sprue respectively). The plates were made from the molding materials of example 2 (flat glass fibers: according to the invention) and CE2 (glass fibers with a round cross-section).<br>

For the tensile test, special test specimens (BIAX, published in Noss'Ovra staff magazine, December 2006, No 12, volume 29, EMS-CHEMIE AG) were used, which enable anisotropic measurement of rigidity and strength.<br>
It results from the comparison between example 4 (according to the invention) and comparative example 4, that transversal rigidity can be enhanced by more than 10 % and cross-strength can be enhanced by more than 20 % via a combination of flat glass fibers with the inventive low viscous polyamide molding material.<br>
After incinerating the test specimens, the length distribution of the glass fibers, and the average fiber length have been determined. The inventive molding materials contained<br>
glass fibers with significantly increased fiber length.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Production of the test specimens via injection molding shows another advantage of the inventive molding materials, namely significantly reduced filling pressure as compared to the usual molding materials, which are reinforced with round glass fibers. The combination of low viscous polyamides and flat glass fibers enables the production of injection molded parts with a filling pressure reduced by 20 - 30 %.<br>
Warpage is determined according to the following specification:<br>
Warpage measurement (see Figures 1 to 7)<br>
Warpage is determined at an injection molded body according to Figure 1. The sprue is done from the bottom in z direction. The injection molded bodies were made at 280°C melt temperature, and 80°C molding temperature.<br>
The positions 1 to 12 were determined in x direction in relation to point 4 and the positions 13 to 27 were determine in z direction in relation to point 16 using a coordinate measuring machine of the brand Tesa Validator! 0 (see Figures 2 and 3).<br>
These position deviations are plotted for the individual positions. They are shown in Figures 4 to 7.<br>
In the case of the injection molded body with flat glass fibers, a noticeably more isotropic behavior regarding form preservation and a significantly lower average warpage is observed over all measuring points.<br>
