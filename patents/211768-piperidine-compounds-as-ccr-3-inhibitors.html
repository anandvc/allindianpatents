Specific especially preferred compounds of the invention are those described hereinafter in the Examples, particularly those of Examples 4, 9, 10,15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 45.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I which<br>
comprises<br>
(i)    (A) reacting a compound of formula<br>
or an amide-forming derivative thereof, where Ar’, Ar’, R’ and n are as hereinbefore defined, or<br><br>
(B) reacting a compound of formula III, or an amide forming derivative thereof, with a compound of formula<br><br>
where Ar’, R’ and n are as hereinbefore defined and Z denotes a solid phase substrate chemically linked to the indicated nitrogen atom, and detaching the resulting product from the substrate to replace Z by hydrogen ; and (ii) recovering the product in free or salt form.<br>
In process variant (A), the compound of formula II may be in free or salt form. Process variant (A) may be effected using known methods, for example by reacting a compound of formula II with an acid halide, particularly acid chloride, of the acid of formula III using known amide-forming procedures. Conveniently, the compound of formula II in free or salt form is reacted with a free carboxylic acid of formula III, for example using known procedures, such as reaction in the presence of a tertiary amine and a peptide coupling agent such as a phosphonium salt, 2-(lH benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate or diisopropylcarbodiimide; this reaction may be carried out in an inert organic solvent, for example a halo hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane; the reaction temperature is conveniently from 0 to 40**C, preferably ambient temperature.<br>
In another method of effecting process variant (A), a compound of formula II, preferably in salt form, is reacted with an amide-forming derivative of the acid of formula III which is a trimester of formula<br><br>
where Ar’ is as hereinbefore defined. The reaction may be carried using known procedures or analogously as described hereinafter in the Examples. It may be effected in the presence of a tertiary base such as N-methylmorpholine. It is conveniently effected in an organic solvent, preferably an alcohol such as ethanol. The reaction temperature may be, for example, from 30 to 60’C, conveniently from 40 to 50°C.<br><br>
Process variant (B) may be effected using known methods, for example by reacting the substrate-bound compound with the free acid under known peptide coupling conditions, for example in the presence of a tertiary amine and a peptide coupling agent such as those mentioned above. The reaction may be effected in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF). Suitable reaction temperatures are from 0 to 40°C, e.g. 15 to 25*'C. The product may be detached from the substrate in a known manner, for example, where the N atom is linked to a CH2 of a benzyl group in Z, by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula III are either available commercially or may be prepared by known methods. Compounds of formula IIIA may be obtained by reaction of an acid of formula III with 2, 2'-dibenzothiazolyl disulfide in the presence of triphenylphosphine and a tertiary base such as N-methylmorpholine, e.g. as described in the Examples.<br><br>
where Ar’ R’ and n are as hereinbefore defined, with the proviso that when R’ contains a reactive functional group such as a hydroxy group, the reactive group may be in protected form, for example a hydroxy group protected as a tert-butoxy group, R’ is hydrogen or an amine-protective group, for example a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, and X is halogen and, where R’ is a protective group, replacing R’ in the product by hydrogen, and, where R’ in the product contains a protected functional group, replacing the protecting group by hydrogen. When R’ is hydrogen, reaction between a compound of formula V and a salt of a compound of formula VI may be effected by the procedures described in US4559349. When R’ is a protective group, reaction between compounds of formulae V and VI may be effected using known methods, for example in the presence of a tertiary organic base such as<br><br>
triethylamine or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), conveniently in an inert organic solvent, for example a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, the reaction temperature suitably being from 0 to 40°C, preferably ambient temperature. Replacement of a protective group R’ by hydrogen may be effected using known procedures; for example, where R’ is tert-butoxycarbonyl, by treatment with a carboxylic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid. Replacement of a protecting group in R’ may be affected using known procedures, for example, when R’ contains a hydroxy group protected as an ether group, such as tert-butoxy, by treatment with HBr in a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid; when R’ is a protective group, this treatment also replaces R’ by hydrogen. Compounds of formulae V and VI are known or may be prepared by known procedures.<br>
Where reference is made herein to protected functional groups or to protecting groups, the protecting groups may be chosen in accordance with the nature of the functional group, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, Second Edition, 1991, which reference also describes procedures suitable for replacement of the protecting groups by hydrogen.<br>
Compounds of formula II may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V with a compound of formula<br><br>
where R’ , R’ and n are as hereinbefore defined and a reducing agent such as sodium cyano borohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, for example using known reductive lamination procedures, conveniently in an inert organic solvent, for example an ether such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), the reaction temperature suitably being from 0 to 40*C, and, where R' is a protective group, replacing it by hydrogen. Compounds of formula VII are known or may be prepared by known procedures.<br>
Compounds of formula II where R’ is hydroxymethyl may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V with (R)-4-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-oxazolidine-3-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester, of formula<br><br><br>
and a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, for example under conditions described above for reaction of compounds of formulae V and VII, and reacting the product with a suitable reagent to cleave the oxazolidine ring and replace the nitrogen-bound ester group by hydrogen, for example hydrogen chloride in ethanol or dioxane as described hereinafter in the Examples, in which case the compound of formula II is obtained as a hydrochloride salt. The reaction product of the compounds of formulae V and Vila may, e.g. where it is desired to improve enantiomeric purity, be treated with an optically active acid such as di-0,0-benzoyl-L-tartaric acid before cleavage of the oxazoline ring. The compound of formula Vila may be prepared as described by A D Campbell et al, Synthesis 1707-1709 (1998) or G Agene et al. Tetrahedron 51, 8121-8134 (1995). Compounds of formula II where R’ is C1-C6-alkoxymethyl or acetoxyethyl can be prepared by appropriate etherification or acylation of compounds of formula II where R’ is hydroxy methyl.<br>
Compounds of formula IV may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V with a compound of formula<br><br>
where R’, Z and n are as hereinbefore defined, for example using known procedures such as reaction in an inert organic solvent such as DMF in the presence of a tertiary amine, conveniently at a temperature of 40 to 60*'C. Compounds of formula VIII may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula<br><br>
where R’, Z and n are as hereinbefore defined, with iodine, for example using known procedures such as reaction in an inert organic solvent such as a mixture of THF and acetonitrile  in  the   presence  of  a  triarylphosphine  and  imidazole,  conveniently  at  a<br><br>
temperature of 10 to 40°C. Compounds of formula IX may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula<br><br>
where R’ and n are as hereinbefore defined, with a solid phase substrate Z having a group, such as an aldehyde group, reactive with amino. Such solid phase substrates, including modified resins, particularly modified polystyrene resins, are commercially available. Compounds of formula X are known or may be prepared by known methods.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free form may be converted into salt form, and vice versa, in a conventional manner. The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystaUization.Compounds of formula I can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified in a conventional manner. Isomers, such as enantiomers, may be obtained in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallization or asymmetric synthesis from correspondingly asymmetrically substituted, e.g. optically active, starting materials.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as agents of the invention, are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form for use as a pharmaceutical. The agents of the invention act as CCR-3 receptor antagonists, thereby inhibiting the infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, and inhibiting allergic response. The inhibitory properties of agents of the invention can be demonstrated in the following assay :<br>
CCR-3 Binding Assay<br>
In this assay the effect of agents of the invention on the binding of human eotaxin to human CCR-3 is determined. Recombinant cells expressing human CCR-3 are captured by wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) polyvinyltoluidene (PVT) SPA beads (available from Amersham), through a specific interaction between the WGA and carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins on the surface of the cells. human eotaxin (available from Amersham) binds specifically to CCR-3 receptors bringing the [‘‘‘I]-human eotaxin in close proximity to<br><br>
the SPA beads. Emitted a-particles from the eotaxin excite, by its proximity, the fluorophore in the beads and produce light. Free [‘‘‘]-human eotaxin in solution is not in close proximity to the scintillate and hence does not produce light. The scintillation count is therefore a measure of the extent to which the test compound inhibits binding of the eotaxin totheCCR-3.<br>
Preparation of Assay Buffer: 5.96 g HEPES and 7.0 g sodium chloride are dissolved in distilled water and IM aqueous CaCl2 (1 mL) and IM aqueous MgCh (5 mL) are added. The pH is adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH and the solution made to a final volume of 1 L using distilled water. 5 g bovine serum albumin and 0.1 g sodium azide are then dissolved in the solution and the resulting buffer stored at 4°C. A Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (available from Boehringer) is added per 50 mL of the buffer on the day of use.<br>
Preparation of Homogenization Buffer: Tris-base (2.42g) is dissolved in distilled water, the pH of the solution is adjusted to 7.6 with hydrochloric acid and the solution is diluted with distilled water to a final volume of IL. The resulting buffer is stored at 4*'C. A Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet is added per 50 mL of the buffer on the day of use-Preparation of membranes; Confluent rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells stably expressing CCR3 are removed from tissue culture flasks using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells are centrifuged (800 g, 5 minutes), the pellet resuspended in ice-cold homogenisation buffer using 1 mL homogenisation buffer per gram of cells and incubated on ice for 30 minutes.The cells are homogenised on ice with 10 strokes in a glass mortar and pestle.The homogenate is centrifuged (800 g, 5 minutes, 4°C), the supernatant further centrifuged (48,000 g, 30 minutes, 4°C) and the pellet redissolved in Homogenisation Buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol.The protein content of the membrane preparation is estimated by the method of Bradford (Anal.Biochem. (1976) 72:248) and aliquots are snap frozen and stored at-80°C. The assay is performed in a final volume of 250 per well of an Opt plate (ex Canberra Packard). To selected wells of the Optiplate are added 50 ‘iL of solutions of a test compound in Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO (concentrations from O.OlnM to 10 ‘M). To determine total binding, 50 ‘iL of the Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO is added to other selected wells. To determine non-specific binding, 50 |iL of lOOnM human eotaxin (ex R&amp;D Systems) in Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO is added to further selected wells. To all wells are added 50 ‘L [i’’I]-Human eotaxin (ex Amersham) in Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO at a concentration of 250 pM (to give a final concentration of 50 pM per well), 50 |iL of WGA-PVT SPA beads in Assay Buffer   (to give a final concentration of l.Omg<br><br>
beads per well) and 100 the membrane preparation at a concentration of 100 ng protein in Assay Buffer (to give a final concentration of 10 ‘g protein per well). The plate is then incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The plate is sealed using Top Seal-S (ex Canberra Packard) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting scintillations are counted using a Canberra Packard Top Count, each well being counted for 1 minute. The concentration of test compound at which 50% inhibition occurs (IC50) is determined from concentration-inhibition curves in a conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the Examples hereinbelow have IC50 values below in the above assay. For instance, the compounds of Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 38, 40, 43 and 44 have IC5o(nM) values of 125, 68, 13, 15, 5, 26, 8, 10, 11, 2, 13, 14, 6, 22 and 25 respectively.<br>
Most of the compounds of the Examples exhibit selectivity for inhibition of CCR-3 binding relative to inhibition of binding of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor.The inhibitory properties of agents of the invention on binding of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor can be determined in the following assay:<br>
Cerebral cortices from male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-200 g) are dissected and homogenised in 10 volumes of ice cold 0.32 M sucrose (containing ImM MgCh dihydrate and ImM K2HPO4) with a glass/Teflon homogenizer. The membranes are centrifuged at 1000 X g for 15 min., the pellet discarded and the centrifugation repeated. The supernatants are pooled and centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 15 min. The pellet is osmotic ally shocked in 10 volumes of water and kept on ice for 30 min. The suspension is centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 20 min., resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit buffer pH 7.4 (1.17mM MgS04 anhydrous, 4.69 mM KCl, 0.7mM K2HPO4 anhydrous, 0.1 IM NaCl, 11 mM D-glucose and 25 mM NaHC03),containing 20mM Tris, and kept for 2 days at -20*'C. The membranes are then thawed at 20-23°C, washed three times with Krebs-Henseleit buffer by centrifugation at 18,000 X g for 15 min., left overnight at 4°C and washed again three times. The final pellet is resuspended with a glass/Teflon homogeniser in 125mL/100 membranes in the same buffer, A sample is taken to determine the protein concentration (using the Bradford Assay with gamma globulin as the standard) and the remainder aliquot and stored at -80°C. The resulting membranes are subjected to a radioligand binding assay. The assay is conducted in triplicate using 96 well plates containing [I25IJ.J’£AT (Amersham) (40pM, Ka: 58.9 ± 18.7 pM), unlabelled test compound and membrane (57.1ng/mL) to yield a final volume of 250’1 (assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-base and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.4),<br><br>
The plates are incubated at 37°C for 60 min., after which rapid vacuum filtration over Whitman GF/C 96 well filter plates is carried out. Each plate is then washed three times with 10ml of ice cold assay buffer using a Branded Cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). Following drying of the plates for 3 h. at 50°C, 40 |iL of MicroScint 20 is added to each well, the plates incubated at room temperature for a further 20 min. and the retained radioactivity quantified in a Packard Top count NXT scintillation counter. Stock solutions of test compounds are dissolved initially in 100 % DMSO and diluted with assay buffer to the required concentrations to yield 1 % (v/v) DMSO.<br>
The concentration of test compound at which 50% inhibition occurs (IC50) is determined from concentration-inhibition curves in a conventional manner. Compounds of Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 38, 40, 43 and 44 have IC5o(nM) values of 210, 221, 94, 48, 58, 53, 89,131, 387, 72, 121, 1519, 215, 356 and 331 in this assay.<br>
Having regard to their inhibition of binding of CCR-3, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of conditions mediated by CCR-3, particularly inflammatory or allergic conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Accordingly, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases, resulting, for example, in reduction of tissue damage, bronchial hyperreactivity, remodelling or disease progression. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exerciser-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial or viral infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or<br><br>
intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilators. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), acute/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, COAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dispend associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croups, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular in relation to inhibition of eosinophil activation, agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of eosinophil related disorders, e.g. eosinophilia, in particular eosinophil related disorders of the airways (e.g. involving morbid eosinophilic infiltration of pulmonary tissues) including hypereosinophilia as it effects the airways and/or lungs as well as, for example, eosinophil-related disorders of the airways consequential or concomitant to Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic (in particular metazoan) infestation (including tropical eosinophilia), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa (including Churg-Strauss syndrome), eosinophilic granuloma and eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction.<br>
Agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin, for example psoriasis, contact dermatitis, atomic dermatitis, alopecia<br><br>
areata, erythema multiforma, dermatitis herpetiformis, scleroderma, vitiligo, hypersensitivity angiitis, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus, pemphisus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and other inflammatory or allergic conditions of the skin.<br>
Agents of the invention may also be used for the treatment of other diseases or conditions, in particular diseases or conditions having an inflammatory component, for example, treatment of diseases and conditions of the eye such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and vernal conjunctivitis, diseases affecting the nose including allergic rhinitis, e.g. atrophic, chronic, or seasonal rhinitis, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, for example inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, diseases of the bone and joints including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and systemic sclerosis, and other diseases such as athersclerosis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes (type I), myasthenia gravis, hyper IgE syndrome and acute and chronic allograft rejection, e.g. following transplantation of heart, kidney, liver, lung or bone marrow.<br>
The effectiveness of an agent of the invention in inhibiting inflammatory conditions, for example in inflammatory airways diseases, may be demonstrated in an animal model, e.g. a mouse or rat model, of airways inflammation or other inflammatory conditions, for example as described by Szarka et al, J. Immunol. Methods (1997) 202:49-57; Renzi et al. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. (1993) 148:932-939; Tsuyuki et al., J. Clin. Invest. (1995) 96:2924-2931; and Cernadas et al (1999) Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 20:1-8.<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in combination with other drug substances such as anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory or antihistamine drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such drugs. An agent of the invention may be mixed with the other drug substance in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the other drug substance. Such anti-inflammatory drugs include steroids, in particular glucocorticosteroids such as budesonide, beclamethasone, fluticasone, ciclesonide or mometasone, LTB4 antagonists such as those described in US5451700, LTD4 antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast, dopamine receptor agonists such as cabergoline, bromocriptine, ropinirole and 4-hydroxy-7-[2-[[2-[[3-(2-<br><br>

Such bronchodilatory drugs include anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, in particular ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide, and beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as salbutamol, terbutaline, salmeterol and, especially, formoterol and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and compounds (in free or salt or solvate form) of formula I of PCT International Publication No. WOOO/75114, which document is incorporated herein by reference, preferably compounds of the Examples thereof, especially a compound of formula<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Co-therapeutic antihistamine drug substances include cetirizine hydrochloride, acetaminophen, clemastine fumarate, promethazine, loratidine, desloratidine, diphenhydramine and fexofenadine hydrochloride. Combinations of agents of the invention and steroids, beta-2 agonists, PDE4 inhibitors or LTD4 antagonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of COPD or, particularly, asthma. Combinations of agents of the invention and anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, PDE4 inhibitors, dopamine receptor agonists or LTB4 antagonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of asthma or, particularly, COPD,<br>
Other useful combinations of agents of the invention with anti-inflammatory drugs are those with other anatagonists of chemokine receptors, e.g. CCR-1, CCR-2, CCR-3, CCR-4, CCR-5, CCR-6, CCR-7, CCR-8, CCR-9 and CCRIO, CXCRl, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, particularly CCR-5 antagonists such as Schering-Plough antagonists SC-351125, SCH-55700 and SCH-D, Takeda antagonists such as N-[[4-[[[6,7-dihydro-2-(4-methylphenyl)-5H-benzocyclohepten-8-yl]carbonyl]amino]phenyl]-methyl]tetrahydro-N,N-dimethyl-2H-pyran-4-aminium chloride (TAK-770), and CCR-5 antagonists described in<br><br>
US6166037 (particularly claims 18 and 19), WOOO/66558 (particularly claim 8), and WOOO/66559 (particularly claim 9).<br>
