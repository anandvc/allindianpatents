EXCESS NH3 STORAGE CONTROL<br>
FOR SCR CATALYSTS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001]     The present disclosure relates to exhaust treatment systems,<br>
and more particularly to an excess NH3 storage control for an exhaust treatment<br>
system including a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines combust an air and fuel mixture to<br>
generate drive torque. The combustion process generates exhaust that is<br>
exhausted from the engine to atmosphere. The exhaust contains nitrogen oxides<br>
(NOx), carbon dioxide (C02), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulates. NOx is a<br>
term used to describe exhaust gases that consist primarily of nitrogen oxide (NO)<br>
and nitrogen dioxide (N02). An exhaust after-treatment system treats the<br>
exhaust to reduce emissions prior to being released to atmosphere. In an<br>
exemplary exhaust after-treatment system, a dosing system injects a dosing<br>
agent (e.g., urea) into the exhaust upstream of a selective catalytic reduction<br>
(SCR) catalyst. The exhaust and dosing agent mixture reacts over the SCR<br>
catalyst to reduce the NOx levels released to atmosphere.<br>
[0004] The dosing agent reacts with NOx on the SCR catalyst to<br>
accomplish the NOx reduction. More specifically, the dosing agent breaks down<br>
1<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
to form ammonia (NH3), which is the reductant utilized to react with the NOx.<br>
The following exemplary, chemical relationships describe the NOx reduction:<br><br>
[0005] To perform the above-described NOx reduction, the SCR<br>
catalyst stores NH3 therein. For an SCR catalyst to perform effectively, the NH3<br>
storage level must be maintained at an adequate level. More specifically, the<br>
NOx reduction or conversion efficiency is dependent upon the NH3 storage level.<br>
In order to maintain high conversion efficiency under various operating<br>
conditions, the NH3 storage must be maintained. However, as the temperature<br>
of the SCR catalyst increases, the NH3 level must be reduced to avoid NH3 slip<br>
(i.e., excess NH3 being released from the SCR catalyst), which can reduce the<br>
conversion efficiency of the catalyst.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
regulating an amount of NH3 stored in a catalyst of an exhaust after-treatment<br>
system. The method includes determining a mass of NH3 into the catalyst based<br>
on a dosing rate of a dosing agent that is injected into an exhaust stream<br>
upstream of the catalyst and determining a mass of NH3 out of the catalyst (i.e.,<br>
consumed in the catalyst). An accumulated mass of NH3 within the catalyst is<br>
calculated based on the mass of NH3 into the catalyst and the mass of NH3 out<br>
2<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601 -PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
of the catalyst. The dosing rate is regulated based on the accumulated mass of<br>
NH3 within the catalyst.<br>
[0007] In one feature, the mass of NH3 out of the catalyst is<br>
determined based on signals generated by NOx sensors that are located<br>
upstream and downstream of the catalyst, respectively.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the method further includes determining a<br>
conversion efficiency of the catalyst based on a temperature of the catalyst. The<br>
mass of NH3 out of the catalyst is determined based on a base dosing rate (i.e.,<br>
stoichiometric) and the conversion efficiency.<br>
[0009] In still another feature, the method further includes monitoring a<br>
catalyst temperature and setting the accumulated mass of NH3 within the<br>
catalyst equal to zero when the catalyst temperature exceeds a threshold<br>
temperature. In this manner, the areas of operation, in which the catalyst does<br>
not have any storage potential, are accounted for.<br>
[0010] In yet other features, the method further includes defining a<br>
maximum NH3 storage mass of the catalyst based on a catalyst temperature.<br>
The dosing rate is regulated based on the maximum NH3 storage mass. An<br>
excess NH3 storage ratio is calculated based on the accumulated mass of NH3<br>
within the catalyst and the maximum NH3 storage mass, wherein the dosing rate<br>
is regulated based on the excess NH3 storage ratio. For example, an adjustment<br>
factor is determined based on the excess NH3 storage ratio, wherein the dosing<br>
rate is regulated based said adjustment factor. The dosing agent is regulated to<br>
maintain the excess NH3 storage ratio to be less than 1.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide<br>
the described functionality.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle system 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. The vehicle system 10 includes an engine system 12,<br>
an exhaust after-treatment system 14. The engine system 12 includes an engine<br>
16 having a cylinder 18, an intake manifold 20 and an exhaust manifold 22. Air<br>
flows into the intake manifold 20 through a throttle 24. The air is mixed with fuel<br>
and the air and fuel mixture is combusted within the cylinder 18 to drive a piston<br>
(not shown). Although a single cylinder 18 is illustrated, it is appreciated that the<br>
engine 12 may include additional cylinders 18. For example, engines having 2,<br>
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are anticipated. The fuel is provided from a<br>
fuel source 26 and is injected into the air stream using an injector 28. A fuel level<br>
5<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
sensor 30 is responsive to the amount of fuel within the fuel source 26. It is<br>
anticipated that the present disclosure can be implemented in both lean burn<br>
gasoline engines and diesel engines.<br>
[0022] Exhaust is produced through the combustion process and is<br>
exhausted from the cylinder 18 into the exhaust manifold 22. The exhaust after-<br>
treatment system 14 treats the exhaust flowing therethrough to reduce emissions<br>
before being released to the atmosphere. The exhaust after-treatment system<br>
14 includes a dosing system 32, a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 34, a NOx<br>
sensor 36, a NOx sensor 37 and a catalyst 38 that is preferably provided as a<br>
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst.<br>
[0023] The NOx sensor 36 is deemed the upstream NOx sensor and<br>
the NOx sensor 37 is deemed the downstream NOx sensor, relative to the<br>
catalyst 38. Both NOx sensors 36, 37 are responsive to a NOx level of the<br>
exhaust and generate respective signals based thereon. An upstream NOx<br>
mass flow rate (mN0XUS) is determined based on the signal generated by the NOx<br>
sensor 36.  Similarly, a downstream NOx mass flow rate {mN0XDS) is determined<br>
based on the signal generated by the NOx sensor 37.<br>
[0024] Temperature sensors TA, TB and Tc are located at various<br>
points along the emissions path. For example, the temperature sensor TA is<br>
located upstream of the DOC 34, the temperature sensor TB is located upstream<br>
of the catalyst 38 and the temperature sensor Tc is located downstream of the<br>
catalyst 38. The DOC 34 reacts with the exhaust to reduce emission levels of<br>
the exhaust.  It is also anticipated that a diesel particulate filter (DPF) 40 may be<br>
6<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
located downstream from the catalyst 30 that filters diesel particulates to further<br>
reduce emissions. It is anticipated that the order of the SCR catalyst and the<br>
DPF can be reversed.<br>
[0025] The dosing system 32 includes a dosing agent injector 42, a<br>
dosing agent storage tank 44 and a dosing agent supply sensor 46. The dosing<br>
system 32 selectively injects a dosing agent (e.g., urea) into the exhaust stream<br>
to further reduce emissions. More specifically, the rate at which the dosing agent<br>
is injected into the exhaust stream {mDA) is determined based on the signals<br>
generated by one or more of the various sensors described herein. The exhaust<br>
and dosing agent mixture reacts within the catalyst 38 to further reduce exhaust<br>
emissions.<br>
[0026] A control module 50 regulates flow of the dosing agent based<br>
on the excess NH3 storage control of the present disclosure. The excess NH3<br>
storage control keeps track of the mass of NH3 supplied into (mm3IN) and out of<br>
(mNH3our)tne catalyst 38. Furthermore, the excess NH3 storage control makes<br>
corrections based on where the calculated storage amount is with respect to a<br>
maximum NH3 storage capacity (mmiMAX) of the catalyst 38.<br>
[0027] mNH3IN is determined based the dosing agent or reductant (e.g.,<br>
urea) input mass flow rate (i.e., mDA). rhDA is known and is determined based on<br>
the signal generated by the upstream NOx sensor 36. mNH3IN is further<br>
determined based on the exhaust flow rate, which is calculated based on MAF, a<br>
known fuel flow rate and other constants.   mm30UT is the amount of NH3 that<br>
7<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
reacts with NOx within the catalyst 38 and is calculated based on the difference<br>
between mmxus, mNOWS and a time delta (dt). A set of constants is used to<br>
convert this difference to an NH3 mass out of the catalyst 38 {mNH30UT) (i.e., NH3<br>
consumed). The difference (Amm3) between mm3m and mm30m is provided as<br>
the mass of NH3 stored in the catalyst 38.<br>
[0028]     The stored NH3 (Amm3) is compared to mm3MAX, which is<br>
determined based on a temperature of the catalyst 38 (TCAT). mNH3IN is adjusted<br>
to keep AmNH3 at a desired fraction of mm3MAX. In one embodiment, a simple<br>
ratio 0EXCSNH3) is implemented. As another embodiment, a closed-loop control<br>
setpoint is provided as a fraction of mNH3MAX. In this manner, NH3 release from<br>
the catalyst 38 that results from thermal transients can be reduced.<br>
[0029] The mass flow rate of NH3 supplied into the catalyst 38 (mNH3IN)<br>
(e.g., provided in g/s) is calculated based on mDA, provided in g/hour, the<br>
concentration of the dosing agent (DACONC), the molecular weight of the dosing<br>
agent (DAMw) (e.g., 60.06 g/mol in the case of urea), the molecular weight of<br>
NH3 (NH3MW) (e.g., 17.031 g/mol) and the known decomposition factor of the<br>
dosing agent with respect to NH3 (koec)- DACONC is determined as the<br>
percentage of dosing agent to dosing agent solution (e.g., 32.5% indicates 0.325<br>
parts dosing agent to 1 part dosing agent solution). koEc is provided in mol NH3<br>
per mol dosing agent (e.g., in the case of urea, 1 mol of urea decomposes to 2<br>
moles of NH3; kDEc = 2). mNH3IN is calculated in accordance with the following<br>
relationship:<br>
8<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br><br><br><br>
where 3600 is a time conversion factor (k-riME) of seconds per hour.<br>
[0030]      mm30UT (e.g., provided in g/s) is the mass flow rate of NH3<br>
consumed in the catalyst 38 and is calculated based on rhN0XUS, provided in g/s,<br>
mN0XDS, provided in g/s, the molecular weight of the NOx (NOXMW) and NH3MW<br>
(e.g., 17.031 g/mol). NOxMw is variable, however, any NOXMW can be used (e.g.,<br>
N02 = 46.055 g/mol), because it cancels in the relationships described herein.<br>
™miour 's calculated in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br>
X varies from 1 to 1.333 depending on the upstream % of N02.   mNOXUS and<br>
mmxDS are calculated in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br>
where<br>
ff^EXH 's the mass flow rate of the exhaust and EXHMW is the molecular<br>
weight of the exhaust gas (e.g., provided in g of exhaust / mol of exhaust).<br>
[0031]     Both mNmm and mm30ur are multiplied by a time increment (dt)<br>
(e.g., 1 second) to provide mNHVN and mNHlom, respectively, which are provided<br>
in grams.   AmNH3 is determined as the difference between mNH1[N and mmJ0UT<br>
and is deemed the excess NH3 that is stored in the catalyst 38.   AmNr]3 (e.g., or<br>
mNH3iN and mNH3our before calculating Amm3) can be integrated to provide a<br>
9<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
cumulative value over time (&amp;mmiCUM)-    &amp;mNH3cuM is divided by mNHZMAX to<br>
provide JEXCSNH3.<br>
[0032] JEXCSNH3 is used as an input to a look-up table to look up an<br>
excess storage multiplier value (kExcssTORE), which is fed back to the control<br>
module 50 to trim mM. The look-up table is stored in memory and is calibrated<br>
in such a way to make the kExcssTORE equal to 1 at some desired storage ratio<br>
ODSR) of NH3STOREMAX- For example, if IEXCSNH3 is less than JDSR. kExcssTORE is set<br>
to be greater than 1 and vise versa. In one embodiment, this function is<br>
executed by a closed-loop control (e.g., a PID control module).<br>
[0033] It is preferable to control the JDSR to be sufficiently below 1 to<br>
avoid NH3 slip from occurring. In order to reduce accumulated errors, AmNmcuM<br>
is reset during high temperature catalyst operation where no significant NH3<br>
storage occurs (i.e., when TCAT is greater than a threshold temperature (TTHR))-<br>
The catalyst temperature (TCAT) is determined based on a temperature sensor<br>
signal (e.g., from one or more of the temperature sensors TA, TB, Tc and/or a<br>
temperature sensor integrated into the catalyst (not shown)). As TCAT increases<br>
NH3STOREMAX decreases, thereby raising the JEXCSNH3. This causes less dosing<br>
agent, and thus less NH3, to be dosed to the catalyst 38. By resetting ^mNHZCUM,<br>
NH3 release from the catalyst 38 is reduced.<br>
[0034] As mentioned above, NH3STOREMAX is the maximum possible<br>
NH3 stored at a given TCAT- Described below is a method of determining<br>
NH3STOREMAX- The catalyst 38, and exhaust after-treatment system for that<br>
matter, is stabilized to a constant temperature and the catalyst is purged of all<br>
10<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
stored NH3 (i.e., by providing no dosing agent, and thus no incoming NH3, to the<br>
catalyst). At this point, ^mm3CUM is reset to 0 g. At some time (to), the dosing<br>
agent, and thus NH3, supply is turned back on with an excess NH3 to NOx molar<br>
ratio. The conversion efficiency of the downstream NOx sensor 37 and the<br>
upstream NOx sensor 36 will stabilize at a maximum value and at some latter<br>
time (ti) will start decreasing (i.e., when the downstream NOx sensor 37 detects<br>
NH3). At this point, Amm3ClM is read to provide an approximate NH3STOREMAX<br>
value. The conversion efficiency is determined in accordance with the following<br>
relationship:<br><br>
[0035] Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps that are executed by<br>
the excess NH3 control will be described in detail. In step 200, control<br>
determines whether TCAT is greater than TJHR- If TCAT is greater than TTHR,<br>
control sets &amp;mm3CUM equal to zero in step 202 and loops back to step 200.  If<br>
TCAT is not greater than TTHR, control determines mm3IN in step 204. Control<br>
determines mm3Qm in step 206. In step 208, control calculates AmmiCUM. In<br>
step 210, control determines mm3MAX .<br>
[0036] Control calculates 1EXCSNH3 based on mNH3MAX and &amp;mNH3CUM in<br>
step 212. In step 214, control determines kExcssTORE based on JEXCSNH3- Control<br>
regulates mDA based on KEXCSSTORE in step 216 and control ends. It is<br>
anticipated, however, that the above-described, exemplary control will continue<br>
11<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-308601-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000442<br>
to loop through steps 200 to 216 at a pre-determined time interval or rate while<br>
the engine is running.<br>
[0037] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
excess NH3 control will be described in detail. The exemplary modules include a<br>
mNHim module 300, a mNH30UT module 302, a summer module 304, a dosing<br>
agent control module 306 and a comparator module 308.   The<br>
mNH3iN module<br>
300 determines mm3IN based on mDA, as described in detail above. The<br>
mNH3our module 302 determines mNm0UT based on mmxus and mN0XDS, as<br>
described in detail above and in further detail with respect to Figure 5A below.<br>
Alternatively, the mm30UT module 302 determines mm30UT based on rhDAaASE), as<br>
described in further detail with respect to Figure 5B below.    mDA(BASE) is the<br>
stoichiometric NH3 quantity.<br>
[0038]     The summer module 304 determines AmNH3 as the difference<br>
between mNH3BI and mm30UT. The dosing agent control module 306 monitors<br>
AfflW3C[/M and regulates mDA based thereon. The dosing agent control module<br>
306 also selectively resets Amffl3CW, as described in detail above, based on a<br>
signal from the comparator module 308. More specifically, the comparator<br>
module 308 compares TCAT to TTHR- If TCAT is greater than TTHR, the signal from<br>
the comparator module 308 indicates that AmNHXUU should be reset. If TCAT is<br>
not greater than TTHR, the signal from the comparator module 308 indicates that<br>
&amp;mNH3CUM should not be reset.<br>

TCAT and VCAT, as discussed above. The addition module 602 accumulates the<br>
AmNflJ values to provide &amp;mNH3CUM. If, however, the addition modules 412 and<br>
508, 526 of Figures 4 and 5A, 5B are included, the addition module 602 can be<br>
foregone because AmNH3CUM will be provided based on mmjJNC[JM and rnmwmcuM<br>
from the addition modules 412 and 508, 526. If the addition modules 412 and<br>
508, 526 are not provided, the addition module 602 is provided. The division<br>
module 604 determines JEXCSNH3 as a ratio between AmNH3CUM and mmiMAX . The<br>
kExcssTORE module 606 KEXCSSTORE determines kExcssTORE, as discussed in detail<br>
