				<td>The present invention relates to a brake system for a vehicle, which includes a first transmission system capable of transmitting an operating force of a first brake operating member to a first wheel brake, a second transmission system capable of transmitting an operating force of a second brake operating member to a second wheel brake, and an actuator interposed at intermediate portions of said first and second transmission systems for interlocking said first and second wheel brakes with each other and performing anti-lock brake control.<br>
(Related Art]<br>
Such a brake system for a vehicle has been already proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 7-118318, wherein an actuator including a pair of planetary gear mechanisms, a motor for driving a sun gear of one of the planetary gear mechanisms and an electromagnetic brake for braking a sun gear of the other planetary gear mechanism is interposed at intermediate portions of first and second transmission systems, thereby interlocking first and second wheel brakes with each other and performing anti-lock brake control.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above brake system, however, is disadvantageous in limiting compactness of the actuator because a first control shaft connecting the "irst planetary gear mechanism to the first transmission system and a second control shaft connecting the second planetary gear mechanism to<br>
the  second  transmission  system  are  disposed  on  different  axial  lines. Therefore, it has been expected to achieve compactness of the actuator.<br>

said second planetary gear mechanism being disposed coaxially with said first planetary gear mechanism; a motor reversely rotatable and connected to said first sun gear; a sun gear braking means capable of braking the rotation of said second sun gear; a first control member interposed at an intermediate portion of said first transmission system and connected to said first planetary carrier; a second control member interposed at an intermediate portion of said second transmission system and connected to said second planetary carrier; a first control shaft supporting said first control member and connected to said first wheel brake; and a second control shaft supporting said second control member and connected to said second wheel brake; said first and second control shafts being disposed coaxially with each other on an axial line parallel to the axial line of said first and second planetary gear mechanisms.<br>
In addition to the above configuration either of said wheel brakes of said first and second transmission system is a hydraulic brake operated by an oil pressure generated by a master cylinder, and said master cylinder is disposed in a direction crossing said first and second control shafts between rotational surfaces of said first and second control members.<br>
In addition a stopper is provided for restricting excessive retreat of said piston of said master cylinder when said motor and said sun gear braking means are operated to decrease a braking force of said wheel brake.<br>
In addition said piston is restricted by said stopper to be stopped at a position where a cup seal of said piston perfectly opens a relief port.<br>
In addition the brake system further includes an adjusting means for adjusting the stopping position of said piston restricted by said stopper.<br>
In addition a lost motion means is interposed between said control shaft and said control means in either of said first and second transmission<br>
systems.<br>
In addition to each of said first and second ring gears are formed of the same member.<br>

Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, a scooter type motorcycle V including a swing type power unit P has a front wheel WF and a rear wheel WR. The front wheel WF mounts a front wheel brake BF, as a first wheel brake, which is a disk brake operated based on an applied liquid pressure while the rear wheel WR mounts a known mechanical rear wheel brake BR, as a second wheel brake, exhibiting a braking force based on an operated amount of an operating lever 1.  A steering handle has at the right and left ends grips 2R, 2F.  A first brake lever 3F as a first brake operating member which is operable by a right hand holding the grip 2F is rotatably supported at the right end portion of the steering handle, while a second brake lever 3R as a second brake operating member which is operable by a left hand holding the grip 2R is rotatably supported at the left end portion of the steering handle.<br>
[0015]<br>
The first brake lever 3F is connected to the front wheel brake BF through a first transmission system 4F capable of transmitting an operating force of the first brake lever 3F to the front wheel brake BF, while the second brake lever 3R is connected to the operating lever 1 of the rear wheel brake BR through a second transmission system 4R capable of mechanically transmitting an operating force of the second brake lever 3R to the rear wheel brake BR.  Respective intermediate portions of the transmission systems 4F, 4R are connected to an actuator 5 and respective braking forces of the front wheel brake BF and the rear wheel brake BR can be adjusted by the operation of the actuator 5. [0016]<br>
A first cable dumper 24I is interposed between the first brake lever 3F and a first push-pull cable 25x connecting the first brake lever 3F to the actuator 5 while a second cable dumper 242 is interposed between the second brake lever 3R and a second push-pull cable 252 connecting the second brake lever 3R to the actuator 5.  These cable dumpers 24a, 242 are respectively disposed on the right and left sides of a down-tube of a body frame.  A battery 53 is<br>
disposed over the first cable dumper 24j on the right side while an electronic control unit 52 is disposed over the second cable dumper 242 on the left side. [0017]<br>
In Figs. 1, 2, reference numeral 56 indicates a reservoir of a master cylinder 6 (described later) provided on the actuator 5; 57 is an air bleeder joint which is provided at the upper end of a piping 27 connecting the master cylinder 26 (see Fig. 3) to the front wheel brake BF; 45 is a third push-pull cable connecting the actuator 5 to the rear wheel brake %; and 58 is a fuel tank. [0018]<br>
The structure of the first cable dumper 24a will be described below with reference to Fig. 4. [0019]<br>
The first push-pull cable 251 includes an outer cable 29} connected to the first brake lever 3F, an outer cable 2911 connected to the actuator 5, and an inner cable 30} raovably inserted in the outer cables 29ir 29a'.  The first cable dumper 242 includes a cylindrical dumper casing 31 connected to the body frame; a cylindrical movable member 32 inserted in the dumper casing 31 relatively movably in the axial direction; a cylindrical fixed member<br><br>
33, fixed in the dumper casing 31, through which the movable member 32 is relatively slid; a sliding member 34 inserted in the dumper casing 31 relatively movably in the axial direction and having a flange 34a which is to be brought in contact with a flange 32a of the movable member 32; and two springs 35, 35 provided to be contracted between the flange 32a of the movable member 32 and a flange 33a of the fixed member 33. [0020]<br>
The flange 33a of the fixed member 33 is fixed with the end portion of the outer cable 29i while the flange 32a of the movable member 32 is fixed with the end portion of the outer cable 29a'.  Accordingly, both the springs 35, 35 exhibit spring forces acting in the direction where the outer cables 29ir 29i' are separated from each other. [0021]<br>
A first load detecting switch 38!, which is to be brought in contact with one end of the movable member 32 projecting from one end of the dumper casing 31, is fixed on one end side of the dumper casing 31.  In a state in which a brake operating input from the first brake lever 3F is in a specified load range, that is, when the movable member 32 is moved to compress the springs 35, 35 in<br>
accordance with the traction of the first push-pull cable 25;., the first load detecting switch 38a is turned on in the specified range of the stroke. [0022]<br>
More specifically, when an operating force of the first brake lever 3F increases over a specified value, that is, a load applied to pull the inner cable 30^ in the direction of an arrow A increases over a specified value, the movable member 32 is slid toward the fixed member 33 while compressing the springs 35, 35 by a load applied to render close the outer cables 29l7 29^' to each other. As a result, the movable member 32 causes a detecting piece of the first load detecting switch 38a to be operated for turning on the first load detecting switch 38i. [0023]<br>
The second cable dumper 242 basically has the same configuration as that of the first cable dumper 241 as shown in Fig. 5, and therefore, parts of the second cable dumper 242 corresponding to those of the first cable dumper<br>
14i	are indicated by the same characters and the detailed<br>
explanation thereof is omitted.  The second cable dumper<br>
242	is different from the first cable dumper 24} in that<br>
two disk springs 36, 36 are disposed between the flange 34a<br>
of the sliding member 34 and the flange 32a of the movable<br>
member 32.<br>
[0024]<br>
In a state in which a load applied by the second brake lever 3R to pull the inner cable 302 of the second push-pull cable 252 in the direction of an arrow A in Fig. 5 is in a specified range, a second load detecting switch 382 is turned on.  In addition, since the disk springs 36, 36 being low in spring constant impart a load to the second load detecting switch 382, a change in load when the input stroke is small can be increased.  This makes it possible to relatively lower a load loss on the basis of the case of using no cable dumper and hence to make smaller an unavailable stroke for preventing generation of a feeling of incompatibility in brake operation. [0025;<br>
The structure of the actuator 5 will be described below with reference to Figs. 6 to 10. [0026]<br>
The actuator 5 includes a first planetary gear mechanism 6l7 a second planetary gear mechanism 62, an electromagnetic brake 7 as a sun gear braking means, and a motor 8 rotatable in normal and reverse directions.<br>
[0027]<br>
A casing 9 of the actuator 5 includes a first case member 10 mounting the motor 8, and a second case member 11 connected to the first case member 10 and mounting the electromagnetic brake 7 on the same axial line as the rotational axial line of the motor 8. A rotational shaft 7 a of the electromagnetic brake 7 and a rotational shaft 8a of the motor 8 are disposed on the same axis and they are brought at the end portions thereof in contact with each other. [0028]<br>
The first planetary gear mechanism 6a, which is disposed around the outer periphery of the rotational shaft 8a of the motor 8, includes a first ring gear 16x surrounding the outer periphery of the end portion of the rotational shaft 8a of the motor 8, a first sun gear 171 formed at the end portion of the rotational shaft 8a of the motor 8, a plurality of first planetary gears 18! meshing with the first ring gear 16i and the first sun gear I7le and a first planetary carrier 19! rotatably supporting the first planetary gears 18i-  The drive of the motor 8 allows the first sun gear 17a of the first planetary gear mechanism 61 to be rotated.<br>
[0029]<br>
The second planetary gear mechanism 62 includes a second ring gear 16Z surrounding the outer periphery of the end portion of the rotational shaft 7a of the electromagnetic brake 7, a second sun gear 172 formed at the end portion of the rotational shaft 7a of the electromagnetic brake 7, a plurality of second planetary gears 182 meshing with the second ring gear 162 and the second sun gear 172/ and a second planetary carrier 192 rotatably supporting the second planetary gears 182.  The electromagnetic brake 7 is adapted to brake and stop the rotation of the second sun gear 172 of the second planetary gear mechanism 62. [0030]<br>
The first ring gear 163. and the second ring gear 162 are formed of the same member, and are relatively rotabaly held between the first planetary carrier 19i and the second planetary carrier 192 in a state being radially positioned by the first planetary gears 18i and the second planetary gears 182.  Since the first and second ring gears 16i and 162 are formed of the same member, it becomes possible to reduce the number of parts and to make small the size of the actuator 5.<br>
[0031]<br>
A first control shaft 20a and the second control shaft 202 are disposed in front of and in parallel to the rotational shaft 7a of the electromagnetic brake 7 and the rotational shaft 8a of the motor 8. A cylindrical portion is formed at the inner end of the first control shaft 20a, and the outer periphery of the inner end of the second control shaft 202 is relatively rotatably fitted in the inner periphery of the cylindrical portion of the first control shaft 20!, so that the first control shaft 20! and the second control shaft 202 are disposed coaxially on the common axil line in parallel to the axial line of the first and second planetary gear mechanism 6lf 62. [0032]<br>
As is seen from Figs. 7 and 9, a first sector gear 48i as a first control member is fixed on the first control shaft 20i and it meshes with a driven gear 49i integrated with the first planetary carrier 19i-  A piston knocker 43 for operating the master cylinder 26 (described later) is fixed on the first control shaft 20i-[0033]<br>
The master cylinder 26 includes a cylinder body 39 fixed to the casing 9 of the actuator 5, a piston 40<br>
slidably fitted in the cylinder body 39 with its front surface facing a pressure chamber 41, and a return spring 42 contained in the pressure chamber 41 and having a spring force biasing the piston 40 rearward (on right side in Fig. 9).  The piping 27 communicated to the pressure chamber 41 is connected to the front end of the cylinder body 39. [0034]<br>
The piston knocker 43 is to be brought in contact with the rear end portion, projecting from the rear end of the cylinder body 39, of the piston 40.  When the first sector gear 48j is located at a position shown by a solid line in Fig. 9, a cup seal 44 provided on the piston 40 is located at a position where a relief port 39a formed in the cylinder body 39 is opened.  The first sector gear 48} is slightly turnable counterclockwise (in the direction where the piston 40 is retreated) from the position shown by the solid line to a position shown by a chain line and it is brought in contact with a stopper lOa at the position shown by the chain line to be thus restricted in turning.  The turning angle of the first sector gear 48! between the positions shown by the solid line and the chain line is set in consideration of variations in position of the relief port 39a and machining accuracy of each gear.  More<br><br>
specifically, the turning angle of the first sector gear 49X is set so that when the first sector gear 48! is brought in contact with the stopper lOa and thereby the piston 40 reaches the retreat end, the cup seal 44 of the piston 40 certainly opens the relief port 39a and is also prevented from being retreated from the relief port 39a so much. [0035]<br>
Thus, when the first control shaft 20i presses the piston 40 by the piston knocker 43, the piston 40 is operated on the side where the capacity of the pressure 41 is contracted so that a liquid pressure generated in the pressure chamber 41 is applied to the front when brake BF through the piping 27. [0036 j<br>
As described above, since the first and second control shafts 20a, 202 are disposed coaxially on the same axial line in parallel to the axial line of the first and second planetary gear mechanisms 6lf 62, the actuator 5 can be made compact as compared with the case where the control shafts 20!, 202 are respectively disposed on different axial lines.  Moreover, since the master cylinder 26 crossing the first and second control shafts 20!, 202 is<br>
disposed between the rotational surface of the first sector gear 4 81 supported by the first control shaft 20X and the rotational surface of the second sector gear 482 supported by the second control shaft 202, it can be made compact in layout by making full use of the dead space in the actuator 5. [0037]<br>
Figs. 6, 11, 12 show a connecting portion between the first push-pull cable 25! connected to the first brake lever 3F and the first control shaft 20! extending outward from the first case member 10.  An upper arm 62 and a lower arm 63 are welded around a collar 61 relatively rotatably fitted around the outer periphery of the first control shaft 20i, and an adjust arm 64 is fixed by means of a bolt 65 around the outer periphery of the first control shaft 20!-  The first push-pull cable 25a is connected to the leading end of the upper arm 62 through a cable joint 66. [0038]<br>
An adjust bolt 68 pivotably supported by means of a pin 67 on the leading end of the lower arm 63 passes through a pin 69 supported on an intermediate portion of the adjust arm 64 and is screwed at its leading end with an adjust nut 70.  A coil spring 71 fitted around the outer<br>
periphery of the adjust bolt 68 biases the pin 69 so that the pin 69 is brought, in contact with a circular-arc surface 70a formed at the leading end of the adjust nut 70. [0039]<br>
The lower arm 63 integrated with the upper arm 62 is thus connected to the adjust arm 64 through the adjust bolt 68, and accordingly, when the upper arm 62 is turned by the first push-pull cable 25lf the first control shaft 20! is rotated through the lower arm 63, the adjust bolt 68 and the adjust arm 64.  The phase of the first control shaft 20a can be thus freely and finely controlled by rotating the adjust bolt 70, half rotation at a time, for changing the relative angle between the lower arm 63 and the adjust arm 64.  As a result, the piston knocker 43 provided on the first control shaft 20i can be finely adjusted to a position shown by the solid line in Fig. 9. The adjust bolt 68 and the adjust nut 70 constitutes an adjusting means. [0040]<br>
As is seen from Figs. 7, 10, a second sector gear 482 as a second control member is relatively rotatably supported on the second control shaft 202, and it meshes with a driven gear 492 provided integrally with the second<br>
planetary carrier 192. A locking portion 50a formed at the leading end of a control arm 50 fixed on the second control shaft 202 is fitted in a slot 48a formed in the second sector gear 482.  These locking portion 50a and the slot 48a constitute a lost motion mechanism.  In Fig. 10, a stopper lla capable of being brought in contact with the second sector gear 482 is formed on the second case member 11 for restricting the clockwise turning end of the second sector gear 482.

Figs. 6, 13, 14 show a connecting portion between the second push-pull cable 252 connected to the second brake lever 3R and the second control shaft 202 extending outward from the second case member 11.  A pair of cable joints 75, 76 are pivotably supported by means of a pin 74 to an arm 73 fixed on the second control shaft 202 by means of a bolt 72.  An inner cable 302 of the second push-pull cable 252 composed of an outer cable 292' and the inner cable 302 is connected to the cable joint 75 while a third inner cable 47 of the third push-pull cable 45 composed of an inner cable 46 and the outer cable 47 is connected to the cable joint 76.<br>
[0042]<br>
Accordingly, the first transmission system 4F for transmitting an operating force of the first brake lever 3F to the front wheel brake BF is composed of the first push-pull cable 25i interposed with the first cable dumper 24a/ the master cylinder 26 and the piping 27 while the second transmission system 4R for transmitting an operating force of the second brake lever 3R to the rear wheel brake BR is composed of the second push-pull cable 252 interposed with the second cable dumper 242 and the third push-pull cable 45. [0043]<br>
An angle sensor 51 for detecting an operated amount of the actuator 5 is fixed at the outer end, extending outward from the actuator 5, of the second control shaft 202.  As shown in Fig. 3, a front wheel speed sensor 54 is mounted on the front wheel WF while a rear wheel speed sensor 55 is mounted on the rear wheel WR.  The on/off operation of the electromagnetic brake 7 of the actuator 5, and the rotational direction and the operated amount of the motor 8 are controlled by the electronic control unit 52. The electronic control unit 52 receives detection values supplied from the first and second load detecting switches<br>
38i, 382, the angle sensor 51, the front wheel speed sensor<br>
54, and the rear wheel speed sensor 55.<br>
[0044]<br>
The function of the embodiment of the present<br>
invention having the above configuration will be described below.<br>
[0045]<br>
In a state in which a brake operating input by the first brake lever 3F or the second brake lever 3R is a specified value or less, the actuator 5 is not activated, and the front wheel brake BF or the rear wheel brake BR exhibits a braking force through the first brake lever 3F or the second brake lever 3R.  When the first and second load detecting switches 38i, 382 are not operated, the electronic control unit 52 is operated to stop the motor 8 and also the electromagnetic brake 7 is turned off, that is, the second sun gear 172 is allowed to be freely rotated. [0046]<br>
When only the first brake lever 3F is braked in such a state, the master cylinder 26 outputs a liquid pressure by turning of the first control shaft 20i accompanied by traction of the first push-pull cable 25^<br>
and the front wheel brake BF receives the liquid pressure through the piping 27 to exhibit a braking force. At this time, a turning force inputted into the first control shaft 20a is transmitted from the first sector gear 48a to the first planetary carrier 19: through the driven gear 49a. [0047]<br>
However, the first sun gear 17X is stopped because the motor 8 is stopped and the second brake lever 3R is in the non-brake operating state, and thereby the second planetary carrier 192 of the second planetary gear mechanism 62 is also stopped.  The rotation of the first planetary carrier 19i is thus transmitted to the second sun gear 172 through the first planetary gears 18a and the first and second ring gears 16lr 162, so that the second sun gear 172 idles.  Accordingly, the rear wheel brake BR is not operated by operation of the first brake lever 3F unless the motor 8 and the electromagnetic brake 7 are operated. [0048]<br>
When only the second brake lever 3R is operated for braking in a state in which the motor 8 and the electromagnetic brake 7 are not operated, the rear wheel brake BR exhibits a braking force by mechanical<br>
transmission of a brake operating force by means of the second transmission system 4R. At this time, even when the second control shaft 202 is turned by traction of the second push-pull cable 252, the first and second ring gears 16i, 162 are fixed through the first planetary gears 18! because the motor 8 is stopped, that is, the first sun gear 1?! is stopped and the first brake lever 3F is in the non-brake operating state.  Accordingly, the rotation of the second planetary carrier 192 is transmitted to the second sun gear 172 through the second planetary gears 182, so that second sun gear 172 idles.  As a result, the front wheel brake BF is not operated by operation of the second brake lever 3R unless the motor 8 and the electromagnetic brake 7 are operated. [0049]<br>
When a brake operating input by the first brake lever 3F or the second brake lever 3R is more than a specified value, the actuator 5 is activated to operate the front wheel brake BF and the rear wheel brake BR in a interlocking manner.  Accordingly, when the second load detecting switches 38!, 382 are switched, the motor 8 is operated by the electronic control unit 52 and also the electromagnetic brake 7 is turned on, that is, the second<br>
un gear 172 is braked. [0050]<br>
Here, assuming that the second brake lever 3R is operated for braking by an operating force more than the specified value, when the motor 8 is rotated in a state in which the second sun gear 172 is braked by the electromagnetic brake 7 as shown in Fig. 15, the first planetary carrier 193. and the second planetary carrier 192 are relatively reversely rotated and the second sector gear 482 is driven counterclockwise in Fig. 15 by the driven gear 492 integrated with the second planetary carrier 192. However, since the second sector gear 482 is restricted in rotation by contact with the stopper lla, the first sector gear 483 is rotated counterclockwise in Fig. 15 through the first driven gear 49i by the first planetary carrier 19i rotated by the reaction force of the second sector gear 482.  As a result, the master cylinder 26 is operated to generate a braking oil pressure, thus operating the front wheel brake BF by the braking oil pressure. [0051]<br>
At this time, since the locking portion 50a of the control arm 50 is freely fitted in the slot 48a of the second sector gear 482, the rotation of the second sector<br>
gear 482 by operation of the actuator 5 does not exert any effect on rotation of the second control shaft 202 based on operation of the second brake lever 3R.  Thus, the operation of the actuator 5 is controlled on the basis of the output of the angle sensor 51 for detecting a rotational angle of the second control shaft 202 during interlocking operation of the front wheel brake BF and the rear wheel brake BR. [0052]<br>
This will be more fully described with reference to Fig. 17.  When the second brake lever 3R is operated, the rear wheel brake BR is first operated through the second push-pull cable 252 and the third push-pull cable 45, to raise a braking force of the rear wheel WR.  When the operating load for the second brake lever 3R increases and the second load detecting switch 382 of the second cable dumper 242 is turned on, the actuator 5 is activated to operate the front wheel brake BF.  As a result, the distribution of the braking force is bent along an ideal distribution line. [0053]<br>
At this time, assuming that the lost motion mechanism composed of the locking portion 50a of the<br>
control arm 50 and the slot 48a of the second sector gear 482 is not present, a braking force of the rear wheel WR after operation of the actuator 5 is equal to the total of a force inputted from the second brake lever 3R by a rider and an increment (shown by a slant line in Fig. 17) by operation of the actuator 5.  Namely, the braking force of the rear wheel WR becomes excessively large as shown by a broken line in Fig. 7 and becomes largely out of the ideal distribution line, so that the tendency toward locking of the rear wheel WR is possibly increased.  However, since the braking force of the rear wheel WR is really only the force inputted by the rider, a braking force distribution characteristic close to the ideal distribution line can be easily obtained and also an improved brake feeding can be obtained by suitably setting an operated amount of the actuator 5 and adjusting a braking force of the front wheel WF. [0054J<br>
Next, an anti-lock brake control will be described. [0055]<br>
When the front wheel speed sensor 54 and the rear wheel speed sensor 55 detect the tendency toward locking of the wheels on the basis of the output, the electronic<br>
control unit 52 allows the electromagnetic brake 7 to be turned on and it also allows the motor 8 to be operated in the direction reversed to the case of the above-described interlocking operation.  Thus, as shown in Fig. 16, the first planetary carrier 19a and the second planetary carrier 192 are rotated in the directions reversed to each other and also reversed to those of the case of the above-described interlocking operation, so that the first sector gear 48a is driven clockwise in Fig. 16 while the second sector gear 482 is drive counterclockwise in Fig. 16.  At thxs time, the rotation of the first sector gear 48j is directly transmitted to the first control shaft 20a and thereby the first control shaft 20l is rotated in the direction of weakening the braking force of the front wheel WF while the rotation of the second sector gear 482 is transmitted to the second control shaft 202 by contact of the locking portion 50a of the control arm 50 with the end portion of the slot 48a and thereby the second control shaft 202 is rotated in the direction of weakening the braking force of the rear wheel WR. [0056]<br>
Accordingly, an anti-lock brake control for effectively avoiding the locking of each wheel can be<br><br>
performed by repeating on-off operation of the actuator 5<br>
on the basis of the slip ratio of each wheel.<br>
[0057]<br>
Moreover, in the first and second transmission systems 4F, 4R, the first and second cable dumpers 24lr 242 are interposed respectively between the actuator 5 and the first and second brake levers 3F, 3R, so that repulsive forces stored in the cable dumpers 24i, 242 can be used by making inoperative the motor 8 upon restep-up of the braking force in the anti-lock brake control, and further a preferable operating feeling can be obtained by avoiding a force from being applied from the actuator 5 side to the first brake lever 3F or the second brake lever 3R during the anti-lock brake control. [0058]<br>
Incidentally, the actuator 5 in this embodiment exhibits the following effects by provision of the stopper lOa (see Fig. 9) for restricting a turning range of the first sector gear 48J connected to the master cylinder 26. [0059]<br>
Referring to Fig. 18, for example, when a speed of the front wheel WF becomes lower than a specified value, an anti-lock brake control is started.  Specifically, the<br>
rotational angle of the first sector gear 48! is decreased in the direction of releasing the braking force of the front wheel WF is correspondingly decreased.  With the decrease in rotational angle of the first sector gear 48], the piston 40 of the master cylinder 26 is retreated following the piston knocker 43, and as shown in Fig. 9, the first sector gear 48! is brought in contact with the stopper lOa to be restricted in its rotation directly after the cup seal 44 opens the relief port 39a. [0060]<br>
At this time, assuming that the stopper lOa is not present, as shown by a broken line in Fig. 18, the first sector gear 48a is further turned to largely increase a lever reaction force of the first brake lever 3F, lowering a lever feeling.  Moreover, when the actuator 5 is activated to turn the first sector gear 48X in the direction of increasing the braking force, the cup seal 44 of the piston 40 closes the relief port 39a to retard a timing with which a braking oil pressure is generated in the pressure chamber 41, lowering the responsiveness. [0061J<br>
In this embodiment, however, the turning of the first sector gear 48! in the direction of retreating the<br>
piston 40 is restricted by the stopper lOa, and accordingly, when the first sector gear 48x is driven accompanied by operation of the actuator 5 for increasing the braking force again, the lowering of the responsiveness can be avoided by speedily advancing the piston 40 for generating a braking oil pressure. [0062]<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that various changes in design may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. [0063]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention described in claim 1, said first and second control shafts are disposed coaxially with each other on an axial line parallel to the axial line of said first and second planetary gear mechanisms.  This is advantageous in making compact the actuator 5 as compared with the case where the first and second control shafts are disposed on different axial lines.<br>
[0064]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, either of said wheel brakes of said first and second transmission system is a hydraulic brake operated by an oil pressure generated by a master cylinder, and said master cylinder is disposed in a direction crossing said first and second control shafts between rotational surfaces of said first and second control members.  This is advantageous in making compact the layout of the master cylinder by making full use of a dead space of the actuator. [0065]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, a stopper is provided for restricting excessive retreat of said piston of said master cylinder when said motor and said sun gear braking means are operated to decrease a braking force of said wheel brake.  This is advantageous in avoiding the lowering of a brake feeling by reducing a reaction force transmitted to a brake operating member and also improving responsiveness by reducing a time lag upon increasing a braking force of wheel brakes. [0066]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, said piston is restricted by said stopper to be stopped at<br>
a position where a cup seal of said piston perfectly opens a relief port.  This is ad\Tantageous in exhibiting the function of the master cylinder over the entire stroke of the piston. [0067]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 5, the brake system further includes an adjusting means for adjusting the stopping position of said piston restricted by said stopper.  This is advantageous in easily adjusting the stopping position of the piston. [0068]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 6, a lost motion means is interposed between said control shaft and said control means in either of said first and second transmission systems.  Accordingly, when the wheel brakes of the first and second transmission systems are interlocked with each other by operating the motor and the sun gear braking means through operation of the brake operating member of one transmission system, a braking force of the wheel brake of one transmission system is determined on the basis of only the operating force of the brake operating member of the one transmission system. This is advantageous in increasing the degree of freedom in<br><br>
setting of a braking force distribution characteristic of the wheel brakes of the first and second transmission systems. [0069]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 7, each of said first and second ring gears are formed of the same member.  This is advantageous in reducing the number of parts and in making compact the first and second planetary gear mechanisms. —<br>
