A multipurpose heavy duty wet grinder, the said grinder is being tiltably mounted on a stand (1), cylindrical roller (37) and flat stone (30) arrangement for grinding which is effected by differential speed obtained between inner edge and outer edge of the rollers resulting in creation of effective rubbing motion, a detachable drum (4) assembly and roller assembly (37), for detaching the said drum assembly and roller assembly from the drive shaft of the Gearbox (3) to facilitate easy cleaning of drum and roller, a tilting arrangement (13) for drum assembly for discharging the batter and a tilt lock system (44) incorporated for locking the grinder at vertical position and 90° tilt position to 120° Horizontal position to the vertical line for batter discharge.<br>
This invention; In general relates to a novel wet grinder. In particular this invention relates to a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder.<br>
There are varieties of wet grinders known in the art. These prior art wet grinders are of low duty type and mainly used for household purposes. This invention is meant for commercial purposes such as hotels, restaurants, College mess, factory canteens, marriage halls etc:<br>
A heavy duty wet grinder as is commonly known in the art consist of cavity in the base stone and a pestle. This pestle is placed in the base stone pit and is fastened to the post by means of chain/rope, through which lateral force is given to the pestle. When the drive is given to the base stone, it rotates and the pestle picks up the speed due to the friction created in between them by the surface contact. When the rice or similar substances are put into the grinder, it is passed through the base stone cavity and the roller. Here it is crushed in between due to the lateral load in the roller stone. This load is given by tightening the chain/rope linked to the post in the grinder. Continuous rotation of roller stone will cause the batter to form.<br><br>
In this type of commercial grinder, which are known in the art, have inherent problem and the following factors affect the performance of the grinder. The first factor i.e. inefficient method of pestle and cavity arrangement i.e., in the substances meant for grinding are escaped through the outer area due to large area available in the flat portion and small gap provided in the cavity and pestle, where it matches. It consumes lot of the time to crush the substance to the required consistency. This is the second factor viz. "Loss of surface contact between the surfaces of pestle and base stone cavity". When the substance enters in between the base stone cavity and the pestle, small gap is created in between as a layer, the stones are separated temporarily resulting in loss of surface contact and friction, thereby pestle speed reduces and grinding time increases. Consequently the power consumption also increases by this arrangement. Third factor is that there is no differential speed is created in between base stone and pestle, which creates the rubbing motion. This is essential for grinding. Due to absence of this rubbing motion in the present commercial grinders, the grinding process becomes inefficient and time consuming.<br>
In normal commercial grinders, the substances to be ground are discharged manually using hands. We have to lift huge pestle outside so as to clean and wash. Careful handling is required to place the pestle into the grinder and this entire process is labour oriented.<br>
In a nutshell, the prior art commercial grinders are having the disadvantages to the end users.<br><br>
1.	Inefficient grinding method, where the substances to be ground are escaped outside the drum cavity and because of absence of rubbing motion it consumes lot of time to grind to the required consistency.<br>
2.	Batter discharge is manual.<br>
3.	Cleaning is cumbersome due to heavy weight of pestle.<br>
4.	Handling the grinder is difficult. To clean the pestle, it has to be lifted outside the grinder for thorough cleaning.<br>
5.	Prior art grinders occupies more space.<br>
6.	They consume additional power because of poor efficiency.<br>
7.	When capacity of the grinder increases, still more problems has to be handled because of size.<br>
The invention is addressed to the problems associated with prior art grinders. This invented novel machine is completely redesigned with respect to known machines such that the technical problems associated with the prior art machine are overcome. Further the invented machine has several additional features such that the machine has been made versatile.<br>
Accordingly this novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder has a efficient grinding mechanism, a detachable drum system and a tilting arrangement of drum assembly for discharging the batter. Apart from the above, a unique tilt lock system is incorporated for easy tilting of the grinder and to lock the drum assembly in vertical position. A lid is provided to cover the drum to avoid dust to fall into the batter.<br>
Incorporation of the above systems in the commercial grinder will be the salient features of the grinder with respect to the presently available commercial grinders. Accordingly it is the primary object of the invention to invent a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder which is versatile by having additional features so as to execute different process apart from grinding.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder which has a novel tilting arrangement by which the material can be taken out of the grinder in a most efficient manner.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel multipurpose heavy duty wet grinder which has a tilt lock system by which the tilting angle can be varied at will.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder which has a detachable drum and roller system by which the equipment can be thoroughly cleaned after use.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder which has provision for optional attachments such as coconut scrapper, atta kneader, vegetable cutter, meat mincer and sevai maker.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel multi purpose heavy duty wet grinder which is compact design and efficient in use.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.<br><br>
A multipurpose heavy duty wet grinder, the said grinder is being tiltably mounted on a stand (1), cylindrical roller (37) and flat stone (30) arrangement for grinding which is effected by differential speed obtained between inner edge and outer edge of the rollers resulting in creation of effective rubbing motion, a detachable drum (4) assembly and roller assembly (37), for detaching the said drum assembly and roller assembly from the drive shaft of the Gearbox (3) to facilitate easy cleaning of drum and roller, a tilting arrangement (13) for drum assembly for discharging the batter and a tilt lock system (44) incorporated for locking the grinder at vertical position and 90° tilt position to 120° Horizontal position to the vertical line for batter discharge.<br>
Now the invention will be described in detail with respect to the drawing accompanying the specification wherein.<br>

Fig (8) shows the sectional Top view of cylinder roller assembly with drum<br>
Fig (9) shows in reference points of cylinder roller and flat stone arrangement used in the grinder.<br>
Now referring to the drawings accompanying in this specification, the present invention provides the grinder comprising a rotatable drum (4) encompassing a flat stone (30) and is driven by a prime mover/motor (2) through a gear box (3) connected by means of belt or chain drive. On the flat stone two cylindrical roller (37) stones are rotatably mounted on the roller rod (39) at a distance away from the centre and about 180 degree apart from each other. The roller rod (39) which is holding the cylindrical rollers (37) are fixed in the pipe housing (33) having a push rod (32) at the top. This unit is called roller assembly. This roller assembly is locked in place by the swing arm (15) provided in the tilt frame (13). This roller assembly in spring (36) loaded to give the pressure in between rollers and flat stone.<br>
In order to make the grinder compact, the motor and gearbox is mounted in the tilt frame one over the other vertically rather than horizontal in the present available grinders. This motor and gearbox is connected by means of belt or chain with suitable pulley (9) or sprocket. The drive ratio will be selected according to the requirements. The gear box (3) mounted on the top bed (25) of the tilt frame (13) will be projecting 'D' section output shaft (23) (made up of stainless steel) having drive shaft spacer (24) inserted for better seating of drum assembly (4). The drum<br><br>
assembly (4) consist of a flat stone encompassing a stainless steel drum and having a adapter (29) fastened with nut (31) at the centre axis of the drum. This adapter (29) having corresponding female 'D' section of drive shaft (23) and placed over the gear box output shaft for getting the drive.<br>
The roller assembly (37) which has been explained above, is having a spring (36) placed inside the pipe housing (33) and is fixed through a push rod (32) via a centre pin (34). Bottom portion of the pipe housing is guided through the adapter of the drum for location purpose and this bottom hole of this pipe housing is plugged to avoid the batter to enter into. The whole roller assembly (37) kept in the drum is located through the adapter (29) (made up of stainless steel) is pressed downwards by the swing arm (15) which is having a centre lock (42) with female slot to lock male member of push rod (32) of roller assembly. This downward motion of swing arm (15) press the spring to the desired length and this vertical load is directly transferred to the roller stone to the flat stone via pipe housing and roller rod (39).<br>
The four important sub assemblies i.e. motor, gearbox assembly, drum assembly and roller assemblies are stacked one over other in a manner to reduce the space occupied horizontally. The two sub assemblies i.e. Motor and Gear box is mounted on two beds (25) by bolts and are fastened to the two vertical channels/ rectangular sections (13) having a swing arm pivoted at the top. This swing arm is having a latch (17) at the other end to lock in position through a pin (16) at the lefthand side of the channel (13). This box type channel frame (13) is hinged at the centre portion by means of two pivot shafts (10) on either side are placed in the bearing housing (11) which are mounted on the outer side frame (1). The pivot shaft (10) will be welded to the tilt frame (13) in such away that, the whole assembly is in<br><br>
alanced position to facilitate to tilt the drum assembly on either side without any<br>
ffort.<br>
the motor and gearbox unit is covered by Top (12) and bottom covers (7) FRP/SS) along with boot (8) (4 No) at the bottom portion. The side portion also rill be covered by SS sheet to prevent the corrosion.<br>
the above said whole drum assembly and motor assembly with tilt frame (13) is placed in the bearing housing (11) of side frame (1). This will be in hanging position and can be tilted forward or backward with case because of centre lalancing, very little effort is required to tilt it. The bearing housing (11) is astened with the side frame of outer frame.<br>
"here are two outer side frames (made up of channels) connected (6) at the bottom nortion by means of channel or sections. This outer frame is covered by two sheet netal covers (6) (fig - 2) outside to prevent dust to enter into it.<br>
At the top portion of the outer frame, one support (22) is given to the lid (5) (made  of plastic/FRP) to hold in position. This lid (5) can swing up and down to over the drum assembly. While the drum assembly is in running, the lid (5) will be closed to cover the drum assembly so as to prevent the insects, foreign matter to alien into. While tilting the drum assembly, this lid to be taken upwards and rest n the vertical portion. Now the drum assembly can be tilted forward for batter iischarge.<br><br>
As described here in above, the whole grinder assemy assemblies i.e. drum assembly, motor &amp; gear box assembly and roller assembly forming a single unit. Tilt frame is pivoted at the centre through the bearing housing of outer frame. In this position there is no provision to arrest the movement of this assembly to tilt forward while in running.  The tilt lock system<br>
(19)	helps to lock the drum assembly in vertical position during running and to tilt<br>
position 90 degree to 120 degree angle for batter discharge.<br>
Tilt lock system consist of a housing (19) having slot at the centre portion is fastened to the pivot shaft (10) of tilt frame (13). This tilt lock housing (made up of casting / steel) is having slot at centre is mounted with lever (44) (fig-1) is pivoted at the centre portion along with housing for accomodating a small lock pin<br>
(20)	at the bottom protion. This small pin (20) is extended through the housing and<br>
to the hole in the bearing housing of side frame. A spring (45) is placed opposite<br>
to the small pin (20) of the lever (44) to give the load to the lever to lock small pin<br>
always in that position. The handle (18) with knob is fixed to the lever to facilitate<br>
the lever to push right side and left side of drum assembly.<br>
This is possible because the lever is pivoted at the slot housing by means of centre pin and is guided through it. When the lever is pressed right side of drum assembly, the small pin attached to the lever will come out of the hole provided at the bearing housing and this locking releases. Now the drum assembley can be tilt forward freely, another hole is provided corresponding the size of the pin at the bearing housing (11) ranging from 90 degree to 120 degree angle. In these positions, the drum assembly will be locked in position automatically because of spring force always pressing the lever in opposite direction of the pin. When the hole is coining nearer to the small pin while in movement, it will automatically gets locked immediately because of opposite spring force. Additional holes can be made in the bearing housing to lock the grinder at any angle in between 90° to 120°.<br><br>
In order to release drum assembly from the locked position, this lever is pressed further to the right side'of the drum assembly in order to release the small pin to come out of the hole of bearing housing and bring back the drum assembly to the original vertical position.<br>
This cylindrical roller and flat stone system is small in size compared with big size of base stone and pestle system. Due to cylindrical configuration of rollers, which are placed over the flat stone diametrically opposite to each other at a distance away from the central axis of the drum with their grinding surface in contact with the base stone. Two cylindrical rollers are form two circles corresponding to the centre axis of the base stone i.e. at the inner edge of the rollers and outer edge of the rollers. These circles circumference varies according to the width of the cylindrical roller and creates a differential speed when the base stone starts rotating.<br>
The inner circle will try to rotate at a lesser speed than the outer circle because of variation in their circumferential length. Finally the roller will compensate with this two speeds and rotate at one particular speed creating a difference in between the surfaces thereby rubbing motion established. This rubbing motion is very essential for grinding. When the substances are put in the drum into this system is caught in between two cylindrical rollers instead of one pestle in the normal commercial grinder. Due to small area available in the stones, the substances are continuously caught in between in quick sucession and get ground with minimum time. In this system one more factor is also helping to increase the efficiency ie the vertical (perpendicular) loading of the roller stone rather than lateral load in the pestle of commercial grinder. When the ground substance entering into the roller and flat stone, roller will be lifted temporarily and the vertical load keeps the<br><br>
roller to maintain the contact with the tlat stone. Lateral load in tne pestle or commercial grinder could not maintain this because of partial distribution of the load.<br>
The detachable drum and roller arrangement feature enable one to remove the drum assembly and roller assembly from the drive shaft of the gear box and can be taken to the sink for thorough cleaning.<br>
Tilting arrangement of drum assembly provided in the grinder will facilitate to discharge the ground paste to the vessel without using hand. The whole drum assembly mounted in a bearing housing can be tilt forward/backward to any angle to discharge batter into the vessel kept on the floor. This drum assembly locks in position viz at 90 to 120 degree angle for effective cleaning of substance in the vessel without any residue left in the drum.<br>
Tilt lock system enables the drum assembly to lock at the vertical position (while grinding the material) without falling of drum assembly on either side. This also helps to lock automatically for partial discharge of batter and also tilting the machine at an angle of 120 degree full and complete discharge of batter is permissible.<br>
Attachments like coconut scraper, atta kneader, meat mincer, sevai maker and vegetable cutters can be mounted on the drive shaft after detaching the drum assembly from it. Another salient feature of the invention is the same drive can be used for this attachment effectively.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the drum assembly is mounted the tilt frame in such a way that it can tilt forward or backward with minimum effort in order to discharge the batter into the vessel without any problem in the machine.<br><br>
In a conventional grinder it has to be discharged by hand or other means in the standing position with great difficulty.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, tilt lock system provided to the drum assembly will lock in vertical position and are at 90 degree and at 120 degree angle to discharge the batter completely because of this provision we need not hold the drum assembly by our hands to stand in that position until the batter is discharged.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the drum and roller assembly can be detached from the drive shaft to facilitate thorough cleaning. These assemblies can be taken to the kitchen sink for wash. This facility is not available in the present commercial grinders.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the drum assembly is covered with (plastic/FRP) lid to prevent the insects or foreign matters to fall into the batter.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention whereby the drum and roller assembly can be detached from the drive means facilitates us to use various other attachments such as coconut scraper, atta kneader, vegetable cutters, mean mincers and sevai maker.<br>
Advantages of the invention are as follows:<br>
1.	The device has unique cylindrical roller construction which enable grinding at<br>
almost half the time one normally spend on conventional grinder.<br>
2,	In this grinder the batter can be discharged by tilting the grinder without using<br>
the hand and time taken for grinding is comparatively less.<br><br>
3.	Power consumption and labour involvement for grinding are comparatively less.<br>
4.	Higher Capacity grinders can be easily handled with less skilled labourers.<br>
5.	The grinder is very compact.<br>
6.	The grinder is designed to ensure hygeine during grinder and transfer of batter.<br>
7.	The grinder has additional optional attachements.<br>
It will be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alteration and modification of the present invention which come with-in the scope of the following claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention. The scope of the invention is given in the appended statement of claims.<br><br>
