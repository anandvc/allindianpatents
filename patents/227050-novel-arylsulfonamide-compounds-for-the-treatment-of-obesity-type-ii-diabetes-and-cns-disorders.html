NOVEL, ARYLSULFONAMIDE COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY, TYPE II DIABETES AND CNS-DISORDERS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to Swedish application number 0101660-9, filed on May 11, 2001, U.S. provisional application number 60/294,102, filed on May 29, 2001, and U.S. provisional application number 60/294,132, filed on May 29, 2001, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to substituted bis-ai7lsulfonamide and arylsulfonamide compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to the use of the compounds for the prophylaxis and treatment of medical conditions relating to obesity, type II diabetes and/or disorders of the cential nei-vous system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above accepted norms. Obesity is the most important nutritional disorder in the western world and represents a major health problem in all industrialized countries. This disorder leads to increased mortality due to increased incidences of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease, cancer and type II diabetes. Searching for compounds, which reduce body weight has been going on for many decades. One line of research has been activation of serotonergic systems, either by direct activation of serotonin receptor subtjpes or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake. The exact receptor subt&gt;pc profile required is however not known.<br>
Serotonin (5-hydrox&gt;tr&gt;ptamine or 5-HT), a key transmitter of the peripheral and central nervous system, modulates a wide range of physiological and pathological functions, including anxiet}', sleep regulation* aggression, feeding and depression. Multiple serotonin receptor subt&gt;pc5 have been identified and cloned. One of these, the S-HT^ receptor, was<br><br>
cloned by several groups in 1993 (Ruat, M. et al. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comniun.193: 268-276; Sebben, M. et al. (1994) NeuroReport 5: 2553-2557). This receptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and displays affinity for antidepressants such as clozapine. Recently, the effect of 5-HT5 antagonist and 5-HT6 antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported (Bentley, J.C, et al. (1999) Br J Pharmac. Suppl. 126, P66; Bentley, J.C. et al. (1997) J. Psychophamiacol. Suppl. A64, 255).<br>
Compounds with enhanced affinity and selectivity for the S-HT^ receptor have been identified, e.g. in WO 00/34242 and by Isaac, M. et al. (2000) 6'Bicyclopiperazinyl-l-aiylsulfonylindoles and 6-Bicyclopiperidinyl-l-aiylsulfonylwdoles derivatives as novel, potent and selective 5-HTe receptor antagonists. Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 10: 1719-1721.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of formula (I) and (II) show affinity for the S-HT^ receptor as antagonists at a low nanomolar range. Compounds according to the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have 5-HT6 receptor antagonist activity and are believed to be of potential use in the tieatment or prophylaxis o] obesity and type II diabetes, as well as in the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders of the central nervous system such as an?liety, depression, panic attacks, memory disorders, sleep disorders, binge disorders, migiaine, anorexia, bulimia, obsessive compulsive disorders, psychoses, Alzheimer's disMSg, Parlcinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and/or schizophrenia, drug abuse, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders (ADHD).<br>

Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. All diasiereomeric forms possible (pure enantiomers, tautomers, racemic mixtures and unequal mixtures of two enantiomers) are within the scope of the invention. Such compounds can also occur as cis- or trans-, £"- or Z- double bond isomer forms. All isomeric foiTns are contemplated.<br>
Pharntaceutical formulations<br>
Phannaceutical fonnulations are usually prepared by mixing the active substance, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with conventional pharmaceutical excipients. The formulations can be further prepared by known methods such as granulation, compression, microencapsulation, spray coating, ^ic,<br>
Tliis invention relates to a method of treating obesity or type 11 diabetes. The method includes administering to a mammal subject (e.g., human) in need thereof an effective amount of one or more compounds of the fonnula (I) or the formula (II) above. Also winthin the scope of this invention is a method for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) 5-HT6 receptor activity. The method includes administering to a mammal in need thereof an eflectivc amount of a compound of the formula (I) or the formula (II) above.<br><br>
"An effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. The therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). For clinical use, the compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical formulations for oral, rectal, parenteral or other mode of administration. Usually the amount of active compounds is between 0.1-95% by weight of the preparation, preferably between 0.2-20% by weight in preparations for parenteral use and preferably between 1 and 50% by weight in preparations for oral administration.<br>
The typical daily dose of the active substance varies within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as for example the individual requirement of each patient and the route of administration. In general, oral and parenteral dosages will be in the range of 5 to 1000 mg per day of active substance, preferably 50 to 150 mg per day.<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTS<br>
The ability of a compound according to the invention to bind a S-HTe receptor, and to be pharmaceutically useful, can be detennined using w vivo and in vitro assays known in the art. (a) S-HTe Intfinsic Activity Assay<br>
Antagonists to the S-HTo receptor were characterized by measuring inhibition of 5-HT induced increase in cAMP in HEK 293 ceils expressing the human S-HTe receptor (see Boess et al. (1997) Neuropharmacology 36: 713-720). Briefly, HEK293/5-HT6 cells were seeded in polylysine coated 96-well plates at a density of 25,000 / well and grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) (without phenol-red) containing 5% dialyzed Foetal Bovine Serum for 4S h at 37°C in a 5% CO: incubator. The medium was then aspirated and replaced by 0.1 ml assay medium (Hanks Balance Salt Solution containing 20 niM HEPES, 1.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After addition of test substances, 50 |il dissolved in assay medium, the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C in a 5% COz incubator. The medium was again aspirated and the cAMP content was determined using a radioactive cAMP kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, BIOTRAK RPA559). The potency of antagonists was quantified by determining the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of 5-HT (at [5-HT]= 8 times EC50) evoked increase in cAMP, using the formula Ki.cfT IC5o/( 1+[5HT]/EC5o).<br>
The compounds in accordance with the invention have a selective affinity to 5-HT6 receptors with Kj values between 1 nM and 5 pM and they antagonized the 5-HT indiced increase of cAMP. There is correlation between the K* binding and the Ki^ff,cacy Moreover, the compounds show good selectivity (&gt;I00 fold) against S-HT:^, 5-HT2b, S-HTjc, 5-HTu, 5-HTib-<br>

Obese (ob/ob) mouse is selected as the primary animal model for screening as this mutant mouse consumes high amounts of food resulting in a high signal to noise ratio. To further substantiate and compare efficacy data, the effect of the compounds on food consumption is also studied in wild type (C57BL/6J) mice. The amount of food consumed during 15 hours of infusion of compounds is recorded.<br>
Male mice (obese C57BL/6JBom-Lep°*' and lean wild-type C57Bl/6JBom; Bomholtsgaard, Denmark) 8-9 weeks with an average body weight of 50 g (obese) and 25 g (lean) are used in all the studies. The animals are housed singly in cages at 23±l^C, 40-60 % humidity and have free access to water and standard laboratoiy chow. The 12/12-h light/dark ..cycle is set to lights off at 5 p.m. The animals are conditioned for at least one week before start of study.<br>
The test compounds are dissolved in solvents suitable for each specific compound such as cj'clodextrin, cyclodextrin/methane sulfonic acid, polyethylene glycol/methane sulfonic acid, saline. Fresh solutions are made for each study. Doses of 30, 50 and 100 mg kg'^day"* are used. The purity of the test compounds is of analytical grade.<br>
The animals are weighed at the start of the study and randomized based on body weight. Alzet osmotic minipumps (Model 2001D; infusion rate S |il/h) are used and loaded essentially as recommended by the Alzet technical information manual (Alza Scientific Products, 1997; Teeuwcs and Yam, 1976). Continuous subcutaneous infusion with 24 hours duration is used. The minipumps arc cither filled with different concentrations of test compounds dissolved in vehicle or with only vehicle solution and maintained in vehicle prc-warmed to 37^C (approx. Ih). The minipumps are implanted subcutaneously in the<br><br>
neck/back region under short acting anesthesia (metofane/enflurane). This surgical procedure lasts approximately 5 min. It takes about 3 h to reach steady state delivery of the compound.<br>
The weight of the food pellets are measured at 5 p.m. and at 8 p. m. for two days before (baseline) and one day after the implantation of the osmotic minipumps. The weigh-in is performed with a computer assisted Mettler Toledo PR 5002 balance. Occasional spillage is corrected for. At the end of the study the animals are killed by neck dislocation and trunk blood sampled for later analysis of plasma dmg concentrations.<br>
The plasma sample proteins are precipitated with methanol, centrifuged and the supernatant is ti*ansferred to HPLC vials and injected into the liquid chromatography /mass spectrometric system. The mass spectrometer is set for electrospray positive ion mode and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM with the tiansition m/z 316 =&gt; 221).<br>
A linear regression analysis of the standards forced through the origin is used to calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples.<br>
Food consumption for 15 hours is measured for the three consecutive days and the percentage of basal level values is derived for each animal from the day before and after treatment. The values are expressed as mean ± SD and ± SEM from eight animals per dose group. Statistical evaluation is performed by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA using the percent basal values.
