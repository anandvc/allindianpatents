3-SUBSTITUTED-5- AND 6-AMESfOALKYL INDOLE-2-CAKBOXYLIC ACID AMIDES AND RELATED ANALOGS AS INHIBITORS OF CASEIN KINASE Ie<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a series of substituted 5-aminoalkyl-lH-indole-2-carboxylic acid amides and 6-aminoalkyl-lH-indole-2-carboxybc acid amides. More specifically the invention relates to 3-arylthio-substituted and 3-heterocyclethio-substituted 5-aminoaIkyl-lH-indole-2-carboxylic acid amides and 6-aminoalkyl--lH-indole-2-carboxylic acid amides, and related analogs. The compounds of the invention are inhibitors of human casein kinase i.e phosphorylation of the human clock protein Period (hPER) and are therefore useful, as pharmaceutical agents, especially in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases and disorders associated with the central nervous system.<br>
2.	Description of the Art<br>
Rhythmic variations in behavior are displayed by many organisms, ranging from single cells to man. When the rhythm persists under constant conditions, and has a period of about one day, depending little on temperature, the rhythm is called "circadian" (Konopka, RJ. and Benzer, S. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68,2112-2116).<br>
Circadian rhythms are generated by endogenous biological pacemakers (circadian clocks) and are present in most living organisms incjuding humans, fungi, insects and bacteria (Dunlap, J.C. (1999) Cell 96, 271-290; Hastings, J.W. et al. Circadian Rhythms, The Physiology of Biological Timing. In: Prosser, C.L. ed. Neural and Integrative Animal Physiology, New York: Wiley-liss (1991) 435-546; Allada, R. et al. (1998) Cell 93, 791-804; Kondo et al. (1994) Science 266, 1233-1236; Crosthwaite, S.K. et al. (1997) Science 276, 763-769; Shearman, L.P. et al. (1997) Neuron, 19,1261-1269). Circadian rhythms are self-sustaining and constant even under conditions of total darkness, but can be synchronized (entrained) to a new day/night regime by environmental signals such as light and temperature cycles (Pittendrigh, C.S. (1993) Annu. Rev. Physiol., 55,16-54; Takahashi, J.S. (1995) Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 18,531-553; Albrecht, U. et al. (1997) Cell, 91,1055-1064). Circadian clocks are essential for maintaining biological rhythms and regulate a variety of circadian behaviors<br><br>
such as daily fluctuations in behavior, food intake and the sleep/wake cycle, as well as physiological changes such as hormone secretion and fluctuations in body temperature (Hastings, M. (1997) Trends Neurosci. 20, 459-464; Reppert, S.M. and Weaver, D.R. (1997) Cell 89,487-490).<br>
Genetic and molecular studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster led to elucidation of some of the genes involved in circadian rhythmicity. These studies led to recognition of a pathway that is closely auto-regulated and comprised of a transcription/translation-based negative feed back loop (Dunlap, J.C. (1999) Cell, 96, 271-290; Dunlap, J.C. (1996) Annu. Rev. Genet 30, 579-601; Hall, J.C. (1996) Neuron, 17, 799-802). The core elements of the circadian oscillator in Drosophila consists of two stimulatory proteins dCLOCK/dBMAL (CYCLE) and two inhibitory proteins dPERIOD (dPER) and dTTMELESS (dTIM). dCLOCK and dBMAL heterodimerize forming the transcription factor dCLOCK/dBMAL that promotes expression of two genes termed Drosophila Period (dper) and Drosophila Timeless {dtim). Ultimately the mRNAs from these genes are transcribed to afford the proteins dPER and dTTM, respectively. For several hours the protein products dPER and dTIM are synthesized and phosphorylated in the cytoplasm, reach a critical level, and form heterodimers that are translocated into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus dPER and dTIM function as negative regulators of their own transcription, accumulation of dPER and dTIM declines, and activation of dper and dtim by dCLOCK/dBMAL starts again (Zylka, MJ. et al. (1998) Neuron 20,1103-1110; Lowrey, P.L. et al. (2000) 288,483-491). The iper gene has been shown to be a necessary element in controlling circadian rhythms in adult eclosion (the emergence of the adult fly from the pupa) behavior and locomotor activity (Konopka, R.J., &amp; Benzer, S. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 68, 2112-2116). Missense mutations of the per gene can either shorten (pell) or lengthen (per^) the period of circadian rhythms, while nonsense mutations (per0) cause arrhythmicity in their behaviors (Hall, J.C. (1995) Trends Neurosci. 18,230-240).<br>
In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus are the site of a master biological clock (for review see Panda et al, (2002) Nature 417,329 - 335; Reppert, S.M. and Weaver, D.R. (1997) Cell, 89, 487-490). The SCN clock is entrained to the 24 hour day by the daily light-dark cycle, with light acting through both direct and indirect retina-to-SCN pathways (Klein, D.C. et al. (1991) Suprachiasmatic Nuclei: The Mind's Clock,<br><br>
Oxford Univeristy Press, New York). In the SCN of rodents, three Per genes have been<br>
identified and cloned, and are designated as mouse Perl (rnPerl), mPerl and mPer3. The<br>
protein products of these mammalian genes (mPERl, mPER2, mPER3) share several regions<br>
of homology to each other, and each mammalian Per gene encodes a protein with a protein<br>
dimerization domain designated as PAS (PAS is an acronym for the first three proteins PER,<br>
ARNT and SIM found to share this functionally important dimerization domain) that is highly<br>
homologous to the PAS domain of insect PER. All Per messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and<br>
protein levels oscillate during the circadian day and are intimately involved in both positive<br>
and negative regulation of the biological clock, but only mPERl and mPER2 oscillate in<br>
response to light (Zylka, MJ. et al. (1998) Neuron 20,1103-1110.; Albrecht, U. et al., (1997)<br>
Cell 91,1055-1064; Shearman, L.P. et al. (1997) Neuron 19,1261-1269). The mammalian<br>
homolog of the Drosophila tint gene was cloned and designated as mTim. However, there was<br>
no evidence for mPER-mTIM interactions analogous to those observed in Drosophila, and it<br>
was suggested that PER-PER interactions may have replaced the function of PER-TTM dimers -      ' •<br>
in the molecular workings of the mammalian circadian clock (Zylka, MJ. et al., (1998)<br>
Neuron 21,1115-1122). Another possibility is that rhythms in PERI and PER2 form negative<br>
feedback loops that regulate the transcriptional activity of the Clock protein (via their PAS<br>
domains), which, in turn, drives expression of either or both Per genes (Shearman, L.P. et al.<br>
(1997) Neuron 19, 1261-1269).<br>
Understanding the roles of the three mPer genes in the mammalian clockwork has been the subject of much investigation. The structural homology of the mPER proteins to dPER led to the expectation that the mPER proteins would function as negative elements in the mammalian feedback loop. PERI is believed to be involved in the negative regulation of its own transcription in the feedback loop, but recent evidence points to it being involved in the input pathway (Hastings, M.H. et al. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 26, 15211-15216). PER2 is the most well characterized protein, and mPER2 mutant mice (mPer2Brdm]), lacking 87 residues at the carboxyl portion of the PAS dimerization domain, have a shortened circadian cycle in noimal light-dark settings, but show arrhythmicity in complete darkness. The mutation also diminishes the oscillating expression of both inPerl and mPer2 in the SCN, indicating that mPer2 may regulate mPerl in vivo (Zheng, B. et al. (1999) Nature 400,169-173). PER2 has been shown to have a dual function in the regulation of the "gears" of the central clock (Shearman, L.P. et al. (2000) Science 288,1013-1018). In that study, PER2 was<br><br>
shown to bind to cryptochrome (CRY) proteins and translocate to the nucleus where CRY negatively regulated transcription driven by the CLOCK and BMAL1 positive transcriptional complexes. Upon nuclear entry, PER2 initiated the positive arm of the clock by positively regulating BMAL1 transcription by a yet unidentified mechanism. The function of PER3 is poorly understood; however, in JiiPer3 knockout mice a subtle effect on circadian activity is observed, and therefore PER3 has been suggested to be involved in the circadian controlled output pathways (Shearman, LJ?. et al. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 6269-6275). It has been reported that mPER proteins interact with each other and that mPER3 can serve as a carrier of mPERl and mPER2 to bring them into the nucleus which is critical for the generation of circadian signals in the SCN (Kume, K. et al. (1999) Cell 98,193-205; Takano, A. et al. (2000), FEBS Letters, 477,106-112).<br>
Phosphorylation of the components of the circadian clock has been postulated to regulate the-duration of the cycle. The first genetic evidence that a specific protein kinase regulates the Drosophila circadian rhythm was the discovery of the novel gene doubletime (dbt), encoding a protein serine/threonine kinase (Price J.L. et al. (1998) Cell 94, 83-95; Kloss B. et al. (1998) Cell 94, 97-107). Missense mutations in the dbt result in an altered circadian rhythm. Null alleles of dbt result in hypophosphorylation of dPER and arrhythmia.<br>
The mammalian kinases most closely related to DBT are casein kinase Ie (CKIs) and casein kinase 15 (CKIS). Both kinases have been shown to bind to mPERl, and several studies have shown that CKIe phosphorylates both mouse and human PERI (Price J.L. et al. (1998) Cell 94, 83-95; Kloss B. et al. (1998) Cell94,97-107). In a study with human embryonic kidney 293T cells co-transfected with wild-type hCKIe, hPERl showed a significant increase in phosphorylation (evidenced by a shift in molecular mass). In this study, the phosphorylated hPERl had a half-life of approximately twelve hours whereas unphosphorylated hPERl remained stable in the cell for more that 24 hours, suggesting phosphorylation of hPERl leads to a decrease in protein stability (Kessler, G.A. et al. (2000) NeuroReport, 11, 951-955). Another study also showed the consequence of PERI phosphorylation by hCKIe includes both cytoplasmic retention and protein instability (Vielhaber, E. et al. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13,4888-4899; Takano, A. et al. (2000) FEBS Letters 477,106-112).<br><br>
There has been no biochemical reason to choose between CKIe or CKI5 as a potential regulator in mammals until Lowery et al. [(2000) Science 288,483-491] found that in the Syrian Golden hamster, semidominant mutations in CKIe (tau mutation, Ralph, M.R. and Menaker, M. (1988) Science 241,1225-1227) caused a shortened circadian day in both heterozygous (22 h) and homozygous (20 h) animals. In this instance, reduced levels of CKIe activity resulted in less PER phosphorylation with presumably higher levels of cytoplasmic PER protein leading to enhanced nuclear entry and altered circadian cycles. More recently, it has been suggested that CKI5 may also be involved in regulating circadian rhythmicity by post-translation modification of mammalian clock proteins hPERl and hPER2 [Camacho, F. et al., (2001) EEBS Letters 489(2,3), 159-165]. Thus, inhibitors, including small molecule inhibitors, of mammalian or human CKIe and/or CKI8 provide a novel means to phase shift or reset the circadian clock. As discussed below, the alteration of circadian rhythm may find utility for the treatment of sleep or mood disorders.<br>
U.S. patent 6,555,328 Bl discloses screening methods in cells to identify compounds that alter circadian rhythms based on a test compound altering the ability of human casein kinase Is and/or human casein kinase 15 to phosphorylate the human clock proteins hPERl, hPER2 and hPER3. For example, HEK293T cells are co-transfected with hCKIe and Perl or Per2. For the purpose of evaluating the relevancy of CKIe inhibition and CKIe inhibitors to circadian biology, a high-throughput cellular assay (33rd Annual Meeting, Soc. for Neurosci., November 8-12, 2003, Abstract numbers 284.1, 284.2, and 284.3) was developed in which circadian rhythm could be monitored in a routine manner. The assay consists of Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing a Mperl-luc construct, thus enabling the determination of the rhythmic activation of the Mperl promoter in living cells by repeatedly estimating luciferase activity by monitoring light-output over several days. The repeated measure format of the assay permits accurate and reproducible assessment of the concentration-dependent effects of CKIe inhibitors on circadian rhythm and provides the nexus for relating CKIe inhibition to circadian period alteration.<br>
Sleep disorders have been classified into four major categories that include primary sleep disorders (dyssomnias and parasomnias), sleep disorders associated with medical/psychiatric disorders and a category of proposed sleep disorders for sleep disorders that cannot be classified due to insufficient data. Primary sleep disorders are thought to arise<br><br>
from abnormalities in the intrinsic systems responsible for sleep-wake generation (homeostatic system) or timing (circadian system). Dyssomnias are disorders in initiating or maintaining sleep and include primary insomnia, hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, and dyssomnias not otherwise specified.  Primary insomnia is characterized by the persistence (&gt;1 month) in difficulty of initiating and maintaining sleep or of non-restorative sleep. Difficulties in sleeping associated with primary insomnia leads to significant distress or impairment, including daytime irritability, loss of attention and concentration, fatigue and malaise, and deterioration of mood and motivation. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders include jet lag syndrome, shift work sleep disorder, advanced sleep phase syndrome and delayed sleep phase syndrome (J. Wagner, M.L. Wagner and W.A. Hening, Annals of Pharmacotherapy (1998) 32, 680-691). Individuals in a forced sleep paradigm demonstrate a greater wakefulness, as a percentage of sleep time, at certain periods of circadian day (Dijk and Lockley, J. Appl. Physiol. (2002) 92, 852-862). It has been generally accepted that with age there is an advance in our circadian rhythm for sleep and often results in less quality sleep (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. (2002) 282, E297-E303). Thus, sleep occurring out of circadian phase may suffer in qualitative and quantitative terms, as further exemplified by alterations in sleep with shift work and jet lag. Disturbance of the human circadian clock can cause sleep disorders and agents that modulate circadian rhythmicity, such as an inhibitor of CKIe and/or CKI8, may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders, and particularly circadian rhythm sleep disorders.<br>
Mood disorders are divided into depressive disorders ("unipolar depression"), bipolar disorders, and two disorders based on etiology that include mood disorder due to a general medical condition and substance-induced mood disorder. Depressive disorders are subclassified as major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Bipolar disorders are subclassified as bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. It has been observed that the specifier "seasonal pattern" can be applied to major depressive disorders that are recurrent and to the pattern of major depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. Prominent anergy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates often characterize major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely in major depressive disorder that is recurrent or in bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar<br><br>
disorders, a seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than in bipolar I<br>
disorder. In some individuals the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked to<br>
a particular season. The winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age and<br>
sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes, younger persons are at higher risk for winter<br>
depressive episodes, and females comprise 60% to 90% of persons with seasonal pattern.<br>
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a term commonly used in the literature, is a subtype of<br>
mood disorder that in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV)<br>
(American Psychiatric Association: "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders",<br>
Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000) is<br>
denoted by the term "with seasonal pattern" when describing a seasonal pattern of major<br>
depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder or recurrent major depressive<br>
disorder (E. M. Tarn et al., Can. J. Psychiatry (1995) 40,457-466). The characteristics and<br>
diagnoses of depressive disorders, major depressive disorder, major depressive episode,<br>
bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder and seasonal effects-are described in DSM-IV,	-Patients suffering from major depressive disorders, including SAD that is characterized by recurrent depressive episodes typically in winter, have been shown to be positively responsive to light therapy (Kripke, Journal of Affective Disorders (1998) 49(2), 109-117). The success of bright light treatment for patients with SAD and major depression resulted in the proposal of several hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanism of action for the therapeutic effect of light. These hypotheses included the "circadian rhythm hypothesis" that suggests the antidepressant effect of bright light could be associated with phase-shifting the circadian pacemaker relative to sleep (E. M. Tarn et al., Can. J. Psychiatry (1995) 40,457-466). In support of the link between light therapy and circadian rhythm, clinically effective light therapy in major depressive disorders causes a concomitant shift in circadian phase and the clinical effectiveness of light therapy appears to depend on the phase-shifting ability of the light therapy (Czeisler et al., The Journal of Physiology (2000) 526 (Part 3), 683-694; Terman et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry (2001) 58, 69-75). Additionally, light-therapy has been shown to accelerate and augment the effectiveness of the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorders (Benedetti et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry (2003) 64, 648-653). Thus, inhibition of casein kinase Ie and/or casein kinase 18 would be expected to cause a circadian phase shift and such inhibition represents a potential clinically effective mono- or combined therapy for mood disorders.<br><br>
It should be noted that sleep disturbance is a criterion symptom for many psychiatric disorders (W.V. McCall, J. Clin. Psychiatry (2001) 62 (suppl 10), 27-32). Sleep disturbances are a common feature of depressive disorders and insomnia is the sleep disturbance that is frequently reported in depression, occurring in over 90% of depressed patients (M.E. Thase, J. Clin. Psychiatry (1999) 60 (suppl 17), 28-31). Accumulating evidence supports a common pathogenesis for primary insomnia and major depressive disorder. It has been hypothesized that corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) hyperactivity (due to genetic predisposition or possibly early stress) and stress induce a process leading to exaggerated and protracted sleep disturbances, and eventually primary insomnia. Orcadian rhythmicity in CRF secretion under nonstressed conditions may play a role in the normal sleep-wake expression (G.S. Richardson and T. Roth, J. Clin Psychiatry (2001) 62 (suppl 10), 39-45). Thus, agents that modulate circadian rhythmicity, for example by inhibition of casein kinase IE and/or casein kinase 16, may be useful for treatment of depressive disorders due to effects on CRF secretion:  ------<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, "stereoisomer" is a general term used for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. The term stereoisomer includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), mixtures of mirror image isomers (racemates, racemic mixtures), geometric (cis/trans or E/Z) isomers, and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers). The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, individual diastereoisomers, or enantiomers, or may exist as geometric isomers, with all isomeric forms of said compounds being included in the present invention.<br>
As used herein, "R" and "S" are used as commonly used in organic chemistry to denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term "R" (rectus) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The term "S" (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon sequence rules wherein prioritization is first based on atomic number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A listing and discussion of priorities is contained in "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", Ernest L. Eliel, Samuel H. Wilen and<br><br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by processes analogous to those known in the art. Reaction schemes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the corresponding descriptive text, describe the preparation of the various compounds of the invention. The disclosed methods and examples are provided for illustration purposes and in no way limit the scope of the present invention. Alternative reagents, reaction conditions, and other combinations and permutations of the steps herein described to arrive at individual compounds are readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Tables 1 and 2 provide summaries of the specific compounds of this invention which are prepared in accordance with the synthetic procedures described herein, and biological data for the compounds of the invention are summarized in Table 3.<br><br><br>
As described in scheme 1, optionally substituted ethyl 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxylate (3) and ethyl 6-cyanoindole-2-carboxylate (5) starting materials are prepared by methods well known to one skilled in the art from known or commercially available optionally substituted 3-methyl-4-nitrobenzonitrile (la) or 4-methyI-3-nitrobenzonitrile (lb), respectively. As shown in scheme 1, step a, an oxalate diester, such as for example diethyloxalate, is added to a solution of a suitable base, such as for example sodium ethoxide in absolute ethanol, at from about 0°C to about room temperature followed by addition of starting benzonitrile la or lb at from about 0°C to about room temperature. After stirring the mixture at about room temperatue for about 8 to about 24 hours, the reaction is neutralized by addition of a suitable acid, such as for example hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or the like acids, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is partitioned between water and a suitable organic solvent, such as for example methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate and the like solvents. The organic phase is dried, concentrated, and the residue is purified by chromatographic methods weD known to one skilled in the art to provide oxopropionic ester 2 or 4, respectively. Oxopropionic esters 2 or 4 are each reduced with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as for example palladium on carbon, in a suitable solvent, such as for example ethanol, until the theoretical amount of hydrogen is absorbed The reaction mixture is filtered and the filtrate concentrated to afford the crude indole that is purified by chromatographic methods well known to one skilled in the art to afford optionally substituted ethyl 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxylate (3a) or ethyl 6-cyanoindole-2-carboxylate (5a), respectively. As shown in scheme 1, step c, optionally substituted ethyl 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxylate (3a) or ethyl 6-cyanoindole-2-carboxylate (5a) starting esters may be optionally transesterified to the corresponding methyl ester 3b or 5b, respectively, by methods well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example by stirring mixture of methanol, potassium carbonate and ethyl ester 3a or 5a at from about room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent, cooling, and isolating and purifying the product by methods well known to one skilled in the art, provides methyl ester 3b or 5b, respectively. Alternatively, methyl esters 3b and 5b are readily prepared by substituting dimethyloxalate for diethyloxalate and sodium methoxide in methanol for sodium ethoxide in absolute ethanol in the above described synthesis.<br><br><br>
Scheme 2 describes the preparation of optionally substituted intermediate 3-arylthio-or 3-heterocycle1hio-5-aininomethy]indole-2-carb6xainides 8b and 3-arylthio- or 3-heterocyclethio-6-aminomethylindole-2-carboxarnides lib. As shown in scheme 2, 5-cyano esters 3a/3b and 6-cyano esters 5a/5b are each converted to primary amides 6 and 9, respectively, by methods well known to one skilled in the art. Thus, treating a mixture of about 7M ammonia and ester 3a or 3b or ester 5a or 5b in a suitable polar solvent, such as for example methanol or ethanol, with a chip of lithium hydroxide and heating the resultant mixture in a pressure vessel at about 100 °C for about 16 hours provides, after chromatographic purification as is well known to one skilled in the art, primary amide 6 or 9, respectively. Alternatively, other reaction conditions well known to one skilled in the art may   . be employed, such as treating a solution of the appropriate ester in a suitable polar solvent, such as for example methanol or ethanol, with about 5M to about 7M ammonia solution for about one day to about three days at ambient temperature, or by heating the solution to about 55 °C for about 10 hours, provides primary amide 6 or 9, respectively, after isolation by methods well known to one skilled in the art. Alternatively, the appropriate ester may be suspended in a mixture of concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution and lithium chloride at ambient temperature for about three days to about five days until thin layer chromatographic analysis, or other suitable chromatographic analysis as is well known to one skilled in the art, indicates that the reaction is substantially complete. Primary amides 6 or 9 are isolated from the reaction mixture by methods well known to one skilled in the art.<br><br>
Other methods to prepare the amides of the invention are readily appreciated by one skilled in the art. For example, carboxylic acids corresponding to scheme 1 compounds 3 or 5 wherein R is H may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding esters 3a and 3b, or 5a and 5b, by methods well known to one skilled in the art. For example, a suitable base, such as for example potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like bases, is added to a mixture of ester 3a or 3b, or 5a or 5b, in a suitable solvent such as for example a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water. The mixture is heated at about 90 °C to about 110 °C for about 0.5 hour to about 2 hours. The product is recovered as a salt by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated to provide additional material as a residue. The filter cake and residue are combined and acidified by methods well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example acidification with a suitable acid such as acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the like solvents, to provide the corresponding carboxylic acids of compound 3 or 5 respectively, wherein R is H. These carboxylic acids are readily converted to amides of the invention by procedures well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example, a solution of carboxylic acid 3 or 5 in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide can be treated with a base such as diisopropylethylamine, a carbodiimide such as for example l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and ammonium chloride. When the reaction is complete as determined by thin layer chromatography, or other suitable chromatographic analyses as are well known to one skilled in the art, the mixture can be diluted with a suitable solvent, and the product can be isolated and chromatographically purified by methods well known to one skilled in the art to provide primary amides 6 or 9, respectively, wherein R2 is NH2. If primary or secondary Ci-Cealkylamines are employed in place of ammonium chloride, one can also prepare the corresponding Ci-Cealkyl secondary and tertiary amides corresponding to compounds 6 or 9 wherein NH2 is replaced by NH(Ci-C6aUcyl) or N(Ci-C6alkyI)2, respectively.<br>
As show in scheme 2, step e, the nitrile moiety of optionally substituted 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxamide 6 and 6-cyanoindole-2-carboxamide 9 are each reduced to the corresponding primary amine that is simultaneously Boc-protected to provide intermediate primary amides 7 and 10, respectively, by methods well known to one skilled in the art. For example, a solution of 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxamide 6 or 6-cyanoindole-2-carboxamide 9 in a suitable polar solvent, such as for example, methanol, is treated with nickel chloride and Boc-anhydride. The mixture is then treated at from about 0 °C to about 15 °C with a suitable<br><br>
reducing agent, such as for example sodium borohydride, and then stirred at about room temperature for about 8 hours to about 24 hours. The reaction mixture is concentrated, extracted and the product isolated by methods well known to one skilled in the art to provide the corresponding 5- or 6-Boc~protected-aminomethyhndole-2-carboxamides 7 or 10, respectively.<br>
As shown in scheme 2, step f, intermediate amides 7 and 10 are each converted to the corresponding 3-arylthio or 3-heterocyclethio compounds 8a and 11a, respectively, by methods well known to one skilled in the art. For example, a suspension of intermediate amide 7 or 10 in a suitable solvent, such as for example dimethylformamide or NMP, is treated with a suitable base, such as for example sodium hydride or lithium hydride, at ambient temperature, followed by treatment with a suitable diaryldisulfide or diheterocycledisulfide, and then the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature to about 100°C for about 12 hours to about 20 hours. The course of the reaction is followed by thin layer chromatographic analysis or other chromatographic methods as are well known to one skilled in the art. When complete, the reaction is worked-up by extractive methods as are well known to one skilled in the art. The desired intermediate 5-Boc-protected-aminomethylindole-2-carboxamide 8a and 6-Boc-protected-aminomethylindole-2-carboxamide 11a are each isolated and chromatographically purified by methods as are well known to one skilled in the art to provide compounds 8a and 11a wherein R3 is aryl or heterocycle. As shown in scheme 2, step g, acidic hydrolysis of the Boc-protecting group is performed in a manner well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example treating compound 8a or 11a with excess trifluoroacetic acid at about room temperature for about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes, concentrating the mixture and isolating the corresponding primary amine 8b or lib, respectively, as the trifluoroacetate salt<br>
Alternatively, as shown in scheme 2, step f, a mixture of the diaryldisulfide or diheterocycledisulfide and about one equivalent of cesium carbonate in a suitable solvent, such as for example dimethylformamide or NMP, is treated with optionally substituted intermediate amide 7 or 10, and then the mixture is heated at about 80 °C to about 120°C for about one to about six hours. The reaction is monitored by thin layer chromatography or other chromatographic methods as are well known to one skilled in the art. The desired optionally substituted intermediate 3-arylthio- or 3-hetercyclethio-5-Boc-protected-aminomethylindole-2-carboxamide 8a and 3-arylthio- or 3-hetercyclethio-6-Boc-protected-aininomethylindole-2-carboxamide 11a are each isolated and chromatographically purified by methods as are well to<br><br>
one skilled in the art to provide compounds 8a and 11a wherein R3 is aryl or heterocycle. The Boc-protecting group of compounds 8a and 11a is removed by acid hydrolysis as described above to afford the corresponding primary amine 8b or lib, respectively, as the trifluoroacetate salt.<br><br>
As described in scheme 3, optionally substituted intermediates 13,14 and 15 are each prepared from optionally substituted 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxylic acid amide 6. As shown in scheme 3, step h, 5-cyanoindole-2-carboxylic acid amide 6 is converted to the corresponding 3-arylthio or 3-heterocyclethio compound 12 as is described above in scheme 2, step f, to provide 3-arylthio- or 3-heterocyclethio-5-cyanoindole-2-carboxyhc acid amide 12 after isolation and purification by methods as are well known to one skilled in the art As show in scheme 3, step i, the nitrile moiety of intermediate 12 is reduced by methods well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example, by treating a suspension of intermediate 12 and NaHfePC^ in pyridine and water with a slurry of Raney nickel, and heating at about 95 DC for about 4 hours to about 5 hours. The reaction mixture is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to a minimum volume and treated with ice water to afford, after isolation and drying by procedures that are well known to one skilled in the art, intermediate 5-formyl-3-substituted-indole-2-carboxylic acid amide 13.<br>
As shown in scheme 3, step j, the indole nitrogen of optionally substituted 3-arylthio-or 3-heterocyclethio-5-formylindole-2-carboxarnide 13 is N-alkylated to provide compound 14 wherein Ri is Ci-Cgalkyl by methods well known to one skilled in the art. Thus, a solution of intermediate 13 in a suitable polar solvent, such as for example dimethylformamide or NMP, is treated at about ambient temperature with a suitable base, such as for example potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium t-butoxide, and then treated with a<br><br>
solution of a Q-CV-alkyl halide in a suitable polar solvent, such as for example dimethylformamide or NMP. The reaction is stirred for about 24 hours to about 72 hours at room temperature and diluted with a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with brine, dried and concentrated to afford N-alkylated compound 14 wherein Ri is Ci-Cealkyl. One skilled in the art recognizes that other conditions for N-alkylation of the indole nitrogen may be employed, such as for example by treating a solution of the compound of formula 13 and a suitable solvent, such as for example l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone with a Ci-Ce-dialkylsulfate and a suitable base, such as for example cesium carbonate, at ambient temperature for a suitable period of time. Alternatively, the nitrogen of the indole ring may also be alkylated by treating a pyridine solution of a compound of formula 13 with a Ci-Ce-alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable base such as for example cesium carbonate with heating for a suitable period of time. Additionally, one skilled in the art recognizes that N-alkylation of the indole nitrogen may be performed at other points in the synthetic steps disclosed in schemes 1 to 4.<br>
As also described in scheme 3, optionally substituted intermediate 6 is also reduced with Raney nickel, under step i conditions as described for the reduction of intermediate 12 to 13, to afford optionally substituted 5-formylindole-2-carboxylic acid amide 15. Aldehyde 15 is converted by reductive anamination to optionally substituted 5-alkylaminomethylindole-2-carboxylic acid amides 16 by methods well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example by treating a solution of optionally substituted aldehyde 15 in a suitable solvent, such as a mixture of acetic acid and tetrahydrofuran, with an alkylamine followed by addition of a suitable base, such as for example potassium or sodium carbonate, and a suitable reducing agent, such as for example sodium cyanoborohydride at about room temperature. The reaction is monitored by chromatographic methods as are well known to one skilled in the art, such as thin layer chromatography, and when complete the reaction is diluted with a suitable solvent, washed with sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate and the dried organic phase is concentrated to afford optionally substituted 5-alkylaminomethylindole-2-carboxylic acid amide 16.<br><br><br>
Scheme 4 describes methods for converting optionally substituted intermediates 8b, lib, 13,14 and 16 to compounds of formula I and II of the invention by methods well known to one skilled in the art. One skilled in the art readily appreciates that these methods are generally applicable to the preparation of compounds of formula I and II from precursor compounds that are not specifically shown in scheme 4, and that the methods shown are for illustrative purposes and do not limit the scope of the invention.

Methodology:<br>
1.  Prepare500mLoffreshassaybuffer.50mMTrispH7.5,10mMMgCl2) 2mMDTT<br>
andlmMEGTA<br><br>
2.	Obtain compounds to be evaluated as 10^L of lOmM stock dissolved in 100% DMSO.<br>
Use a Biomek 2000 liquid handling robot, make serial dilutions to yield 10,1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 |JM final compound dilutions added as 5\jiL additions to Falcon U bottom plates.  Typically test 8 compounds per 96 well plate with column 1 and 12 serving as control wells. A routine screening assay will consist of 32 compounds, which equals 4 assay plates.<br>
3.	Assay plate maps are set up according to the following pattern CKlePlateMap.xls<br><br>
4.	Add 5 ixL of compound as indicated, then add 5|xL of dephosphorylated casein<br>
(dissolved in distilled H20)(0.2\ig/\LL) and 20^L CKle (3ng/nL) to the appropriate wells.<br>
5.	Finally add 20JJL y-33P-ATP (0.02fxCi/^L) /lOfxM cold ATP (equals approximately<br>
2xl06CPM per well).<br>
6.	Vortes the Falcon U-Bottom assay plate containing the above 50joL reaction volume<br>
and then incubate at room temperature for 2 hours.<br>
7.	At the end of 2 hours, stop the reaction by the addition of 65\xL of ice cold 2mM cold<br>
ATP (made up in assay buffer) to the assay plates using a Beckman Multimek.<br>
8.	At the same time add 25 JJL 100% ice cold TCA made up in distilled EfeO to a matching<br>
number of Millipore MAPH filter plates.<br>
9.	Using a handheld 8-channel pipettor, transfer lOOfxL of the reaction mixture from the<br>
Falcon U-Bottom Plate to the Millipore MAPH filter plates presoaked with TCA.<br>
10.	Mix the Millipore MAPH filter plates gently and allow to sit at room temperature for at<br>
least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins.<br><br>
11.	After 30 minutes, place the filter plates on a Millipore vacuum manifold and filter at no<br>
more than 8mm Hg as the MAPH filters tend to "air lock" at higher vacuum settings.<br>
12.	Wash the filter plates sequentially and filter with 2xl50jiL 20% TCA, 2x150 piL 10%<br>
TCA and 2X150JAL 5% TCA (total of 6 washes per plate/900nL per well).<br>
13.	Allow the plates to dry overnight at room temperature. The next day add 40fiL<br>
Packard Microscint-20 Scintillation Fluid per well using a Titertek Multidrop dispenser; seal the plates and count for 2 minutes/well in a Packard Topcount NXT Scintillation Counter (to provide CPM values/well).<br>
Calculation:<br>
1.	Import Counts Per Minute (CPM) data into a proprietary data calculation and archiving database (Activity Base by IDBS version 5.0).<br>
2.	Column 1 for each plate reflects total phosphorylation activity of the enzyme in the absence of any inhibiting compound and thus represents 100%. Column 12 reflects any nonspecific phosphorylation/retained radioactivity activity in the absence of inhibiting compound and enzyme. Typically one observes approximately 1% of Total CPMs that are "nonspecific".<br>
3.	By determining the "total" and "nonspecific" CPMs for each plate, one is able to determine the % inhibition of the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate the substrate for each concentration of test compound. Use this % inhibition data to calculate an IC50 value (concentration at which a compound is able to inhibit the enzyme activity by 50%) for a compound using a non-linear curve fit program contained with the Activitybase calculation protocol (DG0027-CK1-D-BL).<br>

Cellular Orcadian Assay Experimental Procedures<br>
Cell culture: Split Mperl-luc Rat-1 fibroblasts (P2C4) cultures every 3-4 days (-10-20% confluence) onto 150 cm2 vented polystyrene tissue culture flasks (Falcon # 35-5001) and maintain in growth media [EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV); 10% fetal bovine serum (EBS; Gibco #16000-044); and 50 LUVmL penicniin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl)] at 37°C and 5% CO2. Data is presented in Table 3.<br>
Stable transfection: Co-transfect Rat-1 fibroblast cultures at 30-50% confluence with vectors containing the Zeocin resistance selectable marker for stable transfection and an mPer-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. After 24-48, hours, split the cultures onto 96 well plates and maintain in growth media supplemented with 50-100 ^g/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen #45-0430) for 10-14 days. Assess Zeocin-resistant stable transfectants for reporter expression by supplementing growth media with 100 pM luciferin (Promega #E1603) and assaying luciferase activity on a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard Model #C384V00). Synchronize Rat-1 clones expressing both Zeocin-resistance and mPerl-driven luciferase activity by 50% horse serum [HS (Gibco #16050-122)] serum shock and assess for circadian reporter activity. Select Mperl-luc Rat-1 fibroblasts clone P2C4 for compound testing. Synchronization protocol: Plate Mperl-luc Rat-1 fibroblasts (P2C4) (40-50% confluence) onto opaque 96-well tissue culture plates (PerkinElmer #6005680) and maintain in growth media supplemented with 100 jig/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen #45-0430) until cultures reach 100% confluence (48-72 h). Synchronize cultures with 100 pL synchronization media [EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV); 100 LU./mL penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl); 50% HS (Gibco #16050-122)] for 2 hours at 37°C and 5% C02. After synchronization, rinse cultures with 100 \\L EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After rinse, replace media with 300 |oL C02-independent media [C02I (Gibco #18045-088); 2mM L-glutamine (Cellgro #25-005-Cl); 100 LU7mL penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl); 100 pM luciferin (Promega #E1603)]. Add compounds to be tested for circadian effects to<br><br>
COz-independent media in 0.3% DMSO (final concentration). Seal cultures immediately with TopSeal-A film (Packard #6005185) and transfer for luciferase activity measurement Automated Circadian Reporter Measurement: After synchronization, maintain assay plates at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator (Forma Scientific Model #3914). Estimate in vivo luciferase activity by measuring relative light output on a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard Model #C384V00). Transfer plates from incubator to reader using an ORCA robotic arm (Beckman Instruments) and SAMI-NT automated scheduling software (Version 33; SAGIAN/Beckman Instruments).<br>
Data Analysis: Use Microsoft Excel and XLfit (Version 2.0.9; IDBS) to import, manipulate and graph data. Perform period analysis either by determining the interval between relative light output minima over several days or by Fourier Transform. Both methods produce nearly identical period estimation over a range of circadian periods.  Report potency as  which is the effective micromolar concentration that induces a 1 hour lengthening of period. Analyze the data by fitting a hyperbolic curve to the data expressed as period change-(y-axis) versus the concentration of test compound (x-axis) in XLfit and interpolate the from<br>
this curve.<br>
Rat Circadian Cycle Assay<br>
This assay provides a means for assessing the effect of a test compound on circadian cycle in vivo. Use male Wistar rats (Charles River) with a starting body mass of 200-250 g. House each animal individually prior to testing in a controlled environment and maintain a thermoneutral ambient temperature of 24-28 °C under a 12/12 hour (h) light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00 h), and give standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum. Implant each rat with an intra-abdominal biotelimetry transmitter (Minnimitter-VMFH, series 4000, Sunriver, OR) to monitor core body temperature and general activity. Implant each transmitter as per the manufacturer's recommendations under ketamine/xylazine (78/13 mg kg"1, ip) general anesthesia and allow the animals to recover for 7-10 days. After the recovery period, to establish each animal's internal circadian cycle, place the animals in a constant dark cycle (0/24 h light/dark cycle) and allow the animals to go into free run for 7-10 days prior to test compound administration. During the dosing regimen, animals receive either vehicle or compound (ip, sc, or po) at specific CTs (Circadian Times) over a 48 hour period.   Monitor the animals for 5 to 7 days in a constant dark cycle (0/24 h light/dark cycle) after completion<br><br>
of the dosing regimen. For each experiment, sample abdominal temperature and general activity data at 5-minute intervals. For analysis, use the VitalView and Actiview software supplied by Minimitter. Plot observed abdominal temperatures obtained for each rat on the first day on a horizontal line. Align the line of observed abdominal temperatures below an abscissa line with circadian time (x-axis). Plot observed abdominal temperatures for each successive day as individual lines in a similar manner to provide the ordinate (y-axis, in days). Connect the initial rise of core body temperature that occurs each day with a straight line, which allows the use of multiple days to estimate the circadian phase on any given day for each individual rat Determine the effect of treatment on phase by using the straight line multi-day estimation of phase before and after dosing. Treatment with an active compound will cause a greater displacement between the straight line connecting the daily initial rise of core body temperature before compound treatment and the straight line connecting the initial rise of core body temperature after compound treatment versus the vehicle control before and   after treatment lines. Calculate the difference between those phases projected onto the day prior to dosing for the treated animals. Use ANOVA, together with Students t test, to compare mean body temperature circadian shifts in minutes between groups.<br>
