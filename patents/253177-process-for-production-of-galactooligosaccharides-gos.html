Section 10<br>
Process for Production of Galactooligosaccharides (GOS)<br>
Tata Chemical Limited, Leela Business Park, Andheri Khurla Road, Andheri (E) Mumbai, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The instant application relates to the field of oligosaccharides, more specifically to the field of galactooligosaccharides. More particularly the instant application describes the process for producing galactooligosaccharides by hydrolysis of lactose.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
Number of processes have been described for the production of galactooligosaccharide by the hydrolysis of lactose for galactosidase enzyme obtained from different microbial sources (Bacteria, Fungi, and Yeast).<br>
Currently, galactooligosaccharide production is by batch processing. The increasing demand for functional oligosaccharide in various application (Food and beverages) emphasize that the purity and yield needs to be improved by developing new process.<br>
The use of immobilized enzyme allows enzyme to reuse in continuous operation (Akiyama et. al, 2001, Ribu et. al., 2001, Tzortiz et. al., 2005, Jorgensen et al, 2001, EP00272095A2, US5032509, Carra et al., 1994, Torres et al, 2003, Sumgur and Akbulut, 1993).<br>
Enzyme ß-galactosidase was immobilized by entrapment (Mannarella and Rubiolo 2005, Rodriguez-Nogales and Delgadillo, 2005) and in membrane (Novalli et al, 2005). Shin et al, 1998 used chitosan beads for immobilization of ß-galalctosidase for continuous production of galactooligosaccharides. Beddows et al, use p-amino-carbonillated cellulose acetate derivative for immobilization of b-galactosidase. While, Torres et al, (2003) compared immobilization of B-galactosidase commercially available amino-epoxy sepabeads with conventional epoxy supports.<br>
The galactooligosaccharide solution obtained after hydrolysis of lactose with ß-galactosidase contains a mixture galactooligosaccharides, unreacted lactose, and secondary products such as glucose and galactose. To obtain galactooligosaccharides having high activity, mono and disaccharides needs to be separated<br>
Activated carbon is most commonly used in industry to purify the product. Sugar solution is passed through activated carbon to adsorb saccharides  Adsorption of saccharides depends upon<br><br>
the molecular weight. Low molecular saccharides preferentially adsorb first. Low molecular weight saccharides (mono and disaccharides are eluted first with water or low concentration of ethanol and the galactooligosaccharides is eluted with high concentration of ethanol. However, this method has several disadvantages (1) separation based on the molecular weight is not efficient. (2)Yield of galactooligosaccharides is extremely poor. (3) Use of ethanol lead to increased expenses.<br>
Rastal et al., used Nanofiltration with 10KD NMWCO cut off membrane for the separation of sachharides. A gel filtration method has been used to separate sugars based on the molecular size using dextran, cellulose, and polyacrylamide based on three-dimensional linking. However, this method is used only in laboratory scale because the gels are stable for short time and not applicable for industrial scale due to poor separation in increased loading and expensive gel. Strong cation exchange polystyrene divinylbenzene resins of Na/Ca with SO3 group (UBK530) have been used for separation saccharides (EP00272095)<br>
Polymers of no ion exchange group can be used for separation of oligosaccharides (JP 130297/1986). In this method saccharides are eluted with water or by concentration gradient of water and alcohol based on the differences in the affinities of the saccharides and the adsorbent in order of molecular weight. However, this method is inefficient, expensive and impractical because (1) elution with water requires too much time for galactosaccharides (2) Purity and recovery yield is low.<br>
Splechenta et.al., studied the option of oxidizing the residual lactose to lactobionic acid by the cellobiose dehydrogenase produced from Sclerotium rolfsii fungi. Lactobionic acid and monosaccharides were separated using ion exchange chromatography. The final product contained 97% GOS, 1.2% lactose, 2.1% monosacharides while the yield of GOS was 25% of original lactose.<br>
To reduce the cost of galactooligosacchardes production, more than 50% of unreacted lactose needs to be recycled. However, the presence of mono-saccharides (glucose and Galactose) as<br><br>
8)	Concentration of the product in Rota vapor<br>
9)	Reuse of recovered lactose to further increase galactooligosaccharide production.<br>
The different stages would be discussed in detail in the following section along with examples of the preferred embodiments.<br>
The microorganisms from the dairy waste were isolated on YEM medium of the following composition; Yeast extract, malt extract, dextrose and peptone. The isolated microorganisms were screened for the lactose hydrolysis leading to the production of galactooligosaccharides. The yeast culture showing highest galactooligosaccharide producer was selected. To optimize the growth medium, the medium was supplemented with Mg++ and Fe++ ions. The concentration of Mg++  and Fe++ varied between 0.01-0.1% and 0.001-0.05% respectively. The effect of pH &amp; temperature on the hydrolysis by the free cells was investigated. The galactooligosaccharide production is not affected with the change in pH from 4,5 and 6.0. While galactooligosaccharide production increased with increase in temperature from 30 °C to 50 °C the increase in temperature.<br>
Microbial cell biomass was harvested from shaker flask and fermentor by centrifugation when the ß-galactosidase enzyme activity reached maximum. The harvested cell biomass was sonicated to extract crude enzym. Crude enzyme was further subjected to ammonium sulfate (60-80%) precipitation for purification of enzyme. The precipiated enzyme was dissolved and dialyzed to remove salts. Purified enzyme was concentrated to dry powder by lyophilization.<br>
Shin et al., observed 55% galactooligosaccharides during continuous production process where ß-galactosidase was immobilized in chitosan beads. Albayrak and Yang (2002) immobilized the ß-galactosidase enzyme on the fibrous matrix using polyethylenimine and glutarldehyde as cross linking agents. They claimed that formation of two layers of PEI-enzyme aggregates prevent enzyme leaching unlike in the monolayer (Bahulekar et al.,) . Also, they claimed that use of fibrous cotton as immobilizing matrix is safest, fastest and cheapest. The use of PEI and GDA may not be absolutely safe as they may leach out in the industrial scale production and may be a serious problem as they are carcinogenic. Because of the forthcoming strict regulation, it is necessary<br><br>
to develop the process where the carcinogenic cross linking agents are not used in the immobilization of enzyme, particularly where they are used in the food industry. The immobilization of the enzyme is on a polymer resin matrices with functional groups. As a preferred embodiment the crude/purified ß-galactosidase enzyme is immobilized on NR 2 resin, Thermax India Ltd.; wherein PEI and GDA are not used as cross linking agents.<br>
In the present process GOS production is not affected with the changes in the pH.5 -7.0. In accordance with the fourth embodiment, lactose was dissolved in the distilled water instead of buffers. This eliminates the process of removal of salts of inorganic and organic acids used in the buffer.<br>
The immobilized enzyme resin on NR 2 resin is used in the shaker flask stirred tank reactor or packed in the jacketed glass column for continuous production. Chockchaisawasdee et al., (2004) used batch and continuous ultrafiltration membrane fixed bioreactors for the production of galactooligosaccharides.<br>
The hydrolysis of lactose is carried out on aqueous solution of lactose. In a preferred embodiment the aqueous lactose solution (10-90% by weight) is passed through a column (45 ml/min) packed with immobilized B-galactosidase enzyme (mg/g of resin). Column temperature is maintained at 45 °C by circulating hot water (45 °C) in the outer jacket of the column. The sugar solution coming out of column typically contains the saacharides of the following compositions; 30-50% galactooligosaccharides, 10-15 % glucose, 30-50% lactose and 5-10% galactose.<br>
NR 2 resins has strong affinity to the enzymes and hence the enzyme do not leach out. Therefore, in accordance with seventh embodiment of the present invention, the immobilized resin is used in continuous production of GOS in the CSTR or columns for more than 100 days. Thus, this makes the process cost effective.<br><br>
The resin of Na, K, and Ca form composed of styrene divinyl benzene copolymer and SO3 as exchange group. Saccharides are eluted with hot water (60 °C). Sacchardies of larger molecular size, which are not cross linked, are eluted first, using above strong cation resin bases separation of the components of the saccharide solution by the molecular size exclusion effect.<br>
To separate saccharides efficiently the saccharide solution applied to the column should be preferably 25 to 80% total sugar concentration. Hot water is passed through the column to elute the saccharides.<br>
The strong acid cation exchange resin, TULSION from Thermax India Ltd., used in the separation of saccharides has excellent resistance to compression, good durability, and superior operating properties and low price suitable for industrial applications. The hot water used as elutant in place of organic solvents used in activated carbon column negates the requirement of equilibration with water after each cycle. Therefore, continuous purification can be easily performed with good efficiency resulting in increased purity and yield of galactooligosaccharides.<br>
It is a preferred embodiment of the invention that lactose rich fraction be recycled again in cation exchange column for increased purity of galactooligosaccharides. Galactooligosaccharide fraction more than 50% was passed through ultrafiltration to remove any suspended particles and concentrated in Rota vapor to obtain the syrup with 75-80% total sugar concentration and fraction rich in mono and disaccharide solution can be recycled as carbon source in the growth of cell biomass to produce the enzyme.<br>
The process disclosed in the instant application produces galactooligosaccharides of high purity and yield.<br>
The various stages of the process for production of oligosaccharides as disclosed in the instant application shall now be described with the help of some examples. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that the process followed in the examples may be varied without deviating from the spirit of the invention and hence examples only broadly represent the invention's embodiments.<br><br>
