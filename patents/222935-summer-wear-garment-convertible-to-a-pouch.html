TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to convertible garments, more particularly to an upper torso<br>
garment and lower torso garment that can be folded and converted into a self-contained pouch in<br>
order to be easy to use, carry and travel with.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
People who are enjoying the sun and the water usually are doing so on vacation or after<br>
having planned an outing at the beach or by the pool. In these situations, swimwear is the<br>
appropriate article of clothing to wear and, at times, it is the most amount of clothing worn.<br>
However, when off the beach, social mores, public rules and convention require people to cover<br>
up in public. For example, many restaurants require patrons to be clothed before entering their<br>
establishment. These minor distractions from the main purpose of the trip, which is to be in the<br>
sun or the water, require one to find garments to put on and cover up the body.<br>
Covering up should be effortless and as easy as possible, in order to make the transition<br>
from on-beach to off-beach attire quick. However, most outer garments, are bulky, and it is an<br>
inconvenience to carry them to the beach. It is often an annoyance to have to go back to one's<br>
hotel or motel room to change into outer garments. The transition is further made difficult by<br>
cover up apparel that absorb water and sun tan lotion.<br>
Many women and young girls like to wear bikinis or two piece bathing suits at the beach<br>
or pool. In recent years, thong bikinis have become popular. While fashionable at the beach,<br>
such outfits are inappropriate for wear on the public streets. Some modest form of lightweight<br>
outer garment, such as a pair of shorts or a mini-skirt with a matching top, which can be folded<br>
into a small pouch not much larger than the palm of the hand for storage and transport, would be<br>
desirable. It is further desirable that the garment be fashionable, and appropriate for<br>
summerwear or activewear.<br>
Further, in order to maximize space during travel, articles of clothing that are<br>
multifunctional or that can be easily folded and carried are desirable. Convertible garments have<br>
been developed which convert clothing for the lower body to clothing for the upper body, to<br>
convert long garments into shorter garments, to convert pants to skirts and even jackets into<br>
bags.<br>
French Patent Number 2,589,334, published on May, 1987, describes a jacket that is<br>
convertible into a bag. The jacket is converted into a purse by two pockets that are zippered on<br>
all four edges. The purse provides a zippered pocket on the purse's external panel and it has a<br>
strap to hold the purse across the wearer's body. French Patent Number 2,819,384 published on<br>
July 19, 2002, describes a convertible first garment having a pouch to hold a second outwear<br>
garment that can be worn over the first garment.<br>
A number of convertible articles of clothing have been developed that allow the article to<br>
be used for more than one purpose. U.S. Patent Publication Number 2002/0088047, published<br>
on July 11, 2002, describes a convertible article of clothing that can be worn either on the upper<br>
body or the lower body. U.S. Patent Number 4,106,125, issued to Palumbo on August 15, 1978<br>
describes a skirt or dress that can be converted into shorts or pants, and vice versa, by joining<br>
front and rear panels at the crotch region.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,774,892, issued to Tisdale et al. on July 7, 1998, describes<br>
convertible clothing that uses zippers to transform pants and long-sleeved shirts into shorts and<br>
short-sleeve shirts, respectively. European Patent Number EP 1,149,539, published on October<br>
31, 2001, describes a trouser that is convertible into a skirt by selectively fastening vertical<br>
edges of the leg sleeves.<br>
Jackets that convert into other articles are disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 4,103,377,<br>
issued to Mayer et al. on August 1, 1978 (parka that doubles as a sleeping bag); U.S. Patent<br>
Number 5,815,833, issued to Kuo on October 6, 1998 (three in one article that converts to a<br>
sleeping bag, a jacket and a carrying bag); U.S. Patent Number 4,347,629, issued to Itoi on<br>
September 7, 1982 (jacket that can be converted into a bag); U.S. Patent Number 5,165,111,<br><br>
issued to Lieberman on November 24, 1992 (jacket integrated into a back pack and used in<br>
conjunction with the backpack while it is worn); U.S. Patent Number 5,860,164, issued to<br>
Johnson on January 19, 1999 (multi-purpose garment convertible into a tote-bag or back-pack);<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,405,377, issued to Davis on June 18, 2002 (jacket convertible into a tote-<br>
 bag or back-pack).<br>
None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen<br>
to describe the instant invention as claimed. Thus a summerwear garment convertible into a<br>
pouch solving the aforementioned problems is desired.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a summerwear garment convertible into a pouch for storage and<br>
\ transport. The garment includes a lower torso garment having a front, a back and opposing<br>
sides. The lower torso garment is adapted for covering a lower portion of a human torso. The<br>
summerwear garment has a pair of rectangular pockets. The pockets have an open top edge, two<br>
side edges and a bottom edge. The two side edges and the bottom edge are attached to each of<br>
the sides of the lower torso garment. Mating halves of a zipper fastener continuously extend<br>
around only the two side edges and the bottom edge of the pockets, respectively. When the<br>
mating halves of the zipper fastener are joined and zipped around the two side edges and the<br>
bottom edge, the lower torso garment is folded between the pockets.<br><br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The summerwear garment convertible into a pouch is a pair of shorts or a mini-skirt<br>
which is convertible into a pouch, together with a matching top which can be folded and stored<br>
in a pocket on the shorts or skirt in order to be easy to use, carry and travel with. The shorts or<br>
skirt has a pair of matching pockets on opposite sides. The two pockets each have an open top<br>
side and three edges that are fixed to the sides of the lower torso garment. Each pocket has<br>
corresponding zipper stringers bordering the three fixed side edges. When the zipper stringers<br>
are mated, the three edges of both pockets abut the other to form a pouch containing the folded<br>
lower torso garment and the upper torso garment. Women would use the lower torso garment<br>
and the upper torso garment combination; if desired, men could use the lower torso garment<br>
alone, or also in combination with a top.<br>
The summerwear garment convertible into a pouch is designated generally as 20 in the<br>
drawings, as shown in Figs. 1-9. The summerwear 20 has lower torso garment 20b to cover the<br>
lower portion of the torso and an upper torso garment 20a to cover the chest. In the preferred<br>
embodiment the upper torso garment is a tank top 20a with the midriff cropped off, and the<br>
lower torso garment is a pair of shorts 20b. The shorts 20b and tank top 20a can be styled for<br>
wear by women, or for wear by men. If desired, men can wear the shorts 20b without the tank<br>
top 20a.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, an elastic waistband 26 is sewn into a seam at the top of the shorts 20b<br>
to encircle the waist and retain the shorts 20b on the wearer's body, while two legs 28 extend<br>
from the shorts 20b, defining leg openings at the bottom end of the shorts 20b. The shorts 20b<br>
are preferably short-shorts, with the legs terminating at the top of the thigh. The shorts 20b are<br>
preferably short-shorts, with the legs terminating at the top of the thigh. A pocket 30 is located<br>
on the left side and right side of the shorts 20b, at each leg 28, just at or just below the hips.<br>
Zipper fastener 22 borders three consecutive fixed edges of the pockets 30. Zipper fastener 22<br>
may be made from metal, or from plastic. A tie fastener 24 is disposed on the open top side of<br>
each pocket 30, at about half an inch (1 cm) from its top. The tie 24 releasably constricts the<br>
opening of the pocket.<br>
The shorts 20b may be formed in a variety of ways, for example, the shorts 20b may be<br>
formed by a left panel and a right panel joined by front and rear seams and by inseams along the<br>
left and right leg sleeves 28. Alternatively, the left and right panels may be further formed by<br>
front and rear portions joined by side seams, so that the lower torso garment comprises left front,<br>
left rear, right front, and right rear panels. Still further, instead of left and right panels, in some<br>
embodiments the shorts 20b may be formed solely by front and back panels joined by side<br>
seams.<br>
The tank top 20a has a neck opening 23a and shoulder straps 21 a. The shoulder straps<br>
21a are preferably of the type known as "finger" straps or "spaghetti" straps, and may be formed<br>
by a single cord that is looped through seams disposed on front and back panels of the tank top<br>
20a, exiting at the ends of the front and back panels to form the shoulder straps 21a, and having<br>
opposite ends of the cord exit the seams at the front of the neck opening 23a. This allows the<br>
cord forming the shoulder straps to be loosened or tightened as required to adjust for chest size.<br>
The ends of the cord may be formed into a bow for decorative effect.<br>
The midriff of the tank top 20a is cropped off, so that the torso opening 23b encircles the<br>
upper torso and ends just below the bust line for females, or just below the pectorals for men,<br>
exposing the "abs" (abdominal muscles). The cord forming the shoulder straps 21 has two free<br>
ends 21b. One end 21b of the cord is inserted through a small opening on the center front seam<br>
of the neck opening to be threaded through one side of the front seam to the back seam, and<br>
returns to be threaded to the other side of the front seam of the neck opening 23a. The shoulder<br>
straps 21a are adjustable by either pulling the free ends 21b out of the seams to reduce the<br>
amount of strap 21a exposed on the shoulder or by lengthening the shoulder strap 21a and<br>
reducing the length of the free ends 21b exposed. By adjusting the amount of strap 21a used<br>
over the shoulders, the wearer is able to determine where the waist opening 23b will stop on the<br>
midriff and how much of the midriff region will be exposed. Once the appropriate shoulder<br>
strap 21a length is reached, the wearer ties the free ends of the strap 21b on the front panel of the<br>
neck opening 23a to form a bow.<br>
Fig. 2 shows one side of the summerwear garment 20 of the present invention configured<br>
to form a pouch. The pouch is formed by the two rectangular pockets 30, each pocket 30<br>
comprising one side of the pouch, and corresponding zipper fastener 22 bordering the three<br>
consecutive fixed side edges of each pocket 30. When the zipper stringers are mated, the three<br>
consecutive fixed side edges of both pockets 30 are fastened to each other to form the pouch 20<br>
containing the folded shorts 20b and the cropped tank top 20a. The tie fastener 24 is disposed<br>
along the fourth open top side of each pocket 30. In the closed pouch configuration, the tie 24<br>
can be used as handles to easily carry the pouch on the wrist or by the fingers. The pouch is<br>
dimensioned only slightly larger than the palm of the hand, so that the summerwear garment 20<br>
is conveniently stored or transported. Representative dimensions of the pouch are between four<br>
and five inches (10-13 cm) long, between three and four inches (8-10 cm) wide, and between<br>
two and two and one-half inches (5-6 cm) thick, although the present invention need not<br>
necessarily be limited by the dimensions recited.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the zipper fastener 22 partially unzipped along one side of the pouch,<br>
revealing the shorts 20b stored inside the pouch 20. The zipper 22 is operated in conventional<br>
manner, by pulling zipper tab 22c to move the slider. Fig. 4 shows the zipper tracks 22 more<br>
than two-thirds separated, to expose the shorts 20b. The pouch is shown in an open<br>
configuration where legs 28 and waistband 26 are displayed folded between pockets 30. When<br>
the shorts 20b are fully unfolded, the pockets 30 are disposed on the left and right sides of the<br>
garment, as seen in Fig. 5. Three consecutive side edges of each pocket 30 are sewn to the sides<br>
of the shorts leaving the top side of each pocket 30 open. The open top side of each pocket 30<br>
has a seam through which the tie 24 is disposed. The tie 24 is made of two individual straps<br>
each having two ends, a free end and a fixed end. The fixed end is sewn to a side of the pocket<br>
leaving the free end to exit a center opening found on the seam. The two free ends exit the seam<br>
at the center opening, allowing the wearer to gather the seam along the tie 24 and constrict the<br>
top side of the pocket 30. Zipper stringers 22a and 22b forming the opposing sides of zipper<br>
fastener 22 are positioned on the three consecutive fixed side edges of each pocket 30. The tank<br>
top 20a is concealed and stored in either pocket 30 in a folded configuration, as seen in Fig. 6.<br>
To return the summerwear 20 to its closed pouch configuration 20, top 20a is folded and<br>
inserted into one of the pockets, as shown in Fig. 6, and the shorts 20b are folded to approximate<br>
the pockets 30, with the pin of male zipper stringer 22a being inserted into the slider of female<br>
zipper stringer 22b, zipper tab 22c being pulled to begin mating the zipper fastener 22, as shown<br>
in Fig. 7. By mating male zipper track 22a to female zipper track 22b, the shorts 20b are forced<br>
into a contracted, folded arrangement, reducing the total surface area exposed. Fig. 8 shows the<br>
zipper tab 22c being pulled approximately one-third of the way around zipper 22. The shorts 20b<br>
are folded, first by pleating the sides of the shorts 20b into the center region, then by folding the<br>
legs 28 up to the center region, and finally by folding the waistband 26 down over the legs 28, as<br>
seen in Fig. 9, compressing the lower torso garment 20b on top of itself. Once the shorts 20b are<br>
folded, in a compact state, the user is able to easily pull zipper tab 22c along the zipper 22 from<br>
one end to the other.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the upper torso garment is formed as a halter top 120a, as<br>
seen in Figs. 10A and 10B. The halter top 120a has only a front panel and a strap 121a having<br>
two free ends 121b that are used to tie the halter top 120a at the back. The strap 121a is threaded<br>
through a seam along the neck opening 123a and is fed through the sides 123c which is either<br>
constructed as seams or as loops attached to the sides 123c of the front panel. When the sides<br>
123c are constructed as seams, each strap 121 is fed down through the seams on the sides 123c<br>
of the front panel and tied across the lower back. When loops are used, the strap 121a is passed<br>
through the loops to crisscross the back like a shoelace on a shoe.<br>
Also, instead of shorts, the lower garment may be a mini-skirt. Figs. 11A and 1 IB show<br>
the mini-skirt 120b having a waistband 126 and a skirt 128 extending from the waistband. The<br>
mini-skirt 120b can be constructed by joining front and back panels at side seams, or by joining<br>
left and right panels by front and rear seams. Conversely, the mini-skirt 120b can be made using<br>
front right and left panels and rear right and left panels by joining center, rear and side seams, so<br>
that the garment is made of front left and right panels and rear left and right panels. The skirt<br>
may also be constaicted from a single piece of fabric having a single seam in the back or along<br>
one of the sides.<br>
The mini-skirt 120b has two rectangular pockets 130 positioned on its sides. Each<br>
pocket 130 has a tie 124 disposed on the open top side of each pocket 130 to constrict the<br>
opening of the pockets 130. The other three sides of each pocket 130 are sewn to the mini-skirt<br>
120b. The three consecutive fixed edges of pockets 130 are trimmed with zipper stringers 122.<br>
The alternative embodiment of the summerwear is arranged into the closed pouch 120<br>
configuration by mating male zipper track 122a to female zipper track 122b, using zipper tab<br>
122c, and folding the mini-skirt 120b similar to the folding and tucking procedure used with the<br>
preferred embodiment.<br>
The summerwear 20, 120 is preferably constructed using fabrics conventionally used<br>
with sports garments, such as polyester or polyamides, such as nylon; however other thin<br>
material can be used as well, such as silk or rayon. The fabric used can also be wrinkle-free and<br>
quick drying, since it is folded into a pouch and typically worn over a bathing suit. The<br>
importance of using thin material is to facilitate the folding and pleating of the garments within<br>
the pockets to allow the zippers tracks 22 and 122 to mate and close the invention into a pouch<br>
20, 120, as well as for making the garment lightweight.<br>
The preferred embodiments provide a summerwear garment convertible into a pouch that<br>
is small and easy to carry and travel with. The garment is convertible into a pouch that is thin<br>
and flexible enough to be folded into a pouch to take up very little space. The garment<br>
preferably is quick-drying and wrinkle-free, and fashionable.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment<br>
described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the following<br>
