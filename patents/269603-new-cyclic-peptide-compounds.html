DESCRIPTION<br>
NEW CYCLIC PEPTIDE COMPOUNDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a new cyclic peptide compound or a salt thereof having inhibitory activity against .the RNA replication of hepatitis C virus (hereafter referred to as HCV) replicon.  In particular, the present invention relates to a new cyclic peptide compound or a salt thereof, to a process for preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the new cyclic peptide compound or a salt thereof, and to a method for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of hepatitis C in a human being or animal*<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The estimated number of HCV carriers is about 170 million worldwide (about 3%) and about 1.5 million in Japan. Even in the combination therapy of using interferon (hereafter referred to as IFN) and ribavirin (Virazole), available as a first option for treatment, its effectiveness is 40% for all types of HCV.  Furthermore, its effectiveness is only 15 to 20% for IFN-resistant virus (genotype lb), particularly abundantly found in Japan. On the other hand, the combination therapy has side effects frequently*  It is thus difficult to get rid of the virus completely by using currently available treatment methods. In the case when chronic hepatitis cannot be cured completely, the hepatitis will securely develop into cirrhosis hepatitis (30%) or hepatocellular carcinoma (25%).  In Europe and the United States, hepatitis C has been a major indication for liver transplant. However, the redevelopment of HCV occurs frequently even in transplanted livers.  For these reasons, the needs for new agents being improved in both effectiveness<br><br>
and safety, having higher antiviral effects and capable of inhibiting hepatitis C are very strong in society.<br>
HCV is a virus having plus-strand RNA as a gene and is classified into Flaviviridae in accordance with the analysis of the base sequence of the gene. Ac'cording to Fields Virology fourth edition, D. Knipe et al ed., Philadelphia, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins 2001, 1127-1161, although the existence of HCV was anticipated in 1970s, the discovery of HCV was very difficult.  HCV was called non~A non-B hepatitis virus for many years.  In 1989, according to Choo Q-L et al-, Science 244, 359-362 (1989), part of the gene of this virus was cloned from the serum of an infected laboratory animal, and its cDNA sequence was identified and confirmed, whereby the virus was named "HCV."<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cyclosporin A is used as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant. M.   Thali et al., Nature 372, 363-365 (1994) reported that Cyclosporin A had anti-HIV activity by inhibiting the interaction between Cyclosporin A and the virus particle forming protein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). R. M, Wenger et al. reported in WOOO/01715 that their novel cyclosporins has the anti-HIV activity.  Furthermore, K. Inoue et al., 6th International Symposium on Hepatitis C and Related Virus, 3-6 June (2000) Bethesda, MD, USA reported that Cyclosporin A had an anti~HCV activity, however, reports for supporting this finding are not presented by other groups up until now. And HIJIKATA et al. reported in WO2005/021028 that their modified cyclosporins have the anti-HCV activity.<br>
M. Berenguer et al., J. Hepatol 32, 673-684 (2000) reported that the clinical use of Cyclosporin A serving as an immunosuppressant caused HCV to multiply in transplant patients.<br><br>
Hence, an anti-hepatitis C agent improved in the activity, transition in blood, selectivity and the side effects, for example, in comparison with Cyclosporin A, has been demanded because of the above-mentioned reasons.<br>
Further, in order to convert the skeleton of the Cyclosporine compounds, it needs some severe conditions such as high temperature or high pressure. On the other hand, the conversion of the starting compound (FR901459 compound) to our compounds by a rearrangement reaction in the present invention needs the mild acidic condition because of the hydroxyl group on the 2-position of the starting compound.<br>

V. Lohmann et al., Science 285, 110-113 (1999) reported that they prepared human hepatoma cell lines (Huh-7) in which subgenomic HCV RNA molecules were introduced, and found that subgenomic HCV RNA was replicated in the cells at a high rate. It is thought that the replication mechanism of the subgenomic HCV RNA in these cell lines is extremely similar to the replication of full length HCV RNA genome in hepatic cells infected with HCV.  Hence, the method for evaluating the activity of the compound (I) for inhibiting RNA replication in accordance with the present invention is based on the cellular assay method that uses Huh-7 cells in which subgenomic HCV RNA is introduced•<br>
In order to show the usefulness of the compound (I) or a salt thereof in the present invention, a pharmacological test example of representative compounds in the present application is shown as follows.<br>
Test example<br>
1, HCV replicon reporter assay<br>
The inhibitory activity.of the test compounds against the replication of HCV replicon was evaluated by quantified the activity of luciferase, a reporter gene product encoded in the replicon syetem reported by Yokota et al., EMBO 4:<br><br>
602-608 (2003).  The enzyme assay was carried out according to the technical manual of the Steady-Glo® luciferase assay system (Promega).  The replicon assay was carried out with the modified method reported by Lohmann et al., Science 285: 110 (1999) . The details are described in the following,<br>
1)	Addition of agent to cells<br>
6 x 103 HCV replicon cells in D-MEM medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum were seeded in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Inc.). After the cells were incubated at 37°C for 16 hours in 5% CO2, the test compound was added.<br>
2)	Luciferase assay procedure<br>
After cultivation for two more days, the culture medium was removed and 25 |j,l of Glo Lysis buffer was added to each well and incubated for 5 minutes. Allowing lysis to occur, 25 (il of Steady-Glo® assay reagent was added to each well. After incubation for 5 minutes, the luminescence was measured with a luminometer, Mithras LB940 (BERTHOLD TECHNOLOGIES GmbH &amp; Co.KG)following the manufacturer's instructions.<br><br>
3) Test result<br>
The luciferase activities in replicon cells treated at each concentrations of the compound were employed for the calculation of EC50 value of the each compound, which gave the compound concentration indicating 50% enzyme activity level to the control (no drug group, containing only DMSO).<br><br>
