				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Method for producing a dialkyl carbonate and a diol<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing a dialkyl carbonate and a diol. More par-<br>
ticularly, the present invention is concerned with a<br>
method for producing a dialkyl carbonate and a diol,<br>
comprising: (a) effecting a transesterification reac-<br>
tion between a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic mono-<br>
hydric alcohol in the presence of a transesterification<br>
catalyst, thereby obtaining a reaction mixture contain-<br>
ing a product dialkyl carbonate and a product diol, (b)<br>
withdrawing a dialkyl carbonate-containing liquid from<br>
the reaction mixture, followed by separation of the<br>
dialkyl carbonate from the dialkyl carbonate-containing<br>
liquid, and (c) withdrawing a diol-containing liquid<br>
from the reaction mixture, followed by separation of<br>
the diol from the diol-containing liquid, wherein the<br>
cyclic carbonate contains a cyclic ether in an amount<br>
of from 0.1 to 3,000 ppm by weight, and the product<br>
dialkyl carbonate contains a carbonate ether in an<br>
amount of not more than 10,000 ppm by weight. In the<br>
dialkyl carbonate produced by the method of the present<br>
invention, the content of a carbonate ether (which is a<br><br>
conventionally unknown impurity) is reduced to a spe-<br>
cific low range. The dialkyl carbonate obtained by the<br>
method of the present invention can be used to produce<br>
a transesterification aromatic carbonate. The trans-<br>
esterification aromatic carbonate produced can be very<br>
advantageously used to produce a colorless, high mo-<br>
lecular weight aromatic polycarbonate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] With respect to the method for producing a<br>
dialkyl carbonate and a diol by reacting a cyclic car-<br>
bonate with an aliphatic monohydric alcohol, various<br>
proposals have been made. Most of those proposals re-<br>
late to the development of catalysts for the above re-<br>
action. Examples of such catalysts include alkali met-<br>
als or basic compounds containing alkali metals (see<br>
Patent Documents 1 and 2), tertiary aliphatic amines<br>
(see Patent Document 3), thallium compounds (see Patent<br>
Document 4), tin alkoxides (see Patent Document 5),<br>
alkoxides of zinc, aluminum and titanium (see Patent<br>
Document 6), a mixture of a Lewis acid with a nitrogen<br>
-containing organic base (see Patent Document 7),<br>
phosphine compounds (see Patent Document 8), quaternary<br>
phosphonium salts (see Patent Document 9), cyclic<br>
amidines (see Patent Document 10), compounds of zirco-<br><br>
nium, titanium and tin (see Patent Document 11), a<br>
solid, strongly basic anion-exchanger containing a qua-<br>
ternary ammonium group (see Patent Document 12), a<br>
solid catalyst selected from the group consisting of a<br>
tertiary amine- or quaternary ammonium group-containing<br>
ion-exchange resin, a strongly acidic or a weakly<br>
acidic ion-exchange resin, a silica impregnated with a<br>
silicate of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal,<br>
and a zeolite exchanged with ammonium ion (Patent Docu-<br>
ment 13), and a homogeneous catalyst selected from the<br>
group consisting of tertiary phosphine, tertiary arsine,<br>
tertiary stibine, a divalent sulfur compound and a se-<br>
lenium compound (see Patent Document 14).<br>
[0003] With respect to the method for conducting the<br>
above-mentioned reaction between a cyclic carbonate and<br>
a diol, the below-mentioned four types of methods (1)<br>
to (4) have conventionally been proposed. Hereinbelow,<br>
explanation is made with respect to such methods (1) to<br>
(4), taking as an example the production of dimethyl<br>
carbonate and ethylene glycol by the reaction between<br>
ethylene carbonate and methanol, which is a representa-<br>
tive example of reactions between cyclic carbonates and<br>
diols.<br>
[0004] First method (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"method (1)") is a completely batchwise method in which<br><br>
ethylene carbonate,, methanol and a catalyst are fed to<br>
an autoclave as a batchwise reaction vessel, and a re-<br>
action is performed at a reaction temperature higher<br>
than the boiling point of methanol under pressure for a<br>
predetermined period of time (see Patent Documents 1, 2<br>
and 5 to 9).<br>
[0005] Second method (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"method (2)") is a batchwise method, using an apparatus<br>
comprising a reaction vessel provided at an upper por-<br>
tion thereof with a distillation column, in which eth-<br>
ylene carbonate, methanol and a catalyst are fed to the<br>
reaction vessel, and a reaction is performed by heating<br>
the contents of the reaction vessel to a predetermined<br>
temperature. In this method, in order to compensate<br>
for the methanol distilled as an azeotropic mixture of<br>
the methanol and the produced dimethyl carbonate, the<br>
continuous or batchwise addition of supplemental metha-<br>
nol to the reaction vessel is optionally conducted.<br>
However, irrespective of whether or not such an addi-<br>
tion of supplemental methanol is conducted, the reac-<br>
tion per se is performed only in a batch-type reaction<br>
vessel. That is, in this method, the reaction is<br>
batchwise performed under reflux for a prolonged period<br>
of time as long as 3 to 20 odd hours. (Patent Docu-<br>
ments 15, 3 and 4).<br><br>
[0006] Third method (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"method (3)") is a liquid flow method in which a solu-<br>
tion of ethylene carbonate in methanol is continuously<br>
fed to a tubular reactor to perform a reaction at a<br>
predetermined reaction temperature in the tubular reac-<br>
tor, and the resultant reaction mixture in a liquid<br>
form containing the unreacted materials (i.e., ethylene<br>
carbonate and methanol) and the reaction products (i.e.,<br>
dimethyl carbonate and ethylene glycol) is continuously<br>
withdrawn through an outlet of the reactor. This<br>
method has conventionally been conducted in two differ-<br>
ent manners in accordance with the two types of cata-<br>
lyst used. That is, one of the manners consists in<br>
passing a mixture of a solution of ethylene carbonate<br>
in methanol and a solution of a homogenous catalyst in<br>
a solvent through a tubular reactor to perform a reac-<br>
tion, thereby obtaining a reaction mixture, and sepa-<br>
rating the catalyst from the obtained reaction mixture<br>
(see Patent Documents 11 and 14). The other manner<br>
consists in performing the reaction in a tubular reac-<br>
tor having a heterogeneous catalyst securely placed<br>
therein (see Patent Documents 12 and 13). Since the<br>
reaction between ethylene carbonate and methanol to<br>
produce dimethyl carbonate and ethylene glycol is an<br>
equilibrium reaction, the flow method using a tubular<br><br>
reactor cannot achieve a higher conversion of ethylene<br>
carbonate than the conversion of ethylene carbonate at<br>
the equilibrium state of reaction (the latter conver-<br>
sion depends on the composition ratio of the feedstocks<br>
fed to the reactor and the reaction temperature). For<br>
example, in Example 1 of Patent Document 11 which is<br>
directed to a continuous flow reaction method using a<br>
tubular reactor and wherein the flow reaction is con-<br>
ducted at 130 o C using a feedstock mixture having a<br>
methanol/ethylene carbonate molar ratio of 4/1, the<br>
conversion of ethylene carbonate is only 25 %. This<br>
means that large amounts of unreacted ethylene carbon-<br>
ate and unreacted methanol, which are contained in the<br>
reaction mixture, need to be separated and recovered,<br>
which in turn are recycled to the reactor. Actually,<br>
in the method disclosed in Patent Document 13, various<br>
apparatuses are used for the separation, purification,<br>
recovery and recycling of the unreacted compounds.<br>
[0007] Fourth method (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"method (4)") is a reactive distillation method in<br>
which each of ethylene carbonate and methanol is con-<br>
tinuously fed to a multi-stage distillation column to<br>
perform a reaction in a plurality of stages of the dis-<br>
tillation column in the presence of a catalyst, while<br>
continuously effecting separation between the produced<br><br>
dimethyl carbonate ,and the produced ethylene glycol<br>
(Patent Documents 16 to 19).<br>
[0008] Thus, the conventional methods for producing a<br>
dialkyl carbonate and a diol by reacting a cyclic car-<br>
bonate with an aliphatic monohydric alcohol, can be<br>
classified into the following four methods:<br>
(1)	A completely batchwise method;<br>
(2)	A batchwise method using a reaction vessel pro-<br>
vided at an upper portion thereof with a distillation<br>
column;<br>
(3)	A liquid flow method using a tubular reactor; and<br>
(4)	A reactive distillation method.<br>
However, the above-mentioned conventional methods<br>
(1) to (4) have their respective problems as described<br>
below.<br>
[0009] In the case of each of the completely batchwise<br>
method (1) and the flow method (3) using a tubular re-<br>
actor, the maximum conversion of a cyclic carbonate<br>
depends on the composition ratio of the feedstocks fed<br>
to the reactor and the reaction temperature. Therefore,<br>
it is impossible to convert all of the feedstocks into<br>
the products and the conversion of the cyclic carbonate<br>
becomes low. Further, in the batchwise method (2), for<br>
improving the conversion of a cyclic carbonate, the<br>
produced dialkyl carbonate must be removed using a<br><br>
largely excess amount of an aliphatic monohydric alco-<br>
hol, and a long reaction time is needed.<br>
[0010] In the case of the reactive distillation method<br>
(4), it is possible to perform a reaction with high<br>
conversion, as compared to the conversions in methods<br>
(1), (2) and (3). However, needless to say, even in<br>
the case of method (4), production of a dialkyl carbon-<br>
ate and a diol is performed by a reversible, equilib-<br>
rium reaction. Accordingly, even when it is possible<br>
to achieve a substantially 100 % conversion of a cyclic<br>
carbonate by method (4), it is impossible to prevent a<br>
trace amount of the cyclic carbonate from remaining<br>
unreacted in a produced diol. Therefore, for obtaining<br>
a high purity diol by method (4), in general, it is<br>
necessary to separate the cyclic carbonate from the<br>
diol by performing a distillation under strictly con-<br>
trolled conditions. In Patent Document 20, it is at-<br>
tempted to solve this problem by hydrolyzing the unre-<br>
acted cyclic carbonate to convert it into a diol.<br>
Further, in Patent Document 21, it is attempted to<br>
solve this problem by reacting the unreacted cyclic<br>
carbonate with a diol to convert it into an ether.<br>
[0011] In addition, there have been proposed methods<br>
in which water or water having an oxygen content of not<br>
more than 100 ppm is introduced into the process for<br><br>
distillation purification of a diol, to thereby obtain<br>
a high purity diol having high UV transmission or low<br>
aldehyde content (see Patent Documents 22 and 23).<br>
[0012] In the method for producing a dialkyl carbonate<br>
and a diol by reacting a cyclic carbonate with an ali-<br>
phatic monohydric alcohol, the presence of a carbonate<br>
ether described in the present invention was not known<br>
in the art. The present inventors have for the first<br>
time found that a dialkyl carbonate obtained by the<br>
above-mentioned method contains a carbonate ether and<br>
that when a dialkyl carbonate contains a carbonate<br>
ether in an amount exceeding a specific level, the re-<br>
action using such a dialkyl carbonate as a raw material<br>
poses various problems. For example, it has become ap-<br>
parent that when a transesterification aromatic carbon-<br>
ate is produced from such a conventional dialkyl car-<br>
bonate and phenol, the produced aromatic carbonate will<br>
contain impurities.<br>
[0013] As can be understood from the above, no method<br>
has heretofore been proposed for producing a dialkyl<br>
carbonate and a diol from a cyclic carbonate and an<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol, wherein the produced<br>
dialkyl carbonate contains a carbonate ether only in a<br>
content which is reduced to a specific low range.<br><br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to Be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0015] An object of the present invention is to pro-<br>
vide a method for producing a dialkyl carbonate con-<br>
taining a carbonate ether (which is a conventionally<br>
unknown impurity) only in an amount which is reduced to<br>
a specific low range, wherein the dialkyl carbonate can<br>
be used to produce a transesterification aromatic car-<br>
bonate which can be very advantageously used to produce<br>
a colorless, high molecular weight aromatic polycarbon-<br>
ate .<br>
Means to Solve the Problems<br>
[0016] In this situation, for solving the above<br>
-mentioned problems, the present inventors have made<br>
extensive and intensive studies. As a result, they<br>
have unexpectedly found that, in a method for producing<br>
a dialkyl carbonate and a diol, comprising effecting a<br>
transesterification reaction between a cyclic carbonate<br>
and an aliphatic monohydric alcohol in the presence of<br>
a transesterification catalyst, thereby producing a<br>
product dialkyl carbonate and a product diol, when the<br>
cyclic carbonate as a raw material contains a cyclic<br>
ether, a carbonate ether is by-produced and enters the<br><br>
dialkyl carborate produced. They have also found that,<br>
by reducing the cyclic ether content of the cyclic car-<br>
bonate as a raw material, the carbonate ether content<br>
of the dialkyl carbonate produced can be reduced. Spe-<br>
cifically, the present inventors have found that the<br>
above-mentioned problems can be solved by a method for<br>
producing a dialkyl carbonate and a diol, comprising:<br>
(a) effecting a transesterification reaction between a<br>
cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic monohydric alcohol in<br>
the presence of a transesterification catalyst, thereby<br>
obtaining a reaction mixture containing a product dial-<br>
kyl carbonate and a product diol, (b) withdrawing a<br>
dialkyl carbonate-containing liquid from the reaction<br>
mixture, followed by separation of the dialkyl carbon-<br>
ate from the dialkyl carbonate-containing liquid, and<br>
(c) withdrawing a diol-containing liquid from the reac-<br>
tion mixture, followed by separation of the diol from<br>
the diol-containing liquid, wherein the cyclic carbon-<br>
ate contains a cyclic ether in an amount of from 0.1 to<br>
3,000 ppm by weight, and the product dialkyl carbonate<br>
contains a carbonate ether in an amount of not more<br>
than 10,000 ppm by weight. Based on these findings,<br>
the present invention has been completed.<br>
[0017] The foregoing and other objects, features and<br>
advantages of the present invention will be apparent<br><br>
from the following detailed description taken in con-<br>
nection with the accompanying drawing, and the appended<br>
claims.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0018] In the dialkyl carbonate produced by the method<br>
of the present invention, the content of a carbonate<br>
ether (which is a conventionally unknown impurity) is<br>
reduced to a specific low range. The dialkyl carbonate<br>
obtained by the method of the present invention can be<br>
used to produce a transesterification aromatic carbon-<br>
ate. The transesterification aromatic carbonate pro-<br>
duced can be very advantageously used to produce a col-<br>
orless, high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate.<br>

phatic group, and at least one hydrogen atom<br>
of R2 is optionally replaced by at least one<br>

consisting of a C1-10 alkyl group and a C6-10<br>
aryl group.<br>

ether represented by the formula (2) below in an amount<br>

[0026]<br><br>
[0027] wherein R1 represents a divalent group<br>

of R2 is optionally replaced by at least one<br>

group.<br>
[0029] 2. The method according to item 1 above,<br>
wherein the amount of the cyclic ether in the cyclic<br>
carbonate is from 3 to 1,500 ppm by weight.<br>
[0030] 3. The method according to item 2 above,<br>
wherein the amount of the cyclic ether in the cyclic<br>
carbonate is from 10 to 1,000 ppm by weight.<br>
[0031] 4. The method according to any one of items 1<br>
to 3 above, wherein the cyclic carbonate is ethylene<br>

[0032] 5. The method according to any one of items 1<br>

[0034] 7. The dialkyl carbonate according to item 6<br>

[0035] 8. The dialkyl carbonate according to item 7<br>

dialkyl carbonate is from 10 to 3,000 ppm by weight.<br>
[0036] Hereinbelow, the present invention will be ex-<br>
plained in detail.<br>
The reaction performed in the present invention is<br>
a reversible, equilibrium transesterification reaction<br>
represented by the following reaction scheme (I), in<br>
which a dialkyl carbonate (C) and a diol (D) are pro-<br>
duced from a cyclic carbonate (A) and an aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol (B):<br>
[0037]<br><br><br>
[0038] wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above.<br>
[0039] In the present invention, the reason why the<br>
carbonate ether content of the product dialkyl carbon-<br>
ate is reduced to a specific low range has not yet been<br>
fully elucidated. However, it is considered that a<br>
carbonate ether is generated in the reaction system by<br>
the reaction between a cyclic ether and an aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol or a carbonate and, therefore, the<br>
amount of generated carbonate ether can be reduced by<br>
lowering the cyclic ether content of the cyclic carbon-<br>
ate.<br>
[0040] In the present invention, the transesterifica-<br>
tion reaction can be performed by a conventional trans-<br>
esterif ication reactor. With respect to the trans-<br>
esterif ication reactor used in the method of the<br>
present invention, there is no particular limitation,<br>
and there can be used any of various conventional types<br>
of reactors, such as a reactor comprising a combination<br>
of a fixed bed reactor and a distillation column, an<br>
agitation vessel, a multi-stage agitation type reactor<br>
comprising multiple agitation vessels, a multi-stage<br>
distillation column, and a combination of the above<br>
-mentioned reactors. These reactors can be used in ei-<br><br>
ther a batchwise manner or a continuous manner. From<br>
the viewpoint of displacing the equilibrium of the re-<br>
action toward the product system, a multi-stage distil-<br>
lation column is preferred, and a continuous multi<br>
-stage distillation column is more preferred. With re-<br>
spect to the multi-stage distillation column, there is<br>
no particular limitation as long as it is a distilla-<br>
tion column which has two or more stages of distilla-<br>
tion and which is capable of continuous distillation.<br>
In the present invention, the term "stages" is intended<br>
to include theoretical stages (theoretical plates). In<br>
the case of a distillation column having no substantive<br>
stages, such as a packed column, the value obtained by<br>
dividing the packing height by the height per theoreti-<br>
cal stage (plate) (H.E.T.P.) (height equivalent to a<br>
theoretical plate) is considered as the number of<br>
stages.<br>
[0041] Examples of such continuous multi-stage distil-<br>
lation columns include plate type columns using a tray,<br>
such as a bubble-cap tray, a sieve tray, a valve tray<br>
or a counterflow tray, and packed type columns packed<br>
with various packings, such as a Raschig ring, a Less-<br>
ing ring, a Pall ring, a Berl saddle, an Interlox sad-<br>
dle, a Dixon packing, a McMahon packing, a Heli pack, a<br>
Sulzer packing and Mellapak. Any column which is gen-<br><br>
erally used as a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column can be utilized. Further, a mixed type of plate<br>
column and packed column, which comprises both a plate<br>
portion and a portion packed with packings, can also be<br>
preferably used. When a solid catalyst which is in-<br>
soluble in the liquid phase in a distillation column is<br>
used, a packed column type distillation column, in<br>
which the solid catalyst is used in substitution for<br>
part or all of the packings, is preferably employed.<br>
As the continuous multi-stage distillation column to be<br>
used in the method of the present invention, the above<br>
-mentioned distillation columns can be used individu-<br>
ally or in combination. When used in combination, a<br>
plurality of distillation columns may be connected in<br>
series or in parallel.<br>
[0042] A cyclic carbonate used as a raw material in<br>
the method of the present invention is represented by<br>
formula (A) in reaction scheme (I) mentioned above.<br>
Examples of cyclic carbonates include alkylene carbon-<br>
ates, such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbon-<br>
ate, 1,3-dioxacyclohexa-2-one, 1,3-dioxacyclohepta-2-<br>
one, and the like. Of these cyclic carbonates, ethyl-<br>
ene carbonate and propylene carbonate are preferred<br>
because of their good availability. Ethylene carbonate<br>
is most preferred.<br><br>
[0043] In the cyclic carbonate used in the present in-<br>
vention, the content of a cyclic ether represented by<br>
the formula (1) above is preferably 3,000 ppm or less.<br>
The lower the cyclic ether content of the cyclic car-<br>
bonate, the lower the carbonate ether content of the<br>
dialkyl carbonate produced. However, for producing a<br>
cyclic carbonate having extremely low cyclic ether con-<br>
tent, the cyclic carbonate must be produced by a method<br>
employing a special purification method. Therefore, in<br>
the present invention, the cyclic ether content of the<br>
cyclic carbonate is in the range of from 0.1 to 3,000<br>
ppm, preferably from 1 to 3,000 ppm, more preferably<br>
from 3 to 1,500 ppm, most preferably from 10 to 1,000<br>
ppm.<br>
[0044] With respect to the cyclic ether content of a<br>
cyclic carbonate obtained in the prior art, attention<br>
is drawn to the following. When ethylene carbonate<br>
(which is a cyclic carbonate) is produced from ethylene<br>
oxide (which is a cyclic ether), it is generally known<br>
that the conversion of ethylene oxide is 99.0 %, and<br>
the selectivity for ethylene carbonate is 99.2 % (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,166,773, 4,786,741 and<br>
4,314,945). That is, in the prior art, the ethylene<br>
carbonate (cyclic carbonate) produced inevitably con-<br>
tains about 5,000 ppm of ethylene oxide (cyclic ether)<br><br>
which remains unreacted. Therefore, in the prior art,<br>
it is impossible to obtain the cyclic carbonate used in<br>
the method of the present invention, the cyclic carbon-<br>
ate having the cyclic ether content reduced to the<br>
above-mentioned specific range (i.e., 0.1 to 3,000 ppm).<br>
[0045] In the present invention, when ethylene carbon-<br>
ate is used as a cyclic carbonate, the ethylene carbon-<br>
ate can be produced by reacting ethylene oxide (which<br>
is a cyclic ether) with carbon dioxide. As an example<br>
of a method for producing ethylene carbonate which has<br>
the cyclic ether content reduced to the above-mentioned<br>
specific range, there can be mentioned a method in<br>
which ethylene carbonate is produced by reacting ethyl-<br>
ene oxide with carbon dioxide, wherein the ethylene<br>
oxide content of the ethylene carbonate produced is<br>
reduced by any of the following methods (a) to (6): (a)<br>
a method in which a so-called finisher (which is a<br>
small reactor) is additionally provided in the produc-<br>
tion plant for ethylene carbonate, and ethylene oxide<br>
is reacted with carbon dioxide at a conversion as high<br>
as 99.5 % or more while maintaining the selectivity for<br>
ethylene carbonate at 99.0 % or more; (β) a method in<br>
which, immediately after a reaction mixture containing<br>
ethylene carbonate is taken out from the reactor, a<br>
portion of the reaction mixture is distilled off to the<br><br>
outside of the reaction system simultaneously with<br>
evaporation-off of carbon dioxide gas; (γ) a method in<br>
which, before performing the purification of a reaction<br>
mixture containing ethylene carbonate, unreacted ethyl-<br>
ene oxide is distilled off from the reaction mixture by<br>
using a flash tank or the like; and (δ) a method in<br>
which a portion of a column top composition (containing<br>
unreacted ethylene oxide) obtained at the top of a dis-<br>
tillation column for performing the purification of<br>
ethylene carbonate is taken out of the reaction system.<br>
The above-mentioned methods (α) to (δ) may be used in-<br>
dividually; however, from the viewpoint of ease in re-<br>
ducing the cyclic ether content of a cyclic carbonate,<br>
it is preferred to use the above-mentioned methods (α)<br>
to (δ) in combination.<br>
[0046] Specific examples of cyclic ethers include eth-<br>
ylene oxide, propylene oxide, oxacyclobutane and oxacy-<br>
clopentane.<br>
[0047] An aliphatic monohydric alcohol used as another<br>
raw material in the method of the present invention is<br>
a compound which is represented by formula (B) in reac-<br>
tion scheme (I) mentioned above and has a boiling point<br>
lower than that of the diol. The type of an aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol which can be used in the method of<br>
the present invention varies depending on the type of<br><br>
the cyclic carbonate used. Examples of aliphatic mono-<br>
hydric alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol<br>
(isomers), allyl alcohol, butanol (isomers), 3-butene-<br>
1-ol, amyl alcohol (isomers), hexyl alcohol (isomers),<br>
heptyl alcohol (isomers), octyl alcohol (isomers),<br>
nonyl alcohol (isomers), decyl alcohol (isomers), unde-<br>
cyl alcohol (isomers), dodecyl alcohol (isomers),<br>
cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, cycloheptanol,<br>
cyclooctanol, methylcyclopentanol (isomers), ethyl-<br>
cyclopentanol (isomers), methylcyclohexanol (isomers),<br>
ethylcyclohexanol (isomers), dimethylcyclohexanol (iso-<br>
mers), diethylcyclohexanol (isomers), phenylcyclohexa-<br>
nol (isomers), benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol (iso-<br>
mers ), phenylpropanol (isomers) and the like. The<br>
above-mentioned aliphatic monohydric alcohol may be<br>
substituted with at least one substituent, such as a<br>
halogen atom, a lower alkoxy group, a cyano group, an<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group, an aryloxycarbonyl group, an<br>
acyloxy group or a nitro group.<br>
[0048] Of these aliphatic monohydric alcohols, an al-<br>
cohol having 1 to 6 carbon atoms is preferred. More<br>
preferred are monohydric alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, i.e., methanol, ethanol, propanol (isomers) and<br>
butanol (isomers). When ethylene carbonate or propyl-<br>
ene carbonate is used as a cyclic carbonate, methanol<br><br>
and ethanol are preferred, and especially preferred is<br>
methanol.<br>
[0049] In the method of the present invention, the<br>
transesterification reaction is performed in the pres-<br>
ence of a transesterification catalyst. The method for<br>
causing a transesterification catalyst to be present in<br>
the reactor is not particularly limited. For example,<br>
a homogeneous catalyst which is soluble in the reaction<br>
system under the reaction conditions can be caused to<br>
be present in the transesterification reactor by con-<br>
tinuously feeding the homogeneous catalyst to the<br>
transesterification reactor. Alternatively, a hetero-<br>
geneous catalyst (solid catalyst) which is insoluble in<br>
the reaction system under the reaction conditions, can<br>
be caused to be present in the transesterification re-<br>
actor by packing the solid catalyst in the transesteri-<br>
fication reactor. The above-mentioned homogeneous and<br>
heterogeneous catalysts can be used in combination.<br>
[0050] When a homogeneous catalyst is continuously fed<br>
to the transesterification reactor, it may be fed to<br>
the reactor together with a feedstock cyclic carbonate<br>
and/or a feedstock aliphatic monohydric alcohol. Al-<br>
ternatively, the homogeneous catalyst may be fed to the<br>
reactor at a position different from that at which the<br>
feedstock is fed. Further, when a multi-stage distil-<br><br>
lation column is used as a transesterification reactor,<br>
the homogeneous catalyst can be fed to the distillation<br>
column at any position as long as the position is at<br>
least one theoretical stage (plate) above the column<br>
bottom.<br>
[0051] However, since the region where the reaction<br>
actually takes place in the continuous multi-stage dis-<br>
tillation column is generally below the position at<br>
which the homogeneous catalyst is fed, it is preferred<br>
that the homogeneous catalyst is fed to the distilla-<br>
tion column at a position between the top of the column<br>
and the position at which the feedstock is fed.<br>
[0052] When a heterogeneous solid catalyst is used as<br>
a catalyst, the catalyst can be packed in a desired<br>
amount at a desired position of the reactor. When a<br>
multi-stage distillation column is used as a trans-<br>
esterif ication reactor, the catalyst layer present in<br>
the column has a height which corresponds to at least<br>
one theoretical stage (plate), preferably two or more<br>
theoretical stages (plates). A catalyst which can<br>
serve as a packing for the multi-stage distillation<br>
column can also be used.<br>
[0053] As a transesterification catalyst used in the<br>
present invention, various types of known catalysts can<br>
be used. Examples of such catalysts include alkali<br><br>
metals or alkaline earth metals, such as lithium, so-<br>
dium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, magnesium, calcium,<br>
strontium and barium; basic compounds, such as hydrides,<br>
hydroxides, alkoxides, aryloxides and amides of alkali<br>

zole, N-alkylimidazole, N-alkylpyrazole, oxadiazole,<br>

as Na2PbO2, K2PbO2, NaHPbO2 and KHPbO2; plurnbates, such<br>
as Na2PbO3, Na2H2PbO4, K2PbO3, K2[Pb(OH)6], K4PbO4, Ca2PbO4<br>
and CaPbO3; lead carbonates and basic salts thereof,<br>
such as PbCO3 and 2PbCO3 • Pb(OH)2; alkoxylead compounds<br>
and aryloxylead compounds, such as Pb(OCH3)2,<br>
(CH3O)Pb(OPh) and Pb(OPh)2; lead salts of organic acids,<br>
and carbonates and basic salts thereof, such as<br><br>
Pb(OCOCH3)2, Pb(OCOCH3)4 and Pb(OCOCH3)2•PbO-3H2O;<br>

represents a butyl group and Ph represents a phenyl<br>
group; lead alloys, such as Pb-Na, Pb-Ca, Pb-Ba, Pb-Sn<br>
and Pb-Sb; lead minerals, such as galena and zinc<br>
blende; hydrates of these lead compounds; ion<br>
-exchangers, such as anion-exchange resins having<br>
-tertiary amino groups, ion-exchange resins having am-<br>
ide groups, ion-exchange resins having at least one<br>
type of ion-exchange group selected from the group con-<br>
sisting of sulfonate, carboxylate and phosphate groups,<br>
and strongly basic solid anion-exchangers having qua-<br>
ternary ammonium groups as ion-exchange groups; and<br>
solid inorganic compounds, such as silica, silica-<br>
alumina, silica-magnesia, aluminosilicate, gallium<br>
silicate, various types of zeolites, various types of<br>
metal<br>
-exchanged zeolites and ammonium-exchanged zeolites.<br>
[0054] Among the above-mentioned solid catalysts,<br>
strongly basic anion-exchangers having quaternary ammo-<br>
nium groups as anion-exchange groups are preferred.<br>
Examples of such anion-exchangers include strongly ba-<br>
sic anion-exchange resins having quaternary ammonium<br>
groups as anion-exchange groups, cellulose type<br><br>
strongly basic anion-exchangers having quaternary ammo-<br>
nium groups as anion-exchange groups, and strongly ba-<br>
sic anion-exchangers carried on an inorganic carrier<br>
which have quaternary ammonium groups as anion-exchange<br>
groups.<br>
[0055] Of these strongly basic anion-exchange resins<br>
having quaternary ammonium groups as ion-exchange<br>
groups, styrene type strongly basic anion-exchange res-<br>
ins and the like are preferred. A styrene type<br>
strongly basic anion-exchange resin is comprised of a<br>
styrene/divinyl-benzene copolymer as a base resin, and<br>
quaternary ammonium groups (type I or type II) as an-<br>
ion-exchange groups, examples of which are diagrammati-<br>
cally represented by the following formulae (II).<br>
[0056]<br><br><br>
[0057] In above formulae (II), X represents an anion.<br>
Generally, X is at least one type of anion selected<br>
from the group consisting of F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, HCO3-,<br>
CO32-, CH3CO2-, HCO2-, IO3-, BrO3- and ClO3-. It is pre-<br>
ferred that X is selected from the group consisting of<br>
Cl-, Br-, HCO3- and CO32-. With respect to the structure<br>
of the base resin of the anion-exchange resin, either a<br>
gel type or a macroreticular type (MR type) can be used.<br>
However, because of the high resistance to organic sol-<br><br>
vents, the MR type is preferred.<br>
[0058] Examples of cellulose type strongly basic anion<br>
-exchangers having quaternary ammonium groups as ion<br>
-exchange groups include cellulose type strongly basic<br>
anion-exchangers having ion-exchange groups of the<br>
structure represented by the formula: -OCH2CH2NR3X,<br>
which exchangers are obtained by trialkylaminoethy-<br>
lation of a part or all of the hydroxyl groups of cel-<br>
lulose. In the above formula, R represents an alkyl<br>
group, for example, a methyl group, an ethyl group, a<br>
propyl group, a butyl group, preferably a methyl group<br>
or an ethyl group; and X is as defined above.<br>
[0059] The inorganic carrier-carried strongly basic<br>
anion-exchanger usable in the present invention, which<br>
has quaternary ammonium groups as ion-exchange groups,<br>
is an anion-exchanger having quaternary ammonium groups<br>
represented by the formula -O(CH2)nNR3X wherein R and X<br>
are as defined above and n is usually an integer of<br>
from 1 to 6, preferably 2, which anion-exchanger can be<br>
prepared by the modification of a part or all of the<br>
hydroxyl groups on the surface of the inorganic carrier.<br>
Examples of inorganic carriers include silica, alumina,<br>
silica-alumina, titania and zeolite. Of these, silica,<br>
alumina and silica-alumina are preferred. Silica is<br>
most preferred.<br><br>
[0060] There is no limitation with respect to the<br>
method for the modification of hydroxyl groups on the<br>
surface of the inorganic carrier. For example, such a<br>
strongly basic anion-exchanger carried on an inorganic<br>
carrier can be obtained by subjecting an inorganic car-<br>
rier and an aminoalcohol represented by the formula<br>
HO(CH2)nNR2 to a dehydration reaction between them in<br>
the presence of a basic catalyst to thereby effect ami-<br>
noalkoxylation, followed by the reaction of the resul-<br>
tant aminoalkoxylated inorganic carrier with an alkyl<br>
halide represented by the formula RX', wherein X'<br>
represents a halogen atom, preferably Cl, Br or I, to<br>
thereby convert the aminoalkoxy group into a<br>
-O(CH2)nNR3X' group. The -O(CH2)nNR3X' group is further<br>
converted to a -O(CH2)nNR3X group having the desired<br>
anion X by an anion exchange reaction. When n is 2, an<br>
inorganic carrier is treated with N,N-dialkylaziridine<br>
so that the hydroxyl groups on the inorganic carrier<br>
are N,N-dialkylaminoethoxylated to obtain a -OCH2CH2NR2<br>
group, which is then converted to a -O(CH2)nNR3X group<br>
by the above-mentioned method.<br>
[0061] Commercially available solid, strongly basic<br>
anion-exchangers having quaternary ammonium groups as<br>
ion-exchange groups can be used in the present inven-<br>
tion. When a commercially available solid, strongly<br><br>
basic anion-exchanger is used, it can be treated for<br>
anion-exchange with a desired anion species before it<br>
is used as a transesterification catalyst.<br>
[0062] A solid catalyst comprised of a macroreticular<br>
or gel type organic polymer or an inorganic carrier,<br>
each having bonded thereto a heterocyclic group con-<br>
taining at least one nitrogen atom, is preferably used<br>
as a transesterification catalyst. Further, the above<br>
-mentioned solid catalyst can be treated for quater-<br>
narizing a part or all of the nitrogen-containing het-<br>
erocyclic groups before it is used.<br>
[0063] The amount of the transesterification catalyst<br>
to be used in the present invention varies depending on<br>
the type thereof. The homogeneous catalyst, which is<br>
soluble in the reaction system under the reaction con-<br>
ditions, is fed continuously in an amount of from<br>
0.0001 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the raw material cyclic carbonate and the raw material<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol. When the solid catalyst<br>
is used, it is used generally in an amount of from 10<br>
to 95 % by volume, preferably from 50 to 90 % by volume,<br>
based on the internal volume of the reactor. When the<br>
solid catalyst is packed in a distillation column, it<br>
is packed preferably in an amount of from 0.01 to 75 %<br>
by volume, based on the internal volume of the empty<br><br>
distillation column.<br>
[0064] When a multi-stage distillation column is used<br>
as a transesterification reactor, there is no particu-<br>
lar restriction with respect to the method for continu-<br>
ously feeding a cyclic carbonate and an aliphatic mono-<br>
hydric alcohol to the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column. Any feeding method can be used as<br>
long as the feedstocks can be contacted with the cata-<br>
lyst in a region of the distillation column which cor-<br>
responds to at least one stage, preferably at least two<br>
stages. That is, the cyclic carbonate and the ali-<br>
phatic monohydric alcohol can be continuously fed to<br>
one or more stages of the continuous multi-stage dis-<br>
tillation column through a desired number of feeding<br>
pipes at one or more desired locations as long as the<br>
above requirement is satisfied. The cyclic carbonate<br>
and the monohydric alcohol may be fed either to the<br>
same stage of the distillation column or to separate<br>
stages individually.<br>
[0065] The feedstocks are continuously fed in a liquid<br>
form, a gaseous form or a gas-liquid mixture form. In<br>
addition to the feeding of the feedstocks to the con-<br>
tinuous multi-stage distillation column as described<br>
above, additional feedstocks can be fed in a gaseous<br>
form to the lower portion of the distillation column<br><br>
intermittently or continuously. Also preferred is a<br>
method wherein the cyclic carbonate is continuously fed<br>
in a liquid form or a gas-liquid mixture form to a<br>
stage at a level higher than the stage where the cata-<br>
lyst is present, while the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
is continuously fed to the lower portion of the distil-<br>
lation column in a gaseous form or a gas-liquid mixture<br>
form, or in a gaseous form and in a liquid form indi-<br>
vidually. In this case, some of the aliphatic mono-<br>
hydric alcohol may be contained in the cyclic carbonate.<br>
[0066] In the present invention, a small amount of a<br>
diol as a desired product may be contained in the raw<br>
materials. Further, the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
may contain a concomitant dialkyl carbonate. When the<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol contains a concomitant<br>
dialkyl carbonate, the amount of the concomitant dial-<br>
kyl carbonate in the aliphatic monohydric alcohol is<br>
generally in the range of from 0 to 40 % by weight,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, more preferably<br>
from 1 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the aliphatic monohydric alcohol and the concomitant<br>
dialkyl carbonate.<br>
[0067] The ratio of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol<br>
to the cyclic carbonate to be fed to the transesterifi-<br>
cation reactor may vary depending on the type and quan-<br><br>
tity of the transesterification catalyst and the reac-<br>
tion conditions, but, in general, the molar ratio of<br>
the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to the cyclic carbon-<br>
ate may be in the range of from 0.01 to 1,000. For in-<br>
creasing the conversion of the cyclic carbonate, it is<br>
preferred to feed the aliphatic monohydric alcohol in<br>
an excess amount which is 2 times or more by mole the<br>
mole of the cyclic carbonate. However, too high a con-<br>
centration of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol is unde-<br>
sirable because the size of the reaction equipment<br>
needs to be large. Therefore, it is especially pre-<br>
ferred to use the aliphatic monohydric alcohol in an<br>
amount which is 2 to 20 times by mole the mole of the<br>
cyclic carbonate.<br>
[0068] When carbon dioxide is present in a high con-<br>
centration in the transesterification reaction system<br>
of the method of the present invention, the reaction<br>
rate becomes low. Therefore, the CO2 concentration of<br>
the reaction system is generally not higher than 500<br>
ppm by weight, preferably not higher than 200 ppm by<br>
weight, more preferably not higher than 100 ppm by<br>
weight.<br>
[0069] Also when water is present in a high concentra-<br>
tion in the transesterification reaction system of the<br>
method of the present invention, hydrolysis of a cyclic<br><br>
carbonate takes place simultaneously with the trans-<br>
esterif ication, resulting in a decrease in the selec-<br>
tivity for dialkyl carbonate. Therefore, the water<br>
concentration of the reaction system is generally not<br>
higher than 200 ppm by weight, preferably not higher<br>
than 100 ppm by weight.<br>
[0070] In the method of the present invention, when it<br>
is attempted to render the conversion of the cyclic<br>
carbonate close to 100 %, the reaction time needs to be<br>
prolonged, and the aliphatic monohydric alcohol needs<br>
to be used in large excess. On the other hand, when<br>
the conversion of the cyclic carbonate is too low, the<br>
size of the apparatus used for separation removal of<br>
the unreacted cyclic carbonate needs to be large.<br>
Therefore, the conversion of the cyclic carbonate is<br>
generally in the range of from 95 to 99.999 %, prefera-<br>
bly from 98 to 99.99 %, more preferably from 99 to<br>
99.99 %.<br>
[0071] In the present invention, the dialkyl carbonate<br>
which is one of the products of the present invention<br>
is withdrawn from the transesterification reactor. In<br>
general, the dialkyl carbonate is withdrawn from the<br>
upper portion of the transesterification reactor as a<br>
low boiling point mixture in a gaseous form. The low<br>
boiling point mixture withdrawn from the upper portion<br><br>
of the reactor may be the dialkyl carbonate alone or a<br>
mixture of the dialkyl carbonate and the aliphatic<br>
monohydric alcohol. Further, the withdrawn gaseous<br>
mixture may also contain a high boiling point product<br>
in a small amount.<br>
[0072] When a multi-stage distillation column is used<br>
as a transesterification reactor, a withdrawal port of<br>
the continuous multi-stage distillation column for<br>
withdrawing the gaseous low boiling point mixture con-<br>
taining the dialkyl carbonate is preferably provided at<br>
a position between the position from which the feed-<br>
stocks are fed and the top of the distillation column,<br>
or in the top of the distillation column. It is more<br>
preferred to provide the withdrawal port for the low<br>
boiling point mixture in the top of the distillation<br>
column. A part of the low boiling point mixture with-<br>
drawn from the withdrawal port may be returned to the<br>
upper portion of the distillation column to thereby<br>
effect the so-called reflux operation. When the reflux<br>
ratio is increased by conducting this reflux operation,<br>
the distillation efficiency of a low boiling product<br>
into a vapor phase is increased, thereby advantageously<br>
increasing the concentration of a low boiling point<br>
product in the withdrawn gaseous component. However,<br>
too much of an increase in the reflux ratio disadvanta-<br><br>
geously leads to an increase in the thermal energy re-<br>
quired. Thus, the reflux ratio is generally chosen in<br>
the range of from 0 to 10, preferably from 0 to 5, more<br>
preferably from 0 to 3.<br>
[0073] By continuously feeding the low boiling point<br>
mixture withdrawn from the upper portion of the trans-<br>
esterification reactor, containing the dialkyl carbon-<br>
ate, to a dialkyl carbonate separation apparatus and<br>
continuously recovering the dialkyl carbonate from the<br>
separation apparatus, the product dialkyl carbonate can<br>
be obtained. Examples of such dialkyl carbonate sepa-<br>
ration apparatuses include a distillation type separa-<br>
tion apparatus, an extractive distillation type separa-<br>
tion apparatus, a liquid-liquid extraction type<br>
separation apparatus, a crystallization type separation<br>
apparatus, an adsorption type separation apparatus and<br>
a membrane type separation apparatus. A combination of<br>
a plurality of different or identical separation appa-<br>
ratuses may be used. Among these separation appara-<br>
tuses, a distillation type separation apparatus is es-<br>
pecially preferred.<br>
[0074] When the low boiling point mixture (containing<br>
the dialkyl carbonate and the unreacted aliphatic mono-<br>
hydric alcohol) withdrawn from the upper portion of the<br>
multi-stage distillation column is subjected to separa-<br><br>
tion by means of a distillation type separation appara-<br>
tus , the low boiling point mixture can be separated<br>
into various components, such as the dialkyl carbonate<br>
and the unreacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol, wherein<br>
some of the separated components are obtained in the<br>
form of one or more column top fractions containing a<br>
single component or a plurality of components and some<br>
of the separated components are obtained in the form of<br>
a column bottom liquid. As the above-mentioned column<br>
top fraction, an azeotropic mixture may be obtained<br>
depending on the types of feedstocks. After the compo-<br>
nents in the low boiling point mixture withdrawn from<br>
the upper portion of the multi-stage distillation col-<br>
umn are separated by means of a distillation type sepa-<br>
ration apparatus, one or more fractions containing the<br>
unreacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol and/or a column<br>
bottom liquid containing the unreacted aliphatic mono-<br>
hydric alcohol is then fed to the transesterification<br>
reactor.<br>
[0075] As the distillation type separation apparatus,<br>
a single continuous multi-stage distillation column or<br>
a plurality of continuous multi-stage distillation col-<br>
umns can be used, wherein each continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column may be of the same type as used as<br>
the transesterification reactor. Explained hereinbelow<br><br>
is a mode of the method of the present invention in<br>
which an aliphatic monohydric alcohol and a dialkyl<br>
carbonate form a minimum boiling point azeotropic mix-<br>
ture, and wherein dimethyl carbonate is produced by<br>
using methanol as the aliphatic monohydric alcohol. A<br>
low boiling point mixture (containing methanol and di-<br>
methyl carbonate) withdrawn from the upper portion of<br>
the transesterification reactor is continuously fed to<br>
a dimethyl carbonate separation column. A low boiling<br>
point mixture containing a minimum boiling point<br>
azeotropic mixture of methanol and dimethyl carbonate<br>
is continuously withdrawn from an upper portion of the<br>
dimethyl carbonate separation column, while continu-<br>
ously withdrawing dimethyl carbonate from a lower por-<br>
tion of the dimethyl carbonate separation column,<br>
thereby obtaining dimethyl carbonate.<br>
[0076] As the dimethyl carbonate separation column, a<br>
single continuous multi-stage distillation column or a<br>
plurality of continuous multi-stage distillation col-<br>
umns can be used, wherein each continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column may be of the same type as used as<br>
the transesterification reactor. The dimethyl carbon-<br>
ate separation column is generally operated under re-<br>
duced pressure, atmospheric pressure or superatmos-<br>
pheric pressure, specifically in the range of from 0.5<br><br>
x 105 to 50 x 105 Pa (0.51 to 51 kg/cm2) in terms of the<br>
absolute pressure.<br>
[0077] The composition of methanol/dimethyl carbonate<br>
minimum boiling point azeotropic mixture may be varied<br>
depending on the operating pressure of the dimethyl<br>
carbonate separation column. Therefore, the operating<br>
pressure of the dimethyl carbonate separation column is<br>
chosen so that the dimethyl carbonate is obtained from<br>
the lower portion of the dimethyl carbonate separation<br>
column. Specifically, an operating pressure higher<br>
than an operating pressure corresponding to the metha-<br>
nol/dimethyl carbonate ratio of the low boiling point<br>
mixture withdrawn from the upper portion of the trans-<br>
esterification reactor is chosen for the dimethyl car-<br>
bonate separation column.<br>
[0078] The dialkyl carbonate obtained by the method of<br>
the present invention contains a carbonate ether repre-<br>
sented by the above-mentioned formula (2). The lower<br>
the cyclic ether content of the cyclic carbonate, the<br>
lower the carbonate ether content of the dialkyl car-<br>
bonate produced. However, for producing a cyclic car-<br>
bonate having extremely low cyclic ether content, the<br>
cyclic carbonate must be produced by a complicated<br>
method which is not practical for commercial production.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, the cyclic ether<br><br>
content of the dialkyl carbonate produced is not more<br>
than 10,000 ppm, preferably in the range of from 1 to<br>
10,000 ppm, more preferably from 3 to 5,000 ppm, still<br>
more preferably from 10 to 3,000 ppm.<br>
[0079] The low boiling point mixture (containing a<br>
minimum boiling point azeotropic mixture of methanol<br>
and dimethyl carbonate) withdrawn from the upper por-<br>
tion of the above-mentioned dimethyl carbonate separa-<br>
tion column may be fed to the transesterification reac-<br>
tor as a feedstock usable in the present invention.<br>
[0080] In the method of the present invention, the up-<br>
per portion of the continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column means a portion between the top of the distilla-<br>
tion column and a position at approximately half the<br>
height of the distillation column, and the upper por-<br>
tion includes the top of the column. The lower portion<br>
of the continuous multi-stage distillation column means<br>
a portion between the bottom of the distillation column<br>
and a position at approximately half the height of the<br>
distillation column, and the lower portion includes the<br>
bottom of the column.<br>
[0081] Further, in the method of the present invention,<br>
the diol produced in the transesterification reactor is<br>
obtained as the high boiling point mixture withdrawn in<br>
a liquid form from the lower portion of the trans-<br><br>
esterification reactor. The high boiling point mixture<br>
contains the produced diol and the unreacted cyclic<br>
carbonate, and may also contain a part of the unreacted<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol or both a part of the un-<br>
reacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol and a part of the<br>
produced dialkyl carbonate.<br>
[0082] The withdrawal port for withdrawing the high<br>
boiling point mixture (containing the produced diol) in<br>
the liquid form from the transesterification reactor is<br>
positioned at a lower portion of the reactor, prefera-<br>
bly at the bottom of the reactor. A part of the with-<br>
drawn liquid mixture may be recycled to the lower por-<br>
tion of the transesterification reactor in a gaseous<br>
form or a gas-liquid mixture form by heating by means<br>
of a reboiler.<br>
[0083] When a multi-stage distillation column is used<br>
as a transesterification reactor, the rate at which a<br>
liquid flows down inside the continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column and the rate at which a vapor as-<br>
cends inside the distillation column may be varied de-<br>
pending on the type of the distillation column, and on<br>
the type of the packing in the case of a packed column.<br>
However, the distillation column is generally operated<br>
so that no flooding or weeping occurs.<br>
[0084] In the method of the present invention, the av-<br><br>
erage residence time of the liquid phase in the trans-<br>
esterification reactor depends on the reaction condi-<br>
tions, and the type and inner structure (for example,<br>
the types of the plate and packing) of the transesteri-<br>
fication reactor, but is generally in the range of from<br>
0.001 to 50 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 10 hours,<br>
more preferably from 0.05 to 5 hours.<br>
[0085] The reaction temperature varies depending on<br>
the types of the raw materials and the reaction pres-<br>
sure, but is generally chosen in the range of from -20<br>
to 350 °C, preferably from 0 to 200 °C. The reaction<br>
pressure in the transesterification reactor can be se-<br>
lected from reduced pressure, atmospheric pressure and<br>
superatomospheric pressure. The reaction pressure is<br>
generally in the range of from 1 Pa to 2 x 106 Pa,<br>
preferably from 1 x 103 Pa to 1 x 106 Pa, more prefera-<br>
bly from 1 x 104 Pa to 5 x 105 Pa, in terms of the ab-<br>
solute pressure.<br>
[0086] It is also possible to supply a part of the<br>
high boiling point mixture withdrawn in a liquid form<br>
from the lower portion of the transesterification reac-<br>
tor to the transesterification reactor, so that a part<br>
of the unreacted cyclic carbonate and/or a part of the<br>
unreacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol can be recycled<br>
to the transesterification reactor.<br><br>
[0087] When the high boiling point mixture (containing<br>
the produced diol) withdrawn from the lower portion of<br>
the transesterification reactor is subjected to separa-<br>
tion in the diol purification step, the high boiling<br>
point mixture can be separated into various components.<br>
In general, (i) when the high boiling point mixture<br>
contains low boiling point components (such as an ali-<br>
phatic alcohol used as a raw material), it is preferred<br>
that, before the diol purification step, an aliphatic<br>
alcohol and the like are separated from the high boil-<br>
ing point mixture by distillation or the like and, then,<br>
the separated aliphatic alcohol and the like are recy-<br>
cled to the transesterification reactor, and (ii) it is<br>
also preferred that, before the diol purification step,<br>
the unreacted cyclic carbonate contained in the high<br>
boiling point mixture is separated therefrom and, then,<br>
the remaining part of high boiling point mixture is<br>
introduced into the diol purification step. As methods<br>
for separating unreacted cyclic carbonate from the high<br>
boiling point mixture, there can be mentioned (ii-1)<br>
separation by distillation, (ii-2) hydrolysis to con-<br>
vert unreacted cyclic carbonate to a diol, and (ii-3)<br>
elimination of unreacted cyclic carbonate by the eth-<br>
erification of the cyclic carbonate with a diol. The<br>
etherification is especially preferred in the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
[0088] Specifically, as preferred examples of manners<br>
in which the high boiling point mixture withdrawn from<br>
the transesterification reactor is treated before sub-<br>
jected to a step for the purification of diol, the fol-<br>
lowing two modes can be mentioned.<br>
[0089] 1. A mode in which the high boiling point mix-<br>
ture (in the liquid form) withdrawn from the lower por-<br>
tion of the transesterification reactor contains the<br>
low boiling point mixture (including a part of the un-<br>
reacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol and dialkyl car-<br>
bonate), and wherein the high boiling point mixture is<br>
continuously introduced, prior to the feeding thereof<br>
to the continuous etherification reactor, to a low<br>
boiling point mixture separation column which is com-<br>
prised of a continuous multi-stage distillation column,<br>
and wherein a low boiling point mixture containing the<br>
part of the unreacted aliphatic monohydric alcohol and<br>
dialkyl carbonate which is contained in the high boil-<br>
ing point mixture is continuously withdrawn from an<br>
upper portion of the low boiling point mixture separa-<br>
tion column, while continuously withdrawing a high<br>
boiling point mixture containing the diol and the unre-<br>
acted cyclic carbonate from the low boiling point mix-<br>
ture separation column through one or more side-cut<br><br>
withdrawal ports provided in a side wall of the column<br>
at one or more positions thereof corresponding to one<br>
or more stages selected from the group consisting of<br>
intermediate stages and a lowermost stage of the low<br>
boiling point mixture separation column,<br>
wherein the low boiling point mixture withdrawn<br>
from the upper portion of the low boiling point mixture<br>
separation column is continuously recycled to the<br>
transesterification reactor, while continuously feeding<br>
the high boiling point mixture withdrawn through the<br>
side-cut withdrawal port of the low boiling point mix-<br>
ture separation column to the diol separation apparatus.<br>
[0090] As the low boiling point mixture separation<br>
column, a continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
can be used, and the continuous multi-stage distilla-<br>
tion column may be of the same type as used as the<br>
transesterification reactor.<br>
[0091] 2. A mode in which the high boiling point mix-<br>
ture withdrawn from the lower portion of the trans-<br>
esterif ication reactor contains a part of the unreacted<br>
aliphatic monohydric alcohol and dialkyl carbonate, and<br>
wherein the high boiling point mixture is continuously<br>
introduced, prior to the feeding thereof to the etheri-<br>
fication reactor, to a low boiling point mixture sepa-<br>
ration column which is comprised of a continuous multi<br><br>
-stage distillation column, and wherein a low boiling<br>
point mixture containing the part of the unreacted ali-<br>
phatic monohydric alcohol and dialkyl carbonate which<br>
is contained in the high boiling point mixture is con-<br>
tinuously withdrawn from an upper portion of the low<br>
boiling point mixture separation column, while continu-<br>
ously withdrawing a high boiling point mixture contain-<br>
ing the diol and the unreacted cyclic carbonate from a<br>
lower portion of the low boiling point mixture separa-<br>
tion column, followed by the etherification of the cy-<br>
clic carbonate in the withdrawn high boiling point mix-<br>
ture at the bottom portion of the low boiling point<br>
mixture separation column,<br>
wherein the low boiling point mixture withdrawn<br>
from the upper portion of the low boiling point mixture<br>
separation column is continuously recycled to the<br>
transesterification reactor, while continuously feeding<br>
the high boiling point mixture containing the diol and<br>
the ether to the diol separation apparatus.<br>
[0092] The above-mentioned etherification can be per-<br>
formed in accordance with the etherification method<br>
described in Patent Document 21. Specifically, the<br>
high boiling point mixture containing the produced diol<br>
and the unreacted cyclic carbonate is fed to an etheri-<br>
fication reactor, to thereby effect an etherification<br><br>
reaction between the unreacted cyclic carbonate and a<br>
part of the produced diol and produce a chain ether<br>
represented by the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined for formula (1) above.<br>
[0093] The reaction conditions for the etherification<br>
reaction in the etherification reactor may be varied<br>
depending on the presence or absence of an etherifica-<br>
tion catalyst. When an etherification catalyst is used,<br>
the etherification reaction conditions may be varied<br>
depending on the type and amount of the etherification<br>
catalyst. However, in general, the reaction tempera-<br>
ture is from 50 to 350 °C, preferably from 80 to 300 °C,<br>
more preferably from 100 to 250 °C. The reaction time<br>
may be varied depending on the presence or absence of<br>
an etherification catalyst. When an etherification<br>
catalyst is used, the reaction time may be varied de-<br>
pending on the type and amount of the etherification<br>
catalyst and the reaction temperature. However, in<br>
general, the reaction time is from 0.001 to 50 hours,<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 10 hours, more preferably from<br>
0.02 to 5 hours, in terms of the average residence time.<br>
The reaction pressure may be varied depending on the<br>
reaction temperature. However, in general, the reac-<br><br>
tion pressure is from 1 x 103 to 2 x 107 Pa, preferably<br>
from 1 x 104 to 1 x 107 Pa, in terms of the absolute<br>
pressure.<br>
[0094] The conversion of the cyclic carbonate in the<br>
etherification reaction is generally from 90 to 100 %,<br>
preferably from 95 to 100 %, more preferably from 98 to<br>
100 %.<br>
[0095] When carbon dioxide enters the transesterifica-<br>
tion reactor, the transesterification reaction is ad-<br>
versely affected, so that the reaction rate becomes low.<br>
Therefore, when the etherification reaction mixture<br>
withdrawn from the etherification reactor contains car-<br>
bon dioxide, it is preferred that the carbon dioxide is<br>
separated from the etherification reaction mixture by<br>
means of a carbon dioxide separation apparatus.<br>
[0096] In addition, there can be used the distillation<br>
separation method described in Patent Documents 22 and<br>
23. In this method, water is fed to the distillation<br>
separation apparatus in which a reaction mixture con-<br>
taining diol is subjected to distillation separation.<br>
[0097] In the method of the present invention, it is<br>
not necessary to use a solvent. However, for the pur-<br>
poses of, e.g., (1) facilitating the reaction operation<br>
and (2) separating a dialkyl carbonate and a diol effi-<br>
ciently by performing azeotropic distillation or ex-<br><br>
tractive distillation, an appropriate inert solvent may<br>
be used as a reaction solvent. Examples of inert sol-<br>
vents include an ether, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, an<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon, a halogenated aliphatic hydrocar-<br>
bon and a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
[0098] An inert gas, such as nitrogen, helium, argon<br>
or the like, may be present in the reaction system.<br>
Further, for the purpose of promoting the distilling<br>
-off of a generated low boiling point reaction product,<br>
the above-mentioned inert gas or a gaseous form of an<br>
inert low boiling point organic compound may be intro-<br>
duced to the reaction system from a lower portion of a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column.<br><br>
Examples<br>
[0099] Hereinbelow, the present invention will be de-<br>
scribed in more detail with reference to the following<br>
Examples and Comparative Example, which should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present inven-<br>
tion.<br>
[0100] In the following Examples and Comparative Exam-<br>

based on the amount of the charged ethylene carbonate;<br>
the selectivity (%) for ethylene glycol is determined,<br>
based on the amount of the consumed ethylene carbonate;<br>

based on the amount of the charged ethylene carbonate;<br>
and the selectivity (%) for dimethyl carbonate is de-<br>

The positions of respective stages of a distillation<br>
column are represented by the ordinal numbers for the<br>
respective stages as counted from the top stage of the<br>
distillation column.<br>
[0101] Example 1<br>
Using a production system as shown in Fig. 1, di-<br>
methyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene glycol (EG) were<br>
continuously produced from ethylene carbonate (EC) and<br><br>
methanol (MeOH). Continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column 1 was comprised of a 60-stage Oldershaw distil-<br>
lation column which has an inner diameter of 5 cm. EC<br>
(containing 400 ppm of ethylene oxide) was continuously-<br>
fed in a liquid form to distillation column 1 at the<br>
fifth stage thereof through conduit 2 and preheater 3<br>
at a flow rate of 231 g/h, and an 18 % by weight solu-<br>
tion of potassium hydroxide (as a catalyst) in ethylene<br>
glycol was also continuously fed in a liquid form to<br>
distillation column 1 at the fifth stage thereof<br>
through conduit 2' at a flow rate of 1.1 g/h, while<br>
continuously feeding a mixture of MeOH and DMC<br>
(MeOH/DMC weight ratio = 97/3) in a liquid form to dis-<br>
tillation column 1 at the 30th stage thereof through<br>
conduit 5 and preheater 6 at a flow rate of 735.0 g/h,<br>
to thereby effect a transesterification reaction. Con-<br>
tinuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was operated<br>
under conditions wherein the reaction pressure and re-<br>
action temperature, each as measured at column top 4<br>
thereof, were atmospheric pressure and 63.8 °C, respec-<br>
tively.<br>
[0102] A low boiling point mixture in a gaseous form<br>
distilled from column top 4 of distillation column 1<br>
was condensed by condenser 7. A part of the resultant<br>
condensate was refluxed to column top 4 of distillation<br><br>
column 1 through conduit 8 (reflux ratio: 0.4), while<br>
the remainder of the condensate (hereinbelow, the con-<br>
densate is referred to simply as "column top condensate<br>
from column 1") was fed to DMC separation column 71 at<br>
a position 80 cm below the top of column 71 through<br>
conduit 9 at a flow rate of 803.1 g/h, wherein column<br>
71 was comprised of a packed column type distillation<br>
column having an inner diameter of 2.5 cm and a packing<br>
height of 160 cm and having packed therein Dixon pack-<br>
ings (3 mm(|)) . The column top condensate from column 1<br>
contained MeOH and DMC in concentrations of 6 7.9 % by<br>
weight and 32.1 % by weight, respectively.<br>
[0103] On the other hand, a liquid was withdrawn from<br>
column bottom 10 of distillation column 1 through con-<br>
duit 11 (hereinbelow, the liquid is referred to simply<br>
as "bottom liquid of column 1"), and a part of the bot-<br>
tom liquid of column 1 was heated by reboiler 12 to<br>
provide the energy required for distillation and re-<br>
turned to column bottom 10 of distillation column 1<br>
through conduit 13, while the remainder of the bottom<br>
liquid of column 1 was withdrawn as a high boiling<br>
point mixture in a liquid form, and fed to low boiling<br>
point mixture separation column 17 at a position 100 cm<br>
below the top of column 17 through conduit 14 at a flow<br>
rate of 231.3 g/h, wherein column 17 was comprised of a<br><br>
packed column type distillation column having an inner<br>
diameter of 2.5 cm and a packing height of 160 cm and<br>
having packed therein Dixon packings (3 mmϕ) . The high<br>
boiling point mixture contained EG, MeOH, EC, DMC and<br>
KOH in concentrations of 70.7 % by weight, 29.1 % by<br>
weight, 0.099 % by weight, 0.04 % by weight and 0.086 %<br>
by weight, respectively. The conversion of EC in the<br>
transesterification reaction was 99.9 %.<br>
[0104] DMC separation column 71 was operated under<br>
conditions wherein the pressure of column top 72<br>
thereof was 1.4 x 106 Pa and the temperature of column<br>
bottom 73 thereof was 205 °C. A low boiling point mix-<br>
ture in a gaseous form distilled from column top 72 of<br>
column 71 was condensed by condenser 75. A part of the<br>
resultant condensate was refluxed to column top 72 of<br>
column 71 through conduit 7 7 (reflux ratio: 2), while<br>
feeding the remainder of the condensate to continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 1 through conduit 78<br>
(which is connected to conduit 5), conduit 5 and pre-<br>
heater 6. For stabilizing the composition of the liq-<br>
uid fed to continuous multi-stage distillation column 1<br>
through conduit 5, the composition of the liquid fed to<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 through<br>
conduit 5 was gradually changed from MeOH/DMC to only<br>
MeOH.<br><br>
[0105] A liquid was withdrawn from column bottom 73 of<br>
DMC separation column 71 through conduit 79 (hereinbe-<br>
low, the liquid is referred to simply as "bottom liquid<br>
of column 71"), and a part of the bottom liquid of col-<br>
umn 71 was heated by reboiler 80 to provide the energy<br>
required for distillation and returned to column bottom<br>
73 of distillation column 71 through conduit 81, while<br>
the remainder was withdrawn at a flow rate of 235 g/h<br>
from the production system through conduit 82. The<br>
bottom liquid of column 71 contained 99.9 % by weight<br>
of DMC and 1,150 ppm of carbonate ether<br>
(CH3OCH2CH2OCOOCH3).<br>
[0106] Low boiling point mixture separation column 17<br>
was operated under conditions wherein the pressure of<br>
column top 18 thereof was atmospheric pressure and the<br>
temperature of column bottom 26 thereof was 201 °C. At<br>
the column bottom 26 of low boiling point mixture sepa-<br>
ration column 17, an etherification reaction between EC<br>
and EG was effected, thereby forming diethylene glycol<br>
(DEG). The residence time at column bottom 26 of low<br>
boiling point mixture separation column 17 was 1.5<br>
hours. A low boiling point mixture in a gaseous form<br>
distilled from column top 18 of column 17 was condensed<br>
by condenser 19. A part of the resultant condensate<br>
was refluxed to column top 18 of column 17 through con-<br><br>
duit 20 (reflux ratio: 1), while feeding the remainder<br>
of the condensate to an upper portion of carbon dioxide<br>
separation column 22 through conduit 21. From conduit<br>
23 provided at the bottom of carbon dioxide separation<br>
column 22, nitrogen gas was introduced into the conden-<br>
sate, thereby bubbling the condensate with the nitrogen<br>
gas. The nitrogen gas entraining carbon dioxide was<br>
discharged from conduit 24 provided at the top of col-<br>
umn 22. The resultant carbon dioxide-free liquid ob-<br>
tained in column 2 2 was withdrawn from conduit 2 5 pro-<br>
vided at a lower portion of column 22, and recycled to<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 at the<br>
30th stage thereof at a flow rate of 70.2 g/h.<br>
[0107] A liquid was withdrawn from the bottom of low<br>
boiling point mixture separation column 17 (hereinbelow,<br>
the liquid is referred to simply as "bottom liquid of<br>
column 17"). The bottom liquid of column 17 contained<br>
EG and DEG in concentrations of 67.6 % by weight and<br>
17.3 % by weight, respectively. The bottom liquid of<br>
column 17 was withdrawn at a flow rate of 163.9 g/h<br>
through conduit 30 as an etherification reaction mix-<br>
ture, while the remainder of the bottom liquid of col-<br>
umn 17 was heated by reboiler 28 and returned to column<br>
bottom 26 of column 17 through conduit 29. The etheri-<br>
fication reaction mixture contained EG and DEG in con-<br><br>
centrations of 99.7 % by weight and 0.17 % by weight,<br>
respectively (EC was not detected).<br>
[0108] The etherification reaction mixture was fed to<br>
EG purification column 41 at a position 90 cm below the<br>
top of column 41 through conduit 30, wherein column 41<br>
was comprised of a packed column type distillation col-<br>
umn having an inner diameter of 2.5 cm and a packing<br>
height of 120 cm and having packed therein Dixon pack-<br>
ings (3 mmϕ) .<br>
[0109] EG purification column 41 was operated under<br>
conditions wherein the pressure of column top 42<br>
thereof was 4,000 Pa (30 torr) and the temperature of<br>
column bottom 43 thereof was 123.5 °C. A distillate<br>
was withdrawn in a liquid form through conduit 56 pro-<br>
vided at a position 50 cm below the top of column 41 at<br>
a flow rate of 160.9 g/h, to thereby obtain a side-cut<br>
distillate. A mixture distilled from column top 42 of<br>
column 41 was condensed by condenser 45. A part of the<br>
resultant condensate was refluxed to column top 42 of<br>
column 41 through conduit 47 (reflux ratio: 2), while<br>
withdrawing the remainder of the condensate through<br>
conduit 48. A liquid was withdrawn from the bottom of<br>
EG purification column 41 through conduit 49 (hereinbe-<br>
low, the liquid is referred to simply as "bottom liquid<br>
of column 41"). The bottom liquid of column 41 con-<br><br>
tained EG and DEG in concentrations of 65.2 % by weight<br>
and 20.3 % by weight, respectively. 2.8 g of the bot-<br>
tom liquid of column 41 was withdrawn every two hours<br>
from the production system through conduit 52, while<br>
the remainder of the bottom liquid of column 41 was<br>
returned to column bottom 43 of column 41 through re-<br>
boiler 50 and conduit 51.<br>
[0110] From the above data, it can be seen that the<br>
yield of DMC (containing 1,150 ppm of carbonate ether)<br>
was 99.8 %, the selectivity for DMC was not lower than<br>
99 %, and EG was obtained in a yield of 99.8 %.<br>
[0111] The above-obtained DMC and phenol were sub-<br>
jected to a transesterification reaction, thereby ob-<br>
taining diphenyl carbonate (DPC). 235 g of the ob-<br>
tained DPC and 228 g of bisphenol A were charged into a<br>
vacuum reactor equipped with a stirrer. The atmosphere<br>
in the vacuum reactor was purged with nitrogen gas, and<br>
the temperature was gradually elevated from 180 °C to<br>
220 °C while stirring. Thereafter, the vacuum reactor<br>
was hermetically closed. Then, polymerization was per-<br>
formed while stirring at 100 rpm under a pressure of<br>
8,000 Pa for 30 minutes and, then, under a pressure of<br>
4,000 Pa for 90 minutes. Subsequently, the temperature<br>
was elevated to 270 °C, and further polymerization was<br>
performed under a pressure of 70 Pa for 1 hour, thereby<br><br>
obtaining an aromatic polycarbonate. The obtained aro-<br>
matic polycarbonate was colorless and transparent,<br>
which is good. The number average molecular weight was<br>
10,500.<br>
[0112] Comparative Example 1<br>
Production of DMC and EG was performed in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 1 except that the<br>
ethylene oxide content of EC used as a raw material was<br>
changed to 5,000 ppm. As a result, there were obtained<br>
DMC (containing 15,300 ppm of carbonate ether) and EG,<br>
wherein the yield of DMC was 96.4 %, the selectivity<br>
for DMC was 95.2 %, and the yield of EG was 9 4.3 %.<br>
From the obtained DMC, DPC was produced in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1. From the obtained DPC, an aro-<br>
matic polycarbonate was produced in the same manner as<br>
in Example 1. The obtained aromatic polycarbonate was<br>
discolored to assume a yellow color and had a number<br>
average molecular weight of 6,300. A comparison be-<br>
tween the results of Example 1 and the results of this<br>
Comparative Example 1 shows that, from a cyclic carbon-<br>
ate containing a large amount of a cyclic ether, a<br>
dialkyl carbonate containing a high concentration of a<br>
carbonate ether is obtained, and that, from such a<br>
dialkyl carbonate containing a high concentration of a<br><br>
carbonate ether, it is impossible to obtain highly re-<br>
active diphenyl carbonate necessary for producing a<br>
high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate.<br>
[0113] Example 2<br>
Production of DMC and EG was performed in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 1 except that the<br>
ethylene oxide content of EC used as a raw material was<br>
changed to 1,200 ppm. As a result, there were obtained<br>
DMC (containing 3,400 ppm of carbonate ether) and EG,<br>
wherein the yield of DMC was 99.6 %, the selectivity<br>
for DMC was not lower than 99 %, and the yield of EG<br>
was 99.6 %. From the obtained DMC, DPC was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example 1. From the obtained DPC,<br>
an aromatic polycarbonate was produced in the same man-<br>
ner as in Example 1. The obtained aromatic polycarbon-<br>
ate was colorless and had a number average molecular<br>
weight of 10,200.<br>
[0114] Example 3<br>
Production of DMC and EG was performed in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 1 except that the<br>
ethylene oxide content of EC used as a raw material was<br>
changed to 2,000 ppm. As a result, there were obtained<br>
DMC (containing 5,600 ppm of carbonate ether) and EG,<br><br>
wherein the yield of DMC was 99.2 %, the selectivity<br>
for DMC was not lower than 99 %, and the yield of EG<br>
was 99.1 %. From the obtained DMC, DPC was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example 1. From the obtained DPC,<br>
an aromatic polycarbonate was produced in the same man-<br>
ner as in Example 1. The obtained aromatic polycarbon-<br>
ate was colorless and had a number average molecular<br>
weight of 9,100.<br><br>
