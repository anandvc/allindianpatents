Compounds of formula I are quaternary ammonium salts and may be converted between different salt forms using ion exchange chromatography. The compounds can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallization. Compounds of formula I can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified using known methods. Isomers, such as enantiomers, may be obtained in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallization, chiral phase chromatography or asymmetric synthesis from correspondingly asymmetrically substituted, e.g. optically active, starting materials.<br>
Compounds of formula I in pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt or zwitterionic form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as agents of the invention, are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt or zwitterionic form for use as a pharmaceutical. The agents of the invention act as muscarinic antagonists, particularly muscarinic M3 receptor antagonists, thereby inhibiting acetylcholine-induced contraction of smooth muscle in e.g. respiratory tract, digestive tract and urinary systems.<br>
The affinity (Ki) of agents of the invention at the human muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor can be determined in a competitive filtration binding assay with the radio-labelled antagonist [3H] n-methyl scopolamine methyl chloride (NMS):<br><br>
Membranes prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with human M3 receptor at 10 \xg protein/ well are incubated with serial dilutions of the agents of the invention, [3H]NMS (0.25 nM) and assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCh at pH 7.4) for 17 hours at room temperature. The assay is carried out in a 250 \xL final volume, in the presence of a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 1%. Total binding of [3H]NMS is determined in the absence of the agents of the invention with a corresponding substituted volume of assay buffer. Non-specific binding of [3H] NMS is determined in the presence of 300 nM ipratropium bromide. Following the incubation period, the membranes are harvested onto a Unifilter™ GF/B filter plate containing 0.05 % polyethyleneimine, using a Brandel™ filtration harvester 9600. Filter plates are dried for two hours at 35°C before the addition of Microscint™ 'O' cocktail, and read on a Packard Topcount™ scintillator using a 3H-5cintillation protocol. All IC50s are calculated with the aid of XL-Fit graph package and Kj values derived using the Cheng-Prusoff correction (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H. (1973) Biochem. Pharmacol 22 3099-3109).<br>
The compounds of the Examples herein below generally have Ki values below 1 \iM in the above assay. For instance, the compounds of Examples 17, 34, 52, 54, 71, 76, 96, 114, 138, 159,170,190, 209, 221, 242 and 244 have M3 K,- values of 0.0144, 0.0023, 0.0019, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.0011, 0.0046, 0.0002, 0.0022. 0.0007, 0.0007, 0.0007, 0.0010, 0.0013, 0.0003 and 0.0003 JJM respectively.<br>
Having regard to their inhibition of acetyl choline binding to M3 muscarinic receptors, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of conditions mediated by the muscarinic M3 receptor, particularly those associated with increased parasympathetic tone leading to, for example, excessive glandular secretion or smooth muscle contraction. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Having regard to their antimuscarinic activity, the agents of the invention are useful in the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and the relief of bronchoconstriction. Relief of bronchoconstriction can be measured in models such as the in vivo plethysmography models of Chong et al,/. Pharmacol* Toxicol. Methods 1998, 39,163, Hammelmann et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 1997, 156, 766 and analogous models. The agents of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. In view of their long duration of action, it is possible to administer the agents'of the invention once-a-day in the treatment of such diseases. In another aspect, agents of the invention commonly exhibit characteristics indicating a low incidence of side effects commonly encountered with P2<br><br>
agonists such as tachycardia, tremor and restlessness, such agents accordingly being suitable for use in on demand (rescue) treatment as well as prophylactic treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases.<br>
Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics.  (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping".  "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant from any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include adult/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary or airways disease (COPD or COAD), including chronic bronchitis, or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactiviry consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br><br>
Having regard to their antimuscarinic activity, the agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of a condition requiring relaxation of smooth muscle of the uterus, bladder or vascular system. They are thus useful for the prevention or alleviation of premature labour pains in pregnancy. They are also useful in the treatment of chronic and acute urticaria, psoriasis, allergic conjunctivitis, actinitis, rhinitis including allergic rhinitis, mastocytosis, urinary disorders such as urinary incontinence (particularly that caused by overactive bladder), pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cytospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia, as well as in ophthalmic interventions.<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in combination with other drug substances such as anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory, antihistamine, decongestant or anti-tussive drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such drugs. An agent of the invention may be mixed with one or more other drug substances in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the other drug substance(s). Accordingly the invention includes a combination of an agent of the invention as hereinbefore described with an anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory, antihistamine, decongestant or anti-tussive drug substance, said agent of the invention and said drug substance being in the same or different pharmaceutical composition. Such anti-inflammatory drugs include steroids, for example glucocorticosteroids such as budesonide, beclamethasone, fluticasone, ciclesonide or mometasone, or steroids described in WO 02/88167, WO 02/12266, WO 02/100879 or WO 02/00679, especially those of Examples 3, 11, 14, 17, 19, 26, 34, 37, 39, 51, 60, 67, 72, 73, 90, 99 and 101, and non-steroidal steroid agonists such as those described in WO 00/00531, WO 02/10143, WO 03/082280, WO 03/082787, WO 03/104195, WO 04/005229; LTB4 antagonists such as those described in US 5451700; LTD4 antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast; PDE4 inhibitors such as cilomilast (Ariflo® GlaxoSmithKline), Roflumilast (Byk Gulden),V-11294A (Napp), BAY19-8004 (Bayer), SCH-351591 (Schering-Plough), Arofylline (Almirall Prodesfarma), PD189659 (Parke-Davis), AWD-12-281 (Asta Medica), CDC-801 (Celgene), SelCID(TM) CC-10004 (Celgene), KW-4490 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo), WO 03/104204, WO 03/104205, WO 04/000814, WO 04/000839 and WO 04005258 (Merck), as well as those described in WO 98/18796 and WO 03/39544; A2a agonists such as those described in EP 1052264, EP 1241176, EP 409595A2, WO 94/17090, WO 96/02543, WO 96/02553, WO 98/28319, WO<br><br>

In another aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore described for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease.<br>
The agents of the invention may be administered by any appropriate route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of a tablet or capsule; parenterally, for example intravenously; topically to the skin, for example in the treatment of psoriasis; intranasally, for example in the treatment of hay fever; or, preferably, by inhalation, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. In particular, the agents of the invention may be delivered as an inhalable formulation for the treatment of COPD and asthma.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier thereof. Such compositions may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets and capsules. Formulations for topical administration may take the form of creams, ointments, gels or transdermal delivery systems, e.g. patches. Compositions for inhalation may comprise aerosol or other atomizable formulations or dry powder formulations.<br>
When the composition comprises an aerosol formulation, it preferably contains, for example, a hydro-fluoro-alkane (HFA) propellant such as HFAl34a or HFA227 or a mixture of these, and may contain one or more co-solvents known in the art such as ethanol (up to 20% by weight), and/or one or more surfactants such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, and/or one or more bulking agents such as lactose. When the composition comprises a dry powder formulation, it preferably contains, for example, the compound of formula I having a particle diameter up to 10 microns, optionally together with a diluent or carrier, such as lactose, of the desired particle size distribution and a compound that helps to protect against product performance deterioration due to moisture. When the composition comprises a nebulised formulation, it preferably contains, for example, the compound of formula I either dissolved, or suspended, in a vehicle containing water, a co-solvent such as ethanol or propylene glycol and a stabiliser, which may be a surfactant.<br><br>

Dosages of agents of the invention employed in practising the present invention will of course vary depending, for example, on the particular condition to be treated, the effect desired and the mode of administration. In general, suitable daily dosages for administration by inhalation are of the order of 0.0001 to 30 mg/kg, typically 0.01 to 10 mg per patient, while for oral administration suitable daily doses are of the order of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
