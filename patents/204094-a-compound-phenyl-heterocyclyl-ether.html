The pharmaceutical^ acceptable solvates of the compounds of the invention include the hydrates thereof.<br>
8<br><br>
Also included within the scope of the compound and various salts of the invention are polymorphs thereof.<br>
Hereinafter, compounds their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, their solvates or polymorphs, defined in any aspect of the invention (except intermediate compounds in chemical processes) are referred to as "compounds of the invention".<br>
The compounds of the invention have the advantage that they are selective inhibitors of the re-uptake of serotonin (SFHs) (and so are likely to have reduced side effects), they have a rapid onset of action (making them suitable for administration shortly before an effect is required), they have desirable potency and associated properties. Compounds that selectively inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, but not noradrenaline or dopamine, are preferred.<br>
The compounds of the invention may possess one or more chiral centres and so exist in a number of stereoisomeric forms. All stereoisomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention. Racemic compounds may either be separated using preparative HPLC and a column with a chiral stationary phase or resolved to yield individual enantiomers utilising methods known to those skilled in the art. In addition, chiral intermediate compounds may be resolved and used to prepare chiral compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in one or more tautomeric forms. All tautomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention. For example, a claim to 2-hydroxypyrid'myl would also cover its tautomeric form, oc-pyridonyl.<br>
The invention also includes radiolabeled compounds.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected derivatives of compounds of the invention, which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances,<br>
9<br><br>
be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as "prodrugs". Further, certain compounds of the invention may act as prodrugs of other compounds of the invention.<br>
All protected derivatives and prodrugs of compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention. Examples of suitable pro-drugs for the compounds of the present invention are described in Drugs of Today, Volume 19, Number 9,1983, pp 499 - 538 and in Topics in Chemistry, Chapter 31, pp 306 -316 and in "Design of Prodrugs" by H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985, Chapter 1 (the disclosures in which documents are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that certain moieties, known to those skilled in the art as "pro-moieties", for example as described by H. Bundgaard in "Design of Prodrugs" (the disclosure in which document is incorporated herein by reference) may be placed on appropriate functionalities when such functionalities are present within compounds of the invention.<br>
Preferred prodrugs for compounds of the invention include: esters, carbonate esters, hemi-esters, phosphate esters, nitro esters, sulfate esters, sulfoxides, amides, carbamates, azo-compounds, phosphamides, glycosides, ethers, acetals and ketals.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared, in known manner in a variety of ways. In the following reaction schemes and hereafter, unless otherwise stated R1 to R13, L, U, M, Q, W, Y and Z are as defined in the first aspect. These processes form further aspects of the invention.<br>
Throughout the specification, general formulae are designated by Roman numerals I, U, H\, IV etc. Subsets of these general formulae are defined as la, lb, Ic etc, .... IVa, IVb, IVc etc.<br>
10<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula I may be prepared from compounds of general formula II by a variety of methods (see Scheme 1) Scheme 1<br><br>
NR1R2<br><br>
i)        Compounds of general formula I may be prepared from compounds of general formula II where T is -CHO, by reaction with an amine of formula HNR^R2 (or a salt thereof), followed by reduction with a hydride reducing agent in a suitable solvent. When either R1 or R2 is hydrogen, suitable solvents include protic solvents such as ethanol, and sodium borohydride is an appropriate reducing agent as exemplified by Examples 18 to 33 and 56 to 57 herein. When neither R1 or R2 are hydrogen, tetrahydrofuran/ dichloromethane is a suitable solvent system and sodium triacetoxyborohydride is a suitable reducing agent.

~M~<br><br>
drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WOA-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
For oral or parenteral administration to human patients the daily dosage levels of the compounds of the invention will be from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg (in single or divided doses) and preferably will be in the range 0.01 to 5 mg/kg. Thus tablets will contain 1 mg to 0.4g of compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician will in any event determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any particular patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are, of course only exemplary of the average case and there may be instances where higher or lower doses are merited, and such are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Oral administration is preferred. Preferably, administration takes place shortly before an effect is required.<br>
For veterinary use, a compound of the invention, or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof, or a veterinarily acceptable solvate or pro-drug thereof, is administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in accordance with normal veterinary practice and the veterinary surgeon will determine the dosing regimen and route of administration which will be most appropriate for a particular animal.<br>
Thus according to a further aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation containing a compound of formula (I), as defined in the first aspect, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.<br>

SMe<br>
(i) Preparation of 3-f3-methyl-4-(methvlsulfanvl)phenoxv1isonicotinic acid 6M NaOH (200 mL) was added to a solution of the nitrile of preparation 47 (32.3 g of uncolumned material prepared from 0.12 mmol of 3-chloroisonicotinonitriie) in EtOH (200 mL) and the mixture was heated at reflux for 7 h. After cooling to room temperature the volume was reduced to approximately 200 mL and the mixture was diluted with water (800 mL). The pH was adjusted to 1 with cone. HCi, keeping the temperature below 35°C using an ice bath, and the resulting cream precipitate was filtered. The water wet paste was transferred to a 2L round bottomed flask, suspended in toluene and concentrated in vacuo (3 x 500 mL). Drying in vacuo overnight at 50°C then gave the title acid (35 g) as a iight brown powder which was carried into the following step without further purification; 5H (CD3OD, 400 MHz) 2.27 (3H, s), 2.40 (3H, s), 6.87 (2H, m), 7.24 (1H, d), 7.95 (1H, br), 8.28 (1H, s), 8.47 (1H, d). (ii) Preparation of 3-r3-methv[-4-(methvlsulfanvl)phenoxvIisonicotinamide<br><br>
CDI (19.46 g, 0.12 mol) was added to a suspension of the preceding acid (35 g) in THF (600 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 80 min. The surface of the reaction was flushed with nitrogen to remove CO2 and a 2IV1 solution of methylamine in THF (88 mL, 0.176 mol) was added dropwise over 15 min. The mixture was stirred overnight and the solvent was then removed in vacuo. The residue was taken up in ether (1 L), washed with saturated NH4CI (aq) (2 x 300 mL), 2M NaOH (2 x 300 mL) and brine, dried (MgS04) and evaporated to give the title amide (28.3 g, 82% from 3-chloroisonicotinonitrile) as an orange foam; 5H (CDCI3, 400 MHz) 2.37 (3Hf s), 2.48 (3H, s), 3.02 (3H, d), 6.93 (2H, m), 7.21 (1H, d), 7.60 (1H, br), 8.07 (1H, d), 8.20 (1H, s), 8.44 (1H, d); MSm/z(ES+)211 (MNa+).<br>

Under N2 in a 250 mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and magnetic stirrer, 3,4-dichlorophenol (2.9 g, 17.8 mmol) was added to a suspension of K2C03 (7.0 g, 51 mmol) in 70 mL of anhydrous DMF. After stirring the mixture for 15 min., 2-chloronicotinaldehyde (2.4 g, 17 mmol prepared according to the method in J. HeterocycL Chem. 1995, 32,1595) was added and the mixture was heated to 90-100 °C for 5 h. After allowing the reaction to cool to room temperature overnight, the mixture was diluted with water and extracted three times with EtOAc. The aqueous layer was then extracted with additional EtOAc and the organic layers were combined, washed with water and brine and dried over Na2S04.

Cyanopyridine-N-oxide (250 g, 2.08 mol) was added portionwise to a stirred suspension of PCI5 (599.94 g, 2.88 mol) and POCI3 (800 mL, 8.71 mol) at 20°C under nitrogen, in a reactor fitted with a reflux condensor. During the addition the temperature rose to 41 °C. The mixture was stirred at 100°C for 3 h then cooled to 95°C and transferred to a mixture of 6M HCI (200 mL) and a 6:4 mixture of ice and water (5994 g) at such a rate that the temperature stayed below 15°C (about 35 min). The resulting brown solution was cooled to below 5°C and taken to pH 4.15 by adding 33% aqueous NaOH (about 4.5 L), keeping the temperature below 5°C. The resulting beige precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with water (4 x 500 mL), sucking as dry as possible. The residue was suspended in water (1.5 L) and n-heptane (7 L) and stirred at 30°C for 1 h. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted further with n-heptane (2x2 L), stirring for 30 min each time at 30°C. The combined heptane layers were combined, dried (Na2S04, 136 g), filtered and the resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to a weight of 1.9 kg (about 3 L), at which point the product began to crystallise. The mixture was cooled to 0°C, stirred for 1.5 h then the product was filtered, washed with cold n-heptane (2 x 125 mL) and dried at room temperature in a circulating air drier to give the product (129.08 g, 44.8%) as a crystalline solid; m.p. 73.4°C.<br>
Biological Activity<br>
A number of compounds were tested for biological activity by their ability to inhibit the<br>
uptake of serotonin by human serotonin transporters as follows.<br>
(i)        Cell Culture<br>
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) stably transfected with either the human serotonin transporter (hSERT), noradrenaline transporter (hNET) or dopamine transporter (hDAT) were cultured under standard cell culture techniques (cells were grown at 37°C and 5% C02 in DMEM-culture media (supplemented with 10% dialysed foetal calf serum (FCS), 2mM l-glutamine and 250{xg/ml geneticin)). Cells were harvested for the assay to yield a cell suspension of 750,000 cells/ml.<br>
(i)        Determination of inhibitor potency<br><br>
	P<br>
All test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted down in assay buffer to give appropriate test concentrations. Assays were carried out in 96-well filter bottom plates. Cells (7500 cells/assay well) were pre-incubated in standard assay buffer containing either test compound, standard inhibitor or compound vehicle (1 % DMSO) for 5 minutes. Reactions were started by addition of either 3H-Serotonin, 3H-NoradrenaIine or 3H-Dopamine substrates. All reactions were carried out at room temperature in a shaking incubator. Incubation times were 5 minutes for the hSERT and hDAT assays and 15 minutes for the hNET assay. Reactions were terminated by removal of the reaction mixture using a vacuum manrfold followed by rapid washing with ice cold assay buffer. The quantity of 3H-substrate incorporated into the cells was then quantified.<br>
Assay plates were dried in a microwave oven, scintillation fluid added, and radioactivity measured. Potency of test compounds was quantified as IC50 values (concentration of test compound required to inhibit the specific uptake of radiolabelled substrate into the cells by 50%).<br>
(iii)      Standard Assay Buffer Composition: Trizma hydrochloride (26mM) NaCI (124mM) KCI(4.5mM) KH2P04(1.2mM) MgCI2.6H20 (1.3mM) Ascorbic acid (1.136mM) Glucose (5.55mM) pH 7.40 CaCI2(2.8mM) Pargyline(100uM)<br>
Note:   The pH of the buffer was adjusted to 7.40 with 1M NaOH before addition of CaCi2 and pargyline.<br>
