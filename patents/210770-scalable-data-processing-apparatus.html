Scalable data processing apparatus<br>
The present invention concerns a scalable data processing apparatus, particularly a data storage apparatus, comprising one or more thin-film devices which form a planar layer generated by a number of coextensive stacked sublayers of thin-film material, wherein the sublayers of each thin-film device comprises electrical isolating and/or conducting and/or semi conducting structures and structures with information storage capability realized in the thin-film material in a sublayer, wherein the structures register with or contact electrically other structures of this kind in adjacent sublayers in the stack forming the thin-film device for realizing active and passive electronic circuits elements or logic cells in the thin-film device, wherein the active and passive circuit elements in a thin-film device are realized with a three-dimensional architecture and extend through two or more sublayers thereof, wherein the circuit elements are electrically connected by horizontal electrical conducting structures in one or more sublayers and vertical electrical conducting structures extending through one or more of the sublayers, and wherein two or more thin-film devices are provided.<br>
It is known in the art to create memory devices in the form of thin-film circuits in stacked configurations and wherein a memory device additionally may be combined with processors for controlling, driving and addressing the memory, but then with the latter realized in inorganic semiconducting materials, either in the form of single crystal rigid substrates and/or thin-film provided on a carrier substrate which very well may be exceptionally thin, for instance formed as films of silicon dioxide. A complete memory device with processing circuits is created by juxtaposition of the layers and often with transfer of the thin-film circuits by means of special methods. In order to provide interconnections between the layers, visa through a set of holes in the layers are used and possibly combined with evaporation of metal in order to create the necessary current paths. Further there is from PCT/NO99/00180 which belongs to the present applicant and which hereby is incorporated by reference, known an integrated scalable data processing device which forms a complete computer with a mass memory and a combined processor and memory module wherein either in separate processor layers or separate memory layers or combined processor and memory layers are provided so-called intelligent random access memories (IRAM) and processors which realize the CPU function of the computer or which realize control and<br><br>
communication functions in the computer. In order to provide short current paths three-dimensional electrical structures are used to create interconnections between components in the separate layers and between the layers mutually. The whole data processing device is provided on a substrate which contains further high-speed processing circuits for control and communication purposes, these being realized with inorganic semiconducting materials in conventional technology, while the different layers of the data processing device otherwise wholly are realized in thin-film technology regardless of whether they concern processors or memories.<br>
Further instances of relevant prior art may be mentioned. US Patent No. 5714 768 (Ovshinsky &amp; al.) discloses a computational device with a processor and a particular memory array in thin-film technology mounted over the processor on the top of the device and disclosing the use of a memory medium based on various inorganic materials which may attain different electrical resistance values in response to selected electrical input signals to the separate memory cells. Particularly Ovshinsky &amp; al. discloses special memory elements in the form of so-called avionic memories which are based on electrical phase change and are made with inorganic chalcogenide compounds as switches. Each memory element is conceived as a single unit and is encapsulated and mutually isolated with insulating material, for instance of Si02 or Si3N4. The memory elements are arranged in a planar array structure which on each side is contacted by an overlying grid of electrode structures, the electrode structures in each grid being oriented perpendicular to the electrode structure in the other grid. Two-dimensional memory arrays of this kind can with proper mutual insulation now be stacked to form a vertical integrated memory structure provided on a substrate which may be a logic processing device comprising electronic circuitry. No hint or suggestion is given in Ovshinsky &amp; al. for stacking thin-film devices made of coextensive thin-film sublayers of thin-film material or wherein the thin-film devices comprises both circuit areas with active circuits and memory areas with memory modules realized by providing the sublayers of thin-film material with functional features according to purpose. Ferroelectric memory devices wherein a two-dimensional memory cell array in a passive electrode matrix is stacked to form a volumetric memory device, is moreover well-known in the art, for instance from US patent No. 5 329 485 (IsO nO &amp; al.) and US patent No. 5 375 085 (Gnade &amp; al.). Also the use of ferroelectric polymer materials for erasable memories, particularly<br><br>
embodiments based on the use of poly(vinylidene chloride) or poly(vinylidene-trifluoroethylene) copolymers has been proposed, e.g. in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin 37:421-424, No. 11 (1994). These polymers can be obtained as very thin films and the memory medium provided as a continuous layer of thin-film material with sets of parallel conducting electrodes deposited on either side and oriented mutually orthogonal. Such two-dimensional passive ferroelectric arrays can be stacked to form a three-dimensional structure. None of these above-mentioned publications, however, discloses thin-film devices comprising sublayers with functional features that will allow the realization of both active circuits and passive memory modules integrated in the thin-film devices.<br>
Finally three-dimensional memory-processor structures based on transferred thin-film circuits are disclosed in international published application WO95/09438 (Zavracky &amp; al.) and US patent No. 5 656 548 with the same inventors, both publications being based on US patent application No. 130 033 of 30 September 1993 and now abandoned. Particularly these publications disclose memory and processor circuit layers stacked or interpolated to form a three-dimensional structure, wherein the separate functional elements of the circuits are fabricated by patterning thin-film materials using conventional planar circuit technologies and interconnecting vertically by e.g. metallic vias extending through the structures.<br>
Even though prior art devices for data processing and storage based on the use of thin-film technology carry a number of advantages with regard to speed and functionality, they are for purely storage purposes often very costly and can particularly be complicated to produce. An effective memory management further requires a substantial processing capacity; for instance, for control, communication and addressing, are dedicated circuits for these purposes often being assigned to a large memory or several separate memories with large storage capacity.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a scalable data processing apparatus, particularly a data storage apparatus which is relatively simple and inexpensive to make and which in principle allows for almost unlimited scaling of the data storage capacity without the management and operation of the memory becoming complicated.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to realize a scalable data processing apparatus, particularly a data storage apparatus substantially in thin-film technology which allows implementation of supporting functions for control and addressing of memories realized in thin-film technology, the electronic circuits for the mentioned purposes to be integrated with memories in the thin-film device.<br>
Finally it is also an object of the present invention to realize a volumetric data storage device with large storage density, fast data access and high data transfer rate, optionally combined with parallel input of data in the data memory and fast parallel readout of data therefrom.<br>

The main object of the present invention is to provide a data storage device and the apparatus according to the invention will hence in the following be regarded to realize a memory device and be termed as "apparatus". The basis of the present invention is that the apparatus can be realized in the form of mutually adjacent and substantially parallel stacked layers, each of these stacked layers being formed as a thin-film device which in its turn is composed of a plurality of sublayers of thin film with specific and different functions and possibly made of different materials.<br><br>
A thin-film device 1 as used in the present invention is shown in plan view in fig. la. The thin-film device 1 is organized respectively in a circuit area 2, memory areas 3 and an interface area 4. In fig. lb there is shown a section through the thin-film device in fig. Ic taken along the line A-A. The memory areas 3 which contain memories 3' realized in thin-film technology, are here shown provided within the circuit area 2 which contains thin-film based electronic circuitry for implementing control, communication and addressing functions for the memories. Depending on the memory type the addressing function will for instance comprise writing, reading and erasing in the memory, as well as communication to and from the memory over the interface area 4, Fig. Ic shows a section through the thin-film device in fig. la, also taken along the line A-A, but here in another embodiment than that in fig. lb, the memory areas 3 here being shown with vertically stacked thin-film memories 3' in the circuit area 2, but mutually isolated by electrical isolating layers 5. It is in this connection to be understood that also each separate memory 3' of course is constituted by a number of separate sublayers, such as will be discussed in more detail in the following, and further that the not in particular shown electronic circuitry in the circuit area 2 via the interface area 4 not only is used for controlling and addressing of memories in the separate thin-film device, but also communicates with corresponding circuitry and other memories in adjacently provided thin-film devices 1.<br>
It is the circumstance that each separate thin-film device 1 is composed of a large number of sublayers, typically for instance several tens, while the separate memory 3' does not need to comprise more than four to five sublayers, which allows several memories to be stacked, either vertically as shown in fig. Ic or in another advantageous embodiment as shown in plan view in fig. 2a and in fig. 2b taken in section along the line B-B in fig. 2a. Here the separate memories 3' in the thin-film device 1 again are provided stacked, but mutually staggered. In fig. 2a and 2b there are shown four memory stacks with four memories 3' and mutually isolated by electrical isolating layers 5. Only respectively the lowermost and the uppermost memory in each stack are indicated with the reference number 3'.<br>
Another embodiment of the thin-film device 1 as used in the present invention is shown in fig. 3a which substantially corresponds to the embodiment in fig. 2a and with the memory stacks created with the memories<br><br>
staggered, but now along a diagonal line such the stack appears as shown in plan view in fig. Sa, in section in fig. 3b taken along the line C-C in fig 3a, and in section in fig. 3c taken along the line D-D in fig. 3a. An arrangement of the memory in the stack as shown in respectively fig. 2a and fig. 3a can be advantageous with regard to better exploitation of the real estate in the circuit area 2, while the staggering can simplify the interconnection between memories and electronic circuitry in the circuit area 2. It is of course to be understood that the mutual arrangement of the memories 3' in the memory area 3 in the circuit area 2 essentially is not limited to some specific geometry, but may be varied within boundaries given by the embodiment and the form factor of the thin-film device 1.<br>
Fig. 4 shows schematically the embodiment of an essentially passive matrix addressable memory 3'. A memory of this kind is for instance disclosed in PCT/NO98/00185 which belongs to the present applicant and which hereby is incorporated by reference. In fig. 4 a memory medium 6 is provided in sandwich with respectively an underlying electrode set consisting of parallel stripe electrodes 7 and an overlying electrode set consisting of parallel stripe electrodes 8. By applying a voltage to respectively an underlying and an overlying electrode 7;8, there will in a memory medium 6 at the crossing between the electrodes be obtained a change of state which for instance can be expressed by change of the impedance in the memory medium. The memory medium 6 itself will preferably be made of a molecular material, or a carbonaceous inorganic or organic material. Usually it will be desirable that the memory medium shall have a non-linear impedance characteristic, and by addressing a not shown memory cell formed in the crossing between an underlying electrode 7 and an overlying electrode 8, it will be desirable to prevent the generation of so-called sneak currents to other memory cells in the memory matrix. This can advantageously be achieved by providing the memory medium with rectifying properties, preferably by incorporating a layer which forms a diode junction or by the memory medium 6 itself spontaneously forming a diode junction with the electrode material.<br>
If the memory material 6 is a polymer, its information storage capability can depend on a change of an impedance value thereof under applied electric current or voltage and keeping this changed impedance value also after the current or voltage has been turned off The memory can also be a switchable material, for instance a ferroelectric aL material in the form of a polymer, the<br><br>
polarization state of which then could represent a specific logic state, or a charge transfer metal organic complex such as M(TCNQ). Generally there is in the art known a number of different memory materials which may be used in matrix-addressable memories and there shall in this connection for instance be referred the above-mentioned publication PCT/NO98/00185. In fig, 4 the memory is provided in a sandwich arrangement, but this is, however, no condition and it is wholly possible to employ another electrode configuration, for instance a bridge configuration as disclosed in PCT/NO98/00212 which belongs to the present applicant and where the underlying electrode 7 and the overlying electrode 8 will be mutually isolated in a crossing and the memory material 6 provided over the electrodes, something which, of course, requires that the memory material must have the properties which ensure its information storage capability also in such a case. Typically a memory material in this case may be a conjugated polymer.<br>
The interconnection between the memory 3' an a circuit 9 in the circuit area 2 is shown schematically and in plan view in fig. 5a. Each of the electrodes 6,7 in the matrix is connected to the circuit 9 via word and bit lines 10. In a section taken along the line E-E in fig. 5a, the arrangement in fig. 5a formed as sublayers Srst in the thin-film device 1 will appear as shown in fig. 5b, where are shown two stacked memories 3\, 3*2 and the circuit 9 which wholly are realized in a thin-film technology. Particularly it is to be observed that current paths and conductor paths for the memory 3', that is underlying and overlying electrodes 7;8 as well as the lines 10 which connect the electrodes to the circuit 9, substantially all are provided in the same sublayer, here for instance S2, S4, Sg and Sg, something which will make it more easy to generate such current paths and conductor paths in the form of electrical conducting structures in one and the same sublayer, according to purpose.<br>
Fig. 6a shows how several thin-film devices 1, in this case three, are joined into a stacked configuration. As before are the circuit areas are denoted with 2 and the memory areas denoted with 3 and in the figure shown with mutual registration, but this is no condition. The interface area 4 is provided on the side of the circuit areas and registers correspondingly, the electrical connections between the thin-film devices 1 being indicated schematically with arrows 4' and extending vertically through the interface area 4. Further the interface area 4 can be made with I/O interfaces 12 which connect the<br><br>
thin-film devices 1 with not shown external devices or peripheral devices for input and output of data.<br>
Fig. 6b again shows the thin-film devices 1 in stacked configuration, but now provided on a substrate 13 with active electronic circuits 14. This substrate can well be realized in an inorganic semiconducting material, for instance silicon or modifications of silicon, and the active electronic circuits for instance be realized in CMOS technology. The active electronic circuits 14 in the substrate 13 are intended for control and communication tasks in the management of memories in the thin-film devices and are adapted for cooperating with thin-film circuits in the circuit areas 2 of the thin-film devices 1. This will leave more room in the thin-film devices 1 for memory purposes, as the thin-film circuits in the circuit areas 2 in this case can be restricted to that which is necessary in order to maintain an effective control and driving of the memory, while processing tasks, for instance with regard to parallel input and output of data to the memory and for error correction, memory recapping etc. may be handled by processing devices implemented by the active electronic circuits 14 in the substrate. Vertical interconnections 4' in the interface area 4 in the stacked thin-film devices communicate with an interface portion 15 on the substrate 13, and the electrical connection through this interface portion and between the circuits 14 and the vertical interconnections 4' can for instance be provided by metallic vias formed in the interface portion 15, but this must take place in a CMOS-compatible process if CMOS circuits are provided in the substrate. Instead of creating the I/O-interface 12 in the interface area 4 in the stacked thin-film devices, this I/O-interface 12 may now provided in connection with the interface 15 of the substrate.<br>
Another embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is shown in fig. 6c. Here, as before, are thin-film devices provided in a stacked configuration on the substrate 13, but instead of providing the interface area 4 of the thin-film devices 1 in an edge portion thereof, there are instead provided separate interface areas 4 in order to create vertical interconnections between the thin-film devices 1 and between these and the interface 15 in the substrate 13. This can in its turn contribute to a topologically regarded advantageous layout of the circuit area in the separate thin-film device and reduce the need for horizontal current paths therein.<br><br>
In a variant of the embodiment in fig. 6c the apparatus can be realized as shown in fig. 7. Here separation layers 16 are provided between each thin-film device 1, such these layers for instance are known from NO patent application no. 98 0781 which belongs to the present applicant and which is hereby incorporated by reference. These separation layers can either separately or in selected combinations implement for instance an electrical, thermal, optical or mechanical isolating function. In a stacked configuration they may also be used as planarization layers. When the interface areas 4 in the thin-film devices 1 are provided as shown in fig. 7, this however presupposes that they are passed through the separation layers 16 and this must be done by interconnections for instance in the form of vias in the separation layers, something which in regard of the isolating function may be detrimental and additionally also lead to cost-increasing fabrication steps. One way to avoid this is to provide thin-film devices 1 as before in the stacked configuration, but now mutually staggered.<br>
An embodiment of this is shown in fig. 8a where the thin-film devices once again are provided on a substrate 13 and mutually separated by separation layers 16, but where the interface area 4 is provided between the interface 15 in the substrate 13 and above the exposed steps in the thin-film devices on the side thereof. The interconnections between the thin-film devices 1 mutually or between these and the substrate 15 are schematically indicated by respectively horizontal and vertical interconnections 4'.<br>
In the embodiment in fig. 8a may further a not shown carrier substrate be provided adjacent to thin-film device 1 on the opposite side of the stacked configuration. In the fabrication can then the arrangement of the thin-film devices 1 take place from the not-shown carrier substrate and upwards, hereafter the substrate 13 with active electronic circuits 14 is provided on top of the stacked configuration as a last step in the fabrication process. This implies that the interconnections over the interface area 4 and to the interface portion 15 are realized after the placement of the thin-film devices 1 in a preceeding fabrication step, something which in a number of cases may be advantageous both with regard to costs and a simplification in the creation of the interconnections.<br>
Fig. 8b shows an approximately corresponding embodiment to that in fig. 8a, with thin-film devices 1 provided mutually separated by separation layers 16<br><br>
and once again provided staggered in a stacked configuration, such that the thin-film device 1 closest to the substrate 13 does not cover this wholly, but forms a step down to the surface of the substrate. Then once again the interface area 4 may be provided above the stepped portions in the stacked configuration and interconnections 4' between the thin-film devices 1 mutually or between these and the interface 15 in the substrate 13 extending horizontally and vertically over the steps in the stacked configuration.<br>
Fig. 9 shows quite schematically how each separate thin-film device 11; I2; I3 are constituted by a number of sublayers, here shown as four layers 81-84. Horizontal electrical interconnections can be created as an integral part of a sublayer S by a conversion of thin-film material in this sublayer and correspondingly vertical electrical conducting interconnections can be created through the sublayers S by registering portions of electrical conducting material in the thin film. Under particular conditions can such electrical conducting or semiconducting structures be generated in situ in an already formed thin-film stack or they can be generated separately in each separate sublayer 8 which then is laminated or in another manner joined into a stack which forms a thin-film device 1. In PCT/NO99/00023 which belongs to the present applicant and which hereby is incorporated by reference, there is discussed a method for generating horizontal and vertical electrical conducting structures in situ by means of radiation, for instance light radiation or particle radiation, for thus creating three-dimensional electrical conducting and semiconducting structures in a stacked thin-film device. The generation of such structures can however also take place by means of electric fields which are applied spatially modulated in order to pattern the separate sublayer S by means of a special generator/modulator device, such this is discussed in PCT/NO99/00022 which belongs to the present applicant and which also shall be incorporated by reference.<br>
The apparatus according to the present invention is shown exploded in its main components in fig- 10 where it appears with three thin-film devices li; I2; I3 and the interface area 4 provided in an edge portion of the thin-film devices. The apparatus in fig. 10 is shown with the use of a substrate 13 which comprises not shown active electronic circuits and an interface 15 and also forms the I/O interface 12 for the whole apparatus. The use of a substrate 13 of this kind in the apparatus according to the present invention is however no condition, and the stacked configuration of the thin-film devices<br><br>
1 may just as well be provided on a passive carrier substrate only, for instance formed of a foil-like material or a rigid material such as silicon.<br>
The embodiment in fig. 10 has features similar to corresponding embodiments as shown in the above-mentioned international patent application PCT/NO98/00185. In this patent application there are in more detail disclosed matrix addressable memory means which will be suited for use in the apparatus according to the invention and there is also disclosed how circuits can be realized in stacked thin-film layers and with three-dimensional topology. This can for instance concern diodes, transistors, complementary transistor circuits and logic gates realized in thin-film technology, something which, however, shall not be discussed in more detail here. It is also to be understood that memories in the separate thin-film device can be configured as one or more of a number of memory types, viz. RAM, ROM, WORM, ERASABLE or REWRITEABLE or combinations of such memories- Also this is disclosed in detail in the above-mentioned patent application and shall hence not be further described here.<br>
Each thin-film device 1 in the apparatus according to the invention can be built on a proprietary separation layer 16 before the joining into a stacked configuration takes place. The separate sublayers in a thin-film device 1 can have a thickness well below 1 jam, for instance down to 0.1 |im, which implies that a thin-film device 1 provided on a carrier substrate or a substrate which well could correspond to the separation layer 16, together with this will constitute a component with a thickness of for instance 20 ^m and may in that case comprise more than 100 sublayers, something which will be sufficient to realize relatively complicated electronic circuits in thin-film technology and simultaneously allow that tens of separate memories 3' can be stacked in each memory area 3. With a memory cell size of l|-im^ can then for instance a single memory of 1 cm^ comprise 10^ memory ceils of this kind and consequently store at least 10^ bit. A thin-film device the size of a credit card size will for instance comprise 40 such separate memories and hence store 0.5 Gbyte. When then the apparatus which for instance can be implemented as a PCMCIA-like card with 3 mm thickness, can comprise 100 stacked thin-film devices, it will be seen that the apparatus can store 50 Gbyte within the conditions given by the form factor. Increased storage capacity can be obtained with better exploitation of the real estate of each thin-film device, that is increasing the dimensions of the memory areas 3, but<br><br>
also by a reduction in the size of the separate memory cell, as a size of at least down towards 0,25 )  x 0.25 p.m seems realistic. In that case the storage capacity straightforwardly could be increased to 800 Gbyte, and it will be seen that the apparatus according to the present invention thus realized might implement a mass storage device or a hard disk replacement which could be used in most of today's personal computers or workstations.<br>
Under the conditions which follows from a given data storage density, it would be seen that the total data storage density will be given by the form factor, the area and the thickness of the apparatus. Basically and practically scaling to a design storage capacity will take place by using a sufficient number of thin-film devices. Integrated in for instance a PCMCIA card type 3, the apparatus according to the invention could then replace a conventional hard disk memory in the card. Where a given standard does not place restrictions on the dimensions, the apparatus according to the invention could replace existing hard disk solutions in for instance personal computers and suitably scaled offer mass storage capacity in the Byte range.<br>
Finally it must be remarked that even though the apparatus according to the invention is realized in planar stacked configuration, it may also be thinkable that the stacked configuration has been formed with deviant geometries. As the thin films are made in a flexible material and if a substrate with active circuits and based on inorganic semiconductors is not used, but for instance only a flexible carrier substrate in a form of foil-like material, it is thinkable that the whole apparatus for instance may be rolled up into a cylinder or pipe like configuration if this was advantageous for the purpose. In any case it is evident that an apparatus according to the invention realized in flexible materials can be incorporated in other objects where the requirement for plainness or stiffness no longer is unavoidable and hence be used for implementing applications in completely different circumstances than those which are regarded to fall within the scope of conventional computer technology.<br><br><br><br><br>
