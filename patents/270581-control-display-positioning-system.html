				<td>CONTROL DISPLAY POSITIONING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD<br>
The present invention pertains to positioning systems for control displays; more<br>
particularly, the present invention pertains to a control display positioning system used<br>
with medical/surgical equipment.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Prior art medical/surgical systems such as ophthalmic surgical systems with<br>
control displays provide limited access to the control display, touch screen, and graphical<br>
user interface (GUI). In some medical/surgical systems, the control display is<br>
permanently affixed to the front panel of the machine so that it cannot be moved. In other<br>
medical/surgical systems, the control display is mounted on a yoke-type device so that the<br>
control display can both spin from side to side about a vertical axis and also tilt about a<br>
horizontal axis. However, since the display is still centered on and mounted to the<br>
medical/surgical system, the health care professional is still restricted to accessing the<br>
control display from a position directly in front of the machine.<br>
Restricting the control display to a position directly in front of a medical/surgical<br>
system is a problem in a medical/surgical setup where trays of surgical tools and devices<br>
must often be placed directly in front of the system. In this configuration, a health<br>
professional must reach over the surgical tools and devices to gain access to the control<br>
display. Such positioning of the control display risks compromising the sterile field near<br>
the machine and over the surgical tools and devices.<br>
Another situation that presents difficulty is accessing the GUI when the patient is<br>
positioned between the medical/surgical system and the user. In this situation, the user<br>
must reach over the patient to access the GUI.<br>
Yet another problem is accommodating the body position of the health care<br>
professional using the medical/surgical system. In some procedures the health caTe<br><br>
professional is more comfortable working from a sitting position. In other procedures the<br>
heath care professional is more comfortable working from a standing position. Whether<br>
seated or standing, the height of the health care professional is also a major concern. This<br>
is because a health care professional can misread the screen because the screen is not<br>
properly positioned to provide a clear line of sight. Misreading the screen could result in<br>
an improper and possibly unsafe step in a surgical procedure. Accordingly, the proper<br>
placement of a control display with respect to the eyes of a health care professional to<br>
avoid glare from the screen, reflections from room lighting, or distortions of the images<br>
appearing on the control display is essential.<br>
It has also been found that the pivoting of prior art control display positioning<br>
systems into different orientations causes twisting of the cables housed within the control<br>
display positioning system. This twisting of the cables places a mechanical stress on the<br>
cables. This mechanical stress will eventually cause the cables to break. In some prior<br>
art systems the cables leading to a control display are wrapped into tight coils. In other<br>
prior art systems, movement of the cables is restricted at each cable end. This restricting<br>
of the movement of the cables at each end is done so that the mechanical stress caused by<br>
movement of the cable on each axis could be reduced axis by axis.<br>
The problem with the axis by axis restriction on cable movement is that the cables<br>
must be quite long because the length of the cable needed to handle the rotation in each<br>
axis is additive. The increased cable length is required to be stored in a relatively large<br>
coil. The need to store a relatively large coil of cable increases the overall size of the<br>
control display positioning system. When several cable movement axes are used in<br>
series, the length of the cable necessitates a significant increase in the size of the control<br>
display positioning system. It has also been found that using coiled cables and restricting<br>
movement of the cable ends is not an acceptable solution when multiple cables are used.<br>
Further, it has also been found that it is advantageous to separate video signal<br><br>
transmission cables from other cables to reduce the amount of noise added to the video<br>
signal.<br>
Another problem with prior art control display positioning systems is that the<br>
spring force, used to push friction generation surfaces together, is typically created by the<br>
compression of a series of wave washers. Because individual wave washers provide a<br>
relatively low level of force when compressed, several wave washers must be used in<br>
series to generate the amount of force needed to press on the friction generation surfaces.<br>
Wave washers also are characterized by a linear deflection to force curve (spring rates).<br>
As a result, variations in the deflection of the wave washers caused by a variation in the<br>
dimensions of the wave washers and their mating parts cause a large variation in spring<br>
force. This large variation in spring force, in turn, results in a large variation in frictional<br>
force.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a control display positioning<br>
system that is usable with a piece of medical/surgical equipment that: a) adjusts the<br>
position of the control to display to where it can be best seen by a health care<br>
professional; b) reduces the mechanical stress on the electrical cables providing electrical<br>
signals to the control display; c) provides a wide range of motion for the control display,<br>
and d) retains its position when manually repositioned.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The control display positioning system of the present invention permits adjusting<br>
the position of the control display to a wide variety of positions where it can best be seen<br>
by a health care professional; reduces the mechanical stress on the cables providing<br>
electrical signals to the control display and retains its position when manually<br>
repositioned.<br>
The disclosed control display positioning system features three hinges — each<br>
having a substantially vertical axis to provide rotational movement in a substantially<br><br>
horizontal plane. The first or base vertical hinge is mounted to a stationary portion of a<br>
piece of medical/surgical equipment. Extending outwardly from the proximal end of the<br>
base vertical hinge is a first arm. At the opposite or distal end of the first arm is located<br>
the second or elbow vertical hinge. Extending outwardly from the proximal end of the<br>
elbow vertical hinge is a second arm. At the distal end of the second arm is located a<br>
third or display vertical hinge. Connecting the display vertical hinge to the control<br>
display is a control display mounting or horizontal hinge to move the control display with<br>
respect to a substantially vertical plane. The horizontal hinge is mounted to the back of<br>
the control display.<br>
Within each vertical hinge is a substantially cylindrical passage. The cable bundle<br>
which provides electrical signals to the control display passes through this substantially<br>
cylindrical passage.<br>
Surrounding the substantially cylindrical passage within each vertical hinge is a<br>
friction mechanism for holding each vertical hinge in a selected position. The friction<br>
mechanism for holding each vertical hinge in a selected position includes a stack of<br>
washers. Friction forces are created by the contact between a friction washer and a steel<br>
washer. The force pushing the friction washer and the steel washer together is provided<br>
by a stack of one or more Belleville washers.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The disclosed control display positioning system 10 as shown in Figure 1 is used<br>
to support and position a control display 90 for a medical/surgical system 100 such as an<br>
ophthalmic surgical system. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the<br>
disclosed system 10 may also be used with other types of medical/surgical equipment.<br>
An important feature of the disclosed system 10 is that the cables 110 which<br>
deliver electrical energy and signals to the electronic components housed within the<br>
control display 90 are contained within the control display positioning system 10.<br>
Another feature of the disclosed control display positioning system 10 is that the<br>
frictional force within the hinges 20, 30, 50, 70 keeps Hie control display 90 at any<br>
selected position. The health care professional repositions the control display 90 simply<br>
by applying sufficient force to overcome the frictional force within the hinges 20, 30, 50,<br>
70. The result is that the disclosed control display positioning system 10 enables the<br>
control display 90 to be placed and remain in any position within a semi-circular area<br>
about the front or either side of the medical/surgical system 100.<br>
The control display 90 includes a graphical user interface (GUI) 91 having a touch<br>
panel or touch screen 92. It is the touch panel 92 which acts as the primary user input<br>
device for the system 100. The 4 axis arm movement of the disclosed control display<br>
positioning system 10 allows the control display 90 to be located in positions ranging<br>
from the center of the machine, to over the patient, to a position extended out in front of<br>
or to the sides of the piece of medical/surgical equipment. This increased range of motion<br><br>
facilitates access to the display by nurses who may be acting in several different<br>
operational roles during a medical/surgical procedure.<br>
The disclosed control display positioning system 10 includes 3 vertical spin axes<br>
Vi, V2, V3 through each hinge 30, 50, 70 and one horizontal tilt axis Hi, through the<br>
remaining hinge 20. The 3 vertical spin axes Vi, V2, and V3 allow the disclosed control<br>
display positioning system 10 to move the control display 90 to any position in a<br>
horizontal plane parallel to the floor within its range of motion. The horizontal tilt axis<br>
Hi provided by the hinge 20 allows the viewing angle of the display 90 to be adjusted by<br>
+ 20° with respect to a vertical plane to accommodate users of different heights.<br>
Both the vertically oriented hinges 30, 50, 70 and the horizontally oriented hinge<br>
20 have friction generating mechanisms as shown generally in Figures 2A and 2B,<br>
respectively, to create drag and allow each arm 40 and 60 to remain in position once<br>
placed there. In the vertical axes Vi, V2, V3, friction is created by pressing a stainless steel<br>
washer 102 against a plastic friction washer 104 as shown in Figure 2A. Belleville<br>
washers 106 that have a non-linear spring constant are used to create the load on washer<br>
102. The Belleville washers 106 reduce the fluctuation in frictional load.<br>
It has been found that more consistent factional force is achieved by using<br>
Belleville washers 106 with nonlinear spring rates. The Belleville washers 106 selected<br>
for use in the disclosed invention are specifically designed so that the deflection is in a<br>
very flat section of their force curve. The result is that variations in the deflection caused<br>
by stacked up tolerance variations result in very small changes in the normal force applied<br>
to the friction washer 104.<br>
Included within each vertical hinge assembly is an inner race spanner nut 11, an<br>
outer race spanner nut 13 and a ball bearing 15. While a ball bearing 15 has been used in<br>
the preferred embodiment, those of ordinary skill in this will understand that other types<br>
of bearings may be used without departing from the scope of the invention. At the<br><br>
bottom of each vertical hinge assembly is a rotation limitation ring 16. One or more caps<br>
or covers 17 may be included to keep dirt and debris out of the hinge assembly. Hinge<br>
assemblies 30, 50 and 70 are each contained within a housing 18 that is rotationally<br>
coupled to outer race spanner nut 13. Hinge assemblies 30, 50 and 70 each have a hinge<br>
shaft 19 that is rotationally coupled to inner race spanner nut 11. The rotation of hinges<br>
30 and 70 is limited to 180°; while the rotation of hinge 50 is a full 360°.<br>
The display vertical hinge assembly 70 is attached to the distal end 62 of the first<br>
arm 60. At the opposite end 64 of the first arm 60 is located the elbow vertical hinge<br>
assembly 50. The elbow vertical hinge assembly 50 provides a connection between the<br>
end 64 of the first arm 60 and the distal end 42 of the second arm 40. At the opposite end<br>
44 of the second arm 40 is located the base vertical hinge assembly 30. The base vertical<br>
hinge assembly 30 is connected to a stationary portion of medical/surgical system 100.<br>
There is sufficient space within each hinge assembly 30, 50, 70 so that several<br>
cables may be routed through the center bore 12 of the hinges. These cables may include<br>
an LVDS Signal Cable, an interface data cable, and a cable grouping strap. By allowing<br>
the cables to pass in an unrestricted manner through the center bore 12 of the hinge<br>
assemblies 30, 50, 70 at all 3 spin axes, mechanical stress in the cables and the resulting<br>
cable failure is reduced.<br>
Cable length and cable stress is further reduced by running the cable through an<br>
open space 99 running the length of each arm 40,60 as shown in Figure 3. This reduction<br>
of cable stress occurs for two reasons. First, by allowing the path for cable travel to be<br>
unrestricted between vertical axes, the twisting morion of one axis can cancel out the<br>
opposing twisting motion of a neighboring axis. Additionally, leaving the path 99 for<br>
cable travel unrestricted throughout the entire length of each arm 40, 60 allows for a<br>
greater cable length. This greater cable length allows for any given annular deflection to<br>
be distributed over a longer section of cable thus reducing any mechanical stress<br><br>
concentration in the cable. If the cable were strain-relieved at either end of each axis as in<br>
prior art systems, the angular deflection would to be concentrated over only a couple of<br>
inches of cable. It has been found that by strain-relieving the cable at the beginning and<br>
at the end of the series of axes, the length that the angular deflection may be distributed<br>
over is increased to over 12 inches.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, there are two vertical bars 24 on which the control display<br>
90 is mounted. Bars 24 are connected to the control display mounting or horizontal hinge<br>
assembly 20, which provides tilting of the control display 90 about a substantially<br>
horizontal axis. Horizontal hinge assembly 20 is connected to display vertical hinge<br>
assembly 70.<br>
By comparing Figure 3 to Figure 2B, it may be seen that shaft 22 passes through<br>
holes 21 in each vertical bar 24. Each end of the shaft 22 receives a screw 23 within an<br>
internally threaded portion 25. Horizontal hinge assembly 20 further includes a stainless<br>
steel shim washer 112, a plastic friction washer 114, and a set of Belleville washers 116.<br>
Tightening of the screw 23 compresses Belleville washers 116 against bar 24 and friction<br>
washer 114 to provide the necessary frictional force to maintain the tilt of the control<br>
display 90 about the horizontal axis Hi. Similar to Belleville washers 106 in hinge<br>
assemblies 30, 50, and 70, Belleville washers 116 have a non-linear spring constant that<br>
reduce the fluctuation in frictional load.<br>
