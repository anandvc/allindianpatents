				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a machine useful for cutting fruits and vegetables. The machine of the present invention is particularly useful for cutting of lemon and such similar fruits. The cut pieces obtained using the machine of the present invention are of uniform dimension, size and are obtained in a continuous manner. The cut fruits and vegetables can be used in pickle preparation and other similar fruit processing industry.<br>
Pickle is popular in India and is considered as an important ingredient of the daily meal. Different types of pickles are produced in the country by different industries in various brands. Lemon, mango, tamarind, tomato are the common types of fruits used in preparing pickles in the country. Presently pickles are produced at cottage industry level, small scale level as well as in large scale by very few industry. Some of the main problems in producing them in cottage scale, small scale, large scale is the tedious operation of cutting the large quantities of fruits to the required shape and size continuously, particularly lemon.<br>
Attempt to produce continuous compact machines for cutting of lemon and other similar fruits, is the first of its kind. The pickle manufacturers are deprived of a suitable machine for lemon cutting and depend on the skill of the operators. Many a times the operators run the risk of cutting their fingers as well. In case a device is made available for continuous cutting of fruits and vegetables, such as lemon, which is one of the ingredients of pickles, it would reduce accidents, labor and drudgery on the part of laborers, help in hygienic operations, and enhance uniformity in quality and quantities.<br>
Traditionally, fruits and vegetables are cut using a sharp knife, manually. Most of the production centers are cottage and tiny industries, where processing is done manually and there is a scope for accident, non-uniformity in size, cut shape, geometry and unhygienic handling of the fruits. The cutting of fruits and vegetables is to be done carefully in any industry, especially the pickle processing industry.<br>
In order to overcome these difficulties, if a cost effective machine for cutting of fruits and vegetables is made available, it would mechanize large-scale production of different types of pickles by small and cottage scale manufacturers hygienically.<br><br>
Hitherto the process of cutting of fruits and vegetables is based on manual cutting. The operator uses a stainless steel knife for cutting the lemon in to four pieces. The fruit or vegetable is spread on the cutting table and the operator picks one at a time and cuts them in to four pieces. The knife and the table are to be kept clean during the process of cutting. The cut product is transferred in to a stainless steel tray or a vessel for further processing.<br>
The drawbacks of manual cutting are:<br>
&gt;	There is a variation in the size of the cut pieces.<br>
&gt;	Manual cutting will lead to non-uniform product sizes.<br>
&gt;	The operators cut their fingers, leading to unhygiene.<br>
&gt;	The table and the knife are prone for microbial contamination.<br>
&gt;	The process is labor intensive and human drudgery is very high.<br>
&gt;	The final geometry of the product would depend on the skill of the labor.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a continuous circular cutting machine for cutting of fruits and vegetables.<br>
Another object is to provide hygienic conditions through mechanized operation. Still another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery. Yet another object is to increase productivity.<br>
Still another object is to provide a machine capable of cutting fruits and vegetables of different sizes.<br>
The machine of the present invention overcomes most of the drawbacks of manual cutting of fruits and vegetables.<br>

Example<br>
The washed lernon is transferred in to the tray of the cutting machine. A fruit or vegetable such as lemon flows in to the pockets of the locating rollers due to the gradient of the inlet chute. The locating roller carry/move the lemon against the stationery knife provided between the first set of locating rollers. The lemon is cut in to two and is fed in to the second set of rollers by the chute provided between the locating<br><br>
rollers. The second set of locating rollers again move the cut lemon against the knife, kept between the second set of locating roller. An outlet chute will discharge the cut lemon in to the tray/vessel. A geared motor drives the first set of locating rollers and a set of sprocket and chain transfer the motion from the first set of locating rollers to the second set. The speed of the geared motor can be varied by the help of the AC drive/inverter to fine-tune the process of cutting of the lemon. Thus, the lemon is cut into several fine pieces.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
&gt;	The lemon can be automatically cut to the required segments/pieces.<br>
&gt;	Uniformity in cut size can be controlled easily.<br>
&gt;	The device is versatile and can efficiently handle different sizes of lemon and other<br>
fruits with out grading.<br>
&gt;	Operation and maintenance is easy and cost effective too.<br>
&gt;	The complete operation of cutting lemon and other fruits is done hygienically.<br>
Based on stationery cutter and a rotating locating rollers concept, a machine for cutting of fruits and vegetables, untouched by hand is proposed for the first time according to this invention. As an important machine, different varieties and sizes of fruits and vegetables can be cut by using this machine.<br><br><br>
