				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.        Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a secondary vacuum source for use in conjunction with<br>
an endoscopic instrument. More particularly, the invention relates a surgical suturing<br>
apparatus including a secondary vacuum source.<br>
2.        Description of the Prior Art<br>
Endoscopic procedures have been rapidly developing over the past decade.<br>
These procedures often allow for the performance of surgical procedures with<br>
minimal trauma when compared to prior techniques requiring a large external opening<br>
to expose the internal organ or tissue requiring repair.<br>
In addition to the many areas in which endoscopic procedures have found use,<br>
endoscopic procedures have been developed for surgical procedures addressing<br>
morbid obesity. Morbid obesity is a serious medical condition. In fact, morbid<br>
obesity has become highly pervasive in the United States, as well as other countries,<br>
and the trend appears to be heading in a negative direction. Complications associated<br>
with morbid obesity include hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke,<br>
congestive heart failure, multiple orthopedic problems and pulmonary insufficiency<br>
with markedly decreased life expectancy. With this in mind, and as those skilled in the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
1<br><br>
art will certainly appreciate, the monetary and physical costs associated with morbid<br>
obesity are substantial. In fact, it is estimated the costs relating to obesity are in<br>
excess of 100 billion dollars in the United States alone.<br>
A variety of surgical procedures have been developed to treat obesity. One<br>
procedure is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This operation is highly complex<br>
and is commonly utilized to treat people exhibiting morbid obesity. Around 35,000<br>
procedures are performed annually in the United States alone. Other forms of<br>
bariatric surgery include Fobi pouch, bilio-pancreatic diversion, and gastroplasty or<br>
"stomach stapling". In addition, implantable devices are known which limit the<br>
passage of food through the stomach and affect satiety.<br>
RYGB involves movement of the jejunum to a high position using a Roux-en-<br>
Y loop. The stomach is completely divided into two unequal portions (a smaller<br>
upper portion and a larger lower gastric pouch) using an automatic stapling device.<br>
The upper pouch typically measures less than about 1 ounce (or 20 cc), while the<br>
larger lower pouch remains generally intact and continues to secret stomach juices<br>
flowing through the intestinal track.<br>
A segment of the small intestine is then brought from the lower abdomen and<br>
joined with the upper pouch to form an anastomosis created through a half-inch<br>
opening, also called the stoma. This segment of the small intestine is called the "Roux<br>
END5789USNP<br>
2<br><br>
loop" Roux limb and carries the food from the upper pouch to the remainder of the<br>
intestines, where the food is digested. The remaining lower pouch and the attached<br>
segment of duodenum are then reconnected to form another anastomotic connection<br>
to the Roux loop limb at a location approximately 50 to 150 cm from the stoma,<br>
typically using a stapling instrument. It is at this connection that the digestive juices<br>
from the bypass stomach, pancreas, and liver, enter the jejunum and ileum to aide in<br>
the digestion of food. Due to the small size of the upper pouch, patients are forced<br>
to eat at a slower rate and are satiated much more quickly. This results in a reduction<br>
in caloric intake.<br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the conventional RYGB<br>
procedure requires a great deal of operative time. Because of the degree of<br>
invasiveness, post-operative recovery time can be quite lengthy and painful. In view<br>
of the highly invasive nature relating to the current RYGB procedure, other less<br>
invasive procedures have been developed. With this mind other procedures for<br>
reducing the size of the stomach have been developed. The most common form of<br>
gastric reduction surgery involves the application of vertical staples along the stomach<br>
to create an appropriate pouch. This procedure is commonly performed<br>
laparoscopically and as such requires substantial preoperative, operative, postoperative<br>
resources.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
3<br><br>
As endoscopic devices and procedures have developed, surgeons have begun to<br>
employ endoscopic techniques to gastric procedures such as those discussed above in<br>
an effort to minimize trauma and reduce the time required for procedures and<br>
recovery. With the foregoing in mind, procedures and apparatuses that allow for the<br>
performance of gastric reduction surgery in a time efficient and patient friendly<br>
manner are needed.<br>
One area that has not been adequately addressed is the need for the application<br>
of sutures as these gastric, and other endoscopic, procedures are being performed.<br>
The present invention provides an endoscopic suturing device adapted for the<br>
continuous application of sutures.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. It<br>
should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely<br>
exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, the<br>
details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as the basis for<br>
the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use<br>
the invention.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 to 10, an endoscopic suturing apparatus 10 for the<br>
continuous application of a suture 12 is disclosed. The term "suture" as used<br>
throughout the body of the present application is intended to refer to a variety of<br>
flexible securing filaments whether they be made of natural filament, synthetic or<br>
polymeric filaments, or metallic wire filaments.<br>
Although the present suturing apparatus is particularly adapted for use in<br>
performing endoscopic gastric reduction procedures, those skilled in the art will<br>
certainly appreciate the apparatus may be used for a wide variety of applications<br>
without departing from the spirit of the present invention. More particularly, the<br>
present suturing apparatus is shaped and dimensioned for insertion through a natural<br>
orifice of a patient, for example, transorally, and is, therefore, shaped and<br>
dimensioned for insertion through an orifice from approximately 3 mm to<br>
END5789USNP<br>
13<br><br>
approximately 24 mm in diameter. Although the present suturing apparatus is<br>
particularly adapted for insertion through a patient's natural orifice, the present<br>
suturing apparatus may be shaped and dimensioned for laparoscopic insertion<br>
through a trocar, and is, therefore, shaped and dimensioned for insertion through an<br>
orifice from approximately 3 mm to approximately 18 mm in diameter.<br>
The suturing apparatus 10 includes a suturing body 14 shaped and dimensioned<br>
for attachment to the distal end 16 of a commercially available endoscope, or other<br>
supporting structure, 18 in a manner permitting actuation thereof and the creation of<br>
a vacuum. With this in mind, the suturing body 14 is secured to the endoscope 18<br>
using known attachment structures appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The suturing body 14 is composed of a first housing member 20 and a second<br>
housing member 22 secured together to create a suture housing 24 in which the<br>
functional components of the present apparatus 10 are housed for movement in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The suture housing 24 includes an inner first<br>
track 26 in which a needle 28 is positioned for movement about a predetermined<br>
continuous circular path under the control of a drive assembly 30.<br>
Although the present suturing apparatus is disclosed in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment as providing for the translation of the needle about a<br>
continuous circular path, it is contemplated many of the concepts underlying the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
14<br><br>
present invention may be applied in systems wherein the needle is merely moved<br>
along an arcuate path, and not necessarily along a continuous circular path.<br>
The drive assembly 30 is supported within second and third tracks 32, 34<br>
positioned about the inner first track 26. The drive assembly 30 applies axial motion<br>
to cause movement of the needle 28 about its continuous circular path. The drive<br>
assembly 30 is generally composed of a friction plate 36 statically mounted along the<br>
second track 32 and a friction camming member 38 that moves along the second<br>
track 32 while a pin 40 moves along the outer third track 34. A drive cable 42 is<br>
coupled to the pin 40 for controlling actuation thereof in the manner described below<br>
in greater detail. The drive cable 42 is actuated for movement of the drive assembly<br>
30 by a handle (for example, as shown in Figures 47 to 51). Although a preferred<br>
handle is disclosed below, it is contemplated a variety of handle structures may be<br>
utilized in the actuation of the drive cable without departing from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
For reasons that will become apparent based upon the operation of the present<br>
suture apparatus 10 as described below in greater detail, the suturing body 14 is<br>
substantially C-shaped with a central opening 44 in which tissue is positioned during<br>
suturing. The C-shape of the suturing body 14 allows the needle 28 to move about a<br>
circular path during operation thereof and pass through tissue positioned with the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
15<br><br>
central opening.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment,<br>
the present endoscopic suturing apparatus 10 is attached to a commercially available<br>
endoscope 18 by way of a clamp 17. As briefly mentioned above, and as discussed<br>
below in greater detail, the suturing apparatus 10 may be secured to the endoscope 18<br>
in a variety of ways without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The<br>
suturing apparatus 10 is oriented in a way that allows the user to maintain visibility of<br>
the needle 28 and operative field, as well as create a small cross section to aid in<br>
transoral insertion (when the suturing apparatus 10 is used in gastric surgical<br>
procedures).<br>
A vacuum chamber 46 surrounds and/or otherwise contains the suturing body<br>
14 of the present suture apparatus 10. This defines a cavity 48 in which the suturing<br>
body 14 sits. The vacuum chamber 46 is coupled to the vacuum line 50, which is<br>
coupled in tandem to the endoscope 18, but not in the working channel of the<br>
endoscope 18, such that a vacuum is created within the cavity 48 defined by the<br>
vacuum chamber 46, as well as the central opening 44 of the suturing body 14. In this<br>
way, the application of the vacuum draws adjacent tissue into the central opening 44<br>
of the suturing body 14.<br>
As briefly mentioned above, the present suturing apparatus 10 is provided with<br>
END5789USNP<br>
16<br><br>
a vacuum chamber 46 designed to enhance one's ability to draw tissue into a position<br>
for suturing. The vacuum chamber 46 is shaped and dimensioned to facilitate pulling<br>
the tissue wall into the vacuum chamber 46, and particularly, the central opening 44 of<br>
the suturing body 14, under the control of the applied vacuum. Once drawn within<br>
the vacuum chamber 46 and the central opening 44, the tissue is held therein as the<br>
needle 28 is passed therethrough while the suturing body 14 throws stitches. The<br>
required vacuum chamber 46 size is based upon the thickness of the tissue being<br>
sutured. The vacuum necessary to pull the desired tissue thickness is proportionate to<br>
both the thickness of the tissue and the size of the vacuum chamber 46.<br>
As a result, the present vacuum chamber 46 attempts to increase the size<br>
thereof to minimize the required vacuum for accomplishing the task, without making<br>
the vacuum chamber 46 too large for passage into the stomach. The ability of the<br>
present vacuum chamber 46 to achieve desired suction with vacuum pressure<br>
provided at a hospital or other medical facility is especially important considering the<br>
magnitude of vacuum sources available at different hospitals, as well as within<br>
different surgical suites, varies greatly.<br>
With this in mind, and in accordance with preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention as shown in Figures 11 and 12, (where similar reference numerals<br>
are used for similar parts) the vacuum chamber 146 is constructed from a resilient<br>
END5789USNP<br>
17<br><br>
elastomer. It is cup-like in its configuration and generally includes an inner wall 170<br>
and an outer wall 172. The inner wall 170 of the vacuum chamber 146 is preferably<br>
provided with projections, for example, ribs and/or hooks, 174 (as shown in Figure<br>
12) to further improve the ability of the vacuum chamber 146 to retain tissue drawn<br>
thereon under suction. These projections 174 provide grabbing surfaces for the tissue<br>
to be pinned against when the vacuum is applied to the vacuum chamber 146. The<br>
projections 174 also increase the holding power of the vacuum thereby minimizing<br>
the amount of vacuum needed.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the vacuum chamber 146 is<br>
composed of first and second vacuum chamber members 176, 178 secured to<br>
opposite sides of the suturing body 114 in a manner containing, or otherwise<br>
surrounding, the functional components of the suturing body 114. The first and<br>
second chamber members 176, 178 are mirror images of each other and define a<br>
space surrounding the suturing body 114 for the creation of a vacuum. In accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment, the first and second vacuum chamber members 176,<br>
178 define a cup-like space in which the suturing body 114 is positioned.<br>
Each of the first and second vacuum chamber members 176, 178 includes a<br>
semicircular upper edge 184 and a concave lower portion 186. As such, when the first<br>
and second vacuum chamber members 176, 178 are secured along opposite sides of<br>
END5789USNP<br>
18<br><br>
the suturing body 114, the cup-like space is defined about: the suturing body 114. The<br>
cup-like space provides a confined space in which the suction provided by the<br>
vacuum is constrained so as to securely and efficiently draw tissue into the central<br>
opening 144 of the suturing body 114.<br>
The first and second vacuum chamber members 176, 178 of the vacuum<br>
chamber 146 are manufactured from an elastomer, for example, urethane, adiprene or<br>
santoprene. The vacuum chamber 146 is designed to permit expansion and<br>
contraction thereof. The provision of an expandable vacuum chamber 146 maximizes<br>
chamber size to increase tissue inclusion during vacuum application, while permitting<br>
reduced vacuum chamber 146 size during insertion of the suturing apparatus 110.<br>
More particularly, the ability of the vacuum chamber 146 to expand and contract<br>
facilitates trans-oral passage of the suturing apparatus 110 while similarly optimizing<br>
vacuum chamber 146 size during tissue suction.<br>
As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the need for trans-oral passage of the<br>
suturing apparatus 110 defines an ultimate limit on the dimensions of the suturing<br>
apparatus 110 and, therefore, the vacuum chamber 146 that can be introduced to<br>
capture tissue in accordance with the present invention. The larger the vacuum<br>
chamber 146, the larger the "bite" of tissue that can be captured in one throw of the<br>
suturing apparatus 1.10. With this in mind, and as discussed above, the vacuum<br>
END5789USNP<br>
19<br><br>
chamber 146 is made out of an elastomer allowing it to be collapsed during insertion<br>
and then "spring" back to its original shape after it is fully inserted.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to Figures 13<br>
and 14, expansion of the vacuum chamber 246 is further facilitated by the provision<br>
of living hinges 280 at predefined bending points of the cavity 248 defined by the<br>
vacuum chamber 246. This allows the vacuum chamber 246 to be constructed of a<br>
wider variety of materials, including non-elastic plastics, since the living hinges 280<br>
permit the more rigid structures to "fold" rather than elastically bend. More<br>
particular, and with reference to the prior embodiment, the vacuum chamber 246 is<br>
composed of a first vacuum chamber member 276 and a second vacuum chamber<br>
member 278. The first and second vacuum chamber members 276, 278 are mirror<br>
images of each other, and each includes a semi-circular upper section 284 and a<br>
concave lower section 286. As a result, the first and second vacuum chamber<br>
members 276, 278 are coupled to opposite sides of the suturing body 214 to form the<br>
present vacuum chamber 246, which can similarly include the ribs and/or hooks<br>
discussed above with regard to the prior embodiment.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the first and second vacuum<br>
chamber members 276, 278 are constructed of a semi-rigid material and, therefore,<br>
respectively include living hinges 280 permitting expansion and contraction thereof.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
20<br><br>
The living hinges 280 are positioned at predefined bending points of the first and<br>
second vacuum chamber members 276, 278 in a manner optimizing folding thereof.<br>
The living hinges 280 permits controlled expansion and contraction of the vacuum<br>
chamber 246 as the first and second vacuum chamber members 276, 278 are moved<br>
relative to each other in accordance with the present invention. One is, therefore,<br>
able to pass a vacuum chamber 246 that is ultimately, when used, larger than the<br>
trans-oral space through which it is passed.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate it is would be desirable to make a<br>
vacuum chamber and central opening adapted to accommodate any type of tissue, any<br>
thickness of tissue and be able to allow the user to adjust the bite size (that is, the<br>
extent of tissue through which the suture is thrown). To this end, various<br>
embodiments for the adjustment of the effective vacuum chamber and central<br>
opening size have been developed and are disclosed herein. These embodiments also<br>
allow for longitudinal and lateral adjustment of the vacuum chamber, as well as depth<br>
adjustment of the central opening and vacuum chamber, to allow for use with<br>
different tissue thicknesses, different tissue types and variable tissue bites per suture<br>
throw. In this way the surgeon is allowed to readily adjust the effective vacuum<br>
chamber/central opening depth, width and/or length to allow for adjustment of the<br>
depth of the tissue bite, which controls the depth of the needle path through the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
21<br><br>
tissue (i.e., full thickness or partial thickness). The ability for adjustment also allows<br>
the same suturing apparatus to be used for multiple tissue types and thicknesses.<br>
While limiting the maximum amount of tissue that may be drawn into the vacuum<br>
chamber and central opening, the present techniques may also be applied to ensure<br>
that a predetermined and controlled amount of tissue is drawn into the vacuum<br>
chamber and the central opening.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, and with reference to Figures 89,<br>
90 and 91, adjustment is accomplished by the provision of adjusting screws 3970 in<br>
the base 3972 of the vacuum chamber 3946. The screws 3970 respectively allow for<br>
longitudinal or lateral adjustment of the vacuum chamber 3946 by adjusting a screw<br>
3970 in the base 3972 of the vacuum chamber 3946 that expands or contracts the<br>
vacuum chamber 3946 in a desired direction.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, and with reference to Figure 88 a<br>
wire 4070 is used to raise the effective base of the vacuum chamber 4046 and the<br>
central opening 4044 controlling the effective depth of the vacuum chamber 4046 and<br>
the central opening 4044. This wire 4070 is a buckled spacing wire that can be further<br>
buckled or allowed to straighten, effectively reducing the depth to which the tissue<br>
can enter the cavity defined by the central opening 4044 and the vacuum chamber<br>
4046. The straighter the spring wire 4070 is allowed to be, the higher the effective<br>
END5789USNP<br>
22<br><br>
bottom of the cavity is set. The spring wire 4070 thereby prevents deep entrance of<br>
tissue (that is, entrance beyond the barrier created by the spring wire 4070) into the<br>
central opening 4044. The slack in the wire 4070 is controlled via a screw member<br>
4072 found within the suturing body 4014 for actuation of the wire 4070.<br>
Referring to Figure 93, and in accordance with another embodiment, a cinching<br>
cable 4170 is used to adjust the effective length of the vacuum chamber 4148. In<br>
particular, a cinching cable 4170 is threaded about the outer perimeter of the vacuum<br>
chamber 4146, with the free ends 4172, 4174 thereof exiting at the proximal end of<br>
the vacuum chamber 4146. As such, the free ends 4172, 4174 may be tensioned to<br>
shorten the vacuum chamber 4146 length, and similarly released when it is desired to<br>
increase the length of the vacuum chamber 4146 by allowing the walls thereof to<br>
expand to their unbiased position.<br>
As mentioned above, the housing 24 contains the needle 28 used in the<br>
application of a suture 12 to the tissue drawn within the central opening 44. The<br>
suture 12 is secured to the proximal end, that is, the blunt end, of the needle 28 and is<br>
drawn through the tissue as the needle 28 is actuated in accordance with the present<br>
invention as described herein. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the<br>
needle 28 is curved to rotate about a predetermined continuous circular path and<br>
extends along an arc of 240 degrees creating an opening of 120 degrees. However,<br>
END5789USNP<br>
23<br><br>
those skilled in the art will appreciate the opening may be varied; for example, it has<br>
been contemplated to use a needle offering an opening of 140 degrees.<br>
The needle 28 includes an interior surface 52 along the inner surface of the arc<br>
defined by the needle 28 and an exterior surface 54 along the outer surface of the arc<br>
defined by the needle 28. A series of notches 56 are cut into the exterior surface 54 of<br>
the needle 28. As will be appreciated based upon the following description, the<br>
notches 56 are shaped and dimensioned for use by the drive assembly 30 in grabbing,<br>
driving and releasing the needle 28. Although notches along the exterior surface of<br>
the needle are disclosed for use in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, it is contemplated the needle may be formed without notches such<br>
that the drive assembly merely grips the substantially smooth exterior surface of the<br>
needle to drive it forward.<br>
Operation of the drive assembly 30 and movement of the needle 28 is<br>
described with reference to Figures 3 to 10, wherein one half of the housing 24 is<br>
removed exposing internal components of the present suture apparatus 10. The drive<br>
cable 42 (shown in Figure 3) is rigidly attached to the pin 40. As is described below in<br>
greater detail, the drive cable 42, pin 40 and friction camming member 38 are<br>
extended and retracted to engage and disengage the needle 28 for movement thereof<br>
about its circular path. The drive cable 42 is flexible enough to curve in the housing<br>
END5789USNP<br>
24<br><br>
24 and flex along with the endoscope 18, but is rigid enough to be compressed to<br>
drive the friction camming member 38 into its initial drive stage (see Figure 4).<br>
The friction camming member 38 is composed of an arcuate engagement<br>
member 58 and a camming member 60 working in conjunction with the pin 40 to<br>
control the position of the engagement member 58 for selective engagement with the<br>
needle 28. The engagement member 58 is constructed with internal notches 62<br>
shaped and dimensioned for engaging the needle 28 to drive it in a clockwise<br>
direction, but permit free movement thereof as the friction camming member 38, that<br>
is, both the engagement member 58 and the camming member 60, is moved in a<br>
counter-clockwise direction toward the initial drive stage.<br>
The engagement member 58 of the friction camming member 38 is designed to<br>
translate in the housing 24 both radially towards and away from the needle 28, as well<br>
as translate arcuately clockwise and counterclockwise about the arc defined by the<br>
housing 24. This is achieved through the camming action offered by the interaction<br>
between the camming member 60, the pin 40 and the engagement member 58. The<br>
camming member 60 is rigidly coupled to the engagement member 58 such that the<br>
engagement member 58 is moved into and out of engagement with the needle 28 as<br>
the radial position of the camming member 60 is altered based upon its interaction<br>
with the pin 40. As discussed below in accordance with an alternate embodiment, it is<br>
END5789USNP<br>
25<br><br>
contemplated that a spring element may be employed to force the friction camming<br>
member 38 against the needle 28.<br>
More particularly, as the drive cable 42 is compressed (that is, the drive cable 42<br>
is pushed distally away from the operation of the suturing apparatus 10) to move the<br>
friction camming member 38 in a counter-clockwise direction, the pin 40 slides within<br>
a slot 64 formed in the camming member 60 forcing the engagement member 58 and<br>
camming member 60 to move counterclockwise as well as outwardly from the needle<br>
28. The friction plate 36 aids in forcing the engagement member 58 outwardly from<br>
the needle 28 as the friction camming member 38 is moved in this counter-clockwise<br>
direction.<br>
With the friction camming member 38 in its initial drive position as shown in<br>
Figure 4, and as tension is applied to the drive cable 42 (that is, the drive cable 42 is<br>
pulled proximally toward the operation of the suturing apparatus 10) and ultimately<br>
the pin 40, the pin 40 engages the camming member 60 forcing friction camming<br>
member 38, and more particularly, the engagement member 58 to travel inwardly into<br>
contact with the exterior surface 54 of the needle 28 due to the camming action<br>
resulting from the interaction of the pin 40 and the slot 64 within the camming<br>
member 60 (see Figure 5). As tension is continually applied to the drive cable 42 the<br>
notches 62 formed along the inner surface of the engagement member 58 grab into<br>
END5789USNP<br>
26<br><br>
the notches 56 cut into the exterior surface 54 of the needle 28, causing the needle 28<br>
to rotate clockwise until pin 40 reaches the limit of track 34 and the procedure must<br>
start all over (see Figure 6).<br>
When the limit of the stroke is reached as shown in Figure 6, the operator<br>
compresses the drive cable 42 causing the engagement member 58 to disengage from<br>
the needle 28 by way of the cam feature resulting from the interaction of the pin 40<br>
within the slot 64 of the camming member 60 as the pin 40 slides within the slot 64<br>
causing the engagement member 58 and camming member 60 to move outwardly and<br>
in a counterclockwise direction (see Figure 7). The compression on the drive cable 42<br>
is continued until the friction camming member 38 moves counterclockwise reaching<br>
the opposite end of the housing 24 (see Figure 8). Tension is then applied to once<br>
again move the needle 28 in a clockwise direction and the procedure is repeated until<br>
the needle has traveled 360 degrees (see Figures 9 and 10).<br>
As briefly discussed above, the drive assembly 30 of the present invention is<br>
capable of driving the needle 28 about its circular path in a highly controlled and<br>
efficient manner. Referring to Figure 15, the functionality of the present drive<br>
assembly 330 is enhanced by the provision of the friction camming member 338,<br>
which drives the needle 328 when pulling the needle 328 along its path through<br>
frictional means. The contact surface of the frictional interface 358 of the friction<br>
END5789USNP<br>
27<br><br>
camming member 338 is manufactured to enhance its frictional relationship with the<br>
needle 328 so as to smoothly and reliably move the needle 328 in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
The interaction between the friction camming member 338 and the needle 328<br>
is enhanced by the provision of a leaf spring 370. The leaf spring 370 extends within<br>
the suture housing 324 of the suturing apparatus 310 and is oriented to contact the<br>
friction camming member 338 during actuation of the needle 328 for forcing the<br>
friction camming member 338 into contact with the needle 328. The leaf spring 370<br>
is a cantilever mounted spring member mounted proximally of the friction camming<br>
member 338. As the friction camming member 338 is forced distally, the leaf spring<br>
370 increases the engagement forces radially the farther the friction camming member<br>
338 is displaced. As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, a spring structure<br>
is disclosed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention and<br>
other spring structures could be employed without departing from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
in accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to Figure 16,<br>
the smooth friction camming member 338 discussed above may be replaced with a<br>
toothed friction camming member 438. In accordance with this embodiment, the<br>
contact surface of the factional interface 458 of the friction camming member 438 is<br>
END5789USNP<br>
28<br><br>
provided with teeth 472 shaped and dimensioned to engage similarly shaped teeth 474<br>
formed along the exterior surface of needle 428. In this way, the teeth 472 along the<br>
frictional interface 458 of the friction camming member 438 engage teeth 474 cut into<br>
the needle 428 and drag the needle 428 along its drive path when pulled. As with the<br>
prior embodiment, the interaction between the friction camming member 438 and the<br>
needle 428 is enhanced by the provision of a leaf spring 470. The leaf spring 470<br>
extends within the suture housing 424 of the suturing apparatus 410 and is oriented to<br>
contact the friction camming member 438 during actuation of the needle 428 for<br>
forcing the friction camming member 438 into contact with the needle 428.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to Figure 17,<br>
The motion of the friction camming member 538 (whether it be a smooth friction<br>
camming member 338 as shown in Figure 15 or a toothed friction camming member<br>
438 as shown in Figure 16) used in driving the needle 528 can also be achieved<br>
through the use of a sprocket gear 570 engaging with teeth 572 on the back side 574<br>
of the friction camming member 538 driving the needle 528 through the same<br>
motions the linear pull system created. Such a gearing arrangement provides for the<br>
translation of rotary motion along the drive cable 582, and about a first axis<br>
substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis of the suturing apparatus 510 extending<br>
through the suturing apparatus 510, into rotary motion of the needle 528 about an<br>
END5789USNP<br>
29<br><br>
arcuate path having a central axis substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the suturing apparatus 510. In accordance with this embodiment, the sprocket gear<br>
570 is rotated by a rotary cable drive system 576 linked to a rotary member in the<br>
handle (not shown) which would replace the linear pull system. In accordance with<br>
this embodiment, the rotary cable motion (rotating about the longitudinal axis of the<br>
device shaft) is converted to rotary motion (rotating perpendicular to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the device shaft) to drive the needle 528 directly along its circular path or to<br>
drive the toothed friction camming member 538 in its path.<br>
More particularly, the drive cable 582 is designed for rotation about an axis<br>
substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the apparatus 510. The distal end 584<br>
of the drive cable 582 is provide with spur gear 586 which is linked to a similar spur<br>
gear 588 mounted between the spur gear 586 at the distal end 584 of the drive cable<br>
582 and a geared contact surface 574 of the friction camming member 538. As a<br>
result, rotation of the drive cable 582 causes the spur gear 586 to rotate, which in<br>
turns translates into motion of the friction camming member 538. Movement of the<br>
friction camming member 538 then causes the needle 528 to move in a desired<br>
arcuate path. Since the friction camming member 538 engages and disengages the<br>
needle 528 in a manner similar to the embodiment described above, movement: of the<br>
needle 528 is achieved by alternately reversing the rotation of the rotary cable system.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
30<br><br>
Forward rotation cams the friction camming member 538 into engagement and drives<br>
the friction camming member 538 counter-clockwise in a manner driving the needle<br>
528. Reverse rotation of the drive cable 582 disengages the friction camming member<br>
538 from the needle 528 and rotates the friction camming member 538 clockwise<br>
resetting it for the next driving motion.<br>
Regardless of the friction camming member design, the drive mechanism<br>
employed in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention<br>
provides a rotary needle drive system for suture pass-through capable of multiple<br>
tissue pass-through during a single device insertion. As discussed above, in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, this is<br>
accomplished by a friction camming member that advances the needle by means of a<br>
toothed engagement or a factional coupling, and provides for needle advancement<br>
permitting variation in the size of both the needle and suture used in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Two anti-backup structures are disclosed with reference to Figures 18 and 19.<br>
These anti-backup structures control needle movement so the needle is only allowed<br>
to pass in one direction. This prevents the needle from backing out between<br>
actuating strokes of the fricton camming member as it moves between its end (or<br>
limit) of stroke position as shown in Figure 6 and its initial drive position as shown in<br>
END5789USNP<br>
31<br><br>
Figure 8. More particularly, the needle of the present suturing apparatus is designed<br>
to move in a predetermined first direction about an arcuate path, and movement in an<br>
opposite second direction is undesired. As such, the present anti-backup structures<br>
prevent movement of the needle in the second direction while permitting free<br>
movement of the needle in the first direction.<br>
More particularly, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment disclosed<br>
with reference to Figure 18, a frictional anti-backup device 670 is secured along the<br>
forward end of the needle 628 path for contact with the needle 628 in a manner<br>
preventing undesired back-up thereof. The frictional anti-backup device 670 is a lever<br>
arm 672 including a first end 674 and second end 676. The first end 674 of the lever<br>
arm 672 is pivotally secured to the suturing body 614 of the suturing apparatus 610.<br>
The second end 676 of lever arm 672 extends toward, and into contact with, the<br>
contact surface of the needle 628. The lever arm 672 is oriented such that when the<br>
needle 628 is moved in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 18, the lever<br>
arm 672 slides over the exterior surface of the needle 628 permitting the needle 628 to<br>
freely rotate.<br>
However, if the needle 628 attempts to rotate in a clockwise direction as<br>
viewed in Figure 18, the second end 676 of the lever arm 672 frictionally engages the<br>
exterior surface of the needle 628 in a manner stopping clockwise rotation thereof.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
32<br><br>
This is a result of the orientation of the lever arm 672 that creates a factional<br>
impediment to movement of the needle 628, for example, similar to a ratchet<br>
mechanism. With this in mind, the lever arm 672 is biased to maintain engagement<br>
with the exterior surface of the needle 628 whether the needle is rotated in a clockwise<br>
direction or a counter-clockwise direction.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment and with reference to Figure 19,<br>
the suturing body 714 is provided with an integral spring biased latch 770 shaped and<br>
dimensioned to fit within recesses 772 formed in the exterior surface of the needle<br>
728. With this in mind, the latch 770 and the recesses 772 are shaped and<br>
dimensioned to permit substantially free rotation of the needle 728 in one direction<br>
while preventing rotation of the needle 728 in the opposite direction.<br>
Since it is possible the needle may become jammed within the tissue during<br>
deployment, it sometimes becomes necessary to free the needle from the suturing<br>
apparatus for emergency extraction of both the suturing apparatus and the needle.<br>
With this in mind, and with reference to the various embodiments presented below,<br>
techniques have been developed for freeing the needle in the event: it becomes<br>
jammed and requires release. In general, the embodiments described below are<br>
different methods of separating or opening the suture housing of the suturing<br>
apparatus to release the needle and allow the suturing apparatus to be removed.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
33<br><br>
Release of the needle in this manner might necessitate subsequent removal of the<br>
needle from its jammed position, but will permit extraction of the remainder of the<br>
suturing apparatus as the suturing apparatus is no longer hung on the tissue based<br>
upon the release of the needle.<br>
In accordance with the various embodiments disclosed below, a surgical<br>
suturing apparatus includes a suture housing and a needle mounted within the suture<br>
housing for movement: about an arcuate path. The suturing apparatus also includes a<br>
drive assembly operably associated with the needle for controlling movement of the<br>
needle with a suture secured thereto about the arcuate path in a manner facilitating<br>
application of the suture to tissue. The suture housing has an open position and a<br>
closed position, and the needle can be removed from the suture housing when in the<br>
open position.<br>
The various embodiments provide a user a controlled opening mechanism that<br>
allows the suture housing to be selectively opened should the needle fail to be able to<br>
advance and the suturing apparatus needs to be extracted. As will be described below<br>
in greater detail, this is achieved by employing either a spring biased, hinged clamshell<br>
suturing body opening when a crushable coupling mechanism is actuated, a removable<br>
pin/cable mechanism that holds the two halves of the suturing body together or an<br>
END5789USNP<br>
34<br><br>
openable suture deployment system that can be re-closed for extraction from the<br>
body.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment, and with reference to Figures 20 to 22,<br>
and as discussed above in greater detail, the suturing body 814 is composed of a first<br>
housing member 820 and second housing member 822 making up the suture housing<br>
824. A cam pin set 870 locks the first housing member 820 and the second housing<br>
member 822 together, with, however, the ability to remove the cam pin set 870 from<br>
the second housing member 822 when it is desired to separate the first and second<br>
housing members 820, 822 for removal of a jammed needle 828.<br>
More particularly, the first and second housing members 820, 822 are hinged<br>
872 along one end thereof, and the cam pin set 870 is positioned in a manner<br>
opposite the hinge 872 so the first and second housing members 820, 822 are securely<br>
held together. However, when the cam pin set 870 is removed, or otherwise removed<br>
from its locking position with a second housing member 822, the first and second<br>
housing members 820, 822 are free to move apart pivoting about the hinge 872.<br>
Opening of the suturing housing 824 is further facilitated by the inclusion of a spring<br>
874 in the hinge 872 for encouraging opening of the suturing housing 824 upon<br>
removal of the cam pin set 870.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
35<br><br>
Actuation of the cam pin set 870 is achieved via the use of a release member<br>
876 that interacts to permit controlled locking and release of the cam pin set 870. in<br>
particular, the release member 876 includes a series of interference members 878<br>
which interact with the heads 880 of the cam pin set 870 to retain them within<br>
recesses 882 formed in the second housing member 822 (see Figure 21). When it is<br>
desired to separate the first and second housing members 820, 822, the release<br>
member 876 is shifted, for example, via a cable 884 extending for actuation by a user,<br>
to move the interference member 878 and allow the cam pin set 870 to move from<br>
within the second housing member 822 (see Figure 22).<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, and with reference to Figures 23 and<br>
24, a tear strip 970 is disclosed. As with the prior embodiments, the suturing body<br>
914 is composed of a first housing member 920 and second housing member 922<br>
making up the suture housing 924. The first and second housing members 920, 922<br>
are hinged 972 along one end thereof, with a spring 974 biasing the first and second<br>
housing members 920, 922 to an open orientation.<br>
The tear strip 970 is positioned through the centerline of the first and second<br>
housing members 920, 922. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the tear<br>
strip 970 is secured to the first and second housing members 920, 922 either through<br>
adhesive or other mechanical frangible, plastic coupling features. When pulled, the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
36<br><br>
teat" strip 970 "tears" the center out from between the first and second housing-<br>
members 920, 922 allowing the suturing apparatus 910 to fall open. The tear strip 970<br>
may be a straight adhesive or molded strip, or the tear strip 970 may include a<br>
camming feature (as discussed below) as part of the distal most end further spreading<br>
open the halves as it is removed.<br>
A further embodiment is disclosed with reference to Figures 25 and 26. This<br>
embodiment employs a pull cable 1070 to facilitate selective opening of the suturing<br>
body 1014 for release of a jammed needle therefrom. In accordance with this<br>
embodiment, the suturing body 1014 is composed of a first housing member 1020<br>
and second housing member 1022 making up a suture housing 1024. The first and<br>
second housing members 1020, 1022 are hinged 1072 along one end thereof (or are<br>
separate non-associated halves). The first and second housing members 1020, 1022<br>
are further provided with lacing loops 1074 along the open end thereof. The lacing<br>
loops 1074 are shaped and dimensioned to permit the placement of a pull cable 1070<br>
therethrough in a manner which holds the first: and second housing members 1020,<br>
1022 together.<br>
More particularly, the pull cable 1070 is laced through the lacing loops 1074<br>
alternately positioned on the first and second housing members 1020, 1022 much like<br>
the hinge of a door. As long as the pull cable 1070 is present around the perimeter of<br>
END5789USNP<br>
37<br><br>
the first and second housing- members 1020, 1022, the first and second housing<br>
members 1020, 1022 are held together and the needle 1028 is retained therein.<br>
However, when it is desirable to remove the needle 1028 or otherwise open the<br>
suturing body 1014 of the suturing apparatus 1010, the pull cable 1070 is pulled<br>
withdrawing it from the lacing loops 1074 and releasing the first and second housing-<br>
members 1020, 1022 from each other. With the first and second housing members<br>
1020, 1022 released, the spring biased hinge 1072 draws the first and second housing-<br>
members 1020, 1022 apart by pivoting them along the hinge 1072.<br>
A spreader plate 1170 embodiment is disclosed with reference to Figures 27<br>
and 28. This is a variation on the tear strip design disclosed above with reference to<br>
Figures 23 and 24. In accordance with this embodiment, the center connection<br>
member 1172 not only joins and releases the two housing members 1120, 1122, but<br>
has a camming member 1174 on the distal end of the center connection member 1172<br>
that as it is pulled through the system actually cams the first and second housing<br>
members 1120, 1122 apart not just allowing them to freely fall apart.<br>
More particularly, and as discussed above with the various other embodiments,<br>
the suturing body 1114 includes a first housing member 1120 and a second housing-<br>
member 1122 making up the suture housing 1124. The first and second housing<br>
members 1120, 1122 are hinged 1176 along one end thereof, with a spring 1178<br>
END5789USNP<br>
38<br><br>
biasing the first and second housing members 1120, 1122 to an open orientation (or<br>
are separate non-associated non-spring biased halves). The central connection<br>
member 1172 is positioned through the centerline of the first and second housing-<br>
members 1120, 1122. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the central<br>
connection member 1172 is secured to the first and second housing members 1120,<br>
1122 through a member that is rigid enough to prevent inadvertent deployment of the<br>
system but can be broken or disengaged from the distal end of the suture housing<br>
1124. When pulled, the central connection member 1172 releases the first and second<br>
housing member 1120, 1122 allowing the suture housing 1124 to fall open.<br>
The opening of the suturing body 1114 upon removal of the central connection<br>
member 1172 is facilitated by including a camming member 1174 at the distal end<br>
1180 of the central connection member 1172. The camming member 1174 is<br>
positioned and shaped such that it extends between the first and second housing-<br>
members 1120, 1122 in a manner pushing the first and second housing members<br>
1120, 1122 apart for removal of the needle 1128 or to provide other access to the<br>
internal structure of the suturing body 1114.<br>
Referring to Figures 29, 30 and 31 yet a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention is disclosed. The embodiment employs a series of crushable interlocking<br>
clamps 1270 in the selective opening of the suturing body 1214. As with the cam pin<br>
END5789USNP<br>
39<br><br>
set, the interlocking clamps 1270 hold the first and second housing members 1220,<br>
1222 together during normal function. When a cable 1272 secured to the interlocking<br>
clamps 1270 is pulled, the interlocking clamps 1270 are crushed, unlocking the first<br>
and second housing members 1220, 1222 and allowing them to pivot open under the<br>
control of the spring biased hinge 1274.<br>
In addition to the inclusion of a release structure for the housing structures<br>
described above, each of these embodiments is provided with a housing outer profile,<br>
shaped and dimensioned to permit limited closing of the suturing body as it is<br>
withdrawn from the stomach. In particular, the outer profile is rounded with a<br>
convex profile designed such that the first and second housing member are at least<br>
partially forced together when the suturing device is withdrawn through a trans-oral<br>
tube.<br>
With the convex profile in mind, it is contemplated it may be desirable to hinge<br>
the first and second housing members along their proximal ends (see Figures 27 and<br>
28). Either of the various release mechanism may be used in accordance with this<br>
embodiment. However, by positioning the hinge at the proximal end thereof the first<br>
and second housing members are directly connected to the shaft allowing them to be<br>
easily re-closed during extraction rather than having numerous loose parts free to<br>
move and fall wherever.<br>
END5789USNP<br>

One of the challenges of a suturing apparatus offering a needle that moves<br>
through a continuous circular path is to identify to the user where the needle is in the<br>
stroke of the device as well as give the user a method to stop at the end of one full<br>
stroke around before starting the next stroke. Current imaging techniques allow<br>
doctors to visuali2e a variety of endoscopic procedures. However, the techniques and<br>
devices must be designed to permit visualization. In addition, and where visualization<br>
is important to completion of the technique, it is important that physical feedback be<br>
combined with the visual feedback to ensure redundancy in the event visualization is<br>
not possible.<br>
As such, the present suturing apparatus is provided widi a variety of indicators<br>
for both physical and visual identification of the procedure being performed. Briefly,<br>
and as will be discussed below in greater detail, the present endoscopic suturing device<br>
includes means for idendfying the position of the needle along its path both locally in<br>
the surgical field and externally on the actuation mechanism. In addition, the<br>
endoscopic suturing device includes a secondary mechanism designed to stop the<br>
needle at the end of one full actuation to indicate to the user that it is the proper time<br>
in the sequence to re-position the device for subsequent actuations.<br>
More particularly, and in accordance with the various embodiments described<br>
below, the surgical suturing apparatus includes a suture housing and a needle mounted<br>
END5789USNP<br>
41<br><br>
within the suture housing for movement about an arcuate path. A drive assembly<br>
operably associated with the needle for controlling movement of the needle with a<br>
suture secured thereto about the arcuate path in a manner facilitating application of<br>
the suture to tissue. A mechanism is provided for determining the position of at least<br>
one of the distal end of the needle and the proximal end of the needle at all points<br>
along the arcuate path about which the needle moves.<br>
Referring to Figure 32, the endoscopic suturing device 1610 includes a spring<br>
ball lock 1670 shaped and dimensioned to provide a physical indication of the needle<br>
1628 position. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, a small ball bearing 1672<br>
is spring 1674 biased into the path of the oncoming needle 1628 to stop its motion at<br>
the end of its travel. The ball bearing 1672 is mounted within the suturing body 1614<br>
for access to and contact with the exterior surface of the needle 1628. The ball<br>
bearing 1672 is spring 1674 biased toward the exterior surface of the needle 1628. As<br>
such, when the needle 1628 is moved along its arcuate path and comes into contact<br>
with the ball bearing 1672, tactile feedback is provided to the user. The needle 1628 is<br>
provided with a recess 1676 along its exterior surface (preferably adjacent the tip of<br>
the needle, although multiple recesses may be employed at various locations along the<br>
length of the needle to provide physical indications of needle position). The recess<br>
1676 is shaped and dimensioned to permit the ball bearing 1672 to seat therein when<br>
END5789USNP<br>
42<br><br>
the needle recess 1676 comes into alignment with the ball bearing 1672 providing the<br>
user with tactile feedback of the needle positioned 1628. In accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment, the ball bearing 1672 is positioned adjacent the entry point for<br>
the needle 1628 as it begins its throw loop and the recess 1676 of the needle 1628 is<br>
formed therealong at a position such that the operator is provided with additional<br>
tactile feedback that a complete needle loop is achieved.<br>
It is contemplated the ball bearing may be used in combination with a camming<br>
mechanism to move it out of the path for the next stroke to occur or it can be used at<br>
a restricting force that only applies feedback to the user that the end of a stroke has<br>
been achieved, but can be overcome by the user though the application of more force.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to Figure 33, a<br>
spring ratchet pawl lock 1770 is oriented to interfere with movement of the needle<br>
1728 for identifying needle 1728 position and the completion of a needle loop. More<br>
particularly, a pawl lock lever arm 1772 is secured along the forward end of the needle<br>
path for contact with the needle 1728 in a manner providing a physical indication as<br>
to the position of the needle 1728. The pawl lock lever arm 1772 is secured along the<br>
forward end of the needle path for contact with the needle 1728 in a manner<br>
providing a physical indication. The pawl lock lever arm 1772 includes a first end<br>
1774 and second end 1776. The first end 1774 of the lever arm 1772 is pivotally<br>
END5789USNP<br>
43<br><br>
secured to the suturing body 1714 of the suturing device 1710. The second end 1776<br>
of lever arm 1772 extends toward and into contact with the exterior surface of the<br>
needle 1728. The lever arm 1772 is oriented such that when the needle 1728 is moved<br>
in a counter-clockwise direction, the lever arm 1772 slides over the exterior surface of<br>
the needle 1728.<br>
However, and as with the prior embodiment, the exterior surface of the needle<br>
1728 is provided with a recess 1778 along its exterior surface. The recess 1778 is<br>
shaped and dimensioned to permit the second end 1776 of the lever arm 1772 to seal:<br>
therein when the needle recess 1778 comes into alignment with the second end 1776<br>
of the lever arm 1772. As mentioned above, and in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment, the lever arm 1772 is positioned adjacent the entry point for the needle<br>
1728 as it begins its throw loop and the recess 1778 of the needle 1728 is formed<br>
therealong at a position such that the operator is provided with a tactile feedback that<br>
a complete needle loop is achieved.<br>
Referring to Figures 34, 35, 36 and 37, the suturing apparatus includes a pop-<br>
out indicator pin 1870. The pin 1870 is shaped and dimensioned to pop out the side<br>
of the suturing body 1814 when the needle 1828 is in its advanced position giving the<br>
surgeon visible feedback as to the needle 1828 position within the surgical site of the<br>
endoscope. Once the needle 1828 is fully advanced, the pin 1870 is spring biased to<br>
END5789USNP<br>
44<br><br>
the hidden or in position indicating the suturing apparatus 1810 is ready for<br>
repositioning (see Figures 34 and 35). Visualization thereof is provided by coloring<br>
the exposed portion 1871 of the pin 1870 in a distinctive color to allow ready<br>
identification that the needle 1828 is positioned in a desired orientation.<br>
More particular, the pin 1870 is spring biased within an aperture 1872 formed<br>
in the wall of the suturing body 1814. The pin 1870 is biased to a hidden position and<br>
includes a first end 1876 and a second end 1878. The first end 1876 is positioned for<br>
contact with the needle 1828 as it moves along its arcuate path, while the second end<br>
1878 is positioned adjacent the outer surface of the aperture 1872 for movement<br>
between a hidden position and an exposed position. With this in mind, the second<br>
end 1878 of the pin 1870 is colored in a distinctive manner allowing ready<br>
visualization thereof.<br>
Movement of the pin 1870 is facilitated by the movement of the needle 1828<br>
into contact with the first end 1876 of the pin 1870. In particular, the first end 1876<br>
of the pin 1870 is seated within the path of the needle 1828, although it is shaped and<br>
dimensioned to readily move once the needle 1828 moves into contact therewith<br>
(without unduly interfering with the movement of the needle as it makes its arcuate<br>
path).<br>
END5789USNP<br>
45<br><br>
In accordance with another embodiment and with reference to Figure 38, the<br>
needle 1928 is colored to provide ready visualization thereof. More particularly, the<br>
needle 1928 is made with contrasting color to the surgical field to improve the<br>
visibility of the surgeon to identify where the needle 1928 is currently positioned. In<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment, the tip 1970 is colored with the contrasting<br>
color to provide a ready identification the needle is exiting the suturing body.<br>
Referring to Figure 39, yet a further embodiment is disclosed. In accordance<br>
with this embodiment, the needle 2028 position is calibrated with an indicator 2070<br>
secured at the handle of the suturing apparatus 2010. It is contemplated the indicator<br>
2070 might be several hemispherical patterned lights, a dial indicator or other circular<br>
path indicator. In accordance with this embodiment, the suturing body 2014 is<br>
provided with one or multiple Hall effect sensors 2074 working in conjunction with<br>
the needle 2028 to provide the operator with an indication of the needle 2028<br>
position. As the steel or magnetized steel needle 2028 passes adjacent the three<br>
sensors 2074 shown in Figure 39 the system lights up the appropriate needle position<br>
indicator lights 2070 on handle 2072. Although Hall effect sensors are disclosed in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, other electronic<br>
means known to those skilled in the art could be used within the spirit of the present<br>
invention. For example, the sensors could be mechanical spring biased switches, or<br>
END5789USNP<br>
46<br><br>
even extremely low voltage contact or inductance switches that make contact through<br>
needle itself making contact with both side of the switches (one placed on either side<br>
of the needle track).<br>
Improved functionality of the present suturing apparatus is achieved by the<br>
provision of a mechanical attachment mechanism specifically adapted for attaching<br>
the vacuum chamber and suturing body to the end of the endoscope, allowing for<br>
rotational positioning of the endoscopic suturing device with respect to the<br>
endoscope. The various embodiments described below provide for a mechanical<br>
attachment mechanism that attaches the vacuum chamber and suturing body at the<br>
end of the endoscope, allowing for flexible positioning of the vacuum chamber and<br>
suturing body away from the endoscope to increase visibility of the pocket. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment described below, the mechanical attachment<br>
mechanism includes a flexible connection arm that collapses against the endoscope<br>
during insertion for a low profile insertion, but then springs away from the endoscope<br>
once in the body to improve visibility of the vacuum chamber and suturing body for<br>
positioning and suture deployment.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the mechanical attachment<br>
mechanism attaches the vacuum chamber and suturing body to the end of the<br>
endoscope through the use of a detachable mechanism that can be removed and<br>
END5789USNP<br>
47<br><br>
passed into a body cavity prior to the introduction of the endoscope, or for<br>
interchanging the suturing apparatus with another suturing body or even another<br>
endoscopic device. This could also allow for interchanging between a vacuum assist<br>
suture device and a non-assisted device.<br>
The mechanisms provide for a unique method for access to a body cavity<br>
through either a natural orifice or a surgical initiated orifice. In particular, the present<br>
invention provides a method for inserting a suturing apparatus, or other surgical<br>
instrument, through a body orifice. The instrument has a low profile orientation and<br>
a deployed orientation which is larger than the size of the body orifice through which<br>
it is to be inserted. The method is achieved by coupling the instrument to an<br>
endoscope and placing the instrument in its low profile orientation, inserting the<br>
endoscope and the instrument through a natural orifice to a target position within a<br>
body while the instrument is in its low profile orientation, and actuating the<br>
instrument to it is deployed orientation. Finally, the instrument is returned to its low<br>
profile orientation and withdrawn from the body through the natural orifice.<br>
Referring to Figure 40, a first embodiment in accordance with the present<br>
invention is disclosed. In accordance with this embodiment, a scope attachment ring<br>
2170 is secured about the distal end 2172 of the endoscope 2174 to which the present<br>
suturing apparatus 2110 is to be mounted. The attachment ring 2170 generally<br>
END5789USNP<br>
48<br><br>
includes a ring body 2176 having parallel apertures 2178, 21.80 respectively shaped for<br>
the receipt of the endoscope 2174 and the support shaft 2182 of the present suturing<br>
apparatus 2110 to which the suturing body 2114 and vacuum chamber 2146 are<br>
attached. With regard to the endoscope 2174, the first aperture 2178 is shaped for<br>
frictional engagement with the outer surface of the endoscope 2174 in a manner<br>
preventing rotation of the attachment ring 2170 relative to the endoscope 2174.<br>
The second aperture 2180 is shaped and dimensioned for receiving the shaft<br>
2182 of the suturing apparatus 2110, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment<br>
thereof, the second aperture 2180 is slightly larger than the shaft 2182 of the suturing<br>
apparatus 2110. In this way, the suturing apparatus 2110 may be rotated relative to<br>
the endoscope 2174 for improved access to tissue. Positioning of the suturing<br>
apparatus 2110 relative to the attachment ring 2170 is achieved by positioning<br>
abutment members 2184, 2186 along the shaft 2182 of the suturing apparatus 2110 on<br>
opposite sides of the attachment ring 2170. These members 2184, 2186 can be<br>
coupled to the shaft 2182 via screw threads during manufacturing, pressed into place<br>
during manufacturing or be molded as part of the attachment ring itself. In this way,<br>
the suturing apparatus 2110 may be freely rotated relative to the endoscope 2174<br>
while the suturing apparatus 2110 is substantially prevented from longitudinal<br>
movement relative thereto.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
49<br><br>
In accordance with another embodiment and with reference to Figures 41, 42<br>
and 43, an endoscope attachment ring 2270 similar to that described above is secured<br>
about the distal end 2272 of the endoscope 2274 to which the present suturing<br>
apparatus 2210 is to be mounted. The attachment ring 2270 generally includes a ring-<br>
body 2276 having parallel apertures 2278, 2280 respectively shaped for the receipt of<br>
the endoscope 2274 and the present suturing apparatus shaft 2282. With regard to<br>
the endoscope 2274, the aperture 2278 is shaped for frictional engagement with the<br>
outer surface of the endoscope 2274 in a manner preventing rotation of the<br>
attachment ring 2270 relative to the endoscope 2274.<br>
As for the second aperture 2280 receiving the shaft 2282 of the suturing<br>
apparatus 2210, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment thereof, the second<br>
aperture 2280 is approximately the same size as the shaft 2282 of the suturing<br>
apparatus 2210. In this way, the suturing apparatus 2210 is prevented from rotating<br>
relative to the endoscope 2274 allowing for the elastic deployment off the axis of the<br>
endoscope 2274 to permit better visualization. Positioning of the suturing apparatus<br>
2210 relative to the attachment ring 2270 is achieved by positioning abutment<br>
members 2284, 2286 along the shaft 2282 of the suturing apparatus 2210 on opposite<br>
sides of the attachment ring 2270. In an alternate embodiment the fit between the<br>
endoscope attachment ring and the elastic arm could be a loose fit as discussed above<br>
END5789USNP<br>
50<br><br>
with regard to the embodiment shown in Figure 40 permitting it to be freely rotated<br>
relative to the endoscope while the endoscopic suturing device is substantially<br>
prevented from longitudinal movement relative thereto.<br>
Improved access of the suturing apparatus is further facilitated by<br>
manufacturing the shaft 2282 distal from the second aperture 2280 of the attachment<br>
ring 2270 from a flexible material that is biased to a position removed from the<br>
endoscope 2274. In this way, the suturing apparatus 2210 may be held close to the<br>
endoscope 2274 during insertion, reducing the profile of the structure being inserted<br>
trans-orally, while allowing for movement of the suturing apparatus 2210 away from<br>
the endoscope 2274 when the suturing apparatus 2210 reaches its desired location.<br>
More particularly, the portion of the shaft 2282a providing for flexing of the<br>
suturing body 2214 away from the endoscope 2274 is an elastomer lever arm designed<br>
to move the suturing apparatus 2210 off axis from the endoscope 2274 in a manner<br>
improving visualization of the suturing apparatus 2210 and its usage while still<br>
allowing it to deflect against the endoscope during insertion and extraction, reducing<br>
its overall profile during these activities.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention and with<br>
reference to Figures 41a and 42a, the attachment ring 2270a may be constructed with<br>
a connection member 2283a extending distally from second aperture 2280a. The<br>
END5789USNP<br>
51<br><br>
connection member 2283a is an elastomer lever arm designed to move the suturing<br>
apparatus 2210a, with the shaft 2282a thereof extending through the connection<br>
member 2283a off axis from the endoscope 2274a in a manner improving<br>
visualization of the suturing apparatus 2210 and its usage while still allowing- it to<br>
deflect against the endoscope 2274a during insertion and extraction, reducing its<br>
overall profile during these activities.<br>
As briefly mention above, the connection member 2283a is shaped and<br>
dimensioned to fit about the shaft 2282a of the suturing apparatus 2210a. The<br>
connection member 2283a is constructed of a resilient material and is biased to a<br>
position removed from the endoscope 2274a. In this way, the connection member<br>
2283a with the shaft 2282a of the suturing apparatus 2210 extending therethrough<br>
may be held close to the endoscope 2274a during insertion, reducing the profile of the<br>
structure being inserted trans-orally. However, once the suturing body 2214a is<br>
positioned within the body cavity, the connection member 2283a is released, allowing<br>
it to extend away from the endoscope 2274a. Because the shaft 2282a of the suturing<br>
apparatus 2210 is positioned within the connection member 2283a, the shaft 2282a<br>
and the suturing body 2214a are moved away from the endoscope 2274a as the<br>
connection member 2283a moves away from the endoscope 2274a.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
52<br><br>
In addition to the various embodiments discussed above and with reference to<br>
Figures 44, 45 and 46, it is contemplated a guidewire introducer 2470 for a suturing<br>
apparatus 2410 may be employed. Such a device is used in combination with a<br>
detachable vacuum chamber 2446 and suturing body 2414 detailed above. The distal<br>
end components, that is, the vacuum chamber 2446 and the suturing body 2414 are<br>
passed, for example, through the oral cavity in advance of the endoscope 2472 and<br>
subsequently attached to the endoscope attachment ring 2474 via a guide wire 2470<br>
which is pulled through a support shaft 2476 in a manner drawing the suturing body<br>
2414 and vacuum chamber 2446 onto the support shaft 2476. The endoscope 2472<br>
itself can be used to advance the detached vacuum chamber 2446 and a suturing body<br>
2414 down the oral cavity. The pre-positioned guide wire 2470 within the working<br>
channel of the endoscope 2472 is terminated at its distal end 2471 by connection to<br>
the vacuum chamber 2446 and suturing body 2414. Once passed into the stomach,<br>
the vacuum chamber 2446 and suturing body 2414 are pulled back into attachment to<br>
the distal end of the endoscope 2472 and onto a support shaft 2476 by pulling the<br>
suturing body 2414 and vacuum chamber 2446 into engagement with the endoscope<br>
2472 through the action of the guidewire 2470 to which the vacuum chamber 2446<br>
and suturing body 2414 are connected. This allows for use of a vacuum chamber<br>
END5789USNP<br>
53<br><br>
2446 and suturing body 2414 that are laterally and thickness wise larger than could be<br>
passed in fixed attachment to the endoscope during insertion.<br>
As an alternative embodiment, the vacuum chamber can be interchangeable<br>
used with non-vacuum equipment that looks similar or identical to the vacuum<br>
version, but does not utilize the vacuum to position the tissue and merely relies upon<br>
placing the chamber adjacent to the tissue to be sutured. This drastically reduces the<br>
bite size, but also reduces the possible trauma to the tissue that vacuuming the tissue<br>
into the pocket may cause.<br>
In particular, there are some procedures that would preferably be used without<br>
a vacuum assist to pull the tissue into the vacuum chamber, but rather would merely<br>
throw the suture with minimal tissue bite depth. There are even clinical situations<br>
where the vacuum could induce damage to the tissue. An interchangeable vacuum<br>
chamber that has a differing cavity depth and profile could be used with the suturing<br>
apparatus without a vacuum assist.<br>
A quick handle disconnect is also contemplated in accordance with present<br>
invention and is shown with reference to Figures 47, 48, 49, 50 and 51. This feature<br>
may be used in combination with or separately from the guidewire introducer as<br>
described above. Briefly, this embodiment employs a suture housing 2524, a needle<br>
2528 mounted within the suture housing 2524 for movement about an arcuate path, a<br>
END5789USNP<br>
54<br><br>
drive assembly operably associated with the needle 2528 for controlling movement of<br>
the needle 2528 with a suture secured thereto about the arcuate path in a manner<br>
facilitating application of the suture to tissue, a handle 2570, an elongated flexible<br>
member, for example, a drive cable 2542 having a distal end attached to the suture<br>
housing 2524 and a proximal end attached to the handle 2570, and a mechanism for<br>
releasing and reattaching the handle 2570 to the flexible member 2542.<br>
The utilization of a quick handle disconnect facilitates distal detachment and<br>
pre-passing of the suturing apparatus 2510 through the selective attachment and<br>
detachment of the handle 2570 from the flexible drive cable 2542 to which the<br>
suturing body 2514 and vacuum chamber 2546 are connected. In accordance with,<br>
this embodiment, the drive cable 2542 may function much like the guidewire<br>
previously discussed in allowing one to pass the suturing body 2514 and the vacuum<br>
chamber 2546 into position prior to complete assembly. This improvement allows<br>
one to pre-pass the suturing apparatus 2510 from the distal end of the endoscope in<br>
manner reducing the required profile because the suturing apparatus 2510 is<br>
positioned distal of the endoscope during passage thereof rather than passing the<br>
suturing apparatus 2510 from the proximal end of the endoscope in a manner<br>
increasing the required passageway since the profile must accommodate both.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
55<br><br>
More particularly, the handle 2570 is composed of a handle body 2574 in which<br>
the drive cable 2542 is releasably secured for actuation. With this in mind, the handle<br>
body 2574 includes a central passageway 2578 in which the drive cable 2542 is stored<br>
and mounted. The handle body 2574 is composed of a central grip 2580 and a slide<br>
member 2581 that moves relative to the central grip 2580 in a manner discussed<br>
below in greater detail. The central passageway 2578 includes a first open end 2582<br>
and a second closed end 2584. Adjacent the second closed end 2584 is a spring-<br>
loaded trigger lock 2586 secured to the central grip 2580. The trigger lock 2586 is<br>
shaped and dimensioned to engage a protrusion 2594 (for example, a bullet nose tip)<br>
along the proximal tip 2588 of the drive cable 2542. In this way, the proximal tip<br>
2588 of the drive cable 2542 is mounted within a recess 2590 in the proximal end<br>
2592 of the passageway 2578 and within the central grip 2580 (for centering thereof),<br>
and the trigger lock 2586 is moved downward into engagement with the protrusion<br>
2594 for maintaining the drive cable 2576 within the handle body 2574. When it is<br>
desired to remove the handle 2570 from the drive cable 2578, one need only actuate<br>
the trigger lock 2586 to its release position and the handle body 2574 may be freely<br>
removed from the drive cable 2542. Retention of the drive cable 2542 within the<br>
handle body 2574 is further facilitated by the inclusion of a locking slide 2596 along<br>
END5789USNP<br>
56<br><br>
the slide member 2581. The locking slide 2596 frictionally interacts with a collar 2598<br>
formed on drive cable 2542 for retention of the handle body 2574 thereon.<br>
In practice, the distal end of the drive cable 2542 is inserted within the<br>
passageway 2578 formed in the slide member 2581. The drive cable 2542 is inserted<br>
to such a point that the collar 2598 of the drive cable 2576 is aligned with openings<br>
2583 formed along the slide member 2581. At this point, the locking slide 2596 is slid<br>
along the slide member 2581 and is moved over the collar 2598 into engagement<br>
therewith. The drive cable 2542 is, at this point, secured to the slide member 2581.<br>
The slide member 2581 is then moved proximally relative to the central grip 2580<br>
until the proximal end 2588 of the drive cable 2542 is seated within the recess 2590<br>
formed in the central grip 2580. The trigger lock 2586 is then spring actuated to<br>
engage the protrusion 2594 at the proximal tip 2588 of the drive cable 2542 for<br>
securing it to the central grip 2580 and the handle body 2574.<br>
Once the handle 2570 is secured to the drive cable 2542, release thereof is<br>
achieved by reversing the attachment steps discussed above. In particular, the trigger<br>
lock 2586 is rotated forward to permit release of the protrusion 2594 from within the<br>
recess 2590 of the central grip 2580.<br>
As discussed above, the present handle 2570 allows for actuation of the drive<br>
cable 2542 in a manner operating the present suturing apparatus 2510. In particular,<br>
END5789USNP<br>
57<br><br>
relative movement of the central grip 2580 and the slide member 2581 while the drive<br>
cable 2542 is seated within the central grip 2580 causes actuation thereof permitting<br>
the drive assembly to function in the manner described above.<br>
Although the selectively releasable connection is described above with<br>
reference to the handle of a suturing apparatus, it is contemplated the releasable<br>
connection could similar be applied in the selective connection of the suturing body<br>
to the shaft connecting the suturing body to the handle. In this way, one could<br>
selectively connect the suturing body to the shaft once the suturing body is positioned<br>
within the body cavity and ready for use in the application of a suture to tissue.<br>
The vacuum pressure available in different operating room suites varies greatly<br>
from location to location. Improvements to the vacuum chamber minimizing the<br>
necessary vacuum required have been discussed above. However, such structural<br>
changes might not: be sufficient to ensure the present endoscopic suturing apparatus<br>
can be used in any location. The embodiments detailed herein are improvements to<br>
the handle to locally increase the vacuum in the vacuum chamber.<br>
Each of these embodiments provides an endoscopic instrument, for example, a<br>
suturing apparatus, adapted for use with an endoscope. The instrument includes an<br>
elongated tube having a distal end and a proximal end, an end effector, for example,<br>
the suturing body of the suturing apparatus, attached to the distal end of the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
58<br><br>
elongated tube, and a handle attached to the proximal end. 'The handle includes a<br>
mechanism for attaching the instrument to a first vacuum source. The handle further<br>
includes a second vacuum source integral with the handle for amplifying the first<br>
vacuum source, whereby the first and second vacuum sources combine to operate the<br>
end effector.<br>
Referring to Figure 64, this problem is addressed by the provision of a syringe<br>
based handle vacuum assist device 2970. In accordance with a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention, a syringe mechanism 2972 is placed in parallel to the main<br>
vacuum attachment 2973 to the suturing apparatus 2910. This allows the normal<br>
operating room vacuum source to be used to accomplish as much as it is capable of<br>
and, if additional vacuum is still necessary to get a good tissue bite, the syringe<br>
mechanism 2972 can be pulled by the surgeon to increase the vacuum in the vacuum<br>
chamber 2946. Since the normally available vacuum source of the operating room is<br>
the primary mechanism for drawing tissue into the vacuum chamber 2946, the volume<br>
necessary in the syringe mechanism 2972 is minimized as the tissue will already be<br>
engaged in the vacuum chamber 2946, although not to its full depth. An additional<br>
benefit of this method of assisting an operating room vacuum source is that fluids will<br>
have already been evacuated from the vacuum chamber 2946 by the normal or<br>
END5789USNP<br>
59<br><br>
primary operating room suction means and the syringe mechanism 2972 will not: be<br>
filled with bodily fluids.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, and with reference to Figures 65, a<br>
battery 3071 powered multi-stroke vacuum assist device 3070 for suction actuation is<br>
provided. The vacuum assist device 3070 includes a rotary fluid pump 3072 (lobe<br>
pump, gear pump, peristalsis pump, etc.) to be used in a multi-stroke fashion to<br>
increase the maximum volume of gasses that can be extracted from the vacuum<br>
chamber after the primary vacuum source of the operating room is completely<br>
engaged. This has the same benefits of the syringe based system, but provides for the<br>
ability to exchange a greater volume of gas.<br>
Similarly, and with reference to Figure 66, a battery 3171 operated disposable<br>
vacuum pump 3170 is associated with a disposable deployment handle 3172 used in<br>
conjunction with the present suturing apparatus 3110. Like the mechanical multi-<br>
stroke mechanism detailed above, a battery operated, motor driven, disposable fluid<br>
pump 3170 is included in the handle 3172 to supplement the vacuum available from<br>
the operating room.<br>
Although Figures 65 and 66 disclose systems that are automatically actuated to<br>
create a secondary vacuum source, Figure 67 discloses a trigger actuated system 3070a.<br>
The trigger 3074a employs trigger handles 3076a in conjunction with a gearing<br>
END5789USNP<br>
60<br><br>
arrangement 3078a to drive a fluid pump, for example, a single lobe fluid pump<br>
3072a. As with the prior embodiments, actuation of the trigger 3074a and the fluid<br>
pump 3072a increases the maximum volume of gases that may be extracted from the<br>
vacuum chamber after the primary vacuum source of the operating room is<br>
completely engaged. This has the same benefits of the syringe based system and the<br>
automated system, but provides for manual actuation offering a surgeon greater<br>
control.<br>
It is further contemplated the vacuum assist may be created via a squeeze bulb<br>
with a one-way valve or a bellow mechanisms with a one-way valve or a secondary<br>
suction line. In addition, an idling vane 3172a could also be incorporated to<br>
intermittently provide vacuum assist (see Figure 68).<br>
As discussed above, visualization of the suturing apparatus 3510 is often<br>
critically important to the proper use thereof. With this in mind, the suturing<br>
apparatus 3510 may be modified to improve imaging thereof. In particular, the<br>
apparatus 3510 includes a flexible member 3516, for example, a support shaft or<br>
endoscope, having a distal end attached to a suturing body 3514 for insertion of the<br>
suturing body 3514 through an orifice and into a body cavity. The suturing body<br>
3514 includes a suture housing 3524 in which a needle 3528 and drive assembly are<br>
housed for movement of the needle 3528 with a suture secured thereto about an<br>
END5789USNP<br>
61<br><br>
arcuate path facilitating application of the suture to tissue. A non-visible spectrum<br>
sensing member 3570 is associated with the suturing body 3514 for communicating a<br>
parameter of the procedure to a visual display 3572. In accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment, the non-visible spectrum sensing member is wirelessly linked to the<br>
visual display.<br>
For example, it is contemplated the suturing apparatus 3510 may be modified<br>
through implementation of ultrasonic transducers 3570 in the suturing body 3514 (see<br>
Figures 83 and 84). Similarly, the suturing apparatus 3510 may be modified by the<br>
inclusion of a magnetic resonance imaging source transducer based within the<br>
suturing body or vacuum chamber to image the local suture site. Further, it is<br>
contemplated the endoscopic suturing device may be modified with the inclusion of<br>
an infrared based imaging sensor within the suturing body or vacuum chamber to<br>
evaluate blood flow to the sutured area post suture deployment or to identify blood<br>
rich areas in the interior lining pre-suture deployment for blood flow visualization.<br>
The endoscopic suturing device may also include Laser Doppler, oxygen, or carbon<br>
dioxide based sensors located within the suturing device to evaluate the blood flow<br>
characteristics before or after the suture line is deployed.<br>
These various visualization techniques provide for non-visible (outside the<br>
normal visible spectrum) imaging integrated into the suturing apparatus to improve<br>
END5789USNP<br>
62<br><br>
the visualization of the site during suturing. As mentioned above, the contemplated<br>
mechanisms could be ultrasonic, infrared, MRI, Laser Doppler, oxygen and carbon<br>
dioxide sensors or other sensor system. In addition, the sensors provide for tissue<br>
penetration visualization means for viewing the location of surrounding organ<br>
geometry and Tissue penetration visualization means for viewing the suture<br>
deployment depth and bite size.<br>
Referring to Figure 85 a cartridge 3670 for the loading of needles 3628 and<br>
sutures 3612 of different sizes is disclosed. In accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment, a reloadable cartridge 3670 is capable of loading differing size needles<br>
3628 and differing size sutures 3612. The cartridge 3670 is shaped and dimensioned<br>
for ready attachment within the channel 3672 in which the needle 3628 is mounted in<br>
accordance with the embodiment disclosed. In particular, the suturing body 3614 is<br>
provided with a cover 3674 providing access to and closure of the channel 3672 in<br>
which the needle 3628 is located. Through the implementation of a cartridge based<br>
system the detachable cartridge 3670 can be removed and replaced with a fresh needle<br>
3628 and suture 3612 or even a different size of needle or suture.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the needle 3628 is supported in a<br>
track member 3676, which readily seats within the channel 3672 to create an assembly<br>
substantially similar to that disclosed above with reference to Figures 3 to 10.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
63<br><br>
The cartridge based system may further be adapted to allow for the adjustment<br>
of the needle size through a simple cartridge replacement. In particular, and with<br>
reference to Figure 86, the track 3780 of the cartridge 3770 is provided with a spacer<br>
wedge 3782 taking up the space lost with the inclusion of a smaller needle 3728. The<br>
spacer wedge 3782 is shaped and dimensioned to interact with the friction camming<br>
member 3738 in a manner allowing the suturing apparatus 3710 to operate in<br>
accordance with this spirit of the present invention.<br>
While a cartridge based system is disclosed above, the suturing body of the<br>
suturing apparatus could be designed to permit simple replacement of the needle<br>
alone. Referring to Figures 87 and 88 this is achieved through the provision of an<br>
openable suturing body 3814. Rather than having a cartridge based reload, this<br>
embodiment for reloading merely controls the needle 3828 and suture 3812, making<br>
quick loading of a device without a removable section. The needle 3828 would be<br>
coupled to the reloader 3870 via a clamp 3872 that could be released or easily broken<br>
and the suture 3812 would be maintained on the handhold section 3874 of the<br>
reloader 3870. This would facilitate manipulation of the needle 3828 without<br>
touching it directly and would provide some form of suture management prior to<br>
being loaded into the suturing apparatus 3828.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
64<br><br>
One of the difficulties in performing endoscopic procedures is efficiently and<br>
securely forming knots once the suturing is completed. It is desired the two ends, or<br>
leads, of the suture could be pulled tight simultaneously and a knotting element could<br>
then be used to tighten the adjacent ends. This would maximize the number of<br>
stitches that could be thrown before the suture needs to be cinched down since both<br>
ends of the suture could be pulled in a manner equally cinching from both ends of the<br>
suture.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a suture<br>
is secured by inserting the suture through a passageway into the body of a patient.<br>
The suture is then thrown into and back out of tissue. Finally a knot is tied along the<br>
length of suture in a manner securing the suture in place. The knot is then fused<br>
through the application of energy mechanically linking the first and second leads of<br>
the suture forming the knot. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the term<br>
"fusing" is meant to refer to any technique by which the suture and/or knotting<br>
element are brought together in a manner whereby their material components are<br>
fixedly connected.<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, tying of<br>
the knot is achieved in a variety of manners, wherein the first and second leads are<br>
entangled in a manner holding the leads relative to each other. As such, those skilled<br>
END5789USNP<br>
65<br><br>
in the art will appreciate that a variety of knotting techniques may be used in<br>
accordance with the present invention. For example, a traditional tying technique may-<br>
be used wherein the first and second leads of the suture are lied in a mechanical knot<br>
which is subsequently fused.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, and with reference to Figure 62, a<br>
suture hooking device 2710 is disclosed for tying first and second leads 2730, 2732 of<br>
a suture together. The hooking device 2710 utilizes two parts to lock the suture<br>
together in a cap like fashion. The advantage to this method is that the cap 2712 has<br>
two extension arms 2714, 2716 that allow it to be twisted about its axis winding the<br>
suture 2718 mid-lengths onto its shaft. The cap 2712 would then be crushed into the<br>
outside collar 2720 locking the suture ends 2718. This would allow for fine tensioning<br>
just prior to locking the suture together.<br>
More particularly, the suture hooking device 2710 includes an outside collar<br>
2720 and a cap 2712 shaped and dimensioned to fit within the outside collar 2720.<br>
The outside collar 2720 is generally cylindrical and includes an open upper edge 2722<br>
and a close base 2724. The cap 2712 includes an upper disk 2726 and a downwardly<br>
depending central shaft 2728. The upper disk 2726 is shaped and dimensioned to fit<br>
within the open upper edge 2722 of the outside collar 2720 such that it is friclionally<br>
END5789USNP<br>
66<br><br>
retained therein. The central shaft 2728 is smaller and functions as a guide for suture<br>
2718 wrapped thereabout.<br>
The cap 2712 further includes opposed downwardly extending extension arms<br>
2714, 2716. These arms 2714, 2716 provide for wrapping of the suture 2718 about<br>
the cap 2712 upon rotation of the cap 2712. Once the suture 2718 is wrapped about<br>
the cap 2712, the disk 2726 is fixed within the outside collar 2720, securing the suture<br>
2718 in a "knotted" arrangement.<br>
Although various mechanical knotting techniques are disclosed above, it is<br>
contemplated other fastening techniques may be used without departing from the<br>
spirit of the present invention. For example, and with reference to Figure 63, fusing<br>
of the tied suture is preferably achieved by RF, ultrasonic, or electrocautery for<br>
melting of suture knot 2810 to improve knot holding capability. This method would<br>
allow for a normal endoscopic knot to be tied adjacent the cinched tissue area. But<br>
since it would have a tendency to untie, an energy source (cautery, ultrasonic, RF, or<br>
other heat source) would then be applied to the knot fusing the knot together.<br>
The lacing pattern, the cinching method, and the anchoring means of the<br>
suture all contribute greatly to ease of use of the device. With this in mind, various<br>
suturing techniques have been developed. The present disclosure is meant to detail at:<br>
END5789USNP<br>
67<br><br>
least the preferred lacing method and an alternate anchoring method for cinching<br>
both ends simultaneously.<br>
In accordance with the various lacing technique described below, the present<br>
method is achieved by providing a suture with a needle attached thereto. The suture<br>
includes a first lead and a second lead. The needle and suture are then inserted into<br>
an organ through a passageway. A single stitch is thrown through a first tissue<br>
member and a single stitch is thrown through an opposed and spaced apart second<br>
tissue member. The step of throwing stitches is repeated at least once and the first<br>
and second tissue members are brought into contact by tensioning the suture,<br>
whereby suture drag is minimized during the tensioning and even tissue compression<br>
substantially achieved. Finally, the suture is secured in positioned with the first and<br>
second tissue members in apposition.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment shown in Figure 52, resistance to<br>
cinching of a stitched suture 4212 is achieved via a throw reversing pin technique.<br>
The technique is initiated using traditional stitching techniques. That is, the needle<br>
and suture 4212 are inserted and alternating stitches are thrown along opposed tissue<br>
members 4274, 4276. The stitches are consistendy thrown in the proximal to distal<br>
direction, that is, the stitch is initiated by inserting the needle through the tissue<br>
proximally to the point at which the needle stitch is completed by reentering the<br>
END5789USNP<br>
68<br><br>
tissue. Although the terms distally and proximally are used in the present description,<br>
those skilled in the art will appreciate that these terms are relative and ultimately the<br>
specific direction of stitching may be reversed without departing from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
However, the final throw 4270 of the suture 4212 (that is, the final loop or last<br>
stitch of the suture through the tissue) is altered to reduce friction during final<br>
cinching of the suture 4212. More particularly, and in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, drag and friction are reduced by positioning a<br>
reversing pin 4272 between the suture 4212 and the tissue wall 4274 after the last<br>
stitch 4270 is completed. This allows the suture 4212 to be cinched without it<br>
overlapping itself and twisting up. Such an arrangement will significantly reduce the<br>
friction necessary to overcome and cinch closed the lacing.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, and with reference to Figure 53,<br>
resistance to cinching of a stitched suture 4312 is achieved via a throw reverse throw-<br>
over technique. The technique is initiated using traditional stitching techniques. That<br>
is, the needle and suture 4312 are inserted and alternating stitches are thrown along<br>
opposed tissue members 4374, 4376. The stitches are consistently thrown in the<br>
proximal to distal direction, that is, the stitch is initiated by inserting the needle<br>
through the tissue proximally to the point at which the needle stitch is completed by<br>
END5789USNP<br>
69<br><br>
reentering the tissue. That is, the needle and suture 4312 are inserted and alternating<br>
stitches are thrown along opposed tissue members. The stitches are consistently<br>
thrown in the proximal to distal direction, that is, the stitch is initiated by inserting the<br>
needle through the tissue proximally to the point at which the needle is stitch is<br>
completed by reentering the tissue. However, the final throw 4370 of the suture 4312<br>
is reversed to reduce friction during final cinching of the suture; that is, the final<br>
throw 4370 is completed by inserting the needle through the tissue in a direction distal<br>
to the point at which the needle stitch is completed by reentering the tissue.<br>
More particularly, the final stitch 4370 is reversed in the direction in which it is<br>
thrown such that it is directed toward the position from which the surgeon will be<br>
pulling upon the suture line to cinch the suture 4312. This allows the suture to be<br>
cinched without it overlapping itself and twisting up. Such an arrangement will<br>
significantly reduce the friction necessary to overcome and cinch closed the lacing.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to Figure 54,<br>
an initial locking loop 4470 is employed to enhance the ability of one to cinch the<br>
suture 4412 upon completion of the stitching. In particular, a first lead 4412a of the<br>
suture 4412 is anchored to the tissue along the first lead 4412a of the suture line<br>
rather than needing to have both ends accessed by the user throughout the procedure.<br>
More particularly, the first lead, or leading end, 4412a of the suture line is stitched and<br>
END5789USNP<br>
70<br><br>
a portion thereof is anchored to the tissue. Thereafter the stitching is completed, with<br>
the final stitch 4470 and the second lead, or trailing end, 4412b of the suture line is<br>
accessed for cinching thereof. However, and in contrast to traditional cinching<br>
techniques, only the second lead 4412b of the suture line need be pulled to cinch the<br>
suture 4412. As shown in Figures 52 and 53, such an initial locking may be employed<br>
with other lacing techniques within the spirit of the present invention.<br>
It is contemplated each set of sutures may be locally cinched before the next set<br>
is deployed from the suturing apparatus. This minimizes, but does not: eliminate the<br>
need for the last stitch steps discussed above.<br>
As shown in Figures 55 to 61, the preceding techniques for lacing opposed<br>
tissue members may be expanded in various ways. For example, and with reference to<br>
Figure 55, the suture 4512 may be applied in separate segments 4513 with the first and<br>
second ends 4512a, 4512b of each segment 4513 anchored to respective first and<br>
second tissue members 4574, 4576. The first end 4512a of the suture 4512 is<br>
subsequendy tensioned and tied off to cinch the suture. By using segments of stitches<br>
in this manner (and as discussed below in accordance with other embodiments), local<br>
cinching of each segment of stitches may be performed in a manner which may assist<br>
in improving the drawing of tissue together.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
71<br><br>
Referring to Figure 56, the suture 4612 may be applied in separate segments<br>
4613 with the first and second ends 4612a, 4612b of the suture 4612 coupled via a<br>
knotting element 4614. The first and second ends 4612a, 4612b are subsequently<br>
tensioned to cinch the suture 4612 and the knotting element 4614 and suture 4612 are<br>
fused to secure the suture in position.<br>
With reference to Figure 57, the suture 4712 is once again applied in separate<br>
segments 4713. The first end 4712a of the suture 4712 is provided with a loop 4716<br>
through which the remaining portion of the suture 4712 is passed to couple the first<br>
end 4712a of the suture 4712 to a first tissue member 4774. As to the second end<br>
4712b of the suture 4712, it is secured via a knotting element 4714 as discussed above.<br>
More particularly, the second end 4712b is secured to the knotting element 4714 with<br>
a looping structure composed of a first loop 4718 which is coupled to the knotting<br>
element 4714 while a portion of the second end 4712b passes through the second<br>
tissue member 4776 to form a second loop 4720, the end of which is also coupled to<br>
the knotting element 4714. Thereafter, the second end 4712b may be tensioned, in<br>
particular, the first loop 4718 may be drawn through the knotting element 4714 and<br>
the knotting element 4714 and suture 4710 are fused to secure the suture 4710 in<br>
position.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
72<br><br>
With reference to Figure 58, the suture 4812 is applied in separate segments<br>
4813 with the first and second ends 4812a, 4812b of the suture 4812 coupled via a<br>
knotting element 4814. However, the final throw 4870 of the suture 4812 is reversed<br>
as discussed above with regard to Figures 53 and 54. The first and second ends<br>
4812a, 4812b are subsequendy tensioned to cinch the suture 4812 and the knotting<br>
element 4814 and suture 4812 are fused to secure the suture 4812 in position.<br>
Referring to Figure 59, the suture 4912 may be applied in separate segments<br>
4913 with the first and second ends 4912a, 4912b of each segment 4913 anchored to<br>
respective first and second tissue members 4974, 4976. However, each throw of the<br>
suture 4912 is reversed as discussed above with regard to Figures 53 and 54, and<br>
extends in a distal to proximal direction as the suture is applied in the distal direction.<br>
The first end 4912a of the suture 4912 is subsequently tensioned and tied off to cinch<br>
the suture 4912. Referring to Figure 60, the same lacing technique is applied with the<br>
exception it is not completed in segments.<br>
As shown in Figure 61, an overhand knot 5022 may be used to secure the<br>
second end 5012b of the suture 5012, while the first end 5012a of the suture 5012 is<br>
anchored to the tissue.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is preferred to apply medical<br>
fluid/sealant for improving the suture lines ability to engage and retain the tissue.<br>
END5789USNP<br>
73<br><br>
Particular, the suture Line is subjected to substantial strain for a short period of time<br>
after its application while the tissue applies substantial tension in its attempt to retain<br>
to its original configuration. This generally lasts for 7-10 days after the surgery is<br>
completed, and it is during this time period in which potential suture breaks are more<br>
likely. With this in mind, and as the following embodiments disclose, an adhesive,<br>
sealant, or medical fluid delivery mechanism can be used in conjunction with the<br>
present suturing device to increase the short term strength of the stomach pouch by<br>
adhesively binding the opposed tissue. A method of deployment of sealants or other<br>
medical fluid changes the stiffness properties of the tissue to improve the suture<br>
strength of the gastroplasty by adhesively binding the opposed tissue.<br>
As such, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention shown in Figure 69, adhesive 3210 is used to improve short term strength<br>
of the suture line 3213, that is, the line of tissue held together via the suture 3212. A<br>
fluid deploying mechanism is utilized to lay down a line of fluid sealant or adhesive<br>
3210 along the suture line 3214 after the suture line 3214 is completed to improve<br>
holding strength of the line. Either a thin layer adhesive or a foaming (void filling)<br>
adhesive or sealant 3210 can be used in conjunction with the suture 3212.<br>
In accordance with an alternate embodiment, and with reference to Figures 70,<br>
71 and 72, the suture 3312 is a hollow tube suture with periodic perforations 3314<br>
END5789USNP<br>
74<br><br>
along its length. Once the suture line 3313 is finished, the suture 3312 would be<br>
pumped full of the sealant or adhesive 3314 allowing it to be distributed all along its<br>
length increasing both the effective diameter of the suture, minimizing suture<br>
migration as well as providing a complimentary adhesive bond of the tissue together<br>
in addition to the suture line 3313.<br>
Referring to Figures 73 to 82, yet a further embodiment is disclosed. A liquid<br>
polymer extrusion 3350 is used to form a sleeve 3352 around the internal pouch 3353<br>
formed in, for example, the stomach 3354. The entire inside of the small gastroplasy<br>
created pouch 3353 and some length of the intestines would be coated with the<br>
polymer/adhesive 3350. This not only improves the strength of the pouch suture<br>
line, it also potentially creates some form of malabsorption compliment to the<br>
procedure that improves weight loss.<br>
More particularly, and with reference to the various figures, a suction and<br>
application device 3356 is first transorally inserted within the stomach 3354. A<br>
vacuum is then created drawing opposed tissue surfaces 3358, 3360 together as shown<br>
in Figures 72 and 73. Thereafter, the liquid polymer extrusion 3350 is applied to the<br>
opposed tissue surfaces 3358, 3360 while the vacuum continues to be applied in a<br>
manner keeping the walls 3358, 3360 of the stomach 3354 in apposition. Eventually,<br>
the liquid polymer extrusion 3350 will cure holding the apposed tissue walls 3358,<br>
END5789USNP<br>
75<br><br>
3360 in apposition. Thereafter, and with reference to Figures 78 and 79, the suction<br>
and application device 3356 in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
withdrawn and the internal profile of the stomach 3354 is reduced to a simple<br>
passageway extending therethrough with a substantial portion of the stomach closed<br>
off from food absorption. Although the process described above does not employ<br>
sutures, the pouch could certainly be formed with suturing of the opposed tissue with<br>
the subsequent application of adhesives as described above.<br>
While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be<br>
understood that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather,<br>
is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
