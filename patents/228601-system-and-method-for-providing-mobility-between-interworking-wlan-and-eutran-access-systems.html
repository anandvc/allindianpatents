DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The radio access network (RAN), system architecture (SA) and the core terminal (CT) working groups of the third generation partnership project (3GPP) aim to develop an enhanced UTRAN (E-UTRAN) architecture for next generation wireless systems. The E-UTRAN system is required to co-exist with the current second (2G) and third generation (3G) wireless systems, and in particular, support handovers between the existing systems and the newly evolved E-UTRAN system, specified in the 3GPPTR 23.882.<br>
The E-UTRAN system is an evolution of the 3GPP UTRAN system, in which the main entities are the user equipment (UE), the enhanced Node B (ENB) and the enhanced GGSN (EGGSN), as shown in the Figure 1. The ENB of the EUTRAN system is expected to have the features of the Node B and the radio network controller (RNC) of the legacy UTRAN system. The EGGSN is expected to have the functionalities of the SGSN and the GGSN of the legacy UTRAN systems.<br>
The integrated WLAN (l-WLAN) system specified in the 3GPP TS 23.234 specifications provides a system and method to integrate legacy UTRAN systems<br><br>
with WLAN systems, as shown in the Figure 2. The l-WLAN system allows WLAN users to access 3GPP packet switched services.<br>
Currently there is no efficient mechanism specified to provide handover between the l-WLAN and the EUTRAN access systems.<br>

It is another object of the invention to retrieve the active Keys from the AAA server by the EGGSN to authenticate the UE to access EUTRAN.<br>
The present invention is related to the scenario where a UE handover from the l-WLAN to the EUTRAN access networks and also from the EUTRAN to the l-WLAN Access system. The method of the invention comprises of mechanisms that provides mobility solution for the UE capable of simultaneous access and also for the UE which cannot access the access systems simultaneously. This invention also includes a mechanism to utilize the active authentication key in one access system to be used in the other access system to optimize the authentication procedure during handover.<br><br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method and system for providing mobility between interworking WLAN and EUTRAN access systems where handover from the EUTRAN to the l-WLAN access system involves UE sending periodic or event based measurements to the EUTRAN network wherein if the UE measurement is below the threshold or if EUMTS RAT cannot be continued, then EGGSN/ENB requests the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or other means and UE decides that the EUTRAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs. The UE directly send the HO request to the AAA sever, through EGGSN and the packet is routed to the home AAA server by resolving the NAI where the HO request message contains the S-bit, NAI, RAT type, Authentication Vectors and EGGSN IP address included by the EGGSN and alternatively the UE sends the measurements of l-WLAN to the EGGSN as requested by the EGGSN to scan other RATs. The said measurement includes the details of the l-WLAN like WLAN ID, NAI and W-APN/s formed by the UE according to the current ongoing applications. EGGSN resolves IP addresses of the PDG using the W-APN(s) and the HO request is sent to AAA server using NAI where the HO request sent by the EGGSN contains the NAI, RAT type, Authentication Vectors and EGGSN IP address included by the EGGSN. AAA verifies the NAI and stores the Authentication vectors and the EGGSN IP optional Address and the AAA server sends the HO accept message to the EGGSN where the AAA server assigns new IP address to the UE and include the IP address in the HO accept message where optionally, AAA server specify the PDG IP address in the HO accept message, for the UE to establish the tunnel. The EGGSN sends the HO command to the UE and if the EGGSN resolves the PDG IP address/addresses, then the EGGSN includes the IP address/addresses in the HO command and where if the AAA server sends the IP address to the UE in the HO accept message, then the EGGSN includes the IP address in the HO command. If S-bit is off, then the EGGSN starts buffering the packets destined to the UE and if S-bit is on, the EGGSN does not buffer the data destined to the UE. After receiving the HO command, the UE starts the IKEv2 procedure to establish the IPsec tunnel towards the PDG and the UE selects the IP address of the PDG from the list provided by the EGGSN or UE resolve the IP<br><br>
addresses of the PDGs. The UE uses the active keys to derive the authentication keys and send the AUTH payload, to eliminate the EAP authentication procedure for IPsec tunnel establishment. The UE performs the MIP registration procedure and registers with the EGGSN where the UE use the EUTRAN IP address as the HoA, PDG IP address as the CoA and l-WLAN assigned IP address as the Co-CoA. The MIP registration is done for FA-CoA where the MIP registration message is sent to the PDG by the UE and then it is forwarded by the PDG to the appropriate EGGSN. For applications initiated by the UE in the l-WLAN, the UE uses the l-WLAN assigned IP address as the source IP address, and the UE directly contacts the correspondent node or alternatively, for the new applications initiated by the UE in the l-WLAN, the UE uses the reverse tunneling. AAA uses the active keys provided by the EGGSN to derive the tunnel authentication keys and pass the said keys to the PDG for authentication where the AAA server includes the EGGSN IP address in the Access Accept message. AAA server stores the serving EGGSN IP address during the HO preparation procedure or alternatively AAA obtains the new information about the UE in the HSS from the HSS before updating. The UE uses the AAA MIP registration procedure to do MIP registration during the IPsec tunnel establishment procedure where the MIP registration authenticator is generated from the active network access keys where the AAA forwards the MIP registration message to EGGSN and the EGGSN registers the UE and send the MIP ACK message to the UE via PDG. After successful authentication and tunnel establishment procedure, if UE is not capable of simultaneous access then AAA/HSS triggers the EGGSN to release the radio resources allocated to the UE and if the UE is capable of simultaneous access then the UE starts EUMTS detach procedure. The PDG establish a tunnel towards the EGGSN as like tunnel between HA and FA and if the EGGSN buffered the packets for the UE, then the EGGSN tunnels the buffered packets to the PDG and the PDG forwards the packets to the UE where if the UE is capable of simultaneous access, then the EGGSN starts bicasting the packets to both EUTRAN and l-WLAN access systems. After start receiving the packets from the EGGSN, the UE does MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, and if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage. If no active TCP connections were present, then<br><br>
the UE does SIP based terminal mobility procedure, and if it has any active IMS based sessions and avoids the MIP based mobility procedure the UE intimates the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm message. The HO complete message is sent within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol and if MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol and the PDG relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br>
Accordingly the invention also explains a method and a system for providing mobility between interworking WLAN and EUTRAN access systems where handover from the l-WLAN to the EUTRAN access system involves the UE start scanning the other RAT and deciding to attach with the EUMTS AS based on the signal strength of l-WLAN or by other means. If the UE is not capable of simultaneous access, then the UE intimate the PDG to buffer the packets destined to the UE through a new IKEv2 notification payload or through a signalling message like MIP buffer management mechanism where optionally UE request the PDG to close the IPsec tunnel and resources reserved for the UE and the PDG starts buffering the packets destined to the UE. The UE establish L2/RRC connection with the EUMTS network and the UE sends the RAU message or alternatively any initial L3 message after the L2 connection, including the HO preparation message containing S-bit, l-WLAN ID, NAI and the PDG IP address where the user part of the NAI contains the IMSI or pseudonym or re-authentication id. EGGSN, with the NAI resolves the AAA server serving the UE and retrieves the active AKA keys and also unused AVs from the AAA server where EGGSN updates the HSS about the new location of the UE. Optionally the HSS/AAA request the PDG to release the tunnel created for the UE, if UE is not capable of simultaneous access. EGGSN starts the integrity/ciphering using the active AKA keys and provides the temporary identities, IP address and KSI to the UE in the RAU accept message or alternatively in the response message to the initial L3 request. EGGSN establish a tunnel with the PDG and if the S bit is off then EGGSN request the PDG to forward all the packets destined to the UE and the PDG tunnels the buffered packets to the EGGSN and then EGGSN forwards to the UE where if the S-bit is on, then the PDG starts<br><br>
bicasting the packets destined to the UE. After start receiving the packets through the EGGSN, if the UE is capable of simultaneous access, then the UE close the l-WLAN tunnel and the UE does MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage. If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE does SIP based terminal mobility procedure, and if UE has any active IMS based sessions and avoid the MIP based mobility procedure then the UE intimates the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm message where if MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message and the EGGSN relays the HO complete message to the PDG.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for supporting mobility between the EUTRAN access system and the l-WLAN access system and optionally uses MIP protocol to support the mobility.<br>
The method of the invention comprises of mechanisms to move between the EUTRAN access system and the l-WLAN access system when the UE have the capability of simultaneous access and also when the UE does not have capability to access simultaneously.<br>
The invention is operated as detailed below:<br>
Handover from the EUTRAN to the l-WLAN access system<br>
1. UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the EUTRAN network. If EGGSN finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or EGGSN decides by any other mean that EUMTS RAT cannot be continued, then EGGSN/ENB can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or<br><br>
alternatively oy LZ or by some other means, the UE decides that the EUTRAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
UE directly send the HO request to the AAA sever, through EGGSN. The packet can be routed to the home AAA server by resolving the NAI. HO request message contains the S-bit, NAI, RAT type, Authentication Vectors and EGGSN IP address (included by the EGGSN) or alternatively the UE may send the measurements of l-WLAN to the EGGSN as requested by the EGGSN to scan other RATs. This measurement includes the details of the l-WLAN like WLAN ID, NAI and W-APN/s (formed by the UE according to the current ongoing application/s).<br>
Optionally EGGSN resolves IP addresses of the PDG using the W-APN(s). The HO request is sent to AAA server using NAI. The HO request sent by the EGGSN contains the NAI, RAT type, Authentication Vectors and EGGSN IP address (included by the EGGSN).<br>
AAA verifies the NAI and stores the Authentication vectors and the EGGSN IP Address (Optional). The AAA server then sends the HO accept message to the EGGSN. The AAA server may assign new IP address (the AAA server may assign multiple new IP addresses, if more than one sessions are active) to the UE and include the IP address in the HO accept message. Optionally AAA server may specify the PDG IP address in the HO accept message, for the UE to establish the tunnel.<br>
The EGGSN then sends the HO command to the UE. If the EGGSN resolves the PDG IP address/addresses, then the EGGSN includes the IP address/addresses in the HO command. If the AAA server sends the IP address to the UE in the HO accept message, then the EGGSN includes the IP address in the HO command.<br>
If S-bit is off, then the EGGSN starts buffering the packets destined to the<br><br>
UE. If S-bit is on, the EGGSN does not buffer the data destined to the UE.<br>
7.	After receiving the HO command, the UE starts the IKEv2 procedure to establish the IPsec tunnel towards the PDG. The UE may select the IP address of the PDG from the list provided by the EGGSN or UE by itself can resolve the IP addresses of the PDGs. UE uses the active keys to derive the authentication keys and send the AUTH payload, so that UE eliminates the EAP authentication procedure for IPsec tunnel establishment.<br>
8.	The UE performs the MIP like registration procedure and registers with the EGGSN. In this scenario, EGGSN have the functionality like HA and PDG have the functionality like FA, for MIPv4 like procedure. The UE use the EUTRAN IP address as the HoA, PDG IP address as the CoA and also l-WLAN assigned IP address as the Co-CoA. The MIP registration is done for FA-CoA to avoid tunnel overhead. The MIP registration message is sent to the PDG by the UE and then it is forwarded by the PDG to the appropriate EGGSN. For applications initiated by the UE in the l-WLAN, the UE may use the l-WLAN assigned IP address as the source IP address, so the UE directly contacts the correspondent node or alternatively, for the new applications initiated by the UE in the l-WLAN, the UE may use the reverse tunneling, that is the packets will be tunneled by the PDG (FA) to the EGGSN (HA), then EGGSN forwards the packets to the correspondent node.<br>
9.	AAA also uses the same active keys provided by the EGGSN to derive the tunnel authentication keys and pass it to the PDG for authentication. AAA server includes the EGGSN IP address in the Access Accept message. As AAA server stores the serving EGGSN IP address during the HO preparation procedure or alternatively AAA obtains from the HSS before updating the new information about the UE in the HSS.<br><br>
10.	Alternatively to step 8 and 9, the UE can use the AAA MIP Registration procedure to do MIP registration during the IPsec tunnel establishment procedure. Here the MIP registration authenticator is generated from the active network access keys. AAA forwards the MIP registration message to EGGSN. The EGGSN registers the UE and send the MIP ACK message to the UE via PDG.<br>
11.	After successful authentication and tunnel establishment procedure, AAA/HSS triggers the EGGSN to release the radio resources allocated to the UE, if UE is not capable of simultaneous access. If the UE is capable of simultaneous access then the UE starts EUMTS detach procedure.<br>
12.	The PDG establish a tunnel towards the EGGSN as like tunnel between HA and FA. If the EGGSN buffered the packets for the UE, then the EGGSN tunnels the buffered packets to the PDG and the PDG forwards the packets to the UE. If the UE is capable of simultaneous access, then the EGGSN starts bicasting the packets to both EUTRAN and l-WLAN access systems.<br>
13.	After start receiving the packets from the EGGSN, the UE may do MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
14.	If no active TCP connections were present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure. The UE can intimate the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm message. The HO complete message is sent within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol. If MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol. The PDG relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br><br>
Handover from the l-WLAN to the EUTRAN access system<br>
1.	Based on the signal strength of l-WLAN or by other means, the UE start scanning the other RAT and decided to attach with the EUMTS AS.<br>
2.	If the UE is not capable of simultaneous access, then the UE intimate the PDG to buffer the packets destined to it through a new IKEv2 notification payload or through some other signalling message like MIP buffer management mechanism. Optionally UE may request the PDG to close the IPsec tunnel and resources reserved for this UE. The PDG starts buffering the packets destined to the UE.<br>
3.	The UE establish L2/RRC connection with the EUMTS network. Then the UE send the RAU message or alternatively any initial L3 message after the L2 connection , including the HO preparation message containing S-bit, l-WLAN ID, NAI and the PDG IP address. The user part of the NAI contains the IMSI or pseudonym or re-authentication id.<br>
4.	EGGSN, with the NAI resolves the AAA server serving the UE and retrieves the active AKA keys and also unused AVs from the AAA server. EGGSN updates the HSS about the new location of the UE.<br>
5.	Optionally the HSS/AAA request the PDG to release the tunnel created for the UE, if UE not capable of simultaneous access.<br>
6.	EGGSN starts the integrity/ciphering using the active AKA keys and provides the temporary identities, IP address and KSI to the UE in the RAU accept message or alternatively in the response message to the initial L3 request.<br>
7.	EGGSN establish a tunnel with the PDG and if the S (simultaneous) bit is<br><br>
OTT then EGGSN request the PDG to forward all the packets destined to the UE. The PDG tunnels the buffered packets to the EGGSN and then EGGSN forwards to the UE. If the S-bit is on, then the PDG starts bicasting the packets destined to the UE.<br>
8.	After start receiving the packets through the EGGSN, if the UE is capable of simultaneous access, then the UE will close the l-WLAN tunnel. The UE may do MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
9.	If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure. The UE can intimate the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm message. If MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message.<br>
10.The EGGSN relays the HO complete message to the PDG.<br>
An illustrative Example for the operation of the invention:<br>
An illustrative example for operating the invention is given here. We consider handover between the EUTRAN and the l-WLAN for the cases when the UE is capable of simultaneous access and also when the UE is not capable of simultaneous access.<br>

derive the MSK and pass it to the PDG for authentication. AAA server<br>
includes the EGGSN IP address in the Access Accept message. As AAA<br>
server stores the serving EGGSN IP address during the HO preparation<br>
procedure or alternatively AAA obtains from the HSS before updating the<br>
new information about the UE in the HSS.<br>

12.	After start receiving the packets from the EGGSN, the UE may do MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
13.	If no active TCP connections were present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure. The UE can intimate the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm message. The HO complete message is sent within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling<br><br>
protocol. If MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol.<br>
14. The PDG relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br>

45.	A system as claimed in claim 44 wherein after start receiving the packets from the EGGSN, the UE does MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, and if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
46.	A system as claimed in claim 45 wherein if no active TCP connections were present, then the UE does SIP based terminal mobility procedure, and if it has any active IMS based sessions and avoids the MIP based mobility procedure the UE intimates the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm message.<br>
47.	A system as claimed in claim 46 wherein the HO complete message is sent within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol and if MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message within the IKEv2 or with any new signaling protocol and the PDG relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br>
48.	A system for providing mobility between interworking WLAN and EUTRAN access systems where handover from the l-WLAN to the EUTRAN access system involves the UE start scanning the other RAT and deciding to attach with the EUMTS AS based on the signal strength of l-WLAN or by other means.<br>
49.A system as claimed in claim 48 wherein if the UE is not capable of simultaneous access, then the UE intimate the PDG to buffer the packets destined to the UE through a new IKEv2 notification payload or through a signalling message like MIP buffer management mechanism where optionally UE request the PDG to close the IPsec tunnel and resources reserved for the UE and the PDG starts buffering the packets destined to the UE.<br>
50. A system as claimed in claim 49 wherein the UE establish L2/RRC connection with the EUMTS network and the UE sends the RAU message or alternatively any initial L3 message after the L2 connection, including the HO preparation message containing S-bit, l-WLAN ID, NAI and the PDG IP address where the<br><br>
user part of the NAI contains the IMSI or pseudonym or re-authentication id.<br>
51.	A system as claimed in claim 50 wherein EGGSN, with the NAI resolves the AAA server serving the UE and retrieves the active AKA keys and also unused AVs from the AAA server where EGGSN updates the HSS about the new location of the UE.<br>
52.	A system as claimed in claim 51 wherein Optionally the HSS/AAA request the PDG to release the tunnel created for the UE, if UE is not capable of simultaneous access.<br>
53.	A system as claimed in claim 52 wherein EGGSN starts the integrity/ciphering using the active AKA keys and provides the temporary identities, IP address and KSI to the UE in the RAU accept message or alternatively in the response message to the initial L3 request.<br>
54.	A system as claimed in claim 53 wherein EGGSN establish a tunnel with the PDG and if the S bit is off then EGGSN request the PDG to forward all the packets destined to the UE and the PDG tunnels the buffered packets to the EGGSN and then EGGSN forwards to the UE where if the S-bit is on, then the PDG starts bicasting the packets destined to the UE.<br>
55.	A system as claimed in claim 54 wherein after start receiving the packets through the EGGSN, if the UE is capable of simultaneous access, then the UE close the l-WLAN tunnel and the UE does MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
56.	A system as claimed in claim 55 wherein if no active TCP connections are present, then the UE does SIP based terminal mobility procedure, and if UE has any active IMS based sessions and avoid the MIP based mobility procedure then the UE intimates the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO confirm<br><br>
message where if MIP based solution is used then the UE just confirms the HO by sending the HO complete message and the EGGSN relays the HO complete message to the PDG.<br>
57.	A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said method includes solutions for<br>
the UE.which is capable of simultaneous and non-simultaneous access.<br>
58.	A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said method includes to provide signaling interface between the EGGSN and the AAA server to exchange messages between them.<br>
59.	A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said method includes to send the IP address of the EGGSN stored by the AAA server to the PDG during the tunnel establishment procedure. Using the EGGSN IP address, PDG contacts the serving EGGSN to retrieve the buffered packet at the EGGSN destined to the UE.<br>
60.	A method for providing mobility between interworking WLAN and EUTRAN<br>
access systems substantially described particularly with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
61.	A system for providing mobility between interworking WLAN and EUTRAN<br>
access systems substantially described particularly with reference to the<br>
