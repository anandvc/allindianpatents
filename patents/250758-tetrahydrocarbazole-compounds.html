				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Liver-X-Receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.<br>
The LXRs are activated by endogenous oxysterols and regulate the transcription of<br>
genes controlling multiple metabolic pathways. Two subtypes, LXRa and LXR|3, have<br>
been described (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995, 9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad<br>
Sci USA.1994, 91:10809-13). LXRp is ubiquitously expressed, while LXRa is<br>
predominantly expressed in cholesterol metabolizing tissues such as the liver, adipose,<br>
intestine and macrophage. The LXRs modulate a variety of physiological responses<br>
including regulation of cholesterol absorption, cholesterol elimination (bile acid<br>
synthesis), and transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues via plasma lipoproteins<br>
to the liver. The LXRs are also involved in glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism<br>
in the brain, cell differentiation, and inflammation.<br>
At present, approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low<br>
concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The<br>
atheroprotective function of HDL was first highlighted almost 25 years ago and<br>
stimulated exploration of the genetic and environmental factors that influence HDL-C<br>
levels (Miller NE., Lipids 1978,13:914-9). The protective function of HDL derives<br>
from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the<br>
removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues, including macrophage foam<br>
cells in the atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL delivers its cholesterol to<br>
the liver and sterol-metabolizing organs for conversion to bile and elimination in feces.<br>
Studies have shown that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery disease risk<br>
independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (Gordon et al., Am<br>
JMed. 1977, 62:707-14).<br>
At present, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence among Americans age 20 and older<br>
who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and 5.7 % (females). A<br>
substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with niacin in various<br>
formulations. However, the substantial unfavorable side-effects limit the therapeutic<br>
potential of this approach.<br>
It has been observed that as many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic<br>
patients in the United States are overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2<br>
diabetic patients have abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. Studies have shown<br>
that the prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and 44% in<br>
women. The rates for LDL-C &gt; 160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, and for HDL-C 
mg/dl are 28% and 11%, in diabetic men and women respectively. Diabetes is a disease<br>
in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is decreased because of<br>
partial impairment in response to the action of insulin. Type II diabetes (T2D) is also<br>
called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and has been shown to afflict<br>
80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries. In T2D, the pancreatic Islets of<br>
Langerhans continue to produce insulin. However, the target organs for insulin action,<br>
mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin<br>
stimulation. The body continues to compensate by producing unphysiologically high<br>
levels of insulin, which ultimately decreases in the later stages of the disease, due to<br>
exhaustion and failure of pancreatic insulin-producing capacity. Thus, T2D is a<br>
cardiovascular-metabolic syndrome associated with multiple co-morbidities, including<br>
insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and<br>
inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
The first line of treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes at present generally involves a<br>
low-fat and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be<br>
moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic deficiencies<br>
becomes necessary with lipid-modulating agents such as statins and fibrates for<br>
dyslipidemia, and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin<br>
sensitizers of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists, for insulin<br>
resistance. Recent studies provide evidence that modulators of LXRs would result in<br>
compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, and as such, modulators of LXRs<br>
should improve the plasma lipid profile, and raise HDL-C levels (Lund et al.,<br>
Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 2003, 23:1169-77). LXRs are also known to control<br>
the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage foam cell of the atherosclerotic lesion,<br>
and agonists of LXRs have been shown to be atheroprotective (Joseph and Tontonoz,<br>
Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003, 3:192-7). Thus, modulators of LXRs would be effective<br>
treatments for the atherosclerotic disease which underlies the cardiovascular morbidity<br>
and mortality of stroke and heart disease. Recent observations also suggest that there is<br>
an independent LXR mediated effect on insulin-sensitization in addition to its role in<br>
atheroprotection (Cao et al., J Biol Chem. 2003, 278:1131-6). Thus LXR modulators<br>
can also show superior therapeutic efficacy on HDL-raising and atheroprotection, with<br>
additional effects on diabetes, compared to current therapies.<br>

treatment or prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXRa and/or LXRp<br>
agonists. The invention further relates to processes for the preparation of the<br>

The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the<br>
methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction<br>
conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods<br>
analogous to the methods given below or in the examples or by methods known in the<br>
art. In case it is not otherwise indicated all substituents mentioned in Schemes 1, 2a, 2b,<br>
3, 4, 5, and 6 are defined as before. Substituent R2 means hydrogen and is therefore not<br>
always mentioned.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be prepared by the following Reaction Scheme 1:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R3, R4, R5, X, k, and n have the signifigances given above. R means<br>
hydrogen and is therefore not mentioned in formula (I).<br>
Michael addition of a sulfonyl derivative 2 to a cyclic 2-enone 1, at RT in MeOH<br>
ontaining 10-20% of NaOMe or in THF or acetonitrile in the presence of bases such as<br>
K/2COs or CS2CO3 , leads to the corresponding 3-substituted cyclic ketone 3 (step a).<br>
The alkylation of 3 may be carried out with NaH in DMF at 0°C followed by the<br>
addition of the electrophile R3-X (Mel, N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide for example) to<br>
give 4 as a racemic mixture of diastereomers (step b). The two diastereomers (RS,SR)<br>
and (RR,SS) may be separated by column chromatography on silica gel at this stage. A<br>
modified Fischer-Indole synthesis is used to prepare compounds of formula (I).<br>
Reaction of the ketone 3 or 4 with the aryl hydrazine (substituted aryl hydrazine) in<br>
pure acetic acid between RT and 40°C for k=l, and between RT and 75°C for k= 0, and<br>
at around 120°C in a sealed tube for heteroaryl hydrazines leads to compounds of<br>
formula (1) (step c).<br>
Functional groups present on R1 and R4 can be be transformed into other functional<br>
groups at this stage of the synthesis using standard procedures commonly known to<br>
those of the art. Typical examples are the replacement of an iodo- or bromo-substituent<br>
by an amino group using Buchwald coupling conditions or replacement of a iodo- or<br>
bromo-substituent by a 1-alkynylo-group using Sonogashira coupling conditions. These<br>
alkynyl moieties can be further modified to alkyl residues by hydrogentation.<br>
Functional groups present on R5 may be converted to other residues by formations<br>
listed for R1 and R4 or by conversion of an alkoxycarbonyl group into a carboxyl group<br>
by hydrolysis in presence of LiOH or NaOH, of a carboxyl group into a aminocarbonyl<br>
group using a primary or secondary amine and a peptide coupling reagent such as e.g.<br>
EDCI, of an alkoxycarbonyl group into a hydroxyalkyl residue by reduction with<br>
LiAlH4, or of an hydroxyalkyl residue into an ether moiety by alkylation. If required the<br>
nitrogen of the tetrahydrocarbazoles, l,2,3,3a,4,8b-tetrahydro-cyclopenta[b]indoles and<br>
related heterocycles may be BOC- or Z-protected prior to these transformations.<br>
For the preparation of the sulfonyl derivatives 2 needed for the Michael-Addition in<br>
Scheme 1 the following 2 different synthetic routes may be used. Scheme 2a describes<br>
the synthesis of the sulfonyl derivatives starting with the alkylation of thiols 1 with an<br>
electrophile of formula 2 in the presence of a base to give the sulfides 3. The preferred<br>
bases are either KaCOs using acetone as solvent or NaH in DMF (step a). The sulfides 3<br>
are subsequently oxidized to the corresponding sulfonyl derivatives 4 with either oxone<br>
(potassium peroxymonosulfate) in MeOH at RT over night, or with mCPBA. in CHCb<br>
or CH2C12 at RT (step b).<br>
An alternative route to the sulfon derivatives is depicted in scheme 2b. The sulfinic acid<br>
sodium salt 5, either commercially available or prepared from the corresponding<br>
sulfinic acid and a base, may be treated with the electrophile 6 to afford sulfon<br>
derivatives 4 (e.g. Y.Nagao, S.Yamada, E. Fujita, Tet. Lett. 1983, 2291-2294).<br>
If it is desired to produce compounds of formula I wherein the sulfonyl derivatives bear<br>
a R5 substituted [l,3,4]-oxadiazole moiety, the process depicted in Scheme 3 may be<br>
used. Addition of hydrazine hydrate to the ester 1 (prepared as described in Scheme 2a,<br>
for R5 = X-CH2-(CH2)mCO2Me) in MeOH at RT leads to the hydrazide 2 (step a). The<br>
hydrazide 2 is acylated with acetic anhydride in acetic acid to the intermediate of<br>
formula 3 (step b), which is cyclised with POCb in acetonitrile to 4 (step c).<br>
Alternatively, the oxadiazole 4 may be prepared by treatment of the hydrazide 2 in<br>
POC13 in the presence of a carboxylic acid R53-(CH2)V-COOH at reflux (route d). An<br>
additional mode of preparation of derivatives 4 is the treatment of the hydrazide 2 in<br>
trimethyl orthoformate with POC13.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The preparation of sulfonyl derivatives with a substituted [l,2,4]-oxadiazole moiety is<br>
depicted in Scheme 4 below (compounds 5). Treatment of nitrile derivatives 1 with<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride and NaOMe in MeOH at RT leads to aminohydroxyimino<br>
derivatives 2 (step a), which are converted into the oxadiazoles 4 by<br>
reaction with compound 3 using one of the following methods (step b):<br>
Method A) After treatment of 2 with NaH in THF at RT, the ester 3 is added and the<br>
reaction mixture is then stirred at 60°C for 2 hours.<br>
Method B) Alternatively, 2 is treated at RT in THF with 3 (for X= Cl) for 2 hours. After<br>
evaporation of the solvent, the mixture is refluxed in dioxane over night in the presence<br>
of molecular sieves.<br>
The resulting sulfides 4 are oxidized to the sulfonyl derivatives of formula 5 with<br>
wCPBA at RT in CHC13 (step c).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
he preparation of compound of general formula (I) with R5 being a tertiary amide is<br>
shown e.g. in Scheme 5. Esters of type 1 (prepared using the procedure described<br>
above) are converted to secondary amides 2 by reaction with a primary amine and KCN<br>
in a sealed tube (step a). Boc-protection using (BochO, DMAP, EtsN, CFbCb at RT<br>
leads to compounds 3 (step b), which are alkylated via deprotonation with NaH in THF<br>
and subsequent treatment with a range of electrophiles. TFA mediated deprotection in<br>
CH2C12 leads to the final compounds 4 (step c).<br>
Scheme 5<br>
alkyl isprefereebly methyl or ethyl<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds<br>
of formula (I) and their salts.<br>
Functional groups present on R4 or R53 can - if desired or required - be transformed<br>
into other functional groups at a suitable stage of the synthesis using standard<br>
procedures commonly known to those of the art. Typical examples are the<br>
transformation of an alkoxycarbonyl group into a carboxyl group by hydrolysis in<br>
presence of LiOH, of a carboxyl group into a aminocarbonyl group using a primary or<br>
secondary amine and a peptide coupling reagent such as e.g. EDCI, replacement of a<br>
iodo- or bromo-substituent by an amino group using Buchwald coupling conditions or<br>
replacement of a iodo- or bromo-substituent by a 1-alkynylo-group using Sonogashira<br>
coupling conditions. If required the nitrogen of the tetrahydrocarbazoles, l,2,3,3a,4,8btetrahydro-<br>
cyclopenta[b]indoles and related heterocycles may be BOC- or Z-protected<br>
prior to these transformations.<br>

Mammalian expression vectors were constructed to express full-length human LXRa<br>
and LXRp. Bacterial expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-stransferase<br>
(GST) fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of human LXRa (aa 164<br>
to 447) and human LXRp (aa 155 to 460). To accomplish this, the portions of the<br>
sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from full-length clones by PCR and then<br>
subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence<br>
analysis (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995, 9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad Sc.i<br>
USA.1994, 91:10809-13).<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in<br>
E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
LXRa and LXRp receptor binding were assayed in buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES,<br>
pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. For each 96-well reaction, 500 ng of GST-LXRa-<br>
LBD or 700 ng of GST-LXRP-LBD fusion proteins were bound to 80 u.g or 40 ng SPA<br>
beads (Pharmacia Amersham) respectively, in a final volume of 50 |j,l by shaking. The<br>
resulting slurry was incubated for 1 h at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300 X g. The<br>
supernatant containing unbound protein was removed, and the semi-dry pellet<br>
containing the receptor-coated beads was re-suspended in 50 ^1 of buffer. Radioligand<br>
(eg. 100,000 dpm of (A^-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-A^-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-l-hydroxy-ltrifluoromethylethyl)-<br>
phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide)) was added, and the reaction<br>
incubated at RT for 1 h in the presence of test compounds, and then scintillation<br>
proximity counting was performed. All binding assays were performed in 96-well plates<br>
and the amount of bound ligand was measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates<br>
(Packard). Dose response curves were performed within a range of concentration from<br>
10-10Mto 10-4M- 4<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium<br>
containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%O2:5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6-<br>
well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the fulllength-<br>
LXRa or full-length-LXRp expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid<br>
expressing luceriferase under the control of LXR response elements . Transfection was<br>
accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to<br>
the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by<br>
trypsinization and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours<br>
to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 jal of<br>
phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO<br>
concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances,<br>
50 (al of the supernatant was discarded and then 50 ul of Luciferase Constant-Light<br>
Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to lyse the cells and initiate the<br>
luciferase reaction. Luminescence, as a measure of luciferase activity, was detected in a<br>
Packard TopCount. Transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was<br>
expressed as fold-change in luminescence compared to that of cells incubated in the<br>
absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID<br>
Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The compounds according to formula (I) have an activity in at least one of the above<br>
assays (EC50 or IC50) of 0.1 nM to 100 uM, preferably 0.1 nM to luM. (uM means<br>
micromolar).<br>
For example, the following compounds exhibited the following IC50 values in the<br>

The compounds of formula I and/or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and/or<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can<br>
be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets,<br>
dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally,<br>
e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or<br>
infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral<br>
administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which<br>
will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of<br>
ormula I and/or their pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts, optionally in combination with<br>
other therapeutical ly valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together<br>
with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier<br>
materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic<br>
carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc,<br>
stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets,<br>
dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules<br>
are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols<br>
(depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be<br>
required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the<br>
production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert<br>
sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example,<br>
water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for<br>
suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or<br>
liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semisynthetic<br>
and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins,<br>
liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving<br>
agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer<br>
substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into<br>
consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on<br>
the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the<br>
mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in<br>
each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially<br>
about 1 to 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and<br>
the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or<br>
several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-<br>
100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
