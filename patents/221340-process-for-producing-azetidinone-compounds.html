Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing an azetidinone compound that is a key intermediate for synthesis of carbapenem type compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br><br>
(wherein R represents an alkyl group, a benzyl group that may have a substituent, or an aryl group that may have a substituent),<br>
which is a key intermediate for synthesis of an azetidinone compound having a p-methyl group at the V position of the 4-position-side chain usable for producing a lp-methylcarbapenem derivative which is important as an antibacterial agent, include a production method represented by the following reaction scheme 1:<br><br><br><br><br>
However, all these production methods have the following disadvantages respectively, thereby it cannot be said that they are fully satisfactory.<br>
Thus, the methods of the reaction schemes 1 to 3 use expensive starting materials and comprise many steps to need complicated operations, thereby being undesirable in terms not only of yield but also of costs.<br>
Further, the method of the reaction scheme 4 comprises relatively fewer steps for the production, however, the method inevitably uses an unstable silyl enol ether, thereby it is hard to say that the method is industrially useful and economic.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the above-described problems of the conventional methods, thereby providing a method for selectively obtaining a desired intermediate having a methyl group at the l'-P-position for synthesis of a carbapenem-type antibacterial agent under a mild condition in high yield by a simple process.<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a compound represented by the following general formula [1]:<br><br><br>
1	0	"X<br>
wherein R1, Rz, R\ and X are as defined below, characterized in that a compound represented by the following general formula [2]:<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxy-protecting group, and L represents a leaving group, is reacted with a compound represented by the following general formula [3]: <br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R3 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a phenyl group which may have a substituent, an aralkyl group having 7 to 15 carbon atoms which may have a substituent, or a 5- to 8-membered alicyclic group which may have a substituent, and X represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, in the presence of a base and a metal compound represented by the following general formula [4]:<br><br>
MYn(R4)m	[4]<br>
wherein M represents a metal atom, Y represents a halogen atom, R4 represents a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenoxy group which may have a substituent, an alkylsulfonyldioxy group, an arylsulfonyldioxy group, an alkylsulfonyloxy group, an arylsulfonyloxy group, a cyclopentadienyl group, or a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group, and n and m represent an integer of 0 to 4, the sum of n and m being the atomic valence of M.<br>
Thus, as a result of intense research in view of the above object, the inventors have found that a desired azetidinone compound [1] having a l'-p-configuration can be selectively produced in high yield only by reacting a compound represented by the general formula [2] and a diazo compound represented by the general formula [3] in the &gt; presence of a particular metal compound and a base, and thereby the invention has been accomplished.<br>
The invention provides a method for selectively producing a desired azetidinone compound having a l'-p-configuration under a mild condition in high yield by a simple process of only reacting the compound represented by the general formula [2] with the diazo compound represented by the general formula [3] in the presence of the particular metal compound and the base without converting the diazo compound into a silyl enol ether.<br>
