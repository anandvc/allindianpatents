				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF DIPHENIC ACID<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process of synthesis of diphenic acid. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a process of synthesis of diphenic acid<br>
from phenanthrene. The invention finds its usage in production of high temperature<br>
heat resistant resins, engineering plastics, liquid crystalline polymers,<br>
Pharmaceuticals, agro-chemical industries etc. This method produces an acceptable<br>
poly-(amide-imide) resin with adequate thermal stability having good impact<br>
resistance, tensile strength or elongation properties and can be drawn as long fibres.<br>
Diphenic acid residues act as chain terminators on reaction with the aromatic diamine.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Next to naphthalene, phenanthrene is the second largest component of high<br>
temperature coal tar. It is concentrated in anthracene oil fraction (300-360°C) of coal<br>
tar distillation. It constitutes 30-40% of the crude anthracene cake obtaineed from<br>
anthracene oil by cooling and cetrifuging. After recrystalisation of anthracene residue,<br>
phenanthrene is recovered from the filtrate by solvent extraction and/or fractional<br>
distillation. Phenanthrene and its derivatives, particularly 9:10-Phenanthraquinone,<br>
2,2'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (Diphenic acid) and 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid are<br>
in growing demand in the world market (annual growth rate 15%) due to their<br>
excellent performance in many newly developed applications, such as production of<br>
high temperature heat resistant resins, engineering plastics, liquid crystalline<br>
polymers, pharmaceuticals and agro-chemical industries etc.<br>
Reference is made to US Patent 4,352,922 wherein basic chemistry of<br>
phenanthrene-derived poly-(amide-imide) resins is described. Although this method<br>
produces an acceptable poly-(amide-imide) resin with adequate thermal stability, the<br>
resin does not have very good impact resistance, tensile strength or elongation<br>
properties and cannot be drawn as long fibres. It is thought that the deficiencies in the<br>
physical properties of the resin are due to the low molecular weight of the<br>
phenanthrene / formaldehyde reaction product and the presence therein of many<br>
oligomers of phenanthrene having terminal moieties linked to the chain at either the 9<br>
or 10 position. On oxidation, such a reaction product will give rise to diphenic acid<br>
residues which will act as chain terminators on reaction with the aromatic diamine. R.<br>
Behrend, Zeit. Phys. Chem., 1892, 9, p. 405; 10, p. 265 describes oxidation of<br>
phenanthrene by reacting alcoholic solution of phenanthrene with chromic acid, first<br>
to phenanthre-4uinone, and then to diphenic acid but the yield and purity are poor.<br>
Reference made to US Patent 4,373,089 wherein phenanthrene is converted to its 9, 10 diol derivative via 9, 10 phenanthraquinone. The phenanthrene is oxidised by a mild oxidising agent, such as potassium dichromate, to produce the phenanthraquinone which is reduced to the 9, 10 phenanthrene diol by a mild reducing agent, such as sulphur dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is a convenient reducing agent because it is possible to bubble it through a solution of the phenanthraquinone to produce the 9, 10, diol derivative. The derivative can be protected from reoxidation by a blanket of an inert gas such as nitrogen. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a polyimide resin comprising the condensation product of a reaction between an aromatic diamine and a polycarboxylated product formed by reacting the 9, 10-diol derivative of a phenanthrene with formaldehyde and oxidising the reaction product to produce keto groups bridging the diphenic acid moieties produced. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there are provided intermediates in the formation of a polyimide resin comprising firstly the reaction product of a 9, 10-diol derivative of a phenanthrene with formaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst, and secondly the reaction product which has been oxidised to produce keto groups bridging the diphenic acid moieties produced.<br>
Prior art search for production of diphenic acid was done based on literature survey and patent databases and did not yield any relevant references. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a process of synthesis of diphenic acid from phenanthrene which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to obtain 99% pure diphenic acid.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of diphenic acid which is simple and eco-friendly.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the synthesis of diphenic acid which is economical. Summary of the invention<br>

(iv)     distilling the resulting mixture under reduced pressure to make the volume half,<br>
(v)      cooling the mixture till diphenic acid crystalises out,<br>
(vi)     filtering the cooled mixture and boiling the residue after adding 10% solution of sodium carbonate and activated charcoal,<br>

a reactor at a temperature in the range of 75 to 85°C, (ii) adding drop-wise of 30% hydrogen peroxide in an amount in the range of 100 to<br>
300 ml, for a time period in the range of 30 to 60 minutes, (iii)     heating the resulting mixture after completion of drop wise addition of<br>
hydrogen peroxide, (iv)     distilling the resulting mixture under reduced pressure to make the volume<br>
half, (v)       cooling the mixture till diphenic acid crystalises out, (vi)     filtering the cooled mixture and boiling the residue after adding 10% solution<br>
of sodium carbonate and activated charcoal, (vii)     filtering and discarding the residue; (viii)   acidifying the filtrate with hydrogen chloride; (ix)      cooling the resultant mixture till more diphenic acid crystallises out; (x)      repeating filtration till pure diphenic acid is obtained.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the heating in step (iii) is done for a time period in the range of 3 to 7 hours.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the residue in step (vi) is boiled at 100°C after adding 10% solution of sodium carbonate and activated charcoal for decolouration.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the acid is added to maintain the pH of the mixture in the range of 3 to 4.5.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the purity of diphenic acid produced is 99%.<br>

mass is allowed to cool. On cooling, considerable amount of diphenic acid crystalises<br>
out.<br>
The cooled mixture is filtered and the residue is boiled at 100°C after addition<br>
of 10% solution of sodium carbonate and activated charcoal ( for decolouration) and<br>
subjected to filtration after which the residue is discarded and the filtrate is acidified<br>
with hydrogen chloride to maintain the pH at 4.5 and cooled where diphenic acid<br>
crystallises out. This process is repeated several times till pure diphenic acid is<br>
obtained having melting point at 228 - 229°C.<br>
The phenanthrene and glacial acetic acid added are preferably in a ratio of 1:<br>
10 (w/w). It is observed that the purity of diphenic acid produced is about 99%.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in slow and controlled oxidation<br>
of phenanthrene (drop wise addition of the oxidising agent at a specific temperature<br>
range and a specific time range, which was unknown in the prior art). This method<br>
produces an acceptable poly-(amide-imide) resin with adequate thermal stability<br>
having good impact resistance, tensile strength or elongation properties and which can<br>
be drawn as long fibres. Diphenic acid residues act as chain terminators on reaction<br>
with the aromatic diamine. The method of the invention can be used in many newly<br>
developed field of applications e.g. production of heat resistant resins, engineering<br>
plastics, liquid crystalline polymers, Pharmaceuticals, agro-chemical industries etc.<br>
from phenanthrene, which was otherwise unutilised due to cost factors. The present<br>
process was proved to enhance the yield of diphenic acid drastically.<br>

together in a reactor and heated up to 85°C. To the resulting mixture, 100 ml of 30%<br>
hydrogen peroxide solution is added drop wise, which normally takes 40 minutes.<br>
After completion of addition of hydrogen peroxide solution, the temperature of 85°C<br>
is further maintained for a time period of 6 hours. The resulting mixture is subjected<br>
to distillation, under reduced pressure, to make the volume half and the mass is<br>

The cooled mixture is filtered and the residue is boiled at 100°C after addition of 10%<br>
solution of sodium carbonate and activated charcoal (for decolouration) and subjected<br>
to filtration after which the residue is discarded and the filtrate is acidified with<br>
hydrogen chloride to maintain the pH at 4.5 and cooled where diphenic acid<br>

peroxide solution is added drop wise, which normally takes 40 minutes. After<br>
completion of addition of hydrogen peroxide solution, the temperature of 85°C is<br>
further maintained for a time period 6 hours. The resulting mixture is subjected to<br>
distillation, under reduced pressure, to make the volume half and the mass is allowed<br>

to maintain the pH at 4.5 and cooled where diphenic acid crystallises out. This process<br>
is repeated several times till pure diphenic acid is obtained having melting point at<br>
229°C. The yield obtained was 17 grams.<br>
ExampIe-3<br>
25 grams Phenanthrene and 253,grams of glacial acetic acid are added<br>
together in a reactor and heated up to 85°C. To the resulting mixture, 88 ml of 30%<br>
hydrogen peroxide solution is added drop wise, which normally takes 30 minutes.<br>
After completion of addition of hydrogen peroxide solution, the temperature of 80°C<br>
is further maintained for a time period of 3.5 hours. The resulting mixture is subjected<br>
to distillation, under reduced pressure, to make the volume half and the mass is<br>
allowed to cool. On cooling, considerable amount of diphenic acid crystalises out.<br>
The cooled mixture is filtered and the residue is boiled at 100°C after addition of 10%<br>
