				<td>Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for enhancing the signaling<br>
between a mobile communication device and a network. Specifically, the present<br>
invention is directed to a method and apparatus for providing new configurations for<br>
transmitting control information between a mobile terminal, for example user<br>
equipment (UE), and a radio network controller (RNC) using a common control<br>
channel (CCCH) logical channel / transport channel.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a European-type, third<br>
generation IMT-2000 mobile communication system that has evolved from a European<br>
standard known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). UMTS is<br>
intended to provide an improved mobile communication service based upon a GSM<br>
core network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless<br>
connection technology.<br>
[3]	In December 1998, the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the T1 of the<br>
United States, and the TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project<br>
(3GPP). The 3GPP creates detailed specifications of UMTS technology.<br>
[4]	In order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of the UMTS, five<br>
technical specification groups (TSG) have been created within the 3GPP for stan-<br>
dardizing the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network elements<br>
and their operations. Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard spec-<br>
ification within a related region. Among these groups, the radio access network (RAN)<br>
group (TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, requirements, and<br>
interface of the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio<br>
access network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[5]	A conventional UMTS network structure 1 is illustrated in FIG. 1. One mobile<br>
terminal 2, or user equipment (UE), is connected to a core network 4 through a UMTS<br>
terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) 6. The UTRAN 6 configures, maintains, and<br>
manages a radio access bearer for communications between the UE 2 and core network<br>
4 to meet end-to-end quality-of-service requirements.<br>
[6]	The UTRAN 6 consists of at least one radio network subsystem 8, including one<br>
RNC 10 acting as an access point to the core network 4, and at least one Node B 12<br><br>
managed by a corresponding RNC. The RNCs 10 are logically classified as controlling<br>
RNCs, which allocate and manage common radio resources for a plurality of UEs 2 of<br>
a cell, and serving RNCs, which allocate and manage dedicated radio resources for a<br>
specific UE 2 of a cell. Each Node B 12 manages at least one cell.<br>
[7]	The core network 4 may be divided according to the type of service provided,<br>
namely, a circuit-switched (CS) domain and a packet-switched (PS) domain. For<br>
example, a general voice conversation service is a circuit switched (CS) service, while<br>
a Web browsing service via an Internet connection is classified as a packet switched<br>
(PS) service.<br>
[8]	The CS domain includes a mobile switching center (MSC) 14 acting as an access<br>
point to the UTRAN 6 and a gateway mobile switching center (GMSC) 16 acting as an<br>
access point to an external network. The PS domain includes a serving GPRS support<br>
node (SGSN) 18 acting as an access point to the UTRAN 6 and a gateway GPRS<br>
support node (GGSN) 20 acting as an access point to the external network. A visitor<br>
location register (VLR) 22 and a home location register (HLR) 24 manage user reg-<br>
istration information.<br>
[9]	In the CS domain, the access point of the core network 4 is the MSC 14 via an Iu-<br>
CS interface. For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs 10 are connected to<br>
the MSC 14 of the core network 4 and the MSC is connected to the GMSC 16 that<br>
manages the connection with other networks.<br>
[10]	In the PS domain, the access point of the core network 4 is the SGSN 18 via an Iu-<br>
PS interface. For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs 10 are connected to<br>
the SGSN 18 and the GGSN 20 of the core network 4. The SGSN 18 supports the<br>
packet communications with the RNCs 10 and the GGSN 20 manages the connection<br>
with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[11]	The interface between the UE 2 and UTRAN 6 is realized through a radio interface<br>
protocol established in accordance with 3GPP radio access network specifications. The<br>
conventional architecture of the radio interface protocol is illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
[12]	As illustrated in FIG. 2, the conventional radio interface protocol has horizontal<br>
layers comprising a physical layer (L1), a data link layer (L2), and a network layer<br>
(L3), and has vertical planes comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting user<br>
data and a control plane (C-plane) for transmitting control information. The user plane<br>
is a region that handles traffic information with the user, such as voice or Internet<br>
protocol (IP) packets. The control plane is a region that handles control information for<br>
an interface with a network and maintenance and management of a call.<br>
[13]	The protocol layers may be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a<br>
third layer (L3) based on the three lower layers of an open system interconnection<br>
(OSI) standard model. The first layer (L1) is the physical layer. The second layer (L2)<br><br>
includes a medium access control (MAC) layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/ multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer.<br>
[14]	The physical (PHY) layer provides information transfer service to a higher layer by<br>
using various radio transfer techniques. The physical layer is linked via transport<br>
channels to a medium access control (MAC) layer.<br>
[15]	The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and transport channels<br>
and provides allocation of the MAC parameters for allocation and re-allocation of<br>
radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport<br>
channels and may be divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-<br>
c/sh sub-layer, and a MAC-hs sub-layer according to the type of transport channel<br>
being managed.<br>
[16]	The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer called the radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer, via a logical channel. Various logical channels are provided according to the<br>
type of information transmitted. In general, a control channel is used to transmit in-<br>
formation of the control plane and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of<br>
the user plane.<br>
[17]	A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending on<br>
whether the logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a dedicated traffic<br>
channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common traffic channel<br>
(CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control channel (BCCH),<br>
and a paging control channel (PCCH), or a Shared Channel Control Channel. The<br>
BCCH provides information including information utilized by a UE 2 to access the<br>
core network 4. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN 6 to access a UE 2. The different<br>
logical channels are listed in FIG. 3.<br>
[18]	The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a transport<br>
channel handling the broadcasting of system information. In the downlink, the MAC-<br>
c/sh sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward access channel<br>
(FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of<br>
terminals. In the uplink, the MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a Radio Access Channel<br>
(RACH). Therefore, each UE 2 has one MAC-c/sh entity.<br>
[19]	The possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from<br>
the perspective of a UE 2 is illustrated in FIG. 4. The possible mapping between the<br>
logical channels and the transport channels from the perspective of a UTRAN 6 is il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
[20]	The MAC-d sub-layer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated<br>
transport channel for a UE 2. The MAC-d sublayer is located in a serving RNC 10<br>
(SRNC) that manages a corresponding UE 2, and one MAC-d sublayer also exists in<br><br>
each UE 2.<br>
[21]	The RLC layer, depending of the RLC mode of operation, supports reliable data<br>
transmissions and performs segmentation and concatenation on a plurality of RLC<br>
service data units (SDUs) delivered from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives<br>
the RLC SDUs from the upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU<br>
in an appropriate manner based upon processing capacity and then creates data units by<br>
adding header information thereto.<br>
[22]	The data units, called protocol data units (PDUs), are transferred to the MAC layer<br>
via a logical channel. The RLC layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs<br>
and/or the RLC PDUs. The RLC services are used by service-specific protocol layers<br>
on the user plane, namely a broadcast/?multicast control (BMC) protocol and a packet<br>
data convergence protocol (PDCP), and are used by a radio resource control (RRC)<br>
layer for signaling transport on the control plane.<br>
[23]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB) message delivered from the core<br>
network 4 and enables the CB message to be broadcast to the corresponding UEs 2 in<br>
the appropriate cell. Header information, such as a message identifier, a serial number,<br>
and a coding scheme, is added to the CB message to generate a BMC message for<br>
delivery to the RLC layer.<br>
[24]	The RLC layer appends RLC header information and transmits the thus-formed<br>
message to the MAC layer via a common traffic channel as a logical channel. The<br>
MAC layer maps the common traffic channel to a forward access channel (FACH) as a<br>
transport channel. The transport channel is mapped to a secondary common control<br>
physical channel as a physical channel.<br>
[25]	The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer. The PDCP layer is used to<br>
transmit network protocol data, such as the IPv4 or IPv6, effectively on a radio<br>
interface with a relatively small bandwidth. For this purpose, the PDCP layer reduces<br>
unnecessary control information used in a wired network, a function called header<br>
compression.<br>
[26]	The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane. The RRC layer handles the control<br>
plane signaling of the network layer (L3) between the UEs 2 and the UTRAN 6 and<br>
controls the transport and physical channels for the establishment, reconfiguration, and<br>
release of radio bearers. A radio bearer is a service provided by a lower layer, such as<br>
the RLC layer or MAC layer, for data transfer between the UE 2 and UTRAN 6.<br>
[27]	The air interface (Uu) between the UE 2 and the UTRAN 6 includes the RRC layer<br>
for the establishment, reconfiguration, and release of radio bearers, for example a<br>
service providing data transfer between the UE and an RNC 10 of the UTRAN. Es-<br>
tablishment of a radio bearer determines the regulating characteristics of the protocol<br><br>
layer and channel needed to provide a specific service, thereby establishing the<br>
parameters and operational methods of the service.<br>
[28]	A UE 2 is said to be in the RRC-connected mode when the RRC layer of a UE and<br>
the RRC layer of a corresponding RNC 10 are connected, thereby providing for bi-<br>
directional transfer of RRC messages. If there is no RRC connection, the UE 2 is said<br>
to be in the RRC-idle mode.<br>
[29]	Upon power-up, a UE 2 is in the RRC-idle mode by default. When necessary, an<br>
RRC-idle UE 2 transitions to the RRC-connected mode through an RRC connection<br>
procedure.<br>
[30]	An RRC connection is established, for example, when uplink data transfer is needed<br>
to make a call or to respond to a paging message from the RNC 10. The RRC<br>
connection connects the UE 2 to the RNC 10 of the UTRAN 6.<br>
[31 ]	The different possibilities that exist for the mapping between the radio bearers and<br>
the transport channels are not all possible all the time. The UE 2 and UTRAN 6 deduce<br>
. the possible mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure that the UE and<br>
UTRAN are executing.<br>
[32]	The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. For<br>
example, the RACH transport channel is mapped on a given PRACH, the DCH may be<br>
mapped on the DPCH, the FACH and the PCH may be mapped on the S-CCPCH, and<br>
the DSCH is mapped on the PDSCH. The configuration of the physical channels is<br>
determined by RRC signaling exchange between the RNC 10 and the UE 2.<br>
[33] Because an RRC connection exists for UEs 2 in RRC connected mode, the UTRAN<br>
6 can determine the existence of a particular UE within the unit of cells, for example in<br>
which cell or set of cells the RRC connected mode UE resides, and which physical<br>
channel the UE is monitoring. Therefore, the UE 2 can be effectively controlled.<br>
[34]	In contrast, the UTRAN 6 cannot determine the existence of a UE 2 in idle mode.<br>
The existence of idle UEs 2 can only be determined by the core network 4 to be within<br>
a region that is larger than a cell, for example a location or a routing area. Therefore,<br>
the existence of idle mode UEs 2 is determined within large regions, and, in order to<br>
receive mobile communication services such as voice or data, the idle mode UE must<br>
transition into the RRC connected mode. The possible transitions between modes and<br>
states are illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
[35]	A UE 2 in RRC connected mode may be in different states, for example<br>
CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state, CELL_DCH state or URA_PCH state.<br>
Depending on the state, the UE 2 performs different actions and monitors different<br>
channels.<br>
[36]	For example a UE 2 in CELL_DCH state will attempt to monitor, among others, a<br>
DCH type of transport channel that is mapped to a certain DPCH. A UE 2 in<br><br>
CELL_FACH state will monitor several FACH transport channels that are mapped to a<br>
certain S-CCPCH. A UE 2 in CELL_PCH state will monitor the PICH channel and the<br>
PCH channel that is mapped to a certain S-CCPCH physical channel.<br>
[37]	The actions of a UE 2 are also different depending on the state. For example a UE 2<br>
is in CELLJFACH state whenever it moves from one cell into another cell and,<br>
depending on different conditions, the UE will start the CELL Update procedure by tr<br>
ansmitting a Cell Update message to the Node B 12 to indicate that the UE has<br>
changed location and will begin monitoring the FACH channel. This procedure is also<br>
performed when the UE 2 transitions from any other state to CELL_FACH state and<br>
the UE has no C-RNTI available, for example when transitioning from CELL_PCH<br>
state or CELL_DCH state, or when a UE in CELL_FACH state was previously out of a<br>
coverage area.<br>
[38]	In order to distinguish transmissions between the RNC 10 and the different UEs 2<br>
and in order to distinguish the different radio bearers that may be multiplexed in the<br>
MAC layer, the MAC includes a header in the transmissions. The logical channel type<br>
determines the type of MAC header that the UE 2 uses to transmit the message, the<br>
UMTS mode (FDD or TDD) and the transport channel to which the logical channel is<br>
mapped. This header may contain an identifier that identifies a specific UE 2.<br>
[39]	There are different identifiers used in the MAC header to distinguish transmissions<br>
to / from the different UEs 2. The RNC 10 allocates the different identifiers.<br>
[40]	Examples of identifiers are C-RNTI, U-RNTI, S-RNTI and H-RNTI. C-RNTI is<br>
used to identify a given UE 2 in a given cell. U-RNTI is used to identify a UE 2 in a<br>
given UTRAN 6 system. S-RNTI identifies the UE 2 on a DSCH transport channel. H-<br>
RNTI identifies the UE 2 on a given HSDPA transport channel.<br>
[41]	The fields that are contained in the MAC header for all transport channels except<br>
the HS-DSCH transport channel are illustrated in FIG. 7. The TCTF (Target Channel<br>
Type Field) field indicates the type of logical channel that is mapped on the given<br>
transport channel in the event different logical channels may be mapped on the<br>
transport channel. The UE-Id type is the UE 2 identifier. The C/T field indicates the<br>
radio bearer that was established.<br>
[42]	The TCTF is utilized to distinguish between the different logical channels. Dis-<br>
tinguishing between logical channels determines the exact format of the rest of the<br>
MAC header. For example, If the CCCH is mapped on RACH / FACH, the MAC<br>
header contains only the TCTF field that carries the information that the rest of the<br>
MAC PDU contains a message from a CCCH type transport channel.<br>
[43]	Presently, the UMTS standard indicates that only the signaling radio bearer 0<br>
(SRBO) may use the CCCH logical channel. Therefore there is no need for the C/T<br>
field when the CCCH logical channel is used.<br><br>
[44]	In the uplink, not all transport channels are available depending upon the state of<br>
the UE 2. For example when the UE 2 is in CELL_FACH state, the UE cannot use a<br>
DCH transport channel, but may use, for example, a RACH transport channel.<br>
[45]	For the mapping of DCCH on RACH, for example, the UE 2 must have a valid C-<br>
RNTI. However, if the UE 2 has just moved into a new cell and desires to start the Cell<br>
Update procedure, the UE does not have a valid C-RNTI. Therefore, the UE 2 may<br>
only map the CCCH logical channel on the RACH. In coding the CCCH message, an<br>
"initial Identity," which is either fixed or allocated to the UE 2 by the core network 4,<br>
or the U-RNTI is included in the message to distinguish the UE 2.<br>
[46]	The same situation exists when the UE 2 has just been powered on and wants to<br>
establish an RRC connection. Therefore, the UE 2 may only use CCCH logical channel<br>
mapped on the RACH transport channel to transmit the RRC Connection Request<br>
message.<br>
[47]	The RLC layer may use either transparent mode (TM), unacknowledged mode<br>
(UM) or acknowledged mode (AM). Depending upon the mode, the size of the RLC<br>
PDUs may change after each transmission of a transport block. In TM and UM mode,<br>
the size of the RLC PDUs may change after each transmission. In AM, the PDU size<br>
may not be changed dynamically, but only through a reconfiguration by the RNC 10,<br>
because the PDUs might be retransmitted.<br>
[48]	The transport channels may handle RLC PDUs of predefined sizes. The transport<br>
block size of the physical layer is defined by the RLC PDU size and the MAC header<br>
size. Different transport channels allow different transport block sizes and a given<br>
transport channel may also allow different sizes. Generally, the transport block sizes a<br>
UE 2 is allowed to use for a specific radio bearer are determined by the RNC 10 or<br>
fixed by the UMTS standard.<br>
[49]	A transport channel is defined by its type, for example RACH, FACH, DCH, DSCH<br>
or USCH, and by its attributes. Some attributes are dynamic and some attributes are<br>
semi-static.<br>
[50]	Dynamic attributes include the transport block size, which is the size of the MAC<br>
PDU; the transport block set size, which is the size of the MAC PDU multiplied by the<br>
number of MAC PDUs that can be transported in one transmission time interval (TTI);<br>
and the transmission time interval, which is an optional dynamic attribute for TDD<br>
only. Semi-static attributes include the transmission time interval, which is mandatory<br>
for FDD and optional for the dynamic part of TDD NRT bearers; the error protection<br>
scheme applied; the type of error protection; the turbo code; the convolutional code; no<br>
channel coding, which is semi-static for TDD only; the coding rate; the static rate<br>
matching parameter; and the size of CRC.<br>
[51]	The semi static part of an attribute may only be changed when the RRC layer<br><br>
changes the configuration. The dynamic part of an attribute provides several al-<br>
ternatives, for example that there may be one, two or three transport blocks transmitted<br>
in one TTI. Furthermore, the transport block size may be changed during each TTI.<br>
[52]	A set of values of the dynamic and the semi-static parts is called a transport format<br>
(TF). Each transport channel may use one or more transport formats. For example,<br>
only one transport channel may be mapped on the Physical Random Access Channel<br>
(PRACH), the channel to which the present invention is directed.<br>
[53]	The PRACH message includes a data portion that is generated out of the transport<br>
block set received by the MAC layer and includes control information that is generated<br>
in the Physical layer. The control information includes the transport format<br>
combination indicator (TFCI) that is used to determine the coding and the transport<br>
format that is used for the transmission. FIG. 8 illustrates the RACH message structure.<br>
[54]	When a radio bearer is mapped via a logical channel to a transport channel, not all<br>
existing transport format combinations may be used. The allowable transport format<br>
combinations are determined by the RRC protocol, as indicated by the RB mapping in-<br>
formation.<br>
[55]	Presently, the UMTS standard indicates that signaling radio bearer number 0<br>
(SRBO) is always mapped via a CCCH logical channel on the RACH transport<br>
channel. Presently, the UMTS standard also indicates that a UE2 is only allowed to use<br>
the first transport format that is listed for the selected RACH for transmission of<br>
messages via CCCH.<br>
[56] Generally, the first transport format of a RACH may. carry only one transport block<br>
of 168 bits. However, the messages that are transmitted via the CCCH may be large<br>
and, in some situations, it may be beneficial to use also other transport block sizes.<br>
[57]	The CCCH is fixed to always use TM mode in the uplink. TM mode does not<br>
support segmentation and padding. The MAC header always includes only the TCTF<br>
header, which consists of 2 bits. Therefore, the RRC message that is carried in the<br>
MAC SDU must be adapted to meet the required size of the MAC SDU.<br>
[58]	RRC messages are generated using a special coding known as ASN.l coding. FIG.<br>
9 illustrates ASN.l coding of an RRC message for CCCH.<br>
[59]	The different information elements that form the R99 part and the extension part are<br>
encoded by the means of the ASN.l to create the basic production. The encoder adds<br>
padding bits to ensure that the number of bits is a multiple of 8. In order to adapt the<br>
RRC PDU size to the size of the MAC-SDU for the CCCH messages on TM, the RRC<br>
layer adds additional padding.<br>
[60]	The CCCH logical channel is used to transmit Cell Update messages, RRC<br>
connection request messages and URA update messages in the uplink. The messages<br>
have different sizes depending upon the information that is added to the message. The<br><br>
messages also contain information on the measured results of neighboring cells, for<br>
example quality and timing information such as measured results on RACH.<br>
[61]	Conventional methods adapt the size of the messages transmitted on the CCCH<br>
logical channel so that the RLC PDU with the MAC header fits inside the transport<br>
block that is used in the RACH. A conventional method 1 for transmitting messages on<br>
the CCCH logical channel is illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
[62]	As illustrated in FIG. 10, information regarding the existing PRACH configurations<br>
is transmitted to a UE 2 (S10). Based on the existing transport PRACH configurations,<br>
the UE 2 selects the PRACH according to an algorithm (S12). The UE 2 generates a<br>
message including all information elements for transmission over the PRACH (S14).<br>
The UE 2 compares the message size with the transport block size of the first transport<br>
format of the corresponding RACH and adapts the message size by deleting<br>
measurement information until the message fits within the transport block size (S16).<br>
The UE 2 then transmits the adapted message via the PRACH (S18).<br>
[63]	In a UMTS system several PRACHs may be configured in a cell. A UE 2 in RRC-<br>
idle or RRC-connected mode reads a list of PRACH channels from the system in-<br>
formation blocks. Each PRACH channel may have a list of available transport formats.<br>
[64]	In TDD (Time Division Duplex), the TTI (Transmission Time Interval), or duration<br>
of the transmission of a transport block, of a PRACH may be different depending on<br>
the transport format. In 1.28 MCPS TDD mode, the UE 2 always selects the largest<br>
TTI of the transport formats that are suitable for transmission of the transport block set.<br>
[65]	In FDD (Frequency Division Duplex), each PRACH channel has a fixed TTI. Each<br>
transport format is characterized, among other characteristics, by a transport block size<br>
and the number of transport blocks that may be transmitted during one TTI.<br>
[66]	In order to select the PRACH, the UE 2 first must select the TTI to be applied. Once<br>
the TTI is selected, the UE 2 selects one PRACH channel randomly from the PRACHs<br>
that exist that use the selected TTI length. If PRACHs with different TTI lengths exist,<br>
the TTI length is selected according to the method 50 illustrated in FIG. 11. Otherwise,<br>
the TTI of the configured PRACHs is utilized.<br>
[67]	Referring to FIG. 11, the UE 2 selects a transport format with 10 msec. TTI based<br>
on the available transport formats in step S52. From the transport formats supported by<br>
all RACHs, those formats that have a TTI of 10 msec, and correspond to a single<br>
transport block of all configured RLC sizes are kept.<br>
[68]	For example, the RLC size applicable for RB0 is kept in RRC-idle mode and the<br>
RLC sizes configured with explicit RB mapping information are kept in RRC-<br>
connected mode. If more than a single transport format is applicable, the UE 2 may<br>
select any of the available formats.<br>
[69]	Preferably, the UE 2 selects the transport format that is intended for use by the next<br><br>
transmission. If such information is not available, the transport format corresponding<br>
to the largest configured RLC size is selected.<br>
[70]	In step S54, the UE 2 calculates the power margin by estimating the transmit power<br>
necessary to transmit a transport block set on the RACH with a given transport format.<br>
The algorithm used for this calculation is specified by the 3GPP standard and uses,<br>
among other input parameters, the TTI, the transport block size and the number of<br>
transport blocks to be transmitted.<br>
[71]	In step S56, the calculated power margin is compared to 6 dB. If the power margin<br>
is greater than 6 dB, the 10 msec. TTI is selected in step S58. If the calculated power<br>
margin is not greater than 6 db, the 20 msec. TTI is selected in step S60.<br>
[72]	If the size of a CCCH message is too large using the conventional methods 1, 50, a<br>
UE2 might completely delete the information on the measured results of neighboring<br>
cells, for example measured results on RACH, even though the quality and timing in-<br>
formation might be needed in the RNC 10. Without the quality and timing information,<br>
a connection may not be established with the RNC 10 when a UE 2 moves to another<br>
cell. The UE 2 may not be able to transmit data and a current call may be interrupted or<br>
a new call may not be initiated.<br>
[73]	Because the UMTS standard restricts a UE 2 to always use the first transport block<br>
size of the selected PRACH, there is only one transport block size available for SRB0.<br>
Therefore, the size of the messages is limited to the size of the transport block.<br>
[74]	It has been suggested to change the size of the first transport format of the PRACH.<br>
However, there is no guarantee that all mobiles terminals will support a size change of<br>
the SRB0. Therefore, as long as there are mobile terminals that do not support another<br>
transport block size used in the PRACH, messages that are transmitted via the CCCH<br>
in the uplink may not be extended in new Releases of the UMTS standard.<br>
[75]	Therefore, there is a need for a method and apparatus that conforms to a new<br>
UMTS standard that allows messages to be transmitted via the CCCH channel that are<br>
larger than the currently available transport block size, while not impacting the<br>
operation of mobile terminals that do not conform to the new UMTS standard. The<br>
present invention addresses these and other needs.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[120]	The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing new con-<br>
figurations for transmitting control information between a mobile terminal, for<br>
example user equipment (UE), and a radio network controller (RNC) using a common<br>
control channel (CCCH) logical channel / transport channel such that the operation of<br>
mobile terminals that do not support the new configurations is not impacted. Although<br>
the present invention is illustrated with respect to a mobile terminal, it is contemplated<br>
that the present invention may be utilized anytime it is desired to provide new con-<br>
figurations for transmitting control information between a mobile communication<br>
device and a network.<br>
[121]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Throughout the drawings, like elements are indicated using the same or similar<br>
reference designations.<br>
[122]	The invention proposes to use a new configuration for the transmission of the RRC<br>
messages of SRBO. The new configuration is intended to enable messages to be<br>
transmitted over the CCCH that are larger than those currently allowed for<br>
transmission. Enabling larger messages, for example messages containing additional<br>
information, to be transmitted over the CCCH may prevent essential quality and timing<br>
information, for example measured results on RACH, from being deleted from the<br>
messages sent over the CCCH. There are several ways in which a new configuration<br>
may be implemented.<br>
[123]	A first embodiment of the new configuration provides a new physical RACH<br>
channel (PRACH) which would be used only by UEs 2 that support the use of the<br>
additional PRACH. The new PRACH may be indicated utilizing the existing system<br><br>
information messages such that only UEs 2 that support the use of the new PRACH<br>
would utilize the new channel to transmit messages via the CCCH on the new PRACH.<br>
[124]	A second embodiment of the new configuration allows a UE 2 to use a different<br>
transport format on the same RACH that is presently utilized to transmit messages via<br>
the CCCH. A new logical channel may be implemented, for example an enhanced<br>
common control channel (ECCCH), which may be mapped on any transport format<br>
combination of the available RACH channels. The RNC 10 would indicate whether a<br>
UE 2 is allowed to use the enhanced CCCH, for example in an existing system in-<br>
formation message, RRC messages or any other messages transmitted from the RNC to<br>
the UE2.<br>
[125]	A third embodiment allows the mapping of the CCCH channel on other transport<br>
block sizes of the existing RACH. There would be no need to change the architecture<br>
of the UE 2 or core network 4, as only the mapping of the PRACH would be changed.<br>
[126]	According to the third embodiment, the RNC 10 may signal whether the UE 2 is<br>
allowed to map the CCCH on any PRACH and whether any PRACH transport block<br>
size or only certain PRACH transport block sizes are allowed. The RNC 10 may<br>
indicate the numbers of the entries in the list of PRACH transport block sizes that are<br>
allowed. Alternately, the mapping of the CCCH channel on any PRACH may be<br>
allowed without any indication from the RNC 10.<br>
[127]	A fourth embodiment allows a new message format to be utilized. The new<br>
message format may be adapted to include only the most necessary data. For example,<br>
the START values may be omitted in an RRC Connection Request message since the<br>
START values are also transmitted in the Initial Direct transfer message.<br>
[128]	FIG. 12 illustrates a method 100 for selecting a configuration for transmitting a<br>
message via the PRACH according to one embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
method 100 includes transmitting information indicating the available PRACH con-<br>
figurations to a UE 2 (S102), selecting one of the available PRACH configurations<br>
(S104), generating a message to be transmitted using the selected PRACH con-<br>
figuration (S106), adapting the generated message to the transport block size if<br>
necessary (S108) and transmitting the message via the PRACH (S110).<br>
[129]	In step S102, the RNC 10 transmits information to a UE 2 indicating the available<br>
PRACH configurations. The available PRACH configurations may include existing, or<br>
legacy configurations that are supported by all UEs 2 and / or predefined new, or<br>
extended, configurations that may not be supported by all UEs.<br>
[130]	The extended PRACH configurations may incorporate one or more of the four em-<br>
bodiments previously defined; a new physical RACH channel, a new logical channel<br>
such as an enhanced common control channel (ECCCH), mapping of the CCCH<br>
channel on other transport block sizes of the existing RACH, and/or a new message<br><br>
format. The indication of the available PRACH configurations may include a con-<br>
figuration mode and configuration identity for each available legacy configuration and<br>
each available predefined configuration.<br>
[131]	In step S104, the UE 2 selects one of the available PRACH configurations, for<br>
example by performing an algorithm that includes the existing PRACH configuration<br>
and the extended PRACH configurations. The selection between the existing PRACH<br>
configuration and the one or more extended PRACH configurations is based on the<br>
size of the message that is to be transmitted in order to select the PRACH con-<br>
figuration that allows a transport block size that accommodates all message data while<br>
adding a minimum amount of overhead.<br>
[132]	Preferably, the UE 2 first determines if the transport block size of the existing<br>
PRACH configurations allow inclusion of all information regarding measured results<br>
of neighboring cells, for example quality and timing information such as measured<br>
results on RACH, in the message. If the transport block sizes of the existing PRACH<br>
configurations are insufficient to allow inclusion of all information regarding measured<br>
results of neighboring cells in the message, the UE 2 selects one of the extended<br>
PRACH configurations.<br>
[133]	The UE 2 then generates a message to be transmitted including all information<br>
elements by utilizing the selected PRACH configuration in step S106. If the transport<br>
block size of the selected PRACH configuration is still insufficient to allow inclusion<br>
of all information regarding measured results of neighboring cells in the message, the<br>
UE 2 reduces the amount of information regarding measured results of neighboring<br>
cells that is included in the message in order to adapt the message size to the transport<br>
block size of the selected PRACH configuration in step S108.<br>
[134]	In FDD (Frequency Division Duplex), if the UE2 is allowed to use additional<br>
transport formats or an enhanced ECCCH, the algorithm to determine the TTI of the<br>
available PRACHs is impacted. The TTI may be selected according to the method 150<br>
in FIG. 13.<br>
[135]	Referring to FIG. 13, the UE 2 selects a transport format with 10 msec. TTI based<br>
on the available transport formats in step S152. From the transport formats supported<br>
by all extension PRACHs, those formats that have a TTI of 10 msec, and correspond to<br>
a single transport block are kept. If more than a single transport format is applicable,<br>
the UE 2 may select any of the available formats.<br>
[136]	Preferably, the UE 2 selects the transport format that is intended for use by the next<br>
transmission. For example, for RBO / CCCH, the smallest available RLC size that<br>
allows the next message to be transmitted is selected. If such information is not<br>
available or, if the largest RLC size is not large enough to accommodate the next<br>
message, the transport format corresponding to the largest configured RLC size is<br><br>
selected.<br>
[137]	In step S154, the UE 2 calculates the power margin by estimating the transmit<br>
power necessary to transmit a transport block set on the RACH with a given transport<br>
format. The algorithm used for this calculation is specified by the 3GPP standard and<br>
uses, among other input parameters, the TTI, the transport block size and the number<br>
of transport blocks to be transmitted.<br>
[138]	In step S156, the calculated power margin is compared to 6 dB. If the power margin<br>
is greater than 6 dB the 10 msec. TTI is selected in step S158. If the calculated power<br>
margin is not larger than 6 db, the 20 msec. TTI is selected in step S160.<br>
[139]	The transport format for which the power margin is calculated should then be<br>
selected to be the transport format with a TTI of 10 msec, that allows transmission of<br>
the<br>
[140]	RB0 / CCCH message. If several transport formats with a TTI of 10 msec, that<br>
allow transmission of the RB0 / CCCH message exist, the format with the smallest<br>
transport block size is selected. If no such transport format exists, the transport format<br>
with the largest transport block size with 10 msec. TTI is selected.<br>
[141]	In 1.28MCPS TDD mode, the UE 2 may select the transport format with a transport<br>
block size that is configured by explicit signaling. For SRB0 / CCCH the UE 2 may<br>
select a transport format that allows transmission of the next message for SRB0. If no<br>
such transport format exists, the transport format with the biggest size should be<br>
selected, or if several transport formats are available, the transport format with the<br>
smallest transport block size should be chosen. If several transport formats with this<br>
transport block size exist, the UE 2 should select the largest TTI from those transport<br>
formats.<br>
[142]	The method of transmitting information indicating the available PRACH con-<br>
figurations to a UE 2 must be performed in a manner such that UEs that do not support<br>
the new configurations are not impacted. The information indicating the available<br>
PRACH configurations may be transmitted to a UE 2 as an extension of the system in-<br>
formation transmitted to a plurality of UEs 2, for example as part of a broadcast<br>
message on a common channel, as illustrated in FIG. 14. On the other hand, the in-<br>
formation indicating the available PRACH configurations may be transmitted by<br>
dedicated RRC signaling on a dedicated channel as illustrated in FIG. 15.<br>
[143]	As illustrated in FIG. 14, the portion of the message that contains information<br>
available according to the current 3GPP standard may be understood by both new UEs<br>
2 that support the new configurations and legacy UEs that do not support the new con-<br>
figurations. The indication of extension information is read by new UEs 2 and ignored<br>
by legacy UEs. The extension information indicating the available PRACH con-<br>
figurations is understood only by new UEs 2 that support the new configurations.<br><br>
[144]	As illustrated in FIG. 15, the information indicating the available PRACH con-<br>
figurations is transmitted to a specific new UE 2 that supports the new configurations<br>
when a connection between a UTRAN 6 and the UE is established. The existing RRC<br>
connection setup message is utilized to indicate the available PRACH configurations.<br>
[145]	The UE 2 requests an RRC connection by transmitting an RRC connection request<br>
message to the UTRAN 6. If the RRC connection can be accomplished, the UTRAN 6<br>
transmits an RRC connection setup message to the UE 2.<br>
[146]	The RRC connection setup message includes an indication of the available PRACH<br>
configurations if the UE supports the new configurations. The indicated available<br>
PRACH configurations may include a legacy configuration, for example the existing<br>
PRACH configuration, and one or more predefined new PRACH configurations, for<br>
example any the extended PRACH configurations incorporating the four embodiments<br>
