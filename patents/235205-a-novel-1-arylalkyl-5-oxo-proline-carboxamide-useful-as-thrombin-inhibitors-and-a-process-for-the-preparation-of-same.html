				<td>The present invention relates to a novel l-arylalkyl-5-oxo-prolinamides useful as inhibitors of thrombin an enzyme important in the blood coagulation cascade. These compounds are useful in the treatment of coagulation disorders.<br>
Thrombosis and its complication, embolism are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in numerous cardio-vascular disorders including myocardial and cerebral infarction and thrombotic stroke. Thrombin (F Ha) is a trypsin like serine protease and a key enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade. Thrombin has a major role in the inhibition and propagation of fibrinogen, the natural substrate of thrombin dissolved in the blood plasma, to form fibrin, which can polymerize. Thrombin is also the main activator of platelet aggregation [ Ulrike obst etal, Helvetica Chimica Acta 83, 855 (2000); Anton E. P. Adang et al, Drugs of the Future 25(40, 369 (2000)].<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel l-arylalkyl-5-oxo-prolinamides useful as inhibitors of the enzyme Thrombin. More particularly the present invention relates to the novel l-arylalkyl-5-oxo-prolinamides. These compounds are potentially useful in the treatment of blood coagulation disorders.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel l-arylalkyl-5-oxo-prolinamides of the general formula 3 (Figure-1).<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide compounds useful in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel l-arylalkyl-5-oxo-prolinalmide of general formula 3 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, o-methoxyphenyl, o-chlorophenyl, m-bromophenyl, p-bromophenyl, p-cyanophenyl, p-methy phenyl, 2-phenyl-l-ethenyl, o,o'-dichlorophenyl and 2-phenylethyl; RI is H; R2 is selected from 4-pyridinyl methyl and N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-4-piperidinyl methyl; RjR2 together is selected from -(CH2)n-CH(CH2NHCOOtBu)-(CH2)m- [where n=l, m=3 or n=2, m=2] and -(CH2)2-N(aryl)-(CH2)2- .<br>
The process used for this invention comprises of the reaction of one mole equivalent of 1-G)-arylalkyl-5-oxo-proline of the general formula 1, R = phenyl, o-methoxyphenyl, o-chlorophenyl, m-bromophenyl, p-bromophenyl, p-cyanophenyl, p-methylphenyl, 2-phenyl-1-ethenyl, o,o'-dichlorophenyl or 2-ethylphenyl with one mole equivalent of the amine of the general formula 2 where RI = H, R2 = 4-pyridinyl methyl or N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-4-piperidinyl methyl or RiR2 = -(CH2)n-CH(CH2NHCOOtBu)-(CH2)m- [where n=l, m=3 or n=2, m=2] or -(CH2)2-N(aryl)-(CH2)2- in an aprotic solvent in the presence of a carboxylic activating or coupling agent, and a tertiary nitrogen base in the temperature range of -20°C to 40°C for a period range of 2-8 hrs. to give corresponding carboxamides of the formula 3 in the accompanying drawing and isolating the compounds by conventional methods.<br>
The compounds prepared by this invention were tested for their effect on human Thrombin (Table- 1), and they inhibited the enzyme activity by 31-90 percent at 12-56 nmol concentration. The compounds were also effective under in vivo condition and showed beneficiary effects in various anti-coagulatory screens.<br><br>
