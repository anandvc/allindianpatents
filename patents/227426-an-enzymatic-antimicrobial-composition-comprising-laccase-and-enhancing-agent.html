Conservation/preservation of paints<br>
Conservation of paint products in cans has in the art been accomplished by adding non-enzymatic organic biocides to the paints- In the context of- the invention paint is construed as a substance comprising a solid coloring matter dissolved or dispersed in a liquid vehicle such as water, organic solvent and/or oils, which when spread over a surface, dries to leave a thin colored, decorative and/or protective coating. Typically isothiazoliones, such as 5-chlor-2-methyl-4-thia-zoli-3-on, has been added to the paint as biocides to inhibit/prevent microbial growth in the paint. The method of the invention can however suitably be applied in this field, thereby solving the problem of the ever present environmental bio-hazards of using toxic organic biocides by replacing these toxic biocides with environmentally compatible enzymes. Thus the present invention provides a method for conservation of a paint comprising contacting said paint with a phenol oxidizing enzyme and an enhancing agent according to the invention.

The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples which are not in any way intended to limit :he scope of the invention as claimed."<br>
SXAMPLE 1<br>
tibacterial activity of Coprinus  peroxidase with N-hydroxyacetanilide as electron donor.<br>
The antimicrobial activity of recombinant Coprinus cinereus peroxidase (rCiP), obtained as described in WO 92/16634, at pH 6 "and pH 8 by use of N-hydroxyacetanilide as electron donor was tested.<br>
Antimicrobial activity was evaluated in 0.05 M MES-buffer (Sigma M8250) (pH 6) or 0.05 HEPES-buffer (Sigma H3375) (pH 8) ; buffers we're sterilised by filter sterilisation.<br>
The  antimicrobial  activity  was  determined  against Pseudoraonas  fluorescens  (Gram et  al.  1990,  International Journal of Food Microbiology 10: 303-316) and Staphylococcus epidermidis    (DSM 20042). Cells were grown in Tryptone Soya Broth (Oxoid CM129) at 30°C (5. epidermidis)     or 25°C (P. fluorescens) for 24 h and diluted in the MES-buffer to a final cell concentration of approximately  10* cfu/ml.  The cell suspensions were mixed with rCiP (3 POXU/ml), enhancing agent (0.2 mM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM) for 20 min at 40°C. The bactericidal activity was determined by incubation in Malthus. Detection times measured by the Malthus instrument were converted to cfu/ml by a calibration curve. Either direct or Indirect Malthus measurements were used when enumerating total survival cells (Malthus Flexi M2060, Malthus Instrument Limited). By the direct measurements, the cell metabolism was determined  by  conductance  measurements*  in  the  growth substrate. By the indirect measurements, 3 ml of growth medium was transferred to the outer chamber of the indirect Malthus cells, and 0.5 ml of sterile KOH (0.1 M) was transferred to the inner chamber. The cell suspensions were after enzyme treatment transferred to the outer chamber of the Malthus cell. As cells are growing in the outer chamber they produce CO2 which will dissolve in the KOH in the inner chamber and thereby change the conductance of the KOH. The amount of COj<br><br>
formed by the respiring cells surviving the enzyme treatment was used for estimating the number of viable cells. When the conductance change is measurable by -the Malthus, a detection time (dt) will be recorded. The dt's were converted to colony counts by use of a calibration curve relating cfu/ml to dt (Johansen et al. 1995. Journal of Applied Bacteriology 78:297-303, Johansen et al. 1997, Applied and Environmental Microbiology 63:3724-3728).<br>
No bactericidal activity of N-hydroxyacetanilide or N-hydroxyacetanilide combined with hydrogen peroxide was observed. Whereas a total kill was obtained by the combined system; N-hydroxyacetanilide, hydrogen peroxide and rCiP (see Fig 1.) , Gram-negative bacteria are in general most resistant towards combined oxidoreductase and enhancing agent systems. However, the total kill, corresponding to a cell reduction of approximately 10* CFU/ml (Colony Forming Units), was obtained at both pH 6 and 8 (Fig. 1) against the Gram-negative bacterium P.   fluorescens.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>

Antibacterial activity of Polyporus plnsitus laccase (rPpL) , obtained as described in WO 96/00290), and Coprinus cinereus laccase (rCcL), obtained as described in WO 97/08325, was determined with N-hydroxyacetanilide as enhancing agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 10145), Enterobacter aerogenes (ATCC 13048) and Enterococcus faecalis (DSM 2570) . The bactericidal activity was determined as described in Example 1, the antimicrobial activity of rPpL (1 mg/L) was evaluated at pH 6, whereas rCcL (1 mg/L) was evaluated at pH 8.<br>
Dose-Response curves for N-hydroxyacetanilide are shown when combined with rPpL (Fig. 2) or rCcL (Fig. 3). _ A significant bactericidal activity was obtained against all the<br>
test organisms, with the Gram-negative strains being the most resistant. Bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa KllCQ 10145 was obtained at N-hydroxyacetanilide concentrations above 200 /xM. When using the rPpL at pH 6, a total kill of the<br><br>
two gram-negative bacteria was obtained at high concentration of N-hydroxyacetanilide.<br>

Antibacterial activity of Coprinus cinereus peroxidase (rCiP), Polyporus pinsitus laccase (rPpL), Coprinus cinereus laccase (rCcL) and Rhizoctonia solani laccase (rRsL) (as described in WO 95/07988) was determined with different enhancing agents at pH 6 and 8 (buffers; see Example 1) . The rCiP was combined with 0.5 mM hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Antimicrobial activity of rCiP and rPpL was determined against   Pseudomonas   fluorescens   (Gram  et   al.   1990, International  Journal  of  Food  Microbiology  10:303-316), whereas antimicrobial activity of rCcL and rRsL was determined against Pseudomonas aeruginosa   (ATCC 10145).<br>
The bactericidal activity was determined as described in-example 1. The different combinations and the results are shown in Table 1. The results are shown as the reduction in living cell number. Thus, a reduction of 4 correspond to a 4 log reduction of living cells e.g. from 10* CFU/ml to 10 CFU/ml,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
