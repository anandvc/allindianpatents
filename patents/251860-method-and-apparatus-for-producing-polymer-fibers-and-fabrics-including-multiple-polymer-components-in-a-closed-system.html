BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for producing<br>
fibers and fabrics in a closed fiber spinning system, where the fibers and fabrics<br>
include a plurality of different polymer components.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A number of closed fiber spinning systems are known in the art for<br>
manufacturing spunbond fabrics having certain desirable characteristics. For<br>
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,460,500, 5,503,784, 5,571,537, 5,766,646,<br>
5,800,840, 5,814,349 and 5,820,888 all describe closed systems for producing<br>
spunbond webs of fibers. The disclosures of these patents are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entireties. In a typical closed system, filaments are<br>
spun, quenched and drawn in a common enclosed chamber or environment,<br>
such that the air or gas stream that is utilized to quench the fibers emerging<br>
from a spinneret is also utilized to draw and attenuate the fibers downstream<br>
from the quenching stage.<br>
In direct contrast to open fiber spinning systems (i.e., systems in which<br>
extruded filaments are not spun, quenched and drawn in a common chamber or<br>
environment and are typically exposed to the ambient environment during some<br>
or all of the fiber forming steps), closed systems eliminate any interference from<br>
uncontrolled and potentially detrimental air currents during fiber formation. In<br>
fact, a typical closed fiber spinning system limits exposure of extruded filaments<br>
to only desirable air or gas currents having selected temperatures during fiber<br>
formation, thus facilitating the production of very delicate and uniform fibers<br>
having desirable deniers that are difficult to obtain from a typical open fiber<br>
spinning system.<br>
One important component in any fiber spinning system is the polymer<br>
delivery system, typically referred to as the spin beam, which provides molten<br>
polymer streams at a selected metering or flow rate to the fiber spinning system<br>
for extrusion into filaments by a spinneret. One type of spin beam typically<br>
utilized and highly advantageous for spinning fibers in a closed system is<br>
commonly referred to as a "coat hanger" spin beam. This type of spin beam is<br>
typically formed by two sections, constructed of metal or other suitable material,<br>
joined together in a fluid tight relationship at facing or mating surfaces, where<br>
each mating surface has grooves etched into the surface that correspond with<br>
and mirror grooves etched in the mating surface of the other section. The<br>
grooves etched on each mating surface form a profile that resembles a<br>
triangular "coat hanger" configuration.<br>
An exploded view of a conventional "coat hanger" spin beam is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1. Spin beam 2 includes two generally rectangular halves or sections 3<br>
having a number of electric heaters 12 disposed within each section to heat<br>
polymer fluid flowing within the spin beam toward the spinneret. In operation, a<br>
molten polymer stream is directed (e.g., via a pump) into an inlet portion 4 of the<br>
"coat hanger" channel profile of spin beam 2 and travels into an upper portion of<br>
the triangular channel portion 6 of the "coat hanger" profile that is disposed<br>
below and in fluid communication with inlet portion 4. The "coat hanger"<br>
channel defined by the inlet portion and the triangular portion is formed by<br>
corresponding grooves disposed on the mating surfaces of the two spin beam<br>
sections 3. Upon entering channel 6, the molten polymer stream splits into the<br>
two diverging channel sections 7 of the triangular channel portion, where the<br>
split streams continue to travel and then converge within a horizontal channel<br>
section 8 disposed at a lower end of the "coat hanger" channel between the<br>
lower ends of the diverging channel sections. The horizontal channel section<br>
also extends longitudinally along a lower end of spin beam 2. Affixed at the<br>
lower end of the spin beam are a screen filter and plate 9 and a spinneret 10<br>
having a plurality of orifices disposed along its longitudinal dimension. The<br>
screen filter, plate and spinneret also extend longitudinally along the lower end<br>
of spin beam 2 and are aligned and in fluid communication with horizontal<br>
channel section 8. Thus, the molten polymer stream traveling into horizontal<br>
channel section 8 of the "coat hanger" channel proceeds to flow through screen<br>
filter and support plate 9 to spinneret 10, where the polymer stream is then<br>
extruded through the spinneret orifices to form a plurality of polymer filaments.<br>
The "coat hanger" channel configuration is particularly advantageous because it<br>
is simple in design and creates a substantially uniform pressure differential<br>
within the channels, resulting in a uniform delivery of the polymer stream into<br>
the horizontal channel portion of the "coat hanger" channel" and uniform<br>
extrusion of molten polymer through the spinneret orifices.<br>
While a closed fiber spinning system combined with a "coat hanger" spin<br>
beam is useful for manufacturing certain polymer fibers having desirable<br>
uniformities and deniers, the "coat hanger" spin beam encounters problems<br>
when two or more different polymer components are utilized to produce more<br>
complex fibers and spunbond webs of fibers. In particular, it is very difficult in a<br>
"coat hanger" closed system to process two or more different polymer<br>
components having different melting temperatures when manufacturing<br>
multicomponent fibers or fabrics containing multiple polymer components. For<br>
example, a bicomponent fiber consisting of two polymer components with<br>
significantly different melting points would be extremely difficult to produce<br>
utilizing a closed spinning system with a "coat hanger" spin beam (e.g., by<br>
utilizing a double "coat hanger" spin beam with "coat hanger" channels being<br>
arranged in a side-by-side manner), because the "coat hanger" spin beam<br>
would tend to be maintained at substantially the same temperature by the<br>
electrical heaters disposed in the spin beam sections. The difficulty is further<br>
exacerbated when utilizing polymer components that must be maintained at or<br>
very near their melting temperatures to avoid gelling or cross-linking of the<br>
polymers. Moreover, while the "coat hanger" systems deliver a uniform molten<br>
polymer stream to the spinneret, it is difficult to modify the metering of the<br>
molten polymer stream through the "coat hanger" spin beam to the spin pack,<br>
which is an important feature in manufacturing more complex types of fibers<br>
such as multicomponent fibers having varying geometries and/or polymer<br>
component cross-sections. Thus, the flexibility of "coat hanger" spin beams is<br>
very limited in enabling the manufacture of a wide variety of different fibers and<br>
fabrics within a closed fiber spinning system.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for producing a wide variety of fibers<br>
and fabrics including two or more polymer components in a closed fiber<br>
spinning system and with a spin beam capable of delivering molten polymer<br>
streams of two or more different polymer components for fiber production within<br>
the closed system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, in light of the above, and for other reasons that become apparent<br>
when the invention is fully described, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a closed fiber spinning system capable of producing a wide variety of<br>
single and multicomponent fibers and fabrics including different polymer<br>
components and having a desired denier and degree of uniformity.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a spin beam<br>
assembly for the closed system that is capable of delivering molten polymer<br>
streams to the spinneret of the closed system, where the molten polymer<br>
streams include at least two different polymer components having different<br>
melting temperatures.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to uniformly maintain the two<br>
different polymer components at their substantially different melting<br>
temperatures within the spin beam assembly during delivery of the molten<br>
polymer streams to the spinneret.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a plurality of<br>
metering pumps to individually control the flow rate of different molten polymer<br>
fluid streams for extrusion at the spinneret.<br>
The aforesaid objects are achieved individually and in combination, and it<br>
is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more<br>
of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached<br>
hereto.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the aforementioned difficulties<br>
associated with forming fibers and fabrics having multiple polymer components<br>
in a closed system is overcome by employing a closed fiber spinning system<br>
including a spin beam assembly that is capable of supplying a plurality of<br>
molten polymer streams to a spinneret, where at least two of the polymer<br>
streams contain different polymer components, to form multicomponent fibers or<br>
fabrics including multiple polymer components that have a suitable uniformity<br>
and denier. The spin beam includes a plurality of metering pumps to<br>
independently control the flow rates of one or more polymer streams, as well as<br>
at least two thermal control units that independently and uniformly heat the<br>
different polymer components to their appropriate melting temperatures while<br>
maintaining thermal segregation between the different polymer components.<br>
The above and still further objects, features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following<br>
definitions, descriptions and descriptive figures of specific embodiments thereof<br>
wherein like reference numerals in the various figures are utilized to designate<br>
like components. While these descriptions go into specific details of the<br>
invention, it should be understood that variations may and do exist and would<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art based on the descriptions herein.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The closed fiber spinning system of the present invention is described<br>
below with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. The terms "closed system" and "closed<br>
fiber spinning system", as used herein, refer to a fiber spinning system including<br>
an extrusion stage, a quenching stage and a drawing stage, where an air or<br>
other gas stream that is utilized to quench the fibers in the quenching stage is<br>
also utilized to draw and attenuate the fibers in the drawing stage, and the<br>
extrusion, quenching and drawing stages are performed in a common enclosed<br>
environment (e.g., a single chamber or a plurality of chambers communicating<br>
with each other). The term "fiber" as used herein includes both fibers of finite<br>
length, such as conventional staple fibers, as well as substantially continuous<br>
structures, such as filaments, unless otherwise indicated. The terms<br>
"bicomponent fiber" and "multicomponent fiber" refer to a fiber having at least<br>
two portions or segments, where at least one of the segments comprises one<br>
polymer component, and the remaining segments comprise another, different<br>
polymer component. The term "single component fiber" refers to a fiber<br>
consisting of a single polymer component. The term "mixed polymer fiber"<br>
refers to a fiber consisting of two or more different polymer components mixed<br>
together to form a substantially uniform composition of the polymer components<br>
within the formed fiber.<br>
Fibers extruded in the closed system of the present invention can have<br>
virtually any transverse cross-sectional shape, including, but not limited to:<br>
round, elliptical, ribbon shaped, dog bone shaped, and multilobal cross-<br>
sectional shapes. The fibers may comprise any one or combination of melt<br>
spinnable resins, including, but not limited to: homopolymer, copolymers,<br>
terpolymers and blends thereof of: polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters,<br>
polyactic acid, nylon, poly(trimethylene terephthalate), and elastomeric<br>
polymers such as thermoplastic grade polyurethane. Suitable polyolefins<br>
include without limitation polymers such as polyethylene (e.g., polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, linear low<br>
density polyethylene), polypropylene (isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic<br>
polypropylene, and blends of isotactic polypropylene and atactic polypropylene),<br>
poly-1-butene, poly-1-pentene, poly-1-hexene, poly-1-octene, polybutadiene,<br>
poly-1,7,-octadiene, and poly-1,4,-hexadiene, and the like, as well as<br>
copolymers, terpolymers and mixtures of thereof. In addition, the manufactured<br>
fibers may have any selected ratio of polymer components within the fibers.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a closed system 100 is depicted including a spin<br>
beam assembly 102 for delivering molten polymer streams to a spin pack 104,<br>
and an enclosed chamber 106 for forming and delivering extruded filaments 108<br>
to a web-forming belt 116, thus forming an nonwoven web of fibers 118. It is to<br>
be noted that the closed chamber design depicted in Fig. 2 is provided for<br>
exemplary purposes only, and the present invention is in no way limited to such<br>
design. For example, any number of enclosed chamber designs may be utilized<br>
in practicing the present invention, including, without limitation, the enclosed<br>
chamber designs of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,460,500, 5,503,784, 5,571,537,<br>
5,766,646, 5,800,840, 5,814,349 and 5,820,888. The spin beam assembly,<br>
spin pack, enclosed chamber and belt are constructed of metal or any other<br>
suitable material to receive and process molten polymer fluid streams.<br>
The spin beam assembly 102 provides a number of independently<br>
metered molten polymer streams to spin pack 104 for extrusion and fiber<br>
formation within closed system 100. Three separate and independent heating<br>
systems are provided in the spin beam assembly as described below to<br>
independently heat two segregated polymer fluid streams flowing into the spin<br>
beam assembly and the spin beam. Referring to Fig. 3, spin beam assembly<br>
102 includes a generally rectangular and hollow frame 103 enclosing a pair of<br>
substantially cylindrical and hollow distribution manifolds 122, 130 and a<br>
generally rectangular spin beam 140. Each distribution manifold 122, 130<br>
extends longitudinally along a rear wall 150 of the frame, with manifold 130<br>
suspended slightly above and aligned substantially parallel with manifold 122.<br>
An inlet pipe 123 extends transversely from a central location of manifold 122<br>
and through the rear wall 150 of frame 103 to connect with a polymer supply<br>
source (not shown). Similarly, another inlet pipe 131 extends transversely from<br>
a central location of manifold 130 and through an upper rear wall 151 of the<br>
frame to connect with another polymer supply source (not shown). A portion of<br>
each inlet pipe also extends within each manifold to connect with a polymer<br>
distribution pipe disposed within the manifold as described below. Manifold 122<br>
is sealed at one end and connected to a heat medium supply conduit 124 at the<br>
other end, with conduit 124 extending through a side wall 152 of frame 103 and<br>
connecting to a heat medium supply source (not shown). Manifold 130 is also<br>
sealed at an end corresponding to the sealed end of manifold 122 and is<br>
connected at the other end to another heat medium supply conduit 132<br>
extending through the side wall 152 of the frame, where the supply conduit 132<br>
is also connected to a heat medium supply source (not shown). The manifolds<br>
are slightly staggered in alignment with respect to each other, with the end of<br>
manifold 122 that is connected to conduit 124 being closer to the side wall 152<br>
of the frame than the corresponding end of manifold 130.<br>
Disposed and extending longitudinally within each distribution manifold<br>
122, 130 is a polymer distribution pipe that connects with the corresponding<br>
inlet pipe 123, 131 protruding into the manifold interior. Each manifold 122, 130<br>
basically surrounds and jackets the distribution pipe disposed therein, allowing<br>
a fluidic heat transfer medium (e.g., Dowtherm) to be delivered by the<br>
respective supply conduit 124, 132 into the manifold so as to surround and<br>
transfer heat to polymer fluid disposed within the distribution pipe. The<br>
manifolds and piping associated with the manifolds facilitate independent and<br>
segregated heating of two different polymer components to different<br>
temperatures within spin beam assembly 102. Additionally, the manifold design<br>
provides uniform heating of polymer fluid flowing inside each polymer<br>
distribution pipe within each manifold by surrounding each distribution pipe with<br>
a heat medium at a substantially uniform temperature. This heating feature is a<br>
significant improvement over the electric heating design provided in the "coat<br>
hanger" style spin beam, because the electrical heaters in the "coat hanger"<br>
spin beam may yield undesirable thermal gradients within the spin beam<br>
sections.<br>
Each distribution manifold 122, 130 further includes a set of six polymer<br>
transfer pipes 126, 134 extending transversely and at approximately equal<br>
longitudinally spaced locations from the manifold toward a front wall 153 of<br>
frame 103, where transfer pipes 126 (which extend from manifold 122) are<br>
substantially parallel with transfer pipes 134 (which extend from manifold 130).<br>
Each transfer pipe 126, 134 also extends into its respective manifold 122, 130<br>
and connects at an appropriate location with the corresponding distribution pipe<br>
disposed therein. Due to the vertical offset between manifold 122 and manifold<br>
130 within the frame of the spin beam assembly, transfer pipes 134 are<br>
immediately routed vertically downward toward manifold 122 upon emerging<br>
from manifold 130 so as to become substantially vertically aligned with transfer<br>
pipes 126 as they extend toward the front wall 153 of the frame. One skilled in<br>
the art will recognize that each distribution pipe and the transfer pipes<br>
connecting to each distribution pipe within each manifold can be independently<br>
designed to ensure a suitable residence time of polymer fluid traveling through<br>
the distribution pipe and being heated within the manifold. Further, the lengths<br>
of each of the transfer pipes extending from a particular distribution pipe are<br>
preferably equal to ensure the residence times of the fluid streams traveling<br>
within those transfer pipes is substantially the same.<br>
Spin beam 140 is disposed longitudinally near the front wall 153 within<br>
frame 103. The spin beam houses a set of six generally rectangular pump<br>
blocks 142 longitudinally spaced along the spin beam to correspond with a<br>
single transfer pipe 126, 134 extending from each manifold 122, 130 toward the<br>
pump blocks. Each pump block 142 includes a first metering pump 128 that<br>
connects with a corresponding polymer transfer pipe 126 extending toward that<br>
pump block and a second metering pump 136 that connects with a<br>
corresponding polymer transfer pipe 134 extending toward that pump block.<br>
The transfer pipes 126, 134 extend through a rear wall of spin beam 140 to<br>
connect with their corresponding metering pumps 128, 136. A heat supply<br>
conduit 144 extends from a lower portion of the rear wall of the spin beam and<br>
through the frame side wall 152 to connect with a fluid heat transfer medium<br>
supply source (not shown). The spin beam is heated by heat transfer fluid<br>
medium supplied by conduit 144, which in turn heats and maintains pump<br>
blocks 142 and pumps 128, 136 at a suitable temperature during operation of<br>
the spin assembly. The pump blocks are further constructed of a material <br>
having a low thermal conductivity to control or limit the amount of heat<br>
transferred between the pump blocks, pumps and polymer fluid traveling<br>
through the pumps. For example, in fiber manufacturing processes where two<br>
different polymer components are utilized having different melting temperatures,<br>
the pump blocks are heated to the higher temperature melting point. However,<br>
the polymer component with the lower melting temperature will never achieve<br>
the higher temperature due to the limited heat transfer capacity of the pump<br>
block.<br>
Each metering pump 128, 136 further includes an inlet for receiving<br>
polymer fluid from a corresponding polymer transfer pipe 126, 134 and multiple<br>
outlets for feeding polymer fluid streams at a selected flow rate to inlet channels<br>
in spin pack 104. In a preferred embodiment, each metering pump includes<br>
four outlets, such that the spin beam assembly is capable of providing two sets<br>
of twenty four polymer fluid streams, with the temperature and flow rate of each<br>
set being controlled independent of the other. Such an embodiment could, for<br>
example, provide metered polymer streams from each set about every six<br>
inches along a spin beam having a length of about twelve feet. However, it is<br>
noted that the metering pumps may include any number of suitable outlets<br>
depending upon the number of polymer streams required to be transferred to<br>
the spin pack.<br>
Spin pack 104 includes a plurality of inlet channels for receiving polymer<br>
fluid streams from the spin beam assembly, a polymer filtration system,<br>
distribution systems and a spinneret with an array of spinning orifices for<br>
extruding polymer filaments therethrough. For example, the spinneret orifices<br>
may be arranged in a substantially horizontal, rectangular array, typically from<br>
1000 to 5000 per meter of length of the spinneret. As used herein, the term<br>
"spinneret" refers to the lower most portion of the spin pack that delivers the<br>
molten polymer to and through orifices for extrusion into enclosed chamber 106.<br>
The spinneret can be implemented with holes drilled or etched through a plate<br>
or any other structure capable of issuing the required fiber streams. The spin<br>
pack basically coordinates molten polymer fluid flow from the spin beam to form<br>
a desired type of fiber (e.g., multicomponent fibers, fibers having a particular<br>
cross-sectional geometric configuration, etc.) as well as a desired number of<br>
fibers that are continuously extruded by the system. For example, the spin pack<br>
may include channels that combine two or more different polymer fluid streams<br>
fed from the spin beam prior to extrusion through the spinneret orifices.<br>
Additionally, the spinneret orifices may include a variety of different shapes<br>
(e.g., round, square, oval, keyhole shaped, etc.), resulting in varying types of<br>
resultant fiber cross-sectional geometries. An exemplary spin pack for use with<br>
system 100 is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,162,074 to Hills, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, it is noted<br>
that any conventional or other spin pack for spinning fibers may be utilized with<br>
system 100.<br>
Enclosed chamber 106 includes a quenching station 110 disposed<br>
directly below spin pack 104 and a drawing station 112 disposed directly below<br>
the quenching station. A pair of conduits 114 are also connected at opposing<br>
surfaces of chamber 106 in the vicinity of quenching station 110. Each conduit<br>
114 directs a stream of air (generally indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2) in a<br>
opposing direction from each other and toward extruded filaments 108 exiting<br>
spin pack 104 and traveling through quenching station 110. The extruded<br>
filaments are thus quenched by the converging air streams from conduits 114 at<br>
the quenching station. The air streams are preferably directed in a direction<br>
generally perpendicular to filaments 108 or slightly angled in a direction toward<br>
drawing station 112, which is disposed below the quenching station. However,<br>
it is noted that any number of air currents (e.g., a single air current) may be<br>
directed in any suitable orientation toward the extruded filaments disposed in<br>
the quenching station. It is further noted that any suitable gas other than air<br>
may be utilized to quench the filaments at the quenching station. Further,<br>
depending upon the types of polymer components utilized and the types of<br>
fibers to be formed, one or more controlled vapor or gas treatment streams may<br>
also be employed to chemically treat the extruded filaments within closed<br>
chamber 106 at quenching station 110 or at any other suitable location.<br>
Chamber 106 preferably has a venturi profile at drawing station 112,<br>
where the chamber walls constrict to form a tapered or narrowed chamber<br>
section within the drawing station to facilitate an increased flow rate of the<br>
combined air streams passing therethrough. The increased flow rate of the air<br>
streams within the drawing station provides a suitable drawing force to stretch<br>
and attenuate the filaments. Drawing station 112 extends to an exit opening in<br>
chamber 106 that is separated a suitable laydown distance from web-forming<br>
belt 116.<br>
Web-forming belt 116 is preferably a continuous screen belt through<br>
which air can pass, such as a Fourdrinier wire belt. Fibers exiting enclosed<br>
chamber 106 are laid down on the belt to form a nonwoven web. The belt is<br>
driven, e.g., by rollers or any other suitable drive mechanism, to deliver the web<br>
of fibers to one or more additional processing stations. Disposed beneath belt<br>
116 and in line with the exit opening of chamber 106 is a recirculation chamber<br>
120. The recirculation chamber includes a blower (not shown) that develops a<br>
negative pressure or suction within chamber 106 to direct the combined air<br>
streams from quenching station 110 through drawing station 112 and into the<br>
recirculation chamber (generally indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2). The air<br>
streams drawn into chamber 120 are recycled and delivered back to conduits<br>
114 for redelivery into quenching station 110. Preferably, the recycled air<br>
streams are also directed through a heat exchanger and/or combined with fresh<br>
air so as to maintain a suitable temperature for the quenching air before being<br>
recirculated into quenching station 110. In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
closed system may not employ recycled air streams. Rather, a blower may<br>
continuously direct fresh air streams into and through enclosed chamber 106,<br>
with the air dissipating out of the closed system upon emerging from the<br>
drawing station rather than being recycled for further use.<br>
Operation of closed system 100 is described below utilizing an<br>
exemplary bicomponent fiber spinning process, where polymer components A<br>
and B are fed to the spin beam assembly for forming the bicomponent fibers. It<br>
is to be noted, however, that system 100 may produce a wide variety of fibers,<br>
including single component and multicomponent fibers. A molten stream of<br>
polymer A is delivered to spin beam assembly 102 via inlet pipe 123, where it<br>
enters the polymer distribution pipe disposed within distribution manifold 122.<br>
Simultaneously, a molten stream of polymer B is delivered to the spin beam<br>
assembly via inlet pipe 131, where it enters the polymer distribution pipe<br>
disposed within distribution manifold 130. A fluid heat transfer medium,<br>
supplied by conduits 124, 132, is provided within both manifolds to surround the<br>
distribution pipes disposed therein and to uniformly and independently heat<br>
and/or maintain each of polymers A and B at a suitable temperature.<br>
The polymer A stream travels through the distribution pipe in manifold<br>
122 and enters polymer transfer pipes 126, which carry polymer A to the set of<br>
six metering pumps 128 disposed on pump blocks 142 in spin beam 140.<br>
Similarly, the polymer B stream travels through the distribution pipe in manifold<br>
130 and enters polymer transfer pipes 134, which carry polymer B to the set of<br>
six metering pumps 136 disposed on the pump blocks in the spin beam.<br>
Metering pumps 128 establish a suitable flow rate for transferring a plurality of<br>
streams (e.g., twenty four) of polymer A to correspondingly aligned inlet<br>
channels disposed on spin pack 104, while metering pumps 136 establish a<br>
suitable flow rate (which is independent of the flow rate established for the<br>
polymer A streams) for transferring a plurality of streams of polymer B to<br>
correspondingly aligned inlet channels disposed on the spin pack.<br>
The independently metered sets of molten polymer A and B streams are<br>
directed through channels in spin pack 104 and through the spinneret to form<br>
bicomponent polymer fibers consisting of those two polymers. The type of<br>
bicomponent fiber formed (e.g., side-by-side, sheath/core, "islands in the sea",<br>
etc.) is established by the spin pack design, where separated streams of<br>
polymers A and B are combined in a suitable manner upon emerging from the<br>
spinneret. Additionally, a suitable cross-sectional geometry for the extruded<br>
filaments may also be established by, e.g., providing spinneret orifices of one or<br>
more selected geometries.<br>
Filaments 108 consisting of polymers A and B are extruded through the<br>
spinneret and enter quenching station 110 of enclosed chamber 106, where the<br>
filaments are exposed to quenching air streams directed at the filaments from<br>
conduits 114. The blower in recirculation chamber 120 creates a suction within<br>
the enclosed chamber that directs the air streams through quenching station<br>
110 and into drawing station 112, where the velocity of the air streams is<br>
increased due to the constricted profile within a portion of the drawing station.<br>
The extruded filaments are also directed downward with the air streams from<br>
the quenching station into the drawing station, at which point the filaments are<br>
drawn and attenuated in the drawing station. The drawn fibers continue through<br>
enclosed chamber 106 to exit and form a nonwoven web 118 of fibers on belt<br>
116. The web of fibers are carried away by belt 116 for further processing. Air<br>
streams traveling through and exiting enclosed chamber 120 are drawn into<br>
recirculating chamber 120, where the streams are ultimately directed back into<br>
conduits 114 and toward quenching station 110.<br>
The combined features of temperature segregation and independent<br>
delivery of multiple metered streams of molten polymer fluids within the spin<br>
beam in the closed system of the present invention facilitates the production of<br>
a widely diverse range of fibers and fabrics not previously achieved or even<br>
considered in conventional closed systems. For example, providing<br>
independent and substantially uniform temperature control within different<br>
molten polymer streams in the spin beam vastly increases the number of<br>
different polymer combinations and ratios that can be achieved in individual<br>
fibers during fiber formation. An even spinneret temperature profile may be<br>
maintained in the system without forcing temperature changes in the polymer<br>
streams, which is not practical in the electrically heated, "coat hanger" spin<br>
beam. The uniform temperature control provided by the spin beam of the<br>
present invention, which eliminates potential thermal gradients during heating,<br>
is far superior to the electrically heated, "coat hanger" spin beams typically<br>
utilized in closed systems.<br>
The independent control of different polymer component supply<br>
pressures via the separated sets of metering pumps offers greater flexibility of<br>
polymer selection and distribution for any given machine configuration by<br>
providing enhanced control for even delivery of polymer over the entire machine<br>
width. The residence time can be more precisely controlled with the spin beam<br>
assembly and spin pack of the present invention as compared to the "coat<br>
hanger' system, a particularly important feature for heat sensitive polymers<br>
requiring a reduced residence time. In particular, short residence times may be<br>
established in the closed system of the present invention to minimize heat<br>
transfer between polymer streams and the spin beam assembly and spin pack<br>
equipment.<br>
The improved draw uniformity and prevention of external air flow or<br>
temperature disturbances that a closed system provides further enhances the<br>
string-up and production of certain types of sensitive multicomponent fibers.<br>
Additionally, the closed system facilitates the spinning of certain<br>
multicomponent fibers into a controlled vapor or gas atmosphere for chemical<br>
treatment of filaments formed during spinning, while easily containing the<br>
vapors in the closed system. The spin beam assembly and spin pack also<br>
increases the spinneret orifice density and possible orifice configurations in<br>
comparison to the "coat hanger" spin beam (which only produces a linear or<br>
narrow array of extruded filaments from the spinneret) to increase productivity<br>
and multiple polymer component products manufactured in a single closed<br>
system. Further, the multi-stream metering spin beam combined with the<br>
closed system of the present invention facilitates the production of high value<br>
fabrics including, but not limited to, anti-stat fabrics, skin wellness fabrics,<br>
wettability and abrasion resistance fabrics, and fabrics formed by differential<br>
bonding methods (rather than conventionally used heat embossing). Multiple<br>
fabric products may also be continuously produced by a single closed system of<br>
the invention by, e.g., varying the types and grouping of fibers being extruded in<br>
the cross machine direction of the system.<br>
Some examples of polymer fibers that can be produced according to the<br>
present invention are illustrated in Figs. 4-8. Fig. 4 depicts a single, low percent<br>
sheath/core fiber 202 formed among a group of single component or homo-<br>
polymer fibers 204 to introduce a high value, low melt strength, temperature and<br>
residence time sensitive additive into a high quality web formed by the fibers.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts a group of tri-component sheathed side-by-side fibers 302.<br>
These fibers exhibit both of the side-by-side and sheath/core benefits in one<br>
web formed by the fibers with the system of the present invention. In certain<br>
quench sensitive polymer combinations, or in combinations where a viscosity<br>
mismatch exists between polymer components, the spin pack of system may be<br>
configured to deliver formed fibers for optimal orientation relative to the<br>
quenching air to minimize negative effects associated with bending or dog-<br>
legging of extruded filaments from the spinneret and thus increase processing<br>
hole density and overall productivity. Figs. 6a and 6b depict two different<br>
arrangements of side-by-side bicomponent fiber configurations, where the fibers<br>
402, 502 of each configuration are oriented differently with respect to a dual air<br>
quench system (direction of quenching air in Figs. 6a and 6b is depicted by<br>
arrows). Fig. 7 depicts yet another grouping of fibers that may be produced by<br>
the system of the present invention, where dedicated metering techniques are<br>
utilized for producing bicomponent sheath/core fibers 602 mixed with single<br>
component fibers 604. In still another embodiment, the spin beam and spin<br>
pack of the present invention may be designed to deliver exact mixed fiber sizes<br>
through multi-stream dedicated metering so as to produce fabrics with tailored<br>
pore-size gradients. Fig. 8 depicts a grouping of fibers that would produce such<br>
as a fabric, where larger diameter fibers 702 are combined with smaller<br>
diameter fibers 704 during the closed system fiber spinning process.<br>
Other examples of fibers that may be formed utilizing the system of the<br>
present invention are sheath/core fibers where the sheath is a thermoplastic<br>
material with a low melting point and the core material is a thermoplastic<br>
material with high strength characteristics. A spunbond web of these fibers can<br>
be bonded thermally (e.g., using calendar rolls, through-air, etc.) at<br>
temperatures high enough to soften or melt the outer sheath material but low<br>
enough so as not to compromise the strength characteristics of the core<br>
material. Such fibers can also have special properties available in the sheath<br>
such as soft hand, anti-microbial capabilities, and gamma stability. Splittable<br>
fibers can also be formed in which two or more separate polymer components<br>
in extruded filaments are separated after formation of a web thus creating a web<br>
of finer fibers. Additionally, side-by-side fibers can be formed that<br>
spontaneously crimp and bulk when subjected to appropriate treatment. Mixed<br>
polymer fibers may also be formed in the closed system of the present invention<br>
to provide a number of useful properties for final products manufactured utilizing<br>
those fibers.<br>
From the foregoing examples, it can be seen that the closed system of<br>
the present invention is extremely versatile and facilitates the production of a<br>
wide variety of multiple polymer component fiber and fabric combinations in a<br>
single system.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments<br>
described above, and additional or modified processing techniques are<br>
considered to be within the scope of the invention. As previously noted, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the closed chamber configuration of Fig. 2;<br>
rather, the closed system of the present invention may utilize any closed<br>
environment configuration that prevents exposure of the extruded filaments to<br>
uncontrolled temperatures and air currents during fiber formation.<br>
Similarly, the spin beam assembly is not limited to the configuration of<br>
Fig. 3; rather, the spin beam assembly may be designed to receive and<br>
thermally process and meter any number of segregated polymer fluid supply<br>
streams. In other words, the spin beam assembly may include any suitable<br>
number of polymer supply inlets connecting to any suitable number of<br>
distribution pipes within distribution manifolds to independently heat and/or<br>
maintain any number of different polymer streams at a variety of different<br>
temperatures. The spin beam assembly may further include any suitable<br>
number of metering pumps, where each pump has any suitable number of<br>
outlet streams, to independently provide different polymer fluid streams at<br>
varying flow rates to the spin pack. Further, each of the metering pumps may<br>
be configured to deliver one or more polymer fluid streams to the spin pack at a<br>
flow rate independent of the flow rates for streams metered by any of the other<br>
metering pumps.<br>
The spin pack may be designed in any suitable manner to facilitate the<br>
production of fibers and fabrics including any combination of single component<br>
or multicomponent fibers of any suitable cross-sectional geometries. Further,<br>
any number or combination of fiber processing techniques, yarn forming<br>
techniques, and woven and non-woven fabric formation processes can be<br>
applied to the fibers formed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Having described preferred embodiments of a new and improved closed<br>
system for producing fibers and fabrics having multiple polymer components, it<br>
is believed that other modifications, variations and changes will be suggested to<br>
those skilled in the art in view of the teachings set forth herein. It is therefore to<br>
be understood that all such variations, modifications and changes are believed<br>
to fall within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended<br>
