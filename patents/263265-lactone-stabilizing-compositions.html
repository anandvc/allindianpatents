				<td>LACTONE STABILIZING COMPOSITIONS<br>
.Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to compositions comprising an organic material, such as a polymer, and an oligomeric iactone for use as a stabilizers.  The inventive compositions may be employed for stabilization of organic materials against oxidative, thermal, or light-induced degradation.   The invention is directed to novel oligomeric lactones.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Various compositions are known that function to stabilize organic materials against oxidative, thermal or light-induced degradation.   Such stabilization compositions may have broad applications in thermoplastics such as polyolefm, thermoset,resins such as polyure.thanes, and coating formulations. One problem with polyurethane foams, for example, is that such foams tend to yellow after a certain period of time.  Yellowing of foam products is undesirable. Such yellowing may be caused by'NOx gas fading or UV radiation.<br>
[0003] United States Patents 4,325,863 and 4,338,244 to Hinsken disclose 3-aryl benzofuran-2-ones and their dimers as new class of stabilizers in various organic polymers such as polyolefins, polyurethanes and polyesters.<br>
[0004] United States, Patent Nos. 5,367,008 and 5,369,159 and 5,428,162 to Nesvadba disclose the preparation of various S-(alkoxyphenyl) benzofuran-2-ones and 3-{acyloxyphenyl) benzpfuran-2-pne derivatives, for use as polymer stabilizers.<br>
[0005] The prior art provides a number of relatively non-reactive, solid stabilizers. Solids are difficult to .use in manufacturing processes.  Solids provide difficulties in handling, migration, fogging, and blooming.<br>
[0006] New and more effective stabilizing compounds are needed in the industry. This invention provides such compounds.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0007] Reference now will be made to the embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in this invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.<br>
[0008] This invention provides a novel class of compounds and<br>
'    '         : '<br>
compositions and synthetic methods.   In one aspect of the invention, the<br>
compositions may comprise polymeric or oligomeric lactone antioxidants, such<br><br>
as poly(oxyalkylene) chain(s) substituted 3-arylbenzofuranones or<br>
poly(caprolactone) chain(s) substituted 3-arylbenzofuranones. The inventive lactone antioxidants may be polymeric or oligomeric, Which may be liquid or pastes in nature at room temperature.   In many applications, liquid or paste<br><br>
forms of such compounds provide a remarkable and surprising advantage. Although it may not be necessary for its stabilizing properties, the compositions may bear one or more reactive primary,-OH groups on the polymer chains. For some applications, the terminal group(s) of the polymer chain(s) is not believed to be critical with regard to the' functioning of the polymeric lactones in stabilizer compositions. The chain(s) may also contain oxyalkylene ether and aliphatic ester functional groups or radicals.<br>
[0009] The inventive liquid lacones polymeric/oligomeric chains may contain oxyalkylene segments (such as ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, etc, and the EO/PO ratio can be designed as such to achieve desired hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic properties) and/or aliphatic ester segments (hydrophobic). This affords the opportunity to "tune1' the lactbne antioxidants for desirable compatibility in various media such as themnosets (polyurethane), thermoplastics (PET, PP, PS, PC and the like), wax, aqueous systems (liquid hand soap, detergents, sunscreens, fabric softeners etc. consumer products), and coatings.<br>
[0010] Lactones bearing unique polymeric/oligomeric chains may also be<br><br>
comprised of specific combination of EO/PO/aliphatic esters that are compatible<br>
with most of the above-mentioned applications.  The liquid nature of the inventive polymeric lactones provides ease of handling during the application process. That is, the compositions may desirably be liquids or pastes at room temperature, making it much easier to apply the compositions in manufacturing processes. And the polymeric/oligomeric nature of the inventive lactones provides higher molecular weight and better compatibility with application media, thus is less volatile, and less prone to migrate, bloom and plate-out.<br>
[0011] In some applications, primary hydroxy groups are present on the inventive lactone molecules.   These structures offer superior reactivity in polyurethane, PET and coating systems.  Thus the polymeric lactone molecules may be chemically attached on to the application media if such is desirable. The inventive polymeric UV absorbers may solve or mitigate migration, leaching, fogging, plate-out, and extraction problems, each of which is highly undesirable.<br>
[0012] The inventive polymeric lactone antioxidants 3-arylbenzofuranones, wnen useo aiong wun oiner additives such as UV absorbers, other antioxidants, and light stabilizers, may significantly reduce the gas fading (NOx) and UV radiation induced yellowing of white polyurethane foam.   The compositions may be provided ip liquid form, and are reactive into the foam, which is a significant advantaae.   that is, these compositions are truly polymeric or oligomeric, having in some applications polyoxyalkylene and<br><br>
aliphatic polyester block copolymer/oligomer chains.<br>
[0013] The inventive lactone stabilizers may be liquid and polymeric. They may provide ease of handling, processing and metering. The inventive lactone stabilizers may bear primary -OH groups at the end of polymer chains. They may be completely reactive in polyurethane, coatings, PET, and polycarbonate applications if such is desirable.   They may provide antioxidant functions to resist undesirable extraction, migration, fogging, and leaching out of the polymer matrix.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
[0028] Two hundred seventy four,grams of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 165 g of 4-hydroxyrnandelic acid and 530 ml of acetic acid were combined in a two liter three neck round bottom flask equipped with a temperature probe, stirring apparatus and condenser,  The mixture was heated to 95°C, at which, 2.6 g of methanesulfonic acid were added.   The, reaction was allowed to proceed at 95°C for three hours. After cooling to room temperature and sitting overnight, the precipitated product was collected via filtration. This filtercake was washed several times with acetic acid until the precipitate was white. After drying in a 50°C oven, 175 g of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzofuran-2-one product having a melting point of 189-191 °C were obtained.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0029] In a three liter three neck round bottom flask, a solution of 32.4 g of sodium hydroxide in 810 ml of water was formed. With stirring, 91.6 g of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzofuran-2-one were added and the mixture heated to 80°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Once at 80°C, 27 ml of 2-chloroethanol were added and the reaction held at 80°C for two hours. After cooling to room temperature, a solution of 99 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1251 ml of water was added and the reaction held again at 80°C for an additional hour. Once cooled to room temperature, the liquid was decanted and the remaining solid dissolved in 50Q ml of methylene chloride. This solution was washed once with 300 ml of water. After drying the methylene chloride layer over magnesium sulfate and stripping, 92.6 g of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-[4-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-phenyl]benzofuran-2-one, a light'yellow solid remained. This solid can be further recrystallized from ethanol/water.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
[0031] Three hundred grams of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzofuran-2-one, 500g of toluene and 3g of lanthanum phosphate catalyst were charged into an autoclave. The reaction mixture was<br>
purged several times with nitrogen gas (to a pressure of 60 PSIG) and finally pressurized to 5 PSIG of nitrogen. After heating the autoclave to 121°C, ethylene oxide was added to the reaction mixture until the pressure in the reactor reached 60 PSIG. After the pressure dropped to 30 PSIG due to consumption of ethylene oxide, more ethylene oxide was added to the reactor in the same fashion as previously described until a total of l92g of ethylene oxide had been added. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was post-cooked for a total of 30 minutes. Toluene was removed via vacuum stripping yielding 472 g (96%) of a light yellow viscous liquid.<br>
Article Production and Performance Testing for Inventive Liquid Polymeric Lactone Antioxidants<br>
a) Polvether Foam Article Formation<br>
The inventive lactone antioxidants were incorporated with or without other additives to produce,(in one particular embodiment of the invention) polyurethane foam in accordance with the following formulation and procedure:<br>
Component	Amount<br>
F3022 Polyol (from Bayer)	100 grams<br>
Water	4.53ml<br>
DABCO 33LV (catalyst, from Air Products)	0.15ml<br>
DABCOT10 (catalyst)	0.32ml<br>
L520 Silicone (from Crompton)	1.0 mL<br>
80/20 Toluene diisocyanate (Bayer, 112 index) 49.0 ml<br>
Reactint® Blue X3LV	as noted<br>
Inventive Polymeric Lactone Antiqxidahts	as noted<br>
Additive from Class A<br>
Tinuvin® 326	as noted<br>
Additive from Class B<br>
lrganox®1135	as noted<br>
Additive from Class C<br>
Irganox® 5057	as noted<br>
Additive from Class D<br>
Irganox® HP 136	as noted<br>
[0032] Upon mixture within a reaction vessel, the reaction created a "health" bubble (indicating gelation and blowing balance), and the vessel was then exposed to 160°C (generated within a conventional oven to simulate actual heat history encountered on an Industrial production level) for about 3 minutes allowing the material to cure to form d foam bun. The resultant foam buns were then analyzed for performance, as discussed in details below.<br>
b) Performance Characteristics of Polvether Foams Including Inventive Polymeric Liquid Lactone Antioxidants<br>
The white foams made in accordance with formulation and process as described in Section a), were all tested for standard foam performance, in terms of rise time, tack time, and bun height, and compared with the control polyether foams either made with conventional commercial lactone<br>
antioxidant Irganpx® HP 136 or made without additive. Measurements within 5% of the control are considered acceptable for the finished foam product. The measurements are summarized in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Foam Performance of Inventive or Comparative Lactone Antioxidants<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
[0033] Additionally, the foams produced exhibited good resiliency and densities measured at about 1-5 pounds per cubit foot. Thus, the inventive polymeric lactone antioxidants ptovide acceptable polyurethane foam articles as compared with control samples.<br>
c) Extraction Measurements'From Polvurethane Foams<br>
The polyurethane foams produced in above Section b) were analyzed for extraction'levels using the following method. The extraction test involved cutting 1 gram of the cured foam from the center of the sample and post-curing the cut foam for another 20 minutes at 160°C in a glass jar. After cooling to room temperature, 75 gram's of methanol were then added to the glass jar that was then capped for 1 hour. The foam was then removed and the extract solution was analyzed to detect the percentages<br>
of the lactone antioxidants being extracted out. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br>
Table 2, Foam Extraction Tests of Inventive or Comparative Lactone Antioxidants<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0034] Based on the molecular weight of these additives, 1.0 php of HP-136 is molar equivalent to 2.1 php of inventive additive from Example 3, and 1.6 php of inventive additive from Example 4. As suggested from Table 2, the inventive liquid polymeric lactbhe antioxidants provide significant improvement in the foam extraction test, comparing to comparative examples such as commercial product HP-136:<br>
d) Protection of Colorants; from Thermal Discoloration in Polvurethane Foam Liquid polymeric colorant Reactint®.Blue X3LV (available from Milliken Chemical) is widely used for the coloration of polyurethane foam, and is known to be prone to thermal discoloration during foam article<br>
formulation. Thus, the blue foams were made in the presence of 1php Blue X3LV with or without inventive and comparative lactone antioxidants, in accordance with formulation and process similar to those as described Section a), with the exception,that after the reaction created a "health" bubble (indicating gelation and blowing balance), the vessel was then exposed to 185 °C (generated within a microwave oven to simulate actual heat history encountered on a large industrial production environment) for about 10 min before it was exposed to 160 °C (generated by a conventional oven) for 3 minutes to cure the foam bun. The foam buns were sliced in half, and then compared, reading at the center of the foam bun (usually where the discoloration occurs) in CMC for delta E with the reading at the outer section of the foam bun (usually where no discoloration occurs). The results are summarized in Table 3.<br>
Table 3: Stabilize Reactint® Blue X3LV from Thermal Discoloration during Polyurethane Foam, Formation<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0035] The data in Table 3 suggested that the inventive polymeric liquid lactone antioxidants were very efjective in stabilization of polymeric colorants such as Blue X3LV from thermal degradation during the polyurethane foam production process.,<br>
e) Protection of Pure Polvol from Thermal Degradation/Yellowing during Polvurethane Foam Formation<br>
Polyols are known to be very prone to oxidation. In order to retain the physical and chemical properties, almost all commercial polyols are protected with conventional hindered phenol antioxidants for storage and transportation. One major side effect of the hindered phenols is that they cause discoloration/yellowing during polyurethane article formation and when exposed to exhaust gas (NOx). An antioxidant which can effectively<br><br>
protect the intergraty of polyols without causing polymers such as polyurethane foam yellowing and compatible with polyols is highly desired.<br>
In order to test the effectiveness of the inventive polymeric lactone antioxidants, the white foams (without adding any colorant) were made using pure polyol (no conventional antioxidant package presence) with or without inventive and comparative lactone antioxidants, in accordance with formulation and process similar to those as described Section a), with the exception that after,the .reaction created a "health" bubble (indicating gelation and blowing balance), the vessel was then exposed to 185 °C (generated within a microwave oven to simulate actual heat history encountered on a large industrial production environment) for about 10 min before it was exposed, to 160 °C (generated by a conventional oven) for 3 minutes to cure the foam bun. The foam buns were sliced in half, and then compared reading at the center of the foam bun (usually where the discoloration occurs) jn CMC for delta E with the reading at the outer section of the foam bun (usgally where no discoloration occurs). The results are summarized in Table 4.<br>
Table 4: Performance of Compositions in Stabilizing Pure Pofyol from<br>
Thermal Degradation/Yellowing During PU Foam Formation<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0036] Thus, the inventive polymeric liquid lactone antioxidants are very effective in stabilizing pure polyols from thermal degradation.<br>
f)   Protection of Polvurethane Foam Made with Pure Polvols from Gas Fading<br>
In order to test the effectiveness of the inventive polymeric lactone antioxidants in stabilizing the pure polyols from gas (NOx) fading and comparing the performance with commonly used conventional hindered phenol antioxidant package, the white foams (without adding any<br>
colorant) were made using pure polyol (no conventional antioxidant package presence) as well as regular polyols (with the conventional stabilizer package presences) with or without inventive and comparative lactone antioxldants, in accordance with formulation and process similar to those as described in Section a). After curing, the foam buns were sliced in half, and small pieces of foam samples (diameters of 10cm x 5cm x 2cm) were cut from the center of each foam bun. These foam samples were all tested under NOx gas chamber (NOx concentration is 1 ppm) for discoloration at different exposure time. Those foam samples exposed to different amounts of time in NOx chamber testing were then compared reading in CMC for delta E with respected unexposed foam samples. The results are summan'zed in Table 5.<br>
Table 5: Performance of Compositions in Stabilizing PU Foam Formation<br>
with Pure Polyo,! from Gas Fading<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0037] It is thus clear that the inventive liquid polymeric lactone antioxidants are superior to Conventional hindered phenol antioxidant package in stabilizing polyol from NOx fading!,<br>
g) Reduction of Discoloration in white Polvurethane Foam<br>
Several white foams made in accordance with formulation and process as described in Section a), in the presence of unique anti-discoloration additive packages consists of a UV absorber selected from Class A, a phenolic antioxidant from Class B, a secondary amine antioxidant from Class C and a lactone antioxidant from Class D. The inventive liquid polymeric lactone antioxidants are used in this unique additive package to replace the commercial antioxidant Irgnox® HP-136 which is solid and/or may not thoroughly miscible with polyols. The foams are made with the inventive additive packages, as well as.commercially available additive packages, the foam buns are,then sliced in half and 2 sets of small pieces of foam samples (diameters of 10cm x 5cm x 2cm) were cut from the center of each foam..bun. One set of these foam samples were tested under Xenon lamp and compared the performance against UV discoloration (XenonJamp :test according to AATCC Test No. 16-1999) and Another set of samples were tested under NOx gas chamber (NOx concentration is 1 ppm) for discoloration at different exposure time (gas fading test as described in AATCC TesJ No. 23-1999). Those foam samples exposed to different amounts.pf time under UV lamp or in the NOx chamber were then compared reading in CMC for delta E with respected unexposed foam samples,<br>
The inventive synergistic additive composition packages are listed in Table 6. Also included in Table fj&gt; as comparatives, are control (with no additive) and commercially available additive packages B-75 (Ciba), CS-31 (Crompton) and LSr1 (Ortegol), which tare current best commercial products in polyurethane ijndustry for stabilization of white polyurethane foams.<br>
