BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
In the drawings accompanying the specification, Figure 1 represents the system of the prior art system. Figure 2 represents the system of the present invention.<br>
The invention is further described here below with respect to the working of the system, which is given by way of illustration and therefore, should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
WORKING OF THE SYSTEM:<br>
The knife is located in the upper jaw which is adjusted parallel to anvil with newly developed device which consists of a taper wedge, a screw having fine pitch threads and end plates. The wedge with screw and one side end plate is first placed in the slot of the upper jaw and then the knife is placed on it.<br>
The wedge is designed having a particular taper face on one side. The knife is also made having equal amount of taper ratio to match with the taper face of wedge. The wedge is longitudinally moved along the length with the help of screw which makes the knife move upward or downward.<br>
To take the knife upward, the wedge is moved backward and to take the knife downward, the wedge is moved forward. The wedge is finally set such that the knife comes in close contact with anvil of lower jaw and parallel to it. The lock nut given on the screw is finally tightened and locked after the knife is accurately set and fine-tuned.<br>
The concept of the taper wedge developed by us does the following functions.<br>
(1)	Because of equal ratio of taper both on the knife and wedge, sliding of the wedge in horizontal direction causes vertical movement of knife with high accuracy of equal movement through out the length of knife.<br>
(2)	Because of having designed the screw with fine pitch threads, a perceptible movement of screw moving the wedge will give fine vertical movement of the knife that may be required for final setting. This will allow the operator to set the knife with lower skill.<br>
7<br><br>
(3) The anvil is located in the lower jaw above the taper wedge and is adjusted with respect to profile of jaw. The anvil is set by the same principle giving vertical movement to it by sliding the taper wedge horizontally.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
1.	Very simple mechanism.<br>
2.	Introduction of concept of taper wedge has given excellent results.<br>
3.	Highly accurate setting possible without any significant fine-tuning.<br>
4.	If at all any fine setting is required, it can be easily achieved just by a perceptible movement of screw.<br>
5.	Time that is required for setting the knife is very low.<br>
6.	Operator does not require high skill for setting.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
In the drawings accompanying the specification, Figure 1 represents the system of the prior art system. Figure 2 represents the system of the present invention.<br>
The invention is further described here below with respect to the working of the system, which is given by way of illustration and therefore, should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
WORKING OF THE SYSTEM:<br>
The knife is located in the upper jaw which is adjusted parallel to anvil with newly developed device which consists of a taper wedge, a screw having fine pitch threads and end plates. The wedge with screw and one side end plate is first placed in the slot of the upper jaw and then the knife is placed on it.<br>
The wedge is designed having a particular taper face on one side. The knife is also made having equal amount of taper ratio to match with the taper face of wedge. The wedge is longitudinally moved along the length with the help of screw which makes the knife move upward or downward.<br>
To take the knife upward, the wedge is moved backward and to take the knife downward, the wedge is moved forward. The wedge is finally set such that the knife comes in close contact with anvil of lower jaw and parallel to it. The lock nut given on the screw is finally tightened and locked after the knife is accurately set and fine-tuned.<br>
The concept of the taper wedge developed by us does the following functions.<br>
(1)	Because of equal ratio of taper both on the knife and wedge, sliding of the wedge in horizontal direction causes vertical movement of knife with high accuracy of equal movement through out the length of knife.<br>
(2)	Because of having designed the screw with fine pitch threads, a perceptible movement of screw moving the wedge will give fine vertical movement of the knife that may be required for final setting. This will allow the operator to set the knife with lower skill.<br>
7<br><br>
(3) The anvil is located in the lower jaw above the taper wedge and is adjusted with respect to profile of jaw. The anvil is set by the same principle giving vertical movement to it by sliding the taper wedge horizontally.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
1.	Very simple mechanism.<br>
2.	Introduction of concept of taper wedge has given excellent results.<br>
3.	Highly accurate setting possible without any significant fine-tuning.<br>
4.	If at all any fine setting is required, it can be easily achieved just by a perceptible movement of screw.<br>
5.	Time that is required for setting the knife is very low.<br>
6.	Operator does not require high skill for setting.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
