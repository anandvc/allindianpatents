				<td>MODIFIED LYSINE-MIMETIC COMPOUNDS<br>
Field<br>
The present teachings relate to lysine mimetic compounds having pharmacological<br>
activity, such as antiarrhythmic activity, and desirable bioavailability properties. The<br>
present teachings further relate to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such<br>
compounds and methods of using and making such compounds and compositions.<br>
Background<br>
There is increasing recognition that intercellular communication is essential for<br>
cellular homeostasis, proliferation and differentiation. Such communication is<br>
believed to be facilitated by gap junctions. These structures are thought to be a<br>
route for coupling cells and permitting "cross-talk." (See generally, Sperelakis N.,<br>
eds., Cell Interactions and Gap Junctions, CRC Press, Inc. (1989)). The cross-talk<br>
between gap junctions is referred to as "gap junctional intercellular communication"<br>
(GJIC).<br>
Generally, gap junctions are specialized regions of the cell membrane that contain<br>
clusters of hundreds to thousands of densely packed channels that directly connect<br>
the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. The gap junction channels are composed of<br>
two hemichannels, or connexons, provided by each of two neighboring cells.  [Each<br>
connexon, in turn, is made up of six proteins called connexins.<br>
In the heart, conduction of electrical impulses takes place through gap junctions.<br>
Abnormal GiJIC has been linked to a variety of disease states, including heart<br>
disease.  For example, it has been shown that mice heterozygous for the Cx43<br>
gene, which codes for a specific ventricular connexin, develop spontaneous<br>
ventricular arrhythmias and suffer from sudden cardiac death.  (Guerrero et al., J.<br>
Clin. Invest, 99, 1991-1998 (1997)). Reduced expression of Cx43 in heterozygous<br>
mice is directly linked to an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during<br>
ischemia. (Lerner et at., Circulation, 101, 547-552 (2000)). Several other studies<br>
have shown reduced expression or altered distribution of Cx43 in chronically<br>
ischemic, hibernating, or hypertrophied hearts. (Kaprelian et al., Circulation, 97,<br><br>
651-660 (1998); Peters et al., Circulation, 88, 864-875 (1993); Saffitz et a!.,<br>
Cardiovasc. Res., 42, 309-317 (1999)).<br>
Several peptides that influence GJIC have been identified, including antiarrhythmic<br>
peptides AAP (Aonuma et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo), 28, 3332-3339 (1980)),<br>
AAP10 (Dhein et al., Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol., 350, 174-184<br>
(1994); Muller et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 327, 65-72 (1997)), and HP5 (disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,775,743). However, these peptides exhibit undesirable<br>
characteristics, including low stability, short half-life, and a lack of oral<br>
bioavailability.<br>
Summary<br>

A.	Definitions<br>
Unless specified otherwise, the following definitions are provided for specific terms,<br>
which are used in the following written description.<br>
Throughout the description and claims the three-letter code for natural amino acids<br>
is used as well as generally accepted three letter codes for other a-amino acids,<br>
such as sarcosine (Sar). Where the L or D form has not been specified, it is to'be<br>
understood that the amino acid in question can be either the L or D form. A mixture<br>
of equimolar amounts of D and L compounds is termed racemic and is designated<br>
by the prefix DL, e.g., DL-leucine. It can alternatively be designated by the prefix<br>
rac- (e.g. rac-leucine) or by the prefix [+/-]. The present teachings include all<br>
possible stereoisomers of the compounds of Formulae I, II and III as well as of the<br>
specific compounds shown herein.<br>
The term "peptide" herein designates a chain of two or more molecules that are<br>
linked by means of a peptide bond.   Peptides can contain one or more naturally<br>
occurring amino acids, one or more unnatural amino acids, one or more molecules<br>
that are not amino acids but are capable of forming peptide bonds, or mixtures,<br>
thereof.<br><br>
The term "amino acid" refers to a molecule having the general formula<br>
NHR-CHR'-COOH (wherein R is H and R' is an amino acid side chain, or R and R'<br>
together with the carbon and nitrogen to which they are bonded form a ring, e.g.,<br>
proline) which is capable of forming a peptide bond with one or more other<br>
molecules having the same general formula. The term embraces both L and D<br>
amino acids.<br>
A "naturally occurring amino acid" refers to one of the following 20 amino acids: Ala<br>
(A), Cys (C), Ser (S), Thr (T), Asp (D), Glu (E), Asn (N), Gln (Q), His (H). Arg (R),<br>
Lys (K), lle (I), Leu (L). Met (M), Val (V), Phe (F), Tyr (Y), Trp (W), Gly (G), and Pro<br>
(P). Normally these are L-amino acids, but the present teachings also allow for the<br>
use of D-amino acids.<br>
As used herein, the term "lysine mimetic" refers to an unnatural amino acid<br>
comprising a C5-6 aliphatic or aromatic ring and at least two basic amine<br>
functionalities (i.e., at least one basic amine functionality in addition to the N-<br>
terminal amine).  In some cases, the lysine mimetic has the formula<br>
NHR-CHR'-COOH, wherein R and R' together with the carbon and nitrogen to <br>
which they are bonded form a 5-6 membered ring, wherein the ring either (a)<br>
contains at least one additional ring nitrogen, e.g., imidazolidine-2-carboxylic acid<br>
(lca), or (b) bears an amine substituent, e.g., amino-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid<br>
(4Amp) or amino-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (4Ampi). In other cases, the lysine<br>
mimetic has the formula NHR-CHR'-COOH wherein R is H and R' is a side chain<br>
comprising a C5-6 aliphatic or aromatic ring, wherein (a) the ring either contains at<br>
least one ring nitrogen or bears an amine substituent, and (b) the ring is separated<br>
from the amino acid backbone methylene by 1 or 2 atoms. A non-limiting example<br>
of such a lysine mimetic is amino-phenylalanine (4AmF), wherein 1 atom separates<br>
the ring from the backbone. Lysine mimetics can also have the formula<br>
NHR-CR'R"-COOH wherein R is H and R' and R" together form a C5-6 aliphatic or<br>
aromatic ring, wherein the ring either contains at least one ring nitrogen or bears an<br>
amine substituent. One non-limiting example of this type of lysine mimetic is 4-<br>
amino-piperidine-4-carboxylic acid (Pip). Also included within the definition of<br>
"lysine mimetic" are unnatural - and Y-amino acids comprising a C5-6 aliphatic or<br>
aromatic ring and at least two basic amine functionalities as described above, such<br><br>
as 3,5-diamino-benzoic acid (Damba). Other lysine mimetics are 4-aminoproline<br>
analogs wherein the proline ring nitrogen is not present (e.g., 3-<br>
aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid) or is located in another position in the proline<br>
ring (e.g., 3-aminopyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid or 3-aminopyrrolidine-1-<br>
carboxamide). In any of the lysine mimetics, the basic amine functionalities can be<br>
a primary arnino group (e.g. 4AmF, Damba, 4Ampi, and 4Amp) or a secondary<br>
amino group (e.g. Pip and lca). Examples of lysine mimetics having aliphatic cyclic<br>

The present teachings also encompass isomers and/or enantiomers of the<br>
compounds listed above (e.g., 2S4S, 2S4R, 2R4R, 2R.4S, 3S5S, 3S5R, 3R5R,<br>
3R5S), as well as their salts, esters, hydrates, and prodrugs.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present teachings<br>
having an acidic moiety can be formed using organic and inorganic bases. Suitable<br>
salts formed with bases; include metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth<br>
metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, or magnesium salts; ammonia salts<br>
and organic amine salts, such as those formed with morpholine, thiomorpholine,<br>
piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine (e.g., ethyl-tert-butyl-,<br>
diethyl-, diisopropyl-, triethyl-, tributyl- or dimethylpropylamine), or a mono-, di- or<br>
trihydroxy lower alkylamine (e.g., mono-, di- or triethanolamine). Internal salts also<br>
can be formed. Similarly, when a compound of the present teachings contains a<br>
basic moiety, salts can be formed using organic and inorganic acids. For example,<br>
salts can be formed from the following acids: acetic, propionic, lactic, citric, tartaric,<br>
succinic, fumaric, maleic, malonic, mandelic, malic, phthalic, hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, methanesulfonic, napthalenesulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, and camphorsulfonic as well as other known<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acids. Amino acid addition salts can also be formed<br>
with amino acids such as lysine, glycine, or phenylalanine.<br>
The present teachings also include prodrugs of the compounds described herein.<br>
As used herein, "prodrug" refers to a moiety that produces, generates or releases a<br>
compound of the present teachings when administered to a mammalian subject.<br>
Prodrugs can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the<br>
compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either by routine <br><br>
manipulation or in vivo, from the parent compounds.  Examples of prodrugs include<br>
compounds of the present teachings as described herein that contain one or more<br>
molecular moieties appended to a hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group of<br>
the compound, and that when administered to a mammalian subject, is cleaved in<br>
vivo to form the free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group, respectively.<br>
Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate<br>
derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the present<br>
teachings. Examples of preferred prodrugs include oxazolidinone or<br>
imidazolidinone prodrugs.  Ester prodrugs are preferably formed with lower<br>
alcohols, such as C1-6 alcohols. Preparation and use of prodrugs is discussed in T.<br>
Higuchi and V. Stella, "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," Vol. 14 of the A.C.S.<br>
Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B.<br>
Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergarnon Press, 1987.<br>
In a further aspect, the present teachings provide derivatives of the compounds,<br>
and more particularly protected forms of the compounds. By way of example, the<br>
compounds can be protected at their N- and/or C-terrnini, and/or at the amino acid<br>
side chain (in those compounds wherein R1 is an amino acid side chain). Examples<br>
of protecting groups include tBu, Boc, Fmoc, Fm, Benzyl, Dde and Z and also<br>
include the compounds when coupled to a solid phase, e.g. when they have been<br>
made by solid phase synthesis.<br>
C.         Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The compounds of the present teachings can serve as medicaments in their pure<br>
form or as pharmaceutical compositions, which can be administered via any<br>
acceptable method known in the art, either singly or in combination.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present teachings can comprise a<br>
compound of the present teachings in admixture with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier, diluent, vehicle or excipient. Such compositions can be<br>
formulated to oral administration (including buccal cavity or sublingually) or by<br>
parenteral administration (including intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c),<br>
intramuscular (i.m.), intraperitoneal (i.p.)) administration. Other administration<br>
routes include epidural, rectal, intranasal or dermal administration or by pulmonary<br>
inhalation.  Especially preferred formulations provide sustained release of the<br>
compounds of the present teachings. The compositions are preferably in the form<br><br>
of solid or liquid formulations and methods for their preparation are generally<br>
described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 17th Ed., Alfonso R. Gennaro<br>
(Ed.), Mark Publishing Company, Easton, PA, U.S.A., 1985.<br>
Such compositions generally contain an effective amount of the one or more active<br>
compounds of the present teachings, together with a suitable carrier in order to<br>
provide the dosage in a form compatible with the route of administration selected.<br>
Preferably, the carrier is in the form of a vehicle, a diluent, a buffering agent, a<br>
tonicity adjusting agent, a preservative and stabilizers. The excipients constituting<br>
the carrier must be compatible with the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) and are<br>
preferably capable of stabilizing the compounds without being deleterious to the<br>
subject being treated.<br>
A form of repository or sustained-release formulation can be used so that<br>
therapeutically effective amounts of the preparation are delivered into the<br>
bloodstream over many hours or days following administration of the compound or<br>
composition, e.g., by transdermal injection or deposition.  Formufations suitable for<br>
sustained release include biodegradable polymers, such as L-lactic acid, D-lactic:<br>
acid, DL-lactic; acid, glycolide, glycolic acid, and isomers thereof. Similarly, the<br>
carrier or diluent can include any sustained release material known in the art, such<br>
as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax.<br>
Other sustained release formulations can include, but are not limited to,<br>
formulations that include at least one of the compounds disclosed herein combined<br>
with liposomes, microspheres, emulsions or micelles and liquid stabilizers.<br>
The doses the compounds and compositions of the present teachings required for<br>
the desired therapeutic effects will depend upon on the potency of the compound,<br>
the particular composition used and the route of administration selected. The<br>
compounds will typically be administrated in the range of about 0.001 g to 10 g per<br>
patient per day. For example, the compounds can be administered in the range<br>
from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per patient per day, from about 10 mg to about<br>
100 mg per patient per day, or about 50 mg per patient per day.<br><br>
The most suitable dosing regimen can best be determined by a medical practitioner<br>
for each patient individually. The optimal dosing regimen with the compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions according to the present teachings depends on<br>
factors such as the particular disease or disorder being treated, the desired effect,<br>
and the age, weight or body mass index:, and general physical conditions of the<br>
patient. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form to<br>
alleviate acute symptoms or as a continuous therapy in the form of multiple doses<br>
over time. Alternatively, continuous infusion systems or slow release depot<br>
formulations can be employed. Two or more compounds or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions according to the present teachings can be co-administered<br>
simultaneously or sequentially in any order. In addition, the compounds and<br>
compositions can be administered in a similar manner for prophylactic purposes.<br>
Ultimately, the; best dosing regimen will be decided by the attending physician for<br>
each patient individually.<br>
D.        Therapeutic uses<br>
Compounds according to the present teachings can facilitate and/or maintain the<br>
intercellular communication mediated by gap junctions. In one aspect, the<br>
compounds according to the present teachings target the same cells targeted by<br>
AAP, AAP10, HP5, and/or functional analogues thereof, i.e. the compounds are<br>
able to modulate the function of these cells by agonizing or antagonizing the<br>
function of AAP, AAP10, HP5, and/or functional analogues thereof. The scope of<br>
the present teachings is, however, not limited to compounds having specific AAP<br>
agonistic or antagonistic properties. The present teachings also relate to the<br>
preparation and use of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of<br>
pathologies which can be associated with impaired intercellular gap junction<br>
communication and methods for using these compositions, e.g. as disclosed in WO<br>
02/077017 "New Medical Uses of Intercellular Communication Facilitating<br>
Compounds".<br>
The present also provides methods of treating a subject having, or preventing a<br>
subject at risk from developing, a condition associated with impaired GJIC (e.g.,<br>
cardiac arrhythmia or osteoporosis) comprising administering a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of any of the compounds of the present teachings. Individuals<br>
who can be treated using compounds according to the present teachings include,<br><br>
but are not limited to, animals, preferably mammals, e.g., rodents (including mice,<br>
rats, hamsters, and lagomorphs, such as rabbits), dogs, pigs, goats (generally any<br>
domestic animal), and primates. In one preferred aspect, the subject is a human<br>
being.<br>
Examples of conditions which can be treated or prevented using compounds of the<br>
present teachings include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease;<br>
osteoporosis; inflammation of airway epithelium; disorders of alveolar tissue;<br>
bladder incontinence; impaired hearing (e.g. due to diseases of the cochlea);<br>
endothelial lesions; diabetes (Type I or Type II) and diabetic complications<br>
(including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy); atherosclerosis; CNS<br>
related conditions; seizures; ischemia (e.g. ischemia of the central nervous system,<br>
spinal cord, brain or brain stem); dental tissue disorders (including periodontal<br>
disease); kidney diseases; haematologic manifestations (e.g., anaemia, leukopenia,<br>
thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, especially following treatment with cytostatic<br>
compounds or irradiation therapy); wounds (e.g., superficial wounds and deep<br>
wounds resulting trauma); bone fracture; erectile dysfunction; urinary bladder<br>
incontinence; neuropathic pain; subchronic and chronic inflammation; cancer;<br>
failure of bone marrow and stem cell transplantation; conditions which arise during<br>
transplantation of cells and tissues or during medical procedures such as surgery;<br>
conditions caused by an excess of reactive oxygen species and/or free radicals<br>
and/or nitric oxide; diseases or disorders of pregnancy (e.g., preeclampsia and<br>
preterm labor); female infertility; and stroke. Compounds accroding to the present<br>
teachings can also be used to induce labor (e.g., by facilitating the effect of oxytocin<br>
on uterus contraction).<br>
In one preferred aspect, the present teachings provide; a pharmacologically active<br>
antiarrhythmic compound for treatment or prevention of arrhythmias and thrombotic<br>
complications arising during cardiovascular disorders, such as acute ischemic heart<br>
disease (e.g., stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pecloris, acute myocardial<br>
infarction), congestive heart failure (e.g., systolic, diastolic, high-output, low-output,<br>
right or left sided heart failure), congenital heart diseases, cor pulmonale,<br>
cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, hypertensive heart disease, during coronary<br>
revascularization, and the like. In specific embodiments, compounds according to<br>
the present teachings can be used to treat and/or prevent bradyarrhythmias (e.g.,<br><br>
due to disease in sinus node, AV node, bundle of His, right or left bundle branch),<br>
and tachyarrhythmias associated with reentry (e.g., atrial premature complexes, AV<br>
junctional complexes, ventricular premature complexes, atrial fibrillation, atrial<br>
flutter, paroxymal supraventricular tachycardia, sinus node reentrant tachycardia,<br>
AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia).<br>
Furthermore, compounds according to the present teachings can be useful in<br>
alleviation of a pathological condition wherein slowing of conduction velocity is an<br>
important factor, e.g. ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and atrial<br>
fibrillation. Compounds according to the present teachings can be administered<br>
either alone or in combination with other antiarrhythmic compounds, such as class I<br>
agents (e.g., lidocaine), class II agents (e.g., metoprolol or propranolol), class III<br>
agents (e.g., amiodarone or sotalol) or class IV agents (e.g., verapamil).<br>
Compounds according to the present teachings can also be used to treat or prevent<br>
one or more of reentry arrhythmia, ventricular reentry (e.g., arising during acute<br>
myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction, stable angina pectoris and-<br>
unstable angina pectoris), infectious or autonomic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation,<br>
repolarization alternans, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, T-wave altemans,<br>
bradyarrhythmias, reduced contractility of cardiac tissue, thrombosis, and the like.<br>
Additional functions in which endothelialgap-junctional intercellular communication<br>
has been implicated are the migratory behavior of endothelial cells after injury,<br>
angiogenesis, endothelial growth and senescence and the coordination of<br>
vasomotor responses (Christ et al. Braz. J Med BioI.Res., 33, 423-429 (2000)).<br>
Therefore, compounds according to the present teachings can be used to enhance<br>
conducted vascular responses and to improve blood supply during conditions with<br>
increased metabolic demand (e.g., physical exercise, tachycardia), and during<br>
ischemia.<br>
Compounds according to the present teachings can be used to cytoprotect a tissue<br>
or organ of a mammal in need of such treatment. Cytoprotecting refers to reducing,<br>
preventing or alleviating symptoms associated with unwanted cell swelling.<br>
Particular tissues and organs that will benefit from the method include those    .<br>
confined or otherwise impacted by a fiborous capsule such as heart or kidney. Also<br>
included are tissues associated with bone such as brain, spinal cord and bone<br><br>
marrow. Compounds of the present teachings can be used to prevent or treat<br>
ischemic injury in the organs of a mammal in need of such treatment, including, for<br>
example, the heart, central nervous system, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, liver,<br>
lungs, and limbs.<br>
In another aspect, the present teachings provide the use of the compounds to treat<br>
or prevent haematologic manifestations following treatment with cytostatic<br>
compounds or irradiation therapy. Impaired haematopoiesis recovery is observed<br>
in patients alter 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cytostatic treatment.  This includes absence of<br>
recovery of peripheral blood counts, including severe neutropenia, severe anemia<br>
with reticulocytopenia and presence of abnormal peripheral erythrocytes and<br>
severe thrombocytopenia. In addition, 5-8-fold decreases of bone marrow<br>
cellularity and hematopoietic progenitor content (granulornacrophagic colony-<br>
forming-units (CFU-GM), erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E), mixed colony<br>
forming units (CFU-mix), and overall colony forming units (CFU-C) in bone marrow<br>
are observed. (See, e.g., Montecino-Rodriguez et al., Blood, 96, 917-924, (2000);<br>
Presley et al., Abstract #55, IGJC 2005, Whistler, Canada (2005)). Included in this<br>
aspect of the present teachings are the treatment or prevention of general clinical<br>
situations commonly associated with iatrogenic pancytopenia.<br>
Compounds according to the present teachings can be use to treat or prevent<br>
osteoporosis.  It is known that that GJIC is important in bone formation. The<br>
efficacy of the compounds can be assessed, for example, by an increase in<br>
osteoblast activity in a standard osteoblast activity assay which measures either<br>
calcium wave formation and/or alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblast cells in<br>
the presence of the compounds. Alkaline phosphatase activity also can be used to<br>
provide a measure of osteoblast activity using standard colorimetric assays.<br>
Preferably, one or more of the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
according to the present teachings are administered to an individual in need thereof<br>
in a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, "a therapeutically effective<br>
amount" refers to an amount that reduces symptoms of a given condition or<br>
pathology, and preferably which normalizes physiological responses in a subject<br>
with the condition or pathology. Reduction of symptoms or normalization of<br>
physiological responses can be determined using methods routine in the art arid<br><br>
can vary with a given condition or pathology. In one aspect, a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of one or more compounds or pharmaceutical compositions is an<br>
amount which restores a measurable physiological parameter to substantially the<br>
same value (preferably to within +30%, more preferably to within 20%, and still<br>
more preferably, to within 10% of the value) of the parameter in a subject without<br>
the condition or pathology.<br>
The effective amount will be determined by the skilled person taking into account<br>
such factors as potency of the drug, age and constitution of the patient, body<br>
weight, pharmacokinetic profile of the drug, and in general the drug will be<br>
prescribed for each patient or group of patients. However, the effective amount of<br>
the compound can be at least about 10 µg/kg body weight/day, such as at least<br>
about 100 µg/kg body weight/day, at least about 300 µg/body weight/day, and at<br>
least about 1000 µg/kg body weight/day.  On the other hand, the effective amount<br>
of the compound or dimer can be at most about 100 mg/kg body weight/day, such<br>
as at most about 50 mg/kg body weight/day and at most about 10 mg/kg body<br>
weight/day.  It is expected that the effective amount of the compound will be about<br>
100 µg/kg body weight/day, about 300 µg/kg body weight/dayor about 1000 µg/kg<br>
body weight.<br>
E.         Biological assays<br>
Preferred compounds of the present teachings can show binding, preferably<br>
specific binding, to a tissue, cell, or cell fraction in what is referred to herein as a<br>
"standard AAP site binding test". The test can detect and optionally quantify<br>
binding of a subject compound, e.g., AAP, AAP10, HP5, or a functional analogue<br>
thereof.  In one preferred embodiment, the compound can be a modulator of the<br>
function of such a tissue, cell, or cell fraction (i.e. the compound agonizes or<br>
antagonizes the function of the antiarrhythmic peptide). In another embodiment,<br>
the compound can be a modulator of a receptor for the antiarrhythmic peptide (i.e.<br>
the compound is an agonist or antagonist of the receptor). Additionally preferred<br>
compounds according to the present teachings can show good function as<br>
modulators of gap junctional communication (e.g., as agonists or antagonists of<br>
AAP). In one aspect, the compounds can function as antiarrhythmic drugs.<br><br>
Preferred agonist compounds of the present teachings can provide an intracellular<br>
conductance (Gj) that is substantially the same as, or is greater than, the G] of AAP<br>
in what is referred to herein as a "standard cardiomyocyte assay". Preferred<br>
antagonist compounds can provide a Gj that is less (e.g., at least about 10%, or at<br>
least about 20% less) than the Gj of AAP and/or block the ability of AAP to<br>
normalize the; Gj of an ischemic cell, i.e., to return the Gj to substantially the same<br>
values found in non-ischemic cells. Additionally preferred compounds according to<br>
the present teachings can increase the time to an AV block in a mouse after<br>
infusion of CaCI2, in what is referred to herein as a "standard calcium-induced .<br>
arrhythmia assay." Compounds of the present teachings can prevent cardiac<br>
conduction slowing in the presence of various form of metabolic stress (e.g.<br>
ischemia, hypoglycaemla or acidosis) in what is referred to herein as a "standard<br>
isolated atrial strip model of metabolic stress induced conduction slowing."<br>
Compounds of the present teachings can additionally show decreases in the<br>
incidence of reentry arrhythmias or in the size of an infarct zone observed in what is<br>
referred to herein as a "standard ventricular reentry assay."<br>
In some embodiments, compounds of the present teachings can exhibit a good<br>
half-life according to what is referred to herein as an "in vitro plasma stability<br>
assay". Compounds that show a good stability in the assay have in one<br>
embodiment a half-life of more than about 48 hours, or more than 24 hours, or more<br>
than 12 hours, or more than 6 hours, or more than 3 hours, or more than 1 hour, or<br>
more than 30 minutes, or more than 20 minutes, or more than 15 minutes, or more<br>
than 10 minutes, or more than 5 minutes, or more than 1 minute. In these<br>
embodiments, compounds of the present teachings can show enhanced stability in<br>
the bloodstream.<br>
Particular assays useful for identifying and optionally quantifying the activity of<br>
compounds of the present teachings are further described below.<br>
1.         Standard plasma stability assays<br>
The present teachings provide compounds that have enhanced stability in vitro or in<br>
vivo.  By way of example, compounds of the present teachings that comprise a<br>
peptide bond can be alkylated or otherwise modified to stabilize the compound<br><br>
against enzymatic degradation. Alternatively or additionally, the compounds can<br>
comprise one or more D-amino acids. It is possible to test whether a compound<br>
has enhanced stability in a standard stability assay.<br>
In one example of an in vitro plasma stability assay, compounds are incubated in<br>
plasma or serum and samples are taken at regular intervals for analysis by HPLC<br>
or LC/MS/MS, to quantitate the amount of undegraded compound. (See, e.g., WO<br>
02/077017, the entire disclosure of which is incorporarted by reference herein).<br>
Appropriate conditions (column, solvent, gradient, and temperature) for such<br>
analyses are estimated to ensure that the compound peak and the plasma peaks<br>
do not have the same retention time. This is done by subsequent injections of a<br>
compound, plasma, and a co-injection with the compound and the plasma, followed<br>
by optimization of LC method parameters until a satisfactory separation is obtained.<br>
A control plasma sample without the peptide compound, treated in the same<br>
manner, also is taken and evaluated. The samples can include, but are not limited<br>
to, a blank, the compound at a suitable concentration (e.g., 0.1 mg/mL), plasma<br>
without compound, one or more samples for t = 0, and one or more samples at<br>
each regular interval. Preferably, multiple samples are taken in parallel. The<br>
sample concentrations (peak height in mAU or ion counts) are plotted vs. time and<br>
fitted to a function describing a mono exponential decay (e.g., using a standard<br>
Excel package)-  Preferably, a compound according to the present teachings has a<br>
half-life of more than about 30 minutes (e.g., more than about 1 hour, or more than<br>
about 3 hours, or more than about 6 hours, or more than about 12 hours, or more<br>
than about 24 hours, or more than about 48 hours) as determined using this assay.<br>
Plasma stability can be examined in vivo using standard assays. For example,<br>
compounds can be administered to a mammal, such as a rat, by bolus injections in<br>
volumes of about 1 ml/kg for both i.v. and p.o. dosing.  Preferably, compounds are<br>
tested in parallel with control samples such as buffer or an antiarrythmic peptide<br>
with a known stability. Blood samples are collected at different time periods (e.g.,<br>
at B.D. 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes, where B.D. refers to before<br>
dose). Amounts of compounds in samples can be quantified using methods of<br>
routine in the art, such as LC/MS/MS. For example, the concentrations of<br>
compounds in plasma samples can be calculated from an external standard curve<br>
covering concentration ranges of compound from 1.00 to 1000 nM. The plasma<br><br>
concentrations versus time data can be used for pharmacokinetic modelling in<br>
WinNonLin 3.5 (Pharsight, Mountain view, CA) using non-compartmental analysis<br>
and the resulting parameters of AUC, Fpo, Clb, t1/2, Cmax and tmax can be<br>
determined as is known in the art.<br>
2.         Standard cardiomyocyte assays<br>
Compounds of the present teachings can be tested in a cardiomyocyte assay,<br>
which measures the gap junction function of cardiac cells after administration of the<br>
compounds. In one exmaple, cardiac cells are isolated from a mammal, such as a<br>
guinea pig hearts, by perfusion with collagenase according to the Langendorf<br>
method. The cells are exposed to compound and evaluated for GJIC by patch<br>
clamp using methods known in the art. Intercellular conductance (Gj) is calculated<br>
using the formula:<br><br>
where Ip,pulse and Ip,rest represent the current in the passive cell during the pulse<br>
and before the pulse respectively, and Up and Ua represent the voltage of the<br>
passive and sactive cell. The change in Gj value upon compound administration is<br>
analyzed by comparing the relative changes in Gj. For example, the relative Gj as<br>
a function of time before, and during, stimulation with compound (e.g., at about 10'8<br>
M) can be determined.  Preferably, the compound provides a Gj, which is<br>
substantially the same as the Gj (+ 10%) of an antiarrhythmic peptide such as AAP,<br>
AAP10, HP5, and functional analogues thereof.  In one example, the cell is an<br>
ischemic cell, and the compound provides a Gj, which is substantially the same as<br>
that of a non-ischemic cell (+20%, preferably, + 10%). Additional details concerning<br>
performing cardiomyocyte assays are provided in WO 02/077017.<br>
3.         Standard calcium-induced arrhythmia assay<br>
Peptides suitable for administration to cardiac cells can be identified in an in vivo<br>
model of calcium-induced arrhythmias according to the model of Lynch et al. (1981)<br>
J Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 3: 49-60. Male CD-1 mice are anaesthetized with<br>
Ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (1 mg/kg) IP. An i.v. cannula is inserted<br>
into the tail vein. A lead II ECG signal is recorded continuously by positioning<br>
stainless steel ECG electrodes on the right forelimb and left forelimb. The ground<br>
electrode is placed on the right hind limb. The signal is amplified and filtered using<br><br>
Gould physiograph components and po-ne-mah data acquisition software.   After a<br>
90 sec equilibration period test compound is injected into the tail vein (over 30<br>
seconds). Mice pre-treated with vehicle are tested as control animals. The<br>
injection volume is 100µl / 30g mice in all experiments. Infusion of CaCI2 (30<br>
mg/mL, 0.1 mL/min/30g mice, 100 mg/kg/min) is started 3 min after IV<br>
administration of drug or vehicle (0.9% saline). The time lag to onset of cardiac<br>
conduction block is determined as the time from the start of CaCI2 infusion until the<br>
first arrhythmic event occured. The first conduction block is defined as the first RR-<br>
interval, larger than or equal to 3 times one RR-interval from the pre-treatment<br>
period. The first arrhythmic event occurring is either a second degree AV-block<br>
(intermittent failure of the AV conduction characterized by a P-wave without the<br>
concomitant QRS complex) or a second degree SA block (prolonged RR-interval<br>
and a QRS-complex without a preceding P-wave). Responses are expressed<br>
relative to the time until 2nd degree AV-block occurred in vehicle treated mice.<br>
4.	Standard isolated atrial strip model of metabolic stress induced<br>
conduction slowing<br>
Peptides suitable for administration to cardiac cells can be identified in an in vitro<br>
model as described by Haugan et al. (J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol., 16, 537-545<br>
(2005)).<br>
Rats (300-400 g) are killed by a sharp blow on the neck. The heart is rapidly<br>
excised and transferred to a small dish containing 37° oxygenated modified<br>
Tyrodes buffer containing (in mM): NaCI 136, KCI 4, MgCI2 0.8, CaCI2 1.8 HEPES<br>
5,	MES 5, Glucose 6, pH 7.3. The left atrium is carefully dissected and a tissue<br>
sample of approximately 2x6 mm is taken from the left atrial appendage and placed<br>
in a tissue chamber (volume 5 ml), (Steiert Organ Bath, Hugo Sach Electronic,.<br>
Germany). The chamber is perfused throughout the study with 37°C oxygenated<br>
Tyrodes buffer at a rate of 10 ml/min.<br>
A bipolar stimulation electrode (Teflon coated stainless steel, diameter 75 uM) is<br>
placed at one end of the tissue. Stimulation is performed at 1 Hz using rectangular<br>
pulses at double threshold (duration of stimulus 0.2 ms) delivered by a stimulator<br>
(Hugo Sachs, Type 215) through an isolation unit (Universal Isolated Stimulator<br>
Unit type 263, Hugo Sachs, Germany).<br><br>
Two separate microelectrodes of pure iridium (World Precision Instruments, tip-<br>
impedance 3.5-4.0 MQ) are placed on a line along the long-axis of the preparation<br>
for recording of atrial CV. The distances from the stimulating electrode to the first<br>
and second microelectrode is 1.5-2.0 mm and 3.0-4.0 mm, respectively. Each<br>
microelectrode is connected to a head-stage preamplifier (10x amplification of the<br>
signals). The preamplifiers are connected to a bio potential amplifier module that is<br>
connected to the data acquisition system through a Hugo Sachs PLUGSYS.<br>
Signals are filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.<br>
Following a 30 minutes equilibration period, pacing at 1 Hz is initiated. During the<br>
first 20 minutes recording period (baseline period), the chamber is perfused with<br>
37°C oxygenated Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.3. Compounds (e.g., modified lysine<br>
mimetic compounds of the present teachings, AAP, AAP10 or controls) are then<br>
added to the perfusion buffer for another 20 minute period (pre-treatment period).<br>
Following the 20 minutes of pretreatment, perfusion is changed to a 37°C glucose-<br>
free, non-oxygenated Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.3 (with or without compounds of<br>
interest) for 40 minutes (metabolic stress period).<br>
The change in conduction velocity during metabolic stress is compared to a group<br>
of untreated controls.  In untreated preparations, conduction decreases by 15-45%<br>
during the 40 minute period of metabolic stress. In some embodiments,<br>
compounds according to the present teachings can prevent metabolic stress<br>
induced conduction slowing during the 40 minutes period comparable to the<br>
compounds AAP, AAP10, HP5, or a functional analogue thereof, i.e., the<br>
compounds can preserve normal conduction during an episode of metabolic stress.<br>
5.	Haematologic assay<br>
Compounds of the present teachings can also be tested to determine their effects in<br>
accelerating recovery following 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induced stress on bone<br>
marrow proliferation. Male rats are treated with 5-FU (75-100 nmol/kg i.p.) for 4<br>
days.  Blood samples are collected from tail tip before 5-FU treatment (Day 0), and<br>
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 days following first 5-FU dose. Measurement of peripheral<br>
blood counts (granulocytes, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, reticulocytes)<br>
and plasma haemoglobin are taken. After identification of window with severe<br>
pancytopenia, the study is repeated during concomitant treatment with a compound<br>
of the present teachings.<br><br>

1.	General peptide synthesis<br>
Compounds of the present teachings can be prepared using the method of<br>
synthesis disclosed, for example, in WO 98/11125 (the entire disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein). Said methods of synthesis will result in a    <br>
primary peptide or peptide like product having a trifluoroacetate counterion and<br>
which can be suitable for the preparation of a medicament.  In some instances,<br>
however, it can be advantageous to perform a counter ion exchange from<br>
trifluoroacetate to a pharmaceutically acceptable or preferred anion (e.g., acetate)<br>
by, for example, ion exchange chromatography. Alternatively, the primary peptide<br>
or peptide like product can be repeatedly freeze dried and dissolved in diluted<br>
hydrochloric acid to obtain the purified hydrochloride.<br>
Apparatus and synthetic strategy<br>
When using solid phase methodology, the modified peptides were synthesized<br>
batchwise in a polyethylene vessel equipped with a polypropylene filter for filtration<br>
using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and tert.-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or<br>
otherwise suitable protecting groups for the N-amino and the side chain<br>
functionalities such as AllyI, Alloc, Dde, Z etc.. When using solution phase<br>
techniques, the modified peptides were synthesized using standard equipment<br>
throughout the syntheses.<br>

100 MB/H strong acid, Bayer AG Leverkusen, Germany) and analyzed for free<br><br>
amines prior to use by addition of 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazine<br>
(Dhbt-OH) giving rise to a yellow colour (Dhbt-O- anion) if free amines are present.<br>

Haen, Frankfurt, Germany. 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) was purchased<br>
from Fluka, Switzerland and used as a catalyst in coupling reactions involving<br>
symmetrical anhydrides. Ethandithiol and Thioanisol were purchased from Riedel-<br>

from the appropriate N-D-protected amino acid and the subsequent amino acids<br>
can be coupled as in situ generated HOBt or HOAt esters made from appropriate<br><br>
N--protected amino acids and HOBt or HOAt by means of DIC in DMF. The<br>
acylations were checked by the ninhydrin test performed al 80°C in order to prevent<br>
Fmoc deprotection during the test (B. D. Larsen, A. Holm, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res.,<br>
43, 1-9(1994)).<br>

consisting of a HP 1100 Quaternary Pump, a HP 1100 Autosampler a HP 1100<br>
Column Thermostat and HP 1100 Multiple Wavelength Detector.  Hewlett Packard<br>
Chemstation for LC software (rev. A.06.01) was used for instrument control and<br><br>
data acquisition. For analytical HPLC, different columns were used as appropriate,<br>
such as VYDAC 238TP5415, C-18, 5µm, 300A, or a Jupiter, Phenomenex 00F-<br>
4053-EO; 5 µm C-18, 300A 150 x 4,6 mm and others. The buffer system included<br>

Mass Spectroscopy<br>
The peptides were dissolved in super gradient methano! (Labscan, Dublin, Ireland),<br>
Milli-Q water (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and formic acid (Merck, Damstadt, Germany)<br>
(50:50:0.1 v/v/v) to give concentrations between 1 and 10 mg/ml. The peptide<br>
solutions (20 ml) were analysed in positive polarity mode by ESI-TOF-MS using a<br>
LCT mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) accuracy of +/- 0.1 m/z.<br>
Solid phase synthesis<br>
In all syntheses, dry resin was placed in a polyethylene vessel equipped with a<br>
polypropylene filter for filtration. The resin was swelled in DMF.  The first amino<br>
acid was coupled either as a preformed symmetrical anhydride or as a preactivated<br>
HOBt ester as described above. The following amino acid according to the<br>
sequence was coupled as a preformed HObt ester as described above. All<br>
couplings were continued for at least 2 hours unless otherwise specified. Coupling<br>
of the benzoic acid derivative to the side-chain amino functionality on the lysine<br>
mimetic amino acid was in all cases performed using a preformed HObt-ester. The<br>
final peptide product were cleaved from the solid support and analysed by HPLC<br>
and MS as described above.<br>
In all cases the benzoic acid derivative is functionalised as a carboxylic acid and<br>
was coupled as an in situ generated HOBt ester by means of DIC in THF.<br>
All couplings were continued for at least 2 hours. The acylations were checked by<br>
the ninhydrin test performed at 80 °C as earlier described. After completed<br>
synthesis the peptide-resin was washed with DMF (3x 15 ml, 1 min each), DCM (3x<br>
15 ml, 1 min each), diethyl ether (3x 15 ml, 1 min each) and dried in vacuo. The<br>

after adding Dhbt-OH to the drained DMF.  (2S4R) Boc-4Amp(Fmoc)-OH was<br>
coupled as symmetrical anhydride as follows.<br>
3eq (2S4R) Boc-4Amp(Fmoc)-OH was dissolved in DCM and cooled to 0°C. DIG<br>
(1.5 eq.) was added and the reaction continued for 10 minutes. The solvent was<br>
removed in vacuo and the residue dissolved in DMF. The solution was immediately<br>
added to the resin followed by 0.1 eq. of DMAP. The coupling was continued over<br>
night. Excess; coupling reagent was removed by washing with DMF.  Deprotection<br>
of the Fmoc group was performed by treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF (1x5<br>
and 1x10 min.), followed by washing with DMF until no yellow colour could be<br>
detected after addition of Dhbt-OH to the drained DMF.<br>
Coupling of benzoic acid was carried out as follows. 3 eq. benzoic acid was<br>
dissolved in DMF together with 3 eq. HOBt and 3 eq. DIC and then added to the<br>
resin. The coupling was continued over night. Excess coupling reagent was<br>
removed by washing with DMF. Prior to the deprotection of the Boc group the resin<br>
was treated with DCM. Deprotection of the Boc group was performed by treatment<br>
with 50% TFA in DCM v/v (2 x 2min, 1 x 30 min) followed by washing with DCM<br>
and then with DMF and then treatment with 5% DIEA in DMF v/v and finally<br>
followed by washing with DMF.<br>
Coupling of Boc-Gly-OH was carried out as follows. 3 eq. Boc-Gly-OH was<br>
dissolved in DMF together with 3 eq. HOBt and 3 eq. DIC and then added to the<br>
resin. The coupling was continued 2 hours. Excess coupling reagent was removed<br>
by washing with DMF. The coupling was repeated and continued over night.  Before<br><br>
cleavage of thes peptide from the solid support the peptide resin was washed with<br>
DCM and then with ether and finally dried under vacuum.<br>
Cleavage of the dipeptide from the PAM-Resin was carried out as follows. The<br>
peptide-resin was treated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Riedel-de Haen) and after<br>
10 min a volume corresponding to 10% of the TFA total volume of<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA, Aldrich) was added at room temperature and<br>
the reaction WEIS continued for 2 hours. The filtered resins were washed with TFA.<br>
The raw material was precipitated from the TFA-solution by adding diethylether.<br>
The raw material was collected as a brown oil. The ether solution was further<br>
extracted with water and the water phase was evaporated. The total amount of raw<br>

G.         Biological assay data<br>
1.	Effect of the compounds on calcium induced arrhythmias<br>
The anti-arrhythmic effect of compounds according to the present teachings was<br>
tested in a model of calcium-induced arrhythmias according to the model of Lynch<br>
et al., J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. (1981), 3: 49-60.   Male CD-1 mice were<br>
anaesthetized with Ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (1 mg/kg) IP. An i.v.<br>
cannula was inserted into the tail vein. A lead II ECG signal was recorded<br>
continuously by positioning stainless steel ECG electrodes on the right forelimb and<br>
leftforelimb. The ground electrode was placed on the right hind limb. The signal<br>
was amplified and filtered using Gould physiograph components and po-ne-mah<br>
data acquisition software.   After a 90 sec equilibration period test compound was<br>
injected into the tail vein (over 30 seconds). Mice pre-treated with vehicle (0.9%<br>
saline) were tested as control animals. The injection volume was 100µl / 30g mice<br>
in all experiments. Infusion of CaCI2 (30 mg/mL, 0.1 mL/min/30g mice, 100<br>
mg/kg/min) was started 3 min after IV administration of drug or vehicle. The time<br>
lag to onset of cardiac conduction block was determined as the time from the start<br>
of CaCI2 infusion until the first arrhythmic event occured. The first conduction block<br>
was defined as the first RR-interval, larger/or equal to, 3 times one RR-interval from<br>
the pre-treatment period. The first arrhythmic event occurring was either a second<br>
degree AV-block (intermittent failure of the AV conduction characterized by a P-<br>
wave without the concomitant QRS complex) or a second degree SA block<br>
(prolonged RR-interval and a QRS-complex without a preceding P-wave).<br><br>
Mice pre-treated with vehicle (0.9% saline) were tested on all days as a measure<br>
for control level in untreated animal. Injection volume was 100 µL in all<br>
experiments. The time lag to onset of arrhythmias was determined as the time from<br>
the start of CaCI2 infusion until the first event of conduction block defined as<br>
intermittent failure of the SA or AV conduction characterized by delayed P-wave<br>
activation (SA block) or by a P-wave without the concomitant QRS complex (AV<br>
block). The time lag to onset of AV block is given below in Table 2.<br><br>
It follows from the data presented in Table 2 that pre-treatment of a mouse with a<br>
range of compounds of the present teachings resulted in a consistent increase in<br>
the time to an AV block in the mouse after infusion of CaCI2. Compounds of the<br>
present teachings thus exhibit anti-arrhythmic properties.<br><br>
2.         Effect of the compounds on metabolic stress induced atrial<br>
conduction slowing<br>
The ability to maintain conduction during metabolic stress was tested in an in vitro<br>
model as described by Haugan et al (J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol., 2005:16:537-<br>
545). Rats (300-400 g) were killed by a sharp blow on the neck. The heart was<br>
rapidly excised and transferred to a small dish containing 37° oxygenated modified<br>
Tyrodes buffer containing (in mM): NaCI 136, KCI 4. MgCI2 0.8, CaCI2 1.8 HEPES<br>
5, MES 5, Glucose 6, pH 7.3.  The left atrium was carefully dissected and a tissue<br>
sample of approximately 2x6 mm was taken from the left atrial appendage and<br>
placed in a tissue chamber (volume 5 ml), (Steiert Organ Bath, Hugo Sach<br>
Electronic, Germany). The chamber was perfused throughout the study with 37°C<br>
Tyrodes buffer at a rate of 10 ml/min.<br>
A bipolar stimulation electrode (Teflon coated stainless steel, diameter 75 uM) was<br>
placed at one end of the tissue. Stimulation was performed at 1 Hz using <br>
rectangular pulses at double threshold (duration of stimulus 0.2 ms) delivered by a<br>
stimulator (Hugo Sachs, Type 215) through an isolation unit (Universal Isolated<br>
Stimulator Unit type 263, Hugo Sachs, Germany).<br>
Two separate microelectrodes of pure iridium (World Precision Instruments, tip-<br>
impedance 3.!5-4.0 MO.) were placed on a line along the long-axis of the preparation<br>
for recording of atrial CV. The distances from the stimulating electrode to the first<br>
and second microelectrode is 1.5-2.0 mm and 3.0-4.0 mm, respectively. Each<br>
microelectrode was connected to a head-stage preamplifier (10x amplification of the<br>
signals). The preamplifiers were connected to a bio potential amplifier module that<br>
was connected to the data acquisition system through a Hugo Sachs PLUGSYS.<br>
Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz.<br>
Following a 30 minute equilibration period, pacing at 1 Hz was initiated.  During the<br>
first 20 minute recording period (baseline period), the chamber was perfused with<br>
37°C oxygenated Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.3. Then the test sample (Compound 2) or<br>
control was added to the perfusion buffer for another 20 minute period (pre-<br>
treatment period). Following the 20 minutes of pretreatment, perfusion was<br>
changed to a 37°C glucose-free, non-oxygenated Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.3 (with or<br>
without compounds of interest) for 40 minutes (metabolic stress period). The .<br>
results of these experiments are shown graphically in Figure 1.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, in preparations containing the control, conduction velocity<br>
decreased by 22%. In contrast, in preparations treated with Compound 2, atrial<br>
conduction velocity did not change compared to baseline.<br>
It follows from the data presented in Figure 1 that pre-1reatment of an isolated rat<br>
atrial strip with a compound of the present teachings significantly prevented<br>
metabolic stress induced cardiac conduction slowing. Cardiac diseases such as<br>
atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are all<br>
characterized by the presence of abnormal cardiac conduction slowing. Thus,<br>
through the effect on cardiac conduction, compounds of the present teachings are<br>
expected to exert anti-arrhythmic effects.<br>
3.         Plasma Stability Assay<br>
To predict its plasma stability, compounds of the present teachings were incubated<br>
in male rat plasma (1:1 plasma: pH 7.4 buffer) at 1 µM concentration at 37°C. After<br>
3 hours, the reaction was quenched with cold acetonitrile. The solution was<br>
centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed with LC-MS using the following<br>
HPLC conditions: Thermo Hypersii-Keystone Aquasil C18 column (50mm x 2.1mm,<br>
5µM) at ambient temperature; Solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in water; Solvent B:<br>
0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile; solvent gradient: 100% A to 50% A over 2.5 min, to<br>
10% A over 1.5 min, and returning to 100% A and re-equilibrating for 1.5 min;<br>
flowrate: 0.8 mL/min. The percent of the compound remaining was calculated by<br>
dividing the 3-hour incubation sample LC-MS signal area counts by the time = 0<br>
area counts. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
4.	Metabolic Stability Assay<br>
To predict the stability of the compound under first pass (Phase I) metabolism,<br>
compounds of the present teachings were incubated with male rat liver microsomes<br>
at 1 µM concentration and 0.5 mg/mL protein concentration at 37°C. After 15 min,<br>
the reaction was quenched with cold acetonitrile. The solution was centrifuged and<br>
the supernatant was analyzed with LC-MS using the HPLC conditions described in<br>
section 3 above. The percent remaining was calculated by dividing the 15-minute<br>
incubation sample LC-MS area counts by the time = 0 area counts, and the half-life<br>
of the compound was derived using first-order reaction kinetics.  Based on this<br>
assay. Compounds 2, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 80, 81, 82, 83 and 84<br>
had half-lives greater than 30 minutes in male rat liver microsomes.<br><br>
5.	Canine Infarct Size and Reperfusion Arrhythmia Model<br>
Compound 2 was teste:d in dogs subjected to a 60-min coronary artery occlusion<br>
and 4 hr reperfusion, as described by Hennan et al. (J. Exp. Pharmacol. Ther.,317,<br>
236-43 (2006)). Compound 2 was administered IV 10-min before reperfusion as a<br>
bolus + IV infusion at doses of: 0.25 µg/kg bolus + 0.19 µg/kg/hr infusion (n=6); 2.5<br>
µg/kg bolus + 1.9 µg/kg/hr infusion (n=7); 25 µg/kg bolus + 19 µg/kg/hr infusion<br>
(n=6); 75 µg/kg bolus + 57 µg/kg/hr infusion (n=5); vehicle control (n=7). Premature<br>
ventricular complexes (PVC's) were quantified during reperfusion.  Four or more<br>
consecutive PVC's was defined as ventricular tachycardia (VT). Total incidence of<br>
VT was reduced significantly with the two highest doses of Compound 2 (1.7±0.8;<br>
2.2±1.4 events; p
reduced significantly from 11.1±1.6% in control animals to 2.0±0.7% and 1.8±0.8%<br>
after the two highest doses of Compound 2.  Infarct size, expressed as percent of<br>
left ventricle, was reduced significantly from 19.0±3.5 in controls to 7.9±1.5 and<br>
7.1 ±0.8% (p
demonstrate that compounds of the present teachings are potent antiarrhythmic<br>
compounds with cardioprotective effects.<br>
6.         In Vitro Cell Swelling and Dye Uptake Model<br>
Peptides capable of demonstrating cytoprotection can be identified in an in vitro<br>
model of ischemia induced cell swelling and dye uptake. In this experiment, the<br>
effect of Compound 2 on calcein dye-uptake induced by metabolic inhibition in<br>
cultured C6 glioma cells overexpressing connexin43 was studied. Cells were<br>
incubated under control conditions and during simulated ischemia (SI) for 40<br>
minutes in the presence of calcein (200 uM).  Following incubation the cells were<br>
subjected to epifluorescence microscopy to determine the uptake of calcein.<br>
Incubation of C6 cells in SI medium increased dye-uptake to 5-fold above control<br>
values.  The uptake was dose-dependently inhibited by Compound 2, and minimum<br>
uptake was obtained at 100 uM Compound 2 (32% relative reduction of the SI<br>
inducible response; p
