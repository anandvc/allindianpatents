				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a frame structure for a motor scooter having a low floor board in a longitudinally middle portion thereof, having a rear section obliquely upwardly extending behind the floor board.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Related Art]<br>
As mentioned in JP-A No. 58-67579 (Fig. 27) and JP-U No. 63-51886, in a conventional motor scooter provided with a low floor board 01, a rear frame 03, i.e., a rear section of a main frame 02, is raised from a position of the main frame 02 behind the floor board 01 and is bent so that a horizontal rear section 04 of the rear frame 03 extends rearward, and functional parts 05 including electrical parts are attached to the horizontal rear section 04 of the rear frame 03.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention] Only lightweight functional parts 05 and a rear cover 06 are attached to a rear end portion 04a of the horizontal rear section 04 of the rear frame 03 of the motor scooter shown in Fig. 27, extending rearward from a position at which a shock absorber support rod 07 is attached to the rear frame 03, and any heavy parts are<br>
not loaded thereon. Therefore, the rear end portion 04a need not be as strong as a front portion 04b extending forward from the position at which a shock absorber support rod 07 is attached to the rear frame 03. However, since the rear end portion 04a of the horizontal rear section 04 has the same cross section as that of the front portion 04b, the rear frame 03 is relatively heavy.<br>
[0004]<br>
Since it is difficult to attach the functional parts 05 and the rear cover 06 directly to the tubular rear frame 03, the rear frame 03 needs to be provided with stays 07 and 08, which increases the number of parts and the number of machining steps, and entails unavoidable increase in the cost.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem and Effect]<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome such disadvantages and to provide an improved motor scooter frame structure having a main frame, for a motor scooter having a low floor board disposed on a longitudinally middle section of the main frame, a power unit disposed under a rear section of the main frame, obliquely upwardly extending behind the floor board, and<br>
a shock absorber having one end connected to the rear section of the main frame and the other end connected to the power unit, wherein a heavy portion of the main frame between a position on the middle section of the main frame behind the floor board and a position on the rear section of the main frame at which the one end of the shock absorber is connected to the rear section of the main frame is formed from a hollow member having a high rigidity, and a portion of the rear section of the main frame extending behind the position on the rear section of the main frame at which the one end of the shock absorber is connected to the rear section of the main frame is a subframe formed by molding a lightweight material, such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy or a synthetic resin.<br>
[0006]<br>
Since the heavy portion of the main frame between a position on the middle section of the main frame behind the floor board and the position on the rear section of the main frame at which the one end of the shock absorber is connected to the rear section of the main frame is formed from a hollow member having a high rigidity, a high reaction force of a rear wheel can surely be sustained by the main frame.<br>
[0007]<br>
Since the portion of the rear section of the main frame extending behind the position on the rear section of the main frame at which the one end of the shock absorber is connected to the rear section of the main frame is a subframe formed by molding a lightweight material, such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy or a synthetic resin, and functional parts including electrical equipment are mounted on the subframe, any special parts for attaching the functional parts are not necessary, the functional parts can easily and firmly be attached to the main frame in places an in positions suitable for the shapes and functions of the functional parts.<br>
[0008]<br>
Since the heavy portion of the main frame on which a large load is applied through the shock absorber is formed from a hollow member having a high rigidity, and the portion of the main frame on which not very heavy functional parts are mounted is a molded subframe of a lightweight material, the strength and rigidity of the main frame are distributed rationally to construct the body of the motor scooter in a compact, lightweight structure at a low cost.<br>
[0009]<br>
Since the hollow main frame has a rectangular cross section as stated in claim 3, the hollow main frame has an increased bending rigidity an increased torsional rigidity.<br>
[0010]<br>
Sine the subframe is provided integrally with the carrier holding stays as stated in claim 4, a carrier can easily and firmly attached to the subframe.<br>
[0011]<br>
Since the front end portion of the subframe is fixedly inserted in a rear open end portion of the hollow main frame as stated in claim 5, the subframe can easily be attached to and detached from the hollow main frame, and can firmly be joined to the hollow main frame.<br>
[0012]<br>
Since the subframe is provided with a seat locking member as stated in claim 6, a seat hinged on the main frame so as to be turned in a vertical plane can be locked.<br>
[0013]<br>
Since a front end portion of the subframe is fastened together with a fuel tank attaching parts to<br>
the main frame as stated in.claim 7, a fuel tank can firmly be fastened to a joint of the maimframe and the subframe when joining together the subframe and the main frame.<br>

fitting arm 56b of the carrier 56, a cushioning rubber 58, the hole 50h of the body cover 50 and the hole 361 of the rear end portion 36k of the subframe 36, and a nut 60 is screwed on a threaded portion of the bolt 59 to fasten the carrier 56 together with the body cover 50 to the subframe 36.<br>
[0035]<br>
A seat 61 is hinged to the front end of the fuel tank 37 for turning in a vertical plane.  As shown in Fig. 24, a U-shaped shackle 62 is attached to the rear end of the seat 61 so as to project downward. As shown in Figs. 19 and 24, a seat locking mechanism 63 having a catching member 63a that catches the shackle 62 is mounted on the subframe 36. Holes 63c are formed one behind the other in a base 63b, holes 36m are formed one behind the other in a portion of the subframe 36 on the inner side of the left raised part 36h of the subframe 36, bolts 64 are inserted through the holes 36m and 63c from below, and nuts 65 are screwed on threaded portions of the bolts 64 to fasten the seat locking mechanism 63 to the subframe 36. As shown in Fig. 25, circular holes 36n and 50j are formed respectively in the subframe 36 and the body cover 50 to extend a cylinder 63d of the seat locking mechanism 63 therethrough.<br>
[0036]<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, an ignition coil 66 is mounted on the ignition coil support stay 20. As shown in Figs. 15 and 19, a bolt 68 is inserted through a hole 36p formed in a portion of the subframe 36 behind the upper cylindrical portions 36i, and a nut 69 is screwed on a threaded portion of the bolt 68.  As shown in Figs. 15, 19, 25 and 26, a leg 70a of a resistor holder for holding a resistor 70 is put to a support lug projecting downward from a position behind the hole 36p of the subframe 36 and in a right side portion of the subframe 36 so that a hole 70b formed in the leg 70a coincides with a recess 36q formed in the support lug, a bolt 71 is inserted through the recess 36q and the hole 70b, and a nut 72 is screwed on a threaded portion of the bolt 71 to fasten the leg 70a of the resistor holder to the subframe 36.<br>
[0037]<br>
A U-shaped theft-proof hook 73 is attached by welding or the like to one side surface of the lower curved section 7d of the rear frame 7.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 26, the rear frame 7 of the main frame is a hollow member having<br>
a cross section of large dimensions.  Therefore, a high reaction force of the rear wheel 4 exerted through the rear shock absorber 26 to the shock absorber support shaft 19 can surely be sustained by the rear frame 7.<br>
[0039]<br>
The aluminum subframe 36 can firmly be joined to the hollow rear frame 7 by inserting the front end portion of the subframe 36 in the rear end portion of the rear frame 7/ and fastening the subframe 36 to the rear frame 7 at three positions with the bolts 40 and 41 and nuts 42.<br>
[0040]<br>
The cast aluminum subframe 36 is lightweight and can easily be formed in a shape suitable for attaching parts including the nut 48, the body cover 50, the carrier 56, the seat locking mechanism 63, a regulator 67 and the resistor 70 to the subframe 36. The number of fitting parts is reduced, and the subframe 36 can be formed in a small size at a low cost.<br>
[0041]<br>
Since the carrier 56 is fastened together with the body cover 50 to the subframe 36, the body cover 50 and the carrier 56 can be fastened to the subframe 36<br>
with a small number of fitting parts by reduced man-hours/ which contributes to the reduction of the costs.<br>
[0042]<br>
Since the rear portion of the fuel tank 37 is attached together with the front end portion 36a of the<br>
«<br>
subframe 36 to the rear end portion 7e of the rear frame 7, the number of parts and assembling man-hours can be reduced.<br>
[0043]<br>
The aluminum subframe 36 does not need to be finished by a surface treatment process and improves the dissipation of heat generated by the electrical equipment including the regulator 67 and the resistor 70.<br>
