				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a dosage formulation or tablet comprising a mixed:-matrix of hydrophilic and lipopbilic components able to control the release rate of one or more therapeutically active agents from the formulation/tablet.<br>
Recent years have seen considerable efforts made in the pharmaceutical technology field of research aimed at preparing innovative pharmaceutical forms, meant for the administration of active substances, both in human treatment and the veterinary field. One of the fundamental aspects of the innovative qualities of pharmaceutical dosage forms and/or prepared formulation systems is the potential targeting the release of the drug (or the active substance) to a specific site of action and/or of releasing such active substances with an a priori programmable velocity which can be assessed by way of suitable "in vitro" tests.<br>
• /<br>
Other sectors are also interested in these technical fields, not just the human health sector, namely- veterinary and agricultural sectors, especially with regard to the controlled release of fertilisers, weedkillers, insecticides and/or specific protection agents for certain cultures.<br>
.	f~<br>
There are many examples in the pharmaceutical sector which describe the preparation of pharmaceutical forms capable of releasing the active principle (active substance)<br>
)   •<br>
with zero kinetics. As is well known to experts in the field, this means that the active principle carried is given up by tbe pharmaceutical form at a constant velocity through time and for a programmable time period. In particular, the release of a drug can be expressed by the following empirical relation:<br>
the fraction of drug released (Mt/Mo) is proportional to a constant K which depends on the diffusion coefficient in the matrix, whereas the constant n depends on the swelling characteristics and the relaxation velocity of the polymeric chains on the swelling<br><br>
front. There are many examples of such pharmaceutical forms, for example, is quoted in the volume of S. Dimitriu "Polysaccharides in medical applications" M. Dekker, New York 1996.<br>
There are many examples and pharmaceutical applications that concern dosage forms utilisable for different administration forms namely oral, transdermal, vaginal and ocular. Certainly, given the extreme importance and the widespread use of oral drug administration, the more numerous and differentiated embodiments are those aimed at releasing the active principle in the gastrointestinal tract, for example, the OROS system described in US 4,160,020.<br>
Further progress in this field is also provided by the pharmaceutical oral dosage forms described in US 4,839,177 and US 5,422,123 (equivalent to EP-A-0226884 and EP-A-0432607 respectively) which describes the preparation of pharmaceutical forms for<br>
/<br>
oral use capable of guaranteeing the liberation of an active principle at a constant release velocity, i.e. according to zero kinetics (n=0 in the above formula). In particular, these documents describe the preparation of a therapeutic system consisting, in its simplest form, a hydrophilic matrix containing a drug and suitable excipients, capable of allowing the release of the active principle at varied rates (i.e. at controlled rates of release).<br>
Constituent components important in causing the slowed release of the active principle are the hydrophilic polymers, which may be gellable, and are capable of swelling upon contact with water and/or aqueous fluids, forming a gelled layer from which the active principle spreads according to Fickian type kinetics.<br>
The therapeutic system described above in US 4,839,177 and US 5,422,123 is characterised in that one part of said matrix is covered by an impermeable barrier (obtained by the application of a polymeric film which is insoluble in water and aqueous medium as in US 4,839,177 or in that a layer of material and/or a polymeric material mix is applied by compression (possibly granulates obtained in accordance with known techniques) thus giving impermeability and/or, in any case, impeding the<br><br>
release of the drug carded in the matrix form the protected surface for a predeterminable time period (as in US 5,422,123). The result is that the release of the active principle carried in the hydrophilic matrix only occurs from the free surface of: the layer containing the active substance in direct contact with the dissolution medium. Such a system is characterised in that the active principle, carried in said pharmaceutical forms, is given up at a velocity which generally proves constant over time (zero release kinetics) as is highlighted in the claims of the cited patent.<br>
Other tablet formulations have provided for the liberation of one or more drags at different release rates (WO 94/06416) by appropriate formulation of the layers in the multi-layer tablet. Alternative phased drug release systems have described the use of<br>
i<br>
an impermeable' membrane to control the time of drug release (US 5,487,901), a complete coat of a biodegradable polymeric material (US 6,027,748), or a more substantial layer of controlled permeability materials (EP-A-0788790). Still further multi-layer tablets have been described in which the tablet shows a high volume increase on contact with the contents of the stomach so as to provide for prolonged gastric residence times (EP-A-0795324).<br>
However, in many treatment protocols, the patient must take drugs for extended time periods, for chronic disease treatment and must follow, at times, complex posological patterns, taking two or more pharmaceutical forms over 24 hours. Such complex and distinct therapeutic models are poorly supported and infrequently followed by non-hospitalised patients; in fact, the withdrawal of the correct observance of the posological models is very frequent and well known in'the case of outpatients, and such a withdrawal is directly proportional to the complexity and number of administrations required or recommended during the day. For example, in the treatment of chronic diseases, for example hypertension the posology of the drugs must be adjusted in relation to the seriousness of the pathology and hence personalised to the specific therapeutic needs of the individual concerned.<br>
Of importance to many pathological models, is the request by the medical profession to make available pharmaceutical forms with a very differentiated active principle<br><br>
content (so as to favour the personalisation of the posology), which however are able to release the drug with similar or equivalent velocity and release kinetics, independent from the amount of active substance carried.<br>
Therefore the availability of pharmaceutical forms which can release different dosages of the same drug at the same or similar velocity would provide the medical profession with a solution, to an important therapeutic problem, of major social relevance for the type of therapy at which it is directed. Such dosage forms would allow for the optimisation of drug use and biologically active substances in general.<br>
It has now been discovered that utilising a particular formulation and pharmaceutical form consisting of a multi-layer tablet, preferably containing two or three layers, it is possible to obtain a similar or identical release velocity, even if said tablet carries very<br>
different amounts of the same active substance.<br>
/<br>
The originality of the new, prepared embodiment, in addition to the morphological and practical characteristics of the new therapeutic system are better illustrated in the following detailed description.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a multi-layer tablet,, in particular a multi-layer controlled-release tablet, comprising:<br>
(a)	one active layer containing: (i) an active substance, (ii) hydrophilic,<br>
polymeric substances which swell and/or gel and/or erode upon contact with<br>
aqueous liquids, (iii) lipophilic substances, and (iv) adjuvant substances,<br>
wherein the weight ratio of the hydrophilic polymeric substances to the<br>
lipophilic substances contained in said active layer is in the range of 10:1 to<br>
0.5:1; and<br>
(b)	one or more barrier layers containing one or more of: hydrophilic polymeric<br>
substances which swell and/or gel and/or erode upon contact with aqueous<br>
liquids, lipophilic substances, and adjuvant substances.<br><br>
Multi-layer tablets prepared in accordance with the present invention are .able to provide substantially equivalent (or identical) release kinetics for the same active; substance when formulated at different amounts in the active substance containing layer in the multi-layer tablet. The pharmaceutical tablets of the invention have the advantage of releasing the carried active substance in a programmed way, preferably also avoiding the phenomenon of dose dumping, and therefore being able to meet specific therapeutic needs with the gradual and controlled release of the active substance.<br>
The multi-layer tablets of the present invention can be prepared as two-layer tablets, three-layer tablets or greater numbers of layers if required. At least one layer will contain the active substance to be released from the tablet and least one layer will be a<br>
barrier or support layer with respect to the active substance containing layer. Possible<br>
. /<br>
constructions of multi-layer tablets are shown in Figures 1 to 9. The tablets may have an overall substantially circular cross-section, or it may adopt a more oval cross-section or any other suitable geometric shape, for example rectilinear. The tablet may also be shaped as a caplet (capsule form tablet). As will be appreciated there are many potential arrangements of the layers in multi-layer tablets.<br>
The layer containing the active substance can be referred to as the active layer, although, it should be noted that more than one active substance can be formulated in a tablet of the present invention. The layer that generally does not contain an active substance can be referred to as a barrier layer or a support layer.<br>
t<br>
A simple two-layer tablet is shown in Figure 1 where one lateral surface of the active substance containing layer (dotted) is covered by a barrier layer (hatched). A variation of this construction is shown in Figure 2 where two barrier layers cover both exposed lateral surfaces of the active substance containing layer. In Figure 3 a single barrier layer coats one lateral surface and the side of the active layer. The barrier layer is shown as being present in the form of an annular ring in Figure 4 surrounding the active core and Figure 5, an active core consisting of two active layers is shown<br><br>
surrounded by an annular ring of a barrier layer.<br>
In Figure 6 a three layer tablet is shown in which there is a first barrier layer (3) with" an exposed upper lateral surface and sides, which is adjacent to a second active layer (2) with both lateral surfaces covered and the side of the layer exposed, which is in turn adjacent to a second active layer (1) where the bottom lateral surface is exposed and the side is exposed. The two active layers may contain different active substances or the same active substance in different amounts. Figure 7 shows an alternative arrangement of the Figure 6 embodiment, where the active substance layer (5) is wholly within the barrier layer (6) and the second active substance layer (4). In Figure 8, a similar three-layer tablet is shown in which the barrier layer (8) is interposed between the two active substance containing layers (9) and (7).<br>
Another three layer tablet (caplet) construction is also shown hi Figure 9 in which the<br>
/<br>
tablet has two external barrier layers (10, 12) and an active substance layer (11) interposed between the barrier layers.<br>
In some tablet configurations, the barrier layer may also contain an active substance such that it acts as a barrier layer with respect to a first active substance containing layer, but which itself is an active substance containing layer. Generally, in such embodiments, the active substance in the active layers is different in the separate layers, although arrangements in which the same active is present in the separate active layers in different amounts can also be envisaged..<br>
The barrier layer(s) are meant to limit the release surface of the active layer, so as to allow that said carried active substance is released by the sole uncovered surface upon contact with the dissolution medium and/or the biological fluids according to kinetics that, in vitro, can be programmed according to precise methods, as will be highlighted in the given examples of the present invention.<br>
Any pharmaceutically active substance suitable for oral administration hi the form of a tablet can be formulated in a tablet of the present invention. An active substance is<br><br>
therefore a pharmaceutical (drug) with a therapeutic use, such substances also include those for administration for non-therapeutic uses, such as diagnosis of for dietary purposes.<br>
Preferably the active substance may be one aimed at the treatment of chronic diseases, for example, drugs acting on the cardiovascular system, anti-arrhythmics, cardiac stimulants, vasodilators, calcium antagonists, anti-hypertensives, for example anti-adrenergic substances of central and peripheral action Or substances acting on the arteriolar musculature, analgesic substances, substances acting on the renin-angiotensin system, anti-hypertensives and diuretics in .association, anti-Parkinson's Disease agents, diuretics and drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, anti-histamines and/or anti-asthmatics.<br>
Examples of active substances which may be used in such pharmaceutical forms are:<br>
/ propranolol, atenolol, pindolol, ropinirole, prazosin, ramipril, spirapril; spironolactone,<br>
metipranolol, molsidomine, moxonidina, nadolol, nadoxolol, levodopa, metoprolol, timolol. In a particular preferred embodiment, the active substance (i) comprises or is ropinirole, inclusive of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>

"Ropinirole" as mentioned herein is defined as including phannaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Most preferably, the ropinirole used in the tablet is in the form of the hydrochloride salt. Ropinirole is presently marketed as the HC1 salt in an immediate-release tablet for the treatment of. Parkinson's Disease (see also EP-A-0299602). Ropinirole can be synthesised by the advantageous method described in WO 91/16306.<br>

The amount of ropinirole present, inclusive of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be up to.; 12.0mg, preferably from 0.75mg to 12.0mg, measured as the amount of ropinirole base present, per 150 mg of active layer present. See Examples 13 to 18 hereinafter.<br>
Analgesic substances include, but are not limited to,.steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSACDs).

In any case the matrices can be prepared, carrying any type of active principle for which pharmaceutical forms may be necessary capable of releasing also very different amounts of active substance with the same release kinetics.<br>
In the tablets of the present patent application, the active substance to be carried may have a very wide solubility interval in water, e.g. between 0.01 mg/L up to 3000 g/L, preferably between 10 mg/L up to 1000 g/L (e.g. ropinirole has 133 g/L solubility), or between O.Olmg/L up to 100 g/L.<br>
The active substance is preferably contained in a percentage between 0.05% to 50% by weight of the active layer, more preferred ranges of the active substances are 0:05% to 40%, 0.05% to 30%, 0.05% to 10%, 0.05% to 20%.<br>
Natural or synthetic hydrophilic polymeric substances, can be used in the preparation of said active layer which are biocompatible and/or biodegradable materials and pharmaceutically acceptable, e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone in particular non-cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone (e.g. of molecular weight 30,000-400,000), hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of from 100,000 to 4,000,000, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (e.g. non-cross-linked, e.g. typical molecular weight 90,000-700,000), carboxymethylstarch, potassium methacrylate-divinylbenzene copolymer, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose with a molecular weight between 2,000 and 4,000,000, polyethyleneglycols of different molecular weight preferably between 200 and 15,000 (more preferably 1000-15000) and polyoxyethylenes of molecular weight up to 20,000,000 (more preferably 400,000-7,000,000), carboxyvinylpolymers, poloxamers (polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer), polyvinylalcohols, glucanes (glucans), carrageenans, scleroglucanes (scleroglucans), mannans, galactomannans, gellans, xanthans, algmic acid and derivatives (e.g. sodium or calcium alginate, propylene glycol alginate), polyaminoacids (e.g. gelatin), methyl vinyl ether / maleic anhydride copolymer, carboxymethylcellulose and derivatives<br><br>
(e.g. calcium carboxymethylcellulose), ethylcellulose, methylcelluJose, starch' and starch derivatives, alpha, beta or gamma cyclodextrin, and dextrin derivatives (e.g. dextrin) in general. The hydrophilic polymeric substance is therefore one which can; be described as a controlled release polymer or a polymeric substance which is capable of achieving controlled release (CR).<br>
More preferably for achieving advantageous controlled release of the active substance the hydrophilic polymeric substances in the active layer comprise one or more of the following: hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of from 100,000 to 4,000,000, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) with a molecular weight between 2,000 and 4,000,000 (more preferably between 10,000 and 1,500,000 molecular weight, still more preferably between 20,000 and 500,000 molecular weight, most preferably about 250,000 molecular weight), ethylcellulose or methylcellulose. The most preferred controlled release polymer is HPMC.<br>
Hydrophilic polymeric substances such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or calcium carboxymethylcellulose that act as viscosity-increasing agents/polymers or "cage-forming" components are also preferred components e.g. of the active layer. The provision of these viscosity-increasing polymers in the active layer is preferred because these help to reduce the "dose-dumping" effects occasionally seen with soluble active substances (e.g. ropinirole) whereby a significant minority of the active substance can be released from the active layer in the first (say) hour after oral administration. Thus, it is preferred for this purpose that the hydrophilic polymeric substances in the active layer comprise sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or a derivative (e.g. calcium carboxymethylcellulose), hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of from 100,000 to 4,000,000, a carboxyvinylpolymer, a carrageenan, a xanthan, alginic acid or a derivative (e.g. sodium or calcium alginate, propylene glycol algiiiate), ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, dextrin and/or maltodextrin. Most preferred for this purpose is sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaGMC) (e.g. non-cross-linked, e.g. typical molecular weight 90,000-700,000). The present invention also comprehends the use of other equivalent polymers able to act as viscosity-increasing agents and/or "cage-<br><br>
forming" components.<br>
It is more preferred that the hydrophilic polymeric substances in the active layer:: comprise both the above-mentioned preferred controlled release polymers and the above-defined viscosity-increasing polymers. Thus it is preferred that the hydrophilic polymeric substances in the active layer comprise:<br>
(a)	one or more of the following: hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular<br>
weight of from 100,000 to 4,000,000, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) with a<br>
molecular weight between 2,000 and 4,000,000, ethylcellulose or methylcelmlose; and<br>
(b)	sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or derivatives<br>
(e.g. calcium carboxymethylcellulose), hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular<br>
weight of from 100,000 to 4,000,000, a carboxyvinylpolymer, a carrageenan, a<br>
xanthan, algmic acid or a derivative (e.g. sodium or calcium alginate, propylene glycol<br>
alginate), ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, dextrin and/or maltodextrin.<br>
Thus, while the controlled release polymer (a) such as HPMC .is still swelling and/or gelling gradually in the first hour-or-so after oral administration of the tablet, when it may be less effective in controlling release of soluble active substances such as ropinirole from the active layer, the viscosity-increasing polymer (b) such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) reduces the release of the active substance from the active layer. Without being bound by theory, ionic viscosity-enhancers like NaCMC might also to interact with the hydroxypropyl groups of, for example, HPMC to boost synergistically the hydration and swelling rate of HPMC leading to greater gel strength.<br>
Thus, the most preferred combination is that the hydrophilic polymeric substances in the active layer include (or are)HMPC and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, especially when the active substance has a high (e.g. from 10 mg/L to 1000 g/L) solubility in water, such as ropinirole.<br>
Preferably, the hydrophilic polymeric substances have an HI.B value of at least 10 (see A. Gennaro and J. Remington, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition,<br><br>
Mack Publishing Company, Boston, Pa., 304 (1990) and W.C. Griffin, J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemists, vol. 1, page 311,1949 for HLB values and measurement thereof). Said hydropbilic polymeric substances make up between 1% and 75% of the weight of: the active layer, but preferably are present in a percentage between 5% and 65% and/or between 30 and 75%, more preferably 43-75% or 43-67% or 43-65%. Any HPMC present in the active layer is preferably present in about 40-63 % by weight of the active layer. The viscosity-increasing polymers mentioned above, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, if present are preferably present in up to 20% by weight of the active layer, more preferably (especially for NaCMC) 3-20%, 5-20%, 7-15%, or about 10% by weight of the active layer.<br>
For all the polymers cited different types are commercially available characterised by different chemical, physical, solubility and gelification properties. In particular, as regards, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose various types with a differenj molecular weight (between 1,000 and 4,000,000, preferably from 2,000 to 4,000,000, even more preferably between 10,000 and 1,500,000 molecular weight, still more preferably between 20,000 and 500,000 molecular weight, most preferably about 250,000 molecular weight) can be used and with different degrees of substitution. Said types of hydroxypropymiethylcellulose have differentiated characteristics being mainly credible or able to be gelled, depending on the viscosity and the degrees of substitution (D.S.) present in the polymeric chain. Gellable HPMCs (e.g. Methocel K grades) are preferable to erodible HPMCs (e.g Methocel E grades). The polyethyleneglycols and polyoxyethylenes show identical behaviour: in fact, different hydropbilic and gelification properties correspond to different molecular weights.<br>
The molecular weight of polymers and the 2% viscosity of polymers can be directly correlated ("METHOCEL™ in Aqueous Systems for Tablet Coating", page 12, published by The Dow Chemical Company - www.dow.com - METHOCEL™ is a trademark of The Dow Chemical Company) where viscosity of a polymer is defined as viscosity of a 2% aqueous solution at 20°C measured as mPa, seconds. Viscosity is measured in Pascal seconds (SI unite) or in poise (c.g.s. units), where 1 centipoise = 10"3 Pa,sec. So for example, METHOCEL™ K100M has an approximate molecular<br><br>
weight of 246,000 and a corresponding 2% viscosity of 100,000 mPa.sec (based on an average viscosity of 80,000 to 120,000 mPa.sec.); METHOCEL™ K4M has an approximate molecular weight of 86,000 and a corresponding 2% viscosity of 4,000 mPa.sec; and METHOCEL™ K100LV has an approximate molecular weight of 27,000 and a corresponding 2% viscosity of 100 mPa.sec. For this reason, the preferred molecular weight ranges of the polymeric substances, for example the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose polymers can also be defined in terms of viscosity.<br>
One preferred viscosity range for the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose polymers as denned above may be in the range of from 50 to 150,000 mPa,sec, suitably 80,000 to 120,000 mPa.sec (e.g. K100M, as in the active and barrier layers of Examples 13-21). This applies both to the active layer (discussed above) or the barrier / support layer(s) (discussed below).<br>
/<br>
In an alternative embodiment, in order to obtain a faster release rate, the viscosity range for the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose polymers in the active and/or barrier layer(s) may be in the range of from 50 to 25,000 mPa.sec (including Methocels K4M, K15M, K100LV). In this embodiment, preferably some or all of the HPMC polymers have a viscosity in the range of from 1000 to 25,000 mPa.sec (including Methocels K4M &amp; K15M but not K100LV or K100M). More preferably, HPMC polymers having a viscosity in the range of from 1000 to 25,000 mPa.sec are present in the active or barrier layer in a percentage of from 5 to 50% by weight of the active or barrier layer. In particular, Examples 22 and 23 hereinafter have 10% and 40 weight % respectively of such HPMC (K4M) in their barrier layers which gives a slightly faster release profile in vitro than the ca. 45 wt% K100M HPMC present hi the barrier layers of Examples 13-18 and 19-21, as inter alia the active substance e.g. ropinirole migrates faster through the barrier layers. Preferably, the proportion of low-viscosity HPMCs having from 50 to 
 <br>
the release rate, but greater amounts are not preferred.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, there is provided a tablet as previously; defined, in which the active layer contains polymeric material with slow swelling and/or gellification and/or erosion and/or solubility properties.<br>
A fundamental characteristic of the tablets of the present invention is that, for the formulation both of the layer containing the active substance and the barrier layers, lipopbilic substances are utilised, for example natural fats (coconut, soya, cocoa) as such or totally or partially hydrogenated, beeswax, polyethoxylated beeswax, mono-, bi- and tri-substituted glycerides, glyceryl palmitostearate, glyceryl behenate (glyceryl tribehenate €^9^134^0^, e.g. Compritrol 888, where behenic acid = docosanoic acid •. = C2iH43COOH), diethyleneglycol palmitostearate, polyethyleneglycol stearate,<br>
polyethyleneglycol palmitostearate, polyoxyethylene-glycol palmitostearate, glyceryl monopalmitostearate, cetyl palmitate, mono- or di- glyceryl behenate (glyceryl mono-behenate or glyoeryl di-behenate), fatty alcohols associated with polyethoxylate fatty alcohols, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and their hydrogenated derivatives, hydrogenated castor oil and lipopbilic substances in general. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the lipophilic substances are selected from hydrogenated.castor oil and glyceryl behenate.<br>
Preferably, the lipophilic substances have an HLB value of less than 10, more preferably, less than 5.<br>
Preferably, the lipophilic substances make up between 1% and 70% of the active layer weight, but preferably are present in a percentage between 5% .and 55%, more preferably 5-35%.<br>
The weight ratio between the content of hydrophilic polymeric substances and lipophilic substances, in the layer containing the active substance, is between 10:1 and 0.5:1 (i.e. in the range of 10:1 to 0.5:1), suitably between 10:1 and 1:1 (i.e. in the range of 10:1 to 1:1), but preferably between 7:1 and 1:1 (i.e. in the range of 7:1 to 1:1).<br><br>
Besides the previously cited hydropbilic polymers and the lipophilic substances, lipophilic and/or substances of amphiphilic nature may be used in the formulation, ur; which the hydrophitic portion can be represented -by glycerol molecules or other polyalcohols or polyethyleneglycol molecules (PEG) of molecular weight between 100 and 10,000, whereas the lipophilic part is represented by unsaturated and/or saturated fatty acids, in hydrogenated vegetable oil form. The association of the hydrophilic portion with the lipidic chain is obtained by esterification reactions or partial alcoholysis of hydrogenated vegetable oils by PEG molecules or glycerol or other polyol. hi this way compounds characterised by a different degree of hydrophilicity are obtained that can be assessed by measuring the Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB). Triglycerides are available with an HLB value between 1 and 2, diglycerides with HLB between 2 and 3, monoglycerides with HLB between 3 and 4, PEG diesters with HLB between 6 and 15, PEG monoesters with HLB between 10 and 17. In practice, increasing the HLB values increases the hydrophilic tendency and, obviously, decreases the lipophilic tendency. Tablets according to the present invention may therefore also contain polymeric substances of a lipophilic nature.<br>
Finally, adjuvants normally used in the pharmaceutical technique may be employed, for example, diluents, binders, lubricants, glidants and non-stick types, for example, starch, mannitol, lactose, sorbitol, xylitol, talc, stearic acid, sodium benzoate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silica, maltodextrin, and other excipients known to the expert in the field.<br>
In order to promote the penetration of water and/or aqueous fluids, in the layer or nucleus, hydrophilic diluents, for example, mannitol, lactose, starches of different origins, sorbitol, xylitol are introduced, or substances with wetting properties and/or those generally encouraging the penetration of water in the solid are preferably carried in the formulation.<br>
Moreover, diluents, binders, lubricants, buffers, non-stick substances, glidants and plastioising substances can be employed as well as others capable of giving said layer<br><br>
the desired characteristic as will be better illustrated in the examples quoted later on.<br>
Said adjuvants are preferably contained in a percentage between 5% to 50%; preferably from 10% to 40% or 20 to 50 % or 20% to 35% of the weight of said active layer. The weight ratio of the active substance (i) to that of the adjuvant component (iv) in the active, layer can be in the range of from 0.001:1 and 4:1, suitably of from 0.003:1 to 3:1.<br>
The polymeric substances employed for the preparation of the barrier layer in association with other adjuvants, are able to provide a barrier (applied by compression) which proves impermeable to the carried active substance in the underlying layer for a time period that strictly depends on its composition, which can vary from 1 hour to approx. 20-24 hours or more. In such case, the release of the active substance in the stated periods (e.g. during the first hour, after oral administration / immersion in aqueous fluids) occurs only from the surface of the tablet not covered by the barrier. "Impenneability" is to be construed accordingly. Preferably, during the first hour after oral administration or immersion in aqueous liquids (e.g. water), release of the active substance occurs substantially only from the surface of the tablet not covered by the barrier.<br>
To test the impermeability of the barrier layer to the release of the active substance, various suitable tests can be conceived by persons skilled in the art of pharmaceutical tablet formulation. However, one such test may be based on selective coating of the free surfaces of the active layer with a suitable substance, such as an enteric coat (for example, "Eudragit"), or a waxy material (for example, beeswax) such that normal release of active does not occur through these surfaces. An in vitro dissolution test can then be performed in which the dissolution fluid can be sampled at appropriate time points. In this way, the point in time can be determined at which the active substance is released through the barrier layer through the interaction of the component substances of the barrier layer with the aqueous environment (that is to say the point in time at which the polymers of the barrier layer permit release). Alternatively, the free surfaces of the barrier layer(s) can be selectively coated as above and a dissolution test<br><br>
performed. The release profile obtained would correspond to that of an uncoated tablet up to the point in time at which the active substance was able to permeate the barrier layer and be released from the uncoated tablet<br>
As noted above, the barrier layer may be superposed over one or more free surfaces of the active layer in the tablet Generally, the barrier layer will form a layer to cover one or more lateral surfaces of the active layer. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, tablets are provided in which one or more barrier layers are used to cover one or both surfaces or bases of the active layer. Such arrangements therefore provide for a bi-layer or a tri-layer tablet<br>
The natural synthetic hydrophilic polymeric materials, usable in the formulation of the barrier layer, can be chosen from among those listed for the preparation of the active layer. Said polymeric substances can be present in a percentage of 5 to, 90%, with respect to the total weight of said layer but, preferably, between 25% and 85%.<br>
Said polymeric substances, utilised individually or mixed together and mixed with the lipophilic substances, are able to bring about the impermeability in the release of the carried active principle in the underlying layer for a time interval that can vary from 1 hours to approx. 20-24 hours or more, depending on the composition.<br>
For the preparation of the barrier layer such lipophih'c substances can be chosen from those listed for preparation of the active layer. Said lipophilic substances can be present in a percentage between 5% and 70% with respect to'the total weight of said layer but, preferably, between 5% and 55%.<br>
The weight ratio of hydrophobic swelling and/or gelling and/or credible polymeric substances to lipophilic substances contained in the barrier layer can be in the range of 1:1 and 7.5:1, suitably of from 1.5:1 to 4:1, and preferably from 2:1 to 3.5:1.<br>
Said barrier layer(s), applied by compression, can have a thickness between 0.1 and 4.5 mm. The matrix preparation can be carried out by the compression of powder or<br><br>
granular mixtures, for example by blending followed by dry compression or wet granulation followed by compression, and preferably working between 1000 and 5000 Kg/cm2.<br>
In general, tabletting can be through direct compression, i.e. a mixture of dry powders being compressed, but this can sometimes cause quality issues such as segregation, poor flow etc. These issues can be improved by the use of granulation techniques on all or part of the constituent mix.<br>
Granulation is a process in which powder particles are agglomerated together to form granules. This can be carried out to:<br>
1.	improve the flow properties of a powder mixture,<br>
2.	prevent segregation of the constituent powders (improve homogeneity),<br>
3.	improve compression characteristics,<br>
4.	achieve densification of powder mixes, and/or<br>
5.	achievfc alteration of particle size/shape/hydrophilic properties<br>
The tablet of the invention may be prepared by dry granulation. Dry Granulation is granulation by compression of powders by either slugging or roller compaction. It is essentially a densification process.<br>
Slugging is where a crude compact (slug) is produced to a set weight/thickness for a given diameter of slug.  These slugs are then reduced by either grating or commuting mill to produce granules of the required particle size/range.<br>
Roller compaction or Chilsonating is where a powder mix is forced via an auger between 2 rollers (which can be smooth or grooved). Compaction of this material is controlled by the feed rate to the rollers and the hydraulic force of the rollers being pushed together. The resulting compact (called a ribbon or strip) is then reduced by either grating or commuting mill to produce granules of the required particle size/range.<br><br>
Where dry granulation is used, the adjuvants often differ slightly compared to wet granulation. For example, instead of lactose monohydrate (often used in wet granulation), one preferably uses spray-dried lactose preferably containing amorphous •:. lactose (e.g. Fast-Flo lactose, Seppic, Paris, France).<br>
However, the tablet of the invention is preferably prepared by wet granulation. Wet Granulation is the most widely used granulation technique, and involves powder densification and/or agglomeration by the incorporation of a granulation fluid/medium to the powder mix. Wet granulation can be aqueous-based or solvent-based, e.g. based on organic solvents.  Shear is dependent on the speed of the granulator paddle/blade through the powder. Various mixer designs are available, for example:<br>
Wet High Shear, (rotating high shear forces (Fielder))<br>
Wet Low Shear, (rotating low shear forces (Planetary mixer))<br>
Wet Low Shear Tumble, ( spraying in to tumble mixer with/without intensifier<br>
bar)<br>
Extrusion, (Wet solids pushed through classified screen)<br>
Rotary Gramilatprs, (Spheronisation, Marumerisation — spinning disk or walls<br>
of a vessel)<br>
Spray granulation in a fluidised Bed, or<br>
Spray dry granulation.<br>
For the formulation of said layer-barrier, which can be applied by compression, possible adjuvants, in particular diluents, include those traditionally used in the preparation of solid forms. For example magnesium steafate, stearic acid, sodium stearate, talc, sodium benzoate, boric acid, polyethylene glycols and/or colloidal silica can be employed.<br>
In addition diluent, lubricating, non-stick and glidant substances and other substances may be used capable of giving said layer the desired characteristic, as will be better illustrated in the examples quoted later on. Other possible components include substances able to impart a colour to the eventual tablet layer prepared and formulated in the multi-layer tablet, for example iron oxide (yellow ferric oxide).<br><br>
Li addition a covering could be applied to said finished tablets by a coating process and/or any other process well known to experts in the field. An example of a coating ••': is "OPADRY OY-S-28876 WHITE". OPADRY OY-S-28876 WHITE is 63% HPMC 2910 6cP, 7% PEG 400,30% Ti02. Red/pink (0.01-0.25%) and/or yellow (0.1 to 1.5%) colourings can also be added (iron oxides), the HPMC varying between 61-66%. An alternative blue coating uses 31-32% each of HPMC 2910 3cP and HPMC 2910 5cP, 8% PEG400,23-24% TiO2,1% polysorbate, and indigotine as blue dye at 4-5%.<br>
A colourant layer or a. film of gastroresistant and enterosoluble polymeric material may also be applied to said finished tablets, so as to allow the activation of the system only after the tablet has reached the duodeno-intestinal tract. Pharmaceutical systems of the latter type can be utilised for the accomplishment of tablets, specifically designed to release the active principle in the latter part of the intestinal tract i.e, at colon level. In order to attain gastroresistance, polymeric materials such as cellulose acetophthalate, cellulose acetopropionate, cellulose trimellitate, polymers and acrylic and methacrylic copolymers can be used of different molecular weights and with solubility which depends on different pH values. Said materials can be applied to the finished pharmaceutical form (active layer and the barrier layer(s)) by the classical coating process, utilising solutions in organic solvents or aqueous dispersions and spraying or fiuidised bed nebulisation. Said gastro-resistant and enterosoluble materials can likewise be utilised in association with retarder polymers.<br>
One innovative embodiment is characterised in that is possible to achieve the claimed therapeutic system by utilising the production technologies currently in use, i.e. the system may be immediately set up at industrial level-One preferred embodiment of a tablet of the present invention comprises a tablet as previously described in which the active layer consists of components (i) to (iv) wherein the active agent is present in a weight percentage of 0.05% to 20% by weight of the active layer, the adjuvant substances are present in a weight percentage of 5% to<br><br>
50% by weight of the active layer, and the weight ratio of the hydrophilic polymeric substances to the lipophilic substances is in the range of from 7:1 to 1:1.<br>
Alternatively, the active layer consists essentially of components (i) to (iv) wherein the active agent is present in a weight percentage of 0.05% to 20% by weight of the active layer, the adjuvant substances are present in a weight percentage of 5% to 50% by weight of the active layer, and the weight ratio of the hydrophilic polymeric substances to the lipophilic substances is in the range of from 7:1 to 1:1.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the hydrophilic polymeric substance may comprise hydroxypropyhnethylcellulose of molecular weight 2,000 to 4,000,000, sodium carboxymethylcellulose or calcium carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
In embodiments in which the active substance is ropinirole, the tablet may be characterised by comprising (i) ropinirole present in a weight percentage of 0.05% to 20% by weight of the active layer, (ii) the hydrophilic polymeric substance being hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose or calcium carboxymethylcellulose. (iii) the lipophilic substance being hydrogenated castor oil or glyceryl behenate, and (iv) the adjuvant substances being present in a weight percentage of 5% to 50% by weight of the active layer, in which the weight ratio of the hydrophilic polymeric substances to the lipophilic substances being in the range of fiom 7:1 to 1:1.<br>
The present invention also extends to methods of treatment comprising a tablet as herein described. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating a disease, the method comprising the administration of a tablet as defined herein to a patient/human in need thereof. In a preferred embodiment the disease treated is Parkinson's Disease where the active substance comprises or is ropinirole or another therapeutic agent for the treatment of this condition. According to such methods, especially with ropinirole, one or more multi-layer tablets can be administered once per day to the human need of such treatment, or a single multi-layer tablet can be administered once per day. The controlled-release ropinirole tablet of the<br><br>
present invention is expected to be advantageous compared to the marketed ropinirole immediate-release (IR) formulation because it should allow a more constant arid/or lower systemic concentration / C^gx over a 24-hr period, avoids the necessity with the'* IR tablet of taking ropinirole three times a day, and should avoid some of the side-effects which are possible when IR ropinirole is administered. See especially the advantageous approx. 24 hour in vitro release shown inter alia in ropinirole Examples 13-18 hereinafter: this is near-optimal for Parkinson's disease.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a tablet as herein defined, wherein the active substance comprises or is ropinirole, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in a human. The invention also provides such a tablet for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.<br>

In this way a granulate (granulate l(b)) is obtained with good slide and compaction properties. The granulate is subjected to the compression stage as described later on.<br>
l(c) Preparation of the two-layer systems fbv compression^<br>
The granulates, obtained as previously quoted and according to well known models to all experts in the field, are loaded in the feedboxes of a rotary compressing machine suitable for producing multi-layer tablets (e.g. Manesty Layer-Press, Liverpool, UK); In particular, the granulate described in section l(b) is loaded in the first; whereas the granulate as described in section l(a) is loaded in the second feedbox. The compressing machine is equipped with 9 mm diameter circular concave punches.<br>
The machine is set so as to produce two-layer systems consisting of an initial 100 mg of granulate barrier, a second layer of 131.4 mg containing the active principle (equal to 4:0 mg of pindolol.). Working as previously described, two-layer tablets are obtained with a mean.weight of 231.4 mg, each containing 4.0 mg active principle. Table 1 contains the data relating to the release verification of the active principle from the tablets in Example 1.<br>
Example 2; Systems consisting of a single two-layer tablet - S.Omg piadolol<br>
In Example 2, the first layer (slow release) contains 8 mg of pindolol; the second layer consists of a "barrier" layer.<br>
A granulate is prepared as described in Example 1, in section l(a), the only alteration being to double the amount of carried active principle. The second layer (barrier) is kept identical both qualitatively and quantitatively, as described in Example 1 in section l(b). Working as described in section l(c), two-layer tablets are prepared consisting of an initial amount of 100 mg of granulate barrier (barrier), a second layer of 135.4 mg containing die active principle (equal to 8.0 mg of pindolol). Hence two-.<br>

A granulate is prepared as described in Example 1, in section l(a), the only alteration being to carry 16 mg of active principle thus 143.4 mg of granulate contain 1'6.0 mg of pindolol. The second layer (barrier) is kept identical both qualitatively and quantitatively, as described hi Example 1 in section l(b). Working as described in section l(c), two-layer tablets are prepared consisting of an initial amount of 100 mg of granulate barrier, a second layer of 143.4 mg containing the active principle (equal to 16.0 mg of pindolol). Hence two-layer tablets are obtained with a mean weight of 243.4 mg, each containing 16.0 mg of active principle. Table 1 contains the data relating to the release verification of the active principle from the tablets in Example 3.<br>
Example 4: Systems consisting of a single two-layer tablet - 24mg pindolol<br>
In Example 4, the two-layer tablet system is as described in Examples 1 and 2 but containing 24.0 mg of pindolol.<br>
A granulate is prepared as described in Example 1, in section l(a), the only alteration being to carry 24 mg of active principle; thus 151.4 mg of granulate contain 24.0 mg of pindolol. The second layer (barrier) is kept identical both qualitatively and quantitatively, as described in Example 1 in section l(b). Working as described in section l(c), two-layer tablets are prepared consisting of an initial amount of 100 mg of granulate barrier, a second layer of 151.4 mg containing the active principle (equal to 24.0 mg of pindolol). Hence two-layer tablets are obtained with a mean weight of 251.4 mg, each containing 24.0 mg of active principle. Table 1 contains the data relating to the release verification of the active principle from the tablets in Example 4.<br>
Example 5: Systems consisting of a single two-layer tablet - 32.0mg pindolol<br>
In Example 5, the two-layer tablet is as described in Examples 1 and 2 but containing 32.0 mg of pindolol.<br>
A granulate is prepared as described in Example 1, in section l(a), the only alteration being to carry 32.0 mg of active principle; thus 159.4 mg of granulate contain 32.0 mg of pindolol and 43 weight % of total gellable, swellable and/or erodible hydrophilic polymers (PVP + HPMC) or 40 wt % (more exactly 39.5 wt%) HPMC.<br>
The second layer (barrier) is kept identical both qualitatively and quantitatively, as described in Example 1 in section l(b). Working as described in section l(c), two-layer tablets are prepared consisting of an initial amount of 100 mg of granulate barrier, a second layer of 159.4 mg containing the active principle (equal to 32.0 mg of pindolol).

Table 1 contains the data relating to the release verification of the active principle from the tablets in Example 5.<br>
Dissolution Test of Tablets Prepared in Examples 1 to 5<br>
To assess the release characteristics of the active principle from the two-layer tablets, quoted in Examples 1-5, equipment 2 is utilised, paddle (USP XXm), working at 100 r.p.m. and utilising as dissolution fluid 900 mL of 0.1M hydrochloric acid at 37 °C.

The tablet comprised an upper support or barrier layer (1), an active layer (2) and a lower support or barrier layer (3), as shown in Figure 9 (in which reference numerals 10,12 represent the barrier layers and 11 the active layer). HPMC is an abbreviation for hydroxypropyhnethylcellulose. Described in terms of four tablet strength formulations of ropinirole at Img, 3mg, 6mg, 9mg or 12mg per tablet ropinirole measured as effective base present  (Table Remove)<br>
 The purified water included as granulation liquid or coating liquid does not remain in the finished product as indicated by the reference sign "c". OPADRY OY-S-28876 WHITE is 63% HPMC 2910 6cP, 7% PEG 400,30% TiO2. Red/pink (0.01-0.25%) and/or yellow (0.1 to 1.5%) colourings can also be added (iron oxides), the HPMC varying between 61-66%. An alternative blue coating uses 31-32% each of HPMC 2910 3cP and HPMC 2910 5cP, 8% PEG400,23-24% TiO2,1% polysorbate, and indigotine as blue dye at 4-5%.<br>
Example 21: Preparation of Ropinirole Caplet Formula<br>
Tablet formulations of ropinirole as a caplet were prepared as follows. The tablet comprised an upper support or barrier layer (1), an active layer (2) and a lower support<br><br>
or barrier layer (3), as with example 20. Described in terms of four tablet strength formulations of ropinirole at Img, 3mg, 6mg, 9mg and 12 mg per tablet ropinirole measured as effective base present. This example is the same as Example 20 but the yellow ferric oxide in the support or barrier layers are absent.<br>
Support layer (1) (Table Remove)<br>
 The purified water included as granulation liquid or coating liquid does not remain in the finished product as indicated by the reference sign "d".<br>
Examples 22 and 23: Preparation of Ropinirole Caolet Formula<br>
Tablet formulations of ropinirole as a caplet were prepared as follows. The tablet comprised an upper support or barrier layer (1), an active layer (2) and a lower support<br>
i<br>
or barrier layer (3), as for Examples 20 and 21. Example formulations 22 and 23 are described as a single tablet strength formulation each of ropinirole at 0.75mg per tablet ropinirole measured as effective base present (0.855mg measured as the HC1 salt). As can be seen, Examples 22 and 23 involve identical active layers to the 0.75mg<br>
ropinirole active layer of Example 19, but different hairier layers to Example 19, with different amounts and grades of HPMC in the barrier layers, replacement of mannitol with lactose, and lower amounts of glyceryl behenate. As can be seen, Examples 22-and 23 have 10% and 40 weight % respectively of K4M HPMC in their barrier layers which gives a slightly faster release profile in vitro than the ca. 45 wt% K100M HPMC present in the barrier layers of Examples 13-18 and 19-21, as inter alia the ropinirole migrates faster through the barrier layers. Example 22 has 20 wt % of K100LV HPMC as well as 10 wt % K4M HPMC in the barrier layer - the low-viscosity (LV) HPMC in the barrier layer may increase water uptake and aid gelling, increasing the matrix viscosity and decreasing the release rate.

 Active Layer (2) for Examples 22 and 23<br>
Described in terms of three tablet strength formulations of ropinirole at 0.75mg per tablet ropinirole measured as effective base present<br>
  (Table Remove)<br>
 The purified water included as granulation h'quid or coating liquid does not remain in the finished product as indicated by the reference sign "c".<br>
Note: The active layer for each Example 22 and 23 above can be replaced by the active layers of examples 20 and 21 using Img, 3mg, 6mg, 9mg and 12mg ropinirole  .. measured as effective base present.<br>
Note: in all the ropinirole examples 13-18 and 19-23, higher doses of up to 24 mg ropiniiole per day can be administered by e.g. 2 x 12 mg tablets. Other doses e.g. 4 mg per day can be administered using 1 x 1 mg and 1 x 3 mg tablet per day. Also, in any of the Examples 13-23, different doses of for example CT.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 2 mg ropinirole can be used in the active layer by varying the amount of lactose while keeping the total weight of the active layer constant.<br>
Example 24: Further studies on caplet preparation and drug dissolution profiles<br>
The following further studies on caplet preparation are presented to $how drug' dissolution profiles for ropinirole caplets containing 0.75mg, 6mg or 12mg ropinirole measured as effective base present. (Table Remove)<br>
 Notes:<br>
