3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
the<br><br>
The invention relates to a new Gas Chromatographic detector based on the provision of a low flow rate of a premixed gas mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, provided by a water electrolyzer device.<br>
Basic Principle<br>
The Electrolyser powered Flame Ionization Detector (EFID) is based on the combustion of a premixed, stoichiometric, hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture, at a low flow rate, without make-up gas. This gas mixture is provided from a water electrolyser, without any gas separation or compression. The water electrolyser is very reliable (no moving parts and no gas separation or compression) and it can be integrated into the GC. Its sensitivity is even slightly improved as compared to a FID due to higher flame chemical ionization yield.<br>
Introduction<br>
The flame ionization detector (FID) is the most widely used detector for gas chromatography (GC) and is also used as a stand-alone monitor of the total hydrocarbon concentration in air. Although very effective, the FID typically consumes 30 ml/min of hydrogen, 30 ml/min of helium make-up gas and 300-400 ml/min of pure air. Clearly, it is highly desirable to eliminate these gases, their cylinders, pneumatics and safety hazards from the FID and GC. A new type of FID was developed, based on the provision of a low flow rate of an unsprayed gas mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, provided by a water electrolyser. This electrolyser-powered FID (EFID) considerably simplifies the gas logistics of GC-FID, improves its operational safety, reduces the cost of analysis and significantly improves its transportability.<br>
The EFID is operated with a combustible gas mixture produced by water electrolyser, without gas separation or compression. The Electrolyser powered FID<br>
2<br><br>
(EFID) is based on the combustion of a premixed, Stoichiometric, hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture, at a low flow rate, without make-up gas. The EFID gas exit is heated to a temperature above 100°C. The small water electrolyser has a diameter of 150 mm, a height of 235 mm. This electrolyser typically requires 2.3 Ampere at 2.0 Volts (4.5 Watts) consumes ~ 15 ml water per day and enables 30 days of continuous operation. The electrolyser requires only water, with no drying material, and enables full EFID automation for years of unattended operation. The water electrolyser can be fully integrated with the GC and replace the FID three channels electronic flow control. The EFID efficiency is about 60 milli Coulomb/gram C. The EFID shows close to uniform carbon response with linear dynamic range of Six orders of magnitude.<br>
Accordingly there is provided; A flame detector for analyzing a sample based on the provision of a combustible gas mixture, comprising the steps of: generating by means of a water electrolyser a premixed hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture, said water electrolyser being capable of providing the gas mixture required for solely sustaining a flame; stabilizing the output flow rate of said premixed gas mixture for reducing the flame background noise; heating said detector to a temperature sufficient for preventing water condensation ; feeding said mixture via a jet having an opening sufficiently small for preventing a flame flashback; igniting said gas mixture to produce a flame, and detecting a characteristic of the resulting flame to determine the identity and/or concentration of one or more chemical substances in the sample.<br>
The invention will now be described with figure 1 in the accompanying drawing. Figure 1 is the perspective view of the electrolyser;<br>
Referring to figure 1 consists of an electrolyser cell (1) with water inlet (2) and studs for electric connection (6). The released gases; premixed hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture is passed through a silica gel filter unit at (3). A 6-way Bakelite connector (4) is attached to the body of the cabinet.<br>

Comparison of New Invention over Conventional one<br>
A conventional FID operates with a hydrogen diffusion flame, which has a central flow of pure hydrogen and column effluents, surrounded by a much higher coaxial flow of pure air. In contrast, the EFID is based on the combustion of a premixed hydrogen and oxygen, stoichiometric gas mixture. This premixed gas mixture is provided by a simple water electrolyser with low power and water consumption, without separation, compression, or pressure stabilization of the hydrogen and oxygen. The EFID has two modifications:<br>
(a)The flame tip must have a narrow hole (250 um) to prevent flame flash-backs. (b)The entire detector structure is maintained above 100°C to prevent water condensation due to the lack of diluting air.<br>
Up to twice improved detection can be achieved with the EFID. The flame chemical ionization yield of the EFID linearly increases with the electrolyser current. The EFID response is linear over almost 7 orders of magnitude. The response is selective to carbon compounds where the response in aliphatic compounds is ~ 30% lower than with aromatic compounds, and no observable difference for N-, S-, P-, and Cl-containing compounds. The use of split less solvent injections with a mega bore column (0.53 mm i.d.) quenches the flame. This flame extinction is eliminated by the use of a miniature air pump during the solvent elution time. Typical electrolyser operating parameters are current of 2.3 A, ~15 mL/day water consumption and 4.5 W electrolyser power requirements.<br>
8<br><br>
Benefits of invention Over Conventional One<br>
The benefits of the EFID compared to the conventional FID are:<br>
•	The EFID Eliminates all the gas cylinders from the FID, while retaining all its features that made FID the GC industry standard detector.<br>
•	Saves gases and maintenance cost more than the price of the GC in its lifetime<br>
•	Frees precious laboratory space occupied by gas cylinders and their service path.<br>
•	Considerably simplifies the purchase and installation of GC-FID<br>
•	Simplifies GC-FID maintenance and makes it much easier to use.<br>
•	Enables a new dimension of GC-FID transportability.<br>
•	Is slightly more sensitive than the standard FID<br>
•	The EFID does not require any makeup gas.<br>
•	Enables full gas cylinder free GC-FID operation for gases, VOCS and breath analysis applications.<br>
