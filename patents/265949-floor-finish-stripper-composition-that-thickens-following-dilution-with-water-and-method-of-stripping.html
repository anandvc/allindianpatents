FLOOR FINISH STRIPPER COMPOSITION THAT THICKENS FOLLOWING DILUTION7WITH WATER<br>
AND METHOD OF STRIPPING<br>
Technical Field<br>
[00101] This invention relates to floor stripping, to the non-destructive<br>
removal of floor finishes and to floor finish stripper compositions.<br>
Background<br>
[00102] Floor strippers may be used to remove worn or discolored floor<br>
finishes from flooring substrates (e.g., vinyl composition tiles) without<br>
harming the flooring substrate itself, so that a new finish may be applied.<br>
References relating to floor strippers include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,158,710<br>
(VanEenam '710), 5,419,848 (VanEenam '848), 5,585,341 (VanEenam<br>
'341), 5,637,559 (Koreltz et al.), 5,849,682 (VanEenam '682), 6,010,995<br>
(VanEenam '995), 6,544,942 Bl (Smith et al.) and 6,583,101 Bl (Wiseth et<br>
al.).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[00103] Floor strippers are typically sold as concentrates intended to be<br>
diluted with water just prior to use, e.g., by mixing the concentrate with<br>
water in a mop bucket. The resulting diluted stripper typically has a<br>
viscosity less than about 50 cps. Some strippers "dewet" (appear to bead<br>
up or otherwise insufficiently wet) on a floor shortly after being applied,<br>
and may continue to dewet until the user swabs the stripper back and forth<br>
a few times as the floor finish softens. Additionally, the effectiveness of<br>
some formulations decreases during application as the solvents evaporate<br>
and as the stripper flows into undesired areas.<br>
[00104] Some paint strippers are sold in thickened form. Paint strippers<br>
typically are used at full strength and are not provided as concentrates<br>
intended to be diluted with water or other liquids prior to use. Water is<br>
used to remove some paint strippers from softened paint layers after the<br>
paint stripper has been applied to the paint.<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
[00105] Less work during stripper application might be required if the<br>
stripper had a reduced tendency to dewet when first applied, a reduced<br>
tendency to evaporate during use, or a reduced tendency to flow into<br>
undesired areas (e.g., carpeting, flooring not being stripped, or areas under<br>
store displays and shelving). Stripper effectiveness over non-level or high<br>
spots might also be improved if the stripper had a reduced tendency to flow<br>
toward low spots within the area to be stripped. The flow characteristics of<br>
the stripper can be modified by including a thickener in the concentrate, but<br>
it can be difficult to dispense thickened concentrates from a container.<br>
[00106] The present invention provides, in one aspect, a method for<br>
stripping a floor comprising:<br>
a)	providing a substantially nonchlorinated concentrate comprising<br>
a floor finish dissolver and an at least partially water-<br>
unactivated water thickener;<br>
b)	diluting the concentrate with water at an intended use location to<br>
activate the water thickener and noticeably increase within sixty<br>
minutes or less the viscosity of the resulting diluted mixture;<br>
c)	applying the resulting water-thickened stripper to a hardened<br>
floor finish atop a floor;<br>
d)	allowing the applied stripper to soften or dissolve the floor<br>
finish; and<br>
e)	removing the softened or dissolved finish from the floor.<br>
[00107] The present invention provides, in another aspect, a water-<br>
thickenable floor finish stripper concentrate composition comprising a floor<br>
finish dissolver, an at least partially water-unactivated water thickener and<br>
a metal ion-containing compound, wherein when the concentrate is diluted<br>
with at least an equal volume of water the viscosity of the resulting diluted<br>
mixture noticeably increases within sixty minutes or less, and wherein the<br>
metal ion-containing compound can interact with the water thickener to<br>
lower the viscosity of the concentrate without appreciably reducing the<br>
increase in the diluted mixture viscosity.<br>

WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
[00108] The disclosed method and disclosed water-thickenable strippers<br>
can provide more effective stripping than might be obtained using<br>
unthickened strippers. The disclosed water-thickenable strippers can also<br>
be more convenient to dispense and use than stripper concentrates that have<br>
already been significantly thickened prior to dilution.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[00109] The phrase "hardened floor finish" refers to an applied liquid<br>
coating that through a chemical or physical process (including solvent<br>
evaporation or other drying processes, photochemical reactions,<br>
electrochemical reactions, radical processes, thermal processes, ionic<br>
processes, moisture cure processes or multiple-component (e.g., two- or<br>
three-component) crosslinking processes) has become dried, crosslinked or<br>
otherwise cured in situ to form a tack-free film on a floor. The phrase<br>
"floor finish dissolver" refers to an organic or inorganic liquid or solid<br>
material that can dissolve, soften, uncrosslink, depolymerize or otherwise<br>
assist in removing a hardened floor finish from a floor.<br>
[00110] The phrase "stripping a floor" refers to removing, at such time<br>
as it may be desired to do so, a hardened floor finish from an underlying<br>
installed flooring substrate without removing substantial portions of the<br>
flooring substrate. Such removal may employ minimally abrasive<br>
measures such as application of the disclosed stripper followed by rinsing<br>
using, e.g., water or a detergent solution, and may if desired be<br>
accompanied by more abrasive but flooring-safe measures such as use of a<br>
nonwoven floor scrub pad, but can be carried out without requiring a<br>
flooring-damaging removal step such as sanding.<br>
[00111] The word "concentrate" refers to a composition intended to be<br>
diluted with water before use. The phrase "substantially nonchlorinated"<br>
refers to a concentrate that does not contain objectionable quantities of<br>
chlorinated solvents (e.g., methylene chloride) whose presence could pose a<br>
health hazard to users. The phrase "diluting the concentrate with water"<br>
refers to mixing a concentrate with water (e.g., plain tap water) in an<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
amount sufficient to at least double the volume of the resulting mixture.<br>
The phrase "diluting the concentrate merely with water" refers to mixing a<br>
concentrate with water and substantially no other required ingredients in an<br>
amount sufficient to at least double the volume of the resulting mixture.<br>
The phrase "at an intended use location" refers to carrying out such diluting<br>
at or near (e.g., in the same building as) a floor to be stripped.<br>
[00112] The phrase "at least partially water-unactivated water thickener"<br>
refers to a material that will build the viscosity of a diluted mixture of the<br>
concentrate and water shortly after the concentrate and water are rapidly<br>
mixed. Such viscosity building may be due to a variety of mechanisms,<br>
e.g., a change in one or more factors such as the water thickener's extent of<br>
hydration, association, neutralization or crosslinking, or by a change in the<br>
water thickener's molecular configuration. For example the water<br>
thickener may change from an unhydrated or only partially hydrated state<br>
to a fully hydrated state when the concentrate is diluted with water. The<br>
phrase "fully water activated water thickener" refers to a material that may<br>
thicken a concentrate or a diluted mixture of the concentrate and water, but<br>
which will not significantly build the viscosity of a diluted mixture of the<br>
concentrate and water after the concentrate and water are mixed.<br>
[00113] The disclosed concentrates may have a variety of physical forms<br>
including liquids, gels, pastes and solids. Suitable solids include powders<br>
and monolithic shapes such as molded, extruded and otherwise formed<br>
shapes. If a liquid or gel, the concentrate may be a solution, dispersion or<br>
emulsion, and desirably is clear or translucent. If a liquid, gel or paste, the<br>
concentrate desirably is homogenous (e.g., a single phase solution or a<br>
stable emulsion or dispersion) and remains so when stored. If not<br>
homogeneous and storage stable, the concentrate desirably remains<br>
homogenous for at least long enough (e.g., 1 minute or more, 5 minutes or<br>
more or 10 minutes or more) after the concentrate has been shaken or<br>
stirred to disperse or redisperse the thickener so that the concentrate can<br>
readily be diluted with water. Homogeneity is not required and if need be<br>
the concentrate may be non-homogeneous. Prior to dilution, the<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
concentrate may have a viscosity greater than or less than that of the diluted<br>
use-solution. After dilution, the diluted use-solution will exhibit viscosity<br>
building (viz., an increase viscosity shortly after mixing), and typically will<br>
reach a built (e.g., a plateau) viscosity greater than that of water and<br>
desirably greater than that of the concentrate. The built viscosity value<br>
desirably will persist at least long enough to accomplish floor stripping<br>
(e.g., 10 minute or more, 20 minutes or more or 30 minutes or more). The<br>
diluted use-solution desirably is homogeneous and remains so if stored. If<br>
not homogeneous and storage stable, the diluted use-solution desirably<br>
remains homogenous for at least long enough to accomplish floor stripping.<br>
Desirably the diluted use-solution will also exhibit shear-thinning. Such<br>
shear thinning can provide an auto-arresting feature that lets a user throw<br>
the diluted use-solution onto a floor (e.g., by casting it from a mop bucket),<br>
whereupon the use-solution will rapidly spread out and then "freeze" in<br>
place. Shear-thinning may be imparted to the diluted use-solution in a<br>
variety of ways, such as by employing an appropriate water thickener or<br>
separate thixotropic agent that imparts shear-thinning properties to the<br>
diluted use-solution.<br>
[00114] A variety of floor finish dissolvers may be employed in the<br>
disclosed stripping method. Representative floor finish dissolvers include<br>
solvents such as alcohols (e.g., cyclic alcohols), amines, amides, ethers<br>
(e.g., hydroxyethers), ketones, dialkyl carbonates, essential oils, esters (e.g.,<br>
cyclic esters, dibasic esters and phthalate esters), oxygenated solvents (e.g.,<br>
glycol ethers) and mixtures thereof. Some materials may serve as a solvent<br>
in some concentrates or in some floor stripping applications, and as a<br>
cosolvent in combination with one or more floor finish dissolvers in other<br>
concentrates or in other floor stripping applications. Such cosolvents may<br>
for example assist in dissolving or dispersing a floor finish dissolver in a<br>
concentrate, help maintain the concentrate in a desirable physical state<br>
during storage, ease dilution of the concentrate with water, reduce cost,<br>
reduce odor or provide some other desirable packaging, storage or use<br>

thickeners (all available from Sud-Chemie Group). The amount of water<br>

% or about 3 to about 10 % of the total concentrate weight.<br>
[00117] The concentrate may also contain antisettling agents that may<br>
help discourage settling or sedimentation of the water thickener before the<br>
concentrate is diluted with water. Desirably the concentrate is<br>
homogeneous (e.g., non-settling) even if heated or cooled to temperatures<br>
to which the concentrate might be exposed during shipment or storage.<br>
Representative antisettling agents include many of the water thickening<br>
agents listed above (e.g., natural or synthetic clays, and some acrylate<br>
polymers) as well as materials that discourage such settling or<br>
sedimentation but which do not serve as water thickeners.<br>
[00118] The concentrate may and desirably will contain one or more<br>
surfactants. Representative surfactants will be familiar to those skilled in<br>
the art, and include water-soluble and oil-soluble anionic, cationic,<br>
amphoteric and nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. Some nonionic<br>
surfactants can interact with acrylate polymer water thickeners to provide a<br>
reduced viscosity concentrate, to increase the viscosity of the diluted use<br>
solution, or both. Other surfactants may interact with the water thickener to<br>
cause an appreciable increase in the concentrate viscosity, and thus may be<br>
less desirable. Especially desirable surfactants include those that improve<br>
wetting properties of the diluted use solution, improve stability of the<br>
concentrate, or provide other desirable properties such as storage, mixing,<br>
application or stripping advantages.<br>
[00119] Exemplary anionic surfactants include alkylbenzene sulfonates<br>
(e.g., C6-C24 alkylbenzene sulfonates), olefin sulfonates (e.g., C6-C24<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
olefin sulfonates), paraffin sulfonates (e.g., C6-C24 paraffin sulfonatcs),<br>
cumene sulfonate, xylene sulfonate, alcohol sulfates (e.g., C6-C24 or C6-<br>
C12 alcohol sulfates), alcohol ether sulfates having 1 to about 20 ethylene<br>
oxide groups, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00120] Exemplary cationic surfactants include quaternary amine<br>
compounds having the formula:<br><br>
where R, R', R" and R'" are each an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group (e.g., a Cg-<br>
C24 alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group) which can optionally contain one or more<br>
P, O, S or N heteroatoms, and X is F, Cl, Br, I or an alkyl sulfate.<br>
[00121] Exemplary amphoteric surfactants include amine oxide<br>
compounds having the formula:<br><br>
where R, R' and R" are as defined above, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00122] Exemplary amphoteric surfactants also include betaine<br>
compounds having the formula:<br><br>
where R, R' and R" are as defined above and n is about 1 to about 10, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
[00123] Exemplary nonionic surfactants include alcohol ethoxylates<br>
(e.g., C6-C24 or C6-C16 alcohol ethoxylates) having 1 to about 20 ethylene<br>
oxide groups (e.g., about 9 to about 20 ethylene oxide groups), alkylphenol<br>
ethoxylates (e.g., C6-C24 or C8-C10 alkylphenol ethoxylates) having 1 to<br>
about 100 ethylene oxide groups (e.g., about 12 to about 20 ethylene oxide<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
groups), alkylpolyglycosides (e.g., C6-C24 or C5-C20 alkylpolyglycosides)<br>
having 1 to about 20 glycoside groups (e.g., about 9 to about 20 glycoside<br>
groups), and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00124] The amount of surfactant may vary depending on factors such as<br>
the chosen floor finish dissolver, the possible presence of water in the<br>
concentrate, the desired dilution level, the desired thickening rate following<br>
mixing, the desired degree of thickening for the given intended use, and<br>
interactions between the surfactant and the water thickener. As a general<br>
guide, the amount of surfactant may be about 0.1 to about 50 %, about 0.1<br>
to about 15 % or about 2 to about 15 % of the total concentrate weight.<br>
[00125] The concentrate may and desirably will contain one or more<br>
sources of metal ion-containing compounds. Representative metal ion-<br>
containing compounds include acids, bases and salts (including metal<br>
complex salts). Desirable metal ion-containing compounds include those<br>
which can interact with the water thickener to lower the viscosity of the<br>
concentrate without appreciably reducing the diluted use-solution built<br>
viscosity value. For example, ions of alkali metals such as potassium can<br>
interact with acrylate polymer water thickeners to provide a reduced<br>
viscosity concentrate without significantly impacting the use dilution<br>
viscosity.<br>
[00126] The concentrate may contain one or more binders that solidify<br>
the concentrate and enable it to be granulated into a powder or made into a<br>
molded, extruded or other formed shape. Suitable binders include<br>
carbonates (e.g., sodium carbonate), urea, silicates (e.g., sodium<br>
metasilicate), tripolyphosphates, and mixtures thereof. Some solid caustic<br>
materials such as sodium metasilicate pentahydrate may serve both as a<br>
floor finish dissolver and as a binder.<br>
[00127] The concentrate may contain one or more chelating agents that<br>
can counteract the sensitivity of some thickeners to water hardness.<br>
Without such chelating agents, a concentrate designed to be diluted using<br>
softened water might perform differently if diluted using unsoftened water.<br>
Water hardness may also vary considerably from use site to use site. The<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
addition of an appropriate chelating agent to the thickened stripper<br>
concentrate can address this potential problem. As a general guide, the<br>
amount of chelating agent may be about 0.01 to about 5 % or about 0.1 to<br>
about 1 % of the total concentrate weight.<br>
[00128] The concentrate may contain other adjuvants including biocides,<br>
abrasive particles, builders, defoamers, fragrances, dyes, indicators,<br>
colorants, pH adjusters, anticorrosion additives, antirust additives, light<br>
stabilizers, humectants and antioxidants. The types and amounts of such<br>
adjuvants may readily be determined by those skilled in the art. The<br>
concentrate may also contain a limited amount of water, provided that the<br>
amount is such that the water thickener is partially but not fully activated<br>
and can become fully activated following dilution of the concentrate with<br>
water at an intended use location. The water amount desirably is less than<br>
50 % and may be for example less than 30 %, less than 20 %, less than 10<br>
%, less than 5 % or less than 1 % of the total concentrate weight.<br>
[00129] The concentrate may be manufactured by merely mixing the<br>
ingredients. The concentrate may also be manufactured by adding the<br>
water thickener and other desired ingredients to a commercial stripper<br>
(which may be modified as needed to remove some or all of any water that<br>
may be present so as to avoid fully activating the water thickener) such as<br>

[00130] The concentrate may be packaged in any convenient form<br>
including bottles, pouches (e.g., rupturable, tearable or dissolvable<br>
pouches), drums, dispensers intended to be carried by a user during stripper<br>
application and dispensers intended to be replaceably installed in a mixing<br>
or dispensing device (e.g., a wall-mounted, freestanding or benchtop<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
dispensing station). Such packaging may include multiple containers, e.g.,<br>
a first container containing primarily the floor finish dissolver and a second<br>
container containing at least partially water-unactivated water thickener<br>
with the contents of the containers being mixed together at the intended use<br>
location. In another embodiment, such packaging may include a first<br>
container containing water and other desired ingredients, a second<br>
container containing at least partially water-unactivated water thickener and<br>
a third container containing the floor finish dissolver with the contents of<br>
the three containers being added to one another and mixed together at the<br>
intended use location. In yet another embodiment the at least partially<br>
water-unactivated water thickener may be packaged in a pouch or other<br>
suitable container and added to a conventional floor stripper at the intended<br>
use location. The types and design of suitable packaging will be familiar to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
[00131] A variety of flooring substrates may be stripped using the<br>
disclosed method. Exemplary flooring substrates include resilient flooring<br>
substrates such as vinyl composition tiles, vinyl sheet flooring, linoleum,<br>
rubber sheeting, rubber tile, cork, synthetic sports flooring and vinyl<br>
asbestos tile, and non-resilient flooring substrates such as terrazzo,<br>
concrete, wood flooring, bamboo, wood laminate, engineered wood<br>
products (e.g. wood epoxy blends, permanently coated substrates such as<br>
those available under the names PERGO™ and PARQUET™), stone,<br>

Publication No. US 2002/0028621 Al, and in the patents cited therein. The<br>
floor finishes may include water-soluble or water-dispersible film formers<br>
such as metal-free acrylic finishes, acid-containing polymers crosslinked<br>
using transition metals, and water-soluble or water-dispersible<br>
multicomponent (e.g., two component) polyurethanes. The floor finish<br>
may contain mixtures of film formers.<br>
[00133] The concentrate may be diluted with water or with a water-<br>
based diluent that mostly contains water (e.g., a mixture of a major amount<br>
of water and a minor amount of an alcohol) at the intended use location.<br>
The water may for example be ordinary tap water, softened water or<br>
process water. The concentrate:diluent dilution ratio may be for example<br>
be at least 1:1 by volume, at least 1:2, at least 1:3, at least 1:4, at least 1:5,<br>
at least 1:6, at least 1:8, at least 1:10 or more. A variety of mixing methods<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
may be employed. Mixing in a mop bucket is one such method and may be<br>
preferred. The diluted use mixture may be stirred as needed and if desired<br>
allowed to stand for a time sufficient to activate the water thickener and<br>
noticeably increase the mixture viscosity. A noticeable (e.g., subjectively<br>
determinable based on stripping performance) viscosity increase may take<br>
place within sixty minutes or less, e.g., beginning 15 seconds, 30 seconds<br>
or one minute after the start of mixing, and may build within for example<br>
45 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes or 2 minutes<br>
after the start of mixing. These recited times do not preclude the possibility<br>
that further viscosity building may continue to take place thereafter. The<br>
built viscosity 15 minutes after the concentrate and diluent are mixed may<br>
for example be more than 100 cps, more than 200 cps or more than 300 cps<br>
as measured at room temperature using a Brookfield viscometer and an HA<br>
No. 6 spindle operated at 20 rpm, and the viscosity increase compared to<br>
the viscosity measured as soon as possible after the concentrate and diluent<br>
are mixed may for example at least 50 cps, at least 100 cps or at least 200<br>
cps.<br>
[00134] The hardened floor finish can optionally be abraded with a<br>
suitably mild abrasive (e.g., a green or black SCOTCH-BR1TE™ Floor<br>
Maintenance pad from 3M) prior to applying the thickened stripper. The<br>
thickened stripper may be applied using techniques that will be familiar to<br>
those skilled in the art (e.g., using a flat or string mop, squeegee, roller or<br>
towel). The applied stripper should be allowed to stand for a suitable time<br>
(e.g., for a minute or more, and typically between about 5 and about 20<br>
minutes) while it softens or dissolves the floor finish. The softened or<br>
dissolved finish may be removed using a variety of techniques that will be<br>
familiar to those skilled in the art including vacuuming, mopping,<br>
scrubbing or wiping. The stripped floor may be optionally rinsed with<br>
water and allowed to dry and a new layer or layers of floor finish applied<br>
and caused or allowed to harden.<br>

[00135] The invention is further illustrated in the following non-limiting<br>
examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>
Example 1<br>
[00136] A concentrate was prepared by mixing 98% benzyl alcohol and<br>
2% VANZAN Xanthan gum (R.T. Vanderbilt Co.). The concentrate was<br>
diluted with tap water at a 2:25 concentrate:water ratio, mixed and allowed<br>
to stand for several minutes, resulting in formation of a thickened stripper<br>
mixture. Using a cotton towel, the thickened stripper was applied to vinyl<br>
tile floors coated with three hardened coats of GEMSTAR LASER finish or<br>
three hardened coats of ISI STAR finish (both available from Ecolab, Inc.)<br>
which had been applied using a 50 m2/L (2000 ft2/gallon) coating rate.<br>
The thickened stripper mixture applied easily, and did not appear to dewet.<br>
The applied stripper was allowed to stand for 10 minutes, then scrubbed<br>
using a "swing machine" style electric floor scrubber equipped with a black<br>
nonwoven scrub pad. The softened floor finish was removed using a<br>
wet/dry shop vacuum. Both finishes were completely stripped.<br>
Example 2<br>
[00137] Using the method of Example 1, a concentrate was prepared by<br>
mixing 80% benzyl alcohol, 0.5% PEMULEN 1622 copolymer thickener<br>
(Noveon, Inc.) and 19.5% monoisopropylamine. This concentrate provided<br>
a thickened liquid when diluted at a 1:10 ratio with water.<br>
Example 3<br>
[00138] An additional noticeably thickened dilution was obtained when<br>
the Example 2 concentrate ingredients were changed to a mixture of 99%<br>
benzyl alcohol and 1% PEMULEN 1622 polymer or 98% benzyl alcohol<br>
and 2% KELZAN AR Xanthan gum (CP Kelco, Inc.).<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
Example 4<br>
[00139] Using the method of Example 1, a floor stripper was prepared at<br>
an intended use location by mixing benzyl alcohol with Xanthan gum and<br>
water to produce a final mixture containing 77.15% water, 21.77% benzyl<br>
alcohol and 1.08% Xanthan gum. Using a 15 minute standing time<br>
following application, the thickened stripper mixture was used to<br>
completely strip a vinyl tile floor coated with five coats of hardened<br>
GEMSTAR LASER finish which had been applied using a 50 m2/L (2000<br>
ft2/gallon) coating rate.<br>
Example 5<br>
[00140] Using the method of Example 1, concentrates were made by<br>
mixing either 98% benzyl alcohol of 98% DOWANOL EPh ethylene<br>
glycol phenyl ether (Dow Chemical Co.) with 2% of a thickener from Table<br>
1 below. The floor finish dissolvers and thickeners used in the various<br>
concentrates are identified as Formulation 5-1 through 5-14 in Table 1.<br>

[0001] The concentrates were placed in glass vials and mixed for 4<br>
hours using a paint shaker. The vials were then allowed to stand for 3<br>
hours and examined to evaluate the dispersion uniformity. All the vials<br>
exhibited some solid precipitation after the three hour standing time. The<br>
particle size of any non-dispersed material and the speed at which the<br>
separated material redispersed after mixing was evaluated by inverting the<br>
vials and observing the movement of solid precipitates at the bottom of the<br>
vials. Formulation 5-6 and Formulation 5-13 made using KOC617 diutan<br>
gum appeared to provide the best results in this trial, as these concentrates<br>
exhibited a more uniform dispersion with smaller particles left on the<br>
container wall and more rapid redispersion than was observed for the other<br>
concentrates.<br>
[00142] The resulting 14 concentrates were diluted 1:5 with water and<br>
mixed for 3-5 minutes. All the formulations thickened following dilution.<br>
The resulting gels were visually examined for uniformity. When using<br>
-20-<br><br>
WO 2006/113144	PCT/US2006/012817<br>
benzyl alcohol as the floor finish dissolver, Formulation 5-6 formed the<br>
most uniform gel. When using ethylene glycol phenyl ether as the floor<br>
finish dissolver, Formulations 5-8, 5-12, 5-13 and 5-14 formed the most<br>
uniform gels.<br>

[00146] Formulations 7-1 and 7-3 through 7-5 were diluted with water<br>
and used to strip a vinyl tile floor coated with one coat of ORION two-part<br>
polyurethane finish or with a laminate finish system employing one coat of<br>
PADLOCK finish followed by one coat of ORION finish. The stripper<br>
formulations were applied to the finish, allowed to stand for 20 minutes and<br>
evaluated to determine the percent finish removed based on the stripper<br>
contact area. The laminate finish was more readily stripped, with<br>
Formulations 7-1 and 7-5 removing 100% of the laminate finish.<br>
Formulations 7-3 and 7-4 removed progressively lower amounts of the<br>
laminate finish. The formulations removed some but not all of the non-<br>
laminate finish. The respective stripping performances for the non-<br>
laminate finish were Formulation 7-5 &gt; Formulation 7-1 &gt; Formulation 7-4<br>

concentrate was mixed with water. The small (viz., ± 50 cps) diluted use<br>
solution viscosity variations observed from the first to last measurements<br>
for each sample appeared to represent normal measurement error rather<br>
than viscosity building.<br>
[00174] Formulation 21-1 and Formulation 21-2 were diluted 1:10 with<br>

[00180] Formulation 24-1, Formulation 24-2 and Formulation 24-3 were<br>
diluted 1:14 with water. Using a 15 minute standing time, Formulation 24-<br>
1 and Formulation 24-2 were used to strip a grocery store floor that had<br>
been coated with a basecoat of BRIGHTSTAR™ finish (Ecolab, Inc.) and<br>
MARKETSTAR™ finish topcoat (Ecolab, Inc.), both of which had been<br>
applied using a 50 m2/L (2000 ft2/gallon) coating rate.<br>
[00181] The stripping performance of Formulation 24-1 and Formulation<br>
24-2 was also compared side-by-side to that of BRIGHT BLAST™ stripper<br>
(Ecolab, Inc.). All three stripper formulations removed 100% of the finish.<br>
The performances of Formulation 24-1 and Formulation 24-2 were both<br>
significantly better than BRIGHT BLAST in that Formulation 24-1 and<br>
Formulation 24-2 both remained where applied, and did not flow under<br>
shelving or into areas that were not intended to be stripped. When<br>
scrubbed using a swing machine, Formulation 24-1 was observed to flow at<br>
most 25-50 mm (1-2 in.), Formulation 24-2 less than 25 mm (less than 1<br>
in.), and BRIGHT BLAST stripper up to 90 cm (up to 3 ft.) outside the<br>
machine path.<br>

1:6, 1:9, and 1:12. The three use-dilutions were then compared against the<br>
Comparison Example 4 formulation diluted at 1:3 to attain a desired<br>
viscosity and stripping power. The viscosities of the resulting stripper<br>
formulations were measured using a Brookfield viscometer and an HA No.<br>

[00184] The strippers were evaluated on tiles which had been coated<br>
with either GEMSTAR LASER or ISI STAR finish at a 50 m2/L (2000<br>
ft2/gallon) coating rate and aged at 50o C for 5 days. Stripping<br>
performance was evaluated by determining the percentage of contact area<br>
stripped when a thin layer of the stripper was coated atop the tile and left in<br>
place for a 15 minute contact time, and when a thick layer of the stripper<br>
was placed atop the tile inside a foam ring and left in place for a 10 minute<br>
contact time. For the GEMSTAR LASER coated tiles, all four diluted<br>
stripper formulations removed 100% of the finish in the thin layer test. In<br>
the ring test, the Example 25 1:12 dilution removed approximately 90% of<br>
the finish while the other three stripper formulations removed 100% of the<br>
finish. For the ISI STAR coated tiles, the Example 25 1:6 dilution and a<br>
1:6 dilution of the Comparison Example 4 stripper both removed 100% of<br>
the finish in both tests. The Example 25 1:9 dilution removed 60% of the<br>
finish in the ring test and 100% in the thin layer test. The Example 25 1:12<br>
dilution removed 10% of the finish in the ring test and 70% in the thin layer<br>
test.<br>

[00198] The results in Table 35 show that the addition of appropriate<br>
surfactants can provide improved or increased thickening efficiency. For<br>
example, the viscosity of Formulation No. 31-8 was improved from 210 cps<br>
to 1383 cps by the replacement of 4 parts of water with a mixture of 2 parts<br>
each of NEODOL 25-7 and NEODOL 25-3 nonionic surfactants (compare<br>
Formulation Nos. 31-7 and 31-8). Mixtures of water-soluble (e.g.<br>
NEODOL 25-7) and oil-soluble (e.g. NEODOL 25-3) nonionic surfactants<br>
also provided improved thickening efficiencies compared to use of the<br>
water-soluble surfactant alone (compare e.g., Formulation Nos. 31-1, 31-2<br>
and 31-3, and Formulation Nos. 31-5, 31-6 and 31-7).<br>

without severely impacting the use dilution viscosity. This may for<br>
example provide a more fluid, easier to pour concentrate. The viscosities<br>

Linoleum Stripper<br>
[0104] Linoleum flooring is difficult to strip without causing permanent<br>
discoloration or other damage to the flooring. A stripper is considered to<br>
be linoleum-safe if no discoloration or damage is observed after 10 minutes<br>
of stripper contact time. A thickened stripper formulation was prepared<br>
using triethanolamine and a reduced amount of monoethanolamine. The<br>
viscosities of the concentrate and a 7% diluted solution were measured<br>
using a BROOKFIELD viscometer and an HA/HB No. 6 spindle operated<br>
at 20 rpm. The formulation was applied to blue linoleum flooring and left<br>
in place for 10 minutes. No discoloration or damage was observed. The<br>
formulation was reapplied to the linoleum flooring and left in place for 20<br>
minutes, at which time discoloration was observed. The formulation and<br>
