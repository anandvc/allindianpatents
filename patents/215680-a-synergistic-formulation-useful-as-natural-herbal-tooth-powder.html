The above described formulations suffer from a number of disadvantages.<br>
1         Some formulations have harmful components e.g. Nicotiana tabacum which ultimately spoil the teeth and gum.<br>
2.	Adulteration of plant material is often there. Therefore, the formulations have not been<br>
found very effective.<br>
3.	The product very often have cheap materials and expansive items are not used in the<br>
prescribed quantity. Therefore, the final product is not very useful.<br>
4.	Very often the amount of base material is more compared to active components and<br>
thus the product is not very useful.<br>
The present invention relates to a formulation of herbal tooth powder for teeth and gums. Since the components in the formulation are from herbal source it is very safe and ecofriendly and do not produce any adverse effect.<br>

Medicinal Plants in Skin Care, CIMAP, 76-89, 1994), (c) powder of dried ginger (Zingiber officinale) with anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties (Chopra et al.. Glossary of Indian Medicinal Plants, 1956), (d) powder of Spilanthes calva which stimulates secretion of saliva (Farooqi et al.. J. Med. Arom. PI. Sci., 20:441-450, 1998), (e) powder of gall nuts of Quercus infectoria plant with astringent effect and able to check foul odour of mouth, toothache and swollen gums (The Wealth of India - Raw Materials, 1994), (f) powder of Usnea longissima, Santalum album, plants (The Wealth of India- Raw Material, 1994), alum and common salt. A combination of medicinal plants powder with alum and common salt can<br><br>
be used as a good house hold tooth powder which results in the protection of teeth from different diseases.<br>
The main diseases of the teeth include plaque, caries and pyorrhoea. Proper dental care is necessary for eliminating tooth decay and periodental diseases.

The traditional herbal preparations for dental care comprise of various types of herbal powders and chewing sticks made out of young woody stems or root pieces.<br>
The natural herbal products are in demand for use to control dental diseases. The natural herbs are harmless as they don't have side effects. They also have low mammalian toxicity and can be handled safely.<br>
The plants used in this formulation are very useful in pyorrhoea, tooth hypersensitivity, and are reported to be useful for relieving gum inflammation and tooth ache (Farooqi et al., J. Med. Arom. P1. Sci., 20:441-450, 1998). Zanthoxylum armatum plant as called toothache fruit as its main use is in toothache. Fruits of Z. armatum contain essential oil (1.5%). The main constituent of oil is linalool. The oil is disinfectant and antiseptic; therefore, fruit powder is used for toothache. Therefore, Z. armatum fruits are used as a component in the prepration of this formulations.<br><br>
Pistacia lentiscus, resinous exudate was also used in the prepration of dental powder. The resin has pleasent smell due to the presence of essential oil (12%) and is used as a filler for carrious teeth, for cleansing of teeth and to remove foul odour of the mouth. Powder of dried ginger (Zingiber officinale) was used as it contain resin and essential oil and it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties (Sushil Kumar et al..

Med. Arom. PI. Sci., 20:441-450, 1998). Paste of its flower is used in toothache or flower as such is chewed in toothache. Powder of gallnuts of Quercus inflectoria plant was used due to its astringent properties (The Wealth of India - Raw Materials, 1994). The powder is rich in tannic acid (50-70%). It is very useful for foul odour of mouth, toothache and swollen gums. Powder of Usnea longissima was used as it contain usnic acid and volatile oil and considered useful for gums in traditional system of medicine. It is filamentous, pendulus lichen common in temperate and alpine Himalayas (The Wealth of India - Raw Materials, 1994). Santalum album powder was used as it is used for local inflammation in traditional systems of medicine. The powder is rich in essential oil (1.5-6%) (Chopra et al..

i.	Alent 4% Usnea powder obtained from Usnea longissiana lichens.<br>
j.	The ratio of a-I physically mixed in a synergfistic  manner to  get the said tooth powder.<br><br>
The invention further provides a synergistic   formulation which is useful for the<br>
treatment of bleeding and swollen gums , toothache ,yellowing and staining of teeth,<br>
foul odour of mouth and sensitivity to hot/cold water/food.<br>

plants and it has astringent effect.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention Usnea   powder may be obtained from Usnea<br>
longissima lichens.<br>
The composition is not merely a mixture of the constituents. It is new and the ingredients have<br>
synergistic effect.<br>

34% people used that product for bleeding gums, while 38% used it for swollen gums. About 33% persons tested the tooth powder for yellowing/staining of teeth while 26% used it for foul odour of mouth. 20% checked it for sensitivity to cold/hot water/food, 16% for toothache and 8% for loosening of teeth (Table - 5).<br>
About     60%        persons      reported     it      moderately effective   for   bleeding   gums,   swollen   gums,   toothache, yellowing/staining of teeth and foul odour of mouth as well as sensitivity to cold/hot water/food.<br><br><br>
Any adverse effect was not reported on teeth, tongue and in oral cavity. House hold grinder was used for powdering the ingredients.<br>
The formulation is not a mere admixture resulting in mere aggregation of the properties of<br>
individual ingredients but a synergistic mixture resulting in enhanced effectiveness for tooth<br>
problems. In examples 5-7 the synergistic effect of the formulation of the present invention is<br>
detailed.<br>
