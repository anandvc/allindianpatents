				<td>PROCESS FOR POLYMERSING OLEFIN IN GAS PHASE<br>
The   invention  relates  to  a  process   for  the continuous   manufacture   of   ethylene    (co)polymers   and possibly  of   at   least  one  alpha-olefin  by  catalytic (co)polymerization  in  a  polymerization  zone   in  a  gaseous phase.<br>
In  a   (co-)polymerization  process   in  a  gaseous phase,   the  monomers  and  comonomers   if  any  may  remain occluded  in  the  porous   (co-)polymer  particles  and dissolved   in  particular  in  the  amorphous  parts  of   the (co-)polymer,   in  particular  when  the  comonomers   are relatively  heavy  alpha-olefins   comprising,   for  example, from  5   to   8   carbon  atoms  and  which  are  used  in  particular in  the  manufacture  of   linear  low-density  polyethylene.    In the  manufacture  of  high-density  polyethylene,   a relatively  high  polymerization  temperature   and  a   large amount   of   hydrogen  used  as   chain-limiting  agent  may promote   secondary  hydrogenation  reactions,    in  particular forming  organic   compounds   of   low  volatility,   containing, for  example,   from  4   to   12   carbon  atoms.   Moreover,   alkanes of   relatively  low  volatility  containing,   for  example, from  4   to   10   and  preferably  from  5   to  8   carbon  atoms,   may be  used  as   inert   constituents   in  processes   for  the polymerization  of  olefins   in  a  gaseous  phase  with  a  view to   improving  the  production.   These   organic   compounds   and alkanes   of   low  volatility  may  also   remain  occluded  and dissolved   in   the  porous   polyolefin  particles.    It   is generally   essential   to   remove   from  the    (co-)polymers produced,    the  unconverted   (co)monomers,   the   organic compounds   and   the   alkanes   of   relatively   low  volatility for   ecological   and  economic   reasons,   but   also   for   safety reasons.   All   these   compounds   constitute  a   load  on  the environment,    they   are   capable   of   forming   explosive<br>
mixtures   in  the  presence   of   atmospheric   oxygen  and  they adversely  affect   the   quality  of   the  products   due   to   the risk  of   the  prolongation  of  an  uncontrolled  residual polymerization  outside  the  polymerization  zone.   The absence  of   recovering  and  recycling  of  these  compounds, in  particular  of  the  unconverted   (co)monomers,   would  have the  effect   of   substantially  increasing  the  price  of   the polyolefins.<br>
Moreover,   it   is  desirable  to  manufacture polyolefins  of   a  quality  which  is   stable  with  time irrespective  of   the   low  amounts  of   catalytic   residues contained  in  the  polyolefins  and  to  avoid  	an   inopportune and  uncontrolled  prolongation  of   a  residual polymerization  after  transfer   of   the  polymer   out   of   the polymerization  zone.   A  polyolefin  is   sought   which  is  both of   stable   and  constant   quality  with  time  and  of   the highest  possible  whiteness.<br>
The   inventors   of   the  present   invention   found themselves   facing  two  apparently  antagonistic  problems. One  of   the  problems  possibly  consisted  in  prolonging  the process   for  the  manufacture  of   the  polyolefins  by  a suitable   post-treatment   in  order   to   improve   the   reduction in   the   residual   contents   of   unconverted   (co)monomers   and of   organic   compounds   and  alkanes   of   low  volatility  which are   occluded  and  dissolved  in  the  polyolefin  particles. The  other  problem  possibly  consisted  in  continuously producing  a  polyolefin  of   improved  quality,   more   stable and  constant  with  time,   despite  the  risks  of   fluctuations in   the   quality  of   the  polymer  which  were   due   to   the prolongation  of   the  process  by  the   said  post-treatment.<br>
American   Patent   No.   4,314,053   discloses   an olefin  polymerization  process   containing   steps   for deactivating   the   catalytic   residues   of   the   polymer   and for  reducing  the  oligomers   contained  in  the  polymer,    in particular  when   the   oligomers   have   a   non-stereospecific<br>
nature  as   in  polypropylene.   The  process  includes   flushing the  polymer  with  an   inert   gas   containing  water  and subsequently  placing  the  polymer  in  contact  with  a gaseous  mixture  containing  an  inert  gas,   water  and  a third  component   chosen  from  oxygen,   carbon  monoxide, carbon  dioxide,   alcohols   containing  from  1   to  4   carbon atoms  and  alkene  oxides   containing  from  2   to  4   carbon atoms.<br>
A  process  has  now  been  found  for  the (co)polymerization  of  ethylene   in  gaseous  phase  which allows  the  above-mentioned  problems  to  be  solved simultaneously.   In  particular,   a  simple  process  has  been found  allowing  both  an  improvement   in  the  reduction  of the  undesirable  volatile  organic  compounds   in  the   (copolymers   and  the  quality  of   the   (co-)polymers   such  that their  thermal   stability  and  their  whiteness,   in particular  during  their  conversion  into  finished products,   and  allowing  the  quality  of   the   (co-)polymers produced  continuously  to  be  rendered  more  stable  and constant  with  time.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the continuous manufacture of an ethylene (co)polymer by catalytic (co)polymerization of at least 30 per cent by volume of ethylene with at least one comonomer in a polymerization zone, in a gaseous phase through which passes an essentially gaseous reaction mixture comprising ethylene and at least the comonomer of the kind such as herein described at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, characterized in that the process additionally comprises:<br>
transferring a mixture (A) formed by the gaseous reaction mixture comprising the unconverted (co)monomer(s) and the solid (co)polymer containing active catalytic residues, from the polymerization zone to a depiressurization zone, and<br>
separating the mixture (A), after reduction of the pressure, into a solid phase (B) and a gaseous phase (C) which is sent directly or indirectly into the polymerization zone, the solid phase (B) being subjected to:<br>
(1)	at least one non-deactivating flushing with a gas or a gaseous mixture selected from nitrogen, gaseous reaction mixture comprising ethylene, hydrogen and at least one inert gas chosen from nitrogen and alkanes and one or more of the constituents of the said gaseous reaction mixture which is substantially free from any poison with respect to the active catalytic residues at a temperature of 40° to 110° and an absolute pressure of 0.1 to 0.4 MPa to result in the gaseous phase (D), and subsequently<br>
(2)	a deactivating flushing with a gaseous mixture of nitrogen, water and oxygen at a temperature of from 35° to 105° and at an absolute pressure of from 0.05 to 0.4 MPa.<br>
A process has thus been found for the continuous manufacture of an ethylene (co)polymer by catalytic (co)polymerization of ethylene with possibly at least one comonomer in a polymerization zone, in a gaseous phase through which passes as essentially gaseous reaction mixture comprising ethylene and possibly at least the comonomer, at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, characterized in that the process additionally comprises:<br>
-   transferring  a  mixture   (A)   formed   by   the   gaseous   reaction   mixture<br>
comprising   the   uncovered   (co)monomer(s)   and   the   solid   (co)polymer<br>
containing active catalytic,<br>
residues,   from  the  polymerization   zone   to  a depressurization  zone,   and<br>
-   separating  the  mixture   (A),   after  reduction  of the  pressure,   into  a  solid  phase   (B)   and  a gaseous  phase   (C)   which  is   sent  directly  or indirectly  into  the  polymerization  zone,   the solid  phase   (B)   being  subjected  to:<br>
(1)	at   least  one  non-deactivating  flushing with  a  gas  or  a  gaseous  mixture  which  is substantially  free   from  any  poison  with respect   to  the   active   catalytic   residues, and   subsequently<br>
(2)	a  deactivating  flushing  with  a  gaseous mixture   of   nitrogen,   water  and  oxygen.<br>
The   at   least   one  non-deactivating   flushing  and subsequently  the  deactivating  flushing  are  preferably carried  out  continuously.<br>
According  to  a  particular  aspect  of   the  present invention,   the  process   comprises   a  process   for  the continuous   manufacture   of   ethylene    (co)polymer  and possibly  of   at   least   one  olefinic   comonomer  by  catalytic<br>
(co)polymerization  of   ethylene  with  possibly  at   least   the olefinic   comonomer,   in  a  gaseous  phase  and  at   a  pressure greater   than  ambient   pressure,    in  particular  at   an absolute   pressure   of   0.5   to   5   MPa,   and  at   a   temperature below   the   melting  point,   preferably  below  the   softening temperature   of   the   (co)polymer,   in  particular  at   a temperature   of   40   to   120°C,    for  example   60   to   120°C   or   60 to   110°C,    in   a  polymerization   zone   containing   a mechanically   stirred  and/or   fluidized  bed   and  through which  passes   a  gaseous   reaction  mixture   comprising ethylene,    hydrogen,    at   least   one   inert   gas   and  possibly at   least   the   olefinic   comonomer,   transfer   of   the   mixture<br>
(A)    formed  by   the    (co)polymer  powder   in   the   form   of<br>
porous   particles   containing   the   active   catalytic   residues and  the   gaseous   reaction  mixture   accompanying  the   said powder  in  a  depressurization  zone,   separation  of   the mixture   (A),   after  reduction  of   the  pressure,   into  a solid  phase   (B)   and  a  gaseous  phase   (C),   sending  the gaseous  phase   (C)   directly  or   indirectly  to  the polymerization  zone,   and  at   least   two  continuous, different   and  successive   flushings  of  the   solid  phase (B),   a  first   comprising  at   least  one   flushing  using  a non-deactivating  gas  and  a  second  performed  using  a  gas which  is  deactivating  with  respect   to  the  active catalytic   residues   of   the    (co)polymer.   More   particularly, the   solid  phase   (B)    is   continuously  subjected,   in  the form  of   a  powder  consisting  of  porous  particles, successively  to  at   least   two  of   these  abovementioned flushings,   the  gaseous  phase   (D)   resulting  from  the  non-deactivating  flushing  preferably  being  sent,   at   least   in part   if   not   in   total,   directly  or   indirectly  into   the polymerization  zone.<br>
The    (co)polymer   is   manufactured  continuously   in   a gaseous   phase   in   a  polymerization   zone  which  may  contain a  mechanically   stirred  and/or   fluidized  bed,   through which  passes   an  ascending  stream  of   the   gaseous   reaction mixture   comprising   the   olefinic    (co)monomer(s)    to  be polymerized.   Only  part  of  the  olefins  polymerizes  while passing  through  the  bed,   so  the  gaseous   reaction  mixture exiting  the  polymerization  zone   is   sent  back  into   the latter  using  a  recycling  circuit  which  generally comprises   a   compressor  and  at   least   one   heat   exchanger which   is   capable   of   removing   the   heat   released   on polymerization.    It   is   preferred   to   use   a  polymerization zone   containing  a   fluidized  bed,    for   example   such   as described   in  European   Patent   Applications   No.    0   351   068 and  No.    0   352   022,    and  which   is   free   from  any  means   of mechanical   stirring.<br><br><br>
The  gaseous   reaction  mixture  preferably  comprises ethylene,   hydrogen  and  at   least  one   inert  gas  which  may be   chosen  from  nitrogen  and  alkanes   containing  from  1   to 12,   preferably  from  2   to   8   and  more  particularly  from  4 to   8   or  from  5   to   8   carbon  atoms,   for  example  n-hexane, n-pentane  and  isopentane.   The  process   is  particularly suitable   for  a  copolymerization  of  ethylene  with  at   least one   alpha-olefin,   such  that   the  gaseous   reaction  mixture additionally  comprises   at   least   one  olefinic  comonomer which  may  be   chosen  from  alpha-olefins   containing   from  3 to   12,   preferably  from  4   to  10   and  more  particularly  from 4   to   8   carbon  atoms,   for  example   chosen  from  propylene, 1-butene   and  preferably  1-pentene,   1-hexene,   4-methyl-1-pentene,    1-heptene   and   1-octene,   as   well   as   at   least   one non-conjugated  diene   such  as   ethylidenenorbornene,   4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene,   2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene,   1,5-hexadiene;,   dicyclopentadiene  and  1,4-hexadiene.   The gaseous   reaction  mixture  may  thus   contain  in  all   cases   a large   proportion  of   saturated  and/or  unsaturated  heavy hydrocarbons   of   relatively  low  volatility,    such  as   alpha-olefins   and  alkanes   containing   in  particular   from  4   to 10,   preferably  from  5   to   8   carbon  atoms.   The  heavy hydrocarbons   may  voluntarily  be   added  as   constituents   of the  gaseous   reaction  mixture   and/or  be   formed  in  situ   in the  polymerization   zone  by  secondary  reactions,    in particular  by  hydrogenation  reactions.   Under  the temperature   and  pressure   conditions   existing   in  the polymerization   zone,    it   may  be   observed  that   the saturated   and/or  unsaturated  heavy  hydrocarbons  may  be found  partly  absorbed  within  the  porous    (co-) polymer particles   being   formed  and  dissolved   in  particular   in   the amorphous   parts   of   the    (co-)polymer.    It   may  thus   be observed   that   in   the  polymerization   zone,   the  proportion of   saturated  and/or  unsaturated  heavy  hydrocarbons   in   the gaseous   reaction  mixture   may  be   from   1   to   50%,   preferably<br>
from  2   to   20%   and  more  especially  from  2   to   15%  by volume.   The  proportion  of   saturated  and/or  unsaturated heavy  hydrocarbons  absorbed  and  dissolved  in  the   solid (co)polymer  present   in  the  polymerization  zone  may  be from   0.1   to   20%,   preferably   from   0.5   to   15%,   by  weight.<br>
The  gaseous  reaction  mixture  preferably  circulates within  the  polymerization  zone,   at   a  total  pressure greater  than  ambient  atmospheric  pressure,   for  example  an absolute   total  pressure  of   0.5   to  5  MPa,   preferably  of   1 to   3   MPa,   and  at   a  temperature  below  the  melting  point, more   especially  below  the   softening  temperature  of   the (co)polymer  produced,   for  example  at   a   temperature   of   3 0 to   120°C,   preferably  of   40   to   110°C   or  of   60   to   105°C.<br>
The    (co)polymerization  is  generally  performed  by continuous   or   semi-continuous   addition  of   a   catalyst which   is   generally   in  the   solid   state   and  comprising  at least   one   transition  metal,   such  as   titanium,   vanadium, chromium,   zirconium  or  hafnium.   The   catalyst  may  be chosen   from   catalysts   of   Ziegler-Natta   type   associated with  a   co-catalyst   chosen   from  organometallic   compounds of   metals   of   groups   I   to   III   of   the   Periodic Classification  of   the   Elements,    for  examples organoaluminium  and  organozinc   compounds,   and  also   from heat-activated  chromium  oxide-based  catalysts.   The catalyst   also  may  be  chosen  from  metallocene   comprising  a transition  metal   e.g.   titanocene,   chromocene,    zirconocene or   hafnocene.   The   catalyst   may  be   supported  on  porous refractory  oxides   such  as   silica   or   alumina,   or  may  be combined   with   solid  magnesium  compounds   such  as  magnesium chloride,    oxide   or   hydroxychloride   or   a   magnesium alkoxide.   A  solid  catalyst   based  on  magnesium,   on halogen,   on   titanium  and/or  on  vanadium  may   in  particular be   used.   The   catalyst  may  also  be  used   in   the   form  of   an olefin  prepolymer.<br><br>
The   (co)polymer  continuously  produced  in  the polymerization  zone  may  either  be  a  homopolyethylene  or  a copolymer  of   ethylene  with  at   least  one  alpha-olefin  and possibly  with  a  non-conjugated  diene,   such  as   the  alpha-olefins   and  the  dienes  mentioned  above.   It  may  be   a  high-density  polyethylene,    in  particular  with  a   density  of 0.94   to   0.97   g/cm3    or  a   linear  low-density  polyethylene, in  particular  with  a  density  greater  than  or  equal   to 0.88   and   less   than   0.94   g/cm   ,   or  alternatively  an elastomeric   copolymer  of   EPR  or  EPDM  type,    in  particular with  a  density  of   less  than  0.88  g/cm3   and  more particularly  with  a  density  of   0.85   to   0.86   g/cm3.    It   is provided   in  the   form  of   a  powder  consisting  of  porous particles   with  a  weight   average   diameter  Dw  which  may range   from  400   to   3000,   preferably   from  500   to   2 00 0   and more   especially   from   600   to   1500  µm,   and  a   relatively narrow  particle   size   distribution  such   that   the   ratio  of Dw  to   the;  number  average  diameter  Dn  of   the  particles   is between   1   and  4,   preferably  between   1.1   and  3.5   and   in particular   from  1.2   to  3.   The   (co)polymer  powder  may  be characterized  by  flow  properties   and  may  in  particular  be defined  by   a   classification  given   in   "Gas   Fluidization Technology"   edited  by  D.   Geldart   and  published  by  A. Wiley-Interscience   Publication/John  Wiley   &amp;   Sons    (1986), chapter   3,   pages   33   to   52:   the  powder  may  generally correspond,    according   to   this   classification,   to   the groups   B   and  D   in  particular  and  preferably   to   group   B. As  noted  above,   under  the  conditions   for  polymerization, the   (co)polymer  powder  may  contain  large   amounts  of absorbed   and   dissolved,    saturated   and/or  unsaturated heavy  hydrocarbons.    It   additionally  contains   active catalytic   residues   which  may  be   identified   in   the   form  of transition   metals   and  possibly  of   organometallic compounds   such  as   organoaluminium  and  organozinc compounds.   Their   amounts   are   generally  very   low,    such<br>
that   the   catalytic  residues  may  remain  in  the   final (co)polymer.    In  particular,   the   transition  metal   content in  the   (co)polymer  produced  is   less   than  20  parts  per million   (ppm)   by  weight,   preferably  from   1   to   15   and  more particularly  from  1   to   10  ppm,   or  even  less   than  1  ppm. The  mixture   (A)   formed  by  the   (co)polymer  powder and  the  gaseous   reaction  mixture  accompanying  the  powder is   transferred  from  the  polymerization  zone   into  a depressurization  zone.   The  transfer  may  be  performed continuously  or,   preferably,   semi-continuously  or intermittently,   for  example  by  isolating  a  determined volume   of   the   mixture    (A)   withdrawn   from  the polymerization  zone   in  an  intermediate  chamber  fitted with  valves,   before   transferring  the   said  mixture   into the  depressurization  zone.   This  may  in  particular  be performed  according   to   the  method  described   in  European Patent  Application  No.   0   250   169.   The   transfer   is essentially  carried  out   by  difference   in  pressure   between the  polymerization  and  depressurization   zones.   The absolute  pressure  which  governs   in  the  depressurization zone   is   in  the   region  of   ambient   atmospheric  pressure,    in particular   a  pressure   of   0.1   to   0.4   MPa,   preferably   from 0.1   to   0.3   MPa,   in  particular   from  0.11   to   0.2 5   MPa.<br>
Separation  of   the  mixture    (A)    into   a   solid  phase (B)   and  a.  gaseous  phase   (C)   may  be  preferably  carried  out continuously  and  may  take  place   essentially  by  the pressure   reduction  in  the  depressurization   zone,   which pressure   is  brought   to  the  abovementioned  level.   During the   separation  of   the   mixture    (A),   the   temperature   of   the mixture   is   in   the   region   of   that   of   the   temperature governing   in   the  polymerization   zone   or   slightly  below this,    for   example   a   temperature   of   30   to   115°C, preferably   of   40   to   105°C   or  of   55   to   100°C.   The   solid phase    (B)   may  be   separated   from  the   gaseous   phase    (C) simply  by   flowing   out,    for   example   by  gravity,    in   the<br>
depressurization  zone.   Thus,   the   solid  phase   (B)   may  be recovered  in  the   lower  part  of   the  depressurization  zone. The  gaseous  phase   (C)   may  essentially  comprise   the gaseous   reaction  mixture  accompanying  the   (co)polymer powder  during  its   transfer,   as  well  as   the   constituents of   the   said  gaseous  reaction  mixture  and  the  possible saturated  and/or  unsaturated  heavy  hydrocarbons  which  are initially  absorbed  and  dissolved  in  the  powder  and  which are  progressively  degassed  during  the  transfer  and  the separation   in  the  depressurization  zone.   The  gaseous phase    (C)    is   preferably  continuously  returned  directly  or indirectly   into   the  polymerization   zone   using,    for example,   a   compressor.    It   may   in  particular  be   returned to  any  point  of  the  recycling  circuit  of   the  gaseous reaction  mixture.<br>
The   solid  phase   (B)   separated  from  the  gaseous phase   (C)   may  essentially  comprise  the   (co)polymer  powder of   the  mixture   (A)   with  a  smaller  amount   of   the constituents   of   the   gaseous   reaction  mixtuare   and  of   the possible   saturated  and/or  unsaturated  heavy  hydrocarbons which  have   not  yet   been  removed.   Generally,   when   the solid  phase   is   subjected  to   the   operation   consisting solely  of   the   separation  described  above,   the  average residence   time   of   the    (co)polymer  powder   in   the depressurization  zone   is  preferably  relatively  short, because   the  powder  contains   active   catalytic   residues   in an   active   polymerization  atmosphere.   The   average residence   time  may  be  approximately  from  a   few  seconds   to a   few  minutes,    for   example   from   5   to   60 0   seconds, preferably   from   10   to   300   or   from   30   to   200   seconds.    The solid  phase    (B)   may  generally  have  physical characteristics   and   flow  properties  which  are   similar   to those   defined  above   for  the    (co)polymer  powder   in   the polymerization  zone.<br>
The  solid  phase   (B)   is  subsequently  subjected preferably  continuously  to  at   least  one  non-deactivating flushing  with  a  gas   or  a  gaseous  mixture  which   is substantially  free   from  any  poison  with  respect   to  the active   catalytic  residues.   In  particular,   the   content   of poisons   in  the  gas  or  in  the  gaseous  mixture   for  flushing preferably  cannot  be  greater  than  that  of   the  gaseous reaction  mixture  circulating  in  the  polymerization  zone. Thus,    it   is  generally  estimated  that   the   content  of poisons   such  as  water,   oxygen,   alcohols,   carbon  monoxide and  carbon  dioxide,    in   the   gaseous   reaction  mixture   is less   than  2   parts  by  volume  per  million   (vpm),   preferably less   than   1  vpm  and  more  particularly  less   than   0.5   or even  0.1   vpm.   The  gas  or  the  gaseous  mixture   for  flushing may  be   chosen  from  nitrogen,   the  gaseous   reaction  mixture and  one   or  more   of   the   constituents   of   the   said  gaseous reaction  mixture,   preferably  mixed  with  nitrogen.    It   is preferred   to  use   the  gaseous   reaction  mixture  which circulates   in  the  polymerization   zone   and  some   of   which may  be   withdrawn   in  order   to   flush  the   solid  phase    (B) continuously.   In  this   case,   the  gaseous   reaction  mixture may  preferably  be  used  at   a  temperature  equivalent   to  or in   the   region  of   that   of   the  polymerization   zone,   or possibly   at   a   lower   temperature   obtained  by  prior   cooling of   the   said  mixture,    for  example   a   temperature   of   2 0   to 110°C   or   of   45   to   105°C,   preferably  of   60   to   100°C.    It may  also   be   preferred  to  use   one   or  more   of   the constituents,   preferably  the   hydrocarbon  constituents,   of the   gaseous   reaction  mixture,    in  particular   ethylene, alpha-olefins   and  alkanes   such  as   those   mentioned  above. In   this   case,    it   is  preferred   to  use   one   or  more   of   these constituents   as   a  mixture   with  nitrogen,   at   a   temperature which  may  be   from   50   to   110°C,    or   from  45   to   105°C, preferably   from   60   to   100°C.   The   proportion   of   nitrogenin  the  mixture  may  be   from  30   to   90%,   preferably  from  40 to   80%,   by  volume.<br>
Advantageously  the  gaseous  phase   (D)   resulting from  the  nondeactivating  flushing  may  preferably continuously  be   sent,   at   least   partly  if   not   totally, directly  or  indirectly  into  the  polymerization  zone.   It may  be   sent   to   any  point   of   the   recycling  circuit   of   the gaseous   reaction  mixture.   It  may  also  undergo  a fractionation,   for  example  by  cooling:   a  light   fraction may  thus   be   separated   from  a  heavy  fraction   in  this gaseous  phase,   each  of  the  fractions  being  sent,   in  the gaseous  or   liquid  state,   to  identical  or  different  points of   the  polymerization  zone  or  of  the  recycling  circuit   of the  gaseous   reaction  mixture.<br>
According  to  a   first   advantageous   variant   of   the process,    the   separation  of   the  mixture    (A)    and  the   non-deactivating   flushing  may  be  performed  simultaneously   in the   deprejssurization   zone.    In  this   case,   the   gaseous phases    (C)   and   (D)   are   sent   together,   directly  or indirectly,   into  the  polymerization  zone,   for  example into  the   recycling  circuit  of  the  gaseous   reaction mixture,   possibly  after  having  undergone   a   fractionation as   described  above.<br>
A  second  advantageous   variant   of   the   process   may consist   in  performing  the  non-deactivating  flushing  and the   separation  of   the  mixture    (A)    in  a  distinct   manner. In   this   case,   the   gaseous  phase    (D)    resulting   from  the non-deactivating   flushing  may  advantageously  be   at   least partly  recycled  as   a   flushing  gas   in  the   said  non-deactivating   flushing.   The   recycling  may   include   a fractionaixion  of   the   gaseous   phase    (D) ,    for   example   by cooling,    allowing   the   separation  of   a   light   fraction   in the   gaseous   state   which   is   recycled  as   a   flushing   gas   in the  non-deactivating  flushing,   and  a  heavy  fraction   in the   liquid   state   which   can  be   sent   directly   or   indirectly<br>
into  the  polymerization  zone,   for  example   to  any  point   of the   recycling  circuit  of  the  gaseous   reaction  mixture.<br>
Another  variant  of   the  process  may  also  consist   in performing  at   least   two  non-deactivating  flushings,   the first   flushing  according  to   the   first   variant,    followed by   the   second   flushing  according  to   the   second  variant.<br>
The   average  residence  time  of   the   solid  phase subjected  to  the  non-deactivating  flushing  may  be   in total   from  2   to  180   and  preferably  from  5   to  120  minutes. During  the   separation  of   the  mixture   (A),   the  average residence  time  of  the  solid  phase   (B)   in  the depressurization   zone  may  become   identical   to   that mentioned  above  when,   according  to   the   first   variant,   the separation  of   the  mixture    (A)    is   performed   simultaneously with  the   non-deactivating  flushing.   The  non-deactivating flushing  may  preferably  be  performed  at   a  temperature greater  than  the  dew  point  of  the   flushing  gas  and  below the  melting  point,   preferably  at   the   softening  point   of the    (co) polymer.   In  particular,   the   temperaiture  may  be from  40   to   110°C,   preferably   from  45   to   105°C  or   from   50 to   100°C.   During  the   non-deactivating   flushing,   the absolute   pressure  may  be   in  the   region  of   or   identical   to that   governing   in   the   depressurization   zone:,    in particulair   from   0.1   to   0.4   MPa,   preferably   from   0.1   to 0.3   MPa   and  more  particularly   from   0.11   to   0.2 5   MPa.   When several   non-deactivating   flushings   are  performed,    the temperature   and  pressure  may  be   identical   or  different   in each  of   the   flushings..<br>
Subsequently  the   solid  phase   resulting   from   the non-deactivating   flushing   is   preferably  continuously subjected   to   a   deactivating   flushing  with  a   gaseous mixture   of   nitrogen,   water   and  oxygen.   The   gaseous mixture   essentially  contains   nitrogen  and  preferably  very low  amouncs   of   water  and  oxygen.   These   amounts   are preferably   calculated   relative   to   the    (co)polymer<br>
subjected  to  the   flushing,   such  that   at   least   the majority  of   the   catalytic   residues  of   the    (co)polymer   is deactivated  during  this   flushing.   Thus,    it   is  preferred for  the  water  to  be  used  in  an  amount  of,   for  example, from   50   to   4000,   preferably   from   100   to   20 00,   parts   by weight  per  million   (ppm)   relative   to  the   (co)polymer flushed.   It   is   also  preferred  for  the  oxygen  to  be  used in  an  amount   of,    for  example,    from  5   to   10 00   and preferably   from   10   to   500   ppm  relative   to   the    (co)polymer flushed.   The  amounts  of  water  and  of  oxygen  may  depend upon   the   contents   of   active   catalytic   residues   in   the (co)polymer.   It  has  also  been  observed  that   if   the   amount of   water  was   too  high,   bubbles   or   "lenses"   could   appear in   the    (co)polymer  at   the  moment   of   conversion   into granules  or  into  the   finished  products  e.g.   films.   It   has also  been  noticed  that   if  excessive  amounts   of  oxygen were  used,   a  certain  degradation  of   the   (co)polymer,   for example  by  crosslinking,   could  occur  during  the conversion.   The  deactivating   flushing  has   a   remarkable effect   on   the  removal  of   the   saturated  and/or  unsaturated hydrocarbons  which  are   absorbed  and  dissolved   in  the (co)polymer.<br>
The  average  residence  time  of  the   solid  phase subjected   to   the   deactivating   flushing  may  be   from   0.2   to 5   hours,   preferably   from   0.5   to   3   hours   and  more particularly  greater   than   1   hour  and   less   than   3   hours. The   deactivating   flushing  may  preferably  be   performed   at a   temperature   above   the   dew  point   of   the   gaseous   mixture for   flushing,   and  below  the  melting  point,   preferably  at the   softening  point   of   the    (co)polymer.    In  particular, the   temperature   may  be   from   35   to   105°C,   preferably   from 4 0   to   10 0°C  or   from   50   to   100°C.   During   the   deactivating flushing,    the   absolute   pressure   may  be   identical   to   or   in the   region  of   that   governing   in   the   depressurization   zone or   in   the   non-deactivating   flushing.    In   certain   cases,    it<br><br>
may  be  below  or  even  above   that  governing  in  the  non-deactivating  flushing.   It  may,   for  example,   be   from  0.05 to   0.4   MPa,   preferably  from  0.1   to   0.3   MPa,   in  particular from   0.11   to   0.25   MPa.<br>
The  gaseous  mixture   for  the  deactivating  flushing may  advantageously  be  prepared  by  addition  of   oxygen  or air  to  nitrogen  or  to  a  premixture  of  nitrogen  and  water, in  particular  using  a  compressor  pump   in  which  the carrier  gas,   sometimes   also   referred  to   as   the  vehicle gas,   is  nitrogen  or  the  premixture.   The  dimensions   of   the compressor  pump  may  be   such  that   the   flow  rate   for  the addition  of   oxygen  or  of   air   is   easily  achieved  without manipulation  of   a  control  valve.   The  advantage  of   the process   appears   when   the   carrier  gas   accidentally  ceases to   circulate,   and  when  this   cessation  brings   about   an automatic   arrest   in  the   addition  of  oxygen  or  air.   This appears  as  an  important   safety  measure   in  order  to  avoid the  production  of  gaseous  mixtures  with  an  explosive nature.<br>
During   the   non-deactivating  and/or   the deactivating   flushings,   the   flushing  gas   flows  preferably countercurrently  and  continuously  through  the   solid  phase which  may   flow  preferably  by  gravity.   Flowing  of   the solid  phase  may  advantageously  take  place  according  to one  mode   in  a  continuous  dense  phase,   that   is  to  say  the flushing  gas  passing  preferably  continuously  through  the solid  phase   as  an  ascending  current   at   a  rate  below  the minimum   fluidization  rate,   Vmf,   of   the   solid  phase,    in particular   a   rate  between   0.1   x  Vmf   and   0.9   x  Vmf, preferably  between   0.1   x  Vmf   and   0.8   x  Vmf,    for   example an   ascending   rate   of   1   to   10   cm/s   or   of   1   to   8   cm/s.    This type   of   flushing   is  preferably  used   in  each  of   the flushings   of   the   process.   The   flushing  gas   is   preferably continuously   introduced   into   the   lower  part   or   the   bottom of   the   downward   flowing   solid  phase   subjected  to   these<br>
flushings  and  e.g.   contained  in  a  vertical   column.   More particularly  when  in  the  deactivating  flushing,   the flushing  gas   flows  countercurrently  through  the  solid phase   flowing  downwards  preferably  by  gravity,   it   is preferred  to   introduce   separately  and  preferably continuously   into   the   solid  phase   a  portion  or  all   of   one or  two  constituent(s)   of  the   flushing  gas   comprising  a gaseous  mixture  of  nitrogen,   water  and  oxygen,   and particularly  at   different   levels   of   the   downward   flowing solid  phase.   Thus,   it   is  preferred  to   introduce continuously  into  the   solid  phase   flowing  downwards   e.g. by  gravity  a  first  mixture  essentially  comprising  a gaseous  mixture  of  nitrogen  and  oxygen  preferably  in  the lower  part   or  the  bottom  of   the  downward  flowing  solid phase,   and   at   least   a   second  mixture   essentially comprising   a  gaseous   mixture   of   nitrogen,   water  and optionally  oxygen  at   a   level   higher   than   the   introduction point   of   the   first   mixture.   The    (co-)polymer  powder   thus flushed   is  particularly  dry  and  exhibits   a   low  content   of: residual   volatiles   which  would  otherwise   result   in inferior  product  performance  e.g.   with  formation  of   small "lenses"   when  the   (co-)polymer  is   transformed  into   films.<br>
The    (co)polymer   obtained  by  the  process   of   the invention   advantageously  has   an  extremely   low  content   of saturated  and/or  unsaturated  hydrocarbons,    such  as ethylene   or  unconverted  alpha-olefins   and  alkanes   of   low volatility.   Simultaneously,   by  a   synergy  effect   between the   flushings   and   in  particular   the   simultaneous   use   of water  and  oxygen  which  are   diluted   in  nitrogen,   a (co)polymer   is   obtained  of   remarkable  whiteness   and  of   a thermal   stability   such  that,   during   the   conversion   into granules   or   into   finished  products,   the   characteristics of   the    (co)polymer   such  as   the  melt   index  or   the   weight-average   molecular  mass,   virtually  do  not   change   or   change very   little.   A  reduction   in   the   amount   of   known   additives such  as   stabilizing  agents  or  antioxidants  may advantageously  be  performed  during  the  conversion, without  harming  the  thermal   stability  of  the   (co)polymer.<br>
Measurement   of   the  whiteness   index   (Wi)    and  the yellowing  index   (Yi-1)   of  the   (co)polymers<br>
The  method  used   is   that   described  by  ASTM-E-313 for  the  whiteness   index   (Wi)   and  by  ASTM-D-1925   for  the yellowing   index.<br>
The   colorimeter  used  is   the   "HUNTER-LAB  D  25-9"      ®     automatic  colorimeter  with  incorporated microprocessor,   manufactured  by  HUNTERLAB.<br>
It   emerges   from  this   method  that   when  an increase   in   the   degree   of   whiteness   of   a   (co)polymer   is observed,   the   value   of   the   index   (Wi)    increases   whereas that   of   the   index   (Yi-1)   decreases.<br>
Measurement   of   the  melt   index   (Mi2.16)    of a (co)polymer<br>
The   melt   index   (Mi2.16)    is  measured  under   a load  of   2.16   kg,   at   190°C,   according  to   the  method  ASTM-D-12 3 8   -   condition  E.<br>
Measurement   of   the   content   of   volatile   organic compounds   in  the   (co)polymers<br>
Measurement   of   the   content   of  volatile   organic compounds   in   the    (co)polymers   is  performed  according   to the   "static   head-space"   extraction  method  as   described   in its   general   principle   by  B.   Kolb  et   al.    in "Chromatographia",   Vol.    15,   No.    9    (1982),   pages   587-594 and  Vol.    19    (1984),   page   113.   The   method  consists   in placing   a   sample   of   0.5   g  of    (co)polymer   in   the   chamber with   a  volume   of   22   ml   of   the   "Head-Space   PERKIN-ELMER HS-40"    ®     apparatus   manufactured  by   PERKIN-ELMER,    and in   heating   to   100°C   the   sample   enclosed   in   the   chamber, in  which  a  thermodynamic  equilibrium  becomes  established between  the  gaseous  phase  and  the   solid  phase.   Some  of the  gaseous  phase   is   then   injected  into  a   "PERKIN-ELMER AUTOSYSTEM"    ®  reference  gas   chromatography  apparatus manufactured  by  PERKIN-ELMER,    and  equipped   with   a   "MEGA-BORE"   ®     reference  chromatography  column  manufactured by  CHROMPACK  and   flame   ionization  detection.   The measurement   is   expressed  in  micrograms  of   a  volatile organic   compound  containing  2   to  12   carbon  atoms  per  gram of    (co)polymer,   i.e.   in  parts  per  million   (ppm)   by weight.<br>
The  non-limiting  examples  which  follow illustrate   the   present   invention.<br>

A  linear  low-density  polyethylene  powder  was produced  by  copolymerization  of   ethylene   with   1-hexene   in a   fluidized  bed  reactor  of   diameter   0.75   m  comprising   a circuit   for   recycling  the   gaseous   reaction  mixture equipped  with  a  compressor  and  a  heat   exchanger.   The copolymerization  was  performed  under  an  absolute  pressure of   1.6   MPa   and  at   a   temperature   of   8 0°C,    in   the   presence of   a  catalyst  of   Ziegler-Natta  type  based  on  titanium, magnesium  and   chlorine,   which   is   identical   to   that   used in  Example   1   of   French   Patent   No.   2,405,961.   The   gaseous reaction  mixture  used  for  the  copolymerization  contained (%   by  volume)    30%   of   ethylene,    5%   of   1-hexene,    9%   of hydrogen  and   56%   of   nitrogen.   The   copolymer   thus   obtained had  a   density  of   0.916   g/cm3   and  a  melt   index,   MI2.16,    of 2.7   g/   10   minutes.   The   copolymer  powder   had   an   apparent density  of   0.32   g/cm     and  consisted  of   particles   with   a weight-average   diameter  of   approximately   1000   jxm.   At   the moment   of   its   withdrawal   from  the   reactor,    the  powder contained   approximately   6%  by  weight   of  unconverted   1-hexene,    which  was   absorbed  and  dissolved   in   the copolymer.   The  powder  additionally  contained  active catalytic   residues,   in  particular  15  ppm  of   titanium.<br>
The  copolymer  powder  accompanied  by  part   of   the gaseous   reaction  mixture  was   transferred  according  to  a semi-continuous  mode  and  at  a  flow  rate  of   6 0  kg/h  from the  reactor  into  an  intermediate  chamber  fitted  with rotating  valves,   as   described   in  EP-A-0   250   169,   and   then into   a  depressurization   zone   governed  by  an   absolute pressure   of   0.127  MPa.   The  powder   flowed  out   by  gravity in  the  depressurization  zone,   whereas   a  gaseous  phase separated  from  it.   Simultaneously,   a  non-deactivating flushing  was  performed  continuously  in  the depressurization  zone  by  introducing,   into  the   lower  part of   the   said   zone,   some   of   the   gaseous   reaction  mixture passing   through  the  polymerization   zone,   which  was withdrawn   in   the   recycling  circuit,   as   flushing  gas,    at   a temperature   of   80°C.   The   flushing  gas  passed  in countercurrent   to  the  powder,   which  flowed  out  by  gravity according   to  a  dense   continuous  phase  mode.    It   circulated at   a   flow   rate   of   10   Nm3/h  and  at   an  ascending   rate   below the  minimum  rate   of   fluidization  of   the  powder.<br>
The   gaseous  phase   resulting   from  the   separation   and from  the   non-deactivating   flushing  of   the  powder  was   sent via   a   compressor   into   the   recycling   circuit   and consequently  into  the   fluidized  bed  reactor.   The   average residence   time  of   the  powder   in  the  depressurization   zone was   approximately  5  minutes   and  the   temperature  of   the powder   was   approximately   75°C.<br>
The   powder  was   subsequently  continuously  transferred from   the   depressurization   zone   to   the   top   of   a   column   of diameter   0.4   m   and  of   height   8   m,    ending   in   a   conical base  poinding  downwards.   The   powder  was   introduced continuously   into   this   column  by  a   rotating   valve   at   a flow  rate  of   60   kg/h  in  order  to  undergo  a  deactivating flushing.   The   temperature   of   the  powder   in   the   column  was 65°C  and  the  absolute  pressure  was   0.115  MPa.   The  powder settled  out   towards   the  bottom  of  the  column  according  to a  dense   continuous  phase  regime.   A  gaseous  mixture consisting  of  nitrogen  and  small   amounts  of  water  and oxygen  was   produced  by   successive   additions   of   water   and air  to  nitrogen  by  means   of   a  compressor  pump,   and  was preheated  to   8 0°C  before  being  introduced  into  the  base of   the   column.   Various   amounts  of  water  and  of  oxygen used  in  the  gaseous  mixture  are  mentioned  in  Table   1.   The gaseous  mixture  used  as  deactivating  flushing  gas  was introduced  continuously  at   a   flow  rate  of   10   kg/h  and rose   in   the   column   in  countercurrent   to   the   powder.   The powder  exited  continuously  at   the  base   of   the   column  by means   of   a  rotating  valve.   The  average  residence   time   of the  powder   in  the   column  was   2.5   hours.<br>
Table   2   indicates  the  residual  contents  of  volatile organic   compounds   in   the   copolymer   following  entry   into and  exit   from  the  deactivating   flushing   column.<br>
The   copolymer  powder  exiting  the   column  was converted   into  granules   using  an   "APV  MP   2065"     ® granulator  manufactured  by  APV  Baker  Ltd.<br>
During   the   granulation,   various   additive compositions   (antioxidants,   stabilizing  agents)   were added  to   the   copolymer:<br>
-	a   composition  M   containing,   by  weight   relative   to   the<br>
copolymer:<br>
1000   ppm  of   calcium  stearate,<br>
3 00   ppm  of   "IRGANOX   1010"      ®     manufactured  by CIBA-GEIGY,    and<br>
800   ppm   of    "IRGAFOS   PEPQ"       ®     sold   by   CIBA-GEIGY;<br>

Table   3   shows   the   change   in  melt   index  of   the copolymer  before  and  after  granulation,   as  well   as   the whiteness   and  yellowing   indices   for   the   granules obtained.<br>
Analysis   of   Tables   2   and  3   shows   that, according   to   the  process   of   the   invention,    the   residual contents  of  volatile  organic  compounds  were  extremely low,   and   that   simultaneously  the   copolymer  had  a  very high  thermal   stability  during  the  granulation  and  a remarkable  whiteness,   even  when  the  additives  were reduced   (antioxidants,   stabilizing  agents)   as   in  the composition  N.   The  very  high  thermal   stability  is   shown by   the   very  low  variation   in   the   melt   index,   MI2.16'   °f the   copolymer  before   and  after  granulation,   even  when   the. composition  N  of   low   formulation  was   used.<br>

Example   2<br>
The  process  was  performed  exactly   as   in  Example 1,   except   that   the   1-hexene  was   replaced  by  4-methyl-l-pentene   and  the  gaseoias   reaction  mixture  contained   (%  by volume)    37%   of   ethylene,    7%   of   hydrogen,    10%   of   4-methyl-1-pentene  and  46%  of  nitrogen.   The   copolymer  thus obtained  had  a  density  of   0.918   g/cm     and  a  melt   index, MI2.16'   of 0.9   g/10   minutes.   The   copolyiner  powder  had  an apparent   density  of   0.3   g/cm3   and  consisted  of  particles having   a  weight-average   diameter  of   1100   pirn,   a   titanium content  of   8  ppm  and,   at  the  moment  of   its   removal   from the   reactor,   a   content   of   6%   by  weight   of   unconverted  4-methyl-1-pentene  which  was  absorbed  and  dissolved  in  the copolymer.<br>

Table   5   indicates   the   residual   contents   of volatile   organic   compounds   in  the   copolymer   following entry   into   and  exit   from  the   deactivating   flushing column.<br>
During  the   granulation,   various   additive compositions    (antioxidants,   stabilizing  agents)   were used:<br>
-	a   composition   P   containing,   by  weight   relative   to   the<br>
copolymer:<br>
1000   ppm  of   calcium   stearate,<br>

Example   3<br>
The  process   was   performed  exactly  as   in  Example 1,   except   that   the   1-hexene  was   replaced  by  1-butene   and that   the   gaseous   reaction  mixture   used   for   the copolymerization  contained   (%  by  volume)   36%  of   ethylene, 2%   of   1-butene,   20%   of   hydrogen,    34%   of   nitrogen,    6%   of n-pentane   and  2%   of   isopentane,   at   a   temperature   of   91°C. The   copolymer   thus   obtained  had  a  density  of   0.950   g/cm3 and  a  melt   index,   MI2.16,   of   11   g/10   minutes.   The copolymer  powder  had  a  density  of   0.38   g/cm3   and consisted  of  particles  with  a  weight-average  diameter  of approximately  1100   /im.   At   the  moment   of   its   removal   from the   reactor,   the  powder  contained  approximately  4%  by weight   of   C5   alkanes  which  were  absorbed  and  dissolved. It   additionally  contained  active   catalytic   residues,    in particular   7   ppm  of   titanium.<br>
The   copolymer   powder   exiting   the   reactor underwent   separation   into   a   solid  phase   and   a   gaseous phase   and  a  non-deactivating   flushing  of   the   solid  phase<br>
under  identical   conditions   to  those  of  Example   1,   except that   the   flow  rate  of  the  copolymer  powder  transferred from  the   reactor  to  the  depressurization  zone  was   100 kg/h  and  that   the   temperature   of   the  powder   in   the depressurization   zone  was   approximately   80°C.<br>
The  powder  was   subsequently  continuously transferred   from  the   depressurization   zone   to   the   top   of the   deactivating  flushing  column  as  described  in  Example 1.   The   flow  rate   of  powder   introduced   into   the   column  was 10 0   kg/h.   The  temperature  of  the  powder  in  the  column  was 6 5°C   and  the   absolute  pressure  was   0.11   MPa.<br>
A  gaseous  mixture   consisting  of   nitrogen  and  of low  amounts   of   water   and  of   oxygen  was   introduced   as deactivating   flushing  gas   in   counter-current   to   the powder   according   to   identical   conditions   to   those   of Example   1,   except   for  the   fact   that   the  average   residence time   of   the  powder   in   the   column  was   2   hours.   Table   7 indicates   the   amounts   of  water  and  of   oxygen   introduced.<br>
Table   8   indicates   the   residual   contents   of volatile   organic   compounds   in   the   copolymer   following   its entry   into   and  exit   from  the  deactivating   flushing column.<br>
The   copolymer  powder   exiting  the   column  was<br>
granulated  as   in  Example   1,   except   that   a  composition  of<br>
additives    (antioxidants,   stabilizing  agents)   was  used,<br>
