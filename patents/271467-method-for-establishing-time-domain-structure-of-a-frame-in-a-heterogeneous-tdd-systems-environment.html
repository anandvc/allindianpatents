[SPECIFICATION]<br>
[Title of the Invention]<br>
THE METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING TIME DOMAIN STRUCTURE OF A FRAME<br>
IN A HETEROGENEOUS TDD SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENT<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The following description of the present invention<br>
relates to a method of establishing a time domain structure of<br>
a frame in an environment where heterogeneous TDD systems co-<br>
exist.<br>
[Field Background]<br>
In case of wideband telecommunications systems, in order<br>
to maximize the efficiency of limited wireless (or radio)<br>
resources, a number of more effective transmitting and<br>
receiving methods in time, space, and frequency domains and<br>
the respective application methods have been proposed.<br>
Particularly, the multi carrier OFDM method has the advantages<br>
of reducing the complexity of a receiving end in a frequency<br>
selective fading environment that occurs in a wideband channel<br>
and, also, of maximizing spectral efficiency through selective<br>
scheduling in a frequency domain by applying different channel<br>
characteristics (or attributes) of a subcarrier. Furthermore,<br>
by allocating (or assigning) different subcarriers to multiple<br>
users, the OFDM method is extendable to an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) method, thereby<br>
being capable of enhancing the efficiency of the wireless<br><br><br>
resource in the frequency domain.<br>
As the WirelessMAN-OFDMA standard adopting the typical<br>
OFDMA, IEEE 802.1.6-2004 and the amended standard IEEE 802.16e-<br>
2005 (hereinafter referred to as IEEE 802.16e) have been<br>
completed.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a logical frame structure of the IEEE<br>
802.16e system. As shown in FIG. 1, the logical frame<br>
structure of the IEEE 802.16e system consists of a preamble<br>
(101), an FCH (frame control header) (102), control signal<br>
blocks of DL/UL-MAP (103, 104), and data bursts. Also, the<br>
data transmission of each user is defined by different<br>
subcarrier allocation methods (e.g., PUSC, (O)-FUSC, TUSC, AMC,<br>
etc.) depending upon the method of configuring the subcarrier.<br>
Herein, various permutation zones may be configured in one<br>
frame.<br>
In the frame of the IEEE 802.16e system, as shown in FIG.<br>
1, the reception of an initial preamble (101), an FCH (102),<br>
and control information on the DL/UL-MAP (103, 104) is<br>
required. And, the role of each field is as follows:<br>
Preamble (101) : performing synchronization, channel<br>
estimation, cell ID acquisition, etc.<br>
FCH (102) : providing channel allocation information and<br>
channel code information associated with the DL-MAP (103)<br>
- DL/UL-MAP (103, 104) : providing channel allocation<br>
information of a data burst in an downlink (DL)/uplink<br><br><br>
(UL)<br>
Among the above-described control fields, with the<br>
exception of the preamble (101), the logical frame structure<br>
may be diversely configured (or established) in accordance<br>
with a subchannel allocation method (PUSC, (O)-FUSC, TUSC, AMC,<br>
etc.) selected by taking into consideration factors such as<br>
frequency diversity gain, scheduling gain, convenience in<br>
adopting a pilot overhead or multi/adaptive antenna.<br>
Meanwhile, discussions of an enhanced version (or<br>
system) of the above-described IEEE 802.16e system is in<br>
progress, and such system will be regulated as the IEEE<br>
802.16m standard. Accordingly, reference may be made to "IEEE<br>
802.16m-07/002r4 - TGM System Requirements Document"<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "SRD") for the requirements that<br>
the IEEE 802.16m system should satisfy.<br>
Referring to the above-described SRD of the IEEE 802.16m<br>
system, it is mentioned that co-existence with the TD-SCMA,<br>
3GPP LTE TDD should be supported in the IEEE 802.16m TDD mode.<br>
However, in case of the IEEE 802.16m system, an accurate frame<br>
structure has not yet been decided, and, accordingly,<br>
discussions on the uplink/downlink ratio and time domain<br>
structure of a frame within the IEEE 802.16m system for the<br>
co-existence with the heterogeneous TDD system is required to<br>
be made.<br>
[Detailed description of the invention]<br><br><br>
[Technical objects]<br>
In order to resolve the above-described problems, the<br>
present invention proposes a method of determining a downlink<br>
(DL)/uplink (CJL) ratio and a method of establishing a time<br>
domain structure of other frames so as to prevent collision<br>
with a heterogeneous time division duplex (TDD) network when<br>
designing the frame structure from occurring, in the aspect of<br>
a specific system design.<br>
[Technical solutions]<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and<br>
broadly described herein, according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, in a situation of coexisting heterogeneous<br>
systems including a first system and a second system, in a<br>
method of establishing a time domain structure of a second<br>
frame used for a Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode of the second<br>
system, so that the second frame can coexist with a first<br>
frame for a TDD mode of the first system, the method of<br>
establishing a time domain structure of a frame includes an<br>
information acquiring step for acquiring type information of<br>
the first system being supported and information on a first<br>
ratio, wherein the first ratio corresponds to a ratio between<br>
an uplink section and a downlink section in the first frame<br>
structure; a second frame structure establishing step for<br>
establishing a second frame structure for the second system<br><br><br>
based upon the acquired information; and a ratio determining<br>
step for determining a second ratio, wherein the second ratio<br>
corresponds to a ratio between an uplink section and a<br>
downlink section in the second frame structure.<br>
At this point, the determining step may further include<br>
a set-up step of excluding a predetermined number of OFDM<br>
symbols from transmission so that a sum of the downlink<br>
section and a transmit transition gap (TTG) of the second<br>
frame can be equal to or greater than a sum of the downlink<br>
section and a downlink pilot time slot (DwPTS) of the first<br>
frame.<br>
Also, the determining step may further include a step of<br>
establishing a frame offset from a starting point of the first<br>
frame of the second frame.<br>
In a more specific embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the first system may correspond to an LCR-TDD (low^-chip-rate<br>
time division duplex) system, and the second system may<br>
correspond to an IEEE 802.16m system, and a cyclic prefix (CP)<br>
length of the second frame may be equal to 1/8 valid OFDM<br>
symbol time (Tu) . And, in this case, the second ratio may be<br>
set to 7:1 when the first ratio is set to 6:1. The second<br>
ratio may also be set to 6:2 when the first ratio is set to<br>
5:2. The second ratio may also be set to 5:3 when the first<br>
ratio is set to 4:3. Herein, x:y corresponds to (a downlink<br>
section length):(an uplink section length). And, this is<br><br><br>
identically applied to the following cases.<br>
Also, in the same situation, among the second frame<br>
structure, 1 OFDM symbol may be excluded from the transmission<br>
when the first ratio is 6:1, and 2 OFDM symbols may be<br>
excluded from the transmission when the first ratio is 5:2,<br>
and 3 OFDM symbols may be excluded from the transmission when<br>
the first ratio is 4:3.<br>
In another more specific embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the first system may correspond to a 3GPP LTE TDD<br>
system, and the second system may correspond to an IEEE<br>
802.16m system, and a cyclic prefix (CP) length of the second<br>
frame may be equal to 1/8 valid OFDM symbol time (Tu) . And,<br>
in this case, the information acquiring step may include a<br>

first frame and configuration index information of the first<br>
frame in the 3GPP LTE TDD system.<br>
In this embodiment, when it is assumed that the CP<br>

may be set-up to be delayed for a predetermined time starting<br>
from the starting point of the first frame within a receive<br>

[Best mode for carrying out.the invention]<br>
Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be described in detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. The purpose of the following<br>
disclosure of the detailed description of the .' present<br>
invention with reference to the accompanying drawings is to<br>
provide exemplary descriptions of the embodiments of the<br>
present invention, and not .to provide the sole and unique<br>
embodiments that can be carried out according to the present<br>
invention. The following detailed description of the present<br><br><br>
invention includes detailed specifications in order to provide<br>
a full understanding of the present invention. However, it is<br>
apparent to anyone skilled in the art that the present<br>
invention may be carried out without such detailed<br>
specifications.<br>
Meanwhile, in some cases, in order to avoid any<br>
ambiguity in the concept of the present invention, the<br>
disclosure of some structures and devices may be omitted, or<br>
such structures and devices may be illustrated in the form of<br>
a single block based upon the essential functions of each<br>
structure and device. Furthermore, the same reference<br>
numerals will be used for the same elements of the present<br>
invention throughout the description of the present invention.<br>
The following description of the present invention will<br>
mainly focus on the method of determining a downlink<br>
(DL)/uplink (UL) ratio and the method of establishing a time<br>
domain structure of other frames, so as to prevent collision<br>
with a heterogeneous time division duplex (TDD) network, e.g.,<br>
TD-SCMA system or 3GPP LTE TDD system from occurring, when<br>
designing the frame structure, in the aspect of a specific<br>
system design. However, the basic principle for supporting<br>
the TDD system without any collision with a heterogeneous TDD<br>
system may also be applied in other systems by using the same<br>
method.<br>
In order to maintain the DL/UL switch-point according to<br><br><br>
the DL/UL ratio of the heterogeneous system supporting the TDD<br>
mode, it is preferable that the DL/UL alignment according to<br>
the DL/UL ratio of a newly designed system matches with (or is<br>
identical to) the aligned state (or alignment) of the<br>
conventional heterogeneous system. If the time domain<br>
alignment with the conventional heterogeneous system is not<br>
identical (or does not match) , an interference may occur<br>
between the systems, thereby causing a deterioration in the<br>
performance of the systems. In order to avoid such problems,<br>
an idle OFDM symbol sections that does not transmit any OFDM<br>
symbols may be assigned. Also, an excessive number of such<br>
idle OFDM symbols may cause damage in the overall performance<br>
of the system.<br>
In order to minimize such disadvantages, an adequate<br>
Dl/UL ratio is required to be set-up (or determined) in a<br>
newly designed system according to the DL/UL ratio in the<br>
conventional heterogeneous TDD system.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart introducing a method of<br>
establishing a DL/UL ratio of a new system and a method of<br>
establishing the time domain of other frames according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, in a coexisting situation with the<br>
conventional heterogeneous TDD system, when establishing a<br>
frame structure for the TDD mode of the new system, type<br>
information of the conventional heterogeneous TDD system and<br><br><br>
information of the DL/UL ratio within the frame of the<br>
conventional TDD system are required to be acquired (S201) .<br>
The conventional TDD system that is to coexist with the newly<br>
designed system is pre-decided when installing the newly<br>
designed system, so as to be stored in advance in each subject<br>
(e.g., base station, mobile station, etc.) of the new system.<br>
However, depending upon the situation, since each subject may<br>
be set-up in different environments, it is preferable to<br>
determine such information as upper-layer (or higher-layer)<br>
information that can be acquired based upon a specific cycle<br>
period or when a change occurs.<br>
For example, the base station or user equipment<br>
supporting the IEEE 802.16mmay acquire information on whether<br>
the conventional heterogeneous TDD system corresponds to an<br>
LCR-TDD (low-chip-rate time division duplex) system respective<br>
to a: TD-SCDMA system or whether the conventional heterogeneous<br>
TDD system corresponds to a 3GPP LTE TDD system. Also,<br>
information on what the DL/UL ratio is in the frame structure<br>
according to each system may also be acquired. Furthermore,<br>
as described below, in case of the 3GPP LTE TDD system, since<br>
different TDD frames are used in accordance with the type of<br>
cyclic prefix (hereinafter referred to as "CP") within each<br>
frame and the frame structure index, the respective<br>
information should be acquired so that the time domain frame<br>
structure of the new system (IEEE 802.16m) can be established<br><br><br>
without any collision with the conventional system.<br>
After acquiring such information on the conventional<br>
system, the DL/UL ratio of the new frame and the time domain<br>
alignment of other frames may be set-up (or determined) in<br>
accordance with such acquired information (S202). According<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention, apart from the set-<br>
up of the DL/UL ratio of each frame, a frame offset is<br>
proposed as the time domain alignment that is to be<br>
established. More specifically, in some particular cases, the<br>
frame of the new system may be established so that specific<br>
information can be delayed in comparison with the conventional<br>
system without any collision with the conventional the<br>
conventional heterogeneous TDD system.<br>
More particularly, in order ' to provide support without<br>
causing any collision between the conventional heterogeneous<br>
TDD system and the new system, the sum (or added value) of the<br>
downlink section of the new system frame and the transmit<br>
transition gap (TTG) is required to be set-up so" as to be<br>
greater than or equal to the sum (or added value) of downlink<br>
section of the conventional TDD system frame and a downlink<br>
pilot time slot (DwPTS). If a first location corresponding to<br>
the sum (or added value) of the downlink section of the new<br>
system frame and the transmit transition gap (TTG) is later<br>
than (or comes after) a second location corresponding to the<br>
sum (or added value) of downlink section of. the conventional<br><br><br>
TDD system frame and a downlink pilot time slot (DwPTS), the<br>
OFDM symbols corresponding to the first location to the second<br>
location cannot be used for transmission in the new system<br>
frame. Under such assumption, in the above-described<br>
embodiment of the present invention, by delaying the new<br>
system frame by a predetermined interval in comparison with<br>
the starting point of the conventional TDD system, the first<br>
location may be set to be positioned at the same location as<br>
the second location or at a location after the second position.<br>
And, in this case, the last portion of the frame in the tome<br>
domain may use the receive transition gap (RTG). More<br>
specific details will be described in the following detailed<br>
description of the exemplary embodiment of each system.<br>
Meanwhile, as described above, for the coexistence with<br>
the conventional heterogeneous TDD system, consideration is<br>
required to be made as to how the frame structure of the IEEE<br>
802.16m system will be established. More specifically, in<br>
case of the IEEE 802.16m, it is very likely to support CP<br>
lengths having diverse sizes. Since there in a difference in<br>
OFDM symbols that can be used in accordance with the CP length,<br>
this may influence the DL/UL ratio according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Therefore, hereinafter, the CP length of the IEEE<br>
802.16m system will now be described in detail.<br>
First of all, the basic OFDM value regulation in the<br><br><br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e system is as follows.<br><br>
Table 1 shows the basic OFDM value regulation on the<br>
transmission bandwidth, sampling frequency, FFT size, and sub-<br>
carrier spacing, and so on, in the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
system. Table 1 also shows the available CP lengths and the<br>
respective number of OFDM symbols per frame and idle time.<br>
Herein, "Tu" indicates the valid OFDM symbol length, and this<br><br>
may be defined as 1/(sub-carrier spacing).<br>
Among the CP lengths 1/4 Tu, 1/8 Tu, 1/16 Tu, and 1/32<br>
Tu regulated in the conventional IEEE 802.16e, as shown in<br>
Table 1, the CP length required to be supported in the legacy-<br>
mode of the new system corresponds to the CP length 1/8 Tu,<br>
and this is marked in bold font in Table 1 (see IEEE 802.16m-<br>
07/02r4 - TGm System Requirements Document (SRD)). Also, in<br>
the following description of the present invention, the<br>
"legacy support mode" or "legacy mode" indicates the mode<br>
supporting the communications method regulated as a<br>
fundamental standard in the IEEE 802.16e system required in<br>
the SRD.<br>
As described above, when using the 1/8 Tu CP length, as<br>
shown in Table 1, 48 OFDM symbols and an idle time of 64.64 us<br>
are included in a 5 msec frame. Therefore, in case of a new<br>
frame structure coexisting with the new mode, and, more<br>
particularly, in case of a frame structure supporting the<br>
legacy mode, a new frame structure is required to be proposed<br>
under the conditions of the basic values.<br>
Accordingly, in the following description, it will be<br>
assumed that the CP length of the IEEE 802.16m system<br>
corresponds to 1/8 Tu.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a frame structure having a CP length<br>
of 1/8 Tu, which is proposed for a legacy support mode of the<br>
IEEE 802.16m according to an embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, in the frame structure for the<br>
legacy support mode of the IEEE 802.16m, a basic sub-frame<br>
consists of 6 OFDM symbols, and one frame is configured of 48<br>
OFDM symbols and an idle time of 64.64 us. In this structure,<br>
by configuring the TTG and RTG by using one OFDM symbol and<br>
the idle time of the DL region, the TDD mode may be supported.<br>
Hereinafter, it is assumed that the new system<br>
corresponds to the IEEE 802.16m system based upon the above-<br>
described structure, and an example of establishing a frame<br>
enabling the LCR-TDD system and the 3GPP LTE TDD system to be<br>
supported without any collision will also be described.<br>
Coexistence with the LCR-TDD system<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a frame structure, according to an<br>
exemplary DL/UL ratio of an LCR-TDD system.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, one. radio (or wireless) frame in the<br>
LCR-TDD system consists of 7 traffic slots (TSO ~ TS6), and<br>
the length of each traffic slot is 0.675 ms. The DwPTS, GP,<br>
and UpPTS are sequentially configured between TSO and TSl, and<br>
these are used for the UL and. DL synchronization and the guard<br>
period. The DwPTS, the GP, and the OpPTS have the length of<br>
75 us, 75 us, and 125 us, respectively.<br>
The available DL/UL ratios using 7 symbols within the<br>
frame according to the LCR-TDD system are 6:1, 5:2, and 4:3.<br><br>
The concept of each DL/UL ratio is as shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5<br>
illustrates a drawing describing the DL/UL ratio available in<br>
the LCR-TDD system. And, the portion marked in dark shading<br>
specifies the DL/UL ratio by indicating a DL and UL pair.<br>
When considering the coexistence of the above-described<br>
LCR-TDD system and the IEEE 802.16m TDD system, it is<br>
preferable that, in the IEEE 802.16m TDD mode, the DL/UL ratio<br>
of the IEEE 802.16m is decided based upon the DL/UL ratio of<br>
the LCR-TDD. At least one or more IEEE 802.16m DL/UL ratio<br>
may be determined with respect to one DL/UL ratio of the LCR-<br>
TDD. If non-conformity in the time alignment occurs between<br>
the two systems, a specific OFDM symbol may not be used in the<br>
transmission. According to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in order to minimize the number of OFDM symbols<br>
that cannot be used in the transmission, a method of<br>
determining (or setting-up) the DL/UL ratio of the IEEE<br>
802.16m frame based upon each of the DL/UL ratios of the<br>
conventional LCR-TDD system may be proposed as shown below.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 2, it is assumed that each of the DwPTS, the GP,<br>
and the UpPTS respectively corresponds to 75 us, 75 us, and<br>
125 us.<br>
As shown in Table 2, when the DL/UL ratio of the LCR-TDD<br>
system is 6:1, and when considering the situation wherein the<br>
DL(us) or the DL+TTG(us) of the IEEE 802.16m TDD should be<br>
equal to or greater than the DL+DwPTS (us) of the LCR-TDD,<br>
when the ratio of the IEEE 802.16m is 7:1, the configuration<br>
may be made without transmitting a maximum of only 1 OFDM<br>
symbol. In all of the cases shown below, the basic condition<br>
that the DL(us) or the DL+TTG(us) of the 16m TDD is "equal to<br>
or greater than the DL+DwPTS (us) of another TDD system. When<br>
considering another ratio of the 16m, a situation where at<br>
least one or more OFDM symbols are not transmitted may occur.<br>
Therefore, when the ratio of the LCR-TDD is 6:1, 7:1 becomes<br><br>
the optimal ratio of the 16m. Based upon the same principle,<br>
with respect to the other ratios of the LCR-TDD, when<br>
considerations are made outside of the range of ratios<br>
mentioned in Table 2, a larger number of OFDM symbols may not<br>
be used.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a positional relation between a case<br>
wherein the DL/UL ratio of the LCR-TDD system shown in FIG. 5<br>
corresponds to 4:3 and the IEEE 802.16m system having the<br>
structure shown in Table 2 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, when the DL/UL ratio of the LCR-TDD<br>
is 4:3, the positional relation of the 16m may be indicated in<br>
accordance with Table 2. Also, in case of other DL/UL ratios<br>
of the LCR-TDD, such as 5:2 and 6:1, the respective positional<br>
relation may be indicated by using the same method shown in<br>
FIG. 6. Herein, each ratio may have the respective relation<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
Coexistence with the 3GPP LTE TDD system<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a frame structure (Type 2 frame<br>
structure) supporting the TDD mode in a 3GPP LTE system.<br>
The frame structure shown in FIG. 7 corresponds to a<br>
case where the frame structure has a 5 ms switch-point cycle<br>
period, and reference may be made to 3GPP TS 36.211 for the<br><br>
corresponding details.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, in the 3GPP LTE system, a radio (or<br>
wireless) frame has the length of 10 ms. One radio frame is<br>
configured of 2 half-frames. Herein, one half-frame is equal<br>
to 5ms, and each half-frame is configured of 5 sub-frames each<br>
having the length of 1 ms. One sub-frame includes one switch-<br>
point. This corresponds to when the cycle period of the<br>
switch-point is 5 ms. Herein, the cycle period of the. switch-<br>
point may also be equal to 10 is.	~<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the. case<br>
where the cycle period of the switch-point is 5 ms is first<br>
considered. As shown in Table 3 below, the frame<br>
configuration of the 3GPP LTE TDD mode may respectively have 9<br>
different configurations or 7 different configurations in two<br>
different modes, wherein one corresponds to using a normal CP<br>
and the other corresponds to using an extended CP.<br><br><br><br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, a method of<br>
establishing DL/UL ratios of the frame for the IEEE 802.16m<br>
TDD system and establishing the time domain structure of a<br>
frame based upon the 3GPP LTE TDD frame structure shown in FIG.<br>
7 and each configuration index of Table 3 is provided.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
details shown in Table 3 with respect to the 3GPP LTE TDD<br>
system propose the regulations for establishing the DL/UL<br>
ratios of the IEEE 802.16m and the time domain of a frame in<br>
Table 4a, Table 4B, and Table 5 shown below with respect to<br>
the case of using a normal CP and an extended CP.<br>
First of all, the case of using a normal CP in the 3GPP<br>
LTE system will now be described.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 4a and Table 4b respectively show the method of<br>
determining the DL/UL ratio of the IEEE 802.16m frame<br>
according to each configuration index, when the 3GPP LTE TDD<br>
system uses the general CP. As shown in Table 4a and Table 4b,<br>
2 or more DL/UL ratios may be available under the same<br>
condition. Along with the Dl/UL ratio of the 16m frame, Table<br>
4a and Table 4b show the number of OFDM symbols that cannot be<br>
used due to the non-conformity of the two systems.<br>
When the DL/UL ratio of the 3GPP LTE TDD is 1:3, the 16m<br>
does not have a separate frame offset. And, the<br>
configurations 0 and 5 of Table 4 may configure 2 different<br>
ratios 2:6 and 3:5, with respect to the DL/UL ratio 1:3 of the<br>
LTE TDD system, without any separate symbol puncturing (i.e.,<br>
the act of not transmitting specific symbols from a sub-frame<br>
of a 6 OFDM symbol unit) . In the remaining cases,, only one<br>
ratio 3:5 is optimal for the DL/UL ratio 1:3 of the LTE TDD<br>
system. With the exception of this ratio, when other ratios<br>
are being considered, the occurrence of the above-described<br>
symbol puncturing should be taken into consideration.<br>
When the DL/UL ratio of the LTE TDD system is 2:2, the<br>
frame offset of the 16m becomes the sub-frame unit 4000 us,<br><br>
and only one ratio may be available for all configurations of<br>
Table 4. In this case, as described above, the number of<br>
symbols processed with puncturing starts from one to a maximum<br>
number of two symbols.<br>
When the DL/UL ratio of the LTE TDD system is 3:1, the<br>
frame offset of the 16m becomes the sub-frame unit 3000 us,<br>
and only one ratio may be available for all configurations of<br>
Table 4 with the exception of configuration 7. In this case,<br>
the number of puncturing symbols ranges from a minimum of 3<br>
symbols and a maximum of 4 symbols. Herein, since the case of<br>
configuration 7 corresponds to a particular case, the<br>
description of the same will be given in the following<br>
description.<br>
FIG. 8 to FIG. 13 illustrate the relation with an IEEE<br>
802.16m frame, when the LTE TDD DL/UL ratio of Table 4<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
corresponds to 1:3, and when configuration 0 to configuration<br>
5 are used.<br>
The maximum portion that can be occupied by the DL<br>
portion of the 16m frame is up to the length of DL 1 symbol +<br>
DwPTS + GP of the LTE TDD. When the 16m frame exceeds this<br>
region, a particular situation of having to perform puncturing<br>
on the corresponding symbol occurs. However, when<br>
configuration is made as shown in Table 4 according to the<br><br><br>
embodiment of the present invention, the situation wherein the<br>
symbol puncturing is to be performed may not be occurred when<br>
the LTE TDD DL/UL ratio corresponds to 1:3.<br>
FIG. 8 to FIG. 13 all correspond to cases where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the LTE TDD frame is 1:3. Most particularly,<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of the<br>
16m TDD frame is set to 2:6 and 3:5 with respect to LTE TDD<br>
configuration 0. FIG. 9 illustrates a situation where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 3:5 with respect to<br>
LTE TDD configuration 1. FIG. 10 illustrates a situation<br>
where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 3:5 with<br>
respect to LTE TDD configuration 2. FIG. 11 illustrates a<br>
situation where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to<br>
3:5 with respect to LTE TDD configuration 3. Also, FIG. 12<br>
illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD<br>
frame is set to 3:5 with respect to LTE TDD configuration 4.<br>
And, finally, FIG. 13 illustrates a situation where the DL/UL<br>
ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 3:5 with respect to LTE<br>
TDD configuration 5. Furthermore, the LTE TDD configurations<br>
6 to 8 that have not been illustrated may also be illustrated<br>
as shown in FIG. 8 to FIG. 13 in accordance with Table 4.<br>
FIG. 14 to FIG. 17 illustrate the relation with an IEEE<br>
802.16m frame, when the LTE TDD DL/UL ratio of Table 4<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
corresponds to 2:2.<br><br><br>
The same principles as those of FIG. 8 to FIG. 13 are<br>
applied in FIG. 14 to FIG. 17. More specifically, the maximum<br>
portion that can be occupied by the DL portion of the 16m<br>
frame is up to the length of DL 1 symbol + DwPTS + GP of the<br>
LTE TDD, and when the 16m frame exceeds this region, a<br>
particular situation of having to perform puncturing on the<br>
corresponding symbol occurs. According to the embodiment of<br>
the present invention, when the LTE TDD DL/UL ratio is 2:2,<br>
optimization may be performed at a level of puncturing 1~2<br>
OFDM symbols. The frame offset for all LTE TDD configurations<br>
(configuration 0 to configuration 8) is equally set to 4000 us.<br>
FIG. 14 to FIG. 17 all correspond to cases where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the LTE TDD frame is 2:2. Most particularly,<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of the<br>
16m TDD frame is set to 4:4 with respect to LTE TDD<br>
configuration 0. FIG. 15 illustrates a situation where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 5:3 with respect to<br>
LTE TDD configuration 1. FIG. 16 illustrates a situation<br>
where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 4:4 with<br>
respect to LTE TDD configuration 5. FIG. 17 illustrates a<br>
situation where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to<br>
5:3 with respect to LTE TDD configuration 6.<br>
Furthermore, the situations that have not been<br>
illustrated may also be illustrated as shown in FIG. 14 to FIG.<br>
17 in accordance with Table 4. More specifically,<br><br><br>
configurations 2, 3, and 4 are all identical to configuration<br>
1 of FIG. 14. Also, configurations 7 and 8 may be applied<br>
identically as the situation of configuration 6.<br>
FIG. 18 to FIG. 26 illustrate the relation with an IEEE<br>
802.16m frame, when the LTE TDD DL/UL ratio of Table 4<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
corresponds to 3:1, and when configuration 0 to configuration<br>
8 are used.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the number of OFDM symbols that ate punctured when the LTE TDD<br>
DL/UL ratio is 3:1 may be set to be equal to or less that 3-4<br>
OFDM symbols. Furthermore, the frame offset for all cases (or<br>
situations) is equally set to 3000 us.<br>
*FIG. 18 to FIG. 26 all correspond to cases where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the LTE TDD frame is 3:1. Most particularly,<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of the<br>
16m TDD frame is set to 6:2 with respect to LTE TDD<br>
configuration 0. FIG. 19 illustrates a situation where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 6:2 with respect to<br>
LTE TDD configuration 1. Also, FIG. 20 illustrates a<br>
situation where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to<br>
6:2 with respect to LTE TDD configuration 2. FIG. 21<br>
illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD<br>
frame is set to 7:1 with respect to LTE TDD configuration 3.<br>
Also, FIG. 22 illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of<br><br><br>
the 16m TDD frame is set to 7:1 with respect to LTE TDD<br>
configuration 4. FIG. 23 illustrates a situation where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 6:2 with respect to<br>
LTE TDD configuration 5.<br>
Additionally, FIG. 24 illustrates a situation where the<br>
DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 6:2 with respect to<br>
LTE TDD configuration 6. FIG. 25 illustrates a situation<br>
where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD frame is set to 7:1 with<br>
respect to LTE TDD configuration 7. And, finally, FIG. 26<br>
illustrates a situation where the DL/UL ratio of the 16m TDD<br>
frame is set to 7:1 with respect to LTE TDD configuration 8.<br>
Meanwhile, Table 5 shown below indicates the<br>
optimization of the 16m frame structure using the same method<br>
as that of Table 4 upon reference to Table 3, when the LTE TDD<br>
system uses the extended CP.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 5, when the LTE TDD DL/UL ratio is 1:3,<br>
the 16m frame may be optimized by eliminating the puncturing<br>
symbols so that the DL/UL ratio can become 3:5. When the LTE<br>
TDD DL/UL ratio is 2:2, puncturing symbols may occur, and the<br>
ratio for minimizing the number of puncturing symbols is<br>
indicated in Table 5. And, the figures marked in bold fonts<br>
in Table 5 indicate the number of symbols. When the LTE TDD<br>
DL/UL ratio is 3:1, with the exception of configuration 6, the<br>
ratio of the 16m may be determined so that there are no<br>
puncturing symbols.<br>
Although the frame offset is not mentioned in Table 5,<br>
the frame offset may have the same value in accordance with<br>
the 3 different DL/UL ratios of the LTE TDD system, as shown<br>
in Table 4.<br>
Hereinafter, as a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a method of determining the 16m frame by delaying<br>
the 16m frame within the RTG range, so as to minimize the<br>
puncturing caused by a non-conformity between the conventional<br>
system and the time domain, will be described in detail.<br><br>
FIG. 27 illustrates a method of establishing an IEEE<br>
802.16m frame by delaying the IEEE 802.16m frame within an RTG<br>
range so as to be aligned with the heterogeneous TDD system<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Most particularly, among the details specified in Table<br>
4, FIG. 27 illustrates the case of configuration 7 when the<br>
LTE TDD DL/UL ratio is 3:1. As described above, in accordance<br>
with Table 4, the LTE TDD system should puncture 4 symbols,<br>
when using configuration 7 with respect to the DL/UL ratio of<br>
3:1, and when using the 16m frame DL/UL ratio of 7:1 (42:6).<br>
However, in the same situation, by using the 16m frame DL/UL<br>
ratio of 6:2 (36:12), and by delaying the 16m frame to a<br>
predetermined degree, as shown in FIG. 27, settings may be<br>
made so that there are no punctured symbols.<br>
In principle, when the LTE TDD system uses configuration<br>
7 so that the DL/UL ratio can become 3:1, even when the 16m<br>
frame DL/UL ratio of 6:2 is used, a collision may occur<br>
between the two frames, as shown in the mid-portion of FIG. 27.<br>
Therefore, according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, as shown in the lower portion of FIG. 27, in order<br>
to prevent collision in the UL Portion of the 16m, the present<br>
invention proposes a method of delaying the 16m frame within<br>
the RTG length range.<br>
At this point, the degree of delay may be acquired<br>
within a range satisfying the following equation.<br><br><br>
As described above, by delaying the 16m frame, a frame<br>
may be designed so that there is no puncturing (or so that the<br>
puncturing can be minimized) in the 16m frame.<br>
As described above, the detailed description of the<br>
disclosed preferred embodiments of the present invention is<br>
provided so that anyone skilled in the art can realize and<br>
carry out the present invention. In the above description,<br>
although the present invention is described with reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that various<br>
modifications and variations can be made in the present<br>
invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
inventions. Therefore, the present invention is not intended<br>
to limit the present invention to the embodiments presented<br>
herein. Instead, it is intended that the present invention<br>
grants a broadest range matching the principles and new<br>
characteristics disclosed herein.<br>
