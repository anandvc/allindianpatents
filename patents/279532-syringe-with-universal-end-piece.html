				<td>Syringe with universal end-piece<br>
The present invention relates to a conventional or pre-filled syringe<br>
having an end-piece suitable for the mounting of needleless connectors, which<br>
are connected for example via a conical assembly, for example by a 6% conical<br>
assembly of the "Liier" type.<br>
In this application, the distal end of a component or of a device<br>
must be understood as meaning the end furthest from the hand of the user and<br>
the proximal end must be understood as meaning the end closest to the hand<br>
of the user.<br>
Various medical devices are known for transferring and/or storing<br>
medical fluids, such as syringes, perfusion and transfusion devices and<br>
connectors. It is essential that these various medical devices can be assembled<br>
together correctly and securely.<br>
Conical assemblies, for example the 6% conical assemblies of the<br>
Luer type, whose specifications are defined by precise standards (see in<br>
particular the ISO 594/1 86 and ISO 594/2 98 standards), make it possible to<br>
ensure compatibility for the mounting of the various types of medical devices.<br>
These specifications apply to the conical assemblies made of rigid or semi-rigid<br>
materials.<br>
A conventional syringe usually comprises a hollow body forming a<br>
reservoir for a medical liquid to be ejected from or tapped into the said syringe,<br>
a seal placed inside the body to delimit the said reservoir at one of its ends, in<br>
particular at its proximal end, and a rod for actuating the seal forming a piston<br>
with a proximal holding portion. In addition, the distal end of the body forming<br>
the reservoir usually comprises an end-piece in which an axial passageway is<br>
arranged through which the said liquid is ejected from the reservoir. The end-<br>
piece may comprise an external distal junction bearing surface for friction<br>
sleeve-fitting, for example of the "Luer" type of frustoconical shape.<br>
The handling of liquids, in particular for a parenteral administration<br>
to a patient which is carried out via a perlusfan device, as often in hospitals or in<br>
emergency situations, implies, in a general manner, the use of connectors and<br>
couplings furnished with conical assemblies, for example 6% Luer conical<br>
assemblies. A connector that is frequently used, and hereinafter called the<br>
Clave® type, is described, for example, in US patent 5,694,686. This connector<br>
comprises in particular an internal sheathed canula, attached to the inside of a<br>
female Luer conical assembly, designed to enter the axial passageway of the end-<br>
piece of a syringe. Such connectors make it possible to seal assemblies of<br>
medical devices and provide protection against the contamination of the<br>
medical liquids that they contain. However, problems have been reported<br>
concerning the use of this type of connector with various syringes that turned<br>
out to be incompatible. The use of adapted intermediate couplings is then often<br>
required, which complicates the intervention of the medical staff, particularly in<br>
emergency situations. In addition, the attempt to install a syringe that is<br>
incompatible with such a connector may make the syringe and/or the connector<br>
unusable because of a breakage of the end-piece of the syringe and/or of the<br>
internal canula of the connector. In such a case, the administration of the<br>
medicine is made impossible or, at best, delayed.<br>
The sheathed internal canula present within the connector as<br>
described in US 5,694,686 requires a minimum diameter of the axial<br>
passageway of the end-piece of the syringe in order to ensure a correct<br>
mounting of the said connector and of the syringe and to allow medical fluids to<br>
travel between the connector and the syringe. Additionally, the external<br>
diameter of the free end of the end-piece of the syringe and its conicity are<br>
imposed by standards (see standards ISO 594/1 86 and ISO 594/2 98) if it is<br>
desired to provide compatibility with other devices with conical assemblies, for<br>
example 6% Luer. Finally, the diameter of the axial passageway is also limited<br>
by the need for the end-piece to have a thickness of the walls forming it that is<br>
sufficient to ensure that the said walls offer an appropriate resistance in order<br>
to withstand, on the one hand, the operations of manufacture of the said end-<br>
piece and, on the other hand, the insertion of the said end-piece into a conical<br>
assembly such as for example a 6% Luer female conical assembly, without<br>
breaking the said walls. This problem of breakage of the walls of the end-piece<br>
is all the more important when the material used to manufacture the syringe<br>
and the end-piece is chosen from breakable materials such as glass.<br>
Furthermore, if a medical liquid is transferred from the syringe to<br>
another device by means of a connector, it is desirable for the volume of<br>
medical liquid remaining in the end-piece after the transfer of the medical liquid,<br>
which constitutes what is called the "dead volume", to be as small as possible<br>
in order, on the one hand, to minimize the wastage of medical liquid and, on the<br>
other hand, for reasons of accuracy of the volume of medical liquid<br>
administered.<br>
The subject of the present invention is a syringe having an end-<br>
piece making it possible to solve the compatibility problems encountered with<br>
the connectors comprising an internal canula. Preferably, the syringe according<br>
to the invention also makes it possible to solve the problems of compatibility<br>
with conical assembly connectors. The syringe of the present invention also<br>
makes it possible, during its connection for example to a perfusion device, to<br>
avoid the use of additional couplings that are not always immediately available,<br>
in particular in emergency situations, which add an additional handling step and<br>
which increase the dead volume of the medical installation.<br>
The syringe of the present invention has an end-piece making it<br>
possible to reduce the dead volume of the axial passageway of the end-piece.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is a syringe defining a reservoir<br>
for containing a liquid and comprising an end-piece having a longitudinal axis<br>
A, the said end-piece encompassing a channel aligned with the said<br>
longitudinal axis A and providing a passageway for the transfer of the said<br>
liquid, characterized in that the said channel comprises at least two portions, a<br>
first portion and a second portion, the said first portion extending from a free<br>
distal end of the end-piece in the direction of the reservoir, and the said second<br>
portion extending between the first portion of the channel and a proximal end of<br>
the end-piece and connecting the said first portion to the reservoir, the said first<br>
portion having an average diameter that is greater than the average diameter of<br>
the said second portion, each of said first and second portions having the<br>
shape of a cylinder.<br>
In the present application, "average diameter" means the diameter<br>
resulting from the average of the various diameters measured by taking several<br>
cross sections over a certain length of a part.<br>
In the present application, "diameter" means a diameter<br>
corresponding to a determined cross section of a part.<br>
Therefore, in the present application, the first portion and the<br>
second portion each have a certain length. For each portion, the diameter is<br>
capable of slightly varying over the length of the said portion, for example<br>
according to the material used, or to the manufacturing method used. For each<br>
portion, the average diameter corresponds to the average of the various<br>
diameters that can be measured over the length of the said portion. Each<br>
portion has the shape of a cylinder : in other words, for each portion, the<br>
average diameter is substantially constant. Such cylindrical portions allow a<br>
better flow of the medical liquid when expelled through the passageway, an<br>
easy manufacturing, a suitable connection with connectors comprising an<br>
internal canula that have the shape of a cylinder and a reduction of the dead<br>
volume. The first portion of the channel of the end-piece of the syringe<br>
according to the invention makes it possible to allow compatibility of the<br>
assembly of the said syringe with a connector while the second portion of the<br>
channel of the end-piece of the syringe confers on the end-piece sufficient<br>
strength to prevent breakage when the said end-piece is inserted into a conical<br>
assembly, for example in a female 6% Luer conical assembly.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the said first portion is suitable<br>
for mounting a needleless connector system, in particular a needleless<br>
connector system of the Clave® type, as described in US 5,694,686.<br>
Also advantageously, a transition zone connects the said first<br>
portion and the said second portion together, the said transition zone having a<br>
length along the longitudinal axis A of the said end-piece greater than 0, the<br>
diameter of the said transition zone varying along the said length within a range<br>
defined by the average diameter of the said first portion and the average<br>
diameter of the said second portion.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the transition zone has a<br>
partially spherical shape. In another embodiment of the invention, the transition<br>
zone has a frustoconical shape. Such partially spherical or frustoconical shapes<br>
have the advantages of optimizing the strength of the end-piece and making it<br>
possible to reduce the dead volume. Furthermore, such shapes also make it<br>
possible to facilitate the manufacturing method, in particular when the end-<br>
piece is made of a breakable material such as glass.<br>
In one embodiment of the syringe according to the invention, the<br>
external shape of the end-piece is compatible with a connector of the Luer type.<br>
In particular, the external shape of the end-piece of the syringe according to the<br>
invention may be conical. For example, the external shape of the end-piece<br>
may have a 6% conicity in order to be compatible with a Luer-type connector<br>
having a 6% conicity. Such an external shape of the end-piece makes it<br>
possible to ensure the compatibility of the syringe according to the present<br>
invention with the other medical devices intended to be assembled via a conical<br>
assembly.<br>
Therefore, preferably, the end-piece of the syringe according to the<br>
invention has a symmetry of revolution relative to its longitudinal axis A. The<br>
external diameter of the proximal end of the end-piece may then<br>
advantageously lie within the range from 4.30 to 4.50 mm. The external<br>
diameter of the distal end of the end-piece may advantageously lie within the<br>
range from 3.90 to 4.10 mm. The average diameter of the second portion of the<br>
channel may lie within the range from 1.00 to 1.30 mm. The average diameter<br>
of the first portion of the channel may lie within the range from 1.60 to 1.90 mm.<br>
The length of the first portion of the channel along the longitudinal axis A of the<br>
end-piece may lie within the range from 5.60 to 7.00 mm. The length of the<br>
transition zone may lie within the range from 0.30 to 2.00 mm. An end-piece of<br>
a syringe according to the invention having at least one of the dimensions,<br>
preferably all of the dimensions, mentioned in this paragraph is particularly<br>
useful and suitable for a safe, rapid, simple and effective assembly, with no risk<br>
of breakage or incompatibility, with a device comprising a Luer-type connector<br>
with conical assembly, such as for example a 6% conicity Luer connector,<br>
and/or a device comprising a needleless-type connector, such as for example a<br>
Clave® connector.<br>
The conservation of certain medical liquids may impose constraints<br>
on the material used for the syringe. For example, for medical liquids requiring<br>
great stability, it is preferable to use glass. A material such as glass makes it<br>
possible to conserve in the syringe particular medical liquids, whose stability<br>
and/or integrity could be compromised if they were conserved in a plastic<br>
syringe. Glass is therefore particularly advantageous in the case of pre-filled<br>
syringes. Glass however has the disadvantage of being fragile and of breaking<br>
easily.<br>
The syringe according to the invention, because of the particular<br>
structure of its end-piece, makes it possible to produce a secure and effective<br>
connection, with no risk of breakage of the said end-piece, with connectors of<br>
the Luer type or with needleless connectors of the Clave® type, even if the<br>
syringe and its end-piece are made in a single piece out of glass.<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, the syringe and the<br>
end-piece are made in a single piece out of glass. For example, the glass may<br>
be borosilicate glass.<br>
Furthermore, a material such as glass also makes it possible to<br>
produce syringes that are stable to severe sterilization treatments, such as for<br>
example steam or ethylene oxide sterilization. The syringe end-piece according<br>
to the invention, in particular when the syringe and the end-piece are made of<br>
glass, may also comprise a circular groove suitable for assembling a Luer Lock<br>
adapter to the said end-piece, the said circular groove being situated on the<br>
outer surface of the end-piece, between the proximal end of the end-piece and<br>
the transition zone of the channel. Then advantageously the syringe may be<br>
furnished with a Luer Lock adapter.<br>
For example, the said circular groove having a length along the<br>
longitudinal axis A of the end-piece defining a proximal edge and a distal edge<br>
of the said circular groove, the distal edge of the circular groove is situated at a<br>
distance of at least 7.50 mm from the free distal end of the end-piece.<br>
Therefore, for example, it is possible to furnish the syringe according to the<br>
invention with a Luer Lock adapter.<br>
In another embodiment, the syringe and its end-piece are made of<br>
polymer, chosen for example from polycarbonate, polypropylene, the cyclo<br>
olefin copolymers (COC) and their blends. Such a polymer material makes for<br>
easier shaping.<br>
The syringe according to the present invention may be pre-filled.<br>
The invention and the advantages that arise therefrom will clearly<br>
emerge from the detailed description that is given below with reference to the<br>
appended drawings in which:<br>
Figures 1a and 1b represent views in partial cross section of<br>
syringes of the prior art and their end-piece, that the user attempts to insert into<br>
a connector comprising an internal canula such as those described in US<br>
patent 5,694,686.<br>
Figure 2 represents a side view of the end-piece of a syringe<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Figure 3 represents a view in section of the end-piece of the<br>
syringe of Figure 2 mounted on a connector as shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1a represents the end-piece 1 of a syringe 2 of the prior art<br>
of which the user has attempted to insert the end-piece 1 into the female<br>
conical assembly 3 of a needleless connector 4, for example of the Clave®<br>
type, having an internal canula 5 sheathed by a retractable seal 6. The end-<br>
piece 1 of the syringe 2 of the prior art comprises an axial passageway in the<br>
form of a duct 7 having the same cross section, relative to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the end-piece 1, over the whole length of this duct 7. The conical shape of<br>
the internal canula 5 and the single diameter of the duct 7 of the end-piece 1<br>
prevent the internal canula 5 from sufficiently entering the said duct 7 in order<br>
to allow the medical liquid, for example contained in the reservoir 8 of the<br>
syringe 2, to travel through the assembly via the apertures 9 arranged in the<br>
internal canula 5. The syringe 2 of the prior art and its end-piece 1 are therefore<br>
incompatible with the connector 4. An assembly consisting of the syringe 2 of<br>
the prior art and a connector 4 is therefore unusable and makes the<br>
administration of the medical liquid impossible.<br>
Figure 1b represents another syringe 2 of the prior art comprising a<br>
duct 7 having an end-piece 1 whose internal diameter does not make it<br>
possible to receive the canula 5 of the connector 4: this canula 5 does not enter<br>
the duct 7 at all: connection between the syringe 2 and the connector 4 is<br>
impossible.<br>
Figure 2 represents a syringe 20 according to the invention<br>
(partially shown in the figure) defining a reservoir 21 (partially shown) for<br>
containing a liquid, for example a medical liquid, comprising an end-piece 10<br>
having a longitudinal axis A. The end-piece 10 encompasses a channel 11<br>
aligned along the longitudinal axis A providing a passageway for the transfer of<br>
the liquid to be ejected from or tapped into the syringe 20 towards the distal<br>
end 14 of the end-piece 10. The channel 11, in the example shown, comprises<br>
two portions, a first portion 12 and a second portion 13. The said first portion 12<br>
extends from the free distal end 14 of the end-piece 10 in the direction of the<br>
reservoir 21 of the syringe 20 according to the invention. This portion 12 is for<br>
example adapted for the mounting of a needleless connector system 4 such as<br>
that shown in Figure 1 for example. The said second portion 13 extends<br>
between the first portion 12 of the channel 11 and the proximal end 15 of the<br>
end-piece 10 while connecting the said first portion 12 with the reservoir 21, the<br>
said first portion 12 having an average diameter D1 that is greater than the<br>
average diameter D2 of the said second portion 13. As appears from Figure 2,<br>
each portion (12, 13) has the shape of a cylinder. In other words, for each<br>
portion, ie the first portion 12 and the second portion 13 respectively, the<br>
average diameter, D1 and D2 respectively, is substantially constant. In<br>
addition, in the example shown, the first and second portions (12, 13) are<br>
connected together via a transition zone 16 having a non-zero length along the<br>
longitudinal axis A of the end-piece 10. As appears in this figure, the diameter<br>
D3 of the transition zone 16 varies along its length within a range defined by<br>
the average diameter of the said first portion 12 and the average diameter of<br>
the said second portion 13. In the example shown in Figure 2, the transition<br>
zone 16 has a frustoconical shape. In another embodiment, not shown, the<br>
transition zone 16 has a partially spherical shape. Such shapes, partially<br>
spherical or frustoconical, have the advantage of reinforcing the strength of the<br>
end-piece 10, in particular at its wall 17, more precisely when the latter is made<br>
of glass. Such shapes also make it possible to reduce the dead volume,<br>
corresponding in the example shown to the volume represented by the first and<br>
second portions (12,13) and the transition zone 16. Furthermore, such shapes<br>
also make it possible to facilitate the manufacturing method, in particular when<br>
the end-piece 10 is made of a breakable material such as glass.<br>
The end-piece 10 shown in Figure 2 preferably has a symmetry of<br>
revolution relative to its longitudinal axis A; in such a case, the end-piece 10<br>
preferably has at least one of the following dimensions:<br>
- a) the external diameter of the proximal end of the end-piece 10<br>
lies within the range from 4.30 to 4.50 mm,<br>
- b) the external diameter of the free distal end 14 of the end-piece<br>
10 lies within the range from 3.90 to 4.10 mm,<br>
- c) the average diameter of the second portion 13 of the channel<br>
11 lies within the range from 1.00 to 1.30 mm,<br>
- d) the average diameter of the first portion 12 of the channel 11<br>
lies within the range from 1.60 to 1.90 mm,<br>
-e) the length of the first portion 12 of the channel 11 along the<br>
longitudinal axis A of the end-piece 10 lies within the range from 5.60 to<br>
7.00 mm,<br>
-f) the transition zone 16 has a length along the longitudinal axis<br>
lying within the range from 0.30 to 2.00 mm,<br>
- g) the external shape of the end-piece has a 6% conicity.<br>
An end-piece of a syringe according to the invention having at least<br>
one of the dimensions, preferably all of the dimensions, specified above is<br>
particularly useful and suitable for a safe, rapid, simple and effective assembly,<br>
with no risk of breakage or incompatibility, with a device comprising a conical<br>
assembly Luer-type connector, such as for example a 6% conicity Luer<br>
connector, and/or a device comprising a needleless-type connector, such as for<br>
example a Clave* connector.<br>
For example, an end-piece of a syringe according to the invention<br>
having the features a) and c) in combination makes it possible to obtain an<br>
excellent strength of the walls of the end-piece, even if the latter are made of<br>
glass, and a reduction of dead volume.<br>
For example, an end-piece of a syringe according to the invention<br>
having the features b), d), e) and g) is particularly compatible with all types of<br>
connectors, for example Luer connectors and Clave® connectors.<br>
In one embodiment, the syringe and the end-piece are made in a<br>
single piece of glass, for example borosilicate glass.<br>
The end-piece of the syringe according to the invention may<br>
comprise, as shown in Figure 2, a circular groove 18 suitable for assembling a<br>
Luer Lock adapter to the said end-piece 10 (see Figure 3), the said circular<br>
groove 18 being situated on the outer surface of the said end-piece 10 between<br>
the proximal end 15 of the end-piece 10 and the transition zone 16 of the<br>
channel 11.<br>
The circular groove 18 is therefore offset, along the longitudinal<br>
axis A of the end-piece, relative to the transition zone 16 in order to prevent<br>
weakening the said wall 17. For example, the said circular groove 18 has a<br>
length along the longitudinal axis A of the end-piece 10 defining a proximal<br>
edge 18a and a distal edge 18b of the said circular groove, and the distal edge<br>
18b of the circular groove 18 is then situated at a distance of at least 7.50 mm<br>
from the free end 14 of the end-piece 10. Such an end-piece 10 is particularly<br>
suitable for connection with a Luer type connector, even if this end-piece 10 is<br>
made of glass.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the end-piece 10 may be<br>
made of polycarbonate.<br>
The end-piece 10 of a syringe according to the invention is<br>
particularly advantageous for solving the problems encountered with syringes<br>
made of breakable materials such as glass, more particularly of borosilicate<br>
glass. Specifically, despite the problems of intrinsic fragility of glass syringes,<br>
the latter often allow a better conservation of the medical fluids and medicines<br>
that they contain. It is therefore desirable to prepare pre-filled glass syringes. In<br>
this case, the syringe according to the invention is particularly suitable for<br>
solving the problems posed by this type of syringe. Finally, glass syringes allow<br>
easier decontamination with the aid for example of sterilizing gas.<br>
Preferably, the external shape of the end-piece 10 is compatible<br>
with connection with a Luer-type connector, for example the end-piece 10 of<br>
the syringe according to the invention complies in particular with the<br>
dimensions imposed by the standards defining Luer 6% conical assemblies.<br>
Figure 3 represents the syringe 20 (shown partially) and its end-<br>
piece 10 of Figure 2, mounted on a connector 4 such as that shown in Figure 1.<br>
The average diameter of the first portion 12 of the channel 11 being greater<br>
than that of the second portion 13, it allows the internal canula 5 of the<br>
connector 4 to correctly enter the channel 11 of the end-piece 10 and therefore<br>
allow the medical liquid to travel through the windows 9 of the internal canula 5<br>
in the intermediate space 19 released between the wall 17 of the end-piece 10<br>
and the internal canula 5, without risking breakage of the end-piece 10.<br>
Specifically, the second portion 13 having a narrower cross section, it makes it<br>
possible to increase the thickness of the walls 17 and therefore to globally<br>
reinforce the end-piece 10. In addition, such a narrower cross section of the<br>
second portion 13 makes it possible to reduce the dead volume of the<br>
assembly corresponding to the volume of the intermediate space 19 added to<br>
the volume of the second portion 13 and of the transition zone 16.<br>
The free end 14 of the end-piece 10 presses on the retractable seal<br>
6. In one embodiment of the invention, the surface of the said free end 14 of<br>
the end-piece 10 is preferably substantially smooth. Such a configuration<br>
makes it possible to ensure a correct seal of the assembly formed by the end-<br>
piece 10 and the connector 4.<br>
Therefore, as shown in Figure 3, the syringe according to the<br>
invention and its end-piece make it possible to produce in a safe, simple and<br>
effective manner assemblies of the said syringe with needleless connectors of<br>
the Clave® type and assemblies of this same syringe with connectors of the<br>
Luer type or Luer Lock type adapters, and to do so even if the syringe and its<br>
end-piece are made in a single piece of a breakable material such as glass.<br>
