				<td>The present invention relates to a nanocomposite magnetic material and a method of making the same, and more particularly relates to magnetic nanocomposite materials including iron, rare earth elements, boron and refractory metals which have favorable magnetic properties and are suitable for making bonded magnets.<br>
Magnetic alloys containing neodymium, iron and boron have been widely studied for use in sintered and bonded magnets due to their favorable magnetic properties. The Nd2Fei4B phase has been identified as a hard magnetic phase exhibiting particularly good magnetic properties.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,402,770, 4,409,043 and Re. 34,322 to Koon, which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose magnetic alloys comprising lanthanum and other rare earth elements, transition metals such as iron and cobalt, and boron within specified ranges. Although the disclosed alloys have been found to possess good magnetic properties, such alloys do not have optimal properties, and have not become commercially viable.<br>
The present invention has been developed in view of the foregoing and to address other deficiencies of the prior art.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a nanocomposite magnetic material of r bankrolled composition\hitch exhibits improved magnetic properties and can be easily-processed;<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a nanocomposite magnetic material comprising Fe, rare earth elements, B, refractory metals and, optionally, Co within specified ranges.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a nanocomposite magnetic material of the formula:   (Nd,.yLay)v Fe,oo.v.w.,-zCo ‘ M’B„ where M is at least one refractory metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W; v is from about 5 to about 15; w is from 0 to about 40; x is from about 9 to about 30; y is from about 0.05 to about 0.5; and z is from about 0.1 to about 5.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a nanocomposite magnetic material including a hard magnetic phase, a soft ma’etic -phase, and a refractory metal boride precipitated phase.  The hard magnetic phase is preferably Nd2Fe,4B, while the soft magnetic phase preferably comprises a-Fe, FejB or a combination thereof.<br>

These and other objects of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The magnetic nanocomposite compositions of the present invention include rare earth elements, iron, boron, refractory metals and, optionally, cobalt. Suitable rare earth elements include La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu.  The total rare earth content of the present compositions is referred to herein as "TRE".  The term "RE" as used herein means all of the suitable rare earth elements except La.  Preferred RE elements are Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb and mixtures thereof, with Nd, Pr and mixtures thereof being most preferred. Suitable refractory metals include elements of Groups IVb, Vb and VIb of the Periodic Table, e.g., Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W.  The refractory metal content of the present compositions is referred to herein as "M".  Typical, preferred and more preferred ranges of TRE, B, M and Co are set forth in Table 1.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, the compositions of the present invention may correspond to the formula:  (REi.yLa,), Feioo-vw-x-rCo’M’B,, where RE is at least one rare earth element excluding La; M is at least one refractory metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W; v is from about 5 to about 15; w is from 0 to about 40; x is from about 9 to about 30; y is from about 0.05 to about 0.5; and z is from about 0.1 to about 5.   Preferably, RE is at least one element selected from Nd, Pr, Dy and Tb; M is at least one refractory metal selected from Ti, V, Nb, Cr and Mo; v is from about 9 to about 12; w is from about 1 to about 20; x Is from about 9 to about 12; y is from about 0.05 to about 0.1; and z is from about 0.5 to about 3.   More preferably, RE is Nd, Pr or a mixture thereof; M is Ti, Nb or Cr; v is from about 9.5 to about 11.5; w is from about 5 to about 15; x is from about 9.5 to about 11; y is from about 0.05 to<br><br>
about 0.1; and z is from about 1 to about 2.5.  In particularly preferred compositions, v is about U.O, w is about 10, x is about 10.5, y is about 0.05 or 0.075, and z is about 2.<br>
Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention may be expressed by the formula:  (Fev,M,Bi.’.j,),.y(R’La,Jy, where M is at least one refractory metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W; R is at least one rare earth element selected from Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, By and Lu; w is from about 0.7 to about 0.9; x is from about 0.001 to about 0.06; y is from about 0.05 to about 0.15; z is from about 0.5 to about 0.95; and up to about 40 atomic percent of the Fe may optionally be replaced by Co. This alternative nomenclature is similar to the nomenclature used in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,770 to Koon.  In accordance with the present invention, the addition of refractory metal within controlled amounts to compositions similar to those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,770 to Koon has been found to substantially improve the properties of the compositions, resulting in a commercially viable magnetic nanocomposite material.<br>
The TRE content of the present compositions is controlled in order to provide desirable properties.  Neodymium is a preferred rare earth element, which is provided in sufficient amounts to form the desired molar fraction of the Nd2Fe,4B hard magnetic phase.  Some or all of the Nd may be substituted by Pr.  The TRE constituent preferably includes a minor amount of La which provides several benefits.  For example, La is a glass former which facilitates the formation of an amorphous precursor alloy by rapid solidification.  Furthermore, La has been found to suppress grain growth during subsequent thermal treatment of the rapidly solidified amorphous alloy.  Lanthanum preferably comprises from about 5 to about 50 atomic percent of the total rare earth content of the compositions.<br>
The B content of the present compositions is controlled in order to form the desired amount of the hard magnetic phase (e.g., NdjFe’B), and to form borides of the refractory metal constiment of the compositions.  As described more fully below, such borides act as a precipitation hardening or grain refining phase which improves the properties of the compositions substantially.   Furthermore, B is a glass former which facilitates formation of an amorphous product during rapid solidification of the compositions.  A sufficient amount of B should be used in order<br><br>
to improve the properties of the nanocomposite material.  Boron levels of greater than or equal to about 9 or 9.5 atomic percent are preferred, with levels of greater than or equal to about 10 or 10.5 atomic percent being particularly preferred.<br>
The refractory metal M content of the present compositions is controlled in order to provide grain refinement of the compositions, while avoiding substantial degradation of magnetic properties.  At least a portion of the refractory metal reacts with boron to form borides, which promote homogenous nucleation of magnetic phase grains.  The refractory borides are located, at least in part, at the grain boundaries of the magnetic phases, and produce grain refinement thereof.   In addition, the refractory metal borides suppress formation of the undesirable Nd2Fe23B3 metastable phase, and promote the formation of the Nd2Fe,4B and a-Fe magnetic phases.  However, at too high a concentration, the refractory metal may react to an undesirable extent with boron to form large particles which are located at the triple junctions between grains of the magnetic phases.  Furthermore, if loo -much of the refractory metal is present it will preferentially react with boron, thereby suppressing the formation of the desirable Nd2Fe,4B hard magnetic phase.<br>
Cobalt may be added to the present compositions in order to increase remanence and maximum energy product magnetic properties.  Cobalt additions may also increase the Curie temperature (T’) of the hard magnetic phase and increase the fluidity of the molten alloy.<br>
The nanocomposite materials of the present invention preferably comprise a hard magnetic phase, a soft magnetic phase, and a refiractory metal boride precipitated phase.  The hard magnetic phase comprises RE2Fe,4B, while the soft magnetic phase may include a-Fe, a-(Fe,Co), FejB, (Fe,Co)3B, FejB and (Fe,Co)2B.  Typically, the hard magnetic phase comprises Nd2Fe,4B and the soft magnetic phase comprises a-Fe, FejB or a combination thereof.  The refractory metal boride precipitated phase may comprise borides such as TiB, Ti3B4, TiB2, NbBz, NbB, NbjBj, CrB. CrBj, Cr3B4. M02B, MoB, M02B5, M0B4, ZrB,, WjB, WB, W2B5, WBj, VB, V3B4, VB2 and combinations thereof.  The average size of the refractory metal precipitates is typically from about 1 to about 30 nanometers. The refractory metal boride precipitate provides nucleation sites and acts as a grain refiner which improves the magnetic properties of the compositions substantially.<br><br>
Phases which degrade magnetic properties to an undesirable extent are preferably minimized or eliminated from the compositions.  For example, the REiFejjBj (e.g., Nd2Fe23B3) metastable phase is preferably reduced or eliminated. Other phases such as Nd-Fe eutectic, Nd’Fe,;, NdjCon and NdFe4B4 may also be reduced or elhninated from the compositions.  In accordance with the present invention, the incorporation of refractory metal and the resultant formation of the refractory metal boride precipitated phase has been found to suppress the formation of the Nd2Fe23B3 metastable phase.   Prior to the present invention, alloy compositions with amounts of boron above about 9 or 10 atomic percent and rare earth amounts of about 7 to about 11.7 atomic percent have not been smdied in depth and reported in the open literamre because of the formation of undesirable phases, such as NdjFCjaBs, and the difficulty of obtaining materials with sufficiently high intrinsic coercivity (H’j) when soft magnetic materials are present.<br>
The nanocomposite materials of the present invention are preferably -in powder form, having preferred average particle sizes of from about 10 to about 200 microns. The powders are preferably magnetically isotropic, and possess favorable magnetic properties such as remanence (B,), intrinsic coercivity (H’i) and/or maximum energy product (BHn’).  The materials preferably have a B’ of greater than about 7.2 kG, K’ of greater than about 6.0 kOe, and BH’’ of greater than about 8.0 MGOe.<br>
While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, the nanocomposite materials of the present invention are believed to exhibit exchange coupling which results from the combination of hard and soft magnetic phases having controlled sizes and desired distribution.  As used herein, the term "exchange coupling" means the electron exchange interaction coupled between the hard and soft magnetic phases.  The average grain size of the soft magnetic phase is preferably less than the domain wall width of the hard magnetic phase (e.g., Nd2Fe,4B).  The average grain size of the soft magnetic phase is preferably from about 2 to about 60 nanometers, while the average grain size of the hard magnetic phase is from about 10 to about 100 nanometers.   More preferably, the soft magnetic phase has an average grain size of from about 2 to about 30 nanometers, while the hard magnetic phase has an average grain size of from about 10 to about 50 nanometers.  For effective exchange coupling to occur the average grain size of<br><br>
the soft magnetic phase should preferably be no larger than the domain wall width of the hard magnetic phase, which has been estimated to be from about 10 to about 30 nanometers for the hard magnetic phase Nd2Fe,4B.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the grain sizes of the soft and hard magnetic phases are controlled by the refractory metal boride precipitated phase, as well as the thermal processing conditions.  The grain refining effect of the refractory metal boride precipitate phase promotes exchange coupling, and substantially improves the magnetic properties and processibility of the nanocomposite materials.<br>
The magnetic materials of the present invention are preferably produced by a rapid solidification and thermal treatment process.  Rapid solidification is achieved by quickly cooling the composition from the molten state by techniques such as melt spinning, jet casting, melt extraction, atomization and splat cooling.  Cooling rates of from about 10* to about lO’"C per second are typically employed, preferably from about 10’ to about lO’"C per second.  The rapidly solidified material is preferably substantially amorphous.  After rapid solidification the material may be ground, may be ground and heat treated, or may be directly heat treated.<br>
The compositions of the present invention have been found to possess improved processibility, allowing slower rapid solidification rates to be used.  For example, during the melt spinning process, slower rotational wheel speeds may be used and/or larger volumes of material may be processed.  The ability to use slower melt spiiming wheel speeds is important because the molten alloy puddle that is in contact with the spinning wheel is substantially more stable when the wheel speed is reduced.  Furthermore, the ability to process larger volumes of material allows for reductions in production costs.<br>
After the composition has been rapidly solidified to the substantially amorphous state, it is preferably thermally treated to induce spontaneous crystallization.  As used herein, the term "spontaneous crystallization" means the rapid and substantially homogenous formation of fine crystal grains.   In accordance with the present invention, the refractory metal boride phase acts as a grain refiner. The boride phase is also believed to provide nucleation sites for the soft and hard<br><br>
magnetic phases. These phases nucleate, but do not exhibit substantial griin growth after they nucleate.<br>
Spontaneous crystallization is preferably achieved by heating the material to a specified temperature for a controlled period of time, which results in nucleation of crystal grains without substantial subsequent grain growth. Temperatures of from about 400 to about 800°C are suitable, preferably from about 650 to about TSO’C.  Heating times of from about 0.001 second to about 2 hours are preferred, more preferably from about 0.01 second to about 10 minutes.  The material may be heated in any suitable apparatus such as a furnace.  Continuous and/or batch heating methods may be employed.  Preferably, the material is heated to its crystallization temperature and the heat source is removed before substantial grain growth occurs.<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope thereof.<br>
Examplg 1<br>
Alloy ingots of Nd,.jFe„.5.,B„ where x = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 10.5, are prepared by vacuum induction melting.  A laboratory jet caster with a Cu-wheel is used for melt spinning.  A wheel speed of 15-30 m/sec is used for preparing samples.  The crystallization temperatures are determined by a Perken-Elmer Differential Thermal Analyzer (DTA-7).  A Siemens x-ray diffractometer is used to determine the degree of amorphousness of the as-spun materials.  Fig. 2 shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of Nd, jFegj j.,B, melt spun at a wheel speed of 18 m/sec., where x = 10.5 (pattern a), x = 9 (pattern b), x = 7 (pattern c), and x = 5 (pattern d).   As can be seen, at x  9.5, these materials are nearly amorphous and a-Fe is diminished. Table 2 lists the optimum magnetic properties after thermal treatment.  In general, H’j decreases with increasing boron content up to about 9 atomic percent, and then increases with boron levels above about 9 atomic percent.   A similar trend can also be observed for B, and BH„‘.  This indicates that there is a change in either the phase formation/distribution or the magnetization mechanism when the boron content is increased above about 9 atomic<br><br>
percent.  These data show that in Nd-Fe-B alloys incremental increases in the boron content above approximately 6 atomic percent lead to a steady decrease in the magnetic properties (e.g., B’ and HJ of the coercive powder and provides a possible explanation why such alloys have not been utilized commercially.<br><br>
Example 2 Alloy ingots of (Nd,.yLay)9 5Fegj.jBj, where y=0, 0.05, 0.10 or 0.15 atomic percent, are prepared by vacuum induction melting.  A laboratory jet caster with a Cu-wheel is used for melt spinning.  A wheel speed of about 15-20 m/sec is used for preparing samples.  The crystallization temperatures are determined by a Perken-Elmer Differential Thermal Analyzer (DTA-7).  Melt spun ribbons are thermal treated in a temperature range of 650 to 670°C for 10 minutes.  The magnetic properties obtained after optimum thermal treatment are listed in Table 3. The crystallization temperamre decreases from 569 to 562 °C when the La content increases from 0 to 0.15 atomic percent.   Considerable increases in both Br and BHnvm are observed in materials with some La substitution for Nd.  These data show that the substimtion of La for Nd in certain alloy compositions shows some improvement, e.g., increases the Br with only minor reduction in H’.<br><br><br>
Alloy ingots of (Ndo.9jLaooi)9 3Fe8, j.jCrjB9 are prepared by vacuum induction melting.  A laboratory jet caster with a Cu-wheel is used for melt spinning.  A wheel speed of 15-18 m/sec is used for preparing the (Ndo,95Lao.o3)9 jFcg, j.jCr3B9 samples.  The crystallization temperatures are determined by a Perken-Elmer Differential Thermal Analyzer (DTA-7).   Melt spun ribbons are thermally processed in the temperamre range of 650 to dVO’C for 10 minutes.  The magnetic properties obtained after optimum thermal treatment are listed in Table 4. The Cr substitution increases the crystallization temperamre from 608 to 635"C when the Cr content increases from 0 to 8.1 atomic percent.  Because of the diluting effect, the Br decreases with increasing Cr content.   A significant increase in Hci is observed when the Cr content is increased from 0 to 2.7 atomic percent. These data show that the H’ of the magnetic powder of certain compositions can be increased by the substimtion of a Cr refractory metal for Fe, with only a minor decrease in the B,.<br><br><br>
Example 4 Alloy ingots of (Ndo.gjLaoo5)vFeg8.,Cr2B,o, where v = 7.5 to 11.5, are prepared by vacuum induction melting.  A laboratory jet caster with Cu-wheel is used for melt spinning.  A wheel speed in the range of 15 to 25 m/sec is used for melt spinning.  The melt spun ribbons obtained are thermally processed in the temperamre range of 675 to 700°C for 10 minutes.  The optimum magnetic properties are listed in Table 5.  These data illustrate the effect of varying amounts of TRE in alloys containing 10 atomic percent B.  The preferred alloys are in the range of from about 9.5 to about 11.5 atomic percent TRE.<br><br>
Example 5 Alloy ingots of (Ndo.95Lao.o5)9,3Fe8g.,,Co«Cr2B,o j. where w = 0 to 10 atomic percent, are prepared by vacuum induction melting.  A laboratory jet caster with Cu-wheel is used for melt spinning.  A wheel speed in range of 15 to 25 m/sec is used for melt spinning.  Melt spun ribbons obtained are thermally processed in the temperature range of 675 to 700""C for 10 minutes.  The optimum magnetic properties are listed in Table 6.  The substitution of Co for Fe causes a dramatic increase in the B’ with only a minor decrease in the H’,, for alloy powders that contain La substimted for Nd and a refractory metal.<br><br><br>
Example 6 Alloy ingots of (Ndo.9jLao.oj)9.3Fe7gM2B,o.3, where M = Cr, Ti, V, Mo or Nb, are prepared by vacuum induction melting.  A comparative composition containing no refractory metal addition corresponding to a composition with the ranges disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,770 to Koon is prepared in an identical manner.  A laboratory jet caster with Cu-wheel is used for melt spinning.  A wheel speed in range of 15 to 25 m/sec is used for melt spinning.  Melt spun ribbons obtained are thermally processed in the temperature range of 650 to 700""C for 10 minutes.  The optimum magnetic properties obtained are listed in Table 7.  These data establish that Cr, Ti, V, Mo and Nb refractory metal additions substantially improve magnetic properties in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br><br>
Example "‘ Compositions of tlie formula (Ndo9jLaoo5)io.5Fe67Co,oM2B,o j are prepared as in the previous example, wherein M = Ti, Nb, Cr, Hf, W and Zr.  A comparative composition containing no refractory metal addition corresponding to a composition with the ranges disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,770 to Koon is prepared in an identical manner.  The magnetic properties of the resultant compositions are listed in Table 8.  Compositions in accordance with the present invention containing Co in combination with refractory metal additions exhibit substantially increased H’i and BH’, properties.<br><br>
Conventional magnetic alloy compositions are listed below in Table 9.  The composition labelled "MQ" is commercially available from Magnequench International under the designation MQP-B, while the composition labelled "SSM" is commercially available from Sumitomo Special Metals Co. under the designation NEOMAX. These commercially available compositions have relatively high levels of rare earth elements and relatively low levels of B in comparison with the preferred compositions of the present Invention.<br><br><br>
Table 10 lists the phases in molar fraction percent of conventional alloy compositions of the formula Nd,3 yFego 7B5 g (MQP-A) and of the formula Nd,2.2Fe77 oCos.oBj g (MQP-B), in comparison with compositions of the present invention having compositions of the formula (Ndo.93Laoo3),,oFe73 3Coj 28,0.5 (Comp. No. 1) and of the formula (Ndo’Laoos)?sFeTjCojBio3 (Comp. No. 2).  The MQP-A and MQP-B compositions are commercially available from Magnequench International.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, bonded magnets with superior performance can be produced from the rapidly solidified and thermally processed coercive nanocomposite powders made from the compositions of the present invention.  The bonded magnets may comprise, for example, from about 0.5 to about 4 weight percent of a binder of any suitable composition such as epoxy, nylon 6-6, polypropylene (PPE) or low melting point metals.  The bonded magnets may be prepared by any suitable method.   For example, the alloy may be ground to a powder having an average particle size of about 200 microns.  The powder is combined and mixed with epoxy in a proporation of about 98 weight percent<br><br>
powder and about 2 weight percent epoxy.  The materials are mixed by hand.  The mixture is then placed into a die (about 10mm) and pressed with a pressure of about 7.5 MT/cm’ for approximately 30 seconds.
