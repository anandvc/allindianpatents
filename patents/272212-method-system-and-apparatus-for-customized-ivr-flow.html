DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
More detailed description of specific embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
given hereafter in conjunction with the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flowchart of a method for enhancing a processing priority according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the embodiment includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
Step 101: Acquiring a predefined processing priority which includes a first priority<br>
and a second priority.<br>
Step 102: Adjusting the first priority to a third priority higher than the first priority,<br>
and/or adjusting the second priority to a fourth priority higher than the second priority<br>
according to relevant information of a subscriber.<br>
The relevant information of the subscriber includes basic information of the<br>
subscriber and operating information of the subscriber. The basic information of the<br>
subscriber includes one or more of: brand of the subscriber, monthly consumption of the<br>
subscriber, consumption ability of the subscriber, age of the subscriber. The operating<br>
information of the subscriber includes one or more of: times of selecting a service<br>
corresponding to a predefined processing priority, durations of selecting a service<br>
corresponding to a predefined processing priority, a percentage of a ratio between the times<br>
and the durations of selecting a service corresponding to a single predefined processing<br>
priority to a ratio between the times and the durations of selecting services corresponding to<br>
all predefined processing priorities.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the processing priorities in the embodiment may be processing priorities<br>
corresponding to IVR system services.<br>
In the embodiment, a predefined processing priority is adjusted according to the<br>
relevant information of the subscriber so as to make the adjusted processing priority be higher<br>
than the predefined processing priority. In this way, it can provide different subscribers with<br>
customized service information providing sequences according to their operation habits,<br>
simplify the procedure for service operation, shorten the time period for service operation,<br>
and realize the customization for service operation.<br>
A method for enhancing a processing priority is provided in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In the embodiment, the service providing system may be an IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform, processing priorities may be prioritized according to<br>
the sequence of nodes in an IVR flow tree, wherein the sequence of a node is determined by<br>
width information and key information in attribution information of the node. Then the first<br>
priority included in the processing priority may be the width information, the second priority<br>
included in the processing priority may be the key information. It should be noted that, in the<br>
embodiment, each IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform includes at least one tree<br>
structure as shown in Fig. 2a. In an IVR system with more than one flow tree, after<br>
subscribers dial into an IVR self-help voice flow, subscribers in different states (e.g.,<br>
registered or deregistered Coloring Ring subscribers) and different brands (e.g., Gotone<br>
subscribers or a M-zone subscribers of China Mobile) may enter different tree structures<br>
when entering the same IVR self-help voice flow. Each tree has a root node. Each non-leaf<br>
node has at least one child node. A tree may have a depth of any layers. The root node is a<br>
virtual node. The parent node of the first menu of the IVR self-help voice flow that a<br>
subscriber enters may be regarded as a virtual root node. The child nodes of each node<br>
compose of directory options or a set of contents under the node.<br>
Fig.2a is a tree diagram of processing priorities employed in the method for enhancing<br>
a processing priority according to the embodiment of the present invention. Fig.2b is a<br>
flowchart of the method for enhancing a processing priority according to the embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown in table 1 and Fig.2a, the service information X1Y1 in table<br>
1 corresponds to the parent node X1Y1 in Fig.2a, the service information X1Y2, X1Y3 and<br>
X1Y4 in table 1 correspond to the child nodes X1Y2, X1Y3 and X1Y4 in Fig.2a respectively.<br>
<br>
<br>
As shown in Fig.2b, the embodiment of the present invention includes the following<br>
steps.<br>
Step 201: Acquiring relevant information of a subscriber.<br>
The relevant information of the subscriber includes basic information of the<br>
subscriber and operating information of the subscriber. The basic information of the<br>
subscriber includes, but is not limited to, one or more of: brand of the subscriber, monthly<br>
consumption of the subscriber, consumption ability of the subscriber, age of the subscriber,<br>
and frequency or the number of times that the subscriber used the IVR flow. The operating<br>
information of the subscriber is an operating trajectory of the subscriber recorded by the IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform, and can be used to generate a customized IVR flow<br>
tree. The operating information of the subscriber includes, but is not limited to, one or more<br>
of: times of selecting a node, durations of staying at the node, or the percentage of the ratio of<br>
the times of selecting the node to the durations of staying at the node to the ratio of the times<br>
of selecting all nodes in the flow tree to the durations of staying at all the nodes.<br>
In the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform, the relevant information of the<br>
subscriber may be acquired by retrieving information, which was recorded by the IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform when the subscriber utilized the IVR subscriber<br>
behavior analyzing platform to inquire or handle a service, and the relevant information of<br>
the subscriber stored in the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform, and may also be<br>
acquired by retrieving the relevant information of the subscriber stored in other external IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platforms. The relevant information of the subscriber acquired<br>
from other external IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platforms is the data produced by<br>
other IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platforms, and may be derived from many ways<br>
such as questionnaire survey on subscribers, experience data of other external IVR subscriber<br>
behavior analyzing platforms and so on. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform<br>
may introduce such data into its own database.<br>
When the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform receives a communication link<br>
request from a subscriber terminal, it may receive an identifier of the subscriber terminal such<br>
as telephone number, IP address and so on. Alternatively, the subscriber may input through<br>
pressing keys its own information, such as card number, account number, identity card<br>
number or password and so on, when the subscriber uses the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
analyzing platform. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may get the relevant<br>
information of the subscriber by matching the identifier of the subscriber terminal or the<br>
information inputted by the subscriber.<br>
Step 202: Deciding whether the subscriber has a customized IVR flow tree.<br>
A standard IVR flow tree is the base for a customized IVR flow tree. The customized<br>
IVR flow tree may be achieved by adjusting the standard IVR flow tree according to the<br>
operating information of the subscriber. The adjustment includes latitudinal adjustment of a<br>
node and longitudinal adjustment of a node. For example, A is a subscriber having no<br>
customized IVR flow tree, and B is a subscriber having a customized IVR flow tree. In the<br>
case of entering an IVR flow tree with latitudinal adjustment of a node being enabled, the<br>
flow entered after the subscriber A dials an IVR access number is a standard voice flow, i.e.<br>
the flow is identical to the flow shown in the flowchart. On the other hand, after the<br>
subscriber B dials the IVR access number, the subscriber is prompted to press x if he wants to<br>
enter the standard flow, and the default option is to enter a customized flow. In the<br>
customized flow, the subscriber is not requested to select a language (the system has recorded<br>
the language of the subscriber), and the main menu is rearranged according to the operating<br>
habit of the subscriber with the habitual option being arranged at the first place. In the case of<br>
entering an IVR flow tree with longitudinal adjustment of a node being enabled, taking the<br>
flow of setting a coloring ring as an example, after the subscriber A downloads a coloring<br>
ring successfully, the system prompts the subscriber to select among "1: setting the coloring<br>
ring; 2: downloading another coloring ring". When the subscriber selects 1, the subscriber is<br>
further prompted to select among "1: default coloring ring; 2: individual coloring ring; 3:<br>
group coloring ring", and the system may enter an actual coloring ring setting flow only after<br>
the further selection is made by the subscriber. It was most probable (the probability is no<br>
lower than a predefined value such as 50%) for the subscriber B to set a downloaded coloring<br>
ring as an individual coloring ring each time he downloaded the coloring ring; therefore,<br>
<br>
when the subscriber B downloads a coloring ring successfully, the system prompt may<br>
become "3: setting as individual coloring ring; 1: setting the coloring ring; 2: downloading<br>
another coloring ring", in this way, one selecting step of the subscriber may be avoided.<br>
Whether a subscriber has a customized IVR flow tree is decided according to the<br>
relevant information of the subscriber. Particularly, items in the basic information of the<br>
subscriber are combined as a deciding condition for performing the decision, for example, the<br>
brand used by the subscriber and the frequency of using the IVR flow by the subscriber as<br>
indicated in the basic information of the subscriber may be combined as the deciding<br>
condition. For example, the subscriber need to be a subscriber of Gotone and the number of<br>
monthly use times of the subscriber need to be larger than 5. Furthermore, assuming that the<br>
period for updating the IVR flow tree is one month and it is December now, and there are<br>
four subscribers A, B, C, D: A, B, C are subscribers of Gotone while D is not; A used the<br>
IVR flow more than 5 times in March and on longer used the IVR flow more than 5 times<br>
monthly in subsequent months; B never used the IVR flow more than 5 times monthly; and C<br>
used the IVR flow more than 5 times in every month. In the above case, there is no record for<br>
B or D in the customized IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform; the customized IVR<br>
flow tree for A is constant from April to December, and is generated according to the use data<br>
of March; C has a respective customized IVR flow tree in each month from April to<br>
December, with the potentially different customized IVR flow tree used in each month being<br>
generated according to the use data of the previous month.<br>
If the basic information of the subscriber conforms to the deciding condition, the<br>
subscriber has a customized IVR flow tree. If one or more items in the basic information of<br>
the subscriber do not conform to the deciding condition, a standard IVR flow tree is presented<br>
to the subscriber. After the decision is made, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform<br>
returns the deciding result to the subscriber terminal.<br>
Further, in order to save system resources, if a subscriber has ever successfully<br>
possessed a customized IVR flow tree once, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform<br>
may no longer perform the decision on whether the subscriber has a customized IVR flow<br>
tree thereafter.<br>
Step 203: Acquiring an IVR flow tree.<br>
According to the deciding result in step 202, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing<br>
platform acquires attribution information of each node in the IVR flow tree of the subscriber,<br>
and the attribution information may include depth information, width information, key<br>
<br>
information, operating information of the subscriber, type information, and identification<br>
information of parent node. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform reads the<br>
attribution information of each node in the IVR flow tree to provide the subscriber with<br>
corresponding IVR flow services.<br>
It should be noted that the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform in the<br>
embodiment performs latitudinal adjustment on a node by adjusting the width information<br>
and/or the key information of the node.<br>
There are various ways for the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform to make a<br>
subscriber enter a customized IVR flow tree. For example, the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
analyzing platform may let the subscriber select an IVR flow tree enter and then provide a<br>
corresponding IVR flow tree to the subscriber according to the subscriber's selection; the<br>
IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may provide a customized IVR flow tree to the<br>
subscriber directly without a selection by the subscriber; alternatively, when the subscriber is<br>
using a standard IVR flow tree or a customized IVR flow tree, the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
analyzing platform may provide a shortcut key for switching between the standard IVR flow<br>
tree and the customized IVR flow tree as required.<br>
Furthermore, when the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform is acquiring the<br>
standard IVR flow tree or the customized IVR flow tree, the subscriber is enabled to switch<br>
between the standard IVR flow tree and the customized IVR flow tree.<br>
Step 204: Recording operating information of the subscriber with respect to a node in<br>
the flow tree.<br>
After the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform acquires an IVR flow tree<br>
corresponding to the subscriber, it provides inquiry and service information to the subscriber<br>
according to the position of each node in the IVR flow tree. When the subscriber uses the<br>
IVR flow tree, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may record the frequency of<br>
using each node by the subscriber; in particular, the frequency of using each node by the<br>
subscriber may be recorded in the subscriber's operating information of the attribution<br>
information of the node. For example, the operating trajectory of the subscriber on each node,<br>
including but not limited to historical keys, times of selecting the node, durations of staying<br>
at the node, is recorded in the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform as the relevant<br>
information of the subscriber.<br>
Step 205: Acquiring an adjusting strategy for a predefined processing priority.<br>
<br>
In particular, when an update period is reached, it is decided whether the brand of the<br>
subscriber, the monthly consumption of the subscriber, the consumption ability of the<br>
subscriber, the age of the subscriber, the frequency or the number of times that the subscriber<br>
utilized the IVR flow and so on in the basic information of the subscriber conform to<br>
predefined values. If the basic information of the subscriber conform to the predefined values,<br>
an adjusting strategy for a single node in the IVR flow tree is acquired to be used to adjust a<br>
first priority and/or a second priority to a third priority and/or a fourth priority respectively<br>
according to the relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
The update period is predefined by a developer. The update period may be a period of<br>
time such as one week, one month, and may also be the number of login times of a subscriber,<br>
for example, the predefined processing priority is adjusted when the subscriber logs in for<br>
every fifth time. The adjusting strategy is predefined by the developer. The adjusting strategy<br>
includes three types: "unadjustable", "adjustable" and "latitudinal adjustment", or<br>
"adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment". Each node corresponds uniquely to a type of<br>
adjusting strategy. For example, in a bank self-help voice system, the two nodes for<br>
requesting a subscriber to input card number and password respectively are "unadjustable"<br>
nodes. The node for deposit service and the node for transfer service may be predefined to be<br>
"adjustable" and "latitudinal adjustment", or predefined to be "adjustable" and "longitudinal<br>
adjustment" by the developer. For example, as shown in Fig.2a, the original arrangement of<br>
the nodes in the same layer is "X1Y1", "X1Y3, "X1Y4". The adjusting strategies of the three<br>
nodes are "adjustable" and "latitudinal adjustment". Therefore, the sequence of the three<br>
nodes may be rearranged in any way according to a subscriber's operating habit. For example,<br>
as shown in Fig.2a, the adjusting strategy of the node "X1Y2" is "adjustable" and<br>
"longitudinal adjustment", and the node "X1Y2" may be adjusted to a position at the same<br>
depth as the node "X1Y1" according to a subscriber's operating habit.<br>
Furthermore, in the adjusting strategy of "adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment",<br>
the depth of a node may be adjusted upwards for at least one position.<br>
Furthermore, if one or more items in the basic information of the subscriber do not<br>
conform to the predefined values, the operation is terminated.<br>
Step 206: Comparing the relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
The developer may predefine a comparing strategy, i.e., an advantage comparing<br>
condition.<br>
<br>
In particular, operating information of a subscriber on a predefined processing priority<br>
is compared with another operating information of the subscriber on another predefined<br>
processing priority according to the predefined comparing strategy. If the operating<br>
information of the subscriber is larger than the another operating information of the<br>
subscriber, Step 207 and Step 208 are performed in turn. The operation information of the<br>
subscriber may be, for example, the durations of staying at a node of the IVR flow tree. For<br>
example, prior to the comparison, the developer may predefine the current comparing<br>
strategy as the durations of staying at a node of the IVR flow tree. If it is required to compare<br>
a node "X1Y3" with another node "X1Y2" in Fig.2a, the lengths of durations of staying at<br>
the two nodes respectively are compared. The comparison indicates that the length of<br>
durations of staying at the node "X1Y3" is longer than the length of durations of staying at<br>
the node "X1Y2", and the processing priority of the node "X1Y3", i.e., the width information<br>
and the key information of the node "X1Y3", is acquired.<br>
Furthermore, if the operating information of the subscriber is less than or equal to the<br>
another operating information of the subscriber, then the operation is terminated.<br>
Furthermore, if the predefined processing priority is required to compare with a<br>
plurality of other predefined processing priorities, then Step 206, Step 207 and Step 208 are<br>
repeated until the operating information of the subscriber is less than or equal to the other<br>
operating information of the subscriber.<br>
Step 207: Acquiring the predefined processing priority which includes a first priority<br>
and a second priority.<br>
In this embodiment, the first priority may be the width information of the node, and<br>
the second priority may be the key information of the node.<br>
Step 208: Adjusting the first priority and/or the second priority to the third priority<br>
higher than the first priority and/or the fourth priority higher than the second priority<br>
respectively according to the relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
In particular, in Step 205, an adjusting strategy for a predefined processing priority is<br>
acquired if it is decided that the basic information of the subscriber conforms to a predefined<br>
value. In Step 206, operating information of a subscriber on a predefined processing priority<br>
is compared with another operating information of the subscriber on another predefined<br>
processing priority, to decide whether to adjust the predefined processing priority. The<br>
relevant information of the subscriber is sufficiently used as a basis of adjustment, to make<br>
<br>
the adjusted service information providing sequence completely conforms to the subscriber's<br>
operating habit.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the type of the node "X1Y4" as shown in Fig.2a is<br>
"adjustable" and "latitudinal adjustment" and the comparing strategy predefined by the<br>
developer is the durations of staying at the node. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing<br>
platform adjusts the width information and/or the key information of the node "X1Y4" when<br>
reaching the update period predefined by the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform.<br>
For example, firstly, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform compares the lengths of<br>
durations of staying at the node "X1Y4" and node "X1Y3" respectively. The length of<br>
durations of staying at the node "X1Y4" is longer than the length of durations of staying at<br>
the node "X1Y3", then the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform adjusts the node<br>
"X1Y4" to be in front of the node "X1Y3". Next, the above procedure is repeated, the IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform compares the lengths of durations of staying at the<br>
node "X1Y4" and node "X1Y2" respectively. The length of durations of staying at the node<br>
"X1Y4" is longer than the length of durations of staying at the node "X1Y2", then the IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform adjusts the node "X1Y4" to be in front of the node<br>
"X1Y2". In this time the arrangement sequence for the three nodes is "X1Y4", "X1Y2",<br>
"X1Y3". In this embodiment, since the type of the node "X1Y4" is "adjustable" and<br>
"latitudinal adjustment", the first priority of the node may be the width information, and the<br>
second priority of the node may be the key information. Therefore the first priority and/or the<br>
second priority may be adjusted as follows:<br>
The width information is put ahead while keeping the key information unchanged;<br>
The key information is put ahead while keeping the width information unchanged;<br>
Both the width information and key information is put ahead.<br>
The sequence of the three nodes may be adjusted to "X1Y4", "X1Y2", "X1Y3" in any<br>
of the three ways.<br>
For example, A is a subscriber having no customized IVR flow and B is a subscriber<br>
having a customized IVR flow.<br>
The flow entered after the subscriber A dials an IVR access number is a standard<br>
voice flow as shown in Fig.2a.<br>
After the subscriber B dials the IVR access number, the subscriber is prompted to<br>
press x if he wants to enter the standard IVR flow, and the default option is to enter the<br>
customized IVR flow of the subscriber. In the customized IVR flow, the subscriber is<br>
<br>
requested to select a language (i.e., the node X1Y1), and then the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
analyzing platform rearranges the nodes according to the subscriber's operating habit,<br>
wherein the node "X1Y4" with the longest length of durations being stayed at by the<br>
subscriber is rearranged at the first place.<br>
In this embodiment, the latitudinal adjustment is performed on the processing priority<br>
of the service information "X1Y2", "X1Y3", "X1Y4" according to the relevant information<br>
of the subscriber, to make the latitudinally adjusted processing priority be ahead of the<br>
original processing priority. In this way, the procedure for service operation is simplified, the<br>
time interval for service operation is shortened, and the customization for service operation is<br>
realized.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment may also include Step 209 in which the adjusted<br>
processing priority is stored.<br>
Fig.3a is a tree diagram of processing priorities used in a method for enhancing a<br>
processing priority according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig.3b is a<br>
flowchart of the method for enhancing a processing priority according to the embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown in table 1 and Fig.3a, the service information X1Y1 in table<br>
1 corresponds to the parent node X1Y1 in Fig.3a, the service information X1Y2, X1Y3 and<br>
X1Y4 in table 1 correspond to the child nodes X1Y2, X1Y3 and X1Y4 in Fig.3a respectively.<br>
This embodiment is similar to the embodiment of the present invention as shown in<br>
Fig.2b, an update period is predefined, and the same operation is performed before reaching<br>
the update period. The difference lies in that: the adjusting strategy is "adjustable" and<br>
"latitudinal adjustment" in the method for enhancing a processing priority according to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, and the adjusting strategy is "adjustable" and<br>
"longitudinal adjustment" in the method for enhancing a processing priority according to this<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment, the first priority included in the processing priority may be<br>
the width information, and the second priority included in the processing priority may be the<br>
depth information.<br>
As shown in Fig.3b, the embodiment of the present invention includes the following<br>
steps.<br>
Step 301: Acquiring relevant information of a subscriber.<br>
The relevant information of the subscriber includes basic information of the<br>
subscriber and operating information of the subscriber. The basic information of the<br>
subscriber includes, but is not limited to, one or more of: brand of the subscriber, monthly<br>
<br>
consumption of the subscriber, consumption ability of the subscriber, age of the subscriber,<br>
and frequency or the number of times that the subscriber utilized the IVR flow. The operating<br>
information of the subscriber is an operating trajectory of the subscriber recorded by the IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform, and can be used to generate a customized IVR flow<br>
tree. The operating information of the subscriber includes, but is not limited to, one or more<br>
of: times of selecting a node, durations of staying at the node, or the percentage of the ratio of<br>
the times of selecting the node to the durations of staying at the node to the ratio of the times<br>
of selecting all nodes in the flow tree to the durations of staying at all the nodes.<br>
In the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform, the relevant information of the<br>
subscriber may be acquired by retrieving information, which was recorded by the IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platform when the subscriber utilized the IVR subscriber<br>
behavior analyzing platform to inquire or handle a service, and the relevant information of<br>
the subscriber stored in the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform, and may also be<br>
acquired by retrieving the relevant information of the subscriber stored in other external IVR<br>
subscriber behavior analyzing platforms. The relevant information of the subscriber acquired<br>
from other external IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platforms is the date produced by<br>
other IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platforms, and may be derived from many ways<br>
such as questionnaire survey on subscribers, experience data of other external IVR subscriber<br>
behavior analyzing platforms and so on. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform<br>
may introduce such data into its own database.<br>
When the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform receives a communication link<br>
request from a subscriber terminal, it may receive an identifier of the subscriber terminal such<br>
as telephone number, IP address and so on. Alternatively, the subscriber may input through<br>
pressing keys its own information, such as card number, account number, identity card<br>
number or password and so on, when the subscriber uses the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
analyzing platform. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may get the relevant<br>
information of the subscriber by matching the identifier of the subscriber terminal or the<br>
information inputted by the subscriber.<br>
Step 302: Deciding whether the subscriber has a customized IVR flow tree.<br>
A standard IVR flow tree is the base for a customized IVR flow tree. The customized<br>
IVR flow tree may be achieved by adjusting the standard IVR flow tree according to the<br>
operating information of the subscriber. The adjustment includes latitudinal adjustment of a<br>
node and longitudinal adjustment of a node. For example, A is a subscriber having no<br>
<br>
customized IVR flow tree, and B is a subscriber having a customized IVR flow tree. In the<br>
case of entering an IVR flow tree with latitudinal adjustment of a node being enabled, the<br>
flow entered after the subscriber A dials an IVR access number is a standard voice flow, i.e.<br>
the flow is identical to the flow shown in the flowchart. On the other hand, after the<br>
subscriber B dials the IVR access number, the subscriber is prompted to press x if he wants to<br>
enter the standard flow, and the default option is to enter a customized flow. In the<br>
customized flow, the subscriber is not requested to select a language (the system has recorded<br>
the language of the subscriber), and the main menu is rearranged according to the operating<br>
habit of the subscriber with the habitual option being arranged at the first place. In the case of<br>
entering an IVR flow tree with longitudinal adjustment of a node being enabled, taking the<br>
flow of setting a coloring ring as an example, after the subscriber A downloads a coloring<br>
ring successfully, the system prompts the subscriber to select among "1: setting the coloring<br>
ring; 2: downloading another coloring ring". When the subscriber selects 1, the subscriber is<br>
further prompted to select among "1: default coloring ring; 2: individual coloring ring; 3:<br>
group coloring ring", and the system may enter an actual coloring ring setting flow only after<br>
the further selection is made by the subscriber. It was most probable (the probability is no<br>
lower than a predefined value such as 50%) for the subscriber B to set a downloaded coloring<br>
ring as an individual coloring ring each time he downloaded the coloring ring; therefore,<br>
when the subscriber B downloads a coloring ring successfully, the system prompt may<br>
become "3: setting as individual coloring ring; 1: setting the coloring ring; 2: downloading<br>
another coloring ring", in this way, one selecting step of the subscriber may be avoided..<br>
Whether a subscriber has a customized IVR flow tree is decided according to the<br>
relevant information of the subscriber. Particularly, items in the basic information of the<br>
subscriber are combined as a deciding condition for performing the decision, for example, the<br>
brand used by the subscriber and the frequency of using the IVR flow by the subscriber as<br>
indicated in the basic information of the subscriber may be combined as the deciding<br>
condition. For example, the subscriber need to be a subscriber of Gotone and the number of<br>
monthly use times of the subscriber need to be larger than 5. Furthermore, assuming that the<br>
period for updating the IVR flow tree is one month and it is December now, and there are<br>
four subscribers A, B, C, D: A, B, C are subscribers of Gotone while D is not; A used the<br>
IVR flow more than 5 times in March and on longer used the IVR flow more than 5 times<br>
monthly in subsequent months; B never used the IVR flow more than 5 times monthly; and C<br>
used the IVR flow more than 5 times in every month. In the above case, there is no record for<br>
<br>
B or D in the customized IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform; the customized IVR<br>
flow tree for A is constant from April to December, and is generated according to the use data<br>
of March; C has a respective customized IVR flow tree in each month from April to<br>
December, with the potentially different customized IVR flow tree used in each month being<br>
generated according to the use data of the previous month.<br>
If the basic information of the subscriber conforms to the deciding condition, the<br>
subscriber has a customized IVR flow tree. If one or more items in the basic information of<br>
the subscriber do not conform to the deciding condition, a standard IVR flow tree is presented<br>
to the subscriber. After the decision is made, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform<br>
returns the deciding result to the subscriber terminal.<br>
Further, in order to save system resources, if a subscriber has ever successfully<br>
possessed a customized IVR flow tree once, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform<br>
may no longer perform the decision on whether the subscriber has a customized IVR flow<br>
tree thereafter.<br>
Step 303: Acquiring an IVR flow tree.<br>
According to the deciding result in step 302, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing<br>
platform acquires attribution information of each node in the IVR flow tree of the subscriber,<br>
and the attribution information may include depth information, width information, key<br>
information, operating information of the subscriber, type information, and identification<br>
information of parent node. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform reads the<br>
attribution information of each node in the IVR flow tree to provide the subscriber with<br>
corresponding IVR flow services.<br>
It should be noted that the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform in the<br>
embodiment performs longitudinal adjustment on a node by adjusting the width information<br>
and/or the depth information of the node.<br>
There are various ways for the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform to make a<br>
subscriber enter a customized IVR flow tree. For example, the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
analyzing platform may let the subscriber select an IVR flow tree enter and then provide a<br>
corresponding IVR flow tree to the subscriber according to the subscriber's selection; the<br>
IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may provide a customized IVR flow tree to the<br>
subscriber directly without a selection by the subscriber; alternatively, when the subscriber is<br>
using a standard IVR flow tree or a customized IVR flow tree, the IVR subscriber behavior<br>
<br>
analyzing platform may provide a shortcut key for switching between the standard IVR flow<br>
tree and the customized IVR flow tree as need.<br>
Furthermore, when the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform is acquiring the<br>
standard IVR flow tree or the customized IVR flow tree, the subscriber is enabled to switch<br>
between the standard IVR flow tree and the customized IVR flow tree.<br>
Step 304: Recording operating information of the subscriber with respect to a node in<br>
the flow tree.<br>
After the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform acquires an IVR flow tree<br>
corresponding to the subscriber, it provides inquiry and service information to the subscriber<br>
according to the position of each node in the IVR flow tree. When the subscriber uses the<br>
IVR flow tree, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may record the frequency of<br>
using each node by the subscriber; in particular, the frequency of using each node by the<br>
subscriber may be recorded in the subscriber's operating information of the attribution<br>
information of the node. For example, the operating trajectory of the subscriber on each node,<br>
including but not limited to historical keys, times of selecting the node, durations of staying<br>
at the node, is recorded in the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform as the relevant<br>
information of the subscriber.<br>
Step 305: Acquiring an adjusting strategy for a predefined processing priority.<br>
In particular, when an update period is reached, it is decided whether the brand of the<br>
subscriber, the monthly consumption of the subscriber, the consumption ability of the<br>
subscriber, the age of the subscriber, the frequency or times that the subscriber utilized the<br>
IVR flow and so on in the basic information of the subscriber conform to predefined values.<br>
If the basic information of the subscriber conform to the predefined values, an adjusting<br>
strategy for a single node in the IVR flow tree is acquired to adjust a first priority and/or a<br>
second priority to a third priority and/or a fourth priority respectively according to the<br>
relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
The update period is predefined by a developer. The update period may be a period of<br>
time such as one week, one month, and may also be the number of login times of a subscriber,<br>
for example, the predefined processing priority is adjusted when the subscriber logs in for<br>
every fifth time. The adjusting strategy is predefined by the developer. The adjusting strategy<br>
includes three types: "unadjustable", "adjustable" and "latitudinal adjustment", or<br>
"adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment". Each node corresponds uniquely to one type of<br>
adjusting strategy. For example, in a bank self-help voice system, the two nodes for<br>
<br>
requesting a subscriber to input card number and password are "unadjustable" nodes. The<br>
node for deposit service and the node for transfer service may be preset to be "adjustable"<br>
and "latitudinal adjustment", or preset to be "adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment" by<br>
the developer. For example, as shown in Fig.3a, the original arrangement of the child nodes is<br>
"X1Y1", "X1Y3, "X1Y4". The adjusting strategies of the three nodes are "adjustable" and<br>
"latitudinal adjustment". Therefore, the sequence of the three nodes may be rearranged in any<br>
way according to a subscriber's operating habit. For example, as shown in Fig.3a, the<br>
adjusting strategy of the node "X1Y2" is "adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment", and the<br>
node "X1Y2" may be adjusted to a position at the same depth as the node "X1Y1" according<br>
to a subscriber's operating habit<br>
Furthermore, in the adjusting strategy of "adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment",<br>
the depth of a node may be adjusted upwards for at least one position.<br>
Furthermore, if one or more items in the basic information of the subscriber do not<br>
conform to the predefined values, the operation is terminated.<br>
Step 306: Comparing the relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
The developer may predefine a comparing strategy, i.e., an advantage comparing<br>
condition.<br>
In particular, operating information of a subscriber on a predefined processing priority<br>
is compared with another operating information of the subscriber on another predefined<br>
processing priority according to the predefined comparing strategy. If the operating<br>
information of the subscriber is larger than the another operating information of the<br>
subscriber, Step 307 and Step 308 are performed in turn. For example, prior to the<br>
comparison, the developer may predefine the current comparing strategy as the durations of<br>
staying at a node of the IVR flow tree. If it is required to compare a node "X1Y2" with<br>
another node "X1Y1" in Fig.3a, the lengths of durations of staying at the two nodes<br>
respectively are compared. The comparison indicates that the length of durations of staying at<br>
the node "X1Y2" is longer than the length of durations of staying at the node "X1Y1", and<br>
the processing priority of the node "X1Y2", i.e., the width information and the depth<br>
information of the node "X1Y2", is acquired.<br>
Furthermore, if the operating information of the subscriber is less than or equal to the<br>
another operating information of the subscriber, then the operation is terminated.<br>
Furthermore, if the predefined processing priority is required to compare with a<br>
plurality of other predefined processing priorities, then Step 306, Step 307 and Step 308 are<br>
<br>
repeated until the operating information of the subscriber is less than or equal to the other<br>
operating information of the subscriber.<br>
Step 307: Acquiring the predefined processing priority which includes a first priority<br>
and a second priority.<br>
In this embodiment, the first priority may be the width information of the node, the<br>
second priority may be the depth information of the node.<br>
Step 308: Adjusting the first priority and/or the second priority to the third priority<br>
higher than the first priority and/or the fourth priority higher than the second priority<br>
respectively according to the relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
In particular, in Step 305, an adjusting strategy for a predefined processing priority is<br>
acquired if it is decided that the basic information of the subscriber conforms to a predefined<br>
value. In Step 206, operating information of the subscriber on a predefined processing<br>
priority is compared with another operating information of the subscriber on another<br>
predefined processing priority, to decide whether to adjust the predefined processing priority.<br>
The relevant information of the subscriber is sufficiently used as a basis of adjustment, to<br>
make the adjusted service information providing sequence completely conforms to the<br>
subscriber's operating habit.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the type of the node "X1Y2" as shown in Fig.3a is<br>
"adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment" and the comparing strategy predefined by the<br>
developer is the durations of staying at the node. The IVR subscriber behavior analyzing<br>
platform adjusts the width information and/or the depth information of the node "X1Y2"<br>
when reaching the update period predefined by the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing<br>
platform. For example, the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform compares the lengths<br>
of durations of staying at the node "X1Y2" and node "X1Y1" respectively. The length of<br>
durations of staying at the node "X1Y2" is longer than the length of durations of staying at<br>
the node "X1Y1", then the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform adjusts the node<br>
"X1Y2" to a position at the same layer as the node "X1Y1". In this embodiment, since the<br>
type of the node "X1Y2" is "adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment", the first priority of<br>
the node may be the width information, and the second priority of the node may be the depth<br>
information. Therefore the first priority and/or the second priority may be adjusted as follows:<br>
The depth information is put ahead while keeping the width information unchanged;<br>
Both the width information and depth information is adjusted.<br>
<br>
The kind of "adjustable" and "longitudinal adjustment" may also include: the<br>
operations performed by the IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may be to add a<br>
new node or to delete the original node after adding the new node.<br>
For example, A is a subscriber having no customized IVR flow and B is a subscriber<br>
having a customized IVR flow.<br>
The flow entered after the subscriber A dials an IVR access number is a standard<br>
voice flow as shown in Fig.3a.<br>
After the subscriber B dials the IVR access number, the subscriber is prompted to<br>
press x if he wants to enter the standard flow, and the default option is to enter the<br>
customized IVR flow of the subscriber. In the customized IVR flow, the IVR subscriber<br>
behavior analyzing platform rearranges the nodes according to the subscriber's operating<br>
habit, wherein the node "X1Y2" at which the subscriber stays for the longest time is<br>
rearranged at the same depth as the node "X1Y1", in this way, one step may be saved for the<br>
subscriber's selecting operations.<br>
After adjusting the node "X1Y2" to be at the same depth as the node "X1Y1", the<br>
IVR subscriber behavior analyzing platform may maintain the node "X1Y2" in the original<br>
position or delete the node "X1Y2" from the original position.<br>
In this embodiment, the longitudinal adjustment is performed on the processing<br>
priority of the service information "X1Y1" and "X1Y2" according to the relevant information<br>
of the subscriber, to make the longitudinally adjusted processing priority be ahead of the<br>
original processing priority. In this way, the procedure for service operation is simplified, the<br>
time interval for service operation is shortened, and the customization for service operation is<br>
realized.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment may also include Step 309 in which the adjusted<br>
processing priority is stored.<br>
Fig.4 is a block diagram of an apparatus for enhancing a processing priority according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.4, the apparatus of the<br>
embodiment includes a first acquiring module 1 and an adjusting module 2 which are<br>
connected sequentially. The first acquiring module 1 is adapted to acquire a predefined<br>
processing priority which includes a first priority and a second priority. The adjusting module<br>
2 is adapted to adjust the first priority and/or the second priority to a third priority higher than<br>
the first priority and/or a fourth priority higher than the second priority respectively according<br>
to relevant information of a subscriber.<br>
<br>
The apparatus of the embodiment further includes a second acquiring module 3 which<br>
is connected to the first acquiring module 1 and is adapted to acquire an adjusting strategy for<br>
the predefined processing priority so as to adjust the first priority and/or the second priority to<br>

of the subscriber.<br>
The second acquiring module 3 of this embodiment further includes a deciding unit<br>
31 and an acquiring unit 32 which are connected sequentially. The acquiring unit 32 is<br>

basic information of the subscriber conforms to a predefined value when reaching an update<br>
period. The acquiring unit 32 is adapted to acquire the adjusting strategy for the predefined<br>
processing priority.<br>
In this embodiment, in the operation of the apparatus for enhancing a processing<br>
priority, when the predefined update period is reached, the deciding unit 31 decides whether<br>
brand of the subscriber, monthly consumption of the subscriber, consumption ability of the<br>
subscriber, age of the subscriber and so on in the basic information of the subscriber conform<br>
to predefined values. If the decision is positive, the acquiring unit 32 acquires an adjusting<br>
strategy for the predefined processing priority to be used to adjust the first priority and/or the<br>
second priority to the third priority and/or the fourth priority respectively according to the<br>
relevant information of the subscriber. Thereafter, the first acquiring module 1 acquires the<br>
predefined processing priority which includes the first priority and the second priority.<br>
Finally, the adjusting module 2 adjusts the first priority and/or the second priority to the third<br>
priority higher than the first priority and/or the fourth priority higher than the second priority<br>
respectively according to the relevant information of the subscriber.<br>
Furthermore, after the adjustment of the processing priority is completed, the<br>
apparatus for enhancing a processing priority in this embodiment may maintain the<br>
predefined processing priority or delete the predefined processing priority by a deleting<br>
module 4. The adjusted priority is stored by a storing module 5.<br>
In this embodiment, a processing priority of a service is adjusted according to the<br>
relevant information of the subscriber, so that the adjusted processing priority is higher than<br>
the predefined processing priority; therefore, it can provide different subscribers with<br>
customized service information providing sequences according to their operation habits. In<br>
this way, the procedure for service operation is simplified, the time interval for service<br>
operation is shortened, and the customization for service operation is realized.<br>
<br>
An embodiment provides a service platform for providing service information inquiry<br>
and processing which includes the apparatus for enhancing a processing priority on a basis of<br>
the embodiment as shown in fig.4. The service platform may include an IPTV service<br>
platform, an IVR service platform, a telephone bank service platform and so on.<br>
Fig.5 is a block diagram of a system for enhancing a processing priority according to<br>
the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig.5, the system of the embodiment<br>
includes an apparatus for enhancing a processing priority 10 and a service platform 0. The<br>
apparatus for enhancing a processing priority 10 includes a first acquiring module 1 and an<br>
adjusting module 2 which are connected sequentially and connected to the service platform 0<br>
respectively. The first acquiring module 1 is adapted to acquire a predefined processing<br>
priority which includes a first priority and a second priority. The adjusting module 2 is<br>
adapted to adjust the first priority and/or the second priority to a third priority higher than<br>
first priority and/or a fourth priority higher than second priority respectively according to<br>
relevant information of the subscriber. The service platform 0 is adapted to extract service<br>
information sequentially according to the predefined processing priorities and to provide<br>
operating information of the subscriber to the apparatus for enhancing a processing priority<br>
10.<br>
The embodiment further includes a second acquiring module 3 which is connected to<br>
the first acquiring module 1 and the service platform 0 and is adapted to acquire an adjusting<br>
strategy for the predefined processing priority<br>
The second acquiring module 3 of this embodiment further includes a deciding unit<br>
31 and an acquiring unit 32 which are connected sequentially and connected to the service<br>
platform 0 respectively. The acquiring unit 32 is connected to the first acquiring module 1.<br>
The deciding unit 31 is adapted to decide whether basic information of the subscriber<br>
conforms to a predefined value when reaching an update period. The acquiring unit 32 is<br>
adapted to acquire the adjusting strategy for the predefined processing priority.<br>
In this embodiment, in the operation of the system for enhancing a processing priority,<br>
when the predefined update period is reached, the deciding unit 31 decides whether the basic<br>
information of the subscriber provided by the service platform 0 conforms to predefined<br>
values. If the decision is positive, the acquiring unit 32 acquires from the service platform 0<br>
an adjusting strategy for the predefined processing priority to be used to adjust the first<br>
priority and/or the second priority to the third priority and/or the fourth priority respectively<br>
according to the relevant information of the subscriber. Thereafter, the first acquiring module<br>
<br>
1 acquires from the service platform 0 the predefined processing priority which includes the<br>
first priority and the second priority. Finally, the adjusting module 2 adjusts the first priority<br>
