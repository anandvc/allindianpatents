				<td>The invention relates to a novel polymer article of low thickness and good transparency having enhanced stability against the effects of light, oxygen, heat and agressive chemicals, which is also effective as a selective UV filter for agricultural applications, and to some novel stabilizers suitable for this application.<br>
Certain polyolefin articles containing UV absorbers of the type hydroxyphenyl triazine are known from GB-A-2319523, EP-A-704437, EP-A-704560, WO 99/57189.<br>
Present invention pertains to a transparent polyolefin, polyester or polyamide article stabilized by addition of 0.005-0.30 % by weight the polymer substrate of a hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorber, characterized in that the article has a thickness between 1 and 500 |j.m.<br>
Preferred articles contain as a hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorber a compound of the formula I<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
components of solar radiation which must be filtered off to obtain high quality and productivity of the crops. Additionally, some microorganisms such as fungi, e.g. Botrytis cinerea, Botryosporium, Cladosporium cucumerium, Endomyces geotrichium, Endomyces fibulinger, Sphaerotheca pannosa, Erysiphe polygon!, Gonatobotrys, Cylindrocapron, Fusarium.Thielaviopsis, Verticillium, and virus, e.g Cucumo-virus, Tombus-virus, etc. as well as some harmful insects, e.g. white flies, aphides, thrips or leafminers, proliferate under preferred specific UV-irradiation. These pests can be significantly reduced when UV light does not or to less extent reach the plants. [R. Reuveni etal., Development of photoselective PE films for control of foliar pathogens in greenhiouse-grown crops, Plasticulture No. 102, p. 7 (1994); Y. Antlgnus et ai. Tine use of UV absorbing plastic stieets to protect crops against insects and spread of virus diseases, CI PA Congress March 1997, pp.23-33]. On the other hand, bee activity, requiring a certain band of UV radiation, needs to be retained in greenhouses in order to ensure fructification on flowering plants, e.g. tomato, cucumber, pumpkin, melon, lemon, rose, strawberry, lettuce, grape, pepper etc.<br>
Present hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorbers show excellent compatibility and persistence in the polyolefin, polyester or polyamide. The same time, these UV absorbers provide efficient and selective UV shielding for suppressing microbial proliferation in a protected environment, especially a plant cultivation, while retaining the UV irradiation necessary for bee, bumblebee activity. Thus, present invention also pertains to the use of a transparent polyolefin film as described above for suppressing microbial proliferation in a protected cultivation.<br>
Examples for polyolefines to be used for manufacturing the articles of present invention include the following polymers:<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HOPE), high density and high mole¬cular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight poly¬ethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br><br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, prefe¬rably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, Vlb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either n- or o-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal aikyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br><br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1), for example mixtures of polypropylene with polylsobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.	Polyolefin copolymers: Copolymers of monoolefins and diolefins with each other or with other vinyl monomers, for example ethylene/propylene copolymers, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and mixtures thereof with low density polyethylene (LDPE), propylene/but-1-ene copolymers, propylene/lsobutylene copolymers, ethylene/but-1-ene copolymers, ethylene/hexene copolymers, ethylene/methylpentene copolymers, ethyiene/heptene copolymers, ethylene/octene copolymers, propylene/butadiene copolymers, isobutylene/isoprene copolymers, ethylene/alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/alkyi methacrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers and their copolymers with carbon monoxide or ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers and their salts<br><br>
(ionomers) as well as terpolymers of ethylene with propylene and a diene such as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene-norbornene; and mixtures of such copolymers with one another and with polymers mentioned in 1) above, for example polypropylene/ethylene-propylene copolymers, LDPE/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), LDPE/ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), LLDPE/EVA, LLDPE/EAA and alter¬nating or random polyalkylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and mixtures thereof with other polymers, for example polyamides.<br>
Polyesters to be used for manufacturing the articles of present invention are mainly those derived from dicarboxylic acids and diols and/or from hydroxycarboxylic acids or the corresponding lactones, for example polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, poly-1,4-dimethylolcycIohexane terephthalate, polyalkylene naphthalate (PAN) and polyhydroxybenzoates, as well as block copolyether esters derived from hydroxyl-terminated polyethers; and also polyesters modified with polycarbonates or MBS. Preferred is polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
Polyamides are usually those derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids and/or from aminocarboxylic acids or the corresponding lactams, for example polyamide 4, polyamide 6, polyamide 6/6, 6/10, 6/9, 6/12, 4/6,12/12, polyamide 11, polyamide 12, aromatic polyamides starting from m-xylene diamine and adipic acid; polyamides prepared from hexamethylenediamine and isophthalic or/and terephthalic acid and with or without an ela¬stomer as modifier, for example poly-2,4,4,-trimethylhexamethylene terephthalamide or poly-m-phenylene isophthalamide; and also block copolymers of the aforementioned polyamides with polyolefins, olefin copolymers, ionomers or chemically bonded or grafted elastomers; or with polyethers, e.g. with polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polytetramethylene glycol; as well as polyamides or copolyamides modified with EPDM or ABS; and polyamides condensed during processing (RIM polyamide systems).<br>
Most preferred are polyolefines such as polyethylene, especially LDPE or LLDPE, or polypropylene.<br>
Preferably, the amount of hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorber in the transparent polymer article of the invention is from 0.005 to 0.15 %, more preferably from 0.005 to 0.06 %, especially from 0.01 to 0.06 % by weight the polymer substrate.<br><br>
The transparent polyolefin, polyester or polyamide article of the invention usually is a film, fiber, ribbon or stretched tape, especially an agricultural film. Its thickness preferably ranges between 1 and 300 )im, especially between 1 and 200 [im. Films, ribbons or tapes of the invention usually are not biaxially oriented. The transparent polyolefin, polyester or polyamide article of the invention often contains one or more further components, e.g. selected from further light stabilizers, processing stabilizers, fillers, clarifiers, modifiers, acid scavengers, pigments, flame retardants or other additives known in the art. These components usually do not effectively block light transmission through the present polymer articles, which is usually more than 20 %, often more than 50 %, and preferably more than 80 % of white incoming light. For sufficient transparency, present articles preferably do not contain crystalline components in an amount that would significantly impair this property; preferably they contain no pigments and no or merely minor amounts, e.g. 0 - 5 % by weight of the polymer, of fillers or crystalline inorganic components having lower opaquing effect than pigments (e.g. hydrotalcites). Examples for additional components which may be contained in the polymer articles of the invention include the following:<br>

Synthesis of 2,4-bis-biphenyl-6-[2-liydroxy-4-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)plienyl]-1,3,5-triazine<br>
A yellow suspension of 2,4-bis-blphenyl-6-[2,4-dihydroxyphenyl]-1,3,5-triazine (11.2 g, 0.0227 mole) in dimethylformamide (30 ml) is heated under nitrogen at 70 ° until a clear brown solution is formed. Anhydrous potassium carbonate (3.77 g, 0.0227 mole) is added and the brown suspension heated at 80 °C for 30 minutes. 2-Ethylhexylbromide (5.70g, 0.0295 mole) is added dropwise over 30 minutes, after which the suspension is heated at 110 °C for a further 3 hours. Precipitated salts are filtered off and the filtrate cooled to 0 °C. Methanol (20 ml) is added and the precipitated product removed by filtration. After drying under vacuum, 2,4-bis-biphenyl-6-[2-hydroxy-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy-phenyl]-1,3,5-tria2ine (12.8 g) is obtained with mp 70 °.<br>
h) When in the above preparation the educt 2,4-bis-biphenyl-6-[2,4-dihydroxyphenyl]-1,3,5-triazine is replaced by the equivalent amount of 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-[2,4-dihydroxyphenyl]-1,3,5-triazine, compound (h) of the formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
To a solution of 92 g (0.050 mol) of the oligomer of Example (m) in 300 ml of xylene, 1.0 g of platinum on carbon (10 % w/w) is added. The mixture is poured into an autoclave and hydrogenated for 24 hours at 65 bar (PH2) and 105°C. The hydrogenated mixture is purified from the catalyst by adding 10 g of Tonsyll© 414 FF at 80-90°C and left under vigorous stirring for 2 hours. After filtering off over a pad of 10 g of Tonsil the filtrated yel¬low solution is concentrated under vacuum and a pale yellow solid is obtained.<br>

films are prepared, containing, as a typical formulation, 0.15% by weight of the above compound (a) and 0.70% of the sterically hindered amine ether (1g-2), used as light stabilizer of the polymeric system in highly demanding environments for agriculture applications. To do so, properly weighted amounts of the compounds are mixed with ground LDPE (Polimeri Europa, supplied by Enichem, Milano, Italy), characterized by a density of 0.921 g/cm^ and a melt flow index (190°C/2.16 kg) of 0.6 in a turbo mixer. The mixture is extruded at a maximum temperature of 200°C in a OMC® twin-screw extruder. The granules so obtained are blown in a lab scale Formac® blow-extruder at a maximum temperature of 210°C to give a film of 150 |im thicl<ness.></ness.>
UV-Vis spectrum of the film as-obtained is recorded in the range 200-800 nm by means of a Perkin-Elmer lambda® 20 spectrophotometer, equipped with a RSA-PE-20 Labsphere® integrating sphere. At 0.15% loading, compound (a) imparts to the film a strong UV absorption feature, with a transmittance value less than 10% between 290 and 360 nm and less than 1% between 300 and 340 nm. The photostability of compound (a) is demonstrated by exposing the film sample to UV light in an Atlas Ci 65 Xenon Arc Weather-0-meter® (WOM, 63°C black panel temperature, continues dry cycle, according to ASTM G 26-96). After 1500 hours of WOM exposure the minimum transmittance displayed by the film is still around 1% at 320 nm.<br>
Compound (a) is fully compatible in LDPE film; no blooming is observed after storage of the film for 6000 hours at room temperature. Same behavior is observed keeping the film for the same amount of time in oven at 60°C. After the same time of exposure in oven, no significant change in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum is observed, meaning there is no loss of additive, because of the high temperature.<br>
WOM exposure of the formulation reported in this example is continuing, in order to evaluate the light stability performance of the polymer containing compound (a). Samples are also being exposed to natural weathering and are subdued to treatments with pesticides, in order to evaluate the resistance to chemicals that can be employed in agriculture.<br>
Example 2: Hvdroxvphenvl triazine compound (c) as a UV Filter in a Polvethvlene Agrofilm In order to prepare thin LDPE films and to evaluate the spectral features imparted by the additive and its persistency, compound (c) is mixed with LDPE pellets (Riblene FF 29, supplied by Polimeri Europa, Milano, Italy), characterized by a density of 0.921 g/cm^ and a melt flow index (190°C/2.16Kg) of 0.6) in a turbo mixer in order to give a formulation containing 0.15% by weight of the additive. The mixture is extruded at a maximum<br><br>
temperature of 200°C in a OMC twin-screw extruder. The granules so obtained are blown in a lab scale Formac blow-extruder at a maximum temperature of 210°C to give a film 150|im thick. UV-Vis spectra are recorded in the range 200-800 nm by means of a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 20 spectrophotometer, equipped with a RSA-PE-20 Labsphere integrating sphere.<br>
Results: The film displays a strong absorption band in the range 280-360 nm. In particular, transmittance is below 20% in the above mentioned range and below 5% In the range 295-345 nm.<br>
In order to test the photostability of the additive upon exposure to light, a portion of the film is exposed in an Atlas Weather-o-Meter (WOM), model Ci65A (as per ASTM G26-96, irradiance 0.35 W/m^, black panel temperature 63±3 °C). After 1000 hours of exposure the film still displays a transmittance below 40% between 280 and 360 nm and below 25% between 295 and 345 nm.<br>
Example 3<br>

After 1000 hours of exposure in the WOM (see example 2 for details), the film still retains the<br>
spectral features described above.<br>
Another portion of the film is also exposed in a forced circulating air oven at 60°C, in order to<br>
evaluate the thermal persistency of the additive in the film. After 1000 hours of exposure the<br>
film still retains the initial spectral features.<br>

spectral features described above.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
A film containing 0.15% by weight of compound (g)is prepared as described in example 2.<br>
The film displays a strong absorption band in the range 280-360 nm. In particular,<br>
transmittance is below 20% in the above mentioned range and below 5% in the range 295-<br>
345 nm.<br>
After 1000 hours of exposure in the WOM (see example 2 for details), the film still displays a<br>
transmittance below 25% between 280 and 360 nm and below 10% between 295 and 345<br>
nm.<br>
Another portion of the film is also exposed in oven at 60°C. After 1000 hours of exposure the<br>
film retains about 75% of the initial absorption.<br>
Example 6: A film containing 0.15% by weight of compound (f) is prepared as described in<br>
example 2. The film displays a strong absorption band in the range 280-360 nm. In<br>
particular, transmittance is below 20% in the above mentioned range and below 5% in the<br>
range 295-345 nm.<br>
After 1000 hours of exposure in the WOM (see example 2 for details), the film still displays a<br>
transmittance below 25% between 280 and 360 nm and below 15% between 295 and 345<br>
nm.<br>
Example 7: Light stabilization of polypropylene (PP) cast films<br>
100 parts of polypropylene powder (melt flow index 3.8 g/10 minutes, 230°C / 2160 g) are blended in a barrel mixer with 0.05 parts of pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-3-(3,5-ditert.butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate, 0.05 parts of tris-( 2,4-di-tert.bu-tylphenyl )-phosphite, 0.1 parts of Ca stearate, 0.1 part HALS and the amount of UV absorber (compound j) indicated in the figures below. Then the blend is compounded in an extruder at temperatures of 180-220°C. The granules obtained on extrusion and granulation are transformed into films at 220-260°C in a second extruder equipped with a flat sheet die. Samples of 60 x 25 mm are cut out of these 0.11 mm films and exposed in a WEATHER-OMETER Ci 65 (black panel temperature 63±2°C, without water-spraying).<br>
Periodically, these samples are removed from the exposure apparatus and their carbonyl content is measured with an infrared spectrophotometer. The exposure time corresponding to formation of a carbonyl absorbance of 0.1 is a measure for the stabilizing efficiency of the<br><br>
light stabilizer. The values obtained are plotted in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The following HALS are used (0.1 part of each per 100 parts PP):<br>
Fig. 1: Low molecular mass HALS H-2 (bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate); Fig. 2: Polymeric HALS H-3 (CAS-No. 65447-77-0, white circles);<br>
polymeric HALS H-4 (white squares); and<br>
blend of 1 part H-3 with 1 part H-4 (filled circles); Fig. 3: non-polymeric high molecular mass HALS H-5.<br>
Fig. 1: Effect of the addition of hydroxyphenyl-triazine UV absorber compound (j) in presence of a low molecular mass HALS H-2 in PP cast films (0.1 mm thick). To.i = exposure time to 0.1 carbonyl absorbance.<br><br><br>
Fig. 2: Effect of the addition of a hydroxyphenyl-triazine UV absorber compound 0) in presence of a polymeric HALS H-3 (white circles), H-4 (white squares) and blend of 1 part H-3 with 1 part H-4 (filled circles) in PP cast films (0.1 mm thick). TQ.I = exposure time to 0.1 carbonyl absorbance.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3: Effect of the addition of a hydroxypiienyltriazine UV absorber compound j in presence of liigh molecular mass HALS H-5 in PP cast films (0.1 mm thick). To.1 = exposure time to 0.1 carbonyl absorbance.<br><br>
The plots show that already small amounts of the hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorber give considerable improvement of the UV stability conferred by HALS.<br>
Example 8: Light stabilization of polypropylene tapes<br>
100 parts of polypropylene powder ( melt flow index 3.5 g/10 minutes, 230°C / 2160 g ) are blended in a barrel mixer with 0.05 parts of pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-3-(3,5-ditert.butyl--4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate, 0.05 parts of tris-( 2,4-di-tert.butylphenyl )-phosphite, 0.1 parts of Ca stearate, 0.1 % polymeric HALS H-3 (condensate of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypiperidine and succinic acid (CAS-No. 65447-77-0)) and the amount of light stabilizer compound (j) indicated in the figure. Then the blend is compounded in an extruder at temperatures of 180 -220 °C. The granules obtained on extrusion and granulation are transformed into films at 220-260°C in a second extruder equipped with a flat<br><br>
sheet die. The films are cut into ribbons, which are drawn to achieve a stretch ratio of 1:6. The tapes obtained with this procedure are finally 50 \xm thick and 2.5 mm wide.<br>
The tapes are mounted without tension on sample holders and subjected to natural weathering in Florida (45° South, direct, approximately 140 kLy/year). Periodically, the tensile strength of the exposed tapes is measured. The received energy (in kLy) corresponding to a loss of 50 % of the initial tensile strength is a measure for the stabilizing efficiency of the light stabilizer. The values obtained with a polymeric HALS and the    &gt; hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorber are plotted in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4: Effect of the addition of hydroxyIphenyI triazine UV absorber (compound j) in presence of 0.1 % polymeric HALS H-3 in PP tapes (50 i^m thick). E50 = energy to 50% retained tensile strength.<br><br>
The results show that the contribution of the UV absorber to light stability is also marked in PP tapes that are less than half as thick as the PP films used in Example 7.<br><br>
Example 9: Light stabilization of polypropylene tapes<br>
100 parts of polypropylene powder (melt flow index 3.5 g/10 minutes, 230°C / 2160 g) are blended in a barrel mixer with 0.05 parts of pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-3-(3,5-ditert.butyl-4hydroxyphenyl)-propionate, 0.05 parts of tris-( 2,4-di-tert. butyl-phenyl) phosphite, 0.1 parts of Ca stearate and the amount of light stabilizers indicated in the below table. Then the blend is compounded in an extruder at temperatures of 180 -220 °C. The granules obtained on extrusion and granulation are transformed into films at 220-260°C in a second extruder equipped with a flat sheet die. The films are cut into ribbons, which are drawn to achieve a stretch ratio of 1:6. The tapes obtained with this procedure are finally 50 |j,m thick and 2.5 mm wide.<br>
The tapes are mounted without tension on sample holders and exposed in a WEATHER-0-METER Ci 65 (black panel temperature 63±2°C, without water-spraying). Periodically, the tensile strength of the exposed tapes is measured. The exposure time corresponding to a loss of 50 % of the initial tensile strength (T50) is a measure for the stabilizing efficiency of the light stabilizer.<br><br><br><br>
The data show that the contribution of the hydroxyphenyl triazine UV absorber (compound j) to the light stability of the tapes is significant while the contribution of the benzotriazole or the benzophenone UV absorber (V-1 and V-2) remains small or not detectable.<br>
Example 10: Absorption band and persistency in LDPE of compound (m)<br>
Thin low density polyethylene (LDPE) films are prepared as described in example 2 but without addition of HALS. They are 150|.im thick and contain 0.5% of the compound (m). UV-Vis spectra are recorded as described in example 2. The film displays a strong absorption in the range 280-360 nm. Transmittance values below 3% are detected in the range 290-350 nm.<br>
The persistency of the polymer in LDPE films is determined after exposure of the films at 60°C in a forced circulating air oven and evaluated as described in example 3. No decrease of the absorbance value at the maximum is observed after 3000 hours at 60°C.<br><br><br>
