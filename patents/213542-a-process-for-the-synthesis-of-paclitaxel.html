                              Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to the synthesis of paclitaxel from " lO-deacetylbaccatin-III which is protected at the 7-position with a dialkylalkoxysilyl protecting group.<br>
Background &amp; Summary of the Invention<br>
Paclitaxel (Taxol®), a diterpene taxane compound, is a natural  product extracted from the. bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus Brevifolia.  It has been shown to have excellent antitumor activity in in vivo animal models, and recent studies have elucidated its unique mode of action,   which involves abnormal polymerization of tubulin and disruption of  mitosis during the cell cycle. Taxol has recently been approved for the treatment of refractory advanced ovarian cancer, breast cancer and most recently, AIDS-related Kaposi"s Sarcoma. The results of paclitaxel clinical studies are replete in scientific periodicals and have been reviewed by numerous authors, such as Rowinsky and Donehower in The Clinical Pharmacology and Use of Antimicrotubule Agents in Cancer Chemotherapeutics, Phamac. Ther., 52, pp. 35-84 (1991); Spencer and Faulds, Paclitaxel. A Review of its Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Properties and Therapeutic Potential in the Treatment of Cancer, Drugs, 48 (5), pp. 794-847 (1994); KC. Nicolau et al.,    .

Commercial pharmaceutical products containing paclitaxel are available, e.g. for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer, and most recently, AIDS-related Kaposi"s Sarcoma. Paclitaxel has also shown promising results in clinical studies for the treatment of other cancers. As a result, the demand for paclitaxel continues to escalate, and ever increasing amounts of paclitaxel are needed with each passing year for continued research and clinical studies.    Paclitaxel is extracted with difficulty and in low yields for the bark of Taxus brevifolia (approximately 1 kg. of the drug is isolated from the bark of 3,000 T. brevifolia trees). Because of the difficulty in extracting adequate yields, alternative sources for synthesizing paclitaxel are needed.<br>
10-deacetylbaccatin-III ("10-DAB") (1, Scheme-1) is currently the starting material for the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel, and may be readily extracted from the needles and twigs of the European Yew tree, Taxus baccata L. 10-DAB does not, however, exhibit the degree of anti-tumor activity demonstrated by paclitaxel. Accordingly, the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel from baccatin III, 10-DAB and other taxane compounds is of great interest and importance.<br>
Three distinct approaches for making paclitaxel are known in the literature. Two approaches utilizes 7-O-TES-baccatin-III (3, Scheme-1) obtained from the selective silylation and acetylation of 10-DAB (1) (Greene et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, p. 5917 (1988). The first route, developed by Prof. Holton and disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,274,124 (Scheme-2) reacts the lithium anion of 3 with a •-lactam to introduce the required amino acid side chain at the 13-position. The second route developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/995,443, and by D.G.I. Kingston et al. in Tetrahedron Letters 35, p. 4483 (1994), (Scheme-3) couples 3 with an oxazolinecarboxylic acid ((4S-trans)-4,5-dihydro-2,4-diphenyl-5-<br><br>
oxazolecarboxylic acid) (4) using DCC or similar dehydrating agent. Using DCC, A. Commercon et al. at Rhone Poulenc Rhorer (Tetrahedron Letters 33, pp. 5185-5188 (1992), have developed a third synthesis of paclitaxel coupling 7-O-Troc-baccatin-III (5) with the protected •-phenylisoserine (6) shown in Scheme-4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention OSi Osi<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a rapid, new, useful and efficient protocol for the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel from 7-0 protected 10-deacetylbaccatin-III derivatives, which generally comprises acetylation at the 10-position, followed by the attachment of a paclitaxel sidechain to the protected 10-deacetylbaccatin-III derivatives, and the subsequent deprotection of the 7-0-protected 10-deacetylbaccatin-III derivatives.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the provision of methods of producing various 10-deacetylbaccatin-III derivatives having a :  protecting group at the C-7 site on the taxane structure, and which, after attachment of a sidechain and subsequent deprotection, yields paclitaxel in significant amounts.<br>
An additional object of the present invention is the provision of a simple, efficient, and cost effective protocol for the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention encompasses a novel method by which 10-deacetylbaccatin-III can be efficiently converted to 7-0-protected 10-deacetylbaccatin-III using several different protecting groups. After attachment of a paclitaxel sidechain at the C-13 site, these 7-O-protected 10-deacetylbaccatin-III compounds can then be easily converted into paclitaxel making 10-deacetylbaccatin-III a valuable starting material for the semisynthesis of paclitaxel.<br>
The present disclosure is broadly directed to a chemical process for the rapid and efficient production of paclitaxel, intermediates and precursors thereof. More specifically, the present invention is directed to the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel by protecting the 7-hydroxyl of paclitaxel precursor 10-deacetylbaccatin-III to provide 7-0-protected 10-deacetylbaccatin-III, using dialkyldichlorosilanes, followed by the selective acetylation at the C-10 position, the coupling of a paclitaxel sidechain at the C-13 position, and the subsequent deprotection at the C-7<br><br>
position and replacement of the protecting group with a hydrogen. More particularly, the invention utilizes diakyldichlorosilane protecting groups such as Ph2SiCl2 and i-Pr2SiCl2 at the C-7 site on the taxane during the coupling of the paclitaxel sidechain at the C-13 position.<br>
The general process described herein involves the production of 7-0-protected-10-deacetylbaccatin-III derivatives, such as 7-OS(i-Pr)2(OMe)-10-deacetylbaccatin-III, selective acetylation at C-10 to form a compound such as, for example, 7-OSi(i-Pr)2(OMe)-baccatin-III, followed by the coupling of a sidechain at C-13, and the deprotection of the C-13 to form       paclitaxel. A particularly advantageous dialkyldichlorosilane protecting . group has the generic chemical formula:-Si(R)2(OR")5 where R= Me, Et, i-Pr, Bu, Ph and R"=Me, Et, Pr, i-Pr, t-Bu, CH2CF3, CH2CF2CH3, CH(CF3)2 and H. Protecting groups are discussed in detail in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Second Ed., by Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts (1991, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.).<br>
The specific examples which follow illustrate the synthesis of representative compounds of the instant invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention in sphere or scope. The methods may be adapted to variations in order to produce intermediates and compounds   embraced by this invention but not specifically disclosed. Further, variations of the methods to produce the same compounds in somewhat different fashion will also be evident to one skilled in the art.<br>
(I) Silylation: 10-DAB (1) was reacted with a series of dialkyldichlorosilanes (e.g. Ph2SiCl2 and z-Pr2SiCl2) in the presence imidazole in DMF under different reaction temperatures (RT to -53°C) for 1-3.5 h. The resulting monochlorosilane intermediates were treated with alcohols, such as MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH, PrOH, i-BuOH, CF3CH2OH, CF3CF2OH, (CF3)2CHOH and water. The crude products obtained after workup were purified by either crystallization or chromatography to<br><br>
provide a good yield of 7-0-Si(R)2(OR")-10-DAB (7-23, See Scheme-5). This silylation reaction can also be performed in dimethylacetamide and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.<br>
Dimethyldichlorosilane behaved differently among five other diallkyldichlorosilanes studied in the silylation of 10-DAB (1). An extensive decomposition of 10-DAB (1) was observed when 10-DAB (1) was treated dimethyldichlorosilane in DMF in the presence of imidazole for 1 h at -33°C followed by addition of 2-propanol. However, the pre-formed reagent from dimethyldichlorosilane, i.e. chloromethoxydimethysilane was reacted with 1 in the presence of imidazole in DMF and furnished 7-OSiMe2(OMe)-10-DAB (24) in 48.9% yield. Using the preformed reagent approach, 7-OSi(i-Pr)2(OMe)-10-DAB (15) was also prepared from 10-DAB (1) and diisopropylmethoxychlorosilane. The latter reagent was prepared from diisopropyldichlorosilane with methanol in the presence of . triethylamine.<br>
The above silylation study determined the following: (i) The order  of reactivity is Me2SiCl2&gt;Et2SiCl2&gt;Pr2SiCl2, N-Bu2SiCl2&gt;i-Pr2SiCl2&gt;Ph2SiCl2: and (ii) Selectivity of diisopropyldichlorosilane to undergo silylation at 7-position of 10-DAB is excellent compared to dethyldichlorosilane, and formation of bis-7,10 or 7,13-O-silylated products are insignificant.<br>
At the outset of this study, silylation of 10-DAB (1) with<br>
trialkoxychlorosilanes, such as (EtO)3SiCl was also examined, and 7-0-<br>
Si(OEt)3-10-DAB (26) was obtained therefrom in high yield.	 <br>
(II)     Acetylation: Acetylation of a few 7-OSi(R)2(OR")-10-DAB (7-13, 15,16,19, 21 and 24) were conducted using LiHMDS and acetyl imidazole at -45 to -25 °C. Results are summarized in Scheme-6. The following conclusions are made:<br><br>
*Facile order of acetylation: 7-OSiMe2(OR")&gt;7-OSiEt2(OR")-10-DAB, 7-OSiBu2Si(OR")-10-DAB&gt;7-OSi(i-Pr)2(OR")-10-DAB<br>
*Decreasing reactivity was observed as the steric bulk of the alcoholic group in 7-OSi(R)2(OR") is increased.<br>
" In the case of 7-OSi(£-Pr)2(OMe)-10-DAB (15), acetylation has been "     examined in DMF and THF. Reactions in DMF were faster, and cleaner.<br>
(Ill)   Paclitaxel: A few acetylated baccatin derivatives were selected for further conversion to paclitaxel using both the BMOP and oxazolinecarboxylic acid sidechain approaches. In the first method, 7-OSiEt2(OCH2CF3)-baccatin-in (32) was coupled with BMOP ((3R-cis)-l-Benzoyl-3-(l-methoxy-l-methylethoxy)-4-phen-yl-2-azetidinone)in anhydrous THF (-55 °C, RT, 2h) as shown in the Scheme-7. The resulting MOP intermediate (39) was hydrolyzed with TFA/AcOH/H20 in 17 h to provide paclitaxel after chromatography.<br>
In the second approach (Scheme-8), four examples (31, 32, 33 and 34) were coupled with (4S-trans)-4, 5-dihyro-2,4-diphenyl-5-oxazolecarboxylic acid in the presence of DCC (or DIC) and DMAP in toluene at room temperature for 1-4 h to furnish coupled product in excellent yields. Other activating reagents, such as Morpho CDI, BDDC, EDC and T3P gave incomplete reactions. The coupled products (40-43) were hydrolyzed with TFA/AcOH/water and the O-benzoyl group was migrated to the amine with TEA to furnish paclitaxel in 76-100% yield.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art can, using the above description perform the processes disclosed and prepare the full scope of the intermediates and compounds of the present invention. The following examples further exemplify the general procedure for the preparation procedures inherent in the synthesis of paclitaxel from 10-deacetylbaccatin-III.<br>
The following examples describe the manner and process of making and using the invention and are illustrative rather than limiting. It should be understood that there might be other embodiments that fall within the spirit and scope of the" invention as defined by the claims appended hereto. Additionally, the following examples illustrate the invention but should not be interpreted as a limitation thereon.<br>
