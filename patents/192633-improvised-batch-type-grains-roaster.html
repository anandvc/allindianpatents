This Invention relates to an 'Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster".<br>
Roasting of grains or granules is done by manual means, like Pan-Roasting Method etc., which mainly depends on manpower and the process is not efficient and perfect Further, skilled labour is required to ensure that the grains are not over-roasted, which otherwise may result in a lot of wastage. Further, the conventional roasting methods consume a lot of space and is totally exposed to foreign particles. The aim of this Invention is to provide an efficient and mechanised grains roaster, which handles in batches, is fuel efficient, reduces manpower, provides an efficient process, is compact and eliminates any skilled labour.<br>
This newly invented Roaster can roast all types of particles, with or without any intermediate material. Though, mostly the intermediate material is sand, there is no constraint, as even liquids and semi-liquids can be used as intermediates. This Roaster can roast the grains uniformly, contrary to the conventional systems available. Further, the roasting drum is not exposed to the atmosphere thereby making the operation hygienic. This Roaster is compact and occupies very lesser space man the conventional methods. Further, though the rotation of the drum is by motor drive, geared to the required torque and rpm, it is not totally dependent on electricity, as there is provision to operate it manually in the event of power failure.<br>
This newly invented Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster basically consists of a Roasting Drum(l), carrying a ribs arrangement(2), at one side of the inner surface, which end is closed and at another side a filter arrangement (3), which end is opera The Rotating<br><br>
Drum is axle mounted on two bearings(4) on either end, supported by two columns (5 &amp; 6) as shown in the accompanying drawing sheet The bearing mount on column (5) is in fixed position, while that on Column (6) is movable vertically and can be lowered or raised with the help of an arrangement (7). The Rotating Drum is covered by a cylindrical metallic cover (8) with Insulation, carrying a Hopper(9) at the top of open end, which acts as the Inlet for the grains and Outlet hopper (10) at the bottom of open end, where the roasted grains exit The Rotating Drum derives power for its rotation from a motor (11) fixed to one of the columns i.e., fixed column (5). The arrangement between the motor and the driving shaft is geared (12) to meet the required torque and rpm.<br>
The grains for roasting, which is to be fed into the Rotating Drum can be with or without the intermediate material, depending upon the type of grains. During rotation, the outer surface of the Rotating drum is heated by the heating arrangement with fuel like Gas, Oil, Coal, etc.,<br>
The Rotating Drum carries within it a Ribs Arrangement^), which makes the grains to mix with each other and with the intermediate material(if provided) thoroughly &amp; uniformly, by virtue of the stirring action of the ribs. During this roasting operation, the open end of the Rotating Drum is kept at a higher level, as compared to the closed end This arrangement ensures that the grains do not come out through the Open end As such, the grains are roasted uniformly. After the grains are roasted for a sufficient time, the movable bearing mount at the open end of the drum is to be lowered vertically, so that closed end of the drum attains a higher position than the open end As there is a Conical Filter Arrangement (3), which consists of inner conical surface at the open end of the drum, the roasted grains  get filtered from the intermediate  material<br><br>
(which particles are smaller than the grains) and exit. The intermediate material will be stored separately in the closed conical section and will not come out. If the grains are roasted without intermediate material, the grains need not be filtered and will come out through the Open end.<br>
After the exit of the roasted grains, the movable bearing mount at the open end is to be raised to a higher level as enumerated in the enclosed drawing, so that the intermediate material collects at the closed end, by virtue of the lower position it attains, when compared to the open end. Simultaneously, the open end is now exposed to the Inlet hopper(9) to receive the fresh grains that are to be roasted, which is the next batch.<br>
The shape and size of the rotating drum and conical filter arrangement, rpm of the rotating drum, method of drive, intermediate material and such other parameters could be varied to suit the requirement<br>
The intermediate material which has to be mixed with the grains while roasting is already fed in the rotating drum permanently.<br>
In the conventional pan-roasting system, uniform heating is not ensured. Consequently, each grain particle gets heated to a different degree, which has been overcome to a great extent in this "Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster".<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim,<br>
1)	An Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster, comprising of a<br>
Rotating Drum (1), mounted on an axle and supported by two columns (5 &amp; 6) at either end, each of the column carrying a bearing (4) within which the axle of the Rotating Drum rotates and the Rotating Drum (1) has a rib-arrangement (2) within, which facilitates the uniform mixing of the grains between themselves and also with the Intermediate material.<br>
2)	An Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster, as claimed in<br>
Claim (1), wherein the position of the Rotating Drum (1)<br>
supported on Columns (5 &amp; 6) could be varied vertically by<br>
virtue of a locking facility (7) provided on the taller column<br>
(6), which facilitates easy input of the raw grains sod also easy<br>
exit of the roasted grains.<br>
3)	An Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster, as claimed in<br>
Claim (1), wherein the filter-arrangement (3) within the<br>
rotating drum (1), after the completion of the roasting<br>
operation, separates the grains and the intermediate material<br>
and the grains exit from the rotating drum (1), when the open<br>
end of the rotating drum is sided down along the column (6).<br>
4)	An Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster, as claimed in<br>
Claims (1) to (3), wherein a Knuckle Joint (13) is provided on<br><br>
the top of the fixed column (5) to take care of the angular movement of the rotating drum shaft, at the time of operation.<br>
5) An Improvised Batch-type Grains Roaster, as claimed in Claim (1), wherein the Rotating Drum (1) is totally insulated lore heat conservancy and is covered by a cylindrical metallic sheet (8), concealing die process from the entry of any foreign particles at the time of operation, thereby making the process hygienic.<br><br><br></td>
