program, or information for perform: ng the reproduction<br>
control.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatuses which enable moving picture image information to<br>
be recorded into a large capacity of recording medium such as<br>
a DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) , etc. and at the same time enable<br>
such moving picture image information to be reproduced have<br>
been being generalized.<br>
And, in each of those information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatuses , it is constructed in the way in which, as described,<br>
for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
2000-35375, for making easy the search, etc. of the respective<br>
'moving picture image information that has been recorded, a<br>
representative picture image (the "thumb-nail picture image")<br>
symbolically representing the content of the respective moving<br>
picture image information is recorded in the recording medium<br>
separately from that moving picture image information; and,<br>
when reproducing the respective moving picture image<br>
information, the corresponding representative picture image<br>
is displayed in advance of the time when performing that<br>
reproduction to thereby enable a searching of the moving picture<br>
image information, etc. to be reproduced.<br>
On the other hand, in the above-described information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus, in a case where reproducing<br>
a recording medium having recorded therein specified moving<br>
picture image information, etc. (hereinafter referred to,<br>
simply, as "the specified moving picture image information,<br>
etc.") the presentation of which ro a person whose age is below<br>
18 for example is prohibited, in many cases a function to limit<br>
the execution of the reproduction processing of the specified<br>
moving picture image information, etc. is added to the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus as the function<br>
of this apparatus itself.<br>
However, in the construction of the above-described<br>
conventional information recording/reproducing apparatus,<br>
although, indeed, executing the reproduction processing of the<br>
specified moving picture image information, etc. itself can<br>
be limited, up to the reproduction of the above-described<br>
representative picture image corresponding to that specified<br>
moving picture image information, etc. is not limited. As a<br>
result, there was the problem that it is impossible to hide<br>
the content of the specified moving picture image information.<br>
Further , regarding the moving picture image information ,<br>
etc. containing therein very personal information, as well,<br>
similarly, although executing the reproduction processing of<br>
that information, etc. itself can be limited, there was the<br>
problem that it is impossible to limit up to the reproduction<br>
of the representative picture image corresponding to the content<br>
of that information, etc.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Next, a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
will now be explained with reference to the drawings.<br>
It is to be noted that the embodiments explained below<br>
are the ones in which the present invention has been applied<br>
to an information recording/reproducing apparatus wherein<br>
information can be recorded and reproduced with respect to a<br>
disc-like recording medium (concretely, for example, a DVD<br>
enabling rewrite of information with respect thereto aplurality<br>
of times, etc. and each of these media is hereinafter referred<br>
to simply as "the optical disc") enabling optical<br>
recording/reproduction of information with respect thereto a<br>
plurality of times.<br>
(I) First embodiment<br>
First, a first embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be explained using Figures 1 to 11.<br>
(A) Embodiment of the recording format<br>
Initially, before concretely explaining the construction<br>
of an information recording/reproducing apparatus according<br>
to the first embodiment, using Figure 1, an explanation will<br>
be given of the recording format that is used when recording<br>
information with respect to the optical disc by the use of that<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus according to the<br>
first embodiment. Incidentally, Figure 1 is a diagram<br>
illustrating a recording format (physical format) of the<br>
respective information according to the first, embodiment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, after information has been<br>
recorded, with the information recording/reproducing apparatus ,<br>
with respect to an optical disc 1 according to the first<br>
embodiment, there are formed on the optical disc 1 sequentially<br>
from its inner-peripheral side the following three areas. The<br>
firstareaisa lead-in area LI in which there is recorded starting<br>
information that is to be read when starting reproduction<br>
processing of the information recorded (more specifically,<br>
starting information containing therein, for example, the<br>
radiation intensity of a light beam for reproduction processing ,<br>
etc.), the second area is a data area DA in which there are<br>
recorded that information to be reproduced, reproduction<br>
control information for controlling the way of reproducing that<br>
information, etc., and the third area is a lead-out area LO<br>
in which there is recorded ending information that is to be<br>
read out when ending the reproduction processing of the<br>
information recorded.<br>
Next, within the data area DA, there are recorded general<br>
information GM, menu control information MC, a for-use-as-menu<br>
static image data group MD, mark, control information KC, a<br>
for-use-as-mark static image data group KD, a reproduction<br>
(play) list information group PLS, an attribute information<br>
groupCIS , a real information group DS , andetceteras information<br>
ET that is to be recorded into within the data area DA, in the<br>
way in which they have their own divisional regions.<br>
Of those divisional regions, as the general information<br>
GM, there are recorded user interface information UI which is<br>
information that is displayed to the user when reproducing the<br>
information recorded within the data area DA (namely,<br>
information having the user interface function), number of<br>
reproduction lists information NPL which is information that<br>
indicates the total number of reproduction lists recorded within<br>
the data area DA in the way described later, a code number PIN<br>
according to the present invention which is used when having<br>
had display-prohibited a representative picture image<br>
representatively indicating the contents of its corresponding<br>
reproduction list, etc., and etceteras information ETG which<br>
is other information falling under the category of the general<br>
information. Incidentally, regarding this code number PIN,<br>
in case of the first embodiment, the code numbers PIN associated<br>
with all information recorded in the optical disc 1 are recorded<br>
in the interior of the general information GM region.<br>
Next, the menu control information MC is control<br>
information which is used when showing, as a menu, to the user<br>
the representative picture image representative of picture<br>
image information, etc. reproduced according to its<br>
corresponding reproduction list stored within the reproduction<br>
list group PLS region before reproducing it.<br>
Further, as the for-use-as-menu static image data group<br>
MD, the static image data corresponding to the representative<br>
picture image that is menu-displayed according to the menu<br>
control information MG is recorded in units of a reproduction<br>
list. In connection with this, each item of static image data<br>
has added thereto an identification information identifiable<br>
from one another and, when actually reproducing the information<br>
according to the content of the reproduction list, that static<br>
image data that exists every reproduction list is extracted<br>
by using that- identification information as a clue.<br>
Next, the mark control information KC is control<br>
information which, in order to, for example, cause entry of<br>
the code number, is used, for example, when a mark (e.g., an<br>
implication icon IC as later described) for entry of that code<br>
number is shown to the user together with the menu.<br>
Further, as the for-use-as-mark static image data group<br>
KD, there is recorded static image data corresponding to the<br>
marks that are shown according to the mark control information<br>
KC. At this time, as in the case of the representative picture<br>
image, each static image data has added thereto an identification<br>
information identifiable from one another and, when a necessary<br>
mark is shown, a corresponding necessary static image data is<br>
extracted using that identification information as a clue.<br>
Also, as the reproduction (play) list information group<br>
PLS there is recorded a plurality of pieces as illustrated in<br>
Figure 1 the reproduction list PL that is used to control the<br>
manner of reproducing that is executed when reproducing real<br>
information as later described (specifically the manner of<br>
reproducing such as the sequential order of reproducing the<br>
respective real information, which portion of the respective<br>
real information is to be reproduced, the reproduction speed<br>
of the respective real information itself, etc.).<br>
In connection with this, the reproduction lists of two<br>
kinds are recorded. Namely, as the first kind, there are<br>
recorded real reproduction lists RPL1, RPL2 , . . . , each of thar<br>
is in 1 :1 correspondence with the corresponding respective real<br>
information as later described and the number of that is the<br>
same as that of those real information items, and that are used<br>
to reproduce one item of real information in completely the<br>
same manner as that which was executed when that item of real<br>
information was recorded in the optical disc 1. Next, as the<br>
second kind, there are recorded virtual reproduction Lists VPL<br>
that are used to reproduce, as in the case of connecting part<br>
of one item of real information and part of another and<br>
consecutively reproducing them, part of each of a plurality<br>
of real information items in the manner in which those parts<br>
are virtually combined together using their corresponding real<br>
reproduction (play) lists RPL and in the manner in which those<br>
parts go over the divisions each made between each two of the<br>
items of real information. At this time, the number of those<br>
virtual reproduction lists VPL is set in the way to have no<br>
relevancy to the number of the real information items.<br>
Further, within each of the reproduction lists (either<br>
the real reproduction lists RPL or the virtual reproduction<br>
lists VPL) , as illustrated in Figure 1, there are included the<br>
following . Areproduction limit f lagPCF that indicates whether<br>
limiting the reproduction of the real information indicated<br>
by that reproduction list PL (more specifically whether<br>
prohibiting the reproduction of that information with respect<br>
to a person other than those who are specified) , a reproduction<br>
list display limit flag PHF that indicates whether limiting<br>
the presentation with respect to the user of the representative<br>
picture image for use as menu, itself, corresponding to the<br>
real information reproduced according to that reproduction list<br>
?L, for-use-as-menu representative picture image information<br>
SN which is identification information indicating the<br>
representative picture image for use as menu that corresponds<br>
to the reproduction list PL, name information NM that indicates<br>
the name of the real information reproduced according to that<br>
reproduction list PL, gist information GL which is text<br>
information indicating the gist of the real information, and<br>
etceteras information ETP which is other information falling<br>
under the category of the reproduction list PL.<br>
Here, as the etceteras information ETP, specifically,<br>
there are included information indicating the sequential order<br>
of reproduction, address information that indicates the<br>
recording position on the optical disc 1 at which there is<br>
recorded a portion of the real information that is to be<br>
reproduced, information that indicates the reproduction speed<br>
of thatLjreal information, information that indicates the date<br>
on which the reproduction list PL itself was produced,<br>
information that indicates the attribute information as later<br>
described which should be referred to when reproducing, etc.<br>
Also, as the content of the reproduction control flag<br>
PCF, specifically, it is set to "1" when the content of the<br>
real information D that is to be reproduced according to the<br>
reproduction list PL in which is contained that reproduction<br>
control flag PCF is the content with respect to which reproduction<br>
control should be performed such as the one in which the<br>
reproduction with respect to a person other than those who are<br>
specified should be prohibited, and that is set to "0" when<br>
that content is the one which should not be<br>
reproduction-controlled.<br><br>
Further, as the content of the reproduction list display<br>
prohibition flag PHF, specifically, it is set to "1" when the<br>
display of the reproduction list PL in which is contained the<br>
reproduction list display prohibition flag PHF, itself, should<br>
be prohibited on the menu screen as later described, namely,<br>
the display of the representative picture image corresponding<br>
to the reproduction list PL should be prohibited on the menu<br>
screen, and that is set to "0" when the display of the<br>
representative picture image is not prohibited.<br>
Next, as the attribute information group CIS, there are<br>
recorded attribute information items corresponding to the<br>
respective real information items, which are attribute<br>
information items CI1, CI2, CI3, ..., CIn indica-ting the<br>
attributes (kinds) of those respective real information items,<br>
by the number that is the same as that of the real information<br>
items. At this time, as the attributes, specifically, there<br>
are, for example, a genre's name under which the content of<br>
the corresponding real information falls, recording date on<br>
which that real information was recorded, and information<br>
indicating whether that real information is text information,<br>
image information, or voice information. And, these<br>
information items are recorded as the attribute information.<br>
Finally, as the real information group DS, one or multiple<br>
real information items Dl , D2 , D3 , . . . , Dn are recorded as the<br>
information that is to be actually reproduced, together with<br>
identification information identifiable from one another. At<br>
this time, as this real information, for example, a single piece<br>
of film, a single piece of music, etc. is respectively recorded<br>
as one item of real information D.<br>
(B) Embodiments of the construction and operation of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
Next, the construction and operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the first<br>
embodiment which records/reproduces the real information D with<br>
the use of the recording format illustrated in Figure 1 will<br>
be explained using Figures 2 to 10.<br>
First of all, the construction and the entire operation<br>
of the information recording/reproducing apparatus will be<br>
explained using Figure 2. Incidentally, Figure 2 is a block<br>
diagram illustrating the outline construction of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the first<br>
embodiment comprises a pickup 2 serving as a detecting device,<br>
an A/D (Analog/Digital) converter 3, an MPEG (Moving Picture<br>
Coding Expert Group) encoder 4 , multiplexers 5 and 10 , a recording<br>
encoder 6, a recording circuit 7, a reproducing circuit 2, a<br>
reproducing decoder 9, anMPEGdecoder 11 , amenu screen producing<br>
circuit 12, a D/A converter 13, a static image encoder 14, a<br>
buffer 15 , a spindle motor 16 , a CPU 17 serving as a reproduction<br>
information recording device, a control information recording<br>
device, a limiting device, and a prohibiting device, a servo<br>
circuitl8, a display part 19, an operation part 20, and a switch<br>
22.<br>
Further, as illustrated in Figure 3, the menu screen<br>
producing circuit 12 comprises a capture part 23, a scale<br>
reduction changing part 24, a memory 25 , a GUI (Graphical Users<br>
Interface) screen producing part 26, and a synthesizing part<br>
27.<br>
Next, the schematic operation of each of the respective<br>
constituent members will be explained using Figures 1 to 3 .<br>
Initially, an explanation will be given of a case where<br>
information to be recorded from the outside (concretely this<br>
information to be recorded includes both image information and<br>
voice information.) is recorded onto the optical disc 1.<br>
When an information signal Sin corresponding ~o the<br>
information to be recorded is input from the outside and, along<br>
therewith, a recording button not illustrated is operated in<br>
the operation part 20, first, the A/D converter 3 digitizes<br>
that information signal Sin to produce a digital signal Sd and<br>
outputs to the MPEG encoder 4.<br>
And, the MPEG encoder 4, according to a control signal<br>
S7 that is output from the CPU 17, performs compression of the<br>
digital signal Sd that is input on in accordance with the MPEG<br>
2 method, to thereby produce a compression signal Se and outputs<br>
it to the multiplexers 5 and 10.<br>
And, the multiplexer 5, according to a control signal<br>
S5 that is output from the CPU 17, performs, when necessary,<br>
switching between the compression signal Se that is input on<br>
and a buffer signal Sbo as later described to thereby produce<br>
a changeover recording signal Smr and outputs it to the recording<br>
encoder 6.<br>
And, the encoder 6, according to a control signal S3 that<br>
is output from the CPU 17 , executes with respect to the changeover<br>
recording signal Smr that is input on processing for converting<br>
the format of the changeover recording signal Smr into the<br>
recording format illustrated in Fgure 1, the formattingprocess,<br>
to thereby produce a recording encoded signal Sre and outputs<br>
to the recording circuit 7.<br>
At this time, as the formatting process, specifically,<br>
first, according to the control signal S3, when necessary, the<br>
changeover recording signal Smr that is input is output to the<br>
CPU 17 as is. And, the CPU 17, according to the changeover<br>
recording signal Smr, produces the above-described general<br>
information GM, menu control information MC, for-use-as-menu<br>
static image data group MD, mark control information KC,<br>
for-use-as-mark static image data group KD , reproduction (play)<br>
list information group PLS including the respective<br>
reproduction lists PL, attribute information group CIS, real<br>
information group DS , and etceteras information ET and outputs<br><br>
these to the recording encoder 6 as the control signal S3. And,<br>
as a result of this, the recording encoder 6 produces the<br>
recording encoded signal Sre in accordance with the recording<br>
format illustrated in Figure 1 . Incidentally, the information<br>
for production of the above-described virtual reproduction<br>
lists VPL, namely, identification information indicating<br>
respective parts of the relevant real information D that should<br>
fall under the virtual reproduction list VPL, information<br>
indicating the sequential order of reproducing those respective<br>
parts, etc. are input from the operation part 20 during the<br>
formatting process.<br>
Next, the recording circuit 7, according to a control<br>
signal S2 that is output from the CPU 17 , converts the recording<br>
encoded signal Sre into a recording signal Sr for use for<br>
recording and outputs the resulting signal to the pickup 2.<br>
At this time, in the recording circuit 7, the "Write Strategy"<br>
processing, etc. are executed with respect to the recording<br>
encoded signal Sre so as to form in the optical disc 1 the pits<br>
the configuration of which accurately corresponds to the<br>
information that is to be recorded.<br>
Thereafter, the pickup 2, according to the recording<br>
signal Sr that is output from the recording circuit 7, drives<br>
a light source not illustrated, such as a semiconductor laser,<br>
within this pickup 2 to thereby produce a light beam B such<br>
as laser light and radiate it onto the information recording<br>
surface of the optical disc 1 and thereby form the pits<br>
corresponding to the recording signal and thereby record this<br>
recording signal Sr on the optical disc 1. At this time, the<br>
optical disc 1 is rotated in a prescribed number of rotations<br>
by a spindle motor 16 that is driven according to a spindle<br>
control signal Ssm as later described. Incidentally, on the<br>
optical disc 1, for example, pits corresponding to the recording<br>
signal Sr are formed in accordance with the phase change method,<br>
whereby this recording signal Sr is recorded.<br>
On the other hand, the above-described compression signal<br>
Se that is output to the multiplexer 10 passes through this<br>
multiplexer 10 and is output as a reproduction changeover signal<br>
Smp to the MPEG decoder 11.<br>
And, the MPEG decoder 11, according to a control signal<br>
S9 that is output from the CPU 17 , executes expansion processing<br>
with respect to the reproduction changeover signal Smp that<br>
is input on (at the time of recording information the compression<br>
signal Se itself) in accordance with the MPEG 2 method, and<br>
outputs the resulting signal to themenu screen producing circuit<br>
12 , static image encoder 14 , and one input terminal of the switch<br>
22, as a decoded signal Sdc.<br>
Next, tne static image encoder 14, according co a control<br>
signal Sn that is output from the CPU 17, encodes, as a static<br>
image, the image that has been selected, for being made a<br>
representative picture image within the menu screen through<br>
the execution of a process as later described, from the image<br>
information contained in the decoded signal Sdc that is input<br>
on . And the static image encoder 14 outputs the resulting signal<br>
to the buffer 15 as a static image encoded signal Sse.<br>
As a result of this, the buffer 15, according to a control<br>
signal S8 that is output from the CPU 17, temporarily stores<br>
the static image encoded signal Sse and reads it out and outputs<br>
to the multiplexer 5 as the buffer signal Sbo.<br>
On the other hand, at the time of information recording,<br>
the switch 22 is changed over to the decoded signal Sdc side<br>
according to a control signal S13 that is output from the CPU<br>
17.<br>
And, the decoded signal Sdc is output from the switch<br>
22 to the D/A converter 13 as a changeover signal Sch.<br>
Next, the D/A—converter 13 makes the changeover signal<br>
Sch analog to produce an output signal Sout corresponding to<br>
the information signal Sin and thereby to output it to a later<br>
described monitor outside, speaker, not illustrated, outside,<br>
etc.<br>
At this time, when recognizing that the recording button<br>
not illustrated in the operation part 20 has been operated<br>
according to a command signal Sc from that operation par- 20,<br>
the CPU 17 produces the above-desCribed respective control<br>
signals S2, S3, S5, S7, S8, Su, and Sl3 and outputs these signals<br>
to the above-described respective constituent members to<br>
thereby control the above-described respective operations for<br>
recording.<br>
Through the performance of the above-explained series<br>
of operations at the time of information recording, the image<br>
or voice, which corresponds to the recording signal Sr that<br>
is presently being recorded, can be recorded while monitoring<br>
it on a real-time basis. It is to be noted that at this time<br>
information recording the menu screen producing circuit 12 is<br>
left out of operation.<br>
Next, the operation that is performed when reproducing<br>
the information that is recorded on the optical disc 1 will<br>
be explained.<br>
At the time of information reproduction, first, when in<br>
the operation part 20 a reproduction button therein that is<br>
not illustrated is operated, the pickup 2 radiates a reproduction<br>
light beamB onto the optical disc 1 that is rotating andproduces ,<br>
according to that reflected light, a detection signal Sp<br>
corresponding to the pit formed in the optical disc 1 , and outputs<br>
it to the reproducing circuit 8.<br>
Next, the reproducing circuit 8, according to a control<br>
signal S1 that is output from the CPU 17 , amplifies the detection<br>
signal Sp that has been output, with a prescrioed amplification<br>
factor, and performs reshaping of that waveform to thereby<br>
produce a reproduction signal Spp and outputs it to the<br>
reproducing decoder 9.<br>
And, the reproducing decoder 9, according to a control<br>
signal S4 that is output from the CPU 17, executes unformatting<br>
process, which corresponds to the formatting process in the<br>
recording encoder 6, with respect to the reproduction signal<br>
Spp that is input on, to thereby produce a reproduction decoded<br>
signal Spd and outputs it to the multiplexer 10.<br>
Next, the multiplexer 10, according to a control signal<br>
S6 that is output from the CPU 17 , causes the reproduction decoded<br>
signal Spd that is input on to pass there through and outputs<br>
it to the MPEG decoder 11 as the reproduction changeover signal<br>
Smp.<br>
And, the MPEG decoder 11, according to a control signal<br>
S9 that is output from the CPU 17, executes the above-described<br>
expansion processing with respect to the reproduction<br>
changeover signal Smp that is input on, to thereby produce the<br>
decoded signal Sdc. Then, it outputs the decoded signal Sdc<br>
to the menu screen producing circuit 12 and one input terminal<br>
of the switch 22.<br>
As a result of this, the menu screen producing circuit<br>
12, according to a control signal S12 that is output from the<br>
CPU 17 , using an image that is designated from within the decoded<br>
signal Sdc that is input on by that control signal S12, produces<br>
a menu screen (including therein the above-described<br>
representative picture image) for selecting which reproduction<br>
list PL the real information D should be reproduced in accordance<br>
. 36<br>
with when reproducing information. And, it outputs the<br>
resulting signal to the other input terminal of the switch 22<br>
as a menu signal Smy.<br>
And, the switch 22 , according to a control signal S13 that<br>
is output from the CPU 17 , performs switching between the menu<br>
signal Smy that is input on and the decoded signal Sdc and outputs<br>
to the D/A converter 13 as the changeover signal Sch.<br>
As a result of this, the D/A converter 13 makes analog<br>
the changeover signal Sch and produces an output signal<br>
containing therein either one of the information signal Sin<br>
and the menu screen signal corresponding to the menu signal<br>
Smy and outputsit to a later described monitor outside, speaker,<br>
not illustrated, outside, etc.<br>
At this time," the CPU 17, when recognizing according to<br>
a command signal Sc from the operation part 20 that a reproduction<br>
buttonnot illustrated in that operationpart 20 has been operated,<br>
produces the above-described control signals S1, S4, S6, S9,<br>
S12, and S13 and outputs them to the above-described relevant<br>
constituent members to thereby control the above-described<br>
respective operations for reproduction.<br>
In parallel with those respective information recording<br>
or information reproducing operations, the CPU 17 produces a<br>
control signal S.s for performing servo control of the spindle<br>
motor 16 and pickup 2 and outputs it to the servo circuit id.<br>
The servo circuit 1 8 , according to the control signal Ss , produces<br>
a spindle control signal Ssm for controlling the rotation of<br>
the spindle motor 16 and outputs it to the spindle motor 16.<br>
On the other hand, the servo circuit 18 produces, according<br>
to that control signal Ss, a pickup control signal Ssp for<br>
performing the "tracking servo control" and "focus servo<br>
control" in the pickup 2 and outputs it to the pickup 2. And,<br>
according to that pickup control signal Ssp, the pickup 2 performs<br>
recording of the recording signal Sr or detection of the detection<br>
signal Sp while performing tracking servo control and focus<br>
servo control with respect to the light beam B.<br>
Incidentally, the information that is needed in order<br>
for the user to control the above-described operation of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus S is displayed on<br>
the display part 19 according to a display signal Sdp from the<br>
CPU 17.<br>
Next, the operation of the respective constituent member<br>
within the menu screen producing circuit 12 when reproducing<br>
information will be explained using Figure 3.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, the capture part 23 within<br>
the menu screen producing circuit 12 , according to a control<br>
signal S14 contained in the above-described control signal S12<br>
that is output from the CPU 17 . temporarily stores therein, that<br>
signal of the decoded signal Sdc input on which corresponds<br>
to the above-aescribed representative picture image used for<br>
constructing the menu screen, and outputs it to the scale<br>
reduction changing part 24 as a capture signal Sep.<br>
And, the scale reduction changing part 24 changes the<br>
image contained in the capture signal Scp into a reduced scale<br>
that is necessary for constructing the menu screen, and outputs<br>
the resulting signal to the memory 25 as a scale reduction signal<br>
Sex.<br>
Thereafter, the memory 25, after temporarily storing<br>
therein the scale reduction signal Sex, outputs it to the<br>
synthesizing part 27.<br>
On the other hand, the GUI screen producing part 26,<br>
according to a control signal S15 contained in the<br>
above-described control signal S12, produces an image (the "an<br>
icon", etc.) , other than the image contained in the scale<br>
reduction signal Sex, that is necessary for constructing the<br>
menu screen, and outputs that signal to the synthesized part<br>
27 as an image signal Sg.<br>
And, the synthesizing part 27, according to a control<br>
signal Su contained in the above-described control signal S12,<br>
produces a menu screen signal by using the scale reduction signal<br>
Sex, image signal Sg, and decoded signal Sdc and outputs it<br>
to the switch 22 as the above-described menu signal Smy.<br>
Next, che concrete operation that is performed vher.<br>
recording the real information D, etc. onto the optical disc<br>
1 through the operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S having the above-described<br>
construction and in accordance with the recording format<br>
illustrated in Figure 1 will be explained using Figure 4.<br>
Incidentally, Figure 4 is a flow chart illustrating the recording<br>
process of the real information D according to the first<br>
embodiment which is executed, mainly, according to and from<br>
the CPU 17.<br>
In this recording process, initially, it is confirmed<br>
whether, in the operation part 20, the start of the recording<br>
process has been instructedby a recordingbutton not illustrated<br>
(step SI). When the start of the recording process is not<br>
instructed (step SI: NO), then, in the operation part 20, it<br>
is confirmed whether in the operation part 20 an ending button<br>
not illustrated (concretely the power source "of f" button, etc.)<br>
that indicates the termination of the recording process has<br>
been operated (step S13) . And, when the ending button is<br>
operated (step S13: YES), the recording process according to<br>
the first embodiment is terminated as is while, on the other<br>
hand, when the ending button is not operated either (step S13:<br>
NO), the flow returns to the step SI and the CPU 17 waits as<br>
is .<br>
On the other hand, when the start of the recording operation<br>
has been instructed (step 51: YES) , next, recording onto the<br>
optical disc 1 of the real information that is input on as the<br>
above-described information signal Sin is performed (step S2) .<br>
And, it is confirmed whether recording of all real information<br><br>
D has been terminated (step S3) and, when not terminated (step<br>
S3: NO), the recording process goes on being executed as is<br>
(step S2) . When having been terminated (step S3: YES) , next,<br>
the attribute information CI corresponding to the respective<br>
real information D that has been recorded is produced and,<br>
together therewith, corresponding reproduction list PL is also<br>
similarly produced. Then, the attribute information CI and<br>
reproduction list PL that have been produced are recorded onto<br>
the optical disc 1 in accordance with the recording format<br>
illustrated in Figure 1 (step S4).<br>
Next, it is confirmed according to the content of the<br>
operation in the operation part 20 whether the content of the<br>
real information D that is reproduced according to the produced<br>
reproduction list PL is the one with respect to which there<br>
should be performed reproduction control such as, for example,<br>
prohibiting the reproduction with respect to a person other<br>
than specified users (step S5) . When that content is not the<br>
one with respect to which no reproduction control should be<br>
performed (step S5: NO), the recording process according to<br>
the first embodiment is terminated as is. When, on the other<br>
hand, that content is the one with respect to which reproduction<br>
control should be performed (step S5: YES), it is confirmed<br>
(step S6), by searching the general information GM region,<br>
whether the code number PIN is already reco rded within the genera 1<br>
information GM of the optical disc I having had recorded therein<br>
the real information D and reproduction list PL (steps S2 and<br>
S4) . And, when the code number PIN is not recorded (step S6:<br>
NO) , a display indicating that a code number PIN should newly<br>
be entered is made on the display not illustrated, etc. to thereby<br>
prompt the user to do entry processing. When a new code number<br>
PIN has been entered correspondingly thereto (step S7) , this<br>
entered code number PIN is recorded in the region illustrated<br>
in Figure 1 within the general information GM (step S8) , then<br>
the flow proceeds to the succeeding step S9.<br>
On the other hand, when in the determination made in the<br>
step S6 the code number PIN is already recorded (step S6 : YES) ,<br>
next, it is confirmed (stepS9) , according to theoperatedcontent<br>
of the operation part 20, whether the display of the produced<br>
(step S4) reproduction list PL itself should be prohibited on<br>
the menu screen, namely whether the display of the representative<br>
picture image corresponding to that reproduction list PL should<br>
be prohibited on the menu screen. When the display of that<br>
representative picture image should not be prohibited (step<br>
S9 : NO) , according to the determination of the step S5 the content<br>
of the reproduction control flag PCF that should be included<br>
under the corresponding reproduction list PL is set to ul",<br>
and, simultaneously, che content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF that should similarly be included<br>
under that list PL is set to "0" (step S12).<br>
On the other hand, when the display of that representative<br>
picture image is the one which should be prohibited (step S9 :<br>
YES) , according to the determination made in the step S5 the<br>
content of the reproduction control flag PCF that should be<br>
included under the corresponding reproduction list PL is set<br>
to "1". Simultaneously, the content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF that should similarly be included<br>
thereunder is set to "1" (step S10).<br>
And, at the point in time when setting the content of<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF and the content, of the<br>
reproduction list display flag PHF has respectively finished<br>
being performed (steps S10 and S12) , the content of the<br>
corresponding reproduction list PL that was recorded (step S4)<br>
is rewritten (step Sll) , thereby the series of processing<br>
operations for the recording process are terminated.<br>
Next, the concrete operation of the editing process for<br>
editing the real information D, etc. that is executed in<br>
accordance with the recording format illustrated in Figure 1<br>
through the operation of the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S having the above-described construction will be<br>
explained using Figure 5. Incidentally, Figure 5 is a flow<br>
chart illustrating the editing process for the real information<br>
D according to che first embodiment that is executed, mainly,<br>
according to and from the CPU 17. Also, this editing process,<br>
concretely, includes processing for producing a new virtual<br>
reproduction list VPL, processing for adding/recording new real<br>
information D, processing for changing the content of an existing<br>
virtual reproduction list VPL, processing for deleting part<br>
of existing real information D from the optical disc 1, etc.<br>
In this editing process, initially, while they are being<br>
subjected to control processing such as prohibiting their<br>
display through the execution of the processes as later described<br>
in detail, the representative picture image corresponding to<br>
the respective reproduction list PL recorded on the optical<br>
disc 1 is displayed on the display not illustrated (step S40) ,<br>
and, further, by selecting a desired one from among the<br>
representative picture images that are being displayed, there<br>
is selected a reproduction list PL that is to be edited (step<br>
S41) .<br>
When the reproduction list PI is selected, next, whether<br>
the real information D corresponding to the selected<br>
reproduction list PL is the one with respect to which the<br>
above-described reproduction control should be performed is<br>
determinedby confirming the content of the reproduction control<br>
flag PCF within the selected reproduction list (step S42) . And,<br>
when that real information D is not the one which should be<br>
reproduction-controlled (step S42: NO) , the flow proceeds to<br>
a step S46 as later described as is. On the other hand, when<br>
that reproduction list PI is the one which should be<br>
reproduction-controlled (step S42: YES), next, whether the<br>
representative picture image corresponding to the reproduction<br>
list PL has its display prohibited on the menu screen is<br>
determined by confirming the content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF within the selected reproduction<br>
listPL (stepS43) . And, for releasing that display prohibition ,<br>
the display indicating that the code number PIN, which must<br>
have been recorded in the optical disc 1, should be entered<br>
is made, for example, on the display not illustrated, etc.,<br>
to thereby prompt the execution of that entry processing. When<br>
correspondingly thereto a new code number PIN has been entered<br>
(step S44) , collation is made between this entered code number<br>
PIN and the code number PIN that is kept recorded in the general<br>
information GM region, thereby confirmation is made of whether<br>
those code numbers coincide with each other (step S45) . As<br>
a result of this, when the both do not coincide with each other<br>
(step S45 : NO) , determination is made of that the user who should<br>
not view that representative picture image is presently<br>
executing the editing process, the flow then returning to the<br>
step S41 as is, and the CPU 17 makes the user select a different<br>
reproduction list PL. On the other hand, when the entered code<br>
number PIN and the code number PIN kept recorded coincide with<br>
each other (step S45: YES), next, the desired editing process<br>
is executed (step S46) while that selected reproduction list<br>
PL is being displayed.<br>
Next, whetner the operation to tne effect tnat the editing<br>
process has finished being executed has been performed in the<br>
operation part 20 is confirmed (step S47) . When having not<br>
finished (step S47: NO), the editing process goes on being<br>
executed as is . When, on the other hand, having already finished<br>
(step S47: YES), whether the content of the real information<br>
D that is to be reproduced accord ing to the post-edit reproduction<br>
list PL is the one with respect to which reproduction control<br>
should be performed is determined according to the content of<br>
the operation in the operation part 20 (step S48) . When that<br>
content is not the one with respect to which reproduction control<br>
should be performed (step S48: NO) , the reproduction control<br>
flag PCF in the newly produced reproduction list PL is set to<br>
"0" and simultaneously the reproduction list display<br>
prohibition flag PHF is set to "0" (step S49), and the flow<br>
proceeds to the processing of a step S56 as later described.<br>
On the other hand , when the content of the real information<br>
Dthatistobe reproduced according to the post-edit reproduction<br>
list PL is the one which should be reproduction-controlled (step<br>
S48 : YES) , next, whether the code number PIN is already recorded<br>
within the general information GM region of the optical disc<br>
1 in which the post-edit reproduction list PL was recorded (step<br>
S4 6) is confirmed by searching that general inf ormat ion GM region<br>
(step S50) . And, when the code number PIN is not recorded (step<br>
S50 : NO) , the display indicating that the code number PIN should<br>
be newly entered is made, for example, on tne display net<br>
illustrated , etc . , to thereby prompt the execution of that entry<br>
processing. When correspondingly thereto a new code number<br>
PIN has been entered (step S51) , this entered code number PIN<br>
is recorded into the zone illustrated in Figure 1 within the<br>
general information GM region (step S52) , and the flow proceeds<br>
to the succeeding step S53.<br>
On the other hand, when in the determination of the step<br>
S50 the code number PIN is already recorded (step S50: YES),<br>
next, whether the display of the representative picture image<br>
corresponding to the produced (step S46) reproduction list PL<br>
is the one which should be prohibited in the relevant menu screen<br>
is confirmed (step S53) according to the content of the operation<br>
in the operation part 20. And when that display of the<br>
representative picture image is not the one which should be<br>
prohibited (step S53: NO), the content of the reproduction<br>
control flag PCF that should be included under the corresponding<br>
reproduction (play) list PL is set to "1" according to the<br>
determination in the step S48 and, simultaneously, the content<br>
of the reproduction list display prohibition flag PHF that should<br>
similarly be included thereunder is set to "0" (step S55) .<br>
On the other hand, when the display of that representative<br>
image is the one which should be prohibited (step S53: YES),<br>
the content of the reproduction control flag PCF that should<br>
be included under the corresponding reproduction (play) list<br>
PL is set to "1" according to the determination in the step<br>
S48 and, simultaneously, the content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF that should similarly be included<br>
thereunder is set to "1" (step S54).<br>
And, at the point in time when setting the content of<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF and the content of the<br>
reproduction list display flag PHF has respectively finished<br>
being performed (steps 49 and 55) , the content of the<br>
corresponding reproduction list PL that was recorded (step S46)<br>
is rewritten (step S56), thereby the series of processing<br>
operations for the editing process are terminated.<br>
Next, the detail of the display process (step S40) for<br>
the representative image corresponding to the reproduction list<br>
PL in the above-described editing process will be explained<br>
using Figures 6 and 7. Incidentally, Figure 6 is a flow chart<br>
illustrating the display process for a reproduction list<br>
according to the first embodiment, and Figure 7 is a view<br>
illustrating an example of display of a reproduction list<br>
according to the first embodiment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 6, in the display process for<br>
the representative picture image in the step S40, first, the<br>
optical disc 1 is inserted (step S15) into an insertion opening<br>
not illustrated for this optical disc 1 in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus 3, and all reproduction lis:s<br>
PL recorded in the thus-inserted optical disc 1 are detected<br>
(step S16) .<br>
And, regarding the respective reproduction list PL<br>
detected, whether their corresponding representative picture<br>
image is set to be display-prohibited on the menu screen is<br>
determined by confirming the content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF in the respective reproduction<br>
list PL (step S17) .<br>
And, when that representative picture image is not<br>
display-prohibited (step S17: NO), the corresponding<br>
representative picture image is displayed, as indicated by the<br>
symbol SI, within the menu screen M illustrated in , for example ,<br>
Figure 7A and, in addition, according to the necessity, the<br>
reproduction list information such as the name, production date ,<br>
etc. of the reproduction list PL itself is displayedby searching<br>
the interior of this reproduction list PL (step S19) , then the<br>
flow proceeds to a step S20.<br>
On the other hand, when in the determination of the step<br>
S17 the corresponding representative picture image is<br>
display-prohibited (step S17: YES), the corresponding<br>
representative picture image is displayed, for example, in such<br>
a manner as to make an illustration of it within the menu screen<br>
of Figure 7A as a for-non-display image SSI, so that the content<br>
of that representative picture image cannot be recognized . And ,<br>
in addition , the above-described reoroduccion list information<br>
is not displayed (step S18).<br>
And, whether display processing has finished being<br>
 executed up to the representative picture? image corresponding<br>
to a final reproduction list PL is confirmed (step S20) . When<br>
that has not finished being executed (step S20: NO), the flow<br>
returns to the step S16, thereby the above-described steps of<br>
processing operations are repeated again. On the other hand,<br>
when that has already finished being executed (step S20: NO)<br>
up to the display of the representative picture image<br>
corresponding to the final reproduction list PL, the flow<br>
proceeds to step S41 as is.<br>
Incidentally, in the display process illustrated in<br>
Figure 6, regarding the representative picture image the display<br>
of that is prohibited, in place of that representative picture<br>
image, measure has been taken of displaying the f or-non-display<br>
image SSI illustrated in Figure 7A. However, other than this,<br>
regarding the reproduction list PL the corresponding<br>
representative picture image to which is display-prohibited,<br>
measure may also be taken of making no display of any images<br>
at the corresponding position as illustrated in Figure 8 (see<br>
Figure 9A) and of only displaying the representative picture<br>
image SI the display of which is permitted (step S19) . At this<br>
time, as illustrated in Figure 9A, at a part of the interior<br>
of the menu screen M, an implication icon IC that implies the<br>
existance of the representative cicturs imaage (reproduction<br>
list PL) the display of which is prohibited may be displayed<br>
together with the representative picture image SI tne display<br>
of which is permitted.<br>
Next, the detail of the selection processing (step S41)<br>
of the reproduction list PL in the above-described editing<br>
process will be explainedusingFigure 10 . Incidentally, Figure<br>
10 is a flow chart illustrating the selection process of the<br>
reproduction list according to the first embodiment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 10, in the selection process<br>
of the reproduction list PL that is executed in the<br>
above-described step S41, first, when the menu screen M<br>
illustrated in Figure 7 is displayed by the execution of the<br>
above-described step S40, next, the processing for selecting<br>
the reproduction list PL in that menu screen M is executed in<br>
the operation part 20 (step S25) , next, it is determined whether<br>
that reproduction list PL that has been selected is the one<br>
the corresponding representative picture image of that is<br>
display-prohibited (step S26) .<br>
And, in a case where the reproduction list PL the<br>
representative picture image SI of that is not<br>
display-prohibited has been selected (step S26: NO) , the flow<br>
proceeds to the step S42 as is. On the other hand, in a case<br>
where the reproduction list PL the representative picture image<br>
SI of that is display-prohibited has been selected (step S26:<br>
YES) , then, for releasing the prohibition of that display, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 7B, a field PT for entry that indicates<br>
that the code number PIN which must have been recorded in tne<br>
optical disc 1 is to be entered is displayed on the menu screen<br>
M to thereby prompt the execution of the entry processing. When<br>
correspondingly thereto that code number PIN has been entered<br>
(step S27) , collation is made between that entered code numcer<br>
PIN and the code number PIN recorded in the general information<br>
GM region, and it is confirmed whether those code numbers coincide<br>
with each other (step S28) . As a result of this, when the both<br>
do not coincide (step S28: NO) , it is determined that the user<br>
who should not view that representative picture image is<br>
presently executing the edit process . Thereby, the flow returns<br>
to the step S25 to thereby cause the user to select a different<br>
reproduction list PL. On the other hand, when the input code<br>
number PIN and the recorded code number PIN have coincided with<br>
each other (step S28: YES), then as illustrated-in Figure 7c<br>
a corresponding representative picture image SI is newly<br>
displayed within the menu screen M. And, in addition, the<br>
reproduction list information such as the name , production date ,<br>
etc. of the reproduction list PL itself is displayed, according<br>
to the necessity, by searching the interior of that reproduction<br>
list PL (step S29) . Then, the flow proceeds to ~he<br>
above-described step S42.<br>
Incidentally, in the above-described selection process<br>
of the reproduction list PL, in a case where regarding the<br>
representative picture image SI that is determined as being<br>
display-prohibited as illustrated in Figure 8 no display<br>
whatsoever is made (step S40) , as illustrated in Figure 9A the<br>
implication icon is left displayed. And, when in this state<br>
that implication icon IC has been selected (step S25), for<br>
releasing that prohibition of the display the CPU 17 prompts,<br>
as illustrated in Figure 9B, the execution of the en try processing<br>
for the code number PIN by displaying the entry field PT on<br>
themenu screenM. When correspondingly to this that code number<br>
PIN is entered (step S27) and it has coincided with the code<br>
number PIN recorded within the general information GM (step<br>
S28: YES) , as illustrated in Figure 9C the corresponding<br>
representative picture image SI is newly displayed within the<br>
menu screenM and, in addition, the implication icon IC is deleted<br>
from within the menu screen. And, in addition, according to<br>
the necessity, the reproduction list information such as the<br>
name, production date, etc. of the reproduction list PL itself<br>
is displayed by searching the interior of that reproduction<br>
list (step S29). Then, the flow proceeds to the step S42.<br>
Finally, the concrete operation of the reproduction<br>
process for reproducing the real information D, etc. from the<br>
optical disc 1 , which is executed in accordance with the recording<br>
format illustrated in Figure 1 by the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S having the above-described<br>
construction will be explained using Figure 11 . Incidentally,<br>
Figure 11 is a flow chart illustrating the reproduction process<br>
for the real information D according to the first embodiment<br>
which is executed mainly according to and from the CPU 17.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 11, as the reproduction process ,<br>
first, the display processing for reproduction list PL (step<br>
S60) and the selection processing therefor (step S61) which<br>
are the same as those executed in the editing process illustrated<br>
in Figure 5 are executed.<br>
And, when the display processing and selection processing<br>
for the reproduction list PL having the contents that are to<br>
be reproduced has finished being executed, next, whether the<br>
content of the real information D that is reproduced according<br>
to the selected reproduction list PL is the one with respect<br>
to which reproduction control should be performed is determined<br>
(step S62) by confirming the content of the reproduction control<br>
flag PCF within that selected reproduction list PL. When that<br>
content is not the one with respect to which reproduction control<br>
should be performed (step S62: NO), according to the content<br>
of this selected reproduction list PL the corresponding real<br>
information D is reproduced, as is, from the optical disc 1<br>
(step S66) . Further, whether reproduction up to final real<br>
information D thar is to be reproduced has finished being<br>
performed is confirmed (step S67).<br>
And, when reproduction processing up to the final<br>
reproduction list PL has not finished being executed yet step<br>
S67: NO), the flow returns to the preceding step S60 so as to<br>
select the next reproduction last PL including therein the real<br>
information D to be reproduced. On the other hand, when<br>
reproduction processing has already finished being executed<br>
up to the final reproduction list PL to be reproduced (step<br>
S67: YES), the reproduction process according to the first<br>
embodiment is ended as is.<br>
On the other hand, when in the determination of the step<br>
S62 the content of the selected reproduction list PL is the<br>
one with respect to which reproduction control should be<br>
performed (step S62: YES), next, it is determined whether the<br>
selected reproduction list PL is the one PL the corresponding<br>
representative picture image of which is display-prohibited<br>
(step S63) .<br>
And, when that reproduction list PL is the one PL the<br>
representative picture image of which is not determined as being<br>
display-prohibited (step S63: NO), the flow proceeds to the<br>
step S66 as is. On the other hand, when that reproduction list<br>
PL is the one the representative picture image of which is<br>
determined as being display-prohibited (step S63 : YES) , next,<br>
for releasing that prohibition of the display, as illustrated<br>
in Figure 7B for example, the field PT for entry that indicates<br>
that the code number PIN which must have been recorded in the<br>
optical disc 1 is to be entered is displayed on the menu screen<br>
M to thereby prompt the execution of the entry processing . When<br>
correspondingly thereto that code number PIN has been entered<br>
(step S64) , collation is made between that entered code number<br>
PIN and the code number PIN recorded in the general information<br><br>
GM region, and it is confirmed whether those code numbers coincide<br>
with each other (step S65) . As a result of this, when the both<br>
do not coincide (step S65: NO) , it is determined that the user<br>
who should not view that representative picture image is<br>
presentlyexecuting theedit process . Thereby, the flow returns<br>
to the step S60 to thereby cause the user to select a different<br>
reproduction list PL. On the other hand, when the input code<br>
number PIN and the recorded code number PIN have coincided with<br>
each other (step S65: YES) , then for reproducing the real<br>
information D corresponding to the content of the reproduction<br>
list PL the flow proceeds to the above-described steps S66 and<br>
S67, thereby the CPU 17 irminates the reproduction process<br>
according to the first embodiment.<br>
As has been explained above, according to the operation<br>
of the information rexrording/reproducing apparatus of the first<br>
embodiment, by limiting (prohibiting) the display of the<br>
representative picture image according to the reproduction list:<br>
display prohibition flat PHF that is recorded, it is possible<br>
to control the display of the representative picture image<br>
according to the content, of the reproduction list PL . Therefore<br>
it is possible to prevent the content of the real information<br>
D corresponding to the reproduction list PL. from being<br>
inadvertently recognized by the user as a result of the<br>
inadvertent presentation of the representative picture image<br>
to the user.<br><br>
Also, since the representative picture image is displayed<br>
before starting the reproduction process for the real<br>
information D corresponding to the reproduction list PL, by<br>
limiting the display of the representative picture image<br>
according to the reproduction list display prohibition flag<br>
PHF that is recorded it is possible to control the display of<br>
the representative picture image that precedes the reproduction<br>
process for the real information D corresponding to the<br>
reproduction list PL.<br>
(II) Second embodiment<br>
Next, a second embodiment that is another embodiment<br>
according to the present invention will be explained using<br>
Figures 12 to 15.<br>
Although in the above-described first embodiment the code<br>
number PIN has been recorded, within the general information<br>
GM, as the code number that is common to every item of the real<br>
information D and every piece of the reproduction lists PL,<br>
in the second embodiment that will be explained below a specific<br>
code number is set every reproduction list PL.<br>
Incidentally, in Figures 12 to 15 that will be explained<br>
below, the same members as those in the corresponding figures<br>
used in the first embodiment are denoted by the same member<br>
numerals and the explanation of the"' detail thereof will be<br>
omitted.<br>
Also, since the construction of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the second<br>
embodiment is the same as that of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the first<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, the explanationof the detail<br>
will be omitted.<br>
(A) Embodiment of the recording format<br>
Initially, before concretely explaining the construction,<br>
etc. of the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the second embodiment, the recording format used<br>
when recording information with respect to the optical disc<br>
1 by the information recording/reproducing apparatus according<br>
to the second embodiment will be explained using Figure 12.<br>
Incidentally, Figure 12 is a view illustrating the recording<br>
format (physical format) of the respective information<br>
according to the second embodiment.<br>
As stated above, since in the recording format of the<br>
second embodiment a specific code number is set correspondingly<br>
to each reproduction list PL, that code number is recorded not<br>
within the general information GM but within the respective<br>
reproduction list PL.<br>
Namely, as illustrated in Figure 12, in the recording<br>
format according to the second embodiment. the general<br>
information GM is constructed of only the user interface<br>
information UI, reproduction lists number information NFL, and<br>
etceteras information ETG that are the same as those illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. On the other hand, the respective reproduction<br>
list PL region has recorded therein a code number PPN different<br>
every reproduction list PL in addition to the reproduction<br>
control flag PCF, reproduction list display prohibition flag<br>
PHF, for-use-as-menu representative picture image information<br>
SN, name information NM, gist information GL, and etcetera<br>
information ETP that are the same as those illustrated in Figure<br>
1.<br>
Incidentally, the other construction of the recording<br>
format of the second embodiment is the same as the corresponding<br>
that of the recording format of the first embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figure 1 and therefore the explanation of the detail thereof<br>
will be omitted.<br>
(B) Embodiment of the construction and operation of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
Next, the operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be explained using<br>
Figure 13 no 15.<br>
First, the recording process for the real information<br>
D according to the second embodiment will be explained using<br>
FIG. 13.<br>
Incidentally, Figure 13 is a flowchart illustrating this<br>
recording process. Also, in Figure ij, tne same processing<br>
operations as those in the recording process in the first<br><br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 4 are denoted by the same step<br>
numbers, and the explanation of the detail of that will be<br>
omitted.<br>
In the recording process of the second embodiment, first,<br>
the processing operations in the steps SI, S2, S3, S4, S5, S7,<br>
and S9 are executed, thereby the recording processing of<br>
necessary real information D and the production/recording<br>
processing of necessary reproduction list PL and attribute<br>
information CI are executed. At this time, the operations of<br>
processing (steps S6 and S8) regarding the code number PIN within<br>
the general information GM such as those executed in the case<br>
of the first embodiment are not executed. Also, it results<br>
that the code number that is entered in the step S7 is the code<br>
number PPN that corresponds to only the reproduction list PL<br>
that has become an object with respect to which that code number<br>
should at that time be entered.<br>
And, when, in the determination of the step S9 , the display<br>
of the representative picture image is determined as being not<br>
the one which should be prohibited (step S9: NO) , the content<br>
of the reproduction control flag PCF that should be included<br>
under the corresponding reproduction list PL is set to "1"<br>
according to the determination in the step S5, ^ue content of<br>
the reproduction list display prohibition flag PKF that should<br>
similarly be included thereunder is set to "0" , and , in addition,<br>
the above-described code number PPN (that is already entered<br><br>
in the step S7) that corresponds to only the reproduction list<br>
PL is set (step S31) .<br>
On the other hand, when the display of the representative<br>
picture image is the one which should be prohibited (step S9:<br>
YES), the content of the reproduction control flag PCF that<br>
should be included under the corresponding reproduction list<br>
PL is set to "1" according to the determination in the step<br>
S5, the content of the reproduction list display prohibition<br>
flag PHF that should similarly be included thereunder is set<br>
to "1", and, in addition, the above-described code number PPN<br>
that corresponds to only the reproduction list PL is set (step<br>
S30) .<br>
And, at the point in time when the content of the<br>
reproduction control flag PCF, the content of the reproduction<br>
list display prohibition flag PHF, and the code number have<br>
respectively finished being set (steps S30 and S31), there is<br>
rewritten (step Sll) the content of the corresponding<br>
reproduction list PL that was theretofore recorded (step S4) ,<br>
thereby the series of operations for the recording process is<br>
terminated.<br>
Next, the editing process for the real information D,<br>
etc. according to the second embodiment will be explained using<br>
Figure 14. Incidentally, this editfing process includes<br>
processing for producing a new virtual reproduction list VPL,<br>
processing for adding/recording new real information D,<br><br>
processing for changing the content of an existing virtual<br>
reproduction list VPL, processing for deleting part of existing<br>
real information D from the optical disc 1, etc.<br>
Also, Figure 14 is a flow chart illustrating this editing<br>
process. Here, in Figure 14, regarding the processing<br>
operations that are the same as those executed in the editing<br>
process of the first embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, they<br>
are denoted by the same step numbers and the explanation of<br>
the detail of those is omitted.<br>
In the editing process of the second embodiment, first,<br>
the processing operations in the steps S40 to S48 illustrated<br>
in Figure 5 are executed, thereby necessary editing processing<br>
operations with respect to the desired reproduction list PL<br>
are executed.<br>
And, when, in the determination in the step S48 , the content<br>
of the real information D that is to be reproduced according<br>
to the post-edit reproduction list PL is not the one with respect<br>
to which reproduction control should be performed (step S48:<br>
NO), the reproduction control flag PCF in the newly produced<br>
reproduction list PL is set to "0" and simultaneously the<br>
reproduction list display prohibition flag PHF is set to "0"<br>
(step S49), and, further, setting of the corresponding code<br>
number PPN is not performed (step S3 5 ) . Then , the f low proceeds<br>
;o the processing of a step S56 as later described.<br>
On the other hand, when the content of the real information<br>
D that is to be reproduced according to the post-edit reproduction<br>
list PL is the one which should be reproduction-controlled (step<br>
S48: YES) , next, the display indicating that the code number<br>
PPN corresponding to only the post-edit reproduction list PL<br>
should be entered is made, for example, on the display not<br>
illustrated, etc . , to thereby prompt the execution of that entry<br>
processing. When correspondingly thereto a new code number<br>
PPN has been entered (step S51), next, whether the display of<br>
the representative picture image corresponding to the produced<br>
(step S46) reproduction list PL is the one which should be<br>
prohibited in the relevant menu screen is confirmed (step S53)<br>
according to the content of the operation in the operation part<br>
20. And when that display of the representative picture image<br>
is not the one which should be prohibited (step S53 : NO) , the<br>
content of the reproduction control flag PCF that should be<br>
included under the corresponding reproduction (play) list PL<br>
is set to "1" according to the determination in the step S48<br>
and, simultaneously, the content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF that should similarly be included<br>
thereunder is set to "0" and, further, the rode number PPN<br>
corresponding to only the reproduction list PL alone is set<br>
(step S37).<br>
On the other hand, when the display of that representative<br>
image is the one which should be prohibited (step S53: YES),<br>
'the content of the reproduction control flag PCF that should<br><br>
be included under the corresponding reproduction (play) list<br>
PL is set to "1" according to the determination in the step<br>
S48 and, simultaneously, the content of the reproduction list<br>
display prohibition flag PHF that should similarly be included<br>
thereunder is set to "1", and, further, the code number PPN<br>
corresponding to only the reproduction list PL alone is set<br>
(step S36).<br>
And, at the point in time when setting the content of<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF and the content of the<br>
reproduction list display prohibition flag PHF and the code<br>
number PPN has respectively finished being performed (steps<br>
S35, S36 and S37) the content of the corresponding reproduction<br>
list PL that was recorded (step S46) is rewritten (step S56) ,<br>
thereby the series of processing operations for the editing<br>
process are terminated.<br>
Next, the derail of the selection processing (step S41)<br>
of the reproduction list PL in the above-described editing<br>
process according to the second embodiment will be explained<br>
using Figure 15. Incidentally, Figure 15 is a flow chart<br>
illustrating the selection process of the reproduction list<br>
according to the second embodiment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 15, in the selection process<br>
of the reproduction list PL that is executed in the<br>
above-described step S41, first, when the menu screen M<br>
illustrated in Figure 7 is displayed by the execution of the<br>
above-described step S40, next, it is confirmed (step S70)<br>
whether the operation for displaying the representative picture<br>
image SI that is determined (displayed) as being non-displayed<br>
on that menu screen M (Figure 7A or 9A) has been performed in<br>
the operation part 20.<br>
And, when that operation has not been done yet (step S70 :<br>
NO), the selection of the reproduction list PL is performed<br>
using the representative picture image that is now being<br>
displayed (step S77), then the flow proceeds to step S42 of<br>
Figure 14.<br>
On the other hand, when the operation for displaying the<br>
representative picture image that is determined as being<br>
non-displayed has been operated (step S70: YES), next, for<br>
releasing the prohibition of that display, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 7B or Figure 9B, a field PT for entry that indicates<br>
that the code number PPN which must have been recorded every<br>
reproduction list PL is to be entered is displayed on the menu<br>
screen M to thereby prompt the execution of the entry processing .<br>
When the code number PIN corresponding to that, has beer, entered<br>
(step S71) , collation is made between that entered code number<br>
PPN and the code number PPN recorded in the corresponding<br>
reproduction list PL, and it is confirmed whether those coce<br>
numbers coincide with each other (step S73) . As a result of<br>
this, when the both do not coincide (step 373: NO) , it to<br>
determined that the user who should not view that representative<br>
picture image is now executing the editing process. And, the<br>
flow proceeds to step S75 as is. On the other hand, when the<br>
input code number PPN and the recorded code number PPN have<br>
coincided with each other (step S73: YES) , then as illustrated<br>
in Figure 7C or Figure 9C a corresponding representative picture<br>
imageSI is newly displayed within themenu screenM. In addition ,<br>
the reproduction list information such as the name, production<br>
date, etc. of the reproduction list, itself, PL is displayed,<br>
according to the necessity, by searching the interior of that<br>
reproduction list PL (step S74).<br>
And, it is confirmed, regarding all representative<br>
picture images SI that are now being displayed in the menu screen<br>
M, whether the processing operations in the steps S72 to S74<br>
have been executed (step S75) . When the processing about all<br>
the representative picture images has not finished being<br>
executed (step S75: NO), the flow again returns to step S72,<br>
thereby the above-described steps of processing about the<br>
remaining representative picture images SI are repeated. On<br>
the other hand, when the processing about all the representative<br>
picture images SI has finished being executed (step 375: YES) ,<br>
next, it is confirmed whether another code number PPN is to<br>
be entered (step S75).<br>
As a result of this , when another code number PPN is entered<br>
(step S76: YES) , regarding that entered new code number PPN<br>
the processing operations in the steps S71 to S75 are repeated.<br><br>
On the other hand, when no other code number PPN is input<br>
(step S76: NO), the selection processing of the reproduction<br>
list PL is executed using the representative picture image SI<br>
that is now being displayed in the menu screen M, as is, (step<br>
S77) , thereafter the flow proceeds to the above-described step<br>
S42 of Figfure 14.<br>
Incidentally, since the display process of the<br>
reproduction list PL and the reproduction process of the real<br>
information D, based on the use of the reproduction list PL,<br>
in the information recording/reproducing apparatus of the<br>
second embodiment are the same as those in the case illustrated<br>
in Figures 6 to 9 and Figure 11 in the first embodiment, the<br>
explanation of that detail is omitted.<br>
With the above-explained information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus of the second embodiment as<br>
well, the effect the same as that attainable in the case of<br>
the first embodiment is brought about.<br>
(III) Third embodiment<br>
Next, a third embodiment that is another embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be explained using Figures 16 to<br>
22.<br>
Although in the above-described first and second<br>
embodiments an explanation has been given of the case where<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF and reproduction list display<br>
prohibition flag PHF are disposed in the respectively separate<br>
zones, the third and fourth embodiments that will be explained<br>
below are each the embodiment in the case where only the<br>
reproduction control flag PCF is used in the way of being used<br>
concurrently as each of those two flags.<br>
Incidentally, in the Figures 16 to 22 that will be explained<br>
below, the same members in their corresponding figures that<br>
were used in the explanation about the first embodiment are<br>
denoted by the same member numerals with their detailed<br>
explanation being omitted.<br>
Also, since the construction of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the third<br>
embodiment is the same as that of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the- first<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, the explanation of that<br>
detail is omitted.<br>
(A) Embodiment of the recording format<br>
Initially, before concretely explaining the construction,<br>
etc. of the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the third embodiment, the recording format that<br>
is used when recording information with respect to 'he optical<br>
disc 1 by the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to tne third embodiment will be explained using Figure<br>
16. Incidentally, Figure 16 is a view illustrating the<br>
recording format (physical format) of the respective<br>
information according to the third embodiment.<br>
As described above, in the recording format of the third<br>
embodiment, the reproduction control flag PCF is also made to<br>
have the meaning as that of the reproduction list display<br>
prohibition flag PHF, and therefore in the recording format<br>
in the third embodiment the reproduction list display-<br>
prohibition flag PHF does not exist.<br>
Namely, as illustrated in Figure 16, in the recording.<br>
format in the third embodiment, as the respective reproduction<br>
list PL, in addition to the for-use-as-menu representative<br>
picture image SN, name information NM, gist information GL,<br>
and etceteras information ETP, a reproduction control flag PCF'<br>
having the meaning as that of the reproduction list display<br>
prohibition flag PHF, as well, is recorded.<br>
At this time, as the contents of the reproduction control<br>
flag PCF', in more detail, when the content of the real<br>
information D that is to be reproduced according to the<br>
reproduction list PL included under the reproduction control<br>
flag PCF' is the one which should be reproduction-controlled,<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF' is set to "1" by simultaneously<br>
making a determination of that the display of the reproduction<br>
list, itself, PL under which the reproduction control flag PCF'<br>
is included should also be prohibited in the menu screen M,<br>
while, when that real information D is not the one which should<br>
be reproduction-controlled, the reproduction control flag PCF'<br>
is set to "0" by simultaneously making a determination of that<br><br>
the display of the reproduction list, itself, PL should not<br>
be prohibited in the menu screen M.<br>
Incidentally, since the other construction of the<br>
recording format according to the third embodiment is the same<br>
as that of the recording format of the first embodiment, the<br>
explanation of that detail is omitted.<br>
(B) Embodiment of the construction and operation of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
Next, the operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the third<br>
embodiment will be explained using Figures 17 to 22.<br>
Firstofall, the recording process of the real information<br>
D, etc. according to the third embodiment will be explained<br>
using Figure 17.<br>
Incidentally, Figure 17 is a flow chart illustrating the<br>
recording process. Also, in Figure 17, the same operations<br>
of processing as those in the recording process of the first<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 4 are denoted by the same step<br>
numerals with their detailed explanation being omitted.<br>
In the recording process of the third embodiment, first,<br>
the processing operations in the steps SI to S8 illustrated<br>
in Figure 4 are executed, whereby recording processinq or<br>
necessary real information S, production/recording processing<br>
of necessary reproduction list PL and attribute informaticn<br>
CI, and recording processing of the code number PIN that is<br>
common to the optical disc 1 as a whole are executed. At this<br>
time, the processing regarding the reproduction list display<br>
prohibition flag PHF, such as that (step S9) executed in the<br>
first embodiment, is not executed.<br>
And, when in the determination of the step S6 the code<br>
number PIN is already recorded (stepS6 : YES) , next, for limiting<br>
the reproduction processing of the real information D based<br>
on the use of the produced (step S4) reproduction list PL the<br>
content of the corresponding reproduction limit flag PCF is<br>
set to "1" (step S80) and, further, the content of the<br>
corresponding reproduction list PL that was already recorded<br>
(step S4) at that point in time is rewritten (step Sll) . Then,<br>
the series of recording processing operations are terminated.<br>
Next, the concrete operation of the editing process for<br>
the real information D, etc. which is executed in accordance<br>
with the recording format illustrated in Figure 16 through the<br>
operation of the above-constructed information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus will be explained using Figure<br>
18. Incidentally, Figure 18 is a flow chart illustrating the<br>
editing process for the real information D according to the<br>
third embodiment that is executed mainly according to and from<br>
the CPU 17. The same steps of processing as those executed<br>
in the editing process according to the first embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 5 are denoted by the same step numbers<br>
and the explanation of their detail is omitted.<br>
In the editing process, initially, while it is having<br>
executed with respect thereto control processing such as<br>
prohibition of the display through the execution of the<br>
processing operations as later described in detail, the<br>
representative picture image corresponding to the respective<br>
reproduction list PL recorded in the optical disc 1 is displayed<br>
on the display not illustrated (step S40) and, by selecting<br>
the desired one from among those representative picture image<br>
that are displayed, selection of the reproduction list PL that<br>
is to be edited is made (step S41) .<br>
When the reproduction list PL is selected, then, next,<br>
the same processing operations as those in the steps S46 to<br>
S48 and steps S50 to S52 illustrated in Figure 5 are-executed.<br>
At this time, when, in the determination of the step S48,<br>
the content of the real information D that is to be reproduced<br>
according to the post-edit reproduction list PL is not the one<br>
with respect to which reproduction control should be performed<br>
(step S48: NO) , only the processing alone of setting the<br>
reproduction control flag PCF in that newly produced<br>
reproduction list PL to "0" is executed (step 335), then the<br>
flow proceeds to the processing in the step S56 illustrated<br>
in Figure 5 ,<br>
Also, when, in the determination of the step S50, the<br>
code number PIN is already recorded (step S50: YES) , next, only<br>
theprocessing, alone, of setting the content of the reproduction<br><br>
control flag PCF', which should be included under the<br>
corresponding reproduction list PL, to "1" is executedaccording<br>
to the determination in the step S48 (step S86).<br>
And, the content of the corresponding reproduction list<br>
PL that was already recorded (step S56) at the point in time<br>
when setting of the content of the reproduction control flag<br>
PCF' has finished being done (steps S85 and S86) is rewritten<br>
(step S56) , thereafter the series of editing processing<br>
operations are terminated.<br>
Next, the detail of the display process tstep S40) for<br>
the representative picture image corresponding to the<br>
reproduction list PL in the above-described editing process<br>
will be explained using Figure 19.<br>
Incidentally, Figure 19 is a flow chart illustrating the<br>
display process for the reproduction list according to the third<br>
embodiment and the same operations of processing as those<br>
executed in the display process according to the first embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 6 are denoted by the same step numbers<br>
and the explanation of their detail is omitted.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 19, in the display process for<br>
the representative picture image in the step S40, first, the<br>
same steps of processing operations as those in the steps 315<br>
and S16 illustrated in Figure 6 art executed.<br>
And, whether, regarding each of the real information D<br>
corresponding to the respective reproduction list PL that has<br>
been detected in step S16, the reproduction processing of that<br>
real information D is limited is determined by confirming the<br>
content of the reproduction control flag PCF' in that respective<br>
reproduction list PL (step S81).<br>
And, when the corresponding real information D is the<br>
one with respect to which reproduction limitation is not done<br>
(step S81: NO), the same steps of processing as those in the<br>
steps S19 and S20 illustrated in Figure 6 are executed, then<br>
the flow proceeds to the step S41 of Figure 18.<br>
On the other hand, when that corresponding real<br>
information D is the one with respect to which reproduction<br>
limitation should be performed (step S81: YES) , the same<br>
operations of processing as those in the steps S18 and S20<br>
illustrated in Figure 6 are executed, then the flow proceeds<br>
to the step S41 of Figure 18.<br>
Incidentally, although, in the display process<br>
illustrated in Figure 19, regarding the representative picture<br>
image the display of which is prohibited measure has been taken<br>
of displaying , in place of that image , the for-non-display image<br>
SSI illustrated in Figure 7A, other than this the following<br>
measure may also be taken. Namely, as illustrated in Figure<br>
20, regarding the reproduction list PL the corresponding<br>
representative picture image to whicn is display-prohibited,<br>
any image is not displayed at ail at that corresponding position<br>
(see Figure 8A) and only the representative picture image che<br><br>
display of which is permitted is displayed (step S19).<br>
Next, the detail of the selection processing (step S41)<br>
for the reproduction list PL in the above-described editing<br>
processwillbeexplainedusingFigure21 . Incidentally, Figure<br>
21 is a flow chart illustrating the selection process for the<br>
reproduction list according to the third embodiment and the<br>
same operations of processing as those executed in the selection<br>
process according to the first embodiment illustrated in Figure<br>
10 are denoted by the same step numbers and the explanation<br>
of their detail is omitted.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 21, in the selection processing<br>
for reproduction list PL in the step S41, first, when the menu<br>
screen M illustrated in Figure 7 is displayed through the<br>
execution of the step 40 processing, next, the processing of<br>
selecting the reproduction list PL the representative picture<br>
image of which is displayed in the menu screen M is executed<br>
in the operation part 20 (step S25) . Next, regarding the real<br>
information D corresponding to the thus-selected reproduction<br>
list PL, whether the reproduction processing of that is limited<br>
is determined (step SB2) by confirming the content of the<br>
reproduction control flag PCF' in the reproduction list PL.<br>
And, in a case where that reproduction list PL is the<br>
one with respect to which reproduction processing is not limited<br>
(stepS82: NO) , the flow proceeds to the step 542 as is, whereas,<br>
in a case where that reproduction list PL is the one with respect<br>
to which reproduction processing is limited (step S82: YES)<br>
next, the same operations of processing as those executed in<br>
the steps S27 to S29 illustrated in Figure 10 are executed,<br>
then the flow proceeds to the step S42.<br>
Finally, the concrete operation of the reproduction<br>
process for the real information D, etc. which is executed from<br>
the optical disc 1 in accordance with the recording format<br>
illustrated in Figure 16 through the operation of the<br>
above-constructed information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus will be explained using Figure 22. Incidentally,<br>
Figure 22 is a flow chart illustrating the reproduction process<br>
for the real information D according to the third embodiment:<br>
that is executed mainly according to and from the CPU 17. The<br>
same operations of processing as those executed in the<br>
reproduction process according to the first embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 11 are denoted by the same step numbers<br>
and the explanation of their detail is omitted.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 22, as the reproduction process ,<br>
first, the display process (step S60) for reproduction list<br>
?L and the selection process (step S61) therefor that are the<br>
same as those in the editing process illustrated in Figure 18<br>
are executed.<br>
Here, ina case where, as in the third embodiment, a setting<br>
is made of that when the reproduction list PL is the one which<br>
should be reproduction-limited the corresponding<br><br>
representative picture image is simultaneously not displayed<br>
either, there can occur no state where in that step S61 the<br>
code number PIN is entered and, on the other hand, the<br>
reproduction limitation is still made although that<br>
representative picture image is not displayed, and, therefore,<br>
after selecting that reproduction list PL (step S61), the<br>
reproduction processing of the corresponding real information<br>
D from the optical disc 1 is immediately executed (step S66) .<br>
And, further, whether reproduction up to the final real<br>
information D that is to be reproduced has finished being<br>
performed is confirmed {step S67).<br>
And, when reproduction process up to the final<br>
reproduction list PL has not finished being performed (step<br>
S67: NO) , the flow returns to the step S60 so as to select the<br>
reproduction list PL that includes the real information D that<br>
is to be reproduced next. On the other hand, when reproduction<br>
process up to the final reproduction list PL that is to be<br>
reproduced has already finished being performed (step 67: YES) ,<br>
the CPU 17 terminates the reproduction process according to<br>
the first embodiment as is .<br>
As described above, according to the operation of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus according to :ne<br>
third embodiment, since the reproduction control flag PCF' has<br>
two ways of meaning one of which represents whether prohibiting<br>
the display of the representative picture image and the other<br>
of which represents whether limiting the reproduction<br>
processing, itself, of the real information D corresponding<br>
to the reproduction list PL, in addition to the effect resulting<br>
from the operation of the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S according to the first embodiment the effect of<br>
enabling preventing the content of the real information D<br>
corresponding to the reproduction list PL from being<br>
inadvertently recognized by the user is also brought about by<br>
limiting the display of the representative picture image, and<br>
also limiting the reproduction processing of the real<br>
information D corresponding to the reproduction list PL,<br>
according to that reproduction control flag PCF'<br>
(IV) Fourth embodiment<br>
Finally, a fourth embodiment which is another embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be explained using Figures 23<br>
to 25.<br>
Although in the above-described third embodiment the code<br>
number PIN is recorded within the general information GM as<br>
being common to all the real information D, or reproduction<br>
lists PL, that are recorded in the optical disc 1, in the fourth<br>
embodiment explained below a specific code number is set every<br>
reproduction list PL. Further, the reproduction control flag<br>
PCF' according to the fourth embodiment also has two ways of<br>
meaning the same as those in the case of the third embodiment.<br>
Incidentally, in Figures 23 to 25 explained below, the<br><br>
same members as those in the corresponding figures that were<br>
used in the explanation in connection with the first or third<br>
embodiment are denoted by the same reference symbols, and the<br>
explanation of their detail is omitted.<br>
Also, since the construction of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the fourth<br>
embodiment is the same as that of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the first<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, the explanation of that<br>
detail is omitted.<br>
(A) Embodiment of the recording format<br>
Initially, before concretely explaining the construction,<br>
etc. of the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the fourth embodiment, the recording format that<br>
is used when recording information with respect to the optical<br>
disc 1 by using the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the fourth embodiment will be explained using Figure<br>
23. Incidentally, Figure 23 is a view illustrating the<br>
recording format (physical format) for the respective<br>
information according to the fourth embodiment.<br>
Since, as described above, in the recording format of<br>
the fourth emoodimenc, a specific code number is recorded in<br>
corresponding relationship to each of the respective<br>
reproduction lists, that code number is recorded not within<br>
the general information GM region but within the respective<br><br>
reproduction list PL region.<br>
Namely, as illustrated in Figure 23, in the recording<br>
format according to the fourth embodiment, the general<br>
information GM is constructed of only the user interface<br>
information GM reproduction lists number information NPL, and<br>
etceteras information ETG, alone, which are the same as those<br>
illustrated in Figure 16. On the other hand, the respective<br>
reproduction list PL has recorded therein a code number PPN<br>
different for each reproduction list PL in addition to the<br>
reproduction control flag PCF' , for-use-as-menu representative<br>
picture image SN, name information NM, gist information GL,<br>
and etceteras information ETP which are the same as those<br>
illustrated in Figure 16.<br>
Incidentally, since the other construction of the<br>
recording format in the fourth embodiment is the same as that<br>
of the recording format in the third embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figure 16, the explanation of that detail is omitted.<br>
(B) Embodiment of the construction and operation of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
Next, the operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the fourth<br>
embodiment will be explained using Figures 24 and 25.<br>
First, the recording process for the real information<br>
D, etc. according to the fourth embodiment will be explained<br>
using Figure 24.<br>
Incidentally, Figure 24 is a flow chart illustrating that<br>
recording process, and the same operations of processing as<br>
those in the recording process according to the third embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 17 are denoted by the same step numbers<br>
and the explanation of those details is omitted.<br>
In the recording process of the fourth embodiment, first,<br>
the processing operations in the steps S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and<br>
S7 are executed, thereby the recording processing of necessary<br>
real information D and the production/recording processing of<br>
necessary reproduction list PL and attribute information CI<br>
are executed. At this time, the processing operations (steps<br>
S6 and S8) -regarding the code number PIN within the general<br>
information GM such as those executed in the case of the third<br>
embodiment are not executed. Also, it results that the code<br>
number that is entered in the step S7 is the code number PPN<br>
that corresponds to only the reproduction list PL, alone, that<br>
has become an object with respect to which that code number<br>
should at that time be entered.<br>
And, when the entry of the code number PPN has finished<br>
being done, the content of the reproduction control flag PCF'<br>
that should be included under the corresponding reproduction<br>
list PL is set to "1" according to the determination in the<br>
step S5, and, in addition, the above-described code number PPN<br>
(that is already entered in the step S7) that corresponds to<br>
only the reproduction list PL alone is set (step S90) .<br>
And, at the point in time when the content of the<br>
reproduction control flag PCF, and the code number PPN, have<br>
respectively finished being set (step S90) , there is rewritten<br>
(step Sll) the content of the corresponding reproduction list<br>
PL that was theretofore recorded (step S4) , thereby the series<br>
of recording processing operations are terminated.<br>
Next, the editing process for the real information D,<br>
etc. according to the fourth embodiment will be explained using<br>
Figure 25. Incidentally, this editing process includes<br>
processing for producing a new virtual reproduction list VPL,<br>
processing for adding/recording new real information D,<br>
processing for changing the content of an existing virtual<br>
reproduction list VPL, processing for deleting part of existing<br>
real information D from the optical disc 1, etc.<br>
Also,, Figure 25 is a flow chart illustrating this editing<br>
process . Regarding the processing operations that are the same<br>
as those executed in the editing process of the third embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 18, they are denoted by the same step<br>
numbers and the explanation of the detail of those is omitted.<br>
In the edxting process of the fourth embodiment, first,<br>
the processing operations in the steps S40 and S41 and S46 to<br>
548 illustrated in Figure 18 are executed, thereby necessary<br>
editing processing operations with respect to the desired<br>
reproduction list PL are executed.<br>
And , when , in the determination in the step S48 , the content<br>
of the real information D that is to be reproduced according<br>
to the post-edit reproduction list PL is not the one with respect<br>
to which reproduction control should be performed (step S48 :<br>
NO) , the reproduction control flag PCF in the newly produced<br>
reproduction list PL is set to "0" and, further, setting of<br>
the corresponding code number PPN is not performed (step S91) .<br>
Then, the flow proceeds to the processing of the step S56 as<br>
later described.<br>
On the other hand, when the content of the real information<br>
D that is to be reproduced according to the post-edit reproduction<br>
list PL is not the one which should be reproduction-controlled<br>
{step S48: YES), next, the display indicating that the code<br>
number PPN corresponding to only the post-edit reproduction<br>
list PL should be entered is made, for example, on the display<br>
not illustrated, etc. , to thereby prompt the execution of that<br>
entry processing. When correspondingly thereto a new code<br>
number PPN has been entered (step S51) , next, the content of<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF that should be included under<br>
the reproduction (play) list PL that was produced (step S46)<br>
is sec co "1" according co the determination in the step 343<br>
and, simultaneously, the code number PPN corresponding to only<br>
the reproduction list PL alone is set (step S9<. .></.>
And, at the point in time when setting the content of<br>
the reproduction control flag PCF and the code number PPN has<br>
respectively finished being performed (steps S91 and S92) , the<br>
content of the corresponding reproduction list PL that was<br>
theretofore recorded (stepS46) is rewritten (stepS56) , thereby<br>
the series of editing processing operations are terminated.<br>
Incidentally, since the display process for reproduction<br>
list PL, selection process therefor, and reproduction process<br>
for the real information D based on the use of the reproduction<br>
list PL, which are executed in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the fourth<br>
embodiment, are the same as those in the case of the third<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figures 19 to 22, the explanation<br>
of those details is omitted.<br>
With the above-explained information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus of the fourth embodiment, as<br>
well, the same effect as that attainable in the case of the<br>
third embodiment can be brought about.<br>
Incidentally, although in each of the above-described<br>
respective embodiments not only the representative picture<br>
image SI but also the name, production time and date, etc. of<br>
the reproduction list, itself, PL have been illustrated as the<br>
-hings indicating the reproduction list PL that is displayed<br>
on the menu screen M, other than this there may be also included<br>
as such things letter information indicating the gist of the<br>
content of the real information D that is reproduced according<br>
to the reproduction list PL.<br>
Further, although in each of the above-described<br>
respective embodiments an explanation has; been given of the<br>
case where the data area DA exists only one piece within the<br>
optical disc 1, other than this it is also possible to construct<br>
in the way in which a plurality of different data areas are<br>
provided and, for each data area, the real information D is<br>
recorded separately and independently from that in another.<br>
And, in this case, in the first and third embodiment, for each<br>
data area, it is also possible to construct in the way in which,<br>
regarding only the real information D, etc. , alone, within that<br>
data area, a common code number PIN is set.<br>
Further, by keeping stored in an information recording<br>
medium such as a flexible disc the programs corresponding to<br>
the above-described respective flow charts, or keeping them<br>
distributed via the network such as the Internet, and reading<br>
them out and executing them by a general microcomputer, or the<br>
like, this general microcomputer, or the like can also be made<br>
to function as the CPU 17 according to the respective embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
