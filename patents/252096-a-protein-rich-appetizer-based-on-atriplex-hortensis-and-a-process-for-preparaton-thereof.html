				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a protein rich appetizer, based on Atriplex hortensis (chakota) and a process for preparation thereof, which on dispersion in hot water and simmering results in a refreshing drink, particularly for personnel facing the problem of loss in appetite.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
The commercially available vegetable soup mixes consist of permitted additives and vegetable powders, and so are not very nutritious and also suffer from loss of flavour and attractive colour.<br>
The vegetable soups known in the art are JP6062812, 1994; JP6339358, 1994; JP8009937, 1996. These soups are based on radish, mushroom, carrot, edible burdock and dried mushroom, with added carrot leaves which are boiled together to get the extract in water.<br>
The main disadvantage of the soup mixes based on above process is the flavour of sulfer compounds which is not liked.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above known process is that the soup prepared is less stable because it is in ready to drink form.<br>
Another soup known in the art GB2007489 and US4140809 is based on meat and vegetables. The ingredients comprise of vegetables, meats, chicken, marine products, eggs, bacon, ham, milk powder, starch seasonings and boiled fish pastes. The dried ingredients are mixed and packed in foamed polystyrene cups which by pouring boiled water &amp; mixing yield instant soup.<br>
The main limitation of the above meat based soups is that they are not acceptable to the vegetarian population.<br>
The lack of a specific flavor is another limitation of this product, which limits the acceptance of the product.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the above known process is the low stability of the resultant product.<br>
The other instant vegetable soups known in the art are based on corchorus olitorius (JP4190770, 1992) and courgettes, potatoes, haricot beans (FR2637780, 1990). The process comprises of drying the corchorus olitorius by freeze-drying.<br>
The main limitation of the above process is that it is a very cost intensive process.<br>
Another vegetable soup by Kawai Masaharu (JP8140638, 1996) comprises of added nucleic acids for preventing damage to genetic DNA.<br>
The limitation is that it is a research oriented patent of adding DNA to cooked vegetables which will be far from reality for using in daily diet.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that it is in a drinkable from and hence less stable.<br>
Nakai Takeshi and Inaguma Takahiro have improved the viscosity of vegetable potage soup (JP10136950, 1998) by the incorporation of potato starch and modified starch. Potato starch (1-2wt%) and modified starch (1-1.5%) added to a pressed juice of a vegetable and resultant mixture heated to prepare a vegetable potage soup.<br>
The major limitation of the above process is that the soup is less stable as it is in a drinkable form.<br>
A leafy vegetable soup, based on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea) by Fukuyama Takayasu (JP4079865, 1992), the process is based on the treatment of vegetable with calcium solution followed by thermal stabilization. To retain the green color of the vegetable, it is treated with calcium solution and then sterilized with heating.<br>
The main limitation is that the loss of nutrients is very high due to processing of soup at high temperature.<br>
Therefore there is a need to provide a novel leafy vegetable based soup, which has a stimulating effect on the physiological system, has balanced amino acids, an appealing flavour and green colour, which is shelf stable and can be prepared conveniently.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a protein rich appetizer, based on Atriplex hortenis and a process for preparation threof.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a protein rich appetizer, based on Atriplex hortenis and a process for preparation threof which can be prepared within a short period of simmering in hot water.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a protein rich appetizer, based on Atriplex hortensis and a process for its preparation wherein the original green colour and flavour is retained.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a protein rich appetizer, based on Atriplex hortensis which has stimulating effect on the physological system.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a protein rich appetizer, based on Atriplex hortensis which provides the essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals specially calcium and iron.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a protein rich<br>
appetizer, based on Atriplex hortensis which has a shelf life of 6-8<br>
months.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS;<br>

In accordance with the present invention a high protein appetizer mix based on Atriplex hortensis (chakota) and a process for its preparation has been provided. The appetizer mix comprises of chakota leaves, green chillies, finger milet, skimmed milk powder, pepper, salt, hydrogenated oil, corn flour, cumin seeds and sugar. The process for the preparation of the appetizer mix comprises of the following steps:<br>
a)	Preparation of ingredients:<br>
(i) Powdering of Atriplex hortensis (Chakota) leaves: Remove the stalks from the chakota leaves and segregate the clean sound portions, wash in water 2-3 times and drain the water. Chop the leaves into small pieces (1-2cm) and blanch in boiling water containing 0.1% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1% magnesium oxide and 0.2% sodium metabisulphate for about 2 minutes to stabilize the green colour and to retain the maximum nutrients. Blanched leaves are dehydrated by a cross air flow dehydrator at 50 to 60°C for 3 to 4 hrs to a moisture content of 4%. The dried leaves are ground to a fine powder and passed through 18 mesh sieve (1000µ) (ii) Powdering of green chillies: Remove the stalks from the green chillies, wash in water 2-3 times and drain the water. Chop the green chillies into small pieces(1-2cm) and blanch in boiling water containing 0.1% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1% magnesium oxide and 0.2% sodium metabisulphate for about 2 minutes. Blanched green chillies are dehydrated at 50 to 60°C for 3 to 4 hrs to a moisture content of 4%. The dried green chillies are ground to a fine powder and passed through 18 mesh sieve (1000µ).<br>
(iii) Powdering of Finger Millet: White ragi (finger millet) is soaked in water in the ratio of 1:2 for about 2 hrs. The hydrated millet is puffed in sand at a temperature of about 260 - 280°C, cleaned thoroughly, ground and passed through 18 mesh sieve (1000µ).<br>
(iv) Powdering of Spices: Salt, sugar, black pepper and cumin seeds are cleaned and finely ground using a grinder/ blender and passed through 18 mesh sieve (1000µ).<br>
b)	Preparation of appetizer mix:<br>
22 to 28 g wt% preferably 26 g wt% of powdered chakota leaves prepared in step a(i), 0.2 to 0.7 g wt% preferably 0.5 g wt% of green chilli powder prepared in step a(ii), 14 to 19 g wt% preferably 17 g wt% of puffed finger millet powder prepared in step a(iii), 20 to 26 g wt% preferably 24 g<br>
wt% of skimmed milk powder, 7 to 11 g wt% preferably 9 g wt% of salt, 3 to 7 g wt% preferably 5 g wt% of hydrogenated oil, 1 to 3 g wt% preferably 2 g wt% of corn flour, 1 to 3 g wt% preferably 2 g wt% of pepper, 0.5 to 2 g wt% preferably 1 g wt% of cumin seeds and 11 to 15 g wt% preferably 13.5 g wt% of sugar are mixed thoroughly and grinded in a mill and passed through 18 mesh sieve to get a fine powder of the soup mix. The soup mix is then packed in polypropylene and aluminium foil laminate pouches under sterilized conditions and stored at 18 - 33°C.<br>
Reconstitution of chakota soup mix:<br>
Chakota soup mix and hot water are taken in a ratio of 1:10 and simmered for 2 minutes. Soup is ready to serve.<br>
This invention will now be illustrated with working examples, which are intended to be typical examples to explain the technique of the present invention and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation to the scope of the present invention.<br>
