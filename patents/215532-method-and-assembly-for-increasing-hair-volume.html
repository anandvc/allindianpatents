				<td>Method and assembly for increasing hair volume<br>
The current invention refers to a method for increasing hair volume and to an<br>
assembly of hair extensions designed for use in this method and to the<br>
procedure for producing these assemblies.<br>
Various systems are already known for increasing hair volume and also for<br>
lengthening hair. These systems in general use hair extensions, natural or<br>
artificial in nature, which are then fixed to the head hair using methods that,<br>
based on the proposed application methods, determine the acceptance and<br>
satisfaction on the part of the user who has requested such treatment.<br>
Another aspect that helps to increase the satisfaction with such treatment is the<br>
speed of implementation.<br>
The known systems include a phase in which the extensions are connected to the<br>
hair of the user. During this phase, the extensions can basically be sewn, bonded<br>
or knotted to the user"s hair. However, these methods of extension require a<br>
period of time that is very long, considering that each single extension requires<br>
manual implementation and precision.<br>
Other methods are known for creating a connection between the extensions and<br>
the hair, requiring the use of external elements such as clasps, combs, grips, etc.<br>
These elements can be used to attach extensions of larger dimensions to the<br>
user"s hair, but have the great inconvenience that the connection is clearly visible<br>
and can be felt by the user who can feel uncomfortable with them.<br>
Amongst other known methods, there are those that permit smaller dimensioned<br>
extensions to be connected to the hair. These methods, that require the use of<br>
adhesive, small clasping elements, etc. give fairly good results, but in all cases<br>
require long application sessions because the operator must connect each<br>
individual extension, none of which can be of larger dimensions as otherwise the<br>
connections would be visible to the user and the observer.<br>
An example of this method is described in JP 03152205 (Aderans Co. Ltd.) and in<br>
other successive patents based on perfecting this technique. The inventor of the<br>
present invention has developed such methods and bondings for lengthening and<br>
thickening hair described in ZA 93/5214 A or in DE 196 26 107 C.<br>
These documents describe extension elements and the relevant method of<br>
application where an extension is fixed to the head hair with the application of a<br>
thermoplastic adhesive. In this context, it is clear that application is manual and<br>
that it may not be uniform from extension to extension.<br>
The forced manual implementation of these known methods therefore implies a<br>
series of problems. In the first case, the operator must have great experience<br>
and practice in this technique to be able to implement regular connections, a<br>
condition that is not always possible. In addition, apart from experience, it will be<br>
extremely difficult to produce uniform connections: they will vary greatly as they<br>
will not be positioned exactly along the lines proposed for the hair extension and<br>
will vary in quality and size.<br>
All this means that the quality of the finished work will not be optimal, will be<br>
more exposed to wear, with imperfections that cannot be rectified, increased<br>
costs due to very long application times and the difficulty in locating experienced<br>
operators.<br>
Similar difficulties are present with those methods using an adhesive applied to<br>
the connection being created, for example, in the method described in US<br>
4,934,387 (Megna).<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method of increasing hair volume and<br>
to provide an assembly of extensions designed to be used in this method which<br>
resolve the inconveniences mentioned with reference to the techniques noted.<br>
This problem is resolved by a method for increasing hair volume or length, comprising<br>
the following steps:<br>
providing a plurality of extensions comprising several hairs, which are<br>
connected by a fixing element, said extensions being aligned and basically<br>
in parallel with their fixing elements located on a support tape having an<br>
adhesive face;<br>
adhering the adhesive face of the support tape to head hair and positioning<br>
the extensions;<br>
connecting the extensions with the head hair by attaching the fixing<br>
elements to it; and<br>
removing the supporting tape.<br>
The solution idea consists of providing a method and an assembly for increasing<br>
hair volume with no manual intervention required and which allows the<br>
application of extensions in batches by applying several extensions in one step.<br>
The fixing elements connecting the hairs of each extension is usually called<br>
bonding<br>
The advantages of the method of the invention are:<br>
Since several extensions are fixed to the head hair in only one step the<br>
application of the extensions is much faster than with the known method. A hair<br>
extension procedure in which about 200 extensions are applied takes at least two<br>
hours when done in the conventional way. With the method of the invention the<br>
. same amount of extensions may be applied in fifteen minutes or less. Therefore<br>
not only costs are reduced but also the comfort for the customers is enhanced.<br>
The procedure is much easier to perform since it is no longer necessary to roll<br>
bondings with the fingers so that the method of the invention may be performed<br>
not only by specialized and trained staff but also by hair dressers after short<br>
introduction. The likelihood of mistakes is minimized and the appearance of the<br>
result is much better. This is due to the fact that the bondings are applied<br>
regularly with equal distances. Further the bondings are completely flat and less<br>
visible. The head hair is not pulled in from the sides to fix a bonding as it is the<br>
case with known methods in which the hair is pulled out of the natural falling so<br>
that the head hair forms a small triangle with the apex in the bonding. With the<br>
method of the invention the head hair remains essentially parallel so that so that<br>
the hair is not disturbed by the bondings and the natural appearance is<br>
maintained.<br>
A further advantage of the invention is that it is possible to use smaller<br>
extensions, i.e. each extension contains a smaller number of hairs compared to<br>
the conventional method. Since it is possible to apply a bigger number of<br>
extensions in a reasonable time a finer distribution of the hair can be<br>
accomplished. The use of very small bondings is not possible with the<br>
conventional method since the thermal capacity would be to small, so that the<br>
bonding would cool down in a short time after removing a heating device so that<br>
the time for which the bonding is soft and tacky is too short for establishing a<br>
proper connection to the head hair, by rolling it with the fingers, for example.<br>
The method of the invention is very safe since even a hot instrument is used for<br>
melting the thermoplastic material of the bonding or on the bonding it is possible<br>
to prevent the hot instrument from coming into contact with the hair or the head<br>
hair. Furthermore, no protection shield is needed any more for protecting the<br>
customer when applying the extension.<br>
There are two main embodiments of the method of the invention. In a first<br>
embodiment on the bondings or fixing elements connection means are located<br>
which are used to secure the extension on the head hair. Such connection means<br>
may consist of a drop of glue or hot melt adhesive, for example. Applying the<br>
extensions is especially easy if a glue is used which is activated by ambient air.<br>
In a second embodiment the fixing element itself is used as connection means.<br>
In that case the fixing element itself is softened by application of heat or<br>
ultrasonic energy to establish connection to head hair, for example.<br>
When the extensions are applied by means of heat the connection means<br>
preferably consists of a thermoplastic material which softens when the heat is<br>
applied. After cooling down the connection means the thermoplastic material is<br>
solidified and secure connection is established.<br>
Instead of applying heat directly it can be applied ultrasonic energy to the<br>
connection means. In this case a thermoplastic material softens due to heat and<br>
vibration produced by ultrasonic waves. The advantage of this procedure is that<br>
the head hair is less exposed to heat and that the method is fail safe.<br>
Further the invention relates to an assembly according to claims 10 and 11<br>
relating to a first and a second embodiment of the invention.<br>
The principal advantage of this method and the assembly of extensions resides,<br>
according to the present invention, in allowing the rapid application of a high<br>
number of extensions in a single step, implementing contemporaneously a<br>
corresponding number of connections with very small dimensions and therefore<br>
almost invisible and not detectable by the user.<br>
In a further variant of the invention the extension comprises hair of a color<br>
different to that of the head hair. In that way highlights or lowlights can be<br>
realized much easier than by conventional methods in which single strains of<br>
head hair are colored.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the fixing elements consist of plates<br>
having at least layers of plastic with different melting points. So it is possible to<br>
be sure that only a part of the fixing elements will be softened when treated with<br>
heat or ultrasonic energy.<br>
The current invention will now be described according to the various forms of<br>
preferred implementation provided as examples but not limited by reference to<br>
tfe Accompanying drawings.<br>

better understanding the function.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, an assembly 12 of extensions C, according to an<br>
initial , example for implementing the invention, consists of a number of<br>
extensions C, aligned and basically in parallel, consisting of a quantity of<br>
substantially predefined hairs 3 which can be natural or artificial, with<br>
appropriately selected colors, uniform or streaked.<br>
The extensions C are arranged substantially equidistant. They extend from their<br>
respective proximal extremities 2, designed to be connected to the head hair, to<br>
the free distal extremities. The extensions C and the respective hairs 3 have a<br>
length that is preferably uniform.<br>
Together with the aforesaid proximal extremities 2, the assembly 12 includes, on<br>
each extension C, a fixing element 13 produced from a thermoplastic material<br>
such as polyamide, polyester or even a polyurethane, for example, nylon.<br>
To connect the fixing element 13 to the respective extremities 3, various systems<br>
can be used, including hot gluing, injection, etc, which are well known in the art.<br>
The fixing element 13 has the form of a small rectangle or disk with a width<br>
(exaggerated in the drawings) substantially equal to or only slightly larger than<br>
that of the respective extension C. The same applies to the thickness, to limit to<br>
a minimum the quantity of thermoplastic material that, as described below, acts<br>
as the adhesive.<br>
The assembly 12 also includes a support tape 11, made of a transparent material<br>
with an adhesive face 4 on which the fixing elements 13 are positioned.<br>
The material forming the support tape 11 is preferably, but not exclusively, made<br>
of a material resistant to heat. The adhesive used is a non-permanent and<br>
reversible type, operated by pressure. Its adhesive force on the tape 11 is<br>
greater than that produced on the thermoplastic material that forms the fixing<br>
elements 13 so that a subsequent separation of the tape 11 from this material<br>
does not leave any adhesive residues.<br>
The aforesaid adhesive face 4 can be covered with a protective tape 14 (Fig. 1)<br>
to facilitate production and storage of the assembly 12.<br>
In this production example, the assembly 12 consists of means for connecting<br>
extensions C to head hair T that consist of the fixing elements 13 themselves as<br>
shown in the description of the hair extension method that follows.<br>
The support tape 11 can have a defined length and hold a predetermined number<br>
of extensions C or it can have an undefined length so that the operator can cut<br>
sections to select the desired number of extensions C.<br>
In all cases, the operator can eliminate one or more extensions that are not<br>
compatible with the application being carried out by simply cutting away a<br>
section of tape 11.<br>
On each assembly 12, the extensions C can be of the same length, size and<br>
color, but it is also possible to have variations in length to produce scaled<br>
increases, variations in color to produce complex streaks and variations in size.<br>
The covering and protective tape 14 can also be adhesive and/or transparent and<br>
can also be made of normal silicone-coated paper.<br>
Still based on the current example, the thermoplastic material can be a<br>
substance suitable for being fused at a temperature above ambient, assuming<br>
the properties of a plastic fluid, and then cooling and solidifying at ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Substances with analogous properties can be fused using the direct application of<br>
mechanical energy, in the form of high frequency vibrations, in particular,<br>
ultrasonic vibrations. In this case, the intermolecular vibrations and the resulting<br>
friction generate the quantity of heat necessary to plastically move the molecules<br>
with respect to each other. The generation of heat stops when the vibrations<br>
cease, resulting in almost immediate solidification.<br>
Examples of substances that can be used as a thermoplastic material are<br>
polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, etc.<br>
The function of the fixing element 13 according to the current invention is that of<br>
holding together the hairs in each extension C and that of providing the<br>
attachment point of the extension C to the hair of the head hair T being<br>
extended.<br>
Other examples of fixing elements 13 include plastic elements, in the form of<br>
disks or balls to which the hair of the extension is fixed. These fixing elements 13<br>
are associated with means of connections, for example, consisting of portions of<br>
a thermoplastic material as already described or glues and/or adhesives of<br>
another nature: pressure hardening, thermosetting, thermo-shrinking, etc. Such<br>
examples will be described below.<br>
The fixing element 13, which can have a color compatible with the hair of the<br>
extension C, can also be embellished with additional decorative elements such as<br>
strass, etc.<br>
All the fixing elements and their variations described above are suitable for the<br>
hair extension method described below.<br>
With reference to Figures 2 to 6, the extension method using the assembly<br>
described above proceeds with the following steps.<br>
The extension assembly is prepared, the protective tape 14 is removed if<br>
present. In this configuration, the extensions C are positioned in an ordered<br>
alignment; the support tape 11 can be stuck to the hair T being extended. The<br>
operator can utilize the adhesive face of tape 11 and its transparency to check<br>
the effect produced on the hair being extended before fixing it in place. The user<br>
can also check the effect by means of a mirror.<br>
Subsequently, once the position of the tape 11 and the extension C has been<br>
decided on, the next phase occurs in which the fixing element 13 is connected to<br>
the hair of the user. In this phase, the operator activates the means of<br>
connection described above.<br>
In the current implementation example, the fusing property of thermoplastic<br>
material is used. In fact, it is proposed that energy be applied to the fixing<br>
elements via the support tape 11. With reference to Fig. 3, a gripper device 15<br>
with two pressure elements 16 is used, elongated sufficiently to apply a uniform<br>
pressure along the entire length of the tape 11, compressing the fixing elements<br>
13.<br>
In this context, at least two systems for transmitting energy to the fixing<br>
elements 13 can be used. The first proposes the application of heat. For this<br>
proposal, the pressure elements 16 are heated in a convenient manner using one<br>
or more electrical resistors.<br>
In this case, the heat is transmitted from one side through the tape 11 and from<br>
the other directly onto the fixing elements 13. The tape 11, as previously<br>
described, is resistant to heat and will not deform nor degrade when in contact<br>
with the hot pressure elements 16.<br>
The second system proposes the use of mechanical energy in the form of<br>
ultrasonic frequency vibrations, for example in the range between 20 and 60<br>
kHz. In this case, one or both of the pressure elements are connected to a<br>
vibrating body, for example, a piezo-electric element subjected to alternating<br>
current at the desired frequency and they will transmit these vibrations to the<br>
fixing elements 13 both directly and through the tape 11.<br>
In this case, note that the application of vibrations allows the molecules of the<br>
fixing element 13 thermoplastic material to flow easily between the individual<br>
hairs of the extension C and the head hair T, penetrating and joining them<br>
together.<br>
Note also that, thanks to the efficiency with which the molecules distribute<br>
themselves around the hairs in subtle layers, only a minimum quantity of<br>
thermoplastic material is necessary to implement the fixing.<br>
In addition, without any source of heat, the immediate solidification when<br>
vibrations cease and the impossibility of molten thermoplastic material falling<br>
between the hairs or on the head of the user are all important added<br>
advantages.<br>
In all cases, the presence of tape 11 and the fact that it is compressed against<br>
the hairs together with the fixing elements 13 means that the thermoplastic<br>
material remains in position and forms connections with very small dimensions.<br>
In addition, the presence of tape 11 means that additional covers for protecting<br>
the user are not required. Once this connection phase is complete, tape 11 can<br>
be removed without leaving any glue on the hairs (Fig. 5), to complete the<br>
operation.<br>
In the case where the fixing elements are not made of thermoplastic material,<br>
the means of connection are activated using the systems described above.<br>
Where the means of connections consist of portions of thermoplastic material<br>
positioned in order on a suitable tape and destined to be joined with their<br>
respective fixing elements 13 of the extensions C, the aforesaid tape can be<br>
applied after the support tape 11 with the extensions C has been positioned on<br>
the hair of the user.<br>
The operator can easily superimpose the fixing elements 13 on the portions of<br>
thermoplastic material, conveniently positioning the tapes that can be removed<br>
and attached as necessary.<br>
Once in position, the tapes can be compressed together by means of a gripper<br>
unit 15, placing the tapes between the heated or vibrating pressure elements 16.<br>
In all cases, the two tapes contain the thermoplastic material, which adheres to<br>
the fixing elements and mixes with the hair of the user, connecting the<br>
respective extensions C to the head hair T.<br>
It is proposed that the dimensions of the fixing element and the portion of<br>
thermoplastic material can be reduced as required, without substantially<br>
influencing the capacity of the extensions of the assembly 12 of being connected<br>
to the respective head hairs.<br>
The considerations and variants of the application methods given above can be<br>
applied to the examples of assemblies produced as shown in Fig. 7 to 12, which<br>
represent a single portion of the assembly 12, which is repeated.<br>
With reference to Fig. 7, an assembly 12 is described where the fixing element<br>
13 consists of a rigid or semi-rigid disk, in a non-adhesive and non-thermoplastic<br>
material, but resistant to heat and vibration, like a normal plastic. It is intended<br>
that the form of a disk is simply an example; a plaque of any suitable form can<br>
be a fixing element. Various systems can be used for unifying the fixing element<br>
13 and the respective proximal extremities 2, such as adhesion (gluing or fusion)<br>
of a pair of semi elements that hold the hair or by an injection procedure that<br>
incorporates the extremities 2.<br>
In this second method of implementation, the element 13 is adhered to the<br>
adhesive face 4 of the support tape and the means of connection are represented<br>
by a quantity 20 of glue or thermoplastic substances applied directly to the<br>
exposed surface 21 of the element 13.<br>
With reference to Fig. 8, a third example of an assembly 12 proposes a fixing<br>
element analogous to the preceding example, which is repeated in the fourth and<br>
fifth example. The second and third example for producing the assembly 12 are<br>
adapted by the method described above where the thermoplastic substance of<br>
the respective quantities 20, 22 are melted using heat or vibration. It is also<br>
proposed that a thermosetting material, semi-fluid and/or plastic at ambient<br>
temperature and solid after the application of heat can basically substitute this<br>
substance.<br>
The fourth production example (Fig. 9) has a quantity of glue 23 located on the<br>
disk-shaped fixing element 13, for example pressure activated, thermally<br>
activated or a type that hardens on exposure to air, such as a two-component<br>
resin. In the last case, a protective layer 24 that prevents the glue from coming<br>
into contact with atmospheric oxygen protects the fixing element 13. The use of<br>
the glue means that the use of heat or vibrations is no longer required, as will be<br>
indicated, and the application equipment and the respective pressure devices<br>
serve to position the support tape 11 and the extensions C.<br>
With reference to Fig.10, a fifth example proposes the use of a fixing element as<br>
described in the previous examples and a means of connection consisting of an<br>
adhesive element 25, glue, thermoplastic or similar substance, arranged in order<br>
on the protective tape 14. In this case, the protective tape 14 helps in the<br>
application of the extensions C and is applied to the head hair T before the hair-<br>
extension connection. In the case where the glue is activated by air, an<br>
additional layer of protection is proposed.<br>
In the sixth and seventh examples of Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, the fixing element 13<br>
consists of a pair of semi elements 13a and 13b, suitable for being attached and<br>
trapping the hair of the head T. Finally, the semi elements will include a cavity<br>
26 for holding this hair. A semi element 13a is fixed to the proximal extremity 2<br>
of the extension C while the other 13b is positioned in order on the protective<br>
tape 14 and is applied according to the method in the preceding example.<br>
The means of connection consists of a thermoplastic substance or glue 28, in<br>
particular two-component glue or similar, protected by a suitable protective layer<br>
29.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 13 the fixing elements 13 consist of to layers 30 and<br>
31. The first layer 30 is fixed to the adhesive face 4 of the support tape 11. The<br>
hairs 3 are sandwiched mainly between the first layer 30 and the second layer<br>
31. The second layer 31 has a lower melting point than the first layer 30 so that<br>
upon application of heat or ultrasonic energy only the second layer 31 will get<br>
soft to establish the connection with head hair. The distance d between the fixing<br>
elements 13 may be chosen appropriately as 1 mm to 3 mm. In the same order<br>
of magnitude is the width b of the fixing elements 13.<br>
The assemblies may be produced by hand by fixing the extensions on the<br>
support tape, but it is preferred to use machines for production.<br>
Figs. 14 and 15 show a preferred embodiment of a gripper device 15 for use in<br>
the method of the invention. The gripper device 15 comprises a handle 50 from<br>
which two jaws 46, 47 protrude. The first jaw 46 has a recess 48 in which a<br>
pressure element 49 is held. The fixed jaw 47 has a contact surface 40 made of<br>
resilient material to obtain uniform pressure for all extensions.<br>
The pressure element 49 can be heated by serpentine thermistors 41 to activate<br>
the connection means. The pressure element 49 is driven by a rod 43 which is<br>
engaged to a pinion 42 driven by an electric motor 44. The pressure element 49<br>
is pivotable with respect to the rod 43 to be able to adapt to extensions having<br>
different thickness. Alternatively the pressure element may be driven by<br>
hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders.<br>
The movement of the pressure element 49 can be controlled by an actuating<br>
button 45. The temperature of the thermistors 41, the pressure applied by the<br>
pressure element 49 and other parameters are controlled by a programmable<br>
control unit connected with the gripper device 15.<br>
From the description, it is proposed that this method of hair extension does not<br>
require any manipulation on the part of the operator and enables the formation<br>
of extension-hair connections with very small dimensions, considering that the<br>
pressure elements, with the presence of at least one tape, contain the material<br>
that enables the connection to occur. The resulting connections are very subtle,<br>
with finished edges, almost imperceptible. The only manual intervention is based<br>
on manipulating the device that is used to activate the connection.<br>
The dimensions of the connection are not subordinate to the fact that the<br>
thermoplastic material and the hair of the extension must forcibly surround the<br>
hair of the head hair, creating a connection point whose volume cannot be<br>
reduced below a certain limit. For example, in the above-cited Japanese patent,<br>
the simple fact that the hair of the extension must be wound around the hair of<br>
the head creates in itself a voluminous connection.<br>
According to the current invention, the dimensions of the connection point<br>
depend exclusively on the quantity of hair compressed within the extension - the<br>
more subtle the extension, the more subtle the connection.<br>
The lack of manipulation therefore leads to the formation of uniform connections.<br>
Their optimal quality prevents disconnection due to, for example, penetration of<br>
water or similar.<br>
With this system, it is also possible to hide the extensions within the hair. Then,<br>
because it is possible to apply extensions equidistant to each other, additional<br>
extensions can be applied between them, with the possibility of obtaining<br>
consistent extensions within brief periods and to create complex streaks<br>
(highlights) by mixing in extensions with colors different to the hair of the user.<br>
This method reduces the quantity of thermoplastic material used, energy used<br>
for activation, no loss of heat and no contamination of the equipment or the<br>
connection device.<br>
In addition, as can be appreciated, the extension method described above and<br>
the related assembly of an extension, due to the possibility of using numerous<br>
application variations, allows the professional operator to make maximum use of<br>
their fantasy.<br>
In addition to the above described methods of adding extensions to hair,<br>
assemblies of extensions suitable for being used in the aforesaid method and the<br>
procedures for producing those assemblies, a technician in this field can<br>
implement numerous additional modifications and variations for the purpose of<br>
satisfying additional and complementary requirements, all of which are included<br>
within the protected field of the current inventions, as defined in the attached<br>
claims.<br>
Especially one skilled in the art will be aware that the shape of the fixing<br>
elements 13 may differ from that of the drawings and that the width of these<br>
elements may be the same as that of the extensions C or slightly bigger. Further<br>
the distance between the extensions C on the tape 11 may be chosen as<br>
appropriate.<br>
