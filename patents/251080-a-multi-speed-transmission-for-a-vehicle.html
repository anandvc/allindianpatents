CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/898,961 filed on January 31, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004]	A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of friction<br>
clutches or brakes, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br>
[0005]	While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
1<br><br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	A transmission is provided having an input member, an output<br>
member, four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and a plurality<br>
of torque transmitting devices. Each of the planetary gear sets includes first,<br>
second and third members. The torque transmitting devices are for example<br>
clutches and brakes.<br>
[0007]	An embodiment of the transmission includes four planetary gear<br>
sets, four clutches, and one brake.<br>
[0008]	It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets.<br>
[0009]	It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
transmission having at least eight forward speeds and at least one reverse.<br>
[0010]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and<br>
a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
[0011]	Further objects, aspects and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent by reference to the following description and appended<br>
2<br><br>
drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to the same component, element<br>
or feature.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012]	FIG. 1 is a lever diagram of an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission according to the present invention;<br>
[0013]	FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission according to the present invention; and<br>
[0014]	FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the state of engagement of the<br>
various torque transmitting clutches in each of the available forward and reverse<br>
speeds or gear ratios of the transmission illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015]	The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0016]	At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular example<br>
provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present invention has an<br>
arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the<br>
four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a first planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a second planetary<br>
gear set. A second component or element of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a stationary element. A second component or element<br>
of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second component<br>
3<br><br>
or element of a third planetary gear set. A first component or element of the third<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a<br>
fourth planetary gear set. Finally, a third component or element of the third<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third component or element of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0017]	Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
4<br><br>
[0018]	The transmission 10 includes an input member 12 and an output<br>
member 14. In the present embodiment, input member 12 and output member<br>
14 are shafts, and will be referred to as such. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the input and output members 12, 14 may be components other<br>
than shafts. The input member 12 is continuously connected to an engine (not<br>
shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output member 14<br>
is continuously connected with the final drive unit (not shown).<br>
[0019]	The transmission 10 further includes a first planetary gear set 16<br>
having three nodes: a first node 24, a second node 26 and a third node 28, a<br>
second planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 42, a second node<br>
44 and a third node 46, a third planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 52, a second node 54 and a third node 56, and a fourth planetary gear set<br>
22 having three nodes: a first node 72, a second node 74 and a third node 76.<br>
[0020]	The input member 12 is coupled to the third node 28 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 16. The output member 14 is coupled to the third node 76 of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 22. The first node 24 of the first planetary gear set<br>
16 is coupled to a stationary element or transmission housing 100. The second<br>
node 26 of the first planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the first node 42 of the<br>
second planetary gear set 18. The second node 44 of the second planetary<br>
gear set 18 is coupled to the third node 56 of the third planetary gear set 20. The<br>
first node 52 of the third planetary gear set 20 is coupled to a first node 72 of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 22. The second node 54 of the third planetary gear set<br>
20 is coupled to the third node 76 of the fourth planetary gear set 22.<br>
5<br><br>
[0021]	A first clutch 80 selectively connects the third node 28 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 16 with the third node 46 of the second planetary gear set 18.<br>
A second clutch 82 selectively connects the third node 46 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 18 with the second node 74 of the fourth planetary gear set<br>
22. A third clutch 84 selectively connects the input member 12 with the first node<br>
52 of the third planetary gear set 20. A fourth clutch 86 selectively connects the<br>
first node 42 of the second planetary gear set 18 with the first node 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 20. A first brake 88 selectively connects the second node 74<br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 22 with a stationary element or the transmission<br>
housing 100.<br>
[0022]	Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes, and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0023]	For example, the first planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear<br>
member 24, a ring gear member 26 and a carrier member 28 that rotatably<br>
supports a set of pinion gears 30 (only one shown). Sun gear member 24 is<br>
connected for common rotation with a first shaft or intermediate member 32. The<br>
first intermediate member 32 is connected to the transmission housing 100 and,<br>
thus, prevents sun gear member 24 from rotating relative to the transmission<br>
6<br><br>
housing 100. Ring gear member 26 is connected for common rotation with a<br>
second shaft or intermediate member 34. Pinion gears 30 are configured to<br>
intermesh with sun gear member 24 and ring gear member 26. Carrier member<br>
28 is connected for common rotation with a third shaft or intermediate member<br>
36 and the input member 12.<br>
[0024]	The second planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 42,<br>
a ring gear member 44 and a carrier member 46 that rotatably supports a set of<br>
pinion gears 48. Sun gear member 42 is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fourth shaft or intermediate member 38. Ring gear member 44 is connected for<br>
common rotation with a fifth shaft or intermediate member 50. Carrier member<br>
46 is connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or intermediate member<br>
53. Pinion gears 48 are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 42<br>
and ring gear member 44.<br>
[0025]	The third planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 52, a<br>
ring gear member 54 and a carrier member 56 that rotatably supports a set of<br>
pinion gears 58. Sun gear member 52 is connected for common rotation with a<br>
seventh shaft or intermediate member 60. Ring gear member 54 is connected<br>
for common rotation with an eighth shaft or intermediate member 62. Carrier<br>
member 56 is connected for common rotation with the fifth intermediate member<br>
50. Pinion gears 58 are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 52<br>
and ring gear member 54.<br>
[0026]	The fourth planetary gear set 22 includes a sun gear member 72, a<br>
ring gear member 74 and a carrier member 76 that rotatably supports a set of<br>
7<br><br>
pinion gears 78. Sun gear member 72 is connected for common rotation with the<br>
seventh intermediate member 60. Ring gear member 74 is connected for<br>
common rotation with a ninth shaft or intermediate member 64. Carrier member<br>
76 is connected for common rotation with the output member 14. Pinion gears 78<br>
are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 72 and ring gear<br>
member 74.<br>
[0027]	The torque-transmitting mechanisms or the clutches 80, 82, 84, 86<br>
and the brake 88 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or intermediate<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
the first clutch 80 is selectively engageable to connect the third intermediate<br>
member 36 to the sixth intermediate member 53. The second clutch 82 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the sixth intermediate member 53 to the ninth<br>
intermediate member 64. The third clutch 84 is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the input member 12 to the seventh intermediate member 60. The fourth clutch<br>
86 is selectively engagable to connect the seventh intermediate member 60 to<br>
the second intermediate member 34 and to the fourth intermediate member 38.<br>
The brake 88 is selectively engagable to connect the ninth intermediate member<br>
64 to the transmission housing 100 to restrict rotation of the ring gear member 74<br>
relative to the transmission housing 100.<br>
[0028]	Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the embodiment of<br>
the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that the<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member<br>
12 to the output shaft or member 14 in at least eight forward speed or torque<br>
8<br><br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 80, second clutch 82, third clutch 84,<br>
fourth clutch 86, and brake 88), as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth<br>
table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the<br>
gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending<br>
on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0029]	To establish reverse gear, the brake 88 and the second clutch 82<br>
are engaged or activated. The brake 88 connects the ninth intermediate member<br>
64 with the transmission housing 100. The second clutch 82 connects the ninth<br>
intermediate member 64 to the sixth intermediate member 53. Likewise, the<br>
eight forward ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and<br>
brake engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0030]	It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
9<br><br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0031]	The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
