				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a controllable transmission system and a method thereof,<br>
and more particularly to a transmission system and a method for transmitting a motive force	<br>
and enabling the receiving stress to be controllable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The energy is the motivity of any activity. The development of human culture relates<br>
closely with the energy used, and dependence on the energy becomes stronger with the<br>
industrialization development. Nowadays, the energy has a close relationship with<br>
economics, politics, national defense, technology, traffic and environmental sanitation, and<br>
thus it is doubtless that the energy is important. The energy used by humans can be<br>
divided into renewable energy and non-renewable energy. The renewable energy is<br>
derived from the sun, the wind, the water, the tide and the temperature difference of the<br>
ocean. However, the non-renewable energy refers to the energy with limited storage and<br>
being dwindling such as the fossil fuel (for example, the coal, the oil and the natural gas)<br>
and the nuclear energy.<br>
The water is a commonly used energy since the ancient times. In order to make use of the<br>
water energy, the motive force generated therefrom can be outputted through a proper<br>
transmission system. Unfortunately, the existing transmission systems have a constant<br>
receiving stress rather than a controllable receiving stress, and thus they can not be<br>
controlled according to actual needs. Therefore, the water energy can not be utilized in a<br>
best way, thereby unavoidably wasting the energy.<br>
In order to overcome the drawbacks in the prior art, a controllable transmission system with<br>
a resonable design is provided. The present invention overcomes the drawbacks in the<br>
prior art described above, and the summary of the present invention is described as follows.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the<br>
following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of preferred<br>
embodiments of this invention are presented herein for the purposes of illustration and<br>
description only; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form<br>
disclosed.<br>
First preferred embodiment<br>
Please refer to Fig. 1 to Fig. 3. The present invention is a controllable transmission system,<br>
which is mounted on a watercourse or other appropriate positions with a constant flow rate.<br>
The controllable transmission system comprises a rotation device 1, a coupling device 3<br>
and a control device 5, wherein the rotation device comprises a support 11, a rotation body<br>
12 and a plurality of blade units 13, where the support 11 is a fixed skeleton having two<br>
opposing bearing houses 111. The rotation body 12 has a transmission shaft 121 mounted<br>
on the central part thereof, wherein the transmission shaft 121 passes through the two<br>
opposing bearing houses 111 to mount the rotation body 12 on the support 11. Alternately,<br>
a chain wheel 78 can be disposed on the transmission shaft 121 to parallel a plurality of<br>
rotation devices 1 by using the chain wheel 78 and a chain 79, and thus the output motive<br>
force is increased. Further, if the plurality of rotation devices are coaxial and each rotation<br>
device 1 has a coupling device 3, the controllable transmission system can also provide an<br>
increased motive force.<br>
The blade units 13 are arranged radially outwardly from the rotation body 12 with an<br>
interval. The number of the blade units 13 is not limited and can be increased or decreased<br>
according to actual situations. Each blade unit 13 comprises a blade support 131, a<br>
stationary blade 132 and an adjustable blade 133. The blade support 131 is formed by<br>
extending the outer side of the rotation body 12, and the stationary blade 132 is fixed to the<br>
blade support 131. The adjustable blade 133 is pivotally coupled to the stationary blade<br>
132 at one side through a hinge being responsible for opening and closing of the adjustable<br>
blade 133. Accordingly, an opening 135 corresponding to the adjustable blade 133 is<br>
6<br><br>
formed on the blade unit 13, wherein the movement of the opening 135 is controlled by the<br>
adjustable blade 133.<br>
The outer side of the adjustable blade 133 of each blade unit 13 is further connected to a<br>
first contact element 136 and a second contact element 137, wherein the first contact<br>
element 136 and the second contact element 137 protrude outside the blade unit 13 at<br>
different positions. When the first contact element is pushed, the adjustable blade 133 is<br>
moved and opened, whereas the second contact element 137 is pushed, the adjustable blade<br>
133 is moved and closed. The rotation device 1 is mounted on a watercourse 9, and the<br>
lower half of the rotation body 12 and the blade units 13 thereof are immersed in the water,<br>
so that the blade units 13 are moved by the water, thereby rotating the rotation device 1.<br>
The coupling device 3 is mounted beside the rotation device, which comprises a base 31<br>
mounted across a watercourse 9, a rotary plate 32, a coupling unit 33 and two coupling<br>
elements 34. The center of the rotary plate 32 is pivoted on the top of the base 31 through<br>
a shaft 321 so that the rotary plate 32 can rotate on the base 31. The coupling unit 33 is<br>
positioned between the rotary plate 32 and the rotation device 1, which is movablly<br>
mounted beside the rotation device 1. Further, the coupling unit 33 has a first contact<br>
surface 331 and a second contact surface 332 positioned with an interval, and the coupling<br>
unit 33 is coupled with the rotary plate 32 through the two coupling elements 34.<br>
The control device 5 is positioned beside the coupling device 3 and comprises a stationary<br>
element 51, a sliding element 52, at least two wheels 53 and at least two connecting element<br>
54, wherein the stationary 51 is fixed apart from the coupling device 3 on one side. The<br>
sliding element 52 mounted on the stationary element 51 has a first incline 521 and a<br>
second incline 522. The sliding element 52 can be controlled manually or electrically<br>
through connecting with a transmission machine or a motor for a forward and backward<br>
movement.<br>
The two wheels 53 having a respective pivot 55 run on the first incline 521 and the second<br>
incline 522 respectively. The pivot 55 mounted on the stationary element 51 slides<br>
perpendicularly to the sliding of the sliding element 52 to move forward and backward to<br>
the rotary plate 32. The two connecting elements 54 connected between the pivot 55 of<br>
the two wheels 53 and the rotary plate 32 enable the control device 5 to be connected with<br>
the rotation device 1 through the coupling device 3. When the two wheels 53 run on the<br>
first incline 521 and the second incline 522, the rotary plate 32 can be driven by the<br>
movement of the pivot 55 and the connecting elements 54. According to the<br>
7<br><br>
above-mentioned components, a controllable transmission system of the present invention<br>
is formed.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a controllable transmission method, which<br>
comprises the following steps (please refer to Fig. 1 to Fig. 6):<br>
a.	A transmission system comprising a rotation device 1, a coupling device 3 and a control<br>
device 5 is provided, wherein the rotation device 1 comprises a rotation body 12 and a<br>
plurality of the blade units 13 connected with rotation body 12, and each of the blade units<br>
13 comprises an adjustable blade 133 having a first contact element 136 and a second<br>
contact element 137 and having an opening 135 corresponding to the adjustable blade 133.<br>
The coupling device 3 mounted beside the rotation device 1 comprises a rotary plate 32 and<br>
a coupling unit 33, wherein the coupling unit 33 having a first contact surface 331 and a<br>
second contact surface 332 is positioned beside the rotation device 1. The control device 5<br>
comprises a sliding element 52, at least two wheels 53 and at least two connecting elements<br>
54, wherein the sliding element 52 having a first incline 521 and a second incline 522 runs<br>
on a stationary element 51, and the two wheels 53 pivoted on a pivot 55 respectively run on<br>
the first incline 521 and the second incline 522, and the pivot 55 is positioned slidably on<br>
the stationary element 51 and connected with the rotary plate 32 by the two connecting<br>
elements 54.<br>
b.	The pivot 55 and the two connecting elements 54 are driven by pushing the wheels 53<br>
with the inclines 521 and 522 of the sliding element 52 of the control device 5 for rotating<br>
the rotary plate 32 of the coupling device 3.<br>
c.	The coupling unit 33 is moved by the rotary plate 32 to enable the first contact surface<br>
331 or the second contact surface 332 to be positioned corresponding to the first contact<br>
element 136 (as Fig. 3 shows) or the second contact element 137 (as Fig. 5 shows).<br>
d.	The plurality of the blade units 13 are moved by the water for rotating the rotation device<br>
1 clockwise. If the first contact surface 331 of the coupling unit 33 is corresponding to the<br>
first contact element 136, the first contact element 136 can be pushed by the first contact<br>
surface 331 which causes the adjustable blade 133 to be open (as Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show).<br>
However, if the second contact surface 332 of the coupling unit 33 is corresponding to the<br>
second contact element 137, the second contact element 137 can be pushed by the second<br>
contact surface 332 which causes the adjustable blade 133 to be closed (as Fig. 5 and Fig. 6<br>
show).<br>
8<br><br>
When the above-mentioned adjustable blade 133 is not covering the opening 135, the blade<br>
units 13 receive a minimum stress, and when the adjustable blade 133 is covering the<br>
opening 135, the blade units 13 receive a maximum stress. Therefore, the contact area of<br>
the blade units 13 is changeable.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 7, which is a 3-D diagram of the controllable transmission system in the<br>
present invention that is connected with an output machine. The motive force generated<br>
by the rotation device 1 can be outputted through an output machine 7 connected to the<br>
transmission shaft 121, wherein the output machine 7 comprises a first coupler 71, a gear<br>
housing 72, a second coupler 73, a free-wheel 74, a third coupler 75 and an output terminal<br>
76. The first coupler 71 connects the transmission shaft 121 and the gear housing 72, the<br>
second coupler 73 connects the gear housing 72 and the free-wheel 74, and the third<br>
coupler 75 connects the free-wheel 74 and the output terminal 76. The free-wheel 74<br>
stabilizes the output of the motive force and further comprises a brake 77 for controlling the<br>
output and the stop of the motive force. The type of the output terminal 76 is not limited,<br>
it can be any power-driving device such as a generator.<br>
Based on the above embodiments, it is known that the distinguishing feature of the present<br>
invention lies in the controllable blade units 13 of the rotation device 1. The adjustable<br>
blade 133 of the blade units 13 can be adjusted as an open or a closed state by the control<br>
device 5 through the coupling device 3 so as to modulate the contact area of the blade units<br>
13 and control the stress received by the blade units 13. Accordingly, the stress received<br>
by the rotation device 1 is controllable based on actual needs so that a maximum efficiency<br>
of the controllable transmission system is obtained and the waste of the energy is avoided.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of what is presently considered to be the<br>
most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention needs<br>
not be limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various<br>
