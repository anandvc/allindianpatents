US Patent Nos. 4.153.679 and 4 226 988 hereby incorporated by reference, disclose the use of paramenthane and acyclic carboxamides as having a cooling effect on the skin and mucous membranes. These patents disclose the preparation and separation of the compounds through a three-step reaction sequence. The steps basically involve the hydrolysis of the compounds to an acid. The acid product is then reacted with thionyl chloride to form an acid chloride.    The acid chloride is then reacted with an alkylamine to form carboxy amide<br>
While this reaction is suitable for preparing the carboxamides, the process does not lend itself to the manufacture of the desired product in a simple economical process.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a solvent system is employed. The Solvent is selected from various diol and triol esters and mixtures of these materials. The diol esters have the structure of Formula IV (Formula Removed)<br>
And triol esters of the structure presented in Formula V<br>
Where R2 is H or (C1-C,8)alkyl; and R3 is H or (C1-C18)alkyl.<br>
Suitable solvent materials include triacetin, propylene glycol acetate, ethylene glycol acetate, 1,2,6-hexanetriol acetate and the like. Preferably the molar ratio of solvent to nitrile is greater than about 1.25/1; preferably greater than 1.5/1 and most preferably greater than 1.75/1. For example, a preferred the level of triacetin is 1.5 times the stoichiometric level of diisopropylpropionitrile provided in a reaction with dimethyl sulfate.<br>
The present invention is sufficient to provide yields of greater than 50 mole % based upon the level of nitrile present. Yields of greater than about 60 mole percent and preferably greater that about 70 mole percent are also possible with the present reaction.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the incorporation of the mono, diol and triol esters as<br>
the solvent allows for higher yields and better reaction times. Reactions conducted without the<br>
diol or triol ester solvent provided much lower yields and much longer reaction times. The<br>
invention will now be illustrated by the following example.<br>
Example 1	Preparation of Trimethyl Isopropyl Butanamide<br>
Diisopropylproprionitrile (200 grams) and triacetin (1000 grams) were charged to a 5 liter reaction reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and heating mantle. The reactor contents are heated to 145 C. Dimethyl sulfate (344 grams) is fed into the reactor while<br>
recovering methyl acetate. The batch is allowed to continue until no more methyl acetate is recovered. The approximate reaction time was about 5 hours.<br>
The contents of the reactor were then allowed to cool to room temperature and ethyl acetate is added to reduce the viscosity of the product. The batch is then decomped into 25% caustic. The crude is washed twice with salt water. The crude is then distilled.<br>
This procedure yielded approximately 70% mole/mole based on the charged amount of diisopropylproprionitrile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
