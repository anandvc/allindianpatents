				<td>COOLING SYSTEM FOR CONTINUOUS ANNEALING FURNACES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a coupling system for continuous annealing furnaces for producing annealed strips. The cooling system of the present invention has favourable effects in the process of annealing and results in improved quality of annealed strip. The system is also applicable in any cooling operation and can be very well utilized for any furnace or similar application.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In manufacture of metal or alloy, especially steel, the strips are finally rolled in tandem mill after manufacture. These strips before annealing poses little or no cold working properties due to grain elongation and distortion of the crystalline lattice pattern during manufacture. This high degree of deformation is restored to a microstructure equilibrium allowing recrystallisation of these grains by heat treating at below the lower critical temperature known as annealing. Annealing process is carried out in batch furnaces or in continuous annealing lines. The draw ability of the strip of the continuous annealed material is better than box annealed material if annealing is carried out at higher temperature-ranges.<br>
Continuous annealing lines primarily comprise arrangements for cleaning of strips and annealing furnace. Annealing furnaces comprise different zones or chambers like heating, holding, slow cooling and fast cooling.<br>
In the fast cooling chamber there are large number of cooling fans for cooling of the strips before they come out of the protective atmosphere of the furnace The fans are suitably arranged in the chamber walls and are so fitted such that the blades are inside the chamber and the corresponding motors are outside. In order to protect the motor and bearings from the elevated temperatures of the chamber, a heat shield is built<br><br>
2<br>
between the blades and the motor. Such conventional heat shields utilize running water to absorb the heat generated inside the chamber so that the motor does not heat up. Such water shields comprise an annular space having water inlets and outlets. Water enters the annular space through the inlet, absorbs heat and hot water flows out through the outlet. Such water shields are quite common and have diverse applications in the industry.<br>
The aforesaid system has some inherent drawbacks especially in cases when the cooling chamber has an atmosphere of protective gases. A typical atmosphere in the cooling chamber of an annealing furnace is 95% Nitrogen and 5% Hydrogen. The atmosphere does not allow any oxidation of the high temperature strips inside the cooling chamber. However, in cases of water leakage, even as little as a few drops can destroy the protective atmosphere and lead to unwanted oxidation of the strips. The water leaking out of the water-flow space vapourizes easily in the elevated temperature of the cooling chamber and leads to formation of oxidising atmosphere inside the chamber, thus destroying the protective atmosphere. This leads to surface deterioration of the strips.<br>
In addition to this, the industrial water used in such cooling purposes forms scales and depositions inside the annular space or pipelines through which the water flows into and out of the annular space. Such deposits cause decrease in the flow of cooling water and may lead to complete blockage if proper maintenance is not carried out in time. Maintenance of pipelines would mean closing down a portion of the system during the cleaning operation. Deposition/scaling can be avoided by prior purification of cooling water but the use of purified water is uneconomical. Moreover, one often finds steam at the outlet pipe and drain which are in the proximity or in contact with the motor. This steam comes in contact with the motor, reduces its insulation and eventually results in motor burning. Subsequently, the cooling system becomes nonfunctional.<br><br>
3<br>
In conventional systems, the cooling water-flow annular space is integral with the fan and motor. The absence or non-functioning of a single fan and motor would mean stopping the water flow in atleast a part of the system. In most situations the cooling water flows through a series of annular spaces and fans and disassembling one fan and motor would mean shutting down the complete series and in turn shutting down the complete furnace. Similarly, an operation of assembling of a fan would mean the shutdown of the furnace. This leads to increased down time and subsequent decrease in productivity. Even if few of the fans are non-functional, all the fans in series have to be stopped resulting in decrease in the line speed of the continuous annealing furnace.<br>
US 6069652 teaches a furnace video camera apparatus from monitoring industrial processes for viewing the interior of the heated chamber. The patent teaches ceramic heat shield tube telescopically surrounding and spaced from at least a portion of the camera. Importantly, in US 6069652 heat prevention is effected by use of the ceramic tubes. Furthermore, in US 6069652 cooling fluid is used.<br>
Thus there is a need for an improved cooling system which will effect fast and effective cooling of the hot strips in the fast cooling chamber and will not have the drawbacks of the conventional cooling systems.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a cooling system in a continuous annealing furnace that is efficient and improves the quality of annealed strips produced in the said furnace.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a cooling system that is fast and leads to increased productivity of annealed strips.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cooling system that does not have the inherent drawbacks associated with the use of water for shielding of heat between the motor and the hot chamber.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cooling system which requires very less down time for repair and maintenance.<br><br>
4<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a cooling system that ensures long life of the fan motors.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a cooling system which helps in maintaining the protective atmosphere in fast cooling chambers in annealing furnaces.<br>
The applicants have now surprisingly found that the aforesaid objects can be achieved by the use of suitable insulating materials in place of the annular water-flow spaces, the insulating material preferably being ceramic fibres.- The applicants have further found that unlike US 6069652 providing heat shields between fans and motors in the form of ceramic sheet/blanket provides fast and effective cooling and at the same time eliminates use of any liquid cooling arrangement.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a cooling system for continuous annealing furnace for producing annealed strips comprising:<br>
a plurality of sets of fans and motors provided at atleast one of the walls of the cooling chamber of the said continuous annealing furnace, said fans projecting inside the cooling chamber and the corresponding motors outside the said chamber, each said fan and corresponding motor being connected by a bearing shaft passing through the said wall; and<br>
heat shields provided between the said fans and motors characterized in that the heat shield is comprised of ceramic fibre sheet.<br>
Detailed description<br>
The present invention describes a completely new approach for protection of the motor and bearings of the cooling components/fans. The system comprises a plurality of sets of fans and motors provided at atleast one of the walls of the cooling chamber of the continuous annealing furnace. In each of the sets the fan projects inside the cooling chamber and the corresponding motor outside the chamber. The fan and the motor is<br><br>
5<br>
connected by a bearing shaft passing through the wall of the cooling chamber. Heat shields are provided between the fans and motors. These heat shields are made of ceramic fibre and form portions of the said wall in the regions around the said bearing shaft substantially covering the area of the fans. The heat shields are circular in shape covering the area of the fans. They may also be of different shapes but must substantially cover the area of the fans to adequately protect the motor from the heat generated inside the cooling chamber. The chamber has a number of fans depending on the size of the chamber, the amount of cooling required and the production speed.<br>
Any grade of ceramic fibre can be used in the heat shield of the present invention. Preferably, grades of ceramic fibre for applications wherein the temperature is around 1260°C and 1400°C are proposed. However, since the temperature of cooling chamber remains much lower than either of the aforesaid temperatures, any grade of ceramic fibre can be used.<br>
Ceramic fibres are classified as per their chemical analysis. One is alumina silica based and the other is alumina zirconium based: Either of the two can be used on the present application.<br>
The present invention effectively removes the drawbacks associated with the prior art cooling systems. As the present invention does not use running water, the problems associated vaporization of water thereby destroying the protective atmosphere of the cooling chamber is avoided. The present system does not involve any inlet and outlet for running water and saves installation cost on pipelines and water pumps. Furthermore, problems like scaling and deposition inside pipelines and damage of fan motors due to emergence of steam from pipelines in proximity is non-existence. The present system also requires less down time during any installation/maintenance as the ceramic fibre heat shields can be made integral with the wall of the cooling chamber and removal of the heat shield and/or shutting down of the furnace is not required during any fan motor failure or general maintenance operation.<br><br>
6<br>
In addition to removing the drawbacks of prior art systems, the present invention also results in high productivity of annealed steel. Furnace productivity depends on many factors out of which fast cooling is one factor. Since the present system ensures that the fans do not break down and that all the fans work simultaneously with longer life, high cooling and productivity of line speed is achieved.<br>
