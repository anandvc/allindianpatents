The present invention relates to a process for reducing the molecular weight of polypropylene, propylene copolymers or polypropylene blends<br>
The invention relates to novel hydroxylamine esters and polymerizable compositions com prising these hydroxylamine esters and an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer. The invention further relates to the use of hydroxylamine esters as polymerization initiators and to the use of hydroxylamine esters for the controlled degradation of polypropylene and for the controlled build-up of the molecular weight or crosslinking of polyethylene.<br>
Free-radical polymerization is among the most important methods of building up a relatively long carbon chain. It is employed in process technology for preparing commercially impor Xant polymers such as polystyrene, PVC, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, PAN and other polymers. For technical details, reference may be made to the still relevant standard work G. Odian, Principles of Polymerization, McGraw-Hill New York 1970, and also to H. -G. Ellas, Makromolekule, 6th Edition, Volume I, Wiley- VCH, DE-Weinheim 1999, ISBN 3-527-298 72- X; K. Hatada, T. Kitayama, 0. yogi, Macromolecular Design of Polymeric Materials, Marcel Dekker New York 1997, ISBN 0-8247-9465-6; M. K. Mishra, Y. Yagci, Handbook of Radical Vinyl Polymerization, Marcel Dekker New York 1998, ISBN 0-8247-9464-8.<br>
Free-radical polymerizations are started using initiators. Initiators which have become estab lished in process technology are azo compounds, dialkyl peroxides, diacyl peroxides, hy droperoxides, thermolabile C-C-dimers, redox systems and photoinitiators.<br>
Despite their widespread use, these initiators have various disadvantages. Thus, for exam ple, peroxides are extremely readily ignitable and sustain fire. Other classes of substances are potential explosion hazards, so that their use, storage and transport has to involve costly safety precautions.<br>
There is therefore a general need for advantageous initiators useful in process technology which have a satisfactory safety profile for free-radical polymerization processes. EP-A-735052describes a process for preparing thermoplastic polymers having a low poly dispersity, which comprises free-radical polymerizations by addition of customary free-radical initiators in combination with stable free radicals as polymerization regulators to the mono mers. WO 98/3060 1 describes nitroxyl radicals (&gt;N-0. compounds) based on imidazolidi nones and derived from alkoxyamines and their use as polymerization initiators.<br>
WO 98/44008 likewise describes nitroxyls based on morpholinones, piperazinones and piperazinediones. WO 00/0798 1 describes open-chain alkoxyamines and their use as po lymerization initiators. The published German patent application 199 49 352.9 describes further 5- and 6-membered heterocyclic alkoxyamines which are substituted in one or both a-positions and display steric hindrance owing to the size of these substituents.<br><br>
Regardless of these proposed possibilities, which are a representative selection of the prior art, for improving the procedures for free-radical polymerizations, there continues to be a need for new polymerization initiators which can be used safely and allow a controlled reaction.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that open-chain and cyclic hydroxyiamines of various structures are particularly suitable as polymerization initiators if they are esterified by acyl radicals.<br>
The invention provides compounds<br><br><br>
R1 - R4 are each C1-C6alkyI;<br>
R5 and R6 are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, CrC6alkyl or C6-C10aryi; or<br>
R5 and R6 are together oxygen;<br>
Q is a direct bond or a bivalent radical -(CR7R8)- or -(CR7R8-CR9R10)- where<br>
R?, Rs, Rg and R10 are each, independently of one another hydrogen or d-Csalkyl; and<br><br>
c) of the formula:<br><br><br>
A is a substituent on the phenyl rings; and<br>
m is zero or an integer from one to four; or<br>
d) of the formula: <br>

Rc and Rd are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, CrC6aIkyl or C6-C10aryi; and<br>
R-( - R3 are each, independently of one another, C1-C6alkyl or C6-Ci0aryl.<br>
These compounds are suitable as polymerization initiators, particularly for use in polymerization processes, since they allow the formation of particularly pure poiymers and copolymers.<br>
The term polymer encompasses oligomers, cooligomers, polymers and copolymers, for example random block, multiblock, star or gradient copolymers.<br>
A further advantageous property of the novel compounds in process technology is their suitability as additives in processes for lowering the molecular weight of polymers, in particular polypropylenes, and in processes for achieving a controlled increase in the molecular weight of or crosslinking of polyethylene.<br>

(3) at least one compound of the formula la, where<br>

RT - R3 are each, independently of one another, hydrogen or CrC6alkyl or C6-C10aryi;<br>
is subjected to the reaction conditions of a free-radical polymerization.<br>
In the hydroxylamine esters (la), diacylamino as R12 or R13 is, for example, -N[-C(=0)-CrC6aikylene-C(-0)-]I e.g. of the partial formula:<br><br>
The free-radical polymerization is carried out by dissociation of the initiators defined above by treatment with ultrasound, heating or action of electromagnetic radiation in the range from y-rays to microwaves. The initiator is preferably dissociated thermally, preferably at a temperature of from 50Â°C to 160Â°C, in particular from 80Â°C to 150Â°C. After the polymerization step has been completed, the reaction mixture can be allowed to cool to a temperature below 60Â°C) preferably room temperature.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process the polymerisation is effected in the presence of an energy intensive light source providing light in the near infrared range (NIR) of about 800-1200 nm. Such light sources are commercially available from AdPhos (cf. www.adphos.de). The high thermal energy of such light sources is particularly suitable for the preparation of thermally curable lacquers (especially powder coatings or adhesives) in the presence of the of the polymerisation initiators defined above. Additional components in these lacquers are the ones conventionally used in the preparation of clear or pigment coatings.<br>
The polymerization process can be carried out in the presence of water or an organic solvent or mixtures thereof. It is possible to add additional cosolvents or surfactants, for example glycols or ammonium salts of carboxylic acids, to the reaction mixture. The abovementioned monomers or oligomers can be present in the reaction mixture in a concentration of from 1.0 to 99.9% by weight, preferably from 5.0 to 99.9% by weight, particularly preferably from 50.0 to 99.9% by weight, based on the monomer content of the polymer. Suitable organic solvents are alkanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate) or ethers (diethyl ether, di-butyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran) or mixtures thereof.<br>
When using water as solvent, a water-miscible or hydrophilic solvent can be added to the reaction mixture. Care should be taken to ensure that the reaction mixture remains as a single homogeneous phase during the polymerization reaction and no precipitation or phase separation takes place. Suitable cosolvents can be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyrrolidines, N-alkylpyrrolidinones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, carboxylic acids and their salts, esters, organic sulfides, sulfoxide, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives, e.g. butyl carbitol or cellosolve, amino alcohols, ketones, derivatives and mixtures thereof, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropyiene glycol, tetrahydrofuran or other water-soluble or water-miscible solvents or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Hydrophilic monomers, polymers and copolymers can be separated from the reaction mixture using customary methods, for example by distillation, precipitation, extraction, alteration of the pH or other customary separation methods.<br>
The polymers which can be prepared by the process of the invention may have a number average molecular weight of from 1 000 to 400 000 g/mol, preferably from 2 000 to 250 000 g/mo! and particularly preferably from 2 000 to 200 000 g/mol. The number average molecular weight can be determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), matrix-aided LASER desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or, when the initiator bears a group distinguishable from the monomers, by NMR spectroscopy or other customary methods.<br>
The present invention therefore also provides for the preparation of novel oligomers, cooii-gomers, polymers or copolymers, for example random block, multiblock, star or gradient copolymers.<br>
The polymers which can be prepared by the process of the invention and the compositions of the present invention can be used for a variety of applications in process technology, e.g. as adhesives, laundry detergent auxiliaries, detergents, dispersants, emulsifiers, surfactants, antifoams, adhesion promoters, corrosion inhibitors, viscosity improvers, lubricants, flow improvers, thickeners, crosslinkers, as additives for water treatment, electronic materials, paints and varnishes, coatings, inks, photographic developers, superabsorbents, cosmetics, preservatives or as biocides or modifiers and auxiliaries for asphalt, textiles, ceramic and wood.<br>
The invention further provides a generally applicable, inventive process for lowering the molecular weight of polypropylene, propylene copolymers or polypropylene blends using either the above-described novel compounds or known hydroxylamines esters, wherein the hydroxy group is esterified by the defined acyl radicals Ra.<br>
The controlled preparation of polyolefin grades (polymer types having different molar masses, meit viscosities, densities, molar mass distributions, etc.) by customary compounding methods, for example by extrusion or injection moulding, is a process employed by polymer manufacturers and polymer processors/ compounders.<br>
The setting of the desired parameters, for example the meit viscosity, by means of this polymer process step is critically dependent on the controlled reactivity and mode of action of the additives employed.<br>
The use of free-radical formers for modifying the melt viscosity (rheology) of polyolefins is a generally known method. Whether it results in a lowering of the molecular weight<br><br>
(degradation) or an increase in the molecular weight (crosslinking) depends primarily on the chemical structure of the poiyolefin.<br>
The reaction cf a polymer of the polypropylene type with a free-radical former during a polymer-processing process generally results in a polymer degradation whereas polymers of the   . polyethylene type tend to crosslinking. Examples which may be mentioned here are polyethylene types which are obtainable by means of Phillips catalysts (LDPE) or metallocene catalysts (LLDPE). Exceptions are the polyethylene types prepared by the Ziegler process, which likewise tend to undergo chain degradation when processed in the presence of free-radical formers.<br>
In the case of copolymers and terpolymers or copolymer blends, high proportions of propylene produce poiypropylene-like behaviour, while high proportions of ethylene result in polyethylene-like behaviour. If the abovementioned copolymers and terpolymers or copolymer blends comprise proportions of multiply unsaturated olefins, the probability of crosslinking decreases with decreasing concentration of free double bonds.<br>
The controlled degradation of polypropylene (PP) to give a product having a lower molecular weight and a narrower molecular weight distribution is a commercially important process for. producing 'controlled rheology' polypropylene (CR-PP). While specific PP grades ("reactor grades") are obtainable by optimization of the synthesis process or the catalyst systems (metallocene catalyst, Ziegler catalyst), standard PP grades are frequently modified in process technology by means of a processing step following the synthesis.<br>
Known degradation processes proceed either thermally, in particular at temperatures above 280Â°C, or in the presence of free-radical generators. In process technology, the free-radical-induced process is carried out in extruders or injection-moulding machines at temperatures above 180CC. Free-radical generators used are organic peroxides which are added during the processing step in diluted form (PP Mastermix, diluted in oil, stabilized on inorganic supports) or directly as a liquid. Under the given processing conditions, the peroxide disintegrates into free radicals which initiate the chain cleavage reactions and form polymers having the desired rheological properties (melt viscosities). The degradation of a PP to form a product having a lower molecular weight (higher melt flow rate (MFR)) is generally referred to as a viscosity-breaking or vis-breaking process.<br>
CR-PP grades are mainly used for fibre applications and injection-moulding applications in which low melt viscosities are a prerequisite for economical processing.-A wide range of melt viscosities or molecular weights is nowadays required in process technology.<br><br>
A further parameter which, in addition to the molecular weight, influences the processing behaviour of the polymer is the molecular weight distribution (MWD). Whiie polymer grades having broad MWDs display improved orientation behaviour of the polymer chains at low pull off speeds in a fibre spinning process, the reverse is the case for high pull off speeds and broad MWDs. For this reason, narrow MWDs are essential at high pull off speeds in order to achieve improved continuity in the spinning process.<br>
The use of peroxides is a drawback, since only a restricted "processing temperature window" is available because of their decomposition temperatures, which are generally below the customary temperatures of polymer processing. In addition, strict safety regulations have to be adhered to during storage, handling and processing of peroxides. A further disadvantage of peroxides is the impossibility of decomposition-free melt compounding with polymers.<br>
Apart from peroxides, other sources of free radicals are also known, e.g. C-radical generators based on cumyl systems, but these can be used only at temperatures above 280Â°C. WO 97/49737describes a process for reducing the molecular weight of polymers at temperatures above 280Â°C using NOR-HALS compounds containing the group:<br>
CH3 G1<br>
-o-/J
where G is hydrogen or methyl and Gi and G2 are each hydrogen, methyl or are together oxo. These known NOR-HALS compounds produce appreciable polymer degradation only at temperatures above 280Â°C. Since most polymers are processed below this temperature at 160-280Â°C, there is a particular need for compounds which can be used at correspondingly lower temperatures.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide compounds which are suitable for processes for preparing CR-PP and which solve the problems associated with the unfavourably high process temperatures or the use of peroxides, e.g. safety problems.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that open-chain and cyclic hydroxylamines of various structures are particularly suitable as free-radical formers if they are esterified by acyl radicals on the &gt;NO-H group.<br><br>
The invention also relates to process for reducing the molecular weight of polypropylene, propylene copolymers or polypropylene blends, characterised in that at least one hydroxylamine ester or a^polymer of a hydroxylamine ester of the formula:<br><br>
Ra* is a monoacyl or diacyi radical;<br>
R, - R4 are each CrC6alkyi; and<br>
R5 and R6 are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, CrC6alkyl or C6-C10aryl; or<br>
R5 and R6 are together oxygen,<br>
is added to the polypropylene, propylene copolymer or polypropylene blend to be degraded and the mixture is heated.<br>
Preference is given to the process using compounds (I), in which Ra is C2-CiaalkanoyI or C3-C6alkenoyl.<br><br>
When Ra( is a monoacyl radical, hydroxylamine esters (I) are monomeric or dimeric structures. Thus, dimeric structures have suitable bivalent substituents in the 4-position and these are in turn substituted in the terminal position by compounds (I) via their 4-position (a,co-substitution).<br>
The term hydroxylamine ester encompasses both monomeric and oiigomeric compounds and also polymers formed by compounds of the formula I.<br><br>
A diacyl radical Ra' may be, for example, the diacyl radical derived from a monobasic organic acid having C radicals and two acid functions, e.g. a diacyl radical derived from an aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid.<br>
Suitable aliphatic dicarboxylic acids have from 2 to 40 C-atoms, e.g. oxalic acid, malonic acid, dimethylmalonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, adipic acid, trimethyladipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid and dimeric acid (dimerization products of unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids such as oleic acid), alkylated malonic and succinic acids, e.g. octadecylsuc-cinic acid.<br>
Suitable cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids are, for example, 1,3-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxyiic acid, 1,3- and 1,4-(dicarboxymethyl)cyclohexane or 4,4'-dicycIohexyldicarboxylic acid.<br>
Suitable aromatic dicarboxylic acids are, for example, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, o-phthalic acid, and also 1,3-, 1,4-, 2,6- or 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-biphenyldi-carboxylic acid, bis(4-carboxyphenyl) sulfone, 4,4'-benzophenonedicarboxylic acid, 1,1,3-trimethyl-5-carboxy-3~(p-carboxylphenyl)indane, bis(4-carboxyphenyl) ether, bis(p-car-boxyphenyl) methane or bis(p-carboxyphenyl)ethane.<br>
Preference is given to aromatic dicarboxylic acids, in particular terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid.<br>
Further suitable dicarboxylic acids are ones containing -CO-NH- groups. These are described in DE-A-2,414,349. Also suitable are dicarboxylic acids containing N-heterocyclic rings, e.g. those derived from carboxyalkylated, carboxyphenylated or carboxylbenzylated monoamine-s-triazinedicarboxylic acids (cf. DE-A-2,121,184 and 2,533,675), monohydanto-ins or bishydantoins, halogenated or unhalogenated benzimidazoles or parabanic acid. The carboxyalkyl groups may contain from 3 to 20 C-atoms.<br>
When Ra' is a diacyl radical and a suitable functional group, e.g. hydroxy or amino, is present in the 4-position, compounds of the formula I are polymeric structures, e.g. polyesters, poly-esteramides, polyurethanes, polycarbonates or polyimide esters.<br>
The process is of particular importance when using compounds (I) belonging to the group consisting of sterically hindered amine derivatives, e.g. compounds of the formula:<br><br><br>

Polyesters of compounds of the formula I may also be, for example, copolymers of polyesters (IH) in which the group:<br><br><br>
is partially replaced by suitable diols, which are derived, for example, from aliphatic, cy-cloaliphatic or aromatic diols.<br>

It is also possible for the polyesters to be branched by means of small amounts, e.g. from 0.1 to 3 mol%, based on the dicarboxylic acids present, of more than Afunctional monomers (e.g. pentaerythritol, trimellitic acid, 1,3,5-tri(hydroxyphenyl)benzene, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid or 2-
Suitable aliphatic diols are linear and branched aliphatic glycols, in particular those having from 2 to 12, preferably from 2 to 6, C-atoms in the molecule, e.g. ethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propryIene glycol, 1,2-, 1,3-, 2,3- or 1,4-butanediol, pentyl glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,12-dodecanediol.<br>

The alkylenediols are preferably linear and contain, in particular, from 2 to 4 C-atoms.<br>
Preferred diols are alkylene diols, 1,4-dihydroxycyclohexane and 1,4-bis(hydroxyme-thyl)cyclohexane. Particular preference is given to ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,2-and 1,3-propylene glycol.<br>

  i<br><br><br><br>
The above-described hydroxylamine esters (I) are suitable for reducing the molecular weight of polypropylene, propylene copolymers and polypropylene blends during compounding, where they effect degradation of the polymer chains like the peroxides customarily used in the prior art.<br>
In the process for reducing the molecular weight (degradation process), the above-described hydroxylamine esters (I) are present in concentrations, based on the amount of polymers to be degraded, of from about 0.001 to 5.0% by weight, in particular from 0.01 to 2.0% by weight and particularly preferably from 0.02 to 1.0% by weight. The hydroxylamine esters (I) can be added as individual compounds or as mixtures to the polymer to be degraded.<br>
The polypropylene-type polymers to be degraded can encompass propylene homopolymers, propylene copolymers and polypropylene blends. Propylene copolymers may contain various proportions up to 90%, preferably up to 50%, of comonomers. Examples of comonomers are: olefins such as 1-olefins, e.g. ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene or 1-octene, isobutylene, cycloolefins, e.g. cyclopentene, cyciohexene, norbornene or ethylid-enenorbome, dienes such as butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, dicy-clopentadiene or norbornadiene; also acrylic acid derivatives and unsaturated carboxylic anhydrides such as maleic anhydride.<br>
Polypropylene blends which can be used are mixtures of polypropylene with polyolefins. Examples are blends of polypropylene with polyethylene selected from the group consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE), high molecular weight high density polyethylene (HMW HDPE), ultra high molecular weight high density polyethylene (UHMW HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density polyethylene (BLDPE) and ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymers (EPDM) containing small proportions of diene.<br>
While the sometimes volatile decomposition products (smoke) of peroxides can lead to discoloration or odour in the degraded polymers, very little discoloration and odour occur in the case of the polymers degraded by means of hydroxylamine esters (I).<br>
Incorporation into the polymers can be carried out, for example, by mixing the above-described hydroxylamine esters (I) or mixtures thereof and, if desired, further additives into the polymers using the methods customary in process technology.<br>
Incorporation can, alternatively, also be carried out at temperatures which do not yet cause decomposition of the polymers (latent compound). The polymers prepared in this way can subsequently be heated a second time and subjected to an elevated temperature for a sufficient period of time so that the desired polymer degradation occurs.<br><br>
The NOR-compounds (!) can also be added to the polymers to be degraded in the form of a masterbatch in which these compounds are present, for example, in a concentration of from about 1 to 25% by weight. The masterbatch (concentrate) can be produced at temperatures which do not yet cause decomposition of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
This provides a product which is defined by specific dosage amounts and may be compounded with other additives. The masterbatch can then be compounded with the polymer to be degraded at a temperature above the decomposition temperature of the hydroxy-lamine ester (i).<br>
The present invention therefore further provides a concentrate in which the compounds of the invention are present in a concentration of 1 - 25% by weight and which can be added to the polymer to be degraded. The desired product is thus obtainable in an advantageous two-stage process.<br>
In a specific embodiment, suitable additives, e.g. acidic earths, for example of the type Ful-catÂ®, zeolites, hydrotalcites or metal salts, e.g. of Ca, Fe, Zn or Cu, are added to the polymers to be degraded.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of metals in the oxidation state II aid the degrading action. Preference is therefore given to compositions which, in addition to the above-described NOR-compounds (I), further comprise 0,1-10 parts of metal salt per part of NOR-compound (!). Particular preference is given to concentrations of 0.5 -10 parts of metal salt selected from the group consisting of CaO, CaC03, ZnO, ZnC03l MgO, MgC03 or Mg(OH)2 per part of NOR-compound (I).<br>
Apart from the hydroxylamine esters, further additives can also be present in the polymer, e.g. light stabilizers of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine type which are known from the patent literature, e.g. US-A-4,619,956, EP-A-434 608, US-A-5,198,498, US-A-5,322,868, US-A-5,369,140, US-A-5,298,067, WO-94/18278, EP-A-704 437, GB-A-2,297,091 or WO-96/28431.<br>

i lyuiupviUAiuc,<br><br>
The abovementioned bisazo compounds, peroxides or hydroperoxides are added to the polymers to be degraded in amounts smaller than those customary when they are used alone in the processes of the prior art.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least 2 free-radical initiators having different decomposition temperatures are employed, so that the degradation of the polymers may occur in 2 stages. This process is also referred to as sequential degradation.<br>
Suitable compositions comprise, for example, the free-radical initiators of the invention and the abovementioned peroxides or a combination of the NOR-compounds described in WO 97/49737 and the hydroxylamine esters (I) described above.<br>
It is essential that the two decomposition temperatures are sufficiently apart for effecting to a 2-stage process. For example, a peroxide having a decomposition temperature in the range of about 180 - 220Â°C can be combined with a hydroxylamine ester (I) having a decomposition temperature in the range of about 240 - 280Â°C or a hydroxylamine ester (I) having a decomposition temperature in the range of about 240 - 280Â°C can be combined with an NOR-compound described in WO 97/49737 having a decomposition temperature above 300Â°C.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the degradation is advantageously be carried out in the presence of small amounts of free nitroxyl radicals. A more readily controllable degradation of the polymer is achieved, which leads to more constant melting properties. Suitable nitroxyl radicals are known and described in US-A-4,581,429 or EP-A-621 878. Open-chain structures are described in WO 99/03894 and WO 00/07981. Furthermore, NO-derivatives of the piperidine type are described in WO 99/67298 and in British Patent Specification 2,335,190. Other NO-derivatives of heterocyclic compounds are described in British Patent Specification 2,342,649.<br>

A particularly preferred embodiment relates to the process for reducing the molecular weight of polypropylene, propylene copolymers or polypropylene blends in which at least one of the abovementioned novel compounds a) - d) is added to these and the mixture is heated to temperatures below 280Â°C.<br>
The invention further provides a process for achieving a controlled increase in the molecular weight or crosslinking of polyethylenes, e.g. low density polyethylene (LDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density polyethylene (BLDPE) or polyethylenes produced using Phillips catalysts or polyethylene blends with polypropylene, propylene copolymers or polypropylene blends both using the above-described novel compounds and also using known hydroxylamine esters (I), in which the hydroxy group is esterified by the above-defined acyl radicals Ra.<br>
A further advantageous property of the hydroxylamine esters (I) useful in process technology is their suitability for crosslinking polyethylene. The high molecular weight polyolefin grades required for pipe and cable production are synthesized mainly by crosslinking using peroxides [H. Domininghaus, Die Kunststoffe undihre Eigenschaften, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 5th edition, 1998, Chapter 2.1.1, pp. 156-159], e.g. Engel process: RAM extrusion with addition of peroxides; Sioplas process: peroxide-initiated grafting of vinylsilanes and subsequent crosslinking by means of water. If the desired parameters, for example the melt viscosity, are set by means of a polymer processing step, controlled reactivity and mode of action of the additives/additive systems added is essential for a successful reaction. While processing<br><br>
aids, e.g. polyethylene waxes, fiuorinated polymers, metal soaps, fatty acid esters, etc., and fillers do not significantly influence the molecular weight and thus the processing behaviour of the polymers, crosslinking reactions with peroxides, multiply unsaturated olefins or unsaturated polymers generally present processing problems, e.g. very high melt viscosities, gel formation, etc., see above. Furthermore, reaction products of the peroxide and peroxide residues can cause a deterioration in the long-term stability of the polymers. Safety aspects in polymer processing with addition of peroxides also play an important role.<br>
There is therefore a need for a simple-to-handle, effective additive system which allows controlled crosslinking, e.g. the targeted setting of the melt viscosity as a measure of the molecular weight, during polymer processing and which solves the problems associated with the use of peroxides as free-radical generators.<br>
it has surprisingly been found that both the above-described novel compounds and also known hydroxylamine esters (I) in which the hydroxy group is esterified by the defined acyl radicals Ra are suitable for achieving a controlled increase in the molecular weight/crosslinking of polyethylenes, e.g. low density polyethylene (LDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density poly ethylene (BLDPE) or polyethylenes prepared using Phillips catalysts or polyethylene blends.<br>
In the case of copolymers and terpolymers or copolymer blends, high proportions of ethylene result in polyethylene-like behaviour, while high proportions of propylene result in polypropylene-like behaviour. If the abovementioned copolymers and terpolymers or copolymer blends contain proportions of multiply unsaturated olefins, the probability of crosslinking increases with increasing concentration of free double bonds.<br><br><br><br>
Particularly preferred processing machines are single-screw extruders, corotatrng and counterrotating twin-screw extruders, planetary gear extruders, ring extruders or co-kneaders provided with at least one gas removal compartment to which a vacuum can be applied.<br><br>
Suitable extruders and kneaders are described, inter alia, in the abovementioned Handbuch der Kunststoffextrusion, Vol. 1,pp. 3-7.<br>
If a plurality of components are added, these can be premixed or added individually.<br>
The polymers are subjected to an elevated temperature for a sufficient period of time for the desired degradation to occur. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, a temperature range from about 160Â°C to 300Â°C is employed. In a particularly preferred process variant, the temperature range from about 170Â°C to 280Â°C, in particular about 180-240Â°C, is used.<br>
The period of time necessary for increasing the molecular weight or crosslinking can vary as a function of temperature, the amount of material whose molecular weight is to be increased and the type of any extruder employed. It is usually from about 10 seconds to 20 minutes, in particular from 20 seconds to 10 minutes.<br>
The above-described hydroxylamine esters (I) are suitable for increasing the molecular weight of branched polyethylenes and polyethylene blends during compounding, where they, like the peroxides customarily used according to the prior art, effect crosslinking of the polymer chains.<br>
In the process for increasing the molecular weight (crosslinking) of polyethylenes, the hydroxylamine esters (I) are present in concentrations of from about 0.01 to 10.0% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 5.0% by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 3.0% by weight and particularly preferably from 0.1 to 2.0% by weight, based on the amount of polymer whose molecular weight is to be increased.<br>
Suitable polymers of the polyethylene type are, for example, high density polyethylene (HOPE), high molecular weight high density polyethylene (HMW HDPE), ultrahigh molecular weight high density polyethylene (UHMW HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density polyethylene (BLDPE) or polyethylenes and ethylene copolymers prepared using Phillips catalysts and polyethylene blends. Ethylene copolymers can in this case contain differing proportions of comonomers. Examples which may be mentioned are: 1-olefins such as pro-pene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene or isobutylene, styrene, cycloole-fins such as cyclopentene, cyclohexene or norbornene or dienes such as butadiene, iso-prene, 1,4-hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, dicyclopentadiene, norbornadiene or ethyiidenenor-bornene.<br>
Polyethylene blends are mixtures of polyethylenes with polyolefins. Examples are mixtures with polypropylene (PP), mixtures with various PE types, for example with: high density poly-<br><br>
ethylene (HOPE), high molecular weight high density polyethylene (HMW HDPE), ultrahigh molecular weight high density polyethylene (UHMW HDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density polyethylene (BLDPE) and, in particular, ethylene-propylene-diene ter-polymers (EPDM) containing high proportions of diene.<br>
Incorporation into the polymers can be carried out, for example, by mixing in the above-described novel or known hydroxylamine esters (I) or mixtures thereof and, if desired, further additives using methods customary in process technology.<br>
Alternatively, incorporation can be carried out at temperatures which do not yet cause decomposition of the compounds used according to the invention (latent compound). The polymers prepared in this way can subsequently be heated a second time and subjected to " an elevated temperature for a sufficient period of time for the desired increase in the molecular weight of the polymer (crosslinking) to occur.<br>
The compounds can also be added in the form of a masterbatch containing these compounds in a concentration of, for example, from about 1 to 25% by weight to the polymers whose molecular weight is to be increased. The masterbatch (concentrate) can be prepared at temperatures which do not yet cause crosslinking of the compounds used according to the invention.<br>
In a specific embodiment, additives and/or stabilizers as are described above for the process for degrading polypropylenes can be added to the polymer whose molecular weight is to be increased.<br>
In a further specific embodiment, a source of free radicals, e.g. bisazo compounds, peroxides or hydroperoxides, as are described above for the process for degrading polypropylenes, can be added to the polymers whose molecular weight is to be increased in addition to the above-described hydroxylamine esters (I).<br>
The bisazo compounds, peroxides or hydroperoxides mentioned are added to the polymers whose molecular weight is to be increased in amounts smaller than those customary when they are used alone according to processes of the prior art.<br>
The above-described novel compounds can be prepared in a manner known per se. The preparation of these compounds is likewise the subject-matter of the invention and can be carried out, for example, by reacting an appropriate hydroxylamine of the formula:<br><br><br><br>

It is stirred for another 3 hours at 100Â°C cooled to 60Â°C and the residual monomer is evaporated in a high vacuum. After conversion of 8.0 g (80%) of the monomer, a clear, colourless, viscous liquid is obtained. GPC: Mn = 7 500, Mw= 157 500, PD = 21.0.<br>
B 7 Polymerization of n-butyiacrylate using the compound 152 at 145Â°C<br>
Starting mix: 1.5 mol% 152 in n-buty!acrylate (bulk)<br>
The clear solution is heated to 145Â°C under argon. An immediate, strong exothermic reaction is observed. After conversion of 68.5% of the monomer, a clear, colourless, viscous liquid is obtained. GPC: Mn = 28 525, PD = 3.55.<br>
B 7 Polymerization of n-butyiacrylate using the compound 152 at 100Â°C<br>
Starting mix: 1.5 mo!% 152 in n-butylacrylate (bulk)<br>
The clear solution is heated to 100Â°C under argon. After conversion of 5% of the monomer within 5 hours, a clear, colourless, viscous liquid is obtained. GPC: Mn = 3550, PD = 1.5.<br>
B 7 Polymerization of n-butylacrylate using the compound 139 at 145Â°C<br>
Starting mix: 1.5 mol% 152 in n-butylacrylate (bulk)<br>
The clear solution is heated to 145Â°C under argon. After conversion of 32% of the monomer within 3 hours, a clear, colourless, viscous liquid is obtained. GPC: Mn = 76 830, PD = 4.7.<br>
C) Controlled degradation of polypropylene by means of NOR compounds<br>
General procedure<br>
Unless stated otherwise, commercial polypropylene (ProfaxÂ® 6501, manufacturer: Montell) is<br>
extruded on a twin-screw extruder ZSK 25 from Werner &amp; Pfleiderer at a temperature of Tmax = 270Â°C (heating zones 1 - 6), a throughput of 4 kg/h and 100 rpm with addition of<br>
basic-level stabilization and the additives indicated in Tabfes 1-13, granulated in a water bath. The melt viscosity (MFR) is determined in accordance with ISO 1133. A large increase in the melt flow rate indicates substantial chain degradation.<br>
Under the processing conditions indicated, addition of an NOR compound results in the PP used undergoing increased degradation, which is reflected in higher MFR values compared with the starting polymer (or the comparative examples). In contrast to the alkylated hy-droxylamines, the hydroxylamine esters used according to the invention produce considera-<br><br>
bly greater polymer degradation (higher MFR values) at the same use.concentration. Unless stated otherwise, the additives are made up of the test compound and in each case 0.1% of IRGANOX B 225 and 0.05% of calcium stearate. IRGANOX B 225 is a 1:1 mixture of Irga-fosÂ®168 and IRGANOX 1010.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Preparation of concentrates<br><br><br><br>
The steps during extrusion are the same as in the general procedure. In the first extrusion step, the polymer is extruded at 230Â°C (heating zones 1 - 6, Tmax = 230Â°C) and granulated. The extrudate is subsequently extruded again at 270Â° C (heating zones 1 - 6, T^. 270CC; polypropylene ProfaxÂ® 6501, Montell). The melt viscosities after the two extrusion steps are listed in Table 9.<br><br><br><br>
Controlled degradation using further NOR compounds<br>
The steps in the extrusion are the same as in the general procedure (heating zones 1-6, Tmax: 250Â°C; polypropylene ProfaxÂ® 6501, Montell). The different amounts of additives mixed in result from a correction factor which takes account of the different molecular weights.<br><br>
The steps in the extrusion are the same as in the general procedure (heating zones 1-6, Tmax: 250Â°C; polypropylene ProfaxÂ® 6501, Montell). The addition of metal salts leads to improved MFR values at lower extrusion temperatures.<br><br><br>
D: Controlled increase in the molecular weight of polyethylene<br>
General procedure<br>
36 g of polyethylene (LupolenÂ® 1812 E, Elenac GmbH) are kneaded for 10 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere in a Brabender mixer W 50 maintained at 220Â°C (40 rpm). The additives are introduced into the mixing chamber at the beginning together with the polyethylene. After a reaction time of 10 minutes, mixing is stopped, the polymer composition is taken from<br><br>
the mixing chamber and prepressed at about 50 KN for 1 minute at 220Â°C. After comminution of the sample, the melt viscosity (MFR) is determined in accordance with ISO 1133.<br>
The polymer used suffers a molecular weight decrease (greater MFR than in the case of the starting material RY 653) under process conditions (no additive, Example D1). In contrast to the comparative example, an increase in the molecular weight, expressed by a decrease in the MFR value, occurs in the example according to the invention (D2).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
