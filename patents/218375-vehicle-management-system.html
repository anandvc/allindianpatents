				<td>The present invention relates to a vehicle management system for managing registration or history information of a vehicle during a period from production to disposal of the vehicle. [Background Art]<br>
A method for managing articles by use of a method in which secret identification information is communicated wirelessly, which is called RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification), has gradually become widespread. This is a method for managing, for instance, location and kind of products stocked by use of computers in such a way that, by attaching an RFID tag (also called an IC tag, a radio tag, an electronic tag and the like) onto the article or its package, which is a small size tag having an IC (Integrated Circuit) and means for transmitting and receiving radio signal embedded therein, information for identifying product classification and individual product in a distribution process of the article or the like can be read out from an 1C tag. [0003] -<br>
In addition, in Patent Document 1, there is disclosed a checking apparatus for checking stolen vehicles by sticking IC tags on vehicles.<br>
According to this invention, IC tags which wirelessly output unique registration numbers for respective bicycles are stuck to the bicycles, and a list of stolen vehicles showing the registration numbers of the stolen bicycles is stored in a database. A portable wireless terminal acquires a registration number from the IC tag stuck to the bicycle and checks the list of stolen vehicles on the database. The result of the checking is received by the source portable wireless terminal and displayed thereon. Accordingly, since the checking of vehicles can be performed efficiently, an effect of reducing the cost of antitheft measures is obtained.<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-170872-[Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0004]<br>

identify things including replacement of a vehicle part other than the part provided with theIC tag, such as an engine assy.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention is made in consideration of such a circumstance. An object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle management system which previously stores IDs of parts in the system, which constitute the vehicle and are expected to be changed, the system being capable of identifying the modification of the vehicle by checking IDs as needed. [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
This invention is made to solve the above described problem, and the present invention is a vehicle management system including a vehicle body ID marked on a vehicle and IC tags attached to parts constituting the vehicle, the IC tags being allowed to store the vehicle body ID, the vehicle management system identifying the vehicle by the vehicle body ID and being characterized in that: the IC tags are attached to a plurality of parts of the vehicle and store the respective part IDs of the plurality of parts; and the vehicle management system comprises storage means for storing the vehicle body ID and the part IDs with the part IDs associated with the vehicle body ID, and identification means for identifying the vehicle by the vehicle body ID and the part IDs stored in the storage means as well as the vehicle body ID and a plurality of part IDs read out from IC tags of the vehicle. [0007]<br>
According to  such a configuration,  coincidence  of the vehicle is checked by the vehicle body ID and the part IDs stored in external storage means as well as the vehicle body ID and a plurality of part IDs read out from IC tags of the vehicle. [0000]<br>
In  addition,  the  present  invention is  characterized  by further comprising   registration   means   for   registering   registration   or   history information of the vehicle. [0009]<br>
According  to   such   a   configuration,   the   registration   or  history information of the vehicle is registered in the external storage means.<br>
In addition, the present invention is characterized in that the IC tags storing the vehicle ID are storage means into which registration or history information of the vehicle can be written. [0011]<br>
According to such a configuration, it is made possible to rewrite and add the registration or history information of the vehicle in the IC tags. 40012]<br>
In addition, the present invention is characterized in that: an IC tag storing the vehicle ID is attached to a meter of the vehicle,' and the other IC tags are read-only storage means for storing only the respective part IDs.<br>
According to such a configuration, the rewriting of the part IDs is kept from being performed. [Effects of the Invention] [0014] -<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, coincidence of the vehicle is checked by the vehicle body ID and the part IDs stored in the external storage means as well as the vehicle body ID and a plurality of part IDs read out from IC tags of the vehicle.<br>
Thus, an effect is obtained, in which the reliability can be improved by recognizing a vehicle at two or more places to identify the vehicle. [0046]â€”<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the registration or history information of the vehicle is registered in the external storage means.<br>
Thus, an effect is obtained, in which the reliability of registration or production and selling history can be further improved by recognizing a vehicle at two or more places, i.e. the information which is managed together with the vehicle and the information which is managed separately from the vehicle, and by identifying the registration or production and selling history of the vehicle. [0010] <br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the registration or history information of the vehicle is rewritten and added in the IC tags storing the vehicle body ID.<br>
Accordingly, an effect is obtained that it is possible to manage the<br>
registration  or  history information  and  the  vehicle  body  ID  with the registration or history information associated with the vehicle body ID. [0017]<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the rewriting of the part IDs is kept from being performed.<br>
Accordingly, an effect is obtained, in which it is possible to prevent<br>
false recognition of a vehicle caused by the rewriting of the part IDs.<br>

The best mode for carrying out the present invention will be<br>
described below.<br>
[Example 1[<br>
With reference to the drawings, an embodiment of a vehicle<br>
of the present invention will be described below.<br>

Fig. 10 is a flowchart of processing and data in a disposal/recycle system function.<br>
Fig.  1 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a vehicle management system according to the embodiment.    In Fig.  1, reference numeral 10 denotes a vehicle information management server, and this vehicle information management server 10 therein includes-' a control unit 101   (input   means,   vehicle   body   ID   identification   means,   information management means);   and  a vehicle  information  database   102  (vehicle information  storage  means).     Moreover,  reference  numerals  20  denote terminals  provided,  respectively,  in  a vehicle  manufacturing facility,  a vehicle retailer, a vehicle repair shop, a gas station, a vehicle waste disposal enterprise,   customs,   a vehicle  user's  house  and the   like.     Note  that, according to need, an IC tag reader/writer (tag information read means) is connected to each of the terminals 20.    Thus, it is made possible to read and write information in a memory in an IC tag provided in a vehicle or in an IC tag embedded in a vehicle registration certificate.    Note that the waste disposal enterprise includes'  a discharging enterprise  which  discharges wastes,' a collector/transporter which collects/transports discharged wastes,' an   intermediate   treatment   enterprise   which   performs   intermediate treatment of wastes; a final disposal enterprise which performs final disposal after the intermediate treatment; and the like.    Reference numeral 21 denotes a portable terminal which is carried by a vehicle user, for example. Moreover, reference numeral 30 denotes a server of a vehicle sales website<br>
provided for selling vehicles by use of a so-called web interface via a communication network. 40020]-<br>
Reference numeral 80 denotes a communication network, through which the vehicle information management server 10, the terminals 20, the portable terminal 21 and the vehicle sales website server 30 can communicate with each other. Note that the portable terminal 21 can be connected to the communication network 80 via a portable telephone network 81. Here, the portable telephone network 81 and the communication network 80 are connected to each other via an unillustrated gateway device and the like. '[0021]<br>
In the vehicle information management server 10, the vehicle information database 102 retains management information related to each vehicle throughout its entire life cycle from a stage of shipping the vehicle from a factory to a stage of subjecting the vehicle to waste disposal. Moreover, as described later, the control unit 101 refers to data stored in the vehicle information database 102 and writes data into the vehicle information database 102 while exchanging data with the terminals 20, the portable terminal 21, the vehicle sales website server 30 and the like.<br>
Note that the vehicle information management server 10, the<br>
terminals 20 and the vehicle sales website server 30 are realized by use of a<br>
computer. Moreover, as the portable terminal 21, a portable telephone<br>
terminal (a mobile telephone terminal or a PHS (registered trademark,<br>
Personal Handyphone System) terminal), a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)<br>
or the like is used. Each of the devices described above includes a CPU<br>
(central processing unit) therein. Here, stages of processing performed by<br>
me respective devices are stored in a computer-readable recording medium<br>
ma form of a computer program. Accordingly, this program is read out and<br>
executed by the CPU and the foregoing processing is performed. Here, the<br>
computer-readable recording medium means a magnetic disk, a<br>
magneto-optical disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a semiconductor memory or<br>
the like. Moreover, this computer program may be dehveredia_to a computer<br>
through a communication line and a CPU provided in the computer which<br>
has received this delivery may execute the program.<br>
â€¢[0032]	<br>
Next, description will be given of means for identifying vehicles individually in the system of the present invention. A vehicle is marked with a vehicle body ID, and IC tags are fixed to parts constituting the vehicle during a period from production to disposal of the vehicle. This IC tag stores the vehicle ID in a semiconductor memory embedded therein. In this semiconductor memory, both of a re write -inhibited area and a rewritable area exist. In this rewrite -inhibited area, at least a vehicle ID for identifying a vehicle is previously written.<br>
[0023]<br>
With regard to the position to attach the IC tag 72, it is possible to provide the IC tag in a seat, for example, of a vehicle (such as a motorcycle, a four-wheeled vehicle, a bicycle, a personal water craft (PWC) and a four-wheel buggy). Since the seat is made of a resin member through which electromagnetic waves are transmitted, it is advantageous to attach the IC tag to the inside of the seat as described above in order to read and write the stored information of the IC tag by use of electromagnetic wave signals. Moreover, typically, the saddle-riding type vehicle has no metal roof or the like covering an upper side of the seat. Thus, for example, it is also possible to place theIC tag reader/writer above a vehicle stopping position or the like at a gas station, at a repair shop, in the road and the like, which is advantageous. Moreover, although the IC tag is fixed to the vehicle during the period from production to disposal of the vehicle, by providing the IC tag in the seat, there is an advantage that the IC tag is not easily detached therefrom.<br>
Note that, in the case of a vehicle having a metal roof, such as a passenger car, a bus and a truck, the IC tag is attached to the inside of the seat and a handheld reader/writer is carried into the vehicle, and thus, information of the IC tag is read out and written. Alternatively, the IC tag is attached to the vicinity of a front window or a rear window of the passenger car. For example, the IC tag may be attached to a dashboard portion and the IC tag may be read out and written from above outside of the vehicle. Moreover, the IC tag may also be attached into a resin member which forms the dashboard portion.<br>
Next, description will be given of a vehicle registration certificate (an ID card) used in the system of the present invention.    Fig. 2 is a schematic<br>
diagram showing one example of a face of the vehicle registration certificate. In Fig. 2, the vehicle registration certificate 50 is a certificate issued for each vehicle. As shown in Fig. 2, on a surface thereof, a type, a model year (indicated as "MODEL 2003"), a serial number, and a manufacturer's name of a target vehicle are listed. Moreover, a photograph of the vehicle is printed on or attached to the surface of the certificate. Moreover, reference numeral 72 denotes an IC tag embedded in the vehicle registration certificate 50. A semiconductor memory is embedded in this IC tag 72. In this semiconductor memory, both of a re write -inhibited area and a rewritable area exist.<br>
In the case where this vehicle registration certificate is used for checking against an IC tag fixed to a part, instead of a vehicle body ID marked on the vehicle body, information corresponding to theIC tag fixed to the part is written at a stated time, such as the time of issuance or selling.<br>
Note that it is assumed that the vehicle registration certificate described above is issued by a manufacturer of the vehicle, a public organization which manages vehicle registration, or the like. Moreover, this vehicle registration certificate has a size of about a 5.3 cm x 8.5 cm credit card, for example, and a material thereof is plastic or the like. 10025] -<br>
Next, description will be given of the information retained by the IC tags provided in the vehicle and the IC tag 72 embedded in the vehicle registration certificate 50. Fig. 3 is a schematic chart showing a structure of data stored in a memory in the IC tags described above. As shown in Fig. 3, in the memory, a rewrite-inhibited area and a rewritable area exist. In the rewrite-inhibited area, rewrite is inhibited by using a ROM (read only memory), for example. Alternatively, by a control function included in the IC tag, the rewrite-inhibited area is controlled so as not to be rewritten.<br>
In the rewrite-inhibited area, an IC tag type code and a vehicle ID are stored, and a spare area is further provided. The IC tag type code is code information for discriminating whether the IC tag is an IC tag provided in a vehicle or an IC tag provided in a vehicle registration certificate. The vehicle ID is code information for identifying vehicles individually.<br>
Moreover, in the rewritable area, owner data, part configuration data, vehicle history data, and waste manifest issuance data are stored, and a<br>
spare area is further provided.    As to these owner data, part configuration data, vehicle history data, and waste manifest issuance data, similar pieces of information are retained and managed also in the vehicle information database 102 which is storage means of the vehicle management system, as described  later.     In  the   system  of the  present  invention,   the  vehicle management server 10 and the terminals 20 can communicate with each other   through   the   communication   network   80    (registration   means constituted by these three parties).    Thus, according to need, data stored in the vehicle information database 102 (owner data, part configuration data, vehicle history data, and waste manifest issuance data) and data stored in the IC tag (owner data, part configuration data, vehicle history data, and waste manifest issuance data) are appropriately updated in synchronization with each other.    Moreover, since a storage capacity of the IC tag is limited, the vehicle information database 102 may have a full set of the respective data described above and the IC tag may have only a subset of the respective data.    It is preferable that a random access memory be used for theIC tag storing the vehicle body ID and the IC tag be provided in the meter or seat described above.    Particularly, this is effective in a motorcycle meter since motorcycle meters are often replaced. 40037] <br>
Next, with reference to Figs. 4 to 8, description will be given of the respective data retained by the vehicle information database 102 and a vehicle management process flow. Note that data shown in the drawings are also partially or entirely retained by the IC tag side for each vehicle.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic drawing showing a data structure of owner data included in the vehicle information database. As shown in Fig. 4, the owner data includes owner information associated with a vehicle ID. The owner information means information such as a name, a date of birth and an address of an owner.<br>
By use of the owner information, it is checked whether the owner of the vehicle of interest and the owner associated with the registration or history information on the vehicle information database 102 coincide with each other. Fig. 5 is a flowchart of the vehicle management process.<br>
In a terminal 20 in a retailer, when part IDs stored respectively in a plurality of IC tags 72 fixed respectively to a plurality of parts constituting<br>
the vehicle of interest during the period from production to disposal of the vehicle are inputted while a vehicle body ID marked on the body of the vehicle of interest is inputted (Step S12 of Fig. 5), the plurality of part IDs inputted from the IC tags 72 and the vehicle body ID marked on the vehicle body are transmitted to the vehicle information management server 10 through the communication network 80. It should be noted that, when a single IC tag among the plurality of IC tags includes the rewritable area and each of the other IC tags is made up of a ROM storing only the respective part IDs, it is made possible to inhibit the rewriting of part IDs.<br>
When receiving the plurality of part IDs inputted from the IC tags 72 and the vehicle body ID marked on the vehicle body, the vehicle information management server 10 identifies the vehicle on the basis of the respective plurality of part IDs inputted from the IC tags 72 (Step S13), and manages the registration or history information of the vehicle associated with this identification information by use of the vehicle information database 102. Specifically, the vehicle body ID identified on the basis of the plurality of part IDs and the vehicle body ID marked on the vehicle body are checked against each other (Step S15), and the registration or history information of the vehicle during the period from production to disposal of the vehicle is managed on the basis of the result of the checking.<br>
For example, if the result of the checking shows a disagreement (No in Step S16), the vehicle information management server 10 extracts the owner information indicating the owner of the vehicle of interest from the registration or history information of the vehicle associated with the identification information of the vehicle by use of the vehicle information database 102 (Step S18), and transmits the owner information to the terminal 20 of the retailer to check the owner (Step S19), or performs a process of checking the history of replacement of the parts.<br>
Accordingly, the checking of the owner can be performed on the retailer side.<br>
On the other hand, if the result of the checking shows an agreement (Yes in Step S16), the vehicle information management server 10 checks that the irregular replacement or the like has not been carried out, and transmits the certification result to the terminal 20 of the retailer.<br>
Accordingly, for example, in the selling of used cars and the recycling of parts, it is made possible to provide more reliable information.<br>
IC tags using inexpensive ROMs are preferably provided, for example, to engine parts or to various parts, such as wheels, swing arms, body frames, cushions, and units, which are expected to be replaced.<br>
In addition, as a modification example of this embodiment, it is possible to input information from the vehicle registration certificate 50 into which the information corresponding to the IC tags 72 fixed to parts is written, instead of inputting the vehicle body ID marked on the vehicle body. That is, the vehicle information management server 10 checks the information inputted from the IC tag 72 on the vehicle registration certificate 50 against the information inputted from IC tags 72 fixed to parts by use of the vehicle information database 102, and thus manages the registration or history information of the vehicle during the period from production to disposal of the vehicle on the basis of the result of the checking.<br>
Particularly in the IC tag 72 on the vehicle registration certificate 50, a retailer ID is written into it in addition to the identification information of the vehicle at the time of issuance of the vehicle registration certificate, so that the retailer ID is added to the history information for the checking (Step S17). Note that this retailer ID is also similarly added to the disposal time history to be described later.<br>
Thus, if the retailer ID is not added to the information inputted from the IC tag 72 on the vehicle registration certificate 50, the vehicle information management server 10 judges it to be an unauthorized access to the vehicle information database 102, and denies the access to the database. On the other hand, if the retailer ID is added to the information (Step S10), the server 10 judges it to be an access by the authorized person, and allows the access to the database (Step Sll).<br>
In this way, it is made possible to restrict the access to the vehicle information management server 10 to improve the information security against the unauthorized access.<br>
[0030]<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram showing a data structure of part configuration data included in the vehicle information database. As shown in the example of Fig. 6, the part configuration data retains information related to a part configuration for each vehicle (for each vehicle ID) as tree structure data. Reference codes N1 to N7 are nodes in this tree structure.<br>
The node Nl corresponds to a vehicle and includes data items such as a vehicle ID and a vehicle registration date. This vehicle is constituted of a part 01, a part 02, a part 03, ... and information related to these parts are stored in the nodes N2, N6 and N7, respectively. Moreover, a part configuration is hierarchical. For example, the part 01 is further constituted of a part 01-01, a part 01-02, a part 01-03, ... and information related to these parts are stored in the nodes N3 to N5, respectively. Each of the nodes N2 to N7 includes data items such as a part name indicating a name of a part, a part code for identifying a type of a part, a part serial number allocated for each individual part, a part lot number indicating a lot when a part is manufactured, a part manufacturing date indicating a date when a part is manufactured, a part attachment date indicating a date when a part is attached to a vehicle or a date when a part is attached to a high-order part, and a part attachment reason indicating a reason for attaching a part (events, for example, "new vehicle production," "replacement for repair" and the like).<br>
Note that Fig. 6 exemplifies the case where the number of part hierarchies is two.    However, there may be any number of hierarchies.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic diagram showing a data structure of vehicle history data included in the vehicle information database. As shown in the example of Fig. 7, the vehicle history data retains history information for each vehicle (for each vehicle ID) and includes at least data items of a date, a history summary, and a detail. Values of the history summary items are, for example, "new vehicle production," "owner, registration," "owner change," "fueling," "repair," "registration deletion," "waste manifest issuance" and the like. These history information described above are produced in the terminal 20 every time when the respective events occur. The information is written into the IC tag provided in the vehicle or the IC tag on the vehicle registration certificate according to need, and is transmitted to the control unit 101 from the terminal 20. The control unit 101 writes information into the database on the basis of the transmitted information.<br>
Note that, when the history summary is "new vehicle production," a manufacturer name and a factory name is written as detailed data. When the history summary is "owner registration," an owner name, an owner address and the like are written as detailed data. When the history<br>
summary is "fueling," information specifying a gas station, information on a quantity of fuel refilled and an odometer at the time of fueling and the like are written as detailed data. When the history summary is "repair," information on a repair shop name and repair detail and the like are written as detailed data. When the history summary is "owner change," a name of a new owner, an address of the new owner and the like are written as detailed data.<br>
Fig. 8 schematically shows waste manifest issuance data included in the vehicle information database. As shown in the example of Fig. 8, the waste manifest issuance data includes, for each vehicle (for each vehicle ID), data items such as a waste manifest issued flag, a waste disposal code, discharging enterprise information, collector/transporter information, intermediate treatment enterprise information, final disposal enterprise information, a public key of the discharging enterprise, a public key of the collector/transporter, a public key of the intermediate treatment enterprise and a public key of the final disposal enterprise. The waste manifest issued flag is information indicating whether or not a waste manifest is already issued. The waste disposal code is information indicating whether the waste manifest is issued in a form of paper or in an electronic form. Note that a secret key corresponding to each of the public keys is retained by a computer of each enterprise. Moreover, the enterprise at each stage (for example, the intermediate treatment enterprise) may be a plurality of enterprises in accordance with contents of the treatment. In this case, public key information for each enterprise is retained in the waste manifest issuance data.<br>
Fig. 9 is a schematic diagram showing a list of functions included in the control unit 101 of the vehicle information management server 10. As shown in Fig. 9, in this embodiment, the control unit 101 is broadly classified into (a) a vehicle life cycle management system function, (b) an arrangement system function and (c) a disposal/recycle system function.<br>
To be more specific, the vehicle life cycle management system function includes functions such as (l) new vehicle registration, (2) new vehicle sales (initial registration of owner), (3) import, (4) used vehicle transfer (registration of owner change), (5) export, (6) deletion of vehicle<br>
registration information (registration of discharging enterprise), (7) fueling, and (8) repair. Moreover, the arrangement system function includes functions such as (11) search for a stolen vehicle, (12) arrangement for a specific type of vehicle and specific parts, and (13) management of illegally abandoned vehicles. Moreover, the disposal/recycle system function includes functions such as (21) waste manifest issuance, (22) discharge management, (23) collection/transportation management, (24) intermediate treatment management, and (25) final disposal management. Hereinafter, general description of each of the functions will be given.<br>
(1)	The new vehicle registration function receives a vehicle ID of a<br>
new vehicle, part configuration data thereof and the like from the terminal<br>
20 of a vehicle manufacturing facility or the like, and registers data of the<br>
new  vehicle  in the  vehicle  information  database   102.     In  this  event,<br>
information to be written into an IC tag provided in a vehicle, an IC tag<br>
embedded in a vehicle registration certificate or the like is simultaneously<br>
produced.<br>
(2)	The new vehicle sales (initial registration of owner) function<br>
receives data such as name and address of an owner from the terminal 20 of<br>
a retailer, a vehicle sales website server 30 or the like and registers owner<br>
data of the vehicle information database 102.<br>
(3)	The import function performs processing similar to that of the<br>
used vehicle transfer to be described later in the case of import from a<br>
country (region) to be managed according to the vehicle management system.<br>
In the case of import from the other countries (regions), owner data and part<br>
configuration data are registered as those of a new vehicle and past history<br>
information is registered as vehicle history data.    Functions required for the<br>
processing of the import function are received from the terminal 20 of<br>
customs, for example.<br>
[0035]<br>
(4)	The   used  vehicle   transfer   (registration  of owner   change)<br>
function receives data such as name and address of an owner after transfer<br>
from the terminal 20 of a used vehicle retailer or the like, registers data of<br>
the new owner and adds vehicle history data in the vehicle information<br>
database 102.<br>
(5)	The export function performs processing similar to that of the<br>
above-described used vehicle transfer in the case of export to a country (region) to be managed according to the vehicle management system. In the case of export to the other countries (regions), owner data is updated or deleted and export records are added as vehicle history data. Functions required for the processing of the export function are received from the terminal 20 of customs, for example. [0036]<br>
(6)	The vehicle registration information deletion (registration of<br>
discharging enterprise) function adds information indicating registration<br>
deletion as vehicle history data, and performs processing of registering a<br>
discharging enterprise that is a first agent who contracts for waste disposal<br>
in the vehicle information database 102.<br>
(7)	The fueling function receives data related to fueling (fueling<br>
amount information, odometer information, gas station information and the<br>
like) from the terminal 20 of the gas station and performs processing of<br>
registering the received data as vehicle history data.<br>
(8)	The repair function receives data related to repair from the<br>
terminal 20 of a repair shop and registers the received data as vehicle<br>
history  data.     Moreover,  when replacement of parts  and the  like are<br>
performed   in   the   repair,   the   part   configuration   data   in   the   vehicle<br>
information database is also updated.<br>
{0037]	<br>
(11) The stolen vehicle search function performs search of a theft by use of a vehicle ID of interest in the case of a stolen vehicle or the like. Information on the search of a theft is transmitted to the terminals 20 of customs, repair shops, gas stations or the like. For example, the vehicle management system is adapted such that, in a gas station, at a position where the vehicle stops for fueling, a vehicle ID is read out from an IC tag provided in a vehicle, so that the vehicle ID read out from the IC tag of the vehicle can be compared to a vehicle ID in the information on the search of a theft. Moreover, when the both IDs coincide with each other as a result of the comparison, the fueling may be automatically cut off and information on a location of the gas station may be notified to the vehicle information management server side. Thus, it is made possible to relatively easily grasp the whereabouts of the stolen vehicle.<br>
(12)    In the case where life of a part of a specific lot is about to end or the like, for example, the specific vehicle-type/specific-part arrangement function   specifies   a   vehicle   having   the   part   by   searching   the   part configuration data in the vehicle information database  102, and obtains owner data of the vehicle.    Thus, it is made possible to send guidance of part replacement and the like to the owner.    Moreover, in part of the vehicle history data, a history of receiving automobile inspections,  a history of replacing parts such as tires,  a history of performing maintenance and inspections and the like may be included, so that, on the basis of the vehicle history data described above, when a predetermined period of time has passed since the last automobile inspection, part replacement, inspection or the like, it is possible to send guidance of next automobile inspection, part replacement, inspection or the like.    The guidance described above may be mailed to the address of the owner or may be sent by e-mail to an e-mail address which is retained as the owner data.    Moreover, besides the case of the life of the part, in a part having built-in control means by software, for example, guidance may be sent to the owner for function addition and the like of the software.<br>
(13) The illegally abandoned vehicle management function outputs information related to an illegally abandoned vehicle. For example, when an illegally abandoned vehicle is found, a vehicle ID is read out from an 1C tag provided in the vehicle by use of a handheld terminal device or the like (portable terminal device) at the scene of abandonment. Thereafter, on the basis of this vehicle ID, the control unit 101 read outs vehicle history data and owner jjata of the relevant vehicle from the vehicle information database 102. Moreover, if the registration of the vehicle has already been deleted and the vehicle has already been subjected to waste disposal, the illegally abandoned vehicle management function tracks the status of waste disposal on the basis of the data written in the vehicle information database 102 by the disposal/recycle system function to be described later.<br>
Next, the disposal/recycle system function will be described. Fig. 10 is a schematic diagram showing processing and a data flow in the disposal/recycle system function. In Fig. 10, discharge management, collection/transportation management, intermediate treatment management and final disposal management are functions included in the control unit 101.<br>
Note that as for the processing shown in Fig. 10, it is assumed that an electronic waste manifest has already been issued. Specifically, when the processing of the vehicle registration information deletion is performed, processing of waste manifest issuance is performed in conjunction therewith and a waste manifest as electronic data (waste manifest data) is recorded in the vehicle information database 102. A vehicle ID is included in this waste manifest data, and the waste manifest data and another data in the vehicle information database are associated with each other by use of this vehicle ID. Note that, instead of retaining the waste manifest data in the vehicle information database 102, the waste manifest data may be recorded and retained in another storage region in the vehicle information management server 10 or in a recording medium (not shown) such as a magnetic disk in another computer.<br>
The above-described functions will be described below along the flow of Fig. 10. First, the discharge management function included in the control unit 101 reads out a vehicle ID of a vehicle as a target of disposal from the vehicle information database 102, and adds discharge information (including information related to the discharging enterprise) (Step S110). Thereafter, this vehicle ID and information including the discharge information are transmitted to the terminal 20 of the discharging enterprise through the communication network 80, and encrypting thereof is requested. This information is encrypted at the discharging enterprise side by use of a secret key of the discharging enterprise and returned to the discharge management function of the control unit 101. The discharge management function writes the returned information after encryption in the vehicle information database 102 as discharging enterprise information, and also writes a public key of the discharging enterprise in the vehicle information database 102 (Step Sill).<br>
Next, the collection/transportation management function included in the control unit 101 reads out the discharging enterprise information from the vehicle information database 102, and adds collection/transportation information (including information related to the collector/transporter) (Step S120). Thereafter, this information after the adding of information is transmitted to the terminal 20 of the collector/transporter through the communication network 80, and encrypting thereof is requested. This<br>
information is encrypted at the collector/transporter side by use of a secret key of the collector/transporter and returned to the collection/transportation management function of the control unit 101. The collection/transportation management function writes the returned information after encryption in the vehicle information database 102 as collector/transporter information, and also writes a public key of the collector/transporter in the vehicle information database 102 (Step S121).<br>
Next, the intermediate treatment management function included in the control unit 101 reads out the collector/transporter information from the vehicle   information   database   102,   and   adds   intermediate   treatment information (including information related to the intermediate treatment enterprise) (Step S130).    Thereafter, this information after the adding of information is transmitted to the terminal 20 of the intermediate treatment enterprise through the communication network 80, and encrypting thereof is requested.    This information is encrypted at the intermediate treatment enterprise  side  by  use  of a  secret  key of the  intermediate  treatment enterprise   and   returned   to   the   intermediate   treatment   management function of the control unit 101.    The intermediate treatment management function writes the returned information after encryption in the vehicle information database 102 as intermediate treatment enterprise information, and also writes a public key of the intermediate treatment enterprise in the vehicle information database 102 (Step S131).<br>
Next, the final disposal management function included in the control unit 101 reads out the intermediate treatment enterprise information from the vehicle information database 102, and adds final disposal information (including information related to the final disposal enterprise) (Step S140). Thereafter, this information after the adding of information is transmitted to the terminal 20 of the final disposal enterprise through the communication network 80, and encrypting thereof is requested. This information is encrypted at the final disposal enterprise side by use of a secret key of the final disposal enterprise and returned to the final disposal management function of the control unit 101. The final disposal management function writes the returned information after encryption in the vehicle information database 102 as final disposal enterprise information, and also writes a public key of the final disposal enterprise in the vehicle information database<br>
102 (Step S141). [0042]<br>
As described above, the processing from the Steps S110 to S141 is performed in accordance with the respective stages of the waste disposal, and information of wastes is managed. Thus, information related to the status of the waste disposal can be collectively managed. Moreover, this information is encrypted by use of the secret keys of the respective enterprises. Thus, by decrypting the information by use of corresponding public keys, the information can be surely ensured to be information added by the enterprises. In addition, information sufficient to accurately track the process of the waste disposal can be retained in the vehicle information database. Moreover, the information related to the waste disposal is associated with the vehicle ID of the vehicle of interest, and the vehicle ID corresponds to the vehicle ID written in the 1C tag provided in the vehicle registration certificate or in the vehicle itself. Thus, it is possible to surely identify an individual vehicle which has become a target of waste disposal.<br>
Note that, in the example of Fig. 10, it is assumed that the processing is performed in the order from the discharging enterprise to the collector/transporter to the intermediate treatment enterprise and to the final disposal enterprise. However, the processing is not always necessary to be performed in this order. It is sufficient that the information of the enterprises of the disposal/recycle system be added while being encrypted in stages. For example, a single enterprise may collectively perform both of the collection/transportation and the intermediate treatment, the intermediate treatment may be further divided into a plurality of stages by a plurality of enterprises, or the disposal enterprises may be divided according to materials included in wastes and the like. 400433â€”<br>
The vehicle information management server 10, the terminals 20, the portable terminal 21, the vehicle sales website server 30 and the like, all of which are described above, include a computer system therein, respectively. Each of the processes of the processing of the vehicle information management described above is stored in a computer-readable recording medium-in-a. form .of a program. Accordingly, this program is read out and executed by a computer to perform the foregoing processing. Here, the computer-readable recording medium means a magnetic disk, a<br>
magneto-optical disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a semiconductor memory or the like. Moreover, this computer program may be delivered to the computer through a communication line, and a computer which has received this delivery may execute the program.<br>
