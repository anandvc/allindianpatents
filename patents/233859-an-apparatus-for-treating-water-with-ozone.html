				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR TREATING WATER WITH OZONE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for treating water with ozone, particularly for drinking<br>
water and ice making.<br>
It has been well known for many years that water can be purified of harmful organisms by<br>
treating it with ozone. However, there is a problem in trying to dissolve ozone in the water to<br>
purify it and yet not discharge a significant portion of unreacted ozone from the water, thus<br>
wasting it and potentially creating a health hazard.<br>
Four types of gas-liquid contactors have been used for this purpose including spray towers, where<br>
liquid is dispersed in a gas, packed beds, bubble plates or sieve towers, and finally units for<br>
dispersing gas bubbles in a liquid.<br>
Many of the apparatuses have been designed for industrial purposes, but are not well adapted for<br>
use where a relatively compact unit is required for the continuous production of purified water,<br>
such as in association with an in-store ice maker or an in-home water purifier.<br>
The use of loop reactors for processes involving liquids and gases has been suggested in such<br>
earlier references as U.S. Pat. No. 3,562,349 to Pawloski. In this reference, a pump circulates<br>
liquid about a closed loop with inlets and outlets including a gas outlet at the top of the unit.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,252,654 to Leitzke relates specifically to treating water with ozone. Here the<br>
water circulated about the loop is split into separate paths for treatment. Only a portion of the<br>
total flow of water is treated with ozone by one pass only about the loop. A packed column is<br>
employed with a portion of the water sprayed from the top.<br>
Another apparatus for treating water with ozone by circulating it about a loop is shown in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 3,945,918 to Kirk. There is a turbulent zone for mixing the water with ozone as well the<br>
setting up of a counterflow of ozone through the water.<br>
My earlier United States Patent No. 5,174,905 discloses a significantly improved ozonator<br>
compared with the prior art. However, the efficiency of this ozonator is limited by the maximum<br>
flow of water therethrough. It has been found that the flow restriction is due to a number of<br>
factors. One of these is the configuration of the restrictor employed for diverting water from the<br>
first conduit to the second conduit. Another factor is that if flow was increased too much, the<br>
water discharged from the second conduit was expelled from the apparatus along with any excess<br>
ozone contained therein.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved ozonating apparatus which<br>
can handle a significantly larger volume flow of water through the ozonator compared with prior<br>
art devices of a similar size.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide an improved ozonating apparatus which better<br>
controls release of excess ozone therefrom.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide an improved ozonating apparatus which achieves a<br>
more laminar flow of water compared with prior art devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
In accordance with these objects, there is provided according to one aspect of the invention, an<br>
apparatus for treating water with ozone which includes a first conduit and a passageway for<br>
admitting ozone into the first conduit. There is a second conduit having a top, an inlet connected<br>
to the first conduit and an outlet. There is a third conduit having a top and a vertical portion<br>
extending downwardly adjacent to the outlet of the second conduit. The third conduit has a<br>
bottom with an outlet below the outlet of the second conduit. There is a passageway connecting<br>
the third conduit to the first conduit above the outlet of the second conduit. The passageway is<br>
sized to permit a reduced flow of water through the third conduit compared to the flow through<br>
the second conduit and provides means for ozone discharged from the outlet of the second<br>
conduit to rise through the vertical portion of the third conduit to increase dissolving of the ozone<br>
in the water. There is a pump with sufficient capacity to force a stream of water and undissolved<br>
ozone from the outlet of the second conduit so said stream reaches a point at least one-half the<br>
distance from the outlet of the second conduit to the outlet of the third conduit, but less than the<br>
distance from the outlet of the second conduit to the outlet of the third conduit, before the<br>
undissolved ozone circulates upwardly.<br>
The apparatus may include a restrictor for diverting water from the first conduit into the second<br>
conduit, the first conduit including an elbow connected to to the second conduit, the elbow of the<br>
first conduit having a curved interior with an inside radius, the restrictor having a curved interior<br>
which is aligned with the interior of the elbow of the first conduit and forms a smooth curve with<br>
the inside of the elbow of the first conduit adjacent to the inside radius.<br>
Preferably the apparatus forms a loop with a conduit extending from near the outlet of the second<br>
conduit to the pump.<br>
There may be an outlet for gas near the top of the loop.<br>
In a preferred form of the invention, the second conduit is inside the third conduit.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention an apparatus for treating water with ozone includes<br>
a first conduit with a passageway for admitting ozone into the first conduit. There is a second<br>
conduit having an inlet connected to the first conduit and an outlet. There is a third conduit<br>
having a top which is above the first and second conduits. The third conduit has a horizontal<br>
portion adjacent to the top and a vertical portion extending downwardly from the top.<br>
There is means for pumping water through the conduits. An ozone relief valve at the top of the<br>
third conduit is opened by an accumulation of ozone adjacent thereto.<br>
For example, the ozone relief valve may include a float mechanism having a float, the ozone<br>
relief valve being opened when the float drops.<br>
The invention offers significant advantages compared to the prior art. By positioning the outlet<br>
of the second conduit well above the outlet of the third conduit, the rate of pumping can be<br>
significantly increased. This leads to significantly increased ozonating capacity compared to the<br>
prior art. If the pumping rate had been increased in earlier apparatuses of the general type, this<br>
would have resulted in the undissolved ozone being directed through the outlet of the third<br>
conduit and back to the pump, causing cavitation and therefore pump dysfunction. Moving the<br>
outlet of the second conduit upwardly, compared to the prior art, allows a stream of water and<br>
undissolved ozone sufficient room to move downwardly so that the ozone can begin to bubble<br>
upwardly before reaching the outlet of the third conduit.<br>
Employing an ozone release valve actuated by afloat prevents an undesirable accumulation of<br>
undissolved ozone at the top of the apparatus which may occur with some prior art devices.<br>
Excess ozone is automatically bled off where it can be destroyed by activated carbon or similar<br>
utility substances.<br>
The stated above, preferably the restrictor has a curved interior which is aligned with the interior<br>
of the elbow of the first conduit and which forms a smooth curve with the inside of the elbow of<br>
the first conduit adjacent to the inside radius. This construction provides a much more laminar<br>
flow through the restrictor and accordingly allows a substantially increased pumping capacity.<br>
The increased pumping capacity leads to substantially increased ozonating capacity.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified, diagrammatic side elevation of an apparatus for treating water with ozone<br>
according to the invention partly in section;<br>
FIG. 2 is an enlarged fragmentary, sectional view of the restrictor thereof with adjacent portions<br>
of the first, second and third conduits thereof; and<br>
FIG. 3 is a side view of the apparatus.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, this illustrates an apparatus 10 for treating water with ozone. The apparatus<br>
is in the form of a continuous loop 12 and is made of a number of different conduits which are<br>
interconnected. Ozone resistant metal or plastic are suitable materials to use. Loop 12 has a first,<br>
vertical side 14, a second, vertical side 16, a horizontal bottom 18 and a horizontal top 20 in this<br>
preferred embodiment. Alternatively the bottom and / or top may be sloped. There is a<br>
circulator pump 22 at the bottom of the loop which is connected by conduit 23 to elbow 24 of a<br>
first conduit 26 at flanges 28 and 30. In this example the conduit 23 is part of pump 22. A<br>
Grundfos UP-15-42SF pump is used in this example, but others resistant to corrosion by ozone<br>
could be substituted. The first conduit 26 extends from flange 30 to, and including, a reducer 32<br>
at the top of side 14. The bottom portion thereof above elbow comprises a venturi 34 formed by<br>
a length of relatively small diameter pipe compared with the portion of the conduit above.<br>
An ozone inlet injector 36 is positioned on the venturi for admitting ozone into the water within<br>
loop 12. In this particular example a 3/4" Mazzei 584 injector is used, but others could be<br>
substituted depending on such factors as the flow rate. An expander connection 38 connects the<br>
venturi to pipe 40 above which, as stated, has a diameter larger than the venturi. A foraminous<br>
plate 42 extends across the interior of pipe 40 above the expander connection 38. The plate 42<br>
has a plurality of openings 44 therethrough.<br>
An elbow 46 is connected to the top of pipe 40 and connects side 14 of the loop with top 20<br>
thereof. Reducer 32 is located within the upper end of the elbow and is funnel-shaped inside.<br>
The reducer fits tightly within the interior of the elbow to connect it with smaller diameter<br>
second conduit 48. There is however a passageway 50 in the reducer 32, as seen in Figure 2,<br>
which communicates with the interior of third conduit 52. There is a similar bore-like<br>
passageway adjacent to passageway 50 in this example (not shown). Conduit 52 extends about<br>
the conduit 48 and is spaced - apart therefrom. It has a top 81 and a horizontal portion 83<br>
adjacent to the top.<br>
The reducer 32 butts up against interior shoulder 47 of elbow 46. The reducer has a curved<br>
interior surface 33 which aligns with inside curved surface 49 of the elbow at its inner radius. As<br>
may be observed, there is a smooth continuous curvature between surface 49 and surface 33.<br>
This results in a more laminar flow of fluid from elbow 46 to conduit 48 compared to the prior<br>
art and significantly increases the maximum flow through the apparatus.<br>
There is a socket 51 extending inwardly from smaller end 53 of the reducer. Conduit 48 fits<br>
snugly within the socket against shoulder 55. It may be observed that the surface 33 of the<br>
reducer is aligned with inside surface 57.1 of conduit 48, again leading to smooth, laminar flow.<br>
Conduit 52 fits within the annular space 61 between surface 59 inside the elbow and surface 63<br>
of the reducer. Conduit 52 butts up against shoulder 65 of the reducer.<br>
The second conduit 48 has an inlet 48.1 and extends across top 20 of the loop to elbow 54 which<br>
is connected to a vertical portion 56 of the conduit. The second conduit has an open end 58 at<br>
the bottom of vertical portion 56 which forms an outlet for the second conduit.<br>
The third conduit 52 has an elbow 60 extending about elbow 54 of the second conduit and which<br>
is connected to a vertical portion 62 of the third conduit as seen in Fig. 1. The elbow has a top<br>
end 85. Portion 62 extends below outlet 58 of the second conduit and is connected to a reducer<br>
64 which forms the lower part of the third conduit.<br>
Outlet 58 of the second conduit is located well above outlet 67 of the reducer 64. In this example<br>
the outlet 58 is above bottom end 69 of elbow 60. The exact position of outlet 58 will vary with<br>
different embodiments. However the position will generally vary between outlet end 71 of elbow<br>
54 and bottom end 69 of elbow 60.<br>
The loop 12 has an inside 13 and an outside 15. In this embodiment the outlet end 71 of elbow<br>
54 is eccentrically displaced, relative to the elbow of the third conduit, towards the inside 13 of<br>
the loop. As may be observed, both elbows 54 and 60 have inner sides 55 and 67 which are<br>
adjacent to the inside of the loop. This leaves a wide passageway 73 between outer side 57 of<br>
elbow 54 and outer side 75 of elbow 60 for the passage of gas as indicated by bubbles 77. The<br>
passage of these bubbles is therefore not blocked by the second conduit 48.<br>
Pump 22 has a sufficiently high output such that the water discharged from outlet 58 is forced<br>
downwardly through the vertical portion 62 of the third conduit as indicated by arrows 75. The<br>
stream of water containing undissolved bubbles of gas approaches, but does not reach outlet 67<br>
before circulating about the interior of vertical portion 62. Therefore the water containing<br>
undissolved gas is not recirculated back through the loop, causing cavitation of the pump.<br>
Instead, the gas separates from the gas / water mixture as the water flows down the vertical<br>
portion 62 of the third conduit as suggested by arrows 75.1, such that undissolved gas,<br>
represented by bubbles 77, can rise vertically. The stream of water containing undissolved gas<br>
from outlet 58 is propelled downwardly to a point 150. The exact position of this point will vary<br>
from embodiment to embodiment and according to flow rates and the like. However it should be<br>
as close as possible to the outlet 67 of reducer 64 without allowing undissolved gas to be<br>
propelled directly out of the outlet. In general the point 150 would be at least one-half of the<br>
distance from outlet 58 of the second conduit and the outlet 67 of the reducer 64, forming part of<br>
the third conduit. However the point must be less than the distance from the outlet of the second<br>
conduit to the outlet of the third conduit on the reducer.<br>
There is an opening 66 in third conduit 52 at the top of loop 20. Opening 66 communicates with<br>
an off gas control device 68 which serves as an outlet for gas leaving the apparatus. The opening<br>
66 has an interior thread in this example. A threaded plug 91 is fitted within the opening. An<br>
elbow 93 is connected to the plug. The elbow in turn is connected to a conduit 95 equipped with<br>
an orifice 97. In this example the orifice is 0.024". A valve 99, controlled by a solenoid 101, is<br>
located along conduit 95. The solenoid valve is controlled by a float 103. The float is equipped<br>
with magnets 107 and is vertically slidable on a shaft 109. A reed switch 111 is actuated when<br>
the magnets are adjacent to the reed switch. When the area adjacent to opening 66 of the third<br>
conduit becomes filled with gas, the float drops, triggering the reed switch and opening normally<br>
closed solenoid valve 99 to release the accumulated gas. Once excess ozone has been released,<br>
the float rises and the valve is again closed.<br>
Reducer 64 is connected to first inlet 71.1 of a T-fitting 70 on the top thereof. There is a second<br>
inlet 72 at the bottom of the T-fitting which is connected to a conduit 74 for untreated water.<br>
Conduit 74 in this embodiment is provided with a pressure control regulator 76 and an inlet<br>
solenoid 78. There is an outlet 84 on the side of T-fitting 70 which is connected to an outlet<br>
conduit 86 for treated water. Outlet 82 has a flange 92 which is connected to a flange 94 on<br>
pump 22, thus closing the loop.<br>
Some additional components are shown in Fig. 3. This shows an ozone destructor 150,<br>
containing activated carbon, which is connected to orifice 97 shown in Fig. 1. Other materials<br>
could be used instead of activated carbon. The figure also shows an ozone generator 152 which is<br>
connected to the ozone injector 36 by conduit 154. The conduit extends through a solenoid valve<br>
156 which prevents a flow of water back to the ozone generator when the unit is shut off.<br>
The materials used throughout must be resistant to corrosion or degradation caused by ozone.<br>
P.V.C., ABS plastic or 316 stainless steel are satisfactory, while aluminum, brass, steel, nylon,<br>
neoprene, PTFE and monels are not.<br>
OPERATION AND METHOD<br>
In operation, water to be treated enters the conduit 74 of the apparatus, typically from a water<br>
supply, as indicated at arrow 92. The untreated water passes through conduit 74 and is diverted<br>
by T-fitting 70 towards pump 22. The pump circulates the water about loop 12, first by pumping<br>
it towards venturi 34 as indicated by arrow 95. Ozone is added to the water in venturi 34 through<br>
ozone injector 36 as illustrated by arrow 96. Above the venturi the water and ozone are forced<br>
through openings 44 in plate 42 which serves to break up the ozone into smaller bubbles and<br>
dissolve the ozone in the water.<br>
Beyond elbow 46 the loop is bifurcated with two branches formed by second conduit 48 and third<br>
conduit 52. The reducer 32 diverts most of the flow of water and ozone from elbow 46 into the<br>
smaller conduit 48. This flow, illustrated by arrow 100, continues down the vertical portion 62<br>
of the third conduit.<br>
Passageway 50 in reducer 32 does permit a flow of water through third conduit 52 in the space<br>
between the third conduit and the second conduit as illustrated by the arrow 104 in Figure 2.<br>
This flow is brought about only by the amount of water passing through passageway 50, and<br>
therefore flows to the outlet 58 of the second conduit at a reduced linear velocity compared to the<br>
water in conduit 48.<br>
When the water is discharged from outlet 58 of the second conduit, it normally has undissolved<br>
gaseous ozone still contained therein. It is desirable to further dissolve this ozone in the water to<br>
further purify the water and to avoid waste of the ozone which requires treatment before<br>
discharging it for safety reasons. When the ozone is discharged from outlet 58, the momentum<br>
carries the stream of water containing undissolved gas bubbles to point 150. Since the gas is<br>
much lighter than the water, after reaching point 150, it therefore tends to rise in the liquid<br>
column contained in vertical portion 62 of third conduit 52 as illustrated by bubbles 77. This<br>
counterflow of ozone with respect to the flow of water in the third conduit is further illustrated<br>
by arrows 108 pointing upwardly in the third conduit. The gases, which include air with<br>
molecular oxygen as well as ozone, move upwardly. Undissolved gases eventually reach the top<br>
of the loop where they move through opening 66 to exit the apparatus when the float 103 drops<br>
as described above. As the gases move upwardly from outlet 58 of the second conduit to opening<br>
66, additional ozone is dissolved in the water.<br>
The water in the third conduit, and about the second conduit, moves downwardly, as shown by<br>
arrows 112, merges with the flow of water from the second conduit and enters T-fitting 70 as<br>
illustrated by arrow 100. The majority of the water, or all of it, is then recirculated back through<br>
the loop . However, a smaller proportion of the water, indicated by arrow 120, may be diverted<br>
into outlet conduit 86 according to demand. This is controlled by a valve (not shown) having an<br>
orifice which limits the volume of treated water exiting the system to ensure that only treated<br>
water is supplied. Thus it may be seen that the majority of water is recirculated about the loop<br>
through conduit 87 for further treatment to purify the water the required amount. In this example<br>
the conduit 87 is part of pump 22. Only a fraction of the water is removed through conduit 86<br>
when required on a continual basis as purified water illustrated by arrow 120. The amount of<br>
untreated water 92 entering the loop is the same as the amount of treated water leaving through<br>
conduit 86 once the loop has been filled to capacity.<br>
It will be appreciated by someone skilled in the art that many of the details provided above are<br>
given by way of example only and can be modified without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention which is to be determined from the following claims.<br>
