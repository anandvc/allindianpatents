				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a security paper for producing documents of value,<br>
such as bank notes, passports, ID cards or the like, which is provided with a coating<br>
ensuring longer fitness for circulation, and to a method for producing such a security<br>
paper.<br>
Bank notes are usually made of so-called security papers consisting of cotton<br>
fibers and having special security features, such as a security thread at least partly<br>
worked into the paper, and a watermark. The period of circulation of a bank note<br>
depends on the stress it is subjected to. Certain denominations are preferably used in<br>
trade and thus have a shorter period of circulation due to the greater impact of envi-<br>
ronmental influences. The principal cause for the restricted period of circulation of<br>
bank notes is deemed to be premature soiling. Since bank note paper is very porous<br>
it has a large surface area or high surface roughness. Even if the resulting projections<br>
and cavities are in orders of magnitude which cannot be resolved by the human eye,<br>
they offer ideal conditions for dirt deposits in comparison with a smooth surface.<br>
AU-PS 488,652 has therefore proposed making bank notes completely from a<br>
plastic substrate. However, in this case one must do without customary and proven<br>
security elements such as portrait watermarks and window security threads, as well<br>
as special properties such as the sound and feel of bank note paper. Also, the steel<br>
intaglio printing customary in bank notes, which serves as an additional tactile<br>
authenticity mark due to the relief resulting from the inking, merely leads to a flat,<br>
hardly perceptible relief on plastic substrates.<br>
The problem of the invention is therefore to produce a security paper which is<br>
dirt-repellent and therefore has a long period of circulation and which remains un-<br>
changed in its other typical properties, such as printability, sound, color, etc.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a security paper for producing<br>
documents of value, such as bank notes, passports, ID cards or the like, which is<br>
provided at least partly with a coating ensuring longer fitness for circulation, the<br>
coating being provided at least on one of the surfaces of the security paper,<br>
characterized in that the coating consists of a composition containing a polyamide<br>
lacquer or an acrylate system as the sole binder and no fillers and optionally one or<br>
more visually or machine testable additives for security features and/or codings.<br>
A binder within the meaning of the invention includes all substances which<br>
form insoluble films or structures in common solvents. The essential thing is that the<br>
binder, unlike customary coating materials, contains no fillers, i.e. pigments such as<br>
titanium dioxide, in high concentrations. This composition wets the fibers in the sur-<br>
face area of the paper, forming a complete surface film over the fiber. This mini-<br>
mizes the access of dirt to the fiber.<br>
The composition is applied in a layer thickness so as to form a sufficiently<br>
smooth surface and minimize the possibilities of dirt deposit, on the one hand. On<br>
the other hand, the layer thickness is so small as not to impair the other properties of<br>
the paper, such as its feel and printability. The weight per unit area of the coating is<br>
preferably about 1 to 6 g/m2, in particular 2 to 3 g/m2.<br>
The small coating thicknesses leave the transmission properties of the paper<br>
unchanged so that the recognizability of any portrait watermarks in the security pa-<br>
per is not impaired. The coating additionally has the advantage that one can do with-<br>
out the customary sizing of the paper. The kind of security paper is not subject to<br>
any conditions either, so that one can use customary security papers made of annual<br>
plant fibers, in particular cotton fibers, as well as security papers consisting at least<br>
partly of plastic fibers, preferably polyamide fibers.<br>
The binders used are preferably polyamide lacquers, acrylates or binder sys-<br>
tems containing a high percentage of acrylates. If the binder system has several<br>
polymer components, they can be present as a mixture or as copolymers. But one<br>
can fundamentally use other binder systems as well. Chemically or physically<br>
crosslinkable compositions have proved particularly useful.<br>
Particularly acrylate systems have a number of advantages over other binder<br>
systems, for example ones based on polyurethane. They thus have better printing<br>
properties and contain fundamentally less solvent so that their processing involves<br>
lower environmental impact. Acrylate coatings are in addition characterized by<br>
higher surface hardness so that the dirt-repellent effect is improved. Finally, acrylate<br>
systems offer the advantage of being considerably more cost-effective than other<br>
binder systems and being readily mixable with other polymers.<br>
The binder composition is knife-coated or printed on the paper after production<br>
of the latter. This can be done directly subsequent to papermaking in the paper ma-<br>
chine or in a separate operation, for example directly before printing the security<br>
paper. If required, the smoothness of the surface can subsequently be increased by<br>
corresponding calendering. The inventively coated paper offers an ideal printing sur-<br>
face for high print resolution and very good ink adhesion in case of attempted physi-<br>
cal and/or chemical attacks.<br>
Then the inventive security paper is printed and possibly processed further in<br>
accordance with the paper of value to be produced. A print or embossing, in par-<br>
ticular if produced by intaglio printing, leads to a rough surface again and therefore<br>
favors dirt deposits. In order to exclude this as well, it is proposed according to the<br>
invention that the print be covered with a further binder layer, e.g. lacquer layer. The<br>
lacquer layer is preferably adjusted in its composition to the inventive background<br>
layer to permit a good bond of the two layers. The bond might be improved by an<br>
additional crosslinking step. This can be done by the action of heat or irradiation<br>
(e.g. UV radiation). Since the print can be produced with any printing process, such<br>
as by steel intaglio or with a laser printer, it might be necessary to adapt the inven-<br>
tive binder composition to the printing process used in order to ensure not only low<br>
soiling but also improved adhesion of the inks to the substrate.<br>
A further advantage of the invention is that one can do without further pre-<br>
treatment of the inventive security paper when optically variable security elements<br>
are to be provided on the paper. Optically variable devices or inks showing a view-<br>
ing angle dependent interplay of colors due to diffraction or light interference re-<br>
quire a smooth background for good visibility of this effect. Security elements of this<br>
kind are for example holograms, kinegrams or other diffraction structures, as well as<br>
inks containing interference layer or liquid crystal pigments or other special-effect<br>
pigments such as glossy metallic-effect pigments.<br>
In special cases, however, it may still be useful to provide a further background<br>
layer in the area of said element. Liquid crystal pigments and interference layer pig-<br>
ments consisting only of thin mica plates coated with titanium dioxide are transpar-<br>
ent so that the color effect is not influenced by the smoothness alone but also by the<br>
color of the background. A black background absorbs light transmitted by the pig-<br>
ments, thereby increasing the brilliance of the colors reflected by the pigments. The<br>
same applies to security elements constructed of several thin layers and likewise<br>
showing an interplay of colors based on interference effects. For these and similar<br>
elements it may therefore be necessary to provide the security paper with a further<br>
background layer in the area of the security element to be applied.<br>
Alternatively, it may also be expedient to underlay the security element with a<br>
mechanically or visually detectable authenticity feature, as known for example from<br>
WO 97/35732.<br>
The inventive coating furthermore has an advantageous effect on other security<br>
elements. For example, it makes embossed structures more trenchant since the<br>
smoother background makes the embossings more prominent. Embossings are also<br>
more durable since not only the paper fibers are embossed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the coating composition additionally<br>
contains a low concentration of at least one substance with a visually and/or me-<br>
chanically detectable physical property. The substance can have for example mag-<br>
netic, electroconductive, diffractive, light-polarizing or light-interfering properties<br>
and be uniformly distributed all over the total coating or applied in the form of pat-<br>
terns. One thereby preferably, in a first step, prints a certain pattern of a composition<br>
containing small amounts in the manner of a doping (
stance with at least one visually and/or mechanically detectable physical property.<br>
Only in a second step does one apply the same composition but not containing the<br>
detectable additive to the remaining part of the surface of the paper in register with<br>
the first pattern.<br>
Said additives can be for example luminescent substances excitable with UV<br>
light and emitting in the visible spectral region. In the case of a machine check,<br>
however, one can also use luminescent substances emitting in the invisible spectral<br>
region, preferably the IR spectral region. One can likewise use photochromic or<br>
thermochromic additives.<br>
Instead of physically detectable substances one can also use chemically react-<br>
ing additives. For example, one can admix a component of a color reaction system to<br>
the binder composition and apply it to the paper. When one applies the second com-<br>
ponent of the color reaction system at a later time, a colored area, pattern, writing or<br>
the like becomes visible on the security paper. This can serve as an authenticity fea-<br>
ture or as a cancellation mark for a check, airplane ticket or the like.<br>
By using a plurality of additives and/or varying the concentration of one or<br>
more additives one can very simply produce any kind of coding, for example a bar<br>
code, on the security paper. Said coding can for example constitute an independent<br>
additional security feature or serve as a reference feature for other data already pro-<br>
vided on the security paper. Thus, information visible to the naked eye on the bank<br>
note, such as denomination, the name of a person shown in the portrait or the like,<br>
can be encrypted and stored on the paper in the form of the inventive coding invisi-<br>
ble to the naked eye. In a machine check the coding is read, decrypted and tested for<br>
identity with the corresponding information visible to the naked eye.<br>
According to the inventive principle one can of course also produce a plurality<br>
of different codings. For example, one applies the binder compositions containing<br>
the particular additive to the paper in the form of the desired codings simultaneously<br>
or successively. One prints or coats the remaining part of the paper surface with ad-<br>
ditive-free binder composition, as explained above. Alternatively, the different cod-<br>
ings can also be disposed on different surfaces-of the security paper. Double-sided<br>
coating with the same additive is of course likewise possible.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the inventive coating can also have gaps.<br>
Said gaps can have any form, e.g. a striped form. Before or after application of the<br>
inventive coating they are provided with a print having certain special-effect inks.<br>
Said special-effect inks may be interference layer pigments, liquid crystal pigments<br>
or other gloss pigments. Said print can cover the gaps all-over or only partly.<br>
The inventive security paper can for example also be used advantageously for<br>
producing ID cards and passports. Since it has increased tear strength and dirt resis-<br>
tance, one might possibly do without the customary lamination with plastic foils. If<br>
lamination is nevertheless effected, the inventive coating ensures a firm, inseparable<br>
bond between paper and cover layer.<br>
In the following some examples of the inventive composition will be explained.<br>
Example 1<br>
A bank note paper made of 100% cotton with a filler content of 3.0% is used<br>
for the coating test. The paper is adjusted to a wet strength of 50% based on the dry<br>
strength by using commercial melamine resin (e.g. Madurit MW167).<br>
The following formulation is used as the coating:<br>
Acronal 320D (BASF) 400 ml<br>
- aqueous dispersion of acrylic resin -<br>
Softened water 600 ml<br>
The mixture is prepared by stirring and applied to the surface of the paper. For<br>
this purpose one uses a rotating pair of rolls whose lower side dips into a dish with<br>
the diluted Acronal dispersion. Excess suspension is pressed off through the roll slit.<br>
• The paper is subsequently dried with a commercial photo drier.<br>
The treatment gives the paper the following properties:<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A paper is coated in the same way as stated in Example 1 with the following<br>
formulation:<br>
Neocryl-AC 72 (Zeneca) 900 ml<br>
- aqueous dispersion of acrylate -<br>
Water 80 ml<br>
Crosslinker CX 100 (Zeneca) 20 ml<br>
Example 3<br>
The paper can also be coated with the following binder composition:<br>
Primal 1-545 (Rohm &amp; Haas) 900 ml<br>
- aqueous dispersion of acrylate -<br>
Water 80 ml<br>
Zirconium carbonate (Auer Remy) 20 ml<br>
Example 4<br>
The inventive binder system can also consist of a mixture of several polymers.<br>
As an example the following formulation is stated:<br>
Glascol LS 26 (Ciba) 700 ml<br>
- aqueous dispersion of acrylate-styrene copolymer -<br>
Polyurethane U 400 N (Alberdink Boley) 200 ml<br>
Water ' 100 ml<br>
Further advantages and embodiments will be explained in more detail with ref-<br>
erence to the figures. It is pointed out that the figures show the layer structure of the<br>
inventive security paper only schematically.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive security paper from the front,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section along A - B through the inventive security paper ac-<br>
cording to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment of an inventive security paper from the<br>
front,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross section along A - B through the inventive security paper<br>
according to Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a detail of inventive security paper web 1 as is used for example<br>
for producing bank notes. Such security paper is usually made of cotton fibers or<br>
other annual plant fibers. For some applications, however, it may be useful to re-<br>
place part of said natural fibers by plastic fibers, in particular polyamide fibers. Pure<br>
plastic fiber papers are also possible. During production of paper web 1 individual<br>
security elements are already embedded in the paper, such as a portrait watermark or<br>
security thread 2 shown in Fig. 1. Security thread 2 is quasi woven into the paper so<br>
as to pass directly to the surface of the paper in areas 3 while being embedded com-<br>
pletely in paper pulp in the dash-lined areas. Thread 2 can be provided with any de-<br>
sired security features, such as an electroconductive, metallic layer, hologram or the<br>
like.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section through inventive security paper 1 along dash-dotted<br>
line A - B in Fig. 1. Inventive security paper 1 consists of raw paper 4 as usually<br>
leaves the paper machine, and inventive binder coating 5 which was knife-coated or<br>
printed all over a surface of security paper 1 according to the shown embodiment.<br>
Alternatively, coating 5 can also be applied to security paper 1 on both sides.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 show a further embodiment of inventive security paper 1. Fig. 4<br>
shows a section through inventive security paper 1 along dash-dotted line A - B in<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, security paper 1 likewise consists of customary paper web<br>
4 provided with a pure binder composition without fillers according to the invention.<br>
However, the binder layer is composed of different areas 6, 9. In areas 6 the binder<br>
composition is doped with an additive which is testable visually and/or mechani-<br>
cally, while remaining areas 9 of the binder composition contain no additive. As evi-<br>
dent from Fig. 3, area 6 represented by the doped binder composition forms visually<br>
readable information. Areas 7 likewise represented with the doped binder composi-<br>
tion form coding 8 in the form of a bar code.<br>
The additive may be for example a luminescent substance transparent in nor-<br>
mal illumination but emitting in the visible spectral region and thus showing an in-<br>
tensive tone when irradiated with UV light. In this case information 6, 8, as shown<br>
in Fig. 3, is visible only in UV illumination.<br>
However, one can also provide a plurality of additives which are singly detect-<br>
able. The mixture ratio of the additives can be used to produce an additional coding.<br>
It is likewise conceivable to produce information 6, 8 with different additives. Thus,<br>
one can produce information 6 with the aid of a luminescent substance emitting in<br>
the visible spectral region, as explained above, while representing bar code 8 with<br>
the aid of a substance detectable solely by machine, e.g. a luminescent substance<br>
emitting in the IR spectral region. Marks 6 visible to the naked eye in UV illumina-<br>
tion can represent for example a picture, pattern or readable information. Machine-<br>
readable code 8, however, could represent certain information characteristic of the<br>
individual document of value, optionally in encrypted form. Said information could<br>
be properties inherent to the paper material, such as transmission properties, thick-<br>
ness distribution, etc., or other information essential to the particular document of<br>
value, such as denomination or the like.<br>
