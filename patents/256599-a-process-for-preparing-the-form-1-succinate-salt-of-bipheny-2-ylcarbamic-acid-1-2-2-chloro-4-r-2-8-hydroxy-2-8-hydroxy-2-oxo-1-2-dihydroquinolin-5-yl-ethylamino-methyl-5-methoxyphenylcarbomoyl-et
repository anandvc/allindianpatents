BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel succinic acid salt of a biphenyl<br>
compound, in particular crystalline solid state forms of the succinic acid salt. The<br>
biphenyl compound is expected to be useful as a therapeutic agent for treating pulmonary<br>
disorders. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the salt<br>
or prepared from this salt, processes and intermediates for preparing the salt and methods<br>
of using the salt to treat a pulmonary disorder.<br>
State of the Art<br>
International Patent application no PCT/US2004/004449, publication no.WO<br>
2004/074246 A2 (Theravance Inc, South San Francisco, California, US) discloses novel<br>
biphenyl compounds that arc useful as therapeutic agents for treating pulmonary<br>
disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. In<br>
particular, the compound biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-<br>
2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-l ,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-<br>
methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester is specifically disclosed in these<br>
applications as possessing both muscarinic antagonist and 02 adrencrgic receptor agonist<br>
activity. The chemical structure of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-<br>

methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester is represented by formula T:<br><br><br>
Therapeutic agents useful for treating pulmonary disorders are advantageously<br>
administered directly into the respiratory tract by inhalation. In this regard, several types<br>
of pharmaceutical inhalation devices have been developed for administering therapeutic<br>
agents by inhalation, including dry powder inhalers (DPI), metercd-dose inhalers (MDI)<br>
and nebulizer inhalers. When preparing pharmaceutical compositions and formulations<br>
for use in such devices, it is highly desirable to have a crystalline form of the therapeutic<br>
agent that is neither hygroscopic nor deliquescent and which has a relatively high melting<br>
point (i.e. greater than about 150°C), thereby allowing the material to be micronized<br>
without significant decomposition or loss of erystallinity.<br>

readily determined by 1H NMR. Alternatively, elemental analysis can be used to<br>
determine the molar ratio.<br>

Succinic acid is commercially available from, for example, Sigma-Aldrch Co.<br>
Ltd., Gillingham, UK. In one embodiment, the succinic acid has a purity greater than or<br>
equal to 99% (as determined by HPLC).<br>
A crystalline salt of this invention may be prepared by contacting biphenyl-2-<br>
ylcarbamic acid 1 -[2-(2-chloro-4- {[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-<br>
dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-<br>
yl ester with about 0.75 to about 1.3 molar equivalents of succinic acid. Generally, this<br>
reaction is conducted in an inert diluent at a temperature ranging from about 0oC to about<br>
60oC; including about 20oC to about 55oC, such as about 25 oC to about 55oC.<br>
Suitable inert diluents for this reaction include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, isobutanol, ethyl acetate, telrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and the like, or a<br>
mixture thereof, optionally containing water.<br>
In one embodiment, the succinic acid may be added as a solution, in a solvent<br>
such as ethanol or isopropanol, to a solution of biphenyl-2-ylcarbarmc acid l-[2-(2-<br>
chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-<br>
yl)ethylamino]methyl} -5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-y 1 ester. The<br>
solution of the thus formed salt is then allowed to cool over a period of lime, optionally<br>
with seeding at an intermediate temperature, and optionally with stirring, to allow<br>
crystalline product to form.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, a solution of succinic acid in ethanol is added to a<br>
solution of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid 1-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-<br>
2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-<br>
methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyI]pipcridin-4-yl ester in a similar volume of<br>
tctrahydrofuran, at a temperature of about 55oC, this solution is then cooled to about<br>
45oC, seeded, then further cooled to about 20oC and left stirring over an extended period,<br>
for instance about 48 h, as crystalline product is formed.<br>
In a a further embodiment, a solution of succinic acid in isopropanol may be<br>
added to a solution of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-<br>
hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ei:hylamino]methyl}-5-<br>
methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester in about three times the volume of<br>
tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of about 37oC, this solution is then seeded and then held<br>
at this temperature for about four hours, then further cooled to about 15oC over a period<br>
of several hours, for example about 4 hours, and then left at this temperature, as<br>
crystalline product is formed. This process was found to provide predominantly Form 3.<br>
In a further embodiment, a crystalline succinic acid salt may be prepared from the<br>
compound of formula I by adding a solution of succinic acid in ethanol portionwise to a<br>
solution of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-<br>
2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-<br>
methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester in ethanol, at a temperature of about<br>
50eC, over a period of about 4 h, followed by the addition of water (about 10 to 15% by<br>
volume, and then temperature cycling for instance over the range 0 to 40 aC, over a<br>
period of several days, for instance 2 to 5 days, typically about 3 days. This process was<br>
found to provide predominantly Form 1.<br>
In a further embodiment, a crystalline succinic acid salt may be prepared from the<br>
compound of formula T by adding a solution of succinic acid portionwise over a period of<br>
hours, for instance 3 to 7 h, typically about 5 h, to a suspension of the compound of<br>
formula 1 in an inert liquid such as methanol or tetrahydrofuran, at an elevated<br>
temperature, for instance in the range 40 to 60oC, typically about 50oC, and then<br>
subjecting the resultant slurry to temperature cycling, for instance over the range 0 to 40<br>
oC, over a period of several days, for instance 3 to 7 days, typically about 5 days. This<br>
process was found to provide predominantly Form 2 (solvent = methanol) or<br>
predominantly Form 3 (solvent = THF), depending on the solvent used.<br><br>
In the foregoing processes, the product from the deprotection of the silyl-protected<br>
derivative of the compound of formula 1 may be contacted with succinic acid without the<br>
need for full isolation or purification of the intermediate product.<br>
It will be appreciated that the purity of the initially prepared crystalline salt may<br>
be improved by recrystallisation. Furthermore, recrystallisation conditions may be<br>
selected which determine which Form of the salt is obtained.<br>
Thus, it has been found that Form 1 may be conveniently prepared by anti-solvent<br>
recrystallisation of initially prepared crystalline salt from aqueous THF using a lower<br>
alcohol such as cthanol or isopropanol as anti-solvent. The % of water is found to be<br>
important, as too little results in incomplete dissolution whilst too much leads to<br>
incomplete recrystallisation and degradation. It is also found beneficial to limit the upper<br>
temperature used, to avoid unwanted product degradation. It was found desirable to<br>
allow recystallisation to occur slowly, over a period of hours, to improve the quality of<br>
the crystals thus formed. In contrast, the solubility characteristics and difference in<br>
solubility between higher and lower temperatures in a range of single solvents appeared<br>
to preclude solvent recrystallisation.<br>
Accordingly, in a further embodiment, the present invention provides a process<br>
for preparing the Form 1 succinatc salt which process comprises the steps:<br>
dissolving the succinate salt in aqueous THF (10-18%, for example 10-16%), at a<br>
temperature in the range 18 to 23°C, for example about 20°C;<br>
adding a first volume of a lower alcohol as an antisolvent, for example elhanol or<br>
isopropanol, in particular isopropanol, and warming to 32-40°C, typically 36 ±3 °C;<br>
optionally seeding with Form 1;<br>
adding a second volume of the lower alcohol, for example over several hours, preferably<br>
about 12 h;<br>
cooling to a temperature in the range 18 to 23°C, for example about 20 °C; and<br>
collecting the crystalline product.<br>
In particular embodiment, a crystalline succinic acid salt, for example the Form 3<br>
salt, is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran containing 14% water, at a temperature of about 20<br>
oC, to which a similar volume of isopropanol may then be added. The solution is warmed<br>
to about 36 oC, and seed crystals then added. Typically, the ratio of the weight of seed<br>
crystals to the weight of crystalline salt in the solution is about 1:400. The solution is<br>
then stirred at this temperature for a short time, for example about 1 hour, after which<br><br>
further isopropanol is added over a period of hours, for example about 12 hours, during<br>
which time crystallization occurs. After a further short period, for example about 1 hour,<br>
the thus formed suspension is cooled to a temperature of about 20oC and left for a further<br>
short period, for example 1 hour, before crystalline product, for instance the Form 1 salt,<br>
is collected by filtration.<br>
It has been found useful to prepare the crystalline succinic acid salt with a level of<br>
purity suitable for use as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) by a two step process,<br>
involving the initial preparation of an intermediate grade of the salt, followed by the<br>
rccrystallisation of this intermediate grade product, in a controlled manner and with<br>
seeding, to obtain the desired Form, having the desired crystal quality. In one<br>
embodiment, the intermediate grade is isolated as essentially the Form 3, as a<br>
consequence of the conditions used, and this is then converted to the desired Form 1 form<br>
by anti-solvent recrystallisation.<br>
High throughput polymorph screening techniques, by variation in crystallization<br>
conditions, for instance, solvent, temperature, are now being developed and becoming<br>
available to the skilled man or being offered by commercial suppliers such as Avantium<br>
Technologies. Further crystalline solid state forms may be identified using such high<br>
through put techniques.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, it has been found that a grade of<br>
biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid 1-[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-bydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-<br>
dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-<br>
yl ester suitable for use in a subsequent succinic acid salt forming reaction (so-called<br>
Intermediate Grade compound, the initial product of stage 3) may be conveniently<br>
prepared from l-(3-{[2-chloro-4-(hydroxymethyl)-5-methoxyphenyl]amino}-3-<br>
oxopropyl)piperidin-4-yl biphenyl-2-ylcarbamate (International Patent application no<br>
PCT/US2004/004449, publication no. WO 2004/074246 A2, at page 134, Preparation 96)<br>
in a three step process, without the need for full isolation and purification of the<br>
intermediates, from stages 1 and 2, according to scheme 1:<br><br><br>
5 Solid state forms<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention provides three distinct crystalline<br>
solid state forms of the succinic acid salt of biphcnyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-(2-chloro-4-<br><br>
{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-<br>
methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester, forms 1, 2 and 3, that have been<br>
identified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The preferred solid slate form,<br>
designated as Form 1, is characterized by a high melting point, as evidenced by a<br>
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) trace, at about 174 oC. The remaining solid state .<br>
forms, Forms 2 and 3, are characterized by melting points, as evidenced by differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces, at about 161 oC and 150 oC respectively.<br>
Furthermore, Form 1 is characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD)<br>
pattern having significant diffraction peaks at 28 values of 5.0 ±0.3, and 10.0±0.3.<br>
Furthermore, Form 2 is characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD)<br>
pattern having significant diffraction peaks at 26 values of 5.0 ±0.3, and 9.9±0.3.<br>
Furthermore, Form 3 is characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD)<br>
pattern having a significant diffraction peaks at 20 values of 5.0 ±0.3.<br>
In addition, Form 1 is characterized by its infrared (IR) absorption spectrum<br>
which shows significant absorption bands at about: 3265,2832, 1735, 1718, 1679, 1669,<br>
1591,	1540, 1518, 1493, 1439, 1405, 1339, 1302, 1283, 1239, 1202, 1163, 1144, 1107,<br>
1095, 1039, 1009, 973, 921, 885, 868, 838, 773, 751, and 707 cm"1.<br>
In addition, Form 2 is characterized by its infrared (IR) absorption spectrum<br>
which shows significant absorption bands at about: 3317, 2947, 1728, 1678, 1667, 1591,<br>
1537, 1494, 1453, 1439, 1403, 1339, 1302, 1284, 1213, 1172, 1111, 1058, 1046, 999,<br>
975, 885, 839, and 750 cm1.<br>
In addition. Form 3 is characterized by its infrared (IR) absorption spectrum<br>
which shows significant absorption bands at about: 3335, 2949, 1745, 1715, 1678, 1641,<br>
1592,	1542, 1493, 1464, 1439, 1405, 1338, 1303, 1283, 1247, 1211, 1170, 1109, 1093,<br>
1053, 1041,997,974,919,889,842,774,766,751 and 721 cm"1.<br>
Form 1 has been demonstrated to have a reversible sorption/desorption profile<br>
with a good level of hygroscopicity (i.e. less than about 2.0 % weight gain in the<br>
humidity range of 30 % relative humidity to 90 % relative humidity), as shown by its<br>
Dynamic Vapour Sorption profile.<br>
These properties of the salts of this invention are further illustrated in the<br>
Examples below.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations<br><br>
The succinic acid salt of the compound of formula I may typically be administered<br>
lo a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route<br>
of administration including, but not limited to, inhaled, oral, nasal, topical (including<br>
transdcrmal) and parcnteral modes of administration, in particular inhaled administration.<br>
However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that, once the crystalline salt of<br>
this invention has been formulated, it may no longer be in a crystalline form, i.e., the salt<br>
may be dissolved in a suitable carrier, or the original crystalline form.<br>
Accordingly, in one of its compositions aspects, this invention is directed to a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or<br>
excipient and a succinic acid salt of biphenyl1-2-ylcarbamic acid 1 -[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-<br>
hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-<br>
methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester or a solvate thereof. Optionally,<br>
such pharmaceutical compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating<br>
agents if desired.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention typically contain a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a succinic acid salt of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid 1-<br>
[2-(2-chloro-4-{[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-<br>
yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester or a solvate<br>
thereof. Typically, such pharmaceutical compositions will contain from about 0.01 to<br>
about 95% by weight of the active agent; including, from about 0.01 to about 30% by<br>
weight; such as from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the active agent.<br>
Any conventional carrier or excipient may be used in the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or<br>
combinations of carriers or excipients, will depend on the mode of administration being<br>
used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this<br>
regard, the preparation of a suitable pharmaceutical composition for a particular mode of<br>
administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>
Additionally, the ingredients for such compositions are commercially available from, for<br>
example, Sigma, P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, MO 63178. By way of further illustration,<br>
conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and<br>
Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; White, Baltimore, Maryland<br><br>
(2000); and H.C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems,<br>
7 Edition, Lippincott Williams &amp; White, Baltimore, Maryland (1999).<br>
Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers include, but arc not limited to, the following: (1) sugars, such as<br>
lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3)<br>
cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and<br>
cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients,<br>
such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil,<br>
safflowcr oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as<br>
propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene<br>
glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents,<br>
such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-<br>
free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate<br>
buffer solutions; (21) compressed propellant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and<br>
hydrofluorocarbons; and (22) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are typically prepared by<br>
thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending a salt of the invention with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. If necessary or<br>
desired, the resulting uniformly blended mixture can then be shaped or loaded into<br>
tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional<br>
procedures and equipment.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are suitable<br>
for inhaled administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for inhaled<br>
administration will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions<br>
are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer<br>
inhaler, a metered-dose inhaler (MD1), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a similar delivery<br>
device.<br>
In a specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a nebulizer inhaler. Such<br>
nebulizer devices typically produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising the active agent to spray as a mist that is carried<br>
into the patient's respiratory tract. Accordingly, when formulated for use in a nebulizer<br><br>
inhaler, the active agent is typically dissolved in a suitable carrier to form a solution.<br>
Suitable nebulizer devices are provided commercially, for example, by PARI GmbH<br>
(Starnberg, German). Other nebulizer devices include Respimat (Boehringer Ingelheim)<br>
and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,123,068 and WO 97/12687.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a nebulizer inhaler<br>
comprises an aqueous solution comprising from about 0.05 µg/mL to about 10 mg/mL of<br>
a succinic acid salt of compound of formula I or a solvate thereof. In one embodiment,<br>
the aqueous nebulizer formulation is isotonic. In one embodiment, the aqueous nebulizer<br>
formulation has a pH in the range of from about 4 to about 6. In a particular embodiment,<br>
the aqueous nebulizer formulation is buffered with citrate buffer to a pH of about 5. In<br>
another particular embodiment, the aqueous nebulizer formulation contains from about<br>
0.1 mg/mL to about 1.0 mg/mL free base equivalents of biphenyl-2-ylcarbamic acid l-[2-<br>
(2-chloro-4- {[(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-<br>
yl)ethylamino]methyl}-5-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl ester.<br>
In another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a dry powder inhaler.<br>
Such dry powder inhalers typically administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder<br>
that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. In order to achieve a free<br>
flowing powder, the active agent is typically formulated with a suitable excipient such as<br>
lactose, starch, mannitol, dextrose, polylactic acid (PLA), polylactide-co-glycolide<br>
(PLGA) or combinations thereof. Typically, the active agent is micronized and combined<br>
with a suitable carrier to form a blend of micronized particles of respirable size, where<br>
"micronized particles" or "micronized form" means at least about 90% of the particles<br>
have a diameter of less than about 10 urn. The dry powder composition may further<br>
comprise a ternaiy agent such as magnesium stearate, presenting from 0.1-2%w/w, to<br>
stabilize the composition.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a dry powder inhaler<br>
comprises lactose having a particle size between about 1 µm and about 100 µm and<br>
micronized particles of a succinic acid salt of compound of formula 1, or a solvate thereof.<br>
Such a dry powder composition can be made, for example, by combining the<br>
lactose with the active agent and then dry blending the components. Alternatively, if<br>
desired, the active agent can be formulated without an excipient. The pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition is then typically loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation blister<br>
strips, cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.<br>
Examples of dry powder inhaler delivery devices include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline,<br>
Research Triangle Park, NC) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,035,237); Diskus<br>
(GlaxoSmithKline) (sec, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,378,519; Turbuhalcr. (AstraZcneca,<br>
Wilmington, DE) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,524,769); Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline)<br>
(see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,353,365) and Handihaler (Boehringer Ingelheim). Further<br>
examples of suitable DPI devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,415,162, 5,239,993,<br>
and 5,715,810, WO-A-2006/018261, and WO-A-03/061743, and references cited therein.<br>
In yet another specific embodiment of this invention, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising the active agent is administered by inhalation using a metered-<br>
dose inhaler. Such metered-dose inhalers typically discharge a measured amount of the<br>
active agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof using compressed propel lant<br>
gas. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions administered using a metered-dose<br>
inhaler typically comprise a solution or suspension of the active agent in a liquefied<br>
propellant. Any suitable liquefied propellant may be employed including<br>
chlorofluorocarbons, such as CCl3F, and hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs), such as 1,1,1,2-<br>
tetrafluoroethanc (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA227). Due<br>
to concerns about chlorofluorocarbons affecting the ozone layer, formulations containing<br>
HFAs are generally preferred. Additional optional components of HFA formulations<br>
include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate,<br>
oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,225,183,<br>
EP 0717987 A2, and WO 92/22286.<br>
A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a metered-dose inhaler<br>
comprises from about 0.01 % to about 5 % by weight of a succinic acid salt of compound<br>
of formula I, or a solvate thereof; from about 0 % to about 20 % by weight ethanol; and<br>
from about 0 % to about 5 % by weight surfactant; with the remainder being an HFA<br>
propellant.<br>
Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized<br>
hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the active agent, ethanol (if present)<br>
and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the active agent is micronized<br>
and then combined with the propellant. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol<br>
canister, which forms a portion of a metered-dose inhaler device. Examples of metered-<br><br>
dose inhaler devices developed specifically for use with HFA propellants are provided in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,006,745 and 6,143,277. Alternatively, a suspension formulation can<br>
be prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the active<br>
agent. See, for example, WO 99/53901 and WO 00/61108.<br>
For additional examples of processes of preparing respirablc particles, and<br>
formulations and devices suitable for inhalation dosing see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,268,533,<br>
5,983,956, 5,874,063, and 6,221,398, and WO 99/55319 and WO 00/30614.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also contain other<br>
therapeutic agents that are co-administered with a succinic acid salt of compound of<br>
formula I or solvate thereof. For example, the pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may further comprise one or more therapeutic agents selected from anti-<br>
inflammatory agents (e.g. steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids; and<br>
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAlDs), phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors, anti-<br>
infective agents (e.g. antibiotics or antivirals), antihistamines, β2 adrenergic receptor<br>
agonists, muscarinic receptor antagonistst (i.e., anticholinergic agents) and the like, in<br>
particular a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent or a muscarinic receptor antagonistst. The<br>
other therapeutic agents can be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or<br>
solvates. Additionally, if appropriate, the other therapeutic agents can be used as<br>
optically pure stereoisomers.<br>
If desired, the salts of this invention can also be administered in combination with<br>
another therapeutic agent or agents, such those described herein. In this embodiment, the<br>
components are not physically mixed together but are administered simultaneously or<br>
sequentially as separate compositions. For example, a salt of this invention can be<br>
administered by inhalation simultaneously or sequentially with a steroidal anti-<br>
inflammatory agent, such as a corticosteroid, using an inhalation delivery device that<br>
employs separate compartments (e.g. blister packs) for each therapeutic agent.<br>
Alternatively, the combination may be administered from multiple delivery devices, i.e.,<br>
one delivery device for each therapeutic agent.<br>
Representative steroidal anti-inflammatory agents that can be used with the<br>
compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, methyl prednisolone,<br>
prednisolone, dexamcthasonc, fluticasone propionatc, 6,9-difluoro-17 -[(2-<br>

resulting mixture was filtered and washed with toluene (180 ml), to remove manganese<br>
residues. The resulting solution was concentrated to about half the original volume (540<br>
ml), cooled to -20 °C, and diluted with methanol (240ml.). 5-((1R)-2-amino-1-{[tert-<br>
butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy}ethyl)-8-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)-one acetate (48.4g) was added<br>
and the mixture stirred at -65 °C until dissolution was complete. The solution was cooled<br><br>
to ~ -2 °C and sodium borohydride (2.12g) was added in 4 portions over 1 h. Upon<br>
complete addition the reaction was quenched by the addition of water (300mL). The<br>
mixture was stirred thoroughly and then the layers were separated, at- 20°C. Methanol<br>
(540mL) was added to the organic layer and this was then concentrated to about a third of<br>
the original volume. Additional methanol (600mL) was added to the residue which was<br>
then concentrated to about half the original volume. The solution was cooled to -17 "C<br>
and cesium fluoride (54. lg) and acetic acid (9.2g) were added. The resulting mixture was<br>
stirred at ~] 7 °C for about 13 hours. Upon complete reaction, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran<br>
(605mL) and water (275mL) were added. The mixture was stirred thoroughly and the<br>
layers then separated. The organic layer was washed with aqueous saturated sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate solution (275mL) and then water (220mL). The organic layer was<br>
then concentrated to about half the original volume by vacuum distillation before being<br>
diluted with THF (500mL)*. The solution was warmed to -37 °C and a solution of<br>

few milligrams of sample on a Silicon wafer (zero background) plates, resulting in a thin<br>
layer of powder. Characteristic XRPD angles and d-spacings are recorded in Table 1 for<br>
a sample of each of Forms Form 1, 2 and 3, as prepared by the method described in<br>
Examples 2, 3, and 5.<br><br><br>
Characteristic peak positions and calculated d-spacings are summarised in Table 1.<br>
These were calculated from the raw data using Highscore software. Peaks marked with a<br>
* distinguish that form from the others. Other peaks (underscored and in bold) also<br>
distinguish the forms, however, there arc shoulders or low intensity peaks of another form<br>
in close proximity that make these peaks less specific than those with a shaded<br>
background.<br>
The XRPD data are illustrated in Figures 4 to 6, respectively.<br><br>
Example 9 - FT-IR<br>
The FT-IR spectrum of the solid forms, Forms 1, 2 and 3, was recorded using a Nicolet<br>
Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer, fitted with a Diamond/ZnSe ATR Accessory at 4 cnr*<br>
resolution, over the frequency range 4000 to 700 cm"1.<br>
Form 1 bands were observed at: 3265,2832, 1735, 1718, 1679, 1669, 1591, 1540, 1518,<br>
1493, 1439, 1405, 1339, 1302, 1283, 1239, 1202, 1163,1144, 1107, 1095, 1039, 1009,<br>
973,	921, 885, 868, 838, 773, 751, and 707 cm1.<br>
Form 2 bands were observed at: 3317, 2947, 1728, 1678, 1667, 1591, 1537, 1494, 1453,<br>
1439,1403, 1339, 1302, 1284,1213, 1172, 1111, 1058, 1046, 999, 975, 885, 839, and<br>
750 cm-1.<br>
Form 3 bands were observed at: 3335, 2949, 1745, 1715, 1678, 1641, 1592, 1542, 1493,<br>
1464, 1439, 1405, 1338, 1303, 1283, 1247, 1211, 1170,1109, 1093, 1053,1041,997,<br>
974,	919, 889, 842, 774, 766, 751 and 721 cm'1.<br>
The data for a representative sample of each of Forms 1,2 and 3 is shown in Figures 7 io<br>
9, respectively.<br>
Example 10 - Dynamic Vapour Sorption Assessment<br>
A Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) profile of Form 1 was obtained using an SMS DVS-1<br>
with water as a reagent at 25°C. 20-30mg of sample were placed in a glass bulb and<br>
equilibrated at 30%RH. The %RH was increased to 90% in 10% steps. The %RH was<br>
then decreased to 0% in 10% steps, and finally increased to 30%RH, again in 10% steps.<br>
The results of two sorption/desorption cycles are shown in Figure 10<br>
The DVS profile shows that the succinate salt, Form 1, has a reversible<br>
sorption/desorption profile with a good level of hygroscopicity (less than about 2.0 %<br>
weight gain in the humidity range of 30 % relative humidity to 90 % relative humidity).<br>
The reversible moisture sorption/desorption profile demonstrates that the Form 1<br>
succiante salt of the present invention possesses an acceptable hygroscopicity and is not<br>
deliquescent, thereby making it suitable for pharmaceutical development.<br><br>
