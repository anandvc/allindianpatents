MIXED METAL ALKOXIDE COMPLEXES AND POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS MADE THEREFROM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.        Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to mixed metal alkoxide complexes useful as precursors for polymerization procatalysts that are ultimately useful in polymerizing α-olefins. The precursor complexes can be prepared by reacting a mixture of various metal alkoxides, halides or amides in the presence of a clipping agent to form a solid complex. The solid complex then can be used to form a procatalyst by contacting it with a halogenating agent and optionally an electron donor. The procatalyst then can be converted to an olefin polymerization , catalyst by contacting it with a cocatalyst and optionally a selectivity control agent<br>
2.        Description of Related Art<br>
Polymers   and   copolymers   of  lower   a-olefins,   particularly,<br>
ethylene, propylene and butylene  are widely used throughout the<br>
world.      These   polymeric   products   are   relatively   inexpensive   to<br>
manufacture,   and  they  exhibit  a  number  of commercially  useful<br>
properties- These polymers are most commonly utilized in the form of<br>
highly crystalline solids,   During the polymerization process, whether<br>
it be by liquid pool, gas phase, slurry phase or any other commonly<br>
utilized   process,   it  is   beneficial   for  the   polymer  particles   (and<br>
consequently the catalyst particles) to be of a satisfactory shape and<br>
size. As examples: denser particles allow for higher hourly production<br>
rates; spheroidal particles allow for higher polymer bulk density;<br>
narrow   particle   size   distribution   allows   for   better   gas   phase<br><br>
fluidization.   Overly small catalyst and polymer  particles {commonly called fines) are also undesirable.<br>
When ethylene is polymerized, the process is less complited than with higher olefins in that the product type  is not greatly influenced by the manner in which the ethylene molecules add to the growing  polymeric   chain   during   polymerization.      The   polymeric product of ethylene does not generally exist in stereoisomeric forms. The   simpler   catalysts  required  to   effect  this   polymerization   can normally be obtained by straightforward chlorination of a catalyst precursor.   If the shape of the catalyst particle and thus the shape of the resulting polymer particle is of importance, the catalyst precursor must be sufficiently robust so that it can withstand the rigors of this chlorination step.<br>
When propylene is polymerized, however, the presence of pendant methyl groups on the polymeric chain provides a possibility of several product types, depending on the steric regularity with which propylene molecvdes add to the growing chain. Much if not most of the commercial polypropylene results from the stereoregular addition of propylene molecules in a regular head-to-tail manner. The form of polymer having a substantial proportion of random addition of propylene units is termed atactic and this amorphous form is less desirable. If present in a significant proportion, the atactic polymer must be removed through an extraction process to provide a more desirable crystalline material.<br>
These polymers typically are formed by using a polymerization catalyst. The activity of the catalyst is significant in that the more polymer produced per unit weight of catalyst the better. The early titanium, chromium or vanadium catalysts were of low activity and the product contained a significant proportion of catalyst residues. These<br><br>
residues  had  to be removed in  an  effort  to  obtain  commercially satisfactory properties.<br>
More recent titanium-based olefin polymerization catalysts are stereoregulating and have sufficient activity to avoid extraction and deashing.    These high activity catalysts typically are prepared via chlorination of a. magnesium containing precursor, in the presence of an electron donor compound, to form a solid procatalyst that usually contains magnesium, titanium and halide moieties, and comprises additionally a cocatalyst (usually an organoaluminum compound) and an     optional     selectivity    control     agent     (SCA)    for    propylene polymerization.     The  magnesium   containing  complex  is  typically referred to as a "precursor", the solid titanium-containing compound typically  is   referred   to   as   a  "procatalyst",   the   organoaluminum compound, whether complexed or not, usually is referred to as the "cocatalyst' and the third component external electron donor, whether used    separately    or    partially    or    totally    complexed    with    the organoaluminum compound, is referred to as the "selectivity control agent."     Throughout this disclosure, these terms will be used in accordance with the aforementioned designations.   As before, if the shape of the catalyst particle and thus the shape of the resulting polymer particle is of importance, the catalyst precursor must be sufficiently   robust   so   that   it   can   withstand   the  rigors   of the chlorination process.<br>
Many chemical combinations of procatalysts, cocatalysts and selectivity control agents are known in the art to produce active catalysts. Through considerable experience, however, certain materials are of greater interest than others. For example, there is significant research in the area of procatalysts, which typically contain some chemical combination of magnesium, titanium tetrachloride and<br><br>
an internal electron donor. These internal electron donors usually are oxygen containing compounds such as tetrahydrofuran and aromatic esters such as ethyl benzoate or ethyl p-toluate. Conventional cocatalysts include an aluminum trialkyl such as triethylaluminum or triisobutylaluminum that is often complexed with a portion of the selectivity control agent (or external electron donor), which also is typically an aromatic ester or an organosilane. Although variations in any of these catalyst components will influence the performance of the resultant catalyst, the component that appears to offer the greatest opportunity for modification to produce greater catalyst activity is the procatalyst.<br>
The literature is rife with disclosures relating to the various known methods of preparing procatalysts.  For example, Kioka, et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,33Q,649, the disclosure of which is incorporated by. reference herein in its entirety, describes a solid catalyst component (procatalyst)   that   is   prepared  by  heating   a   soluble   magnesium compound such as magnesium chloride with a higher alcohol in the presence of an ester to produce a solution.   This solution contains a "precursor"  of the  procatalyst,  which  then  is   added  to  titanimn tetrachloride and an electron donor (internal) to form the procatalyst. A number of United States patents issued to Robert C. Job (and Robert C. Job, et al.,) describe various mechanisms for preparing magnesium containing,   titanium-containing   compounds   that   are   useful   as precursors for the production of procatalysts that are ultimately useful in preparing catalysts for the polymerization of α-olefins. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,034,361; 5,082,907; 5,151,399; 5,229,342; 5,106,806; 5,146,028;   5,066,737;   5,122,494,   5,124,298,   and   5,077,357,   the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, disclose various procatalyst precursors.    U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
5,034,361 discloses solubilizing a magnesium alkoxide in an alkanol solvent by interaction of the magnesium alkoxide compound and certain acidic materials. This magnesium alkoxide then can be used either directly as a magnesium-containing catalyst precursor, or can be reacted with various titanium compounds to produce a magnesium and titanium-containing catalysts precursor,<br>
U.S. Patent Nos.  5,082,907;  5,151,399; 5,229,342; 5,106,806; 5,146,028;  5,066,737;  5,122,494,  5,124,298,  and  5,077,357   disclose various magnesium and titanium-containing catalyst precursors, some of which  are   prepared  by  using  the   aforementioned  magnesium alkoxide as a starting material.     These precursors are not active polymerization   catalysts,   and  they   do   not   contain   any  effective amounts of electron donor. Rather, the precursors are used as starting materials , in   a   subsequent   conversion   to   an   active   procatalyst. Magnesium   and   titanium-containing   procatalysts   are   formed   by chlorinating the magnesium and titanium-containing precursor with a tetravalent titanium halide, an optional hydrocarbon and an optional electron donor.  The restdting procatalyst solid then is separated from the reaction slurry (by filtration, precipitation, crystallization, and the like).      These   procatalysts   then   are   converted  to   polymerization catalysts by reaction with, for example, an organoaluminum compound<br>
and a selectivity control agent.<br>
While these magnesium and titaniiun-containing procatalysts are very effective in producing polyolefins, they are not as effective in producing polyolefins with unconventional properties. For example, these traditional Ziegler-Natta procatalysts typically are not used, in conjunction with other catalysts (i.e., metallocenes), to make polymers having a bimodal molecular weight distribution. The magnesium and titanium-containing  procatalysts  known  in  the  art  also  are  not<br><br>
prepared to have specifically tailored catalyst decay rates, which is a useful attribute in assuring homogeneous product composition over a range of reactor residence times, and is a useful attribute when the catalyst is used in consecutive reactor polyoleful processes. In addition, these procatalysts are sensitive to esoteric, or unconventional comononiers, like dienes and the like, and they typically lose a substantial portion of their activity in the presence of such comonomers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There exists a need to develop a procatalyst precursor that can be converted to an olefin polymerization catalyst capable of producing polymers in high yield, low fines, improved average particle size and<br>

Specifically, clipping agents include: (i) those species which, in large excess are capable of dissolving magnesium alkoxides; (ii) large anions; and (iii) those that prevent magnesium alkoxides from polymerizing.<br>
Throughout this description the term "precursor" and the expression "procatalyst precursor" denotes a solid material that contains a mixture of Ml, M2, Tl, and T2 metals, (keeping in mind that Ml, M2, Tl, and T2 each can comprise more than one metal), but does not contain an electron donor, and which can be converted to a "procatalyst" (defined below) by contacting it with a halogenating agent such as alkylaluminum halide or tetravalent titanium halide (preferably TiCl4) and optionally an electron donor- Throughout this description, the term "procatalyst" denotes a solid material that is an active catalyst component, and that can be converted to a polymerization catalyst by contact with an organoaluminum compound<br><br>

The mixed metal alkoxide precursor can be made by any method capable of forming a complex between the mixture of metals, and the additional complexing groups, at least one of which is selected from alkoxide groups, phenoxide groups, halides, hydroxy groups, carboxyl groups and amide groups.   Preferably, the precursor is prepared by contacting a mixture of Ml and M2 metal alkoxides, halides, carboxyls, amides, phenoxides or hydroxides with a mixture of T1 and T2 metal alkoxides, hahdes, carbosyls, amides, phenoxides or hydroxides to form a solid precursor complex, and then separating the solid complex from the  mixture.     In  accordance with this  method,  a  clipping  agent preferably is used and, optionally, an ahphatic alcohol can be used to form the solid precursor complex.   In addition, a hahde can be used during the preparation of the mixed metal alkoxide precursor complex, preferably a chloride, and most preferably, TiCl4.<br>
A particularly preferred method of making the mixed metal alkoxide precursor of the invention is shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
Any clipping agent that is capable of carrying out the functions described above can be used in the present invention. Clipping agents useful in the present invention include species which in large amounts will dissolve the magnesium alkoxide, large anions, and species that prevent the magnesium alkoxide from polymerizing. Preferably, the clipping agents are selected from cresol, 3-methoxyphenol, 4-dimethylaminophenol,       2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol       or      p-<br>
chlorophenol,   HCHO,   CO2,   B(OEt)3,   SO2,   Al(0Et)3,   CO3",   Br",<br>
(O2COEt)", Si(OR)4, R'Si(0R)3, and P(OR)3. In the above compounds, R<br>
and R' represent hydrocarbon groups, preferably alkyl groups, containing from 1-10 carbon atoms, and preferably R and R' are the same or different and are methyl or ethyl.  Other agents that release<br><br>
large anions or form large anions in situ (i.e., clipping agent precursors) can be used, such as MgBr2, carbonized magnesium ethoxide (magnesixim ethyl carbonate), calcium carbonate, and the like- Thus, the expression "clipper anion" mentioned in the table above denotes these anions.<br>
The dipping agent preferably is used in an amount less than that required to fully dissolve the magnesium alkoxide. Preferably, the clipping agent is used in an amount ranging from 0 (if a clipping agent precursor is used) to 0,67 moles of chpping agent for every mole of the mixture of Ml and M2. More preferably, the chpping agent is used in an amount ranging from about 0.01 moles to about 0.3 moles, and most preferably, from about 0.03 moles to about 0.15 moles per mole of the mixtm'e of Ml and M2.<br>
Any alcohol or mixtures of alcohols can be used to prepare the mixed metal alkoxide complex precursor. - Preferably, the alcohol is an aliphatic alcohol, and more preferably, the alcohol is selected from methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol, i-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably the alcohol is ethanol, butanol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The mixed metal alkoxide complex precursor can be produced by any of the methods described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,122,494, 5,124,298, and 5,371,157, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, including the modification of substituting the magnesium alkoxide and titaniiun tetraalkoxide with suitable mixed metal compounds (i,e, halides, alkoxides, amides, etc. of Ml, M2, Tl, and T2). The complex mixed metal-containing alkoxide compound preferably can be produced by reacting one or more Ml and M2 alkoxides, one or more Tl or T2 alkoxides, a halide selected from TiCl3<br>
TiCl4, VCl4, FeCl3, SnCl4, HfCl4, Mna2, MgCl2, and SmCla, and an<br><br>
optional phenolic compound in the presence of an inert reaction diluent. The diluent then can be removed to produce, as a particulate solid, the complex alkoxide compound. This solid then can be treated with a halogenating agent to produce an olefin polymerization procatalyst, which then can be used, in the optional presence of selectivity control agent, to promote the polymerization of lower a-olefins by polymerization techniques which are largely conventional.<br>
The alkoxide moieties of the mixed metal alkoxides of Ml and M2 are the same as or are different from the alkoxide moieties of the mixed metal alkoxides of Tl and T2, it being understood that not all Ml, M2, Tl, and T2 metals are in the form of an alkoxide.  Moreover, the alkoxide moieties of one metal alkoxide reactant can be the same as or different from the alkoxide moieties of the other metal alkoxide reactant. In part for reasons of complex alkoxide pxirity, it is preferred that all alkopde' moieties, of the mixed metal alkoxides be the same. The preferred alkoxide moieties are methoxide or ethoxide (R and R' above are methyl or ethyl) and particularly preferred is ethoxide. Magnesium ethoxide, titanium tetraethoxide, zirconium tetraethoxide, and hafnium tetraethoxide are the preferred metal alkoxide reactants for the production of the mixed metal alkoxide complex.<br>
If a phenolic compound is used to form the mixed metal alkoxide precursor, the phenolic compovmd preferably is selected from phenol or an activated phenol. By the term "activated phenol" is meant a monohydroxylic phenol of one aromatic ring having aromatic ring substituents other than hydrogen which serve to alter the pKa of the phenolic compound. Such substituent groups are free from active hydrogen atoms and include halogen, e.g., chlorine or bromine, alkyl and particularly alkyl of up to 4 carbon atoms inclusive, and dialkylamino wherein each alkyl has up to 4 carbon atoms inclusive.<br><br>
Suitable substituent groups do not include hydroxy. Illustrative of suitable phenolic compounds are phenol, p-cresol, o-cresol, 3-methoxyphenol, salicyl aldehyde, methyl salicylate, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), 2,4-diethylphenol, p-chlorophenol, p-bromophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, p-dimethylaminophenol and m-diethylaminophenol.<br>
The contacting of the mixed metal compounds, dipping agent (or chpper), optional halide, optional phenolic compound, and optional alcohol preferably takes place at an elevated temperature in an inert reaction diluent. The reaction diluent is one in which all reactants are at least partially soluble and which does not react with the reactants or the complex alkoxide product.    Preferred reaction diluents are hydrocarbon  such   as   isooctane,  isopentane   or  n-heptane,   or   are halohydrocarbon such as .methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride or chlorobenzene.    The contacting preferably- takes place at a reaction temperatin-e from about 50°C to about 120°C.   Contacting typically is effected  in  a   suitable  reactor  and  is  facilitated   by  conventional procedures  such  as  shaking,  stirring  or refluxing.     The  phenolic compound, if used, preferably is provided in a quantity of from about 0.01 mole to about 2 moles per mole of mixed Tl and T2 metals (e.g., titaniinn tetraalkoxide, titanium tetrachloride, vanadium tetrachloride and the like), but preferably in a quantity of from about 0.1 mole to about 0.4 moles per mole of mixed Tl and T2 metals.  The mixed Ml and M2 metal compounds can be provided in a quantity from about 1.5 mole to about 8 moles per mole of mixed Tl and T2 metals.  Preferred quantities of mixed Ml and M2 compounds are from about 2.5 moles to about 3.5 moles per mole of mixed Tl and T2 metals.<br>
Upon contacting all of the components, the mixture then can be heated to anywhere from about 50°C to about 120°C by any suitable<br><br>
heating apparatus. The components are mixed at this elevated temperature for about 5 minutes to about 9 hours, preferably, from about 25 minutes to 7 hours, and most preferably from about 45 minutes to 2 hours; such time to be determined by visually inspecting the components for evidence of the consumption of original solid reactants- Those skilled in the art are capable of determining when the original mixed metal reactants have disappeared and/or when a homogeneous slurry has been formed, using the guidelines provided herein.<br>
Upon forming the homogeneous slurry, the alcohol then is preferably removed from the solution by heating the solution at temperatures above 100°C, and/or passing nitrogen over the solution. Removal of alcohol enables the precipitation of additional mixed metal alkoxide complex which may remain dissolved in solution (i.e., solid precursor material) and results in enhanced yield of product.. The solid complex then can be removed from the reaction mixture by conventional means.<br>
Preferably, the solid precursor materials are separated from the reaction mixture by any suitable means, including but not limited to, decantation, filtration, centrifugation, and the like.   More preferably, the solid material is filtered, most preferably tmder the impetus of pressure and/or temperature.   The filtered solids then can be washed at least once with one or more solvents, including but not limited to monochlorobenzene, toluene, xylene, isopentane, isooctane, and the like.     After separation from the mixture,  (or mother liquor,  and subsequent wash solvents), the solid procatalyst precursor preferably is dried. Drying typically is conducted by supplying dry, moisture-free inlet nitrogen at a temperature of about 25°C to about 45°C for anywhere from about 10 minutes to about 10 hours thereby resulting<br><br>
in a product that is substantially dry.    Higher temperatures on the order of 50 to about 150°C can be used to dry the precursor in shorter periods of time-Any mechanism can be used to carry out the drying of the present invention.    For example, the filter cake could be dried by flowing a heated inert gas stream through the cake for the time period described above.  Alternatively, the filter cake could be removed from the  filter  and then  subsequently  dried in  a  conventional  drying apparatus using direct, indirect, infrared, radiant or dielectric heat. Any apparatus capable of drying solids at temperatures above about 25° can be used in accordance with the present invention. Particularly preferred drying apparatus include, but are not limited to,  direct continuous dryers, continuous sheeting dryers, pneumatic conveying dryers, rotary dryers, spray dryers, through-circulation dryers, tunnel dryers,/fluid bed dryers, batch through-circulation dryers,, .tray and compartment dryers,. cylinder dryers,  screw-conveyor dryers,  drum dryers, steam-tube rotary dryers, vibrating-tray dryers, agitated pan dryers, freeze dryers, vacuum rotary dryers and vacuum-tray dryers. Most preferably, the solid precursor material is dried in a single or multiple-leaf combined filter and dryer.   Those skilled in the art are capable of designing a suitable dryer and drying protocol to effect drying the precursor in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The precursor of the present invention then can be immediately converted to a procatalyst by any suitable means known to the art described below, or it can be stored for later use or for shipment to a facility capable of converting the precursor to a procatalyst. Upon diying, the solid precursor material can be discharged by any suitable means to downstream processing.<br><br>
Conversion of the dried procatalyst precursor to a procatalyst can be accomplished in any suitable manner.   For example, the dried precursors   of the   invention   can  be   converted   to   polymaerization procatalyst by reaction with a halide, like tetravalent titanium halide, an optional hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon and an electron donor. The tetravalent titanium halide is suitably an aryloxy- or alkoxy di- or trihalide  such  as  diethoxytitanium  dichloride,   dihexyloxytitanium dibromide or diisopropoxytitaniumchloride or the tetravalent titanium halide is a titanium tetrahalide such as titanium tetrachloride or titanium tetrabromide.    A titanium tetrahalide is preferred as the tetravalent titanium halide and particularly preferred is titaniiun tetrachloride,   Halogenation also can be carried out by any of several means known to the art.     These include but are  not limited to<br>
treatment of the precursor with SiCl4, RxAlCl3-x, BCI3 and the like.<br>

Any electron donor can be used in the present invention so long as it is capable of converting the precursor into a procatalyst. Suitable electron donors are those electron donors free from active hydrogens that are conventionally employed in the formation of titanixxm-based procatalysts.    Particularly preferred electron donors include ethers, esters,   amides,   imines,   nitriles,   phosphines,   stibines,   dialkyoxy benzenes, and arsines.  The more preferred electron donors, however, include   esters  and  ethers,   particularly  alkyl   esters   of aromatic monocarboxylic or dicarboxylic acids and particularly aliphatic or cychc ethers.   Examples of such electron donors are methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, ethyl p-ethosybenzoate, 1,2-dialkyoxy benzenes, ethyl p-methylbenzoate,       diethyl      phthalate,       dimethyl       naphthalene dicarboxylate, diisobutyl phthalate, diisopropyl terephthalate, diethyl<br><br>
eher and tetrahydrofuran. The electron donor is a single compound or is a mixture of compounds but preferably the electron donor is a single compound. Of the preferred electron donors, ethyl benzoate, 1,2-dialkoxy benzenes and diisobutyl phthalate are particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of procatalyst precursor, halide, electron donor and halohydrocarbon is maintained at an elevated temperature, for example, a temperature of up to about 150°C. Best results are obtained if the materials are contacted initially at or about ambient temperature and then heated. Sufficient hahde is provided to convert at least a portion and preferably at least a substantial portion of the alkoxide moieties of the procatalyst precursor to hahde groups. This replacement is conducted in one or more contacting operations, each of which is conducted over a period of<br>
time ranging from a few minutes to a few hours and it is preferred to<br><br>
'have  halohydrocarbon present during each  contacting.     Sufficient<br>
electron donor usually is provided so that the molar ratio of electron<br>
donor to the mixed metals (Ml and M2) present in the solid procatalyst<br>
is from about 0.01:1 to about 1:1, preferably from about 0.05:1 to about<br>
0.5:1. The final washing with light hydrocarbon produces a procatalyst<br>
that is solid and granudar and when dried is storage stable provided<br>
that    oxygen    and    active    hydrogen    compounds    are    excluded.<br>
Alternatively, the procatalyst is used as obtained from the hydrocarbon<br>
washing without the need for drying. The procatalyst thus produced is<br>
employed in the production of an olefin polymerization catalyst by<br>
contacting the procatalyst with a cocatalyst and a selectivity control<br>
agent.<br>
The   mixed   metal-containing   procatalyst   serves    as    one<br>
component of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system where it is contacted<br>
with a cocatalyst and optionally, a selectivity control agent.    The<br><br>
cocatalyst component employed in the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system<br>
may be chosen from any of the known activators of olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst systems employing a transition metal halide,<br>

Preferred organoalmninum cocatalysts are triethyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminium and diethylhexyl aluminum. . Triethyl aluminum is a preferred trialkylaluminum cocatalyst.<br>
The organoaluminum cocatalyst also can be an aluminoxane such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), or a boron alkyl. The method of preparing aluminoxanes is well known in the art. Aluninoxanes may be in the form of oligomeric linear alkyl aluminoxanes represented by the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein s is 1-40, preferably 10-20; p is 3-40, preferably 3-20; and R*** is an alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably methyl or an aryl radical such as a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl radical. In the case of MAO, R**'*' is methyl, whereas in MMAO, R*** is a mixture of methyl and C2 to C12 alkyl groups wherein methyl comprises about 20 to 80 percent by weight of the R*** group-<br>
The organoaluminum cocatalyst, during formation of the olefin    . polymerization catalyst, is preferably employed in a molar ratio of aluminum to the mixture of Tl and T2 of the procatalyst of firom about 1:1 to about 150:1, but more preferably in a molar ratio of from about 10:1 to about 100:1.<br>
The final component of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system is the optional selectivity control agent (SCA), or external electron donor, which typically is used when polymerizing propylene, or mixtures thereof. Typical SCAs are those conventionally employed in conjunction with titanium-based procatalysts and organoaluminum ;     cocatalysts. Illustrative of suitable selectivity control agents are those<br><br>
classes  of electron   donors  employed  in  procatalyst  production   as described   above   as   well   as   organosilane   compounds   including alkylakoxysilanes and arylalkoxysilanes.   Particularly suitable silicon compounds of the invention contain at least one silicon-oxygen-carbon linkage.  Suitable silicon compounds include those having the formula R1mSiYnXp wherein: R1 is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, Y is -OR2 or -OCOR2 wherein R2 is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, X is hydrogen or halogen, m is an integer having a value of from 0 to 3, n is an integer having a value of from 1 to 4, p is an integer having a value of from 0 to 1, and preferably 0, and m+n+p = 4.

conditions employed during polymerization. Preferably, R2 contains<br>
from 1 to 10 carbon atoms when it is aliphatic and may be sterically<br>
hindered or cycloaliphatic, and from 6 to 10 carbon atoms when it is<br>
aromatic. Silicon compounds in which two or more silicon atoms are<br>
linked to each other by an oxygen atom, i.e., siloxanes or polysiloxanes,<br>
may also be employed, provided the requisite sihcon-oxygen-carbon<br>
linkage is also present. The preferred selectivity control agents are<br>
alkylalkoxysilanes such as ethyltriethoxysilane, diisobutyl<br>
dimethoxysilane,	cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane,	propyl<br>
trimethoxysilane,   dicydohexyl   dimethosysilane,   and   dicyclopentyl dimethoxysilane. In one modification, the selectivity control agent is a<br><br>
portion of the electron donor added during procatalyst production. In an alternate modification the selectivity control agent is provided at the time of the contacting of procatalyst and cocatalyst. In either modification, the selectivity control agent is provided in a quantity of from 0.1 mole to about 100 moles per mole of mixture of T1 and T2 in the procatalyst. Preferred quantities of selectivity control agent are from about 0.5 mole to about 25 mole per mole of mixture of Tl and T2 in the procatalyst.<br>
The olefin polymerization catalyst may be used in slurry, liquid phase, gas phase and liquid monomer-type reaction systems as are known in the art for polymerizing olefins. Polymerization preferably is conducted in a fluidized bed polymerization reactor, however, by continuously contacting an alpha-olefin having 2 to 8 carbon atoms with the components of the catalyst system, i.e, the solid procatalyst component, cocatalyst and optional SCAs. In accordance with the process, discrete portions of the catalyst components can be continually fed to the reactor in catalytically effective amounts together with the alpha-olefin while the polymer product is continually removed during the continuous process. Fluidized bed reactors suitable for continuously polymerizing alpha-olefins have been previously described and are well known in the art. Fluidized bed reactors useful for this purpose are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,302,565, 4,302,566 and 4,303,771, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art are capable of carrying out a fluidized bed polymerization reaction using the guidelines provided herein.<br>
It is preferred sometimes that such fluidized beds are operated using a recycle stream of unreacted monomer from the fluidized bed reactor.  In this context, it is preferred to condense at least a portion of<br><br>
the recycle stream. Alternatively, condensation may be induced with a liquid solvent. This is known in the art as operating in "condensing mode." Operating a fluidized bed reactor in condensing mode generally is known in the art and described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos, 4,543,399 and 4,588,790, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The use of condensing mode has been found to lower the amount of xylene solubles in isotactic polypropylene and improve catalyst performance when using the catalyst of the present invention.<br>
The catalyst composition may be used for the polymerization of olefins by any suspension, solution, slurry, or gas phase process, using known equipment and reaction conditions, and is not limited to any specific type of reaction system. Generally, olefin polymerization temperatures range from about 0°C to about 200°C at atmospheric, subatmospheric, or superatmospheric pressures. Slurry or solution polymerization processes may utilize subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures and temperatures in the range of about 40°C to about 110°C. A useful liquid phase polymerization reaction system is described in U.S. Patent 3,324,095. Liquid phase reaction systems generally comprise a reactor vessel to which olefin monomer and catalyst composition are added, and which contains a liquid reaction medium for dissolving or suspending the polyolefin. The liquid reaction medium may consist of the bulk liquid monomer or an inert liquid hydrocarbon that is nonreactive under the polymerization conditions employed. Although such an inert liquid hydrocarbon need not function as a solvent for the catalyst composition or the polymer obtained by the process, it usually serves as solvent for the monomers employed in the polymerization. Among the inert liquid hydrocarbons suitable for this purpose are isopentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane,<br><br>
benzene, toluene, and the like. Reactive contact between the olefin monomer and the catalyst composition should be maintained by constant stirring or agitation. The reaction medium containing the olefin polymer product and unreacted olefin monomer is withdrawn from the reactor continuously. The olefin polymer product is separated, and the unreacted olefin monomer and liquid reaction medium are recycled into the reactor.<br>
Preferably, gas phase polymerization is employed, with superatmospheric pressures in the range of 1 to 1000, preferably 50 to 400 psi, most preferably 100 to 300 psi, and temperatures in the range of 30 to 130°C, preferably 65 to 110°C. Stirred or fluidized bed gas phase reaction systems are particularly useful. Generally, a conventional gas phase, fluidized bed process is conducted by passing a stream containing one or more olefin monomers continuously through a fluidized bed reactor under reaction conditions and in the presence of catalyst composition at a velocity sufficient to maintain a bed of solid particles in a suspended condition. A stream containing unreacted monomer is withdrawn from the reactor continuously, compressed, cooled, optionally fully or partially condensed as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,528,790 and 5,462,999, and recycled to the reactor. Product is withdrawn from the reactor and make-up monomer is added to the recycle stream. As desired for temperature control of the system, any gas inert to the catalyst composition and reactants may also be present in the gas stream. In addition, a fluidization aid such as carbon black, silica, clay, or talc may be used, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,994,534.<br>
Polymerization may be carried out in a single reactor or in two or more reactors in series, and is conducted substantially in the absence   of catalyst   poisons.      Organometallic   compounds   may   be<br><br>
employed as scavenging agents for poisons to increase the catalyst activity. Examples of scavenging agents are metal alkyls, preferably aluminum alkyls, most preferably triisobutylaluminum.<br>
The precise procedures and conditions of the polymerization are broadly conventional but the olefin polymerization process, by virtue of the use therein of the polymerization catalyst formed from the solid precursor, provides polyolefin product having a relatively high bulk density in quantities that reflect the relatively high productivity of the olefin polymerization catalyst. In addition, the polymeric products produced in the present invention have a reduced level of fines.<br>
Conventional additives may be included in the process, provided they do not interfere with the operation of the catalyst composition in forming the desired polyolefin.<br>
When hydrogen is used as a chain transfer agent in the process, it is used in amounts varying between about 0.001 to about 10 moles of hydrogen per mole of total monomer feed. Also, as desired for temperature control of the system, any gas inert to the catalyst composition and reactants can also be present in the gas stream.<br>
The polymerization product of the present invention can be any product, homopolymer, copolymer, terpolymer, and the like. Usually, the polymerization product is a homopolymer such as polyethylene or polypropylene, particularly polypropylene. Alternatively, the catalyst and process of the invention are useful in the production of copolymers including copolymers of ethylene and propylene such as EPR and polypropylene impact copolymers when two or more olefin monomers are supplied to the polymerization process. Those skilled in the art are capable of carrying out suitable polymerization of homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, etc., using liquid, slurry or gas phase reaction conditions, using the guidelines provided herein.<br><br>
Ethylene polymers of the invention include ethylene homopolymers, and interpolymers of ethylene and linear or branched higher alpha-olefins containing 3 to about 20 carbon atoms, with densities ranging from about 0.90 to about 0.95 and melt indices of about 0.005 to 1000. Suitable higher alpha-olefins include, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-octene, and 3, 5, 5-trimethyl 1-hexene. Cyclic olefins such as vinyl cyclohexane or norbornene may also be polymerized with the ethylene. Aromatic compounds having vinyl unsaturation, such as styrene and substituted styrenes, may also be included as comonomers. Particularly preferred ethylene polymers comprise ethylene and about 1 to about 40 percent by weight of one or more comonomers described above.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by examples exemplifying particularly preferred embodiments thereof. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these examples do not limit the invention but rather serve to more fully describe particularly preferred embodiments.<br>

Magnesium, iron, titanium-containing complex<br>
Preparation of precursor<br>
A polymerization procatalyst precursor comprising a mixture of magnesium, titanium and iron was prepared in accordance with the following reaction:<br>
2.64 Mg(0Et)2    +     0.21 MgCl2-6EtOH      +      0.42 FeCl3      +      0.68 Ti(0Et)4<br>
+   0.15 Mg(O2COET)(OEt)        	&gt;<br>
Approximately 0.6 g magnesium ethyl carbonate (CMEO, carbonized magnesium ethoxide:   3.8 mmol), 7.55 g   of Mg(0Et)2 (66<br>
mmol), 1.74 g of Fe C13 (10.5 mmol), and 1.95 g MgCl2-6EtOH (5.2<br>
mmol) were mixed in an 8 ounce bottle. To this mixture, 100 gm of chlorobenzene (90 ml) then was added. The mixture was stirred for about one minute, and then 4.11 g of Ti(0Et)4 (95%, 17.1 mmol) was<br>
added. The resulting mixture (still in the 8 ounce bottle) was placed in a 100° oil bath and stirred at 440 rpm. After 27 minutes (96° oil), only<br><br>
a few of the granules had dissolved, but there was some precipitate evident in the brown liquid. By 3 hr, 47 min (97° oil), there were still granules present in a very thick slurry. By 5 hr, 41 min, the slurry was so thick that the stir speed was increased to 550 rpm, and a gentle nitrogen flow was started. At 6 hr, 39 min, the stir speed was increased to 660 rpm and 40 ml of heptane was added over a period of 15 minutes. The heat was then turned of and the slurry allowed to stir overnight. The mixture was filtered in the glovebox. The solids were washed once with chlorobenzene, then twice with hexane and sucked dry to yield 11.8 g of beige powder.<br>
Preparation of polymerization procatalvst<br>
Approximately 2.12 g of the precursor prepared above was slurried in 15 ml of hexane. About 11 ml of 25% EADC/toluene then was added to the slurry over a period of about 3 minutes. The initially tan slurry turned to greyish brown. After stirring for 20 minutes, the slurry was filtered. The solids were washed twice with hexane and dried under moving nitrogen to yield 2.15 g of grey powder. That powder was slurried in 15 ml of hexane then 11 ml of 25% EADC/toluene was added over 2 minutes. The initially grey slurry turned brown. After 20 minutes of stirring, the mixture was filtered. The solids were washed four times with hexane and then dried under moving nitrogen to produce 1.57 g of tan powder. Analysis of the solid tan powder revealed: 3.50% Ti, 3.09% Fe, 12.7% Mg, 4.64% Al. A polymerization sample was made by slurrying 0.100 g of catalyst in 20 ml of Kaydol oil (0.60% sohds).<br><br>
Slurry polymerizations,<br>
A. To a one liter stainless steel (SS) reactor, containing 500 ml of hexane and 15 ml of 1-hexene, were added 341 standard cubic centimeters (SCO of H2 (13 psi partial pressure). Triethyl aluminum<br>
(0.25 mmol of 1.56 M heptane solution) was injected by sjrringe. The catalyst (0.4 ml of 0.60% slurry of procatalyst prepared aboye) was injected from a 50 ml bomb using ethylene pressure and about 20 ml of hexane. After polymerizing for 30 minutes at 85°C, while adding ethylene on demand to keep the total pressure at 160 psi, the reaction was extinguished by injecting 2 ml of isopropanol The catalyst decay rate had been 67%/20 minutes. The collected polymer was allowed to air dry oyemight before characterization. The polymerization produced 181 g of polymer of 0.25 g/cc bulk density with melt index (I2)<br>
of 0.204 dg/min and flow index (I21 of 6.88 dg/min (MFR, = 34).   The<br>
polymer density was determined to be 0.9459 g/cc. ' Size exclusion chromatography showed Mw/Mn = 7.8.<br>
B. Polymerization with diene comonomer: The polymerization of part A above was repeated except that the amount of catalyst slurry was increased to 0.7 ml and 5,0 ml of 5-vinyl-2-norbomene was added to the reactor. This polymerization produced about 181 g of polymer of 0.22 g/cc bulk density with I5 of 0.165 dg/min and flow index (I21) of<br>
6.88 dg/min (I21/I5 = 24, corrresponding to an MFR &gt; 100).    Size<br>
exclusion chromatography showed Mw/Mn = 10.9.<br><br>

Magnesium and tin-containing complex<br>
Preparation of precursor<br>
A polymerization procatalyst precursor comprising a mixture of magnesium and tin was prepared in accordance with the following reaction: 2.85Mg(OEt)2 + 1.10 SnCli 53(OEt)2.47 + 0.15 Mg(02COET)(OEt) + 3 EtOH —<br>
NaOEt (4,72 g, 96%, 67.9 mmol) was slurried into 50 ml of chlorobenzene in a 4 ounce bottle then SnCl4 (7.16 g, 3.22 ml, 27.5<br>
mmol) was added. Ethanol (3.46 g, 75 mmol) was then added while stirring at room temperature.  After about 10 minutes at room temperature, the mixture was transferred- to a 75°C oil bath and stirring continued for one hour. Heating was terminated and the mixture allowed to cool overnight. The solution (containing the tin ethoxychloride) was decanted from the sludge of sodium salts and into an 8 ounce bottle.   To this solution was added a mixture of Mg(OEt)2<br>
18.15 g, 71.2 mmol) and carbonized magnesium ethoxide (0,6 g, 3.8 mmol) which had been slurried in 45 ml of chlorobenzene. The bottle was placed in a 100°C  oil bath and stirred for 5.5 hours at 440 rpm by which time nearly all of the magnesium ethoxide granules appeared to have reacted. The bottle cap was removed and a gentle stream of mtrogen was passed over the reaction for about 90 minutes whereupon about 7% of the solvent had evaporated. The mixture was transferred to a glovebox and filtered warm. The solids were washed once with chlorobenzene  and  twice  with  hexane  then  dried  under  moving<br><br>
nitrogen.    Obtained were 6,15 g of cream colored powder composed largely of glassy particles about 5 microns in diameter.<br>

minute, methyl salicylate (0.38 g, 2.5 mmol) was added. The bottle was placed in a 105°C  oil bath, and then a mixture of 5-0 ml of ethanol (3.92 g, 85 mmol) and 1.5 ml of butanol (1,21 g, 16.3 mmol) was quickly added and the mixture stirred at 440 rpm. After an hour the slurry had begun to form clumps so the stirring rate was increased to 660 rpm. After another 45 minutes additional ethanol (6 ml) was added to disperse the clumps. After a total time of 2 hours, it was evident that some Mg(OEt)2 remained unreacted, so another 1.08 g of salicyl<br>
aldehyde were added. At 4 hours total time, only a few granules remained in the blood red solution so the heat was turned off to let the solution stir and cool.    After several hours cooling, during which<br><br>
crystals had precipitated on the walls, the oil bath was raised to 60° and about 1/3 of the solvent was evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream.    The slurry was filtered and the solids washed twice with chlorobenzene, twice with hexane the sucked dry to yield 6,0 g of translucent white chunky aggregates composed of 20 - 35 m particles of crystalline appearance.<br>
Slurry polymerization,<br>
A procatalyst was not prepared directly from this precursor. Instead a chlorinating agent, in the form of diethylaluminium chloride, was added to the polymerization reactor along with the precursor. To a one liter stainless steel reactor, containing 500 ml of hexane and 15 ml of 1-hexene, were added 894 standard cubic centimeters (SCC) of H2 (20 psi partial pressure).

heptane solution) Was injected by syringe. The catalyst (4.7 ml of 1.2%' slurry of the Mg/Ti/Sm precursor) was injected from a 50 ml bomb using ethylene pressure and about 20 ml of hexane. Ethylene was added to a total pressure of 158 psi. After 10 minutes no ethylene had been consumed so 1-5 ml of 1.5 M diethylaluminum chloride/heptane solution was injected into the reactor by syringe whereupon polymerization began. After polymerizing for 30 minutes at 85°C , while adding ethylene on demand to keep the total pressure at 158 psi, the reaction was extinguished by injecting 2 ml of isopropanol. The catalyst decay rate had been 65%/20 minutes. The collected polymer was allowed to air dry overnight before characterization- The polymerization produced 47.7g of polymer corresponding to a productivity of about 11.9 Kg polymer/gm catalyst/100 psi ethylene/hour.<br><br>
As can be seen from the above examples, a variety of mixed metal-containing precursors can be prepared, which in turn produce highly active polymerization procatalysts. The mixed metal precursors of the  invention,  when  converted  to  polymerization   procatalysts, produce polymers having high bulk density and a range of molecular weight distributions, and the catalysts have modest catalyst decay. Using the guidelines provided herein, those skilled in the art are capable of tailoring polymerization procatalysts to provide a variety of catalyst decay rates and polymers having a variety of molecular weight distributions.  The inventive examples  also provide pol3rmerization procatalysts that retain the excellent morphology of the precursor to thereby generate polymer having fewer fines, as well as a lower xylene solubles content.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail with reference ta particularly preferred, embodiments; those skilled in the art appreciate that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
