CONNECTING ELEMENT AND COMBINATION SHEET PILE 'WALL WITH A CONNECTING ELEMENT OF THIS TYPE<br>
The invention relates to a connecting element according to the preamble of clainn 1, which serves the purpose of attaching sheet pies to carrier elemens. in particular to ciouble-T-beam for constructir)g a combination sheet pile wall. In  <br><br><br>
addition, the invention relates to a combination sheet pile  wall according to the preamble of claim 12, where the connecting element  according to the invention is used for connecting the sheet piles to the carrier elements.<br>
Profiled connecting elements of the kind mentioned above are in particular used for constructing so-called combination sheet pile walts.. such as the ones known, for example, from DE 297 18 052 U1, EP 0 072 118 A1 or also from DE 103 8 769 A1. Such combination sheet pile walls are in particular used for constructing quay walls, to secure banks in harbors and on rivers and also for supporting embankments and the like. Known combination sheet pile walls are formed of numerous carrier elements that are rammed into the ground with at least one sheet pile, also known as sheet piling, positioned between them. To create a closed, watertight sheet pile wall, the sheet piles are connected to one another along their longitudinal edges using interlocking elements such as hook or jaw strips, while the sheet piles located directly adjacent to the carrier elements are connected to the carrier elements through the aforementioned profiled connecting elements. To attach the profiled connecting elements to a carrier element, the connecting element comprises a profiled receiving element designed for this purpose. Attaching one of the interiocking elements of the<br><br>
sheet pile to be attached is carried cut using an profiled attachment element of the profiled connecting element. The connecting element comprises a uniform cross-sectional shape and is adapted in its length to the length of the sheet piles and the carrier elements to be connected.<br>
Currently, so-calted hot-rolied stee! piles are used for such combination sheet pile walls, that is, sheet piles that have been reformed into the desired cross-sectional shape through hot-forming. Thus tar, it is not possible to use cold-rolied sheet piles that have been re-formed into the desired cross-sectional shape through cold-forming, even though they are less expensive in comparison to hot-rolled sheet piles and exhibit better surface properties, in particular surface hardness.<br>
For example, one problem with cold-rolled sheet piles is that the structure of the sheet piles is formed differently during the cold-rolling process, depending on the degree of forming. Due to the different degrees of forming, cold-rolled sheet piles exhibit different resisting moments, strengths and properties of elasticity across their cross-section. Because of the different material properties of the sheet piles viewed across the cross-section of the sheet piles, it was until now not possible to construct combination sheet pile walls from cold-rolled sheet piles. For example, material breakage often occurs during the ramming procedure at the very location where the sheet pile had been re-fomned the strongest during the cold-rolling process, i.e., in particular at the interiocking elements which have been re-formed the strongest. However, it is precisely the<br><br><br>
Based on this state-of-the-art, it is the objeclrve of the invention to provide a profiled connecting element, or respectively to present a combination sheet pite valt equipped with profiled connecting elements subject to the invention where he sheeting is possible using both hot-rolled and cold-rolled sheet piles equally.<br>
This objective is solved by a connecting element with theleaaures set forth in claim 1. According to an additional aspect of the inventk&gt;n. ttie objective is solved through a combination sheet pile wall with the features as set forth in claim 12.<br>
With the connecting element subject to the invention, the cross-section of the profiled attachment element for the sheet pile is designed such that the central strip together with the transition section, the semicircular hook section and the end section form a receiving channel for the interlocking element of the sheet pile, which encompasses the interlocking element unifomily from all sides. In this manner, the interlocking element of the sheet pile, which is engaged in the protiled attachment element, is supported and guided during the ramming procedure across a large surface area from several sides in a defined manner. The result of the large-area support of the interlocking element in the receiving channel of the profiled attachment elements is that forces that come into existence during the ramming procedure between the profiled attachment element and the interlocking element are distributed over a large area compared to conventional profiled attachment elements. As a result, the tensile,<br><br><br>
tensile, compression and torsion stresses that come into existence when using conventional profiled connecting elements, such thai in particular colo-rolled sheet piles exhibit a sufficient strenght and elasticity for the ramming procedure in spite of the reduced resisting moments, in particular In the area of the interlocking elements, such that their interlocking elements neither break out nor are damaged in any other manner.<br>
Additional advantages and improvements of the inventioo become apparent from the following description, the drawing and the dependent daims.<br>
For greatest-possible large-area support of the interlocking element of the sheet pile, it is recommended in a particularly preferred embodiment of the profiled connecting elements according to the invention to design the end section as long as possible in relation to the transition section. Simulation trials showed that a particularly good support effect for the interlocking element could be achieved, when the length of the end section in relation to the length of the transition section is in a range of 1 : 2 to 1 ; 3.<br>
To ensure a secure and defined guidance of the interlocking element in the receiving channel, it is advantageous if the ratio of the inner radius of the semicircular hook section to the length of the transition section is in a range of 1 : 4 to 1 : 5.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the support strip transitions with its flat side that points outward into one of the two longitudinal edges of the central strip, which facilitates the formation of the support strip during the continuous casting or roiling process of the connecting element subject to the invention.<br>
To ensure the desired effect of the support strip, the support strip should extibit a sufficient length relative to the length of the transition section when viewed in the cross-section of the profiled connecting element; however, said length should be sufficiently small so as not to obstruct the insertion of the interlocking element into the receiving channel. Preferably, the ratio of the length of the support strip to the length of the transition section should be in a range of 1 : 4 to 1 ; 5.<br><br><br>
Since the opening of the receiving channel, through which the interlocking element of the sheet pile protrudes into the receiving channel, is designed at the side of the profiled attachment element, but the Peiner beam defines the position of the profiled connecting elements, two alternative advancements of the aforementioned embodiment are recommended accorting to the invention. With one of the two advancements, the support strip of the profiled receiving element that runs sloped at an angle to the central strip is designed directly adjacent to the longitudinal edge of the central strip, near which the transition section of the profiled attachment element is shaped. With the attemative<br><br><br>
For example, if a conventional double-T-beam is used as the canier element, the profiled receiving element comprises, when viewed in the cross-section of the profiled connecting element, two support strips that protrude from the central strip and run at least approximately parallel to one andther, and where the carrier element can be inserted with Its support section in-between said support strips. In addition, the connecting element may be welded to the carrier element for fastening purposes.<br>
Furthermore, it is conceivable to design the profiled receiving element formed at the connecting element such that it is placed directly onto the surface of the carrier element and welded to it. A connecting element according to the<br><br><br>
To facilitate the manufacture of the connecting eiement subject to the inventicai. ft is recommended here as well to design the two support strips suchthat they transition into the two longitudinal edges of the central strip with ther outward pointing fiat sides in order to avoid undercuts.<br>
According to a further aspect, the invention relates to a combination sheet pile wall with the features set forth in claim 12. The combination sheet pile wall according to the invention is constructed of carrier elements, in particular doubie-T-beam, and at least one sheet pile each arranged between two carrier elements, wherein a connecting element is provided between the carrier elements for connecting the carrier elements to the sheet piles, and where an profiled attachment element is formed at said connecting element that is engaged in an interlocking element, which is formed at the sheet pile. According to the invention, at least one of the sheet piles is a cold-rolted sheet pile, wherein at least the respective attachment element of the connecting element that is engaged in the interlocking eiement of the cold-rolled sheet pile is designed such that the profiled attachment element partially encompasses the interlocking element of the cold-rolled sheet pile wall and thus provides support in a large area. Both U-shaped and Z-shaped cold-rolled sheet piles are used as the sheet piles. In addition, in an advancement of the combination sheet pile wall subject to the invention, it is recommended to use a connecting element<br><br><br>

Fig. 1 shows a top view of the face side of a first exemplary embodiment of a connecting element 10 according to the invention that is used to connect sheet piles with carrier elements in order to form so-called combination sheet pile walls. The connecting element 10 has a uniform cross-sectional shape and its length is adapted to the lengths of the sheet piles and carrier elements that are to be connected to each other. The connecting element 10 comprises a central<br><br><br>
The profiled attachment element 14 comprises a transition secikm 18 that protrudes from the central strip 12 at an approximatety right angle n&amp;sr the one longitudinal edge of the central strip 12, where said transitjon ss:tion 18 transitions into a hook section 20 that runs in an at least aRjroxiniate semicircular shape in the direction of the central strip 12. The end of the hook section 20 transitions into an end section 22 that runs parallel to the transition section 18. The ratio of the inside radius Ri of the bent hook section 20 to the length Li of the transition section is at about 1 : 4. The ratio of the length L2 of the end section 22 to the length Li of the transition section 18 corresponds approximately to a ratio of 1 : 3. In the presented exemplary embodiment, the transition section 18 has a length Li of, for example, 38mm, while the inside radius Rj of the hook section 20 has a dimension of 7mm and the er&gt;d section 22 a Length L2 of about 13mm.<br>
In this manner, the profiled attachment element 14 forms a receiving channel 24 that is open towards one side and runs in the longitudinal direction of the connecting element 10, with the interlocking element of the sheet pile being hooked into said open channel 24 for connecting the interlocking element to the connecting element 10.<br><br><br>
Fig. 2 shows an advancement of the connecting elennent 10 shown in Rg. 1. With this connecting element 40, a support strip 46 is formed onto the flat side of the central strip 42, onto which the profiled attachment element 44 is formed as well, and said support strip 46 runs at an approximate right angle to the flat side of the central strip 42, and thus parallel to the transition section 48 of the profiled attachment element 44 and transitions flush into one of the two longitudinal edges of the central strip 42. The support strip 46 is fomied to the central strip 42 relative to the profiled attachment element 44 such that the support strip 46 protrudes into the opening area 50 of the receiving channel 52 of the profiled attachment element 44 and covers it partially, however does not obstruct the insertion of the interiocking element into the receiving channel 52. The length L3 of the support strip 46 is selected such that the ratio between the length L3 of the support strip 46 and the length L1 of the transition section 48 is<br><br><br>
at about 45° in relation to the flat side of the central strip 62 towards the first support strip 68 and ends at about the same height as the first support strip 68. This forms a support channel 74 with an approximately triangular cross-section, which, as will be explained below, is used to receive a support section of a so-called Peiner beam, the support section comprising an approxmately wedge-shaped cross-section.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a top view of a connecting element 80, and is an advancement of the connecting element 60 shown in Fig. 3. The connecting element 80 also<br><br><br>

With this mirror-inverted design, the connecting element 80 can be attached to a PeiDer beam in a mirror-inverted manner such that the profiled attachenit element  84 can be attached to the Peiner beam pointing in the opposite direction when compared to the profiled attachment element 64 of the connecting element 60. Additionally, a support strip 94 is provided near the support strip 90, as is the case with the connecting element 40 shown in Fig. 2, where said support strip 94 interacts with the profiled attachment element 84 in the manner described in reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a top view of a section of a combination sheet pile wall 100, which is formed of several double-T-beam 102 and two cold-rolled U-sheet piles 104 arranged between two of the double-T-beam 102. The U-sheet piles 104 are connected to each other through interiocking elements 106 arxj 108. The profiled connecting elements 10 and 40 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are used for attaching the U-sheet piles 104 to the double-T-beam 102, wherein the connecting element 10 is attached to the doubie-T-beam 102 shown in Fig. 5 on the right with its profiled attachment element 14 pointing inward.<br><br><br>
