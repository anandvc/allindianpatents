Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to carbon black compositions comprising ethoxylated esters or polyethers and carbon black. The compositions may be produced by incorporating ethoxylated esters or polyethers onto fluffly carbon black in a pelletizing process to produce free flowing, low dust, attrition resistant carbon black pellets which are easily dispersible in most polymeric systems and provide enhanced rheological and mechanical properties.<br>
The present invention also relates to polymer compositions which incorporate the carbon black compositions of the present invention.<br>
Background of the Art<br>
Carbon blacks produced by a furnace process generally have bulk densities ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 gram/cubic centimeter (g/cc) and are generally known as fluffy carbon blacks. Huffy carbon blacks are generally easy to disperse in liquids, and in some polymeric systems. However, fluffy carbon blacks are generally cohesive and, hence difficult to handle for purposes such as conveying and weighing.<br>
Fluffy carbon blacks are agglomerated by various types of mechanical processes, either in the dry state, or with the aid of a liquid to produce pellets with improved handling characteristics. Common liquid pelletizing agents are oil and water. The process of agglomerating fluffy carbon blacks to form carbon black pellets is generally referred to as pelletizing.<br>
Unfortunately, generally utilized densification or agglomeration (pelletizing) processes have detrimental effects on the dispersion characteristics of the carbon black. Therefore it is recognized in the art that in pelletizing carbon blacks there is a fine balance between acceptable handling characteristics and ease of dispersion.<br>
A process for pelletizing carbon black is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,065371 which describes a typical wet pelletization process whereby the fiuffy carbon black and a liquid, typically<br><br>
water, are combined and agitated until spherical beads are formed. These beads are then dried to reduce the water content preferably to below 1% to form carbon black pellets.<br>
Prior art patents also disclose the use of binder additives in a wet pelletization process to further improve the pellet handling characteristics.<br>

U.S. Patent No, 3,565,658 discloses the use of a fatty amine ethoxylate non-ionic surfactant where the level of ethoxylation ranges from 2 to 50 moles of ethylene oxide per fatty amine group. The preferred level of surfactant in the pelletizing water is in the range 0.05% to 5%, by weight, based on the dry carbon black.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,645,765 discloses the use of a fatty acid or rosin acid ethoxylate, non-ionic surfactant where the level of ethoxylation is 5 to 15 moles ethylene per acid group. The preferred level of addition on the carbon black is in the range 0.1 % to 10%, by weight, based on the dry carbon black.<br>
Soviet Union Patent No. 937,492 claims the benefits of using 0.1% to 5%. by weight, based on the dry carbon black, of an aqueous solution of a reaction product generated from urea and an ethoxylated alkylolamide. The preferred level of ethoxylation is 1 to 7 moles of ethylene oxide per alkylolamide molecule.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,844,809 discloses the reduction in pellet dust levels by incorporating 0.4% to 2.5%, by weight, based on the dry carbon black of an aqueous solution containing 0.001% to 0.1%, by weight, of a nonionic surfactant containing randomly repeating poly(ethylene oxide) and poly (dimethyl silicone) groups. Molasses is also included at substantially higher concentration (up to 2%, by weight) as a co-binder and nitric acid (up to 15%, by weight) as an oxidizing source.<br>
The use of carbohydrates, rosin or surface active agents as disclosed in the above patents is focused towards improving pellet handling qualities. The patents do not disclose that the pelletizing treatments affected the performance properties of the carbon black in the final prcduct applications, which are typically rubber orientated.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 1,201369 discloses the use of a carboxylic acid type amphoteric surfactant in a concentration range 0.001% to 0.1%, by weight, in the pelletizing water to produce carbon black pellets with low adhesion and excellent dispersibility.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,014,810 discloses the benefits of wet pelletizing a range of pigments, including carbon blacks, with a blend of a quaternary ammonium compound and a bis(-2-hydroxyethyl)alkyl amine. Improvements in dispersion rate, viscosity stability and antistatic properties are disclosed for the blend of surface active agents.<br>
Pelletizing with oil, in the presence and absence of water is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2.635,057. U.S. Patent No. 3.011.902 and U.S. Patent No. 4,102967 as beneficial in improving the handling properties of carbon black pellets.<br>

U.S. Patent No. 4.277,288 discloses a fluidised granulation process for producing free-flowing dustless pigment granules in the absence of water. The organic component required to<br><br>
produce a dustless granule consists of two components, 5-20 phr of a non-aqueous granulating aid and a non-ionic surfactant for example sorbitan oleate ethoxylate as a second component. The bulk of the disclosure relates to producing free-flowing organic and inorganic pigments, including carbon black.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,397,652 also discloses a process for producing negligible dust preparations of organic dyes and optical brighteners. The process involves the dry blending, between 30 and 80* C, of the dye, or optical brightener, with 2-10%, by weight, of an adhesive selected from the group consisting of piolyhydric alcohol (e.g. sorbitol); manitol; manitose; lactose; hydrated dextrose; neopentyl glycol; and polyethylene glycol with a molar mass above 3,000. Also included in the composition is 1-10% of a dusting aid selected from the group consisting of fatty acid ethanolamide; fatty acid amide; alkyl alcohol; substituted phenol; and polyethylene glycol with a molar mass between 200 and 1000.<br>

The effectiveness and advantages of the present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples.<br><br>
Examples 1-4<br>
Examples 1-4 illustrate the use and advantages of carbon black compositions of the present invention, in comparison to conventional carbon black pellets, in polypropylene fiber applications. Four carbon black pellet compositions. A, B, C and D were produced by introducing 400 grams (g) of a fluffy carbon black, identified herein as CB-1, having a DBP of 60 cc/lOOg and a nitrogen surface area of 112 m2/g, into a batch pin pelletizer together with a solution containing 20 g of a binder and 300 g of water. The binder utilized in each pelleting composition was as shown in the Table below.<br>
Pellet Composition	Binder<br>
A	water<br>
B	5% sorbitan monostearate with 20 moles ethoxylate<br>
C	5% sorbitan monooleate with 5 moles ethoxylate<br>
D	5% sorbitan monooleate with 20 moles ethoxylate<br>
Carbon black pellet composition A was a control composition, carbon black pellet compositions B, C and D were carbon black compositions of the present invention.<br>
The carbon black/binder mixture was agitated for 5 minutes with a rotor speed of 800 rpm. The resultant pellets were dried at 120* C until the moisture content of the pellets was below 0.51. Pellet strength of each pallet composition was assessed qualitatively. The results are set forth in<br><br>
Table 1 below.<br>
The carbon black pellets were combined with a polypropylene homopolymer of melt index 35 in a twin screw extruder to produce a maslerbatch containing 35% by weight of the pelleted carbon black, the remainder being polypropylene and binder.<br>
The polypropylene composition was introduced into a 1 inch single screw extruder until equilibrium pressure conditions. The masterbatch was introduced and the rate of pressure change recorded according to the procedure described above. The results were as shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
These results indicate that carbon black compositions B, C and D of the present invention have improved pellet strength in comparison with the carbon black pellet composition A produced with pelletizing water only. In addition, the reduction in pressure build-up in masterbatch compositions containing carbon black compositions B, C and D of the present invention, in comparison to the masterbatch composition containing carbon black composition A, would translate to a reduction in the frequency of screen changes on a fiber production line, and therefore improved capacity and lower operating costs for the production line.<br>
Examples 5-10<br>
Examples 5-10 illustrate the use and advantages of carbon black compositions of the present invention, in comparison to conventional carbon black pellets, in polypropylene fiber<br><br>
applications.<br>
Two carbon black pellet compositions, E and F were produced in a continuous process by combining a fluffy carbon black, identified herein as CB-2, having a DBP of 112 cc/lOOg and an nitrogen surface area of 60 m^/g into a batch pin pelletizer together with a binder solution. The pellets were produced in a continuous pin pelletizer operating with rotor speed of 800 rpm to provide wet pellets with an average water content of 50%. The wet pellets were dried in a heated rotating drum to provide dry pellets with a moisture content below 0.6%.<br>
The binder utilized in each pelleting composition was as shown in the Table below.<br>
Pellet Composition	Binder<br>
E	water<br>
F	2% sorbitan monooleate with 20 moles ethoxylate<br>
Four runs of carbon black pellet composition E, and two runs of carbon black pellet composition F were made. Carbon black pellet composition E was a control composition, and carbon black pellet compositions F was a carbon black composition of the present invention.<br>

These results illustrate the significant improvement in pellet strength and attrition resistance by incorporation of a binder of the type utilized in the present invention during the pelletizing process in preparing the carbon black pellet composition F of the present invention. Carbon black pellet composition F of the present invention also has improved dispersion, in comparison with a conventional water pelletized carbon black pellet composition E, as seen by the reduction in pressure build-up when extruded through a screen pack which would translate to improved output at lower operating cost<br>
Examples 11-14<br>
Examples 11-14 illustrate the advantages of the carbon black pellet compositions of the present invention for use in polyurethane applications.<br>
Two fluffy carbon blacks, identified herein as CB-3 and CB-4, were pelletized to produce carbon black pellet compositions. Carbon blacks CB-3 and CB-4 had the combination of analytical properties set forth below:<br><br><br>
Four carbon black pellet compositions, G, H, I and J were produced in a continous process by combining the carbon blacks in a batch pin pelletizer together with a binder solution. The pellets were produced in a continuous pin pelletizer operating with rotor speed of 1000 rpm and dried in a heated rotating drum to provide dry pellets with a moisture content below 0.3%. The binder and carbon black utilized in each pelleting composition was as shown in the Table below.<br><br>
Carbon black pellet compositions G and I were control compositions, and carbon black pellet compositions H and J were carbon black compositions of the present invention.<br>
The pellets were assessed for mass pellet strength using the procedures described above. The results were as follows:<br><br>
The carbon black pellet compositions G, H, I and J were compounded into a polyether polyol, having a viscosity of 150 mPa.s at 25* C and a hydroxyl content of 3.4%, to produce a 30% carbon black content paste. In addition, a polyether pcrfyol compositon was produced by<br><br>
compounding carbon black CB-4 into the polyol and adding 2% sorbitan monooleate with 20 moles ethylene oxide binder directly to the polyol.  Each compounding operation involved pre-dispersion under a high shear, Dispermat, mixer for 5 minutes at a speed of 2000 rpm.<br>
The paste was then uansferred to a triple roll mill for the final size reduction process. The number of passes through the triple roll mill required to generate zero scratches on a Hegman gauge were noted together with the residual background "sand" value. The paste was then diluted with further polyol to produce a 15% carbon black loaded sample and the viscosity measured on a Carri-Med CS viscometer at a shear rate of 300 s-1. The results were as shown in Table 3:<br><br>
The above experiments illustrate the improved pellet strength and dispersion, and reduced compound viscosity, of the carbon black pellet compositions H and J of the present invention in comparison to use of carbon black compositions G and H pelletized with water only. The data also demonstrates the benefits of incorporating a binder directly onto the carbon black (pretreating the carbon black with a binder) in comparison to adding the binder to the polymer system.<br>
This example is representative for polyurethane foam and sealant applications and demonstrates improvement in dispersion and rheology of the polymer compositons incorporating carbon black compositions of the present invention. The reduction in viscosity would allow use of low pressure to apply the polyurethane sealant in either automotive direct glazing or window double/triple glazing unit operations.<br><br>
Example 15-17<br>
This example illustrates the advantages of using the carbon black compositions of the present invention in ink formulations.<br>
Carbon black compositions G and H from Examples 11-14 were evaluated in a typical oil based gloss ink using the same process as outlined in examples 11-14. In this case the mill base and letdown system were an oil (McGee 47) and a heatset resin (Lawter Vehicle 3477) used in a ratio of 1:9 by weight A third ink formulation was produced by adding sorbitan monooleate with 20 moles of ethylene oxide, to a composition of Carbon Black Composition G and the oil utilized in the compounding process.<br>
The compounding operation involved pre-dispersion under a high shear, Dispermat, mixer for 5 minutes at a speed of 2000 rpm. The paste was then transferred to a triple roll mill for the final size reduction process. The number of passes through the triple roll mill required to generate zero scratches on a Hegman gauge were noted together with the residual background "sand" value. The paste was then diluted with further polyol to produce a 15% carbon black loaded sample and the viscosity measured on a Carri-Med CS viscometer at a shear rate of 300 s-1. The results were as shown in Table 4:<br><br>
These results demonstrate the improved dispersion and reduced viscosity obtained when the binder composition utilized in the carbon black compositions of the present invention is either incorporated onto the carbon black or with direct addition to the ink vehicle. Incorporating the binder onto the carbon black exhibits the most significant improvement The binder would potentially help to reduce the mixing time for the ink and the reduced viscosity and improved<br><br>
dispersion would help to reduce wear in the application process.<br>
Example 18-26<br>
Examples 18-26 illustrate the use of carbon black compositions of the present invention in semiconductive compounds.<br>
Three carbon black pellet compositions, K, L and M were produced by combining a fluffy carbon black, identified herein as CB-5, having a DBP of 140 cc/lOOg and a nitrogen surface area of 70 m2/g, in a batch pin pelletizer together with a binder solution. The carbon black was combined with various binder solutions in a continuous pin pelletizer operating at 1050 rpm to provide wet pellets with levels of sorbitan monooleate with 20 moles ethylene oxide in amounts varying from 0 to 4%. The pellets were dried in a heated rotating drum to provide dry pellets with moisture content below 0.6%. The binder utilized in each pelleting composition was as shown in the Table below.<br><br>
The carbon blacks were compounded into ethylene vinyl acetate resin (40% vinyl acetate content, melt index 3), using a twin screw extruder, to produce a 40% carbon black loaded . compound The compound was subsequently extruded to form a tape and the level of carbon black dispersion assessed by measuring the number and size of surface imperfections using an optical microscope (magnification lOOx) with a reflected light source, by the procedures described herein. The results are shown below:<br><br><br>
The reduction in undispersed carbon black would be seen in the final cable compound as an improvement in surface smoothness of the extruded cable. Reduction in surface imperfections of the semi-conductive insulation shield is known to reduce the frequency of electrical breakdown due to tree growth.<br>
The EVA compositions containing carbon black compositions K and L disclosed above were evaluated for strippability onto a polyethylene substrate using the following technique: The compounds containing 40% carbon black in the ethylene vinyl acetate resin were compounded in a Brabender mixer with 1% dicumyl peroxide while maintaining the mixing temperature below 150' C. The material was transferred to a heated hydraulic press (temperature 130* C) and a plaque 1.2 mm thick produced. A 2 mm polyethylene plaque containing 1% dicumyl peroxide was produced in a similar manner. The two plaques were laminated together under a pressure of 100 psi and exposed to a curing cycle of 180* C for 15 minutes. The laminate was allow to cool to ambient temperature under pressure. The delamination force under a peeling angle of 180 degrees and a separation speed of 3.94 inches/minute was recorded; the results are an average of 28 pjeel tests:<br><br>
The data shows a reduction in strip force required to remove the semi-conductive shield pompound from the insulation layer. This is important in cable splicing operations or in m^ng terminal connections. The lower strip force will result in a faster operation and minimise voids/imperiections from high strip force systems and hence reduce the potential for electrical breakdown in use.<br>

The carbon blacks were were combined with either water or an aqueous solution of sorbitan monooleate with 20 moles of ethylene oxide in a continuous pelletizer operating with a rotor speed of 1000 rpm to produce wet pellets. The pellets were dried in an air circulating oven operating at 120* C to produce dry pellets with moisture content below 0.4%. In all 11 different carbon black compositions were produced as shown below:<br><br><br><br>
Each of the carbon black compositions was identically compounded into iow density polyethylene having a melt index of 26 using a Brabender mixer to produce a masterbatch containing 40% carbon black. The viscosity of the masterbatch was measured at 130* C and a shear rate of 50 s-1. The results are set forth in Table 6 below.<br><br><br>
The data in Table 6 illustrates the reduction in viscosity obtained by using a carbon black treated with a binder composition of the present invention. This reduction in viscosity would facilitate ease of dispersion of the masterbatch into further polyethylene in a typical extrusion blown film or profile extrusion application; and also improve output efficiency. One would also expect an improvement in carbon black dispersion which would also provide an improvement in pigmentary effieciency, UV protection and mechanical performance (e.g. tensile or impact strength).<br>

* SYNPERONIC is a trade name for surfactants produced and sold by ICI Corporation and comprise ethylene oxide - propylene oxide copolymers.<br>
The mix was agitated at 800 rpm for 2 minutes to produce a pelletized carbon black. The carbon black pellets were dried at 125' C until the moisture content was below 1%.<br>
Mass pellet strength of the carbon black compositions was determined according to the procedures described herein. The results are set forth in Table 7 below.<br>
Each of the carbon black compositions was combined with an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer containing 40% vinyl acetate and a melt index of 3 in a Brabender mixer conditioned at 65* C. The compound was masticated for 6minutes at 50 rpm to produce a fully dispersed compound containing 40% carbon black. These compounds were assessed for melt index (MI) at<br><br>
190 C using a 21.6 kg load, according to the procedures described herein. The results are also set forth in Table 9 below, which also shows the HLB of each binder.<br><br>
Comp. = Composition; Disp. Of Dil. Samples = Dispersion of Diluted Samples.<br>
These examples illustrate the improvement in dispersion quality and reduction in viscosity    • with improved pellet handling qualities, in a commercial system. These results would relate to shorter mixing cycles and improved extrusion characteristics.<br>
Examples 50-52<br>
These examples illustrates the production of carbon black compositions of the present -    invention, and the advantages of using the carbon black compositions of the present invention in ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) applications.<br><br>
Three carbon black compositions, SS, TT and UU were produced by combining a fluffy carbon black with a nitrogen surface area of 70 m2/g and a DBP of 140 cc/100g of carbon black, designated herein as CB-13, with a binder solution containing sorbitan monooleate in a continuous pin pelletiser operating at 1050 rpm to provide wet pellets. The resulting pellets containing either 0%, 2% or 4% binder were dried in a heated rotating drum to provide dry pellets with moisture contents below 0.6%. The percentage of the binder utilized in each composition was as follows:<br>
Composition	Binder (% by weight)<br>
SS	0.0 % sorbitan monooleate (water)<br>
TT	2% sorbitan monooleate<br>
UU	2% sorbitan monooleate<br>
The treated carbon blacks where compounded into various polymers using a Brabender mixer operating at 50 rpm and with an initial chamber temperature of 85* C. The mixing cycle time was 6 minutes. The compounds were assessed for melt viscosity at 130* C and a shear rate of 50s-1.<br><br>
The data illustrates a significant reduction in melt viscosity when using the designated binder, this would reflect in a reduction in die head pressure during the cable fabrication process. Visually this would be seen as an improvement is smoothness of the compound extrudate and also an increase in output rate.<br><br>
The polymers utilized represent typical types of polymer used in wire and cable formulations used for conductor and semi-conductive shield applications. The polymers containing either 18% vinyl acetate or ethyl acry'late are typically used in conductor or bonded semi-conductive shield applications while the polymer containing 40% vinyl acetate is more suitable for a strippable semi-conductive shield type product<br>
It should be clearly understood that the forms of the present invention herein described are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
