				<td>NOZZLE FOR SPRAYING OF A SURFACE<br>
The invention relates to a nozzle for spraying of a<br>
surface, comprising a housing having a feed channel with<br>
an outlet opening for the liquid to be sprayed, the<br>
outlet opening lying in the surface to be sprayed. The<br>
nozzle further comprises a piston rod that is centrally<br>
guided in the feed channel and has an impact disk that<br>
closes off the outlet opening in one end position, and<br>
lies at a distance in front of the outlet opening in a<br>
second end position, so that the exiting liquid is<br>
deflected into an annular spray jet directed against the<br>
surface.<br>
Nozzles of this type are known, for example, from<br>
DE 100 57 429 A1. They produce a rearwardly directed<br>
symmetrical spray fan forming a cone-shaped shell with a<br>
circular cross section. It has been found that with the<br>
use of such spray nozzles, excessive liquid is lost<br>
because, in part, areas are sprayed which do not need to<br>
be sprayed - as, for example, the edge areas of a<br>
surface.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide<br>
spray nozzles of the abovementioned type that provide an<br>
asymmetrical spray jet, with which it is possible to keep<br>
the sprayed surface smaller.<br>
To attain this purpose, the nozzle according to the<br>
invention includes a recess in the underside of the<br>
impact disk, facing the outlet opening, which extends<br>
parallel to the outer edge of the impact disk, and which<br>
extends approximately over half of the periphery of the<br>
impact disk. With this design it is possible for the<br>
water jet exiting through the annular gap around the<br>
piston rod to be deflected at a steeper angle back to the<br>
surface over that half of the periphery of the impact<br>
disk, so that an asymmetrical rearwardly directed annular<br>
spray fan is created, spraying a clearly smaller surface.<br>
An embodiment of the invention provides a lock<br>
against rotation of the impact disk associated with the<br>
piston rod in order to make sure that the more narrow<br>
area of the spray fan points always into a specific<br>
direction.<br>
The recess can in a further embodiment of the<br>
invention be trough-like and can follow a rounded area<br>
between the piston rod and the impact disk underside.<br>
The spray jet exiting along the rounded area in this<br>
region is therefore varyingly rearwardly deflected.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the inner<br>
edge of the recess can be arranged circularly about the<br>
axis of the piston rod, whereby a center section extends<br>
over an angle of approximately 90°. In outer areas<br>
adjacent to the center section, the inner edge of the<br>
recess can then extend outwardly approximately as<br>
straight lines from the center section, so that<br>
approximately half of the annularly exiting spray jet is<br>
deflected steeper downwardly and a smaller surface is<br>
sprayed in this manner.<br>
The lock against rotation of the piston rod can in a<br>
further embodiment of the invention consist of a cam<br>
guided in a groove inside of and parallel to the axis of<br>
the housing, wherein the cam can be part of a guide plate<br>
for the piston rod, fixed against rotation to the piston<br>
rod.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the drawings in<br>
connection with one exemplary embodiment and will be<br>
discussed hereinafter.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a partial cross-sectional side view of a<br>
nozzle according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective illustration of the piston<br>
rod with an impact disk, which piston rod is inserted<br>
into the nozzle according to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is a view of the underside of the impact<br>
disk viewed in direction of the arrow III of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view of Figure 3 in<br>
direction of the cross-sectional plane IV-IV.<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view of Figure 3 in<br>
direction of the cross-sectional plane V-V.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the nozzle of Figure 1 in the<br>
installed state and in operation, producing an<br>
asymmetrical rearwardly directed spray fan.<br>
The nozzle 1 according to Figure 1, which can also<br>
be identified as a deflector nozzle, consists of a<br>
housing 2a with a flange 2b, which is screwed through a<br>
thread 10 to said housing 2a. Flange 2b has openings 11<br>
distributed about its periphery for receiving screws (not<br>
illustrated) to secure the flange 2b into corresponding<br>
receiving bores 12, which are, for example, provided on a<br>
ring 13 arranged in an opening of a wall 3, the outside<br>
of which is to be sprayed for the purpose of cooling.<br>
The housing 2a has an offset cylindrical feed<br>
channel 14 for the liquid to be sprayed, the liquid being<br>
supplied (in a manner not illustrated in detail) from the<br>
connecting part of the housing 2a in direction of the<br>
arrow 15. A piston 4 is arranged in a section 14a of the<br>
feed channel 14, which section is larger in diameter, and<br>
which piston is fixedly mounted to the lower end of the<br>
piston rod 16. The piston 4 has through-openings 4a for<br>
the liquid to flow through and is used as a stop for a<br>
spiral coil spring 5 placed around the piston rod 16 with<br>
its other end on a guide plate 7 fixedly arranged in the<br>
housing 2a. Guide plate 7 is also provided with through-<br>
openings 7a for the liquid. The guide plate 7 is held in<br>
the housing 2a by an insert 17 that surrounds the piston<br>
rod 16, forming an annular gap 8. The piston rod 16 is<br>
provided with an impact disk 6 outside of the insert 17,<br>
which impact disk rests on the insert 17 in the<br>
illustrated position, and closes off an output opening<br>
ending at the surface 2c of the flange 2b. This surface<br>
2c of the flange lies, as illustrated in Figure 1, in a<br>
plane with the outer surface 3a of the wall 3, which in<br>
turn represents the surface to be sprayed for the purpose<br>
of cooling.<br>
The nozzle operates as follows:<br>
It can be recognized that when the liquid supply is<br>
released in direction of the arrow 15, the piston 4 is<br>
pressed upwardly against the action of the spring 5 until<br>
it hits the edge 18 of the cylindrical guide section 14a.<br>
The impact disk assumes in this position the position 6",<br>
in which the piston rod 16, as illustrated by dash-dotted<br>
lines, is moved upwardly. The liquid therefore exists<br>
under pressure through the annular gap 8, is guided<br>
upwardly on the outer surfaces of the piston rod 16, and<br>
is deflected outwardly through the rounded area 19<br>
adjacent to the surface 20 on the underside of the impact<br>
disk 6, 6", which surface extends approximately<br>
perpendicularly with respect to the axis 21 of the piston<br>
rod 16. As illustrated in Figure 6, the liquid is<br>
sprayed outwardly over a large surface in a flat spray<br>
fan 9, the reflection angle of which deviates only<br>
slightly from the horizontal. When several nozzles 1 are<br>
arranged on the surface 3a, these relatively large spray<br>
fans 9 can overlap so that a spraying covering the<br>
surface is possible.<br>
When the liquid pressure is turned off, the piston 4<br>
is returned by the spring 5 into the initial position<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, in which initial position the<br>
impact disk is aligned with the surface 3a to be sprayed.<br>
The spring force is to be selected so that the applied<br>
water pressure can overcome this spring force.<br>
Figure 6 shows that the spray fan 9 is asymmetrical.<br>
The liquid fan is deflected significantly more steeply<br>
against the surface 3a on the right side so that the<br>
entire sprayed surface is smaller than if a symmetrical<br>
circular-conical spray fan 9, as in the state of the art,<br>
would have been produced.<br>
This form of the spray fan 9 is achieved by<br>
providing the impact disk 6 with a recess 26 on its<br>
underside, which recess extends parallel to the outer<br>
edge of the impact disk 6 and stretches approximately<br>
over half of the periphery of the impact disk. This<br>
recess 26 can be clearly recognized in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
It is designed approximately trough-shaped, as can be<br>
seen in Figures 4 and 5. It becomes clear that the<br>
recess 26 follows the rounded area 19 between piston rod<br>
16 and impact disk 6 and has an inner edge 27 which<br>
extends in a center section between the points 28,<br>
circularly about the axis 21 of the piston rod 16. The<br>
inner edge then extends approximately rectilinearly or<br>
only slightly arched from the points 28 outwardly to the<br>
outer edge of the impact disk 6. These sections are<br>
identified with the reference numeral 29.<br>
This design has the result, as shown in Figure 6,<br>
that the spray fan 9 is directed with one leg 9a<br>
significantly steeper against the surface 3a to the side<br>
where the underside of the impact disk 6 has the recess<br>
26. As a result, an asymmetrical rearwardly steered<br>
spray fan 9 is created and the entire sprayed surface is<br>
smaller than if the spray fan 9 would have the form of a<br>
cone-shaped shell with a circular base.<br>
The just mentioned type of the asymmetrical spray<br>
fan with its alignment in a specific direction is<br>
guaranteed by a lock against rotation being associated<br>
with the piston rod 16. This exists in the exemplary<br>
embodiment by the piston 4 of the piston rod 16 engaging<br>
with an outwardly directed cam 4b an axially extending<br>
groove 14b of the flow-channel section 14a. The piston 4<br>
in turn is held locked against rotation on the piston rod<br>
16 by an inner projection 4c resting on a flattened area<br>
25 of the piston rod 16.<br>
One possibility of use for the nozzle according to<br>
the invention is, for example, the spraying of sidewalls<br>
of ships with the purpose to cool these and to then make<br>
them non-visible to infrared recognition. This new<br>
nozzle can thereby be used in edge areas of surfaces to<br>
be sprayed, beyond which a surface cooling is not desired<br>
or necessary.<br>
As is the case with nozzles according to the state<br>
of the art, the new nozzle can be used for the spraying<br>
of surfaces when larger superstructures for holding and<br>
servicing of the nozzle are not desired outside of the<br>
surface.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
