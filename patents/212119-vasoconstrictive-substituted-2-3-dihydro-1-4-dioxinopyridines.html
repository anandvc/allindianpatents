Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereoisomers may be separated by physical separation methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography. Enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously intended to be included within the scope of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof have interesting pharmacological properties in that they show 5HT1-like agonistic activity. The compounds of the present invention<br>
have a remarkable vasoconstrictor activity. They are useful to prevent and treat conditions which are related to vasodilatation. For instance, they are useful in the treatment of conditions characterized by or associated with cephalic pain, e.g. cluster headache and headache associated with vascular disorders, especially migraine. These compounds are also useful in the treatment of venous insufficiency and in the treatment of conditions associated with hypotension.<br>
The vasoconstrictor activity of the compounds of formula (I) can be determined using an in vitro-test as is described in "Instantaneous changes of alpha-adrenoreceptor affinity caused by moderate cooling in canine cutaneous veins" in the American Journal of Physiology 234(4), H330-H337,1978; or in the test described in the pharmacological example, wherein the serotonin-like response of the compounds of the present invention was tested on the basilar arteries of pigs.<br>
In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a particular compound, in base form or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be<br>
helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g. as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention therefore may be used as medicines in conditions related to vasodilatation, more in particular hypotension, venous insufficiency and especially cephalic pain among which migraine. The compounds of the present invention also provide a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from conditions related to vasodilatation, such as, hypotension, venous insufficiency and especially cephalic pain among which migraine by administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt or a stereoisomeric form thereof. Those skilled in the art could easily determine the effective amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 1 µg/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 2 µg/kg to 200 µg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.005 to 20 mg, and in particular 0.1 mg to 10 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention in all its aspects.<br>
Experimental part<br>
A) Preparation of the intermediates<br>
Example 1<br>
2-chloro-pyrimidine (24.3 g) was added portionwise to a mixture of 1,3-propanediamine<br>
(85 g) in toluene (240 mL) while stirring at reflux temperature. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred and refluxed for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled, the precipitate was<br>
filtered off and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was distilled in vacuo, yielding<br>
53 g (65.7%) of N-2-pyrimidiny-l,3-propanediamine (intermediate 1).<br>
Example 2<br>
A mixture of 3,6-dichloropyridazine (25 g), 1,3-propanediamine (62 g) and sodium carbonate (18 g) in ethanol (500 mL) was stirred and refluxed overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered over dicalite and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was crystallized from acetonitrile. The crystals were filtered off and dried, yielding 20.7 g of N-(6-chloro-3-pyridazinyl)-1,3-propanediamine; mp. 124.9°C (intermediate 2).<br>
Example 3<br>
Methanesulfonyl chloride (1.7 mL) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added dropwise to a mixture, cooled on an ice bath, of (±)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2,3-dihydro-l,4-dioxino-[2,3-b]-pyridine (2.4 g), prepared as described in Heterocycles, 3.6 (10), 2327 (1993), and N,N-diethylethaneamine (4 mL) in dichloromethane (45 mL) and the mixture was stirred at 5 °C for 1 hour. The precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was extracted with water. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated, yielding 3.54 g of (±)-2,3-dihydro-l,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridine-2-methanol methanesulfonate(ester) (intermediate 3). In a similar way was prepared:<br>
(±)-2,3-dihydro-l,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridine-3-methanol methanesulfonate(ester) (intermediate 4).<br>
B) Preparation of the final compounds Example 4<br>
Intermediate 3 (3.68 g) and intermediate 2 (6.22 g) were stirred at 100 °C for 1 hour. The mixture was purified first by an open column chromatography over silica gel (eluent: CH2Cl2/(CH3OH/NH3) 96/4) and then by HPLC (eluent: hexane/CH2Cl2/ (CH3OH/NH3) 10/9/1). The pure fractions were collected, evaporated and the residue was recrystallized from CH3CN, yielding 0.77 g (12%) of (±)-N-(6-chloro-3-pyridazinyl)-N-[(2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-1,3-propane-diamine (mp. 100.8 °C; compound 1).<br>

Intermediate 4 (1.98 g) and intermediate 1 (2.46 g) were stirred at 100 °C for 1 hour. The mixture was purified first by flash chromatography over silica gel (eluent: CH2CI2/ CH3OH 96/4, 94/6 and 90/10) and then by an other flash chromatography (eluent: CH2Cl2/(CH3OH/NH3) 96/4). The pure fractions were collected, evaporated and the residue was converted into the ethanedioic acid salt (1:1) in ethanol, yielding 1.26 g (40%)of(±)-N-[(2,3-dihydro-l,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)methyl]-N"-2-pyrimidinyl- 1,3-propanediamine ethanedioate(lrl) (mp. 193.6 °C; compound 2).<br>
In a similar way was prepared:<br>
(±)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-N-2-pyrimidinyl-1,3-<br>
propanediamine ethanedioate(l:1) (mp. 181.2 °C; compound 3).<br>
Pharmacological example Example 6<br>
Segments of basilar arteries taken from pigs (anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbital) were mounted for recording of isometric tension in organ baths. The preparations were bathed in Krebs - Henseleit solution. The solution was kept at 37 °C and gassed with a mixture of 95% O2 - 5% CO2. The preparations were stretched until a stable basal tension of 2 grams was obtained.<br>
The preparations were made to constrict with serotonin (3xl0-7 M). The response to the addition of serotonin was measured and subsequently the serotonin was washed away. This procedure was repeated until stable responses were obtained. Subsequently the test compound was administered to the organ bath and the constriction of the preparation was measured. This constrictive response was expressed as a percentage of the response to serotonin as measured previously. The lowest active concentration was defined as the concentration at which 50 % of the response to serotonin is obtained.<br>
Table 1 presents the lowest active concentrations of the compounds of formula (I). Table 1<br>
