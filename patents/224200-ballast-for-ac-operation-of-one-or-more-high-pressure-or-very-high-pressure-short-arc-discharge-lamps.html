				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating gas discharge<br>
lamps. Moreover) the invention relates to a ballast for operating<br>
gas discharge lamps.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
During operation of a gas discharge lamp (also termed lamp<br>
below), the type of rooting of the discharge on the electrode<br>
depends on whether the electrode emits electrons (cathode) or<br>
captures the electrons (anode). In the case of the anode, the<br>
discharge is distributively rooted over a large area of the<br>
electrode, while in the case of the cathode a focal spot (hot<br>
spot) is formed as a rule, as a result of which the discharge is<br>
rooted, in a punctiform. The point at which the focal spot is<br>
rooted depends on the electrode geometry, the electrode material<br>
and the temperature distribution on the electrode. These<br>
parameters are subject to changes during operation, such that the<br>
root point of the focal spot can change its position, and this is<br>
expressed by instability of the the gas discharge (arc<br>
instability), or flickering. This flickering occurs, in<br>
particular, in the case of operation of the lamp with alternating<br>
current, since an electrode alternaterly forms a cathode and<br>
anode, and therefore the focal spot must reform with each change<br>
of the anode to the cathode.<br>
So-called square-wave operationof the lamp is known, for example<br>
from US 4,485,434, for the purpose of reducing flickering. It has<br>
emerged that it is<br>
advantageous to select a square-wave lamp current<br>
instead of a sinusoidal one for the stability of the AC<br>
operation of high-pressure gas discharge lamps.<br>
Customary values for the frequencies of the square wave<br>
are from 50 Hz to 200 Hz. Square-wave operation has<br>
become established in the case, in particular, of<br>
applications in image-recording and projection<br>
technology, where the constancy of the luminous flux is<br>
important. Commutation which is as fast as possible is<br>
aimed at in order for the time interval in which the<br>
luminous flux does not correspond to the square-wave<br>
amplitude to be as short as possible.<br>
Despite the square-wave operation, the stability of the<br>
discharge is not yet satisfactory, in particular, in<br>
the case of short-arc high-pressure discharge lamps,<br>
which are preferred for use in projection technology.<br>
In order to improve the arc instability, PCT<br>
Application WO 95/35645 proposes a pulse-shaped rise in<br>
the lamp current at the end of a square wave period.<br>
The current rise is attended by a temperature rise<br>
which exerts a stabilizing influence on the position of<br>
the focal spot. Only approximate data are given on the<br>
duration and height of the pulses and on the operating<br>
frequency. Again, the mode or operation of the method<br>
is only indicated. Thus, the application of the method<br>
to a lamp of different design (for example with a<br>
different electrode geometry or different filling<br>
pressure) than the lamp addressed in the exemplary<br>
embodiment is possible only after extensive<br>
experimental work.<br>
However, it is not only a problem to fix a suitable<br>
shape of the current curve but, as is set forth below,<br>
it is also a problem to produce a desired shape of<br>
curve. The load circuit of an arrangement for operating<br>
a discharge lamp includes, inter alia, energy stores<br>
which can also be parasitic, and the lamp, which<br>
constitutes a non-linear load.<br>
The network of energy stores forms reasonant frequencies which<br>
can be excited by the nonlinear load. Particularly in the case of<br>
the operation of short-arc high-pressure lamps, this leads to<br>
long-lasting transient phenomena after the commutation of the<br>
lamp current in the square-wave operation. These oscillations are<br>
also to be observed in the luminous flux, of course. In the case<br>
of applications which require high frequency of the luminous flux<br>
(e.g. video projection), it is therefore neceessary to ensure<br>
that the time interval in which transient phenomena occur is<br>
short by comparison with the period of the square wave. The<br>
controller used in the relevant operating unit has a substantial<br>
influeence on the duration of the transient phenomenon. A<br>
variable which constitutes a measure of the lamp power and is<br>
compared with a reference measure is produced in conventional<br>
operating units for the said applications. The result of this<br>
comparison supplies the manipulated variable for the power<br>
section of the operating unit. The settling time for a<br>
light source with square-wave operation can be defined by the<br>
time which elapses from the commutation upto the instant at which<br>
the luminous flux has adjusted itself in a band of +/- 5% about<br>
the setpoint. For the abovedescribed, conventional controller,<br>
this settling time is 250 ms-300 ms. Since the settling time<br>
should be at most 10% of a half period of the square wave, it<br>
follows the frequencies of at most 200 Hz can be realized for the<br>
square wave conventional controllers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the discussion on the prior art, the object of the<br>
present invention tails into two parts! firstly, the invention is<br>
intended to provide a method which permits virtually flicker—free<br>
operation of a gas discharge lamp with clearly defined<br>
parameters.<br>
Secondly, the invention provides means with the aid of which the<br>
above method can be implemented.<br>
As explaimed in the discussion on the prior art, the cause of the<br>
flickering of a lamp is based on the fact that the focal spot,<br>
which constitutes the root of the gas discharge of the cathode,<br>
changes its position continuously. A more precise analysis shows<br>
that no focal spot is formed directly after an electrode<br>
commutates to the cathode. Rather, what is firstly found is an<br>
area-wide discharge root. Only after a thermal inhomogeneity has<br>
been produced on the cathode does the discharge become<br>
constricted and form a focal spot. According to the invention,<br>
flickering of the lamp can be greatly reduced by carrying out<br>
commutation of the lamp current before the discharge form a focal<br>
spot. Current edges which are steep with respect to time are<br>
required for an electrode to change as quickly as possible from<br>
cathode to anode, for which reason the method can be very<br>
effectively implemented by a square-wave current characteristic.<br>
Since a flicker-free operation is important, in particular, for<br>
applications in projection technology, the method is particularly<br>
important for lamps which are used in the case of such<br>
applications. These are chiefly high-pressure and extra-high-<br>
pressure discharge lamps and, because of the optical imaging<br>
qualities, particularly those having short discharge arcs. The<br>
frequency of the square-wave lamp current must be at least 300 Hz<br>
for such lamps, in order to satisfy the teaching of the method<br>
according to the invention.<br>
If the method is applied for the first time to a specimen lamp,<br>
or if the lamp has mean time been operated using a different<br>
method, it is possible despite the application of the method<br>
according to the invention for flickering phenomena to occur for<br>
a short time after the lamp is taken into operation. The rasons<br>
for this is an electrode structure which favors a quick formation<br>
of focal spots at different positions. The application of the<br>
method according to the invention, however shapes the electrodes<br>
in such a way as to exert a stabilising influence on the<br>
discharge arc. fhis produces a virtually flicker-free operation<br>
after a short time by means of the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
As described above, implementing the method according to the<br>
invention in the case of extra-high-pressure short-art lamps<br>
requires a frequency of at lest 300 Hz for the square-wave lamp<br>
current, while a frequency of at most 200 Hz can be implemented<br>
with operating units which include a conventional controller<br>
structure. The second part of the task of the present invention<br>
is to close this gap.<br>
It is usual in an operating unit for gas dischage lamps to<br>
generate an output voltage UA from a constant, so-called<br>
intermediate circuit voltage U0 with the aid of a clocked DC/AC<br>
converter. Said output voltage is a DC voltage which can be set<br>
by a manipulated variable Us. The DC/AC converter can be of<br>
various types, such as, for example, step-up, step-down or inverse<br>
converters. With these converters, the manipulated variable Us<br>
varies the pulse duty factor of the circuit breakers included in<br>
the converters. The square-wave operation of the lamp is mostly<br>
implemented by virtue of the fact that the output voltage UA has<br>
its polarity <br>
reversed by means of a full bridge circuit with the<br>
desired frequency for the square wave.<br>
The controlled variable of the operating unit is the<br>
power of the lamp (Pist) . In cases where the lamp power<br>
can be determined only expensively, and the power loss<br>
of the operating unit is sufficiently accurately known,<br>
the input power of the DC/DC converter can also be used<br>
as a controlled variable. In conventional operating<br>
units, Pist is compared with a setpoint Psoll, and the<br>
manipulated variable Us is determined therefrom,<br>
without the assistance of further measured variables,<br>
directly or after weighting by a control characteristic<br>
(P, PI, I, PID) . However, no short settling time after<br>
commutation of the lamp current is possible by means of<br>
this structure.<br>
According to the invention, the problem is solved by<br>
means of two measures: cascade control and feedforward<br>
control. Cascade control, as also applied in principle<br>
in the case of the so-called Current Mode in switched-<br>
mode power supplies, is implemented in the operating<br>
unit according to the invention by virtue of the fact<br>
that the weighted control difference from Pist and<br>
Psoll does not fix the value of the manipulated<br>
variable Us, but defines a setpoint for the lamp<br>
current Isoll. Isoll is compared with the value list,<br>
which constitutes a measure for the lamp current, and<br>
it is this result of comparison which first fixes the<br>
manipulated variable Us directly or after weighting by<br>
a control characteristic (P, PI, PID) . The feedforward<br>
control is implemented as follows in the operating unit<br>
according to the invention: the output voltage UA,<br>
which is to be measured at the lamp terminals, is also<br>
a determining factor for the lamp power. Auxiliary<br>
circuits (for example ignition circuits) and supply<br>
means can lead to fluctuations in the output voltage<br>
UA. Fluctuations in UA interfere in the control process<br>
particularly in the case of the transient reaction<br>
after commutation of the lamp current. Consequently, according to<br>
the invention Isoll is determined not only by the control<br>
difference of Pist and Psoll, but is also brought into dependence<br>
on the output voltage UA. This can also be performed by means of<br>
weighting with a control characteristic, it being preferred to<br>
select a differentiating characteristic in order to accentuate<br>
the fluctuations in UA.<br>
The ivnention is illustrated with the aid of the following<br>
figures.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the controller structure according to<br>
the invention, and the results which can be achieved therewith<br>
during operation of a gas discharge lamp are explained in more<br>
detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which :<br>
Figure 1 shows a flickering discharge,<br>
Figure 2 shows a flicker-free discharge,<br>
Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the controller structure,<br>
and<br>
Figure 4 shows a circuit diagram of a perferred exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 1 shows the discharge of a short-arc high-pressure lamp<br>
directly before commutation of the lamp current. The focal spot<br>
formed is to be seen. Such a discharge does not correspond to<br>
the teaching of the present invention, and therefore tends to<br>
produce flickering phenomena.<br>
Figyre 2 also shows the discharge of a short-arc high-pressure<br>
lamp immediately before commutation of the<br>
lamp current. However, the frequency of the square-wave<br>
lamp current is now so high that no focal spot is<br>
formed. This corresponds to the teaching of the present<br>
invention, for which reason this discharge exhibits<br>
only negligible flickering phenomena.<br>
Figure 3 shows a block diagram of a controller<br>
structure according to the invention. Since the aim is<br>
to control the lamp power in a primary control loop,<br>
the first step is to form the control difference from<br>
Pist and Psoll at a first subtraction point S1 and<br>
weight it with the aid of a control characteristic RC1.<br>
The control characteristic RC1 can be a P, PI, I or PID<br>
characteristic. The weighted signal is fed to a second<br>
subtraction point S2. The output voltage UA weighted<br>
with the aid of the control characteristic RC2 is<br>
subtracted. The control characteristic RC2 is expressed<br>
in Figure 3 in a preferred differential characteristic<br>
(DT1), but it can also fundamentally have a different<br>
characteristic (for example P, PI, I, or PID) . The<br>
feedforward control mentioned in the description<br>
section is implemented at the second subtraction point<br>
S2.<br>
The output of the second subtraction point S2<br>
constitutes the setpoint Isoll of the inner control<br>
loop of the cascade control mentioned in the<br>
description section. Isoll is compared at a third<br>
subtraction point S3 with a variable which corresponds<br>
to the value of the lamp current. The result of this<br>
comparison becomes the manipulated variable Us after<br>
weighting with a control characteristic RC3. The<br>
control characteristic RC3 can be a P, PI, or PID<br>
characteristic.<br>
Figure 4 shows a circuit in which the rule structure<br>
illustrated in Figure 3 is implemented. In what<br>
follows, components denoted by a R followed by a number<br>
are resistors, components which are denoted by a C<br>
followed by a number are capacitors, and components<br>
which are denoted by a T followed by a number are<br>
transistors. The central module is a Current Mode<br>
Controller UCC3800 available from the Unitrode company.<br>
This IC includes the first (S1) and the third (S3)<br>
subtraction points, possibilities for fixing the<br>
control characteristic RC3, and a circuit which<br>
generates the manipulated variable Us as a clock signal<br>
for driving the circuit breaker of the DC/DC converter<br>
mentioned in the descriptive section. This circuit<br>
breaker is typically a MOSFET whose time during which<br>
it is turned on is varied by a signal at the gate. This<br>
signal is available at the UCC3800 at pin 6 (OUT) . An<br>
internal oscillator is required to generate the signal.<br>
The frequency of the oscillator can be set by R108 and<br>
C103 if it is running freely. In this case, the DC/DC<br>
converter operates in so-called Continuous Mode. R108<br>
and C103 are connected in series. The tie point is<br>
connected to PIN 8 (REF) and a reference voltage of 5V.<br>
The other end of R108 is connected to PIN 4 (RC) , while<br>
the other end of C103 is connected to frame.<br>
Under specific operating conditions, which are not<br>
directly related to the invention, the DC/DC converter<br>
is put into the Discontinuous Mode by means of a<br>
circuit section which includes the components C6, Rl,<br>
R2, R107, T100, R106, C101, R105, D102, R104 and C102.<br>
This circuit section is controlled by the voltage at<br>
the drain of the abovementioned MOSFET. The series<br>
circuit of C6, Rl, R2 and R107 is situated between the<br>
drain and the operating voltage of 10.5V. The resistor<br>
R107 is simultaneously connected with one terminal to<br>
the operating voltage and the emitter of T100. The<br>
other terminal is connected to the base of T100. R106<br>
and C101 are connected to the collector of 7100. The<br>
other terminal of R106 is connected to frame, and the<br>
other terminal of C101 is connected to R105 and to the<br>
anode of D102. The other terminal of R105 is connected<br>
to frame, and the cathode of D102 is connected to R104<br>
and C102. The other terminal of R104 is connected to<br>
frame, and the other terminal of C102 is connected to<br>
pin 4 (RC) of the UCC3800.<br>
The UCC3800 is connected at pin 7 (VCC) and pin 5 (GND)<br>
to an operating voltage (10.5V) and frame. Psoll is fed<br>
in via pin 8 (REF) ; in this case, a reference voltage<br>
of 5V.<br>
The provision of Pist is served by the circuit section<br>
which includes the components Rll, R28, R29, R31, R117,<br>
R24, R25, IC11-B, R101 C13, C12, R20, R22 and IC11-A.<br>
IC11-A and IC11-B are operational amplifiers. At the<br>
output of IC11-A (pinl), the circuit section supplies a<br>
voltage which is proportional to the input power of the<br>
DC/DC converter. For this purpose, the intermediate<br>
circuit voltage UO is fed via the terminal UA1 to an<br>
inverting amplifier which includes the components Rll,<br>
R28, R25, R24 and IC11-B. Rll and R28 form a voltage<br>
divider between UA1 and frame. The signal at the<br>
connecting point of Rll and R28 is fed to the inverting<br>
input of IC11-B (pin6). The non-inverting input of<br>
IC11-B (pin5) is connected to a reference voltage of<br>
2.5V. The feedback resistor R25 is situated between the<br>
output of IC11-B (pin4) and the inverting input of<br>
IC11-B. The output of IC11-B is connected to the<br>
inverting input of IC11-A (pin2) via the series circuit<br>
of R24 and R101.<br>
The resistors R31, R29 and R117 are connected to the<br>
connecting point of R24 and R101. The other terminal of<br>
R29 is connected to frame, the other terminal of R117<br>
is connected to the reference voltage of 5V, and the<br>
other terminal of R31 leads to the terminal Poti. A<br>
potentiometer can be connected to frame via the<br>
terminal Poti, and the lamp power can be set thereby.<br>
The components R101, R22, C13, R20, C12 and IC11-A form<br>
an adder in which the amplified voltage signal UA1 and<br>
the signal which is fed via the terminal Source and is<br>
a measure of the input current is added.<br>
The signal from the terminal Source is fed to the non-<br>
inverting input of IC11-A (pin3) via R22. C13 is<br>
situated between the non-inverting input of IC11-A and<br>
frame. The series circuit of C12 and R20 is situated<br>
between the inverting input of IC11-A and the output of<br>
IC11-A.<br>
The addition constitutes an approximation of the<br>
multiplication at the operating point, as a result of<br>
which there is present at pin 1 of ICll-A a signal<br>
whose voltage value is a measure of the input power of<br>
the DC/DC converter. With the aid of C12, the adder<br>
simultaneously generates the control characteristic<br>
RCl, in this case a PI characteristic. A weighted Pist<br>
signal is therefore available at pin 1 of ICll-A.<br>
The input current, for which the signal fed via the<br>
terminal Source is a measure, is simultaneously a<br>
measure of the lamp current list given a constantly<br>
controlled input power and a constant intermediate<br>
circuit voltage UO. Consequently, in order to implement<br>
the inner control loop of the cascade control the<br>
signal of the terminal Source is fed via R114 to pin 3<br>
(CS), and thus to the third subtraction point S3, which<br>
is integrated in the UCC3800.<br>
The outer control loop of the cascade control is closed<br>
via R112, which connects the output of ICll-A and pin 2<br>
(FB) of the UCC3800. Pin 2 (FB) of the UCC3800<br>
simultaneously constitutes the signal Isoll and the<br>
second subtraction point S2. The output voltage UA of<br>
the DC/DC converter is present at the terminal UA. Via<br>
the series circuit of C100 and R111, it is fed to pin 2<br>
(FB) of the UCC3800, and the feedforward control<br>
described is thereby implemented. C100 and R111 form<br>
the control characteristic RC2; in this case a DT1<br>
characteristic.<br>
The control characteristic RC3 - in this case a PI<br>
characteristic - can be determined by the parallel-<br>
connected components C104 and R109, which are connected<br>
between pin 1 (COMP) and pin 2 (FB) of the UCC3800.<br>
The pin designations of the UCC3800 specified in<br>
brackets relate to the data sheet of the manufacturer,<br>
UNITRODE, Merrimack, USA.<br>
