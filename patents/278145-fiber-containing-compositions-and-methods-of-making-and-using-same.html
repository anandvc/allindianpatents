				<td>FIBER CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to ingestible compositions, particularly to compositions that deliver fiber to a mammal, and to methods of making and using such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well-known that fiber is an important part of the diet of mammals, particularly humans. Medical and nutrition professionals generally agree that dietary fiber is essential for good human health. Too little fiber in the diet is associated with diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and colon cancer. In addition, too little fiber often results in intestinal irregularity. Proper amounts of fiber in the diet stimulate bowel movement, slow down the gastrointestinal transition and digestion processes, modify fat absorption, and increase excretion of bile acids. In addition, some dietary fibers are known to lower blood cholesterol and benefit the postprandial (after eating) glycemic response.   In addition, various types of fiber and/or fiber components, for example, moderately fermentable fiber that is fermented by the intestinal flora of a user, has been shown to promote the growth and/or development of lactic acid bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of a user, at the expense of pathogenic bacteria, thus providing benefit to the user's gastrointestinal tract.<br>
However, it has also been documented that the average person in the United States does not eat enough dietary fiber, and often eats only about half of the recommended amount of fiber daily. Fiber intake can be increased by eating greater amounts of foods high in fiber such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. However, most consumers would have to almost double their intake of such foods to attain the recommended daily amount of fiber. Many consumers are unwilling or unable to eat large amounts of high fiber foods, and thus often look for supplements to provide the additional heeded fiber.<br>
To date there are several types and brands of fiber supplements available including powders, tablets, capsules, biscuits, breakfast cereals, laxative bevera'ges, and the like. However, many of<br>
these compositions have certain drawbacks and are not easily accepted by consumers due to various factors such as the lack of portability, for example of powders or beverages; the unpleasant taste, and texture and/or mouthfeel of many fiber containing materials; high calories of the supplement resulting from materials used to mask the taste and/or texture of the fiber, and excess gas produced in the user by many of the fiber containing materials. In addition, flavoring, taste masking, and texture enhancing materials added to the fiber supplement products result in a lessened amount of fiber that can be included in each unit of product. Therefore, consumers must ingest increased amounts of product to obtain the desired amounts of fiber. Such unpleasant and/or inconvenient properties often result in the user discontinuing use of the product.<br>
Recently there have been attempts to formulate fiber into a palatable, easily ingestible confectionary-type article, such as a soft chew. However, such chews are generally difficult to manufacture due to the propensity of the presence of too much fiber to result in a confection that is too hard and/or brittle for general consumer acceptance. Thus, many of the currently available confection-type products suffer from many of the noted drawbacks such as unpleasant taste and mouthfeel, high calories, and many also contain relatively small amounts of fiber, therefore requiring that the user ingest several units of product per day in order to obtain the desired amount of fiber.<br>
Therefore, there remains a need for a palatable, low calorie, consumer acceptable, composition that can provide high amounts of fiber, as well as methods of making and using such a composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. All percentages and ratios are calculated based on the total final composition unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Referenced herein may be trade names for components including various ingredients utilized in the present invention. The inventors herein do not intend to be limited by materials under a given trade name. Equivalent materials (e.g., those obtained from a different source under a different name or reference number) to those referenced by trade name may be substituted and utilized in the descriptions herein.<br>
As used herein "fiber" generally means material derived from plant cell walls and which is not digestable by human digestive enzymes, including soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. The fiber component can be naturally derived or synthetic. A portion of the fiber component can be non-starch polysaccharides, including soluble and insoluble fiber.<br>
As used herein "soluble fiber" means plant gums and oligosaccharides, or modified gums, modified celluloses, non-starch polysaccharides that are soluble in water, some of which can form viscous gels.<br>
As used herein "hu'mectant" means a substance hiving an affinity for water and which provides stabilizing action on the water content of a material. Hiimectahts prevent loss of moisture from<br>
foods, particularly flour-containing confectionaries, prevent sugar from crystallizing, and prevent growth of ice crystals in frozen foods.<br>
As used herein "surfactant" means a surface active agent that is both hydrophobia and hydrophilic, and is used to modify the surface properties of liquids.   A surfactant is any compound that reduces surface tension when dissolved in water or water solutions, or that reduces interfacial tension between two liquids (such as water compositions and oil compositions), or between a liquid and a solid.<br>
As used herein "carbohydrate" means sugars and digestable starches including monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.<br>
As used herein in the Examples, "DE" means "dextrose equivalent", which refers to the percent of reducing sugars on a dry basis calculated as dextrose. One of skill in the art would be familiar with the measure and terminology "DE" and "dextrose equivalent". Glucose (or com) syrups are formed by reacting a starch with an acid and/or an enzyme. DE is a measurement of the degree of hydrolysis that starches undergo. Standard com syrups generally have a DE of about 42. The higher the DE, the sweeter the component. However, higher DE also can contribute to a composition's greater tendency to crystallize, tendency to discolor, and tendency to be more hygroscopic, and can result in lower viscosity.<br>
COMPOSITIONS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention comprises a composition comprising at least about 25%<br>
of a fiber component, by weight of the composition, and a humectant component. The<br>
composition comprises at least about 0.001% of the humectant component, by weight of the<br>
composition.<br>

The compositions of the present invention can be formed into any suitable, ingestible form. Non-limiting examples of the form of the compositions include: soft chew, hard chew, chewable tablet, nutritional bar, lozenge, powder, granules, clusters, soft gel, semi-solid taffy-like chew, chewing gum, swallowable tablet, swallowable capsule, swallowable caplet, individual unit doses, user-dosable forms, and mixtures thereof.   For example, a unit dose can be a single soft chew, or a parti tionable form such as a bar which the user cuts or breaks to provide unit dosages.<br>
METHODS OF MAKING<br>
Example methods of preparing compositions of the present invention can comprise steps selected<br>
from the steps of:<br>
Adding water to a mixing vessel, at a temperature of about 25°C; and<br>
Mixing, at high or low shear, and adding a fiber component to the water in the mixing vessel until<br>
the fiber component is dissolved, and no visible lumps remain, to form a fiber-water mixture.<br>
This step can be done at about 25°C, or can be done heated at temperatures of from about 55°C to<br>
about 60°C.<br>
The resultant fiber-water mixture is highly viscous.<br>
A humectant component can be added while mixing the fiber and water by adding a humectant component to the mixing vessel and mixing until the mixture is homogeneous, thereby forming a fiber-humectant mixture. Additional fiber component can optionally be added to the fiber-humectant mixture at this step. Flavor, sweetener, color, and/or preservative components can be added at this step also.<br>
Such a mixture can then be processed in a mold, via a mold process, or extruded, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, and formed into unit dose forms such as soft chews that can be packaged individually into poly-lined foil wrappers (such as Inner Wraps 32700X available from Flexible Packaging, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The foil wrapped chews can then be placed in secondary packaging, non-limiting examples of which include glass bottles; plastic bottles; foil lined bags, cartons, or sleeves; and combinations thereof.<br>
Embodiments of the invention can include additional steps, after mixing a fiber component and water, and before preparing the final composition, such as adding a carbohydrate component, and/or a fat component, and/or flavor, sweetener, color, and preservative component. Such components can be prepared as separate "premixes" generally as follows.<br>
CarboKydrate Component Premix<br>
For preparation of a carbohydrate component, steps include:<br>
Combining a non-reducing sugar and a reducing sugar in a mixing vessel to form a carbohydrate mixture; and<br>
Heating the carbohydrate mixture to a temperature of between about 130°F to about 170°F (about 54°C to about 77°C), alternatively to a temperature of about 165°F (about 74°C). Once the carbohydrate mixture is formed it can be combined with the fiber-water mixture, or fiber-humectant mixture, by: adding to the carbohydrate mixture the fiber-water mixture and heating at a temperature of about 165°F (about 74°C) for about 15 minutes, until a homogeneous carbohydrate-fiber slurry is produced. The carbohydrate-fiber mixture is cooked until the solids content is between about 75% and 85%, alternatively between about 80% and 82%, by weight of the resulting cooked carbohydrate-fiber mixture. The cooked carbohydrate-fiber mixture can then be combined with a fat mixture as described below. The carbohydrate-fiber mixture can be stored temporarily in a jacketed holding vessel until needed. As would be understood by one of skill in the art, a jacketed vessel can be easily heated or cooled.<br>
Fat Premix<br>
For preparation of a fat component, steps include:<br>
Heating a jacketed vessel to a temperature of from about 125°F (about 52°C) to about 170°F<br>
(about 77°C), alternatively from about 145°F (about 63°C) to about 165°F (about 74°C);<br>
alternatively to about 150°F (about 66°C).<br>
Adding a fat component to the jacketed vessel and melting the fat component while stirring;<br>
While stirring, adding a surfactant component and optionally flavor components such as milk<br>
compounds and/or cocoa;<br>
Mixing until the mixture is homogeneous, about 15 minutes.<br>
The fat mixture can be stored temporarily in a jacketed holding vessel until needed.<br>
To create the final mixture, the fat mixture can be combined with the cooked carbohydrate-fiber<br>
component as described below.<br>
Final Mixture<br>
For preparation of the final mixture, steps can include:<br>
Adding, in a separate mixing vessel, at about 25°C, the fat mixture and mixing the fat mixture;<br>
Optionally adding a humectant component if not already added into the fiber-water mixture and mixing;<br>
Adding a portion of dry fiber component and mixing;<br>
Optionally adding sweetener, color, and/or preservative components and mixing; Adding the cooked carbohydrate-fiber mixture, via pipes connected from the vessel containing the cooked carbohydrate-fiber mixture to the vessel containing the final mixture, the pipes being heated to a temperature of about 180°T (about 82°C) to maintain the cooked carbohydrate-fiber mixture at a temperature of between about 130°F to about 170°F (about 54°C to about 77°C), and mixing;<br>
Optionally adding flavor components and mixing; and<br>
Unloading the final mixture into one or more transfer totes (vessels used to transfer the final mixture from the mixing vessel into a pre-kneader); and<br>
Processing the final mixture via extrusion through either a single or double screw extruder, alternatively a double screw extruder, to produce an extrudate that can be formed into individual unit soft chew dosages.<br>
It may be advantageous to coat the interior of the transfer tote with a food grade transfer aid, non-limiting examples of which include soybean oil and com starch.<br>
Extrusion can be done, for example by adding the final mixture, adjusted to a temperature of from about 100°F (about 38°C) to about 120°F (about 49°C), to a pre-kneader, then into a final rope extruder; cooling via a cooling tunnel (cooled to from about 40°F (about 5°C) to about 80°F (about 27°C)), and knife cutting into individual pieces to form soft chews. The temperature of the final mixture, before delivery into the pre-kneader can be adjusted in various ways, non-limiting examples of which include: making the final mixture in a jacketed vessel, adjusting the temperature of either or both the cooked carbohydrate-fiber mixture and/or the fat mixture in the holding vessel(s) prior to adding to the final mixing vessel, and combinations thereof.<br>
The soft chews can be wrapped in poly-lined foil wrappers (such as Inner Wraps 32700X available from Flexible Packaging, Toronto Ontario; Canada) or other protective barriers.

Embodiments of the present invention also includes methods of delivering a safe and effective amount of a fiber component to a user. As used herein, a "safe and effective amount" means an amount of fiber component effective to deliver one or more of the following benefits: laxation; increased stool volume and moisture content; intestinal regularity; slowed gastrointestinal transition and digestion processes; modified fat absorption; aiding in weight management; increasing excretion of bile acids; aiding in lowering blood cholesterol; benefiting the postprandial glycemic response; aiding growth and/or development of beneficial gastrointestinal microorganisms; as well as helping to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and colon cancer.<br>
A method of delivering a safe and effective amount of fiber component to a user comprises the user ingesting from about 1 to about 20 unit doses per day of a composition comprising at least about 25% of a fiber component, by weight of the composition; and a humectant component.<br>
To deliver a desired amount of fiber component per day, a user can ingest from about 1 to about 20, alternatively from about 1 to about 10, and alternatively from about 1 to about 5 unit doses of the composition per day, i.e. for example, from about 1 to about 20 soft chews per day. Each unit dose can comprise from about 1 to about 3 grams of fiber component, and alternatively from about 2 to about 2.5 grams of fiber component. Therefore, for example, if a user wished to ingest 10 grams of fiber per day, the user would ingest from about 4 to about 5 unit doses per day. If the user wished to ingest 20 grams of fiber per day, the user would ingest about 10 unit doses per day.<br>
