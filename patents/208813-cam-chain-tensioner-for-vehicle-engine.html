				<td>[Detailed Description ot the invention] <br>
(Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a cam tensioner for a vehicle engine where a rotary member is at least partly immersed in oil housed in an operating<br>
chamber defined between a crankcase and a crankcase cover and is fixedly coupled to a crankshaft; an oil sump opens on a bottom of a cam chain chamber which houses a cam chain for transmitting power to a cam shaft from the crankshaft, and is formed in an engine body in order to feed oil to an oil chamber and maintain a push rod at a predetermined position, with the cam chain being movable in the cam chain chamber.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
The foregoing cam chain tensioner for a vehicle is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 9-49433.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the related art, oil supplied to a cylinder head and its peripheral area is collected and returned to an oil sump. Therefore, the amount of oil returned to the oil sump varies immediately after an engine is started or when an engine body swings, so that the operation of a push rod tends to become unstable due to not enough oil being stored in the oil sump. [0004]<br>
This invention has been contemplated in order to overcome the foregoing problems of the related art, and is intended to provide a cam chain tensioner for a vehicle, in which during the operation of an engine, a predetermined amount of oil is supplied to an oil sump in order to guarantee the reliable operation of a push rod. Further, it is possible to reduce friction loss of a rotating member which scatters oil in an operating chamber.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present invention is characterized by a cam chain tensioner for a vehicle engine, wherein: a crankcase cover is attached to a crankcase of an engine body and defines an operating chamber with the crankcase; a drive sprocket and a rotating member having at least a part thereof immersed in oil housed in the<br><br><br><br>
operating chamber for the purpose of scattering oil therein are fixedly attached to a crankshaft rotatably supported by the crankcase, in the operating chamber; a cam chain chamber houses an endless cam chain extending around a driven sprocket fixedly coupled to the drive sprocket and a cam shaft, the cam chain being movable in the cam chain chamber, and the cam chain chamber has a bottom thereof positioned above a bottom of the operating chamber, is formed in the engine body and extends substantially along the length of a vehicle; a push rod having one end thereof connected with a tension member in contact with the cam chain is urged by a spring to operate the tension member which tensions the cam chain; an oil sump capable of feeding oil to an oil chamber where the push rod has the other end thereof housed in order to maintain a position thereof against reactive force from the cam chain is provided in the engine body and opens on a bottom of the cam chain chamber on the side of the operating chamber, is capable of collecting oil scattered in response to the rotation of the rotating member, and communicates with the operating chamber via a throttle hole.<br>
According to the foregoing feature, oil scattered by the rotating, member that rotates in response to the rotation of the crankshaft can be collected in the oil sump. During the operation of the engine, a predetermined amount of oil can be reliably stored in the oil sump, thereby assuring reliable operation of the push rod. Since some of the oil is returned to the oil sump, a level of oil in the operating chamber is lowered, which is effective in reducing friction loss of the rotating member.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a cam chain tensioner for a vehicle engine in which a crankcase cover is attached to a crankcase of an engine body and defines an operating chamber with the crankcase;<br>
a drive sprocket and a rotating member having at least a part thereof immersed in oil housed in the operating chamber for the purpose of scattering oil therein are fixedly attached to a crankshaft rotatably supported by the crankcase, in the operating chamber;<br>

The spring 141 then urges the tension arm 130 around via the push rod 132 by tensioning the cam chain 127 using the tension sprocket 131.<br>
A check valve 143 is provided at the lower part of the push rod 132 and a through-hole 144 is provided at the upper part of the push rod 132 so that oil within the oil sump 137 can pass through the push rod 132.<br>
The check valve 143 permits the flow of oil into the oil chamber 140 when the push rod 132 moves upwards due to the spring force of the spring 141 and becomes locked when the push rod 132 is pushed downwards, i.e. the position of the push rod 132 is maintained when a reactive force is received from the rubber chain 127 urged in the direction<br>
of tensioning so that the oil chamber 140 is locked.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, a through hole 145 is provided at the left crankcase 35 so that the oil sump 137 is made to communicate with the lower parts within the left and right crankcases 35 and 36. Ribs 147 and 148 are provided at so as to be mutually in contact at the left and right crankcases 35 and 36 and form an oil sump 146 communicating with the through hole 145 between the bottoms of the crankcases 35 and 36. Each rib 147 and 148 is formed in an arc shape so as to come into contact with and be opposite t he outer periphery of the crankshaft 40 and the output gear 93. The upper end of each rib 147 and 148 is arranged at a position substantially corresponding to the bottom wall 142a of the cam chain chamber 142.<br>
Also, a throttle hole 149 for causing a bottom part of the oil sump 146 to be connected to the lower part of the operating chamber 106 is provided in the crankcase 35, and a throttle hole 150 for returning oil that has flowed to the crankshaft 40 and the output gear 93 side to a lower part within the operating chamber 106.<br>
When the engine E is stopped, oil collects inside the operating chamber 106 up to the Ls shown in Fig. 7, but with operation of the engine E, oil that has scattered as a result of rotation of a rotor 109 becomes collected in the sumps 137 and 146, and return of oil from the sump 146 to the operating chamber 106 is squeezed though the throttle hole 149 which means that when the engine E is operating the oil level changes to a fixed level in the sumps 1 37 and 147 shown by the line Lo, and a portion b of the ring gear 121 that is soaked in the oil becomes small.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, an oil collecting chamber 153 having an inlet 153 for taking in oil that has been scattered by the ring gear 121 inside the operating chamber 106 is formed at an upper part between the crankcase 35<br>
including the case portion 35a and the crankcase cover 105 by bringing ribs 154 and 155 respectively provided in the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover 105 into contact with each other.<br>
The oil collecting chamber 153 is formed between the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover 105 with the inlet 152 arranged so as to receive oil that has been scattered by rotation of the ring gear 121 an moved along the inner surfaces of the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover 105. Guide walls 156 and 157 are provided in the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover 105 for guiding oil that has moved along these inner surfaces into the inlet 152.<br>
Further, the oil collecting chamber 153 is formed so as to be apart from the inlet 152 and slightly lower. Pairs of contacting control walls 161, 162 and 163, 164 are formed in the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover 105 so as to rise from the bottom 153a of the oil collecting chamber 153. Using these control walls, the inside of the oil collecting chamber 153 is divided up into a plurality, for example 3, collecting sections 158, 159 and 1 60 that are progressively lower the further they are away from the inlet 152. Each control wall 161, 162, and 163, 164, is formed so as to cause oil to progressively overflow from an uppermost collecting section 158, through a middle collecting section 159 to a lowermost collecting section 160.<br>
Also, each of the collecting sections 158, 159 and 160 can supply oil to respectively different sections to be lubricated. A lubricating oilway 165 for supplying oil to parts of the gear trains 98 - 101 and to a start clutch 95 is provided coaxially with a main shaft 96 of a transmission M so as to pass through the collecting section 158, a lubricating oilway 166 for supplying oil to other parts of the gear trains 98 - 101 is provided coaxially with a final shaft 97 of a transmission M so as to pass through the collecting section 159, and a lubricating oilway 167 for supplying oil to the<br>
cam shaft 47 is provided in the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover<br>
105 so as to pass through the collecting section 160.<br>
[0054]-<br>
Oil also becomes stirred up between left and right crankcases 35 and 36 by the crankshaft 40 and the output gear 93. As shown by arrow 168 in Fig. 3, the oil is scattered in an upward direction by the crankshaft 40 and the output gear 93, but guide walls 169... for introducing oil that has been scattered upwards as shown by the arrow 168 in between parts of the crankshaft 40 and crankshaft 45 that are to be lubricated are provided in the left and right crankcases 35 and 36, being formed in an annular shape corresponding to the input gear 94, start clutch 95 and each of the gear trains 98 - 101. Oil dropping from the lubricating oilway 165 inside the main shaft 96 via the lubrication sections of the gear trains 98 - 101 is also guided towards the crankshaft 40 and the crankshaft 45 by the guide walls 169... [0055}-<br>
Next, the operation of this embodiment will be described. A power unit P is swingable supported on a vehicle frame F via a swing arm 53 connected to the engine body 34 of the engine E. However, the swing arm 53 is swingably connected to the vehicle frame F so as to maintain a gap between the cylinder head 38 of the engine E and a carburetor 74. Because of this, it is possible to extremely effectively prevent detrimental effects due to heat from the cylinder head 38 affecting the carburetor 74 due to the fact that the swing arm 53 exists between the cylinder head 38 and the carburetor 74, and also to extremely effectively prevent lowering of the efficiency of the carburetor 74 due to heat from the cylinder head 38. Further, the swing arm 53 is for swingably supporting the power unit P on the vehicle frame F, there is no need to provide a member specially for preventing the carburetor 74 being adversely affected by heat from the cylinder head 38 and it is possible to avoid increasing the number of components.<br>
Also, the carburetor 74 is fixed to the swing arm 53, an intake pipe 82 fixed to the swing arm 53 and linking to the cylinder head 38 passes through the swing arm 53 and is connected the carburetor 74, which means that high strength is not required to support the carburetor 74 on the intake pipe 82 and the intake pipe 82 can be made small in size and light in weight. By supporting the carburetor 74 rigidly with the swing arm 53 it is possible to avoid vibrations of the engine body 34 adversely affecting the carburetor 74 and to prevent the efficiency of the carburetor 74 being lowered due to vibrations.<br>
As a result of rotation of the ring gear 121 inside the operating chamber 106, oil inside the operating chamber 106 is stirred and scattered by the ring gear 121 but an oil sump 137 for collecting this scattered oil is formed in the bottom 124a of a cam chain chamber 124 inside of which a cam chain 127 wound around a drive sprocket 125 and a driven sprocket 126 moves, so as to open into an end part of the side of the operating chamber 106. Since the oil sump 137 is linked to the operating chamber 106 through the throttle hole 149, the surface of the oil inside the operating chamber 106 becomes lowered due to some of the oil draining into the oil sump 137 when the engine E is operating, and accordingly it is possible to reduce friction loss due to rotation of the ring gear 121. [0058] -<br>
The oil sump 137 can supply oil to an oil chamber 140 caused to face one end of a pushrod 132 having the other end connected to a tension sprocket 131 contacting the cam chain 127, and enables reliable operation of the push rod 132 by gathering oil accumulating in the oil sump 137 when the engine E is operating.<br>
An oil collecting chamber 153 having an inlet 152 for receiving oil that has been scattered by rotation of the ring gear 121 within the operating chamber 106 is formed between the left crankcase 35 and the crankcase cover 105, the inside of the oil collecting chamber 153 is divided<br><br>
up into a plurality of collecting sections 158, 159 and 160 that are progressively lower the further they are away from the inlet 152 and are respectively connected to different sections that are to be lubricated. Also, each of control walls 161, 162, and 163, 164, is formed so as to cause oil to progressively overflow from an uppermost collecting section 158, through a middle collecting section 159 to a lowermost collecting section 160. Accordingly, oil that has accumulated inside the oil collecting chamber 153 overflows through the control walls 161 and 162, 163 and 164 inside the oil collecting chamber 153 to progressively drain to the collecting sections 158<br>
-	159 and oil that has drained into the respective oil collecting sections 158<br>
-	159 is supplied to respectively supplied to corresponding sections to be<br>
lubricated, which means that it is possible to supply an appropriate amount<br>
of oil to each of the sections to be lubricated.<br>
