FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to a device for transferring fluid, and more<br>
particularly to a fluid transfer insert for a component in a transmission<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The statements in this section merely provide background information<br>
related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior art.<br>
Automatic transmissions typically include a hydraulic circuit or<br>
system that uses a hydraulic fluid, such as oil, for various purposes<br>
throughout the transmission For example, the hydraulic system may direct<br>
oil to various transmission components to act as lubrication between moving<br>
components, to act as a cooling system for dissipating waste heat, and to act as<br>
a hydraulic control system for actuating various devices<br>
In many applications it may be desirable to transmit fluid along<br>
the length of a shaft, such as a turbine shaft or input/ output shaft However,<br>
these shafts are preferably hollow to reduce weight and cost since most of the<br>
strength of the shaft is provided by the outer diameter of the shaft, thereby<br>
making interior material unnecessary Various methods have been employed to<br>
transmit fluid along the length of a shaft, such as non-concentric bore holes<br>
and multiple sleeves<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended<br>
to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses<br>
With reference to FIGS 1A and 1B, an exemplary shaft assembly is<br>
illustrated and indicated by reference number 10. In he example provided, the<br>
shaft assembly 10 is a turbine shaft used in a transmission, however it should<br>
be appreciated that various other shafts may be employed without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention The shaft assembly 10 defines a linear<br>
axis 11 and includes a generally cylindrical shaft portion 12<br><br>
having an outer surface 14 and an inner surface 16. The inner surface 16<br>
defines a bore 18 that is coaxial to the axis 11 The bore 18 communicates with<br>
an opening 20 located in a terminal end of the shaft portion 12 The bore 18<br>
includes a first stepped portion 22 proximate an end of the bore 18 opposite<br>
the opening 20 and a second stepped portion 24 proximate to the opening 20.<br>
The outer surface 14 includes a plurality of fluid ports, indicated by reference<br>
numbers 26A-26L, that communicate between the outer surface 14 of the shaft<br>
assembly 10 and the bore 18 The fluid ports 26A-L are preferably spaced along<br>
a length of the shaft portion 12, though the locations of the fluid ports 26A-L<br>
on the outer surface 14 may vary without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention Additionally, the number of fluid ports 26A-L may vary<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention The fluid ports<br>
26A-L are operable to receive one or more fluid flows of a pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid, such as oil A plurality of radial seals 28 are sealingly engaged to the<br>
outer surface 14 and to a sleeve (not shown) or other structure that supports<br>
the shaft assembly 10 The radial seals 28 are located surrounding each of the<br>
fluid ports 20A-L to hydraulically isolate each of the fluid ports 20A-L The<br>
outer surface 14 may include various other features, such as gear teeth 30 for<br>
engaging a gear (not shown), without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention<br>
With reference to FIG 2 and continued reference to FIGS 1A and 1B, a<br>
fluid transfer insert, generally indicated by reference number 50, is employed<br>
to transfer the hydraulic fluid flows between the fluid ports 26A-L The fluid<br>
transfer insert 50 includes a generally cylindrical body portion 2 having an<br><br>
inner surface 54, an outer surface 56, a first end 58, and a second end 60. The<br>
inner surface 54 defines a central passage 62 that is coaxial with the body<br>
portion 52 The central passage 62 communicates with an opening 64 located<br>
in the first end 58 and with a pair of fluid ports 65 located in the outer surface<br>
56 proximate the second end 60<br>
The outer surface 56 defines a plurality of fluid channels 66A-D that<br>
extend parallel to the axis of the body portion 52 In the particular example<br>
provided, the fluid transfer insert 50 includes four fluid channels 66A-D sized<br>
and spaced to communicate with the exemplary number and location of the<br>
fluid ports 26A-L in the shaft assembly 10, though any number of fluid<br>
channels 66 may be included without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention The fluid channels 66A-D are each defined by a bottom surface 70, a<br>
first end wall 72 a second end wall 74, and a pair of side walls 76 Additionally,<br>
the fluid channels 66A-D have a top surface defined by the inner surface 16 of<br>
the shaft 12. In the example provided, each of the side walls 76 are at a right<br>
angle to the bottom 70 The fluid channels 66A-D extend into the body portion<br>
52 to a predefined depth and width and have a predefined length Accordingly,<br>
each of the fluid channels 66A-D may have different depths and widths to<br>
accommodate various amounts of fluid flow and different lengths to<br>
accommodate the locations of the various fluid ports 26A-L, as will be<br>
described in further detail below For example, fluid channels 66A and 66C<br>
have a length greater than a length of fluid channels 66B and 66D<br>
Additionally, the fluid channels 66A-D are spaced equally circumferentially<br>
apart along the outer surface 56 in the example provided<br><br>
The fluid transfer insert 50 also includes a racial flange 80 that<br>
extends radially along the edge of the second end 60. A key or protuberance 82<br>
extends out from the radial flange 80 The key 82 is used to orient the fluid<br>
transfer insert 50 relative to the shaft assembly 10, as will be described in<br>
further detail below.<br>
The fluid transfer insert 50 is sized to be press fitted within the bore 18<br>
of the shaft assembly 10 More specifically, the fluid transfer insert 50 is inserted<br>
within the bore 18 such that the first end 58 of the fluid transfer insert 50 abuts<br>
the first stepped portion 22 and the radial flange 80 abuts the second stepped<br>
portion 24 The outer surface 56 of the fluid transfer insert 50 sealmgly engages<br>
the inner surface 16 of the shaft assembly 10 The key 82 fits within an aperture<br>
84 formed in the shaft portion 12 of the shaft assembly 10 in order to radially<br>
align the fluid transfer insert 50 with respect to the shaft assembly 10 The fluid<br>
transfer insert 50 is preferably held in place by a snap ring 86, though various<br>
other methods of securing the fluid transfer insert 50 within the shaft assembly<br>
10 may be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
In the particular example provided, the fluid transfer insert 50 is aligned<br>
or oriented with the shaft portion 12 such that fluid channel 66A is aligned and<br>
communicates with fluid ports 26B and 26E, fluid channel 66C is aligned and<br>
communicates with fluid ports 26H and 26K, fluid channel 66B is aligned and<br>
communicates with fluid ports 26C and 26D, and fluid channel 66D is aligned<br>
and communicates with fluid ports 261 and 26J Additionally, fluid ports 65<br>
align with fluid ports 26F and 26L Accordingly, fluid flow entering one of the<br><br>
fluid ports 26B, 26C, 26H, 261 passes into a fluid channel 66A-D in<br>
communication with the fluid ports 26B, 26C, 26H, 261 and is communicated<br>
along the length of the fluid transfer insert 50 to exit at one of the fluid ports<br>
26D, 26E, 26J, and 26K Therefore, the length of any given fluid channel 66A-<br>
D is at least equal to the distance between any two fluid ports 26B-E. 26H-K<br>
that communicate with the given fluid channel 66A-D Additionally, fluid flow<br>
received by the fluid ports 26A and 26G may enter the bore 18 and pass<br>
through the opening 64 and into the central passage 62 of the fluid transfer<br>
insert 50 The fluid flow may then communicate through the fluid ports 65 and<br>
into the fluid ports 26F and 26L It should be appreciated that the fluid flows<br>
may communicate in any direction through the shaft assembly 10 and the fluid<br>
transfer insert 50 without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention<br><br>
