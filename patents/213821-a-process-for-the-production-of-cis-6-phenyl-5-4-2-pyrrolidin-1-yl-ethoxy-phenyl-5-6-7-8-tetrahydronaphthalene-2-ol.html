Detailed Description of The Invention<br>
This invention comprises using microorganisms to effect O-demethylation of an intermediate in the synthesis of CP-336,156 (estrogen agonist/osteoporosis). Use of microbes eliminates the chemical step which produces methyl bromide, a greenhouse gas which is difficult and expensive to trap, as a byproduct.<br>
The biotransformation may be carried out using whole cell cultures of the micoorganisms, cell extracts of the microorganisms, or purified enzymes from the microorganisms.<br>
The starting material for this microbial biotransformation is CP-324,098, which is a mixture of the c/s diastereomers. Three fungi have been found which carry out this reaction with different stereoselectivities. Cunninghamella echinulata O-demethylates both diastereomers to form the racemic mixture named CP-3 19,609, which is comprised of the diastereomers CP-<br>
336,156 and CP-335,992. Monosporium olivaceum and Thamnostylum piriforme act on only one of the diastereomers in CP-324,098 and yield a single diastereomer product as indicated below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The starting material and the products made by these three organisms were determined by chiral HPLC as shown in FIGS 1-4. The final products of the reactions of all three microorganisms were isolated from the fementation broth and characterized by NMR MS, and chiral HPLC to confirm their identity<br>
Having described the invention in general terms, reference is now made to specific examples. It is to be understood that these examples are not meant to limit the present invention, the scope of which is detemined by the appended claims<br>
Monosporium olivaceum ATCC 36300 and Thammostylum piriforme ATCC 8992 can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. A culture so obtained is added to a suitable growth medium and is incubated with shaking until growth occurs. The cultures thus prepared are used to inoculate slants. Portions of these slants are frozen as master stocks. The respective microorganisms are inoculated from slants into two flasks containing a growth medium whose composition is shown below. The fermentation is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 22 to about 32; however, for optimum results it is preferable to conduct the fermentation at about<br>
28. The pH of the medium is controlled at about pH 6-7 by the use of suitable organic or inorganic buffers incorporated into the fermentation medium or by periodic addition of a base. Good growth of the microorganism is achieved within 48 to 72 hours. The contents of the flasks are transferred to a Fernbach flask containing fresh growth medium having the same composition as the previously used growth medium. Variation of the medium will alter the yield of the compound and its rate of production. The preferred media composition is set forth in the example section. After shaking for one additional day, a sterile-filtered solution of rapamycin in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamdide is added. The fermentation is continued for one to six days. It is preferred to continue the fermentation for about two days.<br>
A suitable growth medium for use in the process of this invention will contain a source or sources of assimilable carbon, assimilable nitrogen and inorganic salts containing essential minerals. In general, many carbohydrates such as glucose, maltose, mannose, sucrose, starch, glycerin, millet jelly, molasses, soy bean and the like can be used as sources of assimilable carbon. Sources of assimilable nitrogen include such materials as yeast and casein hydrolysates, primary yeast, yeast extracts, cottonseed flour, soybean solids, wheat germ meat extracts, peptone, corn steep liquor, and ammonium salts. The inorganic salt nutrients which can be incorporated in the culture medium are the customary salts yielding sodium, iron, magnesium, potassium, cobalt, phosphate and the like. In general, of course, the techniques employed and are not intended to be limiting.<br>
Suitable grow media include (a) dextrose (20 g), yeast extract (5g), soy flour (5 g), NaCI (5g), K2HPO4 (5g) and distilled water (1000 milliliters) where the pH is adjusted to 7.0 with aqueous HCI; (b) dextrin (10g), beef extract (3 g), ardamine pH (5g), N-Z amine type E (5 g), MgSO47H2O (0.,5 g), KH2PO4 (0.37 g), CaCO3 (0.5 g), distilled water (1000 milliliters) where the pH is adjusted to 7.1 with aqueous HCI followed by a second stage of glucose (10 g), Hy-Case SF (2 g), beef extract (1 g), corn steep liquor (3 g), distilled water (1000 milliliters) where the pH is adjusted to 7.0; (c) glucose (10 g), corn step liquor (6 g), KH2PO4 (3 g), CaCO3 (3.5 g), Soybean oil (crude, 2.2 milliliters), yeast extract (2.5 g), distilled water (1000 milliliters) where the pH is adjusted to 7.0 - 7.3 with aqueous HCI; (d) malt syrup (20 g), soybean mean (5 g), casein (1 g), dried yeast (1 g), NaCI (5g), distilled water (1000 milliliters); (e) lactose (75 g), Pharmamedia (substitute yeast extract, 40 g), CaCO3 (10 g), Na2SO3 (4 g), distilled water (1000 milliliters); (f) ISP #3; (h) ISP#4; (I) ISP#5 and the like.

Inoculate from slants or frozen stock cultures into 25 ml of the medium above in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubate with shaking at 28°C for 2-3 days. Transfer 2.5 ml into 25 ml of fresh broth in an Erlenmeyer flask and shake another day. Add CP-324,098 dissolved in DMSO and filter sterilized to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Additional substrate can be fed at 1 day intervals. Continue incubation with shaking for 1-6 days.<br>
Extraction and purification<br>
Broth was extracted with twice its volume of ethyl acetate in a separatory funnel. The phases were separated by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 minutes after which the upper ethyl acetate phase was carefully removed and evaporated to dryness. Methanol also works well as an extraction solvent. The product can be purified using solid phase extraction and preparative HPLC.<br>
