The principal object of this invention is to provide a lampholder which is disconnected from supply once the bulb or test cap is removed from the lampholder thereby avoiding the risk of electrocution even when the fingers or any part of the body is in contact with the pins of this Safety Screwless Pushbar Lampholder Switch. The said Lampholder also provides with screwless main and earth terminals to which the main and earth wires can be fixed by simply inserting the wire into the terminals and the said lampholder is further provided with square stopper for nipple in the entry threads to protect the nipple to touch the live wire.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, lampholder switch has the risk of electrocution. The lampholder remains connected to supply even after the bulb or test cap is removed from the lampholder. Lampholder has screwed earth and main terminals to which earth and main wires can be fixed with the help of screws. One has to be very careful while screwing wires to the terminal. It is also hazardous to come in contact with the pins of this lampholder.<br>
3.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the above-described problems, it is an objective of the present invention to provide Safety and convenience while handling lampholder. Safety Screwless Pushbar Lampholder Switch comprising a shell having a pair of slots to hold switch slide<br><br>
characterized in that is a pair of springs having one end in contact with small pins and the other end in the collar pipe terminal through slide and lever assembly, hi assembled lampholder this slide and lever assembly restricts the movement of switch slide by providing enough spring force for actuation. A pair of guide holes are made on the switch slide to hold the collar pipe terminal, a pillar is made on the cover to restrict the movement of switch slide through the terminal bridges for OFF and ON position. Both ends of switch slides are shaped to stop the switch slide position, a pair of brackets with one edge angle and open are placed in the cover for fitting the wire. Insertion and deÂ¬mounting holes are provided at the bottom of insert body for fixing wire. Three legs are provided on the cover which get fixed in the three slots positioned on the body and square stopper is positioned on the cover to restrict the movement of nipple in the entry threads. A Screwless earth tag is riveted on the top of dome. This provides insertion of earth wire through hole (from inner side of dome) by passing the tag and then released for wire fixation.<br>
Safety Screwless Pushbar Lampholder Switch comprises a shell and an insert which consists of cap, tube, union ring, plunger set, contact pipes, two screwless terminals, wire clamp and a pair of slots to hold switch slide characterized in that there is a pair of springs having one end in contact with small pins and the other end in the collar pipe terminal through slide and lever assembly wherein this slide and lever assembly restricts the movement of switch slide by providing suitable spring force for actuation, a pair of guide holes are made on the switch slide to hold me collar pipe terminal, a pillar is made on the cover to restrict the movement of switch slide through the terminal bridges for OFF and ON position wherein both ends of switch slides are shaped to stop the switch slide position, a pair of brackets with one edge angle open; are placed in the cover for fitting the wire, insertion and demounting holes are also provided at the bottom of insert body for fixing wire; three legs are provided on the cover which get fixed in the three slots positioned on the body and square stopper is positioned on the cover to restrict the movement of nipple in the entry threads.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now, Safety Screwless Pushbar Lampholder Switch according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and according to the method will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the shell consists of a tube or barrel 2 which has a pair of J-out slots 1 and a collar for supporting union ring 5 which unites the cap 7 and tube or barrel 2. Cap 7 is provided with U cut slots 6 for the movement of the switch slide 9 (shown in fig.2). The cap is also provided with screwless earth terminal 8 and entry threads 15 (shown in fig.5) to fix the lamp.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the switch slide 9 will operate only when bulb or test cap is in position and automatically comes to off position once the bulb or test cap is removed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the insert consists of plunger set 10 which is provided with a pair of springs 19 are loaded with contact pipes 20 (shown in fig.7) through small slide 18 and lever 17 this actuates the switch 9.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the insert when lamp is in ON mode and a bulb 26 is the source of light to move the switch in on position.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the body 13 and the cover 11 of the insert is made from glass filled plastic to have elasticity to avoid breakage while fitting the cover onto the body manufactured by moulding machines. Springs 19 are rolled on auto mats then tempered to attain the required tension. The one end of each spring is inserted into the contact pins and the other to into the collar pipe terminals 21 which posses through the guide holes of the switch slide 9. Thereafter the body 13 is inserted into the cover 11 by inserting the legs of cover in to the slot of body. This insert is kept inside the tube such that the slot of insert is inside the dimple of the tube. The cap is put on the tube and over it union ring is tightened lastly shade ring is rotated over the tube.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the wire is put through the hole 24 and released through hole 25 in the insert. The insert is provided with wire clamp 23 having a pair of cavities to support the flex.<br>
The manufacturing is mostly done on presses. The metallic shall is prepared from the sheet coil which passes through various known operations of pressing and latter on to tapping, punching and by threading machines the shell is formed. The body and the cover of the insert is made from glass filled plastic to have elasticity to avoid breakage while fitting the cover onto the body manufactured by moulding machines. Springs are rolled on auto mats then tempered to attain the required tension. The one end of each spring is inserted into the contact pins and the other to into the collar pipe terminals which posses through the guide holes of the switch slide. Thereafter the body is inserted into the cover by inserting the legs of cover in to the slot of body. This insert is kept inside the tube such that the slot of insert is inside the dimple of the tube. The cap is put on the tube and over it union ring is tightened lastly shade ring is rotated over the tube. To wire the Safety screwless pushbar lampholder switch the wire are pushed in the holes of terminal by right hand pressure and this lampholder is fixed with the lamp to be operated, through the internal threads of the Safety screwless pushbar lampholder<br><br>
switch. The switch slide is pushed towards the right, on position, once the bulb or test cap is in position.<br>
