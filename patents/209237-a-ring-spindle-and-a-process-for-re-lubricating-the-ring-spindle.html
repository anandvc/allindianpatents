				<td>-2-BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a ring spindly and a process for re-lubricating the rind-spindle.<br>
The present invention relates to a ring spindle comprising a vertically arranged bearing housing having a closed button, also comprising a step bearing arranged in an oil-bath of the bearing bousing for a rotating shaft.<br>
In the case of such ring spindles it has been shown that the oil itself remains clear and free of impurities even after many years of use. Re-lubrication is only then necessary because too much oil has leaked out of the bearing housing. Tn the usual re-lubrication process, the shaft is removed from the bearing housing, so that oil can be filled into the bearing housing by means of an injection pistol. This is described, for example, in the Suessen-Novibra Technical Information leaflet S06/6411 D. There is always the risk that in the spinning mill, fly and trash can get into the bearing housing. In addition, it is not ensured that the shaft is re-inserted into the same bearing housing again.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to produce a ring spindle whereby oil can be refilled without the shaft being removed from the bearing housing.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that two lubricating channels having narrow cross sections are applied in the bearing housing above the desired oil level of the oil-bath.<br>
Oil can be re-filled by means of one of these lubricating channels, without the shaft having to be removed from the bearing housing, whereby the lubricating process can, if required, take place even when the ring spindle is operating. As it is not known exactly how much oil should be re-filled, as the oil level differs from ring spindle to ring spindle after a certain amount of time, at least so much oil is re-filled until oil runs out again of the other lubricating channel. This ensures that a definite amount of oil is present in the bearing housing.<br><br>
-3-<br>
ln a further step, a definite amount of oil is sucked out of the bearing housing, namely just enough so that the desired oil level is reached.<br>
The bearing housing comprises advantageously a tube which comprises the bottom, and also a bearing head inserted by means of a press fit into the tube and taking up a neck bearing, which bearing head is provided in the area of the press fit with longitudinal grooves belonging to the lubricating channels. The lower ends of the longitudinal grooves are disposed for the purpose at the desired oil level, while radial through holes of the tube are advantageously arranged to the upper end of the longitudinal grooves. These countersunk through holes can be filled out with plastic inserts, which are provided with very narrow radial oil bore holes. This prevents trash and fly from penetrating into the lubricating channels and thus from penetrating into the bearing housing.<br>
As far as it is required in further embodiments of the present invention not only to refill oil but further to wash old oil out, it can be provided that beneath the bearing head, directly adjacent thereto, an intermediary tube, preferably made of plastic, is inserted into the tube of the bearing housing, which intermediary tube is provided with a longitudinal channel extending one of the longitudinal grooves, which longitudinal channel extends to the area of the step bearing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWiNGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in conjunction with the accoMpanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal intersection through a ring spindle according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an intersection along the intersectional surface 11-11 of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a longitudinal intersection through an altered ring spindle.<br><br>
-4-<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The vertically arranged ring spindle 1 according to the present invention comprises a shaft 2 driven to rotate, which shaft 2 is supported in a neck bearing 3 in the form of a roller bearing and also in a two-part step bearing 4. The neck bearing 3 and the step bearing 4 are located in a bearing housing 5, which comprises a closed bottom 6.<br>
The bearing housing 5 consists essentially of a tube 7 comprising the bottom 6, as well as a bearing head 9 which takes up the neck bearing 3, which bearing head 9 is inserted by means of a press fit 8 into the tube 7. In the inside of the bearing housing 5, an oil-bath is located in the area of the step bearing 4, the level of which oil-bath is denoted by the reference number 10.<br>
The step bearing 4 comprises a step bearing tube 11 which takes up the radial forces, and also comprises a thrust plate which takes up the axial forces. The step bearing tube 11 is supported in a centring tube 13, which in turn is affixed in the bearing head 9 by means of a press fit 14. The centring tube 13 comprises a helical-shaped recess 15, which makes the centring tube 13 flexibly bendable to a desired degree.<br>
Between the cylindrical inner contour of the tube 7 and the cylindrical outer contour of the centring tube 13, an annular gap is located, which takes up an oil spiral 16 in a known way. The oil spiral 16 is arranged entirely in the oil-bath. By means of transverse bore holes 18 in the centring tube 13, the annular space containing the oil spiral 16 is in contact with the oil-bath of the step bearing 4. The oil spiral 16 is supported upwards by means of a distance tube 17.<br>
The ring spindle 1 is, together with a plurality of further adjacently arranged ring spindles, affixed in a known way to a spindle rail 19, denoted only by a dot-dash line. To the ring spindle 1 a drive wharve (not shown) is further arranged, whereby all drive wharves are driven by a continuous drive belt extending in machine longitudinal direction.<br>
During operation, oil is lost from the oil-bath, although the oil itself is still in perfect condition for lubricating even after a long usage time. In any case, oil must be re-filled in<br><br>
-5-<br>
the bearing housing 5 after a certain operational time. In order that, as was usual up to now, the shaft 2 does not have to be removed upwards out of the bearing housing 5, the ring spindle 1, in accordance with the present invention, is to be relubricated while the shaft 2 is located in the bearing housing 5. The ring spindle 1 may even continue to run thereby.<br>
According to the present invention, at least two lubricating channels 20 and 21 are provided in the tube 7 of the bearing housing 5 above the desired level 10 of oil of the oil-bath. These lubricating channels 20,21 each comprise longitudinal grooves 22 and 23, which are located at the outer periphery of the bearing head 9. As the bearing head 9 is inserted by means of a press fit 8 into the tube 7, closed longitudinal grooves 22,23 of the lubricating channels 20,21 occur all around.<br>
The lower end 24 of the longitudinal grooves 22,23 is located approximately at the desired oil level 10 of the oil-bath. The upper end 25 of the longitudinal grooves 22 and 23 is disposed above the spindel rail 19. There, where the longitudinal grooves 22 and 23 enter into the tube 7, the tube 7 is countersunk to such an extent that through holes 26 and 27 arise therein. These through holes 26 and 27 are filled out with plastic inserts 29 and 30, which in turn have very narrow radial cross bore holes 31 and 32. The plastic inserts 29 and 30 can be a component of a plastic ring 28 slid over the bearing housing 5.<br>
The ring spindle 1 described can be re-lubricated with oil, without the shaft 2 having to be removed from the bearing housing 5. It is not certain exactly how much oil has to be added, as the oil level varies after a certain amout of time from ring spindie 1 to ring spindle 1. Consequently, the following procedure is applied for re-lubricating:<br>
The oil is filled into the bearing housing 5 by means of a lubricating channel 20 until it runs out again by means of the other lubricating channel 21. This ensures that in any case a certain amount of oil is present in the bearing housing 5. In a further procedural step, a certain amount of oil is suctioned out of the bearing housing 5 until the desired level 10 is reached. This whole process can take place while the ring spinning machine is operational.<br><br>
-6-<br>
ln the variation according to Figure 3, a plastic intermediary tube 33 is inserted into the tube 7 below the bearing head 9 directly adjacent thereto. This intermediary tube 33 comprises a longitudinal channel 34, which extends the longitudinal groove 22 and which extends to the area of the step bearing 4. Thus during re-filling with new oil, old oil can be washed out by means of the other longitudinal groove 23.<br><br>
