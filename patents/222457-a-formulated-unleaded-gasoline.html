				<td>This invention relates to a fuel composition, in particular a gasoline composition for transportation uses e.g use in motor vehicles or aircraft.<br><br>
For many years manufacturers of spark ignition combustion engines have been striving for higher efficiency to make optimum use of hydrocarbon based fuels. But such engines require gasolines of higher octane number, which has been achieved in particular by addition of organo lead additives, and latterly with the advent of unleaded gasolines, by addition of MTBE. But combustion of any gasoline gives rise to emissions in the exhaust gases, e.g. of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and toxic hydrocarbons and such emissions are undesirable.<br><br>
Unleaded gasolines have been discovered having high Octane Number but producing low emissions on combustion<br><br>
The present invention provides an unleaded blend composition having a Motor Octane Number (MON) of at least 81 or 85 and Research Octane Number (RON) of at least 91 or 94 which comprises component (a) a total of at least 10% or 150o by volume of the blend composition of at least one branched chain hydrocarbon, which is an alkane of 8-12 carbon atoms with at least 4 methyl or ethyl branches (hereinafter called a compound (A) there being a minimum of at least 1, 2, .5 or 10% by volume (of the blend composition), of at least one individual compound (A) and component (b) at least one liquid hydrocarbon or mixture thereof of bp6O-1600C having a MON value of at least 60 preferably at least 70 and RON value of at least 70 preferably at least 80 and especially at least 90, the total amount of component (b) being at least 20% with the preferred proviso that the blend composition contains less than 5% of 223 trimethyl pentane, and<br><br><br>
especially less than I or O.S'~o, and especially less than 05%, in total of 223 trimethyl butane and 223 trimethyl pentane.<br><br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an unleaded blend composition of MON value of at least 81 or 85 and RON value of at least 9] or 94 which comprises component (a) as defined above and as component (b) at least .200o in total of one or more refinery streams, such that the blend composition contains in total at least 7Q0 o of saturated hydrocarbons.<br><br>
Unless otherwise stated all percentages in this specification are by volume, and disclosures of a number of ranges of amounts in the composition or gasoline for 2 or more ingredients includes disclosures of all sub-combinations of all the ranges with all the ingredients.<br><br>
The compounds A are alkanes of 8-12 carbon atoms (especially 8 or 10 carbons) with at least 4 methyl and/or ethyl branches, e.g. 4-6 branches, preferably 4 or 5 or especially 4 branches. Methyl branches are preferred. The compounds usually have their longest chain of carbon atoms, hereinafter called their backbone chain, with 4-7 e.g. 4-6 chain carbon atoms (especially 4 or 5) to which the methyl, and/or ethyl branches are attached. Advantageously, especially in relation to the first to tenth groupings as described further below, there are no branched groups constituting the branches other than methyl or ethyl, and, in the backbone chain of carbon atoms, there are especially no linear alkyl groups of more than 2 carbons nor 1,2 ethylene or 1,3 propylene groups in the chain, and especially no methylene groups in the chain except as part of an ethyl group; thus there are especially no n-propyl or n-butyl groups forming part of the backbone chain. Preferably there is at least one compound (A) alkane of 9-12 e.g. 9 or 10 carbons, and in this case there is usually less than 5000 or boo of an 8 carbon alkane compound e.g. with 3 methyl branches.<br><br>
The compounds can have I or 2 methyl or ethyl groups attached to the same carbon atom of the backbone chain, especially I or 2 methyl groups and 0 or 1 ethyl groups. The carbon atom in the backbone at which the branching occurs is non-terminal i.e. is an internal carbon in the backbone chain, especially the 2, 3 and/or 4 numbered carbon in the backbone. Thus advantageously the compound has geminal methyl substituents on position 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms, especially position 2, but in particular position 3.<br><br><br>
2<br><br><br>
In a first grouping of compounds A, there is at least one pair of geminal methyl branch substituents, and they are on position 2, or there are 2 or 3 pairs of geminal branches at least 2 pairs being on vicinal (ie adjacent) carbon atoms, as in a group -CMe2-CMe2-.<br><br>
In a second grouping of the compounds A there are 1, 2 or 3 pairs of geminal methyl branch substituents on a 4-6 carbon chain backbone, and, if any Ethyl CMe2-structure is present, then there are 2 Ethyl CMe2 groups in the compound The compounds of the second grou ping advantageously have a MON value of at least 100.<br><br>
In a third grouping of the compounds, there is one geminal methyl branch grouping i.e. -CMe2- on the backbone, while on one or both of the adjacent carbon atoms of the backbone, there is/are one or two methyl or ethyl branches/especially 1 or 2 methyl branches.<br><br>
In a fourth grouping of the compounds there are one, two or three pairs of geminal methyl branches. If there are 2 or 3 pairs then at least 2 pairs are on adjacent backbone carbon atoms, and if there is only one pair, then they are preferably on the 2 position backbone carbon and there is a methyl branch at least on the 3 position backbone carbon. Such compounds usually have a RON value of at least 111. Advantageously the compounds are of 8 or 10 carbon atoms.<br><br>
In a fifth grouping the compound A has 2 or 3 pairs of geminal methyl branches at least 2 pairs being on adjacent backbone carbon atoms, and the compound has a symmetrical structure. Such compounds usually have RON value of at least 120, and especially are of 8 or 10 carbon atoms.<br><br>
In a sixth grouping the compounds have a linear backbone chain of 4 or 6 carbons and have 4-6 e.g. 4, 5 or 6 especially 4 methyl branches, in at least one geminal group (CMe2) especially in the absence of a 1,2 ethyl group in the backbone.<br><br>
In a seventh grouping, the compounds have a linear backbone chain of 5 or 6 carbons and have 4-6 e.g. 4, 5 or 6 especially 4 branches in at least one geminal group, with the proviso that if there are 4 methyl branches and the compound contains an Ethyl CMe2 group, then the compound contains two such Ethyl CMe2 groups. Such compounds are usually liquid at 250C and generally have a RON value of greater than<br><br>
105.	Especially there are only methyl branches~ such compounds usually have a MON value ofat least 101.<br><br><br>
3<br><br><br>
Advantageously in an eighth grouping the compounds A contain 1, 2 or 3 carbon atoms with geminal methyl branches, and if there is only one such carbon atom with geminal branches, then there is/are one or two branches on a vicinal carbon atom to the geminal one, and any ethyl -C- chain group in the backbone chain has S carbon atoms i.e. is (Ethyl)2CH or Ethyl CMe2-. Especially there are 2 or 3 vicinal carbon atoms in the backbone, each carrying 2 methyl branches.<br><br>
A particularly preferred sub-class (ninth grouping) for the compound A is alkanes with alkyl substituents on vicinal internal carbon atoms, with a total of 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms in said substituents.<br><br>
Among this sub-class are preferred ones especially with geminal methyl groups on internal chain carbon atoms. Particularly preferred sub-class compounds A have 4 or 5 methyl substituents on the carbon backbone, especially with at least 2 on the same backbone carbon atom (in particular in two -CMe2- groups) especially in a -CMe2-CMe2 group.<br><br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided an unleaded blend composition having a MON value of at least 81 or 85 and RON value of at least 91 or 94, which comprises component (a) a total of at least 10 or 1500 of one or more branched alkane compounds A' of 8-12 carbons (especially with 4-7 or 4-6 backbone carbon atoms), with at least 4 methyl or ethyl branches and with at least 2 backbone carbon atoms which are secondary and/or tertiary carbon atoms, with the proviso that if there are only 2 such carbon atoms, then both are tertiary, there being a minimum of at least 1, 2, 5 or 1000 (by volume of the composition) of at least one individual compound A', and component (b) of nature and in amount as described herein, with the preferred proviso as described above. In the above component A', which may be the same or different from A~ there may thus in a tenth grouping be in the backbone internal (i.e. non-terminal) carbon atoms which are (i) 2 or 3 tertiary carbons, (ii) especially vicinal ones, or (iii) 2 tertiary and one sec. carbon or (iv) 2 tertiary and one or 2 primary carbon, or (iv) I or 2 tertiary and I or 2 sec subject to at least 4 branches, in particular (vi) with the tert and a sec. carbon vicinal and (vii) when there are 2 tert, these are vicinal or non-vicinal and (viii) with I or 2 vicinal tert and sec. carbons subject to at least 4 branches. The compounds A1 usually are free from 2 primary internal backbone carbon atoms on vicinal carbons ie. as in I 9~ ethylene group. Preferably any primary internal backbone carbon atoms are not between,<br><br><br>
4<br><br><br>
eg. adjacent on both sides to, a tert and/or sec, carbon on the one hand and a tert and/or sec. carbon on the other hand. Especially at least the said 2 backbone carbon atoms above in compounds A' are vicinal.<br><br>
In another category, the eleventh grouping is of compounds A' which contain ~with the proviso of at least 4 branched groups, (i) as at least one end of the backbone a group of formula CHR 'R2 where each of R' and R2, which are the same or different is a methyl or ethyl group or (ii) as at least one end of the backbone a group of formula CR'R2R3 where R' and R2 are as defined above and R3 is methyl or ethyl. Preferred are such compounds A' which have both (i) and (ii), especially when the CI-IR'R2 group is CHN4e2 when the compound has 8 carbons or a backbone of 5 carbons and when all internal carbon atoms in the backbone chain are secondary or tertiary.<br><br>
The compounds A or A' may have a boiling point at I bar pressure of 150-1 750C,<br><br>
130-1400C, 1 I0-1290C, or 90-11090C. In particular the boiling point is preferably at least<br><br>
1050C e.g. 105-1750C, with the preferred proviso that it is at least I 120C such as 112-<br><br>
1750C unless the compound A or A' has 4 alkyl branches.<br><br>
In another category the compounds A or A' may have 4-6 methyl and/or ethyl branches on a 4-7 or 4-6 carbon backbone, and especially a ratio of carbon atom in branches to carbon atoms in the backbone chain of at least 0.63:1 e.g. 0.63-1.6:1 such as 0.63-1.0:1. The compounds usually have 9 or 10 carbons, unless the above ratio is at least 0.63, 0.75 or 0.9.<br><br>
Preferred compounds are 3344 tetramethyl hexane (Al), 2233 tetramethyl butane (A2), 2233 tetramethyl pentane (A7), 22334 pentamethyl pentane (A12) 22344 pentamethyl pentane (A13) 2334 tetramethyl pentane (A14) 2234 tetramethyl pentane (AIS) 223344 hexamethyl pentane (A16) 22446 pentamethyl heptane. Of these (Al) and (A2) are most preferred with (A7) being also very valuable.<br><br>
The compounds A and A' are either known compounds and may be made according to the published literature, or are novel and may be made by conventional methods known per se in the literature (e.g. as described in Kirk Othmer Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology 3rd Ed. PubI. Wiley). Examples of suitable methods of preparation are known carbon-carbon coupling techniques for making alkanes. The technique may involve reactions of one or more usually I or 2 alkyl chlorides, bromides or iodides with an elemental metal of Group lA, hA, lB or IIB of the Periodic Table in<br><br><br>
Advanced Inorganic Chemistry by FA Cotton + G wilkinson, Pub Interscience New York 2nd Ed. 1966, especially sodium, magnesium, or zinc. The alkyl halide is usually a branched chain one of 3-6 carbons, in particular with methyl or ethyl branches, and especially with the halogen atom attached to a CMe2 group in at least one of the alkyl halides. Preferably the halide is of formula MeCMe2X or EtCMe2X, where X is Cl, B or I, and the other halide, if any, is a tertiary alkyl halide or a secondary one e.g. of formula RR'CHX, wherein at least one of R and R' is a branched alkyl group e.g. of 3-5 carbons such as isopropyl or -butyl, and the other (if any) is methyl or ethyl or a primary branched alkyl halide e.g. of formula R"CH2X, where R" is a branched alkyl group 4-5 carbons with methyl or ethyl branches, such as isobutyl or isoamyl. Alternatively both halides can be secondary e.g. of formula RR'CHX, as defined above and RIl1Rn!CI~IX where R"' is methyl or ethyl and R"~ is as defined for R, such as isopropyl or one can be secondary (as above) and one can be primary e.g. methyl or ethyl halide. The methods of coupling optimum for any particular compound A or A' depend on availability of the precursor alkyl halide(s) so that in addition to the above kinds, coupling via methyl or ethyl halides with branched alkyl halides of 6-9 carbons may also be used e.g. pentamethyl ethyl bromide and methyl magnesium bromide to form A.2. The alkyl halide(s) can react together in the presence of the metal (as in a Wurtz reaction with sodium), or one can react first with the metal to form an organometallic compound e.g. a Grignard reagent or organo zinc, followed by reaction of the organometallic with the other alkyl halide. If desired the Grignard reagent reaction can be in the presence of a metal of Group TB or IIB, such as silver, zinc or copper (especially high activity copper). If desired the Grignard reagent from one or both alkyl halides can be reacted with the latter metal to form other alkyl metallic species e.g. alkyl silver or alkyl copper compounds, which can disproportionate to the coupled alkane. The Grignard reagent(s) can also react with a cuprous halide to form alkyl copper species for disproportionation. Finally an organometallic compound, wherein the metal is of Group IA or hA e.g. Li or Mg can be coupled by reaction with a cuprous complex to give a coupled alkane. Use of only 1 alkyl halide LIves a symmetrical alkane, while use of a mixture of alkyl halides gives a mixture of alkanes, usually each of the symmetrical dimers and an unsymmetrical alkane formed from both alkyl halides<br><br>
The above organometallic reactions are usually conducted under inert conditions,<br><br><br>
6<br><br><br>
i.e.	anhydrous and in the absence of oxygen e.g. under dry nitrogen. They are usually performed in an inert solvent e.g. a dry hydrocarbon or ether. At the end of the reaction any residual organometallic material is decomposed by addition of a compound with active hydrogen e.g. water or an alcohol, and the alkanes are distilled oW either directly or after distribution between an organic and aqueous phase.<br><br>
Examples of the above processes are the coupling of tertbutyl chloride in the presence of Mg and diethyl ether to form compound A(2) (as described by D.T.Flood et al, J.Arner Chem. Soc. 56, (1934) 1211, or R.E.Marker et al, JAmer Chem. Soc. 60, (1938) 2598 or F.C.Whiteman et al, JArner Chem. Soc. 55, (1933) 380), and the corresponding coupling of EtCMe2 halides to form compound Al. Other preparations of highly branched alkanes are described in M Tamura and J.Kochi, J.Amer. Chem. Soc. Vol.93, Part 6 (March 24, 1971) and F.O.Ginah et al, J. Org. Chem. Vol. 199, 55 pp584-589 and R.Y.Levina &amp; V.K.Daukshas, Zhur.Obschei Khim. Vol. 29 (1959) and F L Howard etal, J Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Research Paper RP 1 779, Vol 38 March 1947 pp 365-395. The disclosures of these documents is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The crude alkanes made by the above processes, especially the symmetrical ones, may be used as such in the blends of the invention or may be purified further e.g. by distillation first. The crude unsymmetrical alkanes may be also purified, but are preferably used as such as the by-product alkanes are often useful hydrocarbons for the blend, e.g. coupling oft BuX and EtCMe2X as described above produces a mixture of alkanes containing Al, A.2 and A7.<br><br>
Other known methods of making the alkanes A or A', are reaction of alkyl metallic compounds e.g. Grignard reagents with carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, ~ti~fs, drarihydrides to form branched chain carbinols, which are dehydrated to the corresponding olefin, which is hydrogenated to the alkane. Thus 2,2,3,4-tetra methyl pentane may be made from isopropyl magnesium bromide and methyl t-butyl ketone (followed by dehydration and hydrogenation),<br><br>
Thus the present invention produces an unleaded blend composition of MON value at least 81 or 85 and RON value at least 91 or 94 which comprises (a) a total of at least<br><br>
10 or 15% of one or more branched hydrocarbon compound A or A there being a minimum of at least 1, 2 or 5% of at least one individual compound A or A' and (b) at<br><br>
.7<br><br><br>
least 20% of at least one different liquid hydrocarbon of bp6O-1600C having a MON value of at least 70 and RON value at least 90 especially when (b) is not within the definition of A or A'. Examples of the liquid hydrocarbons are paraffins, such as linear or branched chain alkanes of 4-2 carbons, such as isobutane, butane, isopentane, dimethyl alkanes such as 23 dimethyl butane, cycloalkanes, such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane, aromatics and olefins.<br><br>
Another unleaded blend composition of the invention of MON value of at least 81 or 85 and RON value of at least 91 or 94 comprises component (a) as above and component (b) at least 20% of at least one of a straight run naphtha, alkylate isomerate (bp2S-800C) heavy reformate, light reformate (bp2O-790C), hydrocrackate, aviation alkylate (bp3O-1900C), straight run gasoline, cracked spirit, such as heavy or light catalytic cracked spirit or steam cracked spirit. The straight run products are produced directly from crude oil by atmospheric distillation. The naphtha may be light naphtha of bp3O-900C or medium naphtha of bp9O-lSO0or heavy naphtha ofbpl50-2200C.<br><br>
In the blends of the invention, the amount of at least one individual compounds A orA' is usually at least 1,2 or SOc, or at least 10 or ~ such as 5~60Oo, e.g. 15-60%, or 8-25%, 20-35% or 30-55% or 2~10oo. The amount of 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane if present is usually at least 10% of the composition. Total amounts of trimethyl pentanes in the blend are preferable less than 69% of the blend, but advantageously at least 26% (especially when the amount of aromatics is less than 17%). If a 9 or 10 carbon alkane is (a), then the amount of 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane is especially less than 70 or SOOo. More than one such compound A or A' may be present e.g. of higher and lower RON in weight ratios of9: ito 0.5:99.5, such as 0.5:1 to 5:1 or 5:95 to 20:80, particularly for mixtures of compounds Al and A2 and/or with higher or lower boiling points (atmospheric pressure) e.g. those in which the compounds A and/or A' have boiling points differing by at least 100C e.g. at least 400C such as 10-700C or 20-500C the relative amounts being as described above. In the blends amounts of compounds A or A of RON at least 138 e.g. Al may be 1-40%, such as 2-10 or QO.-35% while those of compounds A or' of RON 120-138 e.g. A2 maybe 1-60, such as 5-60, 8-25 or 30-55% (especially when used with the higher RON compound) or I 5~500 o when used as sole compound A. Total amounts of all compounds A and A' (if any) in the blend are at least 10 or 15% such as 15-70 e.g. 15-60, 15-40 or 30-55% or 40-60% or 10-35%.<br><br><br>
8<br><br><br>
The blend may also comprise predominantly aliphatic refinery streams which are usually liquid e.g. at 200C such as naphtha, straight run gasoline (also known as light naphtha bp 25-1200C), alkylate and isomerate. Amounts in total of these maybe 10-70%, such as 10-30, 30-70 or 35~65oo. Amounts of naphtha may be 0~700o or 1~70oo such as 10-30, 30-70 or 35~650o, while amounts of light naphtha maybe 0 or 1-70 such as 1-20 or especially 30-65%, and amounts of medium naphtha may be 0 or 1-55, such as 3-20 or 15-55%. The volume ratio of light to medium naphtha may be 50.1 to 1:50, such as 0.5-20:1 or 1:0.5-50. Amounts ofalkylate or isomerate (if present) may be 0.5-20% such as 1-10%, while amounts of hydrocrackate may be 0.5~300o e.g. l0~300o. A preferred blend comprises 2O-6O0o compound A or A' and conversely 8O~4O0o straight run gasoline, the sum of these being substantially lOOoo.<br><br>
The blends of the invention usually contain in total at least 70% of saturates, such as 70-98% or 70-90% or 90-98%.<br><br>

The distribution maybe by pipeline or in tanks transported by road, rail or water, the tanks being of at least 50001 capacity. At the retail sites e.g. filling station, the motor gasoline is dispensed to a plurality of users, i.e. the drivers of the vehicles, e.g. at a rate of at least 100 or 1000 different users per day. For aviation use, the gasoline is usually made in a refinery to produce at least 1000 barrels per day (or<br><br><br>
