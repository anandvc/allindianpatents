				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement for producing a spun thread<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for producing a spun thread from in<br>
staple sliver, comprising a drafting unit comprising a delivery roller pair, also<br>
comprising an air jet aggregate arranged downstream of the drafting unit, which ar<br>
jet aggregate comprises an air evacuation channel and comprising a cleaning<br>
channel arranged to the delivery roller pair and comprising a suction opening.<br>
An arrangement of this type is known in European patent application 1 207 225- In<br>
the case of this arrangement, a staple sliver is drafted to a fibre strand, which iS<br>
imparted its spinning twist in the air jet aggregate. The fibre strand is fed first throug <br>
an entry channel of the air jet aggregate into a vortex chamber, to which is arranged<br>
a fluid device for generating a turbulent airflow around an inlet opening of a yarn<br>
withdrawal channel. The front ends of the fibres held in the fibre strand are herety<br>
first fed into the yarn withdrawal channel, while rear, free fibre ends are spread out,<br>
seized by the turbulent airflow and twisted around the bound-in front ends afreacy<br>
located in the entry opening of the yam withdrawal channel, whereby a thread with a<br>
mostly true twist is formed.<br>
An arrangement of this type permits high spinning speeds, whereby high demanc s<br>
are made above all on the drafting unit arranged upstream of the air jet aggregate, n<br>
particular, fibre fly tends to settle on the circumferential surfaces of the delivery roller<br>
pair, which rotates especially rapidly. For this reason, a suction opening of a cleanirg<br>
channel is arranged to the delivery roller pair of the known arrangement, which<br>
cleaning channel ensures that the delivery roller pair is kept clear of fibre fly, Tre<br>
above mentioned publication does not specify to which vacuum source the cleaning<br>
channel is connected, but it can be seen from the patent figures, that in the case of<br>
the air evacuation channel and the cleaning channel, different vacuum sources ae<br>
provided.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a particularly simple design for the<br>
arrangement of the above mentioned type.<br>
This object has been achieved in that the air evacuation channel and the cleaning<br>
channel are both connected to the same vacuum source.<br><br>
It has been shown that the low pressures, which on the one hand are necessary to <br>
the air evacuation channel and on the other hand for the suctioning of ths delivery<br>
roller pair, do not differ from each other to such an extent that they could not be;<br>
achieved by means of a joint vacuum source, for example, a joint blower This<br>
measure results, from the point of view of the technical design, in significant space<br>
saving in an area which is already spatially very narrow, and also to a significant<br>
simplification of the production process.<br>
in an embodiment of the present invention it is provided that the cleaning channel<br>
runs into the air evacuation channel in the interior of the air jet aggregate. Where the<br>
cleaning channel runs into the air evacuation channel, the latter can Lake tne form cf<br>
a ring channel in this area.<br>
The air jet aggregate usually comprises an entry channel which leads to the vortex<br>
chamber, to which entry channel the cleaning channel advantageously extends at<br>
least approximately parallel. This permits the vortex chamber arranged downstream<br>
of the entry channel, as well as the cleaning channel, to be connected in a simpls<br>
manner to the air evacuation channel- The suction opening of the cleaning channel<br>
can be aligned at a distance from the entry channel against a pressure roller of the<br>
delivery roller pair. Tests have shown that the pressure roller of the delivery roller pair<br>
is particularly susceptible to fibre fly. The distance mentioned above corresponds for<br>
the purpose of the present invention approximately to the radius of the pressure<br>
roller.<br>
in a further embodiment of the present invention, further suction openings can be<br>
arranged to the driven bottom rollers of the drafting unit in the areas facing away from<br>
their respective pressure rollers, which suction openings are also advantageously<br>
connected to a joint vacuum source. Thus with one single vacuum source, net only<br>
can the sir involved in the spinning process be withdrawn from the air jet aggregate,<br>
but also the entire drafting unit is kept clean.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof whan<br>
taken in conjunction with a spinning aggregate shown enlarged and schematically in<br>
intersection.<br><br>
The arrangement shown in the drawing serves the production of a spun; thread<br>
from a staple sliver 2. The arrangement comprises a drafting unit 3 as well as an air<br>
jet aggregate 4 as essential component parts.<br>
The staple sliver 2 to be spun is fed to the drafting unit 3 in deliver/ direction A and<br>
withdrawn as a spun thread 1 in withdrawal direction B and then guided further to 3<br>
winding device (not shown).<br>
The drafting unit 3, shown only in part, is preferably a three-cylinder drafting unit and<br>
comprises overall three roller pairs, each having a driven bottom roller and an upper<br>
roller in the form of a pressure roller. Downstream of a front roller pair (not shown) s<br>
a roller pair 5,6 which is provided with guiding belts 7 and 8, as well as a deliveiy<br>
roller pair 9,10. The revelant, driven bottom rollers are denoted by the numbers 5 and<br>
9, while the respective pressure rollers are denoted by the numbers 6 and 10. in a<br>
drafting unit 3 of this type, the staple sliver 2 is drafted to the desired degree of<br>
fineness in the known way. Directly downstream of the drafting unit 3, a thin fibre<br>
strand 11 is present, which is drafted, but not yet twisted.<br>
The air jet aggregate 4, arranged downstream of the drafting unit 3 at a she rt<br>
distance thereto, and which imparts the spinning twist, can, in the present invention<br>
be of any design, whereby, however, the design according to International published<br>
application 02/24993 is preferably considered, as this type of air jet aggregate<br>
permits particularly high delivery speeds.<br>
The fibre strand 11 is fed via an entry channel 12 to the air jet aggregate 4. Arranged<br>
downstream thereof is a so-called vortex chamber 13, in which the fibre strand 11 is<br>
imparted the spinning twist, so that the spun thread 1 is created, which is withdrawn<br>
through a yarn withdrawal channel 14. A fluid device generates turbulent air currerts<br>
in the vortex chamber 13 by means of blowing in compressed air through<br>
compressed air jets which run tangentially into the vortex chamber 13. The<br>
compressed air which exits out of the jet openings is guided through an evacuaton<br>
channel 15, whereby this channel 15 has a ring-shaped cross section surrounding a<br>
spindle-shaped stationary component 16, which comprises the yarn withdrawal<br>
channel 14.<br><br>
In the area of the vortex chamber 13, an edge of a fibre guiding surface is arrange:<br>
as a twist block, said edge being arranged slightly eccentrically to the yarr<br>
withdrawal channel 14 in the area of its entry opening.<br>
In the arrangement, the fibres to be spun are held on the one hand in the fibre strand<br>
11 and thus are fed from the entry Chanel 12, essentially without being imparted and<br>
twist, to the yarn withdrawal channel 14- On the other hand, the fibres in the are:)<br>
between the entry channel 12 and the yarn withdrawal channel 14 are subject to the<br>
effect of the turbulent air currents, by means of which the fibres or at least their end<br>
areas are driven radially away from the entry opening of the yarn withdrawal channel<br>
14.  The threads 1 formed by means of the above described process thus have a<br>
core of essentially in thread longitudinal direction extending fibres or fibre areas<br>
without any significant twist, as well as an outer area, in which the fibres or fibrs<br>
areas are wound around the core area.<br>
Basing the formation of the thread structure on an idealized prgcess for the purpose;<br>
of greater clarity, it can be said that the structure of the thread 4 form;; because the<br>
front running ends of the fibres, in particular those whose rear areas are still held<br>
upstream by the entry channel 12, essentially reach the yarn withdrawal channel 14<br>
directly, whereas the fibre areas following behind, in particular when they are no<br>
longer held in the entry area to the entry channel 12, are pulled out of the ftbre stran 3<br>
11 due to the rotating air current and then are twisted around the forming thread 1.<br>
In any case, fibres are bound into the forming thread 1, whereby they are pulled<br>
through the yarn withdrawal channel 14, and are simultaneously subject to the effects<br>
of the rotating current, which centrifugally accelerate the fibres, that is; from the inlet<br>
opening of the yam withdrawal channel 14 onwards, from where they are sucked in-o<br>
the air evacuation channel 15. The fibre areas pulled out of the fibre strand 11 by the<br>
circulating air currents form a fibre vortex, the so-called sun, which runs into the<br>
entry opening of the yarn withdrawal channel 14, the longer parts of which so-callec<br>
sun winding themselves spiralike around the spindle-shaped entry area of the yarr<br>
withdrawal channel 14 and this spiral being drawn against the entry opening of the<br>
yarn withdrawal channel 14 contrary to the force of the current in the air evacuation<br>
channel 15.<br>
An arrangement of this type permits particularly high spinning speeds, which lie in the<br>
range of 600 metres per minute. It is clear that the drafting unit 3 is subject to great<br>
pressures, because the delivery roller pair 9,10 must rotate very fast due to the<br><br>
required high drafting performance. This results inevitably in the delivery roller pai<br>
9,10 and in particular its pressure roller 10 being susceptible to heavy fibre fly causec<br>
by fibre loss. For this reason, a suction opening 17 of a cleaning channel 18 is<br>
arranged to the pressure roller 10 of the delivery roller 9,10.<br>
In contrast to the above described prior art, the cleaning channel 18 provided for the<br>
present invention runs into the inside of the air jet aggregate 4 ir the air evacuation<br>
channel 15, This is designed as a ring channel 20 in the running in area 19 of the<br>
cleaning channel 18, said ring channel 20 surrounding the spindle-shaped<br>
component 16.<br>
As can be seen, the cleaning channel 18 extends at least approximately parallel 13<br>
the entry channel 12 leading into the vortex chamber 13. This permits the suctioi<br>
opening 17 of the cleaning channel 18 to be aligned against the pressure roller 10 of<br>
the delivery roller pair 9,10 at a certain distance from the entry channel 12. This<br>
distance should correspond approximately to the radius of the pressure roller 10.<br>
This embodiment of the arrangement permits the air evacuation channel 15 and the<br>
cleaning channel 18 to be connected to a joint vacuum source 21, which is shown<br>
here as a suction tube, but which for the purpose of the present invention leads to a<br>
blower (not shown). Further suction openings 22 and 23 coutd be connected to this<br>
joint vacuum source 21, which openings are arranged to the driven bottom rollers 59<br>
as well as to the front bottom roller arranged upstream (not shown) in areas facirg<br>
away from the relevant pressure rollers 6, 10. Thus in a simple way, the spinning air<br>
is expelled and the drafting unit 3 is kept clean.<br><br>
An arrangement for producing a spun thread from a staple sliver comprises a drafting<br>
unit and an alt jel aggregate arranged downstream thereof. A vortex chamber with at<br>
air evacuation channel is located in the air jet aggregate. A cleaning channel s <br>
arranged to the delivery roller pair of the drafting unit, which cleaning channel s<br>
connected, together with the air evacuation channel to a joint vacuum source. The<br>
cleaning channel runs preferably into the air evacuation Channel in the inside of the<br>
air jet aggregate The cleaning channel is preferably aligned agairst the pressure<br>
roller of the delivery roller pair. Further suction openings can be additionaly<br>
arranged to the bottom rollers of the drafting unit, which suction openings are also<br>
connected to the joint vacuum source.</td>
