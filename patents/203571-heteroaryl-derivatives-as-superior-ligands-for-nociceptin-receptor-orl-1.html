The following individual compounds are especially preferred:<br><br>
A preferred indication for compounds of formula I is for the treatment of cough.<br>
As used herein, the following terms are used as defined below unless otherwise indicated:<br>
halo represents fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo; heteroaryl represents cyclic aromatic groups of 5 or 6 atoms or bicyclic groups of 9 to 10 atoms having 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms independently selected from O, S or N, said heteroatom(s) interrupting a carbocyclic ring structure and having a sufficient number of delocalized pi electrons to provide aromatic character, provided that the rings do not contain adjacent oxygen and/or sulfur atoms.  Nitrogen atoms can form an N-oxide. All regioisomers are contemplated, e.g., 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyf and 4-pyridyl. Typical 6-membered heteroaryl groups are pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl,<br><br>
pyndazinyl and the N-oxides thereof,  iypical 5-membered heteroaryl rings are furyl, thieny!, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazoiyl and isoxazolyl. Bicyclic groups typically are benzo-fused ring systems derived from the heteroaryl groups named above, e.g. quinolyl, phthalazinyi, quinazolinyi, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl and indolyl. The heteroaryl ring can be substituted with 1-4 R4 groups, wherein any of the available substitutable carbon or nitrogen atoms in said heteroaryl group may be optionally and independently substituted.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention may exist in different stereoisomers forms (e.g., enantiomers, diastereoisomers and atropisomers). The invention contemplates all such stereoisomers both in pure form and in mixture, including racemic mixtures.<br>
Certain compounds will be acidic in nature, e.g. those compounds which possess a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxy! group. These compounds may form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts. Examples of such salts may include sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also contemplated are salts formed with pharmaceutical^ acceptable amines such as ammonia, aikyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
Certain basic compounds also form pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acid, while compounds having basic substituents such as amino groups also form salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
All such acid and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutical^/ acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered<br><br>
equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be prepared by known methods from starting materials either known in the art or prepared by methods known in the art.<br>

Codeine and other opioids used as cough suppressants are known to activate the mu-opioid receptor, causing side effects such as respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and physical dependency. ORL-1 receptor agonists do not activate the mu-opioid receptor, and therefore are expected to result in a superior safety profile compared to opioids.<br>
The ORL-1 receptor agonist activity of compounds of formula I, and their effect on cough and respiration can be measured by the following tests. Nociceptin binding assay<br>
CHO cell membrane preparation expressing the ORL-1 receptor (2 mg) was incubated with varying concentrations of [125 l][Tyr14]nociceptin (3-500 pM) in a buffer<br><br>
containing 50 mM HEPES (pH7.4), 10 mM NaCI, 1mM MgCI2, 2.5 mM CaCI2j 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.025% bacitracin. In a number of studies, assays were carried out in buffer 50 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.025% bacitracin. Samples were incubated for 1h at room temperature (22°C). Radiolabeled ligand bound to the membrane was harvested over GF/B filters presoaked in 0.1% polyethyieneimine using a Brandell cell harvester and washed five times with 5 mi cold distilled water. Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel by similar assays performed in the presence of 1 uM nociceptin. All assay points were performed in duplicates of total and non-specific binding.<br>
Calculations of Ki were made using methods well known in the art.<br>
For compounds of this invention, Ki values were determined to be in the range of 0.6 to 30 nM, with compounds having a Ki value less than 10 nM being preferred. Ki values for several exemplified compounds are shown in the following table:<br><br>
Using the procedures described the European Journal of Pharmacology, 336 (1997), p. 233-242, the agonist activity of compounds of the invention was determined. The agonist activity (EC^) of these compounds was measured to be in the range of 20-200 nM. Cough Studies<br>
The effects of a nociceptin agonist are evaluated in capsaicin-induced cough in the guinea pig according to the methods of Bolser et al. British Journal of Pharmacology (1995) 114, 735-738 (also see McLeod et al, British Journal of Pharmacology (2001) 132,1175-1178). This model is a widely used method to evaluate the activity of potential antitussive drugs. Overnight fasted male Hartley guinea pigs (350-450 g, Charles River, Bloomington, MA, USA) were placed in a 12" x 14" transparent chamber. The animals were exposed to aerosolized capsaicin (300 pM, for 4 min)<br><br>
produced by a jet nebulizer (Puritan Bennett, Lenexa, KS, USA) to elicit the cough reflex. Each guinea pig was exposed only once to capsaicin. The number of coughs were detected by a microphone placed in the chamber and verified by a trained observer. The signal from the microphone was relayed to a polygraph which provided a record of the number of coughs. Either vehicle (methylcellulose 1 ml/kg, p.o.) or test compound were given 2 hours before aerosolized capsaicin. The antitussive activity of baclofen (3 mg/kg, p.o.) was also tested as a positive control. Respiratory Measurements<br>
Studies were performed on male Hartley guinea pigs ranging in weight from 450 to 550 g. The animals were fasted overnight but given water and libitum. The guinea pigs were placed in a whole-body, head-out plethysmograph and a rubber collar was placed over the animal's head to provide an airtight seal between the guinea pig and the plethysmograph. Airflow was measured as a differential pressure across a wire mesh screen which covered a 1 -in hole in the wall of the plethysmograph. The airflow signal was integrated to a signal proportional to volume using a preamplifier circuit and a pulmonary function computer (Buxco Electronics, Sharon, CT., model XA). A head chamber was attached to the plethysmograph and air from a compressed gas source (21%C&gt;2, balance N2) was circulated through the head chamber for the duration of study. All respiratory measurements were made while the guinea pigs breathed this circulating air.<br>
The volume signal from each animal was fed into a data acquisition/analysis system (Buxco Electronics, model XA) that calculated tidal volume and respiratory rate on a breath-by-breath basis. These signals were visually displayed on a monitor. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were recorded as an average value every minute.<br>
The guinea pigs were allowed to equilibrate in the plethysmograph for 30 min. Baseline measurements were obtained at the end of this 30 min period. The guinea pigs were then removed from the plethysmograph and orally dosed with test compound (10 mg/kg, p.o.), baclofen (3 mg/kg, p.o.) or a methylcellulose vehicle placebo (2 ml/kg, p.o.). Immediately after dosing, the guinea pigs were placed into the plethysmography the head chamber and circulating air were reconnected and respiratory variables (tidal volume (Vj), respiratory rate (f) and minute volume (MV = VT X f)) were measured at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post treatment.

The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably a compound of this invention is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br><br>
The quantity of active compound of formula I in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg. to 300 mg, according to the particular application.<br>
The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen is oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses to provide relief from pain, anxiety, depression, asthma or alcohol abuse. The compounds are non-toxic when administered within this dosage range.<br>
When the nociceptin receptor ORL-1 agonist of formula I is administered in combination with one or more additional agents, the compound of formula I and the additional agent(s) are preferably administered in a combined dosage form (e.g., a single tablet), although they can be administered separately. The additional agents are administered in amounts effective to provide relief from cough, allergy or asthma symptoms, preferably from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to 300 mg per unit dose. A typical recommended dosage regimen of the additional agent is from 1 mg to 2000 mg/day, preferably 1 to 1000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses. Typical dosage amounts of the other agents may be determined from the literature, for example in The Physicians's Desk Reference.<br>
The following are examples of pharmaceutical dosage forms which contain a compound of the invention.
