				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pilot burner ignition apparatus for use in combustion chambers.<br>
Such an apparatus provides a continuous pilot flame in the combustion chamber leading to initial startup and protection against flame failure of main burner.<br>
Various designs of pilot burner ignition apparatus or systems are known to the prior art for use in combustion chambers. Most of the known prior art system have disadvantages.<br>
The prior art pilot burner fgnition apparatus or systems are less reliable and have fallen short of required standards as follows:<br>
1.	FAILURE OF ELECTRODE:<br>
Short circuiting of the electrode is found to be a common phenomenon due to e.g. deposition of dirt, soot and overflow of burning fuel, leading to failure of electrical insulation. Most of the existing devices employ electrode insulation made of small pieces of male/female insulation sleeves. While in operation any ingress of moisture reduces electrical insulation strength thereby causing failure of the electrode. Repair/replacement of the insulation sleeves is a costly affair and entails interruption in production.<br>
2.	IMPROPER ATOMIZATION:<br>
Flame failure occurs due to improper mixing by the fuel/air mixer.<br>
3.	HIGH-VOLTAGE IGNITION TRANSFORMER:<br>
Failure of High Voltage Transformer takes place due to failure of electrode insulation as well as faulty operation.    It is a general<br>
practice to have the high voltage transformer kept at a safe distance from the combustion chamber and the igniter is connected by means of a high voltage electric cable. Frequent failures are observed in the high voltage cable and replacement thereof is a costly affair.<br>
All these defects in prior art pilot burner ignition apparatus or devices are sought to be overcome by the present invention. In other words, the pilot burner ignition apparatus of the present invention is provided with constructional features which overcomes the disadvantages listed above.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide: A specifically designed mixing chamber which achieves far better atomization and mixing of the fuel and air and which provides smooth flow of the fuel air mixture through the chamber;<br>
2.	A cartridge type maintenance free electrode made specially for the<br>
present construction;<br>
3.	An insulation which can withstand a high temperature and has a<br>
high strength is provided for the electrode enabling it to take<br>
temperatures of up to 1700Â°C. The insulation enables avoidance of<br>
short circuiting, resulting in high reliability;<br>
4.	An  electronic design has been developed for the high voltage<br>
transformer which makes it short circuit protected, enables   it to<br>
have a low weight, and higher reliability.  The system can be used<br>
continuously and the electronic circuit of the transformer provides<br>
a high density current impulse to the induction coil and this in<br>
turn generates high voltage and high energy spark. 5.       The high voltage transformer is attached to the ignitor.   By this<br>
construction, no external high voltage electric cable is required. All<br>
high voltage parts including cable and transformer are totally<br>
enclosed and attached to the igniter.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be clear that the objects of the invention are achieved by the several novel features of the pilot burner ignition apparatus for use in combustion chambers and will enable trouble-free operation with high reliability.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pilot burner ignition apparatus for use in combustion chambers, the apparatus comprising an igniter consisting of co-axially mounted tubes with a central tube mounting an electrode coaxially therein, intermediate channels between coaxial outer tubes providing separate passages for fuel and air to a mixing chamber adjacent the electrode tip, said mixing chamber provided by a nozzle tip mounted on the end of the tubes at which the air and fuel meet at said electrode tip to produce a flame, said coaxial tubes being connected at an end opposite to said nozzle tip to a mounting flange and a housing containing a high voltage transformer, said concentric passageways for air and fuel being each connected to separate connecting means for air and fuel, said central tube containing the electrode being connected by concealed terminals to said high voltage<br>
transformer provided in said housing, a low tension electrical connecting<br>
means welded to said housing for connection of an electrical source to said high tension transformer, said coaxial tubes of said igniter being connectible to a combustion chamber wall so that the nozzle tip end thereof is inserted through said combustion chamber wall for providing a pilot flame to a main burner of said combustion chamber.<br>
The basic apparatus of the invention has three co-axial tubes welded to a common mounting flange. With the provision of concentric tubes separate channels for flow of fuel gas and air to the mixing chamber is facilitated. The central tube serves as the mount for the insulated electrode. To facilitate easy replacement of the electrode cartridge, the central tube is provided with threads at both ends.<br>
The terminal of the electrode with its high tension cable is concealed within a teflon bush in turn held in position with the help of a threaded metallic bush holder.<br>
The high voltage transformer is mounted inside a metallic housing. The housing is fixed with the bottom of the igniter by a pair of flanges. A flame proof low tension connection lug is welded to the body of the housing to provide electric supply.<br>
The mixing chamber is welded to the second and third outer tubes. A removable threaded flame tube is provided at the front end of the igniter.<br>
The electrode assembly consists of outer metallic tube with co-axial and concentric continuous ceramic sleeve. The electrode is passed<br>
through the ceramic sleeve. The electrode, ceramic sleeve and the outer metallic tube are cemented with refractory cement.<br>
