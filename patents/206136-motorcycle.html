THE  PATENTS  ACT,   1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, JAPAN,<br>
V<br>
12 APR 2006<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Among motorcycles, there exists a scooter type motorcycle in which a helmet accommodating box is arranged at a rear portion of a body. As this type of motorcycle, for example, "a motorcycle" disclosed in JP-A No. 88382/1990 (hereinafter referred to as "prior art") has been known.<br>
[0002]<br>
In the above-mentioned prior art, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 of the Publication, a pair of right and left rear frames 7e, 7e which are extended in the frontward and rearward direction over a rear wheel 3 are provided to the rear portion of the body frame 7 (numerals described in the publication being quoted hereinafter) , a second cross pipe 7g is extended between these rear frames 7e, 7e, and a helmet accommodating box 21 is arranged at a rear half portion of the body frame 7.<br>
The helmet accommodating box 21 is formed of an elongated box capable of accommodating a pair of front and rear helmets HI, H2. At a longitudinal center of a bottom wall 21a of the helmet accommodating box 21, a recessed portion in which a second cross pipe 7g extends is provided. There is no possibility that the helmets HI, H2 interfere with the second cross pipe 7g.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a motorcycle having a pair of right and left rear frames (52) which are extended in the frontward and rearward direction above a rear wheel (18), in which a cross member (56) is stretched between right and left rear frames (52) and a helmet accommodating box (21) is disposed between the right and left rear frames (52),<br>
characterized in that the cross member (56) is formed of a member having a curved shape substantially along a profile of a helmet (HF) accommodated in the helmet accommodating box (52), wherein by making use of spaces (SP) formed at positions where the curved cross member (56) is connected to the rear frames (52), brackets (58) to which an upper portion of the rear cushion unit (19) is connected are mounted on the cross member (56).<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Here, the position of the helmet accommodating box 21 is determined in view of a total design of the motorcycle 1 and the arrangement of the helmet accommodating box 21 is not limited<br>
3<br><br>
to a position above an upward-and-downward swing type engine unit 5. For example, the entire helmet accommodating box 21 is arranged right above a rear wheel 3.<br>
On the other hand, a second cross pipe 7g constitutes a portion of a reinforcing member of the body frame 7 and is provided at a position which is necessary to ensure the rigidity of the body frame 7 .  For example, a cushion damper 12 is provided in the vicinity of the rear wheel 3 .  A rear portion of an engine unit 5 which rotatably mounts the rear wheel 3 thereon is suspended from the rear frames 7e, 7e by means of the cushion damper 12.  In these rear frames 7e, 7e, portions thereof on which the upper portion of the cushion damper 12 is mounted are required to have their torsional rigidity and bending rigidity increased.  Accordingly, it is one of effective means to make the second cross pipe 7g stretched between the rear frames 7e, 7e. [0005]<br>
However, depending on the arrangement of the helmet accommodating box 21, there is a possibility that the second cross pipe 7g interferes with the helmet HI or the helmet H2 accommodated in the helmet accommodating box 21. Under such a circumstance, it is difficult to connect the second cross pipe 7g at suitable positions of the rear frames 7e, 7e.<br>
Here, following three methods are considered to prevent the second cross pipe 7g from interfering with the helmet HI or the helmet H2.<br>
In a first method, the position of the second cross pipe 7g is changed in the frontward direction or in the rearward<br>
4<br><br>
direction.  However, the changed position is not a suitable position to enhance the rigidity of the body frame 7.  To complement the rigidity makes the structure of the body frame complicated and hence, it is not advisable.  Further, when the connecting positions of the second cross pipe 7g are shifted in the backward direction, the body becomes elongated.<br>
In a second method, the rear frames 7e, 7e are lowered. However, to ensure the performance of the cushion damper 12, it is desirable to maintain a stroke of the cushion damper 12. Accordingly, it is impossible to lower the rear frames 7e, 7e.<br>
In a third method, the helmet accommodating box 21 is elevated.  However, in this case, a seat 6 which is arranged on the helmet accommodating box 21 must be elevated.  The idea to simply lower or elevate the seat 6 cannot be adopted in view of the foot-landing performance.<br>
In this manner, whatever method is adopted, to arrange both of the second cross pipe 7g and the helmet accommodating box 21 at suitable positions, there is the room for improvement. [0007]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a technique which can make a cross member stretched between right and left rear frames at a suitable position without making the cross member interfere with helmets which are accommodated in a helmet accommodating box. [0008] [Means to Solving the Problem]<br>
Inventors of the present invention have focused on a fact that when a helmet accommodated in a helmet accommodating box<br>
5<br><br>
is viewed from above, a periphery of the helmet exhibits a curved shape and have found that the problem can be solved by skillfully making use of this curved shape.<br>
According to claim 1, a motorcycle has a pair of right and left rear frames which are extended in the frontward and rearward direction above a rear wheel. A cross member is stretched between the right and left rear frames and a helmet accommodating box is disposed between the right and left rear frames. In such a constitution, the cross member is formed of a member having a curved shape substantially along a profile of a helmet accommodated in the helmet accommodating box when viewed from above. [0009]<br>
The cross member has a center portion curved substantially along the profile of the helmet accommodated in the helmet accommodating box.  The both end portions are extended to suitable positions between the right and left rear frames and are connected to these frames there.  In this manner, by stretching the curved cross member between the right and left rear frames, the rigidity of the right and left rear frames is be enhanced.  Further, the cross member is prevented from interfering with the helmets accommodated in the helmet accommodating box. [0010]<br>
According to claim 2, a motorcycle which mounts a rear fork on a body side so that the rear fork is swingable in the upward and downward direction, rotatably mounts a rear wheel on a rear portion of the rear fork and suspends the rear portion<br>
6<br><br>
of the rear fork from the body side by way of a rear cushion unit. By making use of spaces formed at positions where the curved cross member is connected to the rear frames, brackets to which an upper portion of the rear cushion unit is connected are mounted on the cross member. [0011]<br>
By mounting the brackets on the cross member by making use of marginal spaces defined at portions of the body frame where the curved cross member is mounted to the rear frames, the upper portion of the rear cushion unit can be mounted on these brackets. Accordingly, a sufficient mounting space can be ensured at the upper portion of the rear cushion unit.<br>
7<br><br>

The power transmission mechanism 17 is connected to a crank case 16a of the engine 16 so that the power transmission mechanism 17 is swingable in the upward and downward direction and the rear wheel 18 is rotatably mounted on a rear portion of the power transmission mechanism 17 and hence, the power transmission mechanism 17 plays the role of a rear fork (swing arm) 25.  Further, the power transmission mechanism 17 is provided with a bracket 17a which connects a lower portion of the rear cushion unit 19 to the rear end of the power transmission mechanism 17.<br>
In brief, the motorcycle 10 may be referred to as a motorcycle which is constituted so that the rear fork 25 (that is, the power transmission mechanism 17) is mounted on the engine 16 which constitutes the body side so that the rear fork 25 is swingable in the upward and downward direction, the rear wheel 18 is rotatably mounted on the rear portion of the rear fork 25, and the rear portion of the rear fork 25 is suspended from the rear frame 52 which constitutes the body side by way of the right and left rear cushion units 19, 19 (only the left rear cushion unit 19 shown in the drawing) . This drawing shows that the rear frame 52 is extended in the frontward and rearward direction above the rear wheel 18.<br><br>
																														13<br><br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 3 is a plan view of the rear portion of the body frame according to the present invention. In the drawing, a pair of right and left rear frames 52, 52 are provided at the rear portion of the body frame 11 and a cross member 56 is stretched between these right and left rear frames 52, 52.<br>
When the body frame 11 is viewed from above, a front-side helmet Hf and a rear-side helmet Hr which are accommodated in the accommodating box 21 (see Fig. 1) are located at positions indicated by an imaginary line. Further, the peripheries of the front and rear helmets Hf, Hr which are accommodated in the accommodating box 21 exhibit curved shapes when viewed from above. [0020]<br>
On the other hand, the cross member 56 passes between the front side helmet Hf and the rear-side helmet Hr, and hence, the curved shapes of these helmets Hf, Hr are utilized. That is, when the cross member 56 is viewed from above, the cross member 56 is formed of a pipe member having a curved shape substantially along a profile of the front-side helmet Hf. Specifically, the cross member 56 is formed of an approximately U-shaped or V-shaped member in a plan view which is curved so that a body center CL portion thereof is bulged in the rearward direction.<br>
In the body frame 11 having such a constitution, the right and left spaces Sp, Sp are formed at portions 57, 57 where the curved cross member 56 is connected to the rear frames 52, 52. Specifically, since the cross member 56 is curved so that the<br><br>
																												14<br><br>
cross member 56 is bulged in the rearward direction, when both end portions 56a, 56a of the cross member 56 are connected (joined by welding or the like) to the rear frames 52, 52, the spaces Sp, Sp which have acute angles in the frontward direction in a plan view are formed behind the connecting portions 57, 57 .  To explain in more detail, when the body frame 11 is viewed from above, approximately triangular spaces Sp, Sp which are surrounded by the right and left rear frames 52, 52, the right and left end portions 56a, 56a of the cross member 56 and a tangent line Ta which comes into contact with a rear end 56b of the cross member 56 and intersects the body center CL (body center line CL) at a right angle are formed at the right and left sides. [0022]<br>
The present invention is characterized by providing brackets 58, 58 by effectively making use of right and left spaces Sp, Sp.  Upper portions 19a, 19a of the right and left rear cushion units 19, 19 (see Fig. 2) can be connected to these right and left brackets 58, 58.<br>
Specifically, at the inside of the right and left spaces Sp, Sp, brackets 58, 58 are joined to the end portions 56a, 56a of the cross member 56 and further the rear frames 52, 52, the cross member 56 and the brackets 58, 58 are joined by means of gazettes 59, 59. [0023]<br>
Fig. 4 is a plan view of the body frame and the helmet accommodating box according to the present invention and shows the state in which the accommodating box 21 is mounted on the body frame 11.<br><br>
           																		15<br><br>
The accommodating box 21 is an upper-end open type box which is integrally formed of a front accommodating portion 61 which accommodates the front-side helmet Hf, a rear accommodating portion 62 which accommodates the rear side helmet Hr (see Fig. 3) , a center cover portion 63 which covers an upper portion of the cross member 56, and end cover portions 64, 64 which cover upper portions of the right and left brackets 58, 58 and the upper portions 19a, 19a of the right and left rear cushion units 19, 19. [0024]<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross - sectional view of a rear cushion unit mounting portion of the body frame according to the present invention as viewed from the left side.<br>
This drawing shows the constitution in which the bracket 58 which is joined to the end portion 56a of the cross member 56 is extended upwardly in the rearward direction, the upper portion 19a of the rear cushion unit 19 is connected to the rear end portion of the bracket 58, and the end cover portion 64 covers the upper portion of the bracket 58 and the upper portion 19a of the rear cushion unit 19. [0025]<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of the helmet accommodating box according to the present invention as viewed from the left side.<br>
The length of the accommodating box 21 in the frontward and rearward direction is set substantially equal to the outer diameter of the rear wheel 18 and is set slightly longer than the rear portion seat of the seat 22.  Such an accommodating<br>
16<br><br>
box 21 is arranged at a position where the accommodating box 21 falls within a range from a front end to a rear end of the rear wheel 18 when the motorcycle 10 is viewed from the side.<br>
A bottom plate 65 of the accommodating box 21 has a shape which is curved substantially along a profile of the rear wheel 18. Specifically, the bottom plate 65 is constituted of a center cover portion 63 which is located at the longitudinal center position, a front downwardly inclining surface 66 which is disposed in front of the center cover portion 63, and a rear downwardly inclining surface 67 which is disposed behind the center cover portion 63 which substantially forms a letter "L" as viewed from the side. The helmets Hf, Hr are respectively placed on these front downwardly inclining surface 66 and rear downwardly inclining surface 67. [0026]<br>
Fig. 7 (a), (b) are operational views of the motorcycle according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 7 (a) is a plan view of a comparison example around the rear frames 52, 52. As shown in the drawing, between the front and rear helmets Hf, Hr which are accommodated in the accommodating box, a straight cross member 56X in a plan view passes and this cross member 56X is stretched between positions PI, PI of the rear frames 52, 52.<br>
The positions PI, PI at which the cross member 56 is connected are shifted or displaced in the rearward direction from positions P2, P2 which are suitable for enhancing the rigidity of the rear frames 52, 52.  Since it is necessary to provide reinforcing members to enhance the rigidity by an amount<br>
17<br><br>
corresponding to such a displacement, the structure of the body frame 11 becomes complicated.<br>
[0027]<br>
Further, according to Fig. 7 (a), the distance from the center of the front-side helmet Hf to the rear end of the bracket 58 is LI and hence is relatively large. Spaces formed between portions where the cross member 56X is mounted to the rear frames 52, 52 and the rear-side helmet Hr accommodated in the accommodating box are narrow. Since the spaces are narrow, it is necessary to consider so that the brackets 58, 58 and the upper portions of the rear cushion units 19, 19 do not interfere with the rear side helmet Hr.<br>
[0028]<br>
Fig. 7 (b) is a plan view of the constitution of the present invention around the rear frames 52 , 52 .  As shown in the drawing, the cross member 56 having the shape which is curved substantially along the profile of the front-side helmet Hf passes between the front and rear helmet Hf, Hr which are accommodated in the accommodating box, and this cross member 56 is stretched between the rear frames 52, 52.<br>
[0029]<br>
Since the center portion of the cross member 56 is substantially curved along the profile of the front-side helmet Hf which is accommodated in the accommodating box, both end portions 56a, 56a of the cross member 56 can be extended to the more appropriate positions P2, P2 between the right and left rear frames 52, 52 and can be connected there.  Then, by stretching the curved cross member 56 between the right and left<br><br>
																																	18<br><br>
rear frames 52 , 52, the rigidity of the right and left rear frames 52, 52 can be enhanced.  In this manner, since the cross member 56 is stretched between the optimum positions P2, P2 for enhancing the rigidity of the body frame 11, the constitution of the body frame 11 can be simplified.  Further, there is no possibility that the cross member 56 interferes with the front and rear helmets Hf, Hr which are accommodated in the accommodating box.  Still further, since it is unnecessary to change the connecting positions of the cross member 56 in the rearward direction, it is possible to maintain the short body (body frame 11). [0030]<br>
Further, Fig. 7 (b) also shows that by effectively making use of the spaces (marginal spaces) Sp, Sp formed at the portions where the cross member 56 is mounted to the rear frames 52, 52, the brackets 58, 58 are mounted on the cross member 56 and the upper portions of the rear cushion units 19, 19 are mounted on these brackets 58, 58.<br>
According to Fig. 7 (b) , the distance from the center of the front side helmet Hf to the rear end of the bracket 58 is L2 and this L2 is shorter than the above-mentioned distance LI. Due to such a constitution, it is possible to accommodate the brackets 58, 58 and the upper portions of the rear cushion units 19, 19 at the inside of the spaces Sp, Sp. Accordingly, the mounting spaces for the upper portions of the rear cushion units 19, 19 can be sufficiently ensured. Further, there is no possibility that the brackets 58, 58 and the upper portions of the rear cushion units 19, 19 interfere with the helmets Hf,<br>
19<br><br>
Hr which are accommodated in the accommodating box. [0031]<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiments of the present inventions, the motorcycle 10 is not limited to a scooter type motorcycle.<br>
Further, the rear cushion unit 19 is not limited to a pair of right and left units and a single unit may be used.<br>
Still further, the curving direction and the curved shape of the cross member 56 are not limited to those shown in the above-mentioned Fig. 3. For example, when the cross member 56 is viewed from above, the cross member 56 may have a shape which is curved along substantially a profile of the rear side helmet Hr. In this case, the spaces Sp, Sp are formed in front of the portions 57, 57 where the cross member 56 is connected to the rear frames 52, 52. The brackets 58, 58 are mounted by making use of these spaces Sp, Sp. [0032] [Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention achieves following advantageous effects due to the above-mentioned constitution.<br>
According to claim 1, since the center portion of the cross member is substantially curved along the profile of the helmet accommodated in the helmet accommodating box, both end portions of the cross member can be extended to the more appropriate positions between the right and left rear frames and can be connected there. By stretching the curved cross member between the right and left rear frames, the rigidity of the right and left rear frames can be enhanced.  Since the cross member is<br><br>
																														20<br><br>
stretched between the appropriate positions for enhancing the rigidity of the body frame, the constitution of the body frame can be simplified. Further, there is no possibility that the cross member interfere with the helmets which are accommodated in the helmet accommodating box. Still further, since it is unnecessary to change the connecting positions of the cross member in the rearward direction, it is possible to maintain the short body. [0033]<br>
According to claim 2, in the body frame, the brackets are mounted to the cross member making use of the marginal spaces formed at the portions where the curved cross member is mounted to the rear frames and the upper portions of the rear cushion units are mounted on these brackets. The mounting spaces for the upper portions of the rear cushion units can be sufficiently ensured. Further, there is no possibility that the helmets accommodated in the helmet accommodating box interfere with the brackets and the upper portions of the rear cushion units.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A motorcycle having a pair of right and left rear frames (52)<br>
which are extended in the frontward and rearward direction above a rear<br>
wheel (18), in which a cross member (56) is stretched between right and<br>
left rear frames (52) and a helmet accommodating box (21) is disposed<br>
between the right and left rear frames (52),<br>
characterized in that the cross member (56) is formed of a member having a curved shape substantially along a profile of a helmet (HF) accommodated in the helmet accommodating box (52), wherein by making use of spaces (SP) formed at positions where the curved cross member (56) is connected to the rear frames (52), brackets (58) to which an upper portion of the rear cushion unit (19) is connected are mounted on the cross member (56).<br>
2.	A motorcycle as claimed in claim 1, wherein the motorcycle<br>
mounts a rear fork (25) on a body side so that the rear fork (25) is<br>
swingable in the upward and downward direction, rotatably mounts a<br>
rear wheel (18) on a rear portion of the rear fork (25), and suspends the<br>
rear portion of the rear fork (25) from the body side by way of a rear<br>
cushion unit (19).</td>
