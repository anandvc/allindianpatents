				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE ZEOLITE<br>
BETA<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
nanocrystalline zeolite beta. More particularly, this invention relates to the preparation<br>
of nanocrystalline zeolite beta by a modified aerogel protocol comprising four steps,<br>
namely, hydrolysis, nucleation, crystallization and supercritcal drying. This improved<br>
process gives excellent yields of nanocrystalline zeolite beta with a crystallite size in<br>
the range of 10 to 80 nanometers and a broad range of silica to alumina ratio 15 to 200<br>
which shows enhanced activity for nitration of o-xylene to produce 4-nitro o-xylene<br>
with higher selectivity.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Research has been focused recently on the development of new methods for<br>
preparation of zeolites to obtain nanometer size of zeolite crystals. This may be<br>
achieved by decreasing the nucleation temperatures, lowering the crystallization<br>
times, optimized pH conditions and also in absence of alkali metal cations during the<br>
synthesis of zeolites. Zeolite beta, having a three-dimensional large-pore system of a<br>
12-membered ring opening 0.76 nm wide, first described in 1967 in an U.S. Patent,<br>
draws much attention because of its unique characteristics, in particular its acidity and<br>
potential for acid catalysis. The nanocrystalline zeolite beta offers several advantages<br>
over microcrystalline zeolite beta in terms of activity and selectivity due to increased<br>
active acidic sites and three dimensional interface with the support and reactant.<br>
Reference is made to U.S. Patent 3,308,069, wherein zeolite beta was<br>
described for the first time with a silica-to-alumina ratio from 10 to 150 with crystal<br>
size ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 microns in presence of alkali metal cations. The<br>
drawbacks are longer crystallization times and also the presence of alkali metal<br>
cations makes the zeolite beta inactive acidic catalyst. Reference is also made to<br>
Joaquin Perez -Pariente et al, Applied Catalysis, 31,1987,35 - 64 wherein zeolite beta<br>
was synthesized from tetraethylorthosilicate, sodium aluminate, tetraethylammonium<br>
hydroxide, sodium and potassium hydroxide. They studied the influence of alkali<br>
metal cations on the crystallization mechanism. The drawbacks are the presence of<br>
alkali metal cations in the synthetic mixture needs longer post-calcination treatment<br>
and zeolite prepared is not an acidic catalyst. Larger crystallites form due to longer<br>
crystallization times and separation of zeolite crystals require higher centrifugal<br>
forces.<br>
Reference is made to Camblor et al, Zeolites, 1991, 202 and 792, wherein<br>
zeolite beta was synthesized in 30 hours at 135°C using amorphous silica, a 40%<br>
aqueous solution of tetraethylammonium hydroxide, sodium aluminate, aluminum,<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and suggested that the presence of alkali<br>
metal cations is essential for the formation of the zeolite. The disadvantages are the<br>
presence of alkali metal cations in the synthetic mixture, formation of larger<br>
crystallites and further separation of zeolite crystals requires higher centrifugal forces.<br>
Reference is also made to U.S. Patent 5,427,765 wherein zeolite beta is synthesized<br>
from a mixture of tetraethylammonium hydroxide, an alkali metal silicate and an<br>
aqueous solution containing aluminum. The disadvantages is the presence of alkali<br>
metal cations in the synthesis mixture and longer crystallization times required even<br>
to form larger crystallites.<br>
Reference is made to U.S. Patent 4,923,690 wherein synthesis of highly<br>
silicious zeolite beta was described with silica-to-alumina ratio within the range of 20-<br>
1000. The drawbacks are to achieve the high silica to alumina ratio, the zeolite has to<br>
be partially crystallized. As the zeolite becomes more crystalline, the silica-to-alumina<br>
ratio decreases. In this procedure highly silicious zeolite beta was obtained with only<br>
30 to 50% crystallinity. Reference is made to U.S. Patent 5,989,518 wherein a<br>
continuous process was developed to synthesize various molecular sieves, which<br>
control both the particle size and particle size distribution. This process involves<br>
continuously adding reactive sources of the desired components along with a<br>
structure-directing agent into a continuous crystallization reactor. Either interstage<br>
backmixing is introduced or the number of stages is adjusted in order to control<br>
particle size. The disadvantages are the presence of alkali metal cations and the<br>
crystallites obtained are in the range of 3 to 20 microns. Reference is also made to<br>
U.S. Patent 5,683,673 wherein zeolite beta is synthesized in presence of ethanol.<br>
Ethene is evolved during crystallization period for which the pressure developed<br>
autogeneously to 50 bar at the end of crystallization. The drawbacks are the longer<br>
crystallization times 11 days at 140°C, and separation of zeolite crystals from mother<br>
liquor requires higher centrifugation forces of 13,000 rpm. Reference is made to<br>
M.A.Camblor et al, Studies in Surface Sciena ?« Catalysis, Volume 105, 341,1997,<br>
wherein nanocrystalline zeolite beta was synthesized with crystallite size 10 to lOOnm<br>
in the absence of alkali metal cations by using colloidal silica and aluminium metal<br>
powder. The disadvantages are this method requires longer crystallization times and<br>
the separation of zeolite crystals from the mother liquor require higher centrifiigation<br>
forces of up to 16,000 rpm. Reference is made to P. R. Hari Prasada Rao et al,<br>
Chemical Communications 1441, 1996 wherein zeolite beta was synthesized by dry<br>
gel conversion technique. The drawbacks are this process involves the presence of<br>
alkali metal cations in the synthetic mixture, and zeolite prepared will not be an acidic<br>
catalyst, longer crystallization times 3-6 days.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
the preparation of nanocrystalline zeolite beta by a modified aerogel protocol.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
nanocrystalline zeolite beta with a particle size of in the range of 10 to 80 nanometers<br>
with Si: Al molar ratio from 15 to 200 wherein the synthetic mixture is free from<br>
alkali metal cations.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation<br>
of nanocrystalline zeolite beta where the crystallization times are low and the<br>
nanocrystalline zeolite beta is produced in high yield, is highly crystalline and shows<br>
the typical beta zeolite IR absorption bands at 575 and 525 cm."1 and X-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
The novelty of present invention is the preparation of nanocrystalline zeolite<br>
beta with the crystallite size in the range of 10 to 80 nanometers and in a broad range<br>
of silica to alumina ratio 15 to 200 by a modified aerogel protocol. Most of the<br>
previously proposed methods for the preparation of zeolite beta have employed<br>
synthetic mixtures containing alkali metal cations and suggested that the presence of<br>
alkali metal cations is essential for the formation of the zeolite. Hence the preparation<br>
of zeolite beta in absence of alkali metal cations with small crystallite sizes is an<br>
exciting process. Controlled hydrolysis of the synthetic mixture, aging at room<br>
temperature, reducing the crystallization time and also subjecting the crystalline gel to<br>
supercritical drying conditions are novel ideas followed to get nanocrystalline zeolite<br>
beta in high yield. The obtained nanocrystalline zeolite beta offers several advantages<br>
over microcrystalline zeolite beta in terms of activity and selectivity due to increased<br>
active acidic sites and three dimensional interface with reactants for example 4-nitro oxylene<br>
is obtained with higher selectivity in the range of 65-75% from nitration of oxylene.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
nanocrystalline zeolite beta comprising hydrolysing a silica source and an aluminium<br>
source in the presence of a templating agent and in absence of alkali metal cations,<br>

range of 65-75% by the nitration of o-xylene.<br>
The following examples are given by way illustration of the present invention<br>
and therefore should not be constructed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Examplel<br>
Nanocrystalline zeolite beta was synthesized as follows:<br>
A solution containing 2.5gms of aluminum nitrate in 30.82gms of 25%<br>
aqueous solution of tetraethylammonium hydroxide was added in drop wise to<br>
20.8gms of tetraethylorthosilicate under stirring at room temperature for 30 min to<br>
form a gel. The hydrolysed gel was heated on a water bath at 50°C to evaporate the<br>
ethanol formed during hydrolysis and a precipitate was formed. This precipitate was<br>
dissolved into a thick solution within a half-hour time which was then stirred at room<br>
temperature for 24 hours. Crystallization of the thick solution was carried out in<br>
stainless steel autoclave for 24 h at 130°C to obtain white colloidal suspension. To<br>
this white colloidal suspension, methanol and toluene were added in 1:1 ratio (200 ml)<br>
and this solution was heated to 265°C by raising the temperature through l°C/min and<br>
held at this temperature for 10 min. Vented the solvent vapour at this temperature<br>
within one minute. The recovered free flow nanocrystalline zeolite beta was dried in<br>
oven at 120°C for 12 hrs and calcined in air at 600°C for 6hrs to remove organic<br>
template molecules. The yield, expressed as the weight of solids after calcination as a<br>
proportion of the total of SiO2 and A12O3 in the gel, was 89%.<br>
The nanocrystalline zeolite beta produced is highly crystalline and shows the<br>
typical beta zeolite X-ray diffraction spectrum and IR absorption bands at 575 and<br>
525 cm.'1.The surface area of the nanocrystall' oolite beta is 583 m2/g determined<br>
by the BET equation. The crystallite size . calculated by using Tranmission<br>
electron microscope and is less than 80 nanometers.<br>
Example 2<br>
In a typical reaction, 1.06gms of o-xylene and 0.1 gm of the catalyst were<br>
taken in to a 50-ml two-necked round-bottomed flask along with 6 ml of<br>
dichloroethane as the solvent. The resulting mixture was heated to 90°C and when the<br>
steady state is acquired, 1.06gms of nitric acid (70%) was slowly added for Ih and<br>
continued the reaction for 3hrs.A reverse Dean-Stark apparatus was used to separate<br>
water formed during the reaction. After completion of the reaction, the reaction<br>
mixture was filtered and the filtrate was subjected to base wash to remove the excess<br>
acid. The conversion is calculated based on GC analysis by using normalization<br>
method. The isomers formed were confirmed by GC-MS.<br>
Conversion (%) 48.00<br>
Selectivity (%)<br>
4-nitro o-xylene 68.00<br>
3-nitro o-xylene 32.00<br>
