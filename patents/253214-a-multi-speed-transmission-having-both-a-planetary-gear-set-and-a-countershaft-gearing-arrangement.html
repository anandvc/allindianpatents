MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/825,972, filed on September 18, 2006. The disclosure of the above-<br>
referenced provisional application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having both a<br>
planetary gear set and a countershaft gearing arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination<br>
of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-<br>
on" or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other,<br>
with the synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to<br>
actually making the dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow<br>
from the engine need not be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept<br>
typically uses countershaft gears with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to<br>
achieve each forward speed ratio (with the exception of being able to achieve a<br>
direct drive ratio in a rear wheel drive application). Accordingly, the total number<br>
of gears required in this typical design is two times the number of forward<br>
speeds, plus three for reverse. This necessitates a large number of required<br>
gear pairs, especially in transmissions that have a relatively large number of<br>
forward speed ratios.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004]	A transmission is provided having a planetary gear set with three<br>
input torque-transmitting mechanisms, such as friction clutches, to achieve<br>
torque flow through the planetary gear set to a countershaft gearing<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
arrangement. The transmission includes an input member, an output member, a<br>
planetary gear set, a first, second and third torque-transmitting mechanisms, and<br>
a countershaft gearing arrangement.<br>
[0005]	The planetary gear set has first, second and third members. The<br>
first, second and third torque-transmitting mechanisms each are selectively<br>
engageable to connect the input member with a respective different one of the<br>
members of the planetary gear set.<br>
[0006]	The countershaft gearing arrangement is operatively connected<br>
with the planetary gear set and includes: a plurality of sets of co-planar<br>
intermeshing gears, a first intermediate shaft, a second intermediate shaft, and a<br>
third intermediate shaft. The first intermediate shaft is connected for common<br>
rotation with the sun gear member of the planetary gear set. The second<br>
intermediate shaft is connected for common rotation with the carrier member of<br>
the planetary gear set. The third intermediate shaft is connected for common<br>
rotation with the ring gear member of the planetary gear set.<br>
[0007]	The countershaft is radially offset from and typically parallel to the<br>
intermediate shafts. The plurality of synchronizers are selectively engagable to<br>
connect selected ones of the gears with selected ones of said shafts for common<br>
rotation to thereby transfer torque from the planetary gear set to the output<br>
member along the shafts and the sets of co-planar intermeshing gears. Some of<br>
the synchronizers are each selectively engagable to connect a respective one of<br>
the gears rotatable about the countershaft with the countershaft for common<br>
rotation therewith.<br>
[0008]	The planetary gear set may be a beveled gear set, a simple pinion<br>
or a double pinion planetary gear set.<br>
[0009]	The countershaft gearing arrangement may be a two-axis design,<br>
having only one countershaft, or a multi-axis design, having two or more offset<br>
countershafts.<br>
[0010]	In another aspect of the invention, a reverse torque ratio may be<br>
achieved by utilizing a synchronizer that selectively connects one of the<br>
2<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
members of the planetary gear set to a stationary member to obtain a reverse<br>
torque ratio, thus eliminating the need for a dedicated set of intermeshing gears.<br>
[0011]	Thus, the present invention reduces the number of layshaft gears<br>
required for a given number of different gear states by "re-using" some or all of<br>
the physical gears in more than one gear state.<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages and other features and<br>
advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following<br>
detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken<br>
in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0025]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to<br>
like components, in Figure 1 a multi-speed transmission 10 is depicted. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input member 12 and an output member 14. In the<br>
present embodiment, input member 12 and output member 14 are shafts, and<br>
will be referred to as such. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the input<br>
and output members 12, 14 may be components other than shafts. The input<br>
shaft 12 is continuously connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a<br>
torque converter (not shown). The output shaft 14 is continuously connected<br>
with the final drive unit (not shown).<br>
[0026]	Transmission 10 includes a countershaft gearing arrangement 16<br>
that includes intermediate shafts, a countershaft, co-planar intermeshing gear<br>
sets and selectively engagable synchronizers as will be described herein. For<br>
example, the countershaft gearing arrangement 16 includes a first intermediate<br>
4<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
shaft 18, second intermediate shaft 20 and a third intermediate shaft 22. Second<br>
and third intermediate shafts 20, 22 are sleeve shafts that are concentric with the<br>
first intermediate shaft 18. The countershaft gearing arrangement 16 further<br>
includes a countershaft 24. Countershaft 24 is both spaced from and parallel<br>
with input shaft 12, output shaft 14 and intermediate shafts 18, 20.<br>
[0027]	A planetary gear set 28, which is a simple planetary gear set, is<br>
connected between the input shaft 12 and the output shaft 14. The planetary<br>
gear set 28 includes sun gear member 30 connected for common rotation with<br>
the first intermediate shaft 18, a ring gear member 32 connected for common<br>
rotation with third intermediate shaft 22, and a carrier member 34 which rotatably<br>
supports a set of pinion gears 36 which intermesh with both sun gear member 30<br>
and ring gear member 32.<br>
[0028]	The countershaft gearing arrangement 16 also includes co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear sets 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80. Gear set 40 includes gears 42 and<br>
44. Gear 42 is connected for common rotation with third intermediate shaft 22<br>
and intermeshes with gear 44. Gear 44 is rotatable about and selectively<br>
connectable with the countershaft 24. Co-planar gear set 50 includes gear 46<br>
and gear 48. Gear 46 is connected for common rotation with second<br>
intermediate shaft 20 and intermeshes with gear 48, which rotates about and is<br>
selectively connectable with countershaft 24.<br>
[0029]	Gear set 60 includes co-planar intermeshing gears 50 and 52.<br>
Gear 50 is connected for common rotation with the second intermediate shaft 20<br>
and intermeshes with gear 52, which is rotatable about and selectively<br>
connectable with countershaft 24.<br>
[0030]	Gear set 70 includes co-planar, intermeshing gears 54 and 56.<br>
Gear 54 rotates about first intermediate shaft 18 and is selectively connectable<br>
with second intermediate shaft 20. Gear 54 intermeshes with gear 56, which is<br>
connected for common rotation with countershaft 24.<br>
[0031]	Gear set 80 includes gear 58 and gear 60. Gear 58 is connected<br>
for common rotation with the output shaft 14 and is selectively connectable with<br>
5<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
the first intermediate shaft 18. Gear 58 intermeshes with gear 60. Gear 60 is<br>
connected for common rotation with the countershaft 24.<br>
[0032]	The transmission 10 includes a variety of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms or devices including first input clutch 62, second input clutch 64,<br>
and third input clutch 66 and brake member 67. First input clutch 62 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the input shaft 12 with the ring gear member 32.<br>
Second input clutch 64 is selectively engagable to connect the input shaft 12 with<br>
the carrier member 34. Third input clutch 66 is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the input shaft 12 with the sun gear member 30 and first intermediate shaft 18.<br>
Brake member 67 is selectively engagable to connect second intermediate shaft<br>
20 to a stationary member such as the transmission housing to restrict rotation of<br>
the second intermediate shaft 20.<br>
[0033]	The transmission 10 further includes a plurality of selectively<br>
engagable synchronizers 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, and 99. Synchronizer 90 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 44 with countershaft 24 for common<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 92 is selectively engagable to connect gear 48<br>
with countershaft 24 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 94 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 52 with countershaft 24 for common<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 96 is selectively engagable to connect the brake<br>
member 67 to second intermediate shaft 20 to restrict rotation of shaft 20.<br>
Synchronizer 98 is selectively engagable to connect gear 54 with second<br>
intermediate shaft 20 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 99 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 58 with first intermediate shaft 18 and,<br>
therefore, output shaft 14 with the intermediate shaft 18 for common rotation<br>
therewith.<br>
[0034]	The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and<br>
two reverse torque ratios as indicated in the truth table of Figure 2. Each of the<br>
forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one of the first, second, third torque-transmitting mechanism or input clutches 62,<br>
64, 66 and one or more of the synchronizers 90, 92, 94, 96, 98 and 99. Those<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated<br>
with each torque ratio. Thus, seven forward speed ratios may be attained by the<br>
transmission 10.<br>
[0035]	To establish the reverse torque ratio (Gear Rev 1), the input<br>
clutches and synchronizers are selected as set forth in the table of Figure 2. The<br>
input clutch 66 and synchronizers 90 and 96 are engaged. The input clutch 66<br>
connects the sun gear member 30 with the input shaft 12. Synchronizer 90<br>
connects gear 44 for common rotation with countershaft 24. Synchronizer 96<br>
connects second intermediate shaft 20 with brake member 67 for braking and<br>
fixing the rotation of shaft 20. Torque is thus transferred from the input shaft 12<br>
through the sun gear member 30 from ring gear member 32 and intermediate<br>
shaft 22 to gear 42 and gear 40 to countershaft 24. Torque is then transferred<br>
from gear 60 to gear 58 and thereby to the output shaft 14.<br>
[0036]	One additional reverse torque ratio (Gear Rev 2) also indicated in<br>
the truth table of Figure 2 is optionally available. The input clutches and<br>
synchronizers are selected as set forth in the table of Figure 2. The input clutch<br>
66 and synchronizers 90 and 92 are engaged. In this arrangement, torque flows<br>
through sun member 30, pinion gears 36 and ring gear member 32 to third<br>
intermediate shaft 22. The torque is then transferred through gear set 40 to<br>
countershaft 24, due to the engagement of synchronizer 90, and then to output<br>
shaft 14 through gear set 80. Torque also flows through sun gear member 30,<br>
pinion gears 36 and carrier member 34 to second intermediate shaft 20. Torque<br>
is then transferred through gear set 50 due to engagement of synchronizer 92,<br>
and then from countershaft 24 to output shaft 14 through gear set 80.<br>
[0037]	A first forward torque ratio (listed as Gear 1 in the truth table of<br>
Figure 2), is achieved by engaging the input clutch 66 and synchronizers 90 and<br>
98. In this arrangement, torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 through the<br>
sun gear member 30, pinion gear members 36 and ring gear member 32 to the<br>
third intermediate shaft 22. By the engagement of the synchronizer 90 and<br>
through gear set 40 torque is transferred to the countershaft 24. Torque is then<br>
transferred to the output shaft 14 through the gear set 80. Torque also flows<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
through sun gear member 30, pinion gears 36 and carrier member 34 to second<br>
intermediate shaft 20. Torque is then transferred through gear set 70 due to<br>
engagement of synchronizer 98, and then from countershaft 24 to output shaft 14<br>
through gear set 80.<br>
[0038]	A subsequent forward torque ratio, indicated as Gear 2 in Figure 2,<br>
is established by engagement of input clutch 64 and synchronizer 98. Gear 2<br>
may be achieved directly from Gear 1 without mechanical tie-up of the<br>
transmission 10. The shift from Gear 1 to Gear 2 occurs as follows. First,<br>
ensure that clutches 62 and 64 and synchronizers 92, 94, 96 and 99 are released<br>
and synchronizer 98 remains engaged. Second, clutch 66 is released and clutch<br>
64 is engaged. Finally, synchronizer 90 is released only after clutch 64 is<br>
engaged and after the transmission control system determines that a shift back<br>
to a lower gear is not imminent. In Gear 2, torque is transferred from the input<br>
shaft 12 to the second intermediate shaft 20 via the engaged input clutch 64.<br>
Torque is transferred along gear set 70, countershaft 24 and gear set 80 to<br>
output shaft 14 due to engagement of synchronizer 98.<br>
[0039]	The subsequent torque ratio, indicated as Gear 3 in the truth table<br>
of Figure 2, is established by the engagement of the input clutch 62 and<br>
synchronizer 90. The shift from Gear 2 to Gear 3 occurs as follows. First,<br>
ensure that clutches 62 and 66 and synchronizers 92, 94, 96 and 99 are<br>
released. Second, synchronizer 90 is engaged to pre-select Gear 3. Third, clutch<br>
64 is released and clutch 62 is engaged. Finally, synchronizer 98 is released only<br>
after clutch 62 is engaged and after the transmission control system determines<br>
that a shift back to a lower gear is not imminent. The input clutch 62 directs<br>
torque through ring gear member 32 and pinion gears 36 to both the intermediate<br>
shafts 20 and 22 via the carrier member 34 and ring gear member 32,<br>
respectively. The torque carried along intermediate shaft 22 is transferred to<br>
countershaft 24 through gear set 40 and then to output shaft 14 through gear set<br>
80 due to engagement of synchronizer 90.<br>
[0040]		The next subsequent forward torque ratio, indicated as Gear 4 in<br>
the truth table of Figure 2, is established with the engagement of the input clutch<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
64 and synchronizer 94. The shift from Gear 3 to Gear 4 occurs as follows.<br>
First, ensure that clutches 64 and 66 and synchronizers 92, 96, 98 and 99 are<br>
released. Second, synchronizer 94 is engaged to pre-select Gear 4. Third, clutch<br>
62 is released and clutch 64 is engaged. Finally, synchronizer 90 is released only<br>
after clutch 64 is engaged and after the transmission control system determines<br>
a shift back to a lower gear is not imminent. Torque is transferred from the input<br>
shaft 12 to second intermediate shaft 20 through carrier member 34 and pinion<br>
gears 36 due to engaged input clutch 64. Torque is then transferred through<br>
gear set 60 to countershaft 24 due to engagement of synchronizer 94. Torque is<br>
transferred through gear set 80 to output shaft 14.<br>
[0041]	A subsequent forward torque ratio indicated as Gear 5 in Figure 2,<br>
is established with the engagement of input clutch 66 and synchronizer 99. The<br>
shift from Gear 4 to Gear 5 occurs as follows. First, ensure that clutches 62 and<br>
66 and synchronizers 90, 92, 96 and 98 are released. Second, synchronizer 99 is<br>
engaged to pre-select Gear 5. Third, clutch 64 is released and clutch 66 is<br>
engaged. Finally, synchronizer 94 is released only after clutch 66 is engaged and<br>
after the transmission control system determines that a shift back to a lower gear<br>
is not imminent. Torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 along first<br>
intermediate shaft 18 directly to the output shaft 14 due to engagement of the<br>
input clutch 66 and synchronizer 99. Thus, a direct drive ratio is achieved, with<br>
the speed and torque of the output shaft 14 and the speed and torque of the<br>
input shaft 12 being equal.<br>
[0042]	A subsequent forward torque ratio indicated as Gear 6 in the truth<br>
table of Figure 2 is established with the engagement of input clutch 64 and<br>
synchronizer 92. The shift from Gear 5 to Gear 6 occurs as follows. First,<br>
ensure that clutches 62 and 64 and synchronizers 90, 94, 96 and 98 are<br>
released. Second, synchronizer 92 is engaged to pre-select Gear 6. Third, clutch<br>
66 is released and clutch 64 is engaged. Finally, synchronizer 99 is released only<br>
after clutch 64 is engaged and after the transmission control system determines<br>
that a shift back to a lower gear is not imminent. Torque is transferred from the<br>
input shaft 12 through the carrier member 34 and pinion gears 36, by<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
engagement of the input clutch 64, to second intermediate shaft 20. The torque<br>
carried on second intermediate shaft 20 is transferred to countershaft 24 through<br>
gear set 50 by engagement of the synchronizer 92. The torque carrier on<br>
countershaft 24 is transferred via the gear set 80 to output shaft 14.<br>
[0043]	To establish the next subsequent torque ratio, indicated as Gear 7<br>
in the truth table of Figure 2, input clutch 62 is engaged and synchronizers 92<br>
and 99 are engaged. The shift from Gear 6 to Gear 7 occurs as follows. First,<br>
ensure that clutches 62 and 66 and synchronizers 90, 94, 96 and 98 are<br>
released. Second, synchronizer 99 is engaged to pre-select Gear 7. Third, clutch<br>
64 is released and clutch 62 is engaged. Finally, synchronizer 92 remains<br>
engaged in Gear 7. Torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 to ring gear<br>
member 32 and third intermediate shaft 22 through engagement of input clutch<br>
62 and to second intermediate shaft 20 through carrier member 34 and pinions<br>
36. Torque is then transferred through gear set 50 due to engagement of<br>
synchronizer 92 to countershaft 24 and through gear set 80 to output shaft 14.<br>
Torque is also transferred to first intermediate shaft 18 through sun gear 30 and<br>
then through gear 58 to output shaft 14 by the engagement of synchronizer 99.<br>
[0044]	The present invention contemplates that downshifts follow<br>
essentially the reverse sequence of the corresponding upshift (as described<br>
above), and several power-on skip-shifts are possible (e.g. from 1st to 3rd, or<br>
from any physical gear ratio to any physical gear ratio on a different shaft).<br>
[0045]	With reference to Figure 3, a schematic representation of the<br>
transmission of Figure 1 is illustrated as a lever diagram. More specifically, the<br>
power flow from the input shaft 12 through the gear sets 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 to<br>
the output shaft 14 is shown for ease of reference. Further, a diagram illustrating<br>
the relationship between the physical or "pure" gears and the virtual gears of the<br>
transmission of Figure 1 is provided in Figure 4. As illustrated in Figure 4, the<br>
reverse gear ratios (REV1 and REV2) and the first and seventh gear ratios are<br>
virtual or blended gear ratios achieved by mixing or blending the ratios produced<br>
by the physical gears.<br>

Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
[0046]	Referring to Figure 5, torque ratios (i.e., the ratio of torque of the<br>
output member 14 to the input member 12) corresponding with each of the Gears<br>
shown in the truth table of Figure 2 are listed. These torque ratios are achieved<br>
utilizing the following sample component torque ratios which, in turn, are<br>
dependent on tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 10: the ring gear<br>
member/sun gear member planetary gear set torque ratio is 1.63 for a simple<br>
planetary gear arrangement; the torque ratio of gear 44 to gear 42 is 2.05; the<br>
torque ratio of gear 48 to gear 46 is 1.45; the torque ratio of gear 52 to gear 50 is<br>
0.60; the torque ratio of gear 56 to gear 54 is 0.49; the torque ratio of gear 60 to<br>
gear 58 is 0.96. The ratio steps between subsequent torque ratios are indicated<br>
in Figure 5, with an overall torque ratio of 6.20. It is apparent from the truth table<br>
of Figure 2 and the ratio chart of Figure 5 that torque ratios that are achieved<br>
utilizing the input clutch 62 (i.e., with input clutch 62 in an engaged state) have a<br>
numerical value between subsequent on-coming and off-going torque ratios.<br>
Thus, by utilizing the input clutch 62 and the planetary gear set, additional torque<br>
ratios are achieved than would be achievable with only the input clutches 62 and<br>
66, as the latter result in torque ratios dependant only on the ratios of the<br>
countershaft gear sets and not of the planetary gear set. The ratio steps from<br>
one gear to a subsequent gear (ie. Gear 1 to Gear 2) are shown in the graph of<br>
Figure 6.<br>
[0047]	Referring now to Figure 7, an alternate multi-speed transmission<br>
200 is depicted. The transmission 200 includes an input member 12 and an<br>
output member 14. In this embodiment, the input member 12 and the output<br>
member 14 are shafts, and will be referred to as such. Those skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that the input and output members 12, 14 may be components<br>
other than shafts. The input shaft 12 is continuously connected with an engine<br>
(not shown). The output shaft 14 is continuously connected with the final drive<br>
unit (not shown). The transmission 200 includes a countershaft gearing<br>
arrangement 202 that includes intermediate shafts, a countershaft, co-planar<br>
intermeshing gear sets and selectively engagable synchronizers as will be<br>
described herein. For instance, the countershaft gearing arrangement 202<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
includes first intermediate shaft 204, a second intermediate shaft 206 and a third<br>
intermediate shaft 208. Second intermediate shaft 206 is a sleeve shaft<br>
concentric with first intermediate shaft 204. Third intermediate shaft 208 is a<br>
sleeve shaft concentric with second intermediate shaft 206. The countershaft<br>
gearing arrangement 202 further includes a countershaft 210. The countershaft<br>
210 is both spaced from and parallel with the input shaft 12, the output shaft 14<br>
and the intermediate shafts 204, 206 and 208.<br>
[0048]	Planetary gear set 212, which is a simple planetary gear set, is<br>
connected between the input shaft 12 and the output shaft 14. The planetary<br>
gear set 212 includes sun gear member 214 connected for common rotation with<br>
first intermediate shaft 204, a ring gear member 216 connected for common<br>
rotation with third intermediate shaft 208, and a carrier member 218 which<br>
rotatably supports a set of pinion gears 220 which intermesh with both the sun<br>
gear member 214 and the ring gear member 216.<br>
[0049]	The countershaft gearing arrangement 202 also includes co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear sets 230, 232, 234 and 236. Gear set 230 includes gears 240<br>
and 242. Gear 240 is connected for common rotation with third intermediate<br>
shaft 208 and intermeshes with gear 242, which is rotatable about and selectively<br>
connectable with the countershaft 210. Gear set 232 includes gear 244 and gear<br>
246. Gear 244 is connected for common rotation with third intermediate shaft<br>
208 and intermeshes with gear 246, which is rotatable about and selectively<br>
connectable with the countershaft 210.<br>
[0050]	Co-planar gear set 234 includes gear 248 and gear 250. Gear 248<br>
is connected for common rotation with second intermediate shaft 206 and<br>
intermeshes with gear 250, which rotates about and is selectively connectable<br>
with countershaft 210.<br>
[0051]	Gear set 236 includes co-planar intermeshing gears 252 and 254.<br>
Gear 252 is selectively connectable for common rotation with the intermediate<br>
shaft 204 and intermeshes with gear 254, which is rotatable about and selectively<br>
connectable with countershaft 210.<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
[0052]	The transmission 200 includes a variety of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms or devices including input clutch 260, input clutch 262, input clutch<br>
264 and first brake member 265 and second brake member 267. Input clutch<br>
260 is selectively engagable to connect the input shaft 12 with the ring gear<br>
member 216 and third intermediate shaft 208. Input clutch 262 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the input shaft 12 with the carrier member 218 and second<br>
intermediate shaft 206. Input clutch 264 is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
input shaft 12 with the sun gear member 214 and first intermediate shaft 204.<br>
The transmission 200 further includes a plurality of selectively engagable<br>
synchronizers 266, 268, 270, 272, 274, and 276. Synchronizer 266 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect gear 242 with countershaft 210 for common rotation<br>
therewith. Synchronizer 268 is selectively engagable to connect gear 246 with<br>
countershaft 210 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 270 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect gear 250 with first brake member 265 for restricting<br>
rotation of gear 250. Synchronizer 272 is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
gear 254 with countershaft 210 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 274<br>
is selectively engagable to connect first intermediate shaft 204 with second brake<br>
member 267 for restricting rotation of shaft 204. Synchronizer 276 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect first intermediate shaft 204 with gear 252 for common<br>
rotation therewith and therefore with the output shaft 14.<br>
[0053]	The transmission 200 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 at the seven forward torque ratios and two<br>
reverse torque ratios indicated in the truth table of Figure 8. Those skilled in the<br>
art will readily understand how these torque ratios are achieved, based on the<br>
description of transmission 10.<br>
[0054]	With reference to Figure 9, a schematic representation of the<br>
transmission 200 of Figure 7 is illustrated. More specifically, the power flow from<br>
the input shaft 12 through the gear sets 230, 232, 234 and 236 to the output shaft<br>
14 is shown for ease of reference. Further, a diagram illustrating the relationship<br>
between the physical or "pure" gears and the virtual gears of the transmission<br>
200 of Figure 7 is provided in Figure 10. As illustrated in Figure 10, the reverse<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: GP309207-PTT-DLT<br>
gear ratios (REV1 and REV2), the first, fifth and seventh gear ratios are virtual or<br>
blended gear ratios achieved by mixing or blending the ratios produced by the<br>
physical gears.<br>
[0055]	Referring to Figure 11, torque ratios (i.e., the ratio of torque of the<br>
output member 14 to the input member 12) corresponding with each of the Gears<br>
shown in the truth table of Figure 8 are listed. These torque ratios are achieved<br>
utilizing the following sample component torque ratios which, in turn, are<br>
dependent on tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 200: the ring gear<br>
member/sun gear member planetary gear set torque ratio is 1.77 for a simple<br>
planetary gear arrangement; the torque ratio of gear 240 to gear 242 is 1.63; the<br>
torque ratio of gear 244 to gear 246 is 1.16; the torque ratio of gear 248 to gear<br>
250 is 0.61; the torque ratio of gear 252 to gear 254 is 1.18. The ratio steps<br>
between subsequent torque ratios are indicated in Figure 11, with an overall<br>
torque ratio of 6.304. It is apparent from the truth table of Figure 8 and the ratio<br>
chart of Figure 11 that torque ratios that are achieved utilizing the input clutch<br>
260 (i.e., with input clutch 260 in an engaged state) have a numerical value<br>
between subsequent on-coming and off-going torque ratios. Thus, by utilizing<br>
the input clutch 260 and the planetary gear set, additional torque ratios are<br>
achieved than would be achievable with only the input clutches 260 and 264, as<br>
the latter result in torque ratios depend only on the ratios of the countershaft gear<br>
sets and not of the planetary gear set. The ratio steps from one gear to a<br>
subsequent gear (i.e. Gear 1 to Gear 2) is shown in the graph of Figure 12 for the<br>
convenience of the reader.<br>
[0056]	The present invention has many advantages and benefits over prior<br>
art transmissions, which have either provided no "virtual" (blended) ratios, or<br>
have achieved additional "virtual" gear ratios only through interpolation. Through<br>
the use of three input clutches, the torque-blending input gear set, and three<br>
intermediate shafts, the present invention provides additional gear ratios through<br>
interpolation and extrapolation and therefore additional brakes, clutches,<br>
synchronizers and idler gears are not required to achieve additional gear ratios<br>
including reverse gears.<br>
