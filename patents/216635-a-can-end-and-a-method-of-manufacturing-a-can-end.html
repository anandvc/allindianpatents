				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a can end and a method of manufacturing a can end, and in particular to a can end containing promotional or informational material. Can ends are known which have been coated with a coloured coating, or where the centre panel of the can end has been printed with promotional material. WO99/09853 describes a can end with a decorated tab. However, the present invention provides an alternative to all of the above arrangements. W09846383 describes a container end manufacture. JP8072883 describes a can with printed code mark and its printing method. JPl 1124142 describes a two-piece type can with printed code mark and US6,053,349 describes a beverage can identification apparatus and method for reducing the spread of disease by limiting the chance of inadvertent drinking from an open can of another.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a can end comprising a peripheral seaming flange, a chuck wall dependent from the interior of the seaming flange, an outwardly concave annular reinforcing bead extending radially inwards frorn the chuck wall, and a central panel supported by an inner portion of the reinforcing bead, the chuck wall being inclined to an axis perpendicular to the central panel at an angle of between 30° and 60°, characterised in that the chuck wall is provided with an image.<br>
The image provided on the chuck wall is typically wording, one or more logos, a pattern, or a combination of some or all of these. The image is preferably a printed image, conceivably by the transfer of a sublimable ink from a carrier etc. Alternatively the image is an etched image. Other arrangements, such as embossing, scoring etc. may conceivably also be employed.<br>
This type of can end is in accordance with our earlier patent application W096/37414. A can end of this type, having a chuck wall angle of between 30° and 60°, provides a greater impact for informational or promotional material.<br>
Accordingly the invention also provides also a method of manufacturing a can end (1)<br>
comprising the steps of : i) providing a coil of metal; ii) stamping the coil into a plurality of<br>
blanks; iii) forming each blank into an end shell comprising a radially outer seaming flange, a<br>
chuck wall adjacent the seaming flange, a centre panel and an axially downward countersink<br>
joining the centre panel to the chuck wall, the chuck wall being inclined to an axis<br>
perpendicular to the cenfral panel at an angle of between 30° and 60°; iv) converting the<br>
shell to   an easy open can end by the steps of: a)	<br><br>
forming a score on a portion of the centre panel and b) forming a tab, and attaching the tab to the centre panel, characterised in that providing an image on the chuck wall of the can end.<br>
The image may be provided on the chuck wall in various ways. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, an area of the coil is provided with an image such that, when each blank is formed into a can end, the image is present on the chuck wall of the can end. In this arrangement care must be taken to maintain the registration of the coil and blank throughout the end making process. According to an alternative aspect of the invention an area of the blank is provided with an image such that, when the blank is formed into a can end, the image is present on the chuck wall of the can end. Altematively the image is added to the chuck wall when the end shell has been formed and before it is converted into a can end. Conceivably the image may even be added to the chuck wall after the end shell has been converted into a can end. The choice of when to apply the image may depend on the choice of method of applying the image. For example, where the chuck wall is to be printed, the type of ink to be employed (e.g. whether it be a thermally cured or even a UV cured ink), may govern the suitability of when to apply the image. Furthermore, the method of application of the ink, such as by a printing blanket or tampon or by means of ink jet printing, may also affect the choice of manufacturing technique.<br>
The invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a can end in accordance with the present invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view of the can end of FIG. 1; and<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic process diagram for the manufacture of can ends in accordance with the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to the Figures, the can end shown generally at 1 includes a seaming flange 2 (also known as a cover hook) and a chuck wall 3 extending axially and inwardly from the interior of the seaming flange 2. An outwardly concave reinforcing bead 4 (also known as a countersink) extends radially inwards from the chuck wall 3, and a central panel 5 is supported from the inner portion of the reinforcing bead 4. The centre panel includes a tab 6, secured to the centre panel by means of a rivet 7, and pivotable to break a score 8 in order to open an aperture in the can end. The chuck wall 3 extends at an angle of approx. 43° to the perpendicular (vertical), and is printed with an image 9, comprising logos 10 and a pattern 11. The image 9 is printed using a UV curable ink.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the manufacturing process used to produce the ends of FIGS. 1 and 2. A coil 12 of pre-lacquered and lubricated aluminium alloy is fed to a shell press 13 which stamps out blanks and forms them into a shell shown generally at 14. The end shell 14 is then fed on a carrier belt to a curler 15 which curls over the edges of the shell to form the seaming flange 2. The curled shells are then fed to a liner 16 where they are inverted, spun and compound is injected onto the underside of the seaming flange as shown at 17.<br>
The lined end shells are then fed on the carrier belt to a print station 18 where the chuck wall 3 is printed with an image using a UV curable ink. The ink is then cured by a burst of UV radiation at a curing station 19. The printed end shells are then fed on the carrier belt to a conversion press shown generally at 20. The rivet 7 is raised on the centre panel 5 of the shell, and the score 8 is applied to the centre panel to define the portion operable to produce an opening therein. More aluminium end stock 21 is used to produce a tab 6 which is staked to the end shell via the rivet on the centre panel. The resulting can end is shown generally at 22.<br>
As an alternative to the process of FIG. 3, the coil 12 may be pre-printed with the image 9, such that when the end shell 14 is converted into a can end, the image 9 appears on the chuck wall 3. Other alternatives include the placing of the print station<br><br>
18 and curing station 19 elsewhere in the line, such as between the shell press 13 and the curler 15, or even at the end of the line following the conversion press 20.<br><br><br>
