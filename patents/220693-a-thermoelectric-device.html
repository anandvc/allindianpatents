				<td>ENHANCED INTERFACE THERMOELECTRIC COOLERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Technical Field»<br>
The present invention relates to devices for cooling substances such<br>
as, for example, integrated circuit chips, and more particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to thermoelectric coolers.<br>
2. Description of Related Art:<br>
As the speed of computers continues to increase, the amount of heat<br>
generated by the circuits within the computers continues to increase. For<br>
many circuits and applications, increased heat degrades the performance of<br>
the computer. These circuits need to be cooled in order to perform most<br>
efficiently. In many low end computers, such as personal computers, the<br>
computer may be cooled merely by using a fan and fins for convective<br>
cooling. Howuver, for larger computers, such as main frames, that perform<br>
at faster speeds and generate much more heat, these solutions are not<br>
viable.<br>
Currently, many main frames utilize vapor compression coolers to<br>
cool the computer. These vapor compression coolers perform essentially<br>
the same as the central air conditioning units used in many homes.<br>
However, vapor compression coolers are quite mechanically complicated<br>
requiring insulation and hoses that must run to various parts of the main<br>
frame in order to cool the particular areas that are most susceptible to<br>
decreased performance due to overheating.<br>
A much simpler and cheaper type of cooler is a thermoelectric<br>
cooler. Thermoelectric coolers utilize a physical principle known as the<br>
Peltier Effect, by which DC current from a power source is applied across<br>
two dissimilar materials causing heat to be absorbed at the junction of<br>
the two dissimilar materials. Thus, the heat is removed from a hot<br>
substance and may be transported to a heat sink to be dissipated, thereby<br>
cooling the hot substance. Thermoelectric coolers may be fabricated<br>
within an integrated circuit chip and may cool specific hot spots directly<br>
without the need for complicated mechanical systems as is required by<br>
vapor compression coolers.<br>
However, current thermoelectric coolers are not as efficient as<br>
vapor compression coolers requiring more power to be expended to achieve<br>
the same amount of cooling. Furthermore, current thermoelectric coolers<br>
are not capable of cooling substances as greatly as vapor compression<br>
coolers. Therefore, a thermoelectric cooler with improved efficiency and<br>
cooling capacity would be desirable so that complicated vapor compression<br>
coolers could be eliminated from small refrigeration applications, such<br>
as, for example, main frame computers, thermal management of hot chips, RF<br>
communication circuits, magnetic read/write heads, optical and laser<br>
devices, and automobile refrigeration systems.<br>

necessarily being in physical contact with, a first array of electrically<br>
conducting tips at a discrete set of points such that electrical<br>
conduction between the planer surface of the first thermoelement and the<br>
first array of electrically conducting tips is facilitated while thermal<br>
conductivity between the two is retarded. A planer surface of the second<br>
thermoelement is proximate to, without necessarily being in physical<br>
contact with, a second array of electrically conducting tips at a discrete<br>
set of points such that electrical conduction between the electrically<br>
conducting tips and the planer surface of the second thermoelement is<br>
facilitated while thermal conduction between the two is retarded. The<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THB PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A high-level block diagram of a Thermoelectric Cooling (TEC) device<br>
in accordance with the prior art is depicted in Figure 1. Thermoelectric<br>
cooling, a well known principle, is based on the Peltier Effect, in which<br>
DC current is applied across two dissimilar materials causing heat to be<br>
absorbed at the junction of the two dissimilar materials.<br>
A typical known thermoelectric cooling device 100 utilizes p-type<br>
semiconductor 104 and n-type semiconductor 106 sandwiched between poor<br>
electrical conductors 108, that have good heat conducting properties, and<br>
electrical conductors 110 and 114. N-type semiconductor 106 has an excess<br>
of electrons, while p-type semiconductor 104 has a deficit of electrons. A<br>
DC power source 102 is connected between the two electrical conductors<br>
114.<br>
As electrons move from electrical conductor 110 to n-type<br>
semiconductor 10$, the energy state of the electrons is raised due to heat<br>
energy absorbed from heat source 112. This process has the effect of<br>
transferring heat energy from heat source 112 via electron flow through<br>
n-type semiconductor 106 and electrical conductor 114 to heat sink 116.<br>
The electrons drop to a lower energy state and release the heat energy in<br>
electrical conductor 114.<br>
The coefficient of performance, T), of a cooling refrigerator, such<br>
as thermoelectric cooler 100, is the ratio of the cooling capacity of the<br>
refrigerator divided by the total power consumption of the refrigerator.<br>
Thus<br>
the coefficient of performance is given by the equation:<br>
--<br>
n= 2<br>
'<br>
where the term alT, is due to the thermoelectric cooling, the term XI'R is<br>
due to Joule heating backflow, the term KdT is due to thermal conduction,<br>
the term I'R is due to Joule loss, the term alAT is due to work done<br>
against the Peltier voltage, a is the Seebeck coefficient for the<br>
material, K is the thermal conductivity of the Peltier device, Te is the<br>
temperature of the heat source, and AT is the difference in the<br>
temperature of the heat source from T* the temperature of the heat sink.<br>
The maximum coefficient of performance is derived by optimizing the<br>
current, I, and is given by the following relation:<br>
v7- T*/ //T,<br>
where the parameter y can be expressed as<br>
Where G is the electrical conductivity'and A is the thermal conductivity.<br>
The efficiency factor of the refrigeratore is given by the equation:<br>
r+i<br>
The figure of merit, ZT, is given by the equation:<br>
ZT =<br>
where thermal conductivity X is composed of two components: X,, the<br>
component due to electrons, and A*, the component due to the lattice and T<br>
is the mean of temperatures T, and Tk. Therefore, the maximum efficiency,<br>
e, is achieved as the figure of merit, ZT, approaches infinity. The<br>
efficiency of vapor compressor refrigerators is approximately 0.3. The<br>
efficiency of conventional thermoelectric coolers, such as thermoelectric<br>
cooler 100 in Figure 1, is typically less than 0.1. Therefore, to<br>
increase the efficiency of thermoelectric coolers to such a range as to<br>
compete with vapor compression refrigerators, the figure of merit, ZT,<br>
must be increased to greater than 2. If a value for the figure of merit,<br>
ZT, of greater than 2 can be achieved, then the thermoelectric coolers may<br>
be staged to achieve the same efficiency and cooling capacity as vapor<br>
compression refrigerators.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, a cross sectional view of a<br>
thermoelectric cooler with enhanced structured interfaces is depicted in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Thermoelectric cooler 200 includes<br>
a heat source 226 from which, with current I flowing as indicated, heat is<br>
extracted and delivered to heat sink 202. Heat source 226 may be<br>
thermally coupled to a substance that is desired to be cooled. Heat sink<br>
202 may be thermally coupled to devices such as, for example, a heat pipe,<br>
fins, and/or a condensation unit to dissipate the heat removed .from heat<br>
source 226 and/or further cool heat source 226.<br>
Heat source 226 is comprised of p- type doped silicon. Heat source<br>
226 is thermally coupled to n+ type doped silicon regions 224 and 222 of<br>
tips 250. N+ type regions 224 and 222 are electrical conducting as well<br>
as being good thermal conductors. Bach of N+ type regions 224 and 222<br>
forms a reverse diode with heat source 226 such that no current flows<br>
between heat source 226 and n+ regions 224 and 222, thus providing the<br>
electrical isolation of heat source 226 from electrical conductors 218 and<br>
220.<br>
Heat sink 202 is comprised of p- type doped silicon. Heat sink 202<br>
is thermally coupled to n+ type doped silicon regions 204 and 206. N+<br>
type regions 204 and 206 are electrically conducting and good thermal<br>
conductors. Bach of N+ type regions 204 and 206 and heat sink 202 forms a<br>
reverse diode so that no current flows between the N+ type regions 204 and<br>
206 and heat sink' 202, thus providing the electrical isolation of heat<br>
sink 202 from electrical conductor 208. More information about electrical<br>
isolation of thermoelectric coolers may be found in U.S. Patent No.<br>
use,222,113 Bl entitled "Electrically Isolated Ultra-Thin Substrates for<br>
Thermoelectric Coolers" assigned to the International Business Machines<br>
Corporation of Armonk, New York and filed on December' 9, 1999, the<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated herein for all purposes.<br>
The need for forming reverse diodes with n+ and p- regions to<br>
electrically isolate conductor 208 from heat sink 202 and conductors 218<br>
and 220 from heat source 226 is not needed if the heat sink 202 and heat<br>
source 226 are constructed entirely from undoped non-electrically<br>
conducting silicon. However, it is very difficult to ensure that the<br>
silicon is entirely undoped. Therefore, the presence of the reverse<br>
diodes provided by the n+ and p- regions ensures that heat sink 202 and<br>
heat source 226 are electrically isolated from conductors 208, 218, and<br>
220. Also, it should be noted that the same electrical isolation using<br>
reverse diodes may be created other ways, for example, by using p+ type<br>
doped silicon and n- type doped silicon rather than the p- and n+ types<br>
depicted. The terms n+ and p+, as used herein, refer to highly n doped<br>
and highly p doped semiconducting material respectively. The terms n- and<br>
p-, as used herein, mean lightly n doped and lightly p doped<br>
semiconducting material respectively.<br>
Thermoelectric cooler 200 is similar in construction to<br>
thermoelectric cooler 100 in Figure 1. However, N-type 106 and P-type 104<br>
semiconductor structural interfaces have been replaced with superlattice<br>
thermoelement structures 210 and 212 that are electrically coupled by<br>
electrical conductor 208. Electrical conductor 208 may be formed from<br>
platinum (Pt) or, alternatively, from other conducting materials, such as,<br>
for example, tungsten (W), nickel (Ni), or titanium copper nickel<br>
(Ti/Cu/Ni) metal films.<br>
A superlattice is a structure consisting of alternating layers of<br>
two different semiconductor materials, each several nanometers thick.<br>
Thermoelement 210 is constructed from alternating layers of N-type<br>
semiconducting materials and the superlattice of thermoelement 212 is<br>
constructed from alternating layers of P-type semiconducting materials.<br>
Bach of the layers of alternating materials in each of thermoelements 210<br>
and 212 is 10 nanometers (nm) thick. A superlattice of two semiconducting<br>
materials has lower thermal conductivity, A, and the same electrical<br>
conductivity, a, as an alloy comprising the same two semiconducting<br>
materials.<br>
In one embodiment, super-lattice thermoelement 212 comprises<br>
alternating layers of p-type bismuth chalcogenide materials such as, for<br>
example, alternating layers of Bi2Te,/Sb,Tei with layers of Bi0.,Sbi.,Tej, and<br>
the superlattice of thermoelement 210 comprises alternating layers of<br>
n-type bismuth chalcogenide materials, such as, for example, alternating<br>
layers of Bi»Te&gt; with layers of Bi,Sei. Other types of semiconducting<br>
materials may be used for superlattices for thermoelements 210 and 212 as<br>
well. For example, rather than bismuth chalcogenide materials, the<br>
superlattices of thermoelements 210 and 212 may be constructed from cobalt<br>
antimony skutteridite materials.<br>
Thermoelectric cooler 200 also includes tips 250 through which<br>
electrical current I passes into thermoelement 212 and then from<br>
thermoelement 210 into conductor 21B. Tips 250 includes n+ type<br>
semiconductor 222 and 224 formed into pointed conical structures with a<br>
thin overcoat layer 218 and 220 of conducting material, such as, for<br>
example, platinum (Pt). Other conducting materials that may be used in<br>
place of platinum include, for example, tungsten (W), nickel (Ni), and<br>
titanium copper nickel (Ti/Cu/Ni) metal films. The areas between<br>
and around the tips 250 and thermoelectric materials 210 and 212 should be<br>
evacuated or hermetically sealed with a gas such as, for example, dry<br>
nitrogen.<br>
On the ends of tips 250 covering the conducting layers 218 and 220<br>
is a thin layer of semiconducting material 214 and 216. Layer 214 is<br>
formed from a P-type material having the same Seebeck coefficient, a, as<br>
the nearest layer of the superlattice of thermoelement 212 to tips 250.<br>
Layer 216 is formed from an N-type material having the same Seebeck<br>
coefficient, a, .as the nearest layer of thermoelement 210 to tips 250.<br>
The P-type thermoelectric overcoat layer 214 is necessary for<br>
thermoelectric cooler 200 to function since cooling occurs in the region<br>
near the metal where the electrons and holes are generated. The n-type<br>
thermoelectric overcoat layer 216 is beneficial, because maximum cooling<br>
occurs where the gradient (change) of the Seebeck coefficient is maximum.<br>
The thermoelectric overcoat 214 for the P-type region is approximately 60<br>
nm thick. A specific thickness of the n-type thermoelectric overcoat 216<br>
has yet to be fully refined, but it is anticipated that it should be in a<br>
similar thickness range to the thickness of the thermoelectric overcoat<br>
214.<br>
By making the electrical conductors, such as, conductors 110 in<br>
Figure 1, into pointed tips 250 rather than a planer interface, an<br>
increase in cooling efficiency is achieved. Lattice thermal conductivity,<br>
A, at the point of tips 250.is very small because of lattice mismatch.<br>
For example, the thermal conductivity, A, of bismuth chalcogenides is<br>
normally approximately 1 Watt/meter*Kelvin. However, in pointed tip<br>
structures, such as tips 250, the thermal conductivity is reduced, due to<br>
lattice mismatch at the point, to approximately 0.2 Watte/meter*Kelvin.<br>
However, the electrical conductivity of the thermoelectric materials<br>
remains relatively unchanged. Therefore, the figure of merit, ZT, may be<br>
increased to greater than 2.5 for this kind of material. Another type of<br>
material that is possible for the superlattices of thermoelements 210 and<br>
212 is cobalt antimony skutteridites. These type of materials typically<br>
have a very high thermal conductivity, A, making them normally<br>
undesirable. However, by using the pointed tips 250, the thermal<br>
conductivity can be reduced to a minimum and produce a figure of merit,<br>
ZT, for these materials of greater than 4, thus making these materials<br>
very attractive for use in thermoelements 210 and 212. Therefore, the use<br>
of pointed tips 250 further increases the efficiency of the thermoelectric<br>
cooler 200 such that it is comparable to vapor compression refrigerators.<br>
Another advantage of the cold point structure is that the electrons<br>
are confined to dimensions smaller than the wavelength (corresponding to<br>
their kinetic energy). This type of confinement increases the local<br>
density of states available for transport and effectively increases the<br>
Seebeck coefficient. Thus, by increasing " and decreasing 8, the figure of<br>
merit ZT is increased.<br>
Normal cooling capacity of conventional thermoelectric coolers, such<br>
as illustrated in Figure 1, are capable of producing a temperature<br>
differential, AT, between the heat source and the heat sink of around 60<br>
Kelvin. However, thermoelectric cooler 200 is capable of producing a<br>
temperature differential of the order of 150 Kelvin. Thus, with two<br>
thermoelectric coolers coupled to each other, cooling to temperatures in<br>
the range of liquid Nitrogen (less than 100 Kelvin) is possible. However,<br>
different materials may need to be used for thermoelements 210 and 212.<br>
For example, bismuth telluride has a very low a at low temperature (i.e.<br>
less than -100 degrees Celsius). However, bismuth antimony alloys perform<br>
well at low temperature.<br>
10<br>
Another advantage of the cobalt antimony skutteridite materials over<br>
the bismuth chalcogenide materials, not related to temperature, is the<br>
fact that the cobalt antimony skutteridite materials are structurally more<br>
stable whereas the bismuth chalcogenide materials are structurally weak.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the<br>
construction of the thermoelectric cooler in Figure 2 may vary depending<br>
on the implementation. For example, more or fewer rows of tips 250 may be<br>
included than depicted in Figure 1. The depicted example is not meant to<br>
imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.<br>
With reference now to Figure 3, a planer view of thermoelectric<br>
cooler 200 in Figure 2 is depicted in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Thermoelectric cooler 300 includes an n-type thermoelectric<br>
material section 302 and a p-type thermoelectric material section 304.<br>
Both n-type section 302 and p-type section 304 include a thin layer of<br>
conductive material 306 that covers a silicon body.<br>
Section 302 includes an array of conical tips 310 each covered with<br>
a thin layer of n-type material 308 of the same type as the nearest layer<br>
of the superlattice for thermoelement 210. Section 304 includes an array<br>
of conical tips 312 each covered with a thin layer of p-type material 314<br>
of the same type as the nearest layer of the superlattice for<br>
thermoelement 212.<br>
With reference now to Figures 4A and 4B, a cross sectional views of<br>
tips that may be implemented as one of tips 250 in Figure 2 is depicted in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Tip 400 includes a silicon cone<br>
that has been formed with a cone angle of approximately 35 degrees. A<br>
thin layer 404 of conducting material, such as platinum (Ft), overcoats<br>
the silicon 402. A thin layer of thermoelectric material 406 covers the<br>
very end of the tip 400. The cone angle after all layers have been<br>
deposited is approximately 45 degrees. The effective tip radius of tip<br>
400 is approximately 50 nanometers.<br>
Tip 408 is an alternative embodiment of a tip, such as one of tips<br>
250. Tip 408 includes a silicon cone 414 with a conductive layer 412 and<br>
thermoelectric material layer 410 over the point. However, tip 408 has a<br>
much sharper cone angle than tip 400. The effective tip radius of tip 408<br>
is approximately 10 nanometers. It is not known at this time whether a<br>
broader or narrower cone angle for the tip is preferable. In the present<br>
11<br>
embodiment, conical angles of 45 degrees for the tip, as depicted in<br>
Figure 4A, have been chosen, since such angle is in the middle of possible<br>
ranges of cone angle and because such formation is easily formed with<br>
silicon with a platinum overcoat. This is because a KOH etch along the<br>
100 plane of silicon naturally forms a cone angle of 54 degrees. Thus,<br>
after the conductive and thermoelectric overcoats have been added, the<br>
cone angle is approximately 45 degrees.<br>
With reference now to Figure 5, a cross sectional view illustrating<br>
the temperature field of a tip near to a superlattice is depicted in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Tip 504 may be implemented as one<br>
of tips 250 in Figure 2. Tip 504 has an effective tip radius, a, of 30-50<br>
nanometers. Thus, the temperature field is localized to a very small<br>
distance, r, approximately equal to 2a or around 60-100 nanometers.<br>
Therefore, a superlattice 502 needs to be only a few layers thick with a<br>
thickness, d, of around 100 nanometers. Therefore, using pointed tips, a<br>
thermoelectric cooler with only 5-10 layers for the superlattice is<br>
sufficient.<br>
Thus, fabricating a thermoelectric cooler, such as, for example,<br>
thermoelectric cooler 200, is not extremely time consuming, since only a<br>
few layers of the superlattice must be formed rather than numerous layers<br>
which can be very time consuming. Thus, thermoelectric cooler 200 can be<br>
fabricated very thin (of the order of 100 nanometers thick) in contrast to<br>
prior art thermoelectric coolers which were of the order of 3 millimeters<br>
or greater in thickness.<br>
Other advantages of a thermoelectric cooler with pointed tip<br>
interfaces in accordance with the present invention include minimization<br>
of the thermal conductivity of the thermoelements, such as thermoelements<br>
210 and 212 in Figure 2, at the tip interfaces. Also, the<br>
temperature/potential drops are localized to an area near the tips,<br>
effectively achieving scaling to sub-100-nanometer lengths. Furthermore,<br>
using pointed tips minimizes the number of layers for superlattice growth<br>
by effectively reducing the thermoelement lengths. The present invention<br>
also permits electrodeposition of thin film structures and avoids<br>
flip-chip bonds. The smaller dimensions allow for monolithic integration<br>
of n-type and p-type thermoelements.<br>
The thermoelectric cooler of the present invention may be utilized<br>
to cool items, such as, for example, specific spots within a main frame<br>
computer, lasers, optic electronics, photodetectors, and PCR in genetics.<br>
12<br>
With reference now to Figure 6, a cross sectional view of a<br>
thermoelectric cooler with enhanced structured interfaces with all metal<br>
tips is depicted in accordance with the present invention. Although the<br>
present invention has been described above as having tips 250 constructed<br>
from silicon cones constructed from the n+ semiconducting regions 224 and<br>
222, tips 250 in Figure. 2 may be replaced by tips 650 as depicted in<br>
Figure 6. Tips 650 have all metal cones 618 and 620. In the depicted<br>
embodiment, cones 618 and 620 are constructed from copper and have a<br>
nickel overcoat layer 660 and 662. Thermoelectric cooler 600 is identical<br>
to thermoelectric cooler 200 in all other respects, including having a<br>
thermoelectric overcoat 216 and 214 over the tips 650. Thermoelectric<br>
cooler 600 also provides the same benefits as thermoelectric cooler 200.<br>
However, by using, all metal cones rather than silicon cones covered with<br>
conducting material, the parasitic resistances within the cones become<br>
very low, thus further increasing the efficiency of thermoelectric cooler<br>
600 over the already increased efficiency of thermoelectric cooler 200.<br>
The areas surrounding tips 650 and between tips 650 and thermoelectric<br>
materials 210 and 212 should be vacuum or hermetically sealed with a gas,<br>
such as, for example, dry nitrogen.<br>
Also, as in Figure 2, heat source 226 is comprised of p- type doped<br>
silicon. In contrast to Figure 2, however, heat source 226 is thermally<br>
coupled to n+ type doped silicon regions 624 and 622 that do not form part<br>
of the tipped structure 650 rather than to regions that do form part of<br>
the tipped structure as do regions 224 and 222 do in Figure 2. N+ type<br>
doped silicon regions 624 and 622 do still perform the electrical<br>
isolation function performed by regions 224 and 222 in Figure 2.<br>
Several methods may be utilized to form the all metal cones as<br>
depicted in Figure 6. For example, with reference now to Figure 7, a<br>
cross-sectional view of a sacrificial silicon template that may be used<br>
for forming all metal tips is depicted in accordance with the present<br>
invention. After the sacrificial silicon template 702 has been<br>
constructed having conical pits, a layer of metal may be deposited over<br>
the template 702 to produce all metal cones 704. All metal cones 704 may<br>
then be used in thermoelectric cooler 600.<br>
With reference now to Figure 8, a flowchart illustrating an<br>
exemplary method of producing all metal cones using a silicon sacrificial<br>
template is depicted in accordance with the present invention. To begin,<br>
conical pits are fabricated by anisotropic etching of silicon to create a<br>
13<br>
mold (step 802). This may be done by a combination of KOH etching,<br>
oxidation, and/or focused ion-beam etching. Such techniques of<br>
fabricating a silicon cone are well known in the art.<br>
The silicon sacrificial template is then coated with a thin<br>
sputtered layer of seed metal, such as, for example, titanium or platinum<br>
(step 804). Titanium is preferable since platinum forms slightly more<br>
rounded tips than titanium, which is very conforming to the conical pits.<br>
Next, copper is electrochemically deposited to fill the valleys (conical<br>
pits) in the sacrificial silicon template, (step 806). The top surface of<br>
the copper is then planarized (step 808) . Methods of planarizing a layer<br>
of metal are well known in the art. The silicon substrate is then removed<br>
by selective etching methods well known in the art (step 810). The all<br>
metal cones produced in this manner may then be covered with a coat of<br>
another metal, such as,,for example, nickel or titanium and then with an<br>
ultra-thin layer of thermoelectric material. The nickel or titanium<br>
overcoat aids in electrodeposition of the thermoelectric material<br>
overcoat.<br>
[One advantage to this method of producing all metal cones is that<br>
the mold that is produced is reusable. The mold may be reused up to<br>
around 10 times before the mold degrades and becomes unusable.] Forming a<br>
template in this manner is very well controlled and produces very uniform<br>
all metal conical tips since silicon etching is very predictable and can<br>
calculate slopes of the pita and sharpness of the cones produced to a very<br>
few nanometers.<br>
Other methods of forming all metal cones may be used as well. For<br>
example, with reference now to Figure 9, a cross sectional view of all metal<br>
cones 902 formed using patterned photoresist is depicted in accordance with<br>
the present invention. In this method, a layer of metal is formed over the<br>
bottom portions of a partially fabricated thermoelectric cooler. A<br>
patterned photoresist 904-908 is then used to fashion all metal cones 902<br>
with a direct electrochemical etching method.<br>
With reference now to Figure 10, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary<br>
method of forming all metal cones using photoresist is depicted in<br>
accordance with the present invention. To begin, small sections of<br>
photoresist are patterned over a metal layer, such as copper, of a partially<br>
fabricated thermoelectric cooler, such as thermoelectric cooler 600, in<br>
Figure 6 (step 1002). The photoresist may be patterned in an array of<br>
sections having photoresist wherein each area of photoresist within the<br>
14<br>
array corresponds to areas in which tips to the all metal cones are desired<br>
to be formed. The metal is then directly etched electrochemically (step<br>
1004) to produce cones 902 as depicted in Figure 9. The photoresist is then<br>
removed and the tips of the all metal cones may then be coated with another<br>
metal, such as, for example, nickel (step 1006). The second metal coating<br>
over the all metal cones may then be coated with an ultra-thin layer of<br>
thermoelectric material (step 1008). Thus, all metal cones with a<br>
thermoelectric layer on the tips may be formed which may used in a<br>
thermoelectric device, such as, for example, thermoelectric cooler 600. The<br>
all metal conical points produced in this manner are not as uniform as those<br>
produced using the method illustrated in Figure 8. However, this method<br>
currently is cheaper and therefore, if cost is an important factor, may be a<br>
more desirable method.<br>
The depicted methods of fabricating all metal cones are merely<br>
examples. Other methods may be used as well to fabricate all metal cones<br>
for use with thermoelectric coolers. Furthermore, other types of metals<br>
may be used for the all'metal cone other than copper.<br>
With reference now to Figure 11, a cross-sectional view of a<br>
thermoelectric cooler with enhanced structural interfaces in which the<br>
thermoelectric material rather than the metal conducting layer is formed<br>
into tips at the interface is depicted in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Thermoelectric cooler 1100 includes a cold plate 1116 and a<br>
hot plate 1102, wherein the cold plate is in thermal contact with the<br>
substance that is to be cooled. Thermal conductors 1114 and 1118 provide<br>
a thermal couple between electrical conducting plates 1112 and 1120<br>
respectively. Thermal conductors 1114 and 1118 are constructed of heavily<br>
n doped (n+) semiconducting material that provides electrical isolation<br>
between cold plate 1116 and conductors 1112 and 1120 by forming reverse<br>
biased diodeu with the p- material of the cold plate 1116. Thus, heat is<br>
transferred from the cold plate 1116 through conductors 1112 and 1120 and<br>
eventually to hot plate 1102 from which it can be dissipated without<br>
allowing an electrical coupling between the thermoelectric cooler 1100 and<br>
the substance that is to be cooled. Similarly, thermal conductor 1104<br>
provides a thermal connection between electrical conducting plate 1108 and<br>
hot plate 1102, while maintaining electrical isolation between the hot<br>
plate and electrical conducting plate 1108 by forming a reverse biased<br>
diode with the hot plate 1102 p- doped semiconducting material as<br>
discussed above. Thermal conductors 1104 is also an n+ type doped<br>
semiconducting material. Electrical conducting plates 1108, 1112, and<br>
15<br>
1120 are constructed from platinum (Ft) in this embodiment. However,<br>
other materials that are both electrically conducting and thermally<br>
conducting may be utilized as well. Also, it should be mentioned that the<br>
areas surrounding tips 1130-1140 and between tips 1130-1140 and<br>
thermoelectric materials 1122 and 1110 should be evacuated to produce a<br>
vacuum or should be hermetically sealed with a gas, such as, for example,<br>
dry nitrogen.<br>
In this embodiment, rather than providing contact between the<br>
thermoelements and the heat source (cold end) metal electrode (conductor)<br>
through an array of points in the. metal electrode as in Figures 2 and 6,<br>
the array of points of contact between the thermoelement and the metal<br>
electrode ia provided by an array of points 1130-1140 in the<br>
thermoelements 1124 and 1126. In the embodiments described above with<br>
reference to Figures 2 and 6, the metal electrode at the cold end was<br>
formed over silicon tips or alternatively metal patterns were directly<br>
etched to form all-metal tips. However, these methods required<br>
thermoelectric materials to be deposited over the cold and the hot<br>
electrodes by electrochemical methods. The electrodeposited materials<br>
tend to be polycrystalline and do not have ultra-planar surfaces. Also,<br>
the surface thermoelectric properties may or may not be superior to single<br>
crystalline thermoelectric materials. Annealing improves the<br>
thermoelectric properties of the polycrystalline materials, but surface<br>
smoothness below lOOnra roughness levels remains a problem. The tips<br>
1130-1140 of the present embodiment may be formed from single crystal or<br>
polycrystal thermoelectric materials by electrochemical etching.<br>
In one embodiment, thermoelement 1124 is comprised of a super<br>
lattice of single crystalline BijTe,/SbaTej and Bi0.sSbi.iTei and thermoelement<br>
1126 is formed of a super lattice of single crystalline Bi,Te,/BijSe3 and<br>
BiaTe,.0Se0.i. Electrically conducting plate 1120 is coated with a thin<br>
layer 1122 of the same thermoelectric material as is the material of the<br>
tips 1130-1134 that are nearest thin layer 1120. Electrically conducting<br>
plate 1112 is coated with a thin layer 1110 of the same thermoelectric<br>
material as is the material of the tips 1136-1140 that are nearest thin<br>
layer 1112.<br>
With reference now to Figure 12, a flowchart illustrating an<br>
exemplary method of fabricating a thermoelectric cooler, such as, for<br>
example, thermoelectric cooler 1100 in Figure 11, is depicted in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Optimized single crystal material<br>
are first bonded to metal electrodes by conventional means or metal<br>
electrodes are deposited onto single crystal materials to form the<br>
electrode connection pattern (step 1202). The other side of the<br>
thermoelectric material 1314 is then patterned (step 1204) by photoresist<br>
1302-1306 as depicted in Figure 13 and metal electrodes are used in an<br>
electrochemical bath as an anode to electrochemically etch the surface<br>
(step 1206). The tips 1308-1312 as depicted in Figure 13 are formed by<br>
controlling and etopping the etching process at appropriate times.<br>
A second single crystal substrate is thinned by chemical-mechanical<br>
polishing and then electrochemically etching the entire substrate to<br>
nanometer films (step 1210). The second substrate with the ultra-thin<br>
substrate forms the cold end and the two substrates (the one with the<br>
ultra-thin thermoelectric material and the other with the thermoelectric<br>
tips) are clamped together with pressure (step 1212). This structure<br>
retains high crystallinity in all regions other than the interface at the<br>
tips. Also, the same method can be used to fabricate polycrystalline<br>
structures rather than single crystalline structures.<br>
With reference now to Figure 14, a diagram showing a cold point tip<br>
above a surface for use in a thermoelectric cooler illustrating the<br>
positioning of the tip relative to the surface is depicted in accordance<br>
with the present invention. Although the tips, whether created in as<br>
all-metal or metal coated tips or as thermoelectric tips have been<br>
described thus far as being in contact with the surface opposite the tips.<br>
However, although the tips may be in contact with the opposing surface, it<br>
is preferable that the tips be near the opposing surface without touching<br>
the surface as depicted in Figure 14. The tip 1402 in Figure 14 is<br>
situated near the opposing surface 1404 but is not in physical contact<br>
with.the opposing surface. Preferably, the tip 1402 should be a distance<br>
d on the order of 5 nanometers or less from the opposing surface 1404. In<br>
practice, with a thermoelectric cooler containing thousands of tips, some<br>
of the tips may be in contact with the opposing surface while others are<br>
not in contact due to the deviations from a perfect plane of the opposing<br>
surface.<br>
By removing the tips from contact with the opposing surface, the<br>
amount of thermal conductivity between the cold plate and the hot plate of<br>
a thermoelectric cooler may be reduced. Electrical conductivity is<br>
maintained, however, due to tunneling of electrons between the tips and<br>
the opposing surface.<br>
17<br>
The tips of the present invention have also been described and<br>
depicted primarily as perfectly pointed tips. However, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 14, the tips in practice will typically have a slightly more<br>
rounded tip as is the case with tip 1403. However, the closer to<br>
perfectly pointed the tip is, the fewer number of superlattices needed to<br>
achieve the temperature gradient between the cool temperature of the tip<br>
and the hot temperature of the hot plate.<br>
Preferably, the radius of curvature r« of the curved end of the tip<br>
1402 is of the order of a few tens of nanometers. The temperature<br>
difference between adjacent areas of the thermoelectric material below<br>
surface 1404 approaches zero over a distance of two (2) to three (3) times<br>
the radius of curvature r, of the end of tip 1402. Therefore, only a few<br>
layers of the super lattice 1406-1414 are necessary. Thus, a superlattice<br>
material opposite the tips is feasible when the electrical contact between<br>
the hot and cold plates is made using the tips of the present invention.<br>
This is in contrast to the prior art in which to use a superlattice<br>
structure without tips, a superlattice of 10000 or more layers was needed<br>
to have a sufficient thickness in which to allow the temperature gradient<br>
to approach zero. Such a number of layers was impractical, but using only<br>
5 or 6 layers as in the present invention is much more practical.<br>
Although the present invention has been described primarily with<br>
reference to a thermoelectric cooling device (or Peltier device) with<br>
tipped interfaces used for cooling, it will be recognized by those skilled<br>
in the art that the present invention may be utilized for generation of<br>
electricity as well. It is well recognized by those skilled in the art<br>
that thermoelectric devices can be used either in the Peltier mode (as<br>
described above) for refrigeration or in the Seebeck mode for electrical<br>
power generation. Referring now to Figure 15, a schematic diagram of a<br>
thermoelectric power generator is depicted. For ease of understanding and<br>
explanation of thermoelectric power generation, a thermoelectric power<br>
generator according to the prior art is depicted rather than a<br>
thermoelectric power generator utilizing cool point tips of the present<br>
invention. However, it should be noted that in one embodiment of a<br>
thermoelectric power generator according to the present invention, the<br>
thermoelements 1506 and 1504 are replaced by cool point tips, as for<br>
example, any of the cool point tip embodiments as described in greater<br>
detail above.<br>
In a thermoelectric power generator 1500, rather than running<br>
current through the thermoelectric device from a power source 102 as<br>
18<br>
indicated in Figure 1, a temperature differential, T,,-TL, is created across<br>
the thermoelectric device 1500. Such temperature differential, TM-Tt,<br>
induces a current flow,. I, as indicated in Figure 15 through a resistive<br>
load element 1502. This is the opposite mode of operation from the mode<br>
of operation described in Figure 1<br>
Therefore, other than replacing a power source 102 with a resistor<br>
1502 and maintaining heat elements 1512 and 1516 and constant temperatures<br>
T» and TL respectively with heat sources On and QL respectively,<br>
thermoelectric device 1500 is identical in components to thermoelectric<br>
device 102 in Figure 1. Thus, thermoelectric cooling device 1500 utilizes<br>
p-type semiconductor 1504 and n-type semiconductor 1506 sandwiched between<br>
poor electrical conductors 1508 that have good heat conducting properties.<br>
Bach of elements 1504, 1506, and 1508 correspond to elements 104, 106, and<br>
108 respectively in Figure 1. Thermoelectric device 1500 also includes<br>
electrical conductors 1510 and 1514 corresponding to electrical conductors<br>
110 and 114 in Figure 1. More information about thermoelectric electric<br>
power generation may be found in CRC Handbook of Thermoelectries, edited<br>
by D. M. Rove, Ph.D., D.Sc., CRC Press, New York, (1995) pp. 479-488 and<br>
in Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics. 2nd Edition, by Adiran Bejan, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1997), pp. 675-682, both of which are hereby<br>
incorporated herein for all purposes.<br>
The present invention has been described primarily with reference to<br>
conically shaped tips, however, other shapes of tips may be utilized as<br>
well, such as, for example, pyramidically shaped tips. In fact, the shape<br>
of the tip does not need to be symmetric or uniform as long as it provides .<br>
a discrete set of substantially pointed tips through which electrical<br>
conduction between the two ends of a thermoelectric cooler may be<br>
provided. The present invention has applications to use in any small<br>
refrigeration application, such as, for example, cooling main frame<br>
computers, thermal management of hot chips and RF communication circuits,<br>
cooling magnetic heads for disk drives, automobile refrigeration, and<br>
cooling optical and laser devices.<br>
The description of the present invention has been presented for<br>
purposes of illustration and description, but is not intended to be<br>
exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed. Many<br>
modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill<br>
