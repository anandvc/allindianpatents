STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR<br>
DEVELOPMENT<br>
This invention was made using funds provided under Grant No. CA 34200 from<br>
the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. government<br>
has certain rights in the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present disclosure relates to certain derivatives of 4-demethylpenclomedine<br>
(also referred to herein as DM-PEN) and especially to thiolo- and thiono-carbonate and<br>
thiocarbamate derivatives of DM-PEN. The present disclosure also relates to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising the disclosed derivatives of 4-<br>
demethylpenclomendine, as well as a method of using the compounds in treating cancer<br>
in a mammal. The present disclosure also relates to a method for producing the disclosed<br>
compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Even though significant advances have occurred in treatment of cancer, it still<br>
remains a major health concern. It has been reported that cancer is the cause of death of<br>
up to one of every four Americans.<br>
Included among the known chemotherapeutic drugs are carmustine, doxorubicin,<br>
methotrexate, TAXOL, nitrogen mustard, procarbazine, and vinblastine, to name only a<br>
few. However, many chemotherapeutic drugs also produce undesirable side effects in the<br>
patient. For example, U.S. Patent 4,717,726 reportedly discloses a compound suitable for<br>
inhibiting the growth of certain types of malignant neoplasms in mammals. See also<br>
Plowman et al., Cancer Res., 49 (1989), 1909-1915. The disclosed compound, 3,5-<br>
dichloro-2,4-dimethoxy-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine, also known as penclomedine, is not<br>
satisfactory as a chemotherapeutic, however, because it is known to produce certain<br>
undesirable side effects especially in the central nervous system.<br><br>
Penclomedine (PEN) was evaluated in Phase I clinical trials at Johns Hopkins<br>
University Oncology Center, the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center<br>
and Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. Hartman et al. Murine and human in vivo<br>
penclomedine metabolism; Clin Cancer Res 2: 953, 1996; O'Reilly et al., Tissue and<br>
tumor distribution of 14C-penclomedine in rats; Clin Cancer Res 2:541; 1996; Berlin et<br>
al., Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic trial of penclomedine using a novel, two-stage<br>
trial design for patients with advanced malignancy; J Clin Oncol 16:1142; 1998; O'Reilly<br>
et al., Phase I and pharmacologic studies of penclomedine, a novel alkylating agent in<br>
patients with solid tumors; J Clin Oncol 15:1974; 1997 and Jodrell et al., Dose-limiting<br>
neurotoxicity in a phase I study of penclomedine (NSC 388720, CRC 88-04), a synthetic<br>
alpha-picoline derivative, administered intravenously; Brit J Cancer 77: 808; 1998) for<br>
possible use in the treatment of breast cancer, based on activity against human breast<br>
tumor xenografts and experimental mammary tumor models. Plowman et al., Preclinical<br>
antitumor activity of an alpha-picoline derivative, penclomedine (NSC 338720), on<br>
human and murine tumors; Cancer Res 49: 1909; 1989; and Harrison et al., Preclinical<br>
antitumor activity of penclomedine in mice; cross-resistance, schedule-dependence, and<br>
oral activity against tumor xenografts in brain; Cancer Res 51: 1979; 1991) and in the<br>
treatment of brain tumors, based on its activity against tumor xenografts in the brain (see<br>
Harrison et al; supra).<br>
In all of these clinical trials, dose-limiting neurotoxicity was observed after both<br>
intravenous and oral administration and was related to peak plasma levels of PEN (see<br>
O'Reilly et al; J. Clin Oncol. 12:1974, supra).<br>
The presence of these toxicities, at much lower peak plasma concentrations<br>
compared to those reported in preclinical studies, may preclude the administration of<br>
higher doses of penclomedine and the achievement of concentrations associated with<br>
optimal antitumor activity. Berlin et al., Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Res., 36,238 (1005);<br>
O'Reilly et al., Proc. Amer. Soc. Clin. Oncol, 14,471 (1995).<br>
Some relevant background art can be found in O'Reilly et al., Clinical Cancer<br>
Research, 2 (March 1996), 541-548. This reference describes a study to assess the<br>
distribution of 14C-penclomedine in the tissues and tumors of tumor-bearing rats. The<br>
study found that the predominant radioactive species in the brain was penclomedine,<br>
which may explain the observed neurotoxicity of the drug.<br>
4-Demethylpenclomedine (DM-PEN) was identified as the major plasma<br>
metabolite in patients and rodents (see Hartman et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2:953, supra and<br><br><br>
O'Reilly et al; Clin Cancer Res. 2:541; supra), and neuroanatomic studies of PEN and<br>
DM-PEN in rats revealed cerebellar damage only in the PEN-treated group (see O'Reilly<br>
et al, The alkylating agent penclomedine induces degeneration of purkinje cells in the rat<br>
cerebellum; Invest New Drugs 21:269; 2003).<br>
3,5-Dichloro-2-methoxy-4-hydroxy-6-(trichloromethyl)pyridine or 4-<br>
demethylpenclomdine has been suggested as a compound for treating cancer. See WO<br>
97/46531 to Hartman et al. Also see Waud et al., 4-Demethylpenclomedine, an antitumor-<br>
active, potentially nonneurotoxic metabolite of penclomedine; Cancer Res, 57:815; 1997.<br>
More recently, a series of acyl derivatives of DM-PEN was prepared and<br>
evaluated against MX-1 tumor xenografts, several other human tumor xenografts and<br>
murine P388 leukemia, revealing potent activity (see Struck et al; Acyl derivatives of<br>
demethylpenclomedine, an antitumor active, nonneurotoxic metabolite of penclomedine,.<br>
Cancer Chemotherap Pharmacol 48:47; 2001; US Patent 6,376,518 to Struck and US<br>
Patent 6,391,893 to Struck et al.).<br>
Notwithstanding the advances in cancer treatment that have been made, there still<br>
remains room for improved drugs that are effective in treating cancer, while at the same<br>
time exhibit reduced adverse side effects.<br>
Summary of Disclosure<br>
The present disclosure relates to novel derivatives of 4-demethylpenclomedine<br>
represented by the following formulae:<br><br>
wherein when X is O then Y is S; and when X is S then Y is O or S;<br>
each of Z1 and Z2 is an alkyl having C1-C12 or aryl having 6-12 carbon atoms in<br>
the ring;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br><br><br>
Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing the above-disclosed compounds. Also disclosed are methods of using the<br>
compounds of the present disclosure in treating cancer in a mammal.<br>
A still further aspect of this disclosure is concerned with a method for preparing<br>
the above-disclosed compounds.<br>
In particular, the present compounds can be produced by reacting 4-<br>
demethylpenclomedine with a compound represented by the formula:<br><br>
Still other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will become readily<br>
apparent by those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein it is<br>
shown and described only the preferred embodiments, simply by way of illustration of the<br>
best mode. As will be realized, the disclosure is capable of other and different<br>
embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious<br>
respects, without departing from the disclosure. Accordingly, the description is to be<br>
regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.<br>
Best and Various Modes<br>
The present disclosure is concerned with novel derivatives of 4-<br>
demethylpenclomedine compounds represented by the formulae:<br><br>
wherein when X is O then Y is S; and when X is S then Y is O or S; and<br><br>
each of Z1 and Z2 is an alkyl group containing 1-12 carbon atoms or aryl group<br>
containing 6-12 carbon atoms in the ring;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The alkyl group more typically contains 1-4 carbon atoms. The alkyl groups may<br>
be substituted with aprotic moieties such as halo (Cl, F, Br, I), O-alkyl, N(alkyl)2, aralkyl<br>
such as benzyl and phenethyl, and heteroaraalkyl containing 1-3 hetero atoms selected<br>
from the group of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups<br>
having 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring portion, such as phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl and<br>
diphenyl groups, each of which may be substituted, as well as heteroaryl groups such as<br>
pyridyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, furyl and thienyl.<br>
Examples of suitable alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl and propyl. Examples of<br>
branched alkyl groups include isopropyl and t-butyl. The aryl group is most especially<br>
phenyl and an alkyl substituted aromatic group such as phenyl C1-3 alkyl and benzyl.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived<br>
from mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric,<br>
nitric and sulfuric acids, and organic acids, such as tartaric, acetic, citric, malic, lactic,<br>
fumaric, benzoic, glycolic, gluconic, succinic, and arylsulfonic, for example p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
It has been found according to the present disclosure that the disclosed compounds<br>
are surprisingly and advantageously useful in treating mammalian cancer, especially<br>
human cancer. The disclosed compounds have been shown to exhibit generally superior<br>
activity in comparison to 4-demethylpenclomedine and penclomedine. Moreover, the<br>
disclosed compounds are believed to possess reduced toxicity in comparison to both<br>
demethylpenclomedine and penclomedine (PEN).<br>
Synthesis of Disclosed Compounds<br>
A general procedure for preparing the above disclosed compounds is as follows:<br>
4-Demethylpenclomedine (DM-PEN) (1g) in 15 ml dry dichloromethane is treated with a<br>
base such as 0.5 ml triethylamine followed by one equivalent of a chlorothiolocarbonate,<br>
a chlorothionocarbonate, a chlorodithiocarbonate or thiocarbamoyl chloride, respectively,<br>
added dropwise at room temperature in 5 ml dry dichloromethane. The solution is stirred<br>
for about 30 min at room temperature and evaporated to dryness via a water aspirator.<br><br><br>
The residue is triturated with 5 ml acetone and filtered to remove triethylamine<br>
hydrochloride. The acetone filtrate is concentrated to 1 ml and separated on an 8 inch, 2<br>
mm silica gel plate containing a fluorescent indicator. The major UV-visible band is<br>
eluted with acetone and the solvent evaporated, giving the respective product in high<br>
yield. Characterization is provided by mass spectrometry, which reveals the appropriate<br>
mass number +1 corresponding to the expected structure, and thin-layer chromatography,<br>
which yields a single UV-visible component. Reaction schemes for preparing exemplary<br>
compounds of this disclosure are shown below.<br><br><br><br>
Antitumor Evaluation in Vivo<br>
Antitumor evaluations are conducted as described previously (see Plowman et al;<br>
supra and Harrison et al; supra). Athymic NCr-nm/nu and CD2F1 mice are obtained and<br>
housed in sterile, filter-capped microisolator cages in a barrier facility. For i.p. injection<br>
into mice, DM-PEN and the various derivatives are prepared as a suspension in aqueous<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose. Tumor fragments (30-40 mg) from in vivo passage are<br>
implanted into the mammary fat pad of the mice.<br>
Treatment of groups of 5 mice each is initiated when the tumors reach<br>
approximately 300 mg in mass and is continued for 5 days for all treatment groups. Each<br>
tumor is measured by caliper in two dimensions twice weekly and converted to tumor<br>
mass. Antitumor activity is assessed on the basis of tumor growth delay in comparison to<br>
a vehicle-treated control, tumor regressions (partial and complete), and tumor-free<br>
survivors, and experiments are terminated when the control tumors attained a size of 1<br>
gram, which is typically 57-61 days. For i.e. implants, 0.03 ml of an MX-1 tumor brei<br>
(containing 106 cells) is implanted into the right hemisphere of the brain of mice.<br>
Treatment of i.e. implants is initiated 1 day after tumor implantation and<br>
continued for 5 days. Mice are monitored daily for survival. Antitumor activity is<br>
assessed on the basis of the percentage increase in lifespan (ILS) in comparison to a<br>
vehicle-treated control, and long-term survivors.<br><br>
Result<br>
Each derivative is evaluated simultaneously with a DM-PEN control against MX-<br>
1 tumor implanted in the mammary fat pad with i.p treatment. A range of dosages of 135,<br>
90 and 60 mg/kg per dose is used, including the maximum tolerated dose. All of the<br>
thiolocarbonate derivatives yield superior activity to DM-PEN and produce one or two of<br>
five tumor-free survivors. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The thionocarbonate and dithiocarbonate derivative, however, yielded only low<br>
activity in this tumor model (data not shown).<br>
The methyl thiolocarbonate derivatives of DM-PEN, (DM-SMTC-PEN), is<br>
evaluated against intracranially-implanted U251 human glioblastoma xenograft and is<br>
observed to be comparably active to the acyl derivatives against this tumor (see Struck et<br>
al., supra), DM-SMTC-PEN is also evaluated against intracranially-implanted D54<br>
human glioblastoma multiforme, a highly resistant brain tumor, and yields an increase in<br>
life span of 18%, a modest response but one not greatly different from that produced by<br>
BCNU, the current drug of choice for clinical treatment of malignant gliomas, the major<br>
brain tumor in the U.S.<br>
The antitumor activity of the thiocarbamates is shown in Table 2. Against MX-1<br>
human mammary tumor xenograft, potent antitumor activity greater than that observed<br>
for DM-PEN is observed for the dimethyl derivative (DM-DMTC-PEN) and the diethyl<br>
derivative (DM-DETC-PEN), with somewhat greater activity being observed for the<br>
dimethyl derivative.<br>
Evaluation of DM-DMTC-PEN against intracranially-implanted U251 human<br>
brain tumor xenograft for comparison of its activity with that of DM-SMTC-PEN in a<br>
side-by-side experiment reveals activity of 44% increase in life span (ILS), which is<br>
slightly inferior to DM-SMTC-PEN, which yields and ILS of 56%, but is identical to that<br>
of the ethyl and phenyl analogs of DM-SMTC-PEN.<br>
A major concern for the penclomedine (PEN) series of derivatives is their possible<br>
neurotoxicity. PEN was removed from clinical development as a potential drug for<br>
treating breast cancer because of its dose-limiting neurotoxicity. Consequently, DM-<br>
SMTC-PEN is evaluated simultaneously with PEN in a behavioral test of neurotoxicity<br>
and is observed to be non-neurotoxic, as indicated by the absence of production of<br>
tremors in the DM-SMTC-PEN group in comparison to the PEN group.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In keeping with the present disclosure, the derivatives of 4-demethylpenclomedine<br>
can be used alone or in appropriate association, and also may be used in combination with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and other pharmaceutically active compounds such<br>
as other cancer treatment drugs. The derivatives of 4-demethylpenclomedine also may be<br>
used as their acid addition salts. The active agent may be present in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition in any suitable quantity.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described herein, for example, vehicles,<br>
adjuvants, excipients, or diluents, are well-known to those who are skilled in the art.<br>
Typically, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is chemically inert to the active<br>
compounds and has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can include polymers and polymer matrices.<br>
The choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular method used to<br>
administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations<br>
of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The following formulations<br>
for oral, aerosol, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, intrathecal, rectal, and vaginal administration are merely exemplary and<br>
are in no way limiting.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions,<br>
such as an effective amount of the compound dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline,<br>
or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granule; (c) powders; (d)<br>
suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations<br>
may include diluents, such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
propylene glycol, glycerin, and the polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the<br>
addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent, or emulsifying<br>
agent. Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard-or soft-shelled gelatin type containing,<br>
for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium<br><br>
phosphate, and corn starch. Tablet forms can include one or more of the following:<br>
lactose, sucrose, mannitol, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, macrocrystalline<br>
cellulose, acacia, gelatin, guar gum, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium,<br>
talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, and other<br>
excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, disintegrating agents, moistening agents,<br>
preservatives, flavoring agents, and pharmacologically compatible carriers. Lozenge<br>
forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or<br>
tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as<br>
gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acadia, emulsions, and gels containing, the addition<br>
to the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and<br>
acadia, emulsions, and gels containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers<br>
as are known in the art.<br>
The derivatives of 4-demethylpenclomedine alone or in combination with other<br>
suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via<br>
inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable<br>
propellants, such as dichlorodifiuoromethane, propane, and nitrogen. They also may be<br>
formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or<br>
an atomizer.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers,<br>
bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the<br>
intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include<br>
suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The<br>
compound can be administered in a physiologically acceptable diluent in a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water,<br>
saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol, glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene<br>
glycol such as poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, glycerol ketals, such as 2,2-dimethyl-l, 3-<br>
dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, an oil, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester or glyceride, or an<br>
acetylated fatty acid glyceride with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin,<br>
carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcelluslose,<br>
or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br><br><br>
Oils, which can be used in parenteral formulations include petroleum, animal,<br>
vegetable, or synthetic oils. Specific examples of oils include peanut, soybean, sesame,<br>
cottonseed, corn, olive, petrolatum, and mineral. Suitable fatty acids for use in parenteral<br>
formulations include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and<br>
isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters. Suitable soaps for use in<br>
parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts,<br>
and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example,<br>
dimethyldialkylammonium halides, and alkylpyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents<br>
such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alky,l olefin, ether, and<br>
monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example,<br>
fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylene polypropylene<br>
copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl ß-aminopropionates,<br>
and 2-aIkylimidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (e) mixtures thereof.<br>
The parenteral formulations typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by<br>
weight of the active ingredient in solution. Suitable preservatives and buffers can be used<br>
in such formulations. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection,<br>
such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-<br>
lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such<br>
formulations ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include<br>
polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high<br>
molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the<br>
condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are also well-known to those who are<br>
skilled in the art. The choice of excipient will be determined in part by the particular<br>
compound, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition.<br>
Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention. The following methods and excipients are merely<br>
exemplary and are in no way limiting. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients<br>
preferably do not interfere with the action of the active ingredients and do not cause<br>
adverse side-effects. Suitable carriers and excipients include solvents such as water,<br>
alcohol, and propylene glycol, solid absorbants and diluents, surface active agents,<br>
suspending agent, tableting binders, lubricants, flavors, and coloring agents.<br>
The formulations can be presented in unit-does or multi-dose sealed containers,<br>
such as ampules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition<br><br><br>
requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for<br>
injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions<br>

One skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of administering a<br>
compound of the present invention to an animal are available, and , although more than<br>
one route can be used to administer a particular compound, a particular route can provide<br>
a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route.<br>
The present disclosure further provides a method of treating cancer in a mammal,<br>
especially humans. The method comprises administering an effective treatment amount<br>
of a derivative of 4-demethylpenclomedine disclosed above to the mammal.<br>
As regards these applications, the present method includes the administration to an<br>
animal, particularly a mammal, and more particularly a human, of a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of the compound effective in the inhibition of neoplasia and tumor<br>
growth.<br>
The disclosed compounds and compositions can be administered to treat a number<br>
of cancers, including leukemias and lymphomas such as acute lymphocytic leukemia,<br>
acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous<br>
leukemia, Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and multiple myeloma,<br>
childhood solid tumors such as brain tumors, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms<br><br><br>
Tumor, bone tumors, and soft-tissue sarcomas, common solid tumors of adults such as<br>
lung cancer, colon and rectum cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, urinary cancers,<br>
uterine cancers, oral cancers, pancreatic cancer, melanoma and other skin cancers,<br>
stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, brain tumors, liver cancer, laryngeal cancer, thyroid<br>
cancer, esophageal cancer, and testicular cancer.<br>
The method disclosed herein is particularly applicable in the treatment of brain,<br>
colon, renal, and mammary tumors, and preferably colon, brain and mammary tumors.<br>
The method can be practiced on mammals, particularly humans.<br>
The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the context of the<br>
present invention should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the animal over a<br>
reasonable time frame. One skilled in the art will recognize that dosage will depend upon<br>
a variety of factors including the condition of the animal, the body weight of the animal,<br>
as well as the severity and stage of the cancer.<br>
A suitable dose is that which will result in a concentration of the active agent in<br>
tumor tissue which is known to effect the desired response. The preferred dosage is the<br>
amount which results in maximum inhibition of cancer, without unmanageable side<br>
effects.<br>
The total amount of the compound of the present disclosure administered in a<br>
typical treatment is preferably between about 60 mg/kg and about 2000 mg/kg of body<br>
weight for mice, and between about 5 mg/kg and about 100 mg/kg of body weight, and<br>
more preferably between 5 mg/kg and about 20 mg/kg of body weight for humans. This<br>
total amount is typically, but not necessarily, administered as a series of smaller doses<br>
over a period of from about one day to about 24 months, and preferably over a period of<br>
28 days to about 12 months.<br>
The size of the dose also will be determined by the route, timing and frequency of<br>
administration as well as the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that<br>
might accompany the administration of the compound and the desired physiological<br>
effect. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that various conditions or disease<br>
states, in particular chronic conditions or disease states, may require prolonged treatment<br>
involving multiple administrations.<br>
The method disclosed comprises further administering of chemotherapeutic agent<br>
other than the derivatives of the present invention. Any suitable chemotherapeutic agent<br>
can be employed for this purpose. The chemotherapeutic agent is typically selected from<br><br><br>
the group consisting of alkylating agents, antimetabolites, natural products, hormonal<br>
agents, and miscellaneous agents.<br>
Examples of alkylating chemotherapeutic agents include carmustine,<br>
