				<td>Field of the Invention;<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for holding a workpiece such as a motorcycle frame or the like while components are being welded to the workpiece, and a method of holding and welding a workpiece using such a work-piece holding apparatus. Description of the Prior Art:<br>
One known auxiliary apparatus used in a process of assembling motorcycles is disclosed in Japanese laid-open utility model publication No. 57-132790.  The disclosed ap¬paratus includes a holder composed of a pair of laterally spaced hands for grippiny a motorcycle frame therebetween. The hands are angularly movable by rotating units to turn the motorcycle frame about transverse and longitudinal axes thereof for thereby changing the attitude of the motorcycle frame through successive angular positions.  While the mo¬torcycle frame is held in each of desired angular positions by the hands, various components are welded to the motorcy¬cle frame.<br>
When the motorcycle frame is supported by the hands, the center of gravity of the motorcycle frame is po¬sitioned above the transverse and longitudinal axes about which the motorcycle frame is swingable by the hands. While<br><br>
components are being welded to the motorcycle frame, the motorcycle frame is subjected to moments about the trans¬verse and longitudinal axes thereof, and hence tends to be¬come unstable. Consequently, it has been difficult to keep the motorcycle frame at an accurate attitude in each of the desired positions, posing certain limitations on the degree of precision with which components are welded to the motor¬cycle frame.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for holding a workpiece highly accu¬rately and stably in any of desired positions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to pro¬vide a method of holding and welding a workpiece with a high degree of precision.<br>
According to the present invention, there is pro¬vided an apparatus for holding a workpiece, comprising a support base, and a swingable mount for holding a workpiece thereon, the swingable mount being supported on the support<br>

base for angular movement aboujt an axis with respect to the<br>
support base, the swingable mount with the workpiece held<br>
i<br>
thereon having a specific gravity positioned slightly lower<br>
j than the vertical position of the axis.<br>
The apparatus further comprises clamping means for<br>
fixing the swingable mount in a selected angular position to<br>
the support base, and a pair of pivot shafts, the support<br>
base and the swingable mount being horizontally elonaate.<br><br>
the swingable mount being supported on the support base by the pivot shafts at longitudinal ends thereof for angular movement about the axis with respect to the support base. The apparatus further comprises a plurality of holder jigs mounted on the swingable mount for holding respective parts of the workpiece. The holder jigs are positioned in respec¬tive locations spaced along the swingable mount.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided an apparatus for holding a workpiece, comprising a support base, a swingable mount angularly movably supported on the support base by a pair of pivot shafts at respective ends of the swingable mount, the pivot shafts being posi¬tioned slightly above the specific gravity of the swingable mount with a workpiece held thereon, and holding means mounted on the swingable mount for holding the workpiece.<br>
The apparatuo further comprises clamping means for fixing the swingable mount in a selected position to the support base. The clamping means may comprise a pair of disks fixedly mounted on the pivot shafts, respectively, and a pair of calipers mounted on the ends of the swingable mount for selectively gripping and releasing the disks, re¬spectively.<br>
The holding means may comprise a plurality of holder jigs mounted on the swingable mount for holding re¬spective parts of the workpiece.<br>
According to the present invention, there is fur¬ther provided a method of welding components to a workpiece<br><br>
held by a swingable mount which is angularly movably supported on a support base, comprising the steps of holding the workpiece with holder jigs on tlie swingable mount which is supported on the support base for angular movement about an axis that is positioned slightly above the specific gravity of the swingable mount with the workpiece held thereon, fixing the swingable mount in a selected angular position to the support base, and welding the components to the workpiece held on the swingable mount fixed in the selected angular position to the support base.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an qjparatus for holding a workpiece, comprising a support base, a swingable mount supported on said support base for holding a workpiece thereon, and holding means mounted on said swingable mount for holding the workpiece; characterized in that said support base and said swingable mount are horizontally elongate in the same direction, said swingable mount being supported on said support base by a pair of pivot shafts at longitudinal ends thereof for angular movement about an axis extending between said pair of pivot shafts, said support base having clamping means for fixing said swingable mount in a selected angular position to said support base, and said swingable mount with the workpiece held thereon having a specific gravity positioned slightly lower than the vertical position of said axis.<br>

Actually, there is a pair of laterally spaced, identi¬cal holder jigs Hi for holding respective upper pipe ends Fi of the upper pipes Ff of the motorcycle frame F.<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 shows a pair of holder jigs 11j, Ilk for holding a bottom plate Fj and a main stand bracket Fk, respectively, of the motorcycle frame F. The holder jigallj, lik comprise respective upper and iower horizontal cylinder units 52, 53 vertically spaced from each other and having respective rods 52a, 53a with respective pins 54, 55 mounted on their distal ends. When the cylinder units 52, 53 are actuated to extend their rods 52a, 53a, the pins 54, 55 are inserted into respective holes defined in the bottom plate Fj and the main stand bracket Fk, with the lower pin 55 being also inserted in a hole 56a defined in a bearing member 56 that is mounted on the swingable mount 2 for sup¬porting the lower end of the main stand bracket Fk. Actu¬ally, there are two laterally spaced pairs of holder jigs<br><br>
11j. Ilk for holding respective bottom plates Fj and respec¬tive main stand brackets Fk of the motorcycle frame F.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a holder jig 11m is mounted on the swingable mount 2 for holding a down tube collar of the motorcycle frame F. A plurality of ejector cylinder units 57, 58, 59 are mounted on the swingable mount 2 near the holder jigs 11j, Ilk, 11m for engaging a down tube assembly of the motorcycle frame F and ejecting the motorcycle frame F off the swingable mount 2 after desired components have been welded to the motorcycle frame F.<br>
The cylinder units of the holder jigs 11a - 11m described above are pneumatically operated, for example. The workpiece holding apparatus is arranged such that the specific gravity of the assembly composed of the swingable mount 2 and the holder jigs 11a ~ 11m with the motorcycle frame r-installad thereon is positioned slightly below the vertical position of the front and rear pivot shafts" 3, 4. Since the front and rear pivot shafts 3, 4 are vertically positioned very closely to the specific gravity of the as¬sembly composed of the swingable mount 2 and the holder jigs 11a - 11m with the motorcycle frame F installed thereon, the assembly can be angularly moved about the front and rear pivot shafts 3, 4 with highly light forces. The assembly and hence the supported motorcycle frame F are stabilized in attitude because they are always subject to recovering forces as the front and rear pivot shafts 3, 4 are verti¬cally positioned slightly above the specific gravity of the<br><br>
assembly. The attitude of the motorcycle frame F held on the swingable mount 2 by the holder jigs 11a ~ 11m is also made stable in any of selected angular positions because of a relatively long distance between the front and rear pivot shafts 3, 4 that are positioned at the longitudinally oppo¬site ends of the motorcycle frame F.<br>
After the assembly has been turned to a desired angular position with respect the support base 1, the assem¬bly is fixed to the desired angular position by the calipers 1,   8, and desired components are welded to the motorcycle frame F.  While the components are welded to the motorcycle frame F, the motorcycle frame F is held stably in the se¬lected angular position by the fixed swingable mount 2 with no undesirable moment imposed thereon.  Inasmuch as the holder jigs 11a - 11m are positioned in locations spaced "'.ongitudir^lly along the swingable mount 2-fcr holding vari¬ous parts of the motorcycle frame F, the holder jigs 11a -11m can hold various parts of the motorcycle frame F even if the parts of the motorcycle frame F are not yet coupled to¬gether.<br>
Although there has been described what is at pre¬sent considered to be the preferred embodiment of the in¬vention, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiment is therefore to be considered in all respects as illustra¬tive, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is<br><br>
indicated by the appended claims rather than by the forego¬ing description.<br><br><br>
