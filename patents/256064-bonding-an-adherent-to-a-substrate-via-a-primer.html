[0001] This invention describes a method for providing increased adhesion between<br>
an adherent and a substrate. The adherent can be a coating layer on the substrate<br>
(including but not limited to a coating layer of an adhesive or a sealant) or can be an<br>
adhesive layer coated on a second substrate to which the first-mentioned substrate is<br>
to be bonded.<br>
[0002] The invention uses a primer layer to increase the adhesion between the<br>
adherent and the substrate. The primer bonds strongly to the substrate and to the<br>
adherent.<br>
[0003] Plasma techniques have been used to pretreat substrate surfaces to improve<br>
the adhesion of a subsequently applied coating. The effects of plasma pre-treatment<br>
can include cleaning, degradation and ablation of the surface regions of a polymeric<br>
substrate, cross-linking of the surface region of a polymer substrate, oxidation leading<br>
to the introduction of polar groups, such as carbonyl groups, into the surface regions<br>
of the substrate, and/or ion implantation in the surface regions of the substrate. WO-<br>
A-02/098962 describes a method of coating a surface of a low energy substrate by<br>
exposing the substrate to a silicon-containing compound and post-treating the treated<br>
surface by oxidation or reduction using a plasma, in particular atmospheric pressure<br>
glow discharge or dielectric barrier discharge, or corona treatment.<br>
[0004] EP-A-431951 describes a system for treating a substrate with the gases<br>
exiting a parallel plate reactor. This comprises flowing a gas through one or more<br>
parallel plate reactors and allowing the excited species to interact with a substrate<br>
placed adjacent to the gas exit. Gherardi, N. et. al., J. Phys D: Appl. Phys, 2000, 33,<br>
L104-L108 describe the production of a silica coating by passing a mixture of N2,<br>
SiH4 and N2 through a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma formed between two<br>
parallel electrodes. The species exiting the reactor were allowed to deposit on a<br>
downstream substrate.<br><br>
[0005] The treatment of several different plastic substrates by injecting<br>
trimethylsilyldimethylamine or hexamethyldisilazane into an argon glow discharge is<br>
described by Inagaki et al. in Int. J. Adhesion Adhesives, 2,233,1982.<br>
[0006] WO-A-02/28548 describes a method for forming a coating on a substrate by<br>
introducing an atomised liquid and/or solid coating-forming material into an<br>
atmospheric pressure plasma discharge and/or an ionised gas stream resulting<br>
therefrom, and exposing the substrate to the atomised coating-forming material under<br>
conditions of atmospheric pressure. WO-A-03/097245 describes a method in which<br>
an atomised coating-forming material, upon leaving an atomiser, passes through an<br>
exciting medium to a substrate positioned remotely from the exciting medium.<br>
[0007] Glow discharge polymerisation of tetramethyldisiloxane has been used to<br>
deposit 30nm thick primer layers on platinum wire prior to coating with a few micron<br>
thick layer of poly(p-xylylene) (Nichols et al., J. Appl. Polymer Sci., Appl. Polymer<br>
Symp,38,21, 1984).<br>
[0008] WO-A-99/20809 describes a method in which a gaseous precursor is<br>
introduced into an arcless atmospheric pressure RF plasma discharge in a gas flowing<br>
from the closed to the open end of an electrically conducting annular chamber<br>
surrounding an electrode so that the precursor reacts with the reactive species in the<br>
plasma to form a material which exits through the open end in a gaseous jet and is<br>
deposited on a substrate placed in the path of the jet. EP 1230414 describes a method<br>
for coating a surface wherein a plasma jet is produced by conveying a working gas<br>
through an excitation zone in which an arc discharge is produced by applying a high<br>
frequency AC voltage to electrodes. A precursor is introduced into the plasma jet<br>
separately from the working gas. A reaction of the precursor is triggered with the aid<br>
of the plasma jet, and the reaction product is deposited on the surface to be coated.<br>
[0009] In a method of bonding an adherent to a substrate according to the invention,<br>
a primer is applied to the substrate by plasma deposition and the adherent is bonded to<br>
the primer treated surface of the substrate, and the primer contains functional groups<br>
which chemically bond to functional groups in the adherent.<br><br>
[0010] The adherent can be a coating layer applied over the primer or can be an<br>
adhesive layer coated on a second substrate to which the first-mentioned substrate is<br>
to be bonded.<br>
[0011] Thus according to one aspect, the invention includes a coated article<br>
comprising a substrate coated with a coating layer applied over a primer,<br>
characterised in that the primer is applied to the substrate by plasma deposition and<br>
the adherent contains functional groups chemically bonded to functional groups in the<br>
primer.<br>
[0012] According to a further aspect, the invention includes a bonded article<br>
comprising two substrates bonded by an adhesive which is applied over a primer on at<br>
least one of the substrates, characterised in that the primer is applied to the substrate<br>
by plasma deposition and the adherent contains functional groups chemically bonded<br>
to functional groups in the primer.<br>
[0013] The plasma which is used for deposition of the primer is preferably a non-<br>
equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma. Such a plasma can for example be<br>
generated within a dielectric housing having an inlet and a plasma outlet through<br>
which a process gas flows from the inlet to the outlet past at least one electrode. The<br>
substrate to be treated can be positioned adjacent to the plasma outlet so that the<br>
substrate is in contact with the plasma, and moved relative to the plasma outlet.<br>
[0014] The primer, or a precursor thereof, is preferably introduced into the plasma-<br>
forming apparatus in atomised form. In one method of atomising the primer, the<br>
process gas and primer are passed through an atomiser in which the process gas<br>
atomises the primer. In another method, the atomised primer is injected into the<br>
plasma downstream from the electrode. The primer may undergo chemical reaction<br>
in the plasma, for example it may be polymerised, provided that at least some of the<br>
functional groups in the primer which react with functional groups in the adherent are<br>
retained.<br><br>
[0015] We have found that that plasma deposition improves the adhesion of the<br>
primer to the substrate. The presence of functional groups in the adherent which<br>
chemically bond to functional groups in the primer improves primer/topcoat adhesion.<br>
The use of atmospheric pressure plasma to deposit the primer has the advantage that it<br>
improves primer adhesion to the substrate without risk of destroying the functional<br>
groups in the primer that are required to improve bonding to the adherent. The<br>
plasma deposited primer can be specifically chosen to form chemical bonds with<br>
components within the adherent. The formulation of the adherent can be tailored to<br>
enhance adhesion at the substrate/adherent interface through chemical bonding to the<br>
primer.<br>

surface according to the invention<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic cross-section of an alternative apparatus for plasma<br>
treating a surface according to the invention<br>
Figure 3 is a diagrammatic cross-section of another alternative apparatus for plasma<br>
treating a surface according to the invention<br>
Figure 4 is a diagrammatic cross-section of an apparatus as shown in Figure 3 with a<br>
longer tube extending from the plasma generating device<br>
[0017] The plasma can in general be any type of non-equilibrium atmospheric<br>
pressure plasma such as a dielectric barrier discharge plasma or a diffuse dielectric<br>
barrier discharge such as a glow discharge plasma. For the purposes of this invention<br>
'plasma deposition' includes deposition by a non-uniform discharge such as a corona<br>
discharge. A diffuse dielectric barrier discharge plasma or glow discharge plasma is<br>
preferred. Preferred processes use "low temperature" plasmas wherein the term "low<br>
temperature" is intended to mean below 200°C, and preferably below 100 °C. These<br>
are plasmas where collisions are relatively infrequent (when compared to thermal<br>
equilibrium plasmas such as flame based systems) which have their constituent species<br>
at widely different temperatures (hence the general name "non-thermal equilibrium"<br>
plasmas).<br><br>
[0018] One preferred device according to the invention for generating a non-<br>
equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma has only a single electrode. Despite the lack<br>
of a counter electrode, the device still gives rise to a non-equilibrium plasma flame.<br>
The presence of a powered electrode in the vicinity of a working gas such as helium is<br>
sufficient to generate a strong RF field which can give rise to a plasma ionisation<br>
process and forms an external plasma jet.<br>
[0019] One example of such a device having only a single electrode is shown in<br>
Figure 1. This design consists of a tube (7), surrounded by a suitable dielectric<br>
material (8). The tube (7) extends beyond the dielectric housing (8). The process gas,<br>
optionally containing an atomized surface treatment agent, enters an opening (6). A<br>
single electrode (5) is placed outside the tube and this is encased in a layer of the<br>
dielectric material (8). The electrode is connected to a suitable power supply. No<br>
counter electrode is required. When power is applied, local electric fields form<br>
around the electrode. These interact with the gas within the tube and a plasma is<br>
formed, which extends to and beyond an aperture (9) at the end of tube (7).<br>
[0020] In an alternative design having improved capability to form nitrogen plasma<br>
jets as well as helium and argon plasma jets, and improved firing of the plasma, a bare<br>
metal electrode is used. A single, preferably sharp, electrode is housed within a<br>
dielectric housing such as a plastic tube through which the process gas and optionally<br>
an aerosol (atomised surface treatment agent) flow. As power is applied to the needle<br>
electrode, an electric field forms and the process gas is ionised.<br>
[0021] This can be better understood by referring to Figure 2. This shows a metal<br>
electrode (12) housed within a suitable chamber (10). This chamber may be<br>
constructed from a suitable dielectric material such as polytetrafluoroethylene<br>
(PTFE). The dielectric housing can be of any electrically non-conductive, e.g.<br>
plastics, material, for example polyamide or polypropylene, as an alternative to PTFE.<br>
The process gas and aerosol enter into the chamber through one or more apertures<br>
(11) in the housing. As an electric potential is applied to the electrode, the process<br>
gas becomes ionised, and the resultant plasma is directed so that it extends out<br>
through an opening (14) of an exit pipe (13). By adjusting the size and shape of the<br><br>
exit pipe (13), the size, shape and length of the low temperature non-equilibrium<br>
atmospheric pressure plasma jet can be adjusted.<br>
[0022] The use of a metal electrode with a sharp point facilitates plasma formation.<br>
As an electric potential is applied to the electrode, an electric field is generated which<br>
accelerates charged particles in the gas forming a plasma. The sharp point aids the<br>
process, as the electric field density is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature<br>
of the electrode. The electrode can also give rise to a leakage of electrons into the gas<br>
due to the high secondary electron emission coefficient of the metal. As the process<br>
gas moves past the electrode, the plasma species are carried away from the electrode<br>
to form a plasma jet.<br>
[0023] In a still further embodiment of the present invention the plasma jet device<br>
consists of a single hollow electrode, without any counter electrode. A gas is blown<br>
through the centre of the electrode. RF power is applied and this leads to the<br>
formation of strong electro-magnetic fields in the vicinity of the electrode. This<br>
causes the gas to ionise and a plasma forms which is carried through the electrode and<br>
exits as a plasma jet. The narrow nature of this design allows for focussed, narrow<br>
plasmas to be generated under ambient conditions for depositing functional coatings<br>
on a three-dimensionally shaped substrate.<br>
[0024] More generally, the electrode or electrodes can take the form of pins, plates,<br>
concentric tubes or rings, or needles via which gas can be introduced into the<br>
apparatus. A single electrode can be used, or a plurality of electrodes can be used.<br>
The electrodes can be covered by a dielectric, or not covered by a dielectric. If<br>
multiple electrodes are used, they can be a combination of dielectric covered and non-<br>
covered electrodes. One electrode can be grounded or alternatively no electrodes are<br>
grounded (floating potential). If no electrodes are grounded, the electrodes can have<br>
the same polarity or can have opposing polarity. A co-axial electrode configuration<br>
can be used in which a first electrode is placed co-axially inside a second electrode.<br>
One electrode is powered and the other may be grounded, and dielectric layers can be<br>
included to prevent arcing, but this configuration is less preferred.<br><br>
[0025] The electrode may be made of any suitable metal and can for example be in<br>
the form of a metal pin e.g. a welding rod, or a flat section. Electrodes can be coated<br>
or incorporate a radioactive element to enhance ionisation of the plasma. A<br>
radioactive metal may be used, for example the electrode can be formed from<br>
tungsten containing 0.2 to 20% by weight, preferably about 2%, radioactive thorium.<br>
This promotes plasma formation through the release of radioactive particles and<br>
radiation which can initiate ionisation. Such a doped electrode provides more<br>
efficient secondary electron emission and therefore device is easy to strike.<br>
[0026] The power supply to the electrode or electrodes is a radio frequency power<br>
supply as known for plasma generation, that is in the range 1kHz to 300GHz. Our<br>
most preferred range is the very low frequency (VLF) 3kHz - 30 kHz band, although<br>
the low frequency (LF) 30kHz - 300 kHz range can also be used successfully. One<br>
suitable power supply is the Haiden Laboratories Inc. PHF-2K unit which is a bipolar<br>
pulse wave, high frequency and high voltage generator. It has a faster rise and fall<br>
time (
it offers better ion generation and greater process efficiency. The frequency of the<br>
unit is also variable (1 - 100 kHz) to match the plasma system. The voltage of the<br>
power supply is preferably at least 1kV up to 10kV or more.<br>
[0027] In general the process gas used to produce the plasma can be selected from a<br>
range of process gases, including helium, argon, oxygen, nitrogen, air, carbon dioxide,<br>
nitrous oxide and mixtures of said gases with each other or with other materials. Most<br>
preferably the process gas comprises an inert gas substantially consisting of helium,<br>
argon and/or nitrogen, that is to say comprising at least 90% by volume, preferably at<br>
least 95%, of one of these gases or a mixture of two or more of them.<br>
[0028] The primer or a precursor of the primer is introduced into the plasma-<br>
forming apparatus in atomized form. The atomised primer can for example be a<br>
polymerisable precursor. When a polymerisable precursor is introduced into the<br>
plasma jet, preferably as an aerosol, a controlled plasma polymerisation reaction<br>
occurs which results in the deposition of a plasma polymer on any substrate which is<br>
placed adjacent to the plasma outlet. Using the process of the invention, a range of<br><br>
primer coatings have been deposited onto numerous substrates. These coatings are<br>
grafted to the substrate and retain the functional chemistry of the primer precursor<br>
molecule.<br>
[0029] The atomiser preferably uses a gas to atomise the surface treatment agent.<br>
The electrode(s) can be combined with the atomiser within the housing. Most<br>
preferably, the process gas used for generating the plasma is used as the atomizing gas<br>
to atomise the surface treatment agent. The atomizer can for example be a pneumatic<br>
nebuliser, particularly a parallel path nebuliser such as that sold by Burgener Research<br>
Inc.of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, or that described in US Patent 6634572, or it can<br>
be a concentric gas atomizer. The atomizer can alternatively be an ultrasonic<br>
atomizer in which a pump is used to transport the liquid surface treatment agent into<br>
an ultrasonic nozzle and subsequently it forms a liquid film onto an atomising surface.<br>
Ultrasonic sound waves cause standing waves to be formed in the liquid film, which<br>
result in droplets being formed. The atomiser preferably produces drop sizes of from<br>
10 to 100 µm, more preferably from 10 to 50µm. Suitable atomisers for use in the<br>
present invention are ultrasonic nozzles from Sono-Tek Corporation, Milton, New<br>
York, USA. Alternative atomisers may include for example electrospray techniques,<br>
methods of generating a very fine liquid aerosol through electrostatic charging. The<br>
most common electrospray apparatus employs a sharply pointed hollow metal tube,<br>
with liquid pumped through the tube. A high-voltage power supply is connected to<br>
the outlet of the tube. When the power supply is turned on and adjusted for the proper<br>
voltage, the liquid being pumped through the tube transforms into a fine continuous<br>
mist of droplets. Inkjet technology can also be used to generate liquid droplets<br>
without the need of a carrier gas, using thermal, piezoelectric, electrostatic and<br>
acoustic methods.<br>
[0030] Thus the process gas fed through inlet (6) of Figure 1 or through inlet (11) of<br>
Figure 2 can contain the primer or primer precursor in atomised form. This can be<br>
achieved either by using the process gas as the atomising gas in at atomiser feeding<br>
the inlet or by combining the process gas stream with an atomised primer. In an<br>
alternative arrangement to that shown in figure 1, an electrode is positioned on either<br>
side of an atomiser which acts as the inlet for the process gas and for the primer. The<br><br>
electrodes can for example both extend beyond the tip of the atomiser. In such an<br>
arrangement, the electrodes preferably have the same polarity.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment of the invention the electrode is combined with the<br>
atomizer in such a way that the atomizer acts as the electrode. For example, if a<br>
parallel path atomizer is made of conductive material, the entire atomizer device can<br>
be used as an electrode. Alternatively a conductive component such as a needle can<br>
be incorporated into a non-conductive atomizer to form the combined electrode-<br>
atomiser system.<br>
[0032] Figure 3 shows a modified version of the pin type electrode system shown in<br>
Figure 2. In Figure 3, the process gas enters upstream (15) of the plasma. An<br>
atomised primer can be incorporated in the flow of process gas (15). Alternatively,<br>
the aerosol of atomised primer can be introduced directly into the plasma. This is<br>
achieved by having a second gas entry point (16) located close to the tip of the<br>
electrode (17). The aerosol of atomised primer can be added directly at this point<br>
(16), with the main process gas still entering upstream of the plasma region (15).<br>
Alternatively, some of the process gas can also be added with the aerosol adjacent to<br>
the tip of the electrode. Using this setup, the plasma and precursor exit though a<br>
suitable tube (18) extending from the outlet of the<br>
dielectric housing surrounding the electrode (17). The gas entry point (16) is<br>
preferably an inlet angled towards the outlet (18) of the housing.<br>
[0033] The tube (18) extends the plasma jet, for example up to 300mm from the tip<br>
of the electrode (17). The tube (18) is formed at least partly of dielectric material<br>
such as plastics, for example polyamide, polypropylene or PTFE. The tube is<br>
preferably flexible so that the plasma outlet can be moved relative to the substrate. In<br>
order to stabilise the plasma jet over lengths greater than 300mm., it is beneficial to<br>
use conductive cylinders, preferably with sharp edges, to connect adjacent pieces of<br>
pipe. These cylinders are preferably not grounded. Preferably, these rings have a<br>
round sharp edge on both sides. As it passes inside these metal cylinders, the process<br>
gas is in contact with metal. The free electrons created inside the plasma region<br>
induce a strong electric field near sharp conductive edges that ionize further the<br><br>
process gas inside the pipe. The sharp edge on the other side of the cylinder creates a<br>
strong electric field that initiates the ionization of the gas in the following pipe<br>
section. In this way the plasma inside the pipe is extended. Use of multiple metal<br>
connectors enables the plasma to be extended over several metres, for example 3 to 7<br>
metres.<br>
[0034] Figure 4 shows a modified device of the type shown in Figure 3 which<br>
generates long plasmas for the treatment of conducting substrates or of the inside of 3-<br>
d objects or tubes. As in Figure 3, a powered electrode (19) interacts with a process<br>
gas (20) and aerosol (21) of atomised primer to produce a plasma. The length of the<br>
plasma jet is extended by confining the plasma to a tube (22) as it leaves the device.<br>
As long as the plasma is confined within this tube, then the plasma is not quenched by<br>
interaction with the external atmosphere. In order to further extend the plasma length,<br>
conductive pieces (23) are incorporated into the tube (22) to connect adjacent pieces<br>
of the tube. The conductive metal rings (23) have a round sharp edge on both sides.<br>
The resulting plasma may be extended over a considerable distance before exiting<br>
through plasma outlet (24) and depositing the primer on a substrate adjacent to the<br>
plasma outlet (24).<br>
[0035] The substrate which is to be primer coated is positioned adjacent to the<br>
plasma outlet so that the substrate is in contact with the plasma and is moved relative<br>
to the plasma outlet. For example the substrate can be moved past the plasma outlet<br>
or the plasma outlet can be moved across the substrate surface, particularly if a<br>
flexible tube is used to extend the plasma.<br>
[0036] An alternative embodiment of the current invention uses diffuse dielectric<br>
barrier discharge plasma generating apparatus in which the plasma is generated<br>
between a pair of electrodes as described in WO 02/28548, wherein liquid based<br>
polymer precursors are introduced as an aerosol into an atmospheric plasma discharge<br>
or the excited species therefrom. For typical diffuse dielectric barrier discharge<br>
plasma generating apparatus, the homogeneous plasma is generated between a pair of<br>
electrodes within a gap of from 3 to 50mm, for example 5 to 25mm. The generation<br>
of steady-state homogeneous diffuse dielectric barrier discharge such as glow<br><br>
discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure is preferably obtained between adjacent<br>
electrodes that may be spaced up to 5 cm apart, dependent on the process gas used.<br>
The electrodes are radio frequency energised with a root mean square (rms) potential<br>
of 1 to 100 kV, preferably between 1 and 30 kV at 1 to 100 kHz, preferably at 15 to<br>
50 kHz. The voltage used to form the plasma will typically be between 1 and 30 kVolts,<br>
most preferably between 2.5 and 10 kV however the actual value will depend on the<br>
choice of process gas and on the plasma region size between the electrodes. When the<br>
plasma is generated between a pair of electrodes in this manner, the substrate is<br>
preferably transported through the plasma, that is to say through the gap between the<br>
electrodes, as described in WO 02/28548.<br>
[0037] Any suitable electrode systems may be utilised. Each electrode may<br>
comprise a metal plate or metal gauze or the like retained in a dielectric material or<br>
may, for example, be of the type described in WO 02/35576 wherein there are<br>
provided electrode units containing an electrode and an adjacent a dielectric plate and<br>
a cooling liquid distribution system for directing a cooling conductive liquid onto the<br>
exterior of the electrode to cover a planar face of the electrode. Each electrode unit<br>
comprises a watertight box having one side in the form of a dielectric plate to which a<br>
metal plate or gauze electrode is attached on the inside of the box. There is also a<br>
liquid inlet and a liquid outlet fitted to a liquid distribution system comprising a cooler<br>
and a recirculation pump and/ or a sparge pipe incorporating spray nozzles. The<br>
cooling liquid covers the face of the electrode remote from the dielectric plate. The<br>
cooling conductive liquid is preferably water and may contain conductivity<br>
controlling compounds such as metal salts or soluble organic additives. Ideally, the<br>
electrode is a metal plate or mesh electrode in contact with the dielectric plate. The<br>
dielectric plate extends beyond the perimeter of the electrode and the cooling liquid is<br>
also directed across the dielectric plate to cover at least that portion of dielectric<br>
bordering the periphery of the electrode. Preferably, all the dielectric plate is covered<br>
with cooling liquid. The water acts to electrically passivate any boundaries,<br>
singularities or non-uniformity in the metal electrodes such as edges, corners or mesh<br>
ends where the wire mesh electrodes are used.<br><br>
[0038] In another alternative electrode system each electrode may be of the type<br>
described in WO 2004/068916, wherein each electrode comprises a housing having an<br>
inner and outer wall, wherein at least the inner wall is formed from a dielectric<br>
material, and which housing contains an at least substantially non-metallic electrically<br>
conductive material in direct contact with the inner wall instead of the "traditional"<br>
metal plate or mesh. Examples of suitable dielectric material include but are not<br>
restricted to polycarbonate, polyethylene, glass, glass laminates and epoxy filled glass<br>
laminates. Preferably, the dielectric has sufficient strength in order to prevent any<br>
bowing or disfigurement of the dielectric by the conductive material in the electrode.<br>
Preferably the dielectric used has a thickness of up to 50mm, most preferably 15 to<br>
30mm. In instances where the selected dielectric is not sufficiently transparent, a<br>
glass or the like window may be utilized to enable diagnostic viewing of the generated<br>
plasma.<br>
[0039] The electrodes may be spaced apart by means of a spacer or the like, which is<br>
preferably also made from a dielectric material which thereby effects an increase in<br>
the overall dielectric strength of the system by eliminating any potential for discharge<br>
between the edges of the conductive liquid.<br>
[0040] The substantially non-metallic electrically conductive material may be a<br>
liquid such as a polar solvent for example water, alcohol and/or glycols or aqueous<br>
salt solutions and mixtures thereof, but is preferably an aqueous salt solution. When<br>
water is used alone, it preferably comprises tap water or mineral water. Preferably,<br>
the water contains up to a maximum of about 25% by weight of a water-soluble salt<br>
such as an alkali metal salt, for example sodium or potassium chloride or alkaline<br>
earth metal salts. This is because the conductive material present in such an electrode<br>
has substantially perfect conformity and thereby a perfectly homogeneous surface<br>
potential at the dielectric surface.<br>
[0041] Alternatively, the substantially non-metallic electrically conductive material<br>
may be in the form of one or more conductive polymer compositions, which may<br>
typically be supplied in the form of pastes. Such pastes are currently used in the<br>
electronics industry for the adhesion and thermal management of electronic<br><br>
components, such as microprocessor chip sets. These pastes typically have sufficient<br>
mobility to flow and conform to surface irregularities. Suitable polymers for the<br>
conductive polymer compositions may include silicones, polyoxypolyolefin<br>
elastomers, a hot melt based on a wax such as a silicone wax, resin/polymer blends,<br>
silicone polyamide copolymers or other silicone-organic copolymers or the like or<br>
epoxy, polyimide, acrylate, urethane or isocyanate based polymers. The polymers<br>
will typically contain conductive particles, typically of silver but alternative<br>
conductive particles might be used including gold, nickel, copper, assorted metal<br>
oxides and/or carbon including carbon nanotubes; or metallised glass or ceramic<br>
beads. Specific examples of conductive polymer compositions which might be used<br>
include the conductive polymer described in EP 240648 or silver filled<br>
organopolysiloxane based compositions such as Dow Corning® DA 6523, Dow<br>
Corning® DA 6524, Dow Corning® DA 6526 BD, and Dow Corning® DA 6533 sold<br>
by Dow Corning Corporation or silver filled epoxy based polymers such as<br>
Ablebond® 8175 from (Ablestik Electronic Materials &amp; Adhesives) Epo-Tek® H20E-<br>
PFC or Epo-Tek® E30 (Epoxy Technology Inc).<br>
[0042] One example of the type of atmospheric pressure plasma assembly which<br>
might be used in accordance with the present invention comprises a first and second<br>
pair of parallel spaced-apart electrodes, the spacing between inner plates of each pair of<br>
electrodes forming a first and second plasma zone. Such an assembly further comprises<br>
a means of transporting a substrate successively through said first and second plasma<br>
zones and an atomiser adapted to introduce an atomised liquid or solid coating making<br>
material into one of said first or second plasma zones, and is described in the applicant's<br>
co-pending application WO 03/086031.which is incorporated herein by reference. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the electrodes are vertically arrayed.<br>
[0043] The primer can alternatively be applied to the substrate by plasma enhanced<br>
chemical vapour deposition (PE-CVD). Chemical Vapour Deposition is the<br>
deposition of a solid on a heated substrate from a chemical reaction in the vapour<br>
phase near or on the heated substrate. The chemical reactions that take place may<br>
include thermal decomposition, oxidation, carburisation and nitridation. Typically the<br>
sequence of events for a CVD reaction comprises the following sequentially:-<br><br>
i) Introduction of reactant gases into a reactor by appropriate introduction<br>
means e.g. forced flow,<br>
ii) diffusion of the gases through the reactor towards a substrate surface<br>
iii) contact of gases with substrate surface<br>
iv) chemical reaction takes place between gases and/or one or more gases and<br>
the substrate surface<br>
v) desorption and diffusion away from substrate surface of reaction by-<br>
products.<br>
[0044] In the case of PE-CVD the gases are directed so as to diffuse through plasma.<br>
Any appropriate plasma may be utilised. Non-thermal equilibrium plasmas processes<br>
are ideal for the coating of substrates in the form of delicate and heat sensitive<br>
webbed materials because generally the resulting coatings are free of micropores even<br>
with thin layers. Primer coatings deposited by PE-CVD adhere well to even non-<br>
polar materials, e.g. polyethylene, as well as steel, textiles, etc. Non-thermal<br>
equilibrium plasma such as for example glow discharge plasma may be utilised. The<br>
glow discharge may be generated at low pressure, i.e. vacuum glow discharge or in<br>
the vicinity of atmospheric pressure - atmospheric pressure glow discharge, which is<br>
preferred.<br>
[0045] The substrate may undergo surface pre-treatment prior to the plasma<br>
deposition of the primer. Surface treatment can remove contaminants or weak<br>
boundary layers, modify the surface energy of the substrate and/or change the surface<br>
topography. Examples of contaminants are oils and greases on metals, weak or loose<br>
oxides on metals, mould-release agents such as silicones, fluorocarbons and waxes on<br>
polymers and additives and low molecular weight material on the surfaces of<br>
polymers, which have migrated from the bulk to the surface. Surface pre-treatment<br>
can for example be by a plasma technique such as a corona discharge or a plasma<br>
flame or by a non-thermal equilibrium plasma such as an atmospheric pressure<br>
plasma.<br>
[0046] The plasma deposited primer contains functional groups which chemically<br>
bond to functional groups in the adherent. One example of functional groups which<br><br>
chemically bond is a hydrosilylation cured silicone, between components having<br>
silicon bonded hydrogen groups and other components comprising ethylenically<br>
unsaturated groups, typically silicon bonded alkenyl groups. An adherent comprising<br>
ethylenically unsaturated groups can be adhered to a substrate plasma coated with a<br>
primer that provides an Si-H functional surface on the substrate. Through a<br>
hydrosilylation curing reaction, typically catalysed using a platinum group metal<br>
based catalyst, bonding will occur at the interface via interaction between the Si-H<br>
functional groups of the primer and the free vinyl-functional groups in the adherent<br>
silicone formulation. The adhesion promoting, functional plasma polymer primer is<br>
designed is such a way as to form specific chemical bonds between the substrate and<br>
the adherent coating.<br>
[0047] The platinum group metal of the catalyst is preferably selected from<br>
platinum, rhodium, iridium, palladium or ruthenium. Platinum group metal<br>
containing catalysts useful to catalyse curing of the present compositions can be any<br>
of those known to catalyse reactions of silicon bonded hydrogen atoms with silicon<br>
bonded alkenyl groups and can be present as platinum group metal or a compound or<br>
complex thereof. The preferred platinum group metal for use as a catalyst is<br>
platinum. Some preferred platinum based hydrosilation catalysts include<br>
chloroplatinic acid, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, platinum dichloride, and<br>
complexes of such compounds containing low molecular weight vinyl containing<br>
organosiloxanes.<br>
[0048] Typical silicone coating compositions based on hydrosilylation cure have a<br>
stoichiometrically matched level of Si-H and Si-vinyl components to provide a fully<br>
cured product. Although such a stoichiometrically matched composition can be used<br>
as the adherent, the interfacial reaction between the primer and the adherent is in<br>
competition with the curing reaction in the bulk adherent. The adherent can<br>
preferably be formulated with an excess of Si-vinyl functional components so that<br>
chemical bonding can occur at the primer/adherent interface without detriment to<br>
curing in the bulk of the adherent. Thus, the Si-vinyl "rich" adherent formulation in<br>
combination with the Si-H functional plasma polymer primer enables increased<br>
chemical bonding and increased cross-linking at the primer/adherent interface, which<br><br>
leads to enhanced adhesive bonding. The adherent is designed in such a way as to<br>
form specific chemical bonds between the primer and the adherent. The cured coating<br>
produced by such a coating process is a flexible non-stick coating adhering strongly to<br>
the substrate, for example to a flexible substrate such as plastics film , paper or a<br>
textile material; or a rigid substrate such as metal, glass, or a plastic extruded part.<br>
[0049] In another example, the functional groups present in the primer are Si-OH or<br>
Si-OR groups. These can be used in conjunction with an organopolysiloxane<br>
adherent having acyloxy groups, for example acetoxy groups, bonded to silicon or<br>
having oxime groups bonded to silicon. Compositions containing Si-OH groups and<br>
Si-bonded acetoxy or oxime groups are known as room temperature vulcanisable<br>
sealants. The organopolysiloxane adherent having acyloxy groups or oxime groups<br>
bonded to silicon can be used to bond two substrates, at least one of which has been<br>
treated according to the invention with a plasma deposited primer having Si-OH or Si-<br>
OR groups. A first substrate treated according to the invention with the plasma<br>
deposited primer can be bonded to the organopolysiloxane adherent coated on a<br>
second substrate, which may or may not have been treated according to the invention<br>
with a plasma deposited primer. The organopolysiloxane adherent may optionally<br>
contain a catalyst such as an organo metal compound, for example stannous octoate or<br>
dibutyltin dilaurate, or a titanium chelate.<br>
[0050] In a further example, the functional groups present in the primer are primary<br>
or secondary amine groups and/or alcohol groups and the adherent is a polymer<br>
containing epoxide groups. The amine groups are preferably primary amine groups<br>
R-NH2 or form part of aminoalcohol groups such as R-NH-CH2-CH-OH. Alcohol<br>
groups present in the primer are preferably activated by adjacent groups as in beta-<br>
hydroxyamines. The epoxide-functional polymer preferably contains glycidyl groups<br>
and can for example be an epoxy resin derived from a bisphenol or polyphenol or an<br>
epoxide-functional acrylic resin. An epoxy adherent can be used to bond two<br>
substrates, at least one of which has been treated according to the invention with a<br>
plasma deposited primer having R-NH2 or R-NH-CH2-CH-OH groups. Alternatively<br>
a substrate which has been treated according to the invention with a plasma deposited<br><br>
primer having R-NH2 or R-NH-CH2-CH-OH groups can be coated with an epoxide-<br>
functional coating as adherent.<br>
[0051] In an alternative, a primer containing glycidoxy groups can be applied to a<br>
substrate by plasma deposition and coated with an adherent containing primary or<br>
secondary amine groups and/or activated alcohol groups.<br>
[0052] In a further example, the functional groups present in the primer are methylol<br>
groups, particularly methylol groups in which the alcohol is activated such as N-<br>
methylol groups. The adherent may contain hydroxyl groups which are reactive with<br>
the N-methylol groups, for example the adherent can be a hydroxy-functional<br>
polyester or polyether coating composition.<br>
[0053] In a further example, the functional groups present in the primer are<br>
isocyanate groups R-NCO or blocked isocyanate groups. The adherent can contain<br>
hydroxyl and/or amine groups, for example the adherent can be a hydroxy-functional<br>
polyester or polyether or polyurethane prepolymer. Such an adherent can form a<br>
polyurethane coating or can be a polyurethane adhesive used to bond two substrates,<br>
at least one of which has been treated according to the invention with a plasma<br>
deposited primer having isocyanate or blocked isocyanate groups.<br>
[0054] In an alternative, a primer containing hydroxyl and/or amine groups can be<br>
applied to a substrate by plasma deposition and coated with an adherent containing<br>
isocyanate or blocked isocyanate groups, for example an isocyanate-functional<br>
polyurethane prepolymer, which can be utilised as a coating or as an adhesive to bond<br>
two substrates.<br>
[0055] A primer containing hydroxyl and/or amine groups applied to a substrate by<br>
plasma deposition can alternatively be coated with a phenolic resin adhesive as<br>
adherent.<br><br>
[0056] In a further example, the functional groups present in the primer are hydroxyl<br>
groups, for example alcohol groups, and the adherent is a cyanoacrylate. Such<br>
systems find particular use as adhesives for bonding two substrates.<br>
[0057] In a further example, the functional groups present in the primer are amino<br>
groups and the adherent is a polyimide resin or a bismaleimide resin. The primer can<br>
for example be an aminosilane such as aminopropyl triethoxy silane or<br>
aminoethylaminopropyl trimethoxy silane.<br>
[0058] In a further example, the functional groups present in the primer are epoxy<br>
groups, for example glycidyl groups and the adherent is a polysulfide rubber.<br>
[0059] The primer can alternatively be a coupling agent. Coupling agents are well<br>
described by E.P. Plueddemann in "Silanes and Other Coupling Agents" (Ed K.<br>
Mittal, VSP Utrecht, 1992), and are multifunctional compounds designed to provide a<br>
means for chemically coupling to both the inorganic surface and to the organic<br>
adhesive or coating. These compounds conventionally applied directly to the<br>
substrate from dilute solution or may be compounded into an adhesive or coating to<br>
generate a self-priming formulation. Such self-priming formulations often require a<br>
specific bonding or curing method and/or protocol to ensure that the coupling agent is<br>
present at the adhesive or coating/substrate interface.<br>
[0060] Types of coupling agent include, but are not limited to, silanes, orthosilicates,<br>
other orthoesters, chromium complexes, titanates, thiols and related compounds co-<br>
polymers. Thus the process of the invention can for example comprise applying by<br>
atmospheric pressure plasma deposition a silane coupling agent containing a<br>
substituent functional group which chemically bonds to functional groups in the<br>
adherent.<br>
[0061] Silane based coupling agents may include silanes with the following<br>
functionality: vinyl, chloropropyl, epoxy, methacrylate, primary amine, diamine,<br>
mercapto, sulphide or cationic styryl. The primer coupling agent can comprise a<br>
mixture of silanes such as C6H5Si(OMe)3 and diamine functional silane. The primer<br><br>
can alternatively comprise a mixture of a resin primer and a coupling agent, for<br>
example a melamine resin and an epoxy functional silane can be used as primer for an<br>
adherent containing amine and/or hydroxy 1 groups.<br>
[0062] Silane coupling agents containing mercapto and/or sulphide groups, for<br>
example, are particularly useful as primer treatments to be plasma deposited when the<br>
adherent is a sulphur-curable rubber composition based for example on natural rubber<br>
or a diene rubber.	Examples of such coupling agents are<br>
bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide, bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)disulfide and 3-<br>
mercaptopropyl triethoxy silane.<br>
[0063] Various inorganic esters have been claimed as coupling agents for reinforced<br>
plastics and may be used as primers in the process of the invention, including<br>
aminobenzyl phosphorates, dicetylisopropylborate, chrome complexes such as<br>
{CH2=C(Me)COO}Cr(OH)Cl2.H2O.ROH} and alkoxy compounds of aluminium,<br>
zirconium and titanium such as {CH2=C(Me)COO}3TiOCH(Me) as well as<br>
zirconates and zircoaluminates such as HO(Al/Zr)RCOOH.. Methacrylate additives<br>
having functional groups such as COOH, CH2CH2OH, CONH2, glycidyl,<br>
CH2CH(OH)CH2OPO(OH)2, (CH2)3Si(OMe)3, CH2CHClCH2OSiCl3, or<br>
CH2CH2OSi(OMe)3 can also used as coupling agents to improve adhesion.<br>
[0064] Substrates which may be primer treated by plasma deposition and coated<br>
with an adherent according to the invention include but are not limited to metals,<br>
including aluminium, steel, and titanium, engineering plastics, including polystyrene,<br>
polycarbonate, polyurethane, polypropylene, polyethylene and polyamide, rubbers<br>
and elastomers, glass, ceramic materials, clays and minerals, textiles and leather, or<br>
composites, including but not limited to glass fibre, carbon fibre, polypropylene fibre<br>
and aramid fibre composite materials .<br>
[0065] Adherents which are coatings can be applied to the primed substrate by any<br>
conventional coating technique. The adherent can be applied by plasma deposition<br>
similarly to the primer, but this is generally not necessary. The adherent can for<br>
example be applied by spraying, brushing, roller coating, knife over roller coating,<br><br>
extrusion coating, curtain coating, injection moulding, adhesive and sealant manual<br>
and automated dispensing systems or powder coating. The adherent can if required be<br>
applied from a diluent, for example from a solution or an emulsion<br>
[0066] The invention can be used in a wide variety of applications including but not<br>
limited to applying decorative or corrosion protection coatings or anti-adherent or<br>
biocompatible coatings, for example in coating medical devices such as devices to be<br>
implanted including drug delivery devices, catheters, electrical leads and cochlear<br>
implants. The invention can be used to form seals on pace-makers and neuro-<br>
stimulators. The invention can be used to apply coatings or adhesives to electronic<br>
devices, printed circuit boards (PCBs), logic devices, biosensors and chemical<br>
sensors, MEMS, Lab-on-chip and nanomachines, automotive components such as<br>
sensors and electronics, gaskets and sealing, aerospace, aeronautic and marine<br>
components and constructions, pumping systems and their components or consumer<br>
electronics or for assembly and/or sealing of display devices. The invention can be<br>
used to bond construction materials and items such as glazing units, including<br>
structural, architectural and multiple glazing units, and solar cells and panels. Any of<br>
the adhesive systems described can be rubber toughened for use with construction<br>
materials. The invention can be used to bond or coat footwear, clothing and<br>
leisurewear, jewellery or sports goods and equipment, or to coat packaging or airbags,<br>
or for lamination of polymer films to steel substrates.<br>
[0067] In addition to the advantage of improved adhesion by the adherent (coating<br>
or adhesive) to a wide range of substrates, the process of the invention using a plasma<br>
polymerised primer can give additional benefits. It may allow adhesion to substrates<br>
that usually inhibit curing of the adherent. . For example, amine groups present in<br>
polyamide or polyurethane surfaces inhibit cure of silicone coating systems<br>
comprising a polysiloxane having Si-H groups, a polysiloxane having vinyl groups<br>
and a platinum catalyst due to "poisoning" of the catalyst. Application of the coating<br>
system as a plasma polymerised primer followed by an adherent prevents such<br>
inhibition. One example of this inhibition was a leather substrate. Without<br>
application of a primer containing Si-H groups, an adhesive comprising a<br><br>
polysiloxane having Si-H groups, a polysiloxane having vinyl groups and a platinum<br>
catalyst did not cure. With a plasma deposited primer the adhesive cured.<br>
[0068] If desired, an adherent can be formulated so that it requires the surface<br>
functional groups in the primer to give strong adhesion, that is to say so that it has<br>
little adhesion unless applied over the primer.<br>
[0069] Depositing a primer layer that comprises a coupling agent by atmospheric<br>
pressure plasma deposition has a number of advantages. The first is that adhesives<br>
that do not traditionally contain coupling agents can be used in different applications<br>
that were not possible due to levels of adhesion required. Deposition by the<br>
atmospheric pressure plasma process can be achieved without the need of solvent (an<br>
environmental advantage) or careful control of pH. A further advantage is that<br>
coupling agents can be removed from the adhesive formulation. The addition of<br>
coupling agents to an adhesive formulation can have an adverse impact on rheology<br>
of the adhesive. Removing the coupling agent from the adherent and applying it<br>
separately as a primer allows more flexibility in adhesive processing. Formulations<br>
that contain coupling agents often require a high cure temperature to<br>
thermodynamically drive the coupling agent to the substrate-adhesive interface. By<br>
removing the coupling agent from the adherent and applying it separately as a primer<br>
cure temperature cycles can be reduced.<br>
[0070] The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0071] Polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane primer was deposited onto a stainless steel<br>
sheet substrates using an atmospheric pressure plasma assembly of the type shown in<br>
Fig.3. The substrate to be coated placed adjacent to the plasma outlet (18). Process<br>
gas, either helium or argon, was introduced through inlet (15). The plasma was<br>
generated by applying RF power (30-60W, 29 kHz) to the electrode (17). The<br>
polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane was introduced in an atomised liquid form through inlet<br>
(16) at a rate of 5 µLmin-1. The polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane generates a series of free<br><br>
radical species when passing through plasma. These free radicals undergo<br>
polymerisation reactions and deposit onto the substrate to form a coating.<br>
[0072] A liquid silicone resin having Si-vinyl groups, Dow Coming's Silastic (R)<br>
9780/50E, was then applied to the surface of the treated steel and thermally cured to<br>
form a rubbery solid resin coating. During this curing process, the liquid silicone<br>
resin chemically reacts with the Si-H functionality of the plasma coating and this<br>
chemically bonds the silicone to the plasma coating, thereby grafting the silicone to<br>
the steel surface. After thermal curing, attempts to physically remove this rubbery<br>
silicone resin from the steel proved difficult and any removal resulted in cohesive<br>
failure within the silicone.<br>
[0073] When the Silastic liquid silicone resin was applied to stainless steel that has<br>
not been coated with a plasma coating, there was little bonding with the surface and<br>
the cured rubbery solid silicone resin was easily peeled from the surface, exhibiting<br>
100% adhesive failure.<br>
EXAMPLE 2.<br>
[0074] Using the same process described for Example 1, a coating was deposited<br>
onto PET (polyethylene terephthalate) film. Polyhydrogenmethylsiloxane was used<br>
as the liquid precursor and either helium or argon as the process gas. When Dow<br>
Coming's Silastic ® 9780/50E was applied to this plasma coated surface and cured, a<br>
strong adhesion promotion effect was again detected and the resin could not be<br>
removed without damaging the substrate.<br>
EXAMPLES 3 TO 10<br>
[0075] An atmospheric pressure plasma assembly of the type shown in Fig. 3 was<br>
used to deposit plasma polymerised primer layers of a 50/50 w/w mixture of<br>
tetraethoxyorthosilicate (TEOS) and polyhydrogenmethyl siloxane (PHMS) onto a<br>
poly(ester terephthalate) (PET) substrate. The plasma power was varied between high<br>
(100W) and low (80W) as shown in Table 1 below. Helium was used as process gas.<br><br>
The mixture of TEOS and PHMS was introduced in an atomised liquid form through<br>
inlet (16) at the flow rate shown in Table 1. The PET substrate was moved past the<br>
plasma outlet (18) at a line speed as shown in Table 1. By means of comparison<br>
another sample was treated using the plasma in the absence of the liquid precursor<br>
(control 1). A further sample of the PET substrate was included for testing that had<br>
not been subjected to any plasma treatment (Control 2)<br>
[0076] After deposition of the plasma polymerised primer, Silastic® 9280/50 liquid<br>
silicone rubber having Si-vinyl groups was applied by blade coating and cured for 3<br>
hours at a temperature of 70°C.<br>
[0077] The adhesion of the silicone rubber layer to the PET substrate was measured<br>
using a 180° peel test at room temperature. The peel width was ½ inch (12.5mm)<br>
with a peel speed of 1 in. (25mm)/min. The average peel forces (N/m) of 2 inches<br>
(50mm) of peeling are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
[0078] As can be seen from Table 1, the coatings over a primer applied by the<br>
process of the invention showed an adhesive force to the substrate (peel strength) one<br>
or two orders of magnitude higher than the controls which had not been pretreated or<br>
only plasma pretreated. In particular, Examples 3, 6 and 7 showed such good adhesion<br>
that the test measured cohesive failure within the silicone rubber layer rather than<br>
adhesive failure between the coating and substrate.<br><br>
