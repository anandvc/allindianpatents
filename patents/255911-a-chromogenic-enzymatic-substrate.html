				<td>The present invention relates to novel chromogenic enzymatic substrates for detecting peptidase activity. These substrates can be used in applications comprising an enzymatic hydrolysis step that produces a physicochemical signal, in particular in microbiology, biochemistry, immunology, molecular biology, liistology, etc. Compared with existing substrates, most of which are fluorigenic, the chromogenic substrates of the invention can be used in particular in a gelled medium for detecting microorganisms since they produce a coloration that does not diffuse in the reaction medium and is therefore concentrated in the colonies.<br>
The invention also relates to reaction media containing such substrates, to the use of the substrates or of the media for detecting Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and yeast expressing peptidase activity, and to methods of use.<br>
The name aminopeptidase is generally given to an enzyme capable of cleaving, by hydrolysis, the amide group formed between an acyl of an amino acid and a primary amine, and the name peptidase is given to an enzyme capable of cleaving, by hydrolysis, the amide group formed between the acyl residue of a peptide and a primary amine. In the present application, the term "peptidase" can denote, as appropriate, both a peptidase and an aminopeptidase as defined above.<br>
Chromogenic enzymatic substrates, for detecting peptidase activity that do not diffuse are described and already known from the state of the art. Thus, such substrates are covered by patent applications WO-A-98/04735 and WO-A-99/38995 filed by the applicant. However, these substrates exhibit various drawbacks : they are difficult to synthesize, the purity is low and the yields are low. In addition, for use in culture media, it is necessary to define a medium composition that is very precise in order to observe a color. None of the other substrates currently described can be used in solid media for detecting microorganisms in mixed cultures.<br>
Molecules derived from phenoxazinone are known for their ability to produce fluorescence. They can be used :<br>
- as acid-base indicators, as described for example in Stuzka, V. et al., 1963, Collection Czech. Chem. Commun., 28, 1399-1407, or else<br><br>
- as fluorescent labels, for example for following conformational modifications of proteins, as described in Nakanishi J. et al, 2001, Analytical Chemistry, 73(13), 2920-2928.<br>
No phenoxazinone derivative has ever been used as an enzymatic substrate.<br>
	In  accordance  with  the  present  invention,  novel  chromogenic  enzymatic<br>
substrates for detecting microorganisms expressing peptidase activity are proposed. The invention also relates to reaction media containing such substrates, and also to the use of the substrates or of the media for detecting peptidase activities, and to methods of use.<br>
	In fact, the applicant has found, surprisingly, that it is possible to detect<br>
microorganisms expressing peptidase activity by using chromogenic phenoxazinone derivatives that produce a coloration that does not diffuse in the reaction medium, and is therefore concentrated in the colonies, the peptidase activity being demonstrated by a modification of the coloration of the colonies in the culture medium.<br>
	After seeding of the reaction media containing the substrates of the invention<br>
with the microorganisms to be tested, colonies that are colorless to white are observed when the latter are not capable of hydrolyzing the substrate. On the other hand, colored colonies are observed when they are capable of hydrolyzing the substrate of the invention.<br>
	The phenoxazinone derivatives of the invention are both chromogenic and<br>
fiuorigenic and have the advantage of good detection sensitivity.<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is chromogenic ezymatic substrates of formula (I)<br>

	The compounds of formula (Id) are compounds of formula (I) in which the<br>
radicals R1/R2 and R3/R4 each form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a<br>

The compounds of the invention can be prepared according to several methods<br>
of production depending on the ring that the radicals R1/R2 and R3/R4 form, whether      R1/R2 form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a naphthalene ring, or<br>
whether R1/R2 form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a coumarin ring,<br>
or whether R3/R4 form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a naphthalene<br>
ring, or whether R1R3 and R3/R4 each form, with the phenyl ring to which they are<br>
attached, a naphthalene ring.<br>
	Thus, the compounds of formula (I) in which RI and R2 form, with the phenyl<br>
ring to which they are attached, a naphthalene ring, can be prepared according to the<br>
procedure represented in scheme 1 below :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to scheme 1 above, the compounds of formula (I) in which R1 and R2 form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a naphthalene ring, are prepared     by reaction of an appropriate 2-amino-5-nitrophenol compound (a) with appropriate halogenated 1,4-naphthoquinone (b), which has been heated beforehand to boiling point and    then    cooled    to    25°C,    so    as    to    form    the    corresponding    9-nitro-benzo[a]phenoxazinone (c). This compound c is subsequently reacted with a mixture of copper II acetylacetonate that is reacted beforehand with sodium borohydride so as to      form the compound (d). The compound (d) is subsequently reacted with one or more optionally protected amino acids (6) in a bath cooled to approximately -12°C, so as to give the compound of formula (I). It should be noted here that, of course, when A is a single amino acid, A' in the compound (6) corresponds to A of the compound (I), but comprising an additional hydroxyl group, hi other words, when A is a single amino       acid, A' ends with   -C(0)OH, while A is linked to -NH- via -C(O)-, losing   -OH. When A is a chain of at least two amino acids, the last amino acid of A' is as described above, i.e. it comprises, with respect to the last amino acid of A, an additional hydroxyl group.<br>
The compounds of formula (la) in which RI and R2 form, with the phenyl ring to      which they are attached, a naphthalene ring, and R6 is a hydrogen atom, can also be prepared according to the method described in scheme 1 a hereinafter.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to this scheme 1 a, the compounds of formula (la) are prepared by<br>
reaction of an appropriate 3-acetamidophenol compound (1) with a nitrite (2), such as a sodium nitrite (X=Na), a potassium nitrite (X=K), etc., at a temperature of-3°C. The nitroso acetamidophenol (3) thus obtained is subsequently reacted with 1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (4) in a solvent such as butanol, by heating to a temperature of<br>
 approximately 70°C, then adding concentrated sulfuric acid and continuing the heating to 90°C, and then cooling, so as to form the appropriate 9-acetamido-benzo[a]phenoxazin-5-one. The latter compound is subsequently hydrolyzed by heating with moderately concentrated sulfuric acid so as to give the 9-amino-benzo[a]phenoxazin-5-one (5). The last step is equivalent to that of scheme 1.<br>
	The compounds of formula (I) in which R1 and R2 form, with the phenyl ring to<br>
which they are attached, a coumarin ring, can be prepared according to the procedure represented in scheme 2 hereinafter :<br>

 According to scheme 2 above, the compounds of formula (I) in which R] and R2<br>
form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a coumarin ring, but also in which, as indicated in the general definition of the compounds of formula (I), Rg is a hydrogen atom, are prepared by oxidizing and chlorinating the appropriate p-phenylenediamine derivative (7) in the presence of the compound (8) so as to obtain<br>
 N,N'-dichloro-p-benzoquinonediimine (9) according to the method of Willstaetter and Mayer (1904, Chem. Ber., 37 :1498). The latter compound is subsequently reacted in an alcoholic solution with 5,7-dihydroxycoumarin (10) so as to obtain the appropriate 7-amino-l,2-pyronylphenoxazin-3-one (11). The last step is equivalent to that of scheme 1.<br>

subsequently reacted with hydroxyiamine hydrochloride (15) according to the method of Kehrman &amp; Gottrau (reference 38, 2574, 1905) so as to obtain the hydroxyimine and aminoketone forms (compounds 16 and 17, respectively). The last step is equivalent to that of scheme 1.<br>

Accoording to scheme 4 above, the compounds of formula (I) in which the<br>
radicals R1/R1 and R5/R} each form, with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, a naphthalene ring, can be prepared by condensation of appropriate l-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid (18) with appropriate 2-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinone (19) so as to produce the appropriate dinaphthoxazonesulfonic acid (20). This compound (20) is  subsequently heated in the presence of ammonium so as to produce the aminodinaphthoxazone (21). The last step of this procedure is equivalent to that of scheme 1.<br>
In the above procedures, the starting reactants (compounds (1), (2), (4), (6), (7), (8), (10), (12), (13), (15), (18) and (19)) are commercially available, in particular from      Aldrich.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a reaction medium that uses at least one<br>
chromogenic  enzymatic  substrate of formula (I)  as  defined  above,  alone or in<br>
combination with at least one other enzymatic substrate specific for an enzymatic<br>
activity different from that detected by the substrate according to the invention.<br>
	In fact, when microorganisms expressing peptidase activity are seeded into or<br>
onto a reaction medium containing the compounds of the invention, a coloration occurs that does not diffuse in or on the reaction medium, and is therefore concentrated in the colonies.<br>
The term "reaction medium according to the invention" is intended to mean a      medium that allows the development of at least one enzymatic activity of at least one microorganism.<br>
This reaction medium can either serve only as visualizing medium, or as culture medium and visualizing medium. In the first case, the microorganisms are cultured before seeding and, in the second case, the reaction medium also constitutes the culture       medium, which constitutes a particular embodiment of the invention.<br>
The reaction medium may be solid, semi-solid or liquid. The term "solid medium" is intended to mean, for example, a gelled medium.<br>
Agar   is    the   traditional   solid   medium   in   microbiology   for   culturing<br>
microorganisms, but it is possible to use gelatin or agarose. A certain number of<br>
     preparations are commercially available, such as, for example, Columbia agar, Trypcase<br>
soy agar, Mac Conkey agar, Sabouraud agar or, more generally, those described in the<br>
 Handbook of Microbiological Media (CRC Press).<br>
Preferably, when the reaction medium is also a culture medium, it is in gelled form.<br>
The amount of agar in the reaction medium is from 2 to 40 g/1 and preferably       from 9 to 25 g/1.<br>
The enzymatic substrates of the invention can be used within a broad pH range, in particular between pH 5.5 and 10.<br>
The concentration of enzymatic substrate of the invention in the reaction medium is between 0.025 and 0.40 g/1, and it is advantageously 0.05 g/1. This is      because, at this substrate concentration, better coloration contrast is obtained.<br>
The reaction medium may comprise at least one other substrate specific for an enzymatic activity different from that detected by the substrate according to the invention. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the other substrate(s) generates a detectable signal that is different from the signal detected by the substrate of the- invention, such  as, for example, different colored or fluorescent products, so as to allow the demonstration such as the detection and/or the identification and/or the quantification of one or more microorganisms.<br>
As other specific substrate, mention may be made of substrates of indoxyl type, such as 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-p-D-glucoside (Biosynth) or 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-     indoxyl-p-D-galactoside (Biosynth), or any other substrate used in the detection of microorganisms.<br>
The concentration of the other specific enzymatic substrate is generally between 0.01 and 2 g/1. Those skilled in the art will be able to readily determine such a concentration according to the substrate used.<br>
	The reaction medium can also comprise one or more elements in combination,<br>
such as amino acids, peptones, carbohydrates, nucleotides, minerals, vitamins, antibiotics, surfactants, buffers, phosphate salts, ammonium salts, sodium salts or metal salts. Examples of media are described in the applicant's patent applications EP 656 421 and WO 99/09 207.<br>
	The enzymatic substrates and reaction media of the invention are therefore<br>
useful in the diagnosis of microorganisms with peptidase activity.<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is also the use of a chromogenic enzymatic substrate of formula (I), or of a reaction medium as defined above, for the detection and/or identification and/or quantification of microorganisms expressing at least one peptidase activity.<br>
	The invention also relates to a method for the detection and/or identification<br>
and/or quantification of microorganisms expressing at least one peptidase activity, characterized in that in consists in :<br>
•	providing a reaction medium, as defined above,<br>
•	seeding the medium with a biological sample to be tested,<br>
      •   leaving to incubate, and<br>
•	revealing the presence of at least one peptidase activity alone or in combination with<br>
at least one other enzymatic activity different from this same peptidase activity.<br>
The seeding and incubation steps are widely known to those skilled in the art. For example, the incubation temperature is 37°C. As regards the incubation       atmosphere,  it can equally be anaerobic or aerobic. However, the incubation is preferably carried out under aerobic conditions since this improves the enzymatic activity.<br>
The revelation is carried out with the naked eye by visualizing a change in coloration that does not diffuse in the reaction medium, and is therefore concentrated in      the colonies.<br>
By way of microorganisms which may be diagnosed by means of the enzymatic substrate of the invention, mention may be made of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts.<br>
By way of Gram-negative bacteria, mention may be made of bacteria of the<br>
      following genera: Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Salmonella,  Shigella, Enterobacter,<br>
Klebsiella,  Serratia,  Proteus,   Campylobacter,   Haemophilus,  Morganella,   Vibrio,<br>
Yersinia, Acinetobacter, Branhamella, Neisseria, Burkholderia, Citrobacter, Hafnia,<br>
Edwardsiella and Legionella.<br>
By way of Gram-positive bacteria, mention may be made of bacteria of the       following genera : Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Listeria, Clostridium, Mycobacteria and Corynebacteria.<br>
Examples  of yeasts  comprise  yeasts  of the  following  genera:   Candida, Cryptococcus, Saccharomyces and Trichosporon.<br>
The biological samples to be analyzed are any clinical sample, such as a saliva, blood, urine or stool sample, or any other sample the analysis of which may aid a  clinician in putting forward a diagnosis. The sample may also be a sample of a product derived from, or a base product of, the food and/or pharmaceutical industry, in which it is necessary to either guarantee the absence of pathogenic microorganisms, or to count a contaminating flora, or to detect specific microorganisms.<br>
The chromogenic substrates of the invention, in which A is alanine, have the      advantage that they make it possible to differentiate Gram-negative bacteria from Gram-positive bacteria.<br>
Thus, another subject of the invention consists of a method for differentiating, among bacteria, between those belonging to  Gram-positive microbes  and those belonging to Gram-negative microbes, characterized in that consists in :       •   providing a reaction medium, as defined above and in which the substituent A of the chromogenic substrate is alanine,<br>
•	seeding the medium with a biological sample to be tested,<br>
•	leaving to incubate, and<br>
•	revealing the presence of at least one coloration synonymous with the presence of a<br>
	Gram-negative microbe or Gram-negative microbes.<br>
As regards the chromogenic substrates in which A is proline, they have the advantage that they make it possible to differentiate the yeast of the species Candida albicans from those of the species Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata.<br>
Thus, another subject of the invention relates to a method for differentiating the  yeast of the species Candida albicans from those of the species Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata, characterized in that it consists in :<br>
•	providing a reaction medium, as defined above and in which the substituent A of the<br>
chromogenic substrate is proline,<br>
•	seeding the medium with a biological sample to be tested,<br>
      •   leaving  to   incubate,   and  revealing  the  presence  of at  least  one   coloration synonymous with the presence of the yeast of the species Candida albicans.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly from the following examples given by way of nonlimiting illustration.<br>
Example 1 : Synthesis of 9-ammobenzo[a1phenoxazin-5-one<br>
(compound (5) with R3=R4=R5=:H)<br>
	1.1 Preparation of 2-nitroso-5-acetamidophenol<br>
9 g of 3-acetamidophenol (Aldrichj were dissolved in an aqueous solution (100 ml) containing 2.8 g of sodium hydroxide. The solution was cooled to -3°C using an ice-salt bath and 5 g of sodium nitrite in water (12 ml) were added.<br>
A solution of phosphoric acid diluted with an equal amount of water (25 ml)<br>
     was added, using a separating funnel, to the stirred solution. Such an addition was<br>
carried out at a rate such that the temperature was maintained at 0°C or below this<br>
temperature. A red-brown precipitate then formed. After further vigorous stirring for<br>
one hour, the pH was determined so as to guarantee complete acidity (pH
The thick suspension thus obtained was filtered and the residue was carefully      washed with cold water so as to remove the excess acid and salts. After appropriate aspiration, the residue was dried in a vacuuum desiccator. 7.36 g of 2-nitroso-5-acetamidophenol were obtained with a yield of 68.6%.<br>
1.2 Preparation of 9-acetamidobenzo[a1phenoxazin-5-one 1.8g  of the  crude product  obtained  in point   1.1   above  and   1.60g  of       1,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (Aldrich) were dissolved in 50 ml of butan-1-ol while at the same time stirring and heating to 70°C. 1 g of concentrated sulfuric acid was added dropwise to the heated solution and the heating was continued to 90°C. After 30 min, the mixture was allowed to cool. The solid phase was removed by suction filtration and washing was performed with a little ethanol. After drying, the title compound was       obtained with a yield of 76%.<br>
The product obtained was subjected to thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using ethyl acetate/toluene (3 :1) as mobile phase. A light orange-yellow spot was obtained (Rf=0.8).<br>
1.3 Preparation of 9-aminobenzora]phenoxazin-5-one<br>
	1.5 g of the compound obtained in point 1.2 above were dissolved in a minimal<br>
volume of sulfuric acid and water (1:1), while at the same time stirring and heating to<br><br>
100°C until a sample taken and diluted in water, and then extracted in ethyl acetate, no longer showed any starting product by thin layer chromatography. The dark solution thus obtained was stirred and was heated to boiling point for several minutes, and was then cooled and poured into an ice-water bath (300 ml). The precipitated base was  finely divided, heating was then carried out to 40°C and the product was left to stand overnight. The supernatant liquid was allowed to separate by settling out, and the suspension of product was filtered and washed with water. After drying, the intended product was obtained with a yield of 78%.<br>
	Example 2 : Aminoacylation of 9-aminobenzo[a1phenoxazin-5-one<br>
(Compound of formula (I) in which Ri/R2 form a naphthalene, R3=R4=R5=R
0.52 g (2 mmol) of the amino compound concerned, obtained in Example 1, was<br>
dissolved in 15ml of dimethylformamide (high performance liquid chromatography<br>
      quality) while at the same time heating, and then in 10ml of tetrahydrofuran. This<br>
solution was hydrogenated in a three-necked flask using hydrogen (produced from<br>
sodium borohydrate/acetic acid), and also 0.1 g of 10% palladium-on-charcoal as<br>
catalyst. The dark violet color was replaced with a fluorescent green appearance. The<br>
hydrogenation was continued for 30 min, the flask was closed and was left to stand<br>
     overnight.<br>
3 mmol of amino acid protected with N-tBOC were dissolved in 10ml of anhydrous THF and the product was cooled to -12°C (ice/salt bath). 0.33 g (3.3 mmol) of N-methylmorpholine was added to the solution thus cooled, and then 0.42 g (3.1 mmol) of isobutyl chloroformate was added gently at between -12°C and -9°C.  After 5 min, the mixed anhydride reaction mixture above was poured into the stirred solution of reduced amine, the mixture was precooled to at least -5°C, while hydrogen was introduced so as to prevent reoxidation. After 10 min, the flask was closed and the content was stirred for a further 5 hours at ambient temperature.<br>
The reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent (THF) was removed by rotary<br>
      evaporation. The DMF solution was poured into a thoroughly stirred water-ice mixture<br>
and the precipitate was filtered off, washed with water and air-dried. The crude product<br>
was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) and was washed with dilute (0.2M) sodium hydroxide and then with water. After drying with magnesium sulfate, the solvent was eliminated.<br>
In certain cases, the filtration of the DCM extract through a cone of silica gel      removed  the  traces  of the  base  material  liable  to  be  observed  by thin  layer chromatography.<br>
The compound obtained in this example can then be deprotected in the following way : the product is dissolved in a small volume of ethyl acetate and stirred with an equal amount of ethyl acetate saturated with hydrogen chloride for 1 hour. An  excess of anhydrous ether is added and the precipitated hydrochloride salt is rapidly filtered off, then washed with additional ether or ether/mineral essence, and then dried in vacua.<br>

1,3-dihydroxynaphthoate were dissolved in 60 ml of butanol while heating and the<br>
mixture was stirred at 70°C. Concentrated sulfuric acid was gradually added dropwise<br>
and the solution was heated gradually to approximately 90°C. After 30min, the<br>
      reaction mixture was cooled and was kept at 5°C overnight.<br>
The red product was removed by suction filtration and washed with a little ethanol.<br>
After   drying,   the   9-acetamido-6-carbethoxybenzo[a]phenoxazin-5-one   was<br>
obtained with a yield of 65%.<br>

The 9-acetamido-6-carbethoxybenzo[a]phenoxazin-5-one obtained in point 3.2 was dissolved in a mixture of sulfuric acid (3 ml) and ethanol (3 ml). The mixture was heated to 80°C while at the same time gradually adding water (1 ml). The purple color characteristic of the amine rapidly appeared. The hydrolysis was continued until the  sample, diluted with water, and then extracted in ethyl acetate, no longer showed any 9-acetamido-6-carbethoxybenzo[a]phenoxazin-5-one by thin layer chromatography.<br>
The reaction mixture was poured into 150 ml of ice-cold water and the product<br>
i.<br>
was collected by suction filtration, and then washed with water and dried. The product<br>
was obtained with a yield of 85%. <br>

trifluoroacetic acid, which operation was followed by precipitation from ether. The<br>
product was thus obtained in the form of an homogeneous orange powder by thin layer<br>
chromatography.<br>

7.1 Preparation of naphthophenoxazone<br>
The   method   of Fisher   &amp;   Hepp   (above)   was   used   without   significant       modification, carrying out the condensation of 4-nitrosophenol and of 2-naphthol in glacial acetic acid using zinc chloride as condensation agent.<br>
The crude product was recrystallized from hot toluene/mineral essence with a yield of 25%.<br>
The 4-nitrosophenol used here is a commercial product obtained from Fluka that<br>
     was converted in the following way : this product was purified by dissolving it in ether,<br>
by filtering it through a Phase-Sep paper and by stirring with Norite for one hour. After<br><br>
filtration, the ethereal solution was rotary-evaporated so as to obtain a small volume and cooled so as to obtain a crystalline product of pure nitrosophenol. 7.2 Preparation of the amine product<br>
According to the method of Kehrmann &amp; Gottrau (above),  3.0 g of the<br>
      naphthophenoxazone  obtained  in  point   7.1   above   and   3.0 g  of hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride were mixed with 200 ml of absolute ethanol and the mixture was<br>
gradually heated to boiling point. The red color of the naphthophenoxazone was<br>
gradually replaced with an orange color and precipitation of the hydrochloride of the<br>
base occurred. The precipitate was removed by filtration, washed with a little ethanol,<br>
      and then dried so as to obtain the hydrochloride with a yield of 63%.<br>
1 g of the salt thus obtained was decomposed by heating with water, and then by cooling so as to give a green residue of the free base. The product was filtered and dissolved in a few ml of ethanol at 40°C while at the same time adding a sufficient amount of HC1 for solution. The fluorescent violet-red solution was heated with a  sufficient amount of anhydrous sodium acetate to give the free base (dark green metal needles).

2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylate were mixed together in a small flask using a little ethanol. After cooling, 30 ml of a mixture of sulfuric acid/water at 75% mass by mass were added to the stirred mixture. The stirring was continued at ambient temperature for 48 h. The semi-solid product was poured into a thoroughly stirred ice/water mixture  and filtration was carried out. The residue was thoroughly washed with water, drained by suction and air-dried.<br><br>
Recrystallization from ethanol gave a product that was homogeneous by thin layer chromatography. The yield was 2.8 g. 8.2 Preparation of the title compound<br>
2.18g (lOmmol) of the 5,7-dihydroxy-3,4-cyclopentenocoumarin obtained in<br>
     point 8.1 above were dissolved in 40 ml of hot ethanol and 1.74 g (10 mmol) of 1,4-<br>
dichloro-p-benzoquinonediimine were added to the stirred solution.  The reaction<br>
mixture was slowly brought to reflux above a waterbath for several minutes, during<br>
which time the liquid became deep violet in color. After refluxing for a further 20 min,<br>
the reaction mixture was poured into 250 ml of an ice/water mixture containing 2 g of<br>
      acetate. The colorant separated in the form of a dark blue precipitate. The precipitate<br>
thus obtained was removed by suction filtration and was washed with water. The dried<br>

9.1 Preparation of 5,7-dihvdroxy-4-methylcoumarin<br>
A mixture of 2.77 g (22 mmol) of phloroglucinol and 2.6 g (20 mmol) of ethyl  acetoacetate were melted together, the mixture was cooled, and 40 ml of a mixture of sulfuric acid/water (75% w/w) was added rapidly to the semi-solid mass. The mixture was stirred for 24 h, during which time a semi-solid mass formed. It was poured into a mixture of ice/water (300 ml) containing 5 g of sodium acetate and the precipitate was recovered by suction filtration.<br>
	After  repeated  washing  with  water  and   drying,   the  crude  product  was<br>
recrystallized from hot ethanol so as to give 3.05 g of coumarin.<br>
9.2 Preparation of 7-amino-l,2-(4'-methyl-2'-pvronyl)phenoxazin-3-one 1.92 g (10 mmol) of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin were dissolved in 50 ml of anhydrous methanol. 7.5 g (0.125 mol) of urea were added to the stirred hot solution      in order to moderate the exothermicity and to reduce the chlorination of the product.<br>
1.74 g (lOmmol) of 1,4-dichlorobenzoquinonediimine were added to the reaction mixture, which had been refluxed for 2 h with stirring.<br>
The dark purple solution was poured into a thoroughly stirred mixture of water/ice containing 10 g of sodium acetate. The dark purple precipitate was removed  by vacuum filtration and drying was carried out. The crude product was purified by suspension in 200 ml of methanol heated to 50°C while at the same time gradually adding to the thoroughly stirred mixture a solution of 5 g of sodium dithionite and 5 g of sodium carbonate in 20 ml of water. A yellowy-brown-colored precipitate formed.<br>
The reaction mixture was rapidly filtered so as to isolate a precipitate of the<br>
      colorant in the dihydro form. It was washed with a mixture of ice/water containing a<br>
little sodium dithionite and the precipitate thus made moist was transferred into 100 ml<br>
of methanol. The rapidly stirred solution was heated to 40°C and water was gradually<br>
added, thereby making it possible to reoxidize the colorless colorant (in dihydro form)<br>
and to obtain a dark purplish-brown precipitate. Finally, 100 ml of water were added so<br>
      as to end the oxidation and the precipitation of the colorant, which was dried after<br>
having been removed by filtration. Thin layer chromatography indicated only a single<br>
purple compound and a few traces of the same compound in the dihydro form.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
The results indicated in Table 9 above show that a coloration characteristic of the enzymatic activities exhibited by the strains is clearly observed, as follows :<br>
a pink to orange coloration in the case of the strains having only the proline peptidase activity due to the hydrolysis of the substrate of the invention (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumanii, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda and Candida albicans),<br>
a turquoise coloration in the case of the strains having only the -glucosidase activity due to the hydrolysis of the substrate of the prior art (Staphylococcus sciuri, Enterococcus faecalis) and<br>
a green to brown coloration, originating from the mixture of the 2 colorations pink/orange and turquoise, for the strains having the two enzymatic activities (Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Klebsellia pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria innocua).<br>
Consequently, it is possible to detect several different enzymatic activities specific for each strain according to their metabolism.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
