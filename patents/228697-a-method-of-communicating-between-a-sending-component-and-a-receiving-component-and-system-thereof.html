The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2002/071557	PCT/US2M5/001590<br>
A MULTIPLE ADDRESS TWO CHANNEL BUS STRUCTURE<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Related Application<br>
(0000]       This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/538,505, filed January 22,2004.<br>
Field<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to digital systems, and more specifically, to a multiple address two channel bus structure.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] Computers have revolutionized the electronics industry by enabling sophisticated processing tasks to be performed with just a few strokes of a keypad. These sophisticated tasks can involve a number of complex components mat communicate with one another in a fast and efficient manner using a bus. A bus is a channel or path between components in a computer.<br>
[0003] A typical computer includes a processor with system memory. A high bandwidth system bus may be used to support communications between the processor and system memory. In addition, there may also be a lower performance bus which is used to transfer data to lower bandwidth components, m some cases, there may also be a configuration bus which is used for the purpose of programming various resources. Bridges may be used to efficiently transfer data between the higher and lower bandwidth buses, as well as provide protocol translation.<br>
[0004] Commonly buses resident in a computer have been implemented as shared buses. A shared bus provides a means for any number of components to communicate over a common path or channel. Recently by point-to-point switching connections have become more popular. Point-to-point switching connections provide a direct connection between two components on the bus while they are communicating with each other. Multiple direct links may be used to allow several components to communicate without slowing each other down.<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/00159O<br>
[0005] Conventional bus design commonly includes independent and separate read, write and one or more address channels. A processor, for example, can read or write to system memory by placing an address location on the address channel and sending the appropriate read/write control signal. When the microprocessor writes data to system memory, it sends the data over the write channel. When the microprocessor reads data from system memory, it receives the data over the read channel.<br>
[0006] Although this particular bus structure provides a fairly standardized way to communicate between components of a computer, it requires a number of dedicated channels. These channels require driver, receiver and buffer circuits, all which consume power. In integrated circuit applications, these channels occupy valuable chip area. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a simplified bus structure.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] In one aspect of the present invention, a method of communicating between a sending component and a receiving component over a bus includes broadcasting from the sending component on a first channel read address information comprising a plurality of read address locations, write address information comprising a plurality of write address locations, and write data. The sending component also broadcasts the read and write address information multiple address locations at a time. The method further includes storing the write data broadcast on the first channel at the receiving component based on the write address information, retrieving read data from the receiving component based on the read address information, and broadcasting from the receiving component the retrieved read data on the second channel.<br>
[0008] In another aspect of the present invention, a processing system includes a bus having first and second channels, a sending component and a receiving component. The sending component is configured to broadcast on the first channel read address information comprising a plurality of read address locations, write address information comprising a plurality of write address locations, and write data. The sending component is further configured to broadcast the read and write address information multiple address locations at a time. The receiving component is configured to store the write data broadcast on the first channel based on the write address information, retrieve<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590  <br>
read data based on the read address information, and broadcast the retrieved read data on the second channel to the sending component.<br>
[0009] In a further aspect of the present invention, a processing system includes a bus having first and second channels. The processing system also includes means for broadcasting on the first channel read address information comprising a plurality of read address locations, write address information comprising a plurality of write address locations, and write data, the read and write address information being broadcast multiple address locations at a time. The processing system further includes means for storing the write data broadcast on the first channel based on the write address information, retrieving the read data based on the read address information, and broadcasting the retrieved read data on the second channel to the sending component<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the present invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. Each embodiment described in this disclosure is provided merely as an example or illustration of the present invention, and should not necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the present invention- However, ft win be apparent to those skilled in the art mat the present invention may be practiced without these specific details, hi some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the present invention. Acronyms and other descriptive terminology may he used merely for convenience and clarity and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating an example of a point-to-point connection over a bus between two components in a processing system. The processing system 100 may be a collection of components that cooperate to perform one or more processing functions. Commonly, the processing system will be a computer, or resident in a computer, and capable of processing, retrieving and storing information. The processing system may be a stand-alone system. Alternatively, the processing system may be embedded in any device, including by way of example, a cellular telephone.<br>
[0019] The processing system 100 is shown with a sending component 102 in communication with a receiving component 104 over a bus 106. In one embodiment of the processing system 100, the bus 106 is a dedicated bus between the sending component 102 and the receiving component. In another embodiment of the processing system 100, the sending component 102 communicates with the receiving component<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
104 with a point-to-point connection over the bus 106 through a bus interconnect (not shown). Moreover, as those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the inventive aspects described throughout this disclosure are not limited to a dedicated bus or point-to-point switching connection, but may be applied to any type of bus technology including, by way of example, a shared bus.<br>
[0020] The sending component 102 may be any type of bus mastering component including, by way of example, a microprocessor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a direct memory access controller, a bridge, a programmable logic component, discrete gate or transistor logic, or any other information processing component<br>
[0021] The receiving component 104 may be any storage component, including, by way of example, registers, memory, a bridge, or any other component capable of retrieving and storing information. The storage capacity at each address location of the receiving component may vary depending on the particular application and the overall design constraints. For the purposes of explanation,, the receiving component will be described with a storage capacity of 1-byte per address location.<br>
|0922] The complexity of the bus 106 may be reduced in this example by eliminating the address channel that is used in conventional bus structures. The elimination of the address channel may be achieved by redefining the write channel as a 'transmit channel" 108. The transmit channel 108 may be used as a generic medium for broadcasting information between the sending component 102 and the receiving component 104 in a time division multiplexed fashion.<br>
[0023] The sending component 102 may read from or write to the receiving component 104. In the case where the sending component 102 writes to the receiving component 104, the sending component 102 may sample one or more sideband signals 112 for an acknowledgement that the receiving component 104 is ready to perform a write operation. If the sending component 102 receives an acknowledgement, it may broadcast an address location on the transmit channel 108 followed by write data. The sending component 102 may also use one or more sideband signals 114 to request a write operation and indicate the number data bytes being broadcast If the write data is multiple bytes, then the receiving component 104 may store the data in a block of sequential address locations beginning with the address location broadcast on the transmit channel 108. By way of example, if the sending device broadcasts an address<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
location 100HEX followed by 4-bytes of write data, the receiving component may write the data to a block of address locations starting at 100HEX and ending at 103HEX- The 4-bytes of write data is referred to as the "payload."<br>
[0024] In the case where the sending component 102 reads from the receiving component 104, the sending component 102 may sample one or more of the sideband signals 112 for an acknowledgement that the receiving component 104 is ready to perform a read operation. If the sending component 102 receives an acknowledgement, it may broadcast an address location on the transmit channel 108. The sending component 102 may use one or more of the sideband signals 114 to request a read operation and indicate the number data bytes being broadcast If the read data is multiple bytes, then the receiving component may read data from a block of sequential address locations beginning with the address location broadcast on the transmit channel 108. By way of example, if me sending device broadcasts an address location 200HEX and requests 4-bytes of read data, the receiving component may retrieve the read data from a block of address locations starting at 200HEX and ending at 203HEX<br>
[0025]FIG. 2 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating an example of a point-to-point connection over multiple address two channel bus between two components in a processing system, m the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the sending component 102 may use the transmit channel 108 to broadcast two different address locations 104a and 104b within the receiving component 104 at the same time. One or more sideband signals 114a and 114b may be associated with each of the address locations. It will be understood that the sending component 102 may also use the transmit channel 108 to broadcast a single address location to two different receiving components at the same time in shared bus applications. If the receiving component is a bridge, one or both address locations may be used to access the bridge, or alternatively access another receiving component on the other side of the bridge. Alternative embodiments of the bus may include a transmit channel configured to support a simultaneous broadcast of any number of address locations to multiple receiving components, multiple address locations within a receiving component, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0026] The use of the transmit channel 108 to simultaneously broadcast multiple address locations may improve performance by providing address information to the receiving component sooner, thus decreasing the amount of read latency.  In addition,<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
the simultaneous broadcast of multiple address locations may allow a more efficient return of read data to the sending component 102 over the read channel 110.<br>
[0027] In multiple address bus applications, the transmit channel 1 OS may be 64-bits wide to support two 32-bit addresses. The first 32-bit address, which will be referred to as "Address A," may be used to broadcast one address location 104a. The second 32-bit address, which will be referred to as "Address B," may be used to broadcast the other address location 104b. With this configuration, the sending component 102 may initiate (1) two read operations simultaneously, (2) two write operations simultaneously, (3) simultaneous read and write operations at different address locations, or (4) simultaneous read and write operation to the same address location or locations.<br>
[0028] An implicit addressing scheme may be used to handle simultaneous read and write operation requests to the same address location. By way of example, the sending component 102 may broadcast the address location for the first operation as Address A, and the address location for the second operation as Address B. The read/write sequence performed by the receiving component 104 will be based on this addressing scheme to maintain sequential consistency. Thus, if the same address location is used as Address A and Address B, and the sending device signals a 1-byte write operation for Address A and a 1 -byte read operation for Address B, men the receiving component 104 will wait until the data broadcast on the transmit channel is written to the address location before providing the newly written data at this address location to the read channel for transmission to the sending component 102. Conversely, if the sending device signals a 1-byte read operation for Address A and a 1-byte write operation for Address B, then the receiving component 104 will provide the data at this address location to the read channel 110 before writing the new data from the transmit channel 108 to this address location.<br>
[0029] Alternatively, read and write operation requests to the same address location may be broadcast sequentially. By way of example, the sending component 102 may broadcast the address location for the first operation as Address A during a first clock cycle, and the address location for the second operation as Address B during the following clock cycle. In this case, the receiving component may perform the operation requested during the first clock cycle before performing the operation requested during the second clock cycle.<br><br><br><br>

[0030] An implicit addressing scheme may also be used to control the sequence of data broadcast on the transmit and read channels 108 and 110. By way of example, if the sending component initiates a read operation from two address locations simultaneously, the receiving component 104 may broadcast the read data associated with Address A followed by the read data associated with Address B. Similarly, if the sending component initiates a write operation to two address locations simultaneously, the sending component may broadcast the write data associated with Address A followed by the write data associated with Address B. Alternatively, sideband signaling may be used to control the broadcast sequence of the read and write data.<br>
[0031) The various concepts described thus far may be implemented using any number of protocols. In the detailed description to follow, an example of a bus protocol will be presented. This bus protocol is being presented to illustrate the inventive aspects of a processing system, with the understanding that such inventive aspects may be used with any suitable protocol. The basic signaling used for tins protocol is shown below in Table 1. Those skilled in Ac art will readily be able to vary and/or add signals to this protocol in the actual implementation of the bus structure described herein.<br>

[0032] FIG. 3 is a timing diagram showing four address pipelined read operations over a multiple address two channel bus. A System Clock 302 may be used to synchronize communications between the sending component and the receiving component. The System Clock 302 is shown with fourteen clock cycles, with each cycle numbered sequentially for ease of explanation.<br>
[0033] Two read operations may be initiated by the sending component during the second clock cycle 303. This may be achieved by broadcasting an address location associated with a first read operation R1as Address A and an address location associated with a second read operation R2 as Address B over the Transmit Channel 318. The read operation may be selected by asserting read/write signal indicators for Addresses A and B to "1". The read/write signal indicators for Addresses A and B are shown in FIG. 3 as R/W A 306 and R/W B 312, respectively. The sending component may also alert the receiving component that address locations will be broadcast by asserting AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals. Finally, the sending component may<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/UJS2005/001590<br>
provide the receiving component with signals indicating the size of the payload for the read operations. These signals are shown in FIG. 3 as SizeA 308 for Address A and SizeB 314 for Address B. The number of clock cycles needed to broadcast the payload, commonly referred to in the art as data beats, may be used to indicate the size of the payload. By way of example, SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 both indicate two data beats. This means that one 16-byte payload is to be read from a block of 16 sequential address locations starting at Address A and another 16-byte payload is to be read from a block of 16 sequential address locations starting at Address B.<br>
[0034] The receiving component may monitor the AVafidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals to determine when valid address locations are broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318. When the receiving component detects the assertion of the AVafidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, it may sample the address information from the Transmit Channel 318 and sample the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312 to determine whether the sending component is requesting a read or write operation for Addresses A and B. Based on this information, and the size of the payload indicated by the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals, the receiving component may begin retrieving read data at the appropriate address locations. The receiving component may also assert a Transfer Ack 316 signal indicating mat it has successfully received the broadcast<br>
[0035] At the end of the second clock cycle 303, the sending component may detect the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal, and respond by initiating two more read operations. This may be achieved by broadcasting an address location associated with a third read operation R3 as Address A and an address location associated with a fourth read operation R4 as Address B over the Transmit Channel 318, setting the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312 to "1," asserting the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, and indicating to the receiving component the size of the payload using the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals. In this case, the size of the payload for both read operations is 16-bytes.<br>
[0036] The receiving component may detect the assertion of the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, sample the address information from the Transmit Channel 318, and sample the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312. Based on this information, and the size of the payload indicated by the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals, the receiving component may begin retrieving read data at the appropriate<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
address locations. The receiving component may also assert the Transfer Ack 316 signal indicating that it has successfully received the broadcast.<br>
[0037] Once the sending component detects the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal at the end of the third clock cycle 305, it may deassert the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, indicating to the receiving component that a read or write operation will not be requested during the fourth clock cycle 307.<br>
[0038] Due to the read latency of the receiving component, a several clock cycle delay may be experienced before the read data is available. In this case, the first 8-bytes of the read data R1(l) associated with the first read operation R1 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during the sixth clock cycle 311, and the second 8-bytes of read data R1(2) associated with the first read operation R1 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during me seventh dock cycle 313.<br>
[0039]      In a similar fashion, me read data R2(1) and R2(2) associated with second <br>
read operation R3 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during the eighth and ninth dock cycles 315 and 317, the read data R3(l) and R3(2) associated with the mud read operation R4 may be retrieved from me receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during the tenth and eleventh clock cycles 319 and 321, and the read data R4(l) and R4(2) associated with the fourth read operation R4 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during the twelfth and thirteenth clock cycles 323 and 325.<br>
[0040] During this eight clock cycle broadcast, the receiving component may assert a Read Ack 324 signal to indicate to the sending component that it is broadcasting read data on the Read Channel 322.<br>
[0041] FIG. 4 is a timing diagram showing six address pipelined read operations over a multiple address two channel bus. The four read operations described earlier in connection with FIG. 3 are repeated in FIG. 4, and therefore, do not warrant further discussion here.<br>
[0042] Two additional read operations may be initiated by the sending component in the fourth clock cycle 307 by broadcasting an address location associated with a fifth read operation R5 as Address A and an address location associated with a sixth read<br><br>
W0 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
operation R6 as Address B over the Transmit Channel 318, setting read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312 to "I," asserting the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, and indicating to the receiving component the size of the payload using the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals.<br>
[0043] During the same clock cycle, the receiving component may deassert the Transfer Ack 316 signal indicating that it cannot currently accept the broadcast because, by way of example, it's address queue is foil. The sending component may detect that the Transfer Ack 316 signal is not asserted at the end of the fourth clock cycle 307. In response, the sending component may continue to broadcast the address locations for the fifth and sixth read operations R5 and R6 on the Transmit Channel 318, along with the appropriate settings for the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312, the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, and the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals, until the sending component detects the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal from the receiving component In this case, the broadcast is repeated m the fifth, sixth and seventh clock cycles 309, 311 and 313. Daring the seventh cycle 313, the receiving component may be able to receive a broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 and perform the requested operation, as indicated by the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal. In response to the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal, the sending component determines that it does not need to send a repeat broadcast during the eighth clock cycle 315, and deasserts the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals.<br>
[0044] Alternatively, the sending component may queue the broadcast for the address locations associated with the fifth and sixth read operations when it detects that the Transfer Ack 316 signal is not asserted at the end of the fourth clock cycle 307. The broadcast may be queued until the receiving component indicates that it is ready to accept a broadcast over the Transmit Channel 318 by reasserting the Transfer Ack 316 signal. In this case, the sending component may monitor the Transfer Ack 316 signal until it is asserted by the receiving component in the seventh clock cycle 313. When the sending component detects that the Transfer Ack 316 is asserted, it may rebroadcast the queued address locations over the Transmit Channel 318 in the eighth clock cycle 315, along with the appropriate settings for the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312, the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, and the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals.   During the fifth, sixth and seventh clock cycles 309, 311, and 313, the<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
sending component may broadcast new address locations on the Transmit Channel 318, or broadcast any outstanding write data to the receiving component.<br>
[0045]      Returning to FIG. 4, the receiving component may be able to receive a broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 and perform the requested operation in the seventh clock cycle 313. More specifically, the receiving component may sample the address information from the Transmit Channel 318, and sample the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312. Based on this information, and the size of the payload indicated by the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals, the receiving component may begin retrieving the read data at the new address locations. The first 8-bytes of the read data R5(l) associated with the fifth read operation R5 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during the fourteenth clock cycle 327, and the second 8-bytes of read data R5(2) associated with the fifth read operation R5 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on me Read Channel 322 during the fifteenth clock cycle 329. Similarity, the first 8-bytes of the read data R6(l) associated with the sixth read operation R6 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during me sixteen clock cycle 331, and the second 8-bytes of read data R6(2) associated with the sixth read operation R6 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322 during the seventeenth clock cycle 333<br>
[0046] FIG. 5 is a timing diagram showing read and write operations over a multiple address two channel bus. Two read operations may be initiated by the sending component during the second clock cycle 303. This may be achieved by broadcasting an address location associated with a first read operation R1as Address A and an address location associated with a second read operation R2 as Address B over the Transmit Channel 318, setting read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312 to "1," asserting the AValidA 304 and AVahdB 310 signals, and indicating to the receiving component the size of the payload using the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals. In this case, the size of the payload for the read operation at both address locations is 16-bytes.<br>
[0047] The receiving component may detect the assertion of the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, sample the address information from the Transmit Channel 318, and sample the read/write signal indicators R/W A 306 and R/W B 312. Based on this<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2005/001590<br>
information, and the size of the payload indicated by the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals, the receiving component may begin retrieving read data at the appropriate address locations. The receiving component may also assert the Transfer Ack 316 signal indicating that it has successfully received the broadcast.<br>
[0048] The sending component may detect the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal at the end of the second clock cycle 303. Responsive to the assertion of the Transfer Ack 316 signal, the sending component may deassert the AValidA 304 and AValidB signals 310. By deasserting the AValidA 304 and the AValidB 310 signals, the sending component is indicating to the receiving component that it will either broadcast write data on the Transmit Channel 318, or nothing at all on the Transmit Channel 318. In this case, nothing will be broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 because a write operation request has not been made.<br>
|0049) In the firm clock cycle 503, the sending component may initiate a write operation by broadcasting an address location associated with a first write operation W1 as Address A over the Transmit Channel 318, setting the read/write signal indicator R/W A 306 to “0’ to indicate a write operation, asserting the AValidA 304 signal to alert the receiving component of an address location broadcast, and indicating to the receiving component the size of the payload using the SizeA 308 signal. In this case, the size of the payload for the write operation is 32-bytes as indicated in FIG. 5 by four data beats.<br>
[0050] In response to this broadcast, the receiving component may assert the Transfer Ack 316 signal during the fifth clock cycle 309 indicating that it has successfully received the broadcast The receiving component may also assert the Write Ack 320 signal during the sixth clock cycle 311 indicating that it is ready to write data to the address location associated with the first write operation W1.<br>
[0051] In the sixth clock cycle 311, the sending component may deassert the AValidA signal 304. As explained earlier, by deasserting the AValidA 304 signal, the sending component is indicating to the receiving component that it will either broadcast write data on the Transmit Channel 318, or nothing at all on the Transmit Channel 318. In this case, the receiving component will be looking for the first 8-bytes of the write data associated with the first write operation W1 Although a second write operation may be requested at any time by asserting the AValidA and/or AValidB signals 304 and<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PCT/US2OO5/00159<br>
16<br>
310, the sending component will not send write data for the second write operation until the broadcast of the write data for die first write operation is complete. This approach tends to reduce sideband signaling requirements that might otherwise be required to indicate which write operation the payload is associated with.<br>
[0052] With the AValidA signal 304 deasserted, the sending component may broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 the first 8-bytes of the write data W1(l) associated with the first write operation W1. The receiving component may write the data to the appropriate block of 8 address locations.<br>
[0053] Concurrently, the first 8-bytes of the read data R1(l) associated with the first read operation R1 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322. The receiving component may also assert the Read Ack 324 signal indicating that it is sending read data on the Read Channel 322.<br>
|0054) With the Write Ack 320 signal still asserted in the seventh clock cycle 313, the sending component may broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 the second 8-bytes of the write data Wi(2) associated with roe first write operation Wt. The receiving component may write the data to roe appropriate block of 8 address locations.<br>
(0055) Concurrently, the second 8-bytes of me read data R1(2) associated with roe first read operation R] may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322. The receiving component may also assert the Read Ack 324 signal.<br>
[0056] In he eighth clock cycle 315, the sending component may temporarily suspend broadcasting write data to initiate a new write operation followed by a new read operation. This may be achieved by broadcasting an address location W2 associated with a second write operation as Address A and an address location associated with a third read operation R3 as Address B over the Transmit Channel 318, setting the read/write indicator signal R/W A 306 to "0," setting the read/write indicator signal R/W B 312 to "1," asserting the AValidA 304 and AValidB 310 signals, and indicating to the receiving component the size of the payload using the SizeA 308 and SizeB 314 signals. In this case, the payload size for both the write and read operations is 16-bytes.<br>
10057) During the same eighth clock cycle 315, the first 8-bytes of the read data R2(l) associated with the second read operation R2 may be retrieved by the receiving<br><br>
WO 2005/071557	PPCT/US2005/00159<br>
component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322. The receiving component may also assert the Read Ack 324 signal.<br>
{0058) In the ninth clock cycle 317, the sending component may deassert the AValidA 304 and the AValidB 310 signals indicating to the receiving component that the sending component will resume broadcasting write data on the Transmit Channel 318. With the Write Ack 320 signal still asserted, the sending component may broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 the third 8-bytes of the write data Wi(3) associated with the first write operation W1- The receiving component may write the data to the appropriate block of 8 address locations.<br>
(0059] Concurrently, the second 8-bytes of the read data R2(2) associated with the second read operation R2 may be retrieved from the receiving component and the broadcast on the Read Channel 322. With this broadcast, the receiving component has completed both read operations initialed by the sending component during the second clock cycle 303, and therefore, may deassert the Read Ack 324 signal Due to the read latency of the receiving component, it may not ready to broadcast the read data associated with the third read operation R3<br>
[0060] With the Write Ack 320 signal still assarted through the twelfth clock cycle 323, the sending component may broadcast on the Transmit Channel 318 the final 8-bytes of the write data W1(4) associated with the first write operation W) in the tenth clock cycle 319. The sending component may also broadcast the first 8-bytes of the write data W2(1) associated with the second write operation W2 in the eleventh clock cycle 321 and the last 8-bytes of the write data W2(2) associated with the second write operation W2 in the twelfth clock cycle 323. The receiving component may write this data to the appropriate block of 16 address locations. With this broadcast, the outstanding write operations are complete, and therefore, the receiving component may deassert the Write Ack 320 signal in the following clock cycle 325.<br>
[0061] In the twelfth clock cycle 323, the first 8-bytes of the read data R3(l) associated with the third read operation R3 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322. La the following clock cycle 325, the second 8-bytes of read data R3(2) associated with the third read operation R3 may be retrieved from the receiving component and broadcast on the Read Channel 322. At the<br><br>
