COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
        (See Section 10)<br><br><br><br>
	A WATER - DISPERSIBLE PARTICLE COMPRISING<br>
POLYMERIC DEPOSITION MATERIAL<br>
TREATMENT FOR SUBSTRATES<br><br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
TREATMENT FOR SUBSTRATES <br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a material comprising a benefit agent and a deposition aid for deposition of the benefit agent onto a substrate. It further relates to a method of depositing a benefit agent from a dispersion onto<br>
a substrate.<br><br>
Background of the Invention â€¢<br>
Conventionally the deposition of the benefit agent from a treatment composition depends upon the attractive forces between the oppositely charged substrate and the benefit agent.  Such adverse charge considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an opposite charge to that of the benefit agent.  For example, cotton is negatively charged and thus requires a positively charged benefit agent in- order for the benefit agent to be substantive to the cotton, i.e. to have an affinity for the cotton so as to absorb onto it.  Often the substantivity of the benefit agent is reduced and/or the deposition rate of the material is reduced because of the presence of incompatible charged species in the compositions.<br>
Alternatively, when deposition of a conventional benefit agent is effected by mechanisms that do not rely upon charge interaction but upon other non-covalent forces, for example so:: 1 release polymers, other problems may occur, namely<br><br><br>
where interaction of an anionic surfactant with the benefit agent can also make the material so negatively charged and/or soluble as to overcome the other attractive interactions.<br>
Furthermore, there is frequently another complication in achieving optimum deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, in that, the need for solubility of the benefit agent in the medium used to treat the substrate is in principle, incompatible with the requirement for the benefit agent to deposit/adsorb onto the substrate.<br>
WO 00/18861 describes a water soluble or water disperable polysaccharide based rebuild agent for deposition onto fabric during a treatment process wherein a benefit agent is attached to the rebuild agent.  However the significance of the particle size for deposition has not been recognised by this document<br>
The present invention is directed tpwards materials for solving one or more of the above problems.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides water-dispersible particle wherein the material comprises:<br>
i)   one or more polymeric materials having an average repeat unit (I):<br><br><br><br>
.( I )<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R groups of the polymer are independently selected from H, a hydrolysable group or a linker group in which when R is a hydrolysable group the degree of substitution is 0 to 3 and when R is a linker group the degree of substitution is 0.01 to 3;<br>
(ii)  a benefit agent attached to the deposition<br>
enhancing part; characterised in that the particle has a particle size from 20 to 5,000 nm<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution<br>
A second aspect of the present invention also provides a method of depositing a benefit agent onto a substrate by applying said material to the substrate.<br><br><br>
A third aspect of the present invention also provides compositions comprising a material according to the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
The Material-Deposition Enhancing Part<br>
The, deposition enhancing part of the material comprises:<br>
ii)  one or more depositing polymeric materials having an average repeat unit (I):<br><br><br>
( I )<br><br>
wherein at least one or more R groups of the polymer are independently selected from H, a hydrolysable group or a linker group in which when R is a hydrolysable group the degree of substitution is 0 to 3 and when R is a linker group the degree of substitution is 0.01 to 3;<br>
Deposition onto a substrate includes deposition by adsorotion, co-crystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.<br><br><br><br>
The deposition enhancing part has a polymeric backbone and is attached to the benefit agent. The benefit agent may be physically impregnated inside particles, which contain the deposition enhancing part.<br>
The polymeric backbone is chosen to have an affinity for the substrate onto which it is to be deposited. It is especially preferred that the polymeric backbone is of a similar chemical composition to the substrate onto which it is to be deposited.<br>
For example, if the fabric is cellulosic in nature, e.g. cotton, the polymeric backbone is preferably cellulose or a cellulose derivative or a another (3-1, 4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as mannan and glucomannan.<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occuring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate, at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
The average degree of substitution of these pendant groups which undergo the chemical charge is preferably from 0.1 to 3 (e.g. from 0.3 to 3), more preferably from 0.1 to 1 (e.g. from 0.3 to 1).<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring    polysaccharaides   have     at   least   some<br><br><br>
degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are therefore not in themselves counted in the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups.  The pendant groups can be bonded chemically or by other bonding mechanism, to these hydroxyl groups by any means described hereinbelow.  The "average degree of substitution" means the average number of pendant groups per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings whether they form part of a linear backbone or are themselves, pendant side groups in the polysaccharide.<br>
Preferred hydrolysable or linker groups are preferabley selected from one or more of acetate, propanoate, trifluroacetate, 2- (2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, crotonate, isovalerate cinnamate, formate, salicylate, carbamate, methylcarbamate, benzoate, gluconate, mechanesulphonate, toluene, sulphonate, groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, malonic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, aspartic, glutamic, and malic acids.<br>
It is prefererable if the hydrolysable group(s) is/are selected from carboxylic acid esters<br><br><br>
It is advantageous if the linker group(s) is/are selected from amines, methacrylates, acrylates, thiols or mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred such groups are the monoacetate,<br>
hemisuccinate,	and        2- (2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate.<br>
The term "monoacetate" is used herein to denote those acetates with the degree of substitution of 1 or less on a cellulose or other Â£-1,4 polysaccharide backbone.<br>
The molecular weight  of  the deposition enhancing part of  the particle may typically be in the  range of  1,000  to 50,000 000,  more preferably 10,000  to  500,000.<br>
The Material  -  Benefit Agent Groups<br>
The benefit agent  groups may be  selected from any groups which is used to  impart desirable properties  to  the substrate upon which the material  of the present  invention is to be deposited.     The benefit  agent group may be,   in          particular,   one which imparts  a  desirable .property to  a             fabric household surface dish or  cutlery  surface,   skin,                hair   teeth or nail  substrate,   especially to a  fabric<br>
   substrate.     In practice,   a material  according to  the present invention may comprise  two  or more benefit  agent  groups   on the  same particle,   either of  the  same  kind or  of  different kinds.<br>
    For hydrophobic  benefit  agents  groups,   the  deposition     enhancing part   should be  sufficient  to make  the material water dispersible.<br><br><br>
The material of the present invention must comprise at least one deposition enhancing moiety and at least one benefit agent moiety.  However, dependent upon the nature of each moiety, the weight ratio of deposition aid moiety to benefit agent moiety is preferably from 1:1 to 1:10,000, more preferably from 1:5 to 1:5,000 and most preferably from 1:10 to 1:500.<br>
According to the benefit agent type(s) , the material of the present invention may, for example be incorporated in liquid or solid fabric treatment compositions, laundry (wash) compositions, household cleaning compositions, hand and machine dishwashing compositions, or personal care compositions.<br>
It is especially preferred if the benefit agent gives a perceivable benefit to a fabric.<br>

wash compositions may include a fabric softening agent and<br>
rinse-added fabric softening compositions may include<br>
surface-active compounds, particularly non-ionic surface-<br>
active compounds, if appropriate.	<br><br><br>
The detergent compositions of the invention may contain a surface-active compound (surfactant) which may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, catiohic, non-ionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surface-active compounds and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surface-active corapounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred detergent-active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and non-ionic compounds.<br>

Substrate<br>
The substrate may be any substrate onto which it is desirable to deposit benefit agents and which is subjected to treatment such as a washing or rinsing process.<br>
In particular, the substrate may be fabric or of a personal nature such as hair, skin, teeth or nails, or of a domestic<br><br><br>
nature such as dishes, ceramics, metal, plastics or upholstery.<br>
It has been found that particular good results are achieved when using a natural fabric substrate such as cotton, or fabric blends containing cotton.<br>
Treatment<br>
The treatment of the substrate with the material of the invention can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing of the substrate.<br>
Typically the treatment will involve a washing or rinsing method such as treatment in the main wash or rinse cycle of a washing machine and involves contacting the substrate with an aqueous medium comprising the material of the invention.<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples:-<br>
Example 1 (Amine modified cellulose monoacetate):<br>
Cellulose monoacetate (CMA) with a degree of acetate substitution of 0.6 and molecular weight of 16000 (DS=0.6, mw=16k) was prepared according to method described in WO 00/18860.<br>
Cellulose monoacetate (DS=0.6, mw=16k) (2.0 g) was dissolved in dimethyl acetamide (30 ml) and stirred. The solution was heated to 50 Â°C and carbonyl diimidazole (0.87 g) was added.<br><br><br>
After 3 hours the solution was added dropwise to ethylene diamine (20 ml) and stirred at 25 Â°C for 30 min.  The amine modified cellulose monoacetate polymer was isolated from the solution by precipitation into acetone (600 ml), filtering (to remove the liquid), dissolving in water, filtering (to remove any water-insoluble fraction) and then freeze-drying to give a white coloured solid.<br>
Example 2 (Attaching the polymer from Example 1 to polystyrene particles in water)<br>
The following buffer solutions were prepared:<br>
Buffer A: 0.02 M, pH 6, phosphate buffer<br>
Made by mixing 0.02 M Na2HP04 and 0.02 M NaH2P04 to give pH =<br>
6.0.<br>
Buffer B: 0.01.M, pH 7, phosphate buffer<br>
Made by mixing 0.01M Na2HP04 and 0.01 M Na2H2P04 to give pH =<br>
7.0<br>
Buffer C: O.1 M, pH 9. 6,   carbonate buffer<br>
Made by mixing 0.1 M Na2C03 and 0.1 M NaHC03 to give pH =<br>
9.6.<br>
Polystyrene latex (ex. Polysciences Inc, carboxyl functional, fluorescent, mean diameter = 0.5 Jim, 2.6 % solids) (1 ml) was washed via the following procedure: Firstly diluted with Buffer C (0.5 ml) and mixed (Fison Whirlimixer).  The latex was centrifuged at 130000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant decanted off, end the latex particles re-dispersed in Buffer B (1 ml). The latex was<br><br><br>
centrifuged at 130000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant decanted off, and the latex particles re-dispersed in Buffer A (1 ml) . This was repeated 2 times. The latex was centrifuged at 130000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant decanted off, and the latex particles re-dispersed in ethyl dimethyl aminopropyl carbodimide solution (0.025 g in 1 ml of Buffer A) and stirred at 25 Â°C for 3 hours. The latex was centrifuged at 130000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant decanted off, and the latex particles re-dispersed in Buffer B (1 ml) . This was repeated.  The latex was centrifuged at 130000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant decanted off, and the latex particles re-dispersed in amine modified cellulose monoacetate (prepared in Example 1) solution (0.0138 g in 1 ml of Buffer B) and stirred at 25 Â°C for 18 hours. The latex was centrifuged at 130000 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant decanted off, and the latex particles re-dispersed in Buffer B (1 ml) . This was repeated.<br>
The procedure described above used particles with an initial size of 0.5 urn. A range of similar particles with sizes 0.1, 1 and 4.5 ÂµM were also obtained (ex polyseiences Inc:, carboxyl functional, fluorescent, 2.6 % solids). These were also modified using the same method. Except for the 0.1 Âµm particles which required ultra-centrifugation (60,000 RPM for 1 hour) for each separation phase to sediment particles from the liquor. They also required the addition of 4 ml of buffer at each buffer addition stage.<br><br>
Example 3 (Deposition of particles under model wash conditions)<br>
A model wash solution (pH 10.5 containing 1 g/1 surfactant) was prepared by dissolving Na2C03 (0.7546 g) , NaHC03 (0.2419 g), LAS active paste (1 g, Petrelab 550, ex. Petrelab) and Symperonic A7 (0.5 g, ex. ICI) in de-ionised water (997.5 g).<br>
Non-fluoresced cotton and polyester fabric circles (4 cm diameter) were placed in the bottom of plastic bottles. The bottle diameter was such that the fabric samples covered the base and lay flat. Model wash solution was added (36 ml) to each bottle and the original unmodified dispersion and cellulose modified variant (from example 2) were added to give concentrations of 5 and 10 ppm. Controls containing model wash solution (36 ml) and fabric circles (4 cm) were also prepared. Prior to beginning the wash a small sample was removed from each bottle (5 ml) . The bottles were then agitated for 1 hour at 40Â° C (shaker bath, ex. Gallenkamp) removed and the  fabric  circles dried on adsorbent paper towel.<br>
This wash procedure was used for each of the different sized particle dispersions. <br>
Example 4 (Determination of degree of deposition on fabric circles)<br>
The percentage of material deposited in example 3 was determined by fluorescence depletion i.e. measuring the loss<br><br><br>
of fluorescence of the wash liquor before and after the wash cycle. The fluorescence of the fabric itself was also measured after washing. A Perkin Elmer Luminescence Spectrophotometer was used for all fluorescence measurements and a calibration plot was used to convert fluorescence intensities into percentages of deposited materials.<br>
The percentage depositions determined by fluorescence depletion, with respect to particle size and fabric type are shown in tables 1 and 2:<br>
Table 2<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br>
The percentage depositions determined by fluorescence measured directly from the fabric after washing, with respect to particle size for cotton are shown table 3:<br>
Table 3<br><br>
The tables above show that Examples according to the invention deposit at a higher level than the comparative Examples.<br><br>
