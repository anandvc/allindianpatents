provided Ri and/or R2 of compound (1) stand for hydroxy.<br>
The reaction conditions can be chosen as described for the synthesis of compounds (1) or (1a) above.<br>
Generally, a mixture of compounds (1) resp. (1a) and (2) resp. (2a) can be obtained either by simply mixing the two components or by adjusting the above reaction conditions for the manufacture of (1) in such a way that compounds (1) resp. (1a) and (2) resp.

t is also possible to use solid solutions comprising at least two colour forming compounds.<br>
^ monophase (or single-phase or guest-host) solid solution possesses a crystal lattice vhich is identical with the crystal lattice of one of its components. One component is embedded as the 'guest' in the crystal lattice of the other component, which acts as the 'host1. The X-ray diffraction pattern of such a monophase solid solution is substantially identical to that of one of the components, called the 'host*. Within certain limits, different proportions of the components produce almost identical results.<br>
In the literature, the definitions by the various authors, such as, G.H.Van't Hoff, A.I.Kitaigorodsky and A.Whitacker for solid solutions and mixed crystals are often contradictory, (cf, e.g. 'Analytical Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes', Chapter 10/page 269, Editor K.Venkataraman, J.Wiley, New York, 1977).<br>
The term 'monophase solid solution1 or 'multiphase solid solution1 or mixed crystal', as defined herein, therefore, should be taken from the following definitions, which have been adapted to the current improved state of knowledge of such systems: A monophase (or single-phase or guest-host) solid solution possesses a crystal lattice, which is identical with the crystal lattice of one of its components. One component is embedded as the 'guest' in the crystal lattice of the other component, which acts as the 'host1. The X-ray diffraction pattern of such a monophase solid solution is substantially identical to that of one of the components, called the 'host'. Within certain limits, different proportions of the components produce almost identical results.<br><br>
A multiphase solid solution possesses no precise, uniform crystal lattice. It differs from a physical mixture of its components in that the crystal lattice of at least one of its components is partially or competely altered. In comparison to a physical mixture of the components, which gives an X-ray diffraction diagram that is additive of the diagrams seen for the individual components. The signals in the X-ray diffraction diagram of a multiphase solid solution are broadened, shifted or altered in intensity. In general, different proportions of the components produce different results.<br>
A mixed crystal (or solid compound type) solid solution possesses a precise composition and a uniform crystal lattice, which is different from the crystal lattices of all its components. If different proportions of the components lead, within certain limits, to the same result, then a solid solution is present in which the mixed crystal acts as a host. For the avoidance of doubt it may also be pointed out that, inter alia, there may also be amorphous structures and mixed aggregates consisting of different particles of different physical type, such as, for example, an aggregate of different components each in pure crystal modification. Such amorphous structures and mixed aggregates cannot be equated with either solid solutions or mixed crystals, and possess different fundamental properties.<br>

The monophase solid solutions can be used singly or as a mixture with other colour forming compounds such as triphenylmethanes, lactones, fluorans, benzoxazines and spiropyrans; or they may also be used together with further black colour forming compounds. Examples of such other colour forming compounds are given hereinbefore.<br>
The monophase solid solutions can be prepared by a variety of methods. One such method is the recrystallisation method wherein a physical mixture of the desired components is dissolved, with or without heating, in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture. Suitable solvents include but are not limited to toluene, benzene, xylene, dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or mixtures of these solvents with each other and with water. The monophase solid solution is then isolated by crystallisation from the solvent or solvent mixture. This can be brought about by cooling, standing, addition of a further solvent to promote crystallisation or concentration by standard means such as distillation, steam distillation and vacuum distillation. When the monophase solid solution is isolated by concentration it may be advantageous to do so in the presence of a small amount of base, to improve the visual aspect of the isolated product.<br>
Alternatively, monophase solid solutions can be prepared from mixtures of the appropriate starting materials. The technique can be used to produce mixtures of two or more fluorans<br><br>
or phthalides. For example, mixtures of two fluorans are produced by replacing a single starting material with two analogous materials to the same total molar concentration in the reaction. In the case of fluorans, these starting materials are derivatives of amino phenols, phthalic anhydrides, keto acids and diphenylamines.<br>
Usually, the molar ratio of colour developer or colour developers to colour forming compound or compounds is chosen in the range of from 20:1 to 0.1:1, preferably from 5:1 to 0.5:1, more preferably from 4:1 to 1:1.<br>

Usually the heat sensitive recording layer coating composition is applied to the support in an amount in the range of from 1 to 10 g/m2, preferably from 2 to 7 g/m2 on a dry weight basis. The heat sensitive recording layer coating composition may be applied to the support by a known coating device such as a coating bar, a roll coater, an air knife coater, a blade coater, a gravure coater, a die coater or a curtain coater.<br>
If desired, an undercoat layer can also be provided between the support and the heat sensitive recording layer in order to improve the thermal sensitivity and efficiency during recording. The undercoat layer is formed by coating the support with an undercoat layer coating composition comprising as main components organic hollow particles and/or an oil absorbing pigment and a binder and then drying the coating.<br>
Representative examples of oil absorbing pigments include clay, calcined clay, amorphous silica, precipitated calcium carbonate and talc. The average pigment diameter may be in the range 0.01 to 5 (jm, preferably from 0.02 to 3 pm.<br><br>

The outside diameter of the organic hollow particle may be in the range of 0.5 to 10 pm, preferably from 1 to 5 pm.<br>
The organic hollow particles may be expandable hollow particles. A typical example of such expandable hollow particles are microcapsules having an average diameter of 0.1 to 5 pm comprising a vinylidene chloride resin shell and butane gas as fill material. When a support coated with an undercoat layer comprising such expandable hollow particles is subjected to heat treatment, the microcapsules may expand to an average particle diameter in the range of e.g. 1 to 30 pm.<br>
When the oil absorbing pigment is used in combination with the organic hollow particles, the combined amount of the two components is preferably chosen in the range of from 40 to 90 weight-%, particularly from 50 to 80 weight-%, based on the undercoat layer.<br>
Preferably, the binder used in the undercoat layer is selected from the binders to be used in the heat sensitive recording layer and particularly preferred examples are styrene-butadiepe latex, a polyvinyl alcohol or starch-vinyl acetate copolymer.

Generally, the undercoat recording layer coating composition is applied to the support in an amount in the range of from 2 to 20 g/m2, preferably from 4 to12 g/m2 on a dry weight basis.<br>
If desired, a protective layer may be provided on the heat sensitive recording layer to enhance the resistance of the recorded image to water and chemicals, for example, oils, fats, alcohols, plasticisers and the like to improve the runability during recording. Usually, the protective layer is formed by coating the heat sensitive recording layer with a protective layer coating composition comprising as main components a binder having film-forming ability and optionally, a pigment and/or an insolubiliser and/or a lubricant and then drying the resulting coating film.<br><br>
Representative examples of the binder to be used in the protective layer coating composition include e.g. polyvinyl alcohol (fully or partially hydrolysed), carboxy-modified polyvinyl alcohol, acetoacetyl-modified polyvinyl alcohol, diacetone-modified polyvinyl alcohol, silicon-modified polyvinyl alcohol, starches, gelatine, caesin, gum arabic, derivatives of cellulose such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and acetyl cellulose, starch vinyl acetate graft copolymers, styrene-maleic anhydride co-polymers, methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymers, isopropylene-maleic anhydride copolymers and like water-soluble resins, styrene-butadiene latex, acrylic latex, urethane latex and like water-dispersible resins and mixtures thereof.<br>
The pigment, insolubiliser, lubricant and, if required, other auxiliaries may be chosen from those above described in the heat sensitive recording layer coating composition.<br>
The protective layer coating composition preferably is applied in an amount in the range of from 0.5 to 10 g/m2, preferably from 1 to 5 g/m2 on a dry weight basis and may be applied with a similar coating device to that used to coat the heat sensitive layer.<br>
It is also possible to provide a protective layer, an adhesive layer and a magnetic layer on the rear side of the support.<br>
In particular the invention provides exceptional resistance to plasticiser, oil and heat ageing whilst showing improved background whiteness.<br>
