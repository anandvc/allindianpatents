				<td>Deep Rolling Machine for Crankshafts<br>
The invention concerns a deep rolling machine for<br>
crankshafts in accordance with the preamble of: Patent<br>
Claim 1. This type of deep rolling machine, in particular<br>
a deep rolling unit, is known from the German utility<br>
patent DE 297 13 627 U1 and the corresponding European<br>
patent, EP 0 881 041 B1.<br>
The patent holder has been building a deep rolling<br>
machine known from these patents for several years which<br>
has proven itself very successful in use. At the same<br>
time, the existing machine has several features which<br>
prompted us to further develop and improve it.<br>
Accordingly, the objective of the present invention is to<br>
simplify and improve the existing deep rolling machine.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this task is solved by<br>
the properties of patent claim 1.<br>
Beneficial forms and variations of the deep rolling<br>
machine are the subject of the sub-claims related to<br>
patent claim 1.<br>
A series of significant advantages arise from the<br>
solution. For example, we were able to significantly<br>
reduce the peak height, i.e. the height above floor level<br>
of the axis of the rotary drive for the crankshaft.<br>
Whereas the peak height of the existing machine was 1,400<br>
mm, the peak height of the enhanced machine was lowered<br>
to 1,100 mm. Thus, the enhanced machine can be better<br>
SI/cs 050417WO<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
integrated with the remaining machinery for processing<br>
crankshafts as no lifting platform is necessary. The<br>
splash lubrication of the deep rolling tools was also<br>
improved. The routings of cables and hoses to the<br>
individual deep rolling unit of the deep rolling machine<br>
were simplified. The weight balance of the deep rolling<br>
unit for the suspension system in the machine was<br>
improved. Finally, the modifications allowed a common<br>
pressure medium, compressed oil, to be used to operate<br>
both the power unit and the piston cylinder unit which<br>
supports the suspension of the deep rolling unit on the<br>
suspension system elastically.<br>
The following section describes the invention with a<br>
design example.<br>
The following figures are schematic and show on a smaller<br>
scale:<br>
-	Fig. 1 Side view of a deep rolling unit in the open<br>
position.<br>
-	Fig. 2 Side view of a deep rolling unit in the closed<br>
position.<br>
If we view the deep rolling machine (1) from the<br>
operating side (2), a first and second shearing arm (3<br>
and 4) follow, which are connected with articulation by a<br>
first rotating joint (5). The first shearing arm (3), the<br>
second shearing arm (4) and the first rotating joint (5)<br>
form a deep rolling unit in shear-type construction, of<br>
which there are several in the deep rolling machine (1).<br>
The deep rolling machine (1) for crankshafts (not shown)<br>
has a rotary drive (not shown) for the crankshaft, which<br>
can be rotated around an axis (6). The two shearing arms<br>
SI/cs 050417WO<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
(3 and 4) each carry parts of a deep rolling tool (15),<br>
i.e. a work roller head (9) and a support roller head<br>
(10) opposite one another, at the first ends (7 and 8) of<br>
the axis (6) facing the axis (6). The two shearing arms<br>
(3 and 4) at the second ends (11 and 12) facing away from<br>
the axis (6) are driven by a power unit (13) connected<br>
between them.<br>
This is followed by a suspension system (14) for each<br>
deep rolling unit (15) of the deep rolling machine (1),<br>
which can be moved and locked in place along a crossbeam<br>
(16) on the deep rolling machine (1) in the direction of<br>
the axis (6) .<br>
The power unit (13) between the two second ends (11 and<br>
12) of the shearing arms (3 and 4) generates a closing<br>
and opening movement and the deep rolling force of the<br>
deep rolling unit (15) at the corresponding first ends (7<br>
and 8) of the two shearing arms (3 and 4). When the deep<br>
rolling unit (15) opens, the two first ends (7 and 8)<br>
open to an opening width (18) greater than twice the<br>
construction radius (17) of a crankshaft.<br>
The second shearing arm (4) is hinged on a first shank<br>
(19) of a first crank lever (21) which is attached to the<br>
suspension system (14) with a pivot motion via a second<br>
rotating joint (20). The second shank (22) of the first<br>
crank lever (21) is connected to a piston cylinder unit<br>
(23) which in turn is connected to the suspension system<br>
(14) . The outline of the first crank lever (21) in Fiigure<br>
1 is drawn with hatching to increase the clarity.<br>
The first end (8) of the second shearing arm (4) is<br>
supported on the suspension system (14) via a roller<br>
SI/cs 050417WO<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
(24). The web (25) of the roller (24) for the suspension<br>
system (14) is curved.<br>
With the first end (26), the power unit (13) is connected<br>
with articulation via a second crank lever (27) and a<br>
third and fourth joint (28 and 29) to the second end (12)<br>
of the second shearing arm (4). Until this point, the<br>
present deep rolling machine 1 is largely the same as the<br>
deep rolling machine which is familiar from the state-of-<br>
the-art mentioned above.<br>
In contrast to the familiar arrangement, the power unit<br>
(13) is aligned in the direction of the exertion of force<br>
(30) within a gate (31) and can be moved along it. With<br>
its second end (32), the power unit (13) is connected<br>
with articulation via a fifth joint (33) to the second<br>
end (11) of the first shearing arm (3).<br>
The free end (34) of the gate (31) is fitted with a back<br>
up roller (35) routed along a curved web (36), which has<br>
a gap in the second end (11) of the first shearing arm<br>
(3). If the power unit (13) increases the distance<br>
between its joints (28 and 33), the curved web (36) and<br>
the back up roller (35) change the position of the second<br>
crank lever (27) and the shearing arms (3 and 4) so that<br>
the ends (7 and 8) approach one another. This results in<br>
the image in F'igure 2.<br>
As Figure 2 shows, the third (28), fourth (29) and fifth<br>
joints (33) form a triangle (37) when the deep rolling<br>
unit (15) is in the closed position where a, b and c are<br>
the sides of the triangle. The direction of force<br>
exertion (30) between the third and fifth joints (28 and<br>
33) forms one side (a) of the triangle (37). The other<br>
SI/cs 050417WO<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
side of the triangle (c) is formed by the direct<br>
connection line (38) between the fourth and fifth joints<br>
(29 and 33). As a result of this layout, the third joint<br>
(28), as a corner of the triangle (37), points to the<br>
first rotating joint (5). In order to stabilise the<br>
closed position, a limit stop (39) is also incorporated,<br>
which is reached by the second crank lever (27) on the<br>
second end (12) of the second shearing arm (4). The<br>
curved web (36) is designed such that it generates a<br>
constant torque while the deep rolling unit (15) closes.<br>
The curved web (36) has a straight section (43) for the<br>
working area of the power unit (13) for deep rolling.<br>
The suspension system (14) protrudes beneath the<br>
crossbeam (16) and ends in a resiliently flexible element<br>
(40). The piston cylinder unit (23) is connected to the<br>
suspension system (14) via the resiliently flexible<br>
element (40). Joints (41 and 42) are located between the<br>
second shank (22) of the first crank lever (21) and the<br>
resiliently flexible element (40) and the piston cylinder<br>
unit (23). While in the state-of-the-art mentioned at the<br>
beginning, a power element comparable to the pi ston<br>
cylinder unit (23) was charged with a gaseous pressure<br>
medium due to the required elasticity of the suspension<br>
of the deep rolling unit, this can be achieved by<br>
charging the piston cylinder unit (23) with a liquid<br>
pressure medium such as hydraulic oil, for example, due<br>
to the elasticity of the resiliently flexible element<br>
(40). This is the same pressure medium used to operate<br>
the power unit (13). The advantage of this arrangement is<br>
that only a single, liquid pressure medium is required<br>
for the deep rolling machine (1). The previous state-of-<br>
the-art deep rolling machine required two pressure media,<br>
a gaseous medium and a liquid medium.<br>
