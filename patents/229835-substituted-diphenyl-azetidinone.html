Description<br>
Novel diphenylazetidinone with improved physiological characteristics, corresponding production method, medicaments containing said compound and use of the latter<br>
The invention relates to a substituted diphenylazetidinone, to its physiologically acceptable salts and to physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
Diphenylazetidinones and their use for treating hyperlipidemia and also arteriosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia have already been described (WO 02/50027).<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide a compound which, compared to the compounds described in WO 02/50027, has considerably better solubility in the upper small intestine in the pre- and/or postprandial state. The improved solubility of the compound ensures higher availability of dissolved substance at the site of action and thus improved efficacy.<br>
FaSSIF (Fasted State Simulating Intestinal Fluid) and FeSSIF (Fed State Simulating Intestinal Fluid) media which reflect the pH/solubilization conditions in the upper small intestine in the pre- and postprandial state, respectively, were used to test this improved solubility. It was another object of the invention to provide a compound which, compared to the compounds described in WO 02/50027, has increased stability both in the acidic range (stomach) and in the weakly alkaline range (small intestine). This property leads to fewer byproducts/cleavage products which for their part may have unwanted side-effects. However, increased stability in the acidic range is also a great advantage for formulation since in this case there is no need for an acid-resistant capsule/tablet.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to the compounds of the formula I<br>
REPLACEMENT SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts.<br>
Because they are more soluble in water than the starting compounds or basis compounds, pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must possess a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts of the compound according to the invention are salts of inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, nitric acid and sulfuric acid, and also of organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, glycolic acid, isethionic acid, lactic acid, lactobionic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, methanesulfonic acid, succinic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and tartaric acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium salts and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium salts and calcium salts), trometamol (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol), diethanolamine, lysine or ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts containing an anion which is not pharmaceutical^ acceptable, such as, for example, trifluoroacetate, also belong within the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for preparing or purifying pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic applications, for example in-vitro applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative", which is used here, denotes any physiologically acceptable derivative of a compound of the formula I according to the invention, e.g. an ester which is able, on being<br><br>
administered to a mammal, such as a human, to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
The physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compound according to the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et at., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs may or may not themselves be active.<br>
The compound according to the invention can also be present in different polymorphic forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphic forms. All the polymorphic forms of the compound according to the invention belong within the scope of the invention and are another aspect of the invention.<br>
In that which follows, all references to "compound(s) according to formula I" relate to (a) compound(s) of the formula I as described above and to its (their) salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
An aryl radical is to be understood as meaning a phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, alpha- or beta-tetralone, indanyl or indan-1-onyl radical.<br>
The compound(s) of the formula (I) can also be administered in combination with (an) other active compound(s).<br>
The quantity of a compound according to formula I which is required in order to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, e.g. the specific compound which is selected, the intended use, the type of administration and the clinical state of the patient. In general, the daily dose lies in a range from 0.01 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.05 mg to 50 mg) per day per kilogram of body weight, e.g. 0.1-10 mg/kg/day.<br>
Single dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as tablets or capsules, can, for example, contain from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. While the compounds according to formula I can themselves be used as the compound for treating the abovementioned conditions, they<br><br>
are preferably present, together with an acceptable carrier, in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. The carrier naturally has to be acceptable, in the sense that it is compatible with the other constituents of the composition and is not harmful to the health of the patient. The carrier can be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Other pharmaceutical^ active substances can also be present, including other compounds according to formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared using one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist in mixing the constituents with pharmacologically acceptable carrier substances and/or auxiliary substances.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those which are suitable for oral and peroral (e.g. sublingual) administration even if the most suitable mode of administration depends, in each individual case, on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound according to formula I which is in each case employed. Sugar-coated formulations and sugar-coated delayed-release formulations also belong within the scope of the invention. Formulations which are acid-resistant and gastric juice-resistant are preferred. Suitable gastric juice-resistant coatings include cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration can be present in separate units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets which in each case contain a specific quantity of the compound according to formula I; as powders or granulates; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or a water-in-oil emulsion. As has already been mentioned, these compositions can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active compound and the carrier (which can consist of one or more additional constituents) are brought into contact. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and homogeneously mixing the active compound with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is molded, if necessary. Thus, a tablet can be prepared, for example, by<br><br>
means of a powder or granulate of the compound being pressed or molded, where appropriate together with one or more additional constituents. Pressed tablets can be prepared by tableting the compound in freely flowing form, such as a powder or granulate, which is mixed, where appropriate, with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or a (several) surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be prepared by molding the pulverulent compound, which is moistened with an inert, liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration include lozenges which contain a compound according to formula I together with a flavoring agent, usually sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastils, which include the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
The following are suitable to use as additional active compounds for the combination preparations:<br>
all the antidiabetics which are named in chapter 12 in the Roten Liste [Red List] 2003. They can be combined with compounds of the formula I according to the invention, particularly for the purpose of synergistically improving the effect. The active compound combination can be administered either by separately administering the active compounds to the patient or administering them in the form of combination preparations in which several active compounds are present in one pharmaceutical preparation.

Process A for preparing the compound of the formula I is characterized in that the amine of the formula II (see WO 02/50027) is, in a peptide coupling reaction, reacted with the monoglucamide of 1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic acid (formula III) where the hydroxyl functions of the glucamine moiety may be protected, for example by acyl groups such as acetyl groups or by ether groups such as benzyl ether groups, to give a compound of the formula IV. This reaction can be carried out using, for example, N-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt) and N-ethyl-N'^S-dimethylaminopropyOcarbodiimide (EDC) at room temperature, using, for example, as solvent dimethylformamide (DMF). It is also possible to use other peptide coupling reagents and solvents or solvent mixtures (see, for example, A. Speicher et al. in Journal fur Praktische Chemie/Chemiker-Zeitung (1998), 340, 581-583; Y.S. Klausner and M. Bodansky, Synthesis, (1972), 453 ff; K. Ishihara et al., J. Org. Chem., 61, 4196 (1996); M. Kunishima et al., Tetrahedron 55, 13159-13170 (1999) or else R.C. Larock: Comprehensive Organic Transformations; VCH, New York, 1989, page 981 ff).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
With heating, 4.6 g (20 mmol) of dodecanoic acid are dissolved in 40 ml of dry THF, 0.73 ml (10 mmol) of thionyl chloride is added slowly and the mixture is stirred at RT for 30 min. 0.8 ml (20 mmol) of dry methanol is then added slowly and the mixture is stirred at RT for 4 h; the mixture is then allowed to stand at RT for 4 days. After this period of time, TLC shows no further conversion; the reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is triturated with water (ultrasonic bath). The precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed with water and again filtered off with suction. The moist residue is triturated with dichloromethane (ultrasonic bath), filtered through a pleated filter and washed with dichloromethane, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. This gives monomethyl dodecanedioate (3.09 g) in a yield of 63%. MW: 244.34; MS: 245.4 (M+H+).<br>
2.)      Synthesis   of   methyl    11-((4R,6R)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(R)-hydroxy-2-(S)-hydroxyhexylcarbamoyl)undecanoate:<br>
At room temperature, 3.07 g (12.6 mmol) of monomethyl dodecanedioate are dissolved in 30 ml of dry DMF, 2.2 g (12.1 mmol) of glucamine, 1.9 g (12.4 mmol) of HOBt and 2.4 g (12.5 mmol) of EDC are added and the mixture is stirred at RT for 6 h. The mixture is allowed to stand at RT overnight. The next day, TLC shows complete conversion. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and dried under high vacuum. The residue is triturated with water (ultrasonic bath), filtered off with suction, washed with water and filtered off with suction. The moist crude<br><br>
product is triturated with dichloromethane, filtered off with suction, washed   with   dichloromethane   and   dried.   This   gives   methyl 11-((4R,6R)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(R)-hydroxy-2(S)-hydroxyhexyl-carbamoyl)undecanoate.     4.45 g     (90%     yield).     MW: 407.51; MS: 408.20 (M+H+).<br><br>
At room temperature, 4.45 g (10.9 mmol) of methyl 11 -((4R,6R)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(R)-hydroxy-2-(S)-hydroxyhexyl-carbamoyl)undecanoate are suspended in 75 ml of dry ethanol, and 25 ml of water and 2.2 g of KOH (85% strength) (33 mmol) are added. After 2 h of stirring at 80°C, TLC shows complete conversion. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure; the residue is dissolved in water and acidified with cone, hydrochloric acid. The precipitated crude product is filtered off with suction, washed with water and filtered off with suction. The moist crude product is recrystallized from about 100 ml of ethanol, filtered while hot and precipitated in an ice bath. The precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed with ethanol and dried. This gives 2.2 g (51%) of 11-((4R,6R)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(R)-hydroxy-2-(S)-hydroxyhexyl-carbamoyl)undecanoic acid.

With gentle heating, 0.63 g (1.45 mmol) of benzylamine II (preparation see DE 10064398) and 0.65 g (1.65 mmol) of the diacid monoamide (see above) are dissolved in 15 ml of dry DMF, 0.25 g (1.63 mmol) of HOBt and 0.31 g (1.67 mmol) of EDC are added and the mixture is stirred at RT for 4 h. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand at RT overnight. The next morning, TLC shows complete conversion. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is dried under high vacuum. The residue is triturated with water (ultrasonic bath), filtered off with suction, washed with water and filtered off with suction. The crude product is recrystallized from isopropanol. The crystals are finally triturated with water, filtered off with suction and dried. This gives 0.38 g (32%) of dodecanedioic acid 4-[(2S,3R)-3-[(S)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-propyl]-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxoazetidin-1-yl]benzylamide ((2S,3R,4R5R)-2,3,4)5,6-pentahydroxyhexyl)amide (I). MW: 809.97; MS: 810.49 (M+H+).<br>
Process A2:<br><br>
At room temperature, 3 ml of dry pyridine and 3 ml of acetic anhydride are added to 0.4 g of 11-((4R6R)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(R)-hydroxy-2-(S)-hydroxyhexylcarbamoyl)undecanoic acid (III; R = H), and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 h. After the<br><br><br><br><br>
A solution of 70 mg of amine I and 23 pi of triethylamine in 1 ml of dimethylformamide is added to a solution of 371 mg of dodecanedioic acid, 63 pi of diisopropylcarbodiimide and 55 mg of hydroxybenzotriazole in 2 ml of dimethylformamide, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The reaction solution is concentrated and separated by HPLC (Knauer Eurospher-100-10-C18, water (0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid)/acetonitrile (0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid) = 80/20  10/90). This gives the product of molecular weight 646.81 (C38H47F1N2O6); MS (ESI) 647.35 (M+H+)<br>

At room temperature, amine I is added to the acid chloride shown above in a mixture of pyridine and dichloromethane, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. Work-up gives amide IV where R = acetyl.<br>
Using the method described below, the activity of the compound of the formula I according to the invention was examined:<br>
Effect on cholesterol absorption + 3H-taurocholic acid excretion using fecal excrement of mice, rats or hamsters<br>
NMRI mice, Wistar rats, or Golden Syrian hamsters (in groups of n=4-6) are kept in metabolic cages, where they are fed with a standard diet (Altromin, Lage (Lippe)). The afternoon prior to the administration of the radioactive tracers (14C-cholesterol), the feed is removed and the animals are adapted to grates.<br>
Additionally, the animals are labeled s.c. with 3H-TCA (taurocholic acid) (for example 1 pCi/mouse up to 5 pCi/rat) 24 hours prior to the peroral administration of the test meal (14C-cholesterol in Intralipid® 20, Pharmacia-Upjohn).<br>
Cholesterol absorption test: 0.25 ml/mouse Intralipid ® 20 (Pharmacia-Upjohn) ((spiked with 0.25 pCi of 14C-cholesterol in 0.1 mg of cholesterol) is administered perorally by gavage.<br>
Test substances are prepared separately in 0.5%/ (methylcellulose (Sigma)/5% Solutol (BASF, Ludwigshafen) or a suitable vehicle.<br><br>
The administration volume of the test substance is 0.5 ml/mouse. The test substance is administered immediately prior to the test meal (Intralipid labeled with 14C-cholesterol) (cholesterol absorption test).<br>
The feces are collected over a period of 24 h: fecal elimination of 14C-cholesterol and 3H-taurocholic acid (TCA) is determined after 24 hours.<br>
The livers are removed and homogenized, and aliquots are incinerated in an oximate (Model 307, Packard) to determine the amount of 14C-cholesterol which had been taken up/absorbed.<br>
Evaluation:<br>
Feces samples:<br>
The total weight is determined, the sample is made up with water to a defined volume and then homogenized, and an aliquot is evaporated to dryness and incinerated in an oximate (Model 307 from Packard for the incineration of radioactively labeled samples): the amount of radioactive 3H-H20 and 14C-C02 is extrapolated to the amount of 3H-taurocholic acid and 14C-cholesterol, respectively, that is excreted (dual isotope technique). The ED2oo values as dose from a dose-effect curve are interpolated as those doses at which the excretion of TCA or cholesterol is doubled, based on a control group treated at the same time.<br>
Liver samples:<br>
The amount of 14C-cholesterol taken up by the liver is based on the administered dose. The ED50 values are interpolated from a dose-effect curve as the dose at which the uptake of 14C-cholesterol by the liver is halved (50%), based on a control group.<br>
The ED50 value below demonstrates the activity of the compound of the formula I according to the invention<br>
Example No.	EDsn (liver) fmg/mousel<br>
I	0.005<br><br>
As can be seen from the table, the compound of the formula I has very good cholesterol-lowering action.<br>
The solubility of compound I and of the comparative compound C1 was tested as follows:<br><br>
0.5 mg of the compound to be tested was weighed exactly into an Eppendorf cap, and 0.5 ml of the solvent in question (aqueous buffer) was added. The Eppendorf cap was then introduced into a thermomixer and, at 25°C, shaken at 1 400 rpm for 4 hours.<br>
The Eppendorf cap was then introduced into a centrifuge. Following centrifugation, an aliquot of the supernatant was used to determine the amount dissolved, using HPLC/UV analysis. The table below shows the results obtained:<br><br><br>
poorly soluble drugs, January 2000, Shaker, ISBN: 3-8265-6962-8) the solubility of example 1 was determined as being 28 and 454 pg/ml, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for C1 were 5 and 18pg/ml, respectively. This significantly different solubility could also be would also be confirmed during a repetition of the tests (43/290 yg/m\ compared to 6/20 \ig/m\).<br>
Accordingly, the compound of the formula I according to the invention has a 6-fold to 16-fold better solubility than the comparative compound of the formula C1. Accordingly, the compound of the formula I according to the invention has better availability in dissolved form at the site of action. In contrast to the more poorly soluble substances, even any higher doses can be provided completely for interaction with the transport system in question. Based on an available volume of 250 ml (Biopharmaceutical Classification System), doses of up to - 100 mg are soluble, whereas in the case of C1 in the best case only doses in the range of 5 mg would be soluble (in the worst case even only: 1.25 mg).<br>
The stability of compound 1 and that of the comparative compound C1 in solution was tested as follows:<br>
The stability of dissolved compound I and of dissolved C1 was determined in aqueous buffers in the pH range 1.2-8.0. 1 mg of the compound in question was weighed into a 5 ml measuring flask. A small amount of acetonitrile was used to dissolve the substance. The flask was then filled up to the mark with the aqueous buffer. The precipitated compound was centrifuged and the clear supernatant was then tested for stability in solution for 24 hours at 37°C. The samples were evaluated using HPLC/UV. The results obtained for example I and C1 are shown in the table below:<br><br><br><br><br>
