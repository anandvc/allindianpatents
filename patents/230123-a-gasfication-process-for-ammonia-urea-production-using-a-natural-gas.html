				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the production of ammonia (NH3) and urea ((NH2)2CO), a syngas feedstream<br>
comprising hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) is first fed to a CO shift unit to<br>
convert CO to C02. before being routed to an acid gas removal facility where the C02 is<br>
separated from the H2. The H2 is then combined with nitrogen (N2) and fed to an<br>
ammonia synthesis unit. The, C02 is then combined with a portion of the NH3 product<br>
and fed to an urea synthesis unit. The primary reactions of this process are:<br>
(1)	3H2 + N2	► 2NH3 (ammonia)<br>
(2)	2NH3 + C02	►(NH2)2CO (urea) + H20<br>
It is known to 'use gasification to produce the syngas feed to an ammonia/urea<br>
production facility. In the gasification process, hydrocarbonaceous material is partially<br>
oxidized in the presence of an oxygen rich gas and a temperature moderator at high<br>
temperatures. The syngas product of the gasification process primarily comprises H2 and<br>
CO. There are many different types of hydrocarbonaceous material that can be fed to a<br>
gasification reactor, from natural gas to heavy oils and solid materials such as coal.<br>
Because natural gas has a lower C/H ratio than solid and liquid hydrocarbon materials,<br>
insufficient C02 is produced for urea production when a natural gas gasifier is used to<br>
produce syngas. Conversely, the high C/H ratio of solid and liquid hydrocarbon<br>
materials produces an excess amount of C02-much more than is needed for urea<br>
production-and thus a large portion of the C02 is vented when only solid and/or liquid<br>
hydrocarbon materials are used to produce syngas. Thus, it would be beneficial to<br>
develop an integrated gasification and ammonia/urea production process that optimizes<br>
the C02 content of the syngas so as to maximize urea production. Furthermore, C02 is<br>
known to have an adverse effect on the environment, such as contributing to global<br>
warming, so it would also be desirable to minimize C02 venting in an integrated<br>
gasification/urea production facility.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention involves a process for the co-production of ammonia and<br>
urea in which two parallel gasifiers are utilized so as to optimize the H2/C02 ratio in the<br>
combined syngas product, thereby maximizing the ammonia and urea production. In a<br>
first gasifier, solid and/or liquid hydrocarbon materials are partially oxidized in the<br><br>
presence of an oxygen-rich gas in the presence of a temperature moderator, thereby<br>
generating a first synthesis gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen and<br>
carbon dioxide. The oxygen-rich gas is normally extracted from air through an air<br>
separation unit (ASU). The by-product of the ASU, nitrogen (N2), is used in the<br>
downstream ammonia production unit.<br>
In a second gasifier, natural gas is partially oxidized in the presence of an oxygen-<br>
rich gas, thereby generating a first synthesis gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide,<br>
hydrogen and carbon dioxide. By running two gasifiers in parallel on the separate feeds,<br>
the feedrates to each gasfier can be independently adjusted to optimize the H2/CO2 ratio<br>
in the combined syngas product stream, thus maximizing ammonia and urea production<br>
and minimizing CO2 emissions.<br>
The combined syngas product stream is then processed in a CO shift reactor so as<br>
to convert any CO in the syngas into H2 and CO2. The CO2 is then removed from the<br>
syngas, usually along with H2S and any other sulfur components in an acid gas removal<br>
unit, leaving a substantially pure H2 stream. The H2 stream is then combined with N2<br>
from the air separation unit to form ammonia (NH3). The CO2 recovered from a C02<br>
recovery unit is combined with at least a portion of the NH3 product to form urea<br>
((NH2)2CO).	<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANY DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is an illustration of one embodiment of the present invention, in which a<br>
solid and/or liquid gasifier is run in parallel with a natural gas gasifier to form an<br>
optimized syngas product.<br>
FIG. 2 is an illustration of a second embodiment of the present invention, wherein<br>
a CO2 generator is used to make up the CO2 deficiency in the syngas when only a natural<br>
gas gasifier is used.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the instant invention, carbonaceous fuel is first obtained and prepared for<br>
feeding to a gasification reactor. Carbonaceous fuel is any solid, liquid, or gaseous<br>
combustible organic material that can be used as feedstock to a gasification process for<br>
produce synthesis gas production. The feedstock for a gasification process is usually a<br>
hydrocarbonaceous material, that is, one or more materials, generally organic, which<br><br>
comprises elements of hydrogen and carbon for the gasification reaction. The<br>
hydrocarbonaceous material can be in a gaseous, liquid or solid state, or in a combination<br>
as desired, for example, a solid-liquid composition in a fluidized state.<br>
The feed preparation step may not be necessary, given the composition and<br>
physical nature of the feedstock. Generally, solid carbonaceous fuels will need to be<br>
liquefied with oil or water prior to feeding to the gasifier. Liquid and gaseous<br>
carbonaceous fuels may be suitable for direct feed to the gasifier, but can be pre-treated<br>
for removal of any impurities that might be present in the feed.<br>
The term liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuel as used herein to describe various<br>
suitable feedstocks is intended to include pumpable liquid hydrocarbon materials and<br>
pumpable liquid slurries of solid carbonaceous materials, and mixtures thereof. For<br>
example, pumpable aqueous slurries of solid carbonaceous fuels are suitable feedstocks.<br>
In fact, substantially any combustible carbon-containing liquid organic material, or<br>
slurries thereof may be included within the definition of the term "liquid<br>
hydrocarbonaceous." For example, there are:<br>
(1)	pumpable slurries of solid carbonaceous fuels, such as coal, particulate carbon,<br>
petroleum coke, concentrated sewer sludge, and mixtures thereof, in a vaporizable liquid<br>
carrier, such as water, liquId CO2, liquid hydrocarbon fuel, and mixtures thereof;<br>
(2)	suitable liquid hydrocarbon fuel feedstocks to the gasifier, is intended to<br>
include various materials, such as liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum distillates and<br>
residua, gasoline, naphtha, kerosine, crude petroleum, asphalt, gas oil, residual oil, tar<br>
sand oil and shale oil, coal derived oil, aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene,<br>
xylene fractions), coal tar, cycle gas oil from fluid-catalytic-cracking operations, furfural<br>
extract of coker gas oil, and mixtures thereof;<br>
(3)	also included within the definition of the term liquid hydrocarbonaceous are<br>
oxygenated hydrocarbonaceous organic materials including carbohydrates, cellulosic<br>
materials, aldehydes, organic acids, alcohols, ketones, oxygenated fuel oil, waste liquids<br>
and by-products from chemical processes containing oxygenated hydrocarbonaceous<br>
organic materials, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Gaseous hydrocarbonaceous fuels that may be burned in the partial oxidation<br>
gasifier alone or along with the liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuel includes vaporized liquid<br><br>
natural gas, refinery off-gas, C1 -C4 hydrocarbonaceous gases, and waste carbon-<br>
containing gases from chemical processes.<br>
After the feed preparation step, if used, the solid and/or liquid carbonaceous fuel<br>
is sent to a first gasification reactor, or gasifier, and natural gas is sent to a second<br>
gasifier. In each gasifier, the feed is reacted with a reactive free oxygen-containing gas.<br>
The term free-oxygen containing gas as used herein means air, oxygen-enriched air i.e.<br>
greater than 21 mole % O2, and substantially pure oxygen, i.e. greater than about 95%<br>
mole oxygen (the remainder usually comprising N2 and rare gases). Substantially pure<br>
oxygen is preferred, such as that which is produced by an air separation unit (ASU). The<br>
partial oxidation of the hydrocarbonaceous material is completed, advantageously in the<br>
presence of a temperature control moderator such as steam, in a gasification zone to<br>
obtain hot synthesis gas, or syngas. Syngas, and synthesis gas can and are used<br>
interchangeably throughout this specification.<br>
The need for a temperature moderator to control the temperature in the reaction<br>
zone of the gas generator depends in general on the carbon-to-hydrogen ratios of the<br>
feedstock and the oxygen content of the oxidant stream. A temperature moderator is<br>
commonly used with liquid hydrocarbon fuels with substantially pure oxygen. Water or<br>
steam are the preferred temperature moderators. Steam may be introduced as a<br>
temperature moderator in admixture with either or both reactant streams. Alternatively,<br>
the temperature moderator may be introduced into the reaction zone of the gas generator<br>
by way of a separate conduit in the burner. Other temperature moderators include CO2 -<br>
rich gas, nitrogen, and recycled synthesis gas.<br>
A gasification reactor generally comprises a reaction zone, made up of a vertical<br>
cylindrically shaped steel pressure vessel lined with refractory, and a quench drum, such<br>
as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,809,104, which is incorporated herein by reference. A<br>
burner, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,928,460, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, may be used to introduce the feed streams into the reaction zone. In the<br>
reaction zone of a gasifier, the contents will commonly reach temperatures in the range of<br>
about 1,700° F (927° C) to 3,000° F (1649° C), and more typically in the range of about<br>
2,000° F (1093° C) to 2,800° F (1538° C). Pressure will typically be in the range of<br>
about 1 psi (101 kPa) to about 3675 psi (25,331 kPa), and more typically in the range of<br><br>
about 200 psi (1378 kPa) to about 2000 psi (13,782 kPa), and even more typically in the<br>
range of about 800 psi (5513 kPa) to about 1200 psi (8269 kPa). See US Patent 3,945,942<br>
describing a partial oxidation burner assembly. See US Patent 5,656,044 describing a<br>
method and an apparatus for the gasification of organic materials. See also US Patents<br>
5,435,940, 4,851,013, and 4,159,238 describing a few of the many gasification processes<br>
known in the prior art. The entire disclosures of the above referenced patents are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference and relied upon.<br>
The hot gasification process product synthesis gas, or syngas, comprises carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Other materials often found in the synthesis<br>
gas include hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, cyanides, and particulates in the form of carbon<br>
and trace metals. The extent of the contaminants in the feed is determined by the type of<br>
feed and the particular gasification process utilized as well as the operating conditions.<br>
In any event, the removal of these contaminants is preferable to make gasification a<br>
viable process.<br>
As the synthesis gas is discharged from the gasifier, it passes into the gasificcation<br>
quench chamber for cleaning. The turbulent condition in the quench drum, caused by<br>
large volumes of gases bubbling up through the water helps the water to scrub much of<br>
the solids from the effluent gas. Large quantities of steam are generated within the<br>
quench vessel and saturate the syngas stream. The stream of raw gas is cooled in the<br>
quench drum and leaves at a temperature in the range of about 35.0°F to 600°F (about<br>
175°C to 315°C), such as about 450°F to 550°F (about 230°C to 290°C), and a pressure in<br>
the range of about 500 to 2500 psia, such as about 1000 psia. Advantageously, fresh<br>
quench water is a mixture of make-up water and condensate produced subsequently in the<br>
process.<br>
After the gasification step, the syngas from the solid and/or liquid hydrocarbon<br>
gasifier and the syngas from the natural gas gasifier are combined. The combined<br>
synthesis gas stream may then be advantageously shifted with steam to convert CO in the<br>
synthesis gas to carbon dioxide CO2) and hydrogen (H2) by way of the water gas shift<br>
reaction to optimize the H2/CO2 ratio for use in the downstream ammoina and urea<br>
synthesis units. The synthesis gas from the gasifier is shifted using steam and a suitable<br>
catalyst to form hydrogen and carbon dioxide as shown below:<br><br>
(3)	H20 + CO :	► H2 + C02<br>
About 90-98% of the CO is converted to H2 and C02 in the shift reactor. Methods and<br>
apparatuses to carry out the shift reaction are known in the art, and one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will be able to select the appropriate means for accomplishing this step.<br>
After being discharged from the shift unit, the synthesis gas is sent to an acid gas<br>
removal unit so that the impurities in the syngas can be removed. The acid gas removal<br>
facilities for the synthesis gas, usually employing amine or physical solvents, removes the<br>
acid gases, particularly the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, from the synthesis gas<br>
stream. The acid gas removal facilities typically operate at low temperatures. After the<br>
synthesis gas is cooled to below about 130°F (54°C), preferably below about 100°F<br>
(38°C), the contaminants in the gas, especially sulfur compounds and acid gases, are<br>
readily removed. The synthesis gas is contacted with the solvent in an acid gas removal<br>
contactor. The contactor may be of any type known to the art, including trays or a<br>
packed column, and operation of such an acid removal contactor is also known in the art.<br>
The acid gas stream is then sent to a carbon dioxide recovery unit, where hydrogen<br>
sulfide is removed from the CO2 and commonly routed to a sulfur recovery process, with<br>
the recovered carbon dioxide being sent to the downstream urea synthesis unit.<br>
The purified synthesis gas, now comprising mostly hydrogen, is sent to an<br>
ammonia synthesis unit. As embodied herein, any process for ammonia synthesis may be<br>
used. The most common industrial process for ammonia synthesis involves forming a<br>
mixture of gaseous nitrogen and hydrogen in .a 1 to 3 molar ratio, and is reacted in<br>
accordance with the following equation:<br>
(4)	3H2 + N2	► 2NH3<br>
This gas mixture is then compressed to high pressure (from about 80 bar to about 220<br>
bar), heated (from about 450°C. to about 550°C.) and passed over a catalyst where<br>
ammonia formation occurs. During ammonia synthesis, the reactants (nitrogen and<br>
hydrogen) and the product (ammonia) are in equilibrium, sq, to increase the total amount<br>
of ammonia formed, the equilibrium should be shifted to product formation by removing<br>
ammonia from the reaction mixture as it is Droduced.<br>
Removal of the ammonia is usually accomplished by cooling the gas mixture to a<br>
relatively low temperature (about -5°C. to about 25°C). In this temperature range, a two-<br><br>
phase mixture is formed with ammonia being a liquid and nitrogen and hydrogen<br>
remaining as gases. The liquefied ammonia is separated from the other components of the<br>
mixture, and the remaining nitrogen and hydrogen are subsequently re-heated to the<br>
operating temperature for ammonia conversion and passed through the reactor again.<br>
. Distillation and single-stage flash are other methods that have been used to separate '<br>
ammonia from a synthesis gas.<br>
A portion of the ammonia product is then combined with the CO2 removed from<br>
the syngas and sent to a urea production unit. As embodied herein, any process for urea<br>
synthesis may be used. In a common urea synthesis process, the ammonia and carbon<br>
dioxide are fed into the synthesis section to form ammonium carbamate in accordance<br>
with the exothermic reaction:<br>
(5)	2NH3 + C02 ↔ NH2COONH4<br>
A fraction 01 tne ammonium carbamate then dehydrates to form urea and water in<br>
accordance with the endothermic reversible reaction:<br>
(6)	NH2COONH4 ↔ (NH2)2CO + H20<br>
Under the normally used synthesis conditions, i.e., pressures of between about<br>
120 and 300 bars and temperatures between about 170°C. and 250°C, the carbamate<br>
formation reaction is extremely fast and practically complete, whereas the dehydration<br>
reaction proceeds slowly towards equilibrium. That fraction of the ammonium carbamate<br>
which dehydrates to form urea is determined not only by the reaction temperature and<br>
pressure but also by the ratio of the various reactants and the residence time in the<br>
synthesis section. The molar ratios normally used are: ammonia/carbon dioxide: from 2.5<br>
to 7; and water/carbon dioxide: from 0 to 1. Water is present both as reaction product<br>
and a component of any recycle streams from the plant sections downstream of the<br>
synthesis section. The residence time in the synthesis section varies from 20 to 90<br>
minutes.<br>
The product of the synthesis reaction consists substantially of a solution<br>
comprising ammonium carbamate, urea, water and free ammonia, in that all the<br>
industrially used processes operate with a substantial excess of ammonia to obtain high<br>
yields and limit the formation of harmful by-products such as biuret. The free ammonia<br>
and the ammonium carbamate are separated from the urea solution obtained from the<br><br>
synthesis section and recycled to the synthesis section for their complete conversion into<br>
urea. The urea solution then has to be further processed to obtain the granular product in<br>
accordance with current commercial specifications. The various industrial urea<br>
production processes are characterized precisely by their methods for separating and<br>
recycling those components not converted to urea. Any known process may be used as<br>
the urea production unit of the present invention.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, the first embodiment of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in schematic form. Solid or liquid hydrocarbonaceous feed 2 is fed to a first<br>
gasification reactor 6 along with a temperature moderator 4 and oxygen 18. Natural gas<br>
feed 8 is fed to a second gasification reactor 10 along with oxygen 20. Oxygen 18 and<br>
oxygen 20 are produced from an air separation unit 14 which separates air 12 into oxygen<br>
16 and nitrogen 22. The syngas products 22 and 24 from the first gasification reactor 6<br>
and the second gasification reactor 10, respectively, are combined into syngas stream 26.<br>
The feedrates to each gasification reactor are independently adjusted so as to optimize the<br>
composition of the syngas stream 26. For instance, if a higher CO2 content in syngas<br>
stream 26 is desired, the feedrate to the first gasification reactor 6 would be increased, or<br>
the feedrate to the second gasification reactor 10 would be decreased. The syngas stream<br>
26 is then sent to a shift unit 30, where a substantial portion of the CO present in the<br>
syngas stream 26 is converted into CO2 and H2.<br>
The shifted syngas 32 is then cooled in exchanger 34 and processed in acid gas<br>
removal unit 38. In acid gas removal unit 38, the CO2 is separated from the H2 in the<br>
syngas. The CO2 is removed via line 40, along with any sulfur compounds present in the<br>
shifted syngas stream 36. The remaining H2 stream 42 is then combined with nitrogen<br>
stream 22 from air separation unit 14 and sent to ammonia synthesis reactor 44. The<br>
ammonia product 46 is recovered and either sent to urea reactor 58 or removed for use in<br>
other processes via line 48.<br>
C02 waste stream 40 is then sent to a CO2 recovery unit 50 where a substantially<br>
pure stream of CO2 54 is recovered, leaving a waste stream 52. The CO2 stream 54 is<br>
combined with ammonia stream 56 and sent to urea reactor 58. Finally, urea product 60<br>
is obtained from the urea reactor 58 and is thus sent to storage or to other downstream<br>
processes. Depending on the desired amount of ammonia production 48 and urea<br><br>
production 60, the feedstreams 2 and 8 to gasifiers 6 and 10, respectively, are<br>
independently adjusted.<br>
In a second embodiment, only natural gas is used as a feedstock to the<br>
ammonia/urea production unit. Natural gas can be gasified, as describe above, or can be<br>
processed in a steam-methane reforming process. As embodied herein, any known<br>
steam-methane reforming process may be used. In a common steam-methane reforming<br>
(SMR) process natural gas is heated to about 750°F., and any H2S is removed using a<br>
solid adsorbent, typically zinc oxide (ZnO). Process steam is mixed with the natural gas<br>
resulting in a mixed feed with a steam/carbon ratio of 1.0-3.5 (typically 1.5). Carbon<br>
dioxide, if available, can also be mixed into the feed from 0.1 to 2.0 CO2/C ratios. The<br>
mixed feed (steam and natural gas) is heated in a convection section coil to about 900°F.<br>
to 1050T. and enters a SMR. In the SMR, the mixed feed passes through tubes with a Ni<br>
containing catalyst, such as 5-30% Ni on an alumina support, which promotes the<br>
reaction of methane and steam to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the reforming<br>
reaction, following the following formula:<br>
(7) CH4 + H20 	.	►3H2 + CO<br>
The water gas reaction, illustrated by the following formula:<br>
(8)CO + H20 	►CO2 + H2<br>
also occurs to yield a synthesis gas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide, water and small amounts of unreacted methane. The synthesis gas exits the SMR<br>
at about 1300°F. to 1700°F. The final syngas product contains about 70 to 72 mole<br>
percent hydrogen, 6 to 8 percent unconverted methane, 8 to 10 percent carbon dioxide,<br>
and 10 to 14 percent carbon monoxide, all on a dry basis.<br>
The remaining steps are substantially the same as outlined above in the previous<br>
embodiment. The synthesis gas is shifted, the CO2 and other impurities are removed, the<br>
H2 is reacted with N2 to form ammonia, and the CO2 is reacted with a portion of the<br>
ammonia to form urea. Because the gasification of natural gas does not produce enough<br>
carbon dioxide for maximum urea production, a carbon dioxide generation process is<br>
used to provide makeup CO2 to the urea synthesis process. As embodied herein, any<br>
process for carbon dioxide synthesis may be used.<br><br>
The most common preparation of carbon dioxide generally involves the steps of<br>
crude gas generation, purification and separation. Generation of crude carbon dioxide<br>
involves the combustion of liquid fuels such as fuel oil, or solid fuels such as anthracites,<br>
coke, charcoal, and the like, with excess air to promote complete oxidation of the fuel and<br>
to provide a carbon dioxide rich combustion exhaust gas. Purification of the combustion<br>
exhaust gas generally involves several separate treatments to provide a gas having high<br>
purity. These purification treatments include washing, absorption, adsorption, desorption,<br>
and the removal of reducing substances. Washing generally involves a water absorption<br>
shower (water wash) to remove solids (soot, carried off ashes, etc.) and at the same time<br>
to cool the combustion gases. Various scrubbing solutions are generally employed to<br>
remove contaminants and to reduce the components in the combustion gas mixture to<br>
carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen. The combustion exhaust gas may also be passed<br>
through a tower containing a recirculating oxidizing solution such as potassium<br>
permanganate to remove traces of organic impurities carried with the gas.<br>
The washed and scrubbed combustion gas is then separated to obtain a carbon<br>
dioxide rich fraction. In one separation method, the combustion gas mixture is circulated<br>
through a counter-current shower of an absorbing solution such as potassium carbonate,<br>
monoethanol-amine, and the like. Carbon dioxide can be desorbed by heating the carbon<br>
dioxide saturated solution to a temperature above 100°C. In another separation method,<br>
the combustion mixture is separated by selectively adsorbing the carbon dioxide on a<br>
zeolite bed in a pressure swing adsorption system. The most common methods for<br>
separating nitrogen from air are cryogenic fractional distillation, inert gas generation<br>
(combustion of natural gas or propane in air), and pressure swing adsorption, all of which<br>
are known in the art.<br>
The supplemental carbon dioxide is then combined with the carbon dioxide that<br>
was removed from the syngas, further combined with a portion of the ammoina product,<br>
and sent to a urea synthesis unit as outlined above.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, a second embodiment of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in schematic form. For simplicity, units and streams FIG. 2 has in common<br>
with FIG. 1 have retained the unit or stream number from FIG. 1. Natural gas feed 8 is<br>
fed to a gasification reactor 10 along with oxygen 20. Oxygen 20 is produced from an air<br><br>
separation unit 14 which separates air 12 into oxygen 20 and nitrogen 22. The syngas<br>
product 26 is then sent to a shift unit 30, where a substantial portion of the CO present in<br>
the syngas stream 26 is converted into C02.<br>
The shifted syngas 32 is then cooled in exchanger 34 and processed in acid gas<br>
unit 38. In acid gas unit 38, the CO2 is separated from the H2 in the syngas. The CO2 is<br>
removed via line 40, along with any sulfur compounds present in the shifted syngas<br>
stream 36. The remaining H2 stream 42 is then combined with nitrogen stream 22 from<br>
air separation unit 14 and sent to ammonia synthesis reactor 44. The ammonia product<br>
46 is recovered and either sent to urea reactor 58 or removed for use in other processes<br>
via line 48.<br>
CO2 waste stream 40 is then sent to a CO2 recovery unit 50 where a substantially<br>
pure stream of CO= 54 is recovered, leaving a waste stream 52. The CO2 recovered in<br>
stream 54 is usually not at a sufficiently high flowrate to maximize urea production.<br>
Thus, supplemental CO2 78 is added to stream 54. Supplemental C02 78 is produced<br>
from a CO2 production unit, which involves feeding a carbonaceous material 62 to a CO2<br>
generator 66 along with air 64, to produce a crude CO2 stream 68. Stream 68 is then<br>
cooled in exchanger 70, and can include washing steps (not shown). The cooled steram<br>
68 is then sent to separator 74, where condensed liquids 72 are removed from the C02<br>
stream. The final, purified CO2 product stream 78 is then combined with the C02 stream<br>
54 that was removed from the syngas, further combined with a portion of the ammoina<br>
product 56, and sent to a urea synthesis unit 58. Finally, urea product 60 is obtained from<br>
the urea reactor 58 and is thus sent to storage or to other downstream processes.<br>

The present invention involves a process for the co-production of ammonia and<br>
urea in which two parallel gasifiers are utilized so as to optimize the H2 /C02 ratio<br>
in the combined syngas product, thereby maximizing the ammonia and urea<br>
production. In a first gasifier, solid and/or liquid hydrocarbon materials are<br>
partially oxidized in the presence of an oxygen-rich gas in the presence of a<br>
temperature moderator, thereby generating a first synthesis gas mixture<br>
comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In a second gasifier,<br>
natural gas is partially oxidized in the presence of an oxygen-rich gas, thereby<br>
generating a first synthesis gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen<br>
and carbon dioxide. Because natural gas has a lower C/H ratio than the solid<br>
and/or liquid hydrocarbon materials, insufficient C02 is produced in the natural<br>
gas gasifier for urea production when only natural gas is used to produce syngas.<br>
Conversely, the high C/H ratio of the solid and/or liquid hydrocarbon materials<br>
produces an excess amount of C02 -much more than is needed for urea<br>
production-and thus a large portion of the C02 is vented when only solid and/or<br>
liquid hydrocarbon materials are used to produce syngas. By running two<br>
gasifiers in parallel on the separate feeds, the feedrate to each gasfier can be<br>
adjusted to optimize to maximize the H2 /C02 ratio in. the combined syngas<br>
product stream, resulting in an elimination or minimization of C02 emissions from<br>
the integrated gasification, ammonia and urea production facility.<br></td>
