				<td>EP 1 315 751<br>
The invention relates to a device for the production of containers from a plastic which is<br>
deformable by stretch blow moulding with a mould, the inner space of which corresponds<br>
to that of the finished container, which is held at its open end with a holder with gas<br>
supply lines, a movable stretching die being guided axially through the holder and an<br>
ignition device being arranged in order to ignite an explosive gas mixture inside the<br>
container.<br>
From the international publication numbered WO98/06559 a device of the type described<br>
above for the production of containers made from plastic is known, for example of bottles<br>
made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET). These PET bottles are produced by first<br>
heating a blank up to a temperature suitable for stretch blowing of approximately 100 -<br>
120Â°C and introducing it into a tool mould. The blank is axially stretched by means of a<br>
movable stretching die. While the stretching pressure is produced by blowing an<br>
explosive gas mixture into the blank, for example a mixture of oxyhydrogen and an inert<br>
gas, a blowing pressure is produced by ignition of the explosive gas mixture, and this<br>
blowing pressure presses the wall of the intermediate blank/the partly pre-formed<br>
container completely against the inner wall of the mould. The explosive gas mixture is a<br>
mixture of an oxidising agent and an oxidizable constituent, such as for example<br>
hydrogen, methane, or the like.<br>
On technical grounds, it has been shown that containers produced with the known device<br>
could not be used industrially. With respect to form and volume and also with respect to<br>
their visual appearance, it has not been possible to produce and reproduce them to a<br>
sufficient quality. It has not, for example been possible to produced PET bottles with<br>
clear, transparent walls. It was supposed that this sometimes unpleasing appearance,<br>
insofar as it was not intentionally brought about, or for specific reasons could be<br>
accepted, arose due to unavoidable temperature influences.<br>
According to EP 1 204 526, it was proposed to bring the end of the holder which was<br>
remote from the container into flow-agent-tight engagement with a main distributor<br>
block, through which the stretching die is movably guided in axial extension of the<br>
holder, and on which at least one flow-agent connection is arranged. Although the<br>
construction as a whole according to this earlier proposal was different from that of the<br>
device of the afore-mentioned international publication, it had nonetheless been<br>
established that sometimes the explosion triggered by ignition was particularly severe<br>
locally in the container, but that no explosion occurred in locations distanced away from<br>
the direct intake of oxygen.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve a device of the kind initially mentioned, in such<br>
a way that plastic containers can be produced more reliably and with a better appearance,<br>
for example with largely clear, transparent walls.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the holder, at its end facing<br>
away from the container can be brought into flow-agent-tight engagement with a main<br>
distributor block, through which the stretching die is movably passed in axial extension<br>
of the holder, in that at least one first flow-agent connection is provided in a first region<br>
of the main distributor block facing away from the container, and a second flow-agent<br>
connection is provided in the opposite, second region facing the container, the lines from<br>
the at least two flow-agent connections in the second region of the main distributor block<br>
are in connection with one another, and between the connection point and the holder, a<br>
supply line in the form of a single shared flow channel is formed.<br>
The new feature over EP 1 204 526 is that the supply lines consisting of the at least two<br>
flow-agent connections are in communication with each other in the second region in the<br>
main distribution block, and that a supply line is formed as one single shared flow<br>
channel between the connection point and the holder.<br>
According to the invention, the volume on the device side is small enough that when<br>
oxyhydrogen gas is used, e.g. water, a considerably smaller quantity of reaction products<br>
is left behind. By virtue of the features according to the invention, a small inner space is<br>
closed on the device side. This avoids, in particular, the accumulation of undesirable<br>
reaction products (water). At least the container itself, preferably even the container with<br>
holder, is removed following the explosion, and takes with it the reaction products which<br>
have accumulated. In the remainder of the inner space on the device side, the quantities<br>
of reaction product which remain behind are therefore hardly noticeable and still continue<br>
to be negligible, even after a relatively long period of time with continuous production<br>
methods. As a result, contrary to the international publication, a plastics container can be<br>
produced more reliably which has an improved appearance, e.g. with a wall which is<br>
largely transparent.<br>
If the first flow-agent connection according to the invention is used, or the several first<br>
flow-agent connections in the first region of the main distributor block facing away from<br>
the container to be produced are used, then for example oxidation agent can be<br>
introduced through this connection, or a mixture with oxidation agent or even air. If the<br>
second flow-agent connection is situated nearer to the container, and if the oxidizable<br>
constituent, such as for example hydrogen or methane, is passed through same, then it is<br>
possible to ensure that scarcely any oxidizable constituent remains in the farther first<br>
region of the main distributor block, which results in a good mixing or good mixing-in of<br>
the oxidizable constituent into the other flow agents, producing a uniform and good<br>
detonation.<br>
The mixing of the different flow-agent constituents takes place at the connection point, at<br>
which the lines from the two flow-agent connections are in connection with one another,<br>
particularly as only one single flow channel, through which all flow agents have to flow,<br>
is present from the connection point onwards in the flow direction to the container. They<br>
are mixed on this flow route, with the result that, corresponding to the quantity of<br>
oxidizable constituent (hydrogen or methane), an almost stoichiometric distribution is<br>
achieved, which is homogeneous almost throughout the whole space of the container to<br>
be produced.<br>
By means of the invention, the oxidizable constituent (hydrogen, methane, etc.) can be<br>
introduced into a running flow-agent flow in measured quantities. Determination of the<br>
respective dose is carried out over time, i.e. via the opening of a supply line until closing<br>
of same. The other flow agents, in particular the oxidation agent, can also preferably be<br>
controlled over time, with respect to its quantity, in such a way that these flow agents<br>
flow after the opening of a supply line valve, until this valve is closed again. According<br>
to the invention, the time duration between opening and closing for the flow agent with<br>
the oxidation agent is longer than for the oxidixable agent. This ensures that the flow<br>
agents with the oxidation agent still flow past the connection point, if the flow agent with<br>
the oxidizable constituent has already been cut off. The result of this is that, in the region<br>
downstream of the connection point, there is scarcely any flow agent with the oxidizable<br>
constituent. The explosion will therefore not be propagated into the region of the main<br>
distributor block at a distance from the container.<br>
If, in a certain version, the arrangement of the stretching die is observed essentially in<br>
plumb-line direction, the container to be produced then being arranged at the top, then the<br>
main distributor block is situated at a distance from same at the bottom, and also below<br>
the holder, and the first region of the main distributor block is situated at the bottom, the<br>
second region at the top closer to the container. During operation, air can be used as a<br>
flow agent for the oxidation constituents. The air then flows in at the bottom and<br>
upwards through the main distributor block, in such a way that after all the valves are<br>
closed, it is possible to speak of an air column, which reaches from the lower, distant<br>
second region at least as far as approximately the middle region of the main distributor<br>
block. As a result of the flowing of the air after the oxidizable constituent is cut off, the<br>
latter is carried along past the connection point upwards. From the flowing in/connection<br>
point of the two flow agents upwards closer to the container, there is then no longer any<br>
oxidizable flow agent. No oxyhydrogen can therefore develop in the region underneath<br>
and at a greater distance from the container, and thus neither can a possibly dangerous<br>
explosion occur here, nor a reaction product form - i.e. water in the case of oxyhydrogen.<br>
In the case of a preferred version of the invention, it is expedient if air is taken as an<br>
oxidation agent and hydrogen as an oxidizable constituent and if 30 milliseconds after<br>
opening the air valves, the valve for hydrogen is opened. Hydrogen then flows in during<br>
a period of 90 milliseconds to 140 milliseconds, depending on the size of the container to<br>
be produced, for example, a bottle-shaped container or a plastic bottle. Subsequently, the<br>
hydrogen supply is cut off, and air still flows past the connection point in the direction of<br>
the container to be produced. The air flows for 250 milliseconds. Then its supply valve<br>
is also closed. Tests with these values have resulted in a uniform and good<br>
detonation/explosion of the gas mixture in the container to be produced. The ignition<br>
signal is moreover triggered directly after the last closing of the last air valve.<br>
In the case of a further advantageous version of the invention, the second flow-agent<br>
connection has a rigid, short connection tube with a firmly fitted control valve. The<br>
supply line for the oxidizable flow agent (for example hydrogen or methane) is<br>
unmoveable and favours a high safety aspect. The rigidly laid pipes can be connected<br>
with one another by welding, resulting in the highest safety standard. If flexible tubes are<br>
avoided and the rigid, short connection pipes are used, the enclosed volume can be<br>
precisely defined, so that the quantity of constituents of the mixture to be prepared can be<br>
determined more precisely. In a particularly preferred version of the invention, the<br>
connection pipe from the main distributor block to the control valve preferably has a<br>
length of 5 to 20 mm and is quite particularly favourably constructed, if it is<br>
approximately 10 mm long.<br>
According to the invention it is also favourable if there is provided in the preferably<br>
stationary main distributor block a driven hollow piston which is movable axially relative<br>
to same and which, on its outer end facing the holder, has a ring-shaped lock-washer<br>
surface matching the holder. The main distributor block can also be designed in one<br>
piece and connected with a correspondingly moved holder in such a way that this<br>
connection between holder and main distributor block can be loosened in a controlled<br>
manner. However, the loosening is carried out preferably favourably by means of the<br>
above measure with the hollow piston. In order to connect the main distributor block to<br>
the holder/to release it from same, neither the main distributor block nor the holder in fact<br>
needs to be moved axially - approximately in the direction of the hollow stretching die -<br>
because the hollow piston is movably driven axially, preferably pneumatically. At its<br>
outer end, the hollow piston carries a lock-washer surface matching the holder, which<br>
during connection of the holder to the main distributor block enters into tight engagement<br>
with the sealing surface of the holder. After the blowing and sterilisation process, the<br>
movement of the hollow piston is reversed, the sealing surface disengages from the<br>
lock-washer surface, and then the holder can be shifted perpendicularly to the direction of<br>
its longitudinal axis in the manner described above. This shifting takes place each time<br>
after a blowing/sterilisation process of the production process operating step-by-step.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention it is expedient if the main distributor block<br>
consists of a distributor block and a hollow adapter. The latter can be put onto the side of<br>
the distributor block facing the container and fastened there, so that both parts (distributor<br>
block and adapter) form a solid, quasi-single-part main distributor block, wherein,<br>
however, in the case of a retrofit of the supply line for the oxidising constituents, only the<br>
adapter would need to be retrofitted or reconstructed, removed from the distributor block<br>
for that purpose, and exchanged.<br>
A further advantageous design of the invention is that the holder is hollow and has a<br>
sealing surface at its end facing away from the container, through which the stretching<br>
die is movably passed in axial extension of the holder. The holder is preferably hollow,<br>
so that the stretching die can be moved through the whole, elongatedly designed holder<br>
from its one end axially to its opposite end. Nevertheless, the holder can be connected in<br>
flow-agent-tight manner with the distributor block, by means of the sealing surface which<br>
extends around the space for the stretching die and is therefore ring-shaped. It is<br>
favourable if the stretching die is passed through this ring-shaped sealing surface in<br>
flow-agent-tight manner, so that optionally flow-agents, preferably gases, can be pushed<br>
out of the distributor block by the holder into the container to be produced, without the<br>
gases escaping outside the device. Due to the hollow design of the holder, not only can<br>
the stretching therefore be passed through into the container, and withdrawn again from<br>
same, but flow agents can also be passed between the outer surface of the stretching die<br>
and the inner surface of the holder into the container, and in addition the volume inside<br>
the holder is kept relatively small. In particular, the space provided for the explosion can<br>
be limited to the inner space mentioned, on the device side, so that in the supply lines,<br>
chemical reactions which create reaction products can safely be prevented.<br>
According to the invention, it is further expedient, if, in the region of the hollow stamping<br>
die facing the container, an ignition device is fitted and electrically connected to a control<br>
unit preferably via cables passing through the hollow stamping die. With such a design<br>
of the hollow stretching die, the ignition of the explosive flow-agent mixture can take<br>
place almost in the centre of the container to be produced. Device parts situated further<br>
outside the container can then, depending on the process, be uncoupled or closed. The<br>
actuation of the ignition device via the cable or pcb track is carried out just as<br>
advantageously by means of the hollow design of the stretching die.<br>
According to the invention, it is advantageous if the holder is movably driven<br>
perpendicularly to its longitudinal central axis. As a result, it is surprisingly possible to<br>
separately remove a large part of the inner space on the device side, namely the space in<br>
the hollow holder, after each stretching and blowing process, i.e. in particular after each<br>
combustion, from the otherwise stationary device, for example the main distributor block<br>
with the hollow piston, together with the reaction products adhering to the walls. All<br>
these reaction products take no further part in the next process of stretching and blowing,<br>
and, in particular, in the chemical combustion process. The inner space on the device<br>
side, which, if need be, can have adhering reaction products, is then limited to the space<br>
in the hollow die and in the main distributor block. If oxyhydrogen is used, so little water<br>
is carried along as reaction product into the next combustion process that there is no risk<br>
of the inner walls of the container being adversely affected during and after the<br>
explosion.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention a sealing duct can be fitted in the main<br>
distributor block in alignment with the hollow piston to guide the stretching die. This<br>
allows the stretching die to move in axial direction through the main distributor block, its<br>
hollow piston, the downstream holder and into the holder or out of these parts, although<br>
the inner space on the device side remains sealed gas-tight.<br>
It may also be noted that pressure sensors and temperature measuring equipment can be<br>
arranged at various points in the device, preferably in the region of the main distributor<br>
block, but also in the hollow stretching die.<br>
ft is self-evident that the ignition device can be based on different physical principles.<br>
The ignition of the media mixture takes place in the simplest case electrically via a spark<br>
gap, which consists for example of a spark plug, which can be fitted onto the stretching<br>
die or the distributor, or by means of static discharge. In addition, other ignition methods<br>
are also possible, for example by irradiation of electromagnetic energy, approximately in<br>
the form of a laser-, high-frequency- or microwave pulse or else by means of a catalytic<br>
process.<br>
A practical version according to the invention is furthermore characterised in that the<br>
ignition device is fitted in the main distributor block. The stretching die is then<br>
surrounded by the space in the main distributor block, the space between stretching die<br>
and hollow piston and that between stretching die and holder at a distance. This distance<br>
signifies an annular space, which can be regarded as a flow-agent channel, and designed<br>
accordingly. In the case of a large design, larger quantities of flow agent can be pumped<br>
into the container, and vice versa. The explosion triggered by the ignition device in the<br>
main distributor block is then propagated very rapidly throughout the space filled with<br>
flow agent and water. This space is limited on the outside by the non-return valves on the<br>
lines on the distributor block.<br>
Using the measures according to the invention, it is possible to control the explosion only<br>
via the quantity of the introduced oxidizable constituent of the mixture. A homogeneous<br>
distribution of the constituents of the gas mixture is achieved. During the time in which<br>
air is allowed to flow in as a flow-agent mixture with the oxidation agent, hydrogen or<br>
methane is introduced over a shorter time with later opening and earlier closing, so that as<br>
from the introduction or connection point, the vortexing ensures good mixing, so that the<br>
gases then arriving in the container to be produced are then well and homogeneously<br>
mixed. In the region of the main distributor block facing away from the container, there<br>
will then be scarcely any oxidizable constituents of the explosive mixture, so that the<br>
explosion is not continued into the main distributor block.<br>
Further advantages, features and possible applications of the present invention result from<br>
the following description in conjunction with the attached drawings, showing preferred<br>
versions, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows the main distributor block in section, with the stretching die passed<br>
centrally through same, and the second flow-agent connection running<br>
perpendicularly to it, through which oxidizable constituents can be<br>
supplied, and<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-section along the line II-II in Figure 1.<br>
The container to be produced, namely a bottle-shaped container in this case made of<br>
plastic, such as PET, is not shown in the drawings. The PET container is to be imagined<br>
with its open end downwards. It is connected in a sealing manner with the top edge of<br>
the holder, not shown, and then held by same. The holder is in sleeve-form, and is freely<br>
movable vis-a-vis the supply lines and other tool parts in one direction perpendicularly<br>
through the stretching die 1, which is shown as a thin hollow pipe, and passes through the<br>
centre of the main distributor block generally designated 2. The stretching die 1 is axially<br>
passed not only through the holder, not shown, but also through a sealing duct 3, the<br>
inner space 4 on the device side and at a distance away a hollow piston 5 which sits in a<br>
sealing manner in the vertical continuous bore 6 of the distributor block 7 and also the<br>
vertical continuous bore 8 of the adapter 9. For example, the piston seal 10 in the middle<br>
of the distributor block 7 and the piston seal 10' in the upper first region of the main<br>
distributor block 2 (here on the adapter 9) can be recognised here.<br>
The hollow-designed distributor block 7 forms, together with the adapter 9 which is also<br>
hollow, the main distributor block, overall designated 2. The distributor block 7 and<br>
adapter 9 are firmly fitted to one another. Relative to these, on the other hand, the hollow<br>
piston 5 can be moved vertically upwards and downwards, parallel to the longitudinal<br>
extent of the stretching die 1 in this version. This possible movement of the hollow<br>
piston 5 is represented by the double arrow 11. Pneumatic connections 12 allow the<br>
control of the movement of the hollow piston 5 in the directions of the double arrow 11.<br>
The main distributor block 2 has, in a first region facing away from the bottle-shaped<br>
container to be imagined vertically above, a first flow-agent connection 13 through<br>
which, for example, air is pushed through a supply line, not shown, with controllable<br>
valves, into the inner space 4 on the device side.<br>
The second flow-agent connection 14 (e.g. for the oxidizable flow agent, hydrogen or<br>
methane) is provided in the opposite, second region of the main distributor block 2 facing<br>
the container above.<br>
The hollow eylinder 5 is provided with a supply line in the form of a central flow channel<br>
15, which represents a supply line for the air blown into the lower region, and for the<br>
mixture of air with hydrogen in the upper region. These supply lines in the upper region<br>
of the main distributor block 2 close to the bottle, or, that is to say, the second flow-agent<br>
connection 14, and the supply line 15 in the form of a central flow channel are connected<br>
to each other. The corresponding connection point 16 lies at the height of the horizontal<br>
plane 17 shown shaded in Figure 1, which is the viewing plane of Figure 2. The supply<br>
line of the second flow-agent connection 14 runs, in Figures 1 and 2, from left to right,<br>
towards the continuously vertical bore 8, and opens into an annular clearance 18 which<br>
completely surrounds the hollow piston 5 outside. From this annular clearance 18 extend<br>
openings 19 as far as the central flow channel 15. There are four openings 19, each<br>
arranged at 90Â° to each other, so that flow agent coming from the second flow-agent<br>
connection 14 via the annular clearance 18 and the openings 19 reaches the central flow<br>
15 channel as uniformly as possible. The connection point 16 is thus also the contact<br>
surface between the openings 19 and the central flow channel 15.<br>
Figure 2 shows four fixing screws 20, by means of which the hollow adapter 9 is screwed<br>
to the distributor block 7, forming the main distributor block 2. Also shown outside are<br>
four threaded holes 21, by means of which the main distributor block 2 is screwed onto<br>
the machine.<br>
A pressure sensor 22 is also shown at the bottom right of Figure 2.<br>
In both drawings, the second flow-agent connection 14 in the adaptor 9 is connected with<br>
a non-return valve 23 towards the left. To the latter, towards the outside left, are<br>
connected a first screw coupling 24 and then, furthermore, a second screw coupling 25.<br>
By means of these, a supply line 26 is formed, which connects the second flow-agent<br>
connection 14 to the control valve 27 with the magnetic coil 28.<br>
In Figure 1, the holder already mentioned above is to be imagined, which, by raising the<br>
hollow cylinder 5 upwards in the direction of the arrow 11, comes into tight engagement<br>
via the lock-washer surface 29.<br>
The ignition device, not shown, on the hollow stamping die 1 is electrically connected via<br>
the cable 30 visible in Figure 2 with a control unit, not shown.<br>
The dose of the quantity of hydrogen or methane introduced is timer-controlled via a<br>
timer control of the control valve 27. From the connection point 16, this oxidizable<br>
constituent (hydrogen or methane) is carried along into an air stream conveyed upwards<br>
in the central flow channel 15 and mixed with the air stream to a homogeneously<br>
distributed mixture. Even after the control valve 27 is cut off, the air continues to flow<br>
further upwards into the central flow channel, until it is also finally cut off. This ensures<br>
that below the centre of the hollow piston 15 and for the most part below the connection<br>
point 16, an oxidisable constituent from the second flow-agent connection 14 is not, or<br>
almost not, present.<br>
