COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
DETERGENT COMPOSITION WITH  BENEFIT AGENTS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the use of associative shear thinning polymers in solid detergent compositions. In particular, the invention relates to detergent compositions comprising associative, shear thinning hydrophobic alkoxylated acrylic polymers and/or hydrophobic alkoxylated urethane polymers. The detergent compositions of the invention provide for enhanced lather generation during wash.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Solid detergent compositions are popular as they are much cheaper than liquids. They are a popular cleaning form in developing countries as product dosage in the solid form is easier. In particular, amongst the solid forms, bars have gained popularity because of better value delivery. Detergent bars avoid spillage and the product application can be better controlled. Also, the dosage per swipe from the bar is highly controlled.<br>
All detergent compositions generate lather during the cleaning process. Lather is seen as a cue for the cleaning performance of the detergent composition; enhanced lather generation drives consumer preference.<br>
Ease of use in direct application detergent compositions like bars is preferred by consumers in developing countries. However, the consumer has to put in a lot of effort and scrub, brush and knead the garment to get lather. This is because bars show localised transfer of material. The high local concentration of bar material does not aerate easily during rubbing, brushing, scrubbing and kneading of fabric giving poor lather and localised cleaning. Further the lather generated during the main wash is not readily removed during rinsing.<br>
2<br><br>
Thus, there remains a need in the detergent industry to provide for solid forms of detergent compositions that are evenly transferred onto the substrate and provide for enhanced good quality lather in the wash and good detergency.<br>
Shear thinning polymers have been known to be added to liquid detergent formulations to provide for thickened compositions that are easily pourable and shear thinning during usage. Their use in solid detergent compositions is limited.<br>
Prior Art<br>
WO-A-95/31528discloses liquid detergent compositions comprising substantially linear, water soluble, ionic polymers of MW 10,000 to 1,000,000 Daltons which, when added to structured heavy duty liquids, makes the liquid highly shear thinning. The pour viscosity of the composition does not decrease or increase to a point where it is too thick. The compositions are also stable.<br>
EP-A-1 010 422 discloses clear cleansing detergent systems comprising a hydrophobically modified acrylic copolymer and a polyol alkoxy ester as thickeners.<br>
The Aculyn class of polymers, hydrophobically modified acrylic polymers and hydrophobic ethoxylated urethane polymers from Rohm and Haas, are widely used in the personal care industry, in particular in hair care compositions and nail polishes for their thickening properties. Aculyn polymers are also used in liquid skin compositions as thickeners.<br>
WO-A-01/12153 relates to an aqueous composition comprising (a) a skin cleansing surfactant (b) a silicone (c) a hydrocarbonaceous material (d) a cationic polymer and (e) a combination of a polyacrylate thickening polymer and an acrylate methacrylate copolymer wherein the ester group of the methacrylate is alkyl of about 12 to about 20 carbon atoms, said afkyl having about fourteen to about twenty six ethoxy groups and<br>
3<br><br>
the acrylate has one or more monomers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or one of their simple esters in quantities sufficient to provide both viscosity and visual phase stabilization. The polyacrylate polymer is a mixture of Aculyn 33 and Aculyn 22.<br>
 WO-A-00/65020 aims at providing a pourable hand dish washing detergent that can be precisely dosed, provides excellent cleaning properties, is skin tolerable and stable to temperature and storage. The compositions comprise a thick, aqueous surfactant-containing agent with anionic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant, polymer and microcapsules, in which one or more ingredients of the hand dish washing detergent are totally or partially included. Aculyn may be used in the formulation.<br>
WO-A-01/22929 relates to hair care compositions providing for good conditioning and shine to the hair comprising polysiloxane resins and at least one associative polymer. The associative polymer can be a hydrophobically modified nonionic ethoxylated urethane polymer, examples of which are Aculyn 44 and Aculyn 46.<br>
WO-A-97/42291 provides for laundry detergent compositions comprising dye transfer inhibitors and a modified polyamine fabric surface modifying agent. Suitable dye transfer agents include polyethoxylated urethanes disclosed in US-A-4079028 and US-A-4155892. Such polymers have hydrophobic end groups as well as hydrophobic residues •in the urethane linkage.<br>
Thus the prior art is directed towards the use of hydrophobic alkoxylated acrylic polymers and hydrophobic alkoxylated urethane polymers in liquid cosmetic compositions wherein the polymer has thickening properties. Alkoxylated urethane polymers with hydrophobic groups are disclosed in detergent compositions, however the required structural features to obtain desired characteristics like improved lather are not disclosed.<br>
The present inventors have now surprisingly found that solid detergent compositions comprising associative, shear thinning polymers chosen from hydrophobic alkoxylated<br>
4<br><br>
acrylic polymers and hydrophobic alkoxylated urethane polymers show increased lather during the washing process as well as increased detergency. The lather quantity, lather stability and lather creaminess are improved when the said polymers are incorporated in solid detergent formulations. The lather can also be readily removed during the rinsing stage.<br>

The pH of the detergent composition is preferably above 8.0, more preferably above 9.0. Further, when a detergent solution of 10g/litre is used, the typical ionic strength of the detergent composition when transferred onto the fabric is greater than 50 mmoles.<br>
The detergent composition of the invention essentially comprises detergent active, builder/filler and the hydrophobically modified acrylic polymer.<br>
DETERGENT ACTIVE<br>
The detergent active is generally chosen from an anionic, nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic detergent active or mixtures thereof. 0.5-80% of the active by weight of the detergent<br>
10<br><br>
composition can be incorporated in the formulation. More preferably the amount of surfactant is from 2 to 70% and most preferably from 5 to 70% by weight of the detergent composition.<br>
Anionic surfactants which can be used in the compositions of the invention are both soap and non-soap detergent compounds. Especially suitable anionic detergent active compounds are water soluble salts of organic sulphuric reaction products having in the molecular structure an alkyl radical containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and a radical chosen from sulphonic acid or sulphur acid ester radicals and mixtures thereof.<br>
The term soap denotes salts of carboxylic fatty acids. The soap may be derived from any of the triglycerides conventionally used in soap manufacture - consequently the carboxylate anions in the soap may contain from 8 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
The soap may be obtained by saponifying a fat and/or a fatty acid. The fats or oils generally used in soap manufacture may be such as tallow, tallow stearines, palm oil, palm stearines, soya bean oil, fish oil, castor oil, rice bran oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, palm kernel oil, and others. In the above process the fatty acids are derived from oils/fats selected from coconut, rice bran, groundnut, tallow, palm, palm kernel, cotton seed, soya bean, castor etc. The fatty acid soaps can also be synthetically prepared (e.g. by the oxidation of petroleum or by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide by the Fischer-Tropsch process). Resin acids, such as those present in tall oil, may be used. Naphthenic acids are also suitable.<br>
Tallow fatty acids can be derived from various animal sources and generally comprise about 1-8% myristic acid, about 21-32% palmitic acid, about 14-31% stearic acid, about 0-4% palmitoleic acid, about 36-50% oleic acid and about 0-5% linoleic acid. A typical distribution is 2.5% myristic acid, 29% palmitic acid, 23% stearic acid, 2% palmitoleic acid, 41.5% oleic acid, and 3% linoleic acid. Other similar mixtures, such as those from palm oil and those derived from various animal tallow and lard are also included.<br>
ll<br><br>
Coconut oil refers to fatty acid mixtures having an approximate carbon chain length distribution of 8% C8, 7% C10, 48% C12, 17% C14, 8% C16, 2% C18, 7% oleic and 2% linoleic acids (the first six fatty acids listed being saturated). Other sources having similar carbon chain length distributions, such as palm kernel oil and babassu kernel oil, are included within the term coconut oil.<br>
The term total fatty matter, usually abbreviated to TFM is used to denote the percentage by weight of fatty acid and triglyceride residues present without taking into account the accompanying cations. The total fatty matter is preferably between 20 to 85% by weight of the soap bar.<br>
For a soap having 18 carbon atoms, an accompanying sodium cation will generally amount to about 8% by weight. Other cations may be employed as desired for example zinc, potassium, magnesium, alkyl ammonium and aluminium.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent active compounds can be broadly described as compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups, which are hydrophilic in nature, with an organic hydrophobic compound which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the hydrophilic or polyoxyalkylene radical which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.<br>
Suitable amphoteric detergent-active compounds that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines containing an alkyl group of 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic radical substituted by an anionic water-solubilizing group, for instance sodium 3-dodecylamino-propionate, sodium 3-dodecylaminopropane sulphonate    and    sodium    N-2-hydroxydodecyl-N-methyitaurate.    Suitable    cationic<br>
12<br><br>
detergent-active compounds are quaternary ammonium salts having an aliphatic radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, for instance cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide.<br>
Suitable zwitterionic detergent-active compounds that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, sulphonium and phosphonium compounds having an aliphatic radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic radical substituted by an anionic water-solubilising group, for instance 3-(N-N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammonium), propane-1-sulphonate betaine, 3-(dodecylmethyl sulphonium) propane-1-sulphonate betaine and 3-(cetylmethylphosphonium) ethane sulphonate betaine.<br>
Further examples of suitable detergent-active compounds are compounds commonly used as surface-active agents given in the well-known textbooks "Surface Active Agents", Volume I by Schwartz and Perry and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volume II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
INORGANIC FILLER<br>
Fillers suitable for use in the formulation include kaolin, calcium carbonate (calcite), soapstone, china clay and the like, used singly or in combination. The filler is present in an amount of from 5 to 75% by weight of the detergent composition, preferably from 30 to 70 wt%.<br>
BUILDER<br>
Preferably builders are used in the detergent composition. The detergency builders used in the formulation are preferably inorganic and suitable builders include alkali metal aluminosilicates (zeolites), alkali metal carbonate, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), tetrasodium   pyrophosphate   (TSPP),   citrates,   sodium   nitrilotriacetate   (NTA)   and<br>
13<br><br>
combinations of these. Builders are preferably used in an amount ranging from 1 to 50% by wt. Zeolite if used as builder is present at levels not exceeding 10% by wt.<br>
OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS<br>
Inorganic particulates are an optional ingredient of the formulation and may be incorporated especially for hard surface cleaning compositions. Preferably, the particulate phase comprises a particulate structuring system and/or abrasive, which is insoluble in water. In the alternative, the abrasive may be soluble and present in such excess to any water present in the composition that the solubility of the abrasive in the aqueous phase is exceeded and consequently solid abrasive exists in the composition.<br>
Suitable inorganic particulate material can be selected from, particulate zeolites, calcite's, dolomites, feldspars, siliceous, silicates, other carbonates, bicarbonates, sulphates and polymeric materials such as polyethylene.<br>
The most preferred inorganic particulate materials are dolomite, sodium hydrogen carbonate, borax, sodium/potassium sulfate, zeolite and feldspars.<br>
Other additives such as one or more water insoluble particulate materials like polysaccharides such as starch or modified starches and cellulose may be incorporated.<br>
Conventional ingredients preferably selected from enzymes, antiredeposition agents, fluorescers, colour, preservatives and perfumes, also bleaches, bleach precursors, bleach stabilisers, sequestrants, soil release agents (usually polymers) and other polymers may optionally be incorporated in the solid detergent composition.<br><br>
14<br><br>
PROCESS OF BAR MANUFACTURE<br>
The solid detergent composition of the invention can be made by any conventional process known in the art. In a preferred embodiment of making a detergent bar, the anionic surfactant is neutralised in a Sigma mixer by using a suitable base. Fillers like sodium carbonate and china clay and builder are added and the mass is completely mixed. Thereafter, a solution of alkaline silicate and optionally more fillers are added. Optional ingredients like colourant, enzyme, perfume, flourescer are then added. The hydrophobically modified acrylic polymer is added at any stage of processing, preferably before the addition of a base like calcium hydroxide.<br>
After the addition of all ingredients, the entire mass is mixed and the dough is then plodded using a single-stage, single-screw extruder.<br>
Without being limited by theory, it is theorised that the hydrophobically modified acrylic polymer builds rheology so as to facilitate processing. Further, when the bar containing the polymer is applied onto the fabric, the bar material is transferred in such a way that it spreads on fabric rather than getting transferred locally.<br>
15<br><br>
The invention will now be illustrated by non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
All parts are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
Process to make detergent bar Comparative Example A. Examples 1-4<br>
Soda ash was taken in the sigma mixer to neutralise 92% Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulphonic (LAS) Acid. The acid was then completely neutralised with sodium carbonate to get sodium LAS. Thereafter more sodium carbonate was added to the mass followed by the addition of china clay, aluminium sulphate, and sodium tripoly phosphate (STPP). Half of the total calicte was also added and the mass was completely mixed. Thereafter, 40% solution of alkaline silicate, and the rest of the calcite are added. Aculyn™ 22, Aculyn™ 28, Aculyn™ 44 and Aculyn™ 46 were added at this stage in Examples 1,2,3 and 4 respectively. This was followed by the addition of calcium hydroxide, color, perfume and fluorescer.<br>
After the addition of all ingredients, the entire mass was mixed for about 10 minutes. The sigma mixer was heated by hot water circulation and the temperature was maintained at 70°C. The dough was then plodded using a single-stage single-screw extruder, electrically heated to 70°C and the bars were extruded.<br>

Determination of Lather Quantity and Foam Stability<br>
The bars of Comparative Example A and Examples 1-4 were stored for 2 weeks. Thereafter they were evaluated for lather using the following protocol.<br>
Cotton fabric of size 30 cm by 10cm was fixed onto a trough using screws to hold the fabric in place. A dispersion of 0.5 g/litre antifoam in water (of zero hardness) was prepared. The model antifoam was prepared using an equal composition of oleic acid, triolein, palmitic acid, and tripalmitin. 15 ml of this solution was added to the trough to soak the fabric. The cloth to liquor ratio was 1:5.<br>
The bar was fixed onto a suitable holder and the fabric was rubbed for 10 seconds. More water containing the antifoam was then added to the trough to give a cloth to liquor ratio<br>
17<br><br>
of 1:10. The fabric was then rubbed with a plastic brush in a controlled manner for 10 seconds. The solution with the dissolved surfactant and foam was carefully transferred from the trough to a 100 ml graduated cylinder taking care not to disturb the lather. The fabric piece was gently squeezed to drain the solution into the cylinder.<br>
The cylinder top was closed with the help of a stopper and the solution was shaken for 20 seconds. The cylinder was allowed to stand for 10 seconds and then the height of the foam was measured. This represents the volume of the lather (expressed in ml).<br>
The foam and the solution in the cylinder was left undisturbed for another 5 mins and the foam height was measured again. The drop in height indicates the foam stability. The quality of the foam - bubble size and thickness was also determined qualitatively.<br>
The lather after rinsing was measured as follows. The fabric piece treated as above was dipped in 60 ml of water. The cloth to liquor ratio was 1:20. The procedure was repeated thrice and the lather solution transferred into a 100 ml cylinder. The fabric piece was gently squeezed to drain the solution into the cylinder. The above mentioned cylinder shake procedure was followed to get the amount of lather after rinsing.<br>
The procedure was repeated with water of hardness 24 FH.<br>
The data on lather volume generated (cm3)during washing and rinsing for the bars of Comparative Example A and Examples 1 to 4 are presented in Table 2. The foam stability and the quality of the foam generated by the bars are presented in Table 3. The maximum deviation is 3 units and the average deviation is 1 unit.<br>

The data clearly shows that the amount of lather generated is substantially increased when the detergent bars of the invention are used.<br>
Table 3:<br><br>

The data presented in Table 3 shows that decrease in foam height is substantially reduced for the bars of the invention as compared to a control bar; bars of the invention thereby showing improved foam stability. Further, the foam generated by the bars of the invention has smaller bubbles and is thicker and creamier in appearance.<br>
Bar attributes<br>
The detergent bars of Comparative Example A and Examples 1 to 4 were also evaluated by a trained in-house panel of 19 members. All members used each sample<br>
19<br><br>
for 3 days and evaluated the bars at the end of this period for attributes like brightness of the bar, soapiness, economy of use of the bar, water required for rinsing the fabric after washing and perfume impact.<br>
Soapiness was evaluated by generating lather using water manually. Increased soapiness indicated a thicker and creamier lather. Perfume impact was evaluated during washing of the fabric.<br>
The evaluation was done on a 10 point scale. The higher the score, the better the attribute. The statistical significance of the data was 99.9%.<br>
The data are presented in Table 4.<br>
Table 4:<br><br>
Attribute	Comparative   Example A	Example 2<br>
Brightness	5.1	5.5<br>
Soapiness	3.7	4.0<br>
Perfume	3.3	3.8<br>
Water   requirement   for rinsing	6.7	6.8<br>
Economy of use	5.7	5.6<br>
Softness of fabric after wash	6.0	6.1<br>
The bar according to the invention was perceived to be brighter, more 'soapy'and to have a higher impact of perfume during use. The water required for rinsing, economy of use and fabric softness was similar to the control bar. The overall performance of the bar of the invention was found to be superior to the bar of Comparative Example A.<br>
Thus the present invention provides for solid detergent compositions that provide for good lather and better detergency. Further the overall attributes and performance of these compositions is superior to conventional formulations.<br>
