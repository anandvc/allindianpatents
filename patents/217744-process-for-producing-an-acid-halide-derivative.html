Indanonecarboxylic  acid  esters  are useful as  intermediates  for<br>

Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 05-25164__dj5scloses a process for producing an indanonecarboxylic acid ester by esterifying a substituted indanone with, for example, dimethyl carbonate.  As an example, a process for producing methyl indanonecarboxylate is disclosed, in which 5-chloroindanone is allowed to react with dimethyl carbonate in the presence of sodium hydride. However, this process achieves a yield of at most 50% and<br>
requires the use of sodium hydride which is dangerous and is difficult to handle.<br>
Certain processes for producing malonic acid diester derivatives, malonic acid monoester derivatives, and acid halide derivatives have been known.  For example, J. Med. Chem. , 13, 1970, 820 discloses a process for producing diethyl 3-chlorobenzylmalonate by allowing diethyl malonate to react with m-chlorobenzyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydride. J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 74, 1952, 5897 discloses a process for producing a malonic monoester (half ester) by allowing diethyl phenylmalonate to react in the presence of potassium hydroxide in an aqueous ethanol solution.  Chem. Pharm. Bull., 22, 1974, 1795 discloses a process for producing ethyl 2-chloroformyl-3-phenyl-propionate by allowing 3-iphenyl-2-ethoxycarbonylpropionic acid to react with thionyl chloride.  However, these processes have never been applied to the production of a<br>
2-haloformyl-3-phenyl-propionic acid ester having a substituent on its aryl group.<br>

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, was cooled to 5°C or below and was adjusted to pH 2.5<br>
using 1.7% by weight hydrochloric acid.  The product was extracted with three portions of 102.3 g of toluene, from which toluene was removed under reduced pressure to yield 8.7 g of a concentrated residue.  The residue contained 95% by weight of 3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-2-methoxycarbonylpropionic acid (yield:  8.3 g, 92%).<br>
[Step C:  Production of methyl 2-chloroformyl-3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-propionate]<br>
A total of 8.0 g of the concentrated residue containing 3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-2-methoxycarbonylpropionic acid prepared in Step B was dissolved in 32.8 g of 1,2-dichloroethane in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas, followed by addition of 11.8 g of thionyl chloride and 0.05 g of dimethylformamide.  The mixture was stirred at 40°C for 7 hours, from which 1,2-dichloroethane and unreacted'thionyl chloride were removed under reduced pressure to yield 7 . 98 g of methyl 2-chloroformyl-3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-propionate. The NMR spectral data of this compound are shown below.<br>
[Spectral data of methyl 2-chloroformyl-3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-propionate] 1H-NMR (CDC13) ppm:  3.27 (d, 2H, C1C6H4-CH2-CH) , 3.78 (s, 3H, -COOCH3), 4.07 (t, 1H, C1C6H4-CH2-CH), 7.07-7.26 (m, 4H, ClC6H4-} —)<br>
Example 2<br>
Production of methyl<br>
5-chloro-l-oxo-2,3-dihydroindene-2-carboxylate (i.e., 5-chloro-2-methoxycarbonylindan-l-one)<br>
A total of 9.0 g of anhydrous aluminum chloride was suspended in 151.3 g of 1,2-dichloroethane by stirring in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas and was cooled to 0°C.  To the cooled suspension was added dropwise a mixture of 7.98 g of methyl 2-chloroformyl-3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-propionate prepared in Example 1 and 151.3 g of 1,2-dichloroethane held<br>
at 5°C or below, followed by stirring under the same conditions for 2 hours.  The reaction mixture was added dropwise to 53.6 g of 1.7% by weight hydrochloric acid cooled at 5°C or below, followed by stirring under the same conditions for 1 hour. The 1,2-dichloroethane layer was separated from the aqueous layer, and the product was further extracted from the aqueous layer with two portions of 15.1 g of 1, 2-dichloroethane.  The 1, 2-dichloroethane layers were collected and were washed with 33.0 g of water, from which 1,2-dichloroethane was removed under reduced pressure.  The concentrated residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography [mobile phase: hexane/ethyl acetate=4/l (by volume)] to yield 5.21 g of methyl 5-chloro-l-oxo-2,3-dihydroindene-2-carboxylate as a beige solid in a yield of 70% on the basis of 3-(3'-chlorophenyl)-2-methoxycarbonylpropionic acid.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present invention can efficiently produce indanonecarboxylic acid esters without any safety problems even on an industrial scale.  The indanonecarboxylic acid esters are useful as intermediates for insecticides.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.  Oh the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.  The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:-<br>
1. A process for producing an acid halide derivative represented by following Formula (I) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X and Y may be the same or different and are each a halogen atom; and R is a lower alkyl group, the process comprising the steps of:<br>
(A)      allowing a benzyl halide derivative represented by following Formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X is as defined above; Z is a halogen atom, and X and Z may be the same or different, to react with a malonic diester represented by following Formula (III) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is lower alkyl group, in the presence of a base to yield a malonic diester derivative represented by following Formula (IV) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X and R are as defined above; (B)      hydrolyzing the malonic diester derivative represented by Formula   (IV)   to   yield   a   malonic   monoester   derivative represented by following Formula (V) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X and R are as defined above; and (C)      allowing the  malonic  monoester  drivative  represented  by Formula (V) to react with a halogenating agent to yield  the acid halide derivative represented by Formula (I).<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein X and Y are chlorine atoms and R is a methyl group in formula (I).<br>
3.	A process for producing an acid halide derivative substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the foregoing examples.<br></td>
