FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a motor assembly to interchangeably accommodate either a resolver or an encoder, an encoder assembly and a method of assembling a motor. The present invention relates generally to the field of motors for use with sensors such as resolvers and encoders. More specifically, the present invention relates to the design of an encoder that is readily useful with a motor that was designed for use with a resolver.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many motors, e.g., brushless DC servomotors, were previously designed to include a resolver. A resolver is useful to provide position and velocity information of a rotor for the motor. This information is used by external electronics to control the velocity and position of the rotor.<br>
Somewhat recently, the use of encoders instead of resolves has become more prevalent. While not appropriate for all applications, encoders have been found to generally have better performance than a resolver. However, the use of an encoder typically requires that the end bell of the motor be modified so as to receive the encoder Instead of the resolver. The change in the end bell is required because the physical size and mounting footprint of the encoder is generally not compatible with the design of a motor for use with a resolver. A change to the end bell of the motor is therefore required if an encoder is to be used in place of a resolver. Accordingly, manufactures are required to keep in inventory different parts in order to accommodate the use of a resolver or encoder thereby increasing the cost of manufacture. Also, the assembly of motors with different sensors requires the use of different processes which thereby increases the time required for manufacture.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a motor assembly that can readily accommodate either a resolver or an encoder without the use of additional parts and assembly processes.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a motor assembly that can readily accommodate either a resolver or an encoder. More specifically, the preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to an encoder that is useful with a motor designed for use with a resolver.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, a motor that can interchangeably accommodate a resolver or an encoder is provided. The motor includes a housing having a top portion with a curved recess located therein. A rotatable shaft extends from the recess of the housing. A connector adjacent the shaft is adapted to fit within the recess of the housing. An encoder is connected to the connector and is adapted to allow the shaft to pass therethrough. Accordingly, a motor is provided that may interchangeably accommodate a resolver or an encoder.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, an encoder assembly for use with a motor is provided. The motor has a top surface with a curved recess located therein. A rotatable shaft extends outward from the top surface of the motor. The encoder includes a ring-shaped connector adapted to fit within the recess of the housing. An encoder body is connected to the ring-shaped connector and is adapted to allow the shaft to pass therethrough. A single fastening is adapted to secure the encoder to the motor.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, a method of assembling a motor having a sensor is provided. The method includes the step of providing a motor adapted to accommodate one of a resolver and an encoder. The method also includes the step of providing the other of the resolver and the encoder adapted to be used interchangeably with the one of the resolver and the encoder. Accordingly, a motor having a single configuration is useful with either of a resolver or encoder.<br><br>
The use of the term "encoder(s)" is intended to be interpreted broadly to Inc|'ude different types of encoders such as optical, magnetic or capacitive.<br>
The present invention, together with attendant objects and advantages, will be best understood with reference to the detailed description below in connection with the attached drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a motor assembly including an encoder in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective exploded view of the motor assembly as illustrated in FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is a side exploded view of the motor assembly as illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 2; FIG. 4 is a top view of the motor assembly as illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 3; and FIG. 5 is a cross-section taken along the lines 5-5 of FIG. 4.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is directed to a motor for use with a sensor, such as an encoder. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the encoder of the present invention is particularly useful with brushless DC servo motors. However, the present Invention is useful with motors such as AC servomotors or stepper motors as well as other motors known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It should also be recognized that while an optical encoder is described and shown herein, the present invention has application with other types of encoders, e.g. magnetic or capacitive. In addition, the present invention is usefial In various applications such as industrial robots.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an assembled view of a motor assembly 10 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. The motor assembly 10 includes, in part, a motor housing 14, a connector 18 and an encoder 22. The motor housing 14 is a<br><br>
conventional element such as Part No. MPM662FME-BM manufactured by MTS Automation of New Ulm, Minn. Also, the encoder 22 is a conventional optical encoder element such as Part No. F142048/61932 manufactured by Danaher Controls of Gumee, IL. Fastener elements, including screws 26 and clips 28, are used to secure the connector 18 to the motor housing 14. As best illustrated in FIGS. 2-3 &amp; 5, a shaft or rotor 30 extends from the motor housing 14 and passes through a channel or shaft 32 within the encoder 22. Fastener elements, such as a jam nut 34 and a washer 36 are used to secure the encoder 22 to the motor shaft 30.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, the connector 18 includes a servo ring 40 and a flexure or flexible connector 42. The servo ring 40 includes a ridge 44 that extends around the periphery thereof Screws 26 and clips 28 are used to secure the servo ring 40. As best seen in FIGS. 1 &amp; 5, the clips 28 engage a ridge 44. In order to secure the servo ring 40 and more generally, the connector 18 to the motor housing 14. With reference to FIGS. 2-3, the servo ring 40 also includes opposing pins 50 that extend upward therefrom. Opposing cutout portions 52 are also provided on the servo ring 40. In the preferred embodiment, the servo ring 40 is formed from plastic materials or other materials such as steel or aluminum.<br>
The flexible connector 42 includes a plurality of apertures or first openings 58 and a plurality of apertures or second openings 60. The first openings 58 are sized to engage the pins 50 of the servo ring 40. The second openings 60 are sized to engage a plurality of pins 68 (as seen in FIG. 3) that extend downwardly from the encoder 22. The pins 68 then extend into the cutout portions 52 of the servo ring 40. In the preferred embodiment, the flexible connector 42 is formed from a thin flexible steel material. However, it should be recognized that other known materials could also be implemented. The jam nut 34 and the washer 36 are then used to secure the encoder 22 to the motor shaft 30. More specifically, the jam nut 34 secures the shaft 32 against the shoulder 74 of the motor shaft 30.<br><br>
Once assembled, the screws 26 and clips 48 secure the connector 18 to the motor housing 14. The encoder 22 is attached to the connector 18 through the tabs 68. The jam nut 34 and washer 36 then secure the encoder 22 against the motor shaft 30. It is an important aspect of the present invention to recognize that it allows the encoder to be fastened to the motor housing with the use of a single fastening element, e.g., the jam nut. While more than one fastening element could be used, the present invention provides for the use of a single fastening element.<br>
The present invention also provides for a method of operation. In particular, a method of assembling a motor having a sensor is provided. A first step requires that a motor adapted to accommodate one of a resolver and an encoder be provided. A second step requires that the other of the resolver and the encoder be adapted to be used interchangeably with the one of the resolver and the encoder. Accordingly, a motor that is adapted for use with one of a resolver or an encoder is readily useful with the other of a resolver or encoder. In the illustrated embodiment, the motor housing is designed for use with a resolver and the encoder is adapted to fit the footprint of the resolver.<br>
The embodiments described above and shown herein are illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the claims rather than by the foregoing description and attached drawings. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, the shape and size of the motor, connector and encoder may be changed to suit the needs of a particular application. Also, while the preferred embodiment is directed to an encoder assembly that will fit the footprint of a resolver, the claims should be construed broadly to cover, in some instances, the opposite relationship. More specifically, a motor assembly designed for use with an encoder and a resolver designed to fit the footprint of an encoder. Accordingly, these and any other changes which come within the scope of the claims are intended to be embraced herein.<br><br><br>
