A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to a patient monitoring system such as Invasive Blood pressure monitor and more particularly relates to a sensor device for the IBP monitor to detect the disconnection of transducer with the IBP monitor.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The Blood Pressure (strictly speaking: vascular pressure) refers to the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels and constitutes one of the principal vital signs. The pressure of the circulating blood decreases as the blood moves through Arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins. The term blood pressure generally refers to arterial pressure, i.e., the pressure in the larger arteries, arteries being the blood vessels which:take blood away from the heart. The Arterial pressure is most commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer, which uses the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure. Although many modem vascular pressure devices no longer use mercury, vascular pressure values are still universally reported in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).<br>
[0003] The systolic arterial pressure is defined as the peak pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle. The diastolic arterial pressure is the lowest pressure (at the resting phase of the cardiac cycle). The average pressure throughout the cardiac cycle is reported as mean arterial pressure. The pulse pressure reflects the difference between the maximum and minimum pressures measured. The<br><br>
Arterial pressures can be measured invasively by penetrating the skin and measuring<br>
^<br>
inside the blood vessels) or non-invasively.<br>
[0004] The non-invasive auscultatory and oscillometric measurements are simpler and quicker than invasive measurements. They require less expertise in fitting, have virtually no complications arid are less unpleasant and painful for the patient. However, non-invasive measures may yield somewhat lower accuracy and small systematic differences in numerical results. Non-invasive measurement methods are more commonly used for routine examinations and monitoring.<br>
[0005] The auscultatory method uses a stethoscope and a sphygmomanometer. This comprises an inflatable cuff placed around the upper arm at roughly the same vertical<br>
height as the heart, attached to a mercury or aneroid manometer. The mercury<br>
■I i!<br>
manometer, considered to be the goldstandard measurement technique for arterial<br>
ii<br>
pressure measurement, measures the height of a column of mercury, giving an<br>
absolute result without need for calibration, and consequently not subject to the errors<br>
and drift of calibration whichfaffect other methods. The use of mercury manometers is<br>
often required in clinical trials and for the clinical measurement of hypertension in<br>
i high risk patients, including firegnant women.<br>
[0006] A cuif of appropriate size is fitted and inflated manually by repeatedly squeezing a rubber bulb until the artery is completely occluded. Listening with the stethoscope to the brachial'artery at the elbow, the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff When blood just starts to flow in the artery, the turbulent flow creates a "whooshing" or pounding (first Korotkoff sound). The pressure at which this<br><br>
.1	I<br>
'^  sound is first heard is the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is further released i   until no sound can be heard (fifth Korotkoff sound), at the diastolic arterial pressure. '   Sometimes, the pressure is palpated (felt by hand) to get an estimate before auscultation.<br>
[0007] The Oscillometric methods are sometimes used in the long-term measurement<br>
and sometimes in general practice. The equipment is functionally similar to that of the<br>
il<br>
auscultatory method, but with an electronic pressure sensor (transducer) fitted in to detect the blood pressure, instead of using the stethoscope and the expert's ear. In practice, the pressure sensor is a calibrated electronic device with a numerical readout of blood pressure. To maintain accuracy, calibration must be checked periodically, unlike the inherently accurate mercury manometer. In most cases the cuff is inflated and released by an electrically operated pump and valve, which may be fitted on the<br>
I!<br>
wnst (elevated to heart height), although the upper arm is preferred. They vary widely<br>
i in accuracy, and should be checked at specified intervals and if necessary recalibrated.<br>
[0008] The Oscillometric measurement requires less skill than the auscultatory technique, and may be suitable for use by untrained staff and for automated patient home monitoring. The Oscillometric monitors may produce inaccurate readings in patients with heart and circulation problems that include arterial sclerosis, arrhythmia, preeclampsia, pulsus altemans, and pulsus paradoxus. The term NIBP, for Non-Invasive Blood Pressure, is often used to describe oscillometric monitoring equipment.<br>
[0009] The Arterial blood pressure (BP) is most accurately measured invasively through an arterial line. The Invasive arterial pressure measurement with intravascular<br><br>
cannulae involves direct measurement of arterial pressure by placing a cannula needle<br>
■I<br>
ij in an artery (usually radial, femoral, dorsalis pedis or brachial. This is usually done by { an anesthesiologist or surgeon in a hospital.<br>
I<br>
.;   [0010] The cannula must be connected to a sterile, fluid-filled system, which is<br>
i<br>
.   connected to an electronic pressure transducer. The advantage of this system is that<br>
i   pressure is constantly monitored beat-by-beat, and a waveform (a graph of pressure<br>
f against time) can be displayed. This invasive technique is regularly employed in<br>
human and veterinary intensive care medicine, anesthiology and for research purposes.<br>
■ t<br>
[0011] The Cannulation for invasive vascular pressure monitoring is infrequently associated with complications such as thrombosis, infection and bleeding. The Patients with invasive arterial monitoring require very close supervision, as there is a danger of severe bleeding. When the line becomes disconnected. It is generally reserved for patients where rapid variations in arterial pressure are anticipated.<br>
j:    [0012] The Invasive vascular pressure monitors are pressure monitoring systems<br>
II	II<br>
'    designed to acquire pressure information for display and processing. There are a<br>
1!<br>
j    variety of invasive vascular pressure monitors for trauma, critical care, and operating<br>
room applications. These include single pressure, dual pressure, and multi-parameter<br>
!;     (i.e. pressure / temperature), the monitors can be used for measurement and foUow-<br>
!i	up of arterial, central venous, pulmonary arterial, left atrial, right atrial, femoral<br>
■I<br>
I     arterial, umbilical venous, umbilical arterial, and intracranial pressures.<br><br>
[0013] The Vascular pressure p^ameters are derived in the monitor's microcomputer<br>
system.   Usually,   the   systolic,   diastolic   and   mean   pressures   are   displayed<br>
I<br>
simultaneously for pulsatile waveforms (i.e. arterial and pulmonary arterial). Some monitors also calculate and display the CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure) and CVP (Central Venious Pressure). Normally, a zero key on the front of the monitor makes pressure zeroing extremely fast and easy. The Alarm limits may be set to assist the medical professional responsible for observing the patient. The High and low alarms may be set on displayed temperature parameters.<br>
[0014] The Blood pressure is one of the most important vital signs used in the<br>
I<br>
assessment of a patient's cardibvascular health. In critical care, it is usually monitored continuously using an invasive fluid-filled monitoring line, also called an arterial line,<br>
in which a catheter is inserted into an artery and blood pressure from the artery is<br>
{j<br>
i| transmitted to a blood pressure transducer through fluid-filled tubing 12 to 84 inches<br>
long. The arterial pressure as measured by the transducer is displayed on an invasive<br>
blood pressure (IBP) monitor, i;<br>
[0015] The currently available sensor detection systems detect an abnormal condition or disconnection of cable connecting the transducer to the monitor. At present the detection systems sense only the presence of cables or the cable disconnection to assume the disconnection of sensor or the transducer with the PMS. Such detection arrangements generated only the confusion in detecting the presence of transducers.<br>
[0016] Hence there is a need to develop a sensor detection system to detect the disconnection of the transducer with the patient monitoring system such as IBP<br><br>
monitor. Also there is a further need to develop a sensor system to detect a channel fault condition. Also there is yet another need to develop a sensor system to detect a sensor -off condition, when a pressure sensor is connected to the patient monitoring system.<br>
C) OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] The primary object of the present invention is to develop a transducer detection system to detect the disconnection or the absence of transducer that is connected to an IBP monitor.<br>
[0018] Another object of the present invention is to develop a transducer detection system to detect the absence of transducer by measuring the excitation voltage applied to the transducer.<br>
[0019] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a transducer detection<br>
'I<br>
system to sense a channel fault condition by measuring the applied excitation voltage.<br>
[0020] Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a transducer detection system to identify a sensor -off condition, when a pressure sensor is connected to the system.<br>

The excitation current generator circuit has a current limited voltage source to produce an excitation voltage. The generated excitation voltage is passed to a transducer through a current sensing and measurement circuit. The excitation voltage is applied to the transducer to measure the arterial pressure and to measure the BP value.<br>
[0038] The current sensing and measurement circuit measures the excitation current supplied to the transducer circuit by measuring the current drawn by the transducer.<br>
r<br>
The measured current is converted into a voltage using a current-voltage converter. The converted voltage is input into comparator. A reference voltage generator is connected to the comparator I to supply a reference voltage to the comparator. The comparator compares the input voltage corresponding to the output of the current sensing circuit with the input reference voltage to detect the disconnection of a transducer or the absence of a transducer or a channel fault. A microcontroller receives the detection signal output from the comparator and outputs a message to indicate the detection result to a user. The detection result is displayed on the monitor to indicate the detection result to the user.<br>
