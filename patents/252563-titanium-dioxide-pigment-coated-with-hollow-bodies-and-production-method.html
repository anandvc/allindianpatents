PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a titanium dioxide pigment of high opacity, a method for its manufacture and its use in decorative laminating papers or decorative foils.<br>
Technological Background of the Invention<br>
Decorative laminating papers and decorative foils are part of a decorative, thermosetting coating material, used with preference for finishing furniture surfaces, for laminate flooring and in interior finishing. Laminates is the term used to denote materials in which, for example, several impregnated, stacked layers of paper, or paper and hardboard or fibreboard, are pressed together. The use of special synthetic resins achieves extraordinarily high resistance of the laminates to marring, impact, chemicals and heat.<br>
The use of decorative laminating papers (which is always also intended to mean decorative foils below) makes it possible to produce decorative surfaces, where the decorative laminating paper serves not only as facing paper, e.g. to hide unattractive wood material surfaces, but also as a carrier for the synthetic resin. The demands imposed on decorative laminating paper include, among others/ opacity (hiding power), light-fastness (graying resistance), colour-fastness, wet strength, suitability for impregnation and printability.<br>
The economic efficiency of the manufacturing process for decorative laminating<br>
papers is determined by, among other things, the opacity of the pigment in the<br>
paper. In principle, a pigment based on titanium dioxide is eminently suitable for<br>
achieving the necessary opacity of the decorative laminating paper. During paper<br>
manufacture, a titanium dioxide pigment, or a titanium dioxide pigment suspension,<br>
is usually mixed with a pulp suspension. In addition to pigment and pulp as the<br>
feedstock, use is generally also made of auxiliaries, such as wet-strength agents, and<br>
further additives where appropriate. The interactions of the individual components<br>
(pulp, pigment, auxiliaries and additives, water) with each other contribute to<br>
-2-<br><br>
formation of the paper and determine the retention of the pigment. Retention is the capacity for retaining all inorganic substances in the paper during production.<br>
It is known that an improvement in opacity can be achieved by special treatment of the surface of the titanium dioxide pigment.<br>
US 5,942,281 A and US 5,665,466 A describe a surface treatment in which a first layer of aluminium oxide phosphate is applied at an acidic pH value of 4 to 6, and a second layer of aluminium oxide is precipitated in a pH range from 3 to 10, preferably at roughly pH 7. An improvement in retention is achieved by a third layer consisting of magnesium oxide, the result being that the pigment produced is characterised by consecutive layers of aluminium oxide phosphate, aluminium oxide and magnesium oxide.<br>
US 6,962,622 B2 discloses a titanium dioxide pigment blend that is composed of a pigment with high greying resistance (pigment Type A) and a pigment with a coating displaying an elevated Si02 and AI2O3 content, precipitated in fluffy form (pigment Type B).<br>
US 6,143,064 A describes the coating of pigment particles with precipitated calcium carbonate, where the size of the calcium carbonate particles is between 30 and 100 nm. The titanium dioxide coated with calcium carbonate achieves higher opacity in the paper. In this context, the calcium particles assume the function of spacers, such that the pigment particles display better distribution in the paper. The minimum distance between the pigment particles is said to correspond roughly to the size of the pigment particles.<br>
US 5,886,069 A and US 5,650,002 A describe Ti02 pigment particles displaying both a continuous inorganic coating and a coating of discrete inorganic particles with a diameter of 5 to 100 nm. The surface coating sequence can be selected at random, as can the form of the discrete particles. Production is performed by mixing a colloidal suspension of the discrete particles with a Ti02 slurry.<br>
US 2003 0024437 Al discloses a pigment blend with pigment particles onto whose surface spherical particles, such as calcium carbonate, silicon oxide, aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide or titanium oxide, have been precipitated in-situ.<br>

Object and Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an alternative titanium dioxide pigment with good opacity and good retention for use in decorative laminating papers. The object of the invention is furthermore to provide a method for manufacturing a titanium dioxide pigment of this kind.<br>
The object is solved by a titanium dioxide pigment that contains titanium dioxide particles and where a layer containing aluminium phosphate, aluminium oxide and hollow bodies is located on the particle surface.<br>
The object is furthermore solved by a method for manufacturing a coated titanium dioxide pigment, comprising the steps<br>
a)	Provision of an aqueous suspension of uncoated titanium dioxide particles,<br>
b)	Addition of an aluminium component and a phosphorus component,<br>
c)	Addition of hollow bodies,<br>
d)	Setting of the pH value of the suspension to a value in the range between 4 and 9.<br>
Further advantageous versions of the invention are described in the sub-claims.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Here and below, the term "oxide" is to be taken to also mean the corresponding hydrous oxides or the hydrates. All data disclosed below regarding pH value, temperature, concentration in % by weight or % by volume, etc., are to be interpreted as including all values lying in the range of the respective measuring accuracy known to the person skilled in the art. When used in the context of the present patent, the term "significant quantity" or "significant content" indicates the minimum quantity of a component, upwards of which the properties of the mixture are affected in the framework of the measuring accuracy.<br>
-4-<br><br>
The titanium dioxide pigment according to the invention is characterised by the use of hollow bodies. The hollow bodies ca include hollow spherical shapes or spheres including hollow microbodies or hollow microspheres. The invention includes the use of hollow bodies during post-treatment The hollow bodies are attached to the particle surface and act as spacers between the individual pigment particles. The hollow bodies can be of an inorganic and organic nature. They preferably display a mean diameter of 5 to 1,000 nm. The hollow bodies are characterised by the inclusion of air, where the inclusion of air may possibly not be present until after drying of the pigment.<br>
Organic hollow bodies are used as extenders in paints, for example. The hollow bodies act as spacers between the pigment particles and, as a result of their entrapped air, lead to higher hiding power by exploiting the favourable difference between the refractive indices of the pigment and air ("Qualitatsverbesserung -Ropaque™ Opaque Polymer zur Qualitatsverbesserung von Lacken und Farben" ["Quality Improvement - Ropaque™ Opaque Polymer for Improving the Quality of Paints and Coatings"], Phanomen Farbe 2/98, 1/99). The publication "Hollow latex particles: synthesis and applications" (McDonald et al., Advances in Colloid and Interface Science 99 (2002) 181 - 213) provides a review of the manufacture of organic hollow spheres. An exemplary description of the manufacture of inorganic hollow spheres is given in "Nanoengineering of Inorganic and Hybrid Hollow Spheres by Colloidal Templating" (Caruso et al., Science 1998, Vol. 282, p. 1111). The patent application WO 02/074431 Al discloses the manufacture of inorganic hollow bodies and their use in catalysis and in photonics.<br>
In the method according to the invention, a layer of aluminium-phosphorus compounds in a blend with hollow bodies and with aluminium oxide if applicable is precipitated on the Ti02 particle surface. The composition is dependent on the quantities of the aluminium and phosphorus components used. For simplicity, this layer is referred to as the aluminium oxide phosphate/hollow sphere layer below.<br>
-5-<br><br>
The post-treatment method on which the invention is based starts with an aqueous, and preferably wet-milled, TiO2 suspension (Step a)). Where appropriate, wet-milling is performed in the presence of a dispersant. The TiO2 comprises uncoated T1O2 particles, i.e. TiO2 base material particles, produced by the sulphate process (SP) or the chloride process (CP). The base material is usually stabilised, by addition of aluminium at a rate of 0.3 to 3% by weight, calculated as AI2O3, and with an oxygen surplus of 2 to 15% in the gas phase during oxidation of the titanium tetrachloride into titanium dioxide in the CP process, and by doping with AI, Sb, Nb or Zn, for example, in the SP process.<br>
TiO2 particles produced by the chloride process are used with preference. The method is performed at a temperature of under 80 °C, preferably at 55 °C to 65 °C. The suspension in Step a) can be set to be either alkaline or acidic, with a pH value of preferably &gt; 9 or 
In Step b), an aluminium and a phosphorus component are added. Suitable aluminium components for the surface treatment method according to the invention are alkaline or acid-reacting, water-soluble salts, e.g. sodium aluminate, aluminium sulphate, aluminium nitrate, aluminium chloride, aluminium acetate, etc. This selection is not to be interpreted as a restriction. The aluminium component is to be added in a quantity of 1.0 to 5.0% by weight, preferably 1.5 to 4.5% by weight, particularly 2.0% by weight, calculated as AI2O3 and referred to the T1O2 particle.<br>
Suitable phosphorus components are inorganic compounds, such as alkali phosphates, ammonium phosphate, polyphosphates, phosphoric acid, etc. This selection is not to be interpreted as a restriction. Particularly suitable are disodium hydrogenphosphate or phosphoric acid. The phosphorus component is. added in a concentration of 1.0 to 5.0% by weight, preferably 1.5 to 4.0% by weight, particularly 2.0 to 3.0% by weight, calculated as P2O5 and referred to the T1O2 particle. The Al and the P component can be added to the suspension in any order, individually one after the other, or simultaneously.<br>
-6-<br><br>
A subsequent Step c) involves the addition of organic or inorganic hollow bodies with a mean diameter of 5 to 1,000 nm, preferably of 400 to 600 nm. The product Ropaque™ from Rohm &amp; Haas, for example, is open to consideration for use as organic hollow spheres. Ropaque™ consists of styrene/acrylic copolymer beads. Other latex or polymer hollow spheres are also suitable. However, this list is not to be interpreted as a restriction of the invention. Rather, all organic hollow spheres that display the required particle diameter in the range from 5 to 1,000 nm and are stable at the pH values occurring are in principle open to consideration. The inorganic hollow spheres described in the prior art include both glass hollow spheres and ceramic hollow spheres in general, and also TiO2 hollow spheres in particular. It is again the case here that all kinds of inorganic hollow bodies can in principle be used in the framework of the invention, provided that they display the required mean particle diameter of 5 to 1,000 nm and provided that they are stable at the pH values occurring. The person skilled in the art will select the appropriate hollow bodies on the basis of framework conditions, such as processibility, cost, etc. The hollow bodies are added in a quantity of 1 to 15% by weight, referred to the uncoated TiCh particles.<br>
In a further subsequent Step d), the pH value of the suspension is set to a value in the range from 4 to 9 by adding a pH-regulating component. The pH-regulating component used can be an acid or a lye. Examples of the acid that can be used are sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid or another suitable acid. Moreover, a corresponding acid-reacting salt, such as aluminium sulphate, can also be used in place of the acid. It is furthermore possible to use an acidic metal salt solution, e.g. of cerium, titanium or zirconium, such that precipitation takes place jointly with the aluminium oxide phosphate/hollow sphere layer. Sodium hydroxide solution is preferably used as the lye. Alkaline-reacting salts are also suitable. The person skilled in the art is familiar with suitable pH-regulating compounds. The selection is thus not to be interpreted as a restriction of the invention.<br>
-7-<br><br>
It has proven advantageous to apply, in a subsequent Step e), a layer of aluminium oxide to the aluminium oxide phosphate/hollow sphere layer in such a way that the pH value is maintained in the range from 4 to 9 e.g. by parallel addition of an alkaline and an acidic aluminium component (e.g. sodium aluminate / aluminium sulphate), or by addition of an alkaline aluminium component, such as sodium aluminate, and an acid, e.g. sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid, or by addition of an acidic aluminium component, such as aluminium sulphate, together with a lye, e.g. NaOH. In this context, either the components can be added in such a way that the pH value remains constant at a value in the range from 4 to 9, or the components can be added in such a combination that the pH value varies within the pH value range from 4 to 9 during addition. The person skilled in the art is familiar with these procedures. Suitable for setting the pH value are, for example, lyes or acids (e.g. NaOH / H2SO4), or alkaline or acid-reacting salt solutions (e.g. sodium aluminate / aluminium sulphate). It has proven particularly advantageous to perform treatment at the pH value previously set in Step d).<br>
As and when required, the pH value is subsequently set to between 5 and 8 in a Step f), e.g. using lyes / acids (e.g. NaOH / H2SO4 or HCl) or using alkaline / acidic salt solutions, such as sodium aluminate / aluminium sulphate.<br>
The quantity of the aluminium compounds used in Steps d), e) and f), calculated as AI2O3, is to be added to the quantity of AI2O3 already used in Step b). The sum total of the aluminium compounds used in Steps b) to f), calculated as AI2O3 and referred to the uncoated TiO2 particle, is ideally 1.0 to 9.0% by weight, preferably 3.5 to 7.5% by weight, particularly 5.5% by weight. Similarly, the quantity of the phosphorus component possibly used in Steps d) and e), calculated as P2O5, is to be added to the quantity of F2O5 used in Step b). The sum total of the phosphorus compounds used in Steps b) to e), calculated as P2O5, is thus ideally 1.0 to 5.0% by weight, preferably 1.5 to 3.5% by weight, and particularly 2.0 to 3.0% by weight, calculated as P2O5 and referred to the uncoated TiO2 particle.<br>
-8-<br><br>
Together with the Al and the P component other metal salt solutions, e.g. of Ce, Ti, Si, Zr or Zn, can be added to the suspension in Step b), subsequently being precipitated jointly onto the particle surface in Step d) as a phosphate or oxide in the aluminium oxide phosphate/ hollow sphere layer.<br>
It is furthermore possible, either before Step e) or after Step e), to apply a further<br>
inorganic layer as known from the prior art (e.g. compounds containing Zn, Ti, Si).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the starting<br>
point is an alkaline Ti02 suspension. To this end, Step a) first involves setting the<br>
suspension to a pH value of at least 10 using suitable alkaline compounds, e.g.<br>
NaOH. If wet-milling is performed, this should ideally be done before the milling<br>
operation.<br>
In Step b), an aluminium and a phosphorus component are then added to the<br>
suspension, each in the form of an aqueous solution. During addition of the<br>
components, the pH of the suspension is maintained at a value of at least 10,<br>
preferably at least 10.5, and particularly preferably at least 11.<br>
Sodium aluminate is particularly suitable as the alkaline aluminium component. If<br>
an acid-reacting compound is used, such as aluminium sulphate, the addition of<br>
which would reduce the pH value to below 10, it has proven advantageous to<br>
compensate for this effect by adding a suitable alkaline compound, such as NaOH.<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar with suitable alkaline compounds and the<br>
quantities required for maintaining the pH at a value of at least 10.<br>
In the case of phosphorus components whose addition would reduce the pH value<br>
to below 10, it has likewise proven advantageous to compensate for this effect by<br>
adding a suitable alkaline compound, such as NaOH. The person skilled in the art is<br>
familiar   with   suitable   alkaline   compounds   and   the   quantities   required   for<br>
maintaining the pH at a value of at least 10.<br>
The Al and the P component can be added to the suspension in any order,<br>
individually one after the other, or simultaneously.<br>
In the subsequent Step c), the organic or inorganic hollow bodies with a mean<br>
diameter of 5 to 1,000 run, preferably 400 to 600 nm, are added, in which context the<br>
-9-<br><br>
pH value of the suspension does not drop below 10, preferably not below 10.5, particularly not below 11.<br>
In the subsequent Step d), the pH-regulating component is added, such that a pH value in the range from 4 to 9 is obtained.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the method according to the invention, the surface<br>
treatment according to the invention is started in the acidic pH range.<br>
In this case, Step b) involves the addition of such aluminium and phosphorus<br>
components that the pH value of the suspension is subsequently below 4. The<br>
person skilled in the art is at liberty to already reduce the pH value in Step a) by<br>
means of a suitable acid, or to reduce the pH value to below 4 in Step b) using a<br>
suitable combination of the components, adding an acid where appropriate. For<br>
example,  the  combination phosphoric  acid /   sodium  aluminate  or  disodium<br>
hydrogenphosphate / aluminium sulphate is suitable. The components can be<br>
added  to  the  suspension  in any  order,  individually  one  after  the  other,  or<br>
simultaneously.<br>
In Step c), only hollow bodies are used that are stable at an acidic pH value.<br>
In Step d), a pH-regulating component is again added, as a result of which a pH<br>
value in the range from 4 to 9 is obtained.<br>
The surface-treated TiO2 pigment is separated from the suspension by filtration methods known to the person skilled in the art, and the resultant filter cake is washed in order to remove the soluble salts. To improve the light-fastness of the pigment in the laminate, a nitrate-containing compound, e.g. KNO3, NaNO&gt;3, A1(NO3)3, can be added to the washed filter paste in a quantity of 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, calculated as NO3, before or during subsequent drying. During subsequent milling, e.g. in a steam mill, an organic compound can be added to the pigment, taken from the range customarily used in the manufacture of TiO2 pigments and familiar to the person skilled in the art, such as polyalcohols (trimethylolpropane). As an alternative to addition of the nitrate-containing compounds before or during drying, such substances can also be added during milling.<br>
-10-<br><br>
Compared to the reference pigment, the pigment manufactured according to this method displays improved opacity and is optimally suited to use in decorative laminating paper or decorative coating materials, respectively.<br>
The surface treatment method according to the invention is customarily performed in batch mode. It is, however, also possible to perform treatment continuously, in which case suitable mixing equipment, such as is familiar to the person skilled in the art, must guarantee sufficiently thorough mixing.<br>
Examples<br>
An example of the invention is described below, yet the example is not intented to restrict the scope of the invention.<br>
Example:<br>
A sand-milled TiO2 suspension from the chloride process with a TiO2 concentration of 350 g/1 was set to a pH value of 10 with NaOH at 60 °C. While stirring, 2.0% by weight AI2O3 were added to the suspension in the form of sodium aluminate solution. After stirring for 15 minutes, 2.4% by weight P2O5 were added in the form of disodium hydrogenphosphate solution. This was followed by stirring for a further 15 minutes. Next, 30% Ropaque Ultra Emulsion (polymer hollow beads, Rohm &amp; Haas), corresponding to a styrene/acrylic copolymer active substance content of 2% by weight referred to TiC2, was added and stirred for a further 15 minutes. In the next step, the suspension was set to a pH value of 5 by adding aluminium sulphate solution corresponding to 2.6% by weight AI2O3. Subsequently, 0.7% by weight AI2O3 was added in the form of parallel addition of sodium aluminate and aluminium sulphate solution, such that the pH value was maintained at 5. After stirring for 30 minutes, the suspension was set to a pH value of approx. 5.8 with the help of an alkaline sodium aluminate solution, filtered and freed of the water-soluble salts by washing. The washed filter paste was dried in a spray drier, adding 0.25% by weight NO3 in the form of NaNOs, and subsequently steam-milled.<br>

Reference example:<br>
A sand-milled TiO2 suspension from the chloride process with a Ti02 concentration of 350 g/1 was set to a pH value of 10 with NaOH at 60 °C While stirring, 2.0% by weight AI2O3 were added to the suspension in the form of sodium aluminate solution. After stirring for 15 minutes, 2.4% by weight P2O5 were added in the form of disodium hydrogenphosphate solution. Stirring for a further 15 minutes then followed. In the next step, the suspension was set to a pH value of 5 by adding aluminium sulphate solution, corresponding to 2.6% by weight AI2O3. Subsequently, 0.8% by weight AI2O3 was added in the form of parallel addition of sodium aluminate and aluminium sulphate solution, such that the pH value was maintained at 5.<br>
After stirring for 30 minutes, the suspension was set to a pH value of approx. 5.8 with the help of an alkaline sodium aluminate solution, filtered and freed of the water-soluble salts by washing. The washed filter paste was dried in a spray drier, adding 0.25% by weight NO3 in the form of NaNCb, and subsequently steam-milled.<br>
Test Methods and Test Results<br>
Test Methods<br>
For assessing the optical properties of the decorative laminating papers, and thus the quality of the titanium dioxide pigment, it is important to compare decorative laminating papers with an identical ash content. Sheets of decorative laminating paper with a sheet weight of roughly 80.g/m2 and an ash content of roughly 30 g/m2 were produced. The person skilled in the art is familiar with the procedure and the auxiliaries used.<br>
The titanium dioxide content (ash) of a sheet and the pigment retention were subsequently determined.<br>
-12-<br><br>
Ash content<br>
The titanium dioxide content was determined by incinerating a defined weight<br>
of the produced paper in a rapid incinerator at 900 °C. The TiO2 content by<br>
mass (ash)  in  %  by weight was obtained by weighing the residue. The<br>
following formula was used as the basis for calculating the ash content:<br>
Ash content [g/m2] = (Ash [% by weight] x Grammage [g/m2]) / 100 [%].<br>
Retention<br>
The retention is defined as the capacity to retain all inorganic substances in the<br>
sheet of paper on the wire of the paper machine. The "one-pass retention"<br>
determined here indicates the percentage retained during a single pass through<br>
the paper machine. The ash content in percent, referred to the content by mass<br>
of the pigment used relative to the total solids in the suspension, yields the<br>
retention:<br>
Retention [%] = Ash [%] x (Pigment weight []l + Pulp weight [g])<br>
Pigment weight [g]<br>
Optical properties<br>
The optical properties of the pigments were determined in laminates.<br>
To this end, the decorative laminating paper was impregnated with a modified<br>
melamine impregnating resin and pressed into laminates. The sheet to be<br>
impregnated with resin was completely immersed in the melamine resin<br>
solution, subsequently drawn between two doctor blades to ensure application<br>
of a specific amount of resin and then immediately pre-condensed at 130 °C in<br>
a recirculating-air drying oven. The amount of resin applied was 120 to 140% of<br>
the weight of the sheet. The sheet had a residual moisture content of approx.<br>
6% by weight. The condensed sheets were combined into books with phenolic<br>
resin-impregnated core papers and white/black underlay paper.<br>
The laminate structure used for assessing the test pigments comprised 11<br>
layers: decorative laminating paper, white/black underlay, core paper, core<br>
paper,  core  paper,  white  underlay,  core  paper,  core  paper,  core  paper,<br>
white/black underlay, decorative laminating paper.<br>
-13-<br><br>
The books were pressed for 300 seconds with the help of a Wickert Type 2742 laminating press at a temperature of 140 °C and a pressure of 900 N/cm2. The optical properties of the laminates were measured using a commercially available spectrophotometer.<br>
In order to assess the optical properties of the laminates, the optical values of the decorative laminating papers (CIELAB L*, a*, b*) to DIN 6174 were determined with the help of the ELREPHO® 3000 colorimeter over white and black underlay. The opacity is a measure of the light transmission of the paper. The following parameters were selected as a measure of the opacity of the laminates: CIELAB L*biack/ the brightness of the laminates measured over black underlay paper, and the opacity value L [%] = Ybiack/Ywhite x 100, determined from the Y-value of the decorative laminating papers measured over black underlay paper (Ybiack) and the Y-value measured over white underlay paper<br>
(Y white).<br>
Test Results<br>
The Table shows the test results for laminates produced using the pigment according to the invention (Example) and a reference pigment (Reference example). Compared to the reference pigment, the pigment according to the invention demonstrates improved opacity.<br>
