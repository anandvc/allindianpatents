N-SULFONYLDICARBOXIMIDE CONTAINING TETHERING COMPOUNDS<br>
Related Applications<br>
The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application 10/714053, filed November 14,2003.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention provides compounds that include both a substrate-reactive group and a N-sulfonyldicarboximide group. The invention also provides articles and methods for immobilizing amine-containing materials to a substrate.<br>
Background<br>
Amine-containing materials such as amine-containing analytes, amino acids, peptides, DNA fragments, RNA fragments, protein fragments, organelles, and immunoglobins immobilized on the surface of a substrate can be used in numerous applications.  For example, immobilized biological amines can be used for the medical diagnosis of a disease or genetic defect, for biological separations, or for detection of various biomolecules.<br>
The attachment of amine-containing materials to a substrate is often achieved through the use of a tethering compound. A tethering compound usually has two reactive functional groups separated by a linking group. One of the functional groups provides a means for anchoring the tethering compound to a substrate by reacting with a complementary functional group on the surface of the substrate. A second reactive functional group can be selected to react with an amine-containing material. The second reactive functional group can be, for example, an activated acyl derivative, such as an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, or a cyclic azlactone. An amine-containing material can react with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester to form a carboxamide resulting in the displacement of an N-hydroxysuccinimide fragment. An amine-containing material can react with the cyclic azlactone resulting in the opening of the ring structure.<br><br>
Although tethering compounds that include a group such as an N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide ester or a cyclic azlactone can be highly reactive with primary amine-containing materials, such tethering compounds can suffer from a number of disadvantages. Many of the reactions with biological amines are conducted in dilute aqueous solutions. Under these conditions, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester functional group is known to undergo rapid hydrolysis. This competing reaction can cause incomplete or inefficient immobilization of the amine-containing materials on the substrate. While cyclic azlactone functional groups are more stable to hydrolysis, cyclic azlactone groups tend to be synthetically incompatible with many groups that could be used to attach the tethering compound to a substrate.<br>
Summary<br>
Compounds are provided that can function as tethering compounds for immobilizing an amine-containing material to a substrate. More specifically, the compounds include two types of reactive functional groups. The first type of reactive functional group is a substrate-reactive group capable of reacting with a complementary functional group on a surface of the substrate resulting in the attachment of a tethering group to the substrate. The second type of reactive functional group is a N-sulfonyldicarboximide derivative that can react with an amine-containing material by a ring opening reaction. A connector group is formed between the amine-containing material and the substrate. Articles and methods for immobilizing amine-containing materials to a substrate are also provided.<br>

The tethering group is the reaction product of the substrate-reactive group X1 in compounds of Formula I (e.g., the H2C=CR8-group of Formula la) or X2 in compound of Formula II (e.g., the H2C=CR8- group in Formula Ha) with a complementary functional group on the surface of the substrate to form an ionic bond, covalent bond, or combinations thereof. The substrate-attached tethering group has an N-sulfonyldicarboximide group capable of reacting with an amine-<br><br>
containing material. In another embodiment, the articles include an amine-containing material immobilized to a substrate through a connector group.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention provides a method of immobilizing an amine-containing material to a substrate. The method involves preparing a substrate-attached tethering group by reacting the substrate-reactive group X1 in compounds of Formula I (e.g., the H2C=CR8- group of Formula la) or X2 in compound of Formula II (e.g., the H2C=CRS- group in Formula Ha) with a complementary functional group on a surface of a substrate; and reacting a N-sulfonyldicarboximide group of the substrate-attached tethering group with an amine-containing material to form a connector group between the amine-containing material and the substrate.<br>

Articles<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides articles that include a tethering group attached to a substrate (i.e., substrate-attached tethering group). The substrate-attached tethering group is the reaction product of the group X1 in compounds of Formula I or the group X2 in the compounds of Formula II with a complementary functional group G on a surface of a substrate. The substrate-attached tethering group has a N-sulfonyldicarboximide group that can react with an amine-containing material to form a connector group between the substrate and the amine-containing material. The formation of the connector group results in the immobilization of the amine-containing material to<br><br>
the substrate.  In some articles, the compounds of Formula I are those of Formula la and the compounds of Formula II are those of Formula Ha.<br>
The substrate is a solid phase material to which the tethering groups can be attached. The substrate is not soluble in a solution used to react a compound of Formula I or Formula II with a complementary functional group on the surface of the substrate (i.e., the substrate is not soluble in a solution used to prepare the substrate-attached tethering group). Typically, a tethering group is attached only to an outer portion of the substrate and a bulk portion of the substrate is not modified during the process of attaching the tethering group to the substrate. If the substrate has groups G distributed throughout the substrate, only those groups in the outer portion (e.g., on or near the surface) are usually capable of reacting with group X1 in compounds of Formula I or with group X2 in compounds of Formula II.<br>
The substrates can have any useful fonn including, but not limited to, thin films, sheets, membranes, filters, nonwoven or woven fibers, hollow or solid beads, bottles, plates, tubes, rods, pipes, or wafers. The substrates can be porous or non-porous, rigid or flexible, transparent or opaque, clear or colored, and reflective or non-reflective. Suitable substrate materials include, for example, polymeric materials, glasses, silicons, ceramics, metals, metal oxides, hydrated metal oxides, or combinations thereof.<br>
The substrates can have a single layer or multiple layers of material. For example, the substrate can have one or more second layers that provide support for a first layer that includes a complementary functional group capable of reacting with the X1 group in compounds of Formula I or with the X group in compounds of Formula H. In some embodiments, a surface of a second layer is chemically modified or coated with another material to provide a first layer that has a complementary functional group capable of reacting with the X or the X group. The first layer is the outer layer of the substrate.<br>

In some embodiments, the substrate has a layer of diamond-like glass as disclosed in International Patent Application WO 01/66820 Al. The diamond-like glass is an amorphous material that includes carbon, silicon, and one or more elements selected from hydrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, titanium, or copper. Some diamond-like glass materials are formed from a tetramethylsilane precursor using a plasma process. A hydrophobic material can be produced that is further treated in an oxygen plasma to control the silanol concentration on the surface.<br>
Diamond-like glass can be in the form of a thin film or in the form of a coating on another layer or material in the substrate. In some applications, the diamond-like glass can be in the form of a thin film having at least 30 weight percent carbon, at least 25 weight percent silicon, and up to 45 weight percent oxygen. Such films can be flexible and transparent. In some embodiments, the diamond-like glass is the outer layer of a multilayer substrate. In a specific example, the second layer (e.g., support layer) of the substrate is a polymeric material and the first layer is a thin film of diamond-like glass. The tethering group is attached to the surface of the diamond-like glass.<br>
In some multilayer substrates, the diamond like glass is deposited on a layer of diamond-like carbon. For example, the second layer (e.g., support layer) is a polymeric film having a layer of diamond-like carbon deposited on a surface. A layer of diamond-like glass is deposited over the diamond-like carbon layer. The diamond-like carbon can, in some embodiments, function as a tie layer or primer layer between a polymeric layer and a layer of diamond-like glass in a multilayer substrate. For example, the multilayer substrate can include a polyimide or polyester layer, a layer of diamond-like carbon deposited on the polyimide or polyester, and a layer of diamond-like glass deposited on<br><br>
the diamond-like carbon. In another example, the multilayer substrate includes a stack of the layers arranged in the following order: diamond-like glass, diamond-like carbon, polyimide or polyester, diamond-like carbon, and diamond-like glass.<br>

Uses<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used, for example, for immobilizing amine-containing material. In some embodiments, the amine-containing material is an amine analyte. In other embodiments, the amine-containing material is a biomolecules such as, for example, an amino acid, peptide, DNA, RNA, protein, enzyme, organelle, immunoglobin, or fragments thereof. Immobilized biological amine-containing materials can be useful in the medical diagnosis of a disease or of a genetic defect. The immobilized amine-containing materials can also be used for biological separations or for detection of the presence of various biomolecules. Additionally, the immobilized amine-containing materials can be used in bioreactors or as biocatalysts to prepare other materials. The substrate-attached tethering groups can be used to detect amine-containing analytes.<br>
Biological amine-containing materials often can remain active after attachment to the substrate (i.e., the articles according to Formula V or VI can include biologically active amine-containing materials immobilized to the substrate). For example, an immobilized antibody can bind with an antigen or an immobilized antigen can bind with an antibody. An amine-containing material can bind to a bacterium. In a more specific example, the immobilized amine-containing material can bind to a Staphylococcus aureus bacterium (e.g,, the immobilized amine-containing material can be a biomolecule that has a portion that can specifically bind to the bacterium).<br>
The articles prepared by attaching the compounds of the invention to a substrate typically have improved hydrolytic stability compared to previously known articles prepared using a tethering compound that is a derivative of N-hydroxysuccinimide. Because of the hydrolytic stability, the compounds and the substrate-attached tethering groups of the invention can typically be used in aqueous systems.<br><br>
When an amine-containing material reacts with a N-sulfonyldicarboximide group, a connector group is formed that results in the immobilization of the amine-containing material to the substrate (i.e., substrate immobilized amine-containing materials according to Formulas V or VI). The rate of reaction of amine-containing materials with the N-sulfonyldicarboximide groups of the substrate-attached tethering groups is typically faster than the rate of hydrolysis of the N-sulfonyldicarboximide group. That is, immobilization of amine-containing materials occurs at a faster rate than the hydrolysis reactions. The amine-containing materials are not easily displaced once immobilization to a substrate has occurred due to the formation of a covalent carbonylimino bond.<br>
