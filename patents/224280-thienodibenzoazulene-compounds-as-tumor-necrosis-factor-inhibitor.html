Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a method for the production of elastic and stretchable bands from an insert cloth web having at least partially synthetic fibres or filaments, in particular from a nonwoven web, for use in the clothing industry.<br>
The clothing industry requires for many different purposes, for example as inserts in suits, jackets, blouses and the like, bands which, connected to the clothing cloth, give the latter high stability and at the same time elasticity. In this context, the bands are intended to give the cloth increased strength in a predetermined direction. Shaping is also to be maintained or stabilized. The use of bands, which, for example, have high stability in the longitudinal direction, but reduced strength in the transverse direction, is not desirable in many cases. As regards bands cut from insert cloth webs, however, these strengths arise due to the fact that the insert cloth web often has higher strength in its longitudinal direction than in transverse or intermediate directions, whether in the weaving process or else during the production of nonwoven webs.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is, therefore, to provide a method by means of which bands can be produced which have high strength, but at the same time have as far as possible equal flexibility and<br><br>
strength in a predetermined direction of the insert cloth web.<br>
In a method of the generic type mentioned in the introduction, the set object is achieved, according to the invention, in that one or more industrially-produced insert cloth webs is or are folded together and connected to one another at their open edges and a tube is formed, and in that the wall of the tube is cut open obliquely, so as to give rise to a novel insert cloth web which is more elastic in the longitudinal direction and transverse direction and is equipped with equal strengths and which is then cut in the longitudinal direction into bands. As a result of this procedure, in the case of a woven fabric, the directions of the warp and weft threads are changed and, in the case of a nonwoven web, the main direction of the fibres or filaments is changed. The original orientation of the warp threads in the longitudinal direction of the insert cloth web or of the fibres and filaments in the case of a nonwoven web is changed and in the novel insert cloth web lies obliquely to its longitudinal direction. In the bands then cut from the insert cloth web, the warp and weft threads or the fibres and filaments in the case of a nonwoven consequently likewise lie obliquely to the longitudinal direction of the bands.<br>
To produce the novel insert cloth web from which the bands are cut, two insert cloth webs of equal width can be laid one above the other and be connected to one another at their open edges. This procedure is very simple in mechanical terms. It is also possible, however, to take only one nonwoven web which is folded together in half in the longitudinal direction and<br><br>
which is likewise interconnected at its open edges, so that a tube is obtained. Whereas, in the first-mentioned possibility, the open edges are connected on both sides of the insert cloth webs and consequently two devices have to be used for this purpose, in the second-mentioned possibility only one device is required for connecting the open edges.<br>
Various possibilities for connecting the open edges may be envisaged. However, the connection of the edges by the ultrasonic or laser-beam technique is particularly preferred. This affords several advantages as compared with mechanical seam connection by stitching. Thus, a connecting seam is formed which has high strength. Comparative tearing tests yielded the result that a seam connection produced by the ultrasonic method has higher strength than the adjacent cloth web, that is to say, in tensile tests, the cloth web tears, not the seam. This is contrary to a stitched seam, in which case the seam tears in the tensile test, whereas the cloth web holds. This is also evident from the fact that, when the tube is cut, the thread of the connecting seam is cut through. Another advantage is that the seam is virtually invisible or can be made virtually invisible. So that the seam appears as little as possible, it is expedient if the seam addition of the cloth web or cloth webs which projects beyond the connecting line of the edges is cut off. Where a stitched connection is concerned, this can take place only to a limited extent. The stitched margin therefore appears in the finished band. In many instances, this seam may have an adverse effect during the further processing of the band, and it is necessary for the seam points to have to be cut off from the band, thus resulting in a large amount of waste cuttings.  By<br><br>
contrast, as regards a connection by the ultrasonic or laser-beam technique, the seam addition can be cut off completely or to a minimum amount, up to the ultrasonically produced connecting seam, and the connection point is virtually invisible on the novel spread-out insert cloth web. Considerable web material can be saved both during the production of the tube and during subsequent processing. It is no longer necessary for the seam pieces to be cut out from the finished band. The cutting angle at which the tube is cut open and which lies between a transverse line relative to the cloth web and to the cutting line is predetermined by the field of use of the bands. It is beneficial to<br>
set it at 8, 12 or 38°. The larger the cutting angle, the greater is the elasticity of the novel insert cloth web in the case of nonwoven webs and consequently of the bands produced from it.<br>
The bands thus produced are employed, during their final processing, at the most varied possible points on articles of clothing. It may be necessary, because of this, that they additionally have to be ready-made. This may be carried out, for example, by the cut bands being provided with a seam by two-thread lock stitch, chain stitch or blind stitch. It is also possible, and is often practised, that a plurality of the cut bands are connected to one another by two-thread lock stitch, chain stitch or blind stitch.<br>
The method according to the invention is particularly suitable for the production of bands which are cut from a nonwoven web. Nonwoven webs, the fibres, and/or filaments of which are oriented predominantly in the longitudinal direction of the nonwoven web, are preferably used here. By a tube being formed from such<br><br>
nonwoven webs and being cut open and by the novel nonwoven web being produced, an oblique orientation of the main fibre direction is achieved, which leads to the desired properties in the bands cut from the novel nonwoven web.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method for the production of elastic and stretchable bands from an insert cloth web consisting of a nonwoven web, for use in the clothing industry, characterized in that one or more industrially produced webs is or are folded together and connected to one another at their open edges and a tube is formed, and in that the wall of the tube is cut open obliquely, so as to give rise to a novel insert cloth web which is more elastic in the longitudinal direction and transverse direction and which is cut in the longitudinal direction into bands.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail with reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawing in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically the method sequence. Fig. 2 shows diagrammatically, and roughly, the<br>
production of a tube from two cloth webs in section, Fig. 3 shows a top view of the cloth webs according to Figure 2, Fig. 4 shows diagrammatically the formation of a tube from one cloth web, Fig. 5 shows a tube with the cutting line indicated, and Fig. 6 shows the novel cloth web with incisions for the production of the bands.<br><br>
Implementation of the Invention<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the method diagrammatically for an exemplary embodiment in which two webs are used. Two original webs produced by means of industrial methods known per se are used. The two webs are folded together and their open edges are connected to one another ultrasonically and at the same time the seam additions present on both sides of the webs are cut off. A tube has thereby been formed, which is fed to a further cutting device and is cut open there obliquely. Cutting open obliquely gives rise to a novel cloth web in which<br><br>
the main tension direction no longer runs longitudinally along the cloth web, but obliquely to the longitudinal orientation of the web. The wound-up cloth web is cut into individual discs and treated further so as to be ready-made.<br>
The two cloth webs 1 and 2 are illustrated roughly in Figs 2 and 3. They lie one above the other and are connected to one another at their open edges 3 and 4 or 5 and 6 ultrasonically, and cut. The ultrasonic device is indicated by the arrows 7 and 8 and the stays 9 and 10 located under it are also indicated. After the edges 3, 4 or 5, 6 of the webs 1, 2 are connected to one another, a tube 11 is obtained.<br>
Figure 3 shows a top view of the seam additions 14, 15 of the cloth webs 1 and 2, which seam additions project at the edges 3, 4 or 5, 6 beyond the connecting lines 12, 13 occurring as a result of the welding operation of the ultrasonic technique and which are cut off simultaneously.<br>
Figure 4 shows the possibility whereby a nonwoven web 16 is folded together in half in the longitudinal direction 17 and the open edges 18, 19 are connected to one another. The connection operation takes place in the same way as in Figure 2 by means of the ultrasonic device 7 and 9. Here, too, the seam addition is detached and a tube 11 is formed.<br>
Figure 5 shows the tube 11 with the cutting line 20 through the wall 21. The cutting angle w of the cloth web 16 is fixed at approximately 38°.<br><br>
The cutting operation gives rise to a novel cloth web 22 in which the main direction of the warp threads or the fibres or filaments of the nonwoven web in this case runs obliquely, not in the longitudinal direction of the web. This direction is indicated by the double arrow 23 depicted by broken lines in Fig. 5.<br>
Figure 6 shows the start of the cutting lines 24 for the bands 2 5 which are cut out of the novel insert cloth web 22. The bands 2 5 may undergo further ready-making steps, such as belong to the prior art. For example, they may be connected to one another or to other materials by two-thread lock stitch, chain stitch or blind stitch. Their longitudinal direction is identical to the longitudinal direction 26 of the novel more elastic cloth web 22.<br><br><br>
