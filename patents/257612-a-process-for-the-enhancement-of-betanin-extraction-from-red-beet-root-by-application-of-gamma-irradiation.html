				<td>The present invention relates to the process for the extraction of betanin from red beetroot using gamma-irradiation.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to enhancement of betanin extraction from red beetroot by application of gamma-irradiation in the range 2.5 kGy to 10.0 kGy.<br>
Recent problems with the safety of artificial dyes have stimulated research on alternate natural pigments. The synthetic food colors or dyes, generally, used in many food formulations may lead to toxic residues and hence may not be appropriate for use in food processing. The apparent lack of toxicity and eco-friendliness of natural colorants have increased the interest of researchers in the area of plant pigments and pigments of microbial origin. The use of natural food colors is limited in food industry due to lower stability and higher cost. There has been considerable interest in the red colorants from plant sources like red beet, red grape, cranberry and other sources as a substitute for the red synthetic dyes. Betalain, natural food colorant is associated with the antioxidant, antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Chemically the betalains are defined as the derivatives of betalamic acids. Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) is one of the richest source of Betanin and used for imparting a desirable red color to food. Betanin have large applications in food formulations such as gelatins, desserts, confectioneries, baked foods, dry mixes, beverages, poultry, dairy and meat products. Betanin can also be blended with other colorants to provide desired color matches. <br>
They are most suitable for foods, which are subjected to minimum heat treatment, having short shelf life, packed and marketed in a dry state under reduced levels of light, oxygen and humidity. The stability of Betanin is strongly dependent on light, oxygen, water activity, pH and temperature.<br>
Gamma-irradiation pretreatment, changes or alters the interior tissue structure, thereby increasing the permeability of plant cells which results in improved mass transfer during air drying and osmotic dehydration. Similarly, due to increase in cell permeability, the application of gamma-irradiation is expected to increase the extraction efficiency of solid liquid extraction process. This forms the motivation for the present process invention. Gamma irradiation is used to inhibit the sprouting of vegetables, extend shelf-life of fresh produce, control pathogenic organisms and insect and microbial disinfestations, and sterilize foods. After many experiments, Food and Agriculture Organization/lntl. Atomic Energy Agency/World Health Organization announced that dosages of irradiation not more than 10 kGy on average would not result in problems of toxicity and nutrition loss, while ensuring microbial safety of food. On the basis of the extensive scientific evidence, the same joint committee in 1997 concluded that food irradiated to any dose appropriate to achieve the intended technological objective is both safe to consume and nutritionally adequate.<br>
Reference can be made work reported by Chalermchat et al (2004, Journal of Food Engineering, 64, 229-236) and Fincan et al (2004, Journal of<br><br>
Food Engineering, 64, 381-388) wherein it was reported that pretreatment with high intensity pulsed electric field increased the extraction efficiency of the beetroot. In these present studies gamma irradiation was not explored to increase the extraction.<br>
Reference can be made to the work reported by Doemenburg and Knorr (1993, Food Biotechnology, 7, 35-48) wherein it is reported that the application of high pressure and high intensity pulsed electric field resulted in increased extraction of secondary mebtabolites from the Chenopodium rubrum and Morinda citrifolia. In this study application of gamma irradiation on beetroot was not studied.<br>
Reference can be made to W099/64634 wherein, increased extraction of soluble solids form the sugar beetroot was reported due to pretreatment with high intensity pulsed electric field. In this study gamma irradiation was not employed.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the enhanced extraction of betanin from red beetroot using gamma irradiation.<br>
In another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the enhanced extraction of betanin from red beetroot using gamma irradiation in the range from 2.5 to 10.0 kGy.<br><br>
Accordingly, a process for the extraction of betanin from red beetroot using gamma irradiation, which comprises:<br>
a   irradiating the red beetroot from 2.5 to 10.0 kGy using 60Co<br>
gamma chamber with the power source of 12 kCi  ( Dose rate<br>
7.65 kGy/h), b   slicing of beetroot to 2 mm manually with the help of a sharp<br>
knife and then   these were cut into circular pieces of 25 mm<br>
with a help of circular die. c   washing of beetroot slices with deionised water d   preparing extraction solutions consisting of 0.5 to 1.0% of acetic<br>
acid of pH 3-5 and conductivity of 600 to 800 µS (micro<br>
Siemens), e   extracting betanin by immersing beetroot slices in the extraction<br>
solutions for 1.0 to 2.0 hours at room temperature, which was<br>
25±1°C , which was agitated at a speed of 200 to 500 rpm. The<br>
concentration of betanin was measured by spectrophotometric<br>
method at the regular intervals of 5 minutes.<br>
The present invention leads to the development of process for the extraction of betanin from red beetroot using gamma irradiation. The following steps are involved in the process.<br><br>
1.	Gamma irradiation: The red beetroot was irradiated from 2.5 to 10.0 kGy using 60Co gamma chamber with the power source of 12 kCi.<br>
2.	Slicing: Beetroot was sliced to 2mm and then cut into circular pieces of 25 mm with a help of circular discs.<br>
3.	Washing: Beetroot slices was washed with deionised water<br>
4.	Preparation of extraction solution: Extraction solutions was prepared consisting of 0.5 to 1.0% of acetic acid of pH 3-5, which indicated the conductivity of 600 to 800µs.<br>
5.	Extraction of betanin: Beetroot slices were subjected to extraction<br>
solutions for 1.0 to 2.0 hours at room temperature (25± 1°C), which<br>
was agitated at a speed of 200 to 500 rpm. The concentration of<br>
betanin was measured by spectrophotometric method at the regular<br>
intervals of 5 minutes.<br>
During the extraction of betanin in an extraction solution it is necessary to maintain the pH in the range of 3 to 5 because betanin is highly sensitive to pH.<br>

*Average of five determinations<br><br>
Novelty:<br>
The application of gamma irradiation is a unique way of enhancement extraction of betanin from red beetroot. The other novel features of the present invention are given below.<br>
a.	Application   of   gamma   irradiation   resulted   in   increase   cell<br>
permeability, which resulted in enhanced extraction.<br>
b.	The efficiency of extraction was achieved at ambient temperature<br>
of extraction solution.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and not to be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
One hundred grams of red beetroot was irradiated at 2.5 kGy and then it was cut into circular pieces of diameter 25 mm and height of 2 mm. After washing the slices with deionised water, these were subjected to extraction solution consisting of 1% acetic acid (pH 3.0) at room temperature (25±1°C). The ratio of the weight of the piece to that of solution was agitated at 250 rpm<br><br>
for 2 h. The concentration of Betanin content was estimated using spectrophotometer and the results have been reported in the Table 1, which indicates that extraction efficiency could be increased by 10.0% as compared with unirradiated sample.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 One hundred grams of red beetroot was irradiated at 10.0 kGy and then it was cut into circular pieces of diameter 25 mm and height of 2 mm. After washing the slices with deionised water, these were subjected to extraction solution consisting of 1% acetic acid (pH 3.0) at room temperature (25+1 °C). The ratio of the weight of the piece to that of solution was agitated at 250 rpm for 2 h. The concentration of Betanin content was estimated using spectrophotometer and the results have been reported in the Table 1, which indicates that extraction efficiency could be increased by 43.0% as compared with unirradiated sample.<br><br>
The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
1)	Higher concentration of betalains can be achieved<br>
2)	The efficiency of extraction was increased.<br>
3)	All the operations are carried out at ambient condition and hence the process is more economical.<br>
4)	The final product retains its spectral properties thereby rendering this product suitable for use in food applications.<br>
5)	The process is easy to scale up<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
