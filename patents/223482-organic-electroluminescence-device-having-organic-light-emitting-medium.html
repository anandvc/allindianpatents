DESCRIPTION<br>
ORGANIC    ELECTROLUMINESCENCE    DEVICE   AND    ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING MEDIUM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescence (electroluminescence will be referred to as EL, hereinafter) device and an organic light emitting medium and, more particularly, to an organic EL device which exhibits excellent heat resistance, has a long life time and provides efficient light emission and an organic light emitting medium which is advantageously used for the organic EL device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
EL devices which utilize EL show high self-distinguishability because of the self-emission and are excellent in impact resistance because they are completely solid devices. Therefore, EL devices have been attracting attention for application as light emitting devices in various types of display apparatus.<br>
The EL devices include inorganic EL devices in which an inorganic compound is used as the light emitting material and organic EL devices in which an organic compound is used as the light emitting material. Organic EL devices have been extensively studied for practical application as a light emitting device of the next generation because the applied voltage can be decreased to a great extent, the size of the device can be reduced easily,  consumption of electric power is small, planar light<br><br>
emission is possible and three primary colors are easily emitted.<br>
As for the construction of the organic EL device, the basic construction comprises an anode / an organic light emitting layer / a cathode. Constructions having a hole injecting and transporting layer or an electron injecting layer suitably added to the basic construction are known. Examples of such construction include the construction of an anode / a hole injecting and transporting layer / an organic light emitting layer / a cathode and the construction of an anode / a hole injecting and transporting layer / an organic light emitting layer / an electron injecting layer / a cathode.<br>
In practical application of organic EL devices, driving stability and storage stability in environments at high temperatures such as outdoors and in automobiles are required. When an EL device is used outdoors or for an instrument used in an automobile, in general, storage stability at a high temperature of 75°C is required. However, when a conventional organic EL device is stored at a high temperature of about 75°C, problems arise in that color of emitted light changes and the efficiency of light emission decreases. These problems inevitably restrict application of the organic EL devices.<br>
Various attempts have been made to obtain a device which exhibits excellent heat resistance, has a long life time, achieves a high efficiency and emits bluish light. However, it is the actual present situation that no devices having satisfactory properties are obtained.<br>
For example, a technology in which a single monoanthracene compound is used as the organic light emitting material has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei  ll(1999)-3782.<br><br>
However, in accordance with this technology, for example, the luminance obtained under a current density of 165 mA/cm2 is as small as 1650 cd/m2 and the efficiency is as small as 1 cd/A. Therefore, the technology is not practically useful. Another technology in which a single bisanthracene compound is used as the organic light emitting material has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 8(1996)-12600. However, in accordance with this technology, the efficiency is as small as 1 to 3 cd/A and further improvement is desired for practical use. An organic EL device having a long life time in which a distyryl compound is used as the organic light emitting material and styrylamine is additionally used has been disclosed in International Patent Application Laid-Open No. 94-6157. However, this device has a half-life time of about 1000 hours and further improvement is desired.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under the above circumstances, the present invention has an object of providing an organic EL device which exhibits excellent heat resistance, has a long life time and provides efficient light emission and an organic light emitting medium advantageously used for the organic EL device.<br>
As the result of extensive studies by the present inventors to achieve the above object, it was found that an organic EL device in which the organic light emitting medium comprises a combination of an electron transporting material and a specific anthracene derivative and a layer comprising the organic light emitting medium is disposed between a pair of electrodes exhibited excellent heat resistance, had a long life time and provided efficient blue light emission.

In the present invention, it is advantageous that the amounts of the electron transporting compound of component (A) and the anthracene derivative of component (B) used in the layer of an organic light emitting medium are suitably selected in accordance with the type of the used compounds in a manner such that the ratio of the amount by mass of component (A) to the amount by mass of component (B) is in the range of 1:99 to 99:1. It is preferable that the amounts are selected in a manner such that the ratio of the amount by mass of component (A) to the amount by mass of component (B) is in the range of 1:9 to 9:1 and more preferably in the range of 9:1 to 1:1.

It is preferable that the thickness of the layer of an organic light emitting medium is in the range of 5 to 200 nm and more preferably in the range of 10 to 40 nm since the voltage applied to the device can be decreased to a great degree.   By using the combination of component (A)<br><br>
and component (B) for the layer of an organic light emitting medium, the organic light emitting medium becomes more amorphous due to suppressed crystallization. Therefore, stability is enhanced and heat resistance is improved. As the compound of component (B), compounds having a glass transition temperature of 110°C or higher are preferable. By mixing the compound having a glass transition temperature of 110°C or higher, the glass transition temperature of the layer of an organic light emitting medium can be raised to 110°C or higher and a heat resistance of 500 hours or longer at 85°C can be obtained.<br>
The chromaticity and the peak wavelength in the spectrum of the emitted light can be controlled by adjusting the relative amounts of component (A) and component (B). By increasing the relative amount of component (A), the peak wavelength in the spectrum of the emitted light shifts to longer wavelengths and the x-coordinate of the chromaticity coordinates increases. This phenomenon takes place because the peak wavelength in the spectrum of emitted light due to component (A) is in the region of longer wave lengths.<br>
It is preferable that the fluorescent compound of component (C) is added since the heat resistance and the efficiency of light emission are further improved.<br>

The molecular deposit film is a thin film formed iy deposition of a material compound in the gas phase or a thin film ormed by solidification of a material compound in a solution or in the [quid phase. In general, the molecular deposit film can be distinguished com the thin film formed in accordance with the LB process (the molecular ccumulation film) based on the differences in the aggregation structure nd higher order structures and functional differences caused by these tructural differences.<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Showa 7(1982)-51781, the light emitting medium layer can also be formed by<br><br>

The hole injecting and transporting layer is a layer which helps injection of holes into the light emitting medium layer and transports the holes to the light emitting region. The layer exhibits a great mobility of holes and, in general, has an ionization energy as small as 5.5 eV or smaller. For the hole injecting and transporting layer, a material which transports holes to the light emitting medium layer at a smaller electric field strength is preferable. A material which exhibits, for example, a mobility of holes of at least 10-6 cmWsec under application of an electric field of 104 to 106 V/cm is more preferable. A material can be selected from materials which are conventionally used as the charge transporting material of holes in photoconductive materials and conventional materials which are used for the hole injecting layer in organic EL devices and used as the hole injecting and transporting material.<br>
To form the hole injecting and transporting layer, a thin film may be formed from a hole injecting and transporting material in accordance with a conventional process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the<br><br>
spin coating process, the casting process and the LB process. The thickness of the hole injecting and transporting layer is not particularly limited.    In general, the thickness is 5 nm to 5 \xm.<br>
The electron injection layer is a layer which helps injection of electrons into the light emitting medium layer and exhibits a great mobility of electrons. The adhesion improving layer is an electron injecting layer made of a material exhibiting excellent adhesion with the cathode.

Specific examples of the metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline and derivatives thereof include metal chelates of oxinoid compounds including chelates of oxine (in general, 8-quinolinol or 8-hydroxyquinoline). For example, tris(8-quinolinol)aluminum can be used as the electron injecting material.<br>
To prepare the organic EL device of the present invention, for example, the anode, the light emitting medium layer and, where necessary, the hole injecting layer and the electron injecting layer are formed in accordance with the above process using the above materials and the cathode is formed in the last step. The organic EL device may be prepared by forming the above layers in the order reverse to that described above, i.e., the cathode being formed in the first step and the anode in the last step.<br>
An embodiment of the process for preparing an organic EL device having a construction in which an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting medium layer, an electron injecting layer and a cathode are<br><br>
disposed successively on a substrate which transmits light will be described in the following.<br>
On a suitable substrate which transmits light, a thin film made of a material for the anode is formed in accordance with the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process so that the thickness of the formed thin film is 1 \xm or smaller and preferably in the range of 10 to 200 nm. The formed thin film is used as the anode. Then, a hole injecting layer is formed on the anode. The hole injecting layer can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process or the LB process, as described above. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable because a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. When the hole injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, in general, it is preferable that the conditions are suitably selected in the following ranges: the temperature of the source of the deposition: 50 to 450°C; the vacuum: 10_7 to 10_3 Torr; the rate of deposition: 0.01 to 50 nm/second; the temperature of the substrate: -50 to 300°C and the thickness of the film: 5 nm to 5 um; although the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition are different depending on the used compound (the material for the hole injecting layer) and the crystal structure and the recombination structure of the hole injecting layer to be formed.<br>
Then, the light emitting medium layer is formed on the hole injecting layer formed above. Using the light emitting medium described in the present invention, a thin film of the organic light emitting medium can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the<br><br>
sputtering process, the spin coating process or the casting process and the formed thin film is used as the light emitting medium layer. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable because a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. When the light emitting medium layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, in general, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process can be selected in the same ranges as those described for the vacuum vapor deposition of the hole injecting layer although the conditions are different depending on the used compound. It is preferable that the thickness is in the range of 10 to 40 nm.<br>
An electron injecting layer is formed on the light emitting medium layer formed above. Similarly to the hole injecting layer and the light emitting medium layer, it is preferable that the electron injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process since a uniform film must be obtained. The conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition can be selected in the same ranges as those described for the vacuum vapor deposition of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting medium layer.<br>
A cathode is formed on the above layers in the last step and an organic EL device can be obtained. The cathode is made of a metal and can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process or the sputtering process. It is preferable that the vacuum vapor deposition process is used in order to prevent formation of damages on the lower organic layers during the formation of the film.<br>
In the above preparation of the organic EL device, it is preferable that  the   above   layers   from  the   anode   to  the   cathode   are   formed<br><br>
successively while the preparation system is kept in a vacuum after being evacuated.<br>
The electroluminescence device which can be prepared as described above emits light by applying a direct voltage of 3 to 40 V in the condition that the anode is connected to a positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to a negative electrode (—). When the connection is reversed, no electric current is observed and no light is emitted at all. When an alternating voltage is applied to the electroluminescence device, light emission is observed only in the condition that the polarity of the anode is positive and the polarity of the cathode is negative. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, any type of wave shape can be used.<br>
The present invention also provides the organic light emitting medium comprising component (A), component (B) and component (C) used where necessary, which are described above. The organic light emitting medium can be advantageously used for the organic EL device which exhibits excellent heat resistance, has a long life time and provides efficient light emission.<br>
The present invention will be described more specifically with reference to examples in the following. However, the present invention is not limited to the examples.<br>
Example 1<br><br>
In accordance with conventional processes described in literatures, the following compounds DPVDPAN, TPD78, TPD106, PAVB, Rull, DC5 and Rub6P were synthesized and purified.<br><br><br><br><br>
On a glass plate having a size of 25X75X1.1 mm, a transparent electrode made of indium tin oxide and having a thickness of 120 nm was formed. After the glass substrate was cleaned by irradiation with ultraviolet light and exposure to ozone, the glass substrate was placed in a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus.<br>
In the first step, TPD106 was vapor deposited so that a layer having a thickness of 60 nm was formed and TPD78 was vapor deposited so that a layer having a thickness of 20 nm was formed on the layer of TPD106. Then, DPVDPAN, Alq and Rull were simultaneously vapor deposited on the formed layers in amounts such that the ratio of the amounts by weight of DPVDPAN, Alq and Rull was 20:20:2 and a layer of an organic light emitting medium having a thickness of 40 nm was formed. DPVDPAN was an anthracene derivative, Alq was an electron transporting compound and Rull was a condensed polycyclic aromatic compound.<br>
Alq (an aluminum complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline) was vapor deposited so that a layer having a thickness of 20 nm was formed on the layer formed above. TPD106, TPD78, DPVDPAN:Alq:Rull and Alq were the hole injecting layer, the hole transporting layer, the layer of an organic light emitting medium and the electron injecting layer, respectively.<br>
Then, LiF which was an alkali metal halide was vapor deposited so that a layer having a thickness of 0.3 nm was formed on the above layers and aluminum was vapor deposited so that a layer having a thickness of 100 nm was formed on the layer of LiF. The layers of LiF and Al worked as the cathode.   An organic EL device was prepared as described above.<br>
The device was tested by passing an electric current. Red light emission of 110 cd/m2 was obtained at a voltage of 6 V and a current<br><br>
density of 3.0 mA/cm2.   The chromaticity coordinates were (0.61, 0.38) and the efficiency was 3.7 cd/A.<br>
The device was tested by continuously passing direct current constantly at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2 and the half-life time was found to be as long as 2,600 hours.<br>
Examples 2 to 17<br>
Organic EL devices were prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 1 except that the layer of an organic light emitting medium was formed with compounds of component (A), compounds of component (B) and compounds of component (C) shown in Table 1 in amounts shown in Table 1. The properties of the obtained organic EL devices are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, Gaq represents tris (8 -quinolinol) gallium.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 18<br>
A device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 7 except that Alq:Cs/Al was used in place of LiF/Al. The layer of Alq:Cs was a layer of a mixture of Alq which was an electron transmitting compound and Cs metal which was a reducing dopant in amounts such that the ratio of the amounts by mole of Alq to Cs was 1:1. Yellow light emission of 203 cd/m2 was obtained at a voltage of 4.5 V and a current density of 1.73 mA/cm2. The efficiency was as high as 12.7 cd/A. When the device was driven under a constant current at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2, the half-life time was 3,500 hours.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
An organic EL device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 1 except that DPVDPAN was not used but Alq and Rull were simultaneously vacuum vapor deposited.<br>
The properties of the obtained device were evaluated. A current of 6.9 mA/cm2 was found under a voltage of 6 V. The luminance was 173 cd/m2 and the efficiency was 2.5 cd/A. Therefore, the efficiency in Example 1 was 1.5 times as high as the efficiency in Comparative Example 1. When the device was driven under a constant current at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2, the half-life time was as short as 700 hours.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
An organic EL device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 2 except that DPVDPAN was not used but Alq and DC5 were simultaneously vacuum vapor deposited.<br><br>
The properties of the obtained device were evaluated. A current of 2.2 mA/cm2 was found under a voltage of 6 V. The luminance was 148 cd/m2 and the efficiency was 6.7 cd/A. When the device was driven under a constant current at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2, the half-life time was as short as 1,800 hours. Therefore, the efficiency and the life time in Example 2 were more excellent than those in Comparative Example 2.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
An organic EL device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 12 except that EM35 was not used but Gaq and Rub6P were simultaneously vacuum vapor deposited.<br>
The properties of the obtained device were evaluated. A current of 12 mA/cm2 was found under a voltage of 6 V. The luminance was 650 cd/m2 and the efficiency was 5.4 cd/A. Therefore, the efficiency in Example 1 was 1.5 times as high as the efficiency in Comparative Example 1. When the device was driven under a constant current at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2, the half-life time was as short as 1,900 hours. Therefore, the efficiency and the life time in Example 12 were more excellent than those in Comparative Example 3.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
An organic EL device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 1 except that DPVDPAN was not used and DPA, Alq and Rull were simultaneously vacuum vapor deposited. The properties of the obtained device were evaluated. A current of 2.7 mA/cm2 was found under a voltage of 7 V.   The luminance<br><br>
was 130 cd/m2. The efficiency was as low as 2.2 cd/A. When the device was driven under a constant current at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd/m2, short circuit occurred after 250 hours. Thus, no improvements were found in comparison with the organic EL obtained in Comparative Example 1.   The properties were inferior to those in Example 1.<br>
