				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of pre-processing an audio signal, transmitted to a user terminal via a communication network, for improving a quality of an output of the audio signal, and an apparatus using the method. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of pre-processing an audio signal which can prevent deterioration of a sound quality of the audio signal by pre-processing the audio signal, transmitted to the user terminal via the communication network, and enabling a codec module, encoding the audio signal, to determine the audio signal as a speech signal, and an apparatus using the method.<br>
Background Art<br>
A substitute ring back tone (RBT) providing service, that is one of multimedia services provided in a communication terminal, indicates a type of a service which transmits a predetermined audio signal, selected by a user of a subscriber's terminal to a caller terminal via a communication network when a call connectibn is requested from the caller terminal to the subscriber terminal, or when the call connection is requested from the subscriber terminal. As an example, when the subscriber terminal requests a called terminal, i.e. a subscriber terminal, for the call connection, the substitute RBT providing service transmits the audio signal 'I love you' to the subscriber terminal until a second user of the called terminal answers the call connection, such as by an off hook, and when the caller terminar requests the subscriber terminal for the call connection, the substitute RBT providing service transmits the audio signal 'I love you' to the caller terminal until the user of the subscriber terminal answers the call connection, such as by the off hook.<br>
Generally, over communication networks, an audio signal is encoded using a speech codec, i.e. a linear predictive coding (LPC) based codec, instead of using an audio signal exclusive codec to encode the audio signal that is, transmitted to the caller terminal or the called terminal. However, when the audio signal is encoded using the LPC based speech codec, the audio signal, generated to be played by the caller terminal or the subscriber terminal, is distorted in comparison to an original audio signal, and a comfort noise occurs during playing of the audio signal due to following reasons.<br>
The speech signal is encoded to be transmitted into a speech codec at a low bit rate<br><br>
since a bandwidth of a speech channel used on a mobile communication network is comparatively narrower than a wired telephone having a bandwidth of approximately 64 kbps. Generally, speech codecs used in the mobile* terminal are LPC-based compression methods. The LPC-based speech compression methods are efficient to compress a speech signal of a user in a low/intermediate bit rate since the LPC-based speech compression methods use an optimized model for a vocalization structure of the user, however, a deterioration of a sound quality may occur.    The reasons are as follows:<br>
(1)	A formant frequency and a pitch period, i.e. most important parameters for a<br>
speech compression in the LPC based speech codec, may not be appropriately extracted in an<br>
audio signal.    A pitch, a parameter corresponding to a fundamental frequency, is generated<br>
by a periodical vibration of a vocal cord.    In case of the speech signal, a pitch exists in<br>
frequency bands from approximately 50 Hz to 500 Hz. Conversely, in case of the audio signal,<br>
a pitch may exist in a wider frequency band than the speech signal.   Also, a single pitch<br>
exists in the speech signal.    However, a nurrtber of pitches may exist in the audio signal.<br>
(2)	Spectra of the audio signal are comparatively complex when compared to spectra<br>
of the speech signal.    In the case of the speech signal having simple spectra, remaining<br>
signals after extracting a parameter may be comparatively fully modeled.    This is opposite<br>
from the audio signal.<br>
(3)	Using a voice activity detection (VAD) and a discontinuous transmission (DTX)<br>
in the LPC based speech codec may be one of the reasons.    When the user communicates on<br>
a terminal, the DTX is used in an interval without speech signals so that speech signals are<br>
not transmitted since, according to statistics, no more than 50% of an entire calling time<br>
during an actual calling time are speech signals being transmitted/received.    Subsequently,<br>
an efficiency of a frequency can be improved since a power consumption can be reduced in<br>
the subscriber terminal, and a level of an 4 overall interference can be reduced in an air<br>
interface.    Operation of the DTX is determined depending on the VAD.<br>
To describe operations of the DTX and the VAD, the VAD analyzes at least one parameter with respect to the audio signal extracted from the speech codec, determines whether the audio signal is a speech interval or a speechless interval with respect to the at least one parameter, 1) as a result of the determination, when the audio signal is the speech interval, the DTX transmits the extracted at least one parameter to a demodulator in a receiver, and the subscriber terminal plays the audio signal based on the parameter.<br><br>
Also, 2) as a result of the determination, when the audio signal is the speechless interval, the DTX generates a minimum parameter to transmit to the demodulator in the receiver, and the subscriber terminal plays a comfort noise according to the parameter. As described above, when the speech codec determines a normal audio signal as a speechless interval, the subscriber terminal may play the audio signal, transmitted to a RBT interval, as the comfort noise. Even when a number of mobile communication service providers are providing the substitute RBT providing service, a corresponding audio signal is inaudible, or is distorted when transmitted to the subscriber terminal due to a deterioration of the sound quality in the substitute RBT play interval.<br>
In order to prevent a cut off phenomenon, occurring in the receiver by determining the audio signal as the speechless signal or playirtg the comfort noise instead of the audio signal, there are two methods as follows: 1) changing a codec of a base station and a terminal, and 2) transmitting the audio signal via a data network. However, the two methods have problems in that the two methods may bring a change to a great number of present systems, which are already built, and costs may be increased.<br>
Thus, in all applied examples, in a predetermined audio signal transmitted via the communication network, including the example of the transmitting the substitute RBT to the subscriber terminal, a new method enabling a speech codec to determine an interval( which is being determined as a speechless interval in a conventional art-omit?,) as a speech interval when encoding a specific audio signal via the communication network is required.<br>

FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method of pre-processing an audio signal for improving an output of the audio signal according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, the method of pre-processing an audio signal for improving the output of the audio signal according to the other embodiment of the present invention may include: (1) pre-processing with respect to an audio signal, and (2) encoding with respect to the pre-processed audio signal. The pre-processing with respect to the audio signal may include the following operations 401 through 404, and the encoding with respect to the pre-processed audio signal may include operations 405 through 408.<br>
In operation 401, an apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal separates the audio signal into at least one channel.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus of preprocessing the audio signal may separate the audio signal into the at least one channel for each frequency using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. As an example, the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal may separate the audio signal into sixteen channels using the FFT algorithm.<br>
In operation 402, the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal measures a first channel energy with respect to each of the at least one channel.<br>
In operation 403, the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal selects a specific channel energy from the measured first channel energies of the at least one channel. As an example, the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal may select a channel having the greatest channel energy for the specific channel energy.<br>
In operation 404, the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal amplifies the specific channel energy by multiplying a predetermined amplification coefficient by the selected specific channel energy.<br><br>
According to the present invention, when the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal amplifies the specific channel energy, a probability that a codec module determines the audio signal as a speech signal by increasing a signal to noise ratio (SNR) may be increased.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus of preprocessing the audio signal estimates a first background noise of each of the at least one channel, and may amplify the specific channel energy by selectively multiplying the predetermined amplification coefficient by the selected specific channel energy according to the estimated first background noise. As an example, when the estimated first background noise is less than a predetermined reference value, the specific channel energy is not amplified, and when the estimated first background noise is greater than the predetermined<br>
reference value, the specific channel energy is amplified.<br>
The audio signal, having been pre-processed by undergoing the above describe<br>
operations 401 through 404, is inputted in the codec module according to the present invention, and may be encoded to be transmitted via a communication network. The encoding operation may include the following operations 405 through 408.<br>
In operation 405, the codec module, encoding the audio signal, measures a second channel energy of each of the at least one channel with respect to the audio signal where the first specific channel energy is amplified, and estimates a second background noise with respect to each of at least one channel. Namely, the first channel energy is a channel energy that is estimated during the pre-processing with respect to the audio signal, and the second channel energy is a channel energy that is measured after the pre-processing with respect to the audio signal.<br>
Also, the second background noise nlay be calculated as Equation 1,<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
E,,(m + \,i) = max{E m,n,0.9En(m, i) + 0. lEch(m, /)},    0 
Ed,(m, i) indicates a channel energy of an /' th channel in a frame ' m ', and En(m, i) indicates a background noise of an / th channel in the frame 'm\ and Nc indicates a number of channels.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the codec module may use an AMR VAD option 2.<br>
According to still another embodiment of the present invention, the codec module may compare average values of the second specific channel energy and the at least one<br><br>
second channel energy among the measured at least one second channel energy, and determine the audio signal as a sinusoidal wave when the second specific channel energy is greater than the average value. As known |o those skilled in the art, when a predetermined signal is determined as the sinusoidal wave, a corresponding signal may be a signal having specific frequency which has especially strong power, subsequently a probability that the corresponding signal may be determined as a speech signal may be increased.<br>
In order to calculate the second specific channel energy, the following Equation 2<br>
may be used.	'<br><br>
The Ech(m, i) indicates a channel energy of an i th channel in an frame m, the Ni indicates a number of channels, the Ó8n-1j=0 Ech(m,j)/Nt indicates an average value of the second channel energy.<br>
Referring to Equation 1, when the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal amplifies the first specific channel energy, a background noise of a channel having the first specific channel energy is amplified at the same time. According to the present invention, when the audio signal, having been pre-processed by undergoing operations 401 through 404, is already amplified with a channel energy of a channel having a specific channel energy, the codec module may compare average energy values of the second specific channel energy, calculated by referring to Equation 2, and other channels, and may determine the pre-processed audio signal as the sinusoidal wave.<br>
Referring to Equation 1, when a specific energy is comparatively greater than an average channel energy of entire channel energies, Ö(m) increases, and when a specific energy is not greater than the average channel energy of the entire channel energies, Ö(m) decreases. As an example, the AMR VAD option 2 presumes a corresponding audio signal as a sinusoidal wave when Ö(m) is greater than ten, and when the sinusoidal wave is detected, the AMR VAD option 2 does not amplify a background noise.<br>
Namely, an SNR of all the channels increases and a background noise may not be updated by amplifying a channel energy of a specific channel. Also, since the amplification is performed with respect to a channel energy having a specific channel energy, the SNR of<br><br>
all the channels, which  is measured using the second channel energy and the second background noise with respect to the pre-processed audio signal, may be improved.<br>
In operations 406, the codec module measures an SNR of each channel using the second channel energy and the second background noise with respect to the each channel. The SNR may be measured by Equation 3.<br>
Ech(m,i) indicates a channel energy of an / th channel in an frame m ,<br>
En(m, i) indicates a background noise of the i th channel in the frame m, and Nc indicates<br>
a number of channels,	<br>
In operation 407, the codec module calculates a speech distance based on the SNR. According to the present invention, the speech distance may be calculated by summing up the SNRs with respect to the each channel.<br>
In operation 408, the codec module determines the audio signal as the speech signal when the speech distance is greater than a predetermined threshold value, and encodes the audio signal.<br>
According to the present invention, the speech distance, i.e. the summed SNRs with respect to the each channel, increases to be greater than the speech distance with respect to a previous audio signal due to the first specific channel energy, amplified during the preprocessing, therefore the codec module may determine the audio signal as the speech signal.<br>
The predetermined threshold value measures a long term peak signal to noise ratio based on the SNR of each of the at least one channel, and is determined depending on the measured long term peak SNR. Namely, the predetermined threshold value is maintained to be in inverse proportion to the measured long term peak SNR, when the long term peak SNR is greater than the predetermined threshold value, the long term peak SNR is determined as a predetermined first threshold value, and when the long term peak SNR is less than the<br>
predetermined threshold value, the long term peak SNR is determined as a predetermined<br>
second threshold value.    The first threshold value is greater than the second threshold value.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a method of pre-processing an audio signal for improving an output of the audio signal according to still another embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Descriptions regarding operations which would correspond to operations 501 through 503 and operations 505 through 508 will be omitted since the descriptions are the same as operations 401 through 403 and 406 through 408 of FIG. 4, and operations 504 and 505 will be described in the specification.<br>
In operation 504, an apparatus of pre-processing an audio signal decreases a channel energy by multiplying a predetermined amplification coefficient by channel energies except a channel having a specific channel energy. Namely, when the apparatus of pre-processing the audio signal decreases the channel energy by multiplying the predetermined amplification coefficient by the channel energy except the channel having the specific channel energy, the specific channel energy becomes comparatively increased since the channel energies are decreased except the channel having the specific channel energy<br>
In operation 505, the codec module, encoding the audio signal, measures a second channel energy of each of channels with respect to'the audio signal, having channel energies which are decreased except the channel having the specific channel energy, and estimates a second background noise of the each of the channels. Also, the second background noise may be estimated as Equation 1.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an inner configuration of an apparatus 600 of pre-processing an audio signal according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 6, the apparatus 600 of pre-processing the audio signal includes a channel separation module 601, a channel estimation module 602, and a channel energy amplification module 603.<br>
