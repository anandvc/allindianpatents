				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The proposed invention has incorporated two technologies that only combined can provide for a method for detection of viable microorganisms. These are: a. providing for a smooth surface on which the bacteria are placed so as not to need for continuously focusing on the slide as it scans the specimen. b. provide a system that allows for a very large view of vision. This has been accomplished by (a) using a sol-gel coated slide which has a smooth surface or any other smooth porous surface that allows for holding the enzyme detection chemicals (&quot;markers&quot;) in place without washing the bacteria from the slide, and (b) using a 16 bit or higher CCD camera as outlined in illustration number 1. Another very important aspect that should be taken into account is that, by using ^ this concept the time for scanning the system can be shortened and two (or more) wavelengths for detecting various &quot;markers&quot; can be used simultaneously. This system can provide for preventing false positives.</td>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process of detection and enumeration of microorganisms such as bacteria in a relatively shorter period than any of the conventional methods and also to an apparatus for the performance of the said process. In one embodiment of the invention, the apparatus being used may be a stationery unit such as a laboratory unit or even can be a compact system such as a portable unit. The foregoing disclosure is a general way of describing the invention and does not construe to limit the scope of the invention. It may also be noted that the permutation and combination known to persons skilled in the art are included which may not be mentioned here.<br>
Accordingly, a process of detection and enumeration of viable micro-organisms<br>
such as bacteria in a shorter time period comprising the steps of<br>
(i)	Providing a liquid composition comprising one or more marker(s)<br>
incorporated in a liquid sol-gel precursor or porous glass slide; or filter<br>
pad;<br>
(ii)	Coating a transparent slide, porous surface e. g., a glass slide, with a<br>
thin uniform layer of said liquid sol-gel precursor composition;<br>
(iii)	Filtering the said given sample such as a specimen liquid to be tested<br>
through a filter so as to capture the live bacteria on the filter;<br>
(iv)	These captured bacteria that are on the filter are then exposed to a<br><br>
The size and shape of the light dots - light spots larger than 10 microns shall be considered not bacterial.<br>
Light glows and shadows are to be eliminated.<br>
The proposed invention can allow for preventing false positive results by incorporating several marker simultaneously. This allows for eliminating false positives that can be created by fluorescent artifacts or non target bacteria that could have broken down the marker. Such a case could be in the instance of conform detection when using derivatives of MUG. In this case not only coliform bacteria are detected by also aeromonas and psuedamonas can uptake the marker thereby causing a false positive. In order to overcome this the proposed invention has the capability of capturing several pictures of the specimen at various wavelengths thereby allowing for looking at various conditions of marker uptake. If for example, three markers e.g. Resorufin 1-D-galactopyranoside, SYBR Green and an oxidase fluorescent were mixed together by illuminating the specimen at different wavelengths a different information would arrive. The SYBR green would detect all microorganisms thereby eliminating non-organic fluorescent artifacts. Each light source would be given an exact x-y coordinate by the computer for reference to later readings. The resorufin would detect all viable bacteria that would be able to metabolize MUG derivatives (coliform, aeromonas and psuedomonas). Their exact position would be recorded so as to be analysed and compared to the previous picture taken by the CCD camera. The oxidase fluorescent would then determine which of the fluorescent bacteria are nonconform and again since the exact x-y coordinates are known these points would be subtracted from the light sources already known.<br>
Double Dye Approach: During this step bacteria are labeled in such a way to provide sufficient data for target bacteria discrimination. Dye chosen for bacteria labeling   shall   be   accumulated   and   emit  high   intensity  fluorescence   light.<br><br>
Combining two differently fluorescing dyes targeted to different bacterium traits or organelles will provide us with target validation and confirmation.<br>
For the purpose of clarity, and as an aid in the understanding of the invention, as disclosed and claimed herein, the following abbreviations are defined below: CFU-colony forming unit.<br><br><br><br>
