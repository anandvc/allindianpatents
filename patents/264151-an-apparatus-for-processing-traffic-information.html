Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[28]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
[29]	Hereinafter, for understanding of the present invention, traffic information<br>
according to the present invention will be described. Examples of traffic information<br>
include congestion and travel and time information (CTT), safety driving information<br>
(SDI), point of interest (POI) information, public transport information (PTI), road<br>
traffic message (RTM), parking information (PKI), traffic status image information<br>
(TSI), and news information (NWS). Accordingly, traffic information will be used as a<br>
term indicative of information including the aforementioned kinds of information. To<br>
facilitate understanding of the present invention, it is to be understood that the term<br>
"TPEG" used in the following description and drawings is involved in traffic in-<br>
formation.<br>
[30]	FIG. 1 briefly illustrates a digital multimedia broadcasting system providing traffic<br>
information. A method for transmitting and receiving traffic information will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1. The digital multimedia broadcasting system<br>
includes a network 110 collecting traffic information related contents, a traffic in-<br>
formation server 120 providing the collected contents, a broadcasting center 130, and a<br>
terminal 140. The traffic information server 120 reconstructs various kinds of traffic<br>
information collected from other servers via various routes, for example, the network<br>
110, and transmits the reconstructed information to a cellular phone, a vehicle, a<br>
personal digital assistant (PDA) 140, or a receiver provided in other portable terminal<br><br>
through a transmitter of the broadcasting center 130. In addition, the terminal includes,<br>
but is not limited to, a navigator and a computer such as a notebook computer. The<br>
traffic information server 120 may use a data channel of digital broadcasting as a route<br>
for transmitting traffic information. Alternatively, the traffic information server 120<br>
may use wire and wireless Internet, for example, a broadband wireless medium such as<br>
Wi-Fi or wireless broadband Internet (Wibro), or wired Internet. In particular, the<br>
traffic information server 120 may use a transparent data channel (TDC) or a<br>
multimedia object transport (MOT) protocol of digital broadcasting media if data<br>
service of digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) is used.<br>
[31]	FIG. 2 illustrates an example of signal formats of traffic information. A format of<br>
traffic information and a container included in traffic information will be described<br>
with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
[32]	The format of traffic information transmitted from the traffic information server 120<br>
via wire can have a sequence of message segment as shown in FIG. 2. The message<br>
segment includes traffic information, and in FIG. 2, message segment of the traffic in-<br>
formation is represented by message. The message segment which contains each type<br>
of traffic information includes a message management container 202, a CTT-status<br>
container 204, and a TPEG-location container 206.<br>
[33]	As described above, the traffic information including various kinds of information<br>
can be transmitted. Hereinafter, congestion and travel time information (it may be<br>
referred to as CTT or congestion traffic status information) representing road<br>
congestion status among various kinds of traffic information will be described as an<br>
example of traffic information. Accordingly, the CTT-status container 204 will be<br>
referred to as a status container of congestion traffic.<br>
[34]	The message management container 202 of congestion traffic information includes<br>
message identification information and information of date and time, and is used to<br>
manage information received in an apparatus for receiving traffic information. The<br>
message identification information which is a necessary element of message includes a<br>
message identifier (MID) and a version number (VER). The message identifier (MID)<br>
is an identifier of one message related to each status in a service component included<br>
in each type of traffic information. In the present invention, the message identification<br>
number increases from "0" by "1". If the message identification number reaches 65535<br>
corresponding to maximum number, the message identification number is initiated to<br>
"0". The version number means a sequential number for identifying serial messages<br>
having a single message identifier. For example, any one of numbers from 0 to 255<br>
may be assigned to the version number, and it is general that the version number may<br>
be sequentially increased from 0 to 255.<br>
[35]	Examples of date and time included in the message management container may<br><br>
include start time and end time of traffic information, message erasing time, and<br>
schedule information. However, since the congestion traffic status information<br>
includes current traffic status information of each point rather than information of<br>
unexpected status varying every moment, the congestion status information (CTT) may<br>
not include start time, end time, message erasing time, and schedule information. The<br>
TPEG-location container 206 includes location information intended to notify traffic<br>
information.<br>
[36]	A number of kinds of congestion status information of the CTT-status container 204<br>
may respectively be transmitted to various service components, wherein each<br>
component can be identified by a component identifier.<br>
[37]	FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 respectively illustrate transport formats of the congestion traffic<br>
status container and the TPEG-location container included in the traffic information<br>
message.<br>
[38]	As shown in FIG. 3, the CTT status container 31 includes a CTT component 311 in<br>
which congestion and travel time information (CTT) status is recorded, a CTT<br>
component 313 in which CTT status prediction is recorded, and an additional in-<br>
formation component 315 in which additional information is recorded.<br>
[39]	The CTT component 311 may include a status component 331 in which average<br>
link speed is recorded, a status component 333 in which link travel time is recorded, a<br>
status component 335 in which link delay time is recorded, and a status component 337<br>
in which congestion type information is recorded.<br>
[40]	Hereinafter, a link is used as a road identifier and it is employed in identifying the<br>
particular road from traffic information. The average link speed means an average<br>
speed of a vehicle in a particular link, the link travel time means duration for which a<br>
vehicle passes a particular link. The link delay time means a delayed time for which a<br>
vehicle passes a particular link, and congestion type information means predefined<br>
typical information of congestion status.<br>
[41]	The CTT component 313 may include a CTT status prediction component 351 in<br>
which prediction information of average link speed is recorded, a CTT status<br>
prediction component 353 in which prediction information of link travel time is<br>
recorded, and a CTT status prediction component 355 in which congestion change in-<br>
formation is recorded. Namely, the prediction average link speed means a predictive<br>
average speed of a vehicle in a particular link at a specific time point, the prediction<br>
link travel time means a link travel time predicted at a specific time point, and<br>
congestion change information means change of congestion status.<br>
[42]	The additional information component 315 may include auxiliary data that is<br>
transmitted as part of a TPEG message. The auxiliary data may be text data or audio/<br>
video data. For example, the congestion type component 440 may be represented as a<br><br>
predefined code or a text string stored in the additional information component 420. In<br>
another example, the additional information component 420 may store video data, such<br>
as an image of a moving traffic for a link or road described in a received TPEG<br>
message. The video data may include moving images and/or still images. In yet<br>
another example, the additional information component 420 may store data describing<br>
various places of interest, such as theatres or restaurants, associated with a link<br>
described in a TPEG message.<br>
[43]	A language code representing basic language for a location reference component<br>
324 is recorded (322) in the TPEG-location container 32 shown in FIG. 4 including<br>
location information corresponding to the congestion traffic status container shown in<br>
FIG. 4. The TPEG-location container 32 includes the location reference component<br>
324 in which location coordinates are recorded.<br>
[44]	Information of "location type" 342 is recorded in the location reference component<br>
324, and is represented by Link ID as shown in FIG. 26. A unique ID code is given to<br>
each link using Link ID so that information of road or link can be transmitted using the<br>
code, whereby data between transmission and reception can be reduced.<br>
[45]	A mode type list 344 represents definition of a traffic means. For example, the code<br>
represents definition of a traffic means such as bus, ship, plane, and car.<br>
[46]	The link identifier 346 defines a link system enabling a determination of a link<br>
location type of a particular link. For example, a link system of the link ID may be<br>
determined by comparing the link system identifier value with an entry in a link system<br>
look-up table. The entry in the link system look-up table may be indicative of a<br>
standard link system, such as an intelligent traffic system prescribed by Ministry of<br>
Construction &amp; Transportation ("MCOT") of the Republic of Korea. In another<br>
example, the link identifier 346 may directly specify a standard link system. In<br>
addition, a descriptor 348 includes additional supplement data on an actual link,<br>
wherein examples of the additional supplement data include text data or audio/video<br>
data. In another example, the link identifier 346 may directly specify a standard link<br>
system.<br>
[47]	The link identifier 346 includes a link ID component 362 associated with a<br>
particular link, such as a road. The link ID may be unique to a particular link. The link<br>
ID may be globally unique or unique within a predetermined geographic region. In one<br>
example, the link ID component 362 may be specified using code values prescribed by<br>
various communications standards, such as the Intelligent Traffic System standard. In<br>
another example, the link ID may include coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) of<br>
the links vertices. In yet another example, the link ID may be a character string, a<br>
number, or a combination of above, such as "0 K_Ave_3456_Atlanta_US."<br>
[48]	Furthermore, the link identifier 346 includes information of a link vertex<br><br>
component 364. The link vertex component 364 identifies the type of vertices that are<br>
created by a link, so that the link can be more precisely depicted on a map. A higher<br>
number of vertices provide more accurate maps or directions. For example, if the link<br>
vertex component 364 includes 100 vertices, the map may be displayed in a VGA<br>
mode. On the other hand, if the link vertex component: 364 includes 1000 vertices, the<br>
map may be displayed in a higher resolution, such as SVGA.<br>
[49]	Finally, the link identifier component 346 includes a road type list component 366<br>
that identifies the type of a road represented by the link.<br>
[50]	An example of the descriptor 348 can include text or various audio/video data,<br>
wherein the text may be used name and additional description of link which is not<br>
defined on the link identifier. A code representing that a descriptor type 382 is a link<br>
identifier can be recorded to record name of link, and name or additional description of<br>
link can be recorded in the descriptor 384.<br>
[51]	A structure of the congestion traffic status container is shown in FIG. 4 based on hi-<br>
erarchical connection between respective components constituting messages while<br>
syntaxes of a detailed structure of each component are shown in FIG. 5 to FIG. 13.<br>
[52]	The "CTT component 80" transmits current CTT status information contained in the<br>
CTT status container of FIG. 3. For example, an ID "80hex" 402 may be assigned to<br>
the CTT component. The CTT component 80 includes at least one status component<br>
406, for example, one or more (M) status components 406 (e.g., M number of status<br>
components). The CTT component 80 includes a byte-unit data length field 404 for<br>
indicating an overall data length of the status component in byte units. In particular,<br>
Table 1 shows some of the exemplarily variable types used to describe the exemplary<br>
structures for CTT components.<br><br><br><br>
[54]	Each status component may include at least one of the average link speed, the link<br>
travel time, the link delay time, and the congestion type, which are configured in the<br>
forms of syntaxes of FIG. 6 to FIG. 4E. Referring to FIG. 6, the status component<br>
("status._component (00)") including the average link speed can be assigned with an ID<br>
"00 hex," and data of the speed defined in units of Km/h can be contained in the status<br>
component ("status_component (00)".<br>
[55]	As shown in FIG. 7, a specific ID "01 hex" is assigned to the status component<br>
("status._component(01)") equipped with link travel time information, and data of the<br>
link travel time may be defined in units of seconds (i.e., sec. units).<br>
[56]	Referring to FIG. 8, a specific ID "02 hex" is assigned to the status component<br>
("status._component(02)") equipped with the link delay time information, and data of<br>
the delay time based on links is defined in units of seconds.As shown in FIG. 4E, a<br>
specific ID "03 hex" is assigned to the status component ("status_component(03)")<br>
equipped with congestion type information, and congestion type data is recorded by<br>
codes defined in a CTT application table 03 (CTT 03) (table 2). For example,<br>
"ctt03_1" is recorded in case of smooth traffic, "ctt03._1," "ctt03_2" is recorded in case<br>
of slow traffic, "ctt03_3" is recorded in case of delay traffic, and "ctt03_4" is recorded<br>
in case of congested traffic.<br><br>
[58]	Referring to FIG. 10, the CTT component ("ctt_component(81)") for transmitting<br>
CTT prediction information is assigned with an ID "81 hex" 412, and includes at least<br>
one status component 416 (e.g., M number of prediction status components). The CTT<br><br>
component ("ctt_component(81)") includes a byte-unit data length field 414 for<br>
indicating an overall data length of the status component in byte units. Each status<br>
component includes the average link speed prediction, the link travel time prediction,<br>
the link delay time prediction, and/or the congestion change, which are configured in<br>
the forms of syntaxes of FIG. 11 to FIG. 13.<br>
[59]	Referring to FIG. 11, the prediction status component<br>
("prediction_status_component(00)") including the average link speed prediction is<br>
assigned with a specific ID "00 hex" and data of the speed defined in units of Km/h<br>
may be contained in the prediction status component<br>
("prediction_status_component(00)").<br>
[60]	As shown in FIG. 12, a specific ID "01 hex" is assigned to the prediction status<br>
component ("prediction_status_component(01)") equipped with link travel time<br>
prediction information. Data of the link travel time prediction may be defined in units<br>
of seconds (i.e., sec. units), and includes time information associated with a designated<br>
prediction time.<br>
[61]	As shown in FIG. 13, a specific ID "02 hex" is assigned to the prediction status<br>
component ("prediction_status_component(02)") equipped with the congestion change<br>
information, and congestion change data may be recorded by codes defined in the CTT<br>
message table 04 (Table 3). For example, "ctt04_01" is recorded if the link speed<br>
increases more than before, "ctt04_2" is recorded if the link speed decreases less than<br>
before, and "ctt04_3" is recorded if the link speed is equal to before.<br><br>
[63]	FIG. 14 illustrates a syntax of additional information contained in a status<br>
component according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 14, a specific ID "8A<br>
hex" is assigned to the status component ("ctt_component(8A)") equipped with<br>
additional information. Additional information data contained in the CTT component<br><br>
("ctt_component(8A)") includes CTT-associated additional information for each<br>
message and auxiliary information for each message. In this case, the CTT-associated<br>
additional information and the auxiliary information are configured in the form of text<br>
data.<br>
[64]	For example, the congestion type component shown in FIG. 9 may represent the<br>
congestion type information using codes defined in the CTT table. However, if the<br>
above-mentioned congestion type information cannot be denoted by the codes defined<br>
in the CTT table, the congestion type component may use a status component equipped<br>
with additional information. As another example, the link speed change information<br>
contained in the prediction status component ("prediction_status_component(02)")<br>
equipped with the link speed change information of FIG. 13 can be represented by<br>
using codes defined in the CTT table. However, if the link speed change information<br>
cannot be represented by using only the codes defined in the table, an additional in-<br>
formation component may be used for the above-mentioned situation.<br>
[65]	In more detail, video data captured by a camera capable of capturing a traffic status<br>
for each link is contained in the additional information component, such that the<br>
additional information component equipped with the video data may be transmitted to<br>
a user or users. In this case, the video data may include moving images and still<br>
images. In yet another example, if a famous restaurant or a historical place or theater is<br>
contained in a specific link indicating the status information, information associated<br>
with the above-mentioned places may also be contained in the CTT component<br>
("CTT_component(8A)").<br>
[66]	The TPEG location container of FIG. 3 hierarchically includes a plurality of<br>
components contained in the message. Detailed descriptions and syntaxes of individual<br>
components are depicted in FIG. 15 to FIG. 25.<br>
[67]	Referring to FIG. 15, the TPEG location container (tpeg_loc_container) for<br>
indicating location information corresponding to the above-mentioned status in-<br>
formation records basic languages for the TPEG location component<br>
(tpeg_loc_container) using the code 602 defined in the location reference table "Ioc41"<br>
(not shown). For example, in the case of the Korean language, data "Ioc41_65" is<br>
recorded in the TPEG location container. Also, the TPEG location container may<br>
include at least one TPEG location component (tpeg_loc_component) 604 (e.g., M<br>
number of TPEG location components).<br>
[68]	Referring to FIG. 16, a specific ID "00 hex" 612 is assigned to the TPEG location<br>
component ("tpeg_location_ component(00)") equipped with the location coordinates.<br>
The TPEG location component ("tpeg_location_component(00)") includes a byte-unit<br>
data length field 614 for indicating a corresponding component data length in byte<br>
units. Also, the TPEG location component ("tpeg_loc,_component(00)") includes a<br><br>
specific field 616 capable of indicating a location type using codes prescribed in the<br>
location reference table "loc01" (not shown), and also includes at least one coordinates<br>
component (co-ordinates_component) 618 (e.g., M number of coordinates<br>
components).<br>
[69]	Referring to FIG. 17, the coordinates component ("co-ordinates_component(00)")<br>
equipped with mode-type information (i.e., transportation-type information) is<br>
assigned with a specific ID "00 hex" 612, and includes at least one mode-type<br>
component (mode_component) (e.g., M mode components).<br>
[70]	As shown in FIG. 18, the mode-type component ("mode_component(00)")<br>
equipped with the mode-type information is assigned with a specific ID "00 hex" such<br>
that it indicates which one of transportation means is used by codes defined in the<br>
TPEG location reference table "loc05" For example, if a mode type is determined to be<br>
a train, the mode-type component indicates the value "loc05_2". If a mode type is<br>
determined to be a bus, the mode-type component indicates the value "loc05_6".<br>
[71]	Referring to FIG. 19, the coordinates component ("co-ordinates_component(02)")<br>
equipped with link description is assigned with a specific ID "02 hex" 622, such that it<br>
indicates which one of descriptors is used by codes defined in the TPEG location<br>
reference table "loc03" 624. For example, if the descriptor type indicates link de-<br>
scription of road and relates to a link ID, the coordinates component 02<br>
(co-ordinates_component 02) is represented by the value "loc03_44".<br>
[72]	A coordinates component 02 (co-ordinates_component 02) equipped with link de-<br>
scription includes at least one descriptor component (descriptor_component) 628 (e.g.,<br>
M number of descriptor components). The coordinates component may record the link<br>
description in the form of short strings. In this case, the above-mentioned link de-<br>
scription may be a link ID, or may be link-associated text description such as road<br>
names. If the link ID is written by the short strings, bytes are unnecessarily wasted. In<br>
order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present invention includes the co-<br>
ordinates component equipped with the link ID based on a standard node or node<br>
system in the TPEG location component. Identifying the particular link from the<br>
received link information may include comparing the link identification value with an<br>
entry in a link identification look-up table. The particular link may be associated with a<br>
predetermined link identification value in the link identification look-up table. The link<br>
identification value may be unique to the particular link. Identifying the particular link<br>
from the received traffic information may further include storing an entry in the link<br>
identification look-up table.<br>
[73]	Referring to FIG. 20, a specific ID "04 hex" is assigned to the coordinates<br>
component ("co-ordinates_component(04)") equipped with the link identifier (ID) in-<br>
formation. The coordinates component ("co-ordmates_component(04)") indicates<br><br>
which one of links is used as the link ID by codes defined in the location reference<br>
table "loc43". For example, in the case of using a specific ID contained in the standard<br>
link system prescribed by Ministry Of Construction &amp; Transportation (MOCT) of the<br>
Republic of Korea, the above-mentioned coordinates component 04 is denoted by "loc<br>
43_1". At least one link component "link_component" (e.g., M number of link<br>
components) is contained in the coordinates component<br>
("co-ordinates_component(04)"). The link component may include a link ID or a link<br>
vertex.<br>
[74]	Referring to FIG. 21, a specific ID "00 hex" is assigned to the link component<br>
("link_component(00)") equipped with predefined link ID data. The link component<br>
("link_component(00)") includes predetermined link ID data defined in either the<br>
TPEG receiver or the TPEG server. For example, the link component<br>
("link_component(00)") may use the link ID defined in the intelligent traffic system<br>
standard node link. In this case, the link ID information may indicate the coordinates<br>
component equipped with a single link ID, and may also indicate other coordinates<br>
components equipped with several link IDs or multiple link IDs.<br>
[75]	Referring to FIG. 22, information associated with a vertex between links<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as link-vertex information) is recorded in a link component<br>
("link_component (01)"). A specific ID "01 hex" is assigned to the link component<br>
("link_component (01)". The link component ("link_component (01)") includes in-<br>
formation associated with 23 vertexes or less. The coordinates component<br>
("co-ordinates_component(02)") includes at least one vertex component (e.g., M<br>
number of vertex components) equipped with vertex data. In this case, the above-<br>
mentioned vertex allows a terminal for receiving traffic information to recognize either<br>
coordinates or a link shape designated by a link ID, such that the above-mentioned<br>
terminal can express the recognized coordinates or link shape in the form of graphic<br>
data using the vertex. The vertex is latitude/longitude information defined by the<br>
WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) format. However, it should be noted that the<br>
scope of the above-mentioned term "vertex" can also be applied to similar terms or<br>
other examples as necessary. The link system may be a vertex-based link system,<br>
where the link identification value is indicative of one or more vertices, and identifying<br>
the particular link from the received link information is further based upon the one or<br>
more vertices.<br>
[76]	Referring to FIG. 23, a specific ID "00 hex" is assigned to a vertex component<br>
("vertex_component(00)") for recording vertex information using the WGS84 format.<br>
The above-mentioned vertex component ("vertex_component(00)") includes latitude/<br>
longitude data designated by 10 micro-degree units. In this case, the latitude/longitude<br>
data starts from "0" such that it increases by 10 micro-degree units. The terminal for<br><br>
receiving traffic information, unequipped with an electronic map can more realistically<br>
display the road shape on the basis of the above-mentioned coordinates information on<br>
the screen. Therefore, the number of vertexes has a scale (e.g., a scale of 10000:1)<br>
lower than that of an electronic map stored in a disc. The vertex component (00) may<br>
include the number of vertexes to visually display a desired road on a VGA or QVGA.<br>
For example, the number of vertexes may be determined to be equal to or less than 23.<br>
[77]	As shown in FIG. 24, a specific ID "02 hex" is assigned to the link component<br>
("link_component(02)") equipped with road type information. The link component 02<br>
includes at least one road type component ("roadtype_component") (e.g., M number of<br>
road type components). Referring to FIG. 25, a specific ID "00 hex" is assigned to the<br>
road type component ("roadtype_component(00)"), such that the road type component<br>
("roadtype_component(00)") indicates whether a road is a national road (code<br>
loc42_l), a local road (code loc42_2), or an expressway (code loc42_3) by referring to<br>
the codes defined in the location reference table (loc42) (not shown). FIG. 26 to FIG.<br>
28 show location reference tables according to the present invention.<br>
[78]	The table of FIG. 26 is a TPEG location reference table 01 used for the TPEC<br>
location component ("tpeg_loc_component(00)") equipped with location type in-<br>
formation of FIG. 16. The table of FIG. 26 defines specific information capable of<br>
indicating the location type information using codes. For example, if the location in-<br>
formation is a node name, it is represented by the value "loc01_2". Provided that the<br>
location information is denoted by the link ID, it is represented by the value "loc01_.10".<br>
[79]	The table of FIG. 27 is a TPEG location reference table 03 used for the coordinates<br>
component ("co-ordinates_cornponent(02)") equipped with location description of<br>
FIG. 19. The table of FIG. 27 defines location descriptor information using codes. For<br>
example, if the location descriptor is a node name, it is represented by the value<br>
"loc03_.2." In order to indicate a specific case in which the location descriptor is a link<br>
ID, a specific code 44 (702) is added to the TPEG location reference table 03.<br>
Therefore, if the location descriptor is the link ID, it is represented by the value "loc03_44."<br>
[80]	The table of FIG. 28 is a TPEG location reference table 43 used for the coordinates<br>
component ("co-ordinates_component(04)") equipped with the above-mentioned link<br>
ID of FIG. 20. The table of FIG. 28 defines the link ID category information using<br>
codes, such that it can indicate which one of link systems will be used as the link ID.<br>
For example, if the link ID system is the intelligent traffic system prescribed by<br>
Ministry Of Construction &amp; Transportation (MOCT) of the Republic of Korea, it is<br>
represented by the value "loc43_1." If the above-mentioned traffic information is to be<br>
transmitted by the method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving traffic in-<br><br>
formation according to the present invention, an example of transport signal types will<br>
be described below. The method for transmitting and receiving traffic information and<br>
the apparatus for transmitting and receiving traffic information according to the present<br>
invention can transmit and receive traffic information in the form of broadcasting<br>
signal such as digital video broadcasting terrestrial (DVB-T) or digital video<br>
broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H). FIG. 29 illustrates one example of an apparatus for<br>
transmitting traffic information. One example of the apparatus for transmitting traffic<br>
information will be described below.<br>
[81]	Broadcasting signals, for example, audio/video signals are multiplexed by a<br>
multiplexer 10 in the format of MPEG-2 transport stream (TS) and then output. The<br>
above-mentioned traffic information may be multiplexed in the format of MPEG-2 TS<br>
along with the audio/video signals. For energy dispersal, the multiplexer 10<br>
multiplexes MPEG-2 TS type signals including traffic information. An outer coder 21<br>
and an outer interleaver 22 can respectively encode and interleave the multiplexed data<br>
to improve transmission performance of the multiplexed signals. For example, a Reed-<br>
Solomon code method may be used as an outer coding method while a convolution in-<br>
terleaving method may be used as an interleaving method.<br>
[82]	An inner coder 31 and inner interleaver 32 encode transport signals and interleave<br>
the coded signals considering that any error may occur in the transport signals. The<br>
inner coder may code the transport signals in accordance with a punctured convolution<br>
code, and the inner interleaver may use a native or in-depth interleaving method in<br>
accordance with use of a memory in transmission modes of 2k, 4k and 8k.<br>
[83]	A mapper 35 can map the transport signals with symbols in accordance with modes<br>
such as 16QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), 64QAM, and QPSK (quadrature<br>
phase shift keying), considering pilot of the transmission modes and transmission<br>
parameter signaling (TPS). A frame generator 40 modulates the mapped signals in an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) scheme, and generates frames<br>
inserted with a guard interval in a data interval including the modulated signals. Each<br>
frame includes 68 OFDM symbols, wherein each symbol includes 6817 carriers in case<br>
of the mode of 8k while it includes 1705 carriers in case of the mode of 2k. The guard<br>
interval is a cyclic continuation copied from data in the data interval, and its length<br>
depends on the transmission modes. Each of the OFDM frames includes scatter pilot<br>
signals, continuation pilot signals, and TPS carriers. The structure of the frames<br>
generated from the frame generator of FIG. 29 will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
30.<br>
[84]	A digital-to-analog converter 41 converts digital type broadcasting signals having a<br>
guard interval and a data link into analog signals, and a transmission unit 42 can<br>
transmit the converted analog signals to RF signals. The digital-to-analog converter 41<br><br>
and a transmission unit 42 may be in a united transmitter. The traffic information in the<br>
format of MPEG-2 TS can be transmitted in the form of DVB-T. In this case, the<br>
format of MPEG-2 TS may be transmitted in the form of packetized elementary stream<br>
(PES) or section.<br>
[85]	FIG. 30 illustrates signal arrangement according to the frames which the frame<br>
generator generates in FIG. 29. In FIG. 30, Tu represents the number of available sub-<br>
carriers, Dt represents the distance between scatter pilots on a time axis, and Df<br>
represents the distance between scatter pilots on a frequency axis. The distance Df<br>
between the scatter pilots on the frequency area determines a delay range of a ghost<br>
signal, which can be predicted on a channel. Referring to FIG. 30, the location of pilots<br>
to be interpolated during reception of the signals generated by the frame generator, is<br>
shown.<br>
[86]	Symbols are arranged to represent a uniform pilot pattern per four symbols, such<br>
that time interpolation can be executed in the location of the pilots during reception of<br>
the signals. In other words, a first input symbol (t=1) is arranged to represent the same<br>
scatter pilot signal as that of the fifth input symbol (t=5). Time interpolation of the<br>
symbols input at t=2, t=3 and t=4 can be executed in the location of the scatter pilot<br>
signals during reception of the signals.<br>
[87]	Furthermore, the symbol input at t=6 has the same scatter pilot pattern as that of the<br>
symbol input at t=2, and time interpolation of the signals at t=3, t=4 and t=5 can be<br>
executed in the location of the scatter pilot signals of the symbols input at t=6 and t=2.<br>
[88]	In this way, time interpolation is executed as above during reception of the signals<br>
after the symbol is input at t=7. In this case, since the scatter pilots are located for the<br>
symbol input at t=4 per four sub-carriers, the distance between the scatter pilot signals<br>
in the frequency area of the symbol input at t=4 is reduced in the range of 1/4 of the<br>
distance between the original scatter pilot signals, and the symbol input at t=4 has a<br>
pattern where the scatter pilot signals are located per four sub-carriers. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to obtain an advantage that more pilot signals are located in the symbol during<br>
reception of the signals. As a result, if a signal is transmitted using the continuation<br>
pilot signals and the scatter pilot signals, channel compensation can be made<br>
adaptively depending on the status of the channel received during the reception of the<br>
signal.<br>
[89]	FIG. 31 illustrates another example of an apparatus for transmitting traffic in-<br>
formation. Another example of the apparatus for transmitting traffic information will<br>
be described below with reference to FIG. 31.<br>
[90]	As another example for transmitting the above-mentioned traffic information, a<br>
DVB-H mode can be used. The DVB-H mode enlarges a broadcasting area to a mobile<br>
terminal area, and can transmit transmission information using IP datagram. The IP<br><br>
datagram refers to a signal processing mode that allows a signal to be transmitted using<br>
a packet according to Internet protocol. The IP datagram includes a header including IP<br>
address, and a data container transmitting information. Video signals, audio signals,<br>
and traffic information signals can be transmitted to the data container of the IP<br>
datagram in packet units. In other words, the DVB-H mode uses internet protocol<br>
datacasting (IP datacasting) that allows the audio signals, the video signals, and the<br>
traffic information signals to be transmitted after being divided and compressed by<br>
packet units.<br>
[91]	A signal converter 8 can convert the traffic information into data including IP by<br>
compressing the traffic information either along with the audio and video signals or<br>
separately in packet units. At this time, IP data is embedded in the MPEG-2 TS after<br>
being encapsulated by multi-protocol encapsulation (MPE). The MPE may be multi-<br>
protocol encapsulation-forward error correction (MPE-FEC) section data to which<br>
FEC is added. If a transmission signal is arranged by a form of MPE-FEC, a carrier-<br>
to-noise (CN) ratio of the transmission signal can be improved. Therefore, either MPE-<br>
FEC data having FEC or MPE data having no FEC can include transmission data in the<br>
format of IP data.<br>
[92]	The IP datagram encapsulated by the signal converter 8 using MPE may be<br>
multiplexed by a time slicing mode to reduce power consumption, and is converted<br>
into a transport stream to multiplex with MPEG-2 TS equipped with the video or audio<br>
signals. A modulating and encoding unit 50 can include configuration blocks cor-<br>
responding to reference numerals 21 to 42 of FIG. 29. The traffic information<br>
multiplexed by MPEG-2 TS can be transmitted as the broadcasting signals after<br>
undergoing modulating and encoding steps of the DVB-T broadcasting signals<br>
described with reference to FIG. 29.<br>
[93]	FIG. 32 illustrates a diagram of protocol stack in which IP datagram of the traffic<br>
information will be followd, if the traffic information is transmitted in IP datagram.<br>
The top layer of this stack signifes the service offering intended by the traffic in-<br>
formation provider. The Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is used for control of<br>
the delivery of broadcast TV and audio programs as well as for on-demand delivery.<br>
Audio streams, video streams and traffic information (A/V/Data in fig. 32) and the<br>
stream pasrsing information of the streams are multiplexed into a valid MPEG-2<br>
transport stream. The resulting MPEG-2 packets aer encapsulated in RTP. And, the en-<br>
capsulated traffic information in RTP can be transmitted along with IP (internet<br>
protocol) datagram in fig. 31<br>
[94]	FIG. 33 illustrates an example of services transmitted on a channel, wherein the one<br>
service has a type slicing mode and is transmitted to DVB-H and the other service is<br>
transmitted to a common channel of DVB-T and DVB-H. A program can be<br><br>
transmitted in accordance with a channel of each of DVB-H and DVB-T, and each<br>
service can be multiplexed by time division through time slicing in case of DVB-H.<br>
The traffic information is included in the IP datagram by DVB-H and then converted to<br>
MPE or MPE-FEC, wherein the converted MPE or MPE-FEC can be transmitted to the<br>
embedded MPEG-2 TS.<br>
[95]	FIG. 34 illustrates location of a descriptor of traffic information that can be<br>
transmitted along with stream parsing information (i. e.; DVB-SI (DVB - service in-<br>
formation or MPEG-2 TS program specific information) if the traffic information is<br>
transmitted through the encoding and modulating steps described with reference to<br>
FIG. 29 to FIG. 31. Hereinafter, stream parsing information means table information<br>
for parsing sections in broadcasting streams, for example, NIT and SDT in DVB-SI,<br>
PMT and PAT in MPEG-2 TS program specific information and so on. And, the<br>
descriptor of traffic information of traffic information in streams is called as descriptor<br>
table information.<br>
[96]	The location of the descriptor table information of the traffic information according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 34.<br>
Referring to FIG. 34, to facilitate description, descriptor table information of traffic in-<br>
formation to be transmitted will be referred to as "TPEG service descriptor."<br>
[97]	In a case that the traffic information transmitted by an embodiment of the present<br>
invention is transmitted through the broadcasting signals, stream parsing information<br>
for parsing the descriptor table information of traffic information is exemplarily shown<br>
in FIG. 34. The descriptor table information included in the broadcasting signals may<br>
be included in NIT (Network Information Table), BAT (Bouquet Association Table),<br>
SDT(Service Description Table), and EIT (Event Information Table), as shown in FIG.<br>
34. The table of FIG. 34 represents that the descriptor for parsing the signal included in<br>
the broadcasting signal is included in which table of the transmission signals, wherein<br>
* represents that the descriptor is included in the table. For example,<br>
network_name_descriptor can be transmitted along with NIT. Therefore, if NIT of the<br>
broadcasting signals is parsed, it is possible to obtain a broadcasting signal transmitted<br>
depending on description of network_narne_descriptor.<br>
[98]	The TPEG service descriptor which describes descriptor table information of the<br>
traffic information according to an embodiment of the present invention can be located<br>
in at least one of NIT, SDT, and a program map table (PMT). The NIT corresponds to<br>
stream parsing information providing tuning information and transport stream group<br>
such as channel frequency. The SDT is used to transmit parameter and service name in<br>
the transport stream. The PMT transmits packet identifier (PID) information of video,<br>
audio, data, and program clock reference (PCR). If the TPEG service descriptor is<br>
transmitted along with the PMT, the PMT can be obtained by parsing a program as-<br><br>
sociation table (PAT) from the MPEG-2 TS. In FIG. 34, 0x80 is exemplarily shown as<br>
an identifier tag value of the TPEG service descriptor.<br>
[99]	FIG. 35 and FIG. 36 respectively illustrate the PAT and the PMT as stream parsing<br>
information transmitted along with the MPEG-2 TS type signal. The PAT serves to<br>
assign a transport packet to each program using a packet having PID of 0. The PID of a<br>
packet transmitting the PMT can be obtained from the PAT (a), and the PID of the<br>
packet can be obtained from the PMT to identify information which the packet in the<br>
stream transmits (b).<br>
[100]	Therefore, if the packet having the PID obtained from the PMT is searched, video,<br>
audio and traffic information included in the packet can be obtained.<br>
[101]	FIG. 37 illustrates descriptor table information that can parse traffic information.<br>
Referring to FIG. 37, the TPEG service descriptor that can be included in the PMT (i.e.<br>
can be parsed from the PMT) can parse the broadcasting signal including the traffic in-<br>
formation as shown in FIG, 37,<br>
[102]	First, the TPEG service descriptor includes a descriptor tag (Descriptor_tag) field, a<br>
descriptor length (Descritporjength) field, a field of the number of service<br>
components (Number_of_TPEG_Service_Components) indicating the number of<br>
service components included in the traffic information descriptor, and a plurality of<br>
traffic information sets corresponding to a value of the<br>
Number_of_TPEG_Service_Components field. Each traffic information set may<br>
include a service component identifier (Service_Component_ID) field, an application<br>
identifier (Application_ID) field, and an additional service information field.<br>
[103]	The Descriptor_tag field is assigned with 8 bits and a value for identifying the<br>
descriptor table information of traffic information from another descriptor.<br>
[104]	The Descriptor_tag field is assigned with 8 bits, and a length from the<br>
Descriptor_tength field to the end of the descriptor is represented by byte units. The<br>
Service_component_ID (SCID) field is assigned with 8 bits, and indicates a value for<br>
identifying service component in one service. The SCID field value can be defined by<br>
a service provider.<br>
[105]	The ApplicationJD field is assigned with 16 bits and a value for identifying each<br>
application. In other words, each traffic information application is assigned with an ap-<br>
plication identifier (AID). Whenever a new application is defined, a new AID is<br>
assigned to the traffic information application.<br>
[106]	The additional service information field may include a service name<br>
(Service_name) field, a service description (Service_description) field, a service logo<br>
(Service_logo) field, a subscriber information (Subscriber_information) field, a free<br>
text information (Free_text_information) field, and a help information<br>
(Help_information) field. The length of each field in the additional service information<br><br>
field is variable, and is indicated by at least one format of text row, number, and<br>
graphic.<br>
[107]	The Service_name field indicates service name of the traffic information, and<br>
allows a user to identify the service. For example, the Service_name field may transmit<br>
the traffic information including service name called "traffic information service of 'A'<br>
broadcasting station."<br>
[108]	The Service_description field indicates detailed description of corresponding<br>
service, and is to describe service contents in more detail. For example, the<br>
Service..description field may transmit the traffic information including service de-<br>
scription called "contour public traffic information of the metropolitan southern area."<br>
[109]	The Service_logo field indicates service logo, and allows the user to identify service<br>
or the service provider. The service logo can be transmitted in the format of bitmap or<br>
other image.<br>
[110]	The Subscriber_inforrnation field indicates subscriber information. For example,<br>
the Subscriber_inforrnation field may transmit the traffic information including billing<br>
and payment information for a restricted service component.<br>
[111]	The Free_text_inforrnation field indicates additional information to be transmitted<br>
to the user. For example, the Free_text_information field may transmit the traffic in-<br>
formation including interruption of service and cancellation of information. The<br>
Help_information field indicates help information to be referred to by the user. For<br>
example, the Help_inforrnation field may transmit the traffic information including<br>
Internet address and phone number.<br>
[112]	FIG. 38 illustrates an example of an apparatus for receiving traffic information<br>
according to the present invention. The apparatus for receiving traffic information<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference<br>
to FIG. 38. The apparatus for receiving traffic information, as shown in FIG. 38,<br>
includes a tuner 701, a demodulator 702, a demultiplexer 703, an audio decoder 704, a<br>
video decoder 705, a data decoder 710, and a traffic information memory 711.<br>
[113]	The tuner 701 tunes a frequency of a specific channel through any one of antenna,<br>
cable and satellite, and outputs a signal down-converted into an immediate frequency<br>
(IF) signal to the demodulator 702. Examples of signals received at the frequency of<br>
the specific channel include audio signals, video signals, traffic information signals,<br>
and stream parsing information of traffic information transmiited according to DVB-<br>
T/H. A channel manager 707 requests stream parsing information of traffic information<br>
by referring to channel information stored in a channel map 708, and receives the<br>
result from the data decoder 710. The channel manager 707 can control channel tuning<br>
of the tuner 701, and may be embodied by a software module.<br>
[114]	The demodulator 702 demodulates a signal output from the tuner 701, and the de-<br><br>
multiplexer 703 divides the signals including the video signals, audio signals and the<br>
traffic information and outputs the signals in TS packet units.<br>
[115]	The demultiplexer 703 outputs TS packets including the traffic information to the<br>
data decoder 710. The data decoder 710 can decode the TS packets including<br>
descriptor table information of traffic information. In FIG. 38, it is supposed that the<br>
traffic information is to be transmitted in the form of digital storage media-command<br>
and control (DSM-CC) section of payload of the TS packets.<br>
[116] For example, the data decoder 710 can parse the descriptor table information of<br>
traffic information included in the PMT. The data decoder 710 parses the traffic in-<br>
formation from the DSM-CC (Digital Storage Media Command and Control) section<br>
including the traffic information and stores the parsed information in the traffic in-<br>
formation memory 711. The data decoder 710 forms a section table information by<br>
collecting sections having the same table identifier (table_id). The data decoder 710<br>
can store the descriptor table information of traffic information and the traffic in-<br>
formation message in the traffic information memory 711. If the data decoder 710<br>
parses the descriptor of traffic information (e.g. TPEG-Service descriptor) from the<br>
stream parsing information, application identification information of the traffic in-<br>
formation message transmitted to a corresponding channel, service component iden-<br>
tification information, and additional service information (for example, service name,<br>
service description, service logo, subscriber information, free text information, and<br>
help information) can be obtained.<br>
[117]	A first application manager 706 shown in FIG. 38 drives a native application<br>
program stored in a memory 709 to execute a general function such as channel<br>
conversion. In this case, the native application program means built-in type software<br>
built in the apparatus for receiving traffic information at the time when the apparatus is<br>
manufactured. If there is a user request to the apparatus for receiving traffic in-<br>
formation through a user interface (UI), the first application manager 706 responds to<br>
the user request by displaying the native application program using a graphic user<br>
interface (GUI) on a screen. The user interface receives the user request through an<br>
input device such as a remote controller, a jog dial, and a touch screen on the screen,<br>
and outputs the user request to the first application manager 706, a data broadcasting<br>
application manager 713 and the like. The first application manager 706 manages<br>
channel related operation, for example the first application manager 706 manages the<br>
channel map 708 by controlling the channel manager 707, and controls the data<br>
decoder 710. Also, the first application manager 706 stores and restores the status of<br>
the receiving system, the user request and the GUI control of the overall receiving<br>
system in the memory 709.<br>
[118]	If the data service is requested from the user interface, the data broadcasting ap-<br><br>
plication manager 713 drives the corresponding application program stored in the<br>
memory 709 to process the requested data and provides the data service to the user. For<br>
the data service, the data broadcasting application manager 713 supports the GUI. In<br>
this case, the data service is provided in the form of text, voice, graphic, still images,<br>
and moving images.<br>
[119]	The data broadcasting application manager 713 may be software or hardware<br>
platform for executing the application program stored in the memory 709. In this case,<br>
the platform may be, for example, a Java virtual machine for executing Java program.<br>
The data broadcasting application manager 713 executes the traffic information ap-<br>
plication program stored in the memory 709 to process the traffic information message<br>
stored in the traffic information memory 711 and provides the traffic information<br>
service.<br>
[120]	In the embodiment of the present invention, the traffic information service can be<br>
provided from an apparatus having no either of an electronic map and GPS (global po-<br>
sitioning system) or both of them to the users through at least one of text, voice,<br>
graphic, still images and moving images. If a GPS module 714 is provided in the<br>
apparatus shown in FIG. 37, the GPS module 714 receives satellite signals transmitted<br>
from a plurality of low orbit satellites and extracts current location information (e.g.,<br>
latitude, longitude, and altitude) so as to output current location information to the data<br>
broadcasting application manager 713. In this case, the electronic map and various<br>
kinds of graphic information including information of each link and node of road may<br>
be stored in the traffic information memory 711, the memory 709, or other memory<br>
(not shown). The data broadcasting application manager 713 can provide the traffic in-<br>
formation service requested by the user based on the current location obtained through<br>
the GPS module 714 and the traffic information message stored in the traffic in-<br>
formation memory 711 by executing the traffic information application program.<br>
[121]	The traffic information message stored in the traffic information memory 711 is<br>
read out and input to the data broadcasting application manager 713 in accordance with<br>
the request of the data broadcasting application manager 713. The data broadcasting<br>
application manager 713 can analyze the traffic information message read out from the<br>
traffic information memory 711 to extract control signals and/or required information<br>
according to the message. To facilitate description, it is supposed that the user requests<br>
the service of the congestion traffic status.<br>
[122]	The data broadcasting application manager 713 extracts message identification in-<br>
formation, message occurrence time and message transmission time in the message<br>
management container 102 of the traffic information message and identifies from the<br>
message identification information whether a following container is the CTT-status<br>
container. In this case, message identifier and version number are included in the<br><br>
'message component' information. The message identifier and version number may be<br>
included in every message and are used to manage the traffic information message of<br>
the data broadcasting application manager 713.<br>
[123]	If the following container is the CTT-status container 104, information from the<br>
CTT component in the CTT status container 104 is obtained so as to execute the<br>
display operation according to traffic status information and prediction information of<br>
the traffic status. Also, location information corresponding to the current traffic in-<br>
formation is obtained from the following location container 106.<br>
[124]	In this case, the location information corresponds to location coordinates (latitude<br>
and longitude) of start and end points depending on location types or link ID assigned<br>
to link. A link corresponding to received information is specified according to in-<br>
formation of each link and node stored in the traffic information memory 711 if<br>
necessary. Also, location coordinates of the received link may be used as link ID or<br>
inversely, the link ID may be used as the location coordinates. According to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, if the location type information is link ID and the<br>
location information is text information such as road name related to link ID or link, a<br>
link corresponding to the received traffic status information can be specified in<br>
accordance with information of the corresponding link. Otherwise, if the location in-<br>
formation is link ID or is a code having a defined link ID, a link corresponding to the<br>
received traffic status information can be specified in accordance with the link system<br>
stored in the traffic information memory 711.<br>
[125]	Meanwhile, the data broadcasting application manager 713 reads out an electronic<br>
map from the traffic information memory 711 around current location coordinates<br>
received from the GPS module 714 and displays the read electronic map on the screen.<br>
In this case, a specific graphic symbol may be displayed on a point corresponding to<br>
the current location. The data broadcasting application manager 713 allows the average<br>
link speed information received through the traffic information message to be<br>
displayed on the link corresponding to link ID or the location coordinates. In this case,<br>
color may be displayed on the average link speed (for example, in general road, red<br>
color represents speed per hour of 0-10km, orange color 10-20km, green color<br>
20-40km, and blue color 40km or more). Alternatively, the average link speed may be<br>
displayed on a corresponding link as a number. If the congestion change information<br>
extracted from the traffic information message has a value of 1 or 2, text row ('increase<br>
or decrease') or an icon assigned to the value may be displayed on the corresponding<br>
link together. If the congestion change information extracted from the traffic in-<br>
formation message has a value of 0 or 3, the displayed status is maintained without<br>
being updated. If the congestion change information is a change rate of the average<br>
link speed, the average link speed may be displayed on the screen in accordance with a<br><br>
request from the user. This is to reduce visual confusion of a driver due to the display.<br>
An established traveling route or front route may be displayed within the limits of<br>
possible.<br>
[126]	If there is no traffic information memory 711 or other memory having an electronic<br>
map in the apparatus for receiving traffic information, the average link speed is<br>
displayed for only link at the front of the current traveling route as color or number. If<br>
a traveling route is set in a vehicle provided with the apparatus for receiving traffic in-<br>
formation, the average link speed may be displayed for links included in the traveling<br>
route not the links at the front.<br>
[127]	Furthermore, if information added to the traffic information message is information<br>
of a famous restaurant or a theater in a specific link, the data broadcasting application<br>
manager 713 may allow the information to be displayed to identify a corresponding<br>
place on a link displayed on the screen and may allow the corresponding information<br>
to be displayed on the screen as text.<br>
[128]	The data broadcasting application manager 713 may allow the information of link<br>
travel time, link delay, and congestion type extracted from the traffic information<br>
message to be displayed on the screen together with or instead of the average link<br>
speed in accordance with the request of the user. If the user designates prediction time<br>
to request prediction information of the traffic status of the road, the data broadcasting<br>
application manager 713 may display average speed prediction of each link received in<br>
the traffic information message as color or number instead of the current average<br>
speed. If the user requests a prediction travel time mode as a display mode instead of<br>
the average prediction speed, the data broadcasting application manager 713 displays<br>
the prediction travel time information of each link on the electronic map or graphic<br>
screen.<br>
[129]	If a route automatic search function of a destination is set in the apparatus for<br>
receiving traffic information shown in FIG. 38, a desirable route can be searched or re-<br>
searched based on the received average link speed prediction or the link travel time<br>
prediction. For example, for each link following a node to be arrived after 30 minutes<br>
at the current traveling speed, a link corresponding to the shortest time to the<br>
destination set using the average prediction speed or link prediction pass time after 30<br>
minutes may be selected as a traveling route and displayed on the screen. If the<br>
apparatus for receiving traffic information shown in FIG. 38 includes an audio output<br>
means, the traffic status information or the traffic status prediction information may be<br>
output to the designated link through audio.<br>
[130]	The information and/or control signal extracted from the traffic information<br>
message may be used in the data broadcasting application manager 713 after being<br>
temporarily stored in a nonvolatile memory (not shown) such as a writable RAM. The<br><br>
data broadcasting application manager 713 stores information within a predetennined<br>
time, for example, information within last one hour, i.e., average speed or link pass<br>
time per 20 minutes (fixed hour, fixed hour:20 minutes, and fixed hour:40 minutes)<br>
without removing information of the nonvolatile memory after using the information<br>
of the nonvolatile memory. A memory interval storing the last hour may be increased<br>
or may be shortened depending on memory capacity. If the average speed provided for<br>
each link is stored and the user selects a specific link, the data broadcasting application<br>
manager 713 displays average speed history, link pass time history, average link<br>
prediction speed, or prediction link pass time, which is stored for the link, on the<br>
screen in the form of graph. In this case, a numeral value displayed in the graph<br>
includes km/h corresponding to speed information, and name of the current link, for<br>
example, road name is displayed on the top of the graph.<br>
[131]	The name of the link according to an embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
link ID or road name, and is recorded in the link component or the location coordinate<br>
component included in the above-mentioned location container. Alternatively, the<br>
name of the link is included in the electronic map inside the second memory 711. In<br>
addition, the current and previous traffic information and prediction information may<br>
be displayed by various methods.<br>
[132]	FIG. 39 is a flow chart illustrating a method for receiving traffic information<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method for receiving traffic<br>
information according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
below with reference to FIG. 39. In FIG. 39, an example of receiving the traffic in-<br>
formation from the broadcasting signals if the traffic information is included in DVB-<br>
T/H will be described.<br>
[133]	In a state that the apparatus for receiving traffic information is turned on (step 721),<br>
if channel selection or channel change is input (step 722), the channel is tuned at a<br>
physical frequency corresponding to the selected or changed channel by using a<br>
channel map (step 723).<br>
[134]	The broadcasting signal data can be received at the frequency of the tuned channel,<br>
wherein the traffic information message and stream parsing information of the traffic<br>
information according to the DVB-T/H broadcasting signals are multiplexed. The de-<br>
multiplexer 703 can demultiplex the traffic information message using the stream<br>
parsing information, for example PAT (program association table)/PMT (program map<br>
table) which is program information of MPEG-2 TS, PID detection and section<br>
filtering (step 725).<br>
[135]	If descriptor parsing information of the traffic information which is parsed from the<br>
stream parsing information, is parsed, application ID and service component ID, which<br>
are related to the traffic information, can be obtained. If the stream parsing information<br><br>
is parsed, ES type and ES PID (elementary stream packet identifier) are obtained.<br>
[136]	Information of a virtual channel, are extracted from the stream parsing information<br>
of traffic information by refering to the stream type (ES type) and PID of stream<br>
packet(step 726). In this case, if A/V ES (elementary stream) for broadcasting output<br>
exists in the virtual channel (step 727), A/V PID of the corresponding virtual channel<br>
(VCH) of the channel map is set (step 728) so that A/V demultiplexing and decoding<br>
are executed (step 729). The user can view broadcasting corresponding to the A/V<br>
(step 730).<br>
[137]	Meanwhile, if the A/V ES for broadcasting output does not exist in the virtual<br>
channel in the step 727, it is checked whether the traffic information data is transmitted<br>
to the virtual channel (step 731). The presence of the traffic information data can be<br>
obtained from application ID, and service component ID, which are related to the<br>
traffic information, if the descriptor table information of traffic information is parsed.<br>
Supposing that the traffic information data is transmitted to the DSM-CC section, all<br>
the traffic information data corresponding to DSM-CC data format are received using<br>
PID of ES obtained from the PMT (step 732), and the user s desired traffic information<br>
service is provided (step 733).<br>
[138] If it is checked that neither A/V ES nor traffic information data exist in the virtual<br>
channel in the step 731, it is determined that the virtual channel is an invalid channel.<br>
In this case, a message indicating that a valid channel or signal does not exist may be<br>
displayed on a screen (step 736). The current step returns to the step 724 to newly<br>
receive a valid program information table.<br>
[139]	Meanwhile, it is checked whether channel change is requested during data service<br>
or broadcasting viewing (step 734). If channel change is requested and the requested<br>
channel change is virtual channel change, the data broadcasting work is reset, and the<br>
current step returns to the step 726 to search new virtual channel information. Also, if<br>
the requested channel change is physical channel change, the current step returns to the<br>
step 723 to tune the corresponding physical channel.<br>
[140]	If no channel change is requested, it is checked whether the streaming table in-<br>
formation version such as PAT and PMT is updated (step 735). If it is checked that the<br>
streaming table information version is updated in the step 735, it means that channel<br>
information from the broadcasting station has been changed. Therefore, the current<br>
step returns to the step 724 to receive the channel information table again. If it is<br>
checked that there is no channel information change in the step 735, the user can<br>
continue to view broadcasting.<br>
[141]	FIG. 40 is a flow chart illustrating a method for transmitting and receiving traffic<br>
information according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[142]	First, in cast of transmitting traffic information, traffic information, audio signals,<br><br>
video signals, and streaming table information are multiplexed into broadcasting<br>
transport signals (S910).<br>
[143]	The multiplexed signals are encoded and interleaved for error correction in a<br>
receiver (S915).<br>
[144]	The signals are respectively mapped in one frame in consideration of scatter pilot<br>
signals varied depending on time and continuation pilot signals fixed depending on<br>
time (S920).<br>
[145]	The mapped signals are modulated by an orthogonal frequency division mul-<br>
tiplexing (OFDM) scheme. And a guard interval which is a part of the modulated<br>
signals is inserted (S925).<br>
[146]	The modulated signals are converted RF signals and the RF signals are transmitted<br>
(S930).<br>
[147]	In case of receiving the traffic information, broadcast signals, in which traffic in-<br>
formation and the descriptor table information of the traffic information are<br>
multiplexed, are received (S935).<br>
[148]	The broadcasting signals are demodulated in consideration of scatter pilot signals<br>
varied depending on time and continuation pilot signals fixed depending on time<br>
within a frame of the received broadcasting signals (S940).<br>
[149]	The demodulated signals are demultiplexed to obtain data broadcasting transport<br>
streams (S945).<br>
[150]	The traffic information is parsed from descriptor table information in the data<br>
broadcasting transport streams (S950).<br>
[151]	The traffic information is outputted from traffic service application (S955).<br>
[152]	According to the present invention, various kinds of traffic information can be<br>
transmitted using the broadcasting signals in the format of DVB-H or DVB-T. In<br>
particular, the congestion and travel time information can be transmitted using DVB-H<br>
or DVB-T. In the method and apparatus for receiving traffic information according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the traffic information can efficiently be<br>

bodiments of the present invention, the congestion and travel time information of the<br>
