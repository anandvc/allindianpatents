CLOSED-CELL FOAMED RUBBER SHEET, AND METHOD FOR PRODUCTION<br>
THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet, which is suitably used as a seal material<br>
having excellent water resistance and closely adhering to a<br>
sealed portion for a long time, and a method for producing<br>
the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Foamed materials are currently used as seal materials<br>
in various fields such as civil engineering, architecture,<br>
electrics, electronics, and vehicles. Examples of the<br>
foamed materials used as such seal materials include<br>
thermoplastic resin foams comprising resins such as<br>
polyethylene-based resins and polypropylene-based resins,<br>
and rubber foams comprising rubbers such as synthetic and<br>
natural rubbers.<br>
Of the seal materials, water-resistant seal materials<br>
are used for filling clearances of various structures such<br>
as buildings, electric devices, and vehicles to prevent<br>
water infiltration into the structures. The water-<br>
resistant seal material is placed at a portion to be sealed<br>
in its compressed state, and repulsion force generated by<br>
shape recovery from its compressed state allows the seal<br>
material to closely adhere to the interface of the sealed<br>
portion without a clearance.<br>
In the case where the water-resistant seal material<br>
has low flexibility against compression, the water-<br>
resistant seal material generates too high repulsion force,<br>
resulting in deformation of the sealed portion. The<br>
deformation of the sealed portion causes expansion of the<br>
clearance of the structure. This results in decrease in<br>
adherence (hereinafter, referred to as sealability) of the<br>
water-resistant seal material to the sealed portion,<br>
thereby causing insufficient water resistance.<br>
Accordingly, open-cell foamed materials are used as<br>
the water-resistant seal materials as the open-cell foamed<br>
materials have excellent flexibility against compression.<br>
On the other hand, the open-cell foamed material contains<br>
cells communicating with one another. This causes easy<br>
infiltration of water into the foamed material, resulting<br>
in poor water resistance. In the case where the open-cell<br>
foamed material absorbs water to swell and thereby achieves<br>
higher sealability, the open-cell foamed material has poor<br>
sealability until it sufficiently absorbs water, and thus,<br>
the open-cell foamed material allows water to infiltrate<br>
therein before achieving sufficient sealability.<br>
Foamed materials having both closed cells and open<br>
cells are also used as the water-resistant seal materials.<br>
In such foamed materials, the closed cells contribute to<br>
good water resistance, and the open cells contribute to<br>
good flexibility against compression. For example, Patent<br>
Document 1 discloses a shaped seal material which comprises<br>
a foamed structure. The foamed structure contains both<br>
closed cells and open cells, and cell membranes absorb<br>
water to swell. The shaped seal material contains eight or<br>
more cells per 1 cm in length.<br>
Disadvantageously, the repulsion force of the shaped<br>
seal material deteriorates when the shaped seal material is<br>
used for a long time. This causes reduction in sealability<br>
and results in insufficient water resistance.<br>
Foamed materials used as water-resistant seal<br>
materials generally contain additives such as flame<br>
retardants, antioxidants, and pigments for improving their<br>
properties such as flame-retardant properties and weather<br>
resistance, for preventing oxidation and thermal<br>
degradation, and for coloring. Almost all of these<br>
additives are in a powder state, and the foamed material<br>
containing powdery additives generates heavy load upon<br>
kneading in the production. This causes poor productivity.<br>
In the case where the foamed material contains the<br>
powdery additives, the powdery additives emerge on the<br>
surface of the material. This causes reduction in<br>
sealability and results in insufficient water resistance.<br>

111899 (JP-A H09-111899)<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet used as a seal material whose sealability is<br>
less likely to decrease even after long-time use and which<br>
closely adheres to a sealed portion for a long time. The<br>
present invention also provides a method for producing the<br>
same.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the present<br>
invention contains a rubber-based resin. This closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet is obtained by the steps of: providing<br>
a foamable resin composition containing the rubber-based<br>
resin and a foaming agent; irradiating the foamable resin<br>
composition with ionizing radiation to cross-link the<br>
foamable resin composition; and foaming the cross-linked<br>
foamable resin composition.<br>
The rubber-based resin contained in the foamable<br>
resin composition is one having rubber elasticity at room<br>
temperature, and any rubber-based resin having rubber<br>
elasticity at room temperature may be used. Examples<br>
thereof include acrylonitrile-based rubbers such as<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), hydrogenated<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (HNBR), carboxylated<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (XNBR), acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene-isoprene rubber (NBIR), acrylonitrile-isoprene<br>
rubber (NIR), and a terpolymer of acrylonitrile, butadiene,<br>
and a functional monomer having effects such as an<br>
antiaging effect; chloroprene rubber (CR); isoprene rubber<br>
(IR); butyl rubber (IIR); natural rubber; styrene-butadiene<br>
rubber (SBR); butadiene rubber (BR); urethane rubber,-<br>
fluorine rubber; acryl rubber; and silicone rubber. In<br>
particular, acrylonitrile-based rubbers are preferable as<br>
they can provide a closed-cell foamed rubber sheet having<br>
excellent sealability, flexibility against compression,<br>
durability, and oil resistance. More preferably used is<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR). The rubber-based<br>
resins having rubber elasticity at room temperature may be<br>
used alone, or two or more of these may be used in<br>
combination.<br>
In the case where the foamable resin composition<br>
contains 0.5 parts by weight or more, preferably 1 part by<br>
weight or more, of the below-mentioned powdery additive<br>
other than the foaming agent per 100 parts by weight of the<br>
rubber-based resin, the rubber-based resin preferably<br>
contains a rubber-based resin ingredient which is in a<br>
liquid state at normal temperature (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as a liquid rubber-based resin ingredient). The<br>
foamable resin composition containing the liquid rubber-<br>
based resin ingredient can reduce kneading load of the<br>
foamable resin composition, and it can also be likely to<br>
prevent the powdery additive from emerging on the surface<br>
of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet to be provided.<br>
Particularly in the case where the rubber-based resin<br>
is an acrylonitrile-based rubber and the liquid rubber-<br>
based resin ingredient is a liquid acrylonitrile-based<br>
rubber, they are excellently compatible with each other.<br>
Thus, the liquid acrylonitrile-based rubber is uniformly<br>
dispersed in the acrylonitrile-based rubber without phase<br>
separation. Here, the liquid acrylonitrile-based rubber<br>
serves as a dispersant; that is to say, the liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-based rubber covers the particles of the<br>
powdery additive and uniformly disperses the covered<br>
particles of the powdery additive in the acrylonitrile-<br>
based rubber. Thus, the liquid acrylonitrile-based rubber<br>
prevents the powdery additive from emerging on the surface<br>
of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet. In other words,<br>
the particles of the powdery additive are covered with the<br>
liquid acrylonitrile-based rubber, and thereby the powdery<br>
additive is surely prevented from emerging on the closed-<br>
cell foamed rubber sheet.<br>
Accordingly, in the case where the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet containing the acrylonitrile-based rubber<br>
further contains the powdery additive and the liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-based rubber, the liquid acrylonitrile-based<br>
rubber contributes to excellent surface smoothness of the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet. Such a closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet has excellent water resistance.<br>
The liquid rubber-based resin ingredient is a rubber-<br>
based resin having liquidity at 23°C and l.OlxlO5 Pa (1<br>
atm). Examples thereof include: liquid acrylonitrile-based<br>
rubbers such as liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber<br>
(liquid NBR), hydrogenated liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene<br>
rubber (liquid HNBR), carboxylated liquid acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene rubber (liquid XNBR), liquid acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene-isoprene rubber (liquid NBIR), liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-isoprene rubber (liquid NIR), and a liquid<br>
terpolymer of acrylonitrile, butadiene, and a functional<br>
monomer having effects such as an antiaging effect; and<br>
liquid isoprene rubber (liquid IR). In particular, liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-based rubbers are preferable as they can<br>
provide a closed-cell foamed rubber sheet having excellent<br>
sealability, flexibility against compression, durability,<br>
and oil resistance. More preferably used is liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (liquid NBR). The liquid<br>
rubber-based resin ingredients may be used alone, or two or<br>
more of these may be used in combination.<br>
Liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (liquid NBR) is<br>
commercially available from, for example, ZEON Corporation<br>
under the trade name of NiPol 1312.<br>
The amount of the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient in the rubber-based resin is preferably 0.5 to<br>
50% by weight, more preferably 1 to 3 0% by weight,<br>
particularly preferably 5 to 30% by weight, and most<br>
preferably 8 to 30% by weight. If the rubber-based resin<br>
contains a smaller amount of the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient, the particles of the powdery additive may be<br>
insufficiently covered with the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient, or the particles of the powdery additive may be<br>
insufficiently dispersed in the rubber-based resin by the<br>
liquid rubber-based resin ingredient. Thus, the powdery<br>
additive may be likely to emerge on the surface of the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet to be provided, and the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet to be provided may have<br>
poor water resistance. If the rubber-based resin contains<br>
a larger amount of the liquid rubber-based resin ingredient,<br>
the foamable resin composition may have a low average<br>
molecular weight, and thus, the foamable resin composition<br>
may insufficiently cross-links or foams, or the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet to be provided may have poor mechanical<br>
strength.<br>
The foaming agent contained in the foamable resin<br>
composition may be any powder as long as it is decomposed<br>
by heat to generate foaming gas. Examples thereof include<br>
azodicarbonamide, benzenesulfonyl hydrazide,<br>
dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine, toluenesulfonyl hydrazide,<br>
and 4,4-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide). In particular,<br>
azodicarbonamide is preferably used. These foaming agents<br>
may be used alone, or two or more of these may be used in<br>
combination.<br>
If the foamable resin composition contains a smaller<br>
amount of the foaming agent, the foamable resin composition<br>
may insufficiently foam and a closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet may not be produced in a predetermined shape. If the<br>
foamable resin composition contains a larger amount of the<br>
foaming agent, abnormal foaming or foam breaking may occur<br>
and a predetermined closed-cell foamed rubber sheet may not<br>
be provided. Thus, the amount of the foaming agent in the<br>
foamable resin composition is preferably 1 to 3 0 parts by<br>
weight per 100 parts by weight of the rubber-based resin.<br>
The foamable resin composition may further contain<br>
the powdery additive other than the foaming agent for<br>
enhancing functions of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
to be provided. Any powdery additive may be used as long<br>
as it is in a powder state at 23°C and l.OlxlO5 Pa (1 atm) .<br>
Examples thereof include a flame retardant, an antioxidant,<br>
a filler, a pigment, a coloring agent, an antifungal agent,<br>
a foaming assistant, and a flame retardant assistant.<br>
Any powdery flame retardant may be used. Examples<br>
thereof include metal hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxide<br>
and magnesium hydroxide, bromine-based flame retardants<br>
such as decabromodiphenyl ether, and phosphorous-based<br>
flame retardants such as ammonium polyphosphate. These<br>
flame retardants may be used alone, or two or more of these<br>
may be used in combination. The powdery flame retardant is<br>
commercially available from Albemarle Corporation under the<br>
trade name of SAYTEX 8 010.<br>
Any powdery antioxidant may be used. Examples<br>
thereof include phenol-based antioxidants and sulfur-based<br>
antioxidants. Concretely, the phenol-based antioxidant is<br>
commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemical<br>
Corporation under the trade name of IRGANOX 1010. These<br>
powdery antioxidants may be used alone, or two or more of<br>
these may be used in combination.<br>
Any powdery filler may be used as long as it can be<br>
dispersed in the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet. Examples<br>
thereof include talc, calcium carbonate, bentonite, carbon<br>
black, fumed silica, aluminum silicate, acetylene black,<br>
and aluminum powder. These fillers may be used alone, or<br>
two or more of these may be used in combination.<br>
The filler may be in various sizes depending on its<br>
use. A powdery filler used in a seal material may<br>
generally have a volume average particle size of 0.1 to 100<br>
µm. The volume average particle size may be measured by<br>
the method in accordance with JIS Z 8901.<br>
If the foamable resin composition contains a larger<br>
total amount of the powdery additives other than the<br>
foaming agent, the foamable resin composition may generate<br>
heavy kneading load, and thereby the productivity of the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet may be low. In other cases,<br>
the particles of the powdery additives may be<br>
insufficiently covered with the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient, and thereby the powdery additives may be likely<br>
to emerge on the surface of the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet to be provided and the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet may have poor water resistance. If the foamable<br>
resin composition contains a smaller total amount of the<br>
powdery additives other than the foaming agent, performance<br>
of the foamable resin composition may not be improved.<br>
Thus, the total amount of the powdery additives other than<br>
the foaming agent in the foamable resin composition is<br>
preferably 150 parts by weight or less per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the rubber-based resin. It is preferably 1 to<br>
100 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 50 parts by<br>
weight, further preferably 1 to 2 0 parts by weight,<br>
particularly preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight, and most<br>
preferably 1 to 5 parts by weight per 10 0 parts by weight<br>
of the rubber-based resin. In the case where the foamable<br>
resin composition contains no flame retardant, the total<br>
amount of the powdery additives other than the foaming<br>
agent in the foamable resin composition is preferably 0.5<br>
to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.5 to 5 parts<br>
by weight per 100 parts by weight of the rubber-based resin.<br>
The foamable resin composition may further contain a<br>
liquid additive.<br>
In the case where the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
of the present invention contains an acrylonitrile-based<br>
rubber as the rubber-based resin, a liquid acrylonitrile-<br>
based rubber as the liquid rubber-based resin ingredient,<br>
and the powdery additive, it has excellent flexibility<br>
against compression and excellent resistance against shear<br>
stress applied in the surface direction of the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet. The closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
surely fills a clearance of a structure without deformation<br>
at a sealed portion in the thickness direction of the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet. The closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet is hardly deformed even in the case of<br>
application of shear stress in the surface direction during<br>
the use thereof, and it also surely fills the clearance of<br>
the structure in the surface direction (direction<br>
perpendicular to the thickness direction) of the closed-<br>
cell foamed rubber sheet. Thus, the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet surely fills the clearance of the structure in<br>
all of the directions and exerts excellent water resistance<br>
for a long time.<br>
In the case where the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
of the present invention contains an acrylonitrile-based<br>
rubber as the rubber-based resin and a liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-based rubber as the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient, the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is likely<br>
to follow irregularities on the sealed portion. Thus, the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet firmly adheres to the<br>
surface with irregularities on the sealed portion without a<br>
clearance. Even when stress is applied to the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet such that the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet is misaligned relative to the position of the sealed<br>
portion, adherence of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
can minimize a degree of misalignment of the relative<br>
position between the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet and<br>
the sealed portion. Thus, the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet can exert excellent water resistance for a long time.<br>
In the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the present<br>
invention, not all of the foams must be closed cells, but<br>
part of the cells may be open cells. If the closed cell<br>
ratio is lower, cells in the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet may communicate with one another and water may be<br>
likely to pass therethrough, resulting in poor water<br>
resistance of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet. Thus,<br>
in the concrete, the closed cell ratio in the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet is preferably 80 to 100%, and more<br>
preferably 85 to 100%.<br>
The closed cell ratio in the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet is determined as follows. First, a 5-cm flat<br>
square-shaped test piece having a constant thickness is cut<br>
out from the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet. Then, the<br>
weight W1 and the thickness of the test piece are measured<br>
to determine the apparent volume V1 of the test piece.<br>
Next, the value obtained above is substituted in the<br>
following formula (1) to determine the apparent volume V2<br>
of the cells. Here, the density of the resin forming the<br>
test piece is represented as ? g/cm3.<br>
Apparent volume V2 of the cells = V1 - W1/?<br>
Formula (1)<br>
The test piece is immersed in distilled water such<br>
that the distance between the upper surface of the test<br>
piece and the surface of the water is to be 100 mm. Then,<br>
the test piece is pressurized at 15 kPa for 3 minutes. The<br>
test piece is taken out from the distilled water, and water<br>
on the surface of the test piece is removed. The weight W2<br>
of the test piece was measured, and the open cell ratio F1<br>
is determined according to the following formula (2). Then,<br>
the closed cell ratio F2 is determined from the open cell<br>
ratio F1.<br>
Open cell ratio F1 (%) = 100 x (W2-W1)/V2 ... Formula<br>
(2)<br>
Closed cell ratio F2 (%) = 100-F1 ... Formula (3)<br>
If peel strength immediately after the production<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as initial peel strength) of the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is lower, sealability of<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet may be poor. Thus, the<br>
initial peel strength is preferably 20 kPa or higher. On<br>
the other hand, higher initial peel strength may cause<br>
difficulty in peeling of the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet in the case of re-sticking due to, for example, a<br>
failure in sticking. Thus, the initial peel strength is<br>
more preferably 20 to 100 kPa.<br>
The initial peel strength of the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet is determined as follows. First, a just-<br>
produced closed-cell foamed rubber sheet having a size of<br>
25 mm in width x 12.5 mm in length x 3.0 mm in thickness is<br>
prepared. Next, the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is<br>
sandwiched between two acryl resin plates (25 mm in width x<br>
10 0 mm in length) to provide a laminated body. Then, the<br>
laminated body is placed on a horizontal plane and is<br>
pressurized in the thickness direction for 15 minutes by a<br>
500-g weight placed on the center portion of the upper<br>
surface of the laminated body to provide a sample. Here,<br>
the sample comprises the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
and the acryl resin plates integrally laminated on both of<br>
the surfaces of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet.<br>
Finally, peel strength of the just-produced sample is<br>
measured at a pulling speed of 50 mm/m in accordance with<br>
JIS K6850.<br>
The thickness of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
is preferably 0.2 to 10 mm, more preferably 0.5 to 8 mm,<br>
and particularly preferably 1 to 6 mm. If the thickness of<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is thinner than 0.2 mm,<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet may exert poor<br>
flexibility against compression. The upper limit of the<br>
thickness of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is not<br>
particularly restricted. It is preferably 10 mm or thinner<br>
for easy handleability of the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet.<br>
The following will describe the method for producing<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the present<br>
invention. The closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the<br>
present invention may be produced by any method as long as<br>
the method comprises the steps of: providing the foamable<br>
resin composition; irradiating the foamable resin<br>
composition with ionizing radiation to cross-link the<br>
foamable resin composition; and foaming the cross-linked<br>
foamable resin composition. For example, the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet may be produced by: kneading the<br>
foamable resin composition with a kneader such as a Banbury<br>
mixer or a pressure kneader; continuously kneading the<br>
foamable resin composition with an apparatus such as an<br>
extruder, a calender apparatus, or a conveyer belt casting<br>
apparatus to provide a foamable sheet; irradiating the<br>
foamable sheet with ionizing radiation to cross-link the<br>
foamable sheet; and heating the cross-linked foamable sheet<br>
to foam the foamable sheet.<br>
The foamable sheet is required to be cross-linked by<br>
irradiation of ionizing radiation. The cross-linking by<br>
ionizing radiation makes it possible to uniformly irradiate<br>
the foamable sheet with ionizing radiation in the thickness<br>
direction, thereby uniformly cross-linking the foamable<br>
sheet on the whole.<br>
The thickness of the foamable sheet is required to be<br>
0.1 to 3 mm in order to provide the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet with a thickness of 0.2 to 10 mm. For<br>
providing the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet with an<br>
accurately-controlled thickness by foaming such a thin<br>
foamable sheet, the foamable sheet is required to be<br>
uniformly cross-linked on the whole at very high accuracy<br>
and then to be foamed. Thus, the foamable sheet is cross-<br>
linked by irradiation of ionizing radiation in the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the conventional vulcanization with disulfide, it<br>
is difficult to control cross-linking reaction of the<br>
foamable sheet and the foamable sheet is not always cross-<br>
linked uniformly on the whole. Thus, the foamable sheet is<br>
not uniformly foamed and a closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
has a poorly-controlled thickness and has poor water<br>
resistance.<br>
The surface of the foamable sheet is directly<br>
irradiated with ionizing radiation, and thus, the degree of<br>
cross-linking of the rubber-based resin at the surface of<br>
the foamable sheet is higher than that at the inside of the<br>
foamable sheet. Control of the dose of ionizing radiation<br>
makes it possible to control the degree of cross-linking of<br>
the rubber-based resin at the surface of the foamable sheet.<br>
Control of the dose of ionizing radiation can optimize the<br>
degree of cross-linking at the surface of the foamable<br>
sheet and makes the surface of the foamable sheet smooth.<br>
This allows the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet to have a<br>
smooth surface, and thus, the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet is likely to adhere to a sealed portion without a<br>
clearance.<br>
When the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet adheres to<br>
the sealed portion without a clearance, a sheet-shaped seal<br>
material (the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet) closely<br>
adheres to the sealed portion owing to atmospheric pressure.<br>
Thus, the seal material (the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet) can favorably adhere to the sealed portion for a<br>
long time without adhesive.<br>
Then, the uniformly cross-linked foamable sheet is<br>
foamed to provide a closed-cell foamed rubber sheet which<br>
contains uniform, small-sized foams. Such a closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet containing uniform and small-sized<br>
foams has a smooth surface and has enhanced adhesiveness<br>
owing to a larger contact area with the sealed portion.<br>
Thus, the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet has high<br>
sealability and excellent water resistance.<br>
The uniformly cross-linked foamable sheet is<br>
uniformly foamed on the whole. As a result, the closed-<br>
cell foamed rubber sheet to be provided has an accurately-<br>
controlled thickness.<br>
The dose of ionizing radiation upon the cross-linking<br>
may be adjusted depending on characteristics of the rubber-<br>
based resin and use of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet.<br>
The dose is preferably 0.5 to 10 Mrad, and more preferably<br>
0.7 to 5.0 Mrad.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the present<br>
invention is produced by cross-linking the foamable resin<br>
composition containing the rubber-based resin and foaming<br>
the cross-linked foamable resin composition. When used as<br>
a water-resistant seal material, the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet with a smooth surface adheres along the<br>
surface of the sealed portion without a clearance in either<br>
case where the sealed portion has a smooth surface or a<br>
rough surface. Thus, the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
has high sealability and excellent water resistance, and is<br>
suitably used as a water-resistant seal material which<br>
closely adheres to a sealed portion for a long time.<br>
As the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the present<br>
invention has the aforementioned features, the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet has excellent flexibility against<br>
compression. When used as a water-resistant seal material,<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet does not cause<br>
deformation of the sealed portion due to repulsion force.<br>
Thus, the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet has excellent<br>
water resistance.<br>
In the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet of the present<br>
invention, the foamable resin composition is irradiated<br>
with ionizing radiation, and thereby is cross-linked. Thus,<br>
the foamable resin composition is uniformly cross-linked on<br>
the whole. In addition, the degree of cross-linking of the<br>
foamable resin composition is controlled by fine adjustment<br>
of the dose of ionizing radiation applied to the foamable<br>
resin composition, while maintaining the surface smoothness<br>
of the foamable resin composition. Thus, the surface of<br>
the cross-linked foamable resin composition is made smooth.<br>
The uniformly cross-linked foamable resin composition<br>
is uniformly foamed on the whole. Thus, the closed-cell<br>
foamed rubber sheet of the present invention has an<br>
accurately-controlled thickness. That is to say, the<br>
thickness of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is almost<br>
constant, and has excellent water resistance.<br>
In the case where the foamable resin composition of<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet contains the liquid<br>
rubber-based resin ingredient, the liquid rubber-based<br>
resin ingredient contributes to reduction in load upon<br>
kneading the foamable resin composition. Thus, even in the<br>
case where the foamable resin composition contains the<br>
powdery additive, load upon kneading the foamable resin<br>
composition does not rise and the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet is produced with high productivity.<br>
In the case where the foamable resin composition of<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet contains the liquid<br>
rubber-based resin ingredient and a predetermined amount of<br>
the powdery additive, the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient serves as a dispersant to uniformly disperse the<br>
particles of the powdery additive in the rubber-based resin<br>
and to cover particles of the powdery additive. The<br>
powdery additive does not emerge on the surface of the<br>
closed-cell foamed rubber sheet in such a case. Thus, in<br>
contrast to the conventional conditions, it is possible to<br>
prevent deterioration of sealability and water resistance<br>
due to the emergence of the powdery additive on the surface<br>
of the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet to be provided.<br>
In the case where the foamable resin composition of<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet contains a liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-based rubber as the liquid rubber-based resin<br>
ingredient, the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet to be<br>
provided has more excellent sealability, flexibility<br>
against compression, durability, and oil resistance. Thus,<br>
the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet has more excellent<br>
sealability owing to its excellent adhesiveness and<br>
flexibility against compression. In addition, even in the<br>
case where the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet is used for<br>
a long time, repulsion force is less likely to reduce and<br>
thereby sealability is less likely to reduce owing to its<br>
durability. Furthermore, the closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet is not likely to deteriorate owing to its excellent<br>
oil resistance, so that the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet<br>
exerts excellent water resistance for a long time.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following will more concretely describe the<br>
embodiments of the present invention referring to examples.<br>
The present invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
(Examples 1 to 13, Comparative Example 2)<br>
A foamable resin composition containing:<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR, produced by ZEON Corp.,<br>
trade name: Nipol DN401, density: 0.94 g/cm3) ; liquid<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (liquid NBR, produced by<br>
ZEON Corp., trade name: Nipol DN601, density: 0.98 g/cm3);<br>
azodicarbonamide (produced by Otsuka Chemical Co., Ltd.,<br>
trade name: SO-L, decomposition temperature: 197°C) ;<br>
powdery phenol-based antioxidant (produced by Ciba<br>
Specialty Chemical Corp., trade name: IRGANOX 1010);<br>
powdery flame retardant (produced by Albemarle Corp., trade<br>
name: SAYTEX 8010); and powdery carbon black (produced by<br>
Asahi Carbon Co., Ltd., trade name: ASAHI #70), each in a<br>
predetermined amount shown in Tables 1 to 4, was kneaded<br>
with a pressure kneader. In the case where the foamable<br>
resin composition did not contain one or more of the<br>
ingredients, this case is indicated with the symbol "-" in<br>
the tables.<br>
The liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber is in a<br>
liquid state at 23°C and 1.01 x 105 Pa. The powdery phenol-<br>
based antioxidant, the powdery flame retardant, and the<br>
powdery carbon black are in a powder state at 23°C and 1.01<br>
x 105 Pa.<br>
The kneaded foamable resin composition was melted and<br>
kneaded in an extruder. The melted foamable resin<br>
composition was extruded from the extruder at an extrusion<br>
speed of 50 kg/h to provide a foamable sheet with a<br>
thickness of 1 mm.<br>
The foamable sheet was irradiated with ionizing<br>
radiation on both of its surfaces at an acceleration<br>
voltage of 50 0 keV with the dose of 1.5 Mrad, and thus, the<br>
foamable sheet was cross-linked.<br>
The cross-linked foamable sheet was foamed by heat at<br>
240°C in a foaming oven to provide a closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet having an apparent density, a closed cell<br>
ratio, and a thickness shown in Table 1.<br>
The aforementioned ingredients are referred to as<br>
follows in Tables 1 to 4. The acrylonitrile-butadiene<br>
rubber is referred to as "NBR". The liquid acrylonitrile-<br>
butadiene rubber is referred to as "liquid NBR". The<br>
powdery phenol-based antioxidant is referred to simply as<br>
"antioxidant". The powdery flame retardant is referred to<br>
simply as "flame retardant". The powdery carbon black is<br>
referred to simply as "carbon black".<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
To the foamable resin composition of Example 3 was<br>
blended 1.0 part by weight of dicumyl peroxide (produced by<br>
NOF Corp., trade name: PERCUMYL D40, 1-minute half-life<br>
temperature: 175.2°C) as a cross-linking agent to prepare a<br>
foamable resin composition. The thus-prepared foamable<br>
resin composition was kneaded with a pressure kneader.<br>
The kneaded foamable resin composition was melted and<br>
kneaded in an extruder. The melted foamable resin<br>
composition was extruded from the extruder at an extrusion<br>
speed of 50 kg/h to provide a foamable sheet. The obtained<br>
foamable sheet was cross-linked by heat for 5 minutes in a<br>
13 0°C heating oven.<br>
The cross-linked foamable sheet was foamed by heat at<br>
240°C in a foaming oven. Thus, a closed-cell foamed rubber<br>
sheet having an apparent density of 39 kg/m3, a closed cell<br>
ratio of 88%, and a thickness of 3.0 mm was provided.<br>
The foamable resin composition was evaluated for a<br>
kneading load, and the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet was<br>
evaluated for an initial peel strength and water resistance<br>
in accordance with the following ways. Tables 1 to 4 show<br>
the results.<br>
(Kneading load)<br>
During the production of the closed-cell foamed<br>
rubber sheet, the maximum amperage (A) of the main motor of<br>
the extruder upon melting and kneading the foamable resin<br>
composition was measured.<br>
(Initial peel strength)<br>
The just-produced closed-cell foamed rubber sheet was<br>
cut in a size of 25 mm in width x 12.5 mm in length. The<br>
cut closed-cell foamed rubber sheet was sandwiched by two<br>
acryl resin plates each in a size of 25 mm in width x 100<br>
mm in length to provide a laminated body, and the laminated<br>
body was placed on a horizontal plane. The laminated body<br>
was pressurized in the thickness direction for 15 minutes<br>
by a 500-g weight placed on the center portion of the upper<br>
surface of the laminated body to provide a sample. The<br>
sample comprised the closed-cell foamed rubber sheet and<br>
the acryl resin plates integrally laminated on both of the<br>
surfaces of the rubber sheet.<br>
A peel strength (kPa) of the just-produced sample was<br>
measured at a pulling speed of 50 mm/m in accordance with<br>
JIS K6850. In every case, interfacial peeling occurred<br>
upon peeling off the sample.<br>
(Water resistance of seal material adhering to sealed<br>
portion against distilled water)<br>
The obtained closed-cell foamed rubber sheet was cut<br>
in an annular shape (outer diameter: 10 0 mm, inner<br>
diameter: 80 mm, thickness: 3.0 mm) to prepare a test piece.<br>
The test piece was placed at the center of a flat acryl<br>
resin plate. Then, another flat acryl resin plate with a<br>
through hole at the center portion was placed on the test<br>
piece such that the through hole was located on the center<br>
of the circle of the test piece to prepare a laminated body.<br>
The laminated body was compressed in the thickness<br>
direction of the test piece, thereby providing a sample in<br>
which the distance between the surfaces facing to each<br>
other of the acryl plates was 2.55 mm (compression rate of<br>
test piece: 15%).<br>
Distilled water was poured via the through hole of<br>
the sample into the space defined by the sample piece and<br>
the surfaces facing to each other of the two acryl resin<br>
plates, and the space was filled with distilled water. The<br>
sample was then pressurized at 15 kPa from the through hole.<br>
A time period from the start of the pressurization to the<br>
leakage of distilled water (water-resistant time (minutes))<br>
was measured. In the case where the water-resistant time<br>
was longer than 120 minutes, this case is indicated with<br>
the phrase "no leakage" in Table 1.<br>
(Water resistance of seal material adhering to sealed<br>
portion against aqueous solution of surfactant)<br>
A sample having the same shape as that of the sample<br>
for the evaluation for water resistance against distilled<br>
water was prepared. An aqueous solution of a surfactant<br>
(produced by Prostaff, car shampoo S-01) was poured via the<br>
through hole of the sample into the space defined by the<br>
sample piece and the surfaces facing to each other of the<br>
two acryl resin plates, and the space was filled with the<br>
aqueous solution of the surfactant. A time period from the<br>
start of the pressurization to the leakage of the aqueous<br>
solution of the surfactant (water-resistant time (minutes))<br>
was measured. In the case where the aqueous solution of<br>
the surfactant leaked within an hour, water resistance was<br>
evaluated as "bad"; in the case where the aqueous solution<br>
of the surfactant did not leak over an hour and leaked<br>
within 6 hours, water resistance was evaluated as "good";<br>
and in the case where the aqueous solution of the<br>
surfactant did not leak over 6 hours, water resistance was<br>
evaluated as "very good".<br>
