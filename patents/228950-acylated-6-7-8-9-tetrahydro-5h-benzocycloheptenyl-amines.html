Acylated 6,7,8,9-tctrahydro-5H-benzocycloheptenyI amines and their use as pharmaceutical<br>
The present invention relates to acylaled 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-ben2ocycIoheptenyl amines of the general formula (I) with the definitions of R' to R^ and A to D given belov^ in the text, in any of their stereoisomeric forms or mixtures thereof in any ratio or the pharmaccutically acceptable salts thereof, and their use as pharmaceutical agents.<br><br>
Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS, NOS-III) belongs to a group of three isoenz&gt;'mes which produce nitric oxide (NO) by oxidation of arginine. Endothelially released NO is of central importance in a number of key cardiovascular mechanisms. It has a vasodilating effect and inhibits the aggregation of platelets, the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and the proliferation of intimal smooth muscle cells.<br>
Endothelial NO synthase is subject to physiological and pathophysiological regulation both at the transcriptional and at the post-transcriptional level. Enzyme already present in the endothelium may undergo calcium-dependent and calcium-independent activation through phosphorylation of specific amino acids, but also by direct interactions with specific proteins. Stimulators of this, usually transient, NO release are, extracellular arginine, 17p-estrogen and the mechanical stimulus exerted on the luminal surface of the endothelium by the blood flow (shear stress). The latter additionally leads to regulation of eNOS at the transcriptional level. Thus, for example, Sessa et al. (Circ. Research 74 (1994)<br><br>
349-353) were able by means of exercise training and the increase in shear stress associated therewith to obtain a marked increase in ecNOS.<br>
Whether regulation at the post-transscriptional level is relevant in vivo, is often not 1      unambiguously proved. Thus, for example, administration of a high arginine dose is followed by only a transient improvement in the endotheiium-dependent vasorelaxation in patients with coronary heart disease.<br>
On the other hand, the significance of the upregulation of the eNOS protein is scientifically I accepted. Thus, there are .findings which show that the protective properties of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin can be attributed, besides the lipid lowering, also in part to an increase in eNOS expression in vivo (Endres et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) 8880-8885). It is additionally known that single point mutations in the 5'-flanking region of the eNOS gene ("eNOS promoter"), and the reduction in the rate of eNOS gene transcription associated therewith, in the Japanese population is associated with an increase in the risk of coronary spasms (Nakayama et al.. Circulation 99 (1999) 2864-2870).<br>
The current assumption therefore is that the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of eNOS regulation are seriously disturbed in a large number of disorders, especially in cardiovascular disorders. Even in very early stages of a wide variety of cardiovascular disorders it is possible for a dysftinction of this type in the endothelium lining the blood vessels to lead to a deficiency of bioactive NO, which is manifested as the disorder progresses in the form of measurable pathophysiological and morphological changes. Thus, critical steps in early atherogenesis are speeded up by a decrease in endothelial NO release, such as, for example, the oxidation of low density lipoproteins, the recruitment and deposition of monocytes in the intima of vessels, and the proliferation of intimal cells. A consequence of atherogenesis is the formation of plaques on the inside of the blood vessels, which may in turn lead, through a diminution in the shear stress, to a further decrease in endothelial NO release and a further deterioration in the pathology. Since endothelial NO is also a vasodilator, a decrease thereof frequently also leads to hypertension, which may, as an independent risk factor, cause further organ damage:<br><br>
The aim of a therapeutic approach to the treatment of these disorders must accordingly be to interrupt this chain of events by increasing the endothelial NO expression. Gene transfer experiments which lead in vitro to ovcrexpression of NO synthase in previously damaged Vessels are in fact able to counteract the described processes and are thus evidence of the correctness of this approach (Varenne et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 11 (2000) 1329).<br>
Some low molecular weight compounds which, in cell cultures, may lead to a direct effect on eNOS transcription and expression are disclosed in the literature. The statins which have already been mentioned are, however, the only substances for which it has been possible to date to show such an increase in eNOS in vivo as a side effect. In view of the known range of side effects of this class of substances, however, it is unclear how far this effect is present in a toxicologically unproblematic dose.<br>
Liao et al. claim in WO 99/47153 and WO 00/03746 the use of rhoGTPase inhibitors and agents which influence the organization of the actin cyloskeletdn for increasing eNOS in endothelial cells and for the therapy of various disorders such as, for example, strokes or puImonar&gt;' hypertension, without, however, indicating a specific way of achieving this.<br>
Thus, there exists a strong need for compounds which upregulate eNOS-expression in endothelial cells. The object of the present invention is to provide compounds showing this ability.<br>
This object is attained by acylated 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-ben20cycloheptenyl amines according to the general formula (I) in any of their stereoisomeric forms or mixtures thereof in any ratio or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br><br><br>

If, in the compounds of fonmula (I), groups or substituents such as, for example, aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl etc., can be present several times, they all independently from each other have the meanings indicated and can hence, in each individual case, be identical with or different from each other. One example is the di(C1-10-alkyl)amino group in which the alkyl substitutents can be identical or different.<br><br>
Alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl residues can be linear or branched, acyclic or cyclic. This also applies when they are part of other groups, for example in alkoxy groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups or amino groups, or when they are substituted.<br>
Examples for alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, the n-isomers of these residues, isopropyl, isobutyl, isopentyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl. The term alkyl here also expressly includes cycloalkyi residues and cycloalkyl-alkyl-residues (alkyl substituted by cycloalkyl) containing at least three carbon atoms. Examples for such cycloalkyl residues are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl. All cycloalkyl groups can be substituted by one or more identical or different (C1-C4)-alkyl residues, in particular by methyl. Examples for substituted cycloalkyl residues are 4-methylcyclohexyl, 4-tert-butylcyclohexyl or 2,3-dimethylcyclopentyL Furthermore, unless stated otherwise, the term alkyl here also includes unsubstituted alkyl residues as well as alkyl residues which are substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different residues, for example aryl groups.

If not stated otherwise, the above-mentioned phenyl residues, naphthyl and indanyl residues and heterocycHc residues (including heteroaryl residues) can be unsubstituted or can carry one or more, for example one, two, three or four, of the substituents indicated in the above definition which can be in any desired position. If in compounds of the formula (I) nitro groups are present as substituents, in total only up to two nitro groups are preferably present in the molecule.-In monosubstituted phenyl residues the substituent can be in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position, in disubstituted phenyl residues the substituents can be in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-posilion, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. In trisubstituted phenyl residues the substituents can be in 2,3,4-position, 2,3,5-position, 2,3,6-position, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-position or 3,4,5-position. In fourfold substituted phenyl residues, the substituents Cdsi be in the 2,3,4,5-position, the 23,4,6-position, or the 2, 3,5,6-posilion. Tolyl (= methylphenyl) can be 2-tolyl, 3-tolyl or 4-tolyl. Naphthyl can be 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl. In monosubstituted 1-naphthyl residues the substituent can be in the 2-position, the 3-position, the 4-position, the 5-position, the 6-position, the 7-position or the 8-position, in monosubstituted 2-naphthyl residues in the 1-position, the 3-position, the 4-position, the 5-position, the 6-position, the 7-position or the 8-position. In higher substituted naphthyl radicals, for example 1-naphthyl radicals or 2-naphthyl radicals which carry two or three substituents, the substituents can also be situated in all possible positions. Indanyl residues include indan-1-yl residues and indan-2-yl residues which can be unsubstituted or carry one or more of the substituents indicated. In case the indanyl residues are substituted, the substituent or substituents can be in any of the positions possible.<br>
The above definitions as well as the following definitions relating to monovalent residues equally apply to the divalent residues phenylene, naphthylene and heteroarylene. Those divalent residues can be attached to the adjacent groups by any ring carbon atom. In the case of a phenylene residue, these can be in 1,2-position (ortho-phenylene), 1,3-position (meta-phenylene) or 1,4-position (para-phenylene). In the case of a naphthylene residue the free bonds can be in 1,2-position (= 1,2-naphthylene or 1,2-naphthalinediyl) or in 1,3-position, 1,4-position, 1,5-position, 1,6-position, 1,7-position, 1,8-position, 2,3-position, 2,6-position or 2,7-position. In the case of 5-membered ring aromatics containing one<br><br>
heteroalom such as, for example, thiophene or furan, the two free bonds can be in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position or 3,4-position. A divalent residue derived from pyridine can be a 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-pyridinediyI residue. In the case of unsymmetrical divalent residues the present invention includes all positional isomers, i. e., in the case of a 2,3-pyridincdiyl residue, for example, it includes the compound in which the one adjacent group is present in the 2-position and.the other adjacent group is present in the 3-position as well as the compound in which the one adjacent group is present in the 3-position and the other adjacent group is present in the 2-position.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, heteroaryl residues, heteroarylene residues, heterocyclyl residues and rings which are formed by two groups bonded to a nitrogen are preferably derived from heterocycles which contain one, two, three or four heteroatoms which can be identical or different; more preferably they are derived from heterocycles which contain one, two, or three, in particular one or two, heteroatoms which can be identical or different. Unless slated otherwise, the heterocycles can be monocyclic or polycyclic, for example monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic. Preferably they are monocyclic or bicyclic. The rings preferably are 5-membered rings, 6-membered rings or 7-membered rings.

Independently, the same applies to the term "group Ar" or the term "group Hetar", respectively. Suitable heterocycles include, for example, the saturated heterocycles pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine and thiomorpholine. The degree of saturation of heterocyclic groups is indicated in their individual definitions. Unsaturate;! heterocycles can contain, for<br><br>
example, one, two or three double bonds within the ring system. 5-membered rings and 6-membcred rings can in particular also be aromatic.<br>
Substituents which may be derived from these heterocycles can be attached via any suitable carbon atom. Residues derived from nitrogen heterocycles can carry a hydrogen atom or a substituent on a ring nitrogen atom, and examples include pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperazine residues, etc. Those nitrogen heterocyclic residues can also be attached via a ring nitrogen atom, in particular if the respective heterocyclic residue is bonded to a carbon atom. For example, a thienyl residue can be present as 2-thienyl residue or 3-thienyl residue, a ftiryl residue as 2-furyl residue or 3-furyl residue, a pyridyl residue as 2-pyridyl residue, 3-pyridyl residue or 4-pyridyl residue, a piperidinyl residue as 1-piperidinyl residue (= piperidino residue), 2-piperidinyl residue, 3-piperidinyl residue or 4-piperidinyl residue, a (thio)morpholinyl residue as 2-(-thio)morpholinyl residue, 3-(thio)morpholinyl residue or 4-(thio)morpholinyl residue (= thiomorpholino residue). A residue derived from 1,3-thiazole or imidazole which is attached via a carbon atom can be attached via the 2-position, the 4-position or the 5-position.<br>
In case a heterocyclic groups is substituted, it can carry one or more, for example one, two, . three or four, identical or different substituents. Substituents in heterocycles can be present in any desired j)ositions, for example in a 2-thienyi residue or 2-furyl residue in the 3-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position, in a 3-ihienyI residue or 3-furyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position, in a 2-pyridyl residue in the 3-position and'or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position, in a 3-pyridyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position, in a 4-pyridyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 3-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position.

The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions, syrups, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, for example in the form of suppositories. Administration can also be carried out parenterally, for example subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously in the form of solutions for injection or inftision. Other suitable administration forms are, for example, percutaneous or topical administration, for example in the form of ointments, tinctures, sprays or transdermal therapeutic systems, or the inhalative administration in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures, or, for example, microcapsules, implants or rods. The preferred administration form depends, for example, on the disease to be treated and on its severity.<br>
The amount of compounds of the formula (I) and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical preparations normally ranges from 0.2 to 800 mg, preferably from 0.5 to 500 mg, in particular from 1 to 200 mg, per dose, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it may also be higher. The pharmaceutical preparations usually<br><br>
comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of the pharmaceutical preparations can be carried out in a manner known per se. To this end, one or more compounds of the formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier substances and/or additives (or auxiliary substances) and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds having therapeutic or prophylactic action, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human or veterinary medicine.<br>
For the production of pills, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, starch, for example maize starch, or starch derivatives, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the preparation of solutions, for example of solutions for injection, or of emulsions, or s&gt;Tups are, for example, water, physiologically sodium chloride solution, alcohols such as eihanol, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, maiuiitol, vegetable oils, etc. It is also possible to lyophilize the compounds of the formula (1) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to use the resulting lyophilisates, for example, for preparing preparations for injection or infusion. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.<br>
Besides the compound or compounds according to the invention and carriers, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain additives, for example fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the psmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.<br>
The dosage of the compound of the fonmula (I) to be administered and/or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the<br><br>
efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of the formula (I). In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, in particular 0.3 to 5 mg/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose can be administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, be divided into several, for example tv/o, three or four individual doses. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or dov^wards from the given daily dose.<br>
The compounds according to the formula (I) can also be used for other purposes than those indicated in the foregoing. Non-limiting examples include diagnostic purposes, the use as biochemical tools, and as intermediates for the preparation of further compounds, e.g. pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated in the following examples: Examples:<br>
Preparation of 6,7,8,9-Tetrahydro-5H-benzoc&gt;'clobepten-6-yI amine<br>
12g (75 mmol) benzosubcrone were dissolved in 200 ml methanol at 45°C and 9.66g (82.5 nmiol) isoamylnitrite was added. Subsequently 10 ml concentrated HCl was added dropwise over a period of 10 min. and the mixture was stirred for 3h at 45°C. After concentrating the thus-obtained residue was chromatographically fractionated on silica gel using a methylene chloride-methanol mixture (98:2, v/v) as mobile phase. Yield: 8,5g (60%).<br>
8g of the above intermediate were dissolved in 400 ml of glacial acetic acid, 5ml of concentrated sulfriric acid were added and the intermediate was hydrogenated using 3g palladium on charcoal under a pressure of 10 bar for 20h.<br>
After filtering off the catalyst, the mixture was poured into water and extracted by using acetic acid ethyl ester. Then the aqueous phase was treated with sodium hydroxide solution<br><br>
to obtain a basic phase and subsequently extracted by using methylene chloride. After drying and concentrating the thus-obtained residue was poured into acetic acid ethyl ester and etherial HCl was added to obtain the corresponding hydrochloride. Yield: 4,2g (50%).<br>
By reducing the time of hydrogenation the following product can be obtained in an analogous way:<br>
6-Aniino-6,7,8,9-tctrahydro-5H-benzocycIoheptcn-5-ol<br>
General method for the acylation of benzocycloheptenyl amines:<br>
2.5 mmol of the respective benzocycloheptenyl amine were mixed with 550 mg triethyl amine and 5 ml dioxane, then 2.5 mmol of carboxylic acid chloride was added and stirred at room temperature over a period of 2h.<br>
The resulting mixture was then poured onto an ice/HCl-mixture, the obtained precipitate was extracted with acetic acid ethyl ester, dried with sodium sulfate and then concentrated. The thus-obtained residue was fractionated by prep. HPLC.<br>
The following compounds (examples 1 - 6) were obtsiined according to the above method:<br>

Measurement of activation of eNOS transcription<br>
Activation of eNOS transcription was measured as described in detail in Li et al. "Activation of protein kinase C alpha and/or epsilon enhances transcription of the human endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene", Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 630-637.<br>
Briefly, a 3,5kB long fragment 5 of the starting codon of the eNOS gene was cloned, sequenced and cloned in firefly luciferase expression plasmids to monitor activation of the eNOS promoter by reporter gene activity. A human endothelial cell line stable transfected and expressing this promoter-reporter construct was used for compound testing. Cells were incubated for 18h with compounds.<br>
All compounds were dissolved before in sterile DMSO. A final concentration of 0.5% DMSO in complete medium was allowed. Induction of reporter gene expression in these cells was measured using a standard luciferase assay system (Promega, Cat. No El50) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase induction in cells incubated with compounds were compared to those incubated with solvent alone. The ratio of both activities (transcription induction ratio, TIR) w^as plotted as a function of compound concentration. Typically, TIR values started at low concentrations at a ratio of 1, indicating no compound effect, and extended up to a maximum TIR value TIR(max) which indicates the increase of the eNOS transcription. EC50 values of transcription induction ratios as a function of compound concentration were determined graphically.<br>
The effect of compounds on eNOS-transcription was confirmed in a second assay based on eNOS protein detection. Primary human umbilical vein cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and cultivated according to standard procedures. Confluent cells were incubated with compounds for 18h and the effect on eNOS protein expression determined by a quantitative Westemblotting procedure. After compounds incubation, HUVEC were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing lOmM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS and protease inhibitors. The lysate was subjected to a standard denaturating polyacrylamid gel electropheresis and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Using a specific primary monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, UK) and alkaline phosphatase labelled secondary antibody (Jackson Labs), a specific eNOS protein band was visualized and quantified based on a chemifluorescence detection method.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The effect of the compounds according to the invention can also be investigated in the following animal models. (Animal experiments are performed in accordance to the German animal protection lav^ and to the guidelines for the use of experimental animals as given by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the US National Institutes of Health.)<br>
Animals and Treatment (Experiments A - C)<br>
ApoE and eNOS deficient mice (C57BL/6J background, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me) are used. All animals are 10 - 12 weeks of age and weigh 22 to 28 g. Three days before surgery mice are divided into 4 groups (apoE control, n=10-l2; apoE with test compounds, n= 10-12; eNOS control, n=10-12; eNOS with lest compounds, n=l0-12) and receive either a standard rodent chow (containing 4 % fat and 0,001 % cholesterol; in the following designated as placebo group) or a standard rodent chow + test compound (10 or 30 mg/kg/d p.o.).<br>
A	Anti-hypertensive effect in ApoE knockout mice<br>
Blood-pressure is determined in conscious mice using a computerized tail-cuff system (Visitech Systems, Apex, Nc). After treatment of ApoE deficient mice and eNOS deficient mice with the test compounds the blood pressure is compared to the results obtained with a placebo treatment.<br><br>
Inhibition of neointima formation and athcrogenesis (femoral artery cuff)<br>
er 3 day treatment of ApoE deficient mice with the respective compound, (lOmg/kg/d<br>
ssed   in   chow),   animals   are   anesthetized   with   an   intraperitoneal   injection   of<br>
itobarbital (60 mg/kg) followed by an intramuscular injection of xylazin (2 mg/kg) and<br>
uff is placed around the femoral artery as described in Moroi et al.( J Clin Invest.<br>
1:1225-32, 1998). Briefly, the left femoral artery is dissected. A non-occlusive 2,0 mm<br>
yethylene cuff made of PE-50 tubing (inner diameter 0,56 mm, outer diameter 0,965<br>
1, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, Ca) is placed around the artery and tied in place<br>
h two 7-0 sutures. The right femoral artery is isolated from the surrounding tissues but a<br>
Tis not placed. Treatment with the respective compound is continued for 14 days after<br>
gery. Then the animals are sacrificed. The aorta are taken for dctemiination of vascular<br>
OS expressions by quantitative western blotting. Both femoral arteries are harvested,<br>
ed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. 20 cross sections (10 \xm) are cut from the<br>
ffed portion of the left femoral artery and from the corresponding segment of the right<br>
er)'. Sections are subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. Morphometric<br>
alyses are performed using an image analysis computer program (LeicaQWin, Leica<br>
laging Systems, Cambridge, GB). For each cross section the area of the lumen, the<br>
ointima and the media are determined. To this end, the neointima is defined as the area<br>
tween the lumen and the internal elastic lamina and the media is defined as the area<br>
t^^'een the internal and the external elastic lamina. The ratio between the area of the<br>
ointima and the area of the media is expressed as the neointima/media ratio. The results<br>
itained in thecompound group are compared to those obtained in the placebo group.<br>
Prevention of atherosclerotic plaque formation in chronic treatment<br>
poE deficient mice are treated for 16 weeks with the respective compound pressed in low and finally sacrificed. Aortas are removed from each mouse, fixed in formalin and nbedded in paraffin. Plaaue formation is measured via lipid lesions formation in the<br><br>
)rtas (from aortic arch to diaphragm) and is analyzed by oil red 0 staining. For jantifying the effect of the respective compound on vascular eNOS expression the moral arteries are used in this experiment. The results obtained in the compound group e compared to those obtained in the placebo group.<br>

The aorta is cannulated and onnected to a perfusion apparatus (HUGO SACHS ELECTRONICS, Freiburg, Germany) ^hich is started immediately at a constant perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg. Hearts are erfused in a retrograde fashion with modified Kiebs bicarbonate buffer, equilibrated with 5% O2 and 5 % CO2 and maintained at 37.5° C.<br>
^ beveled small tube (PE 50) is passed through a pulmonary vein into the left ventricle and ►ulled through the ventricular wall, anchored in the apex by a fluted end, and connected to tip-micromanometer (Millar 1.4 French). The left atrium is cannulated through the same lulmonary vein and the heart switched to the working mode with a constant preload pressure of 10 mm Hg and an afterload pressure of 60 mm Hg. Aortic outflow and atrial nflow are continuously measured using ultrasonic flow probes (HSE/Transonic Systems nc). Coronary flow is calculated as the difference between atrial flow and aortic flow. All lemodynamic data are digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and recorded with a PC ising spezialized software (HEM, Notocord).<br>
iearts are allowed to stabilize for 30 min. All functional hemodynamic data are measured luring steady state, and during volume- and pressure loading.<br>
^eft ventricular fiinction curves are constructed by varying pre-load pressure. For icquisition of preload curves, afterload is set at 60 mm Hg and preload is adjusted in 5 mm R6g steps over a range of 5 to 25 mm Hg.

Acylated 6,7,8,9-tctrahydro-5H-benzocycloheptenyI amines and their use as pharmaceutical<br>
The present invention relates to acylaled 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-ben2ocycIoheptenyl amines of the general formula (I) with the definitions of R' to R^ and A to D given belov^ in the text, in any of their stereoisomeric forms or mixtures thereof in any ratio or the pharmaccutically acceptable salts thereof, and their use as pharmaceutical agents.<br><br>
Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS, NOS-III) belongs to a group of three isoenz&gt;'mes which produce nitric oxide (NO) by oxidation of arginine. Endothelially released NO is of central importance in a number of key cardiovascular mechanisms. It has a vasodilating effect and inhibits the aggregation of platelets, the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and the proliferation of intimal smooth muscle cells.<br>
Endothelial NO synthase is subject to physiological and pathophysiological regulation both at the transcriptional and at the post-transcriptional level. Enzyme already present in the endothelium may undergo calcium-dependent and calcium-independent activation through phosphorylation of specific amino acids, but also by direct interactions with specific proteins. Stimulators of this, usually transient, NO release are, extracellular arginine, 17p-estrogen and the mechanical stimulus exerted on the luminal surface of the endothelium by the blood flow (shear stress). The latter additionally leads to regulation of eNOS at the transcriptional level. Thus, for example, Sessa et al. (Circ. Research 74 (1994)<br><br>
349-353) were able by means of exercise training and the increase in shear stress associated therewith to obtain a marked increase in ecNOS.<br>
Whether regulation at the post-transscriptional level is relevant in vivo, is often not 1      unambiguously proved. Thus, for example, administration of a high arginine dose is followed by only a transient improvement in the endotheiium-dependent vasorelaxation in patients with coronary heart disease.<br>
On the other hand, the significance of the upregulation of the eNOS protein is scientifically I accepted. Thus, there are .findings which show that the protective properties of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin can be attributed, besides the lipid lowering, also in part to an increase in eNOS expression in vivo (Endres et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) 8880-8885). It is additionally known that single point mutations in the 5'-flanking region of the eNOS gene ("eNOS promoter"), and the reduction in the rate of eNOS gene transcription associated therewith, in the Japanese population is associated with an increase in the risk of coronary spasms (Nakayama et al.. Circulation 99 (1999) 2864-2870).<br>
The current assumption therefore is that the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of eNOS regulation are seriously disturbed in a large number of disorders, especially in cardiovascular disorders. Even in very early stages of a wide variety of cardiovascular disorders it is possible for a dysftinction of this type in the endothelium lining the blood vessels to lead to a deficiency of bioactive NO, which is manifested as the disorder progresses in the form of measurable pathophysiological and morphological changes. Thus, critical steps in early atherogenesis are speeded up by a decrease in endothelial NO release, such as, for example, the oxidation of low density lipoproteins, the recruitment and deposition of monocytes in the intima of vessels, and the proliferation of intimal cells. A consequence of atherogenesis is the formation of plaques on the inside of the blood vessels, which may in turn lead, through a diminution in the shear stress, to a further decrease in endothelial NO release and a further deterioration in the pathology. Since endothelial NO is also a vasodilator, a decrease thereof frequently also leads to hypertension, which may, as an independent risk factor, cause further organ damage:<br><br>
The aim of a therapeutic approach to the treatment of these disorders must accordingly be to interrupt this chain of events by increasing the endothelial NO expression. Gene transfer experiments which lead in vitro to ovcrexpression of NO synthase in previously damaged Vessels are in fact able to counteract the described processes and are thus evidence of the correctness of this approach (Varenne et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 11 (2000) 1329).<br>
Some low molecular weight compounds which, in cell cultures, may lead to a direct effect on eNOS transcription and expression are disclosed in the literature. The statins which have already been mentioned are, however, the only substances for which it has been possible to date to show such an increase in eNOS in vivo as a side effect. In view of the known range of side effects of this class of substances, however, it is unclear how far this effect is present in a toxicologically unproblematic dose.<br>
Liao et al. claim in WO 99/47153 and WO 00/03746 the use of rhoGTPase inhibitors and agents which influence the organization of the actin cyloskeletdn for increasing eNOS in endothelial cells and for the therapy of various disorders such as, for example, strokes or puImonar&gt;' hypertension, without, however, indicating a specific way of achieving this.<br>
Thus, there exists a strong need for compounds which upregulate eNOS-expression in endothelial cells. The object of the present invention is to provide compounds showing this ability.<br>
This object is attained by acylated 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-ben20cycloheptenyl amines according to the general formula (I) in any of their stereoisomeric forms or mixtures thereof in any ratio or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br><br><br>

If, in the compounds of fonmula (I), groups or substituents such as, for example, aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl etc., can be present several times, they all independently from each other have the meanings indicated and can hence, in each individual case, be identical with or different from each other. One example is the di(C1-10-alkyl)amino group in which the alkyl substitutents can be identical or different.<br><br>
Alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl residues can be linear or branched, acyclic or cyclic. This also applies when they are part of other groups, for example in alkoxy groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups or amino groups, or when they are substituted.<br>

Indanyl residues include indan-1-yl residues and indan-2-yl residues which can be unsubstituted or carry one or more of the substituents indicated. In case the indanyl residues are substituted, the substituent or substituents can be in any of the positions possible.<br>
The above definitions as well as the following definitions relating to monovalent residues equally apply to the divalent residues phenylene, naphthylene and heteroarylene. Those divalent residues can be attached to the adjacent groups by any ring carbon atom. In the case of a phenylene residue, these can be in 1,2-position (ortho-phenylene), 1,3-position (meta-phenylene) or 1,4-position (para-phenylene). In the case of a naphthylene residue the free bonds can be in 1,2-position (= 1,2-naphthylene or 1,2-naphthalinediyl) or in 1,3-position, 1,4-position, 1,5-position, 1,6-position, 1,7-position, 1,8-position, 2,3-position, 2,6-position or 2,7-position.

heteroalom such as, for example, thiophene or furan, the two free bonds can be in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position or 3,4-position. A divalent residue derived from pyridine can be a 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-pyridinediyI residue. In the case of unsymmetrical divalent residues the present invention includes all positional isomers, i. e., in the case of a 2,3-pyridincdiyl residue, for example, it includes the compound in which the one adjacent group is present in the 2-position and.the other adjacent group is present in the 3-position as well as the compound in which the one adjacent group is present in the 3-position and the other adjacent group is present in the 2-position.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, heteroaryl residues, heteroarylene residues, heterocyclyl residues and rings which are formed by two groups bonded to a nitrogen are preferably derived from heterocycles which contain one, two, three or four heteroatoms which can be identical or different; more preferably they are derived from heterocycles which contain one, two, or three, in particular one or two, heteroatoms which can be identical or different. Unless slated otherwise, the heterocycles can be monocyclic or polycyclic, for example monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic. Preferably they are monocyclic or bicyclic. The rings preferably are 5-membered rings, 6-membered rings or 7-membered rings. Examples of monocyclic and bicyclic heterocyclic systems from which residues occuring in the compounds of the formula (I) can be derived, are pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, p&gt;Tazole, 1,2,3-tria2ole, 1,2,4-triazole, 1,3-dioxole, 1,3-oxazole (= oxazole), 1,2-oxazole (= isoxazole), l,3-thia2ole {- thiazole), l,2-thia2ole (= isothiazole), tetrazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, pyran, thiopyran, 1,4-dioxine, 1,2-oxazine, 1,3-oxazine, 1,4-oxazine, 1,2-thiazine, l,3-thia2ine, 1,4-thiazine, 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, 1,3,5-triazine, 1,2,4,5-letrazine, azepine, 1,2-diazepine, 1,3-diazepine, 1,4-diazepine, 1,3-oxazepine, 1,3-thiazepine, indole, benzothiophene, benzoftiran, benzothiazole, benzimidazole, benzodioxol, quinoline, isoquinoline, cinnoline, quinazoline, quinoxaline, phthalazine, thienothiophenes, 1,8-riaphthyridine and other naphthyridines, pteridin, or phenothiazine, each of them in saturated form (perhydro form) or in partially unsaturated form (for example in the dihydro form or the tetrahydro form) or in maximally unsaturated form, in case the respective forms are known and stable, the term "aryl" and the term "heteroaryl" as used herein coniprise bicyclic residues in which both cycles are aromatic as well as bicyclic residues in which only one cycle is aromatic. Independently, the same applies to the term "group Ar" or the term "group Hetar", respectively. Suitable heterocycles include, for example, the saturated heterocycles pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine and thiomorpholine. The degree of saturation of heterocyclic groups is indicated in their individual definitions. Unsaturate;! heterocycles can contain, for<br><br>
example, one, two or three double bonds within the ring system. 5-membered rings and 6-membcred rings can in particular also be aromatic.<br>
Substituents which may be derived from these heterocycles can be attached via any suitable carbon atom. Residues derived from nitrogen heterocycles can carry a hydrogen atom or a substituent on a ring nitrogen atom, and examples include pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperazine residues, etc. Those nitrogen heterocyclic residues can also be attached via a ring nitrogen atom, in particular if the respective heterocyclic residue is bonded to a carbon atom.

A residue derived from 1,3-thiazole or imidazole which is attached via a carbon atom can be attached via the 2-position, the 4-position or the 5-position.<br>
In case a heterocyclic groups is substituted, it can carry one or more, for example one, two, . three or four, identical or different substituents. Substituents in heterocycles can be present in any desired j)ositions, for example in a 2-thienyi residue or 2-furyl residue in the 3-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position, in a 3-ihienyI residue or 3-furyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position, in a 2-pyridyl residue in the 3-position and'or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position, in a 3-pyridyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 4-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position, in a 4-pyridyl residue in the 2-position and/or in the 3-position and/or in the 5-position and/or in the 6-position.

The compounds according to general formula (1) are preferably prepared by acylating the respective 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-ben20cycloheptenyl amine, optionally followed by further functionalization of the thus-obtained compounds. The acylation can be carried out optionally by reaction of the above amines with an acid and a suitable coupling reagent like, for example, carbodiimides, HATU or TOTU in the presence of a base like, for example, diisopropylethyl amine, or by reaction of the above amines with a carboxylic acid chloride employing solvents like, for example, dichloromethane, THF, toluene or dioxane in the presence of a base like, for example, triethyl amine. The acylation is preferably carried out at room temperature.<br>
6,7,8,9-Tetrahydro-5H-ben2ocycloheptenyl amines employed as educts can be prepared according to methods published in the literature. Appropriate methods have been published in, for example, Vejdelek, Z. J. et al. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun 39; (1974) 2819; Cannon, J. G et al. J. Med. Chem. 23 (1980) 745; Scidl, G. et al. Chem.

All reactions for the synthesis of the compounds of the formula (I) are per sc well-known to the skilled person and can be carried out under standard conditions according to or analogously to procedures described in the literature, for example in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, or Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, in order to avoid side reactions during the synthesis of a compound of the formula (1), it can be necessary or advantageous to temporarily block functional groups by introducing protective groups and to deprotect them in a later stage of the synthesis, or introduce functional groups in the form of precursor groups which in a later reaction step are converted into the desired functional groups. Such synthesis strategies and protective groups and precursor groups which are suitable in an individusd case are knov^ii to the skilled person. If desired, the compounds of the formula (I) can be purified by customary purification procedures, for example by recrystallization or chromatography. The starting compounds for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (I) are commercially available or can be prepared according to or analogously to<br><br>
literature procedures. The compounds obtained with the above-identified synthesis methods are a further object of the present invention.<br>

Compounds of the formula (I) can additionally be used in the therapy and prophylaxis of diabetes and diabetes complications (nephropathy, retinopathy), angiogenesis, asthma bronchiale, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, osteoporosis, restricted memory performance or a restricted ability to learn.<br>
Preferred indications are stable angina pectoris, coronary heart disease, hypertension, endothelial dysftmction, atherosclerosis and diabetes complications.<br>
The compounds according to the formula (I) can also be used in combination wnth other pharmaceutically active compounds, preferably compounds which are able to enhance the effect of the compounds according to the general formula (I).. Examples of such compounds include:<br><br>
statins; ACE-inhibitors; ATI-antagonists; argininase-inhibitors; PDE V-inhibitors; Ca-antagonists; alpha-blockers; beta-blockers; metimazol and analogous compounds; arginine; tetrahydrobiopterin; vitamins, in particular vitamin C and vitamin B6; niacine.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds, can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans, as pharmaceuticals by themselves, in mixtures vvith one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. Further subjects of the present invention therefore also are the compounds of the formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use as transcription stimulating agent for endothelial NO synthase and in particular their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the above-mentioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes. Furthermore, subjects of the present invention are pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which comprise an effective dose of at least one compound of the formula (I) and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e. one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and/or additives.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions, syrups, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, for example in the form of suppositories. Administration can also be carried out parenterally, for example subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously in the form of solutions for injection or inftision. Other suitable administration forms are, for example, percutaneous or topical administration, for example in the form of ointments, tinctures, sprays or transdermal therapeutic systems, or the inhalative administration in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures, or, for example, microcapsules, implants or rods. The preferred administration form depends, for example, on the disease to be treated and on its severity.<br>
The amount of compounds of the formula (I) and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical preparations normally ranges from 0.2 to 800 mg, preferably from 0.5 to 500 mg, in particular from 1 to 200 mg, per dose, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it may also be higher. The pharmaceutical preparations usually<br><br>
comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of the pharmaceutical preparations can be carried out in a manner known per se. To this end, one or more compounds of the formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier substances and/or additives (or auxiliary substances) and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds having therapeutic or prophylactic action, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human or veterinary medicine.<br>
For the production of pills, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, starch, for example maize starch, or starch derivatives, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the preparation of solutions, for example of solutions for injection, or of emulsions, or s&gt;Tups are, for example, water, physiologically sodium chloride solution, alcohols such as eihanol, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, maiuiitol, vegetable oils, etc. It is also possible to lyophilize the compounds of the formula (1) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to use the resulting lyophilisates, for example, for preparing preparations for injection or infusion. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.<br>
Besides the compound or compounds according to the invention and carriers, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain additives, for example fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the psmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.<br>
The dosage of the compound of the fonmula (I) to be administered and/or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the<br><br>
efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of the formula (I). In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, in particular 0.3 to 5 mg/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose can be administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, be divided into several, for example tv/o, three or four individual doses. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or dov^wards from the given daily dose.<br>
The compounds according to the formula (I) can also be used for other purposes than those indicated in the foregoing. Non-limiting examples include diagnostic purposes, the use as biochemical tools, and as intermediates for the preparation of further compounds, e.g. pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated in the following examples: Examples:<br>
Preparation of 6,7,8,9-Tetrahydro-5H-benzoc&gt;'clobepten-6-yI amine<br>
12g (75 mmol) benzosubcrone were dissolved in 200 ml methanol at 45°C and 9.66g (82.5 nmiol) isoamylnitrite was added. Subsequently 10 ml concentrated HCl was added dropwise over a period of 10 min. and the mixture was stirred for 3h at 45°C. After concentrating the thus-obtained residue was chromatographically fractionated on silica gel using a methylene chloride-methanol mixture (98:2, v/v) as mobile phase. Yield: 8,5g (60%).<br>
8g of the above intermediate were dissolved in 400 ml of glacial acetic acid, 5ml of concentrated sulfriric acid were added and the intermediate was hydrogenated using 3g palladium on charcoal under a pressure of 10 bar for 20h.<br>
After filtering off the catalyst, the mixture was poured into water and extracted by using acetic acid ethyl ester. Then the aqueous phase was treated with sodium hydroxide solution<br><br>
to obtain a basic phase and subsequently extracted by using methylene chloride. After drying and concentrating the thus-obtained residue was poured into acetic acid ethyl ester and etherial HCl was added to obtain the corresponding hydrochloride. Yield: 4,2g (50%).<br>
By reducing the time of hydrogenation the following product can be obtained in an analogous way:<br>
6-Aniino-6,7,8,9-tctrahydro-5H-benzocycIoheptcn-5-ol<br>
General method for the acylation of benzocycloheptenyl amines:<br>
2.5 mmol of the respective benzocycloheptenyl amine were mixed with 550 mg triethyl amine and 5 ml dioxane, then 2.5 mmol of carboxylic acid chloride was added and stirred at room temperature over a period of 2h.<br>
The resulting mixture was then poured onto an ice/HCl-mixture, the obtained precipitate was extracted with acetic acid ethyl ester, dried with sodium sulfate and then concentrated. The thus-obtained residue was fractionated by prep. HPLC.<br>

Measurement of activation of eNOS transcription<br>
Activation of eNOS transcription was measured as described in detail in Li et al. "Activation of protein kinase C alpha and/or epsilon enhances transcription of the human endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene", Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 630-637.<br>
Briefly, a 3,5kB long fragment 5 of the starting codon of the eNOS gene was cloned, sequenced and cloned in firefly luciferase expression plasmids to monitor activation of the eNOS promoter by reporter gene activity. A human endothelial cell line stable transfected and expressing this promoter-reporter construct was used for compound testing. Cells were incubated for 18h with compounds.<br>
All compounds were dissolved before in sterile DMSO. A final concentration of 0.5% DMSO in complete medium was allowed. Induction of reporter gene expression in these cells was measured using a standard luciferase assay system (Promega, Cat. No El50) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase induction in cells incubated with compounds were compared to those incubated with solvent alone. The ratio of both activities (transcription induction ratio, TIR) w^as plotted as a function of compound concentration. Typically, TIR values started at low concentrations at a ratio of 1, indicating no compound effect, and extended up to a maximum TIR value TIR(max) which indicates the increase of the eNOS transcription. EC50 values of transcription induction ratios as a function of compound concentration were determined graphically.<br>
The effect of compounds on eNOS-transcription was confirmed in a second assay based on eNOS protein detection. Primary human umbilical vein cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and cultivated according to standard procedures. Confluent cells were incubated with compounds for 18h and the effect on eNOS protein expression determined by a quantitative Westemblotting procedure. After compounds incubation, HUVEC were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing lOmM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS and protease inhibitors. The lysate was subjected to a standard denaturating polyacrylamid gel electropheresis and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Using a specific primary monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, UK) and alkaline phosphatase labelled secondary antibody (Jackson Labs), a specific eNOS protein band was visualized and quantified based on a chemifluorescence detection method.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The effect of the compounds according to the invention can also be investigated in the following animal models. (Animal experiments are performed in accordance to the German animal protection lav^ and to the guidelines for the use of experimental animals as given by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the US National Institutes of Health.)<br>
Animals and Treatment (Experiments A - C)<br>
ApoE and eNOS deficient mice (C57BL/6J background, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me) are used. All animals are 10 - 12 weeks of age and weigh 22 to 28 g. Three days before surgery mice are divided into 4 groups (apoE control, n=10-l2; apoE with test compounds, n= 10-12; eNOS control, n=10-12; eNOS with lest compounds, n=l0-12) and receive either a standard rodent chow (containing 4 % fat and 0,001 % cholesterol; in the following designated as placebo group) or a standard rodent chow + test compound (10 or 30 mg/kg/d p.o.).<br>
A	Anti-hypertensive effect in ApoE knockout mice<br>
Blood-pressure is determined in conscious mice using a computerized tail-cuff system (Visitech Systems, Apex, Nc). After treatment of ApoE deficient mice and eNOS deficient mice with the test compounds the blood pressure is compared to the results obtained with a placebo treatment.<br><br>
Inhibition of neointima formation and athcrogenesis (femoral artery cuff)<br>
er 3 day treatment of ApoE deficient mice with the respective compound, (lOmg/kg/d<br>
ssed   in   chow),   animals   are   anesthetized   with   an   intraperitoneal   injection   of<br>
itobarbital (60 mg/kg) followed by an intramuscular injection of xylazin (2 mg/kg) and<br>
uff is placed around the femoral artery as described in Moroi et al.( J Clin Invest.<br>
1:1225-32, 1998). Briefly, the left femoral artery is dissected. A non-occlusive 2,0 mm<br>
yethylene cuff made of PE-50 tubing (inner diameter 0,56 mm, outer diameter 0,965<br>
1, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, Ca) is placed around the artery and tied in place<br>
h two 7-0 sutures. The right femoral artery is isolated from the surrounding tissues but a<br>
Tis not placed. Treatment with the respective compound is continued for 14 days after<br>
gery. Then the animals are sacrificed. The aorta are taken for dctemiination of vascular<br>
OS expressions by quantitative western blotting. Both femoral arteries are harvested,<br>
ed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. 20 cross sections (10 \xm) are cut from the<br>
ffed portion of the left femoral artery and from the corresponding segment of the right<br>
er)'. Sections are subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. Morphometric<br>
alyses are performed using an image analysis computer program (LeicaQWin, Leica<br>
laging Systems, Cambridge, GB). For each cross section the area of the lumen, the<br>
ointima and the media are determined. To this end, the neointima is defined as the area<br>
tween the lumen and the internal elastic lamina and the media is defined as the area<br>
t^^'een the internal and the external elastic lamina. The ratio between the area of the<br>
ointima and the area of the media is expressed as the neointima/media ratio. The results<br>
itained in thecompound group are compared to those obtained in the placebo group.<br>
Prevention of atherosclerotic plaque formation in chronic treatment<br>
poE deficient mice are treated for 16 weeks with the respective compound pressed in low and finally sacrificed. Aortas are removed from each mouse, fixed in formalin and nbedded in paraffin. Plaaue formation is measured via lipid lesions formation in the<br><br>
)rtas (from aortic arch to diaphragm) and is analyzed by oil red 0 staining. For jantifying the effect of the respective compound on vascular eNOS expression the moral arteries are used in this experiment. The results obtained in the compound group e compared to those obtained in the placebo group.<br>
Improvement of coronary function in diseased ApoE deficient mice<br>
'Id Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Wiga GmbH, Sulzfeld), and apoE eficient mice (C57BL/6J background, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me) 6 month of ge and weighing 28 to 36 g are used in the experiments. Mice are divided into 3 groups i;57BL/6, n=8; apoE control, n=8; apoE with respective compound, n=8) and receive for weeks either a standard rodent chow (containing 4 % fat and 0,001 % cholesterol) or a Landaird rodent chow + respective compound (30 mg/kg/d p.o.).<br>
lice art anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg i.p.), and thp hearts are ipidly excised and placed into ice-cold perfusion buffer. The aorta is cannulated and onnected to a perfusion apparatus (HUGO SACHS ELECTRONICS, Freiburg, Germany) ^hich is started immediately at a constant perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg. Hearts are erfused in a retrograde fashion with modified Kiebs bicarbonate buffer, equilibrated with 5% O2 and 5 % CO2 and maintained at 37.5° C.<br>
^ beveled small tube (PE 50) is passed through a pulmonary vein into the left ventricle and ►ulled through the ventricular wall, anchored in the apex by a fluted end, and connected to tip-micromanometer (Millar 1.4 French). The left atrium is cannulated through the same lulmonary vein and the heart switched to the working mode with a constant preload pressure of 10 mm Hg and an afterload pressure of 60 mm Hg. Aortic outflow and atrial nflow are continuously measured using ultrasonic flow probes (HSE/Transonic Systems nc). Coronary flow is calculated as the difference between atrial flow and aortic flow. All lemodynamic data are digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and recorded with a PC ising spezialized software (HEM, Notocord).<br>
iearts are allowed to stabilize for 30 min. All functional hemodynamic data are measured luring steady state, and during volume- and pressure loading.<br>
^eft ventricular fiinction curves are constructed by varying pre-load pressure. For icquisition of preload curves, afterload is set at 60 mm Hg and preload is adjusted in 5 mm R6g steps over a range of 5 to 25 mm Hg. Hearts are allowed to stabilize at baseline :onditions between pressure* and volume-loading.<br>
