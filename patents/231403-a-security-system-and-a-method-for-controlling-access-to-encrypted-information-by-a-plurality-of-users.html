				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus for and a method of controlling<br>
propagation of decryption keys or access to encrypted information.<br>
There is often a need to control access to data. In some computing<br>
environments this goal has been achieved by virtue of limiting the physical<br>
access to a machine, to a data carrier, or to parts of a local area network.<br>
However such systems can be unnecessarily rigid and cumbersome, especially<br>
when the class of persons to whom access may be allowed or denied to a<br>
particular item of data is ill defined.<br>
Another approach to security is the use of encryption. In a secure system, the<br>
identities of the or each person who should have access to a document or other<br>
item of encrypted data needs to be defined at the time of encryption. This can,<br>
once again, be difficult where the class of people who should receive the data is<br>
ill defined.<br>
Neither of these themes works particularly well in a "generally trusted"<br>
environment where absolute security is not necessary. An example of a generally<br>
trusted environment is a company where a manager may be dealing with a<br>
commercially sensitive document, and may wish to share this with other<br>
managers and in turn recognises that they may need to share the document with<br>
other individuals where they deem this to be necessary or desirable. Thus the<br>
document cannot be "open" such that everyone can view it, as it may be<br>
commercially sensitive, but neither can the recipient list be accurately defined<br>
right from the outset.<br><br>
According to a first aspect of the; present invention, there is provided a security<br>
system for controlling access to encrypted information by a plurality of users,<br>
comprising a hardware device for storing at least one data unit comprising a<br>
decryption key and an associated security code, in which the decryption key is<br>
used in decrypting an encrypting an encrypted item of information and the<br>
security code controls the number of times that the decryption key can be<br>
propagated, and the hardware device examines the security code which code<br>
includes a group code as an indication of an acceptable range of recipients to<br>
determine whether it is authorized to send encrypted copies of the decryption<br>
key to those recipients.<br><br>
It is thus possible to give the originator of an item of information control over the<br>
number of times that item of information may be pleased from one person to<br>
another or how many times the decryption key can be passed from one person<br>
to another, under circumstances where the item of information is in an encrypted<br>
form.<br>
Preferably the decryption key is related to a specific project or task. Thus the<br>
controller or originator of a task can generate a key which can be used for<br>
encryption and decryption of documents within that project or task.<br>
The data unit may be a logical association between the decryption key and the<br>
security code.<br>
Advantageously the decryption key or the data unit may also include a further<br>
identifier which is unique to an entity, such as a company, so that only people<br>
having a corresponding code portion in their security device can decrypt the key<br>
for the documents.<br>
Preferably, when a further person wishes to receive a copy of the encrypted<br>
information, the decryption key for the encrypted information is sent to that<br>
other user in an encrypted form. Advantageously the decryption key is itself<br>
encrypted with the recipient's public encryption key. The transfer of the<br>
decryption key can be achieved by transferring the data unit.<br>
Advantageously the hardware device further modifies the security code each<br>
time it sends the decryption key to another user. It is thus possible to keep a<br>
track on the number of times the decryption key is propagated from one person<br><br>
to another. This security code may, for example, be "generation limit" set by the<br>
originator of the document, and each time the decryption key is propagated, the<br>
generation limit is decremented. Once the generation limit reaches zero, further<br>
propagation of the decryption ke/ is inhibited by the hardware device.<br>
Advantageously the decryption <ey is further associated with a security device></ey>
identity and/or user identity number which is unique. Each time the decryption<br>
key is propagated, the identify of the user or security device which authorized<br>
the propagation of the decryption key may be added to the decryption key or<br>
included within the data unit	<br><br>
containing the decryption key. It is thus possible for an audit trail to be identified<br>
which shows the path through which a decryption key has passed. The identity<br>
may overwrite a previous identity or be appended to a list of identifies. The list<br>
may be stored in the security device or elsewhere, such as a log file in a user's<br>
computer.<br>
Advantageously, when propagating a decryption key (eg as part of a data unit)<br>
to a further user, the person authorizing the propagation may have the ability to<br>
modify the generation limit, so as to decrement it. A person authorizing the<br>
propagation of the key, or the originator,, may also be able to set one or more<br>
control words or control flags such that the security device is instructed to send a<br>
message to that person when an attempt to further propagate the key is<br>
initiated. Indeed, the further propagation of the decryption key may be inhibited<br>
until such time as that person sends a return message to the security device<br>
authorizing the further propagat on of key. Thus it is possible to set the security<br>
system such that it automaticaly generates an audit trail and/or such that it<br>
seeks further authority from a manager when sending further copies of the<br>
decryption key, which copies still represent "generations" of the key which are<br>
within the limit authorised by the "generation limit".<br>
The authority to send the key may be generated automatically by an agent on a<br>
server which keeps a control log of propagations.<br>
The security device may interface with a further device permanently embedded<br>
within the computer, or software loaded or embedded within the computer such<br>
that attempts to access a secure document without the proper decryption key<br><br>
results in a message being sent back to a system administrator, or the author of<br>
the document, or some other person defined by a suitable security field included<br>
within the document or included within a security file associated with the<br>
document. The file associated with the document may itself be encrypted.<br>
Advantageously the security device is in the form of a small unit which the user<br>
can carry with them and which is dockable and undockable with a data<br>
processor, for example a standard PC, a portable computing device and so on<br>
having a suitable socket. Thus, the security device effectively functions as a<br>
dongle, but is not to be confused with the old style	<br><br>
dongles which were hardware devices permanently connected to the printer port<br>
of a computer. Wireless communication is also possible.<br>
The security device may be password protected. Advantageously it can be set to<br>
disable after a number of incorrect entries of the password.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided d<br>
method of controlling the propagation of decryption keys to a plurality of users<br>
for allowing access to encrypted data, comprising the steps of storing at least<br>
one data unit on a hardware device, the at least one data unit comprising a<br>
decryption key, having a propagation control word with the decryption key in the<br>
data unit, and in response to an instruction to send the data unit to a specified<br>
recipient, checking the status of the control word to determine if propagation is<br>
allowed, comprising checking thai: the specified recipient is within an acceptable<br>
range of recipients indicated as a group code in the control word, and if so,<br>
modifying the control word and encrypting the data unit comprising the control<br>
word and decryption key with a recipient's public key and sending the data unit.<br>
Advantageously the control word is set by an originator of the encrypted data<br>
and the control word is decremented at each propagation, with further<br>
propagation of the decryption key being inhibited once the control word reaches<br>
a predetermined value. The predetermined value may, for example, be zero.<br>
Preferably each recipient of the key has the ability to modify the control word<br>
such that the number of further propagations can be reduced, but not increased.<br><br>
Encryption and decryption keys can belong to individuals, or can belong to<br>
groups of people such that data can be shared amongst those people working,<br>
for example, on a particular project.<br>
The hardware component of the system preferably includes a data processor<br>
such that encryption and decryption of the decryption key is performed solely<br>
within the hardware unit. Additionally the hardware unit may further comprise a<br>
non-volatile memory such that the association between an encrypted document<br>
or other entity or service and the appropriate decryption key is maintained solely<br>
within the hardware unit.<br><br>
It is thus possible to provide a security system which allows limited propagation of an<br>
encrypted document or access thereto, even in an environment where the group of<br>
recipients requiring access to that document is not well defined.<br>
The present invention will further be described, by way of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a possible propagation path for a sensitive document<br>
within a multi-user environment;<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates a user's computing device as modified to work within a<br>
security system constituting an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates the structure of a hardware security device constituting an<br>
embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 schematically illustrates tie structure of a decryption key associated with a<br>
document in a security system constituting an embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 5a and 5b represents a flow chart illustrating the operation of a security system<br>
constituting an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the arrangement where a originator 2 of a document wishes or needs to<br>
share this document with his co-workers 4 and 6. However, for whatever reason, the<br>
originator 2 may desire that the document does not reach his colleague 8. However, since<br>
workers 4 and 6 have had access to the document, they may then deal with it as they see fit,<br>
and worker 6 may for example forward the document on to a further colleague 10 who<br>
unaware of the wishes of the originator 2 may then forward the document on to the worker<br>
8. The worker 6 may also e-mail the document to another person 12 via an external<br>
telecommunications network 14. Thus the contents of the document have now escaped<br>
from the control of the originator and the document may circulate amongst other people<br>
outside of the company.<br>
A traditional way to address this problem would be to encrypt the document at the time of<br>
transmission to workers 4 and 6. Depending on the security features of the encryption<br><br>
system used, the originator 2 may be able to inhibit further copying or printing of the<br>
document by workers 4 and 6. However, if worker 6 has a legitimate need to forward that<br>
document onto a colleague 10, then this is clearly inconvenient. However, if the document<br>
is encrypted but further copying is permitted, then there is nothing stopping worker 6<br>
forwarding the document on to his colleague 10, who may then of course forward the<br>
document on to worker 8.<br>
The inventor has noted that, each time the encrypted document is transmitted to a new<br>
recipient, or a person is to be given access to the document, folder to the like there is an<br>
opportunity to encrypt the decryption key using the recipient's public key. This gives an<br>
opportunity for a security system to monitor the number of times that the decryption key<br>
has been propagated and thereby control the level of propagation of the decryption key, and<br>
hence the ability to decrypt the encrypted document. Thus, in general terms, the originator<br>
of a document 2 may send the document or give access to recipients 4 and 6 and may also<br>
set a propagation control value to, for example, 1 thereby indicating that the decryption key<br>
can be propagated one more time. Thus, user 6 has the option to re-encrypt the decryption<br>
key using the public key of intended recipients to make one further generation copy of the<br>
decryption key. Thus, as the decryption key is encrypted with the public key of user 10, the<br>
generation (ie copy) control word as embedded in the decryption key sent to user 10 is<br>
decremented, such that the generatior, control key received by user 10 has a value of zero.<br>
Thus, although user 10 could still send the encrypted document to worker 8, he will not be<br>
able to send the decryption key to worker 8 and thus worker 8 is unable to view the<br>
document. Similarly, the user 6 still has the ability to send the key to user 12 as this still<br>
only represents a further one generation (copy) step on from user 6. However, the<br>
originator 2 may also be able to set a copy limit variable which limits the number of times<br>
the user 6 can send the decryption key to a next generation user. Thus, if for example the<br>
copy control word was set to one, and the generation control word as received by user 6<br>
was set to one, then user 6 could send a further copy of the decryption key to recipient 10,<br>
but in so doing the copy control word stored within the security system belonging to user 6<br>
would be decremented such that the ability of user 6 to send a further copy to user 12, even<br>
though this would still represent only one further generation of copying, would be inhibited<br>
because user 6 had made their quota of copies.<br><br>
Thus, the originator of a key has the ability to control both the number of "generations" to<br>
which the decryption key may be copied and independently the number of times any key<br>
may be copied within a single generation, that is the number of times the user may send a<br>
key to others.<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates a computer terminal within a security system constituting<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. The computer terminal, generally indicated 20 is<br>
in many ways a conventional terminal, such as a standard PC, having a main unit 22<br>
housing a data processor, semiconductor memory, and bulk storage memory, together with<br>
various interface cards enabling the computer to communicate with other data processors<br>
via a suitable communications network 23 which may be a LAN, a WAN, a dial up<br>
connection or any other suitable communication scheme. The data processor also includes<br>
a display device 24 and an input device 26, for example a keyboard. A data processor also<br>
includes a socket 30 for removably accepting a user security device 32 such that the device<br>
32 can establish data communication with the data processor 20.<br>
The user's security device 32 is shown in greater detail in Figure 3. In broad terms, the<br>
device comprises an embedded data processor 34 connected via an internal bus 35 to a read<br>
only memory 36 containing the executable code for causing the microprocessor 34 to<br>
perform encryption and decryption operations and to check the generation and copy control<br>
words. The device 32 also includes a non-volatile memory 38 which contains decryption<br>
keys and associated identifiers and settings. It should be noted that the internal bus 35 is<br>
not directly accessible from outside of the device 32 but all communication is in fact<br>
handled via the data-processor 34. This prevents the memory 38 from being interrogated<br>
other than by the data-processor 34. Communication between the device 32 and the data<br>
processor 30 can be by a bespoke or via standard communications port. Thus, for<br>
computers produced around the years 2000 and 2001 the communication is likely to be via<br>
a USB interface. The interface can, oi course, change dependent on the prevailing interface<br>
technology.<br>
Figure 4 shows the configuration of data within the memory 38 in greater detail. The<br>
memory 38 is divided into a series of data units. A single data unit 40 is represented in<br>
Figure 4 and comprises a plurality of elements. A first element 50 is a serial number<br><br>
representing a unique identity of the key. A second portion 52 includes the copy control<br>
commands indicating either, or both the number of generations of copies which can be<br>
made of the decryption key (ie the number of tiers through which it may be copied from<br>
user to user), and indeed the number of copies that can be made within a single generation<br>
or more. Region 54 contains the decryption key itself and region 56 contains other data,<br>
such as the audit trail and any flags or other instructions which may for example concern<br>
the need to communicate with persons higher up a data flow path in order to authorise<br>
further copying of the decryption key or to inform them that copying of the decryption key<br>
has been done.<br>
Figures 5a and 5b schematically illustrate the operation of an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Initially, control starts at step 70 where it is assumed that a user already has the<br>
encryption key, for example the public key, of a recipient which he wishes to send a<br>
decryption key to. From step 70, control is passed to step 72 where a test is made to see if<br>
the generation number is greater than zero. If the generation number is not greater than<br>
zero, then control is passed to step 74 where the procedure is exited. However, if the<br>
generation number is greater than zero then control is passed to step 76 where a test is<br>
made to see if a "group code flag" has been set. The group code is part of the recipient's<br>
public key which indicates which organisation they belong to. Thus, the group code can be<br>
examined and compared with a pass of deny list in order to determine whether the recipient<br>
is entitled to receive the decryption key. If the group code flag is set, control is passed to<br>
step 78, whereas if the flag is not set control is passed to step 82.<br>
Step 78 compares the group code embedded in the key which the user wishes to send with<br>
the group code of the recipient. If the codes match, or lie within an acceptable range of<br>
codes, then control is passed to step 82, otherwise control is passed to step 80 where the<br>
procedure is terminated. An internal copy of the key which the user wishes to send is made<br>
at step 82 and control is then passed to step 84 where a test to see whether a copy control<br>
counter is set. If the copy control courier is set, then control is passed to step 86 whereas,<br>
if it is not, control is passed to step 94 as shown in Figure 5b.<br>
A test is made at step 86 to see if the copy number is greater than zero. If it is not, then<br>
control is passed to step 88 where the procedure is exited. However, if the copy control<br><br>
number is greater than zero then cor.trol is passed to step 90 where the copy control number<br>
is decremented, and then to step 92 where the modified copy of the key including the<br>
decremented copy controlled number is rewritten back to the dongle. Control then<br>
proceeds to step 94 where the generation number is decremented, and then the modified<br>
generation number is merged with the key at step 96. From step 96, control is passed to<br>
step 98 where the key and modified generation and/or copy numbers are encrypted with the<br>
recipients public key. Control is then passed to step 100 where the key is sent to the<br>
recipient. The procedure finishes at step 102.<br>
The above system has been described in terms of allowing access to documents, but could<br>
equally apply to access to services, folders, executable files, web pages and so on. Thus<br>
one or more documents, some of which may not have yet been generated may be encrypted<br>
using the key and shared amongst users.<br>
It would also be possible to use the system to control access to updates to a journal service<br>
or the like for a period of time.<br>
Furthermore, although the invention has been described in the context of controlling the<br>
propagation of decryption keys, it is equally applicable to controlling the propagation of<br>
other security measures such as encryption keys, keys for encryption and decryption,<br>
passwords, messages and other electronic "objects" where the ability to propagate that<br>
"object" needs to be restricted.<br>
It is thus possible to provide a security system for controlling the extent of propagation of<br>
keys.<br><br>

a user's private key is stored within their own hardware device, such that<br>
the encrypted data unit can only be decrypted when the hardware device<br>
is in operation.<br>
14.	 A security system as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein<br>
the hardware device comprises a data processor such that all the<br>
encryption and decryption of the data units is performed within the<br>
hardware device.<br>
15.	 A method of controlling the propagation of decryption keys to a plurality<br>
of users for allowing access to encrypted data, comprising the steps of<br>
storing at least one data unit on a hardware device, the at least one data<br>
unit comprising a decryption key, having a propagation control word with<br>
the decryption key in the data unit, and in response to an instruction to<br>
send the data unit to a specified recipient, checking the status of the<br>
control word to determine if propagation is allowed, comprising checking<br>
that the specified recipient is within an acceptable range of recipients<br><br>
indicated as a group code in the control word, and if so, modifying the<br>
control word and encrypting the data unit comprising the control word<br>
and decryption key with a recipient's public key and sending the data unit.<br>
16. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the control word is a numeric<br>
value which is decremented at each propagation, and wherein<br>
propagation is inhibited once the numeric value reaches a predetermined<br>
value.<br>
17. A method as claimed in claim 15 or 16, wherein the originator of a key<br>
sets the number of times the key can be sent, and each time a key is<br>
sent, a variable holding a generation number of the key is modified such<br>
that when the generation number reaches the maximum number of times<br>
the keys can be sent, further sending of the key is inhibited.<br><br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling the propagation of decryption<br>
keys to a plurality of users for allowing access to encrypted data, comprising the<br>
steps of storing at least one data unit on a hardware device, the at least one<br>
data unit comprising a decryption key, having a propagation control word with<br>
the decryption key in the data unit, and in response to an instruction to send the<br>
data unit to a specified recipient, checking the status of the control word to<br>
determine if propagation is allowed, comprising checking that the specified<br>
recipient is within an acceptable range of recipients indicated as a group code in<br>
the control word, and if so, modifying the control word and encrypting the data<br>
unit comprising the control word and decryption key with a recipient's public key<br>
and sending the data unit.</td>
