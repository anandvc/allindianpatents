REINFORCING TAPE FOR SLIDE FASTENER AND METHOD FOR REINFORCING END PORTION OF FASTENER TAPE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to reinforcing structure of the end portions of fastener tapes of a separable slide fastener, and mere particularly to a reinforcing tape or reinforcing sheet material to be attached to each of the end portions of fastener tapes intended for permitting attachment of a pin~and-socket separator and a method for reinforcing the end portions of fastener tapes therewith.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art:<br>
The reinforcing tapes to be attached to the end portions of fastener tapes have been heretofore known in various types. The conventional reinforcing tapes include those which, for the sake of obviating the necessity of preparing reinforcing tapes dyed specially in various colors matched to the colors of dyed fastener tapes and consequently saving such time and labor as would  otherwise be  incurred  in  the  inventory  control,  use transparent synthetic resin films in a superposed manner so as to show the colors of the dyed fastener tapes therethrough. For  example,  the reinforcing piece which  is  formed of  two superposed transparent synthetic resin films having different mel ting points and is adapted to be applied fast to a fastener tape by melting that of the two films having a lower melting point as disciosed in Japanese Utility Model Pubi ication No. 44-25,843 and the lateral application tape which is formed by<br><br>
superposing on one side of a transparent film of nylon 6 or nylon 66 a transparent polyester copolymer film having a melting point of not more than 200°C so as to show the color of the base fabric of the fastener tape therethrough as disclosed in published Japanese Patent Application, KOKAI (Early Publication) No. (hereinafter referred to briefly as "JP-A-") 62-149,780 have been known to the art.<br>
Also JP-A-08-299,033 discloses a reinforcing tape which has a transparent elastomer film used for the obverse surface layer and an adhesive layer superposed on the reverse surface thereof.   Owing to the proper flexibility of the elastomer film, this reinforcing tape can be easily shaped in conformity with the contour of the core portion of the fastener tape and, even when it is repeatedly folded,  the folded portion is not whitened.   U.S.P. 3,490,970 discloses a method for reinforcing the end portions of fastener tapes by causing a wire mesh of metal or synthetic resin to adhere to at least one face of each of the fastener tapes by the use of a thermoplast ic res in under application of heat and pressure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although various types of reinforcing tapes have been heretofore known in the art as mentioned above, the fundamental concept thereof resides in attaching a reinforcing layer formed of transparent resin film or plain weave fibers to the end portion of a fastener tape through the medium of an adhesive layer by simultaneous application of heat and pressure. For the adhesive 1^yer mentioned above, generally a high melting and  high viscosity hot-melt  adhesive  manifesting  a melting<br><br>
point in the range of   130  to 140'C  and a me It viscosity at 200 'r  in the range of 4,000 to 6,000 poises is used.<br>
When the reinforcing tapes are attached to the fastener tapes by the use of an adhesive layer having such high melt viscosity, however, a product which is fitted with the fastener tapes, on being laundered or dry cleaned, encounters the problem that the peel strength between the reinforcing tape and the fastener tape is degraded to the extent of rendering the reinforcing tape easy to. peel.<br>
When the reinforcing tape is attached to the fastener tape by  simultaneous  application  of  heat  and  pressure,   the phenomenon occasionally emerges that bubbles enter between the adhesive layer and the fastener tape and impair the appearance of  the  reinforced portion of  the  fastener  tape  where  the reinforcing  layer happens to be formed of a resin film  (or further between the adhesive layer and the reinforcing layer where  the  adhesive  layer  and  the  reinforcing  layer  are superposed  on  the  fastener  tape  and  attached  thereto  by simultaneous applicat ion of heat and pressure) or that plain weave  fibers  are  embrittled where  the  reinforcing  layer  is formed of such plain weave fibers.  No report has ever appeared in 1iterature concerning the relation between such phenomenon and a heat source.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a reinforcing tape which can be attached with ample adhesive strength to the end portion of a fastener tape of a slide rastener and, even after the slide fastener fitted therewith  is  laundered or dry cleaned,  suffers only sparing<br><br>
loss of peeling strength.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for the reinforcement of the end portion of a fastener tape, which allows attachment of a reinforcing tape with high and stable adhesive strength to the end portion of a fastener tape without producing any problems such as entry of bubbles between the reinforcing tape and the fastener tape and embrittlement of fibers.<br>
To accomplish the objects mentioned above,  the present invention provides a reinforcing tape composed of a reinforcing layer and an adhesive layer and characterized by using for the adhesive layer a hot-meIt adhesive having a melt ing point in the range of 11CT to 120V and a melt viscosity at 200V  in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 poises.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the reinforcement of the end portion of a fastener tape of a slide fastener.   One embodiment of this method is characterized by attaching a reinforcing layer formed of resin film to the end portion of a fastener tape of a siide fastener through the medium of an adhesive  layer  formed of a hot-meIt  adhesive having a melting point in the range of 110" to 120V and a melt viscosity at 200 C  in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 poises by dint  of  ultrasonic  heating  and  application  of  pressure. Another embodiment thereof is characterized by effecting the attachment of a reinforcing layer formed of plain weave fibers through the medium of an adhesive layer formed of the hot-melt adhesive mentioned above by dint of heat and pressure exerted by a hot plate.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
When a reinforcing tape is attached to a fastener tape by<br><br>
using for an adhesive layer a high melting and high viscosity hot-meIt adhesive manifesting a melting point in the range of 130 to 140V and a melt viscosity at 200V in the range of 4,000 to 6,000 poises as mentioned above, a product furnished with the fastener tape, on being laundered or dry cleaned, incurs the problem that the reinforcing tape and the fastener tape suffer a decline of their peel strength and tend to separate easily.<br>
The present inventor has made a diligent study concerning this phenomenon and consequently found that the decline of the peeling  strength  after  laundering  or  dry  cleaning  occurs because the melt viscosity of the hot-melt adhesive is unduly high and, as a result, the hot-meIt adhesive, while mediating adhesion between the reinforcing tape and the fastener tape, encounters  difficulty  in penetrating  the  interstices  of  the fibers  of  the  fastener  tape  and  fails  to produce a  fully satisfactory anchoring effect.   The inventor,  therefore,  has continued a study regarding the relation between such anchoring effect and the behavior of the hot-me1t adhesive serving as the adhesive  layer  and  consequently  found  that  the  hot-me1t adhesive requires its melting point and melt viscosity to fall in respective specific ranges to mani fest a complete anchoring effect.  The present invention has been perfected as a result.<br>
Specifically,  the  present  invention  features  use  of  a hot-me11  adhesive manifesting a me1 ting point  in the  range of 110  to 120 V  and a melt viscosity at 200V  in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 poises for the adhesive layer of the reinforcing tape.   When the hot-melt adhesive having such relatively low<br>
c<br><br>
melting point and low viscosity is used for the adhesive layer, it easily melts during the attachment of the reinforcing tape to the fastener tape rby simultaneous application of heat and pressure,   the  molten  resin  consequently  produced  easily penetrates the interst ices of the fibers of the fastener tapes, and the resin,  on being cooled and hardened,  continues  its existence between the fibers and manifests a high anchoring effect.   A product which is furnished with the fastener tape having  its  end  portion  reinforced  as  described  above, therefore, maintains high peel strength between the reinforcing tape and the fastener tape even after the product has been laundered or dry cleaned.<br>
The reinforcing tape contemplated by the present invention differs from the conventional reinforcing tape in requiring use of the characteristic hot-meIt adhesive mentioned above for the adhesive layer, but does not need to be different therefrom in any of the other component requirements.  Resin films such as, for  example,  films,  multilayer  films,  and  fiber-reinforeed films of synthetic resin and plain weave fibers (taffeta) can be used for the reinforcing layer.<br>
According to the inventor's study,  however,  it has been found that  the optimum heat source varies with the type of reinforcing layer to be used and that it is ultrasonic wave in the case of a resin film or a heater (hot plate) in the case of plain weave fibers.<br>
When the reinforcing tape is bonded to the fastener tape by simultaneou
 <br>
the   reinforcing  tape  and  the  fastener  tape  where  the reinforcing layer is formed of resin film (or further between the adhesive layer and a reinforcing layer where the adhesive layer is appl ied to the fastener tape and then the reinforcing layer  is  superposed  thereon)  and  impai r  the  appearance  as described  above.    This  entry  of  bubbles  may  be  logically explained by a supposition that the fastener tape of a fabric produced by weaving or knitting synthetic  fibers or natural fibers has an undulating surface and, when the reinforcing tape of flat surface is applied to such undulating surface, the air entrapped  between  the  depressions  in  the  surface  of  the fastener tape and the reinforcing tape are 1iable to persist as bubbles.    According  to  the  inventor's  study,  it  has  been found that this problem can be eliminated by using ultrasonic wave as a heat source.<br>
As respects the step for effecting the attachment by the use of the ultrasonic wave, first the adhesive layer is interposed between the fastener tape and the reinforcing tape and then these tapes are nipped and compressed between an anvil and a horn. Subsequently, the superposed layers are made to generate heat by exposure to ultrasonic vibration until the tapes are joined. Thereafter, the ultrasonic vibration is stopped and the anvil and the horn are cooled as held in a state compressing the fastener tape and the reinforcing tape.<br>
According to such step of attachment, since the anvil and the horn jointly keep the fastener tape and the reinforcing tape nipped and compressed therebetween until the adhesive agent  fixes  the  fastener  tape  and  the  reinforcing  tape<br><br>
completely to each other by adhesion and further since the anvil and the horn keep the fastener tape and the reinforcing tape exposed to ultrasonic vibration and meanwhile nipped and compressed therebetween, the bubbles are gradually expelled from between the tapes by the vibration. As a result, the entry of bubbles between the fastener tape and the reinforcing tape (adhesive layer) occurs only with difficulty.<br>
Further, this step of attachment allows manufacture of a fastener product excelling in appearance because the molten resin attains easy entry between the fibers of the fastener tape, enhances the adhesive strength of the reinforcing tape to the fastener tape, and enables itself to cool and solidify within a die as well. The ultrasonic wave used as a heat source brings about the advantage of enjoying an increase in the cooling rate and improvement in productivity as compared with the hot plate as a heat source.<br>
For the purpose of precluding the entry of bubbles between the adhesive layer and the reinforcing layer during the step of attachment, the procedure which comprises preparing a one-piece reinforcing tape having an adhesive layer superposed in advance on a reinforcing layer and then attaching this reinforcing tape to the fastener tape proves to be a preferable practice.<br>
In contrast, when the reinforcing layer is formed of plain weave fibers (taffeta), the hot plate is preferred as a heating means over the ultrasonic wave because the ultrasonic wave has the possibility of embrittling the plain weave fibers.<br>
When  the  reinforcing  layei  is  formed  of  plain  weave fibers,  since the fibers themselves are virtually devoid of<br><br>
rigidity, the rigidity of the adhesive layer is preferred to be higher for the sake of improving the workability of the step of attachment than when the reinforcing layer uses a resin film. The hardness of the adhesive layer is preferred to exceed a level of about 40 on the Shore Hardness Scale.<br>
Now, the present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to the drawings annexed hereto.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates one example of the construction of a reinforcing tape 2 fixed to the end portion of a fastener tape 1 of a slide fastener according to the present invention. The reinforcing tape 2 is constructed by superposing a reinforcing layer 4 on the fastener tape 1 through the medium of an adhesive layer 3.<br>
The construction, as depicted in Fig. 1, has the reinforcing tape 2 superposed on only one side of the fastener tape 1. Of course, this superposition may be made on both sides of the fastener tape 1 . Generally, it is made on both the obverse and the reverse side.<br>
The reinforcement of the end portion of the fastener tape 1 may be carried out by applying the adhesive layer 3 to the surface  of  the  end  portion  of  the  fastener  tape  1,  then superposing the reinforcing layer 4 on the adhesive layer 3, and joining the superposed layers by simultaneous application of heat and pressure.  It is, however, effected preferably by a procedure which,  as described above,  comprises preparing the reinforcing tape 2 having the reinforcing layer 4 coated on one side thereof with the adhesive layer 3 by the known technique<br>
c<br><br>
of  superposition  such  as,  for example,  the  dry  laminating technique or coextruding technique and bonding this reinforcing tape 2 to the surface of the end portion of the fastener tape 1 through the medium of the adhesive layer 3 by simultaneous application of heat and pressure.  Though such heating means as a hot plate, ultrasonic wave, or high frequency are available for the use of heat in the simultaneous application of heat and pressure,  it  is preferred to use ultrasonic wave where the reinforcing layer is  formed of resin film or a hot plate (heater) where it is formed of plain weave fibers (taffeta) as described above.<br>
The hot-melt adhesive for the adhesive layer 3 is not particularly limited by kind but is only required to manifest a melting point  in  the  range of   110° to  120°C  and a melt viscosity at 200*0  in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 poises as mentioned above.   It is, however, preferred to be a hot-meIt adhesive having affinity for the material of the fastener tape 1,  particularly a hot-meIt adhesive using resin of the same type as  the  raw material of the fastener tape.   When the material  of  the  fastener  tape  is  nylon,  for  example,  the polyamide hot-melt adhesive having as the base polymer thereof a low melting transparent nylon copolymer of at least three components obtained by copolymerizing such monomers as nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 610, and nylon 612 can be advantageously used. When the material of the fastener tape 1 is polyester fibers, the polyester hot-melt adhesive having as  the base polymer thereof a transparent polyester copolymer can be advantageously used.<br><br>
The thickness of the adhesive layer 3 is proper generally in the range of 30 to 120 μ m, preferably in the approximate ■ range of 50 to 70 μm.<br>
For the reinforcing layer 4, films and plain weave fibers (taffeta) of various thermoplastic elastomers and thermoplastic resins  such  as  of  poly amides  like  nylon  6  and  nylon  56 generally used for the surface 1ayer of the reinforcing tape or polyesters like polyethylene terephthai ate (PET ) ,  poiybutylene terephthalate  (PBT),  and PET/PBT polymer alloy can be used. Particularly, thermoplastic elastomers are preferably used as materials for the reinforcing layer in terms of flexibility. As  the  thermoplastic elastomer,  the  polyester  thermoplastic elastomers  and polyamide thermoplastic elastomers heretofore known to the art are preferably used.   Besides,  polyolefin thermoplastic   elastomers   and   fluorocarbon   thermoplastic elastomers  are usable.    Further,  the  fiber-reinforeed  film having the transparent film layer of a thermoplastic elastomer or  thermoplastic  resin  superposed  on  one  or  both  of  the opposite surfaces of a fiber reinforcement layer can be used. For the fiber reinforcement layer,  a reticular sheet  (mesh) formed of monofilaments of thermoplastic resin or a thin-layer nonwoven fabric of thermoplastic resin  fibers  (a very thin sheet having component fibers not fixed by adhesion) can be advantageously used.  The presence of such fiber reinforcement layer allows retention of satisfactory flexibility, compensates the film for the defect of vulnerability to twist or lateral pui1,  and ensures acquisition of high torsional strength and high transverse tensile strength.  Particularly, the use of the<br><br>
thermoplast ic elastomer as the material for the transparent film layer ensures acquisition of 'high flexibility. Incidentally, it is preferable to use thermoplastic resins of the same type for the raw materials of the transparent film layer and fiber reinforcement layer.<br>
When the reinforcing layer is formed of resin film,  it is preferable from the viewpoint of the resistance to the heat of a pressing i ron to use a thermoplastic resin having a softening point of not lower than 170 v   ,<br>
The  thickness  of  the  rei nforcing . layer  4  is  proper generally in the range of 50 to 200 \\  m.  When the reinforcing 1 ayer is formed of a laminate of fiber reinforcement layer and transparent film layer(s), the thickness of a transparent film layer  as  the  surface  layer  I s  preferred  to  be  in  the approximate  range of  50  to  I 50,-. m and  the  thickness  of  a transparent  film  layer  as  the  lower  layer  to  be  in  the approximate range of 20 to 50 ( m.   If these transparent film layers have unduly large thicknesses, their excesses will bring about the disadvantage of increasing the total thickness of the reinforcing  tape  and  decreasing  the  flexibility  of  the reinforcing tape.<br>
When the fiber reinforcement layer is formed of a reticular sheet, the diameter of the monofilaments making up the sheet is proper in the range of 50 - 120/j. m and the density in the longitudinal and the lateral direction is preferable in the approximate range of 20 to 70 monofilaments,/cm respectively, in contrast, when the fiber reintorcement layer is formed of a thin-layer non-woven fabric, the thickness thereof is preferred<br><br>
tc be in  the approximate range of 50 to 120  μm.   If the diameter of the monofilaments or the thickness1 of the thin layer non-woven fabric unduly exceeds the upper limit of the range  mentioned  above,   the   reinforcing   tape   has   the disadvantage  of  losing  flexibility and  tending  to  decrease transparency in spite of the advantage of gaining in torsional strength and transverse tensile strength.   I f the diameter or the thickness is smal ler than the lower limit of the range mentioned above, the reinforcing tape has the disadvantage of incurring difficulty in securing sufficient torsional strength and  transverse  tensile  strength.     The  diameter  of  the monof1laments making up the ret icular sheet or the thickness of the  thin  layer  non-woven^ fabric  and  the  dens ity  of  the f:laments  or  fibers  may  be  suitably  set  preferably  in  the relevant ranges mentioned above in due consideration of the thicknesses  of  the  transparent  film  layer  and  the  adhesive<br>
1	aver so as to balance such factors as strength,  flexibility,<br>
and transparency.<br>
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 each show the lower part of one example of a slide fastener 10 having the reinforcing tapes 2 0a and 20b of the present invention provided at the lower end portions of a pair of fastener tapes 11a and lib to which members of a pin-and-socket separator are attached.<br>
The si ide fastener 10 shown in Fig. 2 includes a pair of fastener tapes 1ia and lib, a pair of reinforcing tapes 20a and<br>
2	0b which are welded or bonded to the lower end port ions of the<br>
iespective  fastener  tapes  11a  and  lib,  rows  of  coupling e laments 12a and .1 2b,  such as spi ral coi 1 coupl ing elements,<br><br>
attached  to  the  i nner  longitudinal  edges of  the  respect ive fastener tapes 11a and l1b, a slider 13, and a pin-and-socket<br>
&gt;<br>
separator composed of an insertion member or butterfly bar 14, a box bar 15, and a box member 16, these members being secured to the inner edges of the reinforcing tapes 20a and 20b which are welded to the lower end portions of fastener tapes 11a and l1b. The slider 13 is slidably mounted on the rows of coupling elements 12a and 12b for engaging and disengaging the coupling elements 12a and 12b. Fig. 2 shows the slide fastener 10 in a closed state and Fig. 3 shows it in an  opened state.<br>
The fastener tapes 11a and l1b are manufactured by weaving or knitting a fibrous material formed of such synthetic fibers as polyester, nylon, etc. or such natural fibers as cotton.  To the lower end portions of the pair of fastener tapes 11a and 1 lb, the reinforcing tapes 20a and 20b are respectively welded or bonded through the medium of an adhesive layer as explained hereinbefore.  The butterfly bar 14 which is one of the fitting metal pieces for the pin-and-socket separator is secured to the inner edge of one,     20a, of the opposed reinforcing tapes and the box member 16 for admitting the butterfly bar 14 and the box bar 15 therefor are secured to the opposite inner edge of the other, 20b, of the reinforcing tapes.  The butterfly bar 14 is releasably engageable in a slot in the box member 16.  The box member 16 and the box bar 15 are integrally molded as one piece.<br>
In the manner described above, the end port ions of the fastener tapes 11a and l1b die reinforced by the application thereto with high adhesive strength of the reinforcing tapes<br>
c<br><br>
2 0a and 2 0b possessing such transparency or translucency as to al low the color of the fastener tapes to be seen therethrough and excel11ng in flexibility.   Since the reinforcing tapes 20a and 2 0b are nearly t ransparent as a whole, they allow the color of  the  fastener  tapes  11a  and  lib  to  be  directly  seen therethrough.      Since   the   reinforcing   tapes   appear   in essentially the same color as the dyed fastener tapes,  they will not impair the appearance of the fastener tapes.   The reinforcing tape of one kind,  therefore,  can be applied to fastener tapes of varying colors.  For the purpose of allaying the surface gloss of the reinforcing tape or augmenting the flexibility thereof,  the reinforcing layer in the surface of the  reinforcing  tape  may  be  knurled  after  or  during  the aDO1icat ion of heat and pressure. Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1, 2<br>
Samples were manufactured by superposing reinforcing tapes produced by laminating an adhesive layer on a varying resin film layer indicated in Table 1 below one each in the lateral di rect ion on the obverse and the reverse side of a slide fastener having the coupling elements thereof in a meshed state such that the adhesive layers contacted the surfaces and intersected the rows of coupling elements and then bonding the reinforcing tapes to the slide fastener by ultrasonic heating under pressure. The ultrasonic welding was carried out by the use of a 40-kHz ultrasonic wave oscillator, with the air pressure set at 4.0 kg/cm2, the temperature of the die heater at 50 '.: (found level 60"C ), the distance between the horn and die at 0.45 mm, and the oscillation time at 0.6 seconds.<br><br><br><br>
laundering was performed up to five repetitions by following the Method A-4 for laundering test specified in JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) L 0844 "Testing Methods for Color Fastness to Washing and Laundering."  The dry cleaning was performed by carrying out up to five repetitions the series of steps of washing a given sample for three minutes at room temperature in a detergent produced by dissolving soap in perchloroethylene, rinsing the washed sample with perchloroethylene twice each for three  minutes,  draining  the  rinsed  sample  by  high-speed rotation for three minutes and meanwhile treating it by the use of an instrument sold under the trademark of "Spraymatic" (for the sake of preventing static electrification, conferring soft finish,  and furnishing protection against microbe and odor), then drying the treated sample at 70JC  for 15 minutes,  and further gradually cooling and drying it for five minutes.<br>
The peel strength of a given sample was determined by dividing the reinforcing tape in the sample into two halves a.l ong a cut inserted in the center of the meshed coupl ing elements and peel ing the right ha If of the reinforcing tape from the sample by pulling the right cut edge up and meanwhile measuring the strength required for peeling. The peel strength was determined on both obverse and reverse surface of the sample.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 4 through Fig. 6. It is clear from these diagrams that the peel strength of the sample of Example 1 shown in Fig. 4 which used an adhesive layer of low melting point and low melt viscosity was higher than the Deel strenath of the sample of Comparative Example 1 shown in<br><br>
F i cj. 5 and that of the sample of Comparative Example 2 shown in Fig.  6 : invariably pafter the adhesion,  after five rounds, of washing, and after five rounds of dry cleaning.   Incidentally, the standard for the peel st rength is 1,500 g/cm after adhesion<br>
i  and 1,000 g/cm both after washing and dry cleaning. Example 2 and   Comparative Example 3<br>
Samples were manufactured by preparing reinforcing tapes having an adhesive layer laminated on a resin film layer indicated  in Table 2  below and attaching these reinforcing<br>
i  tapes one each to the obverse and the reverse side of a slicte fastener having the coupling elements thereof kept in a meshed state by simul taneous appl icat ion of heat and pressure by the use of a heater as a heat source.  These samples were laundered five times and dry cleaned five times,  and thereafter tested<br>
i for peel strength in the same manner as in Example 1 mentioned above. The temperature of the heater was set at 165T in Example 2 and at 185C  in Comparative Example 3.<br>
i <br><br>
The results are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.   It is clear from these diagrams that the peel strength of the sample of Example 2 shown in Fig. 7 which used an adhesive layer of low mel t ing point and low mel t viscosity was higher than the peel strength of the sample of Comparative Example 3 shown in Fig. 8 invariably after the adhesion,  after five rounds of washing, and after five rounds of dry cleaning.   It is also clear from Fig. 8 that the sample of Comparative Example 3 showed a large difference in adhesive force on the obverse and the reverse side thereof as evinced by the fact that the peel strength of the  reinforcing  tape  on  the  obverse  side  was  considerably weaker than that on the reverse side-  In contrast, it is noted that in the case of the sample of Example 2,  the reinforcing tapes were attached to the fastener tapes as well balanced on the obverse and the reverse side.<br>
The reinforcing tape of the present invention is composed of a reinforcing layer and an adhesive layer and the adhesive layer uses a low melting and low viscosity hot-melt adhesive mani festing a melting point in the range of 110" to 120"C and a melt viscosity at 200 (.' in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 poises as described above. Thus, the resin of the adhesive layer attains easy infiltration between the fibers of the fastener tape and produces an ample anchoring effect. The reinforcing tape of the present invention, therefore, can be attached with ample adhesive strength to the end portion of a fastener tape of a slide fastener and shows virtually no decline of peel strength even after being laundered or dry cleaned.<br><br>
In the at tachment of the reinforcing tape to the fastener tape by simultaneous application of heat and pressure, proper selection of a heating means in conformity with the material of the reinforcing layer results in preventing the fastener tape from suffering decline of appearance or strength after the attachment.  For example, when the reinforcing layer is formed of resin film,  the entry of bubbles between the reinforcing tape and the fastener tape can be precluded by using ultrasonic wave as a heat source.  When the reinforcing layer is formed of plain weave fibers, use of a hot plate (heater) as a heat source allows the attachment of the reinforcing tape to the fastener tape to be attained without inducing embrittlement of the plain weave fibers of the reinforcing layer.<br>
While certain specific embodiments and working examples have been disclosed herein, the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The described embodiments and examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as i1lust rative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are, therefore, intended to be embraced therein.<br><br><br><br><br>
