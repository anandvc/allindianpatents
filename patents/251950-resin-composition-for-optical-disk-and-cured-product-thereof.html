				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RESIN COMPOSITION FOR OPTICAL DISK AND<br>
CURED PRODUCT THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an<br>
ultraviolet-curable resin composition for optical<br>
disks, and a cured product thereof. Particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a next-generation high-<br>
density optical disk which is low in water absorption<br>
and cure shrinkage of the cured product and excellent<br>
in transparency and durability.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Optical disk recording media which are now<br>
put to practical use are CD (compact disk), MO<br>
(magneto-optical disk) , CD-R (recordable compact disk),<br>
CD-RW (rewritable compact disk), etc. In these<br>
recording media, a recording film and a reflective film<br>
are formed on a polycarbonate substrate of 1.2 mm<br>
thick, and a protective layer comprising an<br>
ultraviolet-curable coating agent is provided for the<br>
purpose of protecting the above films from external<br>
causes. Recently, for further improvement of storage<br>
capacity, a recording medium has been developed which<br><br>
comprises two laminated substrates with the thickness<br>
of the polycarbonate being 0.6 mm which is half the<br>
thickness in conventional recording media. By<br>
employing such a construction, there are practically<br>
used DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+R, DVD+RW, etc. which<br>
have solved the problems of birefringence of<br>
polycarbonate substrates and reduction of laser spot<br>
diameter. In all of these recording media, a recording<br>
film, a reflective film, and the like are formed on a<br>
polycarbonate substrate of 0.6 mm, and an ultraviolet-<br>
curable protective layer or adhesive layer is provided<br>
for the purpose of protection or adhesion as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
[0003]<br>
However, DVD recording media are still<br>
insufficient in capacity as recording media for<br>
attaining large capacity in the times of digital<br>
broadcasting. Thus, optical disks comprising a<br>
substrate on which a recording layer and a transparent<br>
layer of 100 µm are laminated are proposed and<br>
practically used as the next-generation high-density<br>
optical disks (Patent Document 1). In these optical<br>
disks, writing and reading are carried out with blue<br>
laser beams from the transparent cover layer side, and<br>
not from the polycarbonate substrate side.<br>
[0004]<br>
The methods for forming the cover layer<br>
includes a method of laminating a transparent layer of<br><br>
100 µm and a method of forming a layer of 100 µm on the<br>
recording layer using an ultraviolet-curable resin.<br>
For the formation of the ultraviolet-curable resin<br>
layer, 2P method and a spin coating method are<br>
proposed. As the ultraviolet-curable resin formed on<br>
the recording film, there are proposed, for example, 2P<br>
agents such as compositions disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 2 and Patent Document 3. Furthermore, there<br>
are proposed protective coating agents such as<br>
compositions disclosed in Patent Document 4, Patent<br>
Document 5 and Patent Document 6.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problem to be solved by the Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
However, the conventional ultraviolet-curable<br>
resin compositions are high in cure shrinkage.<br>
Therefore, if these resin compositions are used as the<br>
transparent cover layer of high-density optical disks<br>
for a long time, a large warpage occurs (insufficiency<br>
in durability).<br><br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0007]<br>
As a result of intensive research conducted<br>
by the inventors, a resin composition suitable for<br>
solving the above problems has been found.<br>
That is, the present invention has the<br>
following attributes.<br>

comprising: a polyurethane compound (A) produced by<br>
reacting an epoxycarboxylate compound (c), which is<br>
produced by reacting an epoxy compound (a) having two<br>
or more epoxy groups in a molecule with a<br>
monocarboxylic acid compound (b) having an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated group in a molecule, with a<br>
diisocyanate compound (d); a photopolymerization<br>
initiator (B); and an ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compound (C) other than the compound (A).<br>
(2)	The resin composition for optical disks<br>
described in the above (1) which is a protective<br>
coating agent for optical disk.<br>

resin composition for optical disks described in the<br>
above (1) or (2) .<br>
(4)	The cured product described in the above<br>
(3) which has a water absorption measured at 25°C of<br>
2.0% or lower and a cure shrinkage of 6% or lower.<br><br>
(5)	The cured product described in the above<br>
(3) or (4) which has a transmittance of 70% or higher<br>
for blue laser of a wavelength of 405 nm at a film<br>
thickness of 100+10 µm of the cured product.<br>
(6)	An optical disk having a layer of the<br>
cured product described in any one of the above (3)-<br>
(5)	.<br>
(7)	The optical disk described in the above<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0009]<br>

alone or in admixture of two or more.<br>
[0019]<br>
The polyurethane compound (A) used in the<br>
resin composition of the present invention is produced<br>
in the following manner. That is, first, an<br>
epoxycarboxylate compound (c) having an alcoholic<br>
hydroxyl group is produced by the reaction of the epoxy<br>
compound (a) having two or more epoxy groups in the<br>
molecule with the monocarboxylic acid compound (b)<br>
having an ethylenically unsaturated group in the<br><br>
molecule (hereinafter referred to as "first reaction").<br>
Then, the epoxycarboxylate compound (c) is subjected to<br>
urethanation reaction with the diisocyanate compound<br>
(d) (hereinafter referred to as "second reaction"),<br>
whereby the polyurethane compound (A) can be obtained.<br>
When the commercially available epoxycarboxylate<br>
compound (c) mentioned above is used, it can be<br>
obtained only by the second reaction.<br>
[0020]<br>
The first reaction can be carried out without<br>
using solvent or in a solvent having no alcoholic<br>
hydroxyl group. Specifically, the reaction can be<br>
carried out, for example, in one or mixed organic<br>
solvents of ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone and cyclohexanone; aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene and tetramethylbenzene; glycol<br>
ethers such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene<br>
glycol diethyl ether, dipropylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether, dipropylene glycol diethyl ether, triethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether and triethylene glycol diethyl<br>
ether; esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate,<br>
methylcellosolve acetate, ethylcellosolve acetate,<br>
butylcellosolve acetate, carbitol acetate, propylene<br>
glycol monomethyl ether acetate, dialkyl glutarate,<br>
dialkyl succinate and dialkyl adipate; cyclic esters<br>
such as y-butyrolactone; petroleum solvents such as<br>
petroleum ether, petroleum naphtha, hydrogenated<br>
petroleum naphtha and solvent naphtha; and, besides,<br><br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds (C) mentioned<br>
hereinafter.<br>
[0021]<br>
As to the charging ratio of the starting<br>
materials in the reaction, it is preferred that the<br>
amount of the monocarboxylic acid compound (b) having<br>
an ethylenically unsaturated group in the molecule is<br>
0.8-1.2 equivalent amount per 1 equivalent amount of<br>
the epoxy group of the epoxy compound (a) having two or<br>
more epoxy groups in the molecule. If the ratio is<br>
outside the above range, there is the possibility of<br>
causing gelation in the second reaction.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the first reaction, it is preferred to use<br>
a catalyst for acceleration of the reaction. The<br>
amount of the catalyst used is preferably 0.1-10% by<br>
weight based on the reactants. The reaction<br>
temperature is preferably 60-150°C and the reaction time<br>
is preferably 5-60 hours. Specific examples of the<br>
catalyst used are triethylamine, benzyldimethylamine,<br>
triethylammonium chloride, benzyltrimethylammonium<br>
bromide, benzyltrimethylammonium iodide,<br>
triphenylphosphine, triphenylstibine,<br>
methyltriphenylstibine, chromium octanoate, zirconium<br>
octanoate, etc. Furthermore, it is preferred to use<br>
hydroquinone monomethyl ether, 2-methylhydroquinone,<br>
hydroquinone, diphenylpicrylhydrazine, diphenylamine,<br>
3,5-ditertiary-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene, etc. as a<br><br>
thermal polymerization inhibitor. The first reaction<br>
is conducted while optionally carrying out sampling and<br>
terminated when oxidation of the sample reaches 1<br>
mg.KOH/g or less, preferably 0.5 mg.KOH/g or less.<br>
[0023]<br>
The second reaction is an urethanation<br>
reaction of the epoxycarboxylate compound (c) obtained<br>
after completion of the first reaction or the<br>
commercially available epoxycarboxylate compound (c)<br>
with diisocyanate compound (d) with gradually adding<br>
the diisocyanate compound (d). In the second reaction,<br>
as for the relationship of equivalents between the<br>
epoxycarboxylate compound (c) and the diisocyanate<br>
compound (d), they are charged in such a relationship<br>
of equivalents that all the isocyanate groups are lost<br>
after the reaction (the molar ratio OH group/NCO group<br>
&gt; 1). When the charging ratio is increased,<br>
concentration of the urethane bond decreases to cause<br>
reduction in characteristics as polyurethane compound.<br>
On the other hand, when the charging ratio is lowered,<br>
the molecular weight of the resulting polyurethane<br>
compound increases, and the operability is sometimes<br>
deteriorated due to the high viscosity. Specifically,<br>
the ratio is preferably such that NCO group of the<br>
diisocyanate compound (d) is in 0.1-0.9 mol per 1.0 mol<br>
of OH group of the epoxycarboxylate compound (c).<br>
[0024]<br>
The second reaction can also be carried out<br><br>
without using solvent. Moreover, it can be carried out<br>
in one or mixed organic solvent of the above-mentioned<br>
solvents having no alcoholic hydroxyl group, and<br>
ethylenically unsaturated compounds (C) mentioned<br>
hereinafter. Moreover, the above thermal<br>
polymerization inhibitor may be further added.<br>
[0025]<br>
The reaction temperature in the second<br>
reaction is usually 30-150°C, preferably 50-100°C. The<br>
end point of the reaction is confirmed by the decrease<br>
of the amount of isocyanate. Furthermore, a catalyst<br>
may be added for the purpose of reducing the reaction<br>
time. As the catalyst, either of a basic catalyst or<br>
an acidic catalyst is used. Examples of the basic<br>

Test Examples<br>
The following properties of the films<br>
obtained in the above Examples and Comparative Example<br>
were evaluated by the following methods, and the<br>
results are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0051]<br>
(Pencil hardness)<br>
Pencil hardness of the coat film was measured<br>
by scratching with a pencil in accordance with JIS K<br>
5400 (unit: H, and the higher the value obtained, the<br>
higher the hardness). That is, the film to be measured<br>
was scratched in a length of about 5 mm with a pencil<br><br>
at an angle of 45° under a load of 1 kg applied from<br>
above, and the state of scratch marks was examined.<br>
[0052]<br>
(Tensile test)<br>

cm, and the following data were measured using<br>
Tensilon.<br>

the present invention give tough films which can<br>
elongate with maintaining surface curability and high<br>
young's modulus and stress at break.<br>

results are shown in Table 3. The "part" in Table 3 is<br>
"part by weight". Evaluations of the properties were<br>
conducted by the following methods.<br>
[0056]<br>
(Viscosity)<br>
The viscosity measured by B-type viscometer<br>
(measured at 25°C in accordance with JIS K-7117) is<br>
taken as standard.<br>
(Cure shrinkage)<br>
The cure shrinkage is a value calculated by<br>
the following formula (1) from the liquid specific<br>
gravity at 25°C before curing and the film specific<br>
gravity at 25°C obtained by curing.<br>
Cure shrinkage = (film specific gravity -<br>
liquid specific gravity)/film<br>
specific gravity x 100 (1)<br>
[0057]<br>
(Water absorption)<br>
This is obtained by the method in accordance<br>
with JIS K-7209 7.2.1.<br>
(Transmittance)<br>
The resin is coated at a thickness of<br>
100±10 µm on a polycarbonate substrate by spin coating<br>
and cured with UV, and thereafter a transmittance for<br>
blue laser of 405 nm is measured using the<br><br>
polycarbonate substrate as a reference.<br>
[0058]<br>
(Warpage)<br>
A DVD substrate sputtered with aluminum is<br>
used. The composition shown in Table 1 is coated on<br>
the aluminum-sputtered DVD substrate by a spin coater<br>
to form a coat of 100 µm in average thickness. The<br>
coat is cured with an amount of energy in an integrated<br>
light volume of 1000 mJ/cm2 by an UV irradiator (CS-30L<br>
manufactured by Japan Storage Battery Co., Ltd.; 80<br>
w/cm high pressure mercury lamp) in which the lamp is<br>
set at a height of 10 cm. The resulting test piece is<br>
left to stand for 24 hours and then put on a glass<br>
plate to conduct evaluation on warpage.<br>
O: Substantially no warpage is seen.<br>
A: When one side of the test piece is pressed<br>
with a finger, another side is raised by less than 2<br>
mm.<br>
X: when one side of the test piece is pressed<br>
with a finger, another side is raised by 5 mm or more.<br>
[0059]<br>
(Durability)<br>
The test piece used in the evaluation of<br>
warpage is left to stand under an environment of 80°C<br>
and 85%RH for 500 hours. The state of the reflective<br>
film is visually observed.<br>
O: No change is seen in the reflective film<br>
all the time just after coating.<br><br>
A: Some discoloration or pin holes are seen<br>
in the reflective film.<br>
X: Much discoloration or many pin holes are<br>
seen in the reflective film.<br><br><br><br>

A substrate sputtered with silver alloy in 20<br>
nm as a translucent reflective film and a substrate<br>
sputtered with aluminum in 50 nm as a total reflective<br>
film were used for a two-1ayer DVD-ROM substrate to<br>
which a pit was previously transferred. Each of the<br>
ultraviolet curable composition of Example 10 and<br>
Comparative Example 3 was sandwiched between the<br>
surfaces of the two different reflective films so as to<br>
give a thickness of 45 µm by spin coating, followed by<br>
irradiation with light of 1000 mJ/cm2 from a metal<br>
halide lamp from the side of the translucent reflective<br>
film to carry out adhesion by curing to obtain a 2-<br>
layer DVD for test.<br>
These 2-1ayer DVDs were evaluated on the<br>
following properties, and the results are shown in<br>
Table 4. The "part" in the table is "weight part".<br>
Ultraviolet curable resin compositions as shown in<br>
Table 4 were prepared by conventional process.<br>
Evaluation of the properties were conducted by the<br>
following methods.<br><br>
[0064]<br>
(Durability)<br>
The DVD was left to stand under an<br>
environment of 80°C and 85%RH for 96 hours, and then at<br>
room temperature for 24 hours. Evaluation of<br>
durability of DVD was conducted by measuring PISum8 at<br>
the three points of 24 mm, 38 ram, 56 mm in radius of<br>
the silver alloy reflective layer of the disk using<br>
DVDCATS SA3000 (manufactured by Audio Dev Co., Ltd.) as<br>
a tester, and the average value was used as a measured<br>
value. Moreover, using the measured value, the<br>
increment of PI was calculated by the following<br>
formula.<br>
Increment of PI = (the measured value after<br>
left to stand at 80°C and 85%RH for 96 hours) - (the<br>
measured value just after adhesion)<br>
In the present invention, the increment of PI<br>
by 100 or less was judged to be acceptable.<br>
(Light resistance)<br>
DVD was placed under a fluorescent lamp at a<br>
distance of 10 cm with the silver alloy side of the DVD<br>
facing the fluorescent lamp, and was left to stand for<br>
1 week. Evaluation of light resistance of the DVD was<br>
conducted by measuring R14H (reflectance) at the three<br>
points of 24 mm, 38 mm, 56 mm in radius of the silver<br>
alloy reflective layer of the disk using DVDCATS SA3000<br>
(manufactured by Audio Dev Co., Ltd.) as a tester, and<br>
the average value obtained was used as a measured<br><br>
value. Moreover, using the measured value, the<br>
decrement of reflectance was calculated by the<br>
following formula.<br>
Decrement of reflectance = (the measured<br>
value after left to stand for 1 week) - (the measured<br>
value just after adhesion)<br>
In the present invention, decrease of<br>
reflectance by -4% or more was judged to be acceptable.<br><br>
SR306H: Tripropylene glycol diacrylate (manufactured by<br>
Sartomer Co., Ltd.)<br>
LUCIRIN TPO: 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine<br>
oxide (manufactured by BASF Co., Ltd.)<br><br>
[0066]<br>
Comparison of Example 10 with Comparative<br>
Example 3 reveals that properties of DVD of Example 10<br>
using A-4 as the component (C) were superior in the<br>
durability test and light resistance test.<br>
Furthermore, from the result, it can be seen that the<br>
cured products of the present invention are useful not<br>
only for DVD, but also for HD DVD using blue laser.<br>
