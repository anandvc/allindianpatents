				<td>NEW CYTOTOXIC DEPSIPEPTIDES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new depsipeptide compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as antitumoural agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several cyclic peptides obtained from marine organisms have been disclosed (see for example Rudi A. et al, J. Nat. Prod., 2003, 66, 575-577: "Didmolamide A and B, two new cyclic hexapeptides from the marine Ascidian Didemnum moZZe"). (Figure Remove)<br>
JP 11180997 discloses an antitumour compound of formula<br><br>
which is obtained from Streptomyces nobiiis.   Its ICso in Hela S3 cells is 14 nM.<br>
Cancer is a leading cause of death in animals and humans. Several efforts have been and are still being undertaken in order to obtain an antitumour agent active and safe to be administered to patients suffering from a cancer. The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide compounds that are useful in the treatment of cancer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds of general formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, prodrugs or stereoisomers thereof:<br>
(Figure Remove)wherein<br>
Ri groups are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, cyano, hydroxyl, nitro, azido, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkylidene, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group and  substituted or<br>
unsubstituted acyl;<br>
Ra groups are each independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen,   halogen,   cyano,   hydroxyl,   nitro,   azido,   substituted   or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted<br>
or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group<br>
and substituted or unsubstituted acyl;<br>
R4 groups are each independently selected from NR2, O and S; and<br>
Ra groups are each independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen,     substituted    or    unsubstituted    alkyl,     substituted    or<br>
unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy and substituted<br>
or unsubstituted acyl.<br>
The present invention also relates to the obtaining of the compounds of formula I, including the compound we call IB-01211 which is of formula:<br>
(Figure Remove)IB-01211 can be obtained from a strain of microorganism capable of producing it.        The  preferred  process comprises  the  steps  of<br><br>
cultivating a strain of microorganisms capable of producing IB-01211 in an aqueous nutrient medium with assimilable carbon and nitrogen sources and salts, under controlled submerged aerobic conditions, and then recovering and purifying the compound from the cultured broth.<br>
Other compounds of this invention can be derived from IB-01211, or can be made by synthesis. Thus, the oxazole/thiaz»le/imidazole fragment of the compounds of the present invention can be synthesised by using the teaching of the following literature: Panek J. S. et al "Studies directed toward the synthesis of Ulapualide A. Asymmetric Synthesis of the C8-C25 tris-oxazole fragment" J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 6496-6497; Panek J. S. et al "Studies directed toward the total synthesis of kabiramide C: asymmetric synthesis of the C7-C19 fragment" Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 6143-6146; Panek J. S. et al "Synthesis of the fully functionalized tris-oxazole fragment found in metabolites derived from marine organisms" Tetrahedron Lett. 1997, 38, 5445-5448; Pattenden G. "Synthetic studies with natural oxazoles and thiazoles" J. Heterocyclic Cliem. 1992, 29, 607-618; Pattenden G. et al "Synthesis of the tris-oxazole ring system of ulapualides" Synlett 1990, 36-37; Kiso Y. et al "Convergent synthesis of (-)-mirabazole C using a chloroimidazolidium coupling reagent, CIP" J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 3350-3357; Wipf P. et al "Total synthesis of (-)-thiangazole and structurally related polyazoles" J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 7224-7229; Wipf P. et al "A new synthesis of highly functionalised oxazoles" J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 3604-3606. Once the oxazole/thiazole/imidazole fragment is synthesised the aminoacidic fragment is introduced by using conventional methods of peptide synthesis already known by the skilled person in the art.<br>
Thus, compounds of formula I including IB-01211 can be made by coupling of the following components:<br>
(Figure Remove)where Ri, R2, Rs, R* are as defined, Prot°H is an optional protecting group for hydroxy, and Prot1™ is an optional protecting group for amino. As appropriate, the respective protecting groups can be replaced by other reactive groups to encourage the desired coupling, which typically takes place sequentially first to join the oxazole/thiazole/imidazole fragment to one end of the amino acidic fragement, and then to close the ring.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, prodrugs or stereoisomers thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is also directed to the use of compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, prodrugs or stereoisomers thereof in the treatment of cancer, or in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.<br>

One more preferred class of alkyl groups has 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, yet more preferably 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, and most preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms. Methyl, ethyl, propyl including isopropyl, and butyl including isobutyl, sec-butyl and terc-butyl are particularly preferred alkyl groups in the compounds of the present invention. As used herein, the term alkyl, unless otherwise modified, refers to both cyclic and noncyclic groups, although cyclic groups will comprise at least three carbon ring members.<br>
Alkylidene groups may be branched or unbranched and preferably have from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. One more preferred class<br>
of alkylidene groups has from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, yet more preferably from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, and most preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms. Methylidene, ethylidene and propylidene including isopropylidene are particularly preferred alkylidene groups in the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Preferred alkenyl and alkynyl groups in the compounds of the present invention have one or more unsaturated linkages and from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 2 to about 8 carbon atoms, still more prefereably 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, even more prefereably 1,2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms. The terms alkenyl and alkynyl as used herein refere to both cyclic and noncyclic groups, although straight or branched noncyclic groups are generally more preferred. In a general sense, we include alkylidene within alkenyl, they both being substituents with a. double bond.<br>
Suitable aryl groups in the compounds of the present invention include single and multiple ring compounds, including multiple ring compounds that contain separate and/or fused aryl groups. Typical aryl groups contain from 1 to 3 separated or fused rings and from 6 to about 18 carbon ring atoms. Specifically preferred aryl groups include substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, phenanthryl and anthracyl.<br>

Suitable halogen substituents in the compounds of the present invention include F, Cl, Br and I.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, prodrugs" refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, solvate, hydrate or any other compound which, upon administration to the patient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as described herein. However, it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of salts, prodrugs and derivatives can be carried out by methods known in the art.<br>
For instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are, for example, prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium and ammonium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine and basic aminoacids salts.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free compounds or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art.<br>
Any compound that is a prodrug of a compound of formula I is within the scope and spirit of the invention. The term "prodrug" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, for example,<br>
decompounds where a free hydroxy group is converted into an ester derivative.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented by the above described formula I may include enantiomers depending on their asymmetry or diastereoisomers. The single isomers and mixtures of the isomers fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are those of general formula<br>

This sequence was confronted with the Gene Bank depository using the<br>
Blastn algorithm. The phylogenetic studies were performed using the<br>
Phylip package developed by Felsenstein, J. dadistics 5:164, 1989. A<br>
consensus phylogenetic tree was constructed after bootstrapping the<br>
sample. Strain ES7-008 was grouped with the Thermoactinomyces<br>
group.	A differentiating trait of strain ES7-008 with<br>
Theimoactinomyces is a lack of aerial mycelium and the need of salt for growth.<br>
Fermentation:<br>
ES7-008 produces compound IB-01211 when it is cultured under controlled conditions in a suitable medium. This strain is preferably grown in an aqueous nutrient medium, under aerobic and mesophilic conditions, preferably at 28°C-40°C and at a pH ranging between 6.0<br><br>
and 8.0. A wide variety of liquid culture media can be used for the cultivation of the organism. Useful media are those that include an assimilable carbon source, such as starch, dextrin, sugar molasses, glucose, an assimilable nitrogen source such as protein, hydrolysed protein, defatted meals, corn steep, and useful inorganic anions and cations such a sodium, magnesium, potassium, ammonium, sulfate, chloride, phosphate, carbonate. Trace elements may be added also. Aeration is preferably achieved by supplying air to the fermentation medium. Agitation is provided by a mechanical impeller. Conventional fermentation tanks have been found to be well suited for carrying out the cultivation of this organism. The addition of nutrients and pH control as well as antifoaming agents during the different stages of fermentation may be needed for increasing production and avoiding foaming.<br>
Compound IB-01211 can be produced starting with a frozen lyophilized mycelium of ES7-008. A mycelial mass is obtained by culturing the initial cells in shake flasks with a culture medium containing some of the ingredients described above at mesophilic temperatures and in aerobic conditions. This step may be repeated several times as needed and the material collected will be used as an inoculum to seed one or several fermentation tanks with the appropriate culture medium. If it is desired these tanks can be used for developing the inoculum or for the production stage, depending on the broth volume needed. Sometimes the production medium may be different than the ones used for inoculum development. Typical media are disclosed that can be used for inoculum development and for production of IB-01211 are in the following table.<br>
(Table Remove) Production of IB-0121 1 can be monitored by whole broth assay against murine leukemia P-388 or by HPLC.<br>
Compound IB-01211 can be isolated from the mycelial cake by extraction with a suitable mixture of solvents such as CHClsrGHaOHrf^O. The activity is concentrated in the lower layer. The extracts from two repeated extraction can be combined and evaporated to dryness in vacua.<br>
Separation and purification of IB-01211 from the crude active extract can be performed using the proper combination of conventional chromatographic techniques.<br>
Fractionation can be guided by the antitumour activity of fractions, by TLC visualized with vanillin in concentrated H2SO4 or by analytical HPLC with photodiode-array and MS detector. HPLC analysis is performed at room temperature using an analytical column Symmetry CIS (5u) and a MeOH.-HaOrHOAc 95:5:1 mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3<br>
ml/min and plotted at 260 nm. In this conditions the IB-01211 retention time is 5.1 min as it is shown in Fig. 9.<br>
An important feature of the above described compounds is their bioactivity and in particular their cytotoxic activity. With this invention we provide novel pharmaceutical compositions of these compounds that possess cytotoxic activity and their use as antitumour agents. Thus the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, derivative, prodrug or stereoisomer thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid (tablets, pills, capsules, granules, etc.) or liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) suitable composition for oral, topical or parenteral administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention may be delivered by liposome or nanosphere encapsulation, in sustained release formulations or by other standard delivery means.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound of formula I along with a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, derivative, prodrug or stereoisomer and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, is found to exhibit surprising properties. Therefore the pharmaceutical composition is found to be synergistic.<br>

EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
Example 1: Production of IB-01211<br>
Inoculum development: a frozen culture of ES7-008 or a well grown slant culture (5% vol.) is used to seed 100 ml of a seed medium, as described in Table 1, that it is contained in a 250 ml shake flask. The flask is incubated during 48 h. A 2 1 Erlenmeyer flask with 500 ml of the same medium is seeded with 10% vol. of the first stage inoculum. The flask is incubated during 48h.<br>
Fermentation step: 50 1 of production medium, as described in Table 1, contained in a 75 1 fermentation tank are seeded with 2.5 1 of second stage inoculum. The fermentation is carried out during 96 h with 400 rpm agitation and an air flow of 0.5V/V.M.<br>
Example 2: Isolation of IB-01211<br>
8.5 liters of whole harvested broth were filtrated to separate the biomass and other solids. The mycelia cake was extracted twice with a mixture solvent (2.4 1) of CHC&amp;CHaOH'.ffeO (2:1:1). The activity was concentrated in the lower layer. The organic solvent was concentrated and evaporated to dryness in vacua to yield 4.8 g of crude extract.<br>
The extract was . applied to a silica gel VFC (vacuum flash<br>
chromatography) system, using a mixture of n-hexane-EtOAc and EtOAc-<br>
MeOH as eluting solvents. The fractions with antitumour activity,<br>
containing IB-01211 (900 mg) were eluted with EtOAc-MeOH 1:1, EtOAc-<br>
MeOH 1:3 and methanol. The active fractions were chromatographied<br>
twice with a silica gel column using CHCb-MeOH and EtOAc-MeOH<br>
mixtures as eluting solvents. The cytotoxic activity was detected in<br>
fractions eluted with CHCls-MeOH 96:4 in the first chromatography (200<br>
mg of pure compound IB-01211) and in fractions eluted with EtOAc-<br>
MeOH 85:15-8:2 in the second chromatography (60 mg of pure compound<br>
IB-01211).	Further purification with C18 reversed phase<br>
chromatography afforded 22 mg of pure compound IB-01211 eluted with MeOH.<br>
On the basis of detailed analysis of their various spectral characteristics, the pure compound was identified as IB-01211. The UV spectrum shows absorption at 225 nm, 265 rim and 290 nm as reported in Fig. 1. The infrared absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings. The XH NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT spectra of IB-01211 are reported in Fig.3, Fig.4 and Fig. 5, respectively. The 2D NMR experiments COSY, HMQC and HMBC are reported in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. The ES-MS spectrum of IB-01211 displays a (M+Na) peak at 731 as reported in Fig. 9. *H and 13C NMR data of compound IB-01211 are summarized in the following table.<br>

INHIBITION OF CEIL GROWTH BY COUNTING CELLS<br>
Tetrazolium Assay MTS is based on metabolic reduction of MTS to solubilized formazan crystals by the metabolically active mitochondria of living cells. For this reason, the methodology includes counting of the cell lines based on viability staining to ensure that cell concentrations are corrected to allow for 100% living cells into each well in lieu of Coulter counting or estimated dilutions based on standard growth curves.<br>
Medium containing drug was removed at the end of the treatment and culture plates rinsed one time with PBS. Afterward, cells were incubated in 200 jil of drug-free medium until 72 hours. After appropriate incubation time 25 jil of MTS+PMS solution was added to each microtiter well and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Plates were then removed from the incubator and placed on plate shaker for 5 minutes (covered for protection from light). Optical densities were read at 490nm on spectrophotometer plate reader. Data was analyzed using Softmax.<br>
Data is presented as ICso potencies calculated from 3rd order polynomial regression curves using Microsoft Excel and then manually interpolated.<br>

Example 4: Biological in vivo <br>
JW VIVO ANALYSIS OF IB-01211 IN HUMAN BREAST, COLON AND NON-SMALL CELL LUNG TUMOUR XENOGRAFTS<br>
Tumour Implantation<br>
At different times, three human tumour cell lines MX-1 (breast), HT-29 (colon), and LX-1 (non-small cell lung), respectively, were implanted subcutaheously into separate groups of recipient female athymic mice as a small seedling of approximately 2-3 mm3. Each tumour type was then allowed to grow inside the animal to reach a group mean size of 100 ± 15 mm3, at which time tumour-bearing mice were randomized into groups (Staging Day). The Staging Day also coincided with Day 0 for drug dosing.<br>
Frequency and Route of Administration of the Test Article<br>
The test article was administered as a single intravenous (iv) bolus injection (i.e., QDxl) on the Staging Day (Day 0).<br>
Tumour Measurements<br>
Tumour burden was determined for all animals throughout the study using a caliper, and the frequency was at least twice per week.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
Protocols and criteria for drug activity were derived from those established by the National Cancer Institute for tumour systems similar to those used in these studies (NIH Publication No. 84-2635, In vivo cancer models 1976-1982). Statistical analysis of tumour volumes for<br>
each group of drug treated animals was performed according to the Mann Whitney nonparametric test based on comparisons to the vehicle control cohort within the same experiment.<br>
Tumour lengths (L) and widths (W) were measured in millimeters (mm) using calipers, recorded, and tumour volume was calculated by the formula: Volume (mm3) - L x W2 x 0.5. Individual values were determined for each tumour-bearing athymic mouse and specified day of measurement (day £). On the tumour Staging Day (Day 0), the tumour volume of a treated animal (Tol) was subtracted from the corresponding tumour volume on each observation day (Tol). This provided the change (A) in tumour volume for the said treated athymic mouse (ATI = Tol - Tol). The change in tumour volumes for each member of the control cohort (AC) was calculated in a similar fashion as above.<br>
Results from tumour xenografts are tabulated below. At randomization (Day 0) the average volume of the tumour mass was 100 ±15 mm3 and the "net tumour growth" is really a difference between the size of the tumour on Day X and that on Day 0. The parameter S.E.M. is commonly used in statistics and stands for standard error of the mean in a distribution of N (size) experimental values.<br>
