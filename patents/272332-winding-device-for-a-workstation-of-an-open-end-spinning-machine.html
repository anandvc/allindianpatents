 <br>
 <br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a winding device for a workstation of an open-end spinning machine according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In the case of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, for example open-end spinning machines or winding machines, in conjunction with their winding devices, various types of cross-wound bobbin braking mechanisms are known and described in the patent literature. With braking mechanisms of this type, the cross-wound bobbins which are rotatably mounted in the creels of the winding devices should be able to be decelerated to a standstill as fast as possible, if necessary. A necessity of this type arises in a winding machine, for example, if during the winding process a thread break has occurred or if, because of a thread defect, a controlled clearer cut has been triggered.<br>
As described in EP 0 846 640 Bl, the workstations of such textile machines are equipped, for example, with a bobbin brake which can be actuated pneumatically, is integrated in the creel and allows a cross-wound bobbin, which is preferably lifted from its thread guide drum and rotates freely, to be decelerated to a standstill in the shortest time.<br>
Furthermore, workstations of winding machines are known from DE-OS 1 560 581, the winding devices of which are in each case equipped with a bobbin brake installed in the creel, and also with a braking plate which is mounted to be rotatable to a limited extent.<br>
The braking plate is, if necessary, pivoted from the rear over the thread guide drum and in the process lifts the rotating cross-wound bobbin from the thread guide drum. The cross-wound bobbin is thus decelerated to a standstill both by the braking plate and also by the bobbin brake integrated into the creel. However, in these known mechanisms, because of the use of the braking plates, in particular if<br>
2<br>
 <br>
the cross-wound bobbin has a high moment of inertia, relatively severe stressing of the outer thread layers of the cross-wound bobbin occurs and this may have a negative effect on the quality of the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
In open-end spinning machines, the workstations of which are serviced by a service unit automatically supplying the workstations, it has been conventional up to now to allow a cross-wound bobbin lifted from the rotating bobbin drive roller to simply run down to a standstill. In other words, the cross-wound bobbins of such textile machines run down to a standstill without an additional braking force being initiated. This method does not have a disadvantageous effect, in particular because open-end spinning machines of this type, compared to automatic cross-winding machines, work at significantly lower winding speeds, and the cross-wound bobbin of a workstation in need of service has generally already run down to a standstill when the requested service unit reaches the relevant workstation.<br>
The workstations of semi-automatic open-end spinning machines, in other words of open-end spinning machines, the workstations of which are manually made to start spinning by an operator, on the other hand, often have a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism. In other words, the workstations of open-end spinning machines of this type are equipped with a pivotably mounted braking plate which, for example, acted upon by a pneumatic cylinder, can be slid, if necessary, over the rotating bobbin drive roller and, in the process, does not only lift the cross-wound bobbin from the rotating bobbin drive roller, but also brakes the cross-wound bobbin to a standstill.<br>
In these textile machines, the thread end, which has run onto the surface of the cross-wound bobbin and is required to start the relevant workstation spinning again, then has to be manually picked up and prepared. For this purpose, the creel has to be simultaneously lifted and the cross-wound bobbin thus lifted from the braking plate, the cross-wound bobbin has to be rotated counter to the winding direction and the thread end which has run onto the surface of the cross-wound bobbin has to be<br>
3<br>
 <br>
searched for and picked up. The method described above is not only relatively laborious, but requires a certain amount of skill from the operating staff as three work operations have to be carried out practically simultaneously. In addition, when using braking plates of this type, as already indicated in conjunction with the braking mechanism according to DE-OS 1 560 581, there is always the risk of the outer winding layers of the cross-wound bobbin being severely stressed during the braking process and thus being damaged.<br>
Proceeding from the above-described prior art, the invention is based on the object of developing a winding device for the workstations of open-end spinning machines, in particular of semi-automatic open-end spinning machines, with a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism, which, on the one hand, brakes the cross-wound bobbins to a standstill, if necessary, in a manner which is protective of the windings and which, on the other hand, allows the thread end to be picked up and unwound in a problem-free manner from the surface of the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a winding device having the features described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The winding device according to the invention with a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism, which has a rotatably mounted braking roller, which can be set on the surface of the cross-wound bobbin in such a way that the cross-wound bobbin is raised and decelerated, in particular has the advantage that, on the one hand, the cross-wound bobbin can, if necessary, always be reliably lifted from the bobbin drive roller and can be braked to a standstill in a manner which is protective of the windings, but that, on the other hand, the decelerated cross-wound bobbin remains rotatable. In other words, the cross-wound bobbin is not only braked relatively gently, as this is carried out substantially in a rolling, and not a sliding manner, but the lifted cross-wound bobbin can then also be rotated without problems in the<br>
4<br>
 <br>
unwinding direction by the operating staff to pick up the thread end required for restarting spinning.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment that a mechanism which exerts a braking torque on the braking roller is associated with the braking roller. The rolling resistance of the braking roller and therefore the braking torque acting on the cross-wound bobbin can be adjusted by means of this mechanism. The mechanism itself, for example, has a brake lining, which acted upon by a brake spring, is set on the braking roller.<br>
With a mechanism of this type, the rolling resistance of the braking roller can be influenced in a relatively simple manner, for example by means of the selection of the brake springs.<br>
As shown in claim 3, the diameter of the braking roller is between 5 and 20 mm in an advantageous embodiment. A braking roller with such a comparatively small diameter, on the one hand, only has a small space requirement and moreover can easily be set froni below on the surface of the cross-wound bobbin in such a way that the cross-wound bobbin is reliably lifted from the bobbin drive roller which is rotating at an operating speed and is then decelerated in a rolling manner to a standstill.<br>
According to claims 4 and 5, the braking roller, to lift and decelerate the cross-wound bobbin, can either be slid under the cross-wound bobbin mounted in the creel and placed on the surface of the cross-wound bobbin or the braking roller is pivoted into its braking position. Which of the two possibilities is used, preferably depends on the installation space in the region of the winding devices which is provided by the design of the workstations of the semi-automatic open-end spinning machine.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
As described in claim 6, the braking roller may either be supported in roller bearings or in slide bearings. In other words, the rolling resistance of the braking roller therefore the braking torque acting on the cross-wound bobbin may also be influenced, at least to certain extent, by the choice of the mounting.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of a workstation of a semi-automatic open-end spinning machine with a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism in the region of the winding device,<br>
Fig. 2 shows to a larger scale, the winding device of the workstation shown in Fig. 1, during spinning operation, with a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism in the rest position,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the winding device according to Fig. 2 during deceleration of a cross-wound bobbin lifted from the bobbin drive roller by a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 4 shows an advantageous embodiment of a braking roller.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows one half of a semi-automatic open-end spinning machine, known per se, and designated with the reference numeral 1 <br>
Open-end spinning machines of this type, the workstations of which are made to start spinning manually by the operating staff, have, between end frames (not shown), in which the various central drives of the textile machine are arranged, a large number of similar workstations 2. The workstations 2 are in each case equipped with an open-end spinning device, a so-called spinning box 3 and a winding mechanism 4.<br>
6<br>
 <br>
In the spinning boxes 3, a fibre band 6 fed in spinning cans 5 is spun into a thread 7, in each case, which is then wound on the winding mechanism 4 into a cross-wound bobbin 8. As can be seen in particular from Figs. 2 and 3, the winding mechanisms 4 have a creel 9 for rotatably holding the cross-wound bobbin tube 10 of a cross-wound bobbin 8, a winding drive roller 11 to drive the cross-wound bobbin 8, a thread traversing mechanism 12 and a cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism 13 configured according to the invention. The open-end spinning machines 1 which are generally configured in two rows, also often have, between their rows of workstations, a bobbin transporting mechanism 14, by means of which completed cross-wound bobbins 8 are disposed of.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 to a larger scale, the cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism 13 is equipped with a rotatably mounted braking roller 15. The braking roller 15 arranged at the end on a corresponding holder 18 can, if necessary, as shown in Fig. 3, be set on the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8 and, in the process, lifts the cross-wound bobbin 8 from the bobbin drive roller 11 which continues to rotate. The braking roller 15 in the process simultaneously brakes the cross-wound bobbin 8 to a standstill in a manner protective of the windings.<br>
The braking torque which is initiated by the braking roller 15 on the rotating cross-wound bobbin 8, is produced here from the friction loses in the bearings 26 of the braking roller 15, from the air friction of the rotating parts and from the milling work, which the braking roller 15 performs on the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, shown, for example, in Fig. 4, the braking roller 15 may, however, also be acted upon with a braking torque by additional mechanisms 28,29.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the holder 18 carrying the braking roller 15 in the embodiment shown is mounted so as to be rotatable to a limited extent about a pivot<br>
7<br>
 <br>
pin 17 and can be adjusted by an activateabie actuator 19, for example a thrust piston drive between the rest position shown in Fig. 2 and the braking position shown in Fig. 3. The thrust piston drive 19, for this purpose, is connected to a compressed air source 22 by means of a pneumatic line 20 into which a valve 21, which can be. activated in a defined manner, is connected, the valve 21 being in turn connected by means of a control line 23 to a control mechanism 24 of the textile machine 1.<br>
The braking roller 15 shown sectionally in Fig. 4 consists, for example, of a cylinder liner 25 manufactured from steel, which preferably has a diameter of between 5 and 20 mm, and in which bearings 26 are in each case fastened at the end.<br>
The cylinder liner 25 is supported on bearing pins 27, which are fastened on the holder 18, by means of the bearings 26, which are either configured as roller bearings or as slide bearings.<br>
Braking elements 29, which increase the rolling resistance of the braking roller 15, can be set on the surface of the cylinder liner 25, for example by means of braking springs 28.<br>
Functioning of the cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism according to the invention:<br>
During regular spinning operation, which is shown in Fig. 2, the cross-wound bobbin 8 which is rotatably held in the creel 9, rests on the continuously driven bobbin drive roller 11 and is rotated thereby by means of frictional engagement.<br>
The thread 7 produced in the spinning box 3 is traversed here, while running onto the cross-wound bobbin 8, by a thread traversing mechanism 12.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism 13 according to the invention is not in operation at this time.    In other words, the valve 21, which is, for example,<br>
8<br>
 <br>
configured as an electromagnetic valve with the switching stages I and II, is in the switching stage I. In this switching stage, the thrust piston drive 19 is switched so as to be pressureless; the holder 18 with the braking roller 15 is in the rest position shown.<br>
In the event of a thread break or a controlled clearer cut, the thread end runs onto the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8 held in the creel 9 and to make the relevant workstation restart spinning, firstly has to be detached by the operating staff from the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8, appropriately cut to length and prepared for restarting spinning.<br>
For this purpose, the cross-wound bobbin 8 firstly has to be positioned adjacent to the rotating bobbin drive roller 11 and decelerated to a standstill in a manner which is as protective of the windings as possible. In other words, the electromagnetic valve 21 is activated by the control mechanism 24 by means of the control 23 in such a way that it slides into the switching position II in which the thrust piston drive 19 is pneumatically continuously connected to the compressed air source 22 by means of the pneumatic line 20. The extended piston rod of the thrust piston drive 19 thereupon pivots the holder 18 with the braking roller 15 in the direction of the cross-wound bobbin 8. The braking roller 15, after a short pivoting path, is placed from below on the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8 rotated by the bobbin drive roller 11 and lifts it from the bobbin drive roller 11. The braking roller 15 rolling on the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8 simultaneously ensures that the cross-wound bobbin 8 is decelerated to a standstill, in which context "decelerating" is expressly also to be taken to mean the deceleration of the cross-wound bobbin 8 as a result of the friction losses in the bearings 26 of the braking roller 15 or as a result of the milling work of the braking roller 15 on the surface 16 of the cross-wound bobbin 8.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin 8 rotatably held in the creel 9, braked to a standstill and lifted from the bobbin drive roller 11 can then also be rotated, as it is only fixed by<br>
9<br>
 <br>
the rotatably mounted braking roller 15. In other words, the operating staff can rotate the cross-wound bobbin 8 in the unwinding direction without problems, search for the thread end which has run on and unwind it in the required length from the cross-wound bobbin 8. After corresponding preparation, the thread end can be fed by means of a thread take-off mechanism 30 which is particular to the workstation and can be driven reversibly, into the spinning box 3, and can be placed on a fibre ring rotated with the spinning rotor. Synchronously with the subsequent start of drawing off the thread, the cross-wound bobbin braking mechanism 13 is pivoted back into its rest position and the cross-wound bobbin 8 is in the process lowered onto the rotating bobbin drive roller 11, which thereupon drives the cross-wound bobbin 8 by means of frictional engagement.<br>
