Process and device for producing a coking coal cake for carrying out a coking process in a furnace chamber.<br>
The invention relates to a process and a stamping device for stamping of a coking coal cake with less cake height and greater cake base surface and following insertion in a coking furnace with a furnace chamber with a larger furnace base surface.<br>
Coking furnaces working as per the "Hon-recovery process" show a large furnace Jbase surface with comparitively less chamber height of furnace as per state of art,in order to utilise the heating system of furnace optimum that raeo.ns heat effective to the extent possible.<br>
The insertion of coking coal in the furnace chamber,takes place herein by means of a belt installation as allocation-Conveyer,whose charging device is driven over a cantilevered arm item up to the opened chamber of furnace.<br>
An input of coking coal taking place in such an extent is highly time consuming, in doing so the furnace chamber doors almost must be fully opened, in order to place design point of view relatively expensiv -e charging device in the furnace chamber for the charge appropriately,<br>
THe input of coking cool in the furnace takes place there in the following part steps:<br>
a) opening of furnace door<br>
b) Drive in of charging belt(Allocation-Conveyer) and simultaneous<br>
filling up of coking coal.<br>
c) Drive out of charging belt (Allocation - conveyer) at simultaneous<br>
filling up of coking coal and levelling of coking coal surface.<br>
d) Closing of furnace door#<br>
The i)E 195  5 736 A1 reveals a process ond an associated coking coal servicing machine for filling of a coking furnace with conl.The assign-wnent lies basically to improve the filling up of furnace chamber and the concentration of input coal,specially in non-recovery coke ovens. This happens as per this process through it that already outside of furnace chamber of coking furnace the coal v/ith uniform height is filled in a coal filling - and packing chamber- drop bottom bucket- and followingly is concentrated with suitable devices*<br>
The US 3,784,634 reveals a process and on associated machine for operating furnace ch,&amp;aber doors for squeezing out coke from furnace chamber and for charging of a neighbouring previously emptied furnace chamber with a compact coal charge.<br><br>
5<br>
It deals here with a combined coking furnace servicing machine for squeezing out of coke and for filling up of coking coal. For operation feasibility of coking furnace servicing machine along the front of furnace chamber, it is placed on rails along 'the battery length direction and the head of squeezer displays a water co61ed cooling device to prevent the damages and distortion through considerable heating through the discharging material and the temperature within the furnace chamber. The filling of emptied furnace chamber takes place by means of. endless conveyor as charging conveyor (allocation - conveyor). Also in this device the conveyor discharge is so built, that it can be driven telescopically in the furnace chamber of coking furnace. The, following finding is common there to the process of state of<br>
the art:<br>
Time gap and. opening degree of furnace doors affect disad-<br>
vantageously in the required coking temperatures  on  multiple<br>
grounds.<br>
At one side furnace chamber cools down very quickly, which again requires energy and time to take the coking temperature high and on other side all machine parts, also such of.conveyor installation, in consequence of high temperature in a hot furnace chamber,are subjected to a very high wear, before all in the starting phase. This involves frequently a cost Intensive maintenance - and repair works and leads in addition to . furnace shut down time3 during which the production of coke is suspended,.<br>
The assignment of invention is therefore to provide a process and an associated stamping device, which offers the possibility to input the coking coal cakes produced in edge wise manner with help of stamping device, in a flat lying manner in a furnace chamber avoiding all the above mentioned disadvantages to the extent possible. The assignment is solved through it, that a coking coal cake with less coke height and larger coke base surface is stazqped in known way in edgewise manner in a stamp die, followingly the .cake remaining in the stamp die is brought through a functionally suitable tilt-ing  device placed on the stamp die, to a position in which the yet non-deshaped coking coal cake, is input in the furnace chamber in a manner suitable for placement, deshaped in this and is deposited on the furnace base. In addition, the stamping device is so executed that at the stamp<br><br>
6<br>
die of stamping machine a .tilting and holding device is connected.<br>
This is specially advantageously further executed when in the tilting and holding device, a setting base is so arranged that this in it's respective position is part of stamp die and of setting base at the'same time.<br>
The process proves itself also very economical and service friendly when in the tilting device guiding and supporting track rollers are assembled to the setting base and the filting device is operated through telescope cylinder or other drive components. Both the Figures 1/2 and 2/2 show an execution example with the components as per reiference drawing lists. Here the stamping device is executed such that the front end 4 of stamp die is built through a sealing plate 4 fastened to the fixed stamp die wall 5 which in the retracting'of coal cake 1 comes out of engagement or'the front end 4 of stamp die is built through a movable trap door which, brought to the .tilting ;and holding device 3 and during driving of setting base 2 in the furnace chamber, in a manner appropriate for pla-cement, serves as setting base support.<br>
Further the rear end 6 of stamp die is built through a device, which during the stamping process forms a stable end of stamp die through interlocking 7 and after reaching of appropriate position oni-*ratek roller 1? comes to a halt and forms the setting bracket 6. The setting base P. is executed with atleast two gear racks 14, which engage in drive pinion 1.5, which are arranged on a line shaft 19" The gear racks 14 under setting base 2 are so designed* there that they serve at the same time also as skids.<br>
The stamping device possesses over the stamp die a stamping set up with more number of stamper cars 9 which are set up on rails 10 which are arranged transverse to stamp die.<br>
The design of stamping device further contains that the stamping set up comprises of individual retractable  stamping car 9 not coupled to a train, which,-each for itself- through .traversing- drive are movable to and fro and thus cover the entire coking coal coke<br>
width.<br>
For the mode of operation of the installation it is emphasized that<br>
the front sealing plate 4 can be component of fixed retaining design 5 and can also be brought to fitting device 3 and consequently serves as bonding gate for setting base 2. The rear sealing plate forms the setting bracket 6. The setting bracket lies here on the<br><br>
7<br>
side and is fixed over the interlocking device 7 in this position.<br>
The coking coal charging takes place push wise over the pusher charger 8 or other charging devices. The stamper car of stamping set up 9 do not stay  in contrast to known applications - on rails arranged longitudinally to the stamp dies, on the other hand each stamper car has its1 own rail (track) 10, which are arranged transverse to stamp die. {Through here it is. possible, to move the stamper car while stamping: of  coking,coal cake with rail shifter 11 is transverse direction to- and fro, consequently a stamping of wide coking coal cake 1 is possible,<br>
The process is designed such that after the coking coal cake 1 is stamped, the tilting device 12 is unlocked and it tilts this with the setting base 2 and the coking coal cake sidewise to downwards. The drive of tilt*- and holding device 2 takes place there for exa-mple'through telescope cylinder 13 or oiiher drives. In retracting of tilting devices 3, the gears of gear rack 14 which are brought under the setting base 2 engage in the tooth spaces of drive pinion 15. The setting base 2 lies on track roller 16, which are brought on the tilting device 3. The setting bracket 6 stands now on it's track wheel 17. The front sealing plate 4- is through the retracting of coal cake'out of engagement or is trapped to downwards in trap -form end serVes now as bonding gate 4 for the setting base 2, The c'oking coal cake is now input in known way in the furnace chamber: <br>
Base with coking coal cake 1 and setting bracket 6 in the furnace chamber - setting bracket interlocked - bast back - setting bracket unlocked - setting base 2 with setting bracket'6 back in machine 18.<br>
After the setting base 2 with the setting bracket 6 is traversed back in the machine 1p, the setting base with the setting bracket is brought through the tilting device 5 again iaa the starting stamping position.<br><br>
