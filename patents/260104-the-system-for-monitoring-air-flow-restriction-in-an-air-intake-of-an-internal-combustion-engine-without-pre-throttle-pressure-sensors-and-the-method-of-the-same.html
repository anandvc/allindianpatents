AIR FILTER RESTRICTION MONITORING<br>
WITHOUT PRE-THROTTLE PRESSURE SENSORS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to internal combustion<br>
engines, and more particularly to monitoring restricted air flow through a filter<br>
without implementing a pre-throttle pressure sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines combust a fuel and air mixture<br>
to produce drive torque. More specifically, air is drawn into the engine<br>
through a throttle. The air is mixed with fuel and the air and fuel mixture is<br>
compressed within a cylinder using a piston. The air and fuel mixture is<br>
combusted within the cylinder to reciprocally drive the piston within the<br>
cylinder, which in turn rotationally drives a crankshaft of the engine.<br>
[0004] Engine operation is regulated based on several parameters<br>
including, but not limited to, intake air temperature (TPRE), manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP), throttle position (TPS) and engine RPM. With specific<br>
reference to the throttle, the state parameters (e.g., air temperature and<br>
pressure) before the throttle are good references that can be used for engine<br>
control and diagnostic. For example, proper functioning of the throttle can be<br>
monitored by calculating the flow through the throttle for a given throttle<br>
position and then comparing the calculated air flow to a measured or actual<br>
air flow. As a result, the total or stagnation air pressure before the throttle<br>
(i.e., the pre-throttle air pressure) is critical to accurately calculate the flow<br>
through the throttle. Alternatively, the total pressure and/or static pressure<br>
can be used to monitor air filter restriction.<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0005] An air filter is often used in an internal combustion engine to<br>
remove contamination from the induction air. Over a period of use the air filter<br>
can become plugged and restrict the air flow into the engine. This can reduce<br>
performance, reduce fuel economy and increase engine emissions.<br>
Therefore, it is important to determine whether air flow is restricted as a result<br>
of the air filter.<br>
[0006] Traditional internal combustion engines include a pre-throttle<br>
pressure sensor that directly measures the pre-throttle pressure. Accordingly,<br>
a traditional engine system is able to diagnose air flow restriction resulting<br>
from an air filter if up-stream and down-stream pressure sensors are<br>
available. However, such additional hardware increases cost and<br>
manufacturing time, and is also a maintenance concern because proper<br>
operation of the sensors must be monitored and the sensors must be<br>
replaced if not functioning properly.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of<br>
monitoring air flow restriction in an air intake of an internal combustion engine.<br>
The method includes recording a predetermined number of pre-throttle<br>
pressure samples, recording a predetermined number of mass air flow<br>
samples, which respectively correspond to the pre-throttle pressure samples<br>
and determining a slope based on the pre-throttle pressure samples and the<br>
mass air flow samples. Whether an air filter is inducing an air flow over<br>
restriction is determined based on the slope.<br>
[0008] In one feature, the steps of recording occur when a throttle<br>
position and an engine RPM are greater than respective thresholds.<br>
[0009] In other features, the step of determining a slope occurs<br>
when a delta mass air flow value is greater than a delta threshold. A<br>
maximum mass air flow value is determined from the mass air flow samples<br>
and a minimum mass air flow value is determined from the mass air flow<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
3<br>
samples. The delta mass air flow value is calculated as a difference between<br>
the maximum mass air flow value and the minimum mass air flow value.<br>
[0010] In still another feature, the method further includes<br>
determining a linear regression line based on the pre-throttle pressure<br>
samples and the mass air flow samples. The slope corresponds to the linear<br>
regression line.<br>
[0011] In yet other features, each of the pre-throttle pressure<br>
samples is determined by determining an intermediate parameter based on<br>
engine operating parameters and determining a pre-throttle pressure sample<br>
based on the intermediate parameter. A pressure ratio is determined based<br>
on the intermediate parameter and the pressure ratio is set equal to a<br>
constant value if the intermediate parameter is not less than a threshold<br>
value.<br>
[0012] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary internal combustion<br>
engine system 10 is illustrated. The engine system 10 includes an engine 12,<br>
an intake manifold 14 and an exhaust manifold 16. Air is drawn into the<br>
intake manifold 14 through an air filter 17 and a throttle 18. The air is mixed<br>
with fuel, and the fuel and air mixture is combusted within a cylinder 20 of the<br>
engine 12. More specifically, the fuel and air mixture is compressed within the<br>
cylinder 20 by a piston (not shown) and combustion is initiated. The<br>
combustion process releases energy that is used to reciprocally drive the<br>
piston within the cylinder 20. Exhaust that is generated by the combustion<br>
process is exhausted through the exhaust manifold 16 and is treated in an<br>
exhaust after-treatment system (not shown) before being released to<br>
atmosphere. Although a single cylinder 20 is illustrated, it is anticipated that<br>
the pre-throttle estimation control of the present invention can be implemented<br>
with engines having more than one cylinder.<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
[0022] A control module 30 regulates engine operation based on a<br>
plurality of engine operating parameters including, but not limited to, a pre-<br>
throttle static pressure (PPRE), a pre-throttle stagnation pressure (PPREO) (i.e.,<br>
the air pressures upstream of the throttle), an intake air temperature (TPRE), a<br>
mass air flow (MAF), a manifold absolute pressure (MAP), an effective throttle<br>
area (AEFF) and an engine RPM. PPREO and PPRE are determined based on a<br>
pre-throttle estimation control, which is disclosed in commonly assigned, co-<br>
pending U.S. Pat. App. Serial No. 11/464,340, filed on August 14, 2006.<br>
[0023] TPRE, MAF, MAP and engine RPM are determined based on<br>
signals generated by a TPRE sensor 32, a MAF sensor 34, a MAP sensor 36<br>
and an engine RPM sensor 38, respectively, which are all standard sensors of<br>
an engine system. AEFF is determined based on a throttle position signal that<br>
is generated by a throttle position sensor, which is also a standard sensor. A<br>
barometric pressure (PBARO) is monitored using a barometric pressure sensor<br>
40. A throttle position sensor 42 generates a throttle position signal (TPS).<br>
The relationship between AEFF to TPS is pre-determined using engine<br>
dynamometer testing with a temporary stagnation pressure sensor (shown in<br>
phantom in Figure 1) installed. Production vehicles include the relationship<br>
pre-programmed therein and therefore do not require the presence of the<br>
stagnation pressure sensor.<br>
[0024] The pre-throttle pressure estimation control of U.S. Pat. App.<br>
Serial No. 11/464,340 determines PPRE and PPREO based on engine operating<br>
parameters including, but not limited to MAF, AEFF, TPRE and MAP. More<br>
specifically, the throttle 18 and the associated pre and post air passages 50,<br>
52, respectively, are provided as a control volume and the air flow<br>
therethrough is treated as a one-dimensional, quasi-steady state<br>
compressible gas flow. Accordingly, the following relationship is provided:<br>
  (1)<br>
where PPREO is the pre-throttle stagnation pressure (i.e., the pressure that the<br>
air would reach if it were brought to zero speed, via a steady, adiabatic, quasi-<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
static process with no external work) measured in kPa, TPRE0 is the pre-throttle<br>
stagnation temperature (i.e., the temperature that the fluid would reach if it<br>
were brought to zero speed by a steady, adiabatic process with no external<br>
work) measured in K, R is the ideal gas constant for air (i.e., 288.17<br>
Nm/(kg.K)). is a unit-less coefficient equal to 0.6847 for sonic air flow (i.e.,<br>
where MAP/PPREO is less than 0.528) and is determined based on the<br>
following relationship for sub-sonic air flow:<br><br>
where k is the ratio of specific heats for air (i.e., 1.4) and PR is equal to the<br>
ratio of MAP to PPREO. TPREO is determined based on the following<br>
relationship:<br><br>
where V is the air velocity upstream of the throttle and is determined based on<br>
the MAF signal, p and the throttle intake pipe geometry, p is the air density<br>
(kg/m3) and can be assumed to be the same value as ambient air because the<br>
flow through air filter system has such a low Mach number (e.g., 
can be treated as incompressible air flow.<br>
[0025] Equations 1 and 2 can be combined to provide the following<br>
relationship:<br><br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
An intermediate parameter (NEW) is defined based on Equation 6 to provide<br>
the following relationship:<br><br>
[0026] PPREO is determined by first calculating NEW based on MAF,<br>
R, TPREO, AEFF and MAP in accordance with Equation 7. If NEW is greater<br>
than or equal to 1.2968 (i.e., sonic air flow) is clamped to 0.6847 and PPREO<br>
is determined based on Equation 4. As provided above, PR is set equal to a<br>
constant (C) (e.g., 0.528) for sonic air flow. If NEW is less than a threshold<br>
value (XTHR) 1.2968 (i.e., sub-sonic air flow), PR is calculated based on NEW.<br>
More specifically, PR can be calculated using Equation 8 or can be determined<br>
using a look-up table. An exemplary look-up table is graphically illustrated in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
[0027] PPREO value can be determined by dividing MAP by PR, and is<br>
used to control engine operation and/or for diagnostics. For example, during<br>
engine control, PPREO, MAF, MAP and TPREO can be used to calculate the<br>
throttle position. If the air flow into the engine needs to change, the change in<br>
throttle position can be predicted for the current air flow to the desired air flow.<br>
PPREO, along with other parameters, can be used to calculate a theoretical<br>
MAF, which is comparable to that determined by the MAF sensor. In this<br>
manner, it can be determined whether the MAF sensor and/or the throttle<br>
is/are functioning properly. As a result, throttle position error and/or MAF<br>
error can be diagnosed, depending on what other conditions are known.<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
[0028] The pre-throttle estimation control also provides the following<br>
relationship:<br><br>
Accordingly, PPRE is determined based on PPREO using Equation 9. PPRE can<br>
also be used to control engine operation and for diagnostics. For example,<br>
during engine control, PPRE, MAF, PBARO and TPREO can be used to calculate or<br>
monitor the air filter restriction conditions.<br>
[0029] PPREO can be measured directly during calibration of the<br>
engine operating parameters, for example, when calibrating AEFF versus<br>
throttle position. More specifically, calibrating AEFF versus throttle position,<br>
PPREO is concurrently measured to correspond to the AEFF and throttle position<br>
values with other parameters such as TPRE, MAF and MAP. In this manner,<br>
the PPREO estimation provided by the present invention is accurate during post-<br>
calibration engine operation. Alternatively, PPREO can be calculated from a<br>
measured PPRE and calculated air flow velocity using Equation 9.<br>
[0030] The air flow restriction control of the present disclosure<br>
determines whether the air filter is sufficiently dirty that the air flow is<br>
unacceptably restricted and the air filter should be replaced. More<br>
specifically, the pre-throttle pressure is determined as a function of engine<br>
widely available parameters such as MAF, TPS, IAT, and MAP, as described<br>
in detail above. The difference between the measured barometer pressure<br>
and calculated pre-throttle pressure is checked to diagnose the air filter status<br>
in a mid range of scenarios.<br>
[0031] Figure 3 illustrates measured MAP and predicted pre-throttle<br>
pressure over measured MAF for an engine with a clean air filter. Figure 4<br>
shows the similar data with a dirty or plugged air filter. Linear regression lines<br>
are provided based on the data plots. The slopes of the regression lines of<br>
the dirty filter is nearly double those of the clean. Accordingly, the air filter<br>
restriction control of the present disclosure determines a slope (m) based on a<br>
predicted pre-throttle pressure differential and a MAF differential. If m is<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
9<br>
greater than a threshold slope (mTHR), the air filter is over or undesirably<br>
restricting the air flow. If m is less than or equal to mTHR, the air filter is not<br>
over or undesirably restricting the air flow.<br>
[0032] The benefit of using pre-throttle pressure instead of<br>
measured MAP is to comprehend the impact of the nonlinear compressible<br>
flow across throttle body and different throttle positions. The difference of<br>
barometric pressure minus the pre-throttle pressure can be used for above<br>
slope calculation and air filter restriction monitoring when a barometric<br>
pressure sensor is available. The advantage of using the slope of pre-throttle<br>
pressure to mass air flow under certain conditions is to minimize the impact of<br>
unknown barometer changes or inaccurate barometric pressure prediction<br>
when a barometric pressure sensor is not installed.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Figure 5, exemplary steps that are<br>
executed by the air flow restriction control will be described in detail. In step<br>
400, a counter n is set equal to 1. In step 402, control determines whether the<br>
TPS is greater than a threshold TPS (TPSTHR). If the TPS is greater than<br>
TPSTHR, control continues in step 404. If TPS is not greater than TPSTHR,<br>
control loops back to step 400. Control determines whether the engine RPM<br>
is greater than a threshold RPM (RPMTHR). If RPM is greater than RPMTHR,<br>
control continues in step 406. If RPM is not greater than RPMTHR, control<br>
loops back to step 400. By initially checking the throttle and engine RPM<br>
conditions to ensure sufficient engine flow (if the flow is too low, the restriction<br>
loss through air filter is very small), control can also check vehicle mileage<br>
and/or engine run time within certain limits to ensure that the barometric<br>
pressure does not drastically change. This is particularly useful in the event<br>
that the barometric pressure sensor is not available.<br>
[0034] In step 406, control determines the pre-throttle pressure as<br>
discussed in detail above. In step 408, control filters the predicted pre-throttle<br>
pressure. Control stores the pre-throttle pressure and MAF for step n in step<br>
410. In step 412, control determines whether n is greater than a step<br>
threshold (nTHR). If n is not greater than nTHR, n is incremented in step 414<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
10<br>
and loops back to step 402. In step 416, control determines whether the<br>
difference between the maximum MAF (MAFMAX) and the minimum MAF<br>
(MAFMIN), determined from the n samples stored in memory, is greater than a<br>
differential MAF threshold (ΔMAFTHR). If the difference is not greater than<br>
ΔMAFTHR, control loops back to step 400. If the difference is greater than<br>
ΔMAFTHR, control continues in step 418.<br>
[0035] In step 418, control calculates m based on a pre-throttle<br>
pressure differential and a MAF differential. Control determines whether m is<br>
greater than ITITHR in step 420. If m is greater than mTHR, control continues in<br>
step 422. If m is not greater than mTHR, control continues in step 424. In step<br>
422, control indicates that the air filter is restricting air flow and control ends.<br>
In step 424, control indicates that the air filter is not restricting air flow and<br>
control ends.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Figure 6, exemplary modules that execute<br>
the air flow restriction control will be described in detail. The exemplary<br>
modules includes comparator modules 600, 602, an AND gate 604, a pre-<br>
throttle pressure module 606, a MAF sampler module 608, a slope module<br>
612 and comparator modules 614, 616. The comparator module 600<br>
compares TPS to TPSTHR and generates a signal (e.g., 1) if TPS is greater<br>
than TPSTHR. Similarly, the comparator module 602 compares RPM to<br>
RPMTHR and generates a signal (e.g., 1) if RPM is greater than RPMTHR. The<br>
AND gate 604 receives the signals and generates a signal (e.g., 1) if the<br>
signals from the comparators indicate that TPS and RPM are both greater<br>
than their respective thresholds.<br>
[0037] The pre-throttle pressure module 606 determines the pre-<br>
throttle pressure and records samples thereof when the AND gate 604<br>
generates the appropriate signal (e.g., 1). Similarly, the MAF sampler module<br>
608 monitors MAF and records samples thereof when the AND gate 604<br>
generates the appropriate signal (e.g., 1). The slope module 612 receives the<br>
pre-throttle pressure and MAF values and calculates m when ΔMAF (i.e.,<br>
MAFMAX minus MAFMIN) is greater than ΔMAFTHR. More specifically, if ΔMAF<br><br>
GP-308655-PTE-CD<br>
11<br>
is greater than ΔMAFTHR, the comparator module 614 generates a<br>
corresponding signal (e.g., 1), which is received by the slope module 612.<br>
The comparator module 616 generates a signal (e.g., 1) if m is greater than<br>
mTHR, which indicates that the air flow is over restricted. If m is not greater<br>
than mTHR, the comparator module 616 generates a corresponding signal<br>
(e.g., 0), which indicates that the air flow is not over restricted.<br>
[0038] It is anticipated that the exemplary modules described above<br>
can be combined, as sub-modules, into a single module. For example, the<br>
pre-throttle pressure module 606 and the MAF sampler module 608 can be<br>
sub-modules of a single module.<br>
[0039] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
