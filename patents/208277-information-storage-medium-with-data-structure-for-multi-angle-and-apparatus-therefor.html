The following specification particularly describes the invention and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed.	;	<br>
GRANTED<br>

Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an information storage medium with a structure for multi-angle data, and recording and reproducing apparatuses therefor.<br>
Background Art<br>
A digital versatile disc (DVD) is a representative example of conventional information storage media on which multi-angle data can be recorded.   The multi-angle data is recorded on a DVD using an interleaving method in which data is divided into predetermined units and the units are alternately recorded.<br>
Hereinafter, a video (including audio as the case may be) data structure of a DVD, which is a conventional multimedia storage medium, will be described with the accompanying drawings.   FIG. 1 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of a DVD.    Referring to FIG. 1, a DVD is divided into a video manager (VMG) area and a plurality of video title set (VTS) areas.   Information regarding video titles (i.e., video title related data) and menu information for the video titles are stored in the VMG area, and video title data is stored in the plurality of VTS areas.   In general, the VMG area includes two or three files and each VTS area includes three to twelve files.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of the VMG area.   Referring to FIG. 2, the VMG area includes a video manager information (VMGI) area containing additional information regarding the VMG area, a video object set (VOBS) area containing video object information regarding the video title menus, and a VMGI backup area.<br>
2<br><br>
Each of the VMGI area, the VOBS area, and the VMGI backup area exists as a file.   However, the inclusion of the VOBS area in the VMG area is optional, such that in some cases, the VOBS area may not be formed in the VMG area.<br>
Each VTS area contains the title data, which is a unit of reproduction, and video object information VOBS.   A plurality of titles may be recorded on a VTS area.   FIG. 3 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of the VTS area.   Referring to FIG. 3, video title set information (VTSI), VOBS for a video title menu screen, VOBS for a video title set, and VTSI backup data are recorded in the VTS area. Recording of the video title menu screen VOBS is optional for displaying a title menu screen.   Each video title set VOBS is divided into a plurality of video objects VOBs a unit of a data record and each VOB comprises cells which are a smallest unit of a VOB (i.e., a data unit) of the title. Therefore, a VOB or a data record unit comprises a plurality of cells as the most basic unit of the data record unit<br>
In a DVD, units of reproduction are recorded in a hierarchical structure.   A title (i.e., data records) is formed on the uppermost layer of the hierarchical structure.   In general, a title (i.e., data records of the title) is linked to at least one program chain (PGC).   The first reproduced PGC among a plurality of PGCs, is called an entry PGC.   FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a title linked to a first PGC, i.e., an entry PGC, according to the conventional multi-angle data recording method.   FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a title linked to a plurality of PGCs, according to the conventional multi-angle data recording method.   When one of the plurality of PGCs is selected and reproduced after reproduction of a PGC as shown in FIG. 5, the command for determining the PGC to be selected and reproduced may be stored in a DVD.   Controlling the sequence of reproduction is referred to as navigation.   A command for<br>
3<br><br>
determining the navigation is contained in a program chain information (PGCI).<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram of a PGC as linked to the title data records, according the conventional multi-angle data recording and reproducing method.   Referring to FIG. 6, the PGC comprises PGC information (PGCI) and the video title set VOBS comprising the title data records. The PGCI contains a pre-command that includes a navigation command, a post-command, and a plurality of program information.   The pre-command is executed before reproduction of a PGC and the post-command is executed after reproduction.   Each PGCI program contains a plurality of cell information, each program cell being a unit of reproduction.   Cells included in a program (i.e., PGCI program cells) are linked to respective cells included in a VOB of a video title set VOBS, each VOB cell being a unit of a data record.   Each program cell, i.e., a unit of reproduction, has a cell command (cc) provided after reproduction thereof.   The PGCI is part of a hierarchical description of the PGC as a unit of reproduction, and the PGC has an information structure that links a PGCI program cell, which is the most basic unit of reproduction, to a VOB cell which is the most basic unit of a data record.   In particular, the PGC is a link of a plurality of PGCI program cells, which are units of reproduction.   Here, the plurality of PGCI program cells may form an angle block.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of an angle block.   Referring to FIG. 7, the angle block is constructed such that a plurality of reproduction cells are arranged in parallel so that only one of these cells can be reproduced.   The reproduction cells that form the angle block, have the same reproduction time.   Each of the reproduction cells corresponds to a specific angle.   If cells, which are units of reproduction, form an angle block, data for a specific angle is divided into predetermined interleaved units (ILVUs) and recorded on VOBs<br>
4<br><br>
comprising cells, which are units of a data record, using the interleaving method.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of video title set VOBs and cells in which multi-angle support is not applied. Referring to FIG. 8, the VOBs are sequentially stored and recorded in contiguous blocks of an information storage medium, the contiguous block being a contiguous recording space.   However, as shown in FIG. 9, when multi-angle support is applied, the VOBs for each angle and their cells are recorded in ILVUs on an interleaved block, using the interleaving method.   As a result, data for a specific angle is not recorded on contiguous recording areas.   That is, conventionally, angle data is recorded sequentially on alternate VOBs using the interleaving method.<br>
More particularly, FIG. 9 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of two angle data sequentially and alternately recorded using the interleaving method.   Referring to FIG. 9, respective ILVUs have the same reproduction time.   The amount of data to be recorded may vary according to the type of a compression method used.   In the case of interleaved data, in order to reproduce data for an angle or reproduce data for a changed angle, a jump must be made to desired ILVUs.   For instance, in order to reproduce data in a first angle, the data for the first angle in the ILVU must be detected.   For such first angle data detection, a video object bit stream contains ILVU position data (i.e., NXTILVU SA and NXTJLVU_SZ in a data structure as shown in FIG. 11 ).   The ILVU position data indicate the position and size of the next ILVU data belonging to a bit stream.   After reproduction of the ILVU data, a jump to the next ILVU data is made using the data NXT_ILVU_SA and NXTJLVU SZ.<br>
In order to change angles during the data reproduction, a jump must be made to the position of data for the changed angle.   The extent<br>
5<br><br>
of jumping is determined in ILVUs.   FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating jumping to ILVU data for a selected angle in view of cells, according to the conventional multi-angle data reproducing.   Referring to FIG. 10, even if a user issues a command to change angles at a certain time during reproduction of ILVU data, the subsequent image data can be reproduced without pause for a seamless change.   This is accomplished by first completing the reproduction of ILVU data, following a link by jumping to ILVU data for the changed angle, and reproducing the ILVU data for the changed angle.   Information regarding the position of ILVU data is multiplexed and contained in a bit stream of video object data that is recorded using the interleaving method.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram of a conventional data structure of ILVU angle position information SML_AGL_Cn_DSTA contained in a video object bit stream specifying the positions and sizes of ILVU data for nine angles (n is a natural number between 1 and 9).   Typically, a maximum number of angles supported by a DVD are nine.   The ILVU angle position data SML_AGL_Cn_DSTA provides information regarding the ILVU data for angle #n through a link in a current ILVU data.   After the reproduction of the current ILVU data, it is possible to change a current angle to a desired angle and reproduce data for the desired angle, using the ILVU angle position data SML_AGL_Cn_DSTA.<br>
In a DVD authoring process for multi-angle data support, images photographed at different angles are compressed to form several bit streams of data with the same reproduction length.   Next, a bit stream is formed using the interleaving method and information is inserted into each bit stream, which allows a reference to other angles during data reproduction.   Accordingly, video object data is recorded on a DVD such that angles can be changed during data reproduction.<br>
However, if multi-angle data is divided into predetermined units and stored in a DVD using the interleaving method, the multi-angle data<br>
6<br><br>
is not continuously recorded in contiguous areas of the DVD.   Thus, for continuous reproduction of data for an angle, conventionally a reproducing apparatus is required to move the optical pickup position many times to read the data.   In particular, if a reproducing apparatus reproduces data from an optical disc or a hard disc, considerable time is spent by the apparatus to change the optical pickup position.   There is also a bit rate limit imposed on a compressed bit stream to compensate for the time delay offset caused when the apparatus changes the optical pickup position.<br>

Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout.   The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
According to the present invention, multi-angle support is enabled such that angle data is recorded on an information storage medium using a separation recording method, not an interleaving method.   In other<br>
16<br><br>
words, multi-angle support is realized by recording bit streams for the respective angle data in contiguous recording areas of an information storage medium.   During data reproduction, angle change is accomplished by dividing data for each angle into jumping units (JPUs), designating a start address of the JPUs as a jumping point, and recording information regarding the jumping points of the respective angle data as additional jumping point information.   According to an aspect of the invention, if respective entry points are respective jumping points, it is possible to detect jumping points, based on information regarding the entry points.<br>
For better understanding of the present invention, main elements of the present invention are enumerated as follows:<br>
(a)	compressed and coded audio/video (AV) streams with respect to respective angles;<br>
(b)	clip information files containing information, e.g., attribute information, regarding a coded audio/video (AV) stream;<br>
(c)	Playltems as reproduction information that indicate reproduction time for a reproduction section between times IN time and OUT time of a clip comprising the above elements (a) and (b);<br>
(d)	a PlayList as reproduction information including at least one of the Playltems; and<br>
(e)	a jumping point map in which positions of the jumping points are recorded in a table format.<br>
In the present invention, multi-angle data is referred to as multi-angle object (e.g., AV, video, audio, other data) data comprising a plurality of reproduction units corresponding to a certain reproduction time.   That is, multi-angle data comprises data obtained (e.g., data<br>
17<br><br>
photographed by cameras in case of video) by several receiving/data collecting devices at different angles.   Typically, audio data is created to be the same angle data at different angles, but can be differently created at different angles.   In conclusion, typically, multiple video object data that can be reproduced in the same time zone is called multi-angle data, and multiple content (e.g., audio, other data) that can be reproduced in the same time zone is called multi-angle content, although, herein, for simplicity, all types of multiple data that can be reproduced in the same time zone is referred to as multi-angle data.<br>
Using multi-angle AV data as an example of multi-angle data in describing the present invention, typically, size of video object data is massive and thus stored or transmitted as compressed bit streams.   The present invention uses a clip, which is a unit of a record (i.e., a data unit), and a PlayList and a Playltem, which are units of reproduction.   The clip corresponds to a video title set VOB cell, which is a unit of a record in a conventional DVD as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6, and the PlayList and Playltem correspond respectively to a PGCI program and a PGCl cell as shown in FIG. 6, which are units of reproduction in a DVD.<br>
More particularly, according to the present invention, an AV stream is recorded in units of clips in contiguous areas of an information storage medium.   Typically, the AV stream is also compressed and recorded to reduce the size of the AV stream.   When reproducing a recorded clip, characteristics of the clip recorded in each clip, are used to interpret the compressed video object data.   The clip characteristics or clip information contains the audio and video attributes of each clip, and an entry point map with information regarding the position of entry points that can be randomly accessed.   In the case of the motion picture expert groups (MPEG) video compression technique, an entry point is positioned at an I picture that is intra coded.   The entry point map is<br>
18<br><br>
mainly used during a time search of detecting the position of data at a predetermined time after data reproduction.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates the relationship among a PlayList, a Playltem, clip information, and a clip, according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the PlayList is a basic unit of reproduction.   In an information storage medium according to the present invention, a plurality of PlayLists are stored.   A PlayList comprises one or a plurality of Playltems.   A Playltem links to a portion of a clip, and more particularly, indicates starting and finishing times of reproduction in a clip.<br>
Thus, clip information is used to easily detect a desired portion of a clip.<br>
Hereinafter, a data structure and recording positions of multi-angle data will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 14 is a diagram of a relationship between a jumping unit and a jumping point in a clip AV stream, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 14, if a clip represents video object data at a specific angle and a part of the multi-angle data, the clip is divided into a plurality of jumping units and the starting point of each jumping unit is called a jumping point.   Each jumping point denotes a point in a certain clip for another angle, the point being a starting or destination point when jumping in from or out to a clip for a different angle during reproduction of the certain clip, respectively.   Therefore, a clip jumping point links the clips to another angle data.   According to an aspect of the invention, a jumping point is an entry point.   However, for seamless data reproduction, typically, all entry points are not always set as jumping points, because an entry point is formed at intervals of about 0.5 seconds.<br>
FIG. 15 is a diagram illustrating a plurality of linked angle data clips for multi-angle data reproduction of the clips, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   As shown in FIG. 15, assuming that a plurality of clips with an equivalent number of jumping points are<br>
19<br><br>
linked to one another, the respective clips are recorded in different areas and are linked to one another through jumping points at the same reproduction time.   In order to reproduce a different clip (a different angle data clip) during reproduction of a clip, after the reproduction of the clip to a predetermined jumping point is complete and a jumping unit of the different clip is detected, which corresponds to the predetermined jumping unit, the different clip is reproduced from the corresponding jumping unit, thereby enabling seamless, continuous reproduction of the clips.   In FIG. 15, for example, arrows denote a process in which the clip for a third angle is first partially reproduced, a first angle is selected during the reproduction of the clip for the third angle, a clip for the first angle is reproduced, an mth angle is selected during the reproduction of the clip for the first angle, and a clip for the mth angle is reproduced. When a user inputs a command to change angles, the changing is performed in units of jumping units.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, it is possible to continuously reproduce data from an information storage medium while changing the position of a reproducing apparatus within a predetermined time, even when the data is recorded in non-continuous different areas of the information storage medium in which random access can be carried out.   In the present invention, the changing of the position of the reproducing apparatus is described as jumping.   In general, additional time is not required for jumping in a volatile electronic information storage medium, such as memory.   However, in the case of a non-volatile information storage medium, such as an optical disc where data is read by moving an optical pickup, additional time is required for jumping.   Also, when the speed of reading video object data from an information storage medium is different from the speed of reproducing the read video object data, the information storage medium requires an apparatus that can compensate for the difference between the reading and the reproducing speeds, even if data is recorded for reading and<br>
20<br><br>
reproduction in contiguous areas.   According to the present invention, a video object buffer is used as the apparatus allowing continuous reproduction of the multi-angle data from the information storage medium while changing the position of the reproducing apparatus within a predetermined time, even when the multi-angle data is recorded in non-continuous different areas of the information storage medium in which random access can be carried out, as well as providing compensation for the difference in the reading and reproducing speeds. Data read from an information storage medium at a predetermined speed is stored in a video object buffer and then the data is reproduced from the buffer.   During the data reading, controlling the speed of the data reading is important in order to prevent overflow or underflow of the video object buffer.   The use of the video object buffer enables seamless reproduction of the data even if video object data is recorded at a variable bit rate (VBR).<br>
FIG. 16 is a diagram of a relationship between angle date clip jumping and a buffer enabling multi-angle video reproduction without a pause, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   As shown in FIG. 16, the size of each jumping unit (JPU) is determined within a range that allows the video object data stored in the video object buffer to be reproduced seamlessly when jumping to a clip of video object data for a different angle, and reproduction of the next jumping unit for the different angle starts prior to the occurrence of buffer underflow.   As shown in FIG. 14, a JPU is obtained by dividing the angle data clip.   In the case of a reproducing apparatus that requires additional time for jumping to a jumping point for a different angle, the size of the jumping unit is determined by the following condition, assuming that the longest jump time jjs T_JUMP, the speed of reading data is V_R, and the speed of reproducing video object data is V_0:<br>
Jumping Unit Size &gt; V_R * V_0 * T_JUMP I (V_R - V_0)... (1)<br>
21<br><br>
Also, typically, the size of a video object buffer meets the following:<br>
Buffer Size (B) &gt; V_0 * T_JUMP   ... (2)<br>
FIG. 17 is a diagram of a data structure of a PlayList with a multi-angle structure, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   The PlayList of FIG. 17 includes a plurality of Playltems with a sequential structure and an angle block Playltem with a multi-angle structure.   The angle block Playltem comprises a plurality of Playltems corresponding to a plurality of respective angle data clips.   In the case of the angle block Playltem, only one Playltem thereof is reproduced when reproducing the PlayList.   Also, during the reproduction of the angle block Playltem, angle change is possible by selecting the Playltem of the changed angle from the angle block Playltem, and reproducing the selected Playltem.   In general, Playltems, which constitute an angle block, have the same length of reproduction time.   More particularly, in FIG. 17, clips 2 through 4 designated by the respective Playltems of the angle block Playltem are not interleaved but are recorded in contiguous areas.   In other words, clips 2 through 4 are respectively recorded in the recording areas, in the same manner as the clips designated by the Playltems not belonging to the angle block Playltem (i.e., clips 1 and 5). However, clips 2 through 4 include the jumping point information.<br>
Hereinafter, three types of jumping point data structures in clip information will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.   FIG. 18 is a diagram of a data structure of jumping points in a clip for an angle, according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG 18, clip information further includes a jumping point map, in addition to the general information and entry point map of the PGC or the MPEG standard.   Jump point information contained in the jumping point map is closely related to video object data.   Therefore, the<br>
22<br><br>
jumping point information is included in clip information data and provides additional information regarding the clip.<br>
In FIG. 18, the general information of the clip information contains the following information:<br>
-	version_number: version of a clip information file<br>
-	EPMap_start_address: starting address of the entry point map, indicated by a byte number from the leading byte of the clip information file.<br>
-	JPMap_start_address: starting address of the jumping point map, which is indicated by a byte number from the leading byte of the clip information file.   If the value of JPMap_start_address is 0, it means that the clip related to the clip information file is not for angle data and the clip does not contain information regarding the jumping point map.<br>
-	Cliplnfo: attributes of an AV stream file related to the clip information file<br>
In FIG. 18, the entry point map of the clip information contains information regarding the time and position of an entry point that can be randomly accessed.   The jumping point map of the clip information contains information regarding jumping points through which an angle data clip can be virtually connected to clips of different angles. According to an aspect of the present invention, jump manager information included in the jumping point map indicates the number of jumping points, and the number of jumping point information entries follow the jump manager information.   The jumping point information is used to detect the positions of the respective jumping points and the starting positions in the related angle data clips.   According to an aspect of the invention, the jumping point information is expressed with bytes or the number of sectors.   Also, if the video object data is coded as an<br>
23<br><br>
MPEG transport stream, according to an aspect of the invention, the respective jumping point information is expressed with the number of MPEG-TS packets.<br>
FIG. 19 is a diagram of a data structure of jumping points in a clip for an angle, according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The data structure of the jumping points of FIG. 19 illustrates an entry point map containing jumping point information.   Therefore, the data structure of FIG. 19 is advantageous in that it does not require any additional space to store the jumping point information.   As mentioned above, when video object data is coded using time-space compression, such as MPEG, a jumping point should be set to an entry point which is a random access entry point.   By incorporating information into the entry point map as to whether an entry point acts as a jumping point, the jumping information is easily recorded.<br>
FIG. 20 is a diagram of a data structure of jumping points in a clip for an angle, according to a third embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 20, includes the jumping point information of clips that form an angle block (see, FIG. 17).   The jumping point map information structure is a separate data structure from the clip information structure.   The jumping point map information includes jump manager information that indicates the number of clips forming the angle block and the number of jumping points present in a clip, and jumping point information for the respective clips that sequentially follows the jump manager information. The jumping point map information structure enables the position of a desired angle to be easily detected.<br>
FIG, 21 is a diagram of an example PlayList with Playltems that form an angle block, according to an embodiment of the present invention.   Referring to FIG. 21, each Playltem information contains general P\ay\tem information and angle block information.   The angle block information basically specifies whether the Playltem forms an<br>
24<br><br>
angle block Playltem.   Typically, the Playltems forming an angle block are sequentially recorded.   During reproduction of the PlayList, at least one selected Playltem from the Playltems forming an angle block, is reproduced.   During reproduction of a Playltem in the angle block Playltem, another Playltem forming the angle block may be reproduced.<br>
FIG. 22 is a diagram of example PlayLists, which are units of reproduction, for different angles.   Referring to FIG. 22, the respective PlayLists include a single Playltem or Playltems for a single angle, which do not form an angle block.   That is, each PlayList corresponds to an angle.   FIG. 23 is a diagram of an example PlayList with Playltems that do not form an angle block (i.e., the PlayList includes a single Playltem), according to an embodiment of the present invention.   As shown in FIG. 23, each PlayList contains angle block information regarding an angle, which in this case indicates that the Playltem information do not form an angle block.   When a user selects an angle or changes angles, a related/corresponding angle PlayList is reproduced.<br>
According to the present invention, units of a data record constituting multi-angle data are recorded in contiguous areas of an information storage medium.   Jumping points inserted in the record units interface to the record units of different angles, and information regarding the jumping points is stored as additional information (i.e., the clip characteristics or the clip information).   Next, information regarding units of reproduction corresponding to the units of record is stored as multi-angle information (i.e., the PlayLists and the Playltems).<br>
A reproducing apparatus according to the present invention reproduces multi-angle data and has the following advantages:<br>
First, when an angle data is being reproduces and if the angle is changed, multi-angle data can be read from contiguous areas of an information storage medium and the data read can be reproduced<br>
25<br><br>
continuously.   That is, multi-angle data is coded using the same method for coding non multi-angle data.   Therefore, contrary to the interleaving method, additional data and coding operations are notrequired to continuously reproduce data for an angle.<br>
Secondly, a clip, which is a unit of record, contains jumping point information that enables connection to video object data for another angle.   To change angles at an instant when reproducing video object data for a current angle, the reproducing apparatus reproduces the video object data for the current angle to a next jumping point and then reproduces video object data for a changed angle from a jumping point corresponding to the next jumping point.<br>
Thirdly, when multi-angle information is recorded in a plurality of Playltems, i.e., units of reproduction that form an angle block and belong to a PlayList (see FIGS. 17 and 21), in order to change angles during reproduction of one Playltem of the angle block, the reproducing apparatus reproduces Playltem to a jumping point closest to a current reproducing position of a clip and then reproduces a clip for the changed angle from the jumping point.   If a single PlayList is recorded for each angle as shown in FIG. 22, when a user wants to change angles during reproduction of a PlayList, a PlayList for a changed angle is detected and reproduced.<br>
A recording apparatus according to the present invention records multi-angle data as clips and includes clip information regarding jumping points, and records units of reproduction linked to the data records on an information storage medium.   A recording apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention determines the sizes of jumping units, which are divided portion of a clip, based on a reading speed V_R of a reproducing apparatus, a jumping time T_JUMP, and the highest bit rate V_0 of video object data (see Equations (1) and (2)).   Next, the determined sizes of jumping units are converted into reproduction time.<br>
26<br><br>
Next, the video object data is coded such that random access (entry) points are set to be larger than or the same as the reproduction time. Here, typically, the interfaces to the video object data are jumping points. In general, a random access point is the starting point of a group of pictures (GOPs) in time-space compression coding, such as MPEG, and in case of MPEG, the jumping points are set to the entry points.   Thus, with MPEG, each jumping unit comprises a plurality of GOPs.   Also, typically, jumping points are formed in the same reproduction time zone of each video object data.<br>
For the respective angles, the coded video object data is recorded in contiguous areas of an information storage medium.   Information regarding the locations of the jumping points is recorded as additional information.   According to an aspect of the present invention, information regarding jumping points of each clip may be recorded as clip information, thereby providing clip characteristics.<br>
Next, information regarding units of reproduction, which form multi-angle data, is created and recorded.   For instance, a PlayList including Playttems corresponding to respective clips of multiple angles is made by linking the Playltems to one another (i.e., angle block Playltem).   Otherwise, a single PlayList may correspond to a single angle.<br>
FIGS. 24 through 26 are diagrams illustrating structure of an information storage medium storing multi-angle data and reproduction from the information storage medium, according to another embodiment of the present invention.   According to an aspect of the invention, the information storage medium has a data structure in which video object data for a multi-angle is recorded in units of clips and all entry points formed in the clips are set as jumping points.<br>
27<br><br>
When a user wants to change angles during reproduction of a clip for an angle, a reproducing apparatus according to the present invention reproduces the clip to an entry point of the clip closest to a current reproduction position, jumps to the entry point of a clip for the changed angle, which correspond to the entry point of the reproduced clip, and reproduces the clip for the changed angle after the entry point of the clip for the changed angle.   Here, typically, all entry points for all angles are formed in clips in the same time zone.   In other words, as shown in FIG.<br>
24,	respective video angle object data, which are physically recorded in<br>
contiguous but different areas, are logically linked to one another through<br>
respective entry points.<br>
In general, as shown in FIG. 25, entry points EPs are units of record having reproduction time between 0.5 second and 1 second and also formed at positions where random access can be performed. When multi-angle video object data is compressed using MPEG, the video object data comprises a plurality of GOPs.   In order to use the entry points of the video object data comprising the plurality of GOPs as jumping points during angle changing, all images in the GOPs are required to be formed of a closed GOP that are encoded only using images in a related GOP.<br>
In a recording medium data structure in which all the entry points are jumping points, additional information regarding jumping points is not required.   However, in such a data structure, underflow of a reproducing buffer is likely to be caused when the reproducing apparatus jumps to an entry point in order to change angles.   Therefore, according to an aspect of the invention, to prevent the reproducing apparatus from jumping to an entry point in a certain section of an information storage medium during or right after jumping, no jumping sections are provided as shown in FIG.<br>
25.	Sections where jumping is not allowed is called a no-jumping block<br>
(NJB).<br>
28<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 26, a change of angles is not allowed when the amount of data contained in a buffer right after data reproduction or the jumping of a reproducing apparatus is less than the amount B of data. Here, the amount B of data is the lowest limit of data amount that allows seamless reproduction of images for a jumping time JUMP_T.   When the reproduction of images is continuous while exceeding the length of an NJB, the amount of data in the buffer is always more than the amount B of data and jumping is allowed at all entry points.<br>
The length of an NJB can be calculated using the same method of calculating the length of a JPU.   More specifically, assuming that the longest jump time is T_JUMP, a speed of reading data is V_R, and a speed of reproducing video object data is V_0, the length of an NJB is calculated as follows:<br>
NJB Length &gt; V_R * V_0 * T_JUMP / (V_R - V_0)... (3)<br>
Also, typically, the size of a buffer is determined to meet the following:<br>
Buffer Size (B) &gt; V_0 * T_JUMP   ... (4)<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, video object data for multi-angle data is divided into predetermined units (i.e., clips and jumping units thereof) and recorded in contiguous areas of an information storage medium without using the interleaving method. More particularly, if a "clip" of the present invention corresponds to the prior art VOB as a data record unit, in the present invention, in case of multi-angle data, the "clip" is recorded in contiguous areas on the storage medium.    In contrast to the present invention, in the prior art, in case of multi-angle data, cells of the VOB are recorded according to the interleave method or, for example, on alternate areas in the storage<br>
29<br><br>
medium in case of two angles as shown in FIG. 9.   Accordingly, in the present invention, the layout of a data area for multi-angle data is easy to control and manage by an optical recording and reproducing apparatus, and random access is easy to perform, thereby efficiently recording/reading multi-angle data (i.e., fewer optical pickup position movements than the conventional multi-angle data recording/reading) and extending the conventional bit rate limit imposed on a compressed bit stream.<br>
The above described multi-angle data recording and reproducing processes of the present invention as embodied in a multi-angle data recorder/reproduces are implemented using software and/or computing hardware.   For example, the processes of the invention can be embodied in a detector and a reproducer of a multi-angle data reproducer, and a processor programmed to record received/input multi-angle data, from any source type, on an information storage medium according to the multi-angle data structure of the invention. More particularly, an information storage medium controls a multi-angle data reproducing apparatus by having a data structure including at least one clip object for each angle, each clip being a data record unit of the multi-angle data for an angle.   Each angle clip is divided into predetermined jumping units at jumping points and each is recorded in contiguous areas of the information storage medium.   Using the clip jumping points as a link among the contiguously recorded angle clips provides efficient random access for reading the multi-angle data for angle change.   Therefore, the present invention provides an information storage medium recording apparatus, comprising a programmed computer processor dividing data of multiple angles into respective predetermined angle units (each angle unit comprising at least two or more data cells) designated with jumping points used to link the predetermined angle units of the multi-angle data and recording each<br>
30<br><br>
predetermined angle unit including the jumping points in contiguous areas of the information storage medium.<br>
