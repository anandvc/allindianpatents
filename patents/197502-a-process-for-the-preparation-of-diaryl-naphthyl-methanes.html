				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION	<br>
This invention relates to a process for perparation of novaldiaryl naphthyl methanes and a process for preparation of said methane <br>
derivatives. The present invention particularly relates to a process or preparation of substituted secondary and tertiary amino alkoxy diaryl naphthyl methane derivatives, preparation of pharmaceutical comnoeitio", containing such compounds as active ingredients and their use as contraceptives, in to   treatment and prophylaxes of breast cancer, osteoporosis, hypercholesteremia, endometriosis, vasoconstriction, endometrial disorders and in estrogen replacement therapy (ERT).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Estrogen agonists as well as antagonists act through their interaction with estrogen receptor. This<br>
estrogen receptor protein has an active site where the ligand binds. It has been visualized as<br>
composed of two units, one having a shape complimentary to the structure of estradiol where<br>
estradiol finds a proper fit for producing estrogen agonistic activity. The second site provides binding<br>
of structural unit such as a substituted amino alkoxy anyI group thereby causing interference with the<br>
initiation of the hormonal activity as observed with estrogen antagonists. Based on this visualization,<br>
estrogen receptor model has been proposed easier. This present work utilizes the receptor model<br>
towards designing of novel estrogen antagonists.<br>
