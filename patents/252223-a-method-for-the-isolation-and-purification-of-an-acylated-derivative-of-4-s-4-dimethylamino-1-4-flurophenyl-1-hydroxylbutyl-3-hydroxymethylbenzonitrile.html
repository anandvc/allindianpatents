Method for the separation of intermediates which may be used for the preparation of escitalopram<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of optically active intermediates useful for the preparation of escitalopram.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years.<br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,013, corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication La. outlines a process for preparation of citalopram from the corresponding 5-bromo-derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide in a suitable solvent and by alkylation of 5-bromo-phtalane.<br>
US Patent No 4,943,590 corresponding to EP-B1-347 066 describes two processes for the preparation of escitalopram (S-enantiomer of citalopram). Both processes use the racemic diol having the formula<br><br><br>
as starting material. According to the first process, the diol of formula (I) is reacted with an enantiomerically pure acid derivative, such as (+) or (-)-ct-methoxy-a-trifluoromethyl-phenylacetyl chloride to form a mixture of diastereomeric esters, which are separated by HPLC or fractional crystallization, whereupon the ester with the correct stereochemistry is enantioselectively converted into escitalopram. According to the second process, the diol of formula (II) is separated into the enantiomers by stereoselective crystallization with an enantiomerically pure acid such as (+)-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid, whereupon the S-enantiomer of the diol of the formula (I) is enantioselectively converted to escitalopram.<br>
Escitalopram has now been developed as an antidepressant Hence, there is a desire for an improved method for preparation of escitalopram.<br>
It has been found that the S-enantiomer of the diol of formula (I) above as well as acylated derivatives thereof may be prepared by selective enzymatic acylation of the primary hydroxyl group in the racemic diol to obtain S-diol of formula (I) or an acylated derivative thereof with high optical purity and further that the enantiomers obtained may be effectively separated by reaction of the diol of formula (I) with a compound which form a derivative of the diol of formula (I) containing a carboxylic acid group. The derivative formed precipitates once it is formed and may easily be separated from the reaction mixture.<br>

According to another embodiment of the invention, Y in the compound of formula (IV) is NH.<br>
However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, Y in the compound of formula (IV) is a bond.<br>
Suitably, the substituent R1 in the compound of formula (IV) as defined in any of the embodiments above, is as follows: R1 is C1-6-alkyl, C2-6~alkenyl or C2-6-alkynyl all of which may optionally be substituted one or more times with substituents selected from C1-6-alkoxy, C1-6-alkylthio, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, cyano, C1-4-alkylamino and di-(C1-6-alkyl)amino, more suitable R1 is C1-6-alkyl, Ca-4-alkenyl or C2-4-allcynyl all of which may optionally be substituted one or more times with substituents selected from C1-4-alkoxy, C1-4-alkylthio, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, cyano, C1-4-alkylamino and di-(C1-4-alkyl)amino, preferably R1 is C1 -3-alkyl, C2-3-aIkenyl or C2-3-alkynyl all of which may optionally be substituted one or more times with C1-3-alkoxy, C1-3-alkylthio, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, cyano, C1-3-alkylamino and di-(C1-3-alkyl)amino, more preferred Rl is C1-3-alkyl, C2-3-alkenyl or C2-3-alkynyl, and more suitable R1 is C1-3-alkyl, in particular unbranched Ci-3-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl.<br><br>
The present invention is particularly useful for separation of compounds of formula (II) in the form of the S- or the R-enantiomer and the compound of formula (IV) in the form of the opposite enantiomer obtained by enzymatic resolution according to the processes described in WO application No. PCT/DK/ 0300537 published as WO2004/014821.<br>
Thus according to an embodiment of the invention, the mixture of a compound of formula (II) and (IV) used in the process is prepared by selective enzymatic acylation or selective enzymatic deacylation.<br>
A particular advantage of the present invention is that following formation, the compound of formula (V) precipitates from the reaction mixture and is thereafter easily isolated.<br>
Another particular advantage of the present invention is that (depending on the particular reagent of formula (la) -(Ic) used) it results in the separation and isolation of a product which may be ring closed directly to form escitalopram or a derivative thereof by treatment with a base.<br>
The reaction of the mixture of a compound of formula (II) in the form of one enantiomer with a compound of formula (la), (Ib) or (Ic) may be carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as tetrahydofuran, preferably a solvent in which the acid of formula (V) forms a precipitate and in an amount of the particular solvent where the acid of formula (V) forms a precipitate. Suitable solvents may be identified by the skilled person.<br>
Alternatively the reaction is performed in a solvent from which the acid of formula (V) does not form a precipitate and an anti-solvent is added after formation of the compound of formula (V) whereby the acid of formula (V) forms a precipitate.<br>
The reaction may suitably be carried out at or around room temperature (25 °C).<br><br>
The compound of formula V is suitably separated from the compound of formula (TV) by filtration or decanting, or by any other suitable way of separating a solid form a liquid.<br>
When the compound of formula V, which is isolated, is an S-enantiomer it may be ring closed directly by treatment with a base in a suitable organic solvent.<br>
Enantioselective ring-closure of an S-enantiomer of formula (V) to form escitalopram or another compound of formula (VI) may suitably be carried out by treatment of the compound of formula (V) with a base such as KOC(CH3)3 or other alkoxides, NaH or other hydrides, or amines such as triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine or pyridine, at low temperatures in an inert organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, DMSO, DMF, t-butyl methyl ether, dimethoxyethane, dimethoxymethane, dioxane, acetonitrile or dichloromethane. This process may be performed analogously to those described in US patent No. 4,943,590.<br>
In the same way, a compound of formula (IV) in the form of the S-enantiomer and separated from the reaction mixture may be subjected to ring closure by treatment with a base.<br>
In some cases, it may be advantageous to exchange the -CW-Y-R1 group in the compound of formula IV or the -CO-V group in the compound of formula (V) for a more labile group, before ring closure is carried out. Such labile groups (leaving groups) could typically be a group selected from methanesulfonyloxy, p-toluene-sulfonyloxy, 10-camphorsulfonyloxy, trifluoroacetyloxy and trifluoromethane-sulfonyloxy or halogen.<br>
Typically, the compound of formula (IV) or (V) is then subjected to hydrolysis to form the compound of formula (II) with aqueous base, such as NaOH, KOH or LiOH in water or alcohol or a mixture thereof and then reacted with an activated leaving group, such as a group -O-SO2-A wherein A is C1-6-alkyl, C2-6-alkenyl, C2-6-alkynyl or optionally C1-6-alkyl substituted aryl or aryl-C1-6 alkyl, particularly mesylchloride or tosylchloride, or trifluoroacetylchloride, acetylchloride or an form of formic acid such<br><br>
as a mixture of formic acid and acetic anhydride in an organic solvent in the presence of an organic base.<br>
Preferably, the substituent V in the compound of formula (V), is a substituent which enable direct ring closure of the compund of formula V by treatment with a base. Most preferred, V is -CH2-CH2-COOH or -CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH.<br>
The optical purity of the escitalopram product may have to be improved after ring closure. Improvement of the optical purity may be obtained by chromatography on a chiral stationary phase or by crystallisation of racemic citalopram base or a salt thereof according to the methods described in WO 03/000672.<br>
