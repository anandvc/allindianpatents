The invention relates to a coordination complex system comprising a ligand having at least two donor moieties, which are complexed to at least a metal selected from a transition metal and lanthanide, to a catalyst system comprising said coordination complex system, to the use of said coordination complex system, and to a set and the use thereof of self-complementary building blocks for making a ligand two donor moieties for complexatlon to a metal.<br>
During the past decades combinatorial chemistry has evolved in an incredible manner and has been applied especially in pharmacy for drug discovery and optimization and for making homogeneous catalysts. The development of homogeneous catalysts using combinatorial techniques involves two distinct challenges: 1) devising strategies and methods for the preparation of large libraries of ligands and/or catalyst displaying high degrees of structural diversity, 2) developing high-throughput screening techniques for the reaction of interest. A lot of effort has been put in the development of new screening techniques for homogeneous catalyst libraries and various methods have proven successful. In the search for new transition metal catalysts the preparation of catalyst libraries has mainly been focused on variation of ligands, which are based on commercially available ligands or are prepared via conventional synthetic pathways and/or divergent methods using parallel synthesis. The synthesis of large libraries of new ligands indeed yields a major challenge and so far only a limited number of methodologies have been reported. Until now, library synthesis of ligands is based on combinatorial organic synthesis<br><br>
followed by metal complexation. This approach utilizes advanced solid and solution phase combinatorial synthetic methodologies including parallel synthesis, split-pool techniques, encoding/deconvolution and polymer-supported reagents. Methods such as split pool techniques are much faster than traditional serial approaches and enable the preparation of relatively large numbers of compounds but often lack control over the purity and mixtures of compounds entering the assay screen. In contrast, the methods based on parallel or array syntheses yield intermediate sized libraries of pure compounds. Although these combinatorial techniques to construct ligand libraries have proven to be valuable, the preparation and evaluation of truly large numbers of potentially (enantio)-selective catalysts has not been reported and the application is still limited to a few catalytic reactions. Moreover, the preparation of important multidentate ligands, like promising diphosphorus ligands, faces synthetic challenges, especially when sophisticated chiral entities are required for asymmetric catalysis. There is a need to develop new tools to efficiently deal with these synthetic challenges.<br>
The present invention provides in such tool, and further provides new effective supramolecular techniques to :;onstruct ligands, particularly bidentate ligands, which can 3e formed by just mixing monomeric compounds. For instance, a 3hosphorus monodentate ligand building block equipped with a '.inc{II) porphyrin moiety, can selectively bind monodentate juilding block that have a nitrogen donor atom. These selective metal-ligand interactions (Zn-N) are utilized for :he assembly of ligand systems and yield novel transition \etal catalysts. Upon variation of the phosphorus monodentate -.ompounds a matrix of new self-assembled mono- and bidentate .igands can be created easily. This novel supramolecular itrategy to prepare new assembled ligands was successfully<br><br>
applied in a combinatorial fashion and clearly simplifies the construction of catalyst libraries, for instance based on sophisticated phosphite-phosphine chelating ligands.<br>
There is an increasing demand for metal catalysts and the number of tailor-made transition metal catalysts for various chemical transformations is ever increasing, however, the practical use of these homogenous catalysts is limited by the cumbersome separation from the product-phase. So far, many different methods of catalyst recycling have been studied, including two-phase catalysis, supported aqueous phase catalysis, fluorous phase catalysis, the use of ionic liquids and supercritical fluids. An amply studied approach to facilitate catalyst-product separation is the attachment of homogeneous catalysts to dendritic, polymeric organic, inorganic or hybrid supports.<br>
In most supported catalysts reported so far the catalyst has been covalently linked to the support. An interesting alternative approach is the anchoring of the catalyst to the support. Only a few examples have been reported for non-covalent bonding, for example, the immobilization via ionic interactions. Cationic transition metal catalysts have been immobilized on heteropoly acids and silica support via ion-pairing. This appeared to be a viable approach for cationic rhodium catalysts that are active in hydrogenation reactions, but the concept is obviously limited to charged catalysts.<br>
The problem of all these approaches is the cumbersome independent syntheses of the various catalysts systems that are necessary for the different systems to be catalyzed. In D. de Groot et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2001, 123, 8453-58 a nethod was disclosed wherein phosphine ligands for :omplexation with palladium were non-covalently assembled to a zemplate of urea adamantly-functionalized poly(propylene Lmine) dendrimer. However, the templates are unevenly<br><br>
distributed over the support. Such method is unsuitable for making catalyst systems in a controlled manner, and therefore catalyst systems are obtained with unpredictable properties.<br>
It is therefore an objective of the present invention to obtain a method enabling a flexible and versatile synthesis of tailor-made catalytic systems for metal-catalyzed reactions. Other objectives such as immobilizing well-defined binding sites based on different binding motives on, for instance, silica support that can be non-covalently functionalized with catalysts that have ligands with the complementary motive will become clear herein below.<br>
The implementation of supramolecular strategies simplifies the preparation of new catalysts materials significantly since the components will find their way by assembly. Apart from this advantage, the dynamic nature of the non-covalent interactions leads to materials with new catalytic properties, e.g. the catalyst may adapt its structure during the catalytic cycle adjusting its properties for the next step. Sets of (mostly known) orthogonal interactions based on metal-ligand interactions, hydrogen bonding consisting of different binding motives, polar/ionic interactions (for examples see chart I, wherein A denotes acceptor and D denotes donor) with which the components can be functionalized may be employed. By means of assembly, the Ligation around the metal center, the chiral environment, the presence of a substrate binding site and the local polarity iround the catalysts can be controlled. These are key )arameters that direct catalyst properties as activity and lelectivity. Moreover, by functionalization of several supports catalysts can be immobilized reversibly on endrimers, silica, monolayers in an easy manner, enabling the apid accumulation of information on the impact of catalyst mmobilization on its performance. This leads to an extremely ersatile modular approach, in which the environment of the<br><br>
catalysts can be controlled by reversible connection to supports, chiral environments, substrate binding-sites, mono¬layers and aggregates, thereby creating a new set of selective catalysts systems. The approach of non-covalent anchoring also enables controlled de-functionalization of support, which enables the separation and re-use of support and catalyst. This can be relevant for multi-purpose reactors since the support can stay in the reactor while the catalyst (the same in the case of deactivation and a different one in the case a new reaction is required) can be replaced.<br>
The term "non-covalent" has the common meaning as used by the skilled person, i.e. any chemical or physical bonding that is not covalent. Non-covalent bonding, for example, includes bonding via ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and reversible metal-ligand interactions.<br>
The spatial orientation of donor atoms coordinating to the catalytically active transition metal is of crucial importance for the properties in catalysis. Conventionally, these donor atoms were attached covalently to a ligand Dackbone thereby, depending on the rigidity of the backbone, 2nforcing (or supporting) certain coordination geometries iround metal. In this Invention this rigid conventional ipproach has been replaced by a non-covalent approach to :ontrol the ligation by assembly of ligands direct via omplementary building blocks or by building blocks non-ovalently bonded to each other via a template. Thus the nvention pertains to a coordination complex system comprising<br>
ligand having at least two donor moieties, which are omplexed to at least a metal selected from a transition metal id lanthanide, characterized in that the ligand comprises at sast two building blocks, each having at least one functional roup and at least one donor moiety, wherein one building .ock is non-covalently bonded through its functional group to complementary functional group of another building block or<br><br>
of a template, wherein the template comprises at least one other functional group that is non-covalently bonded to a complementary functional group of another building block, and wherein all building block-template-building block structures are the same when the template contains more than two functional groups. The dynamic character of the system may lead to special reactivity of the catalyst system and it also enables the formation of dynamic combinatorial catalyst systems based on transition metal from which the catalyst can be selected by adding a selector, for instance a transition state analogue.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention at least one of the building blocks is immobilized onto an inorganic support, a polymeric organic support, or a hybrid support. The building blocks preferably have a molecular weight less than 5,000, more preferably less than 2,500. The chiral environment will also be controlled by assembly and it was shown that zinc(II) porphyrins in combination with pyridyl-phosphine building blocks are suitable for this approach. The pyridine is selectively coordinated to the zinc and the phosphine donor is still available for coordination to the catalytically active transition metal.<br>
In another embodiment the coordination complex system comprises a ligand having at least two donor moieties, which are complexed to at least a metal selected from a transition  [ metal and lanthanide, characterized in that the ligand comprises 2 to 6 building blocks each having at least one functional group and at least one donor moiety, wherein at least one building block is non-covalently bonded through its functional group to a complementary functional group of a template.<br>
The system may further comprise a co-factor that is non-covalently bonded to a functional group of the ligand.<br><br>
Such co-factor may be covalently bonded to another building block, or to the template or support.<br>
When the template contains more than two functional groups all building block-template-building block structures are the same. For instance, when the template contains 8 functional groups and two functional groups form a pair whereas the six other functional groups form three similar other pairs, two building blocks are non-covalently attached to each of these pairs, and not to one functional group of the first pair and one functional group of another pair when such bonding gives rise to different spatial orientations (configurations) of the various building block-template-building block moieties. It should further be noted that if not all building blocks are the same and two different building blocks are used for attachment to one pair of functional groups, the same two different building blocks are used for attachment to the other pairs.<br>
The properties of the assembly may be different from the prior art catalysts, which for instance can result in higher reaction rates in the palladium catalyzed Heck reaction and the rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation. Moreover, using bis-zinc-porphyrin systems as templates resulted in chelating bidentate ligands of which the catalytic performance (in activity and (enantio-)selectivity) strongly depended on the components of the assembly. These results show that dynamic non-covalent interactions are sufficient to impose spatial orientation of ligands and that the assemblies are stable under catalytic conditions. The metal-ligand interactions are used to make new ligand assemblies. Moreover, different hydrogen bond building blocks can be used to make bidentate ligands by assembly. Examples of some of the hydrogen bond building blocks that can be used are shown in Chart I. One should note that these building blocks could be used for several concepts according to this invention.<br><br>
Two identical building blocks can be assembled around a template resulting in a bidentate ligand with properties that depend on the template. A representative example is a building block comprising urea functionalities and benz-amidine, which can be used to form complexes with small anionic templates. The orientation of two urea units will strongly depend on the template. The catalytic performance of the assemblies can also be used as diagnostic tool by studying several reactions that are known to be sensitive to geometry changes (such as hydroformylation, carbonylation and allylic substitution). Employing cationic transition or lanthanide metal complexes (e.g. asymmetric hydrogenation, hydrovinyl-ation) is of special interest since the counter-ion will be fixed at a certain distance from the metal. This is believed to give special effects in catalysis and in the formation of the cationic complexes. The coordination complex system preferably has a molar ratio between the ligand and the metal of between 0.2 and 100.<br>
The invention further relates to a catalyst system comprising the above-mentioned coordination complex system and the use of the coordination complex system as a catalyst, preferably for hydroformylation, hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, hydrocyanation, polymerization, isomerization, carbonylation, cross-coupling, metathesis, CH activation, allylic substitution, aldol condensation, and Michael addition.<br>
For many reactions bidentate ligands with different donor atoms offer a higher level of control of the selectivity. For this purpose approaches are required that enable the selective assembly of different building blocks. This is done by making sets of building blocks with functional groups that associate with the complementary functional groups attached to either another building block, enabling direct formation of the ligand, or to a template equipped with a<br><br>
plurality of the same or different functional groups. Complementary binding motives of a series of ligands (phosphines, phosphites) utilized are shown in Chart I. By just mixing the proper compounds chelating mono- and bi-dentates were formed, facilitating the easy formation of. different combinations. In addition the same building blocks can be assembled onto a template with the same complementary binding functional groups (Figure 1),<br>

Fig. 1. Li and L2 are coordination moieties of the building blocks, M is transition or lanthanide metal. A) is an embodiment using a template; B) is an embodiment using self-complementary building blocks.<br>
In that case the shape of the template will also affect the catalytic performance of the supramolecular system. The templates may include calix-arenes and rigid multi-aromatic systems. Bisporphyrin templates with two different metals are also suitable templates: nitrogen donor will coordinate selectively to the zinc atom and tin porphyrins are known to strongly coordinate carboxylate groups.<br>
Systems functionalized with two orthogonal binding sites can be prepared in which the catalyst and either the substrate molecule or a chiral cofactor can be fixed in a well-defined way using non-covalent interactions. In a straightforward example based on porphyrins the binding of the transition (or lanthanide) metal will be based on hydrogen bonding (ionic interactions) and the (guest) cofactor will be bound using metal-ligand interactions (such as pyridine-zinc coordination). The binding on the porphyrin can be used for several types of guests including amino acids. Several<br><br>
analogues with different hydrogen bond functional groups thereby changing the position of the catalysts with respect to the binding site can be made. It was found that the dynamic binding of both the catalysts as the substrate molecule is an efficient strategy towards host-guest catalysis. In a slightly different approach chiral cofactors were assembled using metal-building block interactions, for instance based on selective bipyridine-metal complexation, such as in:<br><br><br>
Q /^ /==V ,0<br>
\         ^                 ^P~M    Zn,Cu(ll)<br>
M—PPh2       Ph2     	&gt;-<br>
R &gt;-( \-i y-^ ^<br>
^y-N ^N N-^ H-O	s.s<br><br>
One of these components may be functionalized with :hiral information, whereas the other contains the atalytically active phosphine-metal complex. A major dvantage over the conventional approaches is that large ibraries of chiral catalysts can be assembled easily, compared to covalent synthesis) which is important onsidering the fact that new substrates generally require ovel modified catalysts. The invention therefore also relates D the use of at least two building blocks each having at sast one functional group, wherein a functional group of one lilding block is complementary to a functional group of lother building block or of a template to form through their motional groups a non-covalent bond between the building -ocks or between the building blocks and the template, to &gt;tain a ligand that with the metal forms the coordination )mplex system.<br><br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a set of self-complementary building blocks for making a ligand having at least two donor moieties for complexation to a metal selected from a transition metal and lanthanide, wherein the ligand comprises the set of building blocks, each building block having at least one functional group that is complementary to a functional group of another building block or of a template, and at least one donor moiety, wherein the building blocks are non-covalently bonded to each other or to the template through their complementary functional groups.<br>
The invention further pertains to the set comprising self-complementary building blocks, and optionally templates for making a ligand. The set may also comprise metals for coordination, for the above-mentioned use.<br>
As an example A3B1 tetraarylporphyrins as well as trans-AaBa tetraarylporphyrins can easily be made by well-established synthetic procedures. As reactive groups for further functionalization amines and isothiocyanate groups can be introduced, which are both reactive and easily accessible. Thus for instance porphyrins can be prepared (large quantities) and used as synthons for the synthesis of building blocks required for different ways of non-covalent immobilization.<br>
Examples of approaches of making tailor-made catalysts on a support are mixing trialkoxy-functionalized porphyrin with commercially available silica, immobilization via a sol-gel process, pre-assembly of the transition metal complex prior to immobilization, and post-modification of the immobilized porphyrins with the catalysts.<br>
Synthetically easily accessible porphyrins, which are expected to form well-defined aggregates such as micelles and vesicles due to their amphiphilic character, can also be made according to this approach. Amphiphiles that form well-defined aggregates can be used for the assembly of catalysts. These<br><br>
amphiphiles can be prepared via ion-pairing by mixing a bis-anion with cationic amphiphiles.<br>
An extension to functionalized block copolymers (based on porphyrins, carbosilane dendrimers and polystyrene units) is also possible to give interesting systems with control over aggregation and microphase separation by differences in polarity (i.e. araphiphilic systems), incompati¬bilities in conformational flexibility and in volume filling, characteristics of the component blocks. Several examples of building blocks according to the invention are given in Chart II. Some of the templates are given in Chart III. On the basis of these examples the skilled person can easily envisage other building blocks and templates. The number of ligands (made from building blocks, and optionally, templates, that is accessible for the non-covalent anchoring is virtually infinite, and several building blocks and templates are commercial available- In Chart IV examples are given of building blocks that are non-covalently bonded to a support (in the example a silica support).<br>
An important class of compounds, related to porphyrins, which is suitable for the approaches described in :his patent comprise the bis(salicylaldimine) metal complexes. Che great advantage of the building blocks is the synthetic availability and the structural variations possible. The axial coordination to bis (salicylaldimine)-zinc is two orders of magnitude larger then to the zinc-porphyrin analogue.<br>
The invention is further clarified and exemplified by ;he following examples.<br>
