				<td>"Composition sensitive to IR radiation and to heat and lithographic<br>
plate coated therewith"<br>
************<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition sensitive to IR radiation and to heat, and a lithographic plate coated with this composition.<br>
In particular, it relates to a composition sensitive to IR radiation and to heat which is useful for the production of a lithographic plate of the positive type.<br>
It also relates to a composition sensitive to laser radiation which is useful for the production of a lithographic plate of the positive type.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
As is well-known, the technique of printing by means of lithographic plates is based on differential partition between fatty substances and water. The fatty substance or ink is retained preferentially by the image area and the water is preferentially retained by the non-image area. When the surface of a lithographic plate, suitably prepared, is moistened with water and then sprinkled with ink, the non-image area retains the water and repels the ink, while the image area accepts the ink and repels the water. Then, the ink on the image area is transferred onto the surface of a material on which it is desired to reproduce the image, such as, for example, paper, textile and the like.<br>
In general, the lithographic plates used in printing processes are formed from an aluminium support covered with a composition sensitive to light (photosensitive). When such a composition becomes soluble in an alkaline developing bath through the action of heat or of radiation of appropriate wavelength, the printing process is termed "positive". Conversely, when the portion exposed to heat or to radiation of appropriate wavelength becomes insoluble in an alkaline developing<br><br>
bath, the printing process is termed "negative". In both cases, the remaining, image area is lipophilic and hence accepts the ink, while the non-image area is hydrophilic and accepts the water.<br>
The recent developments in the field of lithographic plates have been directed towards the search for compositions sensitive to laser light, preferably in the near IR. In particular, to laser light controlled by software, in such a way as directly to transfer the image created by computer onto the surface of the plate. This technique has the advantage of eliminating the photographic films, with consequent reduction in the pollution due to the chemical substances used for the preparation and production of these and elimination of all the problems that arise in the transfer of the image onto the plate via photographic films.<br>
In the first place, a composition sensitive to radiation emitted by a laser could impart greater reliability to the system.<br>
Secondly, it would be possible to work under ambient illumination, thus eliminating the automatic loading systems or the darkrooms.<br>
With the aim of attaining this objective, in recent years many compositions comprising a polymeric binder and a solubility inhibitor have been investigated. Such a solubility inhibitor has the ability to render the polymeric binder insoluble in a suitable alkaline developing bath as long as it has not been exposed to a sufficient quantity of heat and of then rendering it soluble in the said developing bath after such exposure to heat. Besides the aforesaid components, many of the compositions described until now also comprise a so-called IR absorber, usually consisting of a compound capable of absorbing IR radiation and of transforming part of the radiation absorbed into heat, giving it up to the immediately surrounding environment.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention aims to provide a composition sensitive to heat and a lithographic plate of the positive type coated with the said composition wherein the solubility inhibitor consists of an organometallic compound, excluding the metallocenes, or an organic salt of a metal of the group IIIA or transition group of the periodic chart of the elements.<br>

The present invention is further described by the following Examples and Tests, which are solely for illustrative purposes and must not be considered to limit the invention.<br>
EXPERIMENTS<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of compositions sensitive to heat and to IR radiation<br>
The mixture (6 g) of the components indicated in the following Tables was dissolved at ambient temperature (ca. 25*^C) in 94 g of a 30 : 70 (w/w) acetone : methoxypropanol mixture, stirring until complete dissolution of the components.<br>
The solution obtained was filtered through paper using a filter of the 0860 type from the firm Schleicher &amp; Schuell (100 mm).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The values indicate the first step visible independently of the thickness of the remaining coating; the value 1 is equivalent to a time of 1 minute and the value 6 is equivalent to a time of 6 minutes. The resistance of the composition to the solution used is highest for the value 6 and lowest or zero resistance for the value 1,<br>
TEST 4 Exposure to IR radiation<br>
Six different zones of a plate having the same weight distribution per unit area were exposed using a laser beam, controlled by software and having a nominal wavelength 830 nm (all composition except for<br><br>
composition No. 18) and nominal wavelength 1060 nm (composition No. 18 only), at the following energy values/cm2: 300 mJ/cm2 250 mJ/cm2, 150 mJ/cm2, 100 mJ/cm2 75 mJ/cm2 and 50 mJ/cm2.<br>
The exposed plates were immediately developed in a tray using, as reference, LAP98 from the firm Lastra S.p.A. as developer at a temperature of from 24 to 25°C for 45 seconds of immersion time with stirring plus 15 seconds of wiping with a cotton pad.<br>
The results of the test are shown in Table 12 and 12bis.<br><br><br><br>
A corresponds to an emulsion weight of 1.6 -1.8 g/m2. B corresponds to an emulsion weight of 2.0 - 2.2 g/m2.<br>
The term "cleanness of the base" is used to mean that the developer has removed the composition from the regions that have been exposed to laser radiations.<br>
TESTS Resistance to mechanical abrasion<br>
To simulate the mechanical and chemical abrasion which a plate undergoes during the printing cycle, samples of plates corresponding to the compositions from 1-4 and 7, 18-25 were fixed to a level surface and placed in close contact with a cotton pad soaked in a 50% solution of isopropyl alcohol. The pad was moved by an arm attached to a compressed air system capable of imparting an oscillatory motion with consequent rubbing of the samples under examination. For each composition, the maximum number of passes before the complete removal of the emulsion was recorded. The results expressed in number of passes are reproduced in the following Table 13.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
