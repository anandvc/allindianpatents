Description<br>
5<br>
	The present invention relates to a composition which<br>
	comprises as active ingredients a combination of<br>
	melatonin, ginkgo biloba and biotin. The composition is<br>
	particularly suitable for producing formulations for<br>
10	topical application in the hair.<br>
	The use of melatonin for beneficially influencing hair<br>
	growth is known. Melatonin has a stimulating effect on<br>
	hair growth due to the selective interaction with<br>
15	proliferating cells of the hair follicies which control<br>
	the growth of hair. This stimulating effect can be<br>
	observed with the use of different concentrations of<br>
	melatonin.<br>
20	US-Patent 5,952,373 describes a method for the<br>
	treatment of skin, in which a composition which<br>
	comprises as active ingredient one or more flavonoids<br>
	is applied. There is no reference to the use of<br>
	melatonin as active ingredient for improving hair<br>
25	growth.<br>
	US patent application US 2002/0061370 discloses a<br>
	composition for the amelioration of hearing loss or<br>
	tinnitus. This composition, which is administered in<br>
30	form of a tablet, comprises a large number of active<br>
	ingredients, optionally also including melatonin,<br>
	biotin or ginkgo biloba. There is no reference to the<br>
	use for improving hair growth or to topical<br>
	application.<br>
35<br>
	It has surprisingly been found in the investigations<br>
	leading to the present invention that the addition of<br>
	ginkgo biloba and biotin in simultaneous use of<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
	melatonin enhance the effect of melatonin, and<br>
	retention of melatonin on the surface of the scalp is<br>
	increased.<br>
5	One aspect of the present invention is thus a<br>
	composition which comprises as active ingredients (a)<br>
	melatonin or a derivative thereof, (b) ginkgo biloba as<br>
	extract or/and one or more constituents thereof and<br>
	(c) biotin. The composition is preferably a topical<br>
10	formulation suitable for pharmaceutical or/and cosmetic<br>
	uses, in particular for application to the scalp.<br>
	The composition of the invention comprises a<br>
	combination of active ingredients. The first component<br>
15	of this combination is melatonin or a melatonin<br>
	derivative. Melatonin derivatives are preferably<br>
	selected from 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-methoxytryptophan,<br>
	5-methoxytryptophol, 5-methoxyindole-3-acetic acid and<br>
	6-hydroxymelatonin. Besides these substances it is also<br>
20	possible to employ physiologically acceptable salts,<br>
	esters and complex compounds thereof.<br>
	The second component of the composition is ginkgo<br>
	biloba. Ginkgo biloba has a beneficial influence on<br>
25	various metabolic functions, A further advantageous<br>
	property of ginkgo is the enhancement of the potential<br>
	for trapping free radicals. A ginkgo biloba is<br>
	preferably used as extract, in particular as dry<br>
	extract, or/and one or more constituents thereof. Dry<br>
30	extracts from ginkgo leaves are particularly suitable<br>
	for use of the composition of the invention.<br>
	A further component of the composition of the invention<br>
	is biotin. Biotin displays its effect for example as<br>
35	coenzyme in fatty acid and aminc acid metabolism, e.g,<br>
	in transcarboxylation reactions.<br>
	The concentration of the active ingredients in the<br>
	composition can be varied within wide limits -<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	depending on the use. It is beneficial for the<br>
	concentrations of the active ingredients each to be<br>
	independently in the range between 0.0001% (weight) to<br>
	1% (weight) based on the total weight of the<br>
5	composition. The concentration of melatonin or a<br>
	melatonin derivative is preferably 0.001% (weight) to<br>
	0-01% (weight). The concentration of ginkgo biloba is<br>
	preferably 0.01% (weight) to 0.1% (weight). The<br>
	concentration of biotin is preferably 0.002% (weight)<br>
10	to 0.05% (weight).<br>
	Preferably about 0.001 mg to about 10 mg, preferably<br>
	about 0.01 mg to about 1 mg, of melatonin or melatonin<br>
	derivative are administered per application.<br>
15<br>
	The three active ingredient components of the<br>
	composition of the invention display a profile of<br>
	effects which promotes hair growth, provides protection<br>
	from aging, improves hair thickness or/and reduces the<br>
20	teiogen rate. The effect of melatonin on the hair<br>
	follicle is surprisingly enhanced by the combination<br>
	with ginkgo biloba and biotin. It is thus possible to<br>
	employ even very low concentrations of melatonin, for<br>
	example about 0.001-10 mg, preferably about 0.01-1 mg<br>
25	per application, with a satisfactory effect.<br>
	The combination of melatonin, ginkgo biloba and biotin<br>
	can be administered in a suitable carrier system. The<br>
	active ingredients are preferably present as solution<br>
30	or/and dispersion in a liquid, semisolid or solid<br>
	carrier system. Examples of suitable carrier systems<br>
	are liquids such as water or aqueous buffer solutions,<br>
	physiologically tolerated organic solvents such as<br>
	ethanol or combinations thereof, oil-water emulsions,<br>
35	water-oil emulsions, fats, polyethylene glycols,<br>
	propylene glycols, glyceral, emulsifiers or<br>
	combinations thereof, and other carriers or excipients<br>
	used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	The use of an aqueous carrier system, i.e., a carrier<br>
	system with a water content of 50% (weight) or more, in<br>
	particular of 60% (weight) or more, is preferred. The<br>
	pH of an aqueous carrier system is preferably adjusted<br>
5	in a range between pH 3 and pH 6, particularly<br>
	preferably in the range from pH 3.5 and pH 4.<br>
	These carrier systems advantageously enable targeted<br>
	delivery of the active ingredients to the hair<br>
10	follicle. The placement of the active ingredients in<br>
	the hair follicle is optimized thereby. Controlled<br>
	absorption of the melatonin, qinkgo biloba and biotin<br>
	active ingredients can moreover be made possible by the<br>
	carrier system.<br>
15<br>
	The processing of melatonin with ginkgo biloba and<br>
	biotin in suitable carrier systems may in addition lead<br>
	to a prevention or delay of melatonin absorption. The<br>
	normal human plasma level is not influenced thereby. In<br>
20	addition, a longer-lasting effect of the active.<br>
	ingredients can be achieved.<br>
	Stable formulations used in cosmetics, especially in<br>
	the form of cosmetics solutions, can be obtained by<br>
25	formulation in a carrier system.<br>
	In the use of specific formulation systems such as<br>
	liposomes, nanosomes or solid inclusion carriers such<br>
	as agarose it is possible to obtain compositions which<br>
30	permit controlled delivery of at least one of the<br>
	active ingredients, in particular of all the active<br>
	ingredients.<br>
	The compositions of the inversion are particularly<br>
35	suitable for pharmaceutical or/and cosmetic<br>
	applications, for example in hair. The compositions may<br>
	be in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion,<br>
	microemulsion, nanosystem, cream, gel, lotion, spray,<br>
	foam or ointment or any other form suitable for topical<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
	applications. They are normally employed in a packaging<br>
	or application system selected from tubes, bottles,<br>
	spray bottles, patches, sponges and textile or plastics<br>
	carriers and other systems suitable for application in<br>
5	the hair. A particularly preferred packaging system are<br>
	single-dose ampules which provide a dosage unit for one<br>
	application. The ampules may be fabricated from various<br>
	materials, e.g. from glass or plastics. Plastics<br>
	ampules are particularly preferred because plastics<br>
10	ampules ensure safe and satisfactory handling.<br>
	Besides the active ingredients, the compositions of the<br>
	invention may comprise one or more cosmetic or/and<br>
	pharmaceutical excipients or additives, for example<br>
15	thickeners, minerals, oils, vitamins, e.g. vitamin A,<br>
	especially in the form of retinoic acid, or fragrances.<br>
	The combination preparations of the invention are<br>
	recommended in particular for application in the,<br>
20	evening and display their effect in particular during,<br>
	the night. With this mode of application, the effect of<br>
	the composition is particularly strong. The<br>
	compositions of the invention are particularly suitable<br>
	for stimulation of the hair follicles and a beneficial<br>
25	influence on hair growth.<br>
	The treatment takes place in particular in topical<br>
	applications suitable for use in the hair, which<br>
	comprise the appropriate concentrations suitable for<br>
30	the particular purpose of use of the active.<br>
	ingredients.<br>
	The composition of the invention can be employed for<br>
	promoting hair growth, in particular for the prevention<br>
35	or/and treatment of alopecia in men or in women.<br>
	Particularly preferred indications are male-type<br>
	androgenic alopecia, female-type androgsnic alopecia,<br>
	male-type diffuse alopecia and female-type diffuse<br>
	alopecia.<br><br>
