INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
The present application relates to magnesium amides, a method for the preparation of magnesium amides and the use of these amides.<br>
The metalation of aromatics is one of the most useful transformations in organic synthesis since it allows the regioselective functionaJization of various aryl derivatives.[1] Traditionally, strong bases such as alkyl lithium (RLi) or lithium amides (R2NLi) have been used to perform such deprotonations. However, these highly reactive bases display often undesirable side reactions due to the too high reactivity of the resulting aryl lithium compounds. Another serious limitation is the low stability of lithium amides in THF solutions at room temperature which requires an in situ generation of these reagents. Furthermore, the deprotonation of aromatics by lithium bases often requires very low temperatures (-78°C to -90°C) which comptieates .the scale-up of these inactions and the use of solvent mixtures such as THF/pentane may be needed.<br>
Alternative methods have been developed using magnesium amides123 such as compounds 1-3 or amido zincates[3] 4 (see Scheme 1). The low solubility of the magnesium amides R2NMgCl (1) could be improved by Eaton who developed the use of magnesium amides of type R2NMgR' (2) and (R2N)2Mg (3). Nevertheless, for achieving high conversions it is usually necessary to use a large excess of the magnesium amides (2-8 equivalents), which complicates further quenching reactions with electrophiles (up to 15 equivalents of electrophile may have to be used). Similarly, the dialkyl amino zincate 4 requires the use of 3.5-4 equivalents of an electrophile in subsequent quenching reactions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme 1. Typical bases used for the deprotonation of aromatics or heterocycles.<br>
The use of these bases is thus either limited by their poor solubility, or they are not very efficient in view of the amounts of base and the amount of electrophile needed to perform the desired conversion. Their activity or reactivity is very low.<br>
2<br><br>
The use of lithium salts to increase the solubility of Grignard reagents is known from EP 1 582 523. In this application, the main function of the Grignard reagents of the general formula R (MgX)n LiY disclosed therein is to perform a halogen/magnesium exchange in either aliphatic or aromatic systems. The Grignard reagent derivatives provide a "nucleophilic carbon atom" at a magnesium-carbon-bond. By the addition of a lithium salt to the Grignard reagent, the reactivity of the Grignard reagents can be increased by forming a magnesiate intermediate. These Grignard reagents then show a higher reactivity and selectivity due to the formation of a magnesiate intermediate.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an inexpensive magnesium base which is highly soluble and more reactive. A further object of the present invention is to provide a magnesium base showing a high kinetic activity and a high selectivity.<br>
These objects are achieved by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are set forth in the dependent claims.<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors found that mixed magnesium and lithium amides of type R'R2N-MgX zLiY (I) can be prepared by reacting an amine R!R2NH with a Grignard reagent R'MgX in the presence of LiY or with R'MgX zLiY in a solvent.<br>
  I)<br>
Rl, R2 and R' independently are selected from substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl containing one or more heteroatoms, linear, branched or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or derivatives thereof, and, for R and R only, the silyl derivatives thereof. One of R1 and R2 may be H; or R1 and R2 together can be part of a cyclic or polymeric structure.<br>
X and Y independently are selected from the group consisting of F; CI; Br; I; CN; SCN; NCO; HalOn, wherein n = 3 or 4 and Hal is selected from CI, Br and I; N03; BF4; PF6; H; a carboxylate of the general formula RXC02; an alcoholate of the general formula ORx; a<br>
3<br><br>
thiolate of the general formula SRX; RxP(0)02; or SCORx; OnSRx, wherein n = 2 or 3; or NOn, wherein n = 2 or 3; and a derivative thereof; wherein Rx is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl containing one or more heteroatoms; linear, branched or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or derivatives thereof; or H.<br>
X and Y may be identical or different. In the above given context, z &gt; 0.<br>
The amides of formula I can also be prepared in an alternative way by reacting a lithium amide of the formula R R NLi with a magnesium salt of the form MgXj or Mg XY. This reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent. In order to achieve a compound of formula I, the magnesium salt and the lithium amide are reacted in approximately equimolar ratio. Thus, the ratio of lithium amide to magnesium salt is usually in the range of 1:0.8-l .2, preferably in the range of 1:0.9-1.1, and most preferably in the range of 1 ;0.95-1.05.<br>
Additionally, the inventors found that magnesium bisamides of the general formula<br>
R1R2N-Mg(NR3R4)MX1-M zLiY        (II)<br>
can be prepared. In this formula, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are, independently, selected from H, substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl containing one or more heteroatoms, linear, branched or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or silyl derivatives thereof; and R1 and R2 together, and/or R3 and R4 together can be part of a cyclic or polymeric structure; and wherein at least one of R1 and R2 and at least one of R3 and R4 is other than H.<br>
X and Y are, independently, selected from the group consisting of F; CI; Br; I; CN; SCN; NCO; HalOn , wherein n = 3 or 4 and Hal is selected from CI, Br and I; N03; BF4; PF6; H; a carboxylate of the general formula RxC02; an alcoholats of the general formula ORx; a thiolate of the general formula SRx; RxP(0)02; or SCORx; or SCSRx; OnSRx, wherein n - 2 or 3; or NOn, wherein n = 2 or 3; and a derivative thereof; wherein Rx is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl containing one or more heteroatoms, linear, branched or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or derivatives thereof, or H;<br>
4<br><br>
in the above given formula II, m is 0 or 1; and z &gt; 0. For m = 0, the compounds of formula II are identical to the compounds of formula I. The adduct with a solvent should also be encompassed by any of the compounds of formula I or II.<br>
The bisamides of the general formula II wherein m = 1 can be prepared from the monoamides of formula I. When reacting R1R2N-MgXzLiY with R3R4NLi, a bisamide of formula II is formed. This reaction is equivalent to a reaction of a generally known Grignard reagent R'MgX in the presence of an amine R'R NH, and subsequently with R3R4NLi. The lithium may also be added as a lithium salt in the form LiY, especially when the Grignard reagent or the monoamide are not complexed with a lithium salt. Obviously, the reagent may also be of the form R R N-MgX zLiY, wherein a lithium salt is already present with the monoamide. In this way, bisamides may be prepared, wherein the two amides are different. However, the two amides may also be the same.<br>
Alternatively, the bisamides may be prepared by reacting two lithium amides R'R2NLI and R3R4NLi with a magnesium salt MgX2- If both lithium amides are identical, or a magnesium monoamide is reacted with a lithium amide of the same type, a bisamide of the general formula Mg(NR1R2)2 zLiY will result. For a higher solubility of the magnesium salt MgX2, this salt may be prepared in situ, for example as described below.<br>
Both the monoamides as well as the bisamides of the present invention show an increased solubility and a high reactivity. Unlike Grignard reagents, which can perform halogen/magnesium exchanges, the amides of the present invention are bases which will tolerate many functional groups, especially halogen substituents. This is due to the different nature of the nitrogen magnesium bond present in the amides of the present application in view of a carbon magnesium bond as in Grignard reagents. The increase in reactivity of the Grignard reagents in the presence of a lithium salt is due to the formation of magnesiate intermediates. In contrast thereto, however, the lithium salt which is added to the amides according to the present application prevents the formation of aggregates. The formation of aggregates is a well known problem in the background art in relation to magnesium amides. As a consequence, the amides known so far have to be used in high excess as they are not very reactive. As the amides of the present invention are not present as aggregates due to the presence of a lithium salt, the amides are much more reactive and more soluble than the amides known so far.<br>
5<br><br>
Many common solvents can be used in the present invention. In principle, any solvent capable of dissolving the specific amine and the Grignard reagent used as starting materials and the resulting products. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solvent is selected from cyclic, linear or branched mono or polyethers, thioethers, amines, phosphines, and derivatives thereof containing one or more additional heteroatoms selected from O, N, S and P, preferably tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, dibutyl ether, diethyl ether, tert-butylmethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, dioxanes, preferably 1,4-dioxane, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, dimethyl sulfide, dibutylsulfide; cyclic amides, preferably N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP), N-butyl-2-pyrrolidone (NBP); cyclic, linear or branched alkanes and/or alkenes wherein one or more hydrogens are replaced by a halogen, preferably dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, CC14; urea derivatives, preferably N,N'-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU); aromatic, heteroaromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably benzene, toluene, xylene, pyridine, pentane, cyclohexane, hexane, heptane; hexamethylphosphorus triamide (HMPA), CS2; or combinations thereof.<br>
rhe process of the invention for the preparation of amides of formula I is carried out by eacting an amine R!R2NH with a Grignard reagent R'MgX in the presence of LiY or with R/MgX zLiY in a solvent. The materials are contacted preferably at room temperature for the Tiinirnum time necessary to provide the desired yield. Temperatures between 0°C and 50°C ire preferred, however, higher or lower reaction temperatures are also suitable. The preparation of the bisamides of formula II is usually carried out at temperatures between 40°C and 50°C, preferably in the range of-20°C to 30°C and most preferred at around 0°C. \ person skilled in the art will however be able to select a suitable temperature for the preparation of the amides of formula I or II by routine experimentation.<br>
n another preferred embodiment, X and Y are independently or both CI, Br or I, and preferably CI.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the preparation of a compound a formula I is achieved by j'PrMgCl LiCl[5]. This embodiment is particularly preferred since /PrMgCl LiCl is xmmercially available.<br>
6<br><br>
Generally, any Grignard reagent can be used to prepare the mixed Mg/Li-amides in the presence of any lithium salt. It is nevertheless preferred to use a Grignard reagent the side or by-products of which can easily be removed from the reaction mixture. The presence of a lithium salt accelerates the exchange reaction compared to homoleptic reagents RMgX and R2Mg without the use of a lithium salt.<br>
According to a second aspect, the present invention is directed to the mixed Mg/Li amide R'R2N-MgX zLiY (I), wherein R1, R2, X, Y and z are defined as above. This corresponds to an amide according to formula II, wherein m = 0. The second aspect also relates to a mixed Mg/Li bisamide of the general formula R1R2N-Mg(NR3R4)MX1-M zLiY (II), wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X, Y, m and z are defined as above. It is to be understood that the adduct of a solvent is also comprised by any of these formulae.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention is directed to a solution of the amide (I) or (II) in a solvent. The solvent can be any suitable solvent capable of dissolving the amide. Especially preferred solvents are the solvents listed above for the preparation of the amides.<br>
All aspects and features described above in relation to the first aspect shall also apply to the second and third aspect of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the present invention is related to the use of mixed Mg/Li amides (I) and (11). The amides of the present invention can be used to remove acidic protons. The deprotonated species can then subsequently be quenched with an elecrrophile. In principle it is possible to use all kinds of electrophiles that are, for example, cited in the following references, but are not limited thereto:<br>

The final aspect of the invention relates to the product of the reaction of an electrophile with a substrate which has been deprotonated with a reagent of the general formula I or II.<br>
In all aspects relating to the monoamides of the formula I, z is preferably in the range from 0.01 - 5, more preferably from 0.5 - 2, even more preferably from 0.9 to 1.2 and most preferred about 1.

and R2 together, or R3 and R4 together, are a divalent saturated or unsaturated, linear or<br>
branched alknyl, alkenyl or alkynyl which forms in connection with the nitrogen atom of the<br>

Preferred ranges for both are C4-C15, more preferably C4-C10 and includes aryls and fused aryls with or without heteroatoms. A preferred ring size comprises 5 or 6 ring atoms.<br>
Mixed magnesium and lithium amides R]R2NMgCl LiCl (R! and R2 = i-Pr or R!R2N = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl) can be prepared by reacting i-PrMgCI LiCl[4,5] with diisopropylamine or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMPH), respectively, in THF (-20°C -80°C, for 0.1-48 h ). The resulting Li/Mg-reagents 5a (R1 and R2 = /-Pr) and 5b (R1R2N = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl) proved to have an excellent solubility in THF (0.6 M and 1.2 M, respectively) as well as an improved kinetic acidity and regioselectivity for the magnesation of various aromatics and heterocycles.<br>
The activity of the amides (I) can be shown on the basis of the magnesiation of isoquinoline. Diisopropylamido magnesium chloride-lithium chloride 5a leads to the magnesiated isoquinoline 6 after 12 h reaction time at 25°C and by using 2 equivalents of the base. After iodoiysis, the iodoisoquinoline 7a is isolated in 88% yield (Scheme 2). Even more active is the sterically more hindered and less aggregated 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidino magnesium chloride-lithium chloride reagent 5b. It leads to a complete magnesiation within 2 h at 25°C. Remarkably, with this base only 1.1 equivalents are required to achieve a complete metaiation. The resulting Grignard reagent 6 provides after iodoiysis the iodoisoquinoline 7a in 96% yield (Scheme 2 and Table 1).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
N-MgCI LiCl<br><br><br>
Scheme 2. Magnesiation of isoquinoline<br>

After the magnesation of a reagent, it can be subjected to a transmetalation. After e.g. a transmetalation with CuCN 2LiCl (20 mol %), the addition of benzoyl chloride (1.2 equiv.) provides the ketone 7b in 86% yield (entry 2 of Table 1).<br>
The presence of an excess of magnesium amides often hampers the performance of palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings. The inventors found that the Grignard reagents generated by deprotonation with 5b (1.1 equiv.) such as 6 are readily transmetalated to the corresponding zinc derivative (ZnCl2 (1.1 equiv.), 0°C, 5 min.) and undergo a Negishi-cross-coupling reaction using Pd(dba)2 (5 mol%) (dba ~ dibenzylideneacetone), P(2-fur)3 (7 mol%) (fur=furyl) with ethyl 4-iodobenzoate (1.2 equiv.; 50°C, 12 h) leading to the arylated quinoline (7c) in 82% yield. This behaviour is general and 3-bromoquinoline is metalated with 5b (1.1 equiv., -30°C, 0.5 h) leading to the 2-magnesiated quinoline 8 (entries 4 and 5 of Table 1). Thus, the quenching of 8 with h and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) provides the two quinolines 9a and 9b in 96-93% yield.<br>
Whereas the deprotonation of 2,6-dichloropyridine with i-Pr2NMgCl LiCl 5a and lithium diisopropylamide (LDA)t8jI provides a 1:1 mixture of 3- and 4-magnesiated 2,6-dichloro¬pyridine, the use of TMPMgCl LiCl 5b furnishes only the 4-magnesiated pyridine 10. Its reaction with typical electrophiles (b, DMF and PhCHO) provides the expected products 11a-c in 84^-93% yield (entries 6-8 of Table 1). Interestingly, metalation of 3,5-dibromopyridine with LDA proceeds selectively at 4-position[6b] while in the case of (TMPMgCl LiCl 5b 1.1 equiv, r20°C, 0.5h) regioselective metalation of 3,5-dibromopyridine is observed leading after the reaction with DMF to the pyridylaldehyde 13 in 95% yield (entry 9 of Table 1).<br>
The magnesiation of heterocycles bearing more acidic protons17' such as thiazole, thiophene, furan, benzothiophene or benzothiazole proceeds smoothly between 0°C and 25°C leading to the organomagnesium derivatives 14a-c and 16a-b. After trapping with standard electrophiles, the expected products 15a-c and 17a-b are obtained in 81-98% yield (entries 10-14 of Table I).<br>
The metalation of pyrimidine derivatives is a challenging problem due to the propensity of<br>
these heterocycles to add organometallic reagents.[8] ' The inventors found that the inverse<br>
addition of the pyrimidine derivatives 18-20 to a THF solution of 5b (1.05 equiv.) at -55°C<br>
11<br><br>
for approx. 5 min. provides the corresponding magnesiated derivatives 21-23 in 83-90% yields as indicated by iodolysis experiments leading to the iodinated pyrimidines 24-26<br>
(scheme 3).<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 3. Regioselective magnesiation of pyrimidines<br>
The mixed magnesium-lithium amide 5b is also well suited for the regioselective metalation of polyfunctional aromatic systems. Thus, the reaction of 2-phenylpyridine 27 in THF at 55°C with 5b (2.0 equiv.) for 24 h provides the Grignard reagent 28 showing a rare case where a phenyl ring is preferentially metalated compared to a pyridine ring. After iodolysis, the ortho-iodinated product 29 is obtained in 80% yield. Interestingly, the metalation of polyfunctional aromatics such as the bromodiester 30 also succeeds using only the stoichiometric amount of base 5b (1.1 equiv.) in THF (-30°C, 0.5 h) leading regioselectively to the arylmagnesium species 31 which after iodolysis furnishes the polyfunctional aromatic derivative 32 in 88% yield.<br>

A solution of TMPMgCI LiCl can easily be prepared in THF due to its excellent solubility and it is stable for more than 6 months at 25°C. The use of TMPMgCI LiCl allows for the regioselective functionalization of various aromatics and heteroaromatics. It gives access to new magnesium species not readily available via a Br/Mg-exchange reactions or by previously reported metalation procedures.<br>
The residues R1 and R2 are not limited to organic compounds. R1 and R2 may also be silylated compounds like trimethylsilyl. The preparation of the bis(trimethylsilyl) amide 33 can be achieved by reacting bis(trirnethylsilyl)amine with /-PrMgCI LiCl at room temperature (see Scheme 5). This base can efficiently be used to deprotonate ketones like e.g. cyclohexanone as can be seen from Scheme 5.<br><br><br>

The Grignard reagents can also be used to prepare a polymeric base. 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine (TMPH) is a well known base. It can be used to prepare the corresponding mixed Mg/Li amide TMPMgCl LiCl 5b. This monomelic base is very reactive but also very expensive. A corresponding polymeric base to TMPH is chimassorb 994, the structure of which is shown in Scheme 6.<br><br><br><br>
Chimassorb 994<br>
Scheme 6: Structure of chimassorb 994<br>
Chimassorb 994 can be used to prepare the corresponding mixed Mg/Li amide by reacting chimassorb 994 with i-PrMgCl LiCl at room temperature (see Scheme 5). This base 34 is stable and soluble in THF before and after deprotonation. As being a polymeric base, it can be easily removed after completion of the reaction. Since chimassorb 994 is much cheaper than TMP, a corresponding base can be prepared at reduced costs. The polymeric base 34 shows slightly lower activity than monomelic TMPMgCl LiCl but is nevertheless very effective in deprotonating compounds with acidic protons like isoquinoline. A corresponding example is shown in Scheme 7. The polymeric base can be used to deprotonate various substrates. For example, isoquinoline reacts at room temperature with the base 34 affording after quenching with iodine 1-iodoisoquinoline 7a.<br><br><br><br>

The above given examples show that the new mixed Mg/Li-bases of the general type R R NMgX zLiY have a high kinetic activity due to the presence of a lithium salt which breaks oligomeric aggregates of magnesium amides.<br>
An example of a symmetrical bisamide reagent is (TMP)2Mg-2LiCl 40a. It is prepared by reacting in situ generated MgCh with lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (TMPLi) in THF at 0°C for 30 minutes (see Scheme 8).<br><br><br><br><br>

Additionally, other symmetrical bisamides can be prepared in high yields using the same methodology as for the preparation of 40a. All examples shown below (40b-40c) were prepared in &gt;95% yield (Scheme 9) in analogy to the preparation of 40a. This also includes bisamides containing silyl substituted amines.<br><br>
Scheme 9: Further examples of symmetrical bisamides.<br>
Comparative metalation experiments on aromatic substrates were performed under identical<br>
conditions with 1.1 equivalents of both (TMP)2Mg-2LiCl (40a) and TMPMgCl-LiCl (5b). The<br>
bisamide reagent (TMP)2Mg-2LiCI shows highly superior reactivity than TMPMgCl-LiCl and<br>
it was even able to deprotonate very weak acidic substrates.<br>
15<br><br>
Scheme 10 gives an overview over examples of reactions of four different aromatic substances (41-44) with (TMP)2Mg-2LiCl (40a) and TMPMgClLiCl (5b) under identical conditions. The respective yields are indicated for the products of each of the two amides 40a and 5b. This experiment clearly shows the even superior reactivity of the bisamides in view of the monoamides. All reactions are carried out at room temperature (rt) being at 25°C.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Additionally, the resultant Grignard intermediates derived from (TMP)2Mg-2LiCl show good stability and tolerance to various substrates. Furthermore, they react with different eletrophiles providing the corresponding functionalized derivatives in good yields. Examples are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
16<br><br>
It could also be shown that mixed magnesium bases bearing two different amide functions, i.e. R*R2N and R3R4N being different, have improved properties over the corresponding symmetrical reagents bearing two identical amide functions. The unsymmetrical reagents 40e-40i are prepared from TMPMgCl-LiCI, i-Pr2NMgCl-LiCl and (2-ethyl-hexyl)2NMgCl-LiClf9^, respectively, and the corresponding lithium species of \H-benxotriazole (Bt), 5,6-dimethly-1H-benzotriazole, (DMBt) and catbaxote (CBZ,), respectively (Scheme 11).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Scheme 11: Preparation of compound 40e-40i having two different amide functions.<br>
Especially, the base 40e provides a far higher reactivity than TMPMgCI LiCI (5b) and (TMP)2Mg-2LiCl (40a) when using special directing metalation groups (DMG). TMPMgCl-LiCI provides full metalation of 44 in 90 minutes at 0°C, and reagent 40a provides full metalation in 60 minutes. In contrast thereto, the use of 40e provides full metalation at 0°C in only 10 minutes. Furthermore, only 1.3 equivalents of the base 40e are used in contrast<br>
17<br><br>
to 1.5 equivalents of TMPMgClUCl. Moreover, the yield of 45a is higher compared to the useofTMPMgCl-UCl (Scheme 12).<br><br><br>

The regulating intermediates derived from (TMP)Mg(Bt)-2LiCl show good stability and tolerance to various substrates. They can be trapped with an electrophile like iodine to provide the corresponding functionalized derivatives in good yields. Examples are shown in Table 3.<br><br>
As can be seen from the above given examples, the new mixed Mg/Li-bases are very effective in deprotonating organic compounds. The deprotonation can be achieved in different solvents and can preferably be conducted at temperatures between -90°C and 100°C. Further, due to the effective deprotonation reaction, the amides of the present invention preferably only require the use of 0.9-5 equivalents, more preferably 1-2 equivalents and most preferably 1.1-1.5 equivalents per proton to be deprotonated.<br><br>
With this new type of base, which is highly soluble and the side products of which do not disturb the following reactions, many new products may be.obtained, or known reactions<br>

pathways will be more efficient, A person skilled in the art will easily recognise the benefit of the new Mg/Li-base and will be able to use this base in a wide variety of chemical reactions.<br>
