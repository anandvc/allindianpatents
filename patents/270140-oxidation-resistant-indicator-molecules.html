Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to detectable<br>
indicators, including fluorescent indicators, having<br>
increased resistance to oxidation.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Fluorescent molecules are used for a range of<br>
applications including fabric and color brighteners,<br>
signs, various inks for printing, diagnostics as tags and<br>
probes when linked to antibodies or other molecules, and<br>
can be configured at a molecular level to be used as<br>
chemical and biochemical active indicators specifically<br>
designed to detect certain analytes, for example glucose.<br>
The complexation of carbohydrates, including glucose,<br>
with phenylboronic acid has been known for a long time<br>
and the reversibility of that interaction has served as a<br>
basis for the chromatographic separation of sugars.<br><br>
Specifically, in 1959, Lorand and Edwards reported<br>
association constants for aqueous associations of<br>
phenylboronic acid with many saturated polyols; binding<br>
interactions ranged from very weak (e.g., ethylene<br>
glycol, Kd=360 mM) to moderately strong (e.g., glucose,<br>
Kd=9.1 mM). See J. Yoon, et al., Bioorganic and Medicinal<br>
Chemistry 1(4):267-71 (1993). The binding mechanism is<br>
believed to occur through displacement of the hydroxyl<br>
groups on a boronate moiety with adjacent hydroxyl groups<br>
on glucose.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,503,770 (James, et al.) describes a<br>
fluorescent boronic acid-containing compound that emits<br>
fluorescence of a high intensity upon binding to<br>
saccharides, including glucose.. The fluorescent compound<br>
has a molecular structure comprising a fluorophore, at<br>
least one phenylboronic acid moiety and at least one<br>
amine-providing nitrogen atom where the nitrogen atom is<br>
disposed in the vicinity of the phenylboronic acid moiety<br>
so as to interact intramolecularly with the boronic acid.<br>
Such interaction thereby causes the compound to emit<br>
fluorescence upon saccharide binding. See also T. James,<br>
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117(35):8982-87 (1995).<br>
Additionally, fluorescent sensors using an<br>
anthrylboronic acid-containing compound for detecting<br>
blood glucose are known in the art. For example, J.<br>
Yoon, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:5874-5875 (1992)<br>
describe that anthrylboronic acid can be used as a<br>
fluorescent chemosensor for signaling carbohydrate<br>
binding, including binding of glucose and fructose.<br>
Fluorescent molecules are susceptible to degradation,<br>
where they lose fluorescence intensity (or brightness)<br>
over time by often variable rates of oxidation. The<br>
oxidation may be commonly associated with photobleaching,<br>
which is technically "photo-oxidation", or may be<br><br>
oxidized by various reactive oxygen species within the<br>
local environment of the fluorescent molecule. Any<br>
number of potential oxidants exist in the environment and<br>
atmosphere such as ozone, or may exist inside a living<br>
body ranging from humans to bacteria. Inside a living<br>
body, normal reactive oxygen species (ROS) can include<br>
those involved in typical healthy healing reactions such<br>
as peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite,<br>
superoxide, and others. Inside a living system there are<br>
also specific enzymes called oxygenases for the specific<br>
purpose of oxidation in the breakdown of molecules. An<br>
adverse result of reactive oxygen species or oxygenase<br>
activity on a fluorescent molecule is typically loss of<br>
fluorescence. In the case of an indicator molecule, or a<br>
passive tag, probe, or label, the useful life and<br>
sensitivity of the device, or diagnostic, is limited, or<br>
may be rendered completely ineffective by oxidative<br>
degradation of fluorescent signal. Therefore, there<br>
remains a need for fluorescent molecules that have<br>
increased resistance to oxidation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the inventors' ongoing work to develop an<br>
implantable glucose sensor based on a fluorescent<br>
indicator molecule, an observation was made that in<br>
addition to photo-oxidation, which is a direct and<br>
predictable function of quantitative light cumulative<br>
exposure, that for a series of fluorescent indicator<br>
molecules tested in vivo, there is an additional, severe,<br><br>
and rapid fluorescent signal loss that occurs in vivo,<br>
but does not occur significantly in vitro.<br>
Samples of a fluorescent indicator were implanted,<br>
and subsequently explanted some period of weeks later.<br>
The samples were then chemically analyzed following<br>
severe loss of signal. The analysis showed a specific<br>
reaction whereby the boronate recognition element of the<br>
indicator system had been specifically oxidized to a<br>
hydroxyl group, thereby causing total loss of activity<br>
(specifically, fluorescence modulation) in the molecule.<br>
This in vivo oxidation reaction is shown below:<br><br>
The destructive in vivo oxidation reaction was shown<br>
to be very specific, oxidizing only the boronate group,<br>
and leaving a hydroxyl group in its place. The oxidation<br>
was duplicated in-vitro by treatment with 1, 5, and 10 uM<br>
hydrogen peroxide. Both in vitro and in vivo, only the<br>
boronate moiety was found to be oxidized to hydroxyl.<br>
This was unexpected since ROS were thought (by us) to be<br>
more generalized and indiscriminate in where they may<br>
oxidize and damage the molecule.<br><br>
According to the present invention, indicator<br>
molecules containing an aryl boronic acid residue may be<br>
made more resistant to oxidation by adding one or more<br>
electron-withdrawing groups to the aromatic moiety which<br>
contains the boronic acid residue, thus stabilizing the<br>
boronate moiety. It will be understood that the term<br>
"aryl" encompasses a wide range of aromatic groups, such<br>
as phenyl, polynuclear aromatics, heteroaromatics,<br>
polynuclear heteroaromatics, etc. Non-limiting examples<br>
include phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, pyridyl, etc.<br>
A wide range of electron-withdrawing groups is<br>
within the scope of the invention, and includes, but is<br>
not limited to, halogen, cyano, nitro, halo substituted<br>
alkyl, carboxylic acid, ester, sulfonic acid, ketone,<br>
aldehyde, sulfonamide, sulfone, sulfonyl, sulfoxide,<br>
halo-substituted sulfone, halo-substituted alkoxy, halo-<br>
substituted ketone, amide, etc., or combinations thereof.<br>
With respect to structures I and II above, Ri and R2<br>
preferably are electron-withdrawing groups as described<br>
in the preceding paragraph. Most preferably, each of R1<br>
and R2 is triflouromethyl. Further, as noted above, in<br>
certain embodiments at least one of the R groups will<br>
contain a polymerizable monomer unit which will allow<br>
incorporation of structure (I) into a polymer. Such<br>
polymerizable units are well known, and include, but are<br>
not limited to vinyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide,<br>
methacrylamide, etc.<br>
The indicator compounds of the present invention have<br>
a detectable quality (shown as constituent R4 in structure<br>
I) that changes in a concentration-dependent manner when<br>
the compound is exposed to a sample containing glucose.<br>
Many such qualities are known and may be used in the<br>
present invention. For example, the indicator compound<br>
may include a luminescent (fluorescent or phosphorescent)<br>
or chemiluminescent moiety, an absorbance based moiety,<br><br>
etc. The indicator compound may include an energy donor<br>
moiety and an energy acceptor moiety, each spaced such<br>
that there is a detectable change when the indicator<br>
compound interacts with glucose. The indicator compound<br>
may include a fluorophore and a quencher, configured such<br>
that the fluorophore is quenched by the quencher when<br>
glucose is absent. In that situation, when glucose is<br>
present, the indicator undergoes a configurational change<br>
which causes the quencher to move sufficiently distant<br>
from the fluorophore so that fluorescence is emitted.<br>
Conversely, the fluorophore and quencher may be<br>
configured such that in the absence of glucose, they are<br>
sufficiently separated and the fluorophore emits<br>
fluorescence; upon interaction with glucose, the<br>
fluorophore and quencher are moved in sufficient<br>
proximity to cause quenching. The configurational change<br>
concept is described in more detail in U.S. published<br>
application 2002/0119581, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In another embodiment, the quencher contains<br>
an aromatic boronic acid, and binding of the boronic acid<br>
to the target molecule (e.g., glucose) changes the<br>
quencher efficiency resulting in a detectable change.<br>
Such is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication<br>
2006/0083688, the content of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the indicator may include a moiety<br>
such as a fluorophore capable of interacting with the<br>
recognition element or another moiety spatially disposed<br>
with respect to the recognition element such that in the<br>
absence of glucose, the fluorophore emits fluorescence.<br>
Upon addition of glucose, the glucose competes with the<br>
interaction between the fluorophore and the recognition<br>
element, or the interaction between the fluorophore and<br>
the other moiety spatially disposed with respect to the<br>
recognition element, causing a reduction in fluorescence.<br><br>
It will also be recognized that the indicator may be<br>
chosen such that the fluorophore emits no fluorescence,<br>
or a relatively low level of fluorescence, when the<br>
fluorophore interacts with the recognition element or<br>
another moiety spatially disposed with respect to the<br>
recognition element in the absence of glucose. Upon<br>
addition of glucose, the glucose competes with the<br>
interaction between the fluorophore and the recognition<br>
element, or the interaction between the fluorophore and<br>
the other moiety spatially disposed with respect to the<br>
recognition element, causing an increase in fluorescence.<br>
Other detectable moieties include those whose<br>
fluorescence is affected by glucose interaction via<br>
photoinduced electron transfer or inductive effects.<br>
These include the lanthanide chelates disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 6,344,360, incorporated herein by reference;<br>
polyaromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives;<br>
coumarins; BoDiPy; dansyl; catechols; etc. Another class<br>
of moieties include those whose absorbance spectrum<br>
changes upon interaction of the indicator compound with<br>
glucose, including Alizarin Red, etc. Another class of<br>
moieties include those whose fluorescence is modulated by<br>
proximity effects, e.g., energy donor/acceptor pairs such<br>
as dansyl/dabsyl, etc.<br>
Preferably, the detectable quality is a detectable<br>
spectral change, such as changes in absorptive<br>
characteristics (e.g., absorbtivity and/or spectral<br>
shift), in fluorescent decay time (determined by time<br>
domain or frequency domain measurement), fluorescent<br>
intensity, fluorescent anisotropy or polarization; a<br>
spectral shift of the emission spectrum; a change in<br>
time-resolved anisotropy decay (determined by time domain<br>
or frequency domain measurement), etc.<br>
It will be understood that until use, the boronic<br>
acid recognition elements may be capped with a protecting<br><br>
group. Such groups are well known, and include neopentyl<br>
glycol, pinacol, etc. In certain embodiments, the capped<br>
recognition element is decapped in the medium in which<br>
the compound is to be used.<br>
The present invention also encompasses compounds with<br>
improved resistance to oxidation that do not necessarily<br>
contain a detectable group. Such compounds can be used<br>
in, for example, chromatography resins used to separate<br>
sugars. In that instance, the present compounds would be<br>
linked to a resin or other solid support via a linker<br>
that is capable of withstanding the conditions to which<br>
the resin or support is subjected.<br>
The indicator compounds of the present invention, if<br>
soluble, may be used directly in solution if so desired.<br>
On the other hand, if the desired application so<br>
requires, the indicator compounds may be immobilized<br>
(such as by mechanical entrapment or covalent or ionic<br>
attachment) onto or within an insoluble surface or matrix<br>
such as glass, plastic, polymeric materials, etc. When<br>
the indicator compound is entrapped within, for example,<br>
another polymer, the entrapping material preferably<br>
should be sufficiently permeable to glucose to allow<br>
suitable interaction between glucose and the indicator<br>
compound.<br>
If the indicator compounds are sparingly soluble or<br>
insoluble in water, yet detection in an aqueous medium is<br>
desired, the indicator compound may be co-polymerized<br>
with a hydrophilic monomer to form a hydrophilic<br>
macromolecule as described in, for example, U.S. Patent<br>
6,794,195, the contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Suitable linking groups to a polymer or support may<br>
include groups from about 1 to about 20 contiguous atoms,<br>
which may be branched or substituted and which may<br>
include one or more heteroatoms, which terminate in a<br><br>
functional group capable of further reaction or<br>
attachment to a polymer or support. Examples of suitable<br>
linking groups include alkyl; aryl; acyl; polyamide;<br>
polyether; all optionally substituted, and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
It will also be understood from the above definition<br>
that the present compounds and detection systems may be<br>
in polymeric form. Thus, an integral compound<br>
(containing recognition elements and detectable moiety)<br>
could be linked to an existing polymer, or the integral<br>
compound in monomeric form could be polymerized or co-<br>
polymerized with another suitable monomer to form a<br>
polymer. Alternatively, two separate monomeric<br>
components (e.g., one containing the recognition<br>
elements, and one containing a detectable moiety) could<br>
be copolymerized so that the resulting polymer contains<br>
all necessary elements of the system.<br>
Many uses exist for the indicator compounds of the<br>
present invention, including uses as indicators in the<br>
fields of energy, medicine and agriculture. For example,<br>
the indicator compounds can be used to detect sub-levels<br>
or supra-levels of glucose in physiological buffers or<br>
fluids, such as blood, plasma, serum, interstitial fluid,<br>
cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, intraocular fluid,<br>
lymph, tears, or sweat, thus providing valuable<br>
information for diagnosing or monitoring such diseases as<br>
diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.<br>
Medical/pharmaceutical production of glucose for<br>
human therapeutic application requires monitoring and<br>
control.<br>
Uses for the present invention in agriculture include<br>
detecting levels of glucose in soybeans and other<br>
agricultural products. Glucose must be carefully<br>
monitored in critical harvest decisions for such high<br>
value products as wine grapes. As glucose is the most<br><br>
expensive carbon source and feedstock in fermentation<br>
processes, glucose monitoring for optimum reactor feed<br>
rate control is important in power alcohol production.<br>
Reactor mixing and control of glucose concentration also<br>
is critical to quality control during production of soft<br>
drinks and fermented beverages, which consumes the<br>
largest amounts of glucose and fermentable (vicinal diol)<br>
sugars internationally.<br>
When the indicator compounds incorporate fluorescent<br>
indicator substituents, various detection techniques also<br>
are known in the art. For example, the compounds of the<br>
invention can be used in fluorescent sensing devices<br>
(e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,517,313) or can be bound to<br>
polymeric material such as test paper for visual<br>
inspection. This latter technique would permit, for<br>
example, glucose measurement in a manner analogous to<br>
determining pH with a strip of litmus paper. The<br>
compounds described herein may also be utilized as simple<br>
reagents with standard benchtop analytical<br>
instrumentation such as spectrofluorometers or clinical<br>
analyzers as made by Shimadzu, Hitachi, Jasco, Beckman<br>
and others. These molecules would also provide analyte<br>
specific chemical/optical signal transduction for fiber<br>
optic-based sensors and analytical fluorometers as made<br>
by Ocean Optics (Dunedin, Florida), or Oriel Optics.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, describes a<br>
fluorescence sensing device in which the compounds of the<br>
present invention can be used to determine the presence<br>
or concentration of glucose in a liquid medium. The<br>
sensing device comprises a layered array of a fluorescent<br>
indicator molecule-containing matrix (hereafter<br>
"fluorescent matrix"), a high-pass filter and a<br>
photodetector. In this device, a light source,<br>
preferably a light-emitting diode ("LED"), is located at<br><br>
least partially within the indicator material, or in a<br>
waveguide upon which the indicator matrix is disposed,<br>
such that incident light from the light source causes the<br>
indicator molecules to fluoresce. The high-pass filter<br>
allows emitted light to reach the photodetector, while<br>
filtering out scattered incident light from the light<br>
source. The fluorescence of the indicator molecules<br>
employed in the device described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313<br>
is modulated, e.g., attenuated or enhanced, by the local<br>
presence of glucose.<br>
In the sensor described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the<br>
material which contains the indicator molecule is<br>
permeable to the analyte. Thus, the analyte can diffuse<br>
into the material from the surrounding test medium,<br>
thereby affecting the fluorescence emitted by the<br>
indicator compounds. The light source, indicator<br>
compound-containing material, high-pass filter and<br>
photodetector are configured such that at least a portion<br>
of the fluorescence emitted by the indicator compounds<br>
impacts the photodetector, generating an electrical<br>
signal which is indicative of the concentration of<br>
glucose in the surrounding medium.<br>
In accordance with other possible embodiments for<br>
using the indicator compounds of the present invention,<br>
sensing devices also are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,910,661, 5,917,605 and 5,894,351, all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be<br>
used in an implantable device, for example to<br>
continuously monitor blood glucose levels in vivo.<br>
Suitable devices are described in, for example, co-<br>
pending U.S. Patent Nos. 6,330,464, 5,833,603, 6,002,954<br>
and 6,011,984, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds include the<br>
compounds depicted in Figures 5A and B (the compounds<br><br>
designated "Unsubstituted" and "2-Methyl" do not contain<br>
an electron withdrawing group, but are presented for<br>
illustrative purposes). The compounds are depicted in<br>
the carboxylic acid form and with the boronic acid group<br>
being unprotected. However, it will be understood that,<br>
for example, compounds having the carboxylic acid salt<br>
form and/or capped boronic acid groups are within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by persons skilled in the art without an undue<br>
amount of experimentation using readily known reaction<br>
mechanisms and reagents, for example including reaction<br>
mechanisms which are consistent with the general<br>
procedures described below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The starting compound 2 c in Scheme 1 may be prepared<br>
according to the following general synthetic routes:<br><br><br><br>
It will be understood that while the syntheses shown<br>
just above may be used to synthesize compound 2c of<br>
Scheme 1, one of ordinary skill would readily understand<br>
how to make compounds 2a-2b and 2d-2i as well, all of<br>
which are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The modulation of the fluorescence of various<br>
molecules (depicted in Figure 5) by varying<br>
concentrations of glucose was determined. The results<br>
are set forth in Figure 1, and show that most of the<br>
molecules tested modulated well. Two of the molecules<br>
(the 4-nitro and 2-methyl substituted compounds) did not<br>
modulate well, but still are useful as oxidation-<br>
resistant tags. In a further experiment, the<br>
unsubstituted control and two compounds of the present<br>
invention (4-trifluoromethyl and 3,4-diflouro) were<br>
subjected to oxidation treatment with 1 mM hydrogen<br>
peroxide, and the loss of fluorescence intensity was<br>
measured. Those data are shown in Figure 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Several gels (produced as in Example 3) containing<br>
compounds of the present invention (4-trifluoromethyl,<br>
3,4-diflouro and 4-fluoro) and a control (unsubstituted)<br>
were subjected to long term exposure to 10 uM hydrogen<br>
peroxide and 4 mM glucose/PBS at 37°C, and the loss of<br>
fluorescence intensity was measured. Those data are<br>
shown in Figure 2. In addition, the measured in vitro<br>
half life data for three of the compounds are set forth<br>
in Table 1 below.<br>
The data in the table show that, as compared with<br>
the standard unsubstituted monomer, the 3,4-difluoro and<br>
the 4-trifluoromethyl analogs have approximately 33 and<br><br>
26 times longer half life, respectively, in the presence<br>
of l0μM hydrogen peroxide. For comparison, literature<br>
reports that typical physiological hydrogen peroxide<br>
levels are approximately 0.5μM maximμM. Also notable<br>
from the table are the differences in average<br>
fluorescence intensity. Both analogs show lower overall<br>
modulation, but substantially greater fluorescence (are<br>
brighter) and thus provide a stronger signal, raising the<br>
signal to noise ratio and therefore greater resolution in<br>
a sensor product as a side benefit. The lower Kd measured<br>
for the 4-trifluoromethyl indicator is superior to the<br>
standard control for the purpose of hμMan glucose<br>
sensing, because it has greater sensitivity to glucose in<br>
the physiological range.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Two compounds according to the present invention (4-<br>
trifluoromethyl and 3,4-diflouro) and the unsubstituted<br>
control were each copolymerized with hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate (HEMA)and acrylic acid, and crosslinked with<br>
ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) to form a water<br>
insoluble polymer graft, which was then implanted into a<br>
rat to be subjected to in vivo oxidation for 22 or 43<br>
days. Upon explant, the fluorescence of each compound was<br>
measured, and the data are shown in Figure 4. The<br><br>
compounds of the present invention retained greater<br>
fluorescence compared to the control.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Several compounds of the present invention were each<br>
copolymerized with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA),<br>
acrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA)<br>
to form water insoluble polymer gels, as in Example 3.<br>
Their stability towards oxidant was assessed by<br>
subjecting the gels to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide in PBS at<br>
37°C. Those data are shown in Figure 6. In a further<br>
experiment, two of the indicator gels (the 4-<br>
trifluoromethyl and 4-trifluoromethylsulfone gels) were<br>
subjected to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 4<br>
mM glucose in PBS at 37°C. Those data are shown in<br>
Figure 7. Half-lives calculated from the two<br>
aforementioned stability experiments are set forth in<br>
Table 2. In a further experiment, the fluorescent change<br>
(% modulation) from 0 to 20 mM glucose of various<br>
indicator gels was measured and the results are shown in<br>
Figure 8.<br><br><br><br><br>

added and washed with phosphate buffer (100 mL of 0.1 M,<br>
pH 7.0). The aqueous solution was backwashed with ether<br><br>
(2 x 100 mL) and the combined ether solutions were dried<br>
over Na2SO4. The ether was removed under vacuμM and the<br>
resulting yellow powder triturated with hexanes (100 mL)<br>
for 15 minutes. Trituration of the crude product (2.60 g)<br>
with boiling 80/20 ethyl acetate/IPA yielded an off-white<br>
powder of ~ 98% purity by HPLC. Crude samples were<br>
combined and recrystaliized by suspending in boiling<br>
80/20 ethyl acetate/IPA and adding ethyl acetate until<br>
all solid dissolved. Upon cooling, pure product<br>
crystallized as an off-white powder (1.54 g, 32% yield).<br>
