				<td>[Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a benzimidazole compound or a salt thereof, or a solvate of these, useful as a gastric acid secretion inhibitor.<br>
The present invention also relates to a benzimidazole compound or- a salt thereof, or a solvate of these, useful as a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent for acid-related diseases or symptoms (especially gastroesophageal reflux diseases, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux diseases, gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers).<br>
[Background Art] [0002]<br>
Peptic ulcers such as gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer are conceivably caused by the disruption of the balance between aggressive factors, such as acid and pepsin, and defensive factors, such as the mucus and blood flow, leading to autodigestion.<br>
[0003]<br>
The peptic ulcer is principally treated by medical care, so that various drug therapies have been tried as the medical care.  Particularly, in recent<br>
years, a medicament capable of specifically inhibiting H+/K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme present in the parietal cells and responsible for the final stage of gastric acid secretion, thereby suppressing gastric acid secretion and inhibiting autodigestion, has been developed and put to clinical use.  Examples of such a medicament include omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, and rabeprazole. [0004]<br>
These medicaments have excellent therapeutic effects; however, a medicament that more persistently inhibits gastric acid secretion, is safer, and is appropriately physicochemically stable has been still desired to be developed.  In particular, it is also suggested that the cure rate of gastroesophageal reflux disease may be improved by maintaining the intragastric pH at a high value for a long time (Non-Patent Document<br>
 [0005]<br>
Compounds particularly relevant to the present invention are described in Patent Documents 1 and 2.  However, the compounds disclosed in these patent documents differ in chemical structure from the compounds specifically described in the present invention. [0006]<br>

[0056]<br>
In each of the methods, after completion of the reaction in each step, a target compound can be obtained from a reaction mixture in accordance with a conventional method.<br>
For example, in the case where a whole reaction mixture is a solution, a target compound is obtained by returning the temperature of the reaction mixture if needed to room temperature or cooling the reaction mixture on ice, neutralizing an acid, alkali, oxidizing agent, or reducing agent, and adding water and an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate nonmiscible to water and non-reactive with a target<br>
compound, thereby separating a layer containing the target compound, and thereafter, adding a solvent nonmiscible to the obtained layer and non-reactive to the target compound, washing the layer containing the target compound, and separating the layer.  In addition, if the obtained layer is an organic layer, the desired compound can be obtained by drying the organic layer by use of a dehydration agent such as potassium carbonate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or anhydrous sodium sulfate and distilling away a solvent. On the other hand, if the obtained layer is an water layer, the desired compound can be obtained by subjecting the layer to electrically desalting and freeze dry steps.<br>
Alternatively, when the whole reaction mixture is a solution, and if possible, a target compound can be obtained by distilling away other compounds (e.g., solvent, reagent) under normal pressure or reduced pressure.<br>
Furthermore, when only a target compound is precipitated as solid or the whole reaction mixture is a liquid and only a target compound is precipitated in the course of the recovering process, the target compound can be obtained by a filtration, washing the filtered target compound with an appropriate solvent, and drying.  Further, the target compound can be obtained from the filtrate in the same manner as the case where the whole reaction mixture is a solution,<br>
additionally.<br>
Moreover, when a reagent(s) or a catalyst alone is present as solid into the reaction mixture, or in the case where the whole reaction mixture is a solution, besides a reagent(s) or a catalyst alone is precipitated as solid in the course of the recovering process and the target compound is dissolved in the solvent, the target compound can be obtained by filtering off the reagent(s) or catalyst, washing the filtered reagent(s) or catalyst with an adequate organic or inorganic solvent, combining the washing liquid and the filtrate, treating the mixture in the same manner as in case where the whole reaction mixture is a solution.<br>
In particular, in the case where other compounds besides a target compound contained in the reaction mixture do not inhibit the reaction of the next step, the mixture can be directly used in the next step without isolating the target compound.<br>
To improve the purity of the target compound obtained in the aforementioned step, a recrystallization method, various chromatographic methods and a distillation method may be appropriately applied.<br>
When the obtained target compound is a solid, the purity of the target compound is generally improved by the recrystallization method.  In the recrystallization method, a single solvent or a solvent<br>
mixture of a plurality of solvents non-reactive to the target compound may be used.  More specifically, a target compound can be recrystallized by first dissolving a target compound in a single solvent or a solvent mixture of a plurality of solvents at room temperature or with heating, and then, cooling the resultant solution by ice water, etc, stirring it or standing it alone at room temperature, or adding a solvent in which the target dissolves at a low solubility, thereby recovering a crystallized target compound from the solution.<br>
The purity of a target compound can be improved by various chromatographic methods. Generally, use may be made of silica gel column chromatography using weak acidic silica gels such as silica gel 60 (70 to 230 meshes or 340 to 400 meshes) manufactured by Merck Ltd., BW-300 (300 meshes) manufactured by Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd., or a disposable silica gel column cartridge for middle pressure liquid chromatography (High Frash column), manufactured by Yamazen Corporation.  When a target compound is basic and excessively adsorbed by the silica gels mentioned above, use may be made of propyl amine coating silica gel (200 to 350 meshes) manufactured by Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd., or NH silica gel as used in disposable silica gel column cartridge for middle pressure liquid chromatography, (High Frash, Amino) manufactured by Yamazen<br>
Corporation.  Alternatively, when a target compound has bipolarity or must be eluted by a high polar solvent such as methanol, NAM-200H or NAM-300H (manufactured by NAM Laboratory) may be used.  When a target compound is eluted by using any one of these silica gels and a single solvent or a solvent mixture of a plurality of solvents non-reactive with the target compound, and the solvent is removed, the target compound improved in purity can be obtained.<br>

(Experimental Example 1) Inhibitory effect of gastric acid secretion in a dog having a chronic gastric fistula<br>
(1) Method<br>
Compounds according to the Examples were investigated for an inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion and persistency of the effect against gastric acid secretion by use of large dogs (body weight: about 14 to 19 kg) having a chronic gastric fistula.  An experiment was performed for 2 days.  On the first day, histamine (50 or 75 µg/kg/h) was intravenously administered continuously for 3 hours. During the histamine administration, the gastric juice was collected every 20 minutes.  One hour after initiation of histamine administration, a test compound (which is a compound prepared in Examples) suspended or dissolved in a 0.5% methylcellulose solution was administered at a volume of 0.1 ml/kg though an indwelling catheter in the duodenum.  The inhibitory effect of the test compound against gastric acid secretion was checked during the 2 hours after administration.  On the second day (that is, 24 hours after the administration of the test compound),<br>
histamine was intravenously administered continuously for 2 hours.  During the histamine administration, the gastric juice was collected every 20 minutes and checked for persistency of the inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion.  After the amount of the gastric juice was measured, a sample of 0.5 ml of the gastric juice was titrated to pH 7.0 with a 0.04 mol/1 sodium hydroxide solution.  In this manner, the acid concentration of the gastric juice was measured. The gastric acid output (secretion amount) was calculated by multiplying the volume of gastric juice by acid concentration.  The inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion was evaluated based on the inhibitory rate (%) of gastric acid secretion on the first day.  The inhibitory effect (%) against gastric acid secretion was obtained in accordance with the following equation.  When the number of animals was 2 or more, an average value was obtained.<br>
The inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion (%)=(A-B)/A x 100<br>
[A]:  The gastric acid output (secretion amount) for 20 minutes from 40 minutes after initiation of histamine administration to one hour later.<br>
[B]:  The gastric acid output for 20 minutes from one hour and 40 minutes after the administration of the test compound to two hours later.<br>
The persistency of the inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion was evaluated based on<br>
the inhibitory rate (%) against gastric acid secretion on the second day.  The persistency (%) of inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion was obtained in accordance with the following equation:<br>
The persistency (%) of the inhibitory effect against gastric acid secretion=(C-D)/C x 100.<br>
[C]: The total amount of gastric acid output from the initiation of administration of histamine (on the first day to one hour later).<br>
[D] : The total amount of gastric acid output from the initiation of administration of histamine (on the second day to one hour later). (2) Results [0837] [Table 1} (Table  Removed)<br><br>
