				<td>ANTI-CARIES ORAL CARE COMPOSITION WITH XYLITOL<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to oral care compositions, particularly compositions for caries prevention.<br>
[0002] Dental caries are caused by the production of acid by certain bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans (hereinafter S. mutans). S. mutans produces sticky, adhesive glucans and fructans from fermentable sugars, particularly sucrose, which promote the adhesion of bacteria to the oral surfaces. The S. mutans may be contained in a dental plaque - the soft material formed of a complex mass of bacteria in a polysaccharide matrix which surrounds the teeth. A cariogenic plaque containing a high proportion of S. mutans can often contain 2x108 bacteria per mg wet weight and can rapidly convert fermentable sugars (sucrose, glucose, or fructose, for example) to generate enough acid to lower the pH of the plaque to 5.5 or lower.<br>
[0003] Demoralization of enamel occurs in an oral environment having a low pH because the natural equilibrium between hydroxyapatite being dissolved from the enamel of teeth and hydroxyapatite being formed on or in the teeth from substances occurring naturally in the saliva is disrupted. While saliva can reduce the acidity of the oral environment and provide a continuing source of calcium and phosphate to the tooth enamel, which tends to remineralize the enamel and inhibit or reverse the carious process, once the acid attack causes sufficient progression of the demineralization, a full-fledged carious lesion develops. For further discussion,<br>
see U.S. Patent No. 6,136,298, Gaffar, et al., issued October 24, 2000; U.S. Patent No. 5,378,131 Greenberg, issued Januarys, 1995; and U.S. Patent No. 5,089,255, Gaffar, et al. issued February 18,1992.<br>
[0004] Current methods of preventing dental caries include fluoride treatments and other anti-cariogenic oral care compositions used as part of a personal or a professional oral care regimen. Other methods include inhibiting acid production by disrupting metabolism of the S. mutans to kill the cells. Nonetheless, caries are still a prevalent dental problem.<br>
[0005] Thus, there is an ongoing need to provide anti-cariogenic oral care compositions. It would be desirable to provide an oral care composition that prevents cariogenic conditions and remineralizes demineralized enamel.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] The present invention relates to oral care compositions comprising xylitol and a water-soluble calcium salt, where the xylitol and the calcium salt are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1.<br>
[0007] The present invention also provides methods of preventing or treating dental caries comprising administering a safe and effective amount of an oral care composition to the oral cavity of a subject, the composition comprising xylitol and a water-soluble calcium salt, where the xylitol and the calcium salt are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1.<br>
[0008] The present invention also provides oral care compositions comprising xylitol, calcium glycerophosphate and fluoride providing agents in anti-<br>
cariogenic amounts, where the xylitol and calcium glycerophosphate are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1.<br>
[0009] It has been discovered that the compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over anti-caries compositions known in the art. Such advantages include providing an oral care composition highly effective to remineralize demineralized dental surfaces. Further uses, benefits, and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.<br>

COMPOSITIONS<br>
[0018] The present invention provides oral care compositions and methods for administration or application to, or use with, a human or other animal subject. As referred to herein, an "oral care composition" is any composition that is suitable for administration or application to the oral cavity a human or animal subject<br>
for enhancing the health, hygiene or appearance of the subject, preferably providing such benefits as: the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of the teeth, gums, mucosa or other hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity; the prevention or treatment of a systemic condition or disorder; the provision of sensory, decorative, or cosmetic benefits; and combinations thereof. In various preferred embodiments, an oral care composition is not intentionally swallowed, but is rather retained in the oral cavity for a time sufficient to effect the intended utility. Preferably, specific materials and compositions to be used in this invention are, accordingly, pharmaceutically-acceptable. As used herein, "safe and effective amount" or a "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "cosmetically acceptable" component refers to a composition that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals to provide the desired therapeutic, prophylactic, sensory, decorative, or cosmetic benefit without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention.<br>
[0019] The present invention provides oral care compositions comprising xylitol and a water-soluble calcium salt which help remineralize demineralized tooth enamel and prevent the development of dental caries.<br>
Xvlitol<br>
[0020] Xylitol is a non-cariogenic carbohydrate and has a variety of uses including, but not limited to, a non-cariogenic sweetener, a humectant, and an anti-caries agent. While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, xylitol appears to cause a disturbance in the metabolism of fermentable carbohydrates by<br>
S. mutans and thereby decreases plaque formation and reduces plaque adhesion to the pellicle. Also, upon metabolizing xylitol, the toxic metabolite xylitol-5-phosphate forms within the S. mutans cells which may interfere with glycolysis energy production and may also involve an energy-consuming futile cycle. The energy consuming cycle kills the S. mutans which results in reduced caries. Xylitol may be present in the composition as an anti-caries agent at about 5% to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 8% to about 15% by weight.<br>
Water-Soluble Calcium Salt<br>
[0021] Water-soluble calcium salts include calcium chloride, calcium acetate, calcium butyrate, calcium citrate, calcium lactate, calcium salicylate, and calcium glycerophosphate. Preferably, the salt is readily dissolvable and stays dissolved in water. A preferred calcium salt is calcium glycerophosphate (CGP). While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, CGP is believed to reduce demineralization and/or increase remineralization of tooth enamel. At low pHs caused by a high concentration of S. mutans in the plaque, the addition of calcium and phosphate ions provides a buffer that shifts the hydroxyapatite equilibrium towards remineralization. Further benefits of CGP include the ability to initiate remineralization at pH levels as low as 5 and the ability to bind directly to the enamel surface.<br>
[0022] CGP is also known as calcium glycerol phosphate, 1-(dihydrogen phosphate)-1,2-3-propanetriol, calcium salt, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate)-1,2,3-propanetriol, calcium salt (1:1), 1,2,3-propanetriol, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate),<br>
calcium salt (1:1), and 1,2,3-propanetriol, mono(dihydrogen phosphate), calcium salt (1:1). CGP may exist as a hydrate, including the monohydrate and the dihydrate. CGP also has the forms α-calcium glycerophosphate or ß-calcium glycerophosphate. The α-calcium glycerophosphate, ß-calcium glycerophosphate, and mixtures thereof may be employed in embodiments of the invention. An α-and ß-CGP mixture may have any α-CGP:ß-CGP ratio, for example, 80 parts α-CGP to 20 parts ß-CGP. CGP may be purchased from NutriScience Innovations, LLC (Fairfield, CT, United States) as calcium glycerophosphate NF-X. In various embodiments, it may be desirable to combine CGP and one or more additional calcium salts having solubility properties different from that of CGP. The different solubilities may provide greater control in the amount and ratios of calcium and/or phosphate ions released in the composition as explained in U.S. Patent No. 6,447,754, Kligerman, et al., issued September 10, 2002.<br>
[0023] The water-soluble calcium slat contains at least about 19% by weight calcium ions. Generally, the water-soluble calcium salt releases from about 100 to about 1,000 ppm of calcium ions into the oral care composition, preferably from about 200 to about 500 ppm. The water-soluble calcium salt is present in the composition at about 0.01% to about 1% by weight, preferably from about 0.08% to about 0.3% by weight.<br>
[0024] The xylitol and the water-soluble calcium salts are present in the composition in a ratio of at least about 10:1 by weight or a molar ratio of at least about 12:1, respectively. In various embodiments, the xylitol and the water-soluble calcium salts may are present at up to about 200:1 by weight or a molar ratio of up<br>
to about 240:1, respectively. Preferred ranges of xylitol to water-soluble calcium salt weight ratios include from about 10:1 to about 200:1, preferably from about 25:1 to about 100:1, and more preferably from about 65:1 to about 80:1, respectively.<br>
[0025] The composition may further comprise a fluoride-providing agent or a fluoride-ion source. The fluoride-providing agents are well known as anti-caries agents. The fluoride-providing agents are sufficiently water soluble to release an anti-carious amount of fluoride ions in water or the saliva. Suitable fluoride-providing agents are organic or inorganic.<br>
[0026] Inorganic fluoride ion-providing agents include metal, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of fluoride, such as for example potassium fluoride, sodium fluoride, ammonium bifluoride, calcium fluoride, a copper fluoride such as cuprous fluoride, barium fluoride, sodium fluorosilicate, ammonium fluorosilicate, sodium fluorozirconate, sodium monofluorophosphate, aluminum mono- and di-fluorophosphate, fluorinated sodium calcium pyrophosphate, stannous fluoride, lithium fluoride, cesium fluoride, aluminum fluoride, cupric fluoride, indium fluoride, stannous fluorozirconate, ferric fluoride, nickel fluoride, palladium fluoride, silver fluoride, zirconium fluoride, and mixtures thereof. Preferred inorganic fluoride ion-providing agents are sodium monofluorophosphate and sodium fluoride.<br>
[0027]     Organic fluoride ion-providing agents include hexylamine hydrofluoride, laurylamine hydrofluoride, myristylamine hydrofluoride, decanolamine hydrofluoride, octadecenylamine hydrofluoride, myristoxyamine hydrofluoride, diethylaminoethyloctoylamide hydrofluoride, diethanolamineoethyloleylamide hydrofluoride, diethanolaminopropyl-N'-octadecenylamine dihydrofluoride, 1-ethanol-<br>
2-hexadecylimidazoline dihydrofluoride, octoylethanolamine hydrofluoride, octyltrimethylammonium fluoride, dodecylethyldimethylammonium fluoride, tetraethylammonium fluoride, dilauryldimethylammonium fluoride, 68-9 octadecenylbenzyldimethylammonium fluoride, dioctyldiethylammonium fluoride, cyclohexylcetyldimethylammonium fluoride, furfuryllauryldimethylammonium fluoride, phenoxyethylcetyldimethylammonium fluoride, N:N'-tetramethyl-N:N'-dilaurylethylenediammonium difluoride, N-cetylpyridinium fluoride, N:N-dilauryl-morpholinium fluoride, N-myristyl-N-ethylmorpholinium fluoride, N-(octylaminocarbonylethyl)-N-benzyldimethylammonium fluoride, N-(B-hydroxydodecyl)trimethylammonium fluoride, N-phenyl-N-hexadecyldiethylammonium fluoride, N-cyclohexyl-N-octadecyldimethylammonium fluoride, N-(2-carbomethoxyethyl)-N-benzyldimethylammonium fluoride, N-(2-carbocyclohexoxyethyl)-N-myristyldimethylammonium fluoride, N-(2-carbobenzyloxyethyl)-N-dodecyldimethylammonium fluoride, N-[2-(N:N'-dimethylaminocarbonyl)-ethyl]-N-dodecyldiethylammonlum fluoride, N-carboxymethyl-N-cicosyldimethylammonium fluoride, olaflur (N1-octadecyltrimethylendiamine-N,N,N'-tris(2-ethanol)-dihydrofluoride), betaine hydrofluoride, sarcosine stannous fluoride, alanine stannous fluoride, glycine potassium fluoride, sarcosine potassium fluoride, glycine hydrofluoride, lysine hydrofluoride, alanine hydrofluoride, betaine zirconium fluoride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0028]     The fluoride-providing agent is present in an amount sufficient to release between about 200 ppm to 3000 ppm fluoride ion, preferably from about 800<br>
to about 1500 ppm fluoride ion. The fluoride-providing agent may be present in the composition from about 0.001 % to about 3% by weight.<br>
[0029] Embodiments of the present invention may also include preservatives such as parabens, including propyl paraben (propyl parahydroxy benzoate) and methyl paraben, dehydroacetic acid, sorbic acid, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and mixtures thereof. These and other suitable preservatives are disclosed U.S. Patent No. 5,116,602, Robinson, et al., issued May 26,1991; and U.S. Patent No. 4,431,628, Gaffar, issued February 14, 1984. A preferred mixture comprises methyl paraben and propyl paraben. The preservative is present in the composition at about 0.001% to about 0.2% by weight, preferably from about 0.07% to about 0.12% by weight.<br>
Orally Acceptable Carrier<br>
[0030] As used herein, an "orally acceptable carrier" refers to a material or combination of materials that are safe for use in the compositions of the present invention, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, with which the xylitol and water-soluble calcium salt may be associated while retaining significant efficacy. Preferably, the carrier does not substantially reduce the efficacy of the active materials of the present compositions. Selection of specific carrier components is dependent on the desired product form, including dentifrices, rinses, gels, paints, toothpastes, tooth powders, prophylaxis pastes, lozenges, and gums.<br>
[0031] The term "oral cavity" as referred to herein refers to the cavity from the lips to the epiglottis. The oral cavity comprises "hard tissues" comprising tissues<br>
such as the teeth and periodontal support and the like, as well as "soft tissues" which comprise tissues such as the gums, the tongue, the surfaces of the buccal cavity, and the like. Within the scope of this application, an "oral surface" includes the hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity.<br>
[0032] In various embodiments, the orally acceptable vehicle used to prepare the oral care composition is aqueous. As recognized by one of skill in the art, the oral compositions of the present invention optionally include other materials, such as for example, anticaries agents, including the fluoride providing agents already described, desensitizing agents, viscosity modifiers, diluents, surface active agents, such as surfactants, emulslfiers, and foam modulators, pH modifying agents, abrasives, humectants, mouth-feel agents, sweetening agents, flavor agents, colorants, preservatives, and combinations thereof. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of materials may differ, there may be some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two or more of such categories of materials. Preferably, the carrier materials are selected for compatibility with other ingredients of the composition.<br>
Mouthrinses<br>
[0033] The term "mouthrinse" in the present invention refers to oral compositions that are substantially liquid in character, such as a mouthwash, spray, or rinse. In such a preparation the orally acceptable vehicle is typically a water-and-alcoho! mixture, desirably including a humectant and surfactant as described below. Generally, the weight ratio of water to alcohol is in the range of from about 1:1 to<br>
about 20:1, preferably about 3:1 to 10:1 and more preferably about 5:1 to about 8:1. The total amount of water-alcohol mixture in this type of preparation is typically in the range of from about 70% to about 99.9% by weight of the preparation. In various embodiments, the alcohol is typically ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
[0034] The pH of such liquid and other preparations of the invention is generally in the range of from about 4.5 to about 9. The pH can be controlled with acid (e.g. citric acid or benzoic acid) or base (e.g. sodium hydroxide) or buffered (as with combinations of sodium citrate, benzoate, carbonate, or bicarbonate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, or sodium dihydrogen phosphate, for example).<br>
[0035] An aqueous oral composition of the present invention such as a mouthrinse is prepared using an aqueous vehicle which preferably contains a humectant. The humectant may be a mixture of humectants, such as glycerin and sorbitol, and a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene glycol, butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol. The humectant content is in the range of about 5% to about 40% by weight and preferably about 10% to about 30% by weight.<br>
[0036] Surfactants useful in the present embodiment include anionic, nonionic, and zwitterionic surfactants. The surfactant is present in the aqueous oral compositions of the present invention range from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight, preferably from about 0.6% to about 2.0% by weight.<br>
[0037] The mouthrinse and other liquid compositions (e.g. liquid dentifrice) may include at least one viscosity modifier, useful for example to inhibit settling or separation of ingredients or to promote redispersibility upon agitation of a liquid composition. Any orally acceptable viscosity modifier can be used, including without<br>
limitation mineral oil, petrolatum, clays and organomodified clays, silica and the like. One or more viscosity modifiers are optionally present in a total amount of about 0.01% to about 10%, for example about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
Confectionery Compositions<br>
[0038] The term "confectionery composition" as used herein includes within its meaning chewing gum, and orally soluble tablets, beads, lozenges, and films. Saliva dissolves the lozenge, film, or components of the chewable gum product and promotes prolonged contact with oral surfaces. Delivery of the water-soluble calcium salt and xylitol in a lozenge, tablet, bead, or chewing gum form ensures that an adequate dosage of the anti-caries ingredients are delivered to the oral surface when the product is used.<br>
Lozenge/Bead/Tablet<br>
[0039] The orally acceptable vehicle or carrier in a lozenge, bead, or tablet may be a non-cariogenic, solid, water-soluble, polyhydric alcohol (polyol), such as mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, malitol, hydrogenated starch hydrozylate, hydrogenated glucose, hydrogenated disaccharides, or hydrogenated polysaccharides, preferably in an amount of about 85% to about 95% by weight of the total composition. Emulsifiers such as glycerin and tableting lubricants, in minor amounts of about 0.1% to 5% by weight, may be incorporated into the tablet, bead, or lozenge formulation to facilitate preparation. Suitable lubricants that may be incorporated as<br>
vegetable oils such as coconut oil, magnesium stearate, aluminum stearate, talc, starch, polyalkylene polyethers such as those under the name CARBOWAX (Dow Chemical, Midland, Michigan, USA). Suitable non-cariogenic gums include kappa carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like.<br>
[0040] The lozenge, bead or tablet may optionally be coated with a coating material such as waxes, shellac, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer or kappa carrageenan to further increase the time it takes the tablet or lozenge to dissolve in the mouth. An uncoated tablet or lozenge is slow-dissolving, providing a sustained release rate of active ingredients of about 3 to 5 minutes, depending upon the size of the lozenge.<br>
Chewing Gum<br>
[0041] The chewing gum of the present invention is preferably a sugarless chewing gum containing the xylitol and water-soluble calcium salt. Chewing gum formulations typically contain, in addition to a chewing gum base, one or more plasticizing agents, at least one sweetening agent, and at least one flavoring agent.<br>
[0042] Suitable gum base materials suitable for use in the practice of this invention are well known in the art and include natural or synthetic gum bases or mixtures thereof. Representative natural gums or elastomers include chicle, natural rubber, jelutong, balata, guttapercha, lechi casp!, sonva, guttakay, crown gum, perlllo, and mixtures thereof. Representative synthetic gums or elastomers Include butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene copolymers. The gum base is incorporated in the chewing gum product at a<br>
concentration of about 10% to about 40% and preferably about 20% to about 35% by weight.<br>
[0043] Plasticizing or softening agents commonly used in chewing gum compositions are suitable for use in this invention, including gelatin, waxes, and mixtures thereof in amounts of 0.1% to 5% by weight. A sweetening agent ingredient may be selected from a wide range of materials, and include the same artificial and polyol sweeteners used for the preparation of tablets, beads, and lozenges. Polyol sweeteners such as sorbitol and malitol are present in the chewing gum composition of the present invention in amounts of about 40% to about 80% by weight and preferably about 50% to about 75% by weight. The artificial sweetener is present in the chewing gum composition of the present invention in amounts of about 0.1 % to about 2% by weight and preferably about 0.3% to 1 % by weight.<br>
Films<br>

METHODS<br>
[0071] Methods are provided to treat or prevent dental caries in a human or animal subject comprising administering a safe and effective amount of an oral care composition to the oral cavity of the subject, the composition comprising: xylitol and a water-soluble calcium salt, wherein the xylitol and the calcium salt are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1. As used herein "animal subject" includes higher order non-human mammals such as canines and felines. The oral care composition is contacted with an oral surface of the mammalian subject to thereby provide xylitol and calcium and phosphate ions to promote remineralization and prevent demineralization of the teeth in a highly efficacious manner, without any negative interaction between the xylitol, the water-soluble calcium salt, and the orally acceptable vehicle.<br>
[0072] In various embodiments, it is preferred that the oral care composition is applied and contacted with the oral surface. The dentifrice, confectionery, or mouthwash prepared in accordance with the present invention is preferably applied regularly to an oral surface, preferably on a daily basis, at least one time daily for multiple days, but alternately every second or third day. Preferably the oral composition is applied to the oral surfaces from 1 to 3 times daily, at a pH of about 4.5 to about 9, generally about 5.5 to about 8, preferably about 6 to 8, for at least 2 weeks up to 8 weeks, from two years to three years, or more up to lifetime.<br>
[0073] Compositions of the present invention may also be used for the treatment or prevention of systemic disorders, such as the improvement of overall systemic health characterized by a reduction in risk of development of systemic<br>
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, severe respiratory infection, premature and low birth weight infants (including associated post-partum dysfunction in neurologic/developmental function), and associated increased risk of mortality. Such methods include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0206874, Doyle et al., published November 6, 2003, incorporated by reference.<br>
[0074] The oral compositions of the present invention may be prepared by suitably mixing the ingredients. For instance, in the preparation of a mouthrinse, the xylitol and water-soluble calcium salt are dispersed in a mixture of ingredients, e.g., alcohol, humectants, surfactants, and flavor are then added and mixed. The Ingredients are then mixed under vacuum for about 15-30 minutes. The resulting rinse product is then packaged. Dentifrices are prepared similarly, additional thickener and abrasives agents being included in the last step.<br>
[0075]     The invention is illustrated in the following examples.<br>
Examples Example 1<br>
[0076] An oral care composition is prepared according to the following table. Xylitol is present in the composition at 10% by weight and prevents plaque formation and the development of S. mutans. Calcium glycerophosphate is present in the composition at 0.13% by weight and delivers calcium ions to the composition. Sodium monofluorophosphate is present in the composition at 1.10% by weight and delivers fluoride ions to the composition. The reduction in plaque formation and the<br>
delivery of calcium ions and fluoride ions to the teeth provides surprisingly high levels of remineralization in existing dental caries and also prevents new dental caries from developing.   <br>
(Example Removed)<br>
Example 2<br>
[0077] The oral care composition according to Example 1 is administered to a German shepherd subject having carious lesions. The composition is spread on the oral and dental surfaces of the animal with an applicator once daily for two years to reduce the amount of S. mutans in the oral cavity and remineralize the teeth.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0078] The oral care composition according to Example 1 is administered to a human subject having no existing dental caries. The composition is applied with a toothbrush twice daily for three months to prevent dental caries and reduce plaque formation.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0079] An oral care composition is prepared according to the following table. The composition is administered to a subject as in Example 3.  <br>
