Device for drying compressed gas.<br>
The present invention concerns a device for drying a<br>
5 compressed gas.<br>
In particular, the invention concerns a device for drying<br>
compressed gas in a non-dissipative manner, in other words<br>
a device whereby the heat of the compression, present in<br>
10 the compressed gas, is used as a whole or partly to<br>
regenerate the desiccant, and whereby the entire supplied<br>
gas flow flows integrally through the device, without any<br>
part of this gas being blown off in the atmosphere or<br>
being fed back to the output of the device, which results<br>
15 in that such a device has a better efficiency than certain<br>
existing devices.<br>
In particular, the invention concerns a device for drying<br>
a compressed gas in a non-dissipative manner, which mainly<br>
20 consists of a supply of compressed gas, for example in the<br>
shape of a compressed air compressor, at least two<br>
pressure vessels with an input and an output and a take-<br>
off point for compressed gas consumers.<br>
25 Such devices are already known, for example from U.S.<br>
patent No. 6.3.71.377, whereby the above-mentioned pressure<br>
vessels are filled with a dessicant and whereby the gas to<br>
be dried is sent through a first regenerating<br><br>

pressure vessel so as to absorb moisture from the<br>
desiccant, by making use of the heat of said compressed<br>
gas, and to thus regenerate this desiccant, and whereby<br>
this gas is subsequently cooled by means of a cooler to<br>
5 be then guided through a second drying pressure vessel<br>
where this cooled gas is dried by the desiccant.<br>
As soon as the desiccant in the drying pressure vessel<br>
is saturated, the flow-through sequence of the pressure<br>
vessels is reversed, such that the first pressure vessel<br>
10 becomes a drying vessel, whereas the second pressure<br>
vessel is turned into a regenerating pressure vessel.<br>
Thus, thanks to the alternating use of the above-<br>
mentioned pressure vessels as a drying and regenerating<br>
pressure vessel, one pressure vessel will always be<br>
15 regenerated by the compressed gas, whereas the other<br>
pressure vessel makes sure that this compressed gas is<br>
subsequently dried.<br>
The known devices for drying a compressed gas in a non-<br>
20 dissipative manner are disadvantageous in that they are<br>
provided with a large number of pipes and valves for<br>
reversing the pressure vessels as regenerating and drying<br>
pressure vessels, and in that they are very large and<br>
expensive and have a complex, non-modular design, such<br>
25 that a large number of variants need to be supported,<br>
which increases the development, production and<br>
maintenance costs.<br>
In order to make the existing devices less complex, use<br><br>

is sometimes made of three-way and/or four-way valves,<br>
which are much more expensive and less reliable than<br>
conventional two-way valves, such that the operational<br>
reliability of the installation as a whole is strongly<br>
5 reduced.<br>
An additional disadvantage for devices with a larger<br>
Capacity for drying compressed gas is that it is often<br>
impossible, or at least economically inefficient to find<br>
10 3-way or 4-way valves which meet the demands as far as<br>
required temperature, pressure and flow are concerned.<br>
US 6.375.722 and WO 03035220 both describe a device for<br>
drying gas in a dissipative manner, whereby part of the<br>
15 gas is blown off in the atmosphere, and whereby said<br>
device comprises at least fourteen valves.<br>
The present invention aims to offer a device for drying a<br>
compressed gas in a non-dissipative manner which does not<br>
20 have the above-mentioned and other disadvantages and which<br>
can be applied to different types of adsorption drying<br>
devices in a simple and cheap manner.<br>
To this end, the present invention concerns a device of<br>
25 the above-mentioned type for drying a compressed gas in a<br>
non-dissipative manner, whereby this device is is<br>
additionally provided with a first distribution device<br>
onto which said compressed gas supply and the take-off<br>
point are connected and which is also connected to each of<br>

vessels, and whereby the cibove-mentioned first and second<br>
distribution devices are connected to each other, said<br>
device being characterised in that it is provided with<br>
nine or ten cut-off valves; in that said first<br>
5 distribution device comprises three parallel connected<br>
pipes in which are each time provided two cut-off valves<br>
and onto which is each time connected, between two cut-off<br>
valves, a branch, namely a first pipe with a first branch<br>
which provides a connection to the second distribution<br>
10 device, a second pipe with a second branch which is<br>
connected to the above-mentioned take-off point for a<br>
compressed gas consumer; and a third pipe with a third<br>
branch as a connection to the compressed gas supply and a<br>
fourth branch which is connected to the second<br>
15 distribution device via a cut-off valve and in that said<br>
second distribution device comprises three parallel<br>
connected pipes, a first pipe and a second pipe<br>
respectively in which are provided two non-return valves<br>
with an opposite flow direction and a third pipe with two<br>
20 cut-off valves in it, whereby the first pipe, the second<br>
pipe respectively, are each connected between the two non-<br>
return valves, to said fourth branch and the first branch<br>
of the first distribution device respectively, and whereby<br>
the first and the third pipe of the second distribution<br>
25 device are mutually connected via a cooler between the<br>
valves.<br>
By cut-off valves are meant valves which can be controlled<br>
manually or in an automated manner, in other words which<br>
30 can be opened and closed; Non-return valves which cannot<br>

be controlled as such are considered consequently not<br>
regarded as cut-off valves as meant here.<br>
A really major advantage of such a device according to the<br>
5 present invention is that it only has to be provided with<br>
a relatively limited number of valves compared to the<br>
existing devices for drying a compressed gas in a non-<br>
dissipative manner, as a result of which the device is<br>
cheaper and requires less maintenance costs.<br>
10<br>
If the above-mentioned valves are made in the form of<br>
automatically controlled valves, use can be made in this<br>
specific construction of a relatively simple control<br>
system with a limited number of inputs and outputs, and<br>
15 the control program is simplified as well in comparison<br>
with the known devices.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of a device according to the<br>
invention, the above-mentioned first and second<br>
20 distribution devices are each built symmetrically and/or<br>
modularly.<br>
By a symmetrical construction of the distribution devices<br>
is meant a functional symmetry in this case, and not so<br>
25 much a strictly geometric symmetry. This .	**- £f<br>
rtW -&gt;♦ +u- cnA<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
5<br>
implies that the distribution devices can be made<br>
asymmetrical in shape, but that the device can be<br>
represented by means of a symmetrical functional diagram.<br>
5 A major advantage of such a device according to the<br>
invention is that, thanks to the symmetrical<br>
construction, it contains a large number of common parts,<br>
such as for example pipes and pressure vessels, which<br>
can consequently be produced in larger numbers and thus<br>
10 in a cheaper manner.<br>
Another advantage of a device according to the<br>
invention is that, thanks to the symmetrical<br>
construction, the above-mentioned distribution devices<br>
can be mounted one above the other, such that the length<br>
15 of the connecting lines between both distribution devices<br>
is reduced to a minimum, the device is reduced in size,<br>
and costs are saved.<br>
Another advantage of a device according to the invention<br>
is that, thanks to the combination of the modular<br>
20 construction and the symmetrical arrangement of the<br>
distribution devices, one and the same distribution<br>
device can be combined with pressure vessels having<br>
different diameters. Since the diameter of the pressure<br>
vessels, as opposed to the diameter of the pipes in<br>
25 the distribution device, strongly depends on the flow<br>
rate to be dried, there are usually many more variants<br>
of the pressure vessels than there are variants of<br>
distribution devices.<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
6<br>
Since, according to the invention, variants of<br>
distribution devices	and pressure	vessels	are<br>
independently interchangeable, less different parts will<br>
need to be kept in stock and production costs can be<br>
5 saved.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
present invention, the following preferred embodiments<br>
of a device according to the invention for drying a<br>
10 compressed gas are given as an example only without being<br>
limitative in any way, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>

invention;<br>

according to figure 1;<br>
figure 6 represents a practical embodiment of the device<br>
according to figure 1;<br>
figures 7 and 8 represent a view according to arrows F7 and<br>
20	F8 respectively in figure 6;<br>
figures 9, 14, 19 and 24 represent variants of a device<br>

Figure 1 represents a device 1 according to the invention<br>
for drying a compressed gas in a non-dissipative manner which<br>
is provided with a compressed gas supply 2, which in this<br>
-case is formed of a compressor and which is connected<br>
30 to a first distribution device 3.<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
7<br>
The above-mentioned first distribution device 3 is in this<br>
case formed of three parallel pipes which are connected to<br>
each other, a first pipe 4, a second pipe 5 and a third pipe<br>
6 respectively, in which are each time provided two valves 7-<br>
5 8f 11-12 and 9-10 which can be cut off, which in this case,<br>
but not necessarily, are made in the shape of controlled<br>
valves which are connected to a control system which is<br>
not represented in the figures.<br>
10 Further, the device 1 comprises a second distribution<br>
device 13 which in this case has practically the same<br>
dimensions and geometry as the above-mentioned first<br>
distribution device 3 and which also mainly consists of<br>
three parallel pipes 14, IS and 16 which are connected<br>
15 to each other, a first pipe 14 and a second pipe 15<br>
respectively in which are each time provided two non-<br>
return valves 17-18, 19-20 respectively with an<br>
opposite flow direction, and a third pipe 16 with two<br>
valves 21 and 22 in it which can be cut off and which<br>
20 in this case, but not necessarily, are made in the form<br>
of controlled valves as well which are connected to the<br>
above-mentioned control system.<br>
In the given example, the above-mentioned non-return<br>
25 valves 17 and 18 in the first pipe 14 of the second<br>
distribution device 13 are positioned such that they allow<br>
for a flow in the direction of one non-return valve to the<br>
other non-return valve in the pipe 14 concerned, and the<br>
above-mentioned non-return valves 19 and 20 in the<br>
30 second pipe 15 of the second distribution device 13 are<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
8<br>
positioned such that they allow for a flow in the<br>
direction away from the other non-return valve in the<br>
pipe 15 concerned.<br>
5 It should be noted that the functional diagram in figure 1<br>
of the above-mentioned first and second distribution<br>
device 3 and 13 is built up symmetrically. This symmetry<br>
can also be used in a practical embodiment, such as<br>
represented for example for the distribution devices 3 and<br>
10 13 in figures 6 to 8.<br>
Between the valves 7 and 8 which can be cut off from<br>
the pipe 4 is connected a first branch 23 which provides<br>
a connection to the second distribution device 13 and<br>
which is connected in particular via a cooler 24 to the<br>
15 pipe 15/ between the non-return valves 19 and 20.<br>
In the pipe 5, between the valves 11 and 12 which can be<br>
cut off, is connected a second branch 25 which is<br>
connected to a take-off point 26 for a compressed gas<br>
20 consumer.<br>
Between the valves 9 and 10 which can be cut off from the<br>
pipe 6 is provided a third branch 27 as a connection to<br>
the above-mentioned compressed gas supply 2 and a fourth<br>
branch 28 which is connected to the second distribution<br>
25 device 13 via a valve 29 which can be cut off, in<br>
particular between the non-return valves 17 and 18 in<br>
the pipe 14.<br>
The pipes 14 and 16 are mutually connected between the<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
9<br>
above-mentioned valves 17-18 and 21-22 via a cooler 30.<br>
Further, the device 1 for drying a compressed gas in a<br>
non-dissipative manner is also provided with two pressure<br>
5 vessels 31 and 32 which are filled with a desiccant, for<br>
example in the form of silica gel, and which are both<br>
provided with an input 33, 34 respectively and an<br>
output 35, 36 respectively.<br>
10 It is clear that instead of silica gel as a desiccant,<br>
also other desiccants can be used.<br>
The above-mentioned first distribution device 3 is<br>
connected to the outputs 35 and 36 of the pressure<br>
15 vessels 31 and 32 with the respective parallel<br>
connections between the pipes 4, 5 and 6, whereas the<br>
second distribution device 13 is connected to the inputs<br>
33 and 34 of these pressure vessels 31 and 32 with the<br>
respective parallel connections between the pipes 14, 15<br>
20 and 16.<br>
According to the invention, the device 1 in this case<br>
has only nine valves 7 to 12, 21, 22 and 29 which can be<br>
cut off, which is less than with the known devices for<br>
drying compressed gas in a non-dissipative manner, so<br>
25 that, partly thanks to the symmetry, a simpler layout is<br>
obtained which is moreover less liable to wear and<br>
consequently requires less maintenance.<br>
The working of a device 1 according to the invention<br>
for drying a compressed gas in a non-dissipative manner<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
10<br>
is very simple and is illustrated by means of figures 2<br>
to 5, whereby cut-off valves are represented in black<br>
when they are closed in these figures, whereas valves<br>
in their open position are represented in white and the<br>
5 flow of the gas is represented in bold.<br>
In a first phase, which is represented in figure 2, the<br>
pressure vessel 31 is used to regenerate the desiccant<br>
which is present in this pressure vessel 31, and the<br>
pressure vessel 32 is used for drying gas coming from the<br>
10 supply 2.<br>
To this end, the hot, compressed gas coming from the<br>
supply 2 is guided, via the open valve 9, through the<br>
first pressure vessel 31.<br>
15 Moisture which is present in the desiccant in this first<br>
pressure vessel 31 is absorbed by the hot, compressed<br>
gas, such that the desiccant is regenerated in this<br>
first pressure vessel 31.<br>
20 Next, the gas flow goes to the cooler 30 via the non-<br>
return valve 17, where it is cooled, and part of the<br>
moisture situated in the gas flow will condense to be then<br>
guided via the valve 22 through the second pressure<br>
vessel 32, where the gas is dried by the desiccant.<br>
25 The output 36 of the second pressure vessel 32 is<br>
at that time connected via the valve 12 to the take-<br>
off point 26 onto which one or several dried compressed<br>
gas consumers are connected.<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
11<br>
It is clear that the output coming from the supply 2<br>
flows entirely and without any losses through both<br>
pressure vessels 25 to the take-off point 26.<br>
During a second phase, which is represented in figure 3,<br>
5 and which occurs at the end of the regeneration cycle of<br>
the desiccant in the regenerating pressure vessel 31, the<br>
entire output of compressed gas is successively guided via<br>
the valve 29 through the cooler 30 and via the valve 21<br>
through the first pressure vessel 31, as a result of<br>
10 which this first, regenerating pressure vessel 31 is<br>
cooled.<br>
Next, the gas flows via the valve 7 and the branch 23<br>
through the cooler 24 and the non-return valve 20 to the<br>
second pressure vessel 32 where this gas is dried by the<br>
15 desiccant, after which it flows via the valve 12 and the<br>
branch 25 to the take-off point 26 for compressed gas<br>
consumers.<br>
In a third, subsequent phase, when the desiccant in<br>
20 the drying pressure vessel 32 is almost saturated and/or<br>
the desiccant in the regenerated pressure vessel 31 is<br>
practically cooled, the compressed gas, as represented in<br>
figure 4, is divided for a short time span via the cooler<br>
30	and via the valves 21 and 22 over both pressure<br>
25 vessels 31 and 32. The regenerated pressure vessel<br>
31	is hereby cooled somewhat further, and the almost<br>
saturated pressure vessel 32 is somewhat relieved.<br>
An advantage of cooling the desiccant in the regenerated<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
12<br>
pressure vessel 31 at the end of the regeneration<br>
cycle is that, at the time the pressure vessels 31 and<br>
32 are changed over, whereby the regenerated pressure<br>
vessel 31 becomes a drying pressure vessel and vice<br>
5 versa, temperature and dew point peaks of the compressed<br>
gas at the take-off point 26 are avoided.<br>
In a fourth and final phase, represented in figure 5,<br>
the entire output of the compressed gas is carried via<br>
the valve 29, the cooler 30 and the valve 22 through the<br>
10 practically saturated second pressure vessel 32, after<br>
which it is guided to the above-mentioned take-off point<br>
26.<br>
After this final phase there is a return to the first<br>
phase, but the pressure vessels 31 and 32 are hereby<br>
15 changed over and the first pressure vessel 31 then<br>
becomes the drying pressure vessel, whereas the second<br>
pressure vessel 32 will be regenerated, etc.<br>
Since it is possible to dry in a non-dissipative manner<br>
with a device 1 according to the invention (save for a<br>
20 pressure drop of the gas between the inlet and the<br>
outlet), energy can be saved in comparison with<br>
devices whereby a part of the compressed gas is fed<br>
back or is blown off in the atmosphere.<br>
In an embodiment of a device 1 according to the<br>
25 invention which is not represented in th-e figures,<br>
heating elements can be provided, either in the<br>
pressure vessels 31 and 32, or outside these pressure<br><br>

vessels 31 and 32, which heating elements are designed to<br>
better regenerate the desiccant, and to thus further<br>
reduce the dew point of the gas at the outlet of the<br>
device 1.<br>
5 Figures 6 to 8 represent a practical embodiment of a<br>
device according to figure 1, whereby the first and<br>
second distribution device, 3 and 13 respectively, are<br>
made symmetrical by means of tubular constructions which<br>
are identical in shape and which are provided<br>
10 concentrically on top of each other.<br>
In the given example, the above-mentioned tubular<br>
constructions are made according to standard dimensions,<br>
such that they can be combined with pressure vessels 31<br>
15 and 32 having different volumes and for devices 1 having<br>
different capacities. Thus, the arrangement of the<br>
pressure vessels and tubular construction is modular, as<br>
a result of which the number of variants for the<br>
production is restricted and costs are saved.<br>
20 In this case, the above-mentioned branches and<br>
connections can be realised in a simple manner by means<br>
of short pipes or lines provided between the tubular<br>
constructions situated on top of each other.<br>
Figure 9 r-epresents another embodiment of a device 1<br>
25 according to the invention, whereby no cooler is<br>
provided in the above-mentioned first branch 23 of the<br>
first distribution device 3 in this case.<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
14<br>
This will reduce the cost of the device even further,<br>
whereas it is nevertheless possible to obtain a good<br>
output with the device 1.<br>
5 The working of this variant is practically analogous to<br>
that of the preceding embodiment.<br>
The first, third and fourth phases as represented in<br>
figures 10, 12 and 13 respectively, are identical to the<br>
first, third and fourth phases of the preceding<br>
10 embodiment, as represented in figures 2, 4 and 5<br>
respectively.<br>
The second phase, which is represented in figure 11, is<br>
somewhat different in this embodiment from the one<br>
described above.<br>
15 During this second phase, the entire output of gas to be<br>
dried is directed via the valve 29 through the cooler 30<br>
in this case, after which this gas flows via the valve 22<br>
to the input 34 of the second, drying pressure vessel 32<br>
so as to be dried.<br>
20 Next, the dried compressed gas flows via the valve 8 and<br>
through the first branch 23 of the first distribution<br>
device 3 to the pipe 15, where this gas flows via the<br>
non-return valve 19 to the regenerating pressure vessel<br>
31 so as to then be carried via the branch 25 to the<br>
25 take-off point 26.<br>
Since the compressed gas is cooled and dried first,<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
15<br>
before flowing through the regenerating pressure vessel<br>
31, this gas will cool said regenerating pressure<br>
vessel 31.<br>
Figure 14 represents yet another embodiment of a device<br>
5 1 according to the invention for drying a compressed gas<br>
in a non-dissipative manner, whereby a connecting line<br>
37 is provided between the valves 7 and 8 in the pipe<br>
4 and between the valves 21 and 22 in the pipe 16, in<br>
which is provided a valve 38 which can be cut off.<br>
10 In this case, the device 1 according to the invention<br>
is controlled by means of ten cut-off valves, which is<br>
considerably less than with known devices which make it<br>
possible to go through the same phases and to dry in a<br>
non-dissipative manner.<br>
15 The working of such an embodiment according to figure 14 is<br>
practically analogous to that of the first embodiment and it<br>
is represented in figures 15 to 18.<br>
In a first phase, which is represented in figure 15, the<br>
hot compressed gas is first guided via the valve 9 through<br>
20 the regenerating pressure vessel 31, after which the damp gas<br>
is guided via the non-return valve 17, the cooler 30 and the<br>
valve 38 through the branch 23 and the cooler 24 to<br>
subsequently flow through the non-return valve 20 to the<br>
drying pressure vessel 32 where it is dried.<br>
25 The dried -compressed gas is finally carried via the valve 12<br>
and the branch 25 to the above-mentioned take-off point 26 for<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
16<br>
compressed gas consumers.<br>
Consequently, the coolers 30 and 24 are connected in series<br>
in this case, as a result of which the cooling capacity is<br>
increased and as a result of which the gas can be dried more<br>
5 efficiently. This results in a lower dew point of the<br>
compressed gas at the take-off point of the dryer.<br>
During the second phase, which is represented in figure 16,<br>
the gas flows through the device 1 in an identical manner as<br>
during the second phase of the device, as is represented in<br>
10 figure 3, whereby the regenerating pressure vessel 31 is<br>
cooled.<br>
During the third and the fourth phase, which are represented<br>
in figures 17 and 18 respectively, the above-mentioned<br>
coolers 30 and 24 are each time connected in series by<br>
15 opening the valve 38 and closing the valve 22.<br>
In the third phase, after flowing through the coolers 30<br>
and 24, the gas is split up via the non-return valves 19<br>
and 20 in the pipe 15 to the regenerating pressure vessel<br>
31 on the one hand and the drying pressure vessel 32 on the<br>
20 other hand.<br>
Next, these split gas flows come together again via the<br>
valves 11 and 12 in the branch 25 so as to be guided to<br>
the take-off point 26.<br>
During the fourth phase, the entire compressed gas<br>
25 flow, cooled by the coolers 30 and 24, is sent through<br><br>
WO 2007/033440<br><br>
PCT/BE2006/000100<br><br>
17<br>
the drying pressure vessel 32, after which it flows via<br>
the branch 25 to the take-off point 26.<br>
By analogy with the preceding embodiments, the drying<br>
pressure vessel 31 is afterwards changed over to the<br>
5 regenerating pressure vessel 32.<br>
It should be noted that, in this embodiment of the device<br>
1, both available coolers 30 and 24 can be used in any<br>
phase of the drying process, and thus, in every phase,<br>
the compressed gas is maximally cooled before flowing into<br>
10 the drying pressure vessel 31, which results in a minimal<br>
dew point of the gas at the take-off point 26.<br>
Figure 19 represents another variant of a device 1<br>
according to figure 1 whereby, in this case, a<br>
15 connecting line 39 is provided between the valves 7<br>
and 8 which can be cut off in the pipe 4 and between the<br>
non-return valves 17 and 18 in the pipe 14, in which is provided<br>
a valve 40 which can be cut off.<br>
The working of such a variant is analogous to that	of the<br>
20 preceding embodiment, whereby in this case however,	in the<br>
first, third and fourth phase, the coolers 30 and	24 are<br>
connected in parallel, as a result of which the	cooling<br>
capacity will be considerably higher than with a single	cooler,<br>
and the gas can be dried better.<br>
25 Moreover, by connecting the coolers 30 and 24 in parallel, the<br>
pressure drop over these coolers 30 and 24 will be lower than<br>
when these coolers 30 and 24 are connected in series.<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
18<br>
The coolers 30 and 24 are connected in series, as is<br>
represented in figures 20, 22 and 23, by opening the valves 40<br>
and 22 which can be cut off.<br>
Figure 24 represents yet another embodiment of a device<br>
5 according to figure 1, whereby three pressure vessels 41, 42<br>
and 4 3 are provided which are connected to a first<br>
distribution device 44 with their outputs and to a second<br>
distribution device 45 with their inputs.<br>
The above-mentioned first distribution device 44 in this case<br>
10 consists of three main pipes, namely a first 30 main pipe<br>
46 onto which are connected three branches 47 to 49; a second<br>
main pipe 50 with branches 51 to 53; and a third main pipe 54<br>
with branches 55 to 57.<br>
Each of the above-mentioned branches 47 to 49, 51 to 53<br>
15 and 55 to 57 is connected to the output of a<br>
respective pressure vessel 41, 42 and 43.<br>
In the branches 4 7 to 4 9 and 51 to 53 is each time<br>
provided a cut-off valve, whereas in each of the<br>
20 branches 55 to 57 is provided a non-return valve which is<br>
positioned such that it allows for a flow to the<br>
respective pressure vessel 41, 42, 43 with which the<br>
branch 55 to 57 concerned is connected.<br>
25 The main pipes 46 and 54 are connected to each other by<br>
means of a bypass 58, and the above-mentioned supply 2<br>
for compressed gas is directly connected to the main<br>
pipe 50.<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
19<br>
The second distribution device 45 is built in<br>
practically the same manner as the first distribution<br>
device 44, and it is also provided with three main<br>
pipes, a first main pipe 59 with three branches 60 to<br>
5 62; a second main pipe 63 with branches 64 to 66; and a<br>
third main pipe 61 with branches 68 to 70 respectively.<br>
Each of the above-mentioned branches 60 to 62, 64 to 66<br>
and 68 tot 70 is connected to the input of a respective<br>
10 pressure vessel 41, 42 and 43.<br>
In the branches 60 to 62 and 64 to 66 is each time<br>
provided a cut-off valve, whereas in each of the<br>
branches 68 to 70 is provided a non-return valve which is<br>
positioned such that it allows for a flow from the<br>
15 respective pressure vessels 41, 42, 43 with which the<br>
branches 68 to 70 concerned are connected.<br>
The main pipes 63 and 67 of the second distribution<br>
device 45 are connected to each other via a cooler 71.<br>
The above-mentioned main pipe 54 is connected to the<br>
20 main pipe 59 and to the take-off point 26 for compressed<br>
gas consumers by means of a first connecting line 72<br>
having a valve 73 which can be cut off provided in it.<br>
The above-mentioned main pipe 50 is connected to the<br>
main pipe 67 by means of a second connecting line 74, in<br>
25 which is provided a valve 75 which can be cut off.<br>
The working of a device 1 according to figure 24 is<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
20<br>
represented step by step in figures 25 to 28.<br>
In a first phase, the first pressure vessel 41 is<br>
regenerated, whereas the second and third pressure<br>
vessels 42 and 43 both form drying pressure vessels.<br>
5 The hot compressed gas is in this first phase<br>
directed via the branch 51 through the pressure vessel<br>
41, where the hot gas absorbs moisture from the<br>
desiccant, as a result of which this pressure vessel<br>
41 is regenerated.<br>
10 Next, the damp, compressed gas flows via a non-return<br>
valve in the branch 68 to the cooler 71, after which<br>
the cooled gas flows through the valves in the<br>
branches 65 and 66 to the pressure vessels 42 and 4 3 to<br>
be dried.<br>
15 The dried compressed gas is then directed through the valves<br>
in the branches 48 and 4 9 and via the main pipe 46 to<br>
the bypass 58 and afterwards, via the connecting line 72, to<br>
the take-off point 26.<br>
In the second phase, which is represented in figure 26, the hot<br>
20 compressed gas, coming from the supply 2, is first directed<br>
via the connecting line 74 and the main pipe 67 through the<br>
cooler 71 to subsequently flow via the branches 65 and 66 to<br>
the pressure vessels 42 and 43 so as to be dried there.<br>
The dried compressed gas is then directed via the branches 48<br>
25 and 49 and via the bypass 58 through the non-return valve in<br><br>
WO 2007/033440	PCT/BE2006/000100<br>
21<br>
the branch 55 into the first pressure vessel 41 which is<br>
cooled by the gas.<br>
Finally, the gas flow is directed via the branch 60 to the<br>
take-off point 26.<br>
5 In the third phase, which is represented in figure 27, the<br>
hot compressed gas is first directed via the connecting line<br>
74 and the main pipe 67 through the cooler 71 to be<br>
subsequently split and be directed via each of the<br>
branches 64 to 66 to the respective pressure vessels 41<br>
10 to 43.<br>
Next, the split gas flows are directed via the branches 47 to<br>
49 to flow together again in the main pipe 46 and to be<br>
carried via the bypass 58 and the connecting line 72 to the<br>
take-off point 26.<br>
15 The first pressure vessel 41 is cooled further in this<br>
third phase, since the supplied gas is first directed<br>
through the cooler 71.<br>
During the fourth and final phase which is represented in<br>
20 figure 28, the entire output of compressed gas is directed<br>
via the connecting line 74 and the main pipe 67 through<br>
the cooler 71.<br>
Next, the gas flows through the cut-off valves in the<br>
25 branches 65 and 66 to the pressure vessels 42 and 4 3, to<br>
then flow via the branches 48 and 4 9 and the bypass 58<br>
to the connecting line 72 and the take-off point 26.<br><br>

Such an embodiment of device 1 for drying a compressed<br>
gas in a non-dissipative manner with three pressure<br>
vessels 41, 42 and 43 has more cut-off valves 20 than the<br>
above-described embodiments, but the layout appears to be<br>
5 considerably simpler than the existing ones with three<br>
pressure vessels, such that this device 1 can be realised<br>
in a relatively cheap manner.<br>
It is clear that in all the embodiments of a device 1<br>
according to the invention, the cut-off valves may be<br>
10 electrically controllable, but they can also be<br>
controlled in other ways, such as for example in a<br>
pneumatic manner or the like, or they can even be<br>
manually controllable.<br>
The present invention is by no means limited to the<br>
15 embodiments described as an example and represented in the<br>
accompanying drawings; on the contrary, such a device 1<br>
according to the invention for drying a compressed gas<br>
in a non-dissipative manner can be made in all sorts of<br>
shapes and dimensions while still remaining within the<br>
20 scope of the invention.<br><br>
