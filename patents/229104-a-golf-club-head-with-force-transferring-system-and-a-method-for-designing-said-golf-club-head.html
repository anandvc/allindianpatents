GOLF CLUB HEAD WiTH FOReE TRANSFER SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field and Background Art<br>
The present invention relates to golf club heads and, more particularly, to the design of golf club heads.<br>
In general, golf club heads are designed as either solid bodies (for example, persimmons), beams (for example, irons and putters with perimeter weights), or shells with a diaphragm face (for example, metal drivers and fairway woods). Today, the general consensus is that a shell with a diaphragm face provides the optimal design solution for a : golf club head, with incremental improvements on that design helping to improve how far and how accurately a golfer can hit the golf ball.<br>
For example, as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 6,348,015, the face of a "shell" golf club head is designed from a material having a natural frequency between 2800 Hz and 4500 Hz. Upon hitting the material, the golf ball undergoes smaller deformations and, hence, lower energy losses. Or, as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 6,348,013, a "shell" golf club head is designed with one or more recesses in one or more of the head's walls. The recesses increase the amount of time the face of the head remains in contact with the ball, again reducing energy loss.<br>
Similarly, in U.S. Patent No. 6,267,691, the face of a "shell" golf club is reinforced with parallel ribs along the back side of the face, controlling how the face bends under impact load. The ribs help resist bending of the face in a direction parallel to the ribs, but permit bending of the face in a direction perpendicular to the ribs. The reinforcing ribs help dampen the head's vibrations and give the face a larger region in which there is an efficient transfer of energy from the face to the ball (known as the "sweet spot").<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a golf club head comprises a face, the face having a first side edge sod a second side edge and a rear structure, the rear structure<br><br>
connected to the face. The golf club head also includes an inertial support system, the inertial support system connected to the face via the first side edge and the second side edge of the face and a force transfer system located behind the face, the force transfer system under impact load elongating the rear structure and controlling, in cooperation with the inertial support system, the bending of the face, the pattern of bending of the face being substantially the same along a substantially vertical line running the height of the face.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the force transfer system, in cooperation with the inertial support system and the rear structure, controls the bending of the face, the pattern of bending of the face being substantially the same along a substantially vertical line running the height of the face. In another further embodiment of the invention, during an off-center impact load, a part of the face moves forward relative to the inertial support system.<br>
In still further embodiments of the invention, the face further comprises a first side portion that flexes under impact load, the first side portion connected to the first side edge of the face. The face may also further comprise a second side portion that flexes under impact load, the second side portion connected to the second side edge of the face.<br>
In alternate embodiments of the invention, the connections between the inertial support system and the side edges of the deformable portion of the face may be line connections. Hie line connections may be parallel. In addition, the inertial support system may include a hosel, and the mass of the inertial support system may be at least equal to the combined mass of the face, the force transfer system and die rear structure. Also, the inertial support system, the force transfer system, the face, or the rear structure may each be an integral unit, or some combination of the inertial support system, the force transfer system, the face or the rear structure may be an integral unit<br>
In further embodiments of the invention, the force transfer system may be the crown of the golf club head, the sole of the golf club head, or a combination of the crown and sole of the golf club head. Or, a part of the force transfer system may be the crown of the golf club head, the sole of the golf club head, or a combination of the crown and sole of the golf club head. In addition, the golf club head may include a conventional crown or a conventional sole. The conventional crown or conventional sole may be composed of a thennoset elastomer, a thermoplastic elastomer, or an engineering plastic. Also, the conventional crown or conventional sole may be transparent (in whole or in part) or<br><br>
translucent (in whole or in part).<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a golf club head comprises a face and a substantially non-deforming mass connected to the face. Under impact load, the contact forces from the impact load, in connection with the resulting inertial reaction forces from the substantially non-deforming mass produce a pattern of bending of the face that is substantially the same along a substantially vertical line running the height of the face.<br>
In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, a golf club head comprises a face, the face having a first side edge and a second side edge, and a rear structure, the rear structure connected to the face. In addition, the golf club head comprises an inertial support system, the inertial support system connected to the face via the first side edge and the second side edge of the face and a force transfer system located behind the face, at least a part of the force transfer system may be placed in a state of substantially pure axial compression under impact load.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the rear structure may be placed in a state of substantially pure axial tension under impact load.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a golf club head designed to act under impact load as a bridge comprises a face, the face acting as a bridge span; a force transfer system located behind the face, a rear structure located behind the force transfer system, the force transfer system and the rear structure acting together as a bridge truss, and an inertial support system connected to the face, the inertial support system acting as a bridge support.<br>

Figure 5a is a schematic top view, and Figure 5b is a sectional view, of a further still exemplary embodiment of a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as a bridge.<br>
Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a golf club head is designed to act as a "bridge" when the golf club head impacts a golf ball during game play (referred to hereinafter as "under impact load"). In general, the face of the golf club head corresponds to the bridge span, with the bridge truss and the bridge inertial supports located behind the face. As such, the bridge-like golf club head designs described herein are minimum weight structures that are inertially-supported under dynamic loading.<br>
In general, a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as a bridge may have a sweet spot that extends across the height of the face of the golf club head and a center of mass that may be closer to the face of the golf club head. Hie bridge truss, located behind the face, may be tailored to a provide a particular rate of deflection under impact load, and the bridge inertial supports may be tailored to provide a particular moment of inertia. Furthermore, the mass of the golf club head needed to support the impact load may be less than the mass needed in a "shell" golf club head. This leaves more mass available to optimize the inertial performance of the golf chib head.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic of an exemplary embodiment of a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as a bridge. In golf club head 100, face 110 is connected to inertial support system 120 and force transfer system 130. In turn, rear structure 140 is connected to force transfer system 130 and face 110. Force transfer system 130 comprises two component parts, inner structure 130a and radial structure 130b.~<br>
For ease of reference, the term "connection" is used herein to refer to physical connections between structures, as well as operational connections between structures. For example, the statement that structure A is connected to structure B may mean: (1) structure A is physically attached to structure B; (2) structure A interacts with structure B under<br><br>
operational conditions; or (3) structure A is physically attached to structure B and susctnre A interacts with structure B under operational conditions.<br>
Inertial support system 120, connected to the left side edge and right side edge of face 110, provides support for the "bridge structure" of golf club head 100. The bridge structure is that part of golf club head 100 required to support the impact load of a golf ball—face 110, force transfer system 130 and rear structure 140. Under impact load, the bridge structure transfers the load to inertial support system 120.<br>
Under an off-center impact load, inertial support system 120 also opposes the "rotation" of golf club head 100 resulting from the off-center impact load. For example, when a golf club head hits a golf ball somewhere between the center of the face and the toe of the golf club head, the golf club head will rotate about a vertical axis. In turn, the golf ball will travel in an unintended direction. With opposition, such as that provided with inertial support system 120, the rotation of the golf club head is reduced. In other words, inertial support system 120 produces high moments of inertia for golf club head 100.<br>
In general, under impact load, force transfer system 130, in connection with inertial support system 120, elongates rear structure 140, controls the "bending" of face 110 (and thus the deflection of face 110), and controls the rate of deflection of face 110. For example, force transfer system 130 and inertial support system 120 may control the rate of deflection of face 110 at the same rate of deflection of a golf ball hit at a particular swing velocity, thereby achieving a good dynamic response match between face 110 and the golf ball. In golfer parlance, a good dynamic response match means a good driving distance for the golf balL hi an alternate embodiment of golf club bead 100, rear structure 140 may also, in connection with force transfer system 130 and inertial support system 120, control the bending of face 110 and control the rate of deflection of face 110.<br>
Specifically, under an on-center impact load, radial structure 130b is placed in a state of substantially pure axial compression (a "push" along the length of a structure) and rear structure 140 is placed in a state of substantially pure axial tension (a "pull" along the length of a structure). In that a structure "bends" from forces acting perpendicular, rather than parallel, to the length of the structure, radial structure 130b and rear structure 140 exhibit minimal bending under an on-center impact load.<br><br>
In contrast, and under all impact loads, face 110 bends under the impact. Hie pattern of bending differs, however, from the pattern of bending seen in the face of a "dmmn golf club head. In a drum golf club head, also referred to herein as a shell golf club head, the pattern of bending of the face as measured along a vertical line (in relation to the horizon) from the top edge of the face to the bottom edge of the face is not uniform. In other words, along a vertical line a1 to a10, the rearward deflection of a1 may not equal the rearward deflection of a2, the rearward deflection of a2 may not equal the rearward deflection of a3, the rearward deflection of a3 may not equal the rearward deflection of a4, etc. The reason for the non-uniform bending is inherent in the drum golf club head's design, which requires rigid connections of the face along its top, bottom and side edges.<br>
In golf club head 100, the pattern of bending of face 110 is substantially uniform from the top edge of the face to the bottom edge of the face, as measured along a vertical line (in relation to the horizon) (hereinafter referred to as "bridge-like pattern of bending"). In other words, along a vertical line b1 to b10, the rearward deflection of b1 is substantially equal to the rearward deflection of b2, the rearward deflection of b2 is substantially equal to the rearward deflection of b3, the rearward deflection of b3 is substantially equal to the rearward deflection of b4, etc. In other words, in comparison to a drum golf club head, which has a sweet "spot" (defined as a single point on the face of the drum golf club head), face 110 has a sweet 4£lineM (defined as a series of points on face 110 of golf club head 100). The "sweet" region on the face of a golf club head is, in part, the region where there is an efficient transfer of energy from the face of the golf club head to the golf ball.<br>
As discussed, under an off-center impact load, face 110 bends with the bridge-like pattern of bending. In addition, during an off-center impact load, a part of face 110 moves forward relative to inertial support system 120. Typically, die part of face 110 that moves forward relative to inertial support system 120 is opposite to the side of face 110 impacted by the golf ball. It is believed that the forward movement of face 110 under an off-center impact load accounts for one of the great characteristics of a bridge-like golf club head—the ability to drive the golf ball in its intended direction even though the golfer hit the golf ball off the center line of face 110.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of golf club head 100, face 110 includes a "hinged" portion (or portions) that flexes, acting as a hinge. The hinged portion, typically located to<br><br>
the right side edge or left side edge of face 110, flexes under impact load. In other words, the hinged portion of face 110 rotates about the connection of face 110 and inertial support system 120.<br>
In a further alternate embodiment of golf club head 100, the mass of inertial support system 120 is greater than, or equal to, the combined mass of face 110, force transfer system 130 and rear structure 140. Thus, in this alternate embodiment of golf club head 100, at least 50% of the mass of golf club head 100 may be used to achieve the highest moment of inertia around a vertical axis of golf club head 100.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic of another exemplary embodiment of a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as a bridge. In golf club head 200, force transfer system 230 comprises three radial structures, notated as 230b, rather than one radial structure. Under impact load, radial structures 230b react in the same manner as radial structure 130b. In other words, under an on-center impact load, radial structures 230b are each placed in a state of substantially pure axial compression, exhibiting minimal bending. While the disclosed exemplary embodiments describe a force transfer system with either one radial structure or three radial structures, the force transfer system may comprise any number of radial structures. For example, the force transfer system may appear to the naked eye to be a "solid" structure but, on a microscopic level, is comprised of some number of radial structures.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic of still another exemplary embodiment of a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as abridge. In golf club head 300, face 310 is connected to inertial support system 320, force transfer system 330, and back 350. In turn, rear structure 340 is connected to force transfer system 330 and face 310. Force transfer system 330 comprises two component parts, inner structure 330a and radial structure 330b.<br>
However, unlike the inertial support systems for golf club head 100 and 200, the inertial support system for golf club head 300 is a set of posts. Under impact load, inertial support system 320 reacts in the same manner as inertial support systems 120 and 220— providing support for the bridge structure of golf club head 300, receiving the load during impact and, under off-center impact loads, opposing rotation of golf club head 300.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of golf club head 300, inertial support system 320 is comprised of a set of posts connected with one or more bars. The bars may connect the posts<br><br>
along any point, or points, on the posts. For example, the bars may connect just the top of the posts, just the bottom of the posts, just the center of the posts, or both the top and the bottom of the posts.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic of a still further exemplary embodiment of a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as a bridge. In golf club head 400, face 410 is connected to inertial support system 420 (which includes hosel 450) and is connected to force transfer system 430. In turn, rear structure 440 is connected to force transfer system 430 and face 410. In this exemplary golf club head, the connection between face 410 and inertial support system 420 is two line connections. A line connection is a connection between two structures along a single set of points substantially forming a line. Force transfer system 430 comprises three component parts, inner structure 430a and radial structures 430b.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, inertial support system 420 is a set of posts, notated as 420a, connected with a curved bar, notated as 420b. Inertial support system 420 may straddle radial structures 430b, may rest on top of radial structures 430b, or may rest within radial structures 430b. Under impact load, inertial support system 420 reacts in the same manner as inertial support systems 120, 220 and 320—providing support for the bridge structure of golf club head 400, receiving the load during impact and, under off-center impact loads, opposing rotation of golf club head 400.<br>
Figures 5a and 5b are schematics of a further still exemplary embodiment of a golf club head designed to act, under impact load, as a bridge. In golf club head 500, face 510 connects to inertial support system 520 and force transfer system 530. In turn, rear structure 540 is connected to force transfer system 530 and face 510.<br>
Unlike force transfer systems 130,230,330 and 430, force transfer system 530 comprises the crown of golf club bead 500. In particular, force transfer system 530 is a crown of varying thickness that acts as part of the bridge structure. For example, as shown in Figure 5b, force transfer system 530 may have a single region, in which the thickness varies frcfta the front of the region to the back of the region. Or, force transfer system 530 may have more than one region, in which the thickness of each region varies in the same manner or in different manners. For example, in each region the thickness may vary from the front of each region to fee back of each region. Or, in a first region, the thickness may vary from the front erf" that region to the back of that region, in a second region, the thickness may vary from the<br><br>
center of that region to the edges of that region, etc. Under impact load, force transfer system 530 produces the same effect produced in force transfer systems 130,230,330 and 430—that is, in connection with inertial support system 520 (or, in an alternate embodiment, in connection with inertial support system 520 and rear structure 540), elongating rear structure 540, controlling the bending of face 510 (and thus the deflection of face 110), and controlling the rate of deflection of face 110.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of golf club head 500, force transfer system 530 comprises the sole of golf club head 500. In another alternate embodiment of golf club head 500, force transfer system 530 comprises both the crown and the sole of golf club head 500.<br>
In another alternate embodiment of golf club head 500, force transfer system 530 may comprise a part of the crown of golf club head 500, the remaining part of force transfer system configured in a manner similar to the force transfer systems shown in Figures 1-4. Or, force transfer system 530 may comprise a part of the sole of golf club head 500, the remaining part of force transfer system configured in a manner similar to the force transfer systems shown in Figures 1-4. Likewise, force transfer system 530 may comprise a part of the crown and a part of the sole of golf club head 500, the remaining part of force transfer system configured in a manner similar to the force transfer systems shown in Figures 1-4.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of each of the exemplary embodiments of golf club heads, the golf club heads may further include a back, such as back 350 in golf club head 300. Or, in further alternative embodiments of each of the golf club heads, the back of the golf club head may be the rear structure or the inertial support system.<br>
In another alternate embodiment of each of the exemplary embodiments of golf club heads, the inertial support system further includes a hosel, such as hosel 450 in golf club head 400. Ahoselis a connection point on a golf club head to which agolf club shaft is attached.<br>
In still another embodiment of each of the exemplary embodiments of golf club heads, the face, the inertial support system, the force transfer system, and the rear structure may be integral units alone or in combination with each other. For example, the face and the force transfer system may be an integral unit, the inertial support system may be an integral unit, or the face, the force transfer system and the rear structure may be an integral unit<br><br>
In a further embodiment of each of the exemplary embodiments of golf club heads, the golf club head may further include a conventional crown, a conventional sole, or a conventional crown and a conventional sole. The term "conventional" is used herein to differentiate from the "crown of varying thickness" described in Figure 5. In order to ensure that a conventional crown or conventional sole do not negatively impact the bridge-like operation of the golf club heads described herein, the conventional crown or conventional sole may be composed of a thermoset elastomer, a thermoplastic elastomer, or an engineering resin. In addition, the conventional crown or conventional sole may be transparent (in whole or in part) or translucent (in whole or in part).<br>
Although various exemplary embodiments of the invention have been disclosed, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made which will achieve some of the advantages of the invention without departing from the true scope of the invention.

11.	The golf club head according to claim 1 in which the mass of the inertial support system is at least equal to the combined mass of the face, the force transfer system, and the rear structure.<br>
12.	A golf club head designed to act under impact load as a bridge, comprising:<br>
a face, the face acting as a bridge span;<br>
a force transfer system located behind the face;<br>
a rear structure located behind the force transfer system, the force transfer system and the rear structure acting together as a bridge truss; and<br>
an inertial support system connected to the face, the inertial support system acting as a bridge support.<br>
13.	The golf club head according to claim 12, the face further comprising:<br>
a first side portion that flexes under impact load, the first side portion connected to a first side edge of the face.<br><br>
14.	The golf club head according to claim 13, the face further comprising:<br>
a second side portion that flexes under impact load, the second side portion<br>
connected to a second side edge of the face.<br>
15.	The golf club head according to claim 12 in which the connections between<br>
the face and the inertial support system are substantially line connections.<br>
16.	The golf club head according to claim 15 in which the line connections are parallel.<br>
17.	The golf club head according to claim 12 in which the mass of the inertial support system is at least equal to the combined mass of the face, the force transfer system, and the inertial support system.<br>
18.	A method for designing a golf club head, comprising:<br>
configuring a force transfer system and a rear structure and tuning the stiffness of the force transfer system and the rear structure to obtain, during impact with a golf ball, a desired deformation of the force transfer system and the rear structure, the deformation reducing the stress developed in the face; and<br>
the combination of the deformation of the face and the deformation of the force transfer system and the rear structure resulting in a compliant club head with the compliance occurring over a substantial portion of the face.<br>
19.	The method according to claim 18 in which the compliance is sufficient to reduce the impact force between the face and the ball.<br>
20.	The method according to claim 18 in which the compliance for an on-center impact is substantially the same as the compliance for an off-center impact.<br>
21.	The method according to claim 18 in which a substantial portion of the face<br><br>
comprises at least approximately 25% of the face.<br>
22. The method according to claim 18, farther comprising: distributing the discretionary mass of the inertial support system to obtain a desired moment of inertia and a desired center of mass location.<br><br></td>
