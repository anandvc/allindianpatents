METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING PARTICLES USING<br>
SPRAY ORYER AND IN-LINE JET MILL<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
5                This invention is generally in the field of process equipment and methods for<br>
making particles, and more particularly to meihods of deagglomerating or grinding<br>
spray dried particles.<br>
Spray drying is commonly used in the production of particles for many<br>
applications, including Pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, fertilizers, dyes, and<br>
10     abrasives. Spray drying can be tailored to create a wide spectrum of particle sizes,<br>
including microparticles. Spray dried particles are useful is in variety of biomedical and<br>
pharmaceutical apphcation, such as the deliver of therapeutic and diagnostic agents,<br>
as described for example in U.S. Patent No. 5,853,698  to Straub et al.; U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,855,913 to Hanes et al.; and U.S, Patent No, 5,622,657 to Takada et al. For these<br>
15     applications: microparticles having very specific sizes and size ranges often are needed<br>
in order to effectively deliver the active agents.<br>
particles may tend in agglomerate during their production and processing,<br>
therehy undesirably astrering the effective size of the particles, to the detriment or the<br>
particle formulation's perfomance and/or reproducibility- In other circumstances, the<br>
20     particles made may simply be larger than desired for a particular application<br>
Therefore, after they are produced, particles may require additional processing for size<br>
reduction and/or deagglomeration.<br>
In one common appmach, sepsrate bstch process steps are ussed, For example,<br>
particles are made by a known sptay drying process, collected, and then ground in a<br>
25     second, separate step. Such a batch method, however, undesirably requires the use of a<br>
tranafer step from the spray dryer to the mill, which, for an aseptic process, mey be<br>
difficult to perform. Such a batch process also requires two separate collection steps<br>
that are both associated with a yield loss. It would be desirable to provide a sterile<br>
particle production and milling process and to mimimize product yield losses, reduce<br>
30     material transfer steps, reduce process time, and reduce production costs, In addition,<br>
laboratory scale methods for producing microparticle pharmaceutical formulations may<br>
require several steps, which may not be readily or efficiently ttansferred to larger scale<br>
production, It would be desirable for the microparticle production and deagglomeration<br>

and (c) flowing the particles of the feedstream through a jet mill to deagglomerate or<br>
grind the particles. This process using spray drying coupled with "in-line" jet miliing<br>
15      eliminates an aseptic transfer from the spray dryer to the jet mill (which would be<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Process systems and methods have been developed for making particles, such as<br>
10     nricroparticles, by sptay drying and then deagglomerating or grinding the particles using<br>
an in-line jet mill. By coupling spray drying with "in-line" jet milling, a single step<br>
process is created from two separate unit operations, and an additional collection step is<br>
eliminated, which otherwise would be associated with a yield loss and possible aseptic<br>
transfer which would be undesirable for pharmaceutical production. The one-step, in-_<br>
15     line process has further advantages in time and cost of processing. In an optional<br>
embodiment, the systems also provide in-line blending of an excipient material with the<br>
particles.<br>
The jet miliing step beneficially lowers residual moisture and solvent levels in<br>
the particles, leading to better stability and handling properties for dry powder<br>
20     pharna ceutical formulalions or other dry powder froms comprising the partitles.<br>
As used hertin, the tenn "in-line" refers to process equipment in fluid<br>
comniunication arranged and adapted to process the materials in a continuous,<br>
sequential manner. That is, the particles being processed flow between and throtigh the<br>
individual pieces of equipment, without an intervening collection step.<br>
25                 In a preferred embodiment the particles are microparticles.<br>
In a preferred method, the microparticles comprise one or more pharmaceutical<br>
agents. In one embodiment, the microparticle is formed entirely of a pharmaceutical<br>
agent In another embodiment, the microparticle has a core of pharmaceutical agent<br>
encapsulated in a shell In yet another embodment, the pharmateutical agent is<br>
30     interspersed within, the shell or matrix. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical<br>
agent is uniformly mixed within the material comprising the shell or matrix.<br>
Optionally, the microparticles of any of these embodiments can be blended with one or<br>
more excipients.<br>

1. In-Line Methods and Apparatus making Particles<br>
The methods include (a) spraying an emulsion, solution, or suspension, which<br>
5     comprises a solvent and a bulk material, through one or more atomizers and into a<br>
primaiy drying chamber having a drying gas inlet, a discharge outlet, and a dicing gas<br>
flowing therethrough, to form droplets comprising the solvent and the bulk material,<br>
wherein, the droplets are dispersed in the drying gas; (b) evaporating, in the primary<br>
drying chamber, at least a portion of the solvent into the drying gas to solidify the<br>
10     droplets and form particles dispmed in the drying gas, the particles dispersed in the<br>
drying gas being a feedstream; and (c) flowing the particles and at least a portion of the<br>
drying gas of the feedstream through jet null to deagglomerate or grind the particles,<br>
in a preferred embodiment, step (c) is conducted to deagglomerate at least a, portion of<br>
agglomerated particles, if any, while substantially maintaining the size and morphology<br>
35     of the indiyidual particles, Alternatively, step (c) is conducted to grind the particles.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the feedstream of step (b) is directed through a<br>
particle concentration means to separate and remove at least a portion of the drying gas<br>
from the feedstream. This provides a concentration of solids in the dispersion entering<br>
the jet mill that is high enough to permit the jet mill to operate effectively as intended,<br>
20     i.e., to deagglomerate or grind the particles.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, which can ne used with or without the particle<br>
concentration means, the apparatus includes one or more secondary drying chambers<br>
intoposed between, and in fluid communication, with, the discharge outlet of the<br>
primary drying chamber and the inlet of the jet mill. These secondary drying chambers<br>
25     provide additional drying of the particles, that is, they provide time and volume for<br>
evaporation of a second portion of the solvent into the drying gas.<br>
In yet another embodiment, which can be used with or without the particle<br>
concentration means and with or without the secondary drying chambers, the apparatus<br>
includes a means for introducing another material into the particles and drying-gas<br>
30     flowing batwecn the discharge outlet of the primary drying chamber and the inlet of the<br>
jet mill. In one embodiment, this other material could be an excipient, a second<br>
pharmaceutical agent, or a combination thereof. For example, a diy powder beta<br>
agonist could be introduced into a fead stream from a spray dryer that is pruducing<br>

microparticles containing a corticosteroid This apparatus can be used, for example, to<br>
make a dry powder blend in a single step, i.e., without an intermediate collection step<br>
between spray drying and jet milling.<br>
FIG- 1 illustrates one example of an in-line system, or apparatus, 10 for making<br>
5     and jet-milling particles. A liquid feed (i.e,, an emulsion, solution, or suspension,<br>
which comprises a solvent and a bulk material) and an atomization gas (e.g,, air,<br>
nitrogen, etc.) are fed through an atomizer 14. The atomized droplets of solvent and<br>
bulk material are formed in the primary drying chamber 12. A drying gas is fed through<br>
an optional neater 18 and into a primary drying chamber 12. In the primary drying<br>
10     chamber, the droplets are dispersed in the drying gas, and at least a portion of the<br>
solvenl is evaporated into the drying gas to solidify the droplets and form a feed a<br>
feedstream of particles dispersed in the drying gas. This feedstream then exits the<br>
primary drying chamber 12 through outlet 16 and enters (optional) secondary drying<br>
apparatus 20, which includes a coiled tube through which the feedstream flows. Upon<br>
15      exiting the secondary drying apparatus 20, the dispersion enters the cyclone separator<br>
22, which serves to concentrate the particles. A portion of the drying gas is separated<br>
from the feedstream and exits the top vent 23 of the cyclone separator 22. The<br>
concentrated particles/drying gas then, exits the cyclone separator 22 and flows into a jet<br>
mill 24. A grinding gas (e,g., dry nitrogen) also is supplied to the jet mill 24. The jet<br>
20     mill 24 deagglomerates or grinds lie particles, depending, in part, on the operating<br>
parameters selected for the jet mill, The jet-milled particles dispersed in drying gas<br>
(and grinding gas) then flow from the jet mill 24 to a collection cyclone 26. The jet-<br>
entiled particles are collected in collection jar 28 or other suitable apparatus, and the<br>
drying and grinding gases are exhausted from the system 10, The exhaust gas from the<br>
25     cyclones 22 and 26 typically is filtered (filters not shown) before release from the<br>
system and/or into the atmosphere.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates one example of an in-line system, or apparatus, 40 for making<br>
particle blends. In the embodiment shown, particles are made by spray drying, directly<br>
blended with an excipient using an in-line excipient feed device, and then the resulting<br>
30     bleod is Jet-miilled using an in-line jet mill, to yield a highly uniform particle blead.<br>
The process is like that shown in FIG. 1, except an excipient material (or<br>
pharmaceutical material or combination thereof) is added to the particles/drying gas,<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br><br>
after, or more preferably before, the particles/drying gas flows through cyclone<br>
separator 22. The resulting mixture of particles, excipient material, and drying gas then<br>
flows into jet mill 24, where the mixture is deagglomerated or ground. The jet-milled<br>
paricle/excipient blend dispersed in drying gas then flows from the jet mill 24 to a<br>
5     collection cyclone 26 and collected in collection jar 28. The drying gas and grinding<br>
gas are exhausted from system 40, as described above.<br>
Preferably, the methods and systems are adapted for making pharmaceutical<br>
formulations comprising microperticles, Ths microparticles are made by spray drying,<br>
and the jet milling is effective to deagglomerate or grind the microparticles. The jet-<br>
10     milling step can advantageously reduce moisture content and residual solvent levels in<br>
the formulation through the addition of dry and solvent free gas directly to the jet mill<br>
(e.g., as grinding gas). The jet-milling step also can improve the suspendability and<br>
wettabillty of the dry powder formulation (e.g., for better injectability) and give the dry<br>
powder formulation improved aerodynamic properties (e.g., for better pulmonary<br>
15     delivery).<br>
The use of a of a spray dryer wilh an in-line jet mill, as opposed to a two-step<br>
process of a spray drying followed by a separate jet milling process, advantageously<br>
improves yield, reduces time, and reduces cost.<br>
Spray Drying<br>
20                 The particles are formed by a spray drying technique known in the art For<br>
example, the particles can be produced using the spray drying methods and devices<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,853,698 to Straub et al, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,611,344 to Bernstein et al., U.S. Patent No, 6,395,300 to Straub et al., and U.S. Patent<br>
No, 6,223,455 to Chickering III, et al.<br>
25                  As used herein (in the examples), the symbol "XXX" is used to indicate the term<br>
"diameter" for the object being described.<br>
As used herein, the term "solvent" refers to the liquid in which the material<br>
forming the bulk of the spray dried particle is dissolved, suspended, or emulsified for<br>
delivery to the atomizer of a spray dryer and which is evaporated into the drying gas,<br>
30      whether or not the liquid is a solvent or nonsolvent for the material. Other volatilizable<br>
components, such as a volatile salt, may be included in the bulk material/liquid, and<br>
volatilised into the drying gas.<br>

WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
In one embodiment, imcropaticles are produced by dissolving a pharmaceutical<br>
agent and/or shell material in an appropriate solvent, (and optionally dispensing a solid<br>
or liquid active agent, pore forming agent (e,g., a volatile salt), or other additive into the<br>
solution containing the pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material) and then spray<br>
5     drying the solution, to from microparticles. As defined herein, the process of "spray<br>
drying" a solution containing a pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material refers to a<br>
process wherein the solution is atomized, to form a mist and dried by direct contact with<br>
carrier gases. Using spray drying equipment available in the art, the solution contxining<br>
the pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material-may "be atomized into a drying chamber,<br>
10     dried within the chamber, and then collected via a cyclone at the outlet of the chamber.<br>
Representative examples of types of suitable atomization devices include ultrasonic,<br>
pleasure feed, air atomizing, and totaling disk- The temperature may be varied<br>
defending on the solvent or materials used. The temperature of the infer. and outlet<br>
parts can be controlled to produce the desired products. Multiple nozzles (or other<br>
15     atomization devices) can be used to allow for introduction of multiple emulsions,<br>
solutions, suspensions, or combinations thereof into the primary drying chamber. The<br>
multiple nozzles can be used, for example, to introduce materials that comprise a<br>
pharmaceutical agent, an excipient, or combinations thereof, In one embodiment, the<br>
multiple nozzles are used to spray the same materil (from each noazle) in order<br>
20     increase process throughput of the material. In another embodiment, the multiple<br>
nozzles are used to spray different materials (e.g., different materials from each noazle),<br>
for example, in order to create dry powders that are mixtures of different particles, e.g.,<br>
composed of different materials,<br>
The size of fhe particulates of pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material is a<br>
25     function of the nozzle used to spray the solution of the pharmaceutical agent and/or<br>
shell material, nozzle pressure, the solution and atomization flaw rates, the<br>
pharmaceutical agent amd/or shell material used, the concentration, of the<br>
pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material, the type of solvent, the temperature of<br>
spraying (both inlet and outlet temperature), and the molecular weight of a shell<br>
30     material such as a polymer or other matrix material. Generally, if a polymer is used the<br>
higher the molecular weight, the larger the particle size, assuming the concentration is<br>
the same (because an increase in molecular weight generally increases the solution<br>
viscosity). Particles having a target diameter between 0.5 um and 500 um can be<br>

WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
obtained. The morphology of these wicropaticles depends, for-example, on the<br>
selection of shell material, concentration, molecular weight of a shell material such as a<br>
polymer or other matrix material, spray flow, and drying oonditions.<br>
In an optional embodiment, the apparatus further includes one or more<br>
5      secondary drying chambers downstream from the primary drying chamber to provide<br>
additional solvent removal. In one embodiment, the secondary drying chamber<br>
comprises the drying apparatus described in U.S. Patent No. 6,308,434 and U,S. Patent<br>
No. 6,223,455. The secondary drying chamberpreferabry comprises fubing having an<br>
inlet in fluid communication with the discharge outlet of the primary drying chamber, to<br>
10     evaporole a second portion of the solvent into the drying gas, wherein the ratio of the<br>
cross -sectional area of the primary drying chamber to the cross-sectional area of the<br>
tubing is at least 4:3, and wberein the ratio of the length of the tubing to the length of<br>
the primary drying chamber is at least 2:1.<br>
Particle Concentration Means and Process Control<br>
15                The paiticle concentration means can be essentially auy device suitable for<br>
conentrating the particles in the drying gas such that the particles can be effectively jet<br>
milled, whether for grinding or deaggiometation. Representative devices for<br>
concentrating  the particles in the drying gas include cyclone separators, gravity settling<br>
chambers (knock-out pots), electrostatic charge precipitators, impingement separators,<br>
20     mecharical centiifugal separators and uniflow cyclones.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the particle concentration means includes at least<br>
one cyclone separator as known in the art, to separate and remove at least a portion of<br>
the drying gas from said particles, In a typical embodiment, the cyclone separator<br>
consists of a vertical cylinder with a conical bottom. The particlc/dfying gas dispersion<br>
25     enters the cyclone through a tangential inlet near the top, entering in a vortical motion.<br>
The centrifugal force created, causes the panicles to be thrown toward the wall, and the<br>
drying gas folls downward along the wall and then spirals upward through the center<br>
when it reaches the bottom, producing a double vortex. The particles fall by gravity to<br>
the bottom of the device. One skilled in the art can select the appropriate dimensions of<br>
30     the separator based, for example, on the flow rates of gas and particles, percentage of<br>
gas to be separated, system pressures, particle mass and size, etc.<br>
For a particular system, successful operation requires balancing of the flows and<br>
pressures in the process -equipment, such that jet mill performance is maximized,<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
particle blowhack from the jet mill is avoided, and clogging of the cyclone and/or jet<br>
mill is avoided. For example, as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG- 2, control of the flow<br>
through the system 10 or system 40 can be performed with the use of a control valve 30<br>
downstream from the collection eyelone 26 and/or a control valve 32 downstream from<br>
5     the separator cyclone 22, eithe  or both of which can be used to conrol the pressure on<br>
the systems. For example, by increasing the backpressure on the system, more drying<br>
gas can be separated and expelled through the top vent of the cyclone separator.<br>
Altermatively, less drying gas can be directed through the top vent of the cyclone<br>
separator by lowering the backpressure on the system. Alternatively, the drying gas<br>
10     exhusted through the cyclone separator can be in part or entirely redirected into the<br>
system downstream of the jet mill outlet Optionally, fresh gas can be added into the<br>
system downstream of the jet mill outlet. Such redirected or added gases can be used to<br>
balance pressures in the process.<br>
While a control valve is shown in FIGS-1 and 2, other flow controniug devices<br>
25     known in the art can be used to control the system pressure and/or flow rats of drying<br>
gas dischaiged from the particle concentration means or the collection cyclone. For<br>
example, the flow controlling devices could comprise a device selected from control<br>
valves, fillers, regulatore, orifices, and combinations thereef.<br>
In one embodiment, the solids content of the feedstream (particles/drying gas)<br>
20     from the primary and secondary drying chambers is increased by separating aut between<br>
about 50 and 100 vol.%, more preferably about 90 and 100 vol,%, of the drying gas,<br>
which is expelled through top vent 23. For example, in one embodiment, the flow rate<br>
of the particles/drying gas from the apray dryer is52CFM (1500 L/min.) and the flow<br>
rate of the particles/drying gas to the jet mill is 0.52 CFM (15 L/nim ). The system<br>
25     components would be sized to maintain the appropriate gas velocity throughout the<br>
process.<br>
Jet Milling<br>
As used herein, the terms "jet nill" and "jet milling" include and refer to the use<br>
of any type of fluid energy impact mills, including spiral jet mills, loop jet milk,<br>
30     hammer mills, grinders, crushers, and fludized bed jet mills, with or without internal<br>
air classifiers. These mills are known in the art. The jet mill is used to deagglomerate<br>
or to grind the particles.<br>
As used herein, the term "deagglomerate" refers to the technique for<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
albstaotially degglomerating micmparticle agglomerates that have been produced<br>
during or subsequent to fomation of the microparticles, by bombarding the feed<br>
particles with high velocity air or other gss, typically in a spiral or circular flow. The<br>
jet milling process conditions can be selected so that the inucroparticles are substantially<br>
5      deagglomerated while substantially maintaining the size and morphology of the<br>
individual microparticles, which can be quantified as providing a volume average size<br>
reduction of at least 15% and a number average size reduction of no more than 75%.<br>
As used herein, the terms "grind", "ground", or "grinding" refers to particle size<br>
reduction by fracture, e.g., conventional milling. That is, the particles and/or<br>
10     agglomerates are induced in size without substantially maintaining the size and<br>
morphology of the individual microparticles. The process is characterized by the<br>
acceleration of particles in a gas stream to high velocities for impingement on other<br>
particles, similarty accelerafed, or impingement on the walls of the mill.<br>
A typical spiral jet mill 50 is illustrated in FIG. 3. Particles, with or without<br>
15      drying gas, are fed into feed chute 52. Optional injection gas is fed through one or<br>
more ports 56. The particles are forced through injector 54 into chamber 58. The<br>
particles enter an extremely rapid vortest in the chamber 58, where they collide with one<br>
another until snall enough to become sufficiently entrained in the gas stream, to exit a<br>
central discharge port 62 in the jet mill by the gas stream (against centrifugal forces<br>
20     experienced in the vortex). Grinding gas (so-named whether the jet mill is used for<br>
grinding or deagglomeration) is fed from port 60 into gas supply ring 61. The grinding<br>
gas then is fed into the chamber 58 via a plurality of apertines; only two 63a and 63b<br>
are shown. Gnouad or deagglomerated pertictes are discharged from the jet mill 50.<br>
The selection of the material forming the bulk of the particles and the<br>
25      temperature of the particles in the jet mill are among the factors that affect<br>
deagglomeration and grinding. Therefore, the jet mill optionally can be provided with a<br>
temperature control system For example, the control syston may liest the particles,<br>
rendering the material less brittle and thus less easily fraetured in the jet mill thereby<br>
manimizing unwanted, size reduction. Alternatively, the control system rnay need to<br>
30     cool the particles to below the glass transition or melting temperature of the material, so<br>
that deagglomeration is possible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the particles are aseptically fed to the jet mill, and a<br>
suitable gas, preferably dry nitrogen, is used to process the microparticks through the<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
mill. Grinding and mjection gas pressures can be adjusted as need, for example, based<br>
on the material characteristics. Preferably, these gas pressures are between 0 and 10<br>
bet, more preferably between 2 and E bar. Particle throughput depends on the size and<br>
capacity of the jet mill. The jet-milled particles can be collected by filtration or, more<br>
5     preferably, syclone,<br>
Jet milling the particles, in addition to providing the desired level of<br>
deagglomeration ot grinding, can also lower the residual solvent and moisture levels in<br>
the particles or particle blend while in process (i.e., before collection), due to the<br>
addition of dry and solvent free gas (e.g., as grinding gas, injection gas. or both)<br>
10     provided to the jet mill. To achieve reduced residual levels, the injection/grinding gas<br>
preferably is a low humidity gas, such as dry nitrogen, In one embodiment, the<br>
injection/grinding gas is at a temperature less than 100 oC (e.g., less than 75 °C, less<br>
than 50°C, less than 25 °C, etc.).<br>
Blending<br>
15                 In an optional embodiment, the process further includes blending the particles<br>
with another material (e.g., an excipient material, a (second) pharmaceutical agent or a<br>
combination thereof), which can be in a diy powder form. The blending can be<br>
performed before jet milling as an in-line process, after jet mil1ing, ot both before and<br>
after jet milling.<br>
20                 In a preferred embodiment, the blending is conductsd in a single step process,<br>
such as an in-line process, as shown for example in FIG. 2. This process comprises<br>
spray drying with in-line blending and in-line jet milling. The excipient material<br>
preferably is added to the feedstream before it flows into the jet mill. The excipient<br>
material can be introduced into the feedstream using essentially any suitable<br>
25     introduction means known in the ari. Non-Iimiting examples of such introduction<br>
means include screw or vibratory feed from a closed hopper, a venhin feed from a<br>
vented hopper, via a feedstream from one or more other spray drying units making the<br>
excipient particles, or via a feedstream trom one or more jet milling devices, One<br>
skilled in the art can readily conned a feed source line using standard techniques and<br>
30     provide the excipient feed material at a sufficient pressure to cause the material to flow<br>
into and combine with the drying gas and particles.<br>
In another embodiment, the excipient material is blended with the particles post-<br>
jet milling, in a batch or continuous process, including an in-line process. The blending<br>
.14<br><br>
WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
can be carried out using essentially any technique or device suitable for combining the<br>
microparticles with one or more other materials (e.g., excipients), preferably to achieve<br>
uniformity of blend.<br>
Content uniformity of solid-solid pharmaceutical blends is critical. Jet milling<br>
5     can be conducted on the micropaiticles before blending or as part of a single process<br>
(spray drying with in-line blending and in-line jet milling) to enhance content<br>
uniformity. Jet-milling advantageously can provide improved wetting and dispersibility<br>
upon reconstitution of fee blends, in addition, the resulting micropaiticle formulation<br>
can provide improved injectability, passing through the needle of a syringe more easily.<br>
10     Jet milling can provide improved dispersibility of the dry powder, which provides for<br>
improved aerodynamic properties for nasal or pulmonary administration.<br>
Other Steps in the Process<br>
The particles may undergo additional processing steps. Representative<br>
examples of such processes include Iyophilization or vacuum drying to further remove<br>
15     residual solvents, temperature conditioning to anneal materials, size classification to<br>
recover or remove certain fractions of the particles (i.e., to optimize the size<br>
distribution), compression molding to form a tablet or other geometry, and packaging.<br>
In one embodiment, oversized (e.g., 20 um or larger preferably 10 um or larger)<br>
microparticles are separated from the microparticles of interest Some formulations<br>
20     also may undergo sterilization, such as by gamma irradiation.<br>
IL The Partieles<br>
The particles made by the processes described herein comprise a bulk material.<br>
As used herein, the term "bulk material" includes essentially any material that can be<br>
provided in a solution, suspension, or emulsion, and then fed through, an atomizer and<br>
25      dried to form particles. In preferred embodiments, the bulk materiai is a pharmaceutical<br>
agent, a "shell material, or a combination of a pharmaceutical agent and a shell material,<br>
as described herein.<br>
Size and Morphology<br>
The particles made by the in-line spray drying and jet mill process can be of any<br>
30     size. As used herein, the term "particle" includes micro-, submicro-, and macro-<br>
particles. Generally, the particles ate between about 100 nm and 5 mm in diameter or<br>
in the longest dimension. In a preferred embodiment, the particles are microparticles,<br>
which are between 1 and 999 microns in diameter or in the longest dimension. As used<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/060547                                                                                                 PCT/US2003/037108<br>
herein, the term "microparticle" includes microspheres and mictocapsules, as well as<br>
microparticles, unless otherwise specified. Microparticles may or-may not be spheritical<br>
in shaps. Microcapsules are defined as microparticles having an outer shell<br>
sunotinding a core of another material, such as a pharmaceutical agent. The core can<br>
5     be gas, liquid, gel, or solid, Microspheres can be solid spheres or can be porous and<br>
include a sponge-like or honeycomb structure fonned by pores or yoids in a matrix<br>
material or shell.<br>
As used herein, the teams "size" or "diameter" in reference to particles refers to<br>
the number average particle size, unless otherwise specified. An example of an<br>
10     equation that can be used to describe the number average particlc size is shown below:<br><br>
where n = number of parucles of a given diameter (d).<br>
As used herein, the term "vohime average diameter" refers to the volume<br>
weighted diameter average. An example of equations that can be used to describe the<br>
15     volume average diameter is shown below:<br><br>
where n — number of particles of a given diameter (d).<br>
As used herein, the term "acrodynamic diameter" refets to the equivalent<br>
diameter of a sphere with density of 1 g/mL were it to fall under gravity with the same<br>
20     velocity as the particle analysed. Aerodynamic diameters can be determined on the dry<br>
powder using an Aerosizer (TSI), which is a time of flight technique, or by cascade<br>
impaction or liquid impinger techniques.<br>
Particle size analysis can be performed on a Coulter counter, by light<br>
microscopy, scaning electron microscopy, transmittance eletron microscopy, laser<br>
25     diffraction methods such as those using a Malvem Mastersizer, light scattering methods<br>
or time of flight methods. Where a Coulter method is described, the powder is<br>
dispersed in an electrolyte, and the resulting suspension analyzed using a Coulter<br>

Multisizer II fitted with a 50-um aperture tube,<br>
In one embodiment, the jet milling proccess described herein can deagglomerate<br>
agglomerated particles, such that the size and morphology of the individual particles is<br>
substantially maintained That is, a comparison of the particle size before and after jet<br>
5     milling should show a volume average size reduction of at least 15% and a number<br>
average size reduction of no more than 75%. It is believed that the jet milling processes<br>
will be most useful in deagglomerating particles having a volume average diameter or<br>
aerodynamic average diameter greater than about 2 um.<br>
In one embodiment, the particles are micioporticles comprising a<br>
10     pharmaceutical agent tor use in a pharmaceutical formulation. These mieroparticles<br>
preferably have a number average size between about 1 and 10 um . In one<br>
embodiment, the microparticles have a volume average size between) 2 and 50 um. In<br>
another embodiment, the inicroparticles have an aerodynamic diamater between. 1 and<br>
50 um.<br>
15                The pharmaceutical agent containing paitides typically are manufactured to<br>
have a size (i.e., diameter) suitable for the intended route of adminisitration. Particle<br>
size also can affect RES uptake. For intravascular administration, the particles<br>
preferably have a diameter of between 0,5 and 8 um, For subcutaneous or<br>
intramuscular administration, the particles preferably have a diameter of between about<br>
20      1 and 100 um. For oral administration for delivery to the gastrointestinal tract and for<br>
aplication to other lumens or inucosal surfaces (eg.., rectal, vaginal, buccal, or nasal),<br>
