				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for retting of fibres.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditional retting involves the rotting of fibres? such as  jute<br>
or kenaf in pools of water formed during the monsoons after which it has to be 'walked over' by farmers or farm labour. The entire process of retting takes about two or three weeks. It commences only after the monsoons arrive. Therefore, if the monsoons arrive late, three types of fibre is produced from the same plant because of over—aging. Due to the rotting process in bacteria infested water, the fibres become weak and farmers cannot produce a consistent quality of fibre from any one plant since the same bacteria infested water is used repeatedly. The method involves direct human contact with dirty, muddy and bacteria infested water in which rotting jute or kenaf remain immersed for a long time and this results in various diseases.<br>
No high—value derivatives can be obtained from such jute or kenaf, and the major portion of the lignin content of the jute or kenaf is lost in the pools of water and the balance remains in the fibre or stick, making them less resilient, incapable of being converted to other high value derivatives, and incapable of taking on permanent dye.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a  process<br>
1<br><br>
For the retting of fibres which is inexpensive and less time consuming and is not dependent on the arrival of the monsoons.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a process for the retting of fibres which can be done under controlled conditions and does not cause any pollution.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the retting of fibres which produces superior quality of fibres or cellulose with possibilities of being used for multifarious purposes.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for the retting of fibres which makes it possible to recover by-products.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the retting of fibres such as jute, kenaf, sisal or ramie comprising subjecting a plant to a step of decortication to obtain decorticated plant fibres followed bya step of chemical retting comprising of afirst step of swelling the fibres in an alkali solution of 5-25% concentration for 2 to 12 hours, followed by a second step of treatment with a solution selected from sulphates and sulphites for 6 to 18 hours to obtain the retted fibres, subjecting the retted fibres to bleaching and the bleached fibres are optionally treated with an acid to reduce the ash content to obtain the retted plant fibres.<br>
-2-<br><br>
are optionally treated with an acid to reduce the ash content  to obtain the retted plant fibres.<br>
In  accordance with this invention! plants such as  jute,  kenaf, hemp,  sisal or ramie are decorticated by treating with a  3—30% solution  of  a sulphate, such as for eg. ammonium  sulphate  for about  3  to  24  hrs.,  depending  on  the  age  of  the  plant.<br>
The treatment may preferably be with a 10-30% solution  for about<br>
10-24  hrs. Alternatively, a 3 to 5% solution of the sulphate  is<br>
used for about 6 to 18 hrs. depending on the age of the plant and<br>
optionally  heating  at approximately 50 to 95 oC, to  obtain  the<br>
decorticated plant fibres. This is followed by the step of chemical retting whereby the decorticated plant fibres are just swelled by treating with a cold solution of alkali of 5-25% concentration for about 30 mins. to 4 hrs. , and then they are treated with a 1.0 to 10*/. solution of a sulphate or sulphite for approximately 2 to 18 hrs, depending on the age of the plant. Preferably, the fibres are treated with a 2.5—10% solution for approxminately 6—18 hrs. depending on the age of the plant or optionally heated for approximately 2 to 5 hrs. with a 1.0 to 5% solution of the sulphate or sulphite. The sulphates and sulphites are such as ammonium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium or similar sulphates and sulphites. It is preferred not to boil except in the case of sisal and ramie, to avoid evaporation which would lead to the chemical solution becoming more concentrated. This could have a detrimental effect on the fibre and also lead to  unnecessary  wastage of the chemical. During  the  above  two<br><br>
steps of decorticating and chemical retting, lignin from the plant/fibre/stick is released into the sulphate solution and is recovered by removal of cellulose, by means of filtration) in liquid form or in powder form by evaporation of one kind or other. Thereafter) chemical eellulose of high purity alpha cellulose is obtained by application of an alkali solution of 15 to 25% concentration for a predetermined period depending on the age of the plant. This is followed by bailing in 8.5 to 12.5% concentrated solution for a predetermined period depending on the age of the plant. This drastically reduces the remnant lignin as also pectin, hemicelluloses, beta and gamma cellulose, etc.. The processed jute/kenaf/hemp is thereafter bleached to free the surface of the plant/fibre/stick from the bonding material covering it, and thus allow the sulphate and/or the alkali to react. Bleaching with a weak hypochlorite solution) such as sodium hypochlorite is also done to obtain the desired shade in the jute, kenaf) hemp, sisal or ramie fibres.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of this invention, an organic acid such as for eg. actic acid is used for treating the fibres, for softening and reducing ash content. These are beneficial for yarns for fabrics and for pulp for paper respectively. During this treatment, heating is not required.<br>
In yet another embodiment according to this invention, oxalic acid is used far treating the fibres. In this treatment too, no heating is required. The oxalic acid treatment softens the fibres<br>
4<br><br>
and increases the lustre. However, it is preferred to use sulphate solution for decorticating and chemical retting for reasons of economy, strength of fibre and for avoiding pollution hazards.<br>
In the process according to this invention , the chemical retting process of jute, kenaf and hemp is done under controlled conditions as these plants can be harvested and retted at the desired or predetermined time without waiting for the arrival of the monsoons and formation of pools of water which is usually essential to the conventional or traditional method of retting. It therefore also avoids health hazards for the farmers and farm labour. The chemicals chosen for retting are also cheap and the quantities required are low. The time involved for the chemical retting process is only a few hours as compared to about 3 weeks in case of the conventional method of retting. The main chemical, being used for retting and converting to celluloses is pollution-free .<br>
The quality of fibre obtained is superior in terms of fineness, uniformity, strength, flexibility and lustre. Such fibres can be used for multifarious purposes such as pulp for paper, superior yarn for fabrics and also for a host of chemical derivatives. The extracted lignin and ethanol obtained have innumerable end uses of high value.<br>
