1.0   Title of Invention<br>
A garbage storage and compression method for economical disposal  2. 0   Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to the field of economically storing and disposing garbage in big cities, and more particularly to a method for compressing soft garbage for speedy and economical disposal to sites for end use.<br>
3.0	Background of Invention<br>
3.1	 	The growing population, proliferating rapidly in urban areas, has given rise to several civic problems. One of them is the problem of handling and disposing off the garbage, which demands serious attention.<br>
3.2	 	The conventional system of collecting, handling and disposing off the garbage physically by men is primitive, crude and jeopardizes the norms of safety and hygiene to the civic employees or contracted labourers.<br>
3.3	 	There are a few prior works of art, which are summarized for their salient features in the following paragraphs.<br>
3.4	 	The Patent No. JP 2000-070750 deals in a garbage hammering machine, rotated around a shaft that works in tandem with a solid liquid separation. It has no provision for compressing soft garbage and discloses no information on the economical effect of the said hammering machine.<br>
3.5	 	The Patent No. JP 2000-126735 discloses an elevated temperature garbage fermentation apparatus that obviates incineration of garbage and eliminates foul odours. However, it is silent on the economical aspects of operating the invention.<br>
3.6	 	The Patent No. JP 2000-005739 discloses an apparatus for pulverizing<br><br><br>
garbage, followed by a treatment with micro-organisms, volume reduction of solids by aerobic treatment. It does not deal in the filed of volume reduction of soft garbage by a mechanical compression. The invention provides no data on economics of the said treatment.<br>
3.7	The Patent US 6076271 covers an apparatus for essentially de-odourizing and drying garbage by externally applying heat thereto, collecting gases emanating during heating, condensing water vapour for disposal and recycling gases to heater. Economics of the said treatment are not disclosed.<br>
3.8	The Patent No. JP 2000-117233 discloses a bacterial treatment to garbage to eliminate foul odour before its disposal. No details are provided on cost of the said treatment.<br>
3.9	The Patent No. JP 2000-084524 is yet another prior work, disclosing a biological treatment to garbage wherein temperature conducive to biological decomposition of garbage is maintained during the entire treatment. The invention does not deal in volume reduction of the garbage by mechanical compression thereof.<br>
3.10	The invention in prior application JP : 2000-071288 relates to an apparatus for compression devoid of automation thereof and of bulk handling of garbage yields some degree of volume reduction. The prior work yields no solid cubes of garbage and is substantially lacking in features provided in the present invention, namely bulk handling of soft garbage compression to 1/10* of original volume, recovery of by-product water, garbage conversion to compact, duly cubes of uniform size for easier handling, transportation and storage,<br><br><br>
automation of compression and discharge functions and elimination of manual handling of garbage in pre and post-compression stages. The present invention is a substantial improvement of the prior work of art. 3.11 In case of the international application No. JP 20010280713, the invention employs a thermal compression method and is therefore substantially different from the present invention that employs a mechanical compression method and relates to automation thereof.<br>
4.0	Objects of Invention<br>
4.1	An object of paramount importance to this invention is to substantially reduce physical volume of garbage to save on the costs of transporting to disposal sites loose, wet, bulky and smelly garbage that often degrades the air quality to the point of health hazard to residents of colonies in the vicinity of the garbage disposal sites.<br>
4.2	Another object of this invention is to retard the process of decaying garbage by physical separation of water - on which bacteria thrive and multiply - from the garbage.<br>
4.3	Another object of this invention is to render the treated garbage into a physical form in which it has a revenue-generating potential by way of fuel for low-temperature ovens and low-pressure steam boilers.<br>
5.0	Summary of Invention - The invention deals in compressing the garbage<br>
in a stainless steel tank of rectangular, square cross section by means of a hydraulic power-pack such that all water present in garbage is drained out during compression cycle. The method compresses the said garbage to 1/10th volume and yields dry, compact cubes of the compressed garbage which are excellent low-calorific value fuel for steam boilers and ovens.<br><br><br>
Description of Invention<br>
The invention comprises a fabricated, rectangular stainless steel tank (10) as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 1, installed horizontally at an elevation from the ground level on 6 no. metallic legs (14) such that the wall of the platform for parking and unloading incoming garbage truck perfectly aligns with a side of the conical feed bin (3), facilitating collection of garbage into the said bin directly from the truck parked there above. The said bin has a holding capacity for 3 truck-loads of garbage. A compressing piston (9) is internally installed in the said tank (10) such that the said piston (9) is in an initial position, half-way from the ends of the said tank (10) under a corresponding limit switch (5). Another limit switch (2) marks the final compressing position of the said compressing cylinder (7). A shutter cylinder (1) is installed externally on the said tank (10) upstream of the said bin (3) such that the said shutter cylinder operates a trap door (15) in a fully open or fully closed position with regard to the end of the said tank (10). The said fully open and fully closed positions of the said shutter cylinder (1) are respectively marked by limit switches (13) and (12) as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 3. A water drainage pipe (11) is installed externally on the lower end of the said tank (10), slightly upstream of the centre of the said bin (3).Wet un-treated garbage, falling from the said bin (3), is allowed to occupy the compression chamber ahead of the said compressing cylinder (7) during pre-compression stage of an operational cycle. A hydraulic power-pack (6) installed externally on the said tank (10), away from the said Bin (3) operates the said compressing piston (9) from its said initial<br><br><br>
position, marked by limit switch (5) to its final position, marked by limit switch (2). Operations of the said compressing cylinder (9) and the said shutter cylinder (1) are controlled automatically through the control panel (8) and are monitored by an operator. A proximity switch (4) is installed suitably inside the said bin (3) for marking quantity of garbage available for feeding the said compressing chamber.<br>
The accompanying drawing # 2 illustrates a side view of the said rectangular tank (10), having a square cross-section and the installation thereon of the said power-pack (6), the said bin (3) and the said control panel (8). Another embodiment of the present invention is one of vertical configuration for the invention, wherein the fabricated rectangle tank (6) is installed in vertical configuration as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 3 and comprises a cutting-cum-grinder bin (1), fed with garbage that is chopped/shredded into smaller pieces and is fed on a conveyor (2) into a stainless steel fabricated rectangle tank (6) through a garbage loading chute (3).The said tank (6) is installed vertically and is fitted internally with a compressing cylinder (5), marked in its initial position by a limit switch (4). The said compressing cylinder (5) is pushed vertically downward from its said initial position to its final position marked by limit switch (11). A trap door (14) is installed internally and horizontally at the bottom end of the said tank (6) and is operated by a horizontal cylinder (9) between its normally closed position, marked by limit switch (10) and fully open position, marked by limit switch (8) that respectively correspond to the said pull cylinder (9)'s final and initial<br><br><br>
positions. A control panel (7) automatically controls the operations of the said<br>
compressing cylinder (5) and the said pull cylinder (9) and is monitored by the<br>
said operator. 6.4   The accompanying diagram # 4 illustrates the side view of the said vertical<br>
installation, a proximity switch (12) installed suitably externally on the said<br>
tank 6) marking presence of chopped/shredded garbage on the said conveyor<br>
(2) and the installation of the hydro-pack (13). 7.0    Description of Drawings<br>

8.0	Operation of Invention<br>
8.1	A shift operator switches on the horizontal garbage compression machine on the control panel (8) and places its operation on 'Automatic' mode, after ensuring the bin (3) is full with soft garbage. Garbage occupying the compression chamber is compressed to 1/10th its original volume by forward movement of the compressing cylinder (7) from its initial position under limit switch (5) to its final position under limit switch (2), caused by the hydraulic<br><br><br>
pack (6). Water present in the wet garbage, if any, is completely drained out from the said garbage during the said compression action through the drain pipe (11), leaving the said garbage completely dry. The said garbage, during the compression action, is firmly held in place by the trap door (15), moved to 'fully closed' position by the shutter cylinder (1). The timer on the control panel (8), after the compressing cylinder (7) activates the limit switch (2), reverses the direction of the oil flowing through the shutter cylinder (1) such that the said the shutter cylinder (1) retracts to its initial position marked by limit switch (13), thereby in the process pulling the trap door (15) out from the tank (10) to 'fully open' position. This action facilitates the compressing cylinder (7) to eject out the dry, compact and fully compressed garbage in the form of solid cube from the said tank (10) into the truck, parked under the mouth of the said tank (10). The timer in the control panel (8) reverses the direction of the oil flowing through the compressing piston (9) and - a short time later - also reverses the direction of the oil flowing through the shutter cylinder (1) such that after the compressing cylinder (7) has moved away from its final position, marked by the limit switch (2), the shutter cylinder (1) pushes the trap door (15) to its 'fully closed' position. The compressing piston returns to its initial position, marked by limit switch (5) that marks and registers end of the operational cycle in the control panel (8). The control panel (8), in automatic mode, repeats the said operational cycle. 8.2 A shift operator switches on the vertical garbage compression machine on the control panel (7) and places its operation on 'Automatic' mode, after ensuring that the bin (1) is full with soft garbage. The said garbage is chopped/shredded<br><br><br>
into small pieces, that are fed on the conveyor (2) and into the compression chamber of the tank (6) through the chute (3). The garbage in the compression chamber of the tank (6) is compressed to its 1/10th volume by the downward movement of the compressing piston (5). The garbage, while being compressed during the said compression action, is firmly held within the confines of the said compression chamber by the trap door (14), held in its fully closed position by the signal sent by the control panel (7) to the limit switch (10). Water, if any, present in the said garbage under compression drains out through the fine holes present in the said trap door (14). The timer in the control panel (7), after the piston of the compressing cylinder (5) activates the limit switch (11), reverses the direction of the oil flowing through the pull cylinder (9) such that the trap door (14) is pulled out to its 'fully open' position. The said fully compressed garbage is ejected out under the downward force of the compressing cylinder (5) into the form of solid, compact and dry cube, which is collected into a truck parked under the said compression machine. The timer in the control panel (7) reverses the direction of the oil flowing through the compressing cylinder (5), causing the upward movement of the said compressing cylinder (5), and - a short time later - also reverses the direction of the oil flowing through the pull cylinder (9), causing the trap door (14) to move to its 'fully closed' position. The compressing cylinder reaches its initial position, marked by the limit switch (4), whereupon the control panel (7) registers end of the said operational cycle and repeats the said cycle. 8.3 The compact, compressed and dry garbage is easy to handle, occupies much less space for both storage and transportation.<br><br><br>

6	The Garbage compression method can yield a saving of over Rs. 200 crores<br>
annually for Mumbai City that generates every day 4000 M.Tonnes of soft<br>
garbage, while yielding 8,000 cubic metres of water as by-productfor<br>
growing vegetables.</td>
