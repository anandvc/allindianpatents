				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The. invention pertains to an equipment for impregnation (water proofing) of an insulation of a winding rod according to the  features of the disclosure.<br>
BACKSROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Such an equipment is known from the EP 0 831 57S Al. There the container is a mold (form) in which the winding rod is laid in. The mold {form) closeabls with a cover is attached in an evacuating container? so that during the cover remaining open a vacuum can be maintained properly in the container- The cover remains open during the feed ing™in of the impregnating medium. Only after achievement of a. preset table f i 11 ing stand the cover is brought over in the closing position. Moreover" the evgacuating container requires a large space. Seen altogether there follows a complicated tooling and procedure.<br>
Jf&gt; 57013728 discloses a method and apparatus for treating the immersion insulation of a coil for an electric device and to enhance the quality of the insulation of the coil by adopting hydraulic pressure for molding the immersion insulation. JP 6121475O provides a device to improve the insulating preformance -at low cost by impregnating by evacuating in vacuum and pressurising insulating synthetic resin to the ground insulating layer of a sole coil provided with a corona discharge preventing insulating layer on the outer surface in a. mold, and thermally curing<br><br>
2-<br>
Here  is  a  task  to indicate  an  equipment  of  the  kind mentioned at the beginning, which brings forth with less  expense a quicker penetration of the insulation with impregnating medium.<br>
According to the container is a vacuum and pressure-tight flexible cover, which surrounds the winding rod completely, the vacuum-tight casing is enveloped by a jacket which is resistant to pressure, where the space between both the cover is electrically stressed with a pre-settable pressure. With the help of a piping connected with the inner space of the vacuum-tight casing a low-pressure is generated in this first casing. The pressure of the insulating medium flowing-in in the first casing is smaller than the pressure prevailing in the pressure resistant casing.<br>
By the closed container the immediately connected vacuum builder can be generated quicker than the required vacuum. Besides a closed emission-free process, short impregnating times are attained. The differential pressure between the inner room of the container and the inner room of the pressure resistant casing helps the pressing and compressing of the impregnated insulation.<br><br>
3-<br>
Another solution, in accordance with the invention is described wherein the container consists of a tool surrounding the winding rod during evacuation and impregnation in the form closed manner? which is composed from several parts. With the inner room of the tool a piping of a vacuum building system is connected.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIBURES<br>
The equipment, in accordance with the invention? is described with the help of examples of execution and of the accompanying schematic drawings  figure 1 to 6.<br>

DETAIL   DESCRIPTION  OF  A  PREFERRED  EMBODIMENT  OF   THE INVENTION<br>
The figures i and 2 show a winding rod 1 of a stator winding of an electrical machine not represented here. By wrapping with of an insulating band there exists an insulation 2. With a flexible casing 3 developed as hose or shrinking hose made of a vacuum and pressure-tight (pressurized)) material the winding rod 1 is coated (plated) through the total length. A pipeline 4 connects a vacuum buiId ing system 5 with the inner room 6 of the flexible .casing 3, where the inner space has to be equated , essentially, with the space, which the insulation 2 takes-in, A supply main (lead) 7 for the resin used as impregnating medium connects a tank 15 for acceptance of the resin with the mentioned inner room 6- In the pipe line 4 and in the supply line 7, in each case? 2 valves 8,9 and 10, 11 are attached. A compression resistant casing 12 comprises the vacuum and pressure tight casing 3* which is penetrated by the piping 4 and the supply main (lead) 7 . A pressure transmitting medium, as for example compression air, arrives through a pressure line 13 in the space 14 between the vacuum and pressure-tight casing 3 as well as the resistant to compression casing 12.<br><br>
::4 ::<br>
the Towards preparation of the impregnating process of/insulation<br>
2 there takes place after the evacuation of the inner room 6 of the flexible casing 3 through the piping 4 the application of a pre-settable pressure in the space 14 between both the casings 3 and 12. After the closure of the valves 8,9 prevailing in the piping 4 and after the opening of the valves 10, 11 attached to the supply main 7 the impregnating resin is injected from the tank 15 in the insulation 2. The feeding-in pressure is there always smaller than that of the pressure prevailing in the pressure leading casing 12.<br>
The difference between both these pressure values corresponds with the pressure, with which the impregnated insulation 2 is pressed and is tightened. The impregnation is complete, when all the hollow spaces of the evacuated insulations are filled-up.<br>
Besides geometrical factors for the technically interesting impregnation-time the parameter impregnating resin viscosity as well as impregnating pressure (compression) are decisive. Since only the resin-quantity, which actually penetrates in the rod-insulation, is participant to the process, requires no consideration to be taken in respect of the resin-stability. That signifies, that the impregnating temperature can lie essentially higher (upto approximate 120°C) in case of the known immersion-technic, in case of which in an impregnating tub a large quantity of resin must be preserved. This high impregnating temperature effects an extremely low initial-viscosity of the resin and thereby a very quick impregnating procedure. Besides that, the impregnating compression (pressure) can similarly be selected relatively high (approximately 10 bar), so that also from there an essentially quicker impregnation can take place. Thereby the duration of the impregnating process is considerably reduced.<br><br><br>
::5::<br>
During use of to be warm and hot-hardened impregnating resin a heating of the rod and of the rod insulation is required. For this purpose the direct heating of the winding rod and as a result, of the impregnated winding-rod insulation with can be selected the help of current. If during room temperature hardened resins are enclosed, an insulating band can be inserted, which contains the additive suitable for that acting upon the acceleration.<br>
During the process of impregnation the excess pressure in the compression resistant casing 12 can be maintained properly upto the point of gelling and hardening of the impregnating resin. The compression resistant jacket 12 can consist of, for example, a flexible fabric strengthened hose or can consist of matched (suited) segmented and flanged pressure pipes. After completion of the impregnating process in case of closed valves 8,9,10,11 and after withdrawal of the excess pressure in the casing 12 this casing is removed and the winding rod 1 is withdrawn along with the casing 3. After also the casing 3 is detached, the winding rod comes to its authorised application. The figure 3 shows an example of execution, in case of which, three winding rods 1 are impregnated simultaneously. From the pipe line 4 there branch off several stub cable line, so that all the winding rods 1 can be evacuated in the same time. Also from the leading-in line (7) the resin carry away branching off in three stub cable line, in order to render possible the simultaneous induction of resin. As compression-resistant casing 12 at this example of execution a digester is inserted.<br>
In case of a winding rod 1 to be inserted in a stator for the so-called groove part of the winding rod, as a rule, a high mechanical cross sectional precision is required. Figure 4 shows a cross section through the groove part of the winding rod 1 with a calibrating body 16, enveloping (comprising) the casing (3) in a form-closed manner<br><br>
:: 6 ::<br>
 which is attached in the space 14 between the casings 3 and 12. The calibrating body 16 is composed of individual moulded-bodies 16a and 16b and guarantees the matching precision of the groove part.<br>
According to figure 5 a tool 17 is provided, which absorbs in a tooling nest 18 the winding rod 1 in a form closed manner provided with the insulation 2. The tool 17 consists of an upper part 17a and of a lower part 17b, which are connected with one another under interposition of a surrounding packing 19 through a not represented screw-joint  tensionally (frictionally). The chamber built by tooling nest 18 encircles the insulation 2 of the winding rod 1 under observation of a pre-settable clearance. After successful evacuation of the chamber with the help of the pipeline 4 the impregnating resin is fed-in through the .-ieetpj line 7, till the insulation and its hollow spaces are impregnated. In the channels 20 heating or cooling systems towards supporting the impregnating or hadening procedure are attached. The tool 17 is completely closed during the evacuation and during the filling with impregnating resin, so that the discharge of emissions is avoided.<br>
The figure 6 shows a tool 17 with several tool nests 18, so that a corresponding number of not represented winding rods can be evacuated and impregnated simultaneously. Upper and lower parts 17a, 17b are also here under interposition of an encircling packing 19 connected with one another tensionally (frictionally).<br><br><br>
