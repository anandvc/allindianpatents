Shock is defined as an acutely occurring condition of inadequate nutritive perfusion of vital organs, always represents tile highest danger to life (Med. Mo. Phamn. 1989.12/9:279-282).<br>
The causes of shock are varied. Thus cardiogenic shock is caused by primary heart failure as a result of myocardial infarct, severe cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac muscle insufficiency or other cardiac disorders, of hypovolemic shock (hemorrhagic and traumatic shock and also bum and dehydration shock) due to fluid losses or displacements, of septic shock due to systemic infiltration of microbes (gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa etc.) or their toxins and Tammy of anaphylactic shock due to generalized   reactions. Despite this variety of causes, however, the pathogenesis and clinical picture of the various forms of shock proves to be very uniform (Pschyrembel, klinisches WGrterbuch [Clinical dictionary], Walter de Gaiyter-Verlag. 255th Edition, 1986, page 1513). A disorder of the cell functions always plays a key part as a result of inadequate supply of the tissue with oxygen and substrates (ischemia) and inadequate disposal of the toxic metabolic products (Medwelt 1989, 40: 519 - 522). Shock is a dynamic event whose course depends substantially on the duration of ischemia. In the first, compensated shock phase, the body reacts with a neuronally and hormonally controlled centralization of the circulation, by means of which the organs situated in the center of the body (heart, brain, lungs, liver, kidneys) are protected<br><br>
for the time being. The clinical picture is characterized by tachycardia, still normal or only slightly lowered blood pressure, hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis and as a rule pate, cold and clammy skin; in septic shock fever also occurs, from time to time associated with shivering fits. If the compensation mechanisms are exhausted, the capillary perfusion of the central organs is also impaired to an increasing extent. This leads Into the second, decompensated shock phase, which is characterized by progressive cell death and loss of function. The occun-ence of shock is irreversible. The drastic Increase in the vascular permeability in the microcirculation area leads through toss of fluid to a rise in the hematocrit, to interstitial edemas and to the release of mediators which, inter alia, cause a disseminated intravasal coagulation, for example in the form of a consumptive coagulopathy with obturating fibrin thrombi in the terminal vascular system. The constant reduction in cardiac output and blood pressure leads to complete circulatory collapse. At the end of the shock cascade death results due to acute failure of the heart, liver, kidneys or lungs (ARDS = Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or due to multi-organ failure (MOF), if several organs simultaneously lose their function.<br>
Conventional therapy is orientated to clinical symptomatology and includes immediate measures for eliminating the vital threat, such as volume substitution, artificial respiration for the prophylaxis of ARDS. administration of vasoactive pharmaceuticals to support the circulation, analgesia and sedation, correction of the disorders in the acid-based balance, heparin administration to avoid a consumptive coagulopathy and treatment with corticosteriods to reduce membrane permeability. Depending on the cause of shock, further therapeutic measures are indicated, for example operation and hemostasis in hemorrhagic shock, elimination of the focus of infection and antibiotic therapy in septic shock and possible treatment by means of cardiac pacemaker and aortal balloon counterpulsation in cardiogenic shock. In spite of all these therapeutic measures, the result of treatment, however, remains extremely unsatisfactory. Thus the mortality rates, for example, in cardiogenic shock on account of a cardiac infarct is 90% and in septic shock, the globally most frequent cause of death in intensive-care units, is more than 50%.<br>
This makes understandable the demand by clinics for a more causally aligned<br><br>
therapy concept, which allows as early an intermption of the shock cascade as possible and thus distinctly improves the chance of survival. Promising starting points for this are offered by the complex pathophysiological processes which underlie the progressive course of the shock disorder. According to present knowledge, a number of mediator systems and inflammatoriiy competent cells are activated by the respective pathological stimulus both in septic and aseptic forms of shock (N. Engl. J. Med. 1993, 328/20: 1471 -1477) and by this means an endothelial inflammation with diffuse inflammatory processes is caused, which is also designated (J. Amer. med. Ass. 1992,268: 3452) as SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome). At the center of this syndrome is the generalized pathological interaction between activated granulocytes and endothelial cells via complementary adhesion molecules which, with progressive vascular damage, leads to disorders In the microcirculation and organ damage with Increasing functional impairment and finally ends up in a multi-organ failure. With triggering of the vascular wall-associated inflammatory processes by the granulocytic endothelial interaction, septic and aseptic events follow a common pathogenetic final route with the development of shock. Moreover, there are sound indications for the fact that in the course of aseptic forms of shock an invasion of bacteria or their toxic products into the blood stream described as bacterial translocation occurs via an initially nonmicrobally triggered barrier disorder in the lung and, in particular, gastrointestinal tract, so that aseptic and septic events overlap (Medwelt 1989. 40: 525 - 532).<br>
More recent attempts at a causal therapeutic intervention now aim at specific interventions in the disease process supported by inflammatory mediators, in order to interrupt the pathological signal chain as eariy as possible and thus prevent the development of organ damage in time. In targe-scale clinical studies, for example, murine and human monoclonal antibodies against the endotoxin (LPS =Lipopolysaccharide) from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, humanized recombinant and both murine and human monoclonal antibodies against the cytokine TNF (tumor necrosis factor), soluble TNF receptors prepared by genetic engineering and other TNF binding proteins of the physiologically occurring interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Antril (IL-1-RA) produced by recombination as well<br><br>
as the bradykinin antagonist Bradycor have been investigated without a therapeutic breakthrough becoming apparent until now (Scrip Magazine, December 1994: 50 -52). The intensive search for effective blockers of the extremely complex disease event therefore continues undiminished, the knowledge increasingly gaining acceptance that the switching-off of a specific mediator of the wide-ranging signal cascade only has low prospects of success and that therapeutic advances are most likely to be expected from a multifunctional intervention, be it just by combination of various selectively active pharmaceuticals or advantageously by a monopharmacon with as wide a pharmacological spectmm of action as possible.<br>
For the testing of preparations for antishock action, various experimental animal models have been developed. A particularly practicable readily standardized and predictive model (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1979, 76/11: 5939 - 5943) is endotoxin (LPS)-induced shock on C57BL76 mice, which realistically follows the clinical situation inasmuch as the sensitivity of the animals to LPS is so greatly increased by simultaneous administration of galactosamine (GaIN) that the comparatively low lethal dose in humans also suffices here for the triggering of the fatal shock event (DN&amp;P 1993, 6/9: 641 - 646; Biospektrum 1995. 1/5: 46 - 52). In this model, theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) shows no noticeable protective action at doses up to the tolerability limit.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the introduction of substituents having at least one ether function into the methyl radical in the 1-position of the theophylline molecule produces very potent preparations with, at the same time, substantially improved tolerability. Three compounds of this structural type are known, namely the 3-n-propylxanthine having the 2-methoxyethy. 2-ethoxyethyl or 3-methoxypropyl group in the 1-position (J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36/10: 1380 -1386), which on account of bronchodilatory properties ought to be suitable for the treatment of acute asthma attacks, but references to their utility as antishock agents do not exist.<br>
The invention relates to the use of at least one compound of the formula I<br><br>
O	H<br><br>
R^<br>

R^      is       a)	straight-chain or branched (C^-CgHfkyl,<br>

Furthermore preferred is the use of the compounds of the formula I, where<br>
R^	is straight-chain or branched (Ci-C4)-alkyl,<br>
A	is an unbranched (Ci-C3)-alkylene bridge and	/    ,,v<br>
R2	is straight-chain or branched (C^-C4)-alkyl, cyclopropyl or       /^ '<br>
cyclopropylmethyl.<br>
The expression "(C4-Cg)-cycloalkylalkyl" defines those alkyl radicals which are substituted by (C3-Cg)-cycloalkyi, where the sum of all carbon atoms is smaller than or equal to 8. These are the cyclopropylmethyl to -pentyl. cyclobutylmethyl to -butyl, cyclopentylmethyl to -propyl and cyclohexylmethyl and -ethyl radicals. Halogen atoms are iodine, bromine, fluorine and, preferably, chlorine.<br>
The invention also relates to novel compounds of the formula I, in which<br>
R'      is       a)       straight-chain or branched (Ci-CsJ-alkyl,<br>
b)	(Ci-C2)-alkoxy-(Ci-C3)-alkyl or<br>

where compounds of the formula I in which a) R^ is n-propyl, R^ is methyl or ethyl and A is an ethylene bridge or b) R^ is n-propyl, R^ is methyl and A is an n-propylene bridge are excluded.<br><br>
Preferred compounds of the formula I are those in which R^      is       a)       straight-chain or branched (Ci-C4)-aIkyl,<br>
b)	methoxymethyl,<br>
c)	methoxyethyl.<br>

where compounds of the formula I in which a) R^ is n-propyl, R^ is methyl or ethyl and A is an ethylene bridge or b) R^ is n-propyl, R^ is methyl and A Is an n-propytene bridge are excluded.<br>
Furthermore prefen'ed compounds of the formula I are those in which<br>
R^	is straight-chain or branched (Ci-C4)-alkyl,<br>
A	is an unbranched (C^-C3)-alkyfene bridge and<br>
R^	is straight-chain or branched (Ci-C4)-alkyl, cyclopropyl or<br>
cydopropylmethyl, where the compounds of the formula I in which a) R^ is n-propyl, R^ is methyl or ethyl and A is an ethylene bridge or b) R^ is n-propyl, R^ is methyl and A is an n-propylene bridge are excluded.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be deprotonated in the 7-position and therefore form salts and solvates with basic agents. Those possible for this purpose are preferably pharmaceuticaily acceptable alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts and the salts and solvates with organic bases, for example ethylenediamine, or the basic amino acids lysine, ornithine and arginine. The invention thus also relates to the physiologically tolerable salts and/or solvates of the 1,3-disubstltuted xanthines<br><br>
of formula i and their use as active compounds in antishock compositions.<br>
Compounds of the formula I having an unsymmetrically branched alkyl radical in the position of R^ and/or R^ and/or having an unsymmetrically branched alkylene bridge A have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and can thus be present in stereoisomeric forms. The invention therefore includes both the stereoisomericaily pure compounds and their mixtures, and their use as active compounds in antishock compositions.<br><br>
The invention further relates to an analogous process for the preparation of the novel compounds of formula I, whose fundamental embodiments are described in WO 87/00523. For example, a procedure is thus used in which a)       a 3-substituted xanthine of the formula tl O      H<br>
R^<br>
(II) o<br><br>
in which R^ is as defined in fonnula I, is reacted without condensing agent or in the presence of a basic condensing agent or in the form of its salts with a reagent of the formulae III<br>
R»-X	(III)<br>
O<br>
H<br>
in which R" is an easily eliminable leaving group, for example the reductively<br>
or alternatively hydrolytically removable benzyl, benzhydryl ortrityl group,<br>
having unsubstituted or substituted phenyl rings, and X is halogen, preferably<br>
chlorine, bromine or iodine, or alternatively a sulfonic acid ester or<br>
phosphonic acid ester group, or<br>
b)       a 7-substituted xanthine of the formula IV<br>
o      R"<br>
^•N^N^	(IV)<br><br>
in which R® is benzyl having an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl radical, is reacted without condensing agent or in the presence of a basic condensing<br><br>
agent or in the form of its salts with a reagent of the formula V<br>
R2-X	(V)<br>
in which R^ is as defined in formula t and X is as defined in formula<br>
to give a 3,7-disubstituted xanthine of the formula VI<br><br>
1   X^&gt;<br>
R^<br><br>
(VI)<br><br>
in which R^ is as defined in formula I and R" is as defined in formula III or IV, then the compound of the formula VI is converted without condensing agent or in the presence of a basic condensing agent or in the form of its salts, using an alkylating agent of the formula VII<br>
R1-0-A-X	(VII)<br>
in which R** and A are as defined in formula I and X is as defined in formula III, into a 1,3,7-trisubstituted xanthine of the formula VIM<br><br><br><br>
(VIII)<br><br>
R^<br>
in which RV A and R^ are as defined in formula I and R^ is as defined in formula III or IV,<br>
and finally by elimination of the leaving group R^ from the intermediate of the formula VIII the compound of the formula I according to the invention is obtained and this is optionally converted, if appropriate after separation of the stereoisomeric forms, into a physiologically tolerable salt.<br>
The monosubstituted xanthines of the formulae II and IV and alkylating agents of the formulae III, V and VII used in this context as starting substances are for the greatest part known or can be easily prepared by known methods. Thus, for example, the 7-benzylxanthines of the formula IV are accessible from guanosine by benzylation, hydrolytic elimination of the sugar radical and<br><br>
subsequent conversion of the guanosine stmcture into the xanthine structure (Synth. Commun. 1990, 20: 2459-2467).<br>
With the introduction of the R^-0-A-side chain into the 1-position of the xanthine structure of suitable alkylating agents of the formula VM, those compounds In which A is a methylene group (A = -CH2'-) assume a special position inasmuch as their halides can admittedly be employed successfully as reactants, but at least on large-scale use can raise toxocological problems. Therefore, in this special case the use of the corresponding sulfonates may be preferred, which are conveniently accessible, for example, by reaction of mixed anhydrides of aliphatic carboxylic acids and of aliphatic or of aromatic sulfonic acids (J. Org. Chem. 1971, 36: 528 -531) with the disubstituted formaldehyde acetals of the formula IX in a reaction which is clear and goes nearly to completion (J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1969, 91:5663 -5665):<br>
R3-S02-0-CO-(Ci-C4)alkyl	+	Ri-OCHg-O-Ri    (IX)<br>
- (Ci-C4)alkyl-C0-0-Ri<br>
R3-S02-0-CH2-0-R1<br>
In this context, R^ is an aliphatic radical such as methyl, ethyl or trifluoromethyl or an aromatic radical, for example phenyl, 4-tolyl or 4-bromophenyl, but preferably methyl or 4-tolyl, and R^ has the meanings defined under formula I. The reaction can be carried out both in substance and in an anhydrous, aprotic solvent, which Is inert to the reaction components, at temperatures between -20" and +40'C, preferably between 0' and 20'C. Intermediate isolation of the highly reactive sulfonates, which are sensitive to hydrolysis and heat-labile, is not necessary; they are expediently used directly as crude products for the alkylation of the xanthines VI on the nitrogen atom in the 1-position, the otherwise customary addition of a basic condensing agent often being unnecessary.<br>
The reaction of the mono- and disubstituted xanthine derivatives II, IV and VI with<br><br>
the alkylating agents of the formula II, V or VII concerned is usually carried out in a diluent or solvent which is inert to the reaction participants. Those which are suitable are especially dipolar, aprotic solvents, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone. \B\TBmQ&gt;hy\\j,tea,<br>
hexamethylphosphoramide or dimethyl sulfoxide; it is also possible to use, however, formamide. acetonitrile, acetone, butanone or alcohols, such as methanol, ethylene glycol and its mono- or di(Ci-C4)alkyl ethers, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the various butanols; hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane or chloroform; pyridine as well as mixtures of the solvents mentioned or mixtures thereof with water. The alkylation reactions are expediently carried out in the presence of a basic condensing a.qeni. Those suitable for this purpose are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrides, alkoxides and organic bases, such as trialkylamines, e.g. triethyl- or tributylamine. quaternary ammonium or phosphonlum hydroxides and crosslinked resins having attached, optionally substituted ammonium or phosphonlum groups. The xanthine derivatives, however, can also be employed directly in the form of their separately prepared salts, for example the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium or phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the xanthine compounds can be conveniently alkylated both in the presence of the abovementioned inorganic condensing agents and in the form of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts with the assistance of so-called phase-transfer catalysts, for example tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts or alternatively crown ethers, preferably in a two-phase system under the conditions of a phase-transfer catalysis. Suitable, mostly commercially available phase-transfer catalysts are, inter alia, tetra((C.,-C4)alkyl-and methyltrioctylammonium and phosphonium, methyl- myristyl-, phenyl and benzyl-tri(Ci-C4)alkyl- and cetyltrimethylammonium and also (Ci-Ci2)alkyt- and benzyltriphenyl-phosphonium salts, as a rule those compounds which have the cation of larger and more symmetrical construction proving to be more effective. In the procedures described above, the reaction is in general carried out at a reaction temperature of between 0*C and the boiling point of the reaction medium used in each case, preferably between 20" and 130*0, optionally at elevated or reduced pressure, but usually at atmospheric pressure, it being possible for the<br><br>
reaction time to be from less than one hour up to several hours.<br>
The elimination of the leaving group R" from the compounds of the formula VIII with formation of the xanthines of the formula I according to the invention is carried out under standard conditions, which were developed especially in the context of the protective group technique in alkaloid and peptide syntheses and can thus be assumed to be largely known.<br>
The benzyl, benzhydryl or trityl group which is optionally substituted in the phenyl rings is then preferably reductively eliminated. Beside chemical reduction, in particular of the benzyl compounds with sodium in liquid ammonia, the elimination of the three abovementioned aralkyi groups by catalytic hydrogenolysis with the aid of a noble metal catalyst is preferably suitable here, the substitution of molecular hydrogen by ammonium formate as a hydrogen donor often having proven suitable. The reaction medium used here is usually a lower alcohol, optionally with addition of formic acid or alternatively ammonia; an aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamlde; or, in particular, glacial acetic acid; however, mixtures thereof with water can also be used. Suitable hydrogenation catalysts are especially palladium black and palladium on activated carbon or barium sulfates, while other noble metals, such as platinum, rhodium and ruthenium often give rise to side reactions on account of competing nuclear hydrogenation and can therefore only be employed to a limited extent. The hydrogenolysis is expediently carried out at temperatures between 20** and lOO'C and under atmospheric pressure or preferably a slight overpressure of up to about 10 bar, as a rule reaction times of a few minutes up to several hours being needed. Alternatively, however, the elimination of the protective group R*, such as, for example, of the 4-methoxybenzyl, benzhydryl or trityl radical, can also be carried out hydrolytically with customary proton catalysis.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of the formula I according to the Invention in stereoisomerically pure form is preferably carried out by subsequent separation of the stereoisomeric forms with the aid of methods known per se. As diastereomers, in contrast to enantiomers, have different physical and chemical properties, the separation of mixtures thereof, for example by fractional crystallization or<br><br>
chromatographic processes, generally presents no difficulties. On the other hand, physical resolution of racemates into the enantiomeric forms (antipodes) requires additional precautions: thus fractional crystallization takes place only after formation of diastereomeric salts using an optically active base and chromatographic separation only when using chiral stationary phases which exhibit a different spatial affinity for the enantiomers.<br>
The 1,3,7-trisubstituted xanthines of the formula VIII are useful intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention, and moreover, in particular if R^ is benzyl, already show the same pharmacological trend of action as the final products of the formula I and therefore also belong to the claim range of the present invention, even though they are more difficult to administer parenterally on account of their lower water solubility.<br>
The novel compounds of the formula I according to the invention are outstandingly suited on account of their useful phannacological properties for use as active compounds in pharmaceuticals, in particular in those which permit an effective curative and prophylactic treatment of shock disorders and thus are a substantial enrichment of pharmaceutical wealth. They can either be administered per se, for example in the form of microcapsules, in mixtures with one another or in combination with suitable excipients.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to pharmaceuticals which contain at least one compound of the formula I, the 3-n-propylxanthines having 2-methoxyethyl, 2-ethoxyethyl or S-methoxypropyl in the 1 -position and previously described as active compounds for pharmaceuticals having another indication being excluded.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is the use of the compounds of the formula I for the production of pharmaceutical preparations for parenteral and oral administration, but optionally also rectal administration, transdermal administration or administration by inhalation in shock disorders. Suitable solid or liquid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, gels, preparations<br><br>
with delayed release of active compound, suppositories, active compound-releasing patches, aerosols, drops and especially injectable solutions in the form of ampoules or injection bottles for continuous infusion, in whose preparation auxiliaries, such as excipients, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used. Frequently used auxiliaries which may be mentioned are, for example, magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitot and other sugars, talc, lactoprotein, gelatin, starch, vitamins, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols and solvents, such as, for example, sterile water, physiological saline solution, alcohols, glycerol and other polyhydric alcohols (polyols).<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparations are prepared and administered in dose units, each unit containing as active constituent a specific dose of a compound of formula l
For the treatment of an adult patient - depending on the activity of the compounds of formula I in man and the degree of severity of the life-threatening disorder - daily doses of 100 to 5000 mg of active compound, preferably 300 to 3000 mg, are indicated in the case of oral administration and of 30 to 3000 mg, preferably 50 to 2000 mg, in the case of intravenous administration. The administration of the daily dose can be carried out either by single administration In the form of an individual dose unit or, however, of several small dose units, or by repeated administration of subdivided doses at specific time intervals.<br>
In the case of intravenous continuous infusion, the daily dose is 100 to 5000 mg, preferably 500 to 2000 mg, con-esponding to an infusion rate of 0,1 to 3 mg per kg of body weight per hour (h), preferably of 0.3 to 1 mg/kg/h.<br>
In the case of all administration forms, however, under certain circumstances higher or lower daily doses may be appropriate.<br><br>
Finally, the compounds of the formula I - if clinically indicated - can also be administered together with other suitable active compounds, in particular with those which also intervene in a regulating manner in the signal cascade of the shock event; for example with antibodies against entero- and endotoxins (LPS), the monocytic LPS receptor CD14 or the LPS-bindtng protein LBP; with modulators of the cytokine network such as anti-TNF antibodies, soluble TNF receptors and other TNF-binding proteins, inhibitors of inlerleukin-l (IL-1) and/or TNF production and/or release, and TNF and IL-1 receptor antagonists; with inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism and of the coagulation and complement cascade such as phospholipase A2, cyciooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors (e.g. steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen), PAF(platelet-actlvating factor), leukotriene, thromboxane, thrombin, fibrin, bradykinin and serotonin antagonists and also anti-C5a or -C3a antibodies; with anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors such as antithrombin III, tissue plasminogen activator tPA-1, heparin and also prostacyclin and its more stable synthetic derivatives; with inhibitors of the release and/or of the biological action of lytic enzymes; with oxygen radical scavengers such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, alpha- tocopherol or N-acetylcysteine; with heavy metal chelators such as deferoxamine; with inhibitors of intercellular adhesion such as fibronectin or antibodies against the adhesion molecules ELAM-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and CD11/CD18; or else alternatively with antibiotics, or are formulated together in the preparation of the abovementioned pharmaceutical preparation forms.<br>
Below, the synthesis of the compounds of formula I compiled according to structural points of view in Table 1 is explained in greater detail with the aid of representative preparation examples. In Table 2, the useful intermediate compounds of the formula VIII are compiled in the same arrangement. For all synthetically prepared intermediates and final products, the structure was confirmed both by ^ H-NMR spectroscopy and by elemental analysis or mass spectrum.<br>

Pharmacological testing and results<br>
The pronounced antishock action of the compounds of fomiula I was demonstrated in the well-established model of endotoxin (LPS)- induced lethal shock on C57BI-/6 mice by means of the decrease in mortality.<br>
To carry out the experiments, a mixture of 10 ng of LPS from Salmonella abortus equi and 7.5 mg of galactosamine in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered, physiological saline solution was administered to each animal by intravenous injection, which as a rule led to death within 6 to 9 hours. The test preparations were administered intraperitoneally one hour before LPS provocation at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The animals of the control group (n - 10) instead of this received pure 0.9% saline solution as a placebo. To assess the action of the preparation, the number of surviving animals was determined in the treated group (n = 10) 48 hours after LPS administration and from this the percentage inhibition of mortality was determined with respect to the mortality in the control group. The experimental results are presented in Table 3.<br><br>

In the course of wider pharmacological screening, it was additionally possible to show that the compounds of the formula I were additionally able to inhibit ischemically-related cell death in the central nervous system in a lasting manner. They are therefore also suitable for the treatment and prophylaxis of cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke; transitory ischemic attacks (TIA); multiinfarct dementia; dementia of the mixed type with a vascular and degenerative (Alzheimer) component; spinal cord damage; cerebral trauma as a result of head injuries; and neuronal damage after cardiac arrest, (neonatal) asphyxia and<br><br>
reanjmation as well as vascular surgical interventions (e.g. bypass operations) in the area of the main arteries supplying the brain.<br>
It was convincingly possible to demonstrate the neuronal protective action of the theophylline derivatives according to formula I, Inter alia, in the model of transient global ischemia in the gerisil. This finding is also surprising inasmuch as theophylline itself under comparable experimental conditions inhibits ischemic nerve cell damage neither in the gerbil (J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987, 7/1: 74-81) nor the rat (J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1994,14/1:166 -173), but rather increases it even more.<br>
To carry out the experiment, which took place according to the guidelines of the German Animal Protection Act, 30 male Mongolian gehsils having a body weight of between 60 and 70 g were randomly divided into two groups each containing 15 animals. The respective test substance was administered to the animals of the first group 30 minutes after the ischemia period by intraperitoneal injection, while the animals of the second group, which served as an untreated control group, only received the same volume of the vehicle concerned. To produce the temporary forebrain ischemia, the animals were fixed in the supine position to a heated operated table, and both common carotid arteries were carefully exposed and closed for 3 minutes by means of microaneurysm clips. 7 days after the 3-minute ischemia period, the animals were decapitated under halothane anesthesia, the brains were rapidly and carefully removed, first fixed by immersion in Camoy's solution (ethanol/chloroform/acetic acid = 6/3/1) and then embedded in paraffin. Subsequently 4 to 6 ^m thick coronal sections through the hippocampus were prepared approximately at the height of the bregma and these were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. After this, the extent of eosinophilic necrosis of the pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was determined by light microscopy in the course of a blind experiment by means of a semiquantitative histopathological score (0 = none; 1 = slight; 2 = medium severe; 3 = severe and 4 = complete necroses). The assessment variable used for the neuroprotective action was the percentage change in the mean histopathological score of the preparation group compared to that of the untreated control group.
