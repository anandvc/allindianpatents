				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ELECTRON BEAM MICRO/NANO FABRICATION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present: invention relates to an electron beam<br>
micro/nano fabrication method for a compound semiconductor<br>
substrate, in particular, the surface of an AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z<br>
epitaxially grown on GaAs or an InP substrate.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, with the improvement in the degree of<br>
integration of ULSIs that form the core of microelectronics,<br>
circuit patterns in these quantum devices have been<br>
increasingly miniaturized. Conventionally, in fabrication<br>
processes of semiconductor devices, as basic techniques for<br>
removing unnecessary parts of insulating layers and thin metal<br>
layers with a high degree of accuracy along resist patterns,<br>
various etching methods have been widely employed. As one of<br>
these etching methods, dry etching using a halogen gas can be<br>
mentioned. This dry etching has been anticipated as being<br>
capable of fabricating a structure such as a minute quantum<br>
device since etching is carried out in a relatively clean<br>
atmosphere in a high vacuum.<br>
For example, for Si, which is a representative device<br>
material, a dry etching process by a fluorine and<br>
chlorine-based halogen gas has been carried out. In addition,<br>
there are many reports on a dry etching process with regard<br>
to compound semiconductors such as AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z including<br>
GaAs as well, however, as a matter of fact, a technical means<br>
for enabling fabrication of a quantum element has not been<br>
completed.<br>
For example, GaAs is a material that is great in mobility<br>
compared to Si and is capable of a higher-frequency and<br>
higher-speed operation than that of Si, and in place of Si,<br>
which has developed on an industrial scale based on advantages<br>
such as abundance in resources and crystal integrity, this has<br>
been attracting attention for its excellent properties and<br>
diversity as one of the component semiconductors to overcome<br>
limitations thereof. Moreover, as epitaxial crystal growth<br>
techniques for compound semiconductors such as this GaAs,<br>
techniques such as an MBE (molecular beam epitaxial growth)<br>
method and an MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition)<br>
method have advanced to allow a high-quality crystal growth,<br>
therefore, importance of compound semiconductors as device<br>
materials has been increasing.<br>
Therefore, as a dry etching method for overcoming<br>
technical limitations of a conventional dry etching method<br>
using a halogen gas for a compound semiconductor or the like,<br>
the present inventor has developed a method for dry-etching<br>
the surface of a semiconductor crystal by a bromide in single<br>
atomic layer units and has disclosed the same in Japanese<br>
Published Unexamined Patent Application No. H08-321483.<br>
However, in order to form a circuit pattern on the surface<br>
of a GaAs layer with accuracy, it has been necessary to form<br>
a dry etching mask even when dry etching is carried out in single<br>
atomic layer units as described above.<br>
Conventionally, fabrication of this dry etching mask has<br>
been carried out by use of an electron beam lithography<br>
technique as described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent<br>
Application No. 2001-267213, for example.<br>
However, with miniaturization and a greater complexity<br>
of circuit patterns of quantum devices in recent years, it has<br>
become difficult to fabricate this dry etching mask itself,<br>
therefore, a problem has existed in that reproducibility of<br>
shape and size has deteriorated, and furthermore, cost<br>
considerably has risen.<br>
Moreover, since a surface oxide layer such as As2O3, As2O,<br>
or Ga2O has been naturally formed on the surface of a GaAs layer,<br>
when forming a dry etching mask, it has also been necessary<br>
to remove this surface oxide layer.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the<br>
problems, and an object thereof is to provide an electron beam<br>
micro/nano fabrication method for forming on the spot, on the<br>
surface of an AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z including GaAs, a minute<br>
circuit pattern having different aspect ratios used for a<br>
quantum device without necessity for removing in advance a<br>
surface oxide layer such as AS2O3, As2O, or Ga2O naturally formed<br>
on the surface of a GaAs layer and also without forming a dry<br>
etching mask for forming a miniaturized complex circuit:<br>
pattern.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An electron beam micro/nano fabrication method of the<br>
present invention is for irradiating, onto a surface of a GaAs<br>
thin layer formed on an AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z (0=x, y, z=1) surface<br>
including GaAs alone or an InP substrate, an electron beam<br>
controlled to an arbitrary electron beam diameter and current<br>
density so as to selectively substitute or generate Ga2O3 for<br>
a natural oxide layer formed on the GaAs surface, then<br>
dry-etching the GaAs layer surface by a bromide in single atomic<br>
layer units, and thereby selectively removing the natural oxide<br>
layer other than the part substituted by the Ga2O3, GaAs, and<br>
As such, for the electron beam micro/nano fabrication<br>
method of the present invention, it is unnecessary to fabricate<br>
and use a dry etching mask, which has been used at the time<br>
of dry etching, thus by changing Ga2O3 having etching resistance<br>
in crystallinity by controlling the amount of dose of an<br>
electron beam, it becomes possible to freely adjust the shape<br>
and aspect ratio of a pattern formed on the surface of<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer. Therefore, it becomes possible to<br>
deal with a miniaturized circuit pattern, such as a circuit<br>
pattern used for recent quantum devices.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
An electron beam micro/nano fabrication method according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention is for irradiating,<br>
onto the surface of a GaAs thin layer formed on the surface<br>
of a AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer including GaAs alone or an InP<br>
substrate, an electron beam controlled to an arbitrary electron<br>
beam diameter and current density so as to selectively<br>
substitute or generate Ga2O3 for a natural oxide layer formed<br>
on the GaAs layer surface, then dry-etching the GaAs and<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer surface by a bromide in single atomic<br>
layer units, and thereby removing the natural oxide layer other<br>
 than the part substituted by the Ga2O3, GaAs, and<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z. In addition, anyof AsBr3, PBr3, GaBr3, and<br>
InBr3 is used for the bromide. In addition, by controlling<br>
etching resistance at the time of dry etching by controlling<br>
the amount of irradiation (amount of dose) of the electron beam<br>
and substituting Ga2O3 different in crystallinety for the GaAs<br>
natural oxide layer, micro/nano structures having different<br>
aspect ratios can be formed by a multi-chamber vacuum identical<br>
step. In addition, it is preferable that an acceleration<br>
voltage of the electron beam is 50keV or less and the amount<br>
of dose thereof is 1016 to 1020 electron/cm2.<br>
In addition, by an electron beam micro/nano fabrication<br>
method according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
onto a natural oxide layer on the surface of a GaAs thin layer<br>
formed on the surface of a AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer, an electron<br>
beam controlled to an arbitrary electron beam diameter and<br>
current density is directly irradiated so as to selectively<br>
substitute chemically stable Ga2O3 for the natural oxide layer<br>
such as As203, As2O, or Ga2O naturally formed on the GaAs layer<br>
surface. Then, the other oxide such as As2O3, As2O, or Ga2O is<br>
selectively thermally desorbed under a depressurized<br>
environment of approximately 10-3Pa or less. At this time, the<br>
substituted stable oxide layer (Ga2O3) plays a role equivalent<br>
to a mask used for a conventional lithographic method, and when<br>
the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z. layer base material is etched in single<br>
atomic layer units in an atmosphere of a bromide such as As2Br3,<br>
PBr3, GaBr3, or InBr3r Ga2O3 being a chemically stable oxide<br>
layer remains on the surface of the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z. layer,<br>
thus an arbitrary pattern can be formed on the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z<br>
layer surface. Accordingly, by drawing an arbitrary pattern<br>
or the like on the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer surface at the time<br>
of electron beam irradiation by use of an electron beam,<br>
chemically stable Ga2O3 is formed on a portion of the<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer surface irradiated with an electron<br>
beam, and this Ga203 remains without being etched by a bromide<br>
at the time of dry etching by a bromide, whereby it becomes<br>
possible to process an arbitrary pattern on the<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer.<br>
In addition, by increasing the amount of dose of an<br>
electron beam at the time of electron beam irradiation,<br>
crystallinity of substituted Ga2O3 is improved, and mask<br>
resistance to dry etching also increases in accordance<br>
therewith, therefore, as a micro/nano structure formed after<br>
etching, one with a large aspect ratio can be formed. Namely,<br>
when the aspect ratio of a micro/nano structure formed after<br>
etching is to be increased, increasing the amount of dose of<br>
an electron beam makes it possible to control the line width<br>
and the like of a pattern on the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer surface<br>
in nano-order units.<br>
Here in after, an example of the embodiment of an ion<br>
beam micro /nano fabrication method according to this invention<br>
will be described with reference to the drawings. In Fig. 1,<br>
reference numeral 1 denotes a GaAs layer, and reference numeral<br>
2 denotes a natural oxide layer on the surface of As2O3 or the<br>
like naturally formed on the surface of the GaAs layer 1. Also,<br>
in Fig. 1, it is shown that the amount of dose of an electron<br>
beam increases from left to right on the paper, that is, as<br>
it shifts to Fig. 1(a) to (c).<br>
By an electron beam micro/nano fabrication method<br>
according to the present embodiment example, first, without<br>
removing the natural oxide layer 2 such as As2O3 naturally<br>
formed on the surface of the GaAs layer 1, an electron beam<br>
is irradiated in a high vacuum toward the surface of this<br>
natural oxide layer 2 at an acceleration voltage of 50keV or<br>
less, and preferably, 20keV or less, so that the amount of dose<br>
becomes 1016xl020eletron/cm2. Here, the amount of dose of an<br>
electron beam is controlled by appropriately changing the<br>
amperage and irradiation time of the electron beam. By<br>
irradiating an electron beam, an oxide such as As2O3 or As203<br>
of the natural oxide layer 2 is substituted by a chemically<br>
stable oxide 3 of Ga2O3. (see the upper tier of Pig. 1 (a) ) . Next,<br>
by raising the temperature of the GaAs layer 1 where a part<br>
of the surface oxide layer 2 has been substituted by the Ga2O3<br>
3 to 580 to 620°C, the surface oxide layer 2 other than the<br>
part substituted by the Ga2O3 3 is thermally desorbed, and then<br>
by carrying out dry etching in single atomic layer units by<br>
etching the surface by irradiating thereon a bromide, the part<br>
other than the part substituted by the Ga2O3 3 is removed (see<br>
the lower tier of Fig. 1(a)). At this time, by applying<br>
patterning to the surface of the GaAs layer 1 so as to become<br>
a predetermined circuit pattern by use of an electron beam,<br>
it becomes possible to process an arbitrary pattern on the<br>
surface of the GaAs layer 1.<br>
Here, this dry etching makes it possible to obtain a<br>
surface excellent in flatness with excellent reproducibility.<br>
Concretely, in this etching by a bromide, atoms to be etched<br>
are atoms at step positions and kink positions of the surface,<br>
and since steps and kinks that compose a surface unevenness<br>
are preferentially removed, etching can be carried out in<br>
single atomic layer units. A surface obtained as a result of<br>
such etching in single layer units is extremely high in flatness.<br>
In other words, a flat surface can be obtained at the atomic<br>
level. Furthermore, this method allows isotropic etching<br>
regardless of plane indices. Therefore, for the surfaces of<br>
a GaAs crystal, it becomes possible to control, on the spot,<br>
etching in single layer units, namely, an etching depth and<br>
a profile shape of a processing region in nano-order units on<br>
all surfaces of (100), (110), and (111) regardless of plane<br>
indices.<br>
In this dry etching, etching can be carried out, by use<br>
of a bromide gas, in a ultra high vacuum, for example, after<br>
an evacuation to the level of 10-7Pa, by introducing an etenant<br>
gas (bromide gas) under a under a group V molecular gas partial<br>
pressure of 10"3 to 10-7Pa at 580 to 620°C. Here, as the bromide<br>
used as an etchant gas, preferably, AsBr3, which is a compound<br>
with As and PBr3, which is a compound with P, can be mentioned<br>
as representative examples thereof. As a matter of course,<br>
this may be of another type.<br>
As such, since it is possible to etch surface atomic<br>
layers with respect to every single layer, it becomes possible<br>
to process a part other than where a natural oxide layer that<br>
is present on the surface of an AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer has been<br>
substituted by minute-sized chemically stable Ga2O3 formed by<br>
an electron beam irradiation in nano-order units, whereby<br>
 micro/nano structures with high aspect ratios can be formed<br>
with excellent reproducibility and without difficulty, thus<br>
it becomes possible to carry out negative-tone lithography.<br>
By irradiating an electron beam 4 for a time longer than<br>
that of the aforementioned case to increase the amount of dose<br>
thereof, it becomes possible to increase the aspect ratio of<br>
the Ga2O3 3 as shown in Figs. 1 (b) and (c) .<br>
As such, by an electron beam micro/nano fabrication<br>
method according to the present invention, without removing<br>
a natural oxide layer such as AS2O3 naturally formed on the<br>
surface of a GaAs layer, by irradiating an electron beam onto<br>
this natural oxide layer, it becomes possible to form a<br>
chemically stable Ga2O3 on the surface. Then, by controlling<br>
the amount of dose of an electron beam, it becomes possible<br>
to control the crystallinity of Ga2O3 formed on the surface of<br>
the GaAs layer after dry etching by a bromide, whereby<br>
structures having different aspect ratios can be formed. In<br>
addition, by drawing, at the time of electron beam irradiation,<br>
on the surface of a GaAs layer so as to become a predetermined<br>
circuit by use of an electron beam, an arbitrary circuit pattern<br>
can be processed with excellent reproducibility. Thereby, it<br>
becomes possible to apply the method to wavelength<br>
discriminating devices, micro-machining, micro/nano<br>
fabrication of photonic crystals, micro-components, and the<br>
like, quantum wires, quantum boxes, and the like, not to mention<br>
semiconductor devices.<br>
Here, although a description has been given of a GaAs<br>
layer in the present embodiment example, effects similar to<br>
those of the GaAs layer described in the present embodiment<br>
example are provided as long as the layer is an<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer, therefore, the invention is not<br>
limited to a GaAs layer.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
grater detail based on an example.<br>
(Example)<br>
An electron beam whose electron beam diameter has been<br>
narrowed to 0.1µm is irradiated in a vacuum toward the surface<br>
of a natural oxide layer such as As2O3 naturally formed on the<br>
surface of a GaAs layer at an acceleration voltage of 30kV,<br>
and an amperage of 5xlO-7A for an irradiation time of 1 to 9<br>
µsec/dot. At this time, lµm-wide lines were drawn by the<br>
electron beam at intervals of 10pm in a lattice form.<br>
In addition, by changing the irradiation time, the amount of<br>
dose was changed as follows:<br>
(1) 0. 6xl019electron/cm2<br>
(2) 1. 2xl019electron/cm2<br>
(3) 1.8xl019electron/cm2<br>
(4) 2.4xl019electron/cm2<br>
(5) 3.0xl019electron/cm2<br>
(6) 3.6xl019electron/cm2<br>
(7) 4.2xl019electron/cm2<br>
(8) 4.8xl019electron/cm2<br>
(9) 5.4xl019electron/cm2<br>
After irradiating an electron beam at the above<br>
respective amounts of dose, the GaAs layer was introduced in<br>
an ultra-high vacuum unit, and after an evacuation to the level<br>
of 10-6Pa, the temperature is raised to 600°C, and after removing<br>
an oxide layer other than Ga2O3, etching was carried out for<br>
17 minutes by introducing an AsBr3 gas under a gas partial<br>
pressure of 10~6 to 10-5Pa at 580°C.<br>
Fig. 2 to Fig. 4 show micrographs observed under an atomic<br>
force microscope (AFM) at the respective amounts of dose. Here,<br>
the respective numbers in the drawings correspond to the<br>
aforementioned respective amounts of dose.<br>
It can be understood from Fig. 2 through Fig. 4 that as<br>
the amount of dose of an electron beam increases, the line width<br>
of each pattern formed on the GaAs layer surface becomes wider.<br>
Consequently, by controlling the amount of dose of an electron<br>
beam, a circuit pattern having different line widths can be<br>
formed.<br>
In addition, Fig. 5 is a view showing a structural<br>
micrograph under an AFM indicating a difference in aspect<br>
ratios of micros true tures formed when the amounts of dose of<br>
an electron beam are different. As shown in Fig. 5, it can<br>
be understood from Fig. 5 that as the amount of dose of an<br>
electron beam increases, the aspect ratio becomes higher.<br>
Here, the respective numbers in the drawing correspond to the<br>
aforementioned respective amounts of dose of an electron beam.<br>
As in the above, by doping an electron beam into a natural<br>
oxide layer formed on the surface of a GaAs layer, chemically<br>
stable Ga203 that is not etched by a bromide can be formed, and<br>
furthermore, by controlling the amount of dose of an electron<br>
beam, it becomes possible to control the line width and aspect<br>
ratio of a pattern formed on the GaAs layer surface and carry<br>
out processing in nano-order units through a series of steps<br>
by use of an identical device. Accordingly, it becomes<br>
possible to considerably lower the manufacturing cost.<br>
As has been described in detail in the above, by the<br>
present invention, without removing a natural oxide layer<br>
naturally formed on the surface of a semiconductor crystal<br>
including a compound substrate such as an AlxGayIni_x_yAszPi_z<br>
layer, by doping an electron beam into the natural oxide layer,<br>
chemically stable Ga2O3 that is not etched by a bromide and that<br>
is high in crystallinity can be formed. Therefore, an<br>
arbitrary circuit pattern can be processed on the surface<br>
without using an etching mask at the time of etching as<br>
conventionally. Furthermore, by controlling the amount of<br>
dose of an electron beam, it becomes possible to process the<br>
line width and aspect ratio of a pattern formed on the<br>
AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer in nano-order units.<br>
Moreover, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
embodiment and example as described above. Various other<br>
embodiments and examples without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention can be made.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, it becomes possible<br>
to realize a useful element that makes the best use of various<br>
quantum device characteristics, for example, a quantum wire,<br>
a quantum box, a diffraction grating, and a micro-machine.<br>

natural oxide layer formed on the GaAs surface, then dry-etching the GaAs<br>
layer surface by a bromide in single atomic layer units, and thereby selectively<br>
removing the natural oxide layer other than the part substituted by the Ga2O3,<br>
GaAs, and AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z wherein<br>
an acceleration voltage of the electron beam is 50keV or less and the<br>
amount of dose thereof is 1016 to 1020 electron/cm2, and<br>
microstructures having different aspect ratios can be formed by an<br>
identical step by controlling the amount of dose of an electron beam by<br>
controlling the amount to be etched at the time of dry etching by controlling the<br>
amount of irradiation of the electron beam and thereby generating Ga2O3<br>
different in crystallinity on the GaAs layer surface.<br>
2. The electron beam micro/nano fabrication method as claimed in Claim<br>
1, wherein<br>
any of AsBr3, PBr3, GaBr3, and lnBr3 is used for the bromide.<br>
3. The electron beam micro/nano fabrication method as claimed in Claim<br>
1 or 2, wherein<br>
the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z layer surface is controlled on the spot in terms of<br>
an etching depth and a profile shape of a processing region in nano-order<br>
units by controlling the amount of irradiation of the electron beam.<br>
An electron beam microprocessing method is disclosed where in the surface of<br>
an AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z (0≤x, y,z≤1) layer (1) containing GaAs as a simple<br>
substance and an lnP substrate is irradiated with an electron beam (4) having<br>
abritrary electrom beam diameter and current dentisty, so that a natural oxide<br>
film (2) formed on the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z |ayer surface is selectively<br>
substituted with or formed into Ga2O3 (3), and then the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z<br>
layer surface is dry-etched using a bromide in single atom layer unit, thereby<br>
removing the natural oxide film other than the portion substituted with Ga2O3<br>
and the AlxGay ln1-x-yAszP1-z substrate.<br></td>
