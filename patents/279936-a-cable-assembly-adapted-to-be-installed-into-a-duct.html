				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a cable assembly.<br>
The present invention relates to signal transmitting cables, and relates particularly, but not exclusively, to optical cables to be installed in ducts by blowing.<br>
EP0108590 discloses a process by which optical fibre cables are installed in ducts by means of fluid drag using the blowing method. This process now represents the most significant method by which optical fibres are installed and there has been a great deal of development work aimed at optimising both the installation performance and the signal carrying performance of such cables.<br>
This installation method, which distributes the installation force evenly along the entire length of the cable,  has enabled the development of cables which do not contain any reinforcement and which are very small and lightweight. This has  brought  new  factors  into  play  which  affect  the installation performance. In particular, static electricity can create a sufficiently strong attraction between the small lightweight  cable and the  tube into which it is being installed to create very high levels of friction which might prevent satisfactory installation being achieved.<br>
There are a large number of other factors apart from friction and static electricity which affect the installation performance of a fibre optic cable. For example, the stiffness of the cable is important since the installation force is partly generated by pushing, the surface finish of the cable is important because it affects the viscous drag characteristics of the cable, and the pressure of the air and<br>
 <br>
hence the volume of air flow generated in the tube affect the installation force generated from viscous drag.<br>
GB2156837 discloses a method for improved insertion and withdrawal of an optical fibre member by propelling the fibre member by means of fluid drag through a pathway of a conduit which is obtained by the addition to the conduit material, or the sheath material of the fibre member, of an adherence reducing substance such as an antistatic agent, slip agent, or anti-block agent, or a combination of these.<br>
Attention has focussed on development of cables, as a result of which there has not been significant development of the tubes into which the cables are installed.<br>
US4740053  describes an optical  fibre  cable .comprising an inner sheath which may comprise a coating applied to the optical fibres or may be formed by an extrusion about the fibres. The inner sheath holds a plurality of optical fibres locked together in a unitary matrix. This has the benefit of providing stiffness, useful for pushing the cable into the duct in the initial phase of the process of blowing the cable into a duct. The outer sheath comprises cellular material of low density and substantially greater cross sectional area than the inner sheath. The material of the outer sheath may advantageously be chosen to accept antistatic, antifriction agents and the like, and the outer sheath is conveniently directly adhered to the inner sheath.<br>
US4952021 discloses a similar arrangement to that disclosed in US 4740053 above, but also discloses that the antistatic and antifriction agents can be incorporated in both the tube and the outermost layer of the cable. In this case seven individual fibres are first coated with a solid layer of<br>
 <br>
nylon to an outside diameter of 1 mm and then a foamed low<br>
density polyethylene outer layer is applied to achieve a<br>
final outside diameter of 2 mm. Low density polyethylene is<br>
generally selected because it foams more easily than high<br>
density polyethylene and creates a relatively soft outer<br>
layer which can be easily removed to expose the individual<br>
fibres.<br>
This  type  of  construction  is  thought  to  be  beneficial primarily because the foam outer layer provides a large increase in diameter for a small increase in weight. A foam polyethylene is usually the polymer of choice and typically the density of the material might be reduced from 0.93 gms/cc to 0.5 gms/cc.  This creates a large increase in diameter for a  relatively  small  gain in weight and also produces a slightly rough surface.  Both these create an increase in viscous drag which is directly related to the diameter of the object and also to the surface roughness.<br>
This  design  suffers  from some  significant  disadvantages, however.  The  friction  characteristics  of  low  density polyethylene  are  quite  poor  despite  the  addition  of antifriction agents.  Also, whilst the increase in diameter created by the foam outer layer increases fluid drag, it also serves to choke off the air flow down the tube as the cable is installed. This means that relatively large tubes need to be used to achieve satisfactory installation distances. The requirement is generally to use smaller tubes in order to optimise the use of already  congested networks. A further disadvantage is that manufacturing the foam outer layer is problematic with inconsistencies in from density adversely  affecting   the   optical   properties   and   hence   signal transmitting capability of the fibres.<br>
 <br>
EP0521710 discloses an alternative design for a fibre optic cable which is much more compact and is designed to provide significantly  improved  installation  performance  and  in particular allow the use of smaller tubes.   This document discloses a fibre optic cable consisting of more than one layer, where the outer surface or layer has been modified to obtain  the benefit of  increased  fluid  drag  and reduced friction. A rough surface has the benefit of increasing the' effective outside diameter without increasing the weight to the same extent as a cable of the same diameter having a smooth external surface.   Increasing the effective diameter increases  the  fluid  drag.  In  addition,  rough  surfaces intrinsically have higher fluid drag coefficients. Finally, rough surfaces reduce the number of contact points between the cable and the tube and therefore reduce friction between the  cable  and  the  tube.  All  of  these  factors  improve installation characteristics and blowing distances.<br>
However, it is also well known that manufacturing such cables with  rough  surfaces  is  problematic.  In  particular,  the attachment of glass microspheres as a means of providing a rough surface is known to cause a weakening of the surface coating,  which  can  create  fibre  break  out,  where  the individual fibres break out of the coating, causing micro-bending  and  create  unacceptable  signal  losses.  Another problem of such cables is that the microspheres can become detached, creating a potential hazard during installation by blowing.<br>
EP 646818 discloses a method for overcoming some of the disadvantages of this manufacturing technique by means of the application of three separate layers, making the process relatively complex, expensive and more difficult to control.<br>
 <br>
Also,  in the case of the prior art cables described in<br>
EP646818 and EP0521710, the different layers of the coating<br>
are bonded to each other or at least in intimate contact with<br>
each other. In order to terminate or splice the cable it is<br>
necessary to break the individual fibres out of the coating<br>
layers. The individual fibres are quite delicate and the<br>
coating layers are in intimate contact with the fibres. It is<br>
therefore important that the coating layers are relatively<br>
soft  and  easy  to  remove.  A disadvantage  of  such  soft<br>
materials, however, is that they tend to have poor friction<br>
properties compared to harder materials and are more easily<br>
damaged, in particular by abrasion during installation.<br>
US4952021 and US4740053 disclose arrangements in which all the layers of the coating are in intimate contact with neighbouring layers.  In the case of the cable of US4740053, the outer layer is conveniently directly adhered to the inner sheath.  US 4740053 states that the inner sheath is formed from a relatively high density material having a high modulus of elasticity, and also a relatively hard and tough material. US4952021 describes a cable in which seven fibres are first coated with a nylon layer,  a relatively hard and tough material.  It has been the practise therefore for such cables to be provided with a rip cord  positioned adjacent to the<br>
fibres in the centrg of the cable which could be pulled to<br>
cut open the tough inner layer so that access can be gained for terminating and splicing the individual fibres. A disadvantage of this approach, however, is that such rip cords are expensive and undesirably increase the size of the assembly.<br>
Preferred  embodiments  of  the  present  invention  seek  to overcome the above disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
 <br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a cable assembly comprising a plurality of flexible signal transmitting members surrounded by a first layer such that axial movement of at least the outermost signal transmitting members relative to said first layer is' restricted, and a continuous thermoplastic polymer second layer arranged outwardly of said first layer such that the<br>
hardness of the polymer of the second layer is greater than<br>
or equal to a Shore D hardness of 60.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that lightweight fibre optic cables with excellent optical and blowing properties can be manufactured by providing an outer layer of the cable formed from at least one polymer  material, even in the case of a smooth outer layer, if the hardness of the outer layer is sufficient. The polymer may be conveniently modified  to  provide  suitable  antistatic  and antifriction properties. This avoids the complex production problems associated with the production of a rough outer surface by the application of. glass microspheres,  foamed thermoplastics,  and the like.   This result  is surprising firstly because the high fluid drag provided by a rough outer surface is generally regarded by persons skilled in the art as essential to providing good blowing performance. Secondly, whilst the friction characteristics of the outer layer of the invention  are  good relative  to some polymers,  they are inferior to  the  prior art  arrangements,  for  example  as described  in  EP  0521710.  Very  surprisingly  the  blowing performance significantly exceeds the performance of these prior art cables.<br>
The hardness of the polymer of the second layer may be greater than or equal to a Shore hardness of 60 as measured by means of ISO R868.<br>
 <br>
The thickness of the second layer may be less than 400 microns around at least 10% of the circumference of the cable assembly.<br>
It has been found to be beneficial for the outer layer to be relatively thin and certainly thinner than the 0.5 mm of foamed low density polyethylene in the arrangement of US4952021. This has the benefit that a harder material can be used without adversely affecting the bending properties of the cable.<br>
Harder materials  provide more  robust  cables  with better resistance  to  abrasion  during  installation  and  improved protection of the fragile signal transmitting members. It is also the case that harder materials such as nylon or high density  polyethylene  have  intrinsically  better  friction properties than other polymers comprising the outer layer of other prior art cables such as low density polyethylene and acrylate polymer. Thus it may not be necessary to modify the polymer with antifriction agents considerably reducing the cost of the material of the outer layer and the cost of the process.<br>
The second layer preferably has a thickness of less than 200 microns around at least 10% of the circumference of the cable assembly.<br>
The second layer preferably has a thickness of less than 125 microns around at least 10% of the circumference of the cable assembly.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment, the second layer is adapted to be<br>
removed from said first layer by sliding over said first layer.<br>
It has also been found to be beneficial for the outer layer not to be bonded to the inner layer. Indeed it is preferable that a small gap be provided between the two layers. This has the benefit that the outer hard polymeric material can be cut and removed from the inner layer by sliding it over the inner layer,  providing  easy  access  to  the  signal  transmitting members for termination or splicing. This avoids the need ...for rip cords to longitudinally cut and remove the hard polymeric sheath. A second advantage of the small gap between the layers is that it provides an increase in diameter with no increase  in  weight,  a  desirable  property  for  providing increased fluid drag and improved installation performance.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is  provided  a  cable  assembly  comprising  a  plurality of flexible signal transmitting members surrounded by a first layer such that axial movement of at least the outermost signal transmitting members relative to said first layer is restricted,  and a continuous  thermoplastic polymer second layer arranged outwardly of said first layer and having a thickness of less than 400 microns around at least 10% of the circumference of the cable assembly.<br>
The second layer preferably has a thickness of less than 200 microns around at least 10% of the circumference of the cable assembly.<br>
The second layer preferably has a thickness of less than 125 microns around at least 10% of the circumference of the cable assembly.<br>
 <br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is  provided a cable  assembly comprising  a  plurality of flexible signal transmitting members surrounded' by a first layer such that axial movement of at least the outermost signal transmitting members relative to said first layer is restricted,  and a continuous thermoplastic polymer second layer arranged outwardly of said first layer and adapted to be removed from said first layer by sliding over said first layer.<br>
The inner periphery of said second layer may be longer than the outer periphery of said first layer to enable removal of said second layer from the assembly.<br>
The second layer may have a shore hardness greater than 60.<br>
The second layer may comprise at least one polymer material.<br>
At least one said polymer material may be a thermoplastic material.<br>
At least one said polymer may be high-density polyethylene.<br>
The flexible signal transmitting members may be embedded in said first layer.<br>

Figure 4b illustrates the speed of installation and the total installed distance of the fibre optic cable of Figure IB into a duct, compared with the performance of a prior art cable constructed with the surface modification described in EP 0521710 and EP 646818, also containing 12 fibres; and<br>
Figure 5 illustrates optical attenuation characteristics of the cable of Figure 1B over a wide range of temperatures.<br>
Referring to Figures 1A to 1D, a fibre optic cable 1 includes a core of primary coated optical fibres 2, which will be familiar to persons skilled in the art, embedded in an inner<br>
 <br>
layer 3  of acrylate material  having sufficient tensile<br>
strength when cured to lock at least the outermost fibres 2<br>
in place and still allow the fibres to be easily broken out<br>
of  the  assembly  for  termination  and  splicing  purposes.<br>
Suitable materials for this application are DSM Cabelite 950-<br>
706 and DSM Cabelite 3287-9-41. These materials are available<br>
from DSM Desotech BV. The hardness of the acrylate layer 3 is<br>
such that at least the outermost fibres 2 of the bundle are<br>
restricted from moving axially relative to the inner layer 3.<br>
The inner layer 3 is then surrounded by a loose thin jacket 4 formed from a mixture of high density polyethylene having a Shore hardness greater than or equal to 60 as measured by means of ISO R868 and a generally uniformly distributed slip agent, including a polyether modified poly (dimethylsiloxane) material such;as polyether modified hydroxy functional poly (dimethylsiloxane) material. The mixture from which the outer layer 4 is formed is compacted by means of heat and pressure. The outer layer 4 may also contain a mineral filler, such as calcium carbonate  and/or  titanium  dioxide,  in  order  to improve the stability of the dimensions of the outer layer 4 as the temperature changes.<br>
In order to manufacture the cables 1 of Figures 1A to ID, the primary coated optical fibres 2 are supplied from a bank of payoff reels (not shown), the number of reels being equal to the number of fibres 2 to be included in the cable 1. The fibres 2 are unwound with a generally constant  traction force.  The fibres 2 are then bundled together into a bundle of suitable shape, and are passed through a resin application station, where an acrylate resin forming the inner layer 3 is applied to the bundle of fibres 2, the acrylate resin being a UV-curing resin.   The coated assembly of fibres 2 is then<br>
 <br>
pulled through a series of curing ovens which cure the inner layer 3 to the desired dimensions. The above process can be carried out, for example, using a modified fibre ribbon line provided by Nextrom, Vantaa, Helsinki, Finland.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, the external coating 4, formed from a mixture of polymer and friction reducing material which has previously been compounded by means of heat and pressure,  is applied to the inner layer 3 of the coated optical fibre bundle described above by pulling the coated fibre bundle through a thermoplastic extrusion line as shown in  Figure  2.    Such  a  line  is  available  from Nextrom Technologies, Nextrom S A, Route du Bois, 37 PO Box 259, CH-1024  Ecublens-Lausanne,   Switzerland.   The   thermoplastic extrusion line 10 has a payoff stand 11 which allows the coated fibre bundle to be paid off a reel 12 at a generally steady rate.  A tensioning device 13 ensures that the coated bundle is taut before entering an extrusion crosshead 14, which  applies  the  mixture  of  high-density  polyethylene incorporating the suitable silicon slip agent to the coated bundle at a temperature between 190 degrees C and 230 degrees C.<br>
The polyethylene coated cable is then pulled through a vacuum tank 15 which applies a vacuum to the outer coating 4 by surrounding it with water, the vacuum being between lOOmbar and 50mbar, and also cools the fibre unit as it leaves the extrusion crosshead 14 .   Additional cooling is provided by pulling the cable through a water trough 16, the water being at  a  temperature  of  approximately  20  degrees  C.    A caterpillar unit 17 pulls the fibre unit through the entire thermoplastic extrusion line 10,  the cable 1 then being coiled into a pan 18 by means of a coiler 19.   It will be appreciated by persons  skilled in the art that the two<br>
 <br>
processes described above could be arranged in a single<br>
manufacturing line and the process completed in a single<br>
stage.<br>
Referring to Fig 3, this shows an apparatus for measuring the friction characteristics of the cables. Two cables, the first embodying the present invention and the second a commercially available cable with the surface modification described in EP 0521710 and EP 646818 were tested to measure their coefficient of friction relative to a tube manufactured commercially for use in blown cable applications.<br>
The test method comprises attaching a weight of 10 grammes to one end of the cable and threading the other end through tube 101, around pulley 102, through tube 103 and then through a length of tube 104. The tube 104 is a commercially available tube with outside diameter 5mm and internal diameter 3.5mm manufactured for receiving installation of cables by blowing. The tube 104 is wrapped around a wheel 105 to provide a total of 450 degrees of wrapping. After the cable has been threaded through the tube 104 it is then inserted into a haul off 106, which pulls the cable at a constant speed of 10 metres per minute. The tube 104 is clamped at both ends by clamps 107, and as the cable is pulled through the tube 104, the friction of the cable on the tube imposes a turning moment on the wheel 105 and rotates a lever 108 which imposes a load on a mass balance 109.<br>
The load on the mass balance 109 was measured for both the invention and the prior art and the coefficient of friction calculated using the formula :<br>
 <br>
Coefficient of friction is given by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
<br>
Where<br>
total wrap angle of tube (rads) F    force recorded at mass balance (N) L    Moment arm length of force F (m) T    Weight lifted by fibre (N) r    Bend radius of primary tube (m)<br>
The cable of the invention had a coefficient of friction of 0.27 whilst the cable of the prior art had a coefficient of friction of 0.21. The friction characteristics of the invention are therefore inferior compared to those of the prior art.<br>
Referring now to Figures 4a and 4b, the blowing performance of the cable,  manufactured according to the above process is assessed by measuring the speed of installation and the total distance installed of the fibre unit into a suitable duct. The comparison involves an industry standard test in which 500 metres of a commercially available tube with outside diameter 5mm and internal diameter 3.5mm manufactured for receiving installation of cables by blowing, is wound onto a drum with barrel diameter of 500 mm.<br>
In the case of Fig 4a, two fibre optic cables, the first being the cable of Figure IC (curve A) and the second a commercially available cable with the surface modification described in EP 0521710 and EP 646818 (curve B) are compared. Each of the cables contained 8 fibres arranged in their respective coatings. The cables of prior art and the invention were blown into  the  tube  using  industry  standard blowing  equipment,<br>
 <br>
compressed air at 10 bar pressure and techniques identical for both cables.<br>
In Figure 4a, the blowing performance of the two cables is compared.  It can be seen that the prior art product started to slow down after only 250 metres had .been installed. At 430 metres the installation speed had declined to only 10 m/min. The cable of the invention, on the other hand, completed the test route at a constant speed of 24 m/min.   In Figure 4b the comparison is repeated except that this time the cables each contained 12 fibres, i.e. the cable of the invention is the cable of Figure IB. In this case the prior art cable (curve D) installed just 24 metres before stopping completely whilst the cable of the invention (curve C) completed a distance of 375 metres before stopping.<br>
The blowing performance of Figures 4a and 4b represents a substantial and unexpected improvement compared to the prior art, particularly so in view of the fact that the cable of the invention has inferior friction properties and has a surface which had not been physically modified in any way to enhance fluid drag.<br>
Referring now to  Figure  5,  the  signal  loss  over a wide temperature   range   associated  with  cables  manufactured according to the above process is shown.  The different curves show signal attenuation in the individual fibres 2 of the cable of Figure IB.  It can be seen that the cable 1 can withstand exposure to a wide temperature range. This is a surprising result. Prior art cables as described in EP0157610 incorporating polyethylene outer layers display poor optical performance  below  approximately  B20  C.  This  is  usually attributed to a change of phase in polyethylene at around this<br>
 <br>
temperature and for this reason polyethylene is not normally selected for the tight jacketing of fibre optic elements.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the above embodiments have been described by way of example only, and not in any limitative sense, and that various alterations and modifications are possible with departure from the scope of the  invention  as  defined by the  appended  claims.  For example, as an alternative to, or in addition to, the friction reducing  materials  described  in  the  above  embodiments, erucamide and/or  oleamide materials may be used  as  slip agents.  Furthermore,  although  the  cable  assembly  of  the present invention  comprises an inner and an  outer  layer, however it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that it might be constructed from more than two layers.<br>
