				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a simple, efficient and cost-effective method for esterification of carboxylic acids.<br>
<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
<br>
Esterification of acids to yield esters can be performed in a number of ways. The most common method is to heat a carboxylic acid with an alcohol while removing the water that is formed. A mineral acid catalyst is usually needed to make the reaction occur at a useful rate. Generally, an excess amount of alcohol is required in these conventional methods of esterification, which adds up to the cost of the reaction.<br>
<br>
Fischer esterification, wherein esters are formed by refluxing carboxylic acid and an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst has also been used. To obtain esters, direct acylation of alcohols with carboxylic acids is preferred over acylation with anhydrides or acid chlorides. However, the major disadvantage of direct acylation is the unfavorable chemical equilibrium. Since the esterification reaction is reversible, the equilibrium needs to be remedied in order to increase the conversion rate of carboxylic acids. This has generally been done by the use of molecular sieves which are generally very expensive or by the use of excessive amounts of alcohols or constantly removing the product from the reaction system. These methods substantially increase the production cost of carboxylic esters. Organic carbonates such as Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) has also been used in Fischer esterifications. But the by products of DMC include the greenhouse gas CO2 and methanol, which is toxic.<br>
<br>
Borates, being green reagents have been increasingly used to catalyze esterification reactions. The reactions catalyzed by borates are essentially free of any toxic or harmful by-products. A borate mediated esterification of carboxylic acids in a stoichiometric ratio of 3: 1 for the carboxylic acid and the borate, m refluxing toluene has been reported (Hirao N. and Yabuuchi T., J. Pharm. Soc. Japan., 1954, 1073). Mansoori et al. (Mansoori et al.. Chin. J. Chem., 2007, 1878; Mansoori et al,. Green Chemistry, 2005, 870), report a solvent and catalyst firee borate mediated carboxylic acid esterification, in a stoichiometric ratio of 3: 1 for the carboxylic acid and the borate. However, the yields of the carboxylic acid esters obtained range from about 38% to 82%. It was surprisingly found out by our inventors that the use of acid catalysts in borate mediated esterification reactions resulted in an unexpected reduction of reaction temperatures and time as well as offered very high yield and purity of the reaction products. The recycled acid catalyst makes it possible for the subsequent reaction to proceed in the same vessel, which reduces the environmental burden to a fair degree.<br>
<br>
The present invention thus is an economical and industrially useful process, which circumvents all the drawbacks of the prior art by providing a solvent free method for borate mediated esterification wherein the yields and purities of the reaction products are more and the reaction occurs at low temperature conditions. Thus the present invention addresses the long felt need of the chemical industry for the provision of a highly efficient and cost-effective, esterification process.<br>
<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an efficacious and cost-effective borate mediated esterification method using acid catalysts.<br>
<br>
Further it is an objective of the present invention to provide a method of esterification wherein the isolated yields of esters as well as their purities are high, which eliminates the need of any further purification step.<br>
<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a method of esterification of carboxylic acids using borates under mild conditions of temperature, wherein the method is cost-effective, solvent free and consumes less time.<br>
<br>
In an embodiment, the process of esterification comprises the following steps:<br>
<br>
•	Reacting the carboxylic acid and borate in presence of acid catalyst.<br>
<br>
•	Isolating the resulting ester.<br>
 <br>
In an embodiment, carboxylic acid and tributyl borate were used in a stoichiometric ratio of about 3 equivalents of carboxylic acid to 1 equivalent of tributyl borate, particularly the ratio of 1 equivalent of carboxylic acid to 1 equivalent of tributyl borate was found useful.<br>
<br>
Scheme-h Mechanism of esterification of carboxvlic acids bv tributyl borate<br>
 <br>
In an embodiment, aromatic carboxylic acids, for example m- toluic acid were esterified with tributyl borate from about 1 eq to about 5 eq, more particularly from about 0.33 eq to about 1 eq, under catalysis by cone. H2SO4 from about 0.01 eq to about 0.5 eq, particularly from about 0.02 eq to about 0.2 eq, more particularly from about 0.05 eq to about 0.1 eq.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment, dicarboxylic acids were esterified with about 2.0 eq to about 5.0 eq DMC, particularly from about 2.5 eq to about 4.5 eq DMC, more particularly from about 3.0 eq to about 3.8 eq DMC. In another embodiment, aliphatic carboxylic acids, for example phenyl propionic acid were esterified with tributyl borate from about 1 eq to about 5 eq, more particularly from about 0.33 eq to about 1 eq, under catalysis by cone. H2SO4 from about 0.01 eq to about 0,5 eq, particularly from about 0.02 eq to about 0.2 eq. more particularly from about 0.05 eq to about 0.1 eq.<br>
<br>
In yet another embodiment, heterocyclic carboxylic acids, for example nicotinic acid and iso-nicotinic were esterified with tributyl borate from about 1 eq to about 5 eq, more particularly from about 0.33 eq to about 1 eq, under catalysis by cone. H2SO4 from about 0.01 eq to about 0.5 eq, particularly from about 0.02 eq to about 0.2 eq, more particularly from about 0.05 eq to about 0.1 eq.<br>
