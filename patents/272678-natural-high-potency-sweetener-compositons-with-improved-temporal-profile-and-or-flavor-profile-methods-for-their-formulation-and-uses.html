				<td>NATURAL HIGH-POTENCY SWEETENER COMPOSITIONS WITH<br>
IMPROVED TEMPORAL PROFILE AND/OR FLAVOR PROFILE, METHODS<br>
FOR THEIR FORMULATION, AND USES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to improving the taste of natural high-potency non-caloric or low-caloric sweeteners and compositions sweetened therewith. In particular, the present invention relates to compositions that can improve the tastes of natural high-potency non-caloric or low-caloric sweeteners by imparting a more sugar-like taste or characteristic. In particular, the compositions and methods provide a more sugar-like temporal profile, including sweetness onset and sweetness linger, and/or a more sugar-like flavor profile, including osmotic taste.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural caloric sugars, such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose are utilized heavily in beverage, food, pharmaceutical, and oral hygienic/cosmetic industries due to their _ pleasant taste. In particular, sucrose imparts a desirable taste for consumers. Although sucrose provides superior sweetness characteristics, it is caloric. While calories, are necessary for proper bodily functions, there is a need in the market to provide alternative non-caloric or low-caloric sweeteners with sugar-like taste for consumers with sedentary lifestyles or those who are calorie conscious. However, in general, non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners have associated undesirable tastes to consumers such as delayed sweetness onset; lingering sweet aftertaste; bitter taste; metallic taste; astringent taste; cooling taste; licorice-like taste; and/or the like.<br>
Natural high-potency sweeteners, such as rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, dulcoside A, dulcoside B, rubusoside, stevia, stevioside, mogroside IV, mogroside V, Luo Han Guo sweetener, siamenoside, monatin and its salts (monatin SS, RR, RS, SR), curculin, glycyrrhizic acid and its salts, thaumatin, monellin, mabinlin, brazzein, hernandulcin, phyllodulcin, glycyphyllin, phloridzin, trilobatin, baiyunoside, osladin, polypodoside A, pterocaryoside A, pterocaryoside B, mukuroziosude, phlomisoside I, periandrin I, abrusoside A, and<br>
 <br>
cyclocarioside I generally exhibit a sweet taste that has a different temporal profile, maximal response, flavor profile, mouthfeel, and/or adaptation behavior than that of sugar. For example, the sweet tastes of natural high-potency sweeteners are slower in onset and longer in duration than the sweet taste produced by sugar and thus change the taste balance of a food composition. Because of these differences, use of a natural high-potency sweetener to replace a bulk sweetener, such as sugar, in a food or beverage, causes an unbalanced temporal profile and/or flavor profile. In addition to the difference in temporal profile, high-potency sweeteners generally exhibit (i) lower maximal response than sugar, (ii) off tastes including bitter, metallic, cooling, astringent, licorice-like taste, etc., and/or (iii) sweetness which diminishes on iterative tasting. It is well known to those skilled in the art of food/beverage formulation that changing the sweetener in a composition requires re-balancing of the flavor and other taste components, (e.g., acidulants). If the taste profile of natural high-potency sweeteners could be modified to impart specific desired taste characteristics to be more sugar-like, the type and variety of compositions that may be prepared with that sweetener would be significantly expanded. Accordingly, it would be desirable to selectively modify the taste characteristics of natural high-potency sweeteners. As a result, several processes and/or compositions have been described for modifying the taste profile,,vqf beverage, food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, tobacco, arid oral hygienic/cosmetic products sweetened with non-caloric or low-caloric sugar alternative sweeteners.<br>
However, improvement in sweetness and sugar-like characters of non-caloric or low-caloric natural sweeteners to provide consumer satisfaction more like that of sucrose, fructose, or glucose still is desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
I.	Introduction<br>
Reference now will be made in detail to the presently proffered embodiments of the invention. Each example is provided by way of explanation of embodiments of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment.   Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
 <br>
invention cover such modifications and variations within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
As summarized above, this invention encompasses a natural high-potency sweetener (NHPS) composition with improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile, a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of a NHPS, NHPS sweetened compositions with improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile, and a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of NHPS sweetened compositions. In particular, this invention improves the temporal profile and/or flavor profile of a NHPS by imparting a more sugar-like temporal profile and/or flavor profile to compositions comprising a NHPS.<br>
II.       Sweet Taste<br>
A.        Sugar-Like Taste<br>
As used herein, the phrases "sugar-like characteristic," "sugar-like taste," "sugar-like sweet," "sugary," and "sugar-like" are synonymous. Sugar-like characteristics include any characteristic similar to that of sucrose and include, but are not limited to, maximal response, flavor profile, temporal profile, adaptation behavior, mouthfeel, concentration/response function, tastant/and flavor/sweet taste interactions, spatial pattern selectivity, and temperature effects. These ,6haracterisitics are dimensions in which the taste of sucrose is different from the tastes of NHPSs. Of these, however, the flavor profile and temporal profile are particularly important. In a single tasting of a sweet food or beverage, differences (1) in the attributes that constitute a sweetener's flavor profile and (2) in the rates of sweetness onset and dissipation, which constitute a sweetener's temporal profile, between those observed for sucrose and for a NHPS can be noted. Desirable embodiments of this invention exhibit a more sugar-like temporal profile, sugar-like flavor profile, or both, than compositions comprising a NHPS, but without a sweet taste improving composition. Whether or not a characteristic is more sugar-like is determined by an expert sensory panel who taste compositions comprising sugar and compositions comprising a NHPS, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition, and provide their impression as to the similarities of the characteristics of compositions comprising a NHPS, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition, with those comprising sugar. A suitable procedure for determining whether a composition has a more sugar-like taste is described in embodiments described hereinbelow.<br>
 <br>
In a particular embodiment, a panel of assessors is used to measure the reduction of sweetness linger. Briefly described, a panel of assessors (generally 8 to 12 individuals) is trained to evaluate sweetness perception and measure sweetness at several time points from when the sample is initially taken into the mouth until 3 minutes after it has been expectorated. Using statistical analysis, the results are compared between samples containing additives and samples that do not contain additives. A decrease in score for a time point measured after the sample has cleared the mouth indicates there has been a reduction in sweetness perception.<br>
The panel of assessors may be trained using procedures well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a particular embodiment, the panel of assessors may be trained using the Spectrum™ Descriptive Analysis Method (Meilgaard et al, Sensory Evaluation Techniques, 3rd edition, Chapter 11). Desirably, the focus of training should be the recognition of and the measure of the basic tastes; specifically, sweet. In order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results, each assessor should repeat the measure of the reduction of sweetness linger about three to about five times per sample, taking at least a five minute break between each repetition and/or sample and rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.<br>
Generally, the method of measuring sweetness comprises taking a 10 mL sample into the mouth, holding the sample in the mouth for 5 seconds and gently swirling the sample in the mouth, rating the sweetness intensity perceived at 5 ' seconds, expectorating the sample (without swallowing following expectorating the sample), rinsing with one mouthful of water (e.g., vigorously moving water in mouth as if with mouth wash) and expectorating the rinse water, rating the sweetness intensity perceived immediately upon expectorating the rinse water, waiting 45 seconds and, while waiting those 45 seconds, identifying the time of maximum perceived sweetness intensity and rating the sweetness intensity at that time (moving the mouth normally and swallowing as needed), rating the sweetness intensity after another 10 seconds, rating the sweetness intensity after another 60 seconds (cumulative 120 seconds after rinse), and rating the sweetness intensity after still another 60 seconds (cumulative 180 seconds after rinse). Between samples take a 5 minute break, rinsing well with water to clear the mouth.<br>
In order to clarify the nature of preferred embodiments of this invention, some further explanation of the differences in flavor and temporal profiles between that of<br>
 <br>
sugar and NHPSs may be helpful.  While not wishing to be bound by theory, this further explanation is as follows.<br>
B.       Flavor Profile<br>
The flavor profile of a sweetener is a quantitative profile of the relative intensities of all of the taste attributes exhibited. Such profiles often are plotted as histograms or radar plots. Sucrose, heretofore, has been accepted as exhibiting only sweetness and generally is employed as a standard for pure sweet taste quality. Most high-potency sweeteners exhibit other qualities of taste in addition to sweetness. Thus, as an example, saccharin, which is a synthetic sweetener, has been found to exhibit both bitter and metallic off tastes. As another example, cyclamate exhibits bitter and salty off tastes. For another example, stevioside and hernandulcin, both NHPSs also have a bitter off taste. Other taste attributes commonly observed for high-potency sweeteners include cooling and licorice-like, and an occasional astringent taste.<br>
It has been discovered, however, that sucrose exhibits a taste attribute, or perhaps even attributes, beyond sweetness. The attributes bitter, sour, salty and umami do not describe it. Nonetheless, its taste is easily discerned from that of high-potency sweeteners exhibiting only sweetness (e.g., aspartame) within the first few seconds of tasting. Thus the taste of. sucrose is unique among sweeteners, even among those which-do not exhibit any of the "off'tastes noted above.<br>
In the literature, this unique taste character of sucrose has been referred to in various ways. Terms such as "mouthfeel" and "body" often are used, both terms suggestive of viscosity or other tactile sensations. "Mouthfeel" also can refer to the texture, body, physical, and overall feel a human consumer detects in his or her mouth when tasting the composition. Thus, for example, a sugar-like mouthfeel refers to texture, body, physical, and overall feel similar to that of sugar. However, it is believed now that the unique taste of sucrose relative to that of high-potency sweeteners is not a tactile sensation. A plausible explanation for the unique taste of sucrose as well as other carbohydrate sweeteners is that hyperosmotic solutions induce rapid and sustained decreases in taste bud cell volumes. Specific effects accompany the taste bud cell shrinkage, including enhanced signaling from salt-sensitive taste bud cells in response to NaCl and signaling from sour-sensitive taste bud cells even in the absence of acid.<br>
 <br>
Although effects on sweet-sensitive taste bud cells were hot evaluated, this suggests that sucrose, and carbohydrate sweeteners in general, must elicit taste responses by a pathway in addition to that mediated by the sweetener receptor T1R2/T1R3. This additional pathway likely is mediated by the taste bud cell shrinkage induced by the hyperosmotic character of sugar solutions. Thus, the unique taste of sucrose likely derives from a superimposition of these two pathways of signaling. Sucrose is not perceived as sour or salty nor, for that matter, bitter or umami either. However, it seems that the unique taste of sucrose is derived from signaling to the brain by taste bud cells which normally signal distinct modalities (e.g., strong signaling from sweet-sensitive cells, weak signaling from sour-sensitive cells, weak signaling from salt-sensitive cells, etc.). It is believed that this pattern of activity is in significant part responsible for the unique taste of sucrose. In summary, it appears that sucrose is not only a pure sweet stimulus, but also exhibits a second taste attribute, and the superimposition of these two attributes constitutes "sucrose taste." Given that this second taste attribute of sucrose is due to its osmotic character, it is referred to herein as "osmotic taste."<br>
Consistent with the line of reasoning developed above, the osmotic taste of sucrose can be observed in the absence of sucrose sweetness. Lactisole is a well known sweetness inhibitor, and if sucrose is tasted at 10% (w/v) in the presence of lactisole at 0.2% (w/v), the osmotic taste character of sucrose can be observed uncomplicated by the presence of intense sweetness. The taste of this sucrose/lactisole formulation exhibits faint sweetness, faint sourness, as well as "thickness" or "body." NHPSs do not exhibit osmotic taste and accordingly will not reproduce the flavor profile of sucrose unless additives which reproduce the osmolarity of the sucrose solution targeted without off taste are included.<br>
In principle, any level of osmolarity higher than that of normal saliva exhibits at least some osmotic taste in the mouth. Average concentrations of inorganic ions present in saliva, which are responsible for nearly all of the osmolarity of saliva, are as illustrated in Table 1 below. From the data shown, it is clear that saliva typically has an osmolarity of 70mOsM. Sucrose at 10%, however, is 292 mOsM, more than 4-fold higher, and therefore will cause significant shrinkage of taste bud cell volume and signaling to the central nervous system (CNS).<br>
 <br>
9 Table <br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In the foregoing, it is suggested that the unique taste of sucrose is an outcome of two pathways of taste bud cell signaling, the first pathway proceeding only by activation of sweet-sensitive taste bud cells by direct action at the sweetener receptor T1R2/T1R3, and the second pathway proceeding by activation of several taste bud cell subtypes (e.g., sweet-:, sour- and salt-sensitive taste bud cells) by a mechanism mediated by cell shrinkage due to the increased osmolarity of the sucrose stimulus. While this is believed to be the case, it could be that the complete explanation for the unique taste of sucrose is still somewhat more complicated. It is known that the sweetener receptor T1R2/T1R3 is a heterodimeric receptor constituted of two proteins associated with each other where each of them contains an extracellular domain generally referred to as the Venus Flytrap Domain (VFD). Evidence has been provided that sucrose binds in both VFDs to activate the receptor. At the same time, it is known that high-potency sweeteners bind differently. Thus, aspartame and neotame bind only to the VFD of TjR2 while, at the same time, cyclamate does not bind in either VFD domain, but rather binds in the transmembrane domain of T1R3. The activated T1R2/T1R3 receptor which follows from sucrose stimulation through binding in both VFDs will be somewhat different in shape from that of activated receptors which derive from the quite different binding of high-potency sweeteners. Thus, complete reproduction of sucrose taste with non-caloric sweeteners also may require simultaneous binding of sweeteners in both VFDs of T1R2/T1R3,<br>
 <br>
C.        Temporal Profile<br>
L	Sweetness Onset and Linger<br>
Sucrose exhibits a sweet taste in which the maximal response is perceived quickly and where perceived sweetness disappears relatively quickly on swallowing a food or beverage. In contrast, the sweet tastes of essentially all high-potency sweeteners reach their maximal responses somewhat more slowly and they then decline in intensity more slowly than is the case for sucrose. This decline in sweetness is often referred to as "Sweetness Linger" and is a major limitation for high-potency sweeteners including NHPSs. Slow onset of sweetness also can be a problem. In general, however, sweetness linger is a more significant problem. And so, preferred embodiments of this invention exhibit significant reductions in sweetness linger. As used herein, "temporal profile" of a composition means the intensity of sweetness perceived over time in tasting of the composition by a human. As explained above, the sweet taste of sugar, as well as other carbohydrate and polyol sweeteners, has a quick onset followed by a rapid decrease in sweetness, whereas a NHPS typically has a slower sweet taste onset than sugar followed by a sweetness linger that is longer than sugar.<br>
It is believed that most, if not all, NHPSs bind nonspecifically throughout 
 <br>
Thus, in particularly desirable embodiments of this invention, the combination of a NHPS with certain sweet taste improving additives reduces the nonspecific binding of non-caloric sweeteners to membranes of cells in the oral cavity. Particularly, certain of the sweet taste improving additives are hyperosmotic stimuli and cause shrinkage of epithelial and taste bud cell membranes, thus retarding the ability of the membranes to engage in non-specific absorption of NHPSs. Particularly desirable sweet taste improving additives increase osmolarity without introducing excessive off taste.<br>
In addition, particularly desirable sweet taste improving additives reduce sweetness linger by retarding the rate of egress of non-specifically absorbed high-potency sweeteners from cell membranes. For example, polymers that bind to the surfaces of cells so as to reduce the fluidities of celi membranes are effective in this manner.<br>
According to still other embodiments of this invention, sweetness linger of a NHPS is masked by the presence of other ingredients which exhibit lingering taste characteristics. For example, NHPSs can be combined with food acids (e.g., acidulants such as citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, and adipic acid) which exhibit sourness that lingers relative to that of mineral acids (e.g., H3PO4), astringent compounds, and other compounds which introduce lingering sensory notes. These embodiments overlay the^ objectionable sweetness linger with sourness linger and other vsf||gering characteristics such that the overall taste remains in balance over time.<br>
2.	Inhibiting The Nonspecific Binding Of NHPS By Taste Bud And<br>
Epithelial Cells<br>
Again, without being bound by theory, high osmolarity solutions improve the temporal profile of NHPSs to be more sugar-like. NHPSs normally exhibit slow sweetness onset and lingering sweetness. The high osmolarity nature of sucrose and other carbohydrate or polyol sweetener solutions contributes to the sweet taste sensation. It generally is known that (i) high osmolarity solutions cause marked shrinkage of taste bud cells and (ii) taste bud cells absorb and/or adsorb high-potency sweeteners of a variety of chemical structures. Thus, it is hypothesized that high osmolarity solutions cause tightened packing of membrane lipid molecules in taste bud cells as well as in other epithelial cells in the oral cavity and thereby diminish the abilities of such cells to absorb NHPSs. Therefore, any compounds which impart osmolarities sufficient to affect the taste bud and epithelial cell membranes should diminish non-specific binding and thereby<br>
 <br>
would cause NHPSs to exhibit sweetness with more sugar-like temporal profiles. In one embodiment, any sweet taste improving composition that imparts increased osmolarity will be effective by this mechanism.<br>
3.	Inhibit The Rate Of Egress Of NHPS From Taste Bud And<br>
Epithelial Cells And Their Membranes<br>
Another pathway whereby temporal profiles of NHPSs may be improved is<br>
to slow the rates of egress of absorbed sweeteners from the taste bud and epithelial cells<br>
and their membranes.   Thus, in one embodiment, sweet taste improving compositions<br>
which reduce the fluidity of the cell membranes improve the temporal profile of NHPS to<br>
be more sugar-like.    Non-limiting examples of compositions which slow the rates of<br>
egress of absorbed sweeteners from the taste bud and epithelial cells and their membranes<br>
include sweet taste improving surfactant additives, sweet taste improving cationic polymer<br>
additives, sweet taste improving hydrocolloid additives, and other sweet taste improving<br>
polymer additives. In yet another embodiment, suitable compositions which slow the rates<br>
of egress of absorbed sweeteners • from the taste bud and epithelial cells and their<br>
membranes include, but are not limited to, cationic polymeric agents such as poly-L-<br>
lysines  (e.g.,  poly-L-a-lysine  and poly-L-e-Iysine),  poly-L-orthinine  (e.g.,  poly-L-a-<br>
ornithine. ;and poly-L-fcornithine), polyethylenimine, and chitosan, as well as surface<br>
active compositions including sucrose esters, sorbic acid esters, sorbitan, sorbitarr esters,'<br>
anionic 'detergents, polysorbatSs, polyethylene sorbitan estejrs, jiropy^ae glyjjol esters,<br>
glycerol esters, polyglycerol esters, polyethylene esters, complex esters, (e.g., lactate,<br>
tartrate, and the like), cationic detergents, gum acacia Senegal, gum acacia seyal, anionic<br>
polymers (e.g., polyaspartic acid), polyethylene glycol, lecithins, and saponins.    The<br>
polymeric agents are hypothesized to bind to cell surfaces and engage in multiple points of<br>
binding contact and reduce the fluidity of the cell membranes.<br>
II.        NHPS Sweetener And Sweetened Compositions<br>
It has been discovered that at least one NHPS and/or modified NHPS in combination with at least one sweet taste improving composition imparts a more sugarlike taste. In a desired embodiment, a composition and method with an improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile are provided. In another embodiment, NHPS-sweetened compositions with a more sugar-like temporal profile and/or flavor profile<br>
 <br>
comprising a sweetenable composition, at least one NHPS and/or at least one modified NHPS, and at least one sweet taste improving composition are provided.<br>

and an aqueous organic or organic solvent, wherein the solid comprises the substantially<br>
pure rebaudioside A composition and is soluble only sparingly in the aqueous organic or<br>
organic solvent. In an embodiment, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition<br>
and aqueous organic solvent are present in the slurry in a weight ratio ranging from about<br>
15 parts to 1 part aqueous organic solvent to 1 part substantially pure rebaudioside A<br>
composition. In one embodiment, the slurry is maintained at room temperature. In<br>

In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition from the aqueous organic or organic solvent of the slurry and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition followed by the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition.<br>
If further purification is desired, the method of purifying rebaudioside A described herein may be repeated or the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be purified further using an alternative purification method, such as the column chromatography.<br>
It also is contemplated that other NHPSs may be purified using the purification method described herein, requiring only minor experimentation that would be<br>
 <br>
obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The purification of rebaudioside A by crystallization as described above results in the formation of at least four different polymorphs: Form 1: a rebaudioside A hydrate; Form 2: an anhydrous rebaudioside A; Form 3: a rebaudioside A solvate; and Form 4: an amorphous rebaudioside A. The aqueous organic solution and temperature of the purification process influence the resulting polymorphs in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. Figures 1-5 are exemplary powder x-ray diffraction (XRPD) scans of polymorphs Form 1 (hydrate), Form 2 (anhydrate), Form 3 A (methanol solvate), Form 3B (ethanol solvate), and Form 4 (amorphous), respectively.<br>
The material properties of the four rebaudioside A polymorphs are summarized in the following table:<br>
Table 2: Rebaudioside A Polymorphs<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The type of polymorph formed is dependent on the composition of the aqueous organic solution, the temperature of the crystallization step, and the temperature during the drying step. Form 1 and Form 3 are formed during the single crystallization step while Form 2 is formed during the drying step after conversion from Form 1 or Form 3.<br>
Low temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 20°C to about 50°C, and a low ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of Form 3. High temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 50°C to about 80°C, and a high ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of the Form 1. Form 1 can be converted to Form 3 by slurrying in an anhydrous solvent at room temperature (2-16 hours) or at reflux for approximately (0.5-3 hours). Form 3 can be converted to Form 1 by slurrying the polymorph in water at room temperature for approximately 16 hours or at reflux for approximately 2-3 hours.   Form 3 can be converted to the Form 2 during the<br>
 <br>
drying process; however, increasing either the drying temperature above 70°C or the drying time of a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can result in decomposition of the rebaudioside A and increase the remaining rebaudioside B impurity in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. Form 2 can be converted to Form 1 with the addition of water.<br>
Form 4 may be formed from Form 1, 2, 3, or combinations thereof, using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of such methods include melt-processing, ball milling, crystallization, lypophiiization, cryogrinding, and spray drying. In a particular embodiment, Form 4 can be prepared from a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition obtained by the purification methods described hereinabove by spray-drying a solution of the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition.<br>

In one embodiment, combinations of the at least one NHPS and at least one sweet taste improving composition suppress, reduce, or eliminate undesirable taste and impart,sugar-like characteristics to the NHPS composition. As used herein, the phrase "undesirable taste" includes any taste property which is not imparted by sugars such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, or similar saccharides. Non-limiting examples of undesirable tastes include delayed sweetness onset, lingering sweet aftertaste, metallic taste, bitter taste, cooling sensation taste or menthol-like taste, licorice-like taste, and/or the like.<br>
In another embodiment, at least one NHPS is combined with a plurality of sweet taste improving additives, desirably 3 or more sweet taste improving additives, and even more desirably 4 or more sweet taste improving additives, wherein each sweet taste improving additive is present in an amount such that no one sweet taste improving additive imparts a substantial off taste to the NHPS composition. In other words, the amounts of the sweet taste improving additives in the NHPS composition are balanced so that no one sweet taste improving additive imparts a substantial off taste to the NHPS composition. Desirably, each of the plurality of sweet taste improving additives is present in the NHPS composition in an amount which imparts an osmlarity ranging from 10 to 100 mOsmoles/L to a sweetenable composition, but the combination of sweet improving additives imparts an osmolarity ranging from about 10 mOsmoles/L to about 500 mOsmoles/L to a sweetenable composition.<br>

3.	Tabletop Compositions<br>
In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the NHPS compositions comprise a tabletop sweetener composition comprising at least one NHPS in combination with at least one bulking agent and optionally at least one sweet taste improving composition and/or anti-caking agent with improved temporal and/or flavor profile.<br>
In accordance with particular embodiments, suitable "bulking agents" include maltodextrin (10 DE, 18 DE, or 5 DE), corn syrup solids (20 or 36 DE), sucrose, fructose, glucose, invert sugar, sorbitol, xylose, ribulose, mannose, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol, erythritol, maltitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltose, tagatose, lactose, inulin, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyols, polydextrose, fructooligosaccharides, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Additionally, in accordance with still other embodiments of the invention, granulated sugar (sucrose) or other caloric sweeteners such as crystalline fructose, other carbohydrates, or sugar alcohol can be used as a bulking agent due to their provision of good content uniformity without the addition of significant calories. In one embodiment, a bulking agent may be used as a sweet taste improving composition.<br>
As used herein the phrase "anti-caking agent" and "flow agent" refer to any composition which prevents, reduces, inhibits, or suppresses at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener molecule from attaching, binding, or contacting to<br>
 <br>
another natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener molecule. Alternatively, anti-caking agent may refer to any composition which assists in content uniformity and uniform dissolution. In accordance with particular embodiments, non-limiting examples of anti-caking agents include cream of tartar, calcium silicate, silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel, FMC BioPolymer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and tricalcium phosphate. In one embodiment, the anti-caking agents are present in the tabletop functional sweetener composition in an amount from about 0.001 to about 3 % by weight of the tabletop functional sweetener composition.<br>
Tabletop NHPS compositions are embodied and packaged in numerous different forms and it is intended that the tabletop NHPS compositions of the present invention may be of any form known in the art. In accordance with particular embodiments, non-limiting examples include powder form, granular form, packets, tablets, sachets, pellets, cubes, solids, and liquids.<br>
In an embodiment, a tabletop NHPS composition comprises a single-serving (portion control) packet comprising a dry-blend of a functional sweetener formulation. Dry-blend formulations generally may comprise powder or granules. Although the tabletop NHPS composition may be in a packet of any size, an illustrative non-limiting example of conventional portion control tabletop sweetener packets are approximately 2.5 by 1.5 inches and hold approximately 1 gram of a sweetener composition having a sweetness equivalent to 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar (~ 8 g). The amount of NHPS in a dry-blend tabletop NHPS formulation will vary due to the varying potency of different NHPSs. In a particular embodiment, a dry-blend tabletop NHPS formulation may comprise a NHPS in an amount from about 1 % (w/w) to about 10 % (w/w) of the tabletop NHPS composition.<br>
Solid tabletop NHPS embodiments include cubes and tablets. A non-limiting example of conventional cubes are equivalent in size to a standard cube of granulated sugar, which is approximately 2.2 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm3 and weigh approximately 8 g. In one embodiment, a solid tabletop sweetener is in the form of a tablet or any other form known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A tabletop NHPS composition also may be embodied in the form of a liquid, wherein the NHPS is combined with a liquid carrier.    Suitable non-limiting<br>
 <br>
examples of carrier agents for liquid tabletop functional sweeteners include water, alcohol, polyol, glycerin base or citric acid base dissolved in water, and mixtures thereof. Due to the varying potencies of the different high-potency sweeteners, the amount of high-potency sweetener in a liquid tabletop NHPS formulation will also vary. The sweetness equivalent of a tabletop NHPS composition for any of the forms described herein or known in the art may be varied to obtain a desired sweetness profile. For example, a tabletop NHPS composition may comprise a sweetness comparable to that of an equivalent amount of standard sugar. In another embodiment, the tabletop NHPS composition may comprise a sweetness of up to 100 times that of an equivalent amount of sugar. In another embodiment, the tabletop NHPS composition may comprise a sweetness of up to 90 times, 80 times, 70 times, 60 times, 50 times, 40 times, 30 times, 20 times, 10 times, 9 times, 8 times, 7 times, 6 times, 5 times, 4 times, 3 times, and 2 times that of an equivalent amount of sugar.<br>
In one embodiment, the tabletop NHPS composition also may be formulated for targeted uses, for example, in beverage, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, herbal/vitamins, tobacco, and in any other products which may be sweetened. For example, a tabletop NHPS composition for baking may be formulated having additional protecting agents such as encapsulants. Other forms will be readily apparent to those skilled in the tabletop sweetener art.<br>
Commonly used methods for making poVder or granulated NHPS formulations for packets include fluid bed agglomeration processes. Other methods for making tabletop sweetener compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Those skilled in the art appreciate that the amount of NHPS and amount and types of sweet taste improving composition, bulking agent, and/or anti-caking agent can be modified in order to tailor the taste of the tabletop sweetener composition to a desired profile and end use.<br>

As explained hereinabove, sweetened compositions in accordance with embodiments of this invention comprise a sweetenable composition, at least one NHPS and/or at least one modified NHPS, and at least one sweet taste improving composition. A multitude of suitable sweetenable compositions are described hereinabove.<br>
Generally, the amount of NHPS present in a sweetened composition varies widely depending on the particular type of sweetened composition and its desired sweetness. Those of ordinary skill in the art can readily discern the appropriate amount of sweetener to put in the sweetened composition. In a particular embodiment, the at least one NHPS is present in the sweetened composition in an amount in the range of about 1 to about 5,000 ppm of the sweetened composition, and the at least one sweet taste improving composition is present in the sweetened composition in an amount in the range of about 0.1 to about 100,000 ppm of the sweetened composition.<br>
In accordance with particular embodiments, suitable amounts of NHPSs for sweetenable compositions comprise amounts in the range from about 100 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for rebaudioside A; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for stevia; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for stevioside; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for morgroside IV; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for morgroside V; from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for Luo Han Guo sweetener; from about 5 ppm to about 300 ppm for monatin, from about 5 ppm to about 200 ppm for curculin; and from about 50 ppm to about 3,000 ppm for mono-ammonium glycyrrhizic acid salt hydrate.<br>
In one particular embodiment, an orally ingestible composition comprises a carbonated beverage comprising at least one NHPS and at least one sweet taste improving composition; wherein the at least one NHPS is chosen from rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, dulcoside A, dulcoside B, rubusoside, stevia, stevioside, mogroside IV, mogroside V, Luo Han Guo sweetener, siamenoside, monatin and its salts (monatin SS, RR, RS, SR), curculin, glycyrrhizic acid and its salts, thaumatin, monellin, mabinlin, brazzein, hernandulcin, phyllodulcin, glycyphyllin, phloridzin, trilobatin, baiyunoside, osladin, polypodoside A, pterocaryoside<br>
 <br>
A, pterocaryoside B, mukurozioside, phlomisoside I, periandrin I, abrusoside A, cyclocarioside I, or combinations thereof; and wherein the at least one sweet taste improving composition is selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, polyols, amino acids and their corresponding salts, polyamino acids and their corresponding salts, sugar acids and their corresponding salts, organic acids, inorganic acids, organic salts, inorganic salts, bitter compounds, flavorants, astringent compounds, polymers, proteins or protein hydrolysates, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavonoids, alcohols, and combinations thereof.<br>
IV.      Examples<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description therein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention and/or the scope of the appended claims. Unless otherwise specified, %'s are by weight.<br>
A.        Example A<br>
An exemplary method of sensory evaluation is provided in the following protocol, similar to that described hereinabove. Jn this test protocol, none of the samples were swallowed. All samples were expectorated and the mouth was rinsed with water after the tasting. In step 1, the 10% sucrose control sample was tasted by distributing ca. 10 mL of sample quickly throughout the oral cavity, wherein the maximal "Sweetness Intensity" was measured. This intensity is defined as a 10 on a 0-15 scale where 0 is defined as no perceptible sweetness and 15, the sweetness of 15% sucrose. Immediately upon sensing maximal sweetness, the sample was expectorated, the mouth was rinsed with water and the rate of sweetness decay ("Sweetness Linger") was measured, where attention was focused on the sweetness 3-4 min after the water rinse. The sweetness linger was rated by a panel of experts in the sensory evaluation of foods and beverages using the following scale: 0 = no sweetness linger, 1 = very slight sweetness linger, 2 = slight sweetness linger, 3 = moderate sweetness linger, 4 = moderately high sweetness linger, 5 = high sweetness linger.   After sample tasting was complete, a salty oyster cracker was<br>
 <br>
chewed followed by a water rinse, and at least 5 minutes followed before tasting the next sample.<br>
The "Sweetness Linger" rating for sucrose observed by this protocol was defined as 0. Experimental samples were tasted by the same protocol, always allowing sufficient time between samples to ensure re-equilibration of the sensory system. Re-tasting of control samples during the course of the experiment was allowed and encouraged.<br>
The comparison taste test was performed between two controls and addition of sweet taste improving additive on the onset and/or sweetness linger.<br>
B.        Example Set B<br>
Where there are ranges provided in the examples, a number of beverages comprising the NHPS, such as rebaudioside-A (REBA), were made 5-7 levels from the top to the bottom range, using a 1:1 dilution of the corresponding sweet taste improving • compositions. The sweetness linger rating reported was the most sugar-like in sweetness linger (the lowest numerical value) attained of all the samples (i.e., the shortest sweetness linger). The tasting protocol and sensory scores described in the exemplary protocol of Example A were used in the Examples of Set B.<br>

§weet taste improving compositions were combined with a REBA solution to determine their effect on sweetness linger. Screening of the initial sample, or further dilutions, allowed identification of concentrations which were just above-threshold, herein defined as "near-threshold concentrations." The near-threshold additive concentrations, a 6- to 100-fold higher higher additive concentration (depending on the off-taste intensity), and a mid-level additive concentration (halfway between the near-threshold and higher additive concentration) were evaluated to determine the effect on sweetness linger of a REBA solution.<br>
