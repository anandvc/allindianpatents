				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  Improved  Block  for   the construction of Verge provided on roads, highways or Construction sites.<br>
A Verge of a suitable width and height is generally provided on roads, highways or Construction sites which serves to :<br>
1.	Prevent mixing of vehicular traffic moving in the two lanes<br>
of the road or high-way.<br>
2.	Prevent Head-on collosions of vehicles moving on the road or<br>
the high-way in the opposite directions.<br>
3.	Maintain proper lane traffic control.<br>
4.	Provide a place for fixing of  road devider fences for<br>
preventing crossing of road or high-way by pedesterains.<br>
5.	Provide a linear place for planting green plants for reducing<br><br>
pollution generated by automobile exhaust.<br>
Originally brick or stone masonary was used for construction of Central and Side Verges (also known as Median Parapets and Edge Parapets respectively).<br>
The handicap of the Central or Side verges constructed of brick or stone masonary was that since construction quality  of  masonary work was beyond proper control and doing the required curing  was difficult,  the brick or stone masonary constructed Verges faced easy  damages  due to even a mild impact of the  moving vehicle. Repairing of the often damaged Verge was also difficult and also hazardous  due to constant flow of vehicular  traffic  and the possibility  of accidents during the repair work being done by the labourers.<br><br>
o  obviate  the  handicaps of  the brick  or  stone  masonary constructed Central or Side Verges, Blocks made of natural stones out and joined using  concrete/cement mortars  were used.  These locks suffered from the problems of poor impact resistance  and tracking at natural fracture lines.<br>
Pre-cast blocks of plain cement concrete casted using manual  mixing  and filling in moulds and in  some  cases  partly vibration induced, are being used. Large numbers of these concrete or stone blocks are being used by PWD, City Corporations and Highways authorities  and  other construction project  authorities in various States in the Country.<br>
The poor quality control, improper mix design and improper casting techniques and  curing have resulted in poor  strengh of  these blocks and their early damages on slightest  automobile  impact. These blocks are un-reinf orced in most of the cases and are also produced using local labour and non-mechanised casting methods. In some cases while the external surface of the blocks is provided with  better  quality of concrete/mortar , for  the  interior  of these blocks, poor quality of concrete is used.<br>
Another handicap of the conventional Pre-cast cement concrete blocks is that the outer surface of the cast blocks being made of cement concrete, is non- reflecting of light. Consequently the drivers of the automobiles driving at high speed at night find it quite difficult to properly locate the Central or side Verge provided on the road or highway leading to serious accidents.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an Improved Block for the construction of the Central or side Verge on the road or highway which Blocks have a light refecting surface<br>
whereby accidents due to impact of the moving vehicles with the Central or Side Verge are avoided.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides Improved Block for the construction of Verge provided on roads or highways or construction sites which consists of three portions, the lower portion is adapted to be inserted into the ground surface of the road or highway, the middle and the top portions of the Block remain above the ground surface of the road or highway and and a part of the top portion of the Block is placed at an angle of 20 degrees to 60 degrees to its base line.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the surface of the  angular part of the top portion  of the Block is coated with any conventional light reflecting paint to provide a better reflection of light by the Block.<br>
The top portion of the Improved Block provides additional height and its angular part reflects the light falling on it from the head-lights of the automobiles moving on the road/highway helps the drivers of the automobile driving at night or during fog to properly locate the Central or Side Verge thereby avoiding accidents at night.<br>
The  Improved Block  for the construction of  the Verge on the road or  highway,  according to  the present invention,  is<br>
illustrated in the accompany drawings wherein the lower portion of the Improved Block is indicated as "A", the middle portion is indicated as 'B', the top portion is indicatedas 'C' and the part of the top portion placed at an angle of 20 degrees to 60 degrees to its base line is indicated as 'D'.<br>
In operation, the lower portion 'A' of the Improved Block is inserted into the ground surface of the road/highway. The middle portion 'B' and the top portion 'c' with its part 'D' placed at an angle of 20 degrees to 60 degrees to its base line, remains above the grond surface of the road/highway.<br>
The top portion of the Improved Block provides a longer distance visibility. At night, when the light from the head-lights of the moving automobiles falls on the angular part 'D' of the top portion of the Block, it provides reflecion/illumination even when the automobile is being driven straight, indicating to the driver of the automobile a clear and precise location of the Central verge provided on the road/highway. This would enable the drivers of the automobiles driving at high speed at night or during foggy days to avoid hitting the Central Verge provided on the road/highway thereby avoiding accidents.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, when the surface of the angular part of the top portion of the Block is coated with any conventional light reflecting paint, it provides a better reflection of light falling on it from the head-lights of the moving automobiles and would be more helpful to the drivers of<br>
the automobiles driving at night to precisely locate the presence of the Central/Side Verge  provided  on  the  road/highway  and thereby avoid hitting it to prevent accidents.<br>
The improved Block can also be fixed as individual units at road turnings, Construction sites and foot of hills for avoiding accidents.<br><br><br><br><br>
Claim<br>
1 An improved Block for the construction of Verge provided on roads or highways or Construction sites, which consists of three portions, the lower portion is adapted to be inserted into the ground surface of the road or highway, the middle and the top portions of the Block remain above the ground surface of the road or highway and a part of the top portion of the Block is placed at an angle of 20 degrees to 60 degrees to its base line.<br>
2.	The  improved  Block as claimed in claim  1   wherein  the<br>
surface of the angular part of the top portion of the Block<br>
is coated with any conventional light reflecting paint.<br>
3.	The  improved Block for the construction of Verge  provided<br>
on roads or highways or Construction sites substantially as<br>
herein  described and  illustrated  in  the  accompanying .<br></td>
