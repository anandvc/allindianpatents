LIVE ATTENUATED ROTAVIRUS VACCINE FOR<br>
ORAL ADMINISTRATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel liquid rotavirus formulations that are useful as<br>
pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines, to method for preparing them and to their use<br>
in preventing rotavirus, in particular human rotavirus associated diseases.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Acute, infectious diarrhoea is a leading cause of disease and death in many areas of the<br>
world. In developing countries, the impact of diarrhoeal disease is very important. For<br>
Asia, Africa and Latin America, it has been estimated that there are between 3-4 billion<br>
cases of diarrhoea each year and of those cases about 5-10 million result in death<br>
(Walsh, J.A. et al.: N. Engl. J. Med., 301:967-974 (1979)).<br>
Rotaviruses have been recognised as one of the most important causes of severe<br>
diarrhoea in infants and young children (Estes, M.K. Rotaviruses and Their Replication in<br>
Fields Virology, Third Edition, edited by Fields et al., Raven Publishers, Philadelphia,<br>
1996). It is estimated that rotavirus disease is responsible for over 600,000 deaths<br>
annually. Rotavirus-induced illness most commonly affects children between 6 and 24<br>
months of age, and the peak prevalence of the disease generally occurs during the cooler<br>
months in temperate climates, and year-round in tropical areas. Rotaviruses are typically<br>
transmitted from person to person by the faecal-oral route with an incubation period of<br>
from about 1 to about 3 days. Unlike infection in the 6-month to 24-month age group,<br>
neonates are generally asymptomatic or have only mild disease. In contrast to the severe<br>
disease normally encountered in young children, most adults are protected as a result of<br>
previous rotavirus infection so most adult infections are mild or asymptomatic (Offit, P.A.<br>
et al. Comp. Then, 8(8):21-26,1982).<br>
Rotaviruses are spherical, and their name is derived from their distinctive outer and inner<br>
or double-shelled capsid structure. Typically, the double-shelled capsid structure of a<br>
rotavirus surrounds an inner protein shell or core that contains the genome. The genome<br>
of a rotavirus is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA which encode at least<br>
11 distinct viral proteins. Two of these viral proteins designated as VP4 (P protein) and<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
VP7 (G protein) are structural proteins arranged on the exterior of the double-shelled<br>
capsid structure. The inner capsid of the rotavirus presents one protein, which is the<br>
rotavirus protein designated VP6. The relative importance of these three particular<br>
rotavirus proteins in eliciting the immune response that follows rotavirus infection is not yet<br>
clear. Nevertheless, the VP6 protein determines the group and subgroup antigen, and<br>
VP4 and VP7 proteins are the determinants of serotype specificity.<br>
To date, at least 14 rotavirus G serotypes and 11 rotavirus P serotypes have been<br>
identified (Linhares A.C. &amp; Bresse J.S., Pan. Am. J. Publ. Health 2000, 9, 305-330).<br>
Among these, 10 G serotypes and 6 P serotypes have been identifed among the human<br>
rotavirus.<br>
VP7 protein is a 38,000 MW glycoprotein (34,000 MW when non-glycosylated) which is<br>
the translational product of genomic segment 7, 8 or 9, depending on the strain. This<br>
protein stimulates formation of the major neutralising antibody following rotavirus infection.<br>
VP4 protein is a non-glycosylated protein of approximately 88,000 MW which is the<br>
translational product of genomic segment 4. This protein also stimulates neutralising<br>
antibody following rotavirus infection. Since VP4 and VP7 proteins are the viral proteins<br>
against which neutralising antibodies are directed, they are believed to be prime<br>
candidates for development of rotavirus vaccines, affording protection against rotavirus<br>
illness.<br>
Natural rotavirus infection during early childhood is known to elicit protective immunity.<br>
Early vaccine development for preventing rotavirus infections began in the 1970s after the<br>
discovery of the virus. Initially, attenuated strains from animals and humans were studied,<br>
whilst more recent efforts have focused on human-animal reassortants.<br>
The development of novel rotavirus formulations must comply with a number of<br>
requirements, including worldwide distribution potential and stability under a broad range<br>
of environmental and storage conditions. In particular, the stability of a formulation,<br>
especially of a pharmaceutical or vaccine composition, will in general be better at lower<br>
temperatures compared to room or higher temperatures.<br>
Consequently one stabilisation method has been to develop vaccine formulations that can<br>
be stored frozen (-208C to -70°C) or alternatively to develop lyophilised vaccines that can<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
be kept for a prolonged period of time at around refrigerator temperature (2°C to 8°C).<br>
However, it is a known fact that the lyophilisation process has a limiting capacity, and is<br>
associated with a high production cost. Furthermore, lyophilised vaccines have a more<br>
sophisticated handling for administration as they may require more complex, hence<br>
relatively expensive devices such as multichamber/vial vaccines, with the active ingredient<br>
in one chamber and the reconstitution liquid in another chamber. Lyophilised vaccines are<br>
also associated with higher shipment and storage cost. These options may be inadequate<br>
for some countries in the developing world where the administration device has to be<br>
financially affordable and where the availability of production and storage infrastructure<br>
may be inexistent or unreliable.<br>
As Rotavirus are conventionally administered orally to human infants, this route brings<br>
several challenges to immunogenic rotavirus compositions.<br>
Rotavirus is rapidly inactivated in an acidic environment, upon exposure to acid buffer or<br>
acidic gastric juice for example (C. Weiss and H.F. Clark, 1985, J. Gen. Virol.,66, 2725-<br>
2730; T. Vesikari et al., 1984, The Lancet, page 700 ; R.H.Foster and AJ.Wagstaff, 1998,<br>
BioDrugs Feb: 9(2) 155-178). Therefore it is desirable that rotavirus compositions are<br>
formulated in a way that they are stable during storage and after administration into the<br>
host recipient.<br>
Rotavirus vaccines are primarily intended to be administered to babies, as early as at the<br>
age of 4 weeks. A small vaccine dose volume, such as lower than 2 ml or even than 1.5<br>
ml dose volume, will be advantageous for that population. Therefore, it is desirable that<br>
rotavirus compositions are formulated in a small dose volume.<br>
Stabilising formulations for liquid viral vaccines are known. For example, EP 0 065 905<br>
discloses in general stabilising compositions suitable for a series of viruses such as those<br>
causing measles or influenza, and in particular it discloses stabilizing phosphate buffer -<br>
containing solutions suitable for live attenuated virus.<br>
Other stabilizing formulations are disclosed in WO 98/13065 and in Clark et al. (Pediatr<br>
Infect Dis J. 2003 Oct; 22(10):914-20). Such formulations also require, amongst other<br>
constituents, the presence of phosphate to act as a buffering agent to neutralise stomach<br>
acidity. These formulations are however not compatible with the requirements set out<br>
above for the successful development of a rotavirus formulation, specifically they are not<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
compatible with a reduced volume of the vaccine dose that is best suited for a human<br>
infant. In particular, the present inventor has found that adapting this prior art formulation<br>
into a low volume setting such as 1.5 ml or lower, whilst maintaining efficient antacid<br>
capacity, leads to problems arising from inappropriate concentration of the formulation<br>
constituents, in particular phosphate buffer.<br>
There is a need therefore to develop alternative rotavirus formulations, in particular<br>
alternative liquid formulations that can withstand gastric acidity, and are refrigerator-stable<br>
despite the absence of phosphate. In addition there is a need that such alternative<br>
formulations be also successfully formulated in a vaccine dose volume as small as<br>
possible.<br>
Therefore the present invention not only provides alternative stable immunogenic<br>
compositions that are devoid of phosphate or contain only minimal amounts of phosphate,<br>
but also allow rotavirus to be formulated in a low dose volume that are suitable for oral<br>
administration to human infants.<br>

STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid rotavirus<br>
immunogenic composition which is suitable for oral administration to a human infant,<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
comprising a rotavirus antigen, a sugar and a carboxylate wherein said composition has a<br>
pH of between about pH 5.0 and about pH 8.0 and comprises less than 5 mM phosphate.<br>
Suitably the concentration of phosphate in the claimed composition does not exceed 1<br>
mM.<br>
In a specific aspect of the invention, a suitable vaccine dose will normally be 1.5 ml or<br>
suitably any volume smaller than 2.5 ml such as a volume of 2 ml or less, that is suitable<br>
for oral administration to babies or infants. In particular the dose volume will be such that<br>
the technical feasibility of the formulation is possible and there is no detrimental effect on<br>
the immunogenic potential of the formulation. The claimed compositions offer the<br>
advantage over prior art phosphate-containing formulations that they can withstand gastric<br>
acidity, remain immunogenic and stable over a long shelf-life, whilst being compatible with<br>
formulation in a dose volume smaller than usual, such as smaller than 2.0 ml or even<br>
compatible with a dose volume of 1.5 ml or smaller.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the liquid immunogenic composition according to the invention<br>
has an antacid capacity of between 6 and 23 minutes as assessed by the Baby Rossett-<br>
Rice assay (adapted as detailed in Example III.2.2 from the basic Rossett-Rice test).<br>
Suitably the antacid capacity will be at least 8 minutes, typically at least 12 minutes, and a<br>
suitable range is between 12 and 20 minutes. Surprisingly, the claimed compositions have<br>
shown a not only acceptable but higher antacid capacity even in a smaller dose volume,<br>
compared to phosphate-containing prior art formulations.<br>
In another aspect, there is provided a method for the preparation of said liquid rotavirus<br>
immunogenic composition comprising admixing a rotavirus antigen, a sugar and a<br>
carboxylate with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent.<br>
The invention also covers in another aspect the use of a rotavirus antigen in admixture<br>
with a carboxylate and a sugar for the manufacture of an oral immunogenic composition<br>
for the prevention or treatment of rotavirus associated diseases in humans wherein said<br>
composition does not contain more than 5 mM phosphate and has a pH of between about<br>
pH 5.0 and about pH 8.0.<br>
In a still further aspect a method of treating or preventing rotavirus associated diseases in<br>
humans by administering to a human subject in need thereof an effective amount of said<br>
liquid immunogenic composition is also provided.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described further in the<br>
following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present inventor has developed novel liquid rotavirus compositions that are<br>
immunogenic, stable at refrigerator-temperature (between 2 and 7°C, typically at 4°C),<br>
that can withstand the inherent acid nature of the stomach when administered orally and<br>
that are compatible with a small dose volume.<br>
A liquid composition is intended to mean a formulation in a fluid form, as opposed to a dry<br>
form, whose volume is fixed under constant specific conditions (for example, at room<br>
temperature or refrigerator-temperature, at atmospheric pressure) and whose shape is<br>
determined by the container it fills.<br>
The subject matter of and information disclosed within the publications and patents or<br>
patent applications mentioned in this specification are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The terms 'comprising', 'comprise' and 'comprises' herein is intended by the inventor to be<br>
optionally substitutable with the terms 'consisting of, 'consist of, and 'consists of,<br>
respectively, in every instance.<br>
The present invention provides for a liquid rotavirus immunogenic composition comprising<br>
a rotavirus antigen, a sugar and a carboxylate wherein said composition has a pH of<br>
between about pH 5.0 and about pH 8.0 and comprises less than 5 mM phosphate. The<br>
compositions of the invention show a very good stability profile when compared to<br>
phosphate-containing formulations, whilst the immunogenicity profile is maintained. These<br>
compositions are at least as stable, as their phosphate-containing counterparts. A further<br>
advantage of the present compositions is that they can be prepared in a small dose<br>
volume such as lower than 2.0 ml, typically 1.5 ml for example, compared to prior art<br>
formulations in which phosphate is present.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the concentration of phosphate within the immunogenic<br>
composition does not exceed 5 mM, suitably 1 mM, in particular it does not exceed 0.5<br>
mM. Phosphate refers as the salt of phosphoric acid (also known as orthophosphoric acid<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
(H3PO4)), usually sodium or potassium or mix of sodium and potassium salts are used (for<br>
example: Na3PO4, Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, K3PO4, K2HPO4, KH2PO4). Suitably, phosphate<br>
concentration is 0.4 mM or below, typically 0.2 mM or below, ideally 0.1 mM or below. In<br>
another specific embodiment, the composition as claimed herein is free of phosphate.<br>
Typically phosphate, when present, comes from the cell culture medium or saline buffer<br>
used as a diluent, such as DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium), Eagle BME basal<br>
medium or PBS.<br>
The phosphate concentration to which it is referred throughout the specification will be a<br>
calculated concentration, as determined from the amount(s) of phosphate-containing<br>
chemicals operated in the preparation of the claimed composition(s). Alternatively, the<br>
concentration of phosphate present in the composition as claimed herein may be<br>
measured experimentally using analytical routine techniques.<br>
One suitable technique is a colorimetric assay named 'Nanocolor' marketed by Macherey-<br>
Nagel (catalog n° 918 78). This method is based on the photometric determination of the<br>
yellow complex formed by phosphoric acid-molybdate-vanadate in an acid solution. The<br>
limit of quantitation of the assay is 2 ug/ml phosphate or 0.02 mM.<br>
An alternative method is the dosage of phosphorus (P) by an atomic emission<br>
spectroscopy technique such as Incutively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission<br>
Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Boss &amp; Fredeen, in Concepts, Instrumentation, and Techniques<br>
in Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy, Perkin Elmer eds, second<br>
edition, 1997 - see Methodology on page 72 onwards). The limit of quantitation of the<br>
assay is 0.030 µg/ml phosphorus corresponding to a phosphate concentration of 0.00032<br>
mM.<br>
In one embodiment, the pH of the composition is between pH 5.0 and pH 8.0. In another<br>
specific embodiment, the pH of the claimed composition is between about pH 5.5 to about<br>
pH 7.5. By 'about pH' is meant within 0.2 units of the stated pH value. In particular, the pH<br>
of the composition is between pH 5.5 and pH 7.5. For example, the pH of the composition<br>
is between about pH 6.0 to about pH 7.0, in particular between pH 6.0 and pH 7.0,<br>
typically between pH 6.2 and pH 6.8 or between pH 6.2 and pH 6.6. A pH of about 6.4, in<br>
particular of 6.4, is contemplated. It is known that rotavirus is negatively affected at acidic<br>
pH such as a pH below 4.0, and would be expected that a maximum stability is obtained<br>
at a neutral or even slightly basic pH, i.e. a pH range of 7.0 to 8.0, which is obtained for<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
example in the prior art phosphate buffered formulations. As shown in the experimental<br>
section, the compositions of the invention, despite the absence of phosphate, have shown<br>
a good stability profile at the claimed pH range, and furthermore have surprisingly shown<br>
an acceptable stability and immunogenicity profile even under mildly.acidic conditions, i.e.<br>
around pH 6.0 to 7.0, such as at a pH of around 6.4 for example.<br>
The liquid composition as claimed herein comprises a carboxylate.<br>
The carboxylate "(-COO"') is the dissociated form of the carboxylic acid resulting of the<br>
neutralization of the acidic function ("-COOH") by a basic substance. A carboxylic acid is a<br>
compound containing the carboxyl group:" - COOH"; which is formally made by combining<br>
carbonyl group ("-CO-") and an hydroxyl group ("-OH"). However, interaction between<br>
these two parts so modifies their chemical properties that the entire group is considered<br>
as a new function with its own characteristic properties (Organic Chemistry by J.B.<br>
Hendrickson, D.J. Cram, and G.S. Hammond , McGraw-Hill Book Company, third edition<br>
1970 page 131). Although the International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry<br>
(ILJPAC) recommend to use the alkaneoic acid (for monocarboxylic acids) and alkanedioic<br>
acid (for dicarboxylic acids) nomenclature, most of trivial names of the carboxylic acids<br>
have been used in this text because these products are well known by the skilled person<br>
in the Art. For example the ILJPAC name of acetic acid is the ethanoic acid and for adipic<br>
acid the name will be hexanedioic acid.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a carboxylate salt from an inorganic acid or, suitably, from an<br>
organic acid is used. In a specific embodiment, said carboxylate is derived from a weak<br>
acid. For example, said carboxylate is a carboxylate salt selected from the group<br>
consisting of: adipate, citrate, malate, acetate, succinate, propionate, butyrate, malonate,<br>
glutarate, maleate, glycolate, lactate, gluconate, fumarate, tartarate, pimelate and any<br>
combination of two or more therof. Suitable carboxylates are carboxylates derived from a<br>
carboxylic acid with a pKa &gt; 4 or carboxylates derived from a di- or tri-carboxylic acid (di-<br>
or tri-carboxylates) with a numerical average pKa &gt; 4 (Table 9). Examples of the former<br>
class include carboxylates derived from propinic, butyric and acetic acid. Examples of the<br>
latter class include carboxylates derived from citric, maleic, malonic, succinic, adipic,<br>
glutaric and malic acid.<br>
In a specific embodiment said carboxylate belongs to the GRAS list, i.e. carboxylates that<br>
are 'Generally Recognized As Safe by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA, and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
is selected from the list comprising acetate, propionate, malate, glutarate, adipate, lactate,<br>
fumarate, and tartrate. Suitably the carboxylate is a salt of adipic acid, i.e. monosodium<br>
salt of adipic acid, monopotassium salt of adipic acid, suitably disodium adipate or<br>
dipotassium adipate, or calcium adipate.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a carboxylate concentration of between 50 mM to 2 M is<br>
suitably used in the liquid rotavirus composition. It will be understood that the carboxylate<br>
concentration within the range mentioned above may be suitably adapted, through routine<br>
experimentation, according to the nature of the carboxylate, the antacid capacity to be<br>
achieved and the volume of the vaccine dose. For example, high carboxylate<br>
concentrations of above 1 M can be used when a high antacid potential is required, such<br>
as above 8 minutes, suitably above 10 minutes, or above 12 minutes as assessed by the<br>
Baby Rossett Rice test for a dose volume of 1.5 ml. Concentrations of 1 M or below are<br>
typically used, such as concentrations of between 100 mM and 1 M, typically<br>
concentrations of between 200 mM and 800 mM. Suitable carboxylate concentrations are<br>
comprised between about 300 mM and about 800 mM, suitably between 400 mM and 700<br>
mM. In particular, when the carboxylate is adipate a suitable concentration range is<br>
between 400 and 500 mM. However, the skilled person will recognise that concentrations<br>
within 10-20 percent of the stated values may be appropriate, i.e. when 100 mM is stated,<br>
a range of 80-90 mM to 110-120 mM is also disclosed and meant to be covered.<br>
Illustrative concentrations are given in Table 1 below for various carboxylates.<br>

The pH of the liquid rotavirus immunogenic composition as claimed herein may be<br>
obtained by mixing of a carboxylic acid and a carboxylate salt. In particular, the carboxylic<br>
acid may be used in admixture with a different carboxylate salt, for example, a citrate is<br>
combined with adipic acid. This may be advantageous when using commercially available<br>
chemicals, some of which may not be readily available, or to simplify the formulation step.<br>
For example, one (or more) of said carboxylic acid(s) can be selected from the list<br>
consisting of: adipic acid, citric acid, malic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, carbonic acid,<br>
propionic acid, butyric acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid, maleic acid, glycolic acid, lactic<br>
acid, gluconic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, pimelic acid, and is (are) mixed in suitable<br>
proportions with one (or more) of carboxylate salts selected from the list consisting of:<br>
adipate, citrate, malate, acetate, succinate, propionate, butyrate, malonate, glutarate,<br>
maleate, glycolate, lactate, gluconate, fumarate, tartarate, pimeliate.<br>
The liquid composition as claimed herein comprises a sugar. Sucrose is particularly<br>
suitable. Dextrose is another suitable sugar. Other sugars or sugar alcohols can also be<br>
used in lieu of sucrose or dextrose, including for example: glycerol, erythrose, erythriol,<br>
xylitol, arabitol, ribose, xylose, arabinose, glucose, tagalose, mannose, galactose,<br>
fructose, inositol, sorbitol, mannitol, galactitol, glucose and fructose mix, maltose,<br>
sophorose, lactose, cellobiose, melibiose, trehalose, sucrose, palatinose, maltulose,<br>
lactulose, maltitol, lactitol, raffinose, maltotriose, melezitose, cellotriose, ciritol,<br>
maltotetraose, stachyose, cellotetraose, maltopentaose, cellopentaose, maltohexaose,<br>
cellohexaose, oligosaccharides.<br>
Typical sugar concentrations range from about 1% w/w to about 70% w/w, for example<br>
from about 25% w/w to about 60% w/w. The skilled person will however recognise that the<br>
nature and concentration of sugar must be optimised such that it ensures satisfactory viral<br>
viability whislt maintaining the viscosity at a level that is compatible with downstream<br>
processing steps of the formulation, such as filtration. In a specific embodiment, sucrose<br>
is used. Typically, its concentration is maintained at a minimum of 30% w/w. Higher, i.e.<br>
above 30% w/w, sucrose concentrations can moreover be used to ensure long term<br>
storage, as it is expected that the high iso-osmotic pressure of such formulations will<br>
prevent bacterial growth. Accordingly, the lower limit for the concentration of sucrose in<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
the liquid composition as claimed herein is suitably 30% w/w or higher, such as 35% w/w<br>
or higher, suitably 40% w/w or higher. A suitable sucrose concentration ranges from about<br>
40% w/w to about 70% w/w. For example, a suitable concentration of sucrose will be<br>
between 45% w/w and 60% w/w, suitably between 50% w/w and 55% w/w. In particular,<br>
sucrose at a concentration of about 50% w/w or about 55% w/w is used. Final sucrose<br>
concentrations of 50% w/w or 55% w/w are suitable.<br>
The skilled person will understand that routine optimisation of the sugar concentration can<br>
be carried out in order to ensure viral stability when another sugar is substituted for<br>
sucrose.<br>
Furthermore, the stated values for sugars may be slightly adapted to take into account<br>
formulation/manufacturing parameters such as the dose volume. Therefore, the skilled<br>
person will recognise that concentrations within 10% of the stated values may be<br>
appropriate, i.e. when 50% w/w is stated, a range of 45% w/w - 55% w/w is also disclosed<br>
and meant to be covered.<br>
The liquid rotavirus immunogenic composition of the present invention also comprises a<br>
rotavirus antigen. In particular the liquid composition as claimed herein is an immunogenic<br>
composition, e.g. a vaccine composition. A rotavirus antigen is understood to mean any<br>
rotavirus antigen that is suitable for use in a vaccine formulation. Oral live rotavirus<br>
antigens are especially contemplated. For example, any suitable rotavirus antigen can be<br>
selected from the group consisting of: a live attenuated rotavirus from animals or humans,<br>
in particular a human live attenuated rotavirus; a reassortant rotavirus, in particular but not<br>
limited to a human-human reassortant rotavirus, a bovine-human reassortant rotavirus or<br>
a rhesus monkey-human reassortant rotavirus.<br>
All rotavirus strains, human or animal strains, are contemplated in the present invention.<br>
Human rotavirus strains are suitable. In particular, rotavirus antigen is in one embodiment<br>
the attenuated human rotavirus population comprising a single variant or substantially a<br>
single variant, said variant being defined by the nucleotide sequence encoding at least<br>
one of the major viral proteins designated as VP4 and VP7 as disclosed in WO 01/12797,<br>
in particular any, including one or more, of the variants defined by the mutations set forth<br>
in Table 2, Tables 3.1 and 3.2 of WO 01/12797. In specific embodiments, the rotavirus<br>
antigen is any of the following human live attenuated rotavirus strains: HRV 89-12C2<br>
strain deposited under accession number ATCC VR 2272 (as described in EP 0 557 427),<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
its progeny, reassortants and immunologically active derivatives thereof; HRV P43 strain<br>
deposited under accession number ECACC 99081301 (as described in WO 01/12797), its<br>
progeny, reassortants and immunologically active derivatives thereof.<br>
Rotavirus populations having the characteristics of any of the above mentioned deposited<br>
strains are also suitable vaccine strains. Derivatives from said deposited strains can be<br>
obtained by subjecting said strains to further processing such as by propagating them by<br>
further passaging, cloning, or other procedures using the live virus or by modifying said<br>
deposited strains in any way including by genetic engineering techniques or reassortant<br>
techniques. Such steps and techniques are well known in the art. Rotavirus antigens of<br>
particular interest are progeny of any of said deposited strains and immunologically active<br>
derivatives thereof. Immunologically active derivatives means materials obtained from or<br>
with any of the deposited strains, in particular from or with HRV P43 strain deposited<br>
under accession number ECACC 99081301, particularly antigens of the virus, which are<br>
capable of eliciting an immune response that is reactive against rotavirus when injected<br>
into a host animal.<br>
Materials derived from the deposited strains recited above are also suitable rotavirus<br>
antigens, and include protein and genetic material. Of particular interest are reassortant<br>
rotaviruses which comprise at least one antigen or at least one segment of any of said<br>
deposited strains, for example reassortants which comprise a virulent strain of rotavirus in<br>
which one or part of one of the 11 genome segments has been replaced by the genome<br>
segment or part thereof of any of said deposited strains. Specifically, a rotavirus<br>
reassortant in which the segment or partial segment coding for NSP4 is a segment or<br>
partial segment of any of said deposited strains, may have useful properties. Reassortant<br>
rotaviruses and techniques for preparing them are well known (Foster, R. H. and<br>
Wagstaff, A. J. Tetravalent Rotavirus Vaccine, a review. ADIS drug evaluation, BioDrugs,<br>
Gev, 9(2), 155-178, 1998).<br>
The rotavirus antigen of the claimed composition may be produced according to routine<br>
production techniques. Typically rotavirus antigen preparations may be derived from<br>
tissue culture methods used to propagate the virus or express recombinant rotavirus<br>
antigens. Suitable cell substrates for growing the virus include for example dog kidney<br>
cells such as MDCK or cells from a clone of MDCK, MDCK-like cells, monkey kidney cells<br>
such as AGMK cells including Vero cells which are particularly suitable, other cells lines of<br>
monkey kidney origin such as BSC-1, LLC-MK2 and MA104, suitable pig cell lines, or any<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
other mammalian cell type suitable for the production of rotavirus for vaccine purposes.<br>
Suitable cell substrates also include human cells e.g. MRC-5 cells. Suitable cell<br>
substrates are not limited to cell lines; for example primary cells are also included.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are admixtures of any of the above recited<br>
deposited strains with other rotavirus variants, for example other cloned variants or other<br>
reassortant rotavirus, or with other viruses in particular other attenuated viruses. In<br>
particular the composition according to the invention contains two rotavirus antigens. In<br>
particular one antigen within the composition is the HRV P43 strain deposited under<br>
accession number ECACC 99081301, and the other antigen is a reassortant derivative<br>
thereof or any immunologically active derivative thereof.<br>
The rotavirus antigen for inclusion in the claimed composition can be a monovalent<br>
rotavirus strain, i.e. containing a single rotavirus strain, or be multivalent, i.e. containing at<br>
least two or more rotavirus strains.<br>
The skilled person will understand that other readily available attenuated strains, from<br>
human or animal origin, that are obtainable from depository institutions are also suitable<br>
and may be used as substitutes for the recited deposited strains.<br>
According to the present invention, a suitable immunogenic composition contains a<br>
rotavirus antigen, in particular the human attenuated P43 strain (as deposited under<br>
accession number ECACC 99081301, see WO 01/12797) at a concentration of 105- 106<br>
ffu per dose (or equivalent to 105.5-106.5 as expressed in CCID50 per dose), 55%<br>
sucrose w/w, di-sodium adipate 0.465 M (corresponding to 132.74 mg per dose), and has<br>
a pH of about 6.2 to 6.6, in a 1.5 ml dose volume. For this composition the DMEM content<br>
is 6% w/w and therefore represents less than 0.1 mM phosphate.<br>
The composition according to the present invention may further include an additional<br>
antacid component such as an inorganic antacid, for example aluminium hydroxide<br>
AI(OH)3 and magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2. Aluminium hydroxide is a particularly<br>
suitable. Other commercially available antacids, which are suitable for use in the<br>
invention, include Mylanta™, which contains aluminium hydroxide and magnesium<br>
hydroxide. These are insoluble in water and are given in suspension. Another particularly<br>
suitable antacid that may be additionally used in the vaccine composition of the present<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
invention is the insoluble inorganic salt, calcium carbonate (CaCO3). A typical CaCO3<br>
concentration is 80 mg per vaccine dose for example.<br>
Other suitable water insoluble antacids are magnesium carbonate, aluminium carbonate,<br>
aluminium phosphate, mix of aluminium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate, aluminium-<br>
magnesium-hydrycarbonate, aluminium hydroxide-magnesium carbonate-sorbitol-manitol,<br>
hydroxy-aluminium-sodium-carbonate, dihydroxy-aluminium-potassiurn-carbonate,<br>
magaldrate, hydrotalcite, almagcit, magnesium-aluminium-silicate-hydrate.<br>
The immunogenic composition according to the present invention may additionally<br>
comprise pharmaceutically suitable compounds and/or carriers, in particular those known<br>
in the art as being suitable for oral administration, especially to infants. Such carriers<br>
include and are not limited to carbohydrates, polyalcohols, amino acids, aluminium<br>
hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, hydroxyapatite, talc, titanium oxide, iron hydroxide,<br>
magnesium stearate, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, vegetal peptone, xanthane, caraghenane, arabic gum,<br>
B-cyclodextrin.<br>
The composition according to the present invention may additionally comprise calcium<br>
ions which have been suggested to stabilise rotavirus.<br>
Viscous agents may additionally be included present in the composition.<br>
Possible viscous agents that may be used include pseudoplastic excipients. Suitable<br>
viscous agents include: propylene glycol, arabic gum, adragant gum, agar-agar, alginate,<br>
pectin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Tyloses C®), methylcellulose (Methocels A®,<br>
Viscotrans MC®, Tylose MH® and MB®), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Klucels®),<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose (Methocels E® and K®, Vicotrans MPHC®), Carbopol®, xanthane<br>
gum, Veegum® (Magnesium-aluminium silicate), Avicel® (about 89% microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and 11 % Carboxymethylcellulose Na). Xanthane gum or starch are particularly<br>
suitable viscous agents for additional use in the liquid composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
It may also be advantageous to include in the claimed composition lipid-based vehicles<br>
such as virosomes or liposomes, oil in water emulsions or carrier particles. Alternatively<br>
or in addition immunostimulants such as those known in the art for oral vaccines may be<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
included in the composition. Such immunostimulants include bacterial toxins, particularly<br>
cholera toxin (CT) in the form of the holotoxin (entire molecule) or the B chain only (CTB)<br>
and the heat labile enterotoxin of E. coli (LT). Mutated LTs (mLTs) which are less likely to<br>
convert to their active form than the native LT are described in WO 96/06627, WO<br>
93/13202 and US 5,182,109.<br>
The composition according to the invention may further comprise an adjuvant or<br>
immunostimulant such as but not limited to detoxified lipid A from any source and non-<br>
toxic derivatives of lipid A, saponins and other reagents capable of stimulating a TH1 type<br>
response.<br>
15<br>
It has long been known that enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent<br>
stimulator of the immune system, although its use in adjuvants has been curtailed by its<br>
toxic effects. A non-toxic derivative of LPS, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), produced by<br>
removal of the core carbohydrate group and the phosphate from the reducing-end<br>
glucosamine, has been described by Ribi et al (1986, Immunology and<br>
Immunopharmacology of bacterial endotoxins, Plenum Publ. Corp., NY, p407-419) and<br>
has the following structure:<br><br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
A further detoxified version of MPL results from the removal of the acyl chain from the 3-<br>
position of the disaccharide backbone, and is called 3-O-Deacylated monophosphoryl lipid<br>
A (3D-MPL). It can be purified and prepared by the methods taught in GB 2122204B,<br>
which reference also discloses the preparation of diphosphoryl lipid A, and 3-0-<br>
deacylated variants thereof.<br>
A suitable form of 3D-MPL is in the form of an emulsion having a small particle size less<br>
than 0.21µm in diameter, and its method of manufacture is disclosed in WO 94/21292.<br>
Aqueous compositions comprising monophosphoryl lipid A and a surfactant have been<br>
described in WO9843670A2..<br>
The bacterial lipopolysaccharide derived adjuvants to be formulated in the compositions of<br>
the present invention may be purified and processed from bacterial sources, or<br>
alternatively they may be synthetic. For example, purified monophosphoryl lipid A is<br>
described in Ribi et al 1986 (supra), and 3-O-Deacylated monophosphoryl or diphosphoryl<br>
lipid A derived from Salmonella sp. is described in GB 2220211 and US 4912094. Other<br>
purified and synthetic lipopolysaccharides have been described (Hilgers et al., 1986,<br>
Int.Arch.Allergy.Immunol., 79(4):392-6; Hilgers et al., 1987, Immunology, 60(1):141-6; and<br>
EP 0 549 074 B1). A particularly suitable bacterial lipopolysaccharide adjuvant is 3D-<br>
MPL<br>
Accordingly, the LPS derivatives that may be used in the present invention are those<br>
immunostimulants that are similar in structure to that of LPS or MPL or 3D-MPL. In<br>
another aspect of the present invention the LPS derivatives may be an acylated<br>
monosaccharide, which is a sub-portion to the above structure of MPL.<br>
Synthetic derivatives of lipid A are also known including, but not limited to:<br>
OM174(2-deoxy-6-o-[2-deoxy-2-[(R)-3-dodecanoyloxytetra-decanoylamino]-4-o-<br>
phosphono-|3-D-glucopyranosyl]-2-[(R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]-a-D-<br>
glucopyranosyldihydrogenphosphate), (WO 95/14026)<br>
OM 294 DP (3S, 9 R) -3--[(R)-dodecanoyloxytetradecanoylamino]-4-oxo-5-aza-9(R)-[(R)-<br>
3-hydroxytetradecanoylamino]decan-1,10-diol, 1,10-bis(dihydrogenophosphate) (WO99<br>

aminohexanoate) (WO 01/46127)<br>
Purified saponins as oral adjuvants are described in WO 98/56415. Saponins and<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A may be employed separately or in combination (e.g. WO<br>
94/00153) and may be formulated in adjuvant systems together with other agents. 3D-<br>
MPL is a well-known adjuvant manufactured by Ribi Immunochem, Montana and its<br>
manufacture is described in GB 2122204.<br>
Another prefered immunostimulant for use in the present invention is Quil A saponin and<br>
its derivatives. Saponins are taught in: Lacaille-Dubois, M and Wagner H. (1996. A review<br>
of the biological and pharmacological activities of saponins. Phytomedicine vol 2 pp 363-<br>
386). Saponins are steroid ortriterpene glycosides widely distributed in the plant and<br>
marine animal kingdoms. Saponins are noted for forming colloidal solutions in water which<br>
foam on shaking, and for precipitating cholesterol. When saponins are near cell<br>
membranes they create pore-like structures in the membrane which cause the membrane<br>
to burst. Haemolysis of erythrocytes is an example of this phenomenon, which is a<br>
property of certain, but not all, saponins.<br>
Saponins are known as adjuvants in vaccines for systemic administration. The adjuvant<br>
and haemolytic activity of individual saponins has been extensively studied in the art<br>
(Lacaille-Dubois and Wagner, supra). For example, Quil A (derived from the bark of the<br>
South American tree Quillaja Saponaria Molina), and fractions thereof, are described in<br>
US 5,057,540 and "Saponins as vaccine adjuvants", Kensil, C. R., Crit Rev TherDrug<br>
Carrier Syst, 1996,12 (1-2):1-55; and EP 0 362 279 B1. Particulate structures, termed<br>
Immune Stimulating Complexes (ISCOMS), comprising fractions of Quil A are haemolytic<br>
and have been used in the manufacture of vaccines (Morein, B., EP 0 109 942 B1; WO<br>
96/11711; WO 96/33739). The haemolytic saponins QS21 and QS17 (HPLC purified<br>
fractions of Quil A) have been described as potent systemic adjuvants, and the method of<br>
their production is disclosed in US Patent No.5,057,540 and EP 0 362 279 B1. QS-21 is a<br>
natural saponin derived from the bark of Quillaja saponaria Molina, which induces CD8+<br>
cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), Th1 cells and a predominant lgG2a antibody response and is a<br>
suitable saponin in the context of the present invention. Other saponins which have been<br>
used in systemic vaccination studies include those derived from other plant species such<br>
as Gypsophila and Saponaria (Bomford et al., Vaccine, 10(9):572-577,1992).<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
An enhanced system involves the combination of a non-toxic lipid A derivative and a<br>
saponin derivative particularly the combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO<br>
94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol<br>
as disclosed in WO 96/33739. The saponins forming part of the present invention may be<br>
separate in the form of micelles, or may be in the form of large ordered structures such as<br>
ISCOMs (EP 0 109 942 B1) or liposomes) when formulated with cholesterol and lipid, or in<br>
the form of an oil in water emulsion (WO 95/17210). The saponins may suitably be<br>
associated with a metallic salt, such as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate (WO<br>
98/15287).<br>
A particularly potent adjuvant composition involving QS21 and 3D-MPL in an oil in water<br>
emulsion is described in WO 95/17210 and in WO 99/11241 and WO 99/12565, and are<br>
suitable compositions.<br>
A general discussion of vehicles and adjuvants for oral immunisation can be found in<br>
Vaccine Design, The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach, edited by Powell and Newman,<br>
Plenum Press, New York, 1995.<br>
The vaccine composition according to the invention may contain additional components<br>
including for example flavourings (particularly for an oral vaccine) and bacteriostatic<br>
agents.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the liquid composition according to the invention has an antacid<br>
capacity of between 6 and 23 minutes as assessed by the Baby Rossett-Rice assay<br>
(adapted as detailed in Example IIl.2.2 from the basic Rossett-Rice test). According to the<br>
present invention, by 'antacid capacity' is meant the period of time, expressed in minutes,<br>
during which the pH of the formulation under test remains above 4 as assessed according<br>
to the experimental procedure given in Example III.2.2. Suitably the antacid capacity will<br>
be between 12 and 20 minutes. An antacid capacity higher than 23 minutes such as 29-30<br>
minutes for example is also perfectly acceptable from a vaccine development perspective<br>
but such a high capacity is superfluous. In particular, an antacid capacity of at least 8<br>
minutes, at least 10 minutes, at least 12 minutes is especially contemplated. An antacid<br>
capacity of at least 12 minutes, at least 13 minutes, at least 14 minutes, at least 15<br>
minutes, at least 16 minutes, is suitable. It is known that the stomach of small infants who<br>
have not eaten for a period of three hours is very acid, and that rotavirus is negatively<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
affected by such an acidic pH. In our hands, when working with a low volume formulation,<br>
which is desirable, it has been impossible to measure the antacid capacity of classical<br>
phosphate-containing formulations, as phosphate solubility was easily exceeded and<br>
crystallization of the constituents occurred during formulation and/or short term storage.<br>
By contrast, the claimed compositions have surprisingly shown an acceptable but higher<br>
antacid capacity even in a smaller dose volume, compared to phosphate-containing prior<br>
art formulations.<br>
In another specific embodiment, said liquid immunogenic composition is stable under at<br>
least one of the following conditions: for 7 days at 37°C, for one year at 4°C, for 18<br>
months at 4°C, for two years at 4°C. According to the present invention, the stability of a<br>
given composition is assessed by measuring the viral titer (i.e. viral stability), according to<br>
the procedure set forth in example III.1, after storage of the formulation for a defined<br>
period of time at a given temperature. Stability of the composition may be assessed by an<br>
accelerated stability test, for example after storage of the formulation during one week at<br>
37°C. The stability of the composition may alternatively be assessed over a longer period<br>
of time, such as during several months, either at refrigerator-temperature (between 2 and<br>
7°C, typically at 4°C) or at room temperature (20-22°C). Under these conditions, a stable<br>
composition is that which has a maximum rotavirus titer loss of 1 as expressed in log™<br>
ffu/dose in the defined test conditions. Particularly suitable compositions are those in<br>
which a maximum of 0.5 log™, for example 0.4 or less, 0.3 or less, 0.2 or less or suitably<br>
0.1 log10 ffu per vaccine dose, is lost upon accelerated stability test at 37°C during one<br>
week.<br>
Alternatively, the liquid immunogenic composition as claimed herein may be frozen and<br>
stored frozen at -20°C or below, or at - 70°C for several years, and remain stable at 4°C<br>
for at least one year upon thawing. Typically the frozen formulation will be stable for at<br>
least 6 months, at least 12 months, at least 18 months, at least 2 years, or at least 3<br>
years, and remain stable at 4GC for at least one year, suitably 18 months or 2 years upon<br>
thawing.<br>
The composition according to the present invention is an immunogenic composition, e.g. a<br>
vaccine. For example, the claimed immunogenic composition is capable, typically after<br>
one, suitably two doses separated by one or two months, to elicit an immune response<br>
e.g. excellent vaccine take and a serum rotavirus specific IgA responses. 'Vaccine take' is<br>
defined as the percentage of subjects displaying either a serological response, e.g.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
appearance of serum IgA to rotavirus in post-immunization sera at a titer &gt;20 U/ml<br>
(ELISA), and/or with rotavirus shedding (ELISA) in any stool sample. Vaccine take can be<br>
defined as vaccine virus shedding in any stool sample collected between the first dose<br>
and up to 1 to 2 months after the second dose. In a specific embodiment, the vaccine<br>
according to the invention is capable of decreasing the occurrence of any, and preferably<br>
severe, rotavirus gastroenteritis as compared to placebo. Typically the vaccine is able to<br>
confer cross-protection against circulating strains other than that present in the vaccine.<br>
Typically, when the vaccine contains a G1 type strain such as that of the attenuated<br>
human virus P43, an immune response in induced to G1 and at least one of the non-G1<br>
serotypes selected from the group consisting of: G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10,<br>
G11, G12, G13 and G14 serotypes. Suitably a vaccine containing a G1 strain is capable<br>
of conferring protection against both G1 and non-G1 strains, such as G2, G3 and/or G4<br>
strains, and in particular against the globally emerging G9 serotype.<br>
In a specific embodiment, said gastroenteritis or severe gastroenteritis is caused by a<br>
rotavirus strain of a different serotype to that contained in the claimed composition. In<br>
particular, if the rotavirus strain present in the claimed composition is a G1 serotype, such<br>
as but not limited to the live attenuated human rotavirus strain HRV P43 (ECACC<br>
99081301), prevention is conferred against gastroenteritis or severe gastroenteritis<br>
caused by a rotavirus strain of a G1 serotype and also by a rotavirus strain of a non-G1<br>
serotype, for example by a rotavirus strain having a serotype selected from the list<br>
consisting of: G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13 and G14. In a<br>
particular embodiment, the immunogenic composition claimed herein is capable of<br>
inducing an immune response against, and/or provide protection against gastroenteritis or<br>
severe gastroenteritis caused by, at least one, suitably all of the following non-G1<br>
serotypes: G2, G3, G4 and G9. In another specific embodiment, if the rotavirus strain<br>
present in the claimed composition is a P[8] rotavirus type, such as but not limited to the<br>
live attenuated human rotavirus strain HRV P43 (ECACC 99081301), prevention is<br>
conferred against gastroenteritis or severe gastroenteritis caused by a rotavirus strain of a<br>
P[8] type and by a non- P[8] type, for example by a rotavirus strain having a serotype<br>
selected from the list consisting of: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P9 and P11 types. In<br>
particular, the immunogenic composition claimed herein is capable of inducing an immune<br>
response against, and/or provide protection against gastroenteritis or severe<br>
gastroenteritis caused by, at least one, suitably all of the following non- P[8] type: P4, P6.<br>
In another embodiment, the claimed composition is capable of inducing an immune<br>
response to, and/or provide protection against gastroenteritis or severe gastroenteritis<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
caused by, a rotavirus strain of a different G type and a different P type to that present in<br>
the administered composition. Specifically, the claimed composition comprises a G1P[8]<br>
rotavirus strain and is also capable of inducing an immune response to, and/or provide<br>
protection against gastroenteritis or severe gastroenteritis caused by, a G2P[4] rotavirus<br>
strain.<br>
Suitably the composition according to the invention is administered by oral administration.<br>
Suitably the composition is supplied in a single-dose device, such as a glass or plastic vial<br>
or syringe, suitable for delivery to small infants.<br>
Vaccines of the invention may be formulated and administered by known techniques,<br>
using a suitable amount of live virus to provide effective protection against rotavirus<br>
infection without significant adverse side effects in typical vaccinees.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method for the preparation of a liquid<br>
rotavirus formulation or immunogenic composition as described herein comprising<br>
admixing a rotavirus antigen, a sugar and a carboxyiate with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluent.<br>
A suitable amount of live virus will normally be between 104 and 107 ffu per dose. A<br>
typical dose of vaccine may comprise 105-106 ffu per dose and may be given in several<br>
doses over a period of time, for example in two doses given with a two-month interval.<br>
Rotavirus titer may also be expressed in CCID50 and it can be estimated in the context of<br>
this invention that a CCID50 of 106.0 is equivalent to a ffu of 105.5 per dose. Benefits may<br>
however be obtained by having more than 2 doses, for example a 3 or 4 dose regimen,<br>
particularly in developing countries. The first dose can suitably be given to infants at 4<br>
weeks to 14 or 15 weeks of age, suitably between 6 and 14 weeks of age. The interval<br>
between doses is at least 4 weeks but may be more or less than two months long, for<br>
example the second dose, and any subsequent dose if appropriate, may be given one<br>
month or three months after the previous dose, depending on the local immunisation<br>
schedule. An optimal amount of live virus for a single dose or for a multiple dose regimen,<br>
and optimal timing for the doses, can be ascertained by standard studies involving<br>
observation of antibody titers and other responses in subjects.<br>
Typically the volume of a dose of vaccine according to the invention will normally be 2.5<br>
ml or lower, typically between 0.5 ml and 2.5 ml. In a specific aspect of the invention, a<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
suitable vaccine dose will normally be 1.5 ml or suitably any volume smaller than 2.5 ml<br>
such as a volume of 2 ml or less, that is suitable for oral administration to babies or<br>
infants. In particular the dose volume will be such that the technical feasibility of the<br>
formulation is possible and there is no detrimental effect on the immunogenic potential of<br>
the formulation. The claimed compositions offer the advantage over prior art phosphate-<br>
containing formulations that they can withstand gastric acidity, remain immunogenic and<br>
stable over a long shelf-life, whilst being compatible with formulation in a dose volume<br>
smaller than usual, such as smaller than 2.0 ml or even, suitably, 1.5 ml or smaller.<br>
Typically the volume of a dose of vaccine according to the invention is between 0.5 ml and<br>
2.0 ml, suitably approximately between 1.0 ml and 1.5 ml, such as approximately 1.3 ml or<br>
approximately 1.4 ml or approximately 1.5 ml. A typical dose volume may also be 2 ml or<br>
below, such as for example 1.1 ml, 1.2 ml, 1.3 ml, 1.4 ml or 1.5 ml. Volumes of 1 ml or<br>
volumes smaller than 1 ml, e.g. of between 200 ul to 800 ul, are also contemplated within<br>
the scope of the present invention. The volume of liquid that can be administered orally<br>
may also be partly determined by the vaccine delivery device.<br>
The immunogenic composition of the invention may also be formulated to contain other<br>
antigens, in particular antigens from other suitable live viruses for protection against other<br>
diseases, for example poliovirus. Said additional active ingredients suitable for oral<br>
administration may be given either in admixture with the rotavirus composition, or<br>
alternatively may be co-administered (i.e. in a separate dose but on the same occasion)<br>
with the rotavirus composition claimed herein.<br>
The claimed composition may also be given concomitantly with other non-oral vaccines,<br>
for example with parenteral vaccines suitable for the paediatric vaccinee population such<br>
as DTPw or DTPa vaccines (vaccines against Bordetella pertussis - whooping cough,<br>
diphteria, tetanos), vaccines against Haemophilus influenza B-induced meningitis,<br>
hepatitis B, or measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), vaccines against Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae, in order to optimise the number of visits to the doctor.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention also provides a method of treating or preventing<br>
rotavirus associated diseases in humans, especially in young children such as babies or<br>
infants, by administering to said human subject in need thereof an effective amount of a<br>
liquid formulation, in particular an immunogenic composition or a vaccine, as claimed<br>
herein. In particular the claimed compositions will prevent from rotavirus infections. In a<br>
specific embodiment, the compositions claimed herein are capable of providing protection<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
against rotavirus gastroenteritis, in particular against severe gastroenteritis. A severe<br>
gastroenteritis is defined as an episode requiring hospitalisation and/or re-hydration<br>
therapy (equivalent to WHO plan B or C) in a medical facility, or an episode with a score<br>
&gt;11 on the 20-point Vesikari scale (Ruuska T and Vesikari T. Rotavirus disease in Finnish<br>
children: use of numerical scores for severity of diarrheal episodes. Scand J Infect Dis<br>
1990,22:259-67).<br>
In a still further embodiment, the invention provides for the use of a rotavirus antigen, a<br>
carboxylate and a sugar in the manufacture of an immunogenic composition, e.g. a<br>
vaccine, for the treatment or prevention of rotavirus associated diseases in humans,<br>
wherein said immunogenic composition has a pH of between pH 5.0 and pH 8.0 and<br>
comprises less than 5 mM phosphate. In particular, prevention of rotavirus infections,<br>
and/or protection against gastroenteritis and more especially against severe<br>
gastroenteritis is especially contemplated.<br>
In another specific embodiment, the invention also provides for the use of a human live<br>
attenuated rotavirus for the manufacture of an immunogenic composition as claimed<br>
herein for the treatment or prevention of rotavirus associated diseases without causing<br>
intussusception. In particular, said treatment or prevention comprises administering two<br>
oral doses, or more, of a safe and effective amount of the human live attenuated rotavirus<br>
composition to an infant within 4 to 14 or 15 weeks of age at the time of dose 1. Typically<br>
the infant will be from 6 to 14 weeks old at the time of the first dose. Within the context of<br>
the present invention a human infant is taken to mean an infant aged from 4 to 14 or 15<br>
weeks of age after birth.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention also provides for a liquid immunogenic composition<br>
comprising a rotavirus antigen, a sugar, phosphate and a carboxylate, wherein said<br>
composition has a pH of between about 5.0 to about 8.0 and wherein said carboxylate is<br>
selected from the list consisting of: adipate, malate, acetate, propionate, butyrate,<br>
malonate, glutarate, glycolate, gluconate, pimelate, and any combination of two or more<br>
thereof. In a specific embodiment said carboxylate is adipate. Typically phosphate will be<br>
present at a concentration of 10 mM to 1 M. The present inventor has found that these<br>
specific carboxylates, which have not been associated with the development of oral<br>
vaccine formulations, have fulfilled all the desired requirements of stability, acidic<br>
resistance, immunogenicity and formulation in a small dose volume, as set forth in the<br>
present description for the development of a suitable oral rotavirus vaccine for human<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
infants. In particular said carboxylates have no detrimental effect on rotavirus titer in the<br>
formulation. These carboxylates can adequately act as alternatives for conventional<br>
carboxylates such as succinate, glutamate and citrate for example in phosphate-<br>
containing rotavirus formulations. All other specific embodiments as described<br>
hereinabove equally apply to this aspect of the present invention. Typically the pH range<br>
of the composition is as defined herein, as are the antacid capacity and shelf-life stability.<br>
The invention also provides for method of preparation of said composition, for uses and<br>
methods of prevention or treatment of human infants using said composition.<br>
The invention will be further described by reference to the following, non-limiting,<br>
examples:<br>

Citric acid (when present) and citrate salt are admixed in the proportions and conditions<br>
illustrated in Tables 5 and 6. Rotavirus stability and antacid capacity of the formulations<br>
are measured according to the methods given in Examples III.1 and III.2, respectively.<br>
Formulations 110-115 and 128-130 were prepared. The volume of dose was 2.5 ml for<br>
formulations 110-115 and 1.5 ml for formulations 128-130. Formulations 110-115<br>
presented in Table 5 have been made at 325 g (250 ml) total scale, representing 100<br>
doses of 2.5 ml (3.25 g) each.<br>
Formulation 110 was prepared as follows. To 123.71 g of water (quantity determined so<br>
as to reach a final 325 g preparation) are consecutively added: 19.29 g tri-sodium citrate<br>
(Na3Citrate.2H2O, Mw 294) (corresponding to a final concentration of 262 mM) and 162.50<br>
g sucrose (50% w/w). After complete dissolution the solution is sterilised by filtration on a<br>
0.2 urn membrane. Under sterile conditions 19.5 g of DMEM medium, containing the<br>
necessary quantity of rotavirus to obtain 106.0 ffu per dose, is added. In this case the single<br>
dose volume is 2.5 ml or 3.25 g. The mix is homogenised and distributed in the<br>
appropriate dose container.<br>
In this example DMEM medium represents 6% w/w, corresponding to a final phosphate<br>
concentration of 0.059 mM.<br>

1.2 Rotavirus Stability and antacid capacity - results<br>
Rotavirus viral titration at different points in time has been evaluated according to the<br>
procedure given in Example lll.1 and the antacid capacity of the formulation has been<br>
evaluated following the protocol given in Example III.2. The results are illustrated in<br>
Tables 2 to 8.<br>
The pH for the control formulation 60, which was devoid of carboxylate and added<br>
phosphate, had no antacid capacity and further exhibited a pH close to the upper limit of<br>
pH 8.0 for virus stability.<br>
For all experimental formulations tested in Tables 5 to 8, the pH was maintained in a<br>
range of about 5.0-7.0 except for formulation 110, which exhibited a pH of above 8.0. As<br>
can be seen from the viral titer and viral loss results, the rotavirus stability in the liquid<br>
formulation is related to the pH of this formulation. In the range of about pH 5.4 (i.e.<br>
formulation 115) to pH 7.0 (i.e. formulations 111 and 128), the viral loss after 7 days at<br>
37°C was kept at a low level (i.e. below 0.5 log), and this contrasted with the result<br>
obtained for formulation 110 (pH &gt; 8, with a viral titer loss of 0.9 log).<br>
In addition, formulations 111-115 and 128-130, they showed a similar antacid capacity to<br>
that of formulation 110, as assessed by the Baby Rossett-Rice assay (see Example<br>
III.2.2). This antacid capacity well exceeded the lower limit of 8 min for 2.5 ml as well as<br>
for 1.5 ml dose volume formulations, and actually reached a minimum of 12 minutes, and<br>
was considered therefore highly satisfactory.<br>

Alternative carboxylates have also been tested as these may represent technically<br>
feasible alternatives when relatively low amounts of carboxylates may be desirable, for<br>
example when working with very small dose volumes.<br>
Examples of formulations containing such alternative carboxylates are given in Example<br>
and Tables 10-39.<br>
Example II - Formulations with an alternative carboxylate salt in the absence of<br>
added phosphate<br>
The following carboxylate salts have been used to create a buffer capacity: acetate,<br>
malonate, succinate, glutarate, adipate and malate. According to the pKa of a given<br>
carboxylic acid, and depending on its molecular weight, it is possible to find quantities to<br>
be formulated to achieve the target antacid capacity of at least 8 minutes, suitably at leas<br>
12 minutes as assessed by the BRR test, whilst being in a pH window of between pH 5.0<br>
to pH 8.0.<br>
Chemically speaking, a "buffer" effect is obtained when mixing a strong acid (like HCI) and<br>
a salt derived from a weak acid (like sodium acetate). The pH value corresponding to the<br>
middle of the buffer plateau is equal to the pKa of the weak acid. The pKa of carboxylic<br>
acid is a measure of acidic strength, in other words an indicator of the effective buffering<br>
range of the compound.<br>
Since rotavirus is rapidly degraded below pH 4 (C. Weiss and H.F. Clark, 1985 J. Gen.<br>
Virol.,66, 2725-2730), a buffer plateau of above pH 4 is desirable, i.e. suitably<br>
carboxylates with pKa &gt; 4 or di-carboxylates with an average pKa &gt; 4. Suitable<br>
carboxylates are given in Table 9. Numerical average pKa values are given.<br>

A standard acid-base titration curve for four carboxylates (sodium malate, sodium acetate,<br>
sodium citrate and sodium adipate) is illustrated in Figure 1. It shows that the useful<br>
antacid capacity between pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 for example, is of 72.50%, 68.75%, 57.70%<br>
and 41.25% for sodium adipate, sodium acetate, sodium citrate and sodium malate,<br>
respectively.<br>

succinate, glutarate, adipate and malate. All formulations shown in this Example have<br>
been prepared in a 1.5 ml dose volume.<br>

11.1.1. Formulations presented in Table 10 have been made at 325 g scale (250 ml)<br>
representing 166.6 doses of 1.5 ml (1.95 g) each. Antacid materials: Acetic acid (Mw 60),<br>
NaOH (Mw 40).<br>
Formulation 36: to 148.84 g of water (quantity sufficient to reach a final 325 g preparation)<br>
are successively added: 10.66 g NaOH, glacial acetic acid up to pH 7.16 and 130 g of<br>
sucrose (40% w/w). After complete dissolution the solution is sterilized by filtration on a<br>
0.2um membrane. Under sterile conditions 19.5 g of DMEM medium containing the<br>
necessary quantity of rotavirus is added to the solution, to obtain 106.0 ffu per dose. In this<br>
case the dose is 1.5 ml or 1.95 g. The mixture is homogenized and distributed in the<br>
appropriate dose container. In this example DMEM represent 6% w/w.<br>

Formulation 87: to 75.00 g of water are successively added: 8.00 g NaOH, 15.00 g glacial<br>
acetic acid, enough 1N NaOH solution to reach a pH of 7.00 (in this case 2 g of 1N NaOH<br>

Formulations 33-35 were not included in the low term stability study due for failing to<br>
comply with the stability test of 1 week at 37°C. Satisfactory results in the presence of<br>
additional calcium ion are nonetheless presented in the adipate series (see Example II. 5.<br>

In conclusion, as was observed for the other carboxylate formulations, in the adipate<br>
series, a high pH value did not give good stability data (see for example formulation 124<br>
which has a pH of 9.5 and exhibits more than 2.85 log of viral loss after 1 week storage at<br>
37°C).<br>
The highest acceptability limit value of pH is about 8.0 (see for example the pH value of<br>
7.96 obtained for formulation 143) for which a viral loss of 0.5 log is observed after 1 week<br>
at 37°C.<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
A suitable pH range is between about pH 5.5 and about pH 8 for these formulations, with<br>
a most suitable range of between pH 6.0 and pH 7.7.<br>
Adipate (a food additive material) formulation is a good compromise with optimal pKa<br>
values (pKa1 5.4 and pKa2 4.43) which allow the target antacid capacity (e.g. t= 12 min) to<br>
be reached using reasonable quantities of material (about 100 mg per dose). In addition,<br>
these quantities are compatible with solubility parameters thereby allowing formulating the<br>
vaccine in a dose volume of 1.5 ml. This is not possible with the classical citrate<br>
phosphate formulations due to technical impracticalities such as the crystallization of<br>
phosphate (see comparative Example IV). They are also compatible with toxicity<br>
parameters as toxicity data are rather low (oral LD50 in rat: 5.7 g/kg) for adipate as<br>
compared to other carboxylates.<br>
11.5.3. Effect of virus titer in the vaccine dose on virus stability<br>
The following experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of the initial rotavirus titer<br>
(of 106.0,106.5,105.2) in a vaccine dose of 1.5 ml on the stability of rotavirus.<br>
Rotavirus viral titration at different points in time has been evaluated according to the<br>
procedure given in Example III.1 and the antacid capacity of the formulation according to<br>
the protocol given in Example III.2.2. The results are illustrated in Tables 23, 24, and 25.<br>

II.5.4. Formulations with adipate in the presence of calcium ions<br>
It has been reported that calcium may influence the stability and conformation of rotavirus<br>
SA11 glycoprotein VP7 expressed in Dictyostelium discoideum (K.R. Emslie et al., 1996,<br>
Journal of Biotechnology 50,149-159). It may be beneficial to add calcium ions to the<br>
adipate rotavirus liquid formulation of the invention, as they may contribute to the<br>
stabilization of rotavirus within the formulation. Accordingly, various quantities of calcium<br>
ions have been tested in the adipate formulation (Table 26). Two alternatives have been<br>
tested: CaCI2 and Ca(OH)2.<br>
Formulations 98.116-118: to 9.28 g NaOH are successively added: water (quantity<br>
determined so as to reach a final 325 g preparation), 17.00 g adipic acid, CaCI2 as<br>
specified in Table 26, (a precipitation occurs, but the precipitate redissolves after one hour<br>
stirring at room temperature, except in formulation n° 117), and 178.75 g of sucrose. The<br>

Formulation 99: to water (quantity determined so as to reach a final 325 g preparation) are<br>
successively added: Ca(OH)2 as specified in Table 26,17.00 g adipic acid, 9.02 g NaOH<br>
and 178.75 g of sucrose. The rest of the formulation steps are identical to those described<br>
for formulation 82. In this formulation DMEM represent 6% w/w. Rotavirus viral titration at<br>
different points in time has been evaluated according to the procedure given in Example<br>
111.1 and the antacid capacity of the formulation has been evaluated following the protocol<br>
given in Example III.2.2. The results are illustrated in Tables 26, 27 and 28.<br>
Formulations 119-121: to CaCl2 as specified in Table 26 are successively added: water<br>
(quantity determined so as to reach a final 325 g preparation), 9.28 g NaOH (in this case<br>
precipitation of Ca(OH)2 occur, but the precipitate redissolves after the adipic acid addition<br>
except in formulation n°121), 17.00g adipic acid and 178.75g of sucrose. The rest of the<br>

II.6.2. Rotavirus stability and antacid capacity - results<br>
The Rotavirus stability in a liquid malate formulation is related to the pH. The range of pH<br>
that was investigated, i.e. pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 gives a good stability during 1 week at<br>

necessary quantity of rotavirus to obtain 1060ffu per dose is added. In this case the dose<br>

11.15. Overal conclusion for formulations containing a carboxylate in the absence of<br>
added phosphate<br>
Several stable formulations have been prepared with various carboxylates, in the absence<br>
of added phosphate. The only phosphate present in these experimental formulations<br>
originated from the DMEM buffer and never exceeded 0.059 mM (5% w/w DMEM), 0.071<br>
mM (6% w/w DMEM), or 0.094 mM (8% w/w DMEM). All tested carboxylates have shown<br>
the ability to act as buffering agents in neutralising the stomach acidity thereby preventing<br>
or minimising the inactivation of the active ingredient, i.e. the rotavirus antigen, present in<br>
the formulation. All tested formulations, made at various administration dose volumes (i.e.<br>
1.5 ml, 2.0 ml and 2.5 ml), exhibited a pH of between about pH 5.0 to about pH 8.0, and<br>
for most formulations a pH of about pH 5.5 to about 7.5. These formulations performed<br>
well during the stability testing at the three tested storage temperatures (i.e. 37°C, room<br>
temperature or4°C). In addition, these formulations exhibited a satisfactory antacid<br>
capacity, i.e. an antacid capacity of at least 8 minutes, and for most formulations of at<br>
least 12 minutes, as assessed by the BRR test (see procedure in Example II1.2.2).<br>
In the following Table 39 is presented a short summary of the stability data obtained for<br>
selected adipate formulations according to the pH of the formulation. The following criteria<br>
were assessed: i) viral loss after storage during one week at 37°C (accelerated stability)<br>
(*), ii) time expressed in months within which the viral titer loss remains below 1.0 log<br>
(after storage at room temperature) together with the viral titer reached at the mentioned<br>
time period (**), iii) viral titer in ffu/vaccine dose reached after storage during one year (12<br>
months) at 4°C (***).<br><br>

exhibited a good, acceptable, stability profile compatible with a maximum viral titer loss of<br>
1.0 log, and the pH sub-range of about 6.0 to 6.8 (6-6.8) a good, acceptable, stability<br>
profile compatible with a maximum viral titer loss of 0.5 log.<br>
Example III - Methods<br>
lll.1 Rotavirus viral titration<br>
Detection of infectious rotaviruses is done by incubation of the formulation containing the<br>
rotavirus and various components on permissive MA104 cells (ATCC CRL 2378).<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
The Rotavirus (e.g. P43 rotavirus, ECACC 99081301) was formulated as described in the<br>
above examples. After inoculation of viral samples, the cells are incubated for 16 to 18<br>
hours. The cells are then fixed and permeabilised with acetone 80%. Infected cells are<br>
identified by indirect immuno-fiuorescence using a monoclonal anti-rotavirus antibody<br>
specific of the VP6 protein (Mab 9F6) detected by fluorescein-conjugated IgG and<br>
examined under UV microscope. Any commercially available monoclonal antibodies<br>
against rotavirus VP6 protein are suitable, and appropriate working dilutions will be<br>
determined by routine experimentation. For example the following monoclonals are<br>
suitable:<br>
-	RV 11-2 (lgG2a, ascites fluid conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate) from Rural<br>
Technologies Inc (www.ruraltechinc.com)<br>
-	5F8 F9 (lgG1, catalog number RVM-1601A-5) or 2F2 19 (lgG2b, catalog number RVM-<br>
1601B-5) from Austral Biologicals (www.australbioloqicals.com)<br>
-	MABR10 (IgG fraction) from Immunological and Biochemical testsystems Gmbh<br>
(www.afsbio.com)<br>
Anti-Vp6 rotavirus polyclonal antibodies, for example AB1129F from Chemicon<br>
(www.chemicon.com) are also suitable.<br>
Each fluorescent foci corresponds to one infectious virus. Titers are expressed as the<br>
logarithm of foci forming unit per ml (log (ffu/ml)). The precision of the viral titration is<br>
around + or - 0.2 log. Results of viral titration in ffu/ml are converted to ffu/dose according<br>
to the initial sample volume dose. All data presented in the Tables are in log base 10<br>
(log10) ffu per dose.<br>
Good results are those in which a 
(accelerated stability test) is achieved. Formulations, which exhibit a viral loss of 1 log or<br>
above, are discarded from further stability testings.<br>
III.2 Method for antacid measurement: Baby Rossett-Rice (BRR) Titration<br>
lll.2.1. Introduction<br>
The Baby Rossett-Rice (BRR) Titration test has been adapted to a baby population from<br>
the Rossett-Rice Titration test originally developed for an adult population.<br>
64<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
The Rossett-Rice titration is a well-known test used in the domain of antacid (see N.E.<br>
Rossett and Marion L Rice in Gastroenterology, 1954 volume 26 pages 490-495: 'An in<br>
vitro evaluation of the efficacy of the more frequently used antacids with particular<br>
attention to tablets'). The Rossett-Rice titration measures the rate of reaction of the<br>
antacid substance under test with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and the duration of elevated pH.<br>
To simulate the conditions in the empty stomach, fresh hydrochloric acid is added at once<br>
at the beginning of the measurement. To simulate the conditions in the stomach during<br>
the digestion process, fresh hydrochloric acid is added at a constant rate to the reaction<br>
mixture under test.<br>
Briefly, the adult Rossett-Rice titration is divided in two parts:<br>
-	the initial addition of 30 ml of 0.1N HCI, which represent the acidic content of the bolus of<br>
an empty stomach;<br>
-	followed by the continuous addition, at a rate of 4 ml/min, of 0.1 N HCI, which is a<br>
mimicry of the acid stomach secretion during digestion.<br>
Those are the experimental conditions usually considered as representative of an average<br>
adult stomach.<br>
lll.2.2. Baby Rossett-Rice titration assay<br>
Based on the standard Rossett-Rice conditions as descried in the original procedure, the<br>
test was adapted to be representative of a six month old baby stomach and is below<br>
referred to 'Baby Rossett-Rice (BRR) titration assay.<br>
According to the Geigy Scientific Tables (Volume 1 page 126, Ciba-Geigy 1981, eds), the<br>
following data are of interest as far as stomach HCI excretion is concerned (see Table 40):<br>
Table 40<br><br>

So, based on those data, we choose the most severe conditions to encompass all<br>
situations:<br>
-	Initial HCI quantity: 0.40 mmol (4ml of 0.1 N HCI)<br>
-	Continuous addition of 0.1 N HCI quantity: 2.90 mmol/h (or 0.048 mmol/min). In practii<br>
a rate of 0.5ml/min of 0.1 N HCI is used.<br>
An outline of the experimental set-up of the BRR is shown in Figure 2B.<br>
Table 41 summarizes the difference between the BRR as compared to the original<br>
published procedure.<br>

lll.2.2.1. Working procedure for the BRR assay<br>
The experimental set-up is presented in Figure 2B.<br>
1° Using a 50 ml beaker, place enough of water for injection in it in order to have, after the<br>
step n°4 (here after) a final liquid volume of 10 ml.<br>
2° Install the beaker in a water bath.<br>
3° The temperature of the water bath is adjusted in order to obtain 37°C inside the beaker.<br>
4° The sample of the antacid to be measured is added to the beaker.<br>
5° Measurement of pH value at this stage represents the "initial pH" (the t=0 in the data<br>
table).<br>
6° Add at once, 4 ml of 0.1 N HCI (0.40 mmol), and at the same time start the clock and<br>
start the pump (continuous addition of 0.5 ml/min of of 0.1 N HCI). Those three actions<br>
should all occur within the 5 first seconds of the clock starting point.<br>
7° Record the pH values along the time, until pH 4 is obtained. At the option of the<br>
operator, the decrease of the pH may be let to progress until pH 3 (as in the original<br>
Rossett-Roce method) is obtained, but the relevant antacid capacity values are recorded<br>
after pH 4 is reached.<br>
8° Stop the clock and the pump.<br>
///. 2.2.2. Presentation of the experimental data<br>
Experimental data are presented in Table for example see Table 22, from which a graphic<br>
presentation can be drawn: for example see Figure 2A.<br>
lll.2.2.3. Results interpretation<br>

WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
Rotavirus is destroyed when placed at pH below 4. In order then to preserve the virus, the<br>
time above pH 4 is of consideration. The result of the Baby Rossett-Rice titration is<br>
expressed in time units (minutes). It is the time for which the pH value was measured<br>
above 4, i.e. the so-called antacid capacity of the formulation. In some instances two<br>
values are recorded (e.g. 11-12 minutes like in Table 22 formulation n°92 where at 11 min<br>
the pH was 4.08 and at 12 min pH was 3.98, indicating that the passage at pH 4.00 was<br>
closer to 12 min than to 11 min.).<br>
lll.2.2.4. Calibration<br>
Temperature is measured with a calibrated thermometer (-10°C- +50°C scale). The pH<br>
meter is calibrated using standard buffers at pH 7 and pH 4 that are commercially<br>
available.<br>
The pump rate is adjusted by volume measurements against the time in order to obtain<br>
0.5 ml/min. The peristaltic pump is an 8 rollers model from Ismatec S.A. Model MS-Reglo.<br>
In order to avoid drops formation the tubing extremity is placed along the beaker wall<br>
above the liquid level.<br>
Hydrochloric acid 0.1N is the commercial standard titration solution.<br>
A known standard buffer solution is used to check the experimental set-up before analysis<br>
of unknown antacid samples. This standard buffer solution is made of 24.066 g of<br>
trisodiumphosphate dodecahydrate (Merck product n° 1.06578.1000) dissolved in enough<br>
water to obtain 1 liter of solution. Typically, 10 ml of this solution will give a pH of 9.0<br>
occuring between minutes n° 6 and 7 (first phosphate pH jump) and a pH of 4.0 occuring<br>
between minutes n°19 and 20 (second phosphate pH jump) in the so described Baby<br>
Rossett-Rice titration set-up. Results are shown in Table 42.<br>

III.3 Measurement of the refractive index of a given formulation<br>
Several formulations illustrated in the present invention are prepared at small volume (1.5<br>
ml dose volume for example, and below), contain a high sucrose concentration (e.g. 55%)<br>
and still must comply with the stability and antacid capacity requirements. It may be<br>
important therefore to verify that the formulation has been successfully prepared, and that<br>
complete solubilisation of each constituent has been achieved. One simple way to do this<br>
is to measure the refractive index of the formulation. Refractive index is a well-known<br>
simple measurement which can be used both at the carboxylate buffer stage (before<br>
rotavirus addition) and also at the final formulation step (after rotavirus addition).<br>
69<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
lll.3.1.	Method<br>
The index of refraction of aqueous solutions is a standard method to determine the<br>
sucrose concentration in solution. Table of refractive index versus sucrose concentrations<br>
can be find in the handbook of Chemistry and Physics 70th edition 1989-1990 CRC Press<br>
page E 386.<br>
Using a Index Instrument Automatic Refractometer GPR 11-37 instrument, a drop of<br>
solution is placed in the instrument and refractive index is recorded. Water is used as a<br>
standard to check the instrument (refractive index of 1.3330).<br>
Several adipate formulations containing various amounts of sucrose have been prepared<br>
and submitted to the refractive index measurement. A repeat measurement was made.<br>
lll.3.2.	Results<br>
The results of those measurements are shown in Figures 3A and 3B. In conclusion, in the<br>
tested concentrations window, there is a linear correlation between the sugar<br>
concentrations and other soluble ingredients and the measured refractive index.<br>
For example, in formulation n° 95, after complete dissolution of the ingredients at the<br>
carboxylate buffer stage (before addition of the rotavirus) a refractive index value of<br>
1.4578 (target sucrose concentration being 58.5%w/w in this case) will be obatined; while<br>
at the final stage of the formulation (after rotavirus addition or addition of 6% w/w DMEM<br>
in case of placebo preparation) a refractive index of 1.4480 (target sucrose concentration<br>
being 55%w/w in this case) will be obtained. In both cases, the measured refractive index<br>
values are higher that those obtained for a single 58.5% (refractive index of 1.4385) or<br>
55% (refractive index of 1.4307) sucrose in water solution, indicating the refractive index<br>
contribution of other ingredients of the buffer preparation.<br>
lll.3.3.	Conclusion<br>
Thus, the refractive index measurement can be used to check quickly, during an in<br>
process control, the complete dissolution of all the added ingredients of the formulation.<br>

IV. 1.1. Formulations 1-11:2.5 ml dose volume formulations<br>
Formulation 1-11 (see Table 43) were made at the 325 g scale (250 ml) representing 100<br>
doses of 2.5 ml (3.25 g) each. Antacid materials: NaH2PO4.2H2O (Mw 156);<br>
Na2HPO4.2H2O (Mw 178); Na3Citrate.2H2O (Mw 294).<br>
Liquid formulation 1 was prepared as follows. To 125.84 g of water (quantity determined<br>
so as to reach a final 325g preparation) are consecutively added: 7.605 g NaH2PO4.2H2O,<br>
8.677 g of Na2HPO4.2H2O, 9.555 g of Na3citrate .2H2O and 162.5 g of sucrose. After<br>
complete dissolution the solution is sterilized by filtration on a 0.2 urn membrane.<br>
10.82 g of DMEM medium containing the necessary quantity of rotavirus is added under<br>
sterile conditions to obtain 1060ffu per dose. The mix is homogenised and distributed in<br>
the appropriate dose container. In this case one dose consists of 2.5 ml or 3.25 g of the<br>
final formulated preparation. In this example DMEM medium represents 3.33 % w/w.<br>
Formulations 2-11 were prepared similarly (see ingredients and proportions in Table 43)<br>
In this series different amounts of sucrose and DMEM were tested.<br>
Similar results were obtained with the exception of formulations 7 and 11 prepared with a<br>
low (20%) sucrose concentration, which did not adequately stabilize rotavirus.<br>
IV. 1.2. Formulation 17: 2.0 ml dose volume formulation<br>
73<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
Formulation 17 (see Table 43) was made at the 325 g scale (250 ml) representing 125<br>
doses of 2.0 ml (2.60 g) each. Antacid materials: NaH2PO4.2H2O (Mw 156);<br>
Na2HPO4.2H2O (Mw 178); Na3Citrate.2H2O (Mw 294). Briefly, 110.7 g of water (quantity<br>
determined so as to reach a final 325g preparation) is weighted and 9.51 g<br>
NaH2PO4.2H2O, 10.84 g of Na2HPO4.2H2O, 11.94 g of Na3citrate .2H2O and 162.5 g of<br>
sucrose (50% w/w) are added consecutively. In this example 19.5 g DMEM is used, which<br>
represents 6 % w/w.<br>
IV.1.3. Formulations 12-16:1.5 ml dose volume formulations<br>
Further attempts to reduce the administration dose volume of those citrate/phosphate<br>
formulations (for details see Table 43) to a volume of below 2 ml failed.<br>
Concentrations of ingredients used for formulation 17 (2 ml dose volume) were adjusted to<br>
1.5 ml dose volume. Re-crystallisation of the phosphate component rapidly occurred upon<br>
storage of the formulation at 4°C. This phenomenon is due to the rather low solubility of<br>
Na2HPO4 within the phosphate citrate component (see Table 45).<br>
Table 45 - Theoretical solubility limits for phosphate and citrate<br><br>
	Solubility in water<br>
NaH2PO4.2H2O	5.44 M (20°C)<br>
Na2HPO4.2H2O	0.52 M (20°C)<br>
Na3Citrate.2H2O	1.44M(25°C)<br>
According to these parameters, attempts to formulate formulation 17 in a 1.5 ml dose<br>
volume would theoretically result in a final phosphate concentration of 0.65 M ((0.244 M +<br>
0.244 M) * 2/1.5), which is higher than the Na2HPO4 solubility data (0.52 M).<br>
To avoid this low solubility problem of phosphate, it is suggested not to use additional<br>
phosphate, and to adjust for the pH by playing on the balance between the carboxylic acid<br>
form (R-COOH) and the carboxylate salt form (R-COO). An example of this is given in<br>
formulations 100-115 made at a 2.5ml administration volume (see Table 5) or formulation<br>
128-130 realized at a 1.5 ml administration volume (see Table 6).<br>
74<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
IV. 1.4. Formulations 25-32 and 38-40:1.5 ml dose volume formulations and decreased<br>
amount of phosphate<br>
Several formulations (see Table 44 for details) containing a reduced amount of phosphate<br>
were prepared at the 325 g scale (250 ml) representing 166.6 doses of 1.5 ml (1.95 g)<br>
each. In order to compensate for this decrease in phosphate whilst maintaining an<br>
acceptable antacid capacity, citrate concentration was increased. Briefly, formulation 25<br>
was prepared by mixing 8.76 g NaH2PO4.2H20,10.00 g of Na2HPO4.2H2O, 21.00 g of<br>
Na3citrate.2H2O and 130 g of sucrose (40% w/w) are added consecutively. In this<br>
example DMEM represents 6 % w/w. Formulations 26-29 were made similarly, expected<br>
that sucrose and DMEM concentrations were slightly modified (see Table 44). Formulation<br>
30 was prepared by mixing 0.1653 g NaH2PO4.2H2O, 0.1884 g of Na2HPO4.2H2O, 32.16 g<br>
of Na3citrate.2H2O and 130 g of sucrose (40% w/w) are added consecutively. In this<br>
example DMEM represents 6 % w/w. Formulations 31 and 32 were made similarly,<br>
expected that sucrose and DMEM concentrations were slightly modified (see Table 44).<br>
Despite the fact that, in formulations 25-29, the total phosphate concentration was 0.45 M,<br>
i.e. below the theoretical solubility limit of 0.52 M for Na2HPO4, some of the formulations<br>
(for example formulations 26 and 28) exhibited recrystallisation during +4°C storage. This<br>
practical difference between the theoretical solubility value and the practical one is<br>
probably due to the presence of other compounds dissolved in the medium (sucrose,<br>
citrate or others imported via the DMEM medium), although inconsistent results were<br>
obtained for similar formulations (compare for example formulations 26 and 27). The<br>
variability experienced with such formulations is not compatible with the reliability needed<br>
when preparing large scale formulations that have to remain physically stable over a<br>
minimum period of time.<br>
Decreasing even further the amount of phosphate in the formula (see n° 30-32 and 38-40<br>
in Table 44) gives poor results in the 4-8°C viral stability (see Table 47).<br>
Other 1.5 ml dose volume formulations (18-24) have also been made in the absence of<br>
added phosphate (see Table 44 for details). The antacid capacity for these formulations<br>
was maintained at the target value of 12 min using trisodium citrate at a higher<br>
concentration (438 mM). Briefly, formulation 18 was prepared by mixing water 143.34 g<br>
(quantity determined so as to reach a final 325g preparation), 32.16 g of Na3dtrate.2H2O<br>
and 130 g of sucrose (40% w/w) are added consecutively. For formulations n°19-23<br>
75<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
various quantities of sucrose and DMEM were tested (see Table 44). For formulation 24,<br>
sucrose was used at a 50% w/w concentration (162.5 g). In these formulations, DMEM<br>
represents 6 % w/w.<br>
The pH of these formulations (n° 18-24) exceeded 8.3, at which rotavirus stability is<br>
affected as evidenced by a viral loss higher than 0.8 after one week storage at 37°C.<br>
Given the poor stability of these formulations during the rapid test at 37°C, no mid-term<br>
stability plan at either room temperature or 4°C was conducted.<br>
Those results indicate that, when less and less phosphate is included in the formulation,<br>
with more and more citrate (to maintain the antacid capacity), then, the resulting pH of the<br>
formulation is increasing more and more:<br>
-	pH around 6.7 in formulations 25-29<br>
-	pH around 7.7 in formulations 30-32 and 38-40, and<br>
-	pH around 8.3 in formulations without phosphate n° 18-24<br>
As shown hereafter (Table 46 and 47) those higher pH value are not in favour of a good<br>
rotavirus stability.<br>
Additionally, those results are in accordance with the results obtained for formulations<br>
110-115 (see Table 5) and 128-130 (see Table 6) where the pH was corrected by<br>
adjusting the citric-acid / sodium citrate ratio only (thus without additional phosphate).<br>
IV.2. Rotavirus viral titration and antacid capacity<br>
Rotavirus viral titration at different points in time has been evaluated according to the<br>
procedure given in Example ll.1 and the antacid capacity of the formulation has been<br>
evaluated following the protocol given in Example III.2. The results are illustrated in<br>

IV.3. Results and conclusions<br>
Formulations 2-3 (dose volume of 2.5 ml) and formulation 17 (dose volume decreased<br>
from 2.5 ml to 2 ml):<br>
As shown in Tables 46 and 47, a 1-log loss in viral titer resulted from a 6-month storage at<br>
room temperature for formulations 2, 3 and 17. At 4°C, no significant loss of viral titer was<br>
experienced over a storage period of up to 12 months.<br>
Formulations 25, 27, 29 and 31-32 (dose volume decreased to 1.5 ml):<br>
At room temperature, a 1-log loss in viral titration was generally reached at 3 months or<br>
earlier, except for formulation 29 which passed the 4 months' period of time. Formulations<br>
25 to 27 recrystallized during the storage period at 4°C, thus indicating that the decrease<br>
78<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
in phosphate concentration is not sufficient, as said above. Therefore such formulations<br>
are not suitable for storage periods which would be of at least one year at 4°C.<br>
When decreasing the phosphate concentration even further (formulations 30-32), the pH<br>
of the final formulation increases due to the relatively increasing amount of citrate, which<br>
is needed to maintain the same value of antacid capacity. This increase of pH affects the<br>
stability of the rotavirus and can be detected rapidly during the room temperature stability<br>
study. Those tendencies are confirmed when taking out completely the phosphate out the<br>
formulation (formulations 18 and 24).<br>
Overall conclusion of Example IV<br>
These results indicate that, in order to reach a dose volume of below 2 ml, compared to a<br>
dose volume of 2.5 ml, the amount of phosphate present in the formulation must be<br>
reduced, due to its rather low water solubility and its propency to recrystallise. As a<br>
consequence, in order to keep the same target value of antacid capacity (i.e. a minimum<br>
of at least 8 min, suitably at least 12 min as assessed by the BRR test), the citrate salt<br>
quantity must be increased. This generates an increase in the final pH of the formulation,<br>
which is detrimental for the stability of the rotavirus in the liquid formulation.<br>
Example V - Additional formulations<br>
The following formulations were prepared (Table 48), but were not included in the long-<br>

Example VI - Phase II Immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two oral doses<br>
of a human monovalent Rotavirus liquid vaccine in healthy infants<br>
VI. 1. Introduction<br>
A phase II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial was conducted to<br>
evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a vaccine containing a human<br>
attenuated G1P8 rotavirus strain (deposited at ECAAC under deposit number 99081301 -<br>
see WO 01/12797), for infant immunisation. The study was performed in multiple centers<br>
in Finland. An overview of the study design is given in Figure 4.<br>
During this trial, a first dose of the vaccine, either the liquid formulation of the candidate<br>
HRV (human rotavirus) vaccine (N=100) or the lyophilized formulation of the HRV vaccine<br>
(N=100) and respective placebo (2 groups with each N=25) was administered at around<br>
2.5 months of age (between 6 and 12 weeks of age), at the time of a first visit to the<br>
doctor. A second dose was administered at around 3.5 months of age (during the second<br>
visit to the doctor, typically 4 weeks after the first dose). A follow-up visit was performed 1<br>
month after the second dose, at around 4.5 months of age for a blood draw and<br>
evaluation of immunogenicity.<br>
The clinical trial was randomized, placebo-controlled and self-contained. A total of 250<br>
subjects, 100 per HRV group and 25 per placebo group, were enrolled. It was conducted<br>
in a double-blind manner between each HRV vaccine formulation and its respective<br>
placebo. However, between the 2 different formulations blinding was technically not<br>
possible.<br>
82<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
Routine childhood vaccinations were given according to local practice, but at least 14<br>
days apart from each dose of the HRV vaccine.<br>
VI .2. Description of the vaccine<br>
Specifically the vaccine used comprises as the rotavirus component the attenuated G1<br>
human strain deposited as ECACC deposit 99081301 (WO 01/12797).<br>
The vaccine is an attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) candidate vaccine derived from the<br>
89-12 HRV strain belonging to the serotype G1P1A and genotype [P8] that was isolated<br>
from stool of a 15-month old child in Cincinnati, USA. Natural infection with the 89-12<br>
strain was shown to provide protection against subsequent illness and against reinfection<br>
in a two-year prospective study (Bernstein Dl, et al. Protection from rotavirus reinfection: 2<br>
years prospective study. J Infect Dis. 1991; 164: 277-83).<br>
The antacid will prevent inactivation of the HRV during passage through the stomach.<br>
Table 49 compares the compositions of the adipate liquid formulation and a lyophilized<br>
formulation prepared according to WO 01/12797 and demonstrated to be efficacious in a<br>
large-scale clinical trial (De Vos et al. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2004 Oct 23 (10 Suppl): S179-<br>

* BRR = Baby Rossett-Rice (BRR) titration test: to measure the rate of reaction of the<br>
antacid substance with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and the duration of maintenance to a pH<br>
above 4. See procedure in Example III.2.2.<br>
Monodoses of the formulated adipate liquid HRV vaccine are filled according to Good<br>
Manufacturing Practices (GMP), into monodose glass syringes.<br>
Rotavirus viral titer (i.e. rotavirus potency) may be measured according to the procedure<br>
detailed in Example 111.1, with MA104 infected cells being identified by indirect immuno-<br>
fluoresence. Alternatively it is measured by in vitro titration of the virus on MA104 cells<br>
84<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
with virus detected by direct immuno-fluorescence using specific anti-rotavirus antibodies.<br>
The method determines the dose infecting 50% of the cell culture and rotavirus titers are<br>
expressed in median Cell Culture Infective Dose (CCID50). The inter- and intra-assay<br>
reproducibility has been evaluated and gives equivalent results (variability is assessed at<br>
0.3 log).<br>
VI.3. Administration<br>
VI. 3.1. Lyophilized formulation of HRV vaccine or placebo<br>
To prepare the vaccine or placebo for administration, the entire content of one pre-filled<br>
syringe containing the calcium carbonate buffer was injected into the vial of the lyophilized<br>
product (vaccine or placebo) and the resuspended product was then administered<br>
smoothly as a single oral dose.<br>
VI.3.2. Liquid formulation of HRV vaccine or placebo<br>
The pre-filled glass syringe was shaken before use. The product (vaccine or placebo) was<br>
then administered smoothly as a single oral dose.<br>
VIA Safety and reactoqenicity<br>
The following criteria of safety and reactogenicity applied:solicited general adverse events<br>
were fever, irritability/fussiness, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of appetite and cough/runny<br>
nose. They were recorded during 15 days after each study vaccine dose, using diary<br>
cards provided to the parents/guardians of the subjects to record the observed symptoms.<br>
All gastroenteritis events (diarrhoea) occurring between visits were documented, and stool<br>
samples were collected (at the latest 7 days after onset of the gastroenteritis). Unsolicited<br>
adverse events occurring within 31 days after each dose were recorded. Serious adverse<br>
events were recorded during the entire study period.<br>
VI. 5. Laboratory assays<br>
VI. 5.1. Stool analysis<br>
85<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
Stool samples collected from all subjects on the day of or one day prior to each study<br>
vaccine dose, on Day 7 ± 1 and on Day 15+1 after each dose, and on the day of or one<br>
day prior to Visit 3 are being analyzed at GSK Biologicals or a laboratory designated by<br>
GSK Biologicals to detect the presence of vaccine RV using Enzyme Linked<br>
lmmunosorbent Assay (ELISA- see section Vl.6.1) to assess viral shedding.<br>
Presence of rotavirus antigen demonstrated by ELISA in any stool collected at pre-<br>
determined time points after Dose 1 up to Visit 3 are considered as vaccine virus<br>
shedding and taken as evidence of a vaccine response (i.e. vaccine take), if the subject<br>
was negative for rotavirus on the day of Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo. For placebo<br>
subjects sequencing is performed in this case.<br>
A subject initially negative for rotavirus is defined as a subject who was negative for anti-<br>
rotavirus IgA antibodies in serum and for rotavirus antigen in a stool sample at a pre-<br>
vaccination time point, if both results are available, or negative for at least one of these<br>
markers if only one result is available.<br>
Also, stool samples collected during each GE episode from Visit 1 until Visit 3 are being<br>
tested at GSK Biologicals or a laboratory designated by GSK Biologicals using ELISA to<br>
detect RV. If positive, the G type is determined using PCR-based approaches. These<br>
molecular methods target regions within the VP7 gene which are very distinct among<br>
different G types and are highly conserved within each given G type. For example, the<br>
RT-PCR method developed by Gouvea et al. (1990, J Clin Microbiol., 28:276-282) uses a<br>
cocktail of different genotype-specific primers, located in different regions of the VP7<br>
gene. The size of the resulting PCR products estimated by gel electrophoresis provides<br>
the information to identify the corresponding G-genotypes. If any G1 RV is detected,<br>
vaccine virus is differentiated from the wild type serotype by sequence analysis or an<br>
equivalent approach.<br>
Any detection of vaccine virus in any stool collected up to Visit 3 is taken as evidence of a<br>
vaccine response (i.e. vaccine take).<br>
VI. 5.1. Serum analysis<br>
Serum obtained from whole blood samples collected from subjects at each study visit<br>
were tested by ELISA at GSK Biologicals' designated laboratory to measure serum anti-<br>
86<br><br>
WO 2006/087205	PCT/EP2006/001442<br>
rotavirus IgA antibody concentrations. The assay cut-off is 20 U/ml. A seronegative<br>
subject for anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies was defined as a subject who had antibody<br>
concentration below the assay cut-off value. A seropositive subject for anti-rotavirus IgA<br>
antibodies was defined as a subject who had antibody concentration greater than or equal<br>
to the assay cut-off value.<br>
VI.6. lmmunoqenicity: Serum Analysis<br>
VI. 6.1. Measurement of IgA Antibodies by ELISA<br>
This assay allows the detection of rotavirus IgA in human serum and was initially designed<br>
by R. Ward (1, 2) and has been adapted by GSK Biologicals. It was used for measuring<br>
the immune response after vaccination and/or infection. Samples were analyzed at GSK<br>
Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium (or designated laboratory).<br>
Description of the ELISA Assay<br>
96-well plates are coated by overnight incubation with anti-rotavirus antibody dilutions.<br>
The wells are washed and a lysate of cells either infected with vaccine strain (positive<br>
wells) or either uninfected (negative wells) is added. Following incubation on a rotating<br>
platform, the plates are washed and the dilutions of serum samples or standard serum are<br>
incubated in both kinds of wells (positive and negative). The use of negative wells allows<br>
the assessment of non-specific IgA binding.<br>
The plates are washed and bound human IgA is detected by addition of biotinylated rabbit<br>
anti-human IgA (30 minutes under agitation). After washing the plates, peroxidase-<br>
conjugated avidin-biotin at an optimal concentration is added to each well and incubated<br>
(30 minutes, RT under agitation). Plates are again washed and orthophenylenediamine<br>
(OPD) is added. The plates are then incubated (30 minutes, room temperature (RT) in<br>
darkness) before the reaction is stopped with 2N H2SO4. Optical absorption is measured<br>
at 490/620 nm. Specific optical densities are calculated for each sample / standard by<br>
measuring the difference between positive and negative wells. Concentrations of the<br>
samples are determined by using the four-parameter logistic function generated by the<br>
standard curve. The most accurate part of the standard curve (working range) for the<br>
calculation of the results is determined. Antibody concentrations in units per milliliter<br>
(U/ml) are calculated relative to the standard (concentration = 1000U/ml) by averaging the<br>
values for each unknown that fall within the working range of the standard curve and then<br>
corrected for the dilution factor. Each experiment includes negative and positive controls.<br>
For all reagents optimal concentration are pre-determined.<br>
