PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br>
11-10-2006<br><br>
This invention relates to the technical sector of suspensions of mineral matter, and, before and/or after drying, their applications in the paper and paint industry, and, after drying, plastics, and more particularly in their paper applications, including, in particular, the field of paper coating colours, with a view to offering an improvement in the gloss, especially the gloss of the paper sheet.<br>
The invention first of all relates to the use of a water-soluble copolymer, preferably a weakly ionic and water-soluble copolymer having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, as an agent whose role is to improve the gloss of the finished product and in particular the gloss of the paper sheet, irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°.<br>
The invention also relates to an agent for improving the gloss of the finished product, irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, more particularly between 45° and 75°.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a water-soluble copolymer, preferably a weakly ionic water-soluble copolymer having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, as an agent whose role is to improve the gloss of the finished product and in particular the gloss of the paper sheet, irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°, and its implementation in a pigment and/or mineral filler dispersion method in aqueous suspension. It also relates to the dispersion method that implements said copolymer and the aqueous suspensions thus obtained.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a water-soluble copolymer, preferably a weakly ionic water-soluble copolymer having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, as an agent whose role is to enhance the gloss of the finished product, in particular the gloss of the sheet of paper, irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75° and its implementation in a pigment and/or mineral filler grinding method in aqueous suspension. It also relates to the grinding method that implements said copolymer and the aqueous suspensions thus obtained.<br>
It also relates to the use of said aqueous suspensions for the manufacture of coating colours. It also relates to the coating<br>
colour manufacturing method that implements said copolymer and the coating colours thus obtained.<br>
Finally, it also relates to the use of said coating colours for coating the papers. It also relates to the papers thus obtained.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a water-soluble copolymer, preferably a weakly ionic water-soluble copolymer having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, as an agent whose role is to improve the gloss of the finished product, in particular the gloss of the paper sheet, irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°, and its implementation in a coating colour manufacturing method. It also relates to the coating colours thus obtained.<br>
It also relates to the use of the coating colours thus obtained for coating the papers. Finally, it relates to the papers thus obtained.<br><br><br><br><br>
Finally, the invention also relates to the use of a water-soluble copolymer, preferably a weakly ionic water-soluble copolymer having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function, as a gloss enhancement agent in the field of paint and plastics.<br>
The paper manufacturing method comprises several stages, including: the slurrying of the pigments and/or fillers; the use of said suspensions or slurries to manufacture fillers and/or coating colours; the use of said coating colours and said fillers to manufacture and/or coat the papers. Throughout this method, the skilled man in the art will keep in mind the need to obtain a final product presenting a strong activation of the gloss, as the enhancement of the gloss of the paper sheet is a matter of major concern for paper manufacturers. This property of enhancing the gloss of the paper sheet, together with the known means for enhancing the gloss during the course of the method described above, are subsequently illustrated via documents accessible to one skilled in the prior art.<br>
During the course of said method, the mineral fillers and/or pigments, such as calcium carbonate, dolomites, magnesium hydroxide, kaolin, talc, gypsum, titanium oxide, satin white or aluminium trihydroxide, are initially slurried. To do this, use is made of the dispersion and/or grinding aid agents of these pigments and/or mineral fillers still referred to as mineral matter.<br>
It is to be noted that, throughout the description, we refer to both mineral matter and fillers and/or pigments, as these terms have the same meaning for the Applicant.<br>
These dispersion and/or grinding aid agents behave as rheology modifiers in so far as they fluidify said suspensions. The mechanical action of grinding, facilitated by the use of grinding aid agents, also contributes to reducing the size of the particles. Use can also be made of additives that make it possible to regulate the viscosity of said suspensions of mineral matter.<br>
Thus, the skilled man in the art will be familiar with document EP 0 610 534 which teaches how to prepare polymers obtained by the copolymerization of an isocyanate monomer and aprotic monomers and then by functionization using glycol polyalkylene monoalkyl amines or ethers. Such agents are particularly effective for grinding organic pigments.<br>
He will also be familiar with document WO 00/77058 which describes copolymers based on an unsaturated derivative of a mono- or dicarboxyl acid, of oxyalkylene glycol ether, of vinyl polyalkylene glycol, of a polysiloxane compound or of an ester These copolymers are used as dispersing agents in mineral filler suspensions, particularly in the cement industry.<br>
He will also be familiar with document WO 01/96007, which describes an ionic, water-soluble copolymer, having a grafted alkoxy polyalkylene glycol function, the role of which is to disperse and/or facilitate the grinding of the pigments and/or the mineral fillers.<br>
Similarly, the skilled man in the art will be familiar with document FR 2 707 182 which teaches how to use a polymeric compound based on polyacrylic acid salts and phosphonates to fluidify suspensions of inorganic pigments.<br><br>
Moreover, document WO 94/24202 proposes non water-soluble latexes for coating compositions but these do not make it possible to attain high gloss values irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°.<br>
However, neither this document, nor the others that appear in the prior art, teach that grafting an alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol group enhances the gloss of the paper sheet irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°.<br>
Said aqueous suspensions of pigments and/or of mineral fillers then enter into the composition of the coating colours.<br>
Pursuing his her research with a view to increasing the gloss, in particular the gloss of the paper sheet, the Applicant surprisingly found that the use in mineral filler grinding method, mineral filler dispersion method, and coating colour manufacturing method, of a water-soluble copolymer, preferably a weakly ionic water-soluble copolymer having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, an intrinsic viscosity less than or equal to 100 ml/g determined in accordance with the method described in the rest of the description and known as the intrinsic viscosity method, makes it possible to increase the gloss, particularly the gloss of the paper sheet irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°.<br>
In this manner, the use in accordance with the invention of a weakly ionic and water-soluble copolymer as gloss activator, particularly as activator of the gloss of the paper sheet, irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20° and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°, is characterized in that the copolymer has at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and in that said copolymer has an intrinsic viscosity less than or equal to 100 ml/g, determined in accordance with the method known as the intrinsic viscosity method<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the copolymer is determined in accordance with the method described in Vollmert publication "Outlines of macromolecular chemistry" volume III, Vollmert Verlag, Karlsruhe 1985 and by the implementation of a solution of demineralized water and a capillary tube defined in standard DIN 53101/0a, of constant 0.005 and diameter equal to 0.53 mm. This method will be referred to as the intrinsic viscosity method in this application.<br>
A second method that can be used to determine the intrinsic viscosity uses a 6% solution of NaCI and the same equipment as described above.<br>
In the examples where this second method is used in addition to the first method, the intrinsic viscosity values obtained using this second method correspond to the second value indicated.<br>
More specifically, the Applicant found that the presence in said copolymer of at least one monomer of formula (I):<br><br><br>
where<br>
m and p represent a number of alkylene oxide units less than or equal to 150<br>
n represents a number of ethylene oxide units less than or equal to 150<br>

substituted, or to the group of ethylenically unsaturated amides or imides,<br>

made it possible to develop weakly ionic and water-soluble copolymers having at least one alkoxy or hydroxy polyalkylene glycol function grafted onto at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, thereby improving the gloss, in particular the gloss of the paper sheet irrespective of the viewing angle, i.e. an angle of between 20s and 85°, and more particularly between 45° and 75°.<br>

The scope and interest of the invention will be better perceived thanks to the following examples, which are not of a comprehensive nature.<br>

This example relates to the use of copolymers according to the invention in a mineral filler grinding method. It also relates to the use of the suspensions thus obtained in the manufacture of paper coating colours, said coating colours being used to coat papers. This example also relates to the measurement of the gloss of the papers obtained. In this example for tests 1 and 2, the support paper used is a paper pre-coated with a calcium carbonate marketed by Omya under the name Covercarb™ 60ME. This support has the following characteristics:<br>

Test No. 1<br>
This test illustrates the prior art and implements a suspension of ground calcium carbonate with 0.9% by weight with respect<br>
to the dry weight of calcium carbonate, of sodium and magnesium polyacrylate of an intrinsic viscosity equal to 7.8 ml/g<br>
according to the above-mentioned intrinsic viscosity method, and of a grain size such that 97% by weight of the particles<br>
have a diameter of less than 2 |jm and 81% in weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 1 [tm measured on the<br>
Sedigraph™ 5100.<br>
This calcium carbonate has a PDDPC cationic polymer demand equal to 33990 u. Vat/kg, said cationic polymer demand<br>
being measured using the Mettler DL 77 titrator and the Miitec PCD 02 detector by means of the cationic titration method<br>
that uses 0.005 mole of a 20% solution of poly(N,N-dimethyl-3,5-dimethylene-piperidium (PDDPC) chloride sold by Acros<br>
Organics.<br>
Said suspension will then enter into the composition of the coating colour to be tested, consisting of:<br>
80 parts by dry weight of the calcium carbonate aqueous suspension to be tested, 5 parts by dry weight of a coarser calcium carbonate slurry, 15 parts of delaminated kaolin 9.5 parts of binder<br>
0.32 parts of carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.6 parts of polyvinyl alcohol 0.15 parts of optical brightener, and 0.4 parts of calcium stearate and prepared to 68% dry matter concentration, as follows.<br><br><br>
In a recipient containing 20 kg of water and 0.125 kg of a sodium polyacrylate with dry matter concentration equal to 42% and intrinsic viscosity equal to 6.2 ml/g as per the above-mentioned intrinsic viscosity method, 22.5 kg of an aqueous suspension, of 78.2% dry matter concentration, of coarser calcium carbonate marketed by Omya under the name Hydrocarb™ 60, and 356.5 kg of an aqueous suspension, with 78.5% dry matter concentration, of the calcium carbonate suspension to be tested are mixed.<br>
Once the calcium carbonates have been mixed, 52.5 kg of a delaminated kaolin marketed by Kaolin International B.V. under the name Amazon™ 88 are added while stirring at an average speed.<br>
Stirring is continued at average speed for 15 minutes and, following visual verification of whether or not agglomerates are present, stirring is continued until the few agglomerates disappear, or is stopped if there are no agglomerates.<br>
7.5 kg of a 15% aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose previously dissolved for at least 20 minutes at least 90° C and marketed by Noviant under the name CMC Finnfix™ 10 are then added.<br>
8.4 kg of a 25% aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol previously dissolved for at least 20 minutes at least 90° C and marketed by Clariant under the name Mowiol™ 4-98 are then added.<br>
28 kg of a 50% by weight aqueous dispersion of styrene-butadiene marketed by Dow Europe under the name Dow Latex DL 940 and 38.5 kg of a 50% by weight aqueous dispersion of an acrylic ester copolymer marketed by BASF under the name Acronal™ S 360 D are then added as binder.<br>
Finally, 1.9 kg of optical brightener in the form of an aqueous derivative of 4.4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid marketed by Bayer under the name Blancophor™ P and 2.8 kg of a 50% concentration by dry weight aqueous dispersion of a calcium stearate sold by Henkel-Nopco AS under the name Nopcote™ C-104 are added.<br>
Once these additions are made, stirring is maintained for another 15 minutes.<br>
The pH of the coating colour is then checked and brought to a value of approximately 9 by means of a 10% soda solution.<br>
The dry matter content of the coating colour is also checked and brought to a value of approximately 68.5% by adding water if necessary.<br>
The Brookfield™ viscosity of the coating colour obtained as measured at 32"C using the Brookfield™ DV-II+ model viscometer fitted with the corresponding spindle is equal to 6100 mPa.s at 20 min-1 and 1800 mPa.s at 100 min1.<br>
The coating colour obtained is used to coat the above-mentioned sheets of support paper using a Combiblades pilot coater from Jagenberg GmbH fitted with a 0.457 mm thick blade.<br><br><br>
A "long dwell" head is used with a blade angle of 45°. The coating speed is 1000 m/s and the average coating deposited is 11 g/m2 on each surface of the paper.<br>
The relative humidity obtained for each paper is of the order of 4.2% to 4.6% weight for weight.<br>
The paper thus coated is then calendered using a supercalender with 9 contact zones between the ten rollers, marketed by Kleinewefers.<br>
The iron calendering diameter is 180 mm and 270 mm with respect to the cotton.<br>
The supercalendering is determined by the measurement of the ISO 2813 20", 60° and 85° gloss of the coated paper, which consists in passing the coated and calendered paper sheet in the BYK-Gardner "haze gloss" laboratory glossmeter on paper with glass support.<br>
Once this gloss measurement is made, the paper samples are cut into DIN A3 format and are conditioned in an air conditioned room as per standard DIN EN 20187 to determine the 45° DIN, 75° DIN (DIN 54 502) and 75° TAPPI gloss values.<br>
The values of the various glosses are given in table 1 at the end of test 2.<br>
Test No. 2<br>
This test illustrates the invention and implements, as a grinding aid agent, 1.8% by dry weight, with respect to the dry weight<br>
of calcium carbonate, of a copolymer consisting, by weight, of:<br>

Rt represents hydrogen<br>
R2 represents hydrogen<br>
R represents the vinyl group<br>
R' represents the methyl radical<br>
where m = p = 0; n = 114; q = 1 and (m+n+p)q = 114<br>

R represents the methacrylate group A represents the propyl radical B represents the methyl radical<br>
of intrinsic viscosity equal to 39.5 ml/g according to the above-mentioned intrinsic viscosity method (and equal to 30.3 ml/g according to the second method) to obtain by grinding in two stages, a suspension of calcium carbonate with 74.7% by weight of dry matter and of grain size such that 98% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 2 pm and 78% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 1 pm measured on the Sedigraph™ 5100.<br><br><br>
This two-stage grinding method consists in grinding, during the first stage, a suspension of calcium carbonate of initial average diameter equal to 5 u.m measured using the Sedigraph™ 5100 particle size analyzer in an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate to a grain size such that 62% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 2 pm and 37% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 1 ^m measured using the Sedigraph™ 5100, then in grinding this suspension until the desired final grain size is obtained.<br>
When grinding is completed, the Brookfield™ viscosity of the suspension is measured using a model RVT Brookfield™ viscometer, at a temperature of 23°C and a speed of rotation of 100 mm with the appropriate spindle.<br>
This gives a Brookfield™ viscosity equal to 750 mPa.s.<br>
One hour after the end of grinding, a sample of the pigmentary suspension, the grain size of which (98% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 2 ym and 78% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 1 pm) is measured using a Sedigraph™ 5100 particle size analyzer, is recovered in a beaker.<br>
Having left this sample lie in the beaker for 7 days, the Brookfield™ viscosity of the suspension is measured by introducing, after stirring the beaker for 5 minutes, the appropriate spindle of the RVT model Brookfield™ viscometer, at a temperature of 23°C and a speed of rotation of 100 rpm. This gives a value of 680 mPa.s which constitutes the Brookfield™ viscosity value known as Brookfield™ APAG (after stirring) viscosity.<br>
The BET specific surface area of the pigment obtained, determined according to standard ISO 9277, is equal to 7.5 m2/g<br>
The cationic demand of the pigment obtained, determined according to the above-mentioned PDDPC method, is equal to 3850 u. Val/kg.<br>

Once the calcium carbonates have been mixed, 52.5 kg of a delaminated kaolin marketed by Kaolin Intemational B.V. under the name Amazon™ 88 are added while stirring at an average speed.<br>
Stirring is continued at average speed for 15 minutes and, following visual verification of whether or not agglomerates are present, stirring is continued until the few agglomerates disappear, or is stopped if there are no agglomerates.<br>
7.5 kg of a 15% aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose previously dissolved for at least 20 minutes at least 90oC C and marketed by Noviant under the name CMC Finnfix™ 10 are then added.<br>

The pH of the coating colour is then checked and brought to a value of approximately 9 by means of a 10% soda solution.<br>
The dry matter content of the coating colour is also checked and brought to a value of approximately 68.5% by adding water if necessary.<br>
The Brookfield™ viscosity of the coating colour obtained as measured at 32°C using the Brookfield™ DV-II+ model viscometer fitted with the corresponding spindle is equal to 3600 mPa.s at 20 min-1 and 1200 mPa.s at 100 mhr1.<br>
The coating colour obtained is used to coat the above-mentioned sheets of support paper using a Combiblades pilot coater from Jagenberg GmbH fitted with a 0.457 mm thick blade following the same procedure and using the same equipment as in test No. 1.<br>
As the paper is coated and calendered following the same procedure and using the same equipment as in test No. 1, the 45° DIN, 75° DIN (DIN 54 502) and 75° TAPPI gloss values are determined following the same procedure and using the same equipment as in test No. 1.<br><br>

To do this, use is made of a Dyno-Mill™ type fixed-cylinder grinder with rotating impeller, the grinding body of which consists of zirconium based beads with a diameter of between 0.6 millimetres and 1 millimetre.<br>

suspension resulting from the grinding and the grinding body.<br>
The temperature during each grinding test is maintained at approximately 60°C.<br>
When grinding is complete, the dry matter concentration is equal to 74.7% and the Brookfield™ viscosity of the suspension is measured using a model RVT type Brookfield™ viscometer, at a temperature of 23°C and a speed of rotation of 100 rpm with the appropriate spindle.<br>

This gives a value of 2240 mPa.s which constitutes the Brookfield™ viscosity value known as Brookfield™ AVAG (before stirring) viscosity.<br>
The same Brookfield™ viscosity measurements are also made once the beaker has been stirred for 5 minutes and<br>
constitute APAG (after stirring) viscosity results. The result obtained is 686 mPa.s.<br>

Once these additives are made, stirring is maintained for another 15 minutes.<br>
The pH of the coating colour is then checked and brought to a value of 8.6 by means of a 10% soda solution.<br>
The dry matter content of the coating colour is also checked and brought to a value of 59.8% by adding water if necessary.<br>
The Brookfield™ viscosity of the coating colour obtained as measured at 32°C using the Brookfield ™ RVT model viscometer fitted with the corresponding spindle is equal to 1250 mPa.s at 10 min1 and 340 mPa.s at 100 min-1.<br>
The coating colour obtained is used to coat a 21 x 29.7 cm sheet of paper with a specific weight of 96 g/m2 by means of a coater from K-Coater laboratory by implementing the same procedure and using the same equipment as in test No. 14.<br>
The paper thus coated is then calendered following the same procedure and using the same equipment as those used in test No. 14.<br>
The 75° TAPPI gloss value according to Lehmann using the gloss meter from BYK-Gardner is equal to 73.0.<br>
It can be observed from the gloss results of tests No. 14 and 17 that the paper coated with coating colours containing the copolymer according to the invention used as additive of the coating colour have a higher gloss than paper coated with the standard coating colours.<br>
