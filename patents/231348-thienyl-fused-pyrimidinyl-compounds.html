FIELD  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  new  heteroaryl-fused  pyrimidinyl  compounds,<br>
their  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts,  and  prodrugs  thereof;  compositions  of  the  new<br>
compounds,  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  at  least  one  Additional  therapeutic  agent,<br>
with  a  pharmaceutically  acceptable  carrier;  and  uses  of  the  new  compounds,  either  alone<br>
or  in  combination  with  at  least  one  additional  therapeutic  agent,  in  the  prophylaxis  or<br>
treatment  of  proliferative  diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
Kinesins  are  motor  proteins  that  use  adenosine  triphosphate  to  bind  to<br>
microtubules  and  generate  mechanical  force.  Kinesins  are  characterized  by  a  motor<br>
domain  having  about  350  amino  acid  residues.  The  crystal  s|tructures  of  several  kinesin<br>
motor  domains  have  been  resolved.<br>
Currently,  about  one  hundred  kinesin-related  proteins  (KRP)  have  been  identified.<br>
Kinesins  are  involved  in  a  variety  of  cell  biological  processes  including  transport  of<br>
organelles  and  vesicles,  and  maintenance  of  the  endoplasmatic  reticulum.  Several  KRPs<br>
interact  with  me  microtubules  of  the  mitotic  spindle  or  with  the  chromosomes  directly,<br>
and  appear  to  play  a  pivotal  role  during  the  mitotic  stages  of  the  cell  cycle.  These  mitotic<br>
KRPs  are  of  particular  interest  for  the  development  of  cancer  therapeutics.<br>
KSP  (also  known  as  Eg5,  HsKSP  kinesin,  KNSL1,)  is  one  of  several  kinesin-like<br>
motor  proteins  that  are  localized  to  the  mitotic  spindle  and  known  to  be  required  for<br>
formation  and/or  function  of  the  bipolar  mitotic  spindle.<br>
In  1995,  the  depletion  of  KSP  kinesin  using  an  antibody  directed  against  the<br>
C-terminus  of  KSP  was  shown  to  arrest  HeLa  cells  in  mitosis  with  monoastral<br>
microtubule  arrays  (Blangy  et  al.,  Cell  55:1159-1169,  1995).  Mutations  in  bimC  and<br>
cut7  genes,  which  are  considered  to  be  homologues  of  KSP  kinesin,  cause  failure  in<br>
centrosome  separation  in  Aspergillus  nidulans  (Enos,A.P.,  and  N.R.  Morris,<br>
Cell  6"0:1O19-1O27,1990)  and  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  (Hagan,  L,  and  M.  Yanagida,<br>
Nature  347:563-566,  1990).  Treatment  of  cells  with  either  ATRA  (all  trans-retinoic<br>
acid),  which  reduces  HsKSP  kinesin  expression  on  protein  level,  or  depletion  of  HsKSP<br>
kinesin  using  antisense  oligonucleotides  revealed  a  significant  growth  inhibition  in<br>
DAN-G  pancreatic  carcinoma  cells  indicating  that  HsKSP  kinesin  might  be  involved  in+<br><br>
the  antiproliferative  action  of  all  trans-retinoic  acid  (Kaiser,  A-,  et  al.,  J.  Biol.  Chem.  274,<br>
18925-18931,  1999).  Interestingly,  the  Xenopus  laevis  Aurora-related  protein  kinase<br>
pEg2  was  shown  to  associate  and  phosphorylate  X1KSP  kinesin  (Giet,  R.,  et  al.,  J.  Biol.<br>
Chem.  274:15005-15013,  1999).  Potential  substrates  of  Aurora-related  kinases  are  of<br>
particular  interest  for  cancer  drug  development  For  example,  Aurora  1  and  2  kinases  are<br>
overexpressed  on  protein  and  RNA  level  and  the  genes  are  amplified  in  colon  cancer<br>
patients.<br>
The  first  cell  permeable  small  molecule  inhibitor  for  HsKSP  kinesin,  "monastrol",<br>
was  shown  to  arrest  cells  with  monopolar  spindles  without  affecting  microtubule<br>
polymerization  as  do  conventional  chemotherapeutics  such  as  taxanes  and  vinca  alkaloids<br>
(Mayer,  T.U.,  et  al.,  Science  286:971-974,  1999).  Monastrol  was  identified  as  an<br>
inhibitor  in  phenotype-based  screens  and  it  was  suggested  that  this  compound  may  serve<br>
as  a  lead  for  the  development  of  anticancer  drugs.  The  inhibition  was  determined  not  to<br>
be  competitive  in  respect  to  adenosine  triphosphate  and  to  be  rapidly  reversible<br>
(DeBonis,  S.,  et  al.,  Biochemistry  42:338-349,  2003;  Kapoor,  T.M.,  et  al.,  J.  Cell<br>
Biol.  150:975-988,2000).<br>
Recently,  other  KSP  kinesin  inhibitors  have  been  described.  WO  02/057244  and<br>
WO  02/056880  describe  phenothiazine  compounds  and  triphenylmethane  compounds,<br>
respectively,  for  treating  proliferative  diseases.  WO  02/078639  describes<br>
cyano-substituted  dihydropyrimidine  compounds  for  treating  proliferative  diseases.<br>
U.S.  Patent  No.  6,472,521  describes  oligonucleotides  and  oligonucleotide  derivatives  for<br>
inhibiting  human  KSP  expression.<br>
WO  01/98278,  WO  01/30768,  and  WO  03/039460  describe  quinazolinone<br>
compounds  that  are  useful  in  treating  cellular  proliferative  diseases  associated  with  KSP<br>
kinesin  activity.	The  compounds  described  in  these  references  are<br>
2-(2-aminomemyl)quinazolinone  derivatives.  The  quinazolinone  compounds  described<br>
in  WO  01/98278  and  WO  01/30768  have  2-aminomethyl  substituents  that  are  either<br>
amine,  amide,  or  sulfonamide  substituents.  The  quinazolinone  compounds  described  in<br>
WO  03/039460  have  the  amino  group  of  the  2-aminomethyl  substituent  incorporated  into<br>
a  5-12  membered  nitrogen-containing  heterocycle.<br>
WO  03/050064  describes  thienopyrimidinone  compunds  that  are  useful  for<br>
treating  cellular  proliferative  disease,  for  treating  disorders  associated  with  KSP  kinesin<br>
activity,  and  for  inhibiting  KSP  kinesin.<br><br>
WO  03/103575  describes  heterocyclic-fused  pyrimidinone  derivatives  that  are<br>
inhibitors  of  the  mitotic  kinesin  KSP  and  that  are  useful  in  the  treatment  of  cellular<br>
proliferative  diseases.  These  derivatives  are  N-heterocyclic-fused  pyrimidinone<br>
derivatives.	Representative  derivatives  that  are  described  include<br>
pyrido[α,β-γ]pyrimidin-δ-ones,	pyrimido[α,β-γ]pyrimidin-δ-ones,<br>
pyrimido[α,β-γ]pyridazin-δ-ones,  and  pteridin-4-ones.<br>

acid.  Representative  carboxy-protecting  groups  include,  for  example,  alkyl  esters,<br>
secondary  amides  and  the  like.<br>
Certain  of  the  compounds  of  the  invention  comprise  asymmetrically  substituted<br>
carbon  atoms.  Such  asymmetrically  substituted  carbon  atoms  can  result  in  the<br>
compounds  of  the  invention  comprising  mixtures  of  stereoisomers  at  a  particular<br>
asymmetrically  substituted  carbon  atom  or  a  single  stereoisomer.  As  a  result,  racemic<br>
mixtures,  mixtures  of  diastereomers,  as  well  as  single  diastereomers  of  the  compounds  of<br>
the  invention  are  included  in  the  present  invention.  The  terms  "S"  and  "R"  configuration,<br>
as  used  herein,  are  as  defined  by  the  IUPAC  1974  "RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  SECTION  E,<br>
FUNDAMENTAL  STEREOCHEMISTRY,"  Pure  Appl  Chem.  45:13-30,1976.  The  terms  a  and<br>
β  are  employed  for  ring  positions  of  cyclic  compounds.  The  α-side  of  the  reference  plane<br>
is  that  side  on  which  the  preferred  substituent  lies  at  the  lower  numbered  position.  Those<br>
substituents  lying  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  reference  plane  are  assigned  β  descriptor.  It<br>
should  be  noted  that  this  usage  differs  from  that  for  cyclic  stereoparents,  in  which  "α"<br>
means  "below  the  plane"  and  denotes  absolute  configuration.  The  terms  a  and  β<br>
configuration,  as  used  herein,  are  as  defined  by  the  "Chemical  Abstracts  Index  Guide,"<br>
Appendix  IV,  paragraph  203,1987.<br>

halides  like  benzyl  and  phenethyl  bromides,  and  others.  Water  or  oil-soluble  or<br>
dispersible  products  are  thereby  obtained.<br>
Examples  of  acids  that  may  be  employed  to  form  pharmaceutically  acceptable<br>
acid  addition  salts  include  such  inorganic  acids  as  hydrochloric  acid,  sulfuric  acid  and<br>
phosphoric  acid  and  such  organic  acids  as  oxalic  acid,  maleic  acid,  methanesulfonic  acid,<br>
succinic  acid  and  citric  acid.  Basic  addition  salts  can  be  prepared  in  situ  during  the  final<br>
isolation  and  purification  of  the  compounds  of  formula  (I),  (DOT),  or  (HI),  or  separately  by<br>
reacting  carboxylic  acid  moieties  with  a  suitable  base  such  as  the  hydroxide,  carbonate  or<br>
bicarbonate  of  a  pharmaceutically  acceptable  metal  cation  or  with  ammonia,  or  an<br>
organic  primary,  secondary  or  tertiary  amine.  Pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  include,<br>
but  are  not  limited  to,  cations  based  on  the  alkali  and  alkaline  earth  metals,  such  as<br>
sodium,  lithium,  potassium,  calcium,  magnesium,  aluminum  salts  and  the  like,  as  well  as<br>
nontoxic  ammonium,  quaternary  ammonium,  and  amine  cations,  including,  but  not<br>
limited  to  ammonium,  tetramethylammonium,  tetraethylammonium,  methylamine,<br>
dimethylamine,  trimethylamine,  triethylamine,  emylaminle,  and  the  like.  Other<br>

The  term  "pharmaceutically  acceptable  prodrugs"  as  used  herein  refers  to  those<br>
prodrugs  of  the  compounds  of  the  present  invention  which  are,  within  the  scope  of  sound<br>
medical  judgment,  suitable  for  use  in  contact  with  the  tissues  of  humans  and  lower<br>
animals  without  undue  toxicity,  irritation,  allergic  response,  and  the  like,  commensurate<br>
with  a  reasonable  benefit/risk  ratio,  and  effective  for  their  intended  use,  as  well  as  the<br>
zwitterionic  forms,  where  possible,  of  the  compounds  of]  the  invention.  The  term<br>
"prodrug"  refers  to  compounds  that  are  rapidly  transformed  in  vivo  to  yield  a  parent<br>
compound  of  one  of  formula  (I),  (II),  or  (III),  for  example,  by  hydrolysis  in  blood.  A<br>
thorough  discussion  of  prodrugs  is  provided  in  Higuchi,  T.,  and  V.  Stella,  "Pro-drugs  as<br>
Novel  Delivery  Systems,"  A.C.S.  Symposium  Series  14,  and  in  "Bioreversible  Carriers  in<br>
Drug  Design,"  in  Edward  B.  Roche  (ed.),  American  Pharmaceutical  Association,<br>
Pergamon  Press,  1987,  both  of  which  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference.<br>
The  term  "cancer"  refers  to  cancer  diseases  that  can  be  beneficially  treated  by  the<br>
inhibition  of  KSP,  including,  for  example,  lung  and  bronchus;  prostate;  breast;  pancreas;<br>
colon  and  rectum;  thyroid;  stomach;  liver  and  intrahepatic  bile  duct;  kidney  and  renal<br><br>
pelvis;  urinary  bladder;  uterine  corpus;  uterine  cervix;  ovary;  multiple  myeloma;<br>

The  compounds  of  the  invention  are  useful  in  vitro  or  in  vivo  in  inhibiting  the<br>
growth  of  cancer  cells.  The  compounds  may  be  used  aloni  or  in  compositions  together<br>
with  a  pharmaceutically  acceptable  carrier  or  excipient.  Suitable  pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable  carriers  or  excipients  include,  for  example,  processing  agents  and  drug<br>
delivery  modifiers  and  enhancers,  such  as,  for  example,  calcium  phosphate,  magnesium<br>
stearate,  talc,  monosaccharides,  disaccharides,  starch,  gelatin,  cellulose,  methyl  cellulose,<br>
sodium  carboxymethyl  cellulose,  dextrose,  hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone,  low  melting  waxes,  ion  exchange  resins,  and  the  like,  as  well  as<br>
combinations  of  any  two  or  more  thereof.  Other  suitable  pharmaceutically  acceptable<br>
excipients  are  described  in  "Remington's  Pharmaceutical  Sciences,"  Mack  Pub.  Co.,<br>
New  Jersey,  1991,  incorporated  herein  by  reference.<br>
Effective  amounts  of  the  compounds  of  the  invention  generally  include  any<br>
amount  sufficient  to  detectably  inhibit  KSP  activity  by  any  of  the  assays  described  herein,<br>
by  other  KSP  activity  assays  known  to  those  having  ordinary  skill  in  the  art,  or  by<br>
detecting  an  inhibition  or  alleviation  of  symptoms  of  cancer.<br>
The  amount  of  active  ingredient  that  may  be  combined  with  the  carrier  materials<br>
to  produce  a  single  dosage  form  will  vary  depending  upon  the  host  treated  and  the<br>
particular  mode  of  adrmnistration.  It  will  be  understood,  however,  that  the  specific  dose<br>
level  for  any  particular  patient  will  depend  upon  a  variety  of  [factors  including  the  activity<br>
of  the  specific  compound  employed,  the  age,  body  weight,  general  health,  sex,  diet,  time<br>
of  administration,  route  of  administration,  rate  of  excretion,  drug  combination,  and  the<br>
severity  of  the  particular  disease  undergoing  therapy.  The  therapeutically  effective<br>
amount  for  a  given  situation  can  be  readily  determined  by  routine  experimentation  and  is<br>
within  the  skill  and  judgment  of  the  ordinary  clinician.<br>
For  purposes  of  the  present  invention,  a  therapeutically  effective  dose  will<br>
generally  be  a  total  daily  dose  administered  to  a  host  in  singly  or  divided  doses  may  be  in<br>
amounts,  for  example,  of  from  0.001  to  1OOOmg/kg  body  weight  daily  and  more<br>
preferred  from  1.0  to  30mg/kg  body  weight  daily.  Dosage  unit  compositions  may<br>
contain  such  amounts  of  submultiples  thereof  to  make  up  the  daily  dose.<br><br>
The  compounds  of  the  present  invention  may  be  administered  orally,  parenterally,<br>
sublingually,  by  aerosolization  or  inhalation  spray,  rectally,  or  topically  in  dosage  unit<br>
formulations  containing  conventional  nontoxic  pharmaceutically  acceptable  carriers,<br>
adjuvants,  and  vehicles  as  desired.  Topical  administration  may  also  involve  the  use  of<br>
transdermal  administration  such  as  transdermal  patches  or  ionophoresis  devices.  The<br>
term  parenteral  as  used  herein  includes  subcutaneous  injections,  intravenous,<br>
intramuscular,  intrasternal  injection,  or  infusion  techniques.<br>
Injectable  preparations,  for  example,  sterile  injectable  aqueous  or  oleaginous<br>
suspensions  may  be  formulated  according  to  the  known  art  using  suitable  dispersing  or<br>
wetting  agents  and  suspending  agents.  The  sterile  injectable  preparation  may  also  be  a<br>
sterile  injectable  solution  or  suspension  in  a  nontoxic  parenterally  acceptable  diluent  or<br>
solvent,  for  example,  as  a  solution  in  1,3-propanediol.  Among  the  acceptable  vehicles<br>
and  solvents  that  may  be  employed  are  water,  Ringer's  solution,  and  isotonic  sodium<br>
chloride  solution.  In  addition,  sterile,  fixed  oils  are  conventionally  employed  as  a  solvent<br>
or  suspending  medium.  For  this  purpose  any  bland  fixed  oil  may  be  employed  including<br>
synthetic  mono-  or  di-glycerides.  In  addition,  fatty  acids  such  as  oleic  acid  find  use  in  the<br>
preparation  of  injectables.<br>
Suppositories  for  rectal  administration  of  the  drug  cap  be  prepared  by  mixing  the<br>
drug  with  a  suitable  nonirritating  excipient  such  as  cocoa  butter  and  polyethylene  glycols,<br>
which  are  solid  at  ordinary  temperatures  but  liquid  at  the  rectal  temperature  and  will<br>
therefore  melt  in  the  rectum  and  release  the  drug.<br>
Solid  dosage  forms  for  oral  administration  may  include  capsules,  tablets,  pills,<br>
powders,  and  granules.  In  such  solid  dosage  forms,  the  active  compound  may  be<br>
admixed  with  at  least  one  inert  diluent  such  as  sucrose  lactose  or  starch.  Such  dosage<br>
forms  may  also  comprise,  as  is  normal  practice,  additional  substances  other  than  inert<br>
diluents,  e.g.,  lubricating  agents  such  as  magnesium  stearate.  In  the  case  of  capsules,<br>
tablets,  and  pills,  the  dosage  forms  may  also  comprise  buffering  agents.  Tablets  and  pills<br>
can  additionally  be  prepared  with  enteric  coatings.<br>
Liquid  dosage  forms  for  oral  administration  may  include  pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable  emulsions,  solutions,  suspensions,  syrups,  and  elixirs  containing  inert  diluents<br>
commonly  used  in  the  art,  such  as  water.  Such  compositions  may  also  comprise<br>
adjuvants,  such  as  wetting  agents,  emulsifying  and  suspending  agents,  cyclodextrins,  and<br>
sweetening,  flavoring,  and  perfuming  agents.<br><br>
The  compounds  of  the  present  invention  can  also  be  administered  in  the  form  of<br>
liposomes.  As  is  known  in  the  art,  liposomes  are  generally  derived  from  phospholipids  or<br>
other  lipid  substances.  Liposomes  are  formed  by  mono-  or  multi-lamellar  hydrated  liquid<br>
crystals  that  are  dispersed  in  an  aqueous  medium.  AnV  non-toxic,  physiologically<br>
acceptable  and  metabolizable  lipid  capable  of  forming  liposomes  can  be  used.  The<br>
present  compositions  in  liposome  form  can  contain,  in  addition  to  a  compound  of  the<br>
present  invention,  stabilizers,  preservatives,  excipients,  and  the  like.  The  preferred  lipids<br>
are  the  phospholipids  and  phosphatidyl  cholines  (lecithins),  both  natural  and  synthetic.<br>
  Methods  to  form  liposomes  are  known  in  the  art.  See,  for  example,  Prescott  (ed.),<br>
"Methods  in  Cell  Biology,"  Volume  XIV,  Academic  Press,  New  York,  1976,  p.  33  et  seq.<br>
While  the  compounds  of  the  invention  can  be  administered  as  the  sole  active<br>
pharmaceutical  agent,  they  can  also  be  used  in  combination  with  one  or  more  other  agents<br>
used  in  the  treatment  of  cancer.  Representative  agents  useful  in  combination  with  the<br>
compounds  of  the  invention  for  the  treatment  of  cancer  include,  for  example,  irinotecan,<br>
topotecan,  gemcitabine,  gleevec,  herceptin,  5-fluorouracil,  leucovorin,  carboplatin,<br>
cisplatin,  taxanes,  tezacitabine,  cyclophosphamide,  Vinca  alkaloids,  imatinib,<br>
anthracyclines,  rituximab,  trastuzumab,  topoisomerase  I  inhibitors,  as  well  as  other  cancer<br>
chemotherapeutic  agents.<br>
The  above  compounds  to  be  employed  in  combination  with  the  compounds  of  the<br>
invention  will  be  used  in  therapeutic  amounts  as  indicated  in  the  Physicians'  Desk<br>
Reference  (PDR)  47th  Edition  (1993),  which  is  incorporated  herein  by  reference,  or  such<br>
therapeutically  useful  amounts  as  would  be  known  to  one  of  Ordinary  skill  in  the  art<br>
The  compounds  of  the  invention  and  the  other  anticancer  agents  can  be<br>
adrninistered  at  the  recommended  maximum  clinical  dosage  or  at  lower  doses.  Dosage<br>
levels  of  the  active  compounds  in  the  compositions  of  the  invention  may  be  varied  so  as<br>
to  obtain  a  desired  therapeutic  response  depending  on  the  route  of  administration,  severity<br>
of  the  disease  and  the  response  of  the  patient.  The  combination  can  be  administered  as<br>
separate  compositions  or  as  a  single  dosage  form  containing  both  agents.  When<br>
administered  as  a  combination,  the  therapeutic  agents  can  be  formulated  as  separate<br>
compositions,  which  are  given  at  the  same  time  or  different  times,  or  the  therapeutic<br>
agents,  can  be  given  as  a  single  composition.<br>
Antiestrogens,  such  as  tamoxifen,  inhibit  breast  cancer  growth  through  induction<br>
of  cell  cycle  arrest,  that  requires  the  action  of  the  cell  cycle  inhibitor  p27Kip.  Recently,  it<br><br>
has  been  shown  that  activation  of  the  Ras-Raf-MAP  Kinase  pathway  alters  the<br>
phosphorylation  status  of  p27Kip  such  that  its  inhibitory  activity  in  arresting  the  cell<br>
cycle  is  attenuated,  thereby  contributing  to  antiestrogen  resistance  (Donovan,  et  al,<br>
J.  Biol.  Chem.  276:40888,  2001).  As  reported  by  Donovan  et  al.,  inhibition  of  MAPK<br>
signaling  through  treatment  with  MEK  inhibitor  changed  the  phosphorylation  status  of<br>
p27  in  hormone  refactory  breast  cancer  cell  lines  and  in  so  doing  restored  hormone<br>
sensitivity.  Accordingly,  in  one  aspect,  the  compounds  of  formula  (T),  (II),  or  (III)  may<br>
be  used  in  the  treatment  of  hormone  dependent  cancers,  such  as  breast  and  prostate<br>
cancers,  to  reverse  hormone  resistance  commonly  seen  in  these  cancers  with  conventional<br>
anticancer  agents.<br>
In  hematological  cancers,  such  as  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML),<br>
chromosomal  translocation  is  responsible  for  the  constatively  activated  BCR-AB1<br>
tyrosine  kinase.  The  afflicted  patients  are  responsive  to  gleevec,  a  small  molecule<br>
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  as  a  result  of  inhibition  of  Abl  kinase  activity.  However,  many<br>
patients  with  advanced  stage  disease  respond  to  gleevec  initially,  but  then  relapse  later<br>
due  to  resistance-conferring  mutations  in  the  Abl  kinase  domain.  In  vitro  studies  have<br>
demonstrated  that  BCR-Avl  employs  the  Raf  kinase  pathway  to  elicit  its  effects.  In<br>
addition,  inhibiting  more  than  one  kinase  in  the  same  pathway  provides  additional<br>
protection  against  resistance-conferring  mutations.  Accordingly,  in  another  aspect  of  the<br>
invention,  the  compounds  of  formula  (I),  (H),  or  (HI)  are  used  in  combination  with  at<br>
least  one  additional  agent,  such  as  gleevec,  in  the  treatment  of  hematological  cancers,<br>
such  as  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML),  to  reverse  or  prevent  resistance  to  the  at<br>
least  one  additional  agent.<br>
In  another  aspect  of  the  invention,  kits  that  include  one  or  more  compounds  of  the<br>
invention  are  provided.  Representative  kits  include  a  compound  of  formula  (I),  (II),  or<br>
(III)  and  a  package  insert  or  other  labeling  including  directions  for  treating  a  cellular<br>
proliferative  disease  by  administering  an  KSP  inhibitory  amount  of  the  compound.<br>
The  present  invention  will  be  understood  more  readily  by  reference  to  the<br>
following  examples,  which  are  provided  by  way  of  illustration  and  are  not  intended  to  be<br>
limiting  of  the  present  invention.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Referring  to  the  examples  that  follow,  compounds  of  the  present  invention  were<br>
synthesized  using  the  methods  described  herein,  or  other  methods,  which  are  well  known<br>
in  the  art.  The  compounds  were  characterized  by  high  performance  liquid<br>
chromatography  (HPLC)  using  a  Waters  Millenium  chromatography  system  with  a<br>
2690  Separation  Module  (Milford,  Massachusetts).  The  analytical  columns  were  Alltima<br>
C-18  reversed  phase,  4.6  x  250  mm  from  Alltech  (Deerfield,  Illinois).  A  gradient  elution<br>
was  used,  typically  starting  with  5%  acetonitrile/95%  water]  and  progressing  to  100%<br>
acetonitrile  over  a  period  of  40  minutes.  All  solvents  contained  0.1%  trifluoroacetic  acid<br>
(TFA).  Compounds  were  detected  by  ultraviolet  light  (UV)  absorption  at  either  220  or<br>
254  nm.  HPLC  solvents  were  from  Burdick  and  Jackson  (Muskegan,  Michigan),  or<br>
Fisher  Scientific  (Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania).  In  some  instances,  purity  was  assessed  by<br>
thin  layer  chromatography  (TLC)  using  glass  or  plastic  backed  silica  gel  plates,  such  as,<br>
for  example,  Baker-Flex  Silica  Gel  1B2-F  flexible  sheets.  TLC  results  were  readily<br>
detected  visually  under  ultraviolet  light,  or  by  employing  well  known  iodine  vapor  and<br>
other  various  staining  techniques.<br>
Mass  spectrometric  analysis  was  performed  on  one  of  twO  LCMS  instruments:  a<br>
Waters  System  (Alliance  HT  HPLC  and  a  Micromass  ZQ  mass  spectrometer;  Column:<br>

No.  HP  190915-443,  dimensions:  30.0  m  x  25  m  x  0.25  m).<br>
Nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  analysis  was  performed  with  a  Varian  300<br>
Mhz  NMR  (Palo  Alto,  California).  The  spectral  reference  was  either  TMS  or  the  known<br><br>
chemical  shift  of  the  solvent.  Some  compound  samples  were  run  at  elevated  temperatures<br>
(e.g.,  75°C)  to  promote  increased  sample  solubility.<br>
The  purity  of  some  of  the  invention  compounds  was  assessed  by  elemental<br>
analysis  (Desert  Analytics,  Tucson,  Arizona)<br>
Melting  points  were  determined  on  a  Laboratory  Devices  Mel-Temp  apparatus<br>
(Holliston,  Massachusetts).<br>
Preparative  separations  were  carried  out  using  a  Plash  40  chromatography  system<br>
and  KP-Sil,  60A  (Biotage,  Charlottesville,  Virginia),  or  by  flash  column  chromatography<br>
using  silica  gel  (230-400  mesh)  packing  material,  or  by  HPLC  using  a  C-18  reversed<br>
phase  column.  Typical  solvents  employed  for  the  Flash  40  Biotage  system  and  flash<br>
column  chromatography  were  dichloromethane,  methanol,  ethyl  acetate,  hexane,  acetone,<br>
aqueous  hydroxyamine  and  triethyl  amine.  Typical  solvents  employed  for  the  reverse<br>
phase  HPLC  were  varying  concentrations  of  acetonitrile  and  water  with<br>
