				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process and a device for the pyrolysis and gasification of waste materials, in particular for special and/or hazardous waste materials.<br>
The problem of the disposal of waste materials, and in particular the problem of disposing of waste classified as special and/or dangerous solid, liquid and/or muddy waste, has been known for a long time, and it has acquired an ever-increasing importance due to the ever-increasing quantity of waste produced both  industrially  and  not,  and  due  to  the increasingly binding conditions imposed by the law for the disposal of the same.<br>
The prior art has attempted to solve said problem through the use of different types' of plants which make  use  of pyrolysis,  or  gasification,  or  in general,  of  combustion  processes,  at  determined temperature conditions,  then followed by suitable treatment methods for the produced gases. The term "gasification"  means  a  process  of  partial  non-catalytic oxidation of a solid,  liquid or gaseous substance, whose final object is that of producing a gaseous  fuel  mainly  consisting  of  CO,  H2,  and<br>
secondarily of light hydrocarbons, such as methane. Water and carbon dioxide are used as oxidising agents.<br>
On the other hand,  the expression "pyrolysis and gasification" refers to a process which breaks up the molecules   of   organic   substances,   thermally decomposing them without requiring oxidising agents. ETP-B1-0 292 987 describes a process and a device for transforming polluting fuels or waste materials into clean  energy  and  usable  products.  The  process provides for a treatment of the waste material at a temperature of at least 1600 째C, in absence of air, so as to obtain a combustible gas based on H? and CO, non-combustible  and  inert  gases,  then  a  sudden cooling so as to separate inert gases with water, generating  vapour  and bringing  the  gases  to  a temperature not lower than 1200 째C, followed by a passage of the vapour and of the gases through a depurative coal mass, and finally, it provides for the cooling of the gases coming from the depurative coal mass.<br>
Nevertheless, the process and the device described in EP'987 do not allow attaining the desired result, that is to say, the complete transformation of solid, liquid and gaseous waste into clean energy and usable products.  In fact,  the products obtained with the<br>
process and the device according to EP'987 contain a high quantity of unburnt products and of air, and there  is  a  high  proportion  of  coal  residual. Moreover,  the  service  life  of  the  reactor  is extremely limited, as it does not even reach two years time  (which is the minimum lifetime for an apparatus  of  this  type)  due  to  the  continuous scouring 'of the  refractory material  forming the interior of the combustion chamber. Moreover,  the depurative coal mass can be very easily obstructed by unburnt residuals and by the coal fraction, and this causes the block of the entire process and device. The  present  invention  intends  to  overcome  the disadvantages present in the prior art. In particular, object of the present invention is a process for the  pyrolysis and gasification of waste materials, in particular of special and/or hazardous waste  materials,  comprising  a  gasification  and melting step, a step of treatment of the mixture of the  obtained  gases,  and  a  vitrification  step, characterised in that the above steps provide for the following passages:<br>
a) the material to be treated, at a temperature comprised between 1300 and 1500 째C, is gasified for a lapse of time comprised between 3 and 15 seconds, and melt for a time comprised between 5 and 30 minutes,<br>
in total absence of air, obtaining a mixture of combustible gases, non-combustible gases and inert gases, through at least two gasification steps carried out in a sequence, wherein the temperature is maintained constant through the use of at least one thermal lance in any one of the gasification steps;<br>
b)	the mixture of combustible and non-combustible<br>
gases thus obtained is subjected to purification and<br>
energy-recovery treatments;<br>
c)	the  inert  gases,  or  inorganic  and  mineral<br>
proportion, are extracted in vitrified state.<br>
In particular,  the treatment step b)  of the gas mixture  coming  from  step  a)  can  provide,  in alternative, for the following passages: b1) the totality of the gas mixture is sent to an afterburning chamber for the heat recovery and the production of thermal energy, in the vapour state, which  is  then  recovered  and  transformed  into electrical energy;<br>
b2) part of the gas mixture is purified through cooling, filtering, neutralisation, adsorption of CO2 and compression, and the gas mixture thus treated is fed to the thermal lances so as to maintain the predetermined temperature into the gasification chambers, in alternative and/or in parallel to the traditional fuel, whereas the remaining portion of<br>
gas is sent to the treatment provided at item bl); b3) the totality of the gas mixture is subjected to step b2), and portion of the gas mixture thus treated is fed to the thermal lances so as to maintain the predetermined temperature into the gasification chambers, whereas the remaining portion (more than 50%) is sent to an electrical energy recovery treatment.<br>
The mixture of the gases coming from the gasification reaction consists of CO, CO2, H2 and H2O, and it can be used differently according to the size of the plant and to the predetermined energetic objects. The gas mixture which may still be present at the end of step bl) is sent to a removal and neutralisation system so that the emission into the atmosphere occurs in compliance with precise law provisions. Moreover, further object of the present invention is a device for carrying out the process according to the present invention,  characterised in that it comprises one or more stocking systems, for the waste to be treated in connection - through a transport and feeding  system  -with  a  reactor,  said  reactor consisting of  at  least  one  primary  gasification chamber,  connected  to  a  secondary  and  melting gasification chamber, each gasification chamber being provided  with  at  least  one  thermal  lance,  said<br>
secondary and melting gasification chamber being provided, at one end, with a system for sending the gases to successive steps, and at the opposed end, with a system for discharging the melt material to a vitrification system.<br>
In particular, the thermal condition in the primary and secondary and melting gasification chambers is reached- through the use of suitable thermal lances fed with traditional fuels, such as methane, propane, etc., and/or with the mixture of H2 and CO coming from the process according to the present invention. The operating temperature in the chambers must be maintained at the value of 1300-1500 째C, since this allows attaining the gasification of the organic proportion of the material to be treated at the maximum speed possible,  and  the melting of  the inorganic mineral proportion,  so as to carry out, afterwards, its extraction in vitrified state. In  fact,  the  extraction  in  vitrified  state  is essential for the objects of the present invention since  metal  and  inorganic   residuals  exhibit stability, insolubility and inertia to the ambient, thanks  to  the  vitreous  state  and  to  its  high inertness degree.<br>
Moreover, the use of said temperatures also allows solving the problem of the scouring of the refractory<br>
materials inside the reactor.<br>
The systems for stocking the waste to be treated<br>
generally consist of silos sized according to the<br>
hourly flow rate of the plant so as to guarantee the<br>
maintenance of the necessary autonomy.<br>
The stocking containers are made completely airproof<br>
or they are maintained at a pressure equal to or<br>
lower than the operating pressure of the gasification<br>
chamber.<br>
In fact, independently of the physical nature of the<br>
waste  (liquid,  solid,  muddy),  said condition  is<br>
necessary for preventing the introduction of air into<br>
the primary gasification chamber.<br>
In particular,  liquid waste is  fed by means of<br>
special atomisation lances by mean-head pumps, with<br>
flow-rate control.<br>
Muddy waste can be  fed under  flow-rate  control<br>
through screws or suitable pumps, such as for example<br>
single-screw pumps, pistons, etc.,.<br>
Solid waste must be pre-treated before being charged<br>
into the feeding silo. In fact, its expected size is<br>
about 2-3 cm. In any case, the preventive treatment<br>
depends on the nature of the solid waste, and on its<br>
content.<br>
The  waste  is  fed  into  the  primary  gasification<br>
chamber through simple or combined transport systems.<br>
The material to be treated is extracted from the silo and  transported,  always by systems made  totally airproof,  to a shutoff valve arranged vertically above the inlet area of the primary gasification chamber. Then, the waste is fed, always under flow-rate control, by means of a motorised stellar valve (or other equivalent devices), without compressions<br>
which may increase its density, so that in the point<br>
of inlet to the primary gasification chamber, it is<br>
as fluid as possible.<br>
As previously indicated, the reactor is divided into<br>
two sections:<br>
-	one (or more) primary gasification chamber(s);<br>
-	a secondary and melting gasification chamber.<br>
The primary gasification chamber consists of a vertical cylinder provided with an aperture, or mouth, for charging the waste, at the centre of the cover of said cylinder. Always in the high portion of the cylinder, but with tangential clutch, there is provided the introduction point of the thermal lance. The lower portion of the cylinder is tapered as a truncated cone so as to connect the cylinder to the pipeline which connects it to the secondary and melting gasification chamber. The volume and length of the cylinder and of the union pipeline determine the time of permanence of the waste in contact with<br>
the hot gases generated by the thermal lance, and with the surface of the refractory coating maintained at the expected operating temperature (1300-1500 째C). The cylinder has a volume ranging between 0.4 m3 and 16 m3, and its length ranges between 1.5 m and 6 m, whereas the connection system, or union pipeline, has a volume ranging from 0.06 m3 to 9 m3, and a length ranging from 1.5 m to 5 m.<br>
The gas flow generated in the primary gasification chamber forms a descending flow which tangentially enters into the secondary and melting gasification chamber, together with the portion of fed waste yet to be gasified or melt.<br>
Also the secondary and melting gasification chamber consists of a vertical cylinder arranged at a lower level with respect to the first chamber. The lower portion of said cylinder constitutes the bottom, or melt basin,  of the waste mineral residuals.  The refractory coating of said bottom is laid so as to obtain an inclination or slope comprised between 5 and 30%, preferably of 20%, between the highest point (inlet area of the gases from the previous chamber) and the lowest point, diametrically opposed (outlet area of melt ashes) . Moreover, the bottom exhibits a length ranging between 1.5 and 3 metres. The length and the inclination of this path determine<br>
the time of permanence and, accordingly, the melting of the gasification residuals. On the wall of the cylinder of the secondary and melting gasification chamber, always in the proximity of the bottom, there is provided the second thermal lance, which has the task of maintaining the operating temperature at the predetermined condition (1300-1500 째G). Such lance is arranged -as tangential inlet. In this way, besides accomplishing  the  melting,  the  gasification  is completed,  and since it occurs in two sequential steps, it is characterised by very high efficiency levels.<br>
The upper portion of the cylinder forming the secondary and melting gasification chamber ends as a truncated cone connected to the pipeline which conveys the gases to the following treatments. The descending flow arriving from the primary chamber changes into ascending flow into the secondary chamber, in a high turbulence condition generated by the tangential inlets.<br>
Thus, the gas mixture coming from the first gasification chamber consists of a descending flow that changes into ascending flow in the second gasification step, in a high turbulence condition generated by the tangential inlets. The discharge of melt material occurs through a<br>
special aperture arranged in the peripheral portion of  the  bottom  of  the  secondary  and  melting gasification chamber.  The melt material  directly arrives into an underlying basin, maintained at a constant water level. In this way, a hydraulic seal is also created, which prevents the air from entering into the secondary and melting gasification chamber. The vitrified material is continuously removed from the basin through a special bucket elevator. In particular, the device according to the present invention can be provided with two or more primary gasification chambers which converge to a single secondary and melting gasification chamber. In fact, in the case of a plant where it is necessary to maximise the flow rate of a single waste, or where there is the need of feeding at the same time waste of different nature, the realisation of two (or even three)  primary  chambers  converging,  with  equal geometry,  to  the  same  secondary  chamber  is  an extremely useful solution.<br>
In this way, there must be provided a double charging system to the two primary chambers with the possibility of proportioning on the basis of the waste quality or of the disposal requirements. In the secondary chamber, on the basis of the diameter of the same, it can be necessary to install<br>
more than one thermal lance so as to better distribute the heat generated by the same lances. In fact, a single lance with high power could subject the refractory coating to too high thermal stresses (temperature peaks) which would significantly reduce its lifetime.<br>
Thermal lances are usually fed with traditional fuel and/or with the H2 and CO mixture generated by the plant. They are controlled by a totally automatic system which allows passing from 0% to 100% of both types of fuel.  The quantity of oxygen,  as single comburent, is stoichiometrically controlled on the basis of the quantity of fuel and of its calorific value (in the case of mixture) . Each installed lance is provided with a control and regulation system. It allows using the traditional fuel in the steps of start-up  and  of  attainment  of  the  operating temperature, whereas from the moment in which the waste is introduced and consequently, the production of the gas mixture starts, it becomes possible to gradually (0-100%) feed the gas mixture to the lance, decreasing at the same the traditional fuel according to an still gradual manner (100-0%). The self-support of the process is thus attained.<br>
As previously indicated, the gas mixture exiting from the  secondary  and  melting  gasification  chamber<br>
undergoes different treatments on the basis of the<br>
type of use for which it is intended.<br>
The process according to the present invention allows<br>
realising a process of total disposal of the material<br>
to be treated with the maximum efficiency and in<br>
total safety.<br>
A further advantage consists in the possibility of<br>
self-support of the thermal lances, which makes the<br>
process and the apparatus according to the present<br>
invention particularly advantageous.<br>
Further  features  and advantages  of  the  present<br>
invention will appear more clearly evident from the<br>
following description. This is an exemplifying and<br>

Said secondary and melting gasification chamber 13<br>
consists of a cylinder 20, provided with an aperture<br>
21 into the lower bottom 22. The lower bottom 22 is<br>
provided with an inclination that can range between 5<br>
and 30%,- and a length ranging between 1.5 and 3 m, in<br>
