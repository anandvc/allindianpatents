				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR HEATING METERED DOSE INHALERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to the field of medicament<br>
inhalation devices, specifically metered dose inhalers, and to heat stress<br>
testing of such inhalation devices to detect and reject nonconforming inhalers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the art of manufacturing medicament aerosol inhalation devices,<br>
recent attention has been aimed at detecting and rejecting potential and actual<br>
nonconforming devices. For example, a small percentage of aerosol inhalation<br>
devices leak or will leak due to manufacturing defects, such as broken or torn<br>
gaskets, loss of proper sealing, defective valve, swollen gasket(s), etc. Such<br>
defects cause a loss of aerosol propellant, which adversely affects or<br>
otherwise alters the performance of the inhalation device.<br>
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has become very<br>
concerned with leaking (or otherwise nonconforming or defective) aerosol<br>
inhalation devices, particularly MDI's. The performance of an MDI can be<br>
significantly altered when the propellant leaks, particularly where the propellant<br>
leaks in significantly amounts or at a significant rate. For example, a "gross<br>
leaker" may not deliver the medicament at all to the patient, MDI's that leak at<br>
more than an insignificant rate may under deliver the medicament. In other<br>
words, the medicament delivery from a leaking MDI does not conform to the<br>
dosing regimen set forth and approved by the FDA. In that case, the patient<br>
may not even realize that the insufficient medicament is being delivered to the<br>
lungs.<br>
As a result, the FDA has begun requiring manufacturers to stress test<br>
aerosol inhalation devices and subsequently weigh the stressed devices to<br>
detect actual and potential nonconforming devices. Leaking MDI's will weigh<br>
less than what they are supposed to weigh- Stressed MDI's that lose a<br>
predetermined amount of propellant are rejected as nonconforming. The FDA<br><br>
has set conforming standards. The FDA has also set a temperature standard<br>
of 55°C ±5C° for heat stress testing the MDI's.<br>
Many methods and apparatus are available for heating MDI's. The<br>
present invention involves using electromagnetic induction heating to heat the<br>
electro-conductive materials present in the MDI, such as primarily the<br>
aluminum canister, Electromagnetic induction is a method of generating heat<br>
within a metal part. Any electrical conductor can be heated by electromagnetic<br>
induction. As alternating current from the generator flows through the inductor,<br>
or work coil, a highly concentrated, rapidly alternating magnetic field is<br>
established within the coil. The magnetic field thus induces an electric<br>
potential in the part to be heated. The part represents a closed circuit. The<br>
induced voltage causes current to flow within the part. Eddy currents are<br>
typically established. The resistance of the part to the flow of the induced<br>
current causes heating.<br>
The pattern of heating obtained by induction is determined by a number<br>
of factors: the shape of the induction coil producing the magnetic field, the<br>
number of turns in the coil, the operating frequency, the alternating current<br>
power input, and the nature of the work pieces. The rate of heating obtained<br>
by the coils depends on the strength of the magnetic field to which the part is<br>
exposed. In the work piece, this becomes a function of the induced currents<br>
and the resistance to electrical flow.<br>
The depth of current penetration depends upon work piece permeability,<br>
resistivity, and the alternating current frequency. Since the first two factors<br>
vary comparatively little, the greatest variable is frequency. Depth of current<br>
penetration decreases as frequency increases. High frequency current is<br>
generally used when shallow heating is desired. Intermediate and low<br>
frequencies are used in applications requiring deeper heating.<br>
The induction coil and associated components and the processes<br>
thereof of the present invention are advantageous. The present invention<br>
advantageously heats and stress tests MDI's in a relatively short period of time<br>
(i.e., dwell time), which permits in-line processing at high throughput. The<br>
present invention also advantageously employs a few relatively simple<br>
processing and material handling equipment resulting in low investment,<br><br>
 reduced maintenance, high efficiency, and reliability.<br>
The present invention relates to the heat exchangers straddling the first<br>
and last MDIs so that they are positioned proximate to the first and last MDIs<br>
during the heating cycle.<br>
The present invention is further advantageous in that only the<br>
electroconductive portions of the MDI are heated significantly reducing the<br>
heating of plastic components (e.g. gaskets and valve components) that are<br>
susceptible to being unnecessarily damaged by heat.<br>
Still further, the present invention advantageously heat stress tests<br>
10 the MDI's without exposing the MDl's to steam or moisture (except any<br>
negligible moisture associated with the sealed heat exchangers) which can<br>
ingress into the MDI reducing product performance.<br>
US 3,229,513 discloses methods for detecting surface defects on solid articles by<br>
using a halogen containing liquid on the surface of the article, wherein an induction coil is<br>
employed to vaporize liquid from the surface of the article. However, US 3,229,513 does<br>
not teach employing first and second heat exchangers in conjunction with metered dose<br>
inhalers.<br>
Further, US 4,220,839 relates to an induction heating coil for the crucible free<br>
melting of crystalline material. In particular, the coil heats a polycrystalline feed stock rod to<br>
a single crystal rod (Fig.2). However, it does not teach employing first and second heat<br>
exchangers in conjunction with metered dose inhalers.<br>
Also, US 4,878,379 relates to rheometers containing shearing elements for<br>
subjecting an intervening sample of material to shear forces and more specifically rotational<br>
rheometers. However, it does not teach employing first and second heat exchangers in<br>
conjunction with metered dose inhalers.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for heating medicinal<br>
inhalation devices. The apparatus includes an electrical power supply and one<br>
or more induction coils. Preferably, the apparatus further includes a<br>
microprocessor for controlling the power supply in the range of 100-130 amps,<br>
preferably 110-115 amps, and more preferably about 113 amps, to heat the<br>
inhalation devices to a temperature in the range of 50-60°C, preferably around<br>
55°C. By "about" or the like language as used herein, it is meant to include<br>
those values surrounding the recited value or range of values that achieve<br>
substantially the same desired ultimate result. The apparatus also preferably<br>
further includes a cooling system including a condenser and a pump, wherein<br>
a liquid coolant is pumped through the induction coil.<br>
Preferably, the power supply provides up to 20 kilowatts (kW) at a<br>
frequency in the range of 240-440 kHz. A vojtage of 140 volts may be applied<br>
to the induction coils. The electrical power supply may be operated in the<br>
range of 80-90% efficiency, preferably about 85%. The induction coil may be<br>
constructed from copper tubing and silver soldered joints.<br>
Preferably, the induction coil is a single, continuous coil in the shape of<br>
a loop having first and second bridges, one at each end of the loop, respectively. The<br>
bridges are suitably sized and configured to directly heat each entire inhalation<br>
device. In other words, the bridges of the induction coil may be 4 inches in<br>
height for heating metered dose inhalers ("MDI's") that are 2-3 inches in<br>
height. Examples of MDI's that may be stress tested by this invention include<br><br>
 those disclosed in USPN's 8,170,717; 6,131.566; 6,5 43,2//; and 6,149,892,<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus including the electrical<br>
powers supply and induction coil(s) described herein above, a conveyor, and a<br>
gating assembly for indexing a predetermined number of medicinal inhalation<br>
devices along the conveyor between the bridges of the Induction coil.<br>
Preferably, the gating assembly further includes first and second heat exchangers suitably<br>
adapted and positioned to heat the first and last metered dose inhaler cycled<br>
and indexed within the induction coil. The heat exchanger may include an<br>
aluminum canister (similar to the canister used in the MDI's) adapted to be<br>
cooled by circulating cooling water.<br>
Preferably, the gating assembly is adapted and controlled to index 32<br>
metered dose inhalers per heating cycle. The MDI's are indexed one sfug at a<br>
time where each slug may include 8 MDI's. Each heating cycle may include 4<br>
slugs of 8 metered dose inhalers per slug. The heating cycle time may be in<br>
the range of 30-40 seconds. As such, the conveyor may have a line speed in<br>
the range of 100-140 metered dose inhalers per minute. An infrared<br>
thermometer may also be employed to measure the temperature of the<br>
metered dose inhalers. Preferably, the measured temperatures are fed to the<br>
microprocessor, whereby the microprocessor adjusts the power supply to heat<br>
the metered dose inhalers to the desired temperature, for example 55°C ±<br>
5C°. A check weighing device is also preferably employed to check the weight<br>
of the heated metered dose inhalers. Any nonconforming and/or leaking (e.g.,<br>
gross leakers) MDI's are detected and summarily rejected/discarded.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a process or method of heat stress<br>
testing medicinal inhalation devices to detect and reject nonconforming or<br>
leaking devices. In general, the process includes providing one or more<br>
inhalation devices, and induction heating the one or more inhalation devices.<br>
Preferably, the inhalation devices are metered dose inhalers, whereby the<br>
metered dose inhalers are provided continuously (e.g., continuous runs) at a<br>
line speed in the range of 100-140 inhalers per minute.<br>
Preferably, the process also includes indexing the continuously<br>
provided metered dose inhalers. The metered dose inhalers may be indexed<br><br>
in slugs of 8 providing 32 metered dose inhalers per induction heating cycle.<br>
During the heating cycle, the metered dose inhalers are preferably heated to a<br>
temperature in the range of about 50-60°C, preferably about 55ºC. The<br>
temperature of the metered dose inhalers, the indexing, the induction heating,<br>
and other steps in the process may be computer process controlled by a<br>
microprocessor and other suitable electronic (e.g., sensors) and<br>
electromechanical equipment and instruments (e.g., pneumatic actuators).<br>
The process preferably also includes the steps of check weighing the<br>
heated metered dose inhalers, and rejecting any nonconforming or leaking<br>
metered dose inhalers.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a top view ot one aspect of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a side view of a portion of the gating assembly and heat<br>
exchanger of the present invention. •<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Shown in Fig. 1 is a top view of various aspects of the invention. A<br>
plurality of medicament inhalation aerosol devices 10, such as MDI's, are<br>
conveyed along a conveyor 12. The MDI's 10 are loaded onto the conveyor<br>
12 from a tray unloading station 14. From there, the MDI's 10 pass along the<br>
conveyor 12 past a backup cue sensor 16 to between rails 18. A can count<br>
sensor 20 keeps track of the number of MDI's 10 passing that point on the<br>
conveyor 12.<br>
A computer-controlled gating assembly 22a,22b,22c indexes a<br>
predetennined number of MDI's 10 (called a slug, e.g., 8 MDI's per slug) into a<br>
zone above a channel portion 24 of an induction coil and between the end<br>
bridge portions 26,28 of the induction coil. Preferably, the induction coil is a<br>
continuous loop, single tube, single turn, channel/radiused type induction coil<br>
fabricated from copper tubing and silver soldered joints, such as those<br>
available from Pillar Industries of Brookfield, Wl. The coil 24,26,28 is water<br>
cooled using a chiller (not shown), and is pressure rated for 100 psi.<br>
Preferably, ihe channel 24 is about 4 feel long and the coil has a 0.75 inch<br>
face width to accommodate various MDI 10 sizes and configurations.<br><br>
One of gating assembly levers 22c accumulates the MDi's 10 prior to<br>
entering the induction zone, and the other gating assembly levers 22a,22b are<br>
preferably pneumatically actuated during the induction heating cycle. "The<br>
MDl's 10 can be alternatively indexed using a feedscrew or starwhee)<br>
assembly. Preferably, 4 slugs of 8 MDl's 10 are indexed into the induction<br>
heating zone per heating cycle, thus having 32 MDl's heated per cycle.<br>
Preferably, the dwell time of the MDl's-10 in the heating induction cycle is<br>
around 9 seconds for 32 MDl's. A single slug of 8 MDl's may be indexed in 5<br>
seconds. The heated MDl's 10 may be removed from the induction zone in<br>
around 3 seconds. Thus, line speeds of around 120 or greater MDl's per<br>
minute are preferably achieved. The gating assembly desirably allows the<br>
conveyor to run at a constant line speed.<br>
The number of MDl's in each heat induction cycle affects the heating<br>
efficiency. In general, coil efficiency is improved by increasing the number of<br>
MDl's. In general, MDl's heat faster in a static mode, so the 'indexing method<br>
is more effective than where the MDl's are moving. A safety enclosure 30<br>
constructed from LEXAN© is also preferably provided.<br>
A controlled electrical power supply 32 having a control panel 34<br>
supplies electrical power to the bus bar 36 which, in turn, supplies power to the<br>
induction coil 24,26,28. Preferably, the power supply 32 is a 20kW, 400kHz<br>
solid state RF generator, such as those available from Pillar Industries, MK-20,<br>
Model 7500. After completion of the heating cycle, the gating assembly<br>
22a,22b releases the MDl's 10 conveying the MDl's 10 along the conveyor 12<br>
to the accumulation table 38. A check weighing device (not shown) may be<br>
employed prior to or after the accumulation table 38 to detect and reject<br>
nonconforming (e.g., marginal sealing, defective valve, poor crimp, cut gasket,<br>
faulty component, etc.) or otherwise leaking (e.g., gross leaker) MDl's 10.<br>
Preferably, the power supply 32 has a built-in timer that can be set<br>
according to the time necessary to heat a predetermined number of MDl's to a<br>
desired temperature or temperature range. For example, it may take 4 second<br>
to induction heat 32 MDl's 10 to 54-60°C.<br>
The weight /nay be checked in-line or offiina. A suitable check-weighing<br>
device is available from Anritsu. An infrared thermometer 38msy bo used to<br><br>
measure the temperature of the MDI's 10 to ensure proper heating. Such<br>
measurements may be fed to the computer controlled power supply 32 to<br>
control heating. An irreversible temperature indicator may also be used by<br>
putting the test strip inside the MD110 and removing it after the heating cycle<br>
to determine the maximum temperature reached in the MDI. The infrared<br>
thermometer (Mode! OS91) and temperature test strips (Model U-08068-22)<br>
are available from Cole-Parmer<br>
Shown in Fig. 2 is a preferred embodiment of the outer canister heat<br>
exchangers 40,42 of the present invention. The heat exchangers 40,42 are<br>
fixedly or removably attached to the non-conductive, placement arm of the<br>
gating assembly 22a,22b. The heat exchangers 40,42 include a sealed,<br>
aluminum canister 44 similar or identical in construction to the aluminum<br>
canister employed in the MDI's 10. The internal geometry of the heat<br>
exchangers is preferably designed for turbulent flow therein. A liquid,<br>
preferably water, is supplied to the heat exchangers 40,42 from a supply feed<br>
line 46 (from a chiller which is not shown) to a non-conductive, flexible line 48<br>
to an internal supply tube 50 fixedly or removably attached to the removable<br>
canister lid 52. The lid 52 is removable to inspect, clean, or repair the interior<br>
of the heat exchanger 40,42. An internal return tube 54 is similarly fixedly or<br>
removably attached to the lid 52. Cooling water is returned to the chiller (not<br>
shown) through a cooling return line 56 that also includes a nonconductive,<br>
flexible line 48'.<br>
In a linear configuration of objects, it is known in the art that induction<br>
heating efficiency is improved where each conductive object is proximate<br>
(preferably touching) to other conductive objects. This phenomenon is known<br>
as an electromagnetic effect inherent in induction heating. Thus, in this case,<br>
the first and last MDI's 10',10" are proximate to only one other MDI 10 whereas<br>
the other MDI's 10 are proximate to two other MDI's. It was determined that<br>
this electromagnetic effect reduced the induction heating efficiency of the first<br>
and iast MDI's 10', 10" such that ihey were 5C° cooler. This would be<br>
problematic since the FDA has required stress testing of all MDI's in the range<br>
of 55°C±5C°.<br><br>
The present invention overcomes this potential problem. The heat<br>
exchangers 40,42 are preferably employed to straddle the first and last MDI's<br>
10', 10" (preferably 32 total MDI's) so that they are positioned proximate<br>
(touching or close) to the first and last MDI's during the heating cycle. During<br>
the induction heating cycle, the first and last MDI's 10'. 10" are heated<br>
sufficiently the same as the other MDI's because each MDI 10'.10* is<br>
proximate to another conductive MDI 10 and a respective canister 44 of each<br>
respective heat exchanger 40,42. The heat exchangers 40,42 are<br>
continuously or intermittently cooled with cooling water to control their<br>
temperature. Cooling is needed so that a more than insignificant amount of<br>
heat is not transferred to the first and last MD110', 10" by conductive and/or<br>
convection. Such non-induction forms of heat transfer may occur without<br>
cooling because the heat exchangers 40,42 are repetitively heated whereas<br>
the MDI's 10, 10',10" should be heated by induction only once.<br><br>

induction coil (24,26,28) is suitably sized and configured to directly heat each<br>
entire inhaler (10). A computer controlled gating assembly (22a, 22b, 22c) is<br>
included and contains first and second heat exchangers (40,42) employed to<br>
straddle a first metered dose inhaler (10') and a second metered dose inhaler<br>
(10") so that they are positioned proximate to these inhalers during the heating<br>
cycle. As a result of the proximate positioning, heating inefficiencies are<br>
reduced.</td>
