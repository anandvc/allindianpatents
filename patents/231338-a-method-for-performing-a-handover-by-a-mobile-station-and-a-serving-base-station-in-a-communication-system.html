				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband mobile communication<br>
system, and more particularly to a method for performing a handover in a<br>
broadband wireless communication system employing an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (hereinafter, referred to as an OFDM) method and an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (hereinafter, referred to as an<br>
OFDMA) method.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In the fourth generation (hereinafter, referred to as a 4G) communication<br>
system, which is the next generation communication system, research has been<br>
actively pursued to provide users with services having various quality of services<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a QoSs) and supporting a transmission speed of about<br>
100 Mbps. The current third generation (hereinafter, referred to as a 3G)<br>
communication system supports a transmission speed of about 384 kbps in an<br>
outdoor channel environment having a relatively unfavorable channel<br>
environment, and supports a transmission speed of 2 Mbps at maximum even in<br>
an indoor channel environment having a relatively favorable channel environment.<br>
Meanwhile, wireless local area network (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
LAN) system, and a wireless metropolitan area network (hereinafter, referred to<br>
as a MAN) systems generally support transmission speeds of 20 to 50 Mbps.<br>
Accordingly, in the current 4G communication system, research has been actively<br>
pursued to develop a communication system to ensure mobility and QoS in the<br>
wireless LAN system and the wireless MAN system supporting relatively high<br>
transmission speeds, and to support a high speed service which will be provided<br>
by the 4G communication system.<br>
Since the wireless MAN system has a wide service coverage and supports<br>
a high transmission speed, it is suitable for supporting a high speed<br>
communication service. However, because the wireless MAN system is a<br>
system which does not completely consider the mobility of a subscriber station<br>
(SS), a handover due to the high-speed movement of a subscriber station is also<br>
not considered. Herein, the wireless MAN system is a broadband wireless<br>
access (BWA) communication system, and it has a service coverage area which is<br>
. largerthan that which the wireless LAN system provides and, additionally,<br><br>
supports a transmission speed higher than that which the wireless LAN system<br>
provides.<br>
A system employing an OFDM method and an OFDMA method in order<br>
to enable a physical channel of the wireless MAN system to support a broadband<br>
transmission network is known as an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers) 802.16a communication system. The IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system is a broadband wireless access communication system<br>
employing an OFDM/OFDMA method. Further, since the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system applies an OFDM/OFDMA method to the wireless MAN<br>
system, the IEEE 802.16a communication system transmits a physical channel<br>
signal using a plurality of sub-carriers, thereby enabling a high speed data<br>
transmission. Therefore, the IEEE 802.16a communication system is called a<br>
broadband wireless access communication system.<br>
Hereinafter, the structure of the conventional IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system will be descried with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram schematically showing the structure of the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system. The IEEE 802.16a communication system<br>
has a single cell structure and includes a base station (BS) 100 and a plurality of<br>
subscriber stations 110, 120, and 130 controlled by the base station 100. The<br>
transmission/reception of signals between the base station 100 and the subscriber<br>
stations 110, 120, and 130 are accomplished through the OFDM/OFDMA method.<br>
Hereinafter, the structure of the downlink frame of the conventional IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system will be descried with reference to FIG. 2 which is<br>
a view which illustrates the structure of the downlink frame of the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the downlink frame of the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system includes a preamble portion 200, a broadcast control<br>
portion 210, and a plurality of time division multiplex (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
TDM) portions 220 and 230. A synchronization signal (i.e., preamble sequence)<br>
used in obtaining a mutual synchronization between a base station and a<br>
subscriber station is transmitted through the preamble portion 200. The<br>
broadcast control portion 210 includes a downlink (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
DL) portion DL-MAP 211 and an uplink (hereinafter, referred to as an UL)<br>
portion UL-MAP 213. The DLMAP portion 211 is a portion through which a<br>
DLMAP message is transmitted. Table 1 shows information elements<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as IEs) contained in the DL_MAP message.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the DLMAP message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a transmitted<br>
message, the 'PHYsical (PHY) Synchronization' set according to a modulation<br>
method and a demodulation method applied to a physical channel in order to<br>
obtain a synchronization, the 'DCD count' representing a count corresponding to<br>
the configuration variation of a downlink channel descript (hereinafter, referred to<br>
as a DCD) message containing a downlink bust profile, the 'Base Station ID'<br>
representing a base station identifier (BSID), and the 'Number of DLMAP<br>
Elements n' representing the number of elements existing after the Base Station<br>
ID. Especially, the DLMAP message contains information on ranging codes<br>
assigned to each ranging which will be described later.<br>
Further, the UL_MAP portion 213 is a portion through which an<br>
UL_MAP message is transmitted. Table 2 shown below illustrates IEs contained<br>
in the UL MAP message.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the ULMAP message includes a plurality of IEs,<br>
that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a transmitted<br>
message, the 'Uplink Channel ID' representing a used uplink channel identifier,<br>
the 'UCD count' representing a count corresponding to the configuration variation<br>
of an uplink channel descript (hereinafter, referred to as an UCD) message<br>
containing an uplink bust profile, and the 'Number of UL_MAP Elements n'<br>
representing the number of elements existing after the UCD count. Herein, the<br>
uplink channel identifier is uniquely assigned in a media access control<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a MAC) sub-layer.<br>
Further, the TDM portions 220 and 230 (as shown in FIG. 2) are portions<br>
corresponding to time slots assigned to each subscriber station by a time division<br>
multiplexing (hereinafter, referred to as a TDM) time division multiple access<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a TDMA) TDM/TDMA method. The base station<br>
transmits broadcast information, which must be broadcasted, to subscriber<br>
stations managed by the base station through the DL_MAP portion 211 of the<br>
downlink frame by means of a preset center carrier. Then, each of the subscriber<br>
stations is powered on and the base station then monitors all frequency bands set<br>
in each of the subscriber stations in advance, and detects a pilot channel signal<br>
having the highest pilot carrier to interference and noise ratio (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as a CINR).<br>
Also, the subscriber station determines a base station having transmitted<br>
the pilot channel signal having the highest CINR to be a base station to which the<br>
subscriber station currently belongs. Further, the subscriber station confirms the<br>
DLMAP portion 211 and the ULMAP portion 213 of the downlink frame<br>
transmitted by the base station, and confirms control information controlling an<br>
uplink and a downlink of the subscriber station and information representing an<br>
actual position of data transmission/reception.<br>
Table 3, illustrated below, shows the structure of the UCD message.<br>
Table 3<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 3, the UCD message includes a plurality of IEs, that is,<br>
the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a transmitted message,<br>
the 'Uplink Channel ID' representing a used uplink channel identifier, the<br>
'Configuration Change Count' counted by a base station, the 'Mini-slot Size'<br>
representing the size of a mini-slot of an uplink physical channel, the 'Ranging<br>
Backoff Start' representing a start point of a backoff using an initial ranging, that<br>
is, the size of an initial backoff window using an initial ranging, the 'Ranging<br>
Backoff End representing an end point of a backoff using an initial ranging, that is,<br>
the size of a final backoff window, the 'Request Backoff Start' representing a start<br>
point of a backoff for 'contention data and requests', that is, the size of an initial<br>
backoff window, and the 'Request Backoff End representing an end point of a<br>
backoff for 'contention data and requests', that is, the size of a final backoff<br>
window.<br>
Herein, the value of the backoff represents a kind of waiting time value<br>
for which a subscriber station must wait for the next ranging when failure occurs<br>
in rangings which will be described later. Further, a base station must transmit<br>
the backoff value, which is information on a time period for which the subscriber<br>
station must wait for the next ranging, to the subscriber station when the<br>
subscriber station fails in a ranging. For instance, when a value by the Ranging<br>
Backoff Start and the Ranging Backoff End is set to be 10, the subscriber station<br><br>
passes a chance in which the subscriber station can perform rangings of 210 times<br>
(i.e., 1024 times) and then must perform the next ranging.<br>
Hereinafter, the structure of the uplink frame of the conventional IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system will be descried with reference to FIG. 3, which is<br>
a view which illustrates the structure of the uplink frame of the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
Before describing FIG. 3, rangings as described and used in the IEEE<br>
802.16a communication system, include, an initial ranging, a maintenance<br>
ranging, that is, a periodic ranging, and a bandwidth request ranging each of<br>
which will be described in detail below.<br>
The initial ranging is a ranging which is performed when a base station<br>
requests the initial ranging in order to obtain a synchronization with a subscriber<br>
station. Further, the initial ranging is a ranging which is performed in order to<br>
match an exact time offset between the subscriber station and the base station and<br>
adjust the transmit power. That is, the subscriber station is powered on, receives<br>
a DL_MAP message, an UL_MAP message, and a UCD message, and obtains<br>
synchronization with the base station. Then, the subscriber station performs the<br>
initial ranging to adjust the time offset and the transmit power with the base<br>
station. The base station receives the MAC address of the subscriber station<br>
from the subscriber station through the initial ranging procedure. Further, the<br>
base station generates a basic connection ID (hereinafter, referred to as a basic<br>
CID) and a primary management connection ID (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
primary management CID) mapped with the received MAC address of the<br>
subscriber station, and then transmits the generated basic CID and the primary<br>
management CID to the subscriber station. Then, the subscriber station<br>
recognizes the basic CID and the primary management CID of the subscriber<br>
station through the initial ranging procedure.<br>
Herein, since the IEEE 802.16a communication system employs an<br>
OFDM/OFDMA method, the ranging procedure requires ranging sub-channels<br>
and ranging codes. A base station assigns usable raging codes (RCs) according to<br>
the object of a raging, that is, the kind of a raging. This will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
The raging code is generated by segmenting pseudo-random noise<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a PN) sequence having a predetermined length (e.g.,<br>
length of 215-1 bits) by a predetermined unit. Generally, two sub-channels having<br>
a length of 53 bits constitute one ranging channel. Further, the raging code is<br>
constructed by segmenting a PN code through the ranging channel having a<br>
length of 106 bits. The 48 raging codes i.e., RC#1 to RC#48) (at maximum for 48<br>
ranging codes per subscriber station) constructed in this way may be assigned to a<br><br>
subscriber station, and two raging codes (at minimum per a subscriber station) are<br>
applied to the three types of rangings, that is, the initial ranging, the periodic<br>
ranging and the bandwidth request ranging, according to a default value. In this<br>
way, different raging codes are assigned to each ranging. For instance, N<br>
number of raging codes are assigned for the initial ranging (N RCs for initial<br>
ranging), M number of raging codes are assigned for the periodic ranging (M RCs<br>
for periodic ranging), and L number of raging codes are assigned for the<br>
bandwidth request ranging (L RCs for BW-request ranging). The raging codes<br>
assigned in this way are transmitted to subscriber stations through the DL_MAP<br>
message as described above, and the subscriber stations perform the ranging<br>
procedure by using the raging codes contained in the DLMAP message<br>
according to the objects of the raging code.<br>
The periodic ranging is a ranging periodically performed when the<br>
subscriber station having adjusted the time offset and the transmit power with the<br>
base station through the initial ranging adjusts a channel status, etc., with the base<br>
station. The subscriber station performs the periodic ranging by means of the<br>
ranging codes assigned for the periodic ranging.<br>
The bandwidth request ranging is a ranging performed when the<br>
subscriber station having adjusted the time offset and the transmit power with the<br>
base station through the initial ranging requests a bandwidth assignment in order<br>
to actually perform a communication with the base station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the uplink frame includes an 'Initial Maintenance<br>
Opportunities' portion 300 using the initial ranging, and the maintenance ranging,<br>
that is, the periodic ranging, a 'Request Contention Opportunities' portion 310<br>
using the bandwidth request ranging, and a 'SS scheduled data' portion 320<br>
containing the uplink data of subscriber stations. The Initial Maintenance<br>
Opportunities portion 300 includes a plurality of access burst intervals actually<br>
containing an initial ranging and a periodic ranging, and a collision interval in<br>
which collision between access burst intervals occurs. The Request Contention<br>
Opportunities portion 310 includes a plurality of bandwidth request intervals<br>
containing a bandwidth request ranging, and a collision interval in which collision<br>
between bandwidth request intervals occurs. Further, the SS scheduled data<br>
portion 320 includes a plurality of SS scheduled data parts (i.e., SS 1 scheduled<br>
data part to SS N scheduled data part) and a subscriber station transition gap<br>
which is present in each of the SS scheduled data parts.<br>
An uplink interval usage code (hereinafter, referred to as a UIUC) portion<br>
which is a portion in which information designating the use of an offset recorded<br>
in an offset portion is recorded. Table 4 below shows the UIUC portion.<br>
Table 4<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 4, the UIUC portion contains information designating<br>
the use of the offset recorded in the offset portion. For instance, when a value of<br>
2 is recorded in the UIUC portion, it signifies that a starting offset used in the<br>
initial ranging is recorded in the offset portion. When a value of 3 is recorded in<br>
the UIUC portion, it signifies that a starting offset used in the maintenance<br>
ranging or the bandwidth request ranging is recorded in the offset portion. As<br>
described above, the offset portion is a portion recording a starting offset value<br>
used in the initial ranging, the bandwidth request ranging, or the maintenance<br>
ranging according to the information recorded in the UIUC portion. Further,<br>
information on a characteristic of a physical channel to be transmitted in the<br>
UIUC portion is recorded in the UCD message.<br><br>
Hereinafter, a ranging process between a base station and a subscriber<br>
station in the conventional IEEE 802.16a communication system will be descried<br>
with reference to FIG. 4 which is a flow diagram illustrating the ranging process<br>
between the base station and the subscriber station in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the subscriber station 400 is powered on, monitors all<br>
frequency bands set in the subscriber station 400 in advance, and detects a pilot<br>
channel signal having the highest CINR. Also, the subscriber station 400<br>
determines a base station 420 having transmitted the pilot channel signal having<br>
the highest CINR to be the base station 420 to which the subscriber station 400<br>
currently belongs. Then, the subscriber station 400 receives the preamble of the<br>
downlink frame transmitted from the base station 420 and obtains a system<br>
synchronization with the base station 420.<br>
As described above, when the system synchronization is obtained<br>
between the subscriber station 400 and the base station 420, the base station 420<br>
transmits a DL_MAP message and an UL_MAP message to the subscriber station<br>
400 in steps 411 and 413, respectively. Herein, as described in Table 1, the<br>
DLMAP message performs the function of informing the subscriber station<br>
400 of information required when the subscriber station 400 obtains a<br>
synchronization with respect to the base station 420 in a downlink, and<br>
information on the structure of a physical channel capable of receiving messages<br>
transmitted to the subscriber station 400 in the downlink. Further, as described<br>
in table 2, the UL_MAP message performs the function of informing the<br>
subscriber station 400 of information on the scheduling period of a subscriber<br>
station and the structure of a physical channel in an uplink.<br>
Meanwhile, the DLMAP message is broadcasted from a base station to<br>
all subscriber stations. Herein, a case in which a certain subscriber station can<br>
continuously receive the DLMAP message signifies that the subscriber station<br>
has synchronized with the base station. That is, the subscriber stations having<br>
received the DLMAP message can receive all messages transmitted through a<br>
downlink. Further, as described in Table 2, when the subscriber station fails in<br>
an access, the base station transmits the UCD message containing information<br>
notifying an usable backoff value to the subscriber station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the subscriber station 400 having synchronized with<br>
the base station 420 performs the ranging, the subscriber station 400 transmits a<br>
ranging request (hereinafter, referred to as a RNG_REQ) message to the base<br>
station 420 in step 415. Then, in step 417, the base station 420 having received<br>
the RNGREQ message transmits a ranging response (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
RNG_RSP) message, which contains information for compensating for<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 5, the 'Downlink Channel ID' represents a downlink<br>
channel identifier contained in the RNGREQ message received in the subscriber<br>
station 400 through the UCD. The 'Pending Until Complete' represents a<br>
priority of a transmitted ranging response. That is, when the Pending Until<br>
Complete has a value of 0, a previous ranging response has a high priority. In<br>
contrast, when the Pending Until Complete has values other than 0, a currently<br>
transmitted ranging response has a high priority.<br>
Table 6 illustrated below, shows the structure of the RNGRSP message<br>
corresponding to the RNGREQ message shown in Table 5.<br><br>
As shown in Table 6, the 'Uplink Channel ID' represents an uplink<br>
channel identifier contained in the RNG_REQ message. Meanwhile, in FIG. 4,<br>
since the IEEE 802.16a communication system considers only a state in which a<br>
subscriber station is currently motionless, that is, it does not entirely consider the<br>
mobility of the subscriber station, the base station 420 (as shown in Fig. 4)<br>
communicating with the subscriber station 400 unconditionally becomes a serving<br>
base station.<br>
As described above, the IEEE 802.16a communication system considers<br>
only a state in which a subscriber station is currently motionless (i.e., a state in<br><br>
which the mobility of the subscriber station is not entirely considered), and a<br>
single cell structure. However, an IEEE 802.16e communication system is<br>
stipulated as a system considering the mobility of a subscriber station in the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system. Accordingly, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system must consider the mobility of a subscriber station in a<br>
multi-cell environment. In order to support the mobility of the subscriber station<br>
in a multi-cell environment, changes in operations of the subscriber station and a<br>
base station are necessarily required. Especially, in order to support the mobility<br>
of the subscriber station, research into a handover of the subscriber station<br>
considering a multi-cell structure has been actively pursued.<br>
Hereinafter, the structure of the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system will be described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram schematically showing the structure of the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has a multi-<br>
cell structure, that is, a cell 500 and a cell 550. Further, the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system includes a base station 510 controlling the cell 500, a base<br>
station 540 controlling the cell 550, and a plurality of mobile subscriber stations<br>
(MSSs) 511, 513, 530, 551, and 553. The transmission/reception of signals<br>
between the base stations 510 and 540 and the mobile subscriber stations 511, 513,<br>
530, 551, and 553 is accomplished through an OFDM/OFDMA method. Herein,<br>
the mobile subscriber station 530 (of the mobile subscriber stations 511, 513, 530,<br>
551, and 553) exists in an overlapping area (i.e., handover area) between the cell<br>
500 and the cell 550. Accordingly, only when a handover for the mobile<br>
subscriber station 530 must be supported, it is possible to support the mobility for<br>
the mobile subscriber station 530.<br>
In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, a certain mobile subscriber<br>
station receives pilot channel signals transmitted from a plurality of base stations,<br>
and measures CINRs of the received pilot channel signals. The mobile<br>
subscriber station then selects a base station, which is the base station that has<br>
transmitted a pilot channel signal having the highest CINR from among the<br>
measured CINRs of the pilot channel signals, as a base station to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station currently belongs. That is, the mobile subscriber<br>
station recognizes a base station, which transmits a pilot channel signal capable of<br>
being favorably received in the mobile subscriber station, from among base<br>
stations having transmitted pilot channel signals as a base station to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station belongs. As a result, the base station to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station currently belongs becomes a serving base station. The<br>
mobile subscriber station having selected the serving base station receives a<br><br>
downlink frame and an uplink frame transmitted from the serving base station.<br>
Herein, the downlink frame and the uplink frame of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system have the same structures as those of the downlink frame<br>
and the uplink frame of the IEEE 802.16a communication system shown in FIGS.<br>
2 and 3 above and described herein.<br>
The serving base station transmits a mobile subscriber station neighbor<br>
advertisement (hereinafter, referred to as a MOB_NBR_ADV) message to the<br>
mobile subscriber station. Table 7 illustrated below shows the structure of the<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV message.<br><br>
As shown in Table 7, the MOBNBRADV message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a<br>
transmitted message, the 'Configuration Change Count' representing the number<br>
of times by which a Configuration changes, the 'N_NEIGHBORS' representing<br>
the number of neighbor base stations, the 'Neighbor BS-ID' representing<br>
identifiers (ID) of the neighbor base stations, the 'Physical Frequency'<br>
representing the physical frequency of the neighbor base station, and the 'TLV<br>
Encoded Neighbor Information' representing extra information relating to the<br>
neighbor base station in addition to the information.<br>
The mobile subscriber station having received the MOB_NBR_ADV<br>
message transmits a mobile subscriber station scanning interval allocation request<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a MOBSCNREQ) message to the serving base<br>
station when the mobile subscriber station intends to scan the CINRs of pilot<br>
channel signals transmitted from neighbor base stations. Herein, since a time<br>
point at which the mobile subscriber station requests a scanning has no direct<br>
relation to a scanning operation for the CINR of the pilot channel signal, a<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 8, the MOBSCNREQ message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a<br>
transmitted message and the 'Scan Duration' representing a scan duration for<br>
which the mobile subscriber station scans the CINRs of the pilot channel signals<br>
transmitted from the neighbor base stations. The 'Scan Duration' is constructed<br>
by the frame. Herein, the 'Management Message Type' of the MOBSCNREQ<br>
message to be transmitted has not been defined yet (i.e., Management Message<br>
Type = undefined or "?" as is shown in the table to conserve space).<br>
Meanwhile, the serving base station having received the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message transmits a mobile subscriber station scanning interval<br>
allocation response (hereinafter, referred to as a MOBSCNRSP) message,<br>
which contains information to be scanned by the mobile subscriber station, to the<br>
mobile subscriber station. Table 9 illustrated below shows the structure of the<br>
MOB_SCN_RSP message.<br><br>
As shown in Table 9, the MOBSCNRSP message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a<br>
transmitted message, the connection ID (hereinafter, referred to as a CID) of the<br><br>
mobile subscriber station having transmitted the MOBSCNREQ message, and<br>
a scan duration. In Table 9, the 'Management Message Type' of the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message to be transmitted has not been defined yet (i.e.,<br>
Management Message Type = undefined), and the scan duration is a duration for<br>
which the mobile subscriber station performs the pilot CINR scanning. The<br>
mobile subscriber station having received the MOBSCNRSP message<br>
containing the scanning information scans pilot CINRs for neighbor base stations,<br>
which has been recognized through the MOB_NBR_ADV message, according to<br>
the scanning information parameters.<br>
In order to support a handover in the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system, a mobile subscriber station must measure CINRs of pilot channel signals<br>
transmitted from neighbor base stations and a base station (i.e., serving base<br>
station) to which the mobile subscriber station currently belongs. Further, when<br>
the CINR of the pilot channel signal transmitted from the serving base station is<br>
smaller than the CINRs of the pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor<br>
base stations, the mobile subscriber station requests a handover from the serving<br>
base station. Herein, for convenience of description, the sentence 'measure the<br>
CINR of the pilot channel signal' may be expressed by a sentence 'scan or<br>
perform a scanning for the CINR of the pilot channel signal'. Also, the words<br>
'scan' and 'scanning' have the same concept; 'scan' is used together with<br>
'scanning' for convenience of description,.<br>
Hereinafter, a handover process by the request of a mobile subscriber<br>
station in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system will be descried<br>
with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating the handover process by the request<br>
of the mobile subscriber station in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, first, a serving base station 640 transmits a<br>
MOBNBRADV message to a mobile subscriber station 600 in step 611. Then,<br>
the mobile subscriber station 600 receives the MOBNBRADV message and<br>
obtains information on neighbor base stations. Further, in step 613, the mobile<br>
subscriber station 600 transmits a MOBSCNREQ message to the serving base<br>
station 640 when the mobile subscriber station 600 intends to scan the CINRs of<br>
pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations. Herein, since<br>
a time point at which the mobile subscriber station 600 requests a scanning has no<br>
direct relation to a scanning operation for the CINR of the pilot channel signal, a<br>
detailed description about the time point will be omitted. Meanwhile, in step<br>
615, the serving base station 640 having received the MOBSCNREQ message<br>
transmits the MOB_SCN_RSP message, which contains information to be<br><br>
scanned by the mobile subscriber station 600, to the mobile subscriber station 600.<br>
In step 617, the mobile subscriber station 600 having received the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message containing the scanning information performs a<br>
scanning for the CINRs of pilot channel signals with respect to neighbor base<br>
stations, which have been recognized through the reception of the<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV message, according to parameters (i.e., scan duration)<br>
contained in the MOB_SCN_RSP message.<br>
Next, after having completely scanned the CINRs of the pilot channel<br>
signals received from the neighbor base stations, when the mobile subscriber<br>
station 600 determines to change the serving base station 640 to which the mobile<br>
subscriber station 600 currently belongs in step 619, that is, the mobile subscriber<br>
station 600 determines to change the current serving base station 640 to another<br>
new base station, the mobile subscriber station 600 transmits a mobile subscriber<br>
station handover request (hereinafter, referred to as a MOBMSSHOREQ)<br>
message to the serving base station 640 in step 621. Herein, a new base station<br>
(i.e., a base station to which the mobile subscriber station 600 is to be handed<br>
over), which is not a serving base station to which the mobile subscriber station<br>
600 currently belongs, is called a target base station (target BS). Table 10 shows<br>
the structure of the MOBMSSHOREQ message and is illustrated below.<br><br>
As shown in Table 10, the MOBMSSHOREQ message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of<br>
a transmitted message, and the 'N_Recommended' representing a result obtained<br>
by a scanning of a mobile subscriber station. Herein, as shown in Table 10, the<br>
'N_Recommended' contains the identifiers of neighbor base stations, a CINR of a<br>
pilot channel signal for each of the neighbor base stations, and the level of a<br>
service predicted to be provided from the neighbor base stations to the mobile<br><br>
subscriber station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the serving base station 640 receives the<br>
MOB_MSSHO_REQ message transmitted from the mobile subscriber station 600,<br>
the serving base station 640 detects a list of target base stations to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station 600 can be handed over by means of the<br>
'N_Recommended' information of the received MOB_MSSHO_REQ message in<br>
step 623. Herein, for convenience of description, the list of target base stations<br>
to which the mobile subscriber station 600 can be handed over will be called a<br>
'handover-executable target base station list'. In FIG. 6, it is assumed that a first<br>
target base station 660 and a second target base station 680 exist in the handover-<br>
executable target base station list. Also, the handover-executable target base<br>
station list may include a plurality of target base stations. In steps 625 and 627,<br>
the serving base station 640 transmits a handover notifications (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as HO_notifications) message to the target base stations (i.e., the first<br>
target base station 660 and the second target base station 680) contained in the<br>
handover-executable target base station list. Table 11 shows the structure of the<br>
HOnotification message and illustrated below.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 11, the HO_notification message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, that is, an identifier MSS ID of the mobile subscriber station 600 intending<br>
to perform a handover procedure to the first target base station 660 or the second<br>
target base station 680, an estimated start time of a handover by the mobile<br>
subscriber station 600, and information on the bandwidth requested from the<br>
mobile subscriber station 600 to a target base station which will become the new<br>
serving base station, and the level of a service that is to be provided to the mobile<br>
subscriber station 600. Herein, the bandwidth and the service level requested by<br>
the mobile subscriber station 600 are identical to the predicted service level<br>
information recorded in the MOB_MSSHO-REQ message described in Table 10<br>
above.<br>
Meanwhile, when the first target base station 660 or the second target<br>
base station 680 receive the HOnotification messages from the serving base<br>
station 640, they each transmit handover notification response (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as a HO_notification_response) messages, response messages with<br>
respect to the HOnotification message, to the serving base station 640 in steps<br>
629 and 631, respectively. Table 12 shows the structure of the HO_<br>
notification_ response message and is illustrated below.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 12, the HOnotificationresponse message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, that is, an identifier MSS ID (MSS unique identifier) of a mobile<br>
subscriber station intending to perform a handover procedure to target base<br>
stations, a response ACK/NACK regarding whether or not the target base stations<br>
can perform a handover according to the handover request of the mobile<br>
subscriber station, and bandwidth and service level information capable of being<br>
provided by each target base station when the mobile subscriber station is handed<br>
over to each target base station.<br>
Meanwhile, the serving base station 640 having received the<br>
HO_notification_response messages from the first target base station 660 and the<br>
second target base station 680 analyzes the received HOnotificationresponse<br>
message, and selects a target base station, which can optimally provide the<br>
bandwidth and the service level requested by the mobile subscriber station 600<br>
when the mobile subscriber station 600 is handed over, as a final target base<br>
station to which the mobile subscriber station 600 is to be handed over. For<br>
instance, when it is assumed that the service level capable of being provided by<br>
the first target base station 660 is smaller that that requested by the mobile<br>
subscriber station 600, and the service level capable of being provided by the<br>
second target base station 680 is identical to that requested by the mobile<br>
subscriber station 600, the serving base station 640 selects the second target base<br>
station 680 as a final target base station to which the mobile subscriber station<br><br>
600 is to be handed over. Accordingly, the serving base station 640 transmits a<br>
handover notification confirmation (hereinafter, referred to as a HO_<br>
notificationconfirm) message, a response message with respect to the<br>
HOnotificationresponse message, to the second target base station 680 in step<br>
633. Table 13 shows the structure of the HO_ notificationconfirm message and<br>
is illustrated below.<br><br>
As shown in Table 13, the HO_ notificationconfirm message includes a<br>
plurality of IEs, that is, an identifier MSS ID (MSS unique identifier) of a mobile<br>
subscriber station intending to perform a handover procedure to a selected target<br>
base station, and bandwidth and service level information capable of being<br>
provided by the selected target base station when the mobile subscriber station is<br>
handed over to the selected target base station.<br>
Also, the serving base station 640 transmits a mobile subscriber station<br><br>
handover response (hereinafter, referred to as a MOB_HO_RSP) message, a<br>
response message with respect to the MOB_MSSHO_REQ message, to the<br>
mobile subscriber station 600 in step 635. Herein, the MOBHORSP message<br>
contains information on a target base station to which the mobile subscriber<br>
station 600 is to be handed over. Table 14 illustrated below, shows the structure<br>
of the MOB_HO_RSP message.<br><br>
As shown in Table 14, the MOBHORSP message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a<br>
transmitted message, an estimated start time of a handover procedure, and the<br>
'N_Recommended' representing a result for target base stations selected by a<br>
serving base station. Herein, as shown in Table 14, the 'NRecommended'<br>
contains identifiers of the selected target base stations and the level of a service<br>
predicted to be provided from each target base station to a mobile subscriber<br>
station. In FIG. 6, the MOBHORSP message finally includes only target base<br>
station information on the second target base station 680 from among target base<br>
stations existing in the handover-executable target base station list. However,<br>
when there exist a plurality of target base stations capable of providing bandwidth<br>
and service level requested by the mobile subscriber station 600 from among the<br>
target base stations existing in the handover-executable target base station list, the<br>
MOBHORSP message includes information on the plurality of target base<br>
stations.<br>
Next, the mobile subscriber station 600 having received the<br>
MOBHORSP message analyzes the 'NRecommended' information contained<br>
in the MOB_HO_RSP message and selects a target base station to which the<br><br>
mobile subscriber station 600 is to be handed over. Then, the mobile subscriber<br>
station 600 having selected the target base station to which the mobile subscriber<br>
station 600 is to be handed over transmits a mobile subscriber station handover<br>
indication (hereinafter, referred to as a MOB_HO_IND) message, a response<br>
message with respect to the MOBHORSP message, to the serving base station<br>
640 in step 637. Table 15 illustrated below, shows the structure of the<br>
MOBHOIND message.<br><br>
As shown in Table 15, the MOBHOIND message includes a plurality<br>
of IEs, that is, the 'Management Message Type' representing the type of a<br>
transmitted message, the 'TargetBS_ID' representing an identifier of a target<br>
base station selected by a mobile subscriber station, and the 'TLV Encoded<br>
Information' representing extra information in addition to the information.<br>
Meanwhile, in step 639, the serving base station 640 having received the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message recognizes that the mobile subscriber station 600 is<br>
handed over to the target base station (i.e., the second target base station 680)<br>
contained in the MOBHOIND message, and then releases a link currently setup<br>
with the mobile subscriber station 600. In this way, when the link with the<br>
serving base station 640 is released, the mobile subscriber station 600 performs a<br>
handover procedure to the second target base station 680 in step 641.<br>
Hereinafter, a handover process by the request of a base station in the<br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating the handover process by the request<br>
of the base station in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Before describing FIG. 7, the handover process by the request of the base<br>
station occurs when the base station is overloaded and requires some type of<br>
load- sharing for dispersing the load of the base station, or the base station must<br>
cope with the change of the uplink status of a mobile subscriber station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, first, a serving base station 740 transmits a<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV message to a mobile subscriber station 700 in step 711. Then,<br><br>
the mobile subscriber station 700 receives the MOB_NBR_ADV message and<br>
obtains information on neighbor base stations. Further, in step 713, the mobile<br>
subscriber station 700 transmits a MOBSCNREQ message to the serving base<br>
station 740 when the mobile subscriber station 700 intends to scan the CINRs of<br>
pilot channel signals transmitted from the neighbor base stations. Herein, since<br>
a time point at which the mobile subscriber station 700 requests a scanning has no<br>
direct relation to a scanning operation for the CINR of the pilot channel signal, a<br>
detailed description about the time point will be omitted. In step 715, the<br>
serving base station 740 having received the MOB_SCN_REQ message transmits<br>
the MOB_SCN_RSP message, which contains information to be scanned by the<br>
mobile subscriber station 700, to the mobile subscriber station 700. In step 717,<br>
the mobile subscriber station 700 having received the MOB_SCN_RSP message<br>
containing the scanning information performs a CINR scanning of pilot channel<br>
signals with respect to neighbor base stations, which has been recognized through<br>
the reception of the MOBNBRADV message, according to parameters (i.e.,<br>
scan duration) contained in the MOBSCNRSP message.<br>
Meanwhile, when the mobile subscriber station 700 managed by the<br>
serving base station 740 determines to perform a handover procedure by its own<br>
handover necessity in step 719, the serving base station 740 transmits the<br>
HO_notification messages to neighbor base stations 760 an 780 in steps 721 and<br>
723. Herein, the HO_notification message contains information on a bandwidth<br>
and the level of a service which must be provided by a target base station to be a<br>
new serving base station of the mobile subscriber station 700. In FIG. 7, it is<br>
assumed that the neighbor base stations of the serving base station 740 are two<br>
base stations, that is, the first target base station 760 and the second target base<br>
station 780.<br>
In steps 725 and 727, the first target base station 760 and the second<br>
target base station 780 receive the HOnotification messages respectively, and<br>
transmit the HOnotificationresponse messages, response messages for the<br>
HOnotification messages, to the serving base station 740. As described in<br>
Table 12, the HOnotificationresponse message contains a response<br>
ACK/NACK regarding whether or not the target base stations can perform a<br>
handover procedure requested by the serving base station 740, and bandwidth and<br>
service level information capable of being provided to the mobile subscriber<br>
station 700.<br>
Next, after receiving the HO_ notification_ response messages from the<br>
first target base station 760 and the second target base station 780, the serving<br>
base station 740 then selects target base stations capable of providing the<br>
bandwidth and the service level requested by the mobile subscriber station 700.<br><br>
For instance, when it is assumed that the service level capable of being provided<br>
by the first target base station 760 is smaller than that requested by the mobile<br>
subscriber station 700, and the service level capable of being provided by the<br>
second target base station 780 is identical to that requested by the mobile<br>
subscriber station 700, the serving base station 740 selects the second target base<br>
station 780 as a final target base station to which the mobile subscriber station<br>
700 is to be handed over. Further, the serving base station 740 having selected<br>
the second target base station 780 as the final target base station transmits a<br>
HOnotificationconfirm message, which is a response message for the<br>
HO_notification_response message in step 729.<br>
Next, after transmitting the HO_notificationconfirm message to the<br>
second target base station 780, the serving base station 740 transmits a<br>
MOBHORSP message to the mobile subscriber station 700 in step 731.<br>
Herein, the MOB_HO_RSP message contains NRecommended information<br>
selected by the serving base station 740, that is, selected target base stations e.g.,<br>
in FIG. 7, the second target base station 780) and the bandwidth and the service<br>
level capable of being provided from the target base stations to the mobile<br>
subscriber station 700. The mobile subscriber station 700 having received the<br>
MOBHORSP message recognizes the a handover has been requested by the<br>
serving base station 740, and selects a final target base station to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station 700 is to be handed over with reference to the<br>
NRecommended information contained in the MOB_HO_RSP message. After<br>
selecting the final target base station, the mobile subscriber station 700 transmits<br>
a MOBHOIND message, a response message for the MOBHORSP message,<br>
to the serving base station 740 in step 733. Then, in step 735, the serving base<br>
station 740 having received MOBHOIND message recognizes that the mobile<br>
subscriber station 700 is to be handed over to the target base station contained in<br>
the MOB_HO_IND message, and then releases a link currently setup with the<br>
mobile subscriber station 700. In this way, when the link with the serving base<br>
station 740 is released, the mobile subscriber station 700 performs a handover<br>
procedure to the second target base station 780 in step 737.<br>
As described above, in the currently proposed handover procedure in the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system, a serving base station collects information<br>
of neighbor base stations, transmits a HOnotification message, and collects<br>
information necessary for the handover. Then, the serving base station receives<br>
a HOnotificationresponse message as a response of the HOnotification<br>
message, and transmits a MOBHORSP message containing information of<br>
target base stations to which a mobile subscriber station can be handed over to the<br>
corresponding mobile subscriber station. Meanwhile, the mobile subscriber<br><br>
station determines a base station to which the mobile subscriber station is to be<br>
handed over from a list of target base stations, to which the mobile subscriber<br>
station can be handed over, contained in the MOB_HO_RSP message, and then<br>
transmits a MOB_HO_IND message containing information on the determined<br>
base station to the serving base station. Then, the mobile subscriber station<br>
releases a current connection with the serving base and tries to connect with the<br>
determined base station.<br>
As described above, only a simple procedure for a handover is defined up<br>
to now. However, various circumstances may exist which have been not<br>
described in the procedure in a broadband mobile communication service of<br>
actual various radio environments. For instance, there may occur a case in<br>
which the serving base station must forcedly cause the subscriber station to<br>
perform a handover procedure according to the resource condition of the serving<br>
base station, or special circumstances such as the rejection of the subscriber<br>
station for a handover requested by the serving base station. Also, there may<br>
occur a case in which the movement direction of the subscriber station changes<br>
while being handed over to a target base station, and the subscriber station must<br>
cancel the handover procedure in order to connect to an original serving base<br>
station again.<br>
However, the conventional broadband mobile communication system has<br>
not yet presented methods for solving the circumstances which may occur as<br>
described above. Additionally, when the conventional method is applied to the<br>
aforementioned circumstances, it is ineffective and further, the performance of the<br>
system may be substantially reduced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment according to the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the<br><br>
following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known<br>
functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may<br>
make the subject matter of the present invention rather unclear.<br>
In describing the present invention, the terms 'handover' and 'handoff'<br>
have the same concept; 'handover' is used together with 'handoff. That is,<br>
when a predetermined mobile station releases a connection with a base station<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a serving base station) currently maintaining a<br>
connection with the mobile station according to circumstances, and connects to<br>
one (hereinafter, referred to as an object base station or a target base station) of<br>
neighbor base stations, the term 'handover' or the term 'handoff is used.<br>
Also, generally, a base station to/with which the mobile station currently<br>
connects and can exchange data is called a serving base station, and a plurality of<br>
base stations which are adjacent to the serving base station and can perform a<br>
handover procedure according to the moving of the mobile station are called<br>
neighbor base stations (neighbor BS).<br>
Meanwhile, in the conventional handover procedure as shown in FIGS. 6<br>
and 7 and described in the corresponding text, peripheral base stations of the<br>
serving base station, which are transmitted from the serving base station to the<br>
station through a MOBNBRADV message, are called neighbor base stations as<br>
described above. Herein, when the mobile station scans CINR values of the<br>
neighbor base stations and selects base stations satisfying predetermined<br>
conditions from among the neighbor base stations as base stations to which the<br>
mobile station can be handed over, the base stations selected by the mobile station<br>
are called recommended base stations.<br>
Further, the serving base station transmits HOnotification message to<br>
each recommended base station selected by the mobile station or each neighbor<br>
base station, and then receives HOnotification response messages. Also, the<br>
serving base station selects one or multiple base stations satisfying predetermined<br>
conditions under which a handover is possible for the station according to values<br>
contained in the received message. Herein, from among the recommended base<br>
stations or the neighbor base stations, one or multiple base stations satisfying<br>
predetermined conditions selected by serving base station are called target base<br>
stations. That is, one or multiple base stations may become the target base<br>
station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the serving base station transmits a predetermined<br>
message (e.g., MOB_HO_RSP message) containing information on one or more<br>
target base stations to the corresponding station, and the station selects one target<br>
base station from among one or more target base stations, the finally selected<br>
target base station is called a designated target base station.<br><br>
The present invention proposes various functions enabling a broadband<br>
mobile communication system to be capable of effectively processing various<br>
situations, in addition to a basic and simple handover function proposed in the<br>
conventional broadband mobile communication system. Accordingly,<br>
definitions of specific handoffs added according to circumstances proposed by the<br>
present invention are as follows.<br>
1)	Forced Handoff<br>
A serving base station can command a subscriber station to be handed<br>
over to a target base station of a neighbor cell. That is, the subscriber station<br>
having received a message containing the forced handoff option must necessarily<br>
perform a handoff procedure to a target base station within a time period<br>
designated by the serving base station. In the case of the forced handoff, the<br>
subscriber station cannot reject the handoff command.<br>
2)	Suggesting Handoff<br>
A serving base station transmits a mobile station (also known as a<br>
subscriber station) handoff message containing a message, which suggests that a<br>
subscriber station perform a handoff procedure to one of object base stations of a<br>
neighbor cell according to the request of the subscriber station or the judgment of<br>
the serving base station, to the subscriber station. Herein, the serving base<br>
station collects information on the base stations in the neighbor cell, selects a list<br>
of base stations, which satisfy service requirement conditions enabling the<br>
subscriber station to perform a handoff procedure and for which the subscriber<br>
station can perform a handoff procedure, and transmits the list to the subscriber<br>
station through a predetermined handoff message. When the subscriber station<br>
receives the suggesting handoff message, the subscriber station confirms the list<br>
of the target base stations contained in the message to select an optimum base<br>
station, thereby trying the suggesting handoff.<br>
The handoff type option differently defined as described above is added<br>
to a predetermined field of the aforementioned MOB_HO_RSP message and then<br>
is transmitted. In the present invention, the handoff type option is added to the<br>
MOBHORSP message form described in the prior art, and Table 16 (shown<br>
below) shows the new structure of the MOBHORSP message according to the<br>
present invention.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 16, the MOB_HO_RSP message according to the<br>
present invention contains the 'HO Type' field for the application of the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, whether the MOBHORSP message is a suggesting<br>
handoff or a forced handoff is determined according to the values of the field.<br>
That is, as shown in Table 16, when the 'HO Type' field has a value of 0,<br>
a suggesting handoff is performed. In contrast, when the 'HO Type' field has a<br>
value of 1, a forced handoff is performed. In processing the 'NRecommended'<br>
field after the function of the handoff is expanded as described above, when the<br>
value of the 'HO Type' field represents a suggesting handoff, the<br>
'NRecommended' field can have a value of more than 1. In contrast, when the<br>
value of the 'HO Type' field represents a forced handoff, a serving base station<br>
designates a specific target base station and orders a forced handoff.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that the 'NRecommended' field has a value of only 1.<br>
That is, in the case of the forced handoff, a subscriber station must be handed<br>
over to an object base station, which is designated by the value of the<br>
'N_Recommended' field, without alternative.<br>
Accordingly, when the forced handoff and the suggesting handoff are<br>
performed as described above, it is preferred that the 'Neighbor BS-ID' field<br>
includes a list of one or more base stations in the case of a suggesting handoff and<br>
includes a list of only one base station in the case of a forced handoff.<br>
Further, the present invention proposes a method for differently<br>
classifying a MOBHOIND message transmitted from a station to a base station<br>
according to circumstances and transmitting the MOB_HO_IND message in a<br>
basic handoff procedure proposed by the conventional broadband wireless mobile<br>
communication system. Definitions of procedures relating to each handoff<br>
newly added according to this method are as follows.<br>
1) Connection Release<br>
When a handoff has been normally performed and a connection with a<br>
serving base station must be ended, a subscriber station transmits a connection<br>
end message (i.e., a MOBHOIND message) containing a connection end option<br>
to the serving base station. The serving base station having received the<br><br>
connection end message immediately releases a connection with the<br>
corresponding subscriber station.<br>
2)	Handoff Cancel<br>
When a subscriber station moves into an original serving base station<br>
again during a handoff and thus it is unnecessary to perform a handoff procedure,<br>
or a subscriber station intends to cancel a handoff by other reasons, the subscriber<br>
station transmits a MOB_HO_IND message containing a handoff cancel option to<br>
the serving base station. The serving base station having received the handoff<br>
cancel message immediately cancels a handoff procedure for a corresponding<br>
subscriber station. If necessary, the serving base station notifies a proposed<br>
object base station that a handoff performance by a corresponding subscriber<br>
station has been cancelled.<br>
3)	Handoff Rejection<br>
After receiving a HO_RSP message from a serving base station, a<br>
subscriber station has not yet determined a proper target base station or does not<br>
perform a handoff procedure to a predetermined target base station contained in a<br>
target base station list by other reasons, the subscriber station transmits a<br>
MOB_HO_IND message containing a handoff rejection option to the serving base<br>
station according to the received HORSP message.<br>
In the present invention, a 'HO Indication Type' field is added to the<br>
MOBHOIND message to enable the MOBHOIND message according to<br>
each state to be processed. Table 17 shows the structure of the MOBHOIND<br>
message according to the present invention and is illustrated below.<br><br>
As shown in Table 17, in order to perform a function proposed by the<br>
present invention, the 'HO Indicator Type' field is added to the MOBHOIND<br>
message, thereby constructing a MOBHOIND message having various<br><br>
functions. The 'HO Indicator Type' field in Table 17 is proposed to enable the<br>
MOBHOIND message to inform a serving base station of a connection release<br>
with a base station or handoff rejection according to corresponding values.<br>
For instance, when the 'HO Indicator Type' field has a value of 00, a<br>
subscriber station releases a connection with a serving base station similarly to<br>
the prior art, and performs a normal handoff procedure to an already received<br>
corresponding target base station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the 'HO Indicator Type' field has a binary value of 01,<br>
the MOB_HO_IND message represents a handoff cancel. Accordingly, the<br>
subscriber station cancels a handoff procedure being performed and maintains a<br>
connection with an existing serving base station. Further, when the 'HO<br>
Indicator Type' field has a binary value of 10, the MOB_HO_IND message<br>
represents a handoff rejection. Accordingly, the subscriber station rejects a<br>
handoff to a target base station contained in the MOB_HO_IND message received<br>
from a serving base station, and maintains a connection with an existing serving<br>
base station. Furthermore, when the 'HO Indicator Type' field has a binary<br>
value of 11, the 'HO Indicator Type' field is reserved as a reserved portion.<br>
Further, the HO_notification_confirm message defined in Table 13 is a<br>
message enabling a serving base station to inform a target base station of a<br>
handoff. Accordingly, in the present invention, in the case of a handoff cancel,<br>
the HO_notification_confirm message is sent in advance, thereby enabling a<br>
target base station having received a handoff preparation instruction to understand<br>
the cancel of the handoff. That is, the HO_notification_confirm message has a<br>
changed structure as shown in the following Table 18.<br><br><br>
present invention, the 'Confirm type' field is added to the<br>
HO_notification_confirm	message,	thereby	constructing	a<br>
HOnotificationconfirm message having various functions. According to the<br>
'Confirm type' field having corresponding values in Table 18, the<br>
HOnotificationconfirm message enables the serving base station to inform the<br>
target base station of the performance of a handoff or the cancel of a handoff.<br>
For instance, when the 'Confirm type' field has a value of 0, the<br>
HO_notification_confirm message informs the target base station of the handoff<br>
of the subscriber station and enables the target base station to prepare the handoff<br>
of the subscriber station.<br>
In contrast, when the 'Confirm type' field has a value of 1, the<br>
HO_notification_confirm message represents the cancel of the handoff.<br>
Accordingly, the target base station cancels the handoff procedure being<br>
performed by the already-sent HOnotificationconfirm message.<br>
In the present invention as described above, in order to accomplish a<br>
handover according to various handover circumstances, related fields of various<br>
messages are defined. Hereinafter, a procedure by which a subscriber station<br>
rejects or cancels a handover being performed according to each circumstance<br>
according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to<br>
FIGS. 8 to 12.<br>
First, a message transmission/reception procedure between a subscriber<br>
station and base stations according to an embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 8 to 10.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating a case in which a base station<br>
determines whether or not a subscriber station performs a handoff procedure and<br>
forces the corresponding subscriber station to perform the handoff procedure<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 is a flow diagram<br>
illustrating a case in which a subscriber station requests a handoff to a serving<br>
base station, and then cancels the requested handoff before receiving a response<br>
message from the serving base station or after receiving the response message<br>
from the serving base station, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Further, FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating a case in which a<br>
subscriber station requests a handoff to a serving base station, receives a response<br>
message, and rejects the handoff using information of the received response<br>
message because a target base station list contained in the response message<br>
received in the subscriber station is not proper, according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Meanwhile, messages used in each procedure for achieving the<br>
embodiments are messages used in performing the conventional handover.<br><br>
However, the present invention is achieved by adding parameters described in<br>
Tables 16 and 17 proposed by the present invention to each of the messages.<br>
Hereinafter, a case in which a base station commands a forced handover<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 8. FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating a<br>
procedure by which a base station forces a handover in a broadband wireless<br>
access communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a base station determines a handover for a mobile<br>
subscriber station as described in FIG. 7. Accordingly, since a procedure for<br>
steps 811, 813, 815, 817, 819, 821, 823, 825, 827, and 829 in FIG. 8, and 829 is<br>
the same as that for steps 711, 713, 715, 717, 719, 721, 723, 725, 727, and 729 in<br>
FIG. 7, respectively, a description about the procedure will be omitted.<br>
A serving base station 840 determines object base stations among a<br>
plurality of target base stations to which a mobile subscriber station can be<br>
handed over, transmits a HOnotificationconfirm message to the object base<br>
station through step 829, and then transmits a list of the determined target base<br>
stations, to which a mobile subscriber station can be handed over, to the<br>
corresponding mobile subscriber station through a MOB_HO_RSP message.<br>
Meanwhile, after the procedure, the present invention enables the<br>
following process to be performed. That is, in a case in which the<br>
MOBHORSP message is transmitted, when the MOBHORSP message<br>
containing information signifying that the MOBHORSP message is a message<br>
of a forced handover is transmitted in step 831, for instance, the MOBHORSP<br>
message containing information (HO Type=1) reporting a forced handover is<br>
transmitted, the mobile subscriber station 800 having received the<br>
MOB_HO_RSP message does not reject the forced handover instruction.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile subscriber station 800 receives the MOBHORSP<br>
message containing information (HO Type=1) of the forced handover, and must<br>
perform a handover procedure to a base station, to which the mobile subscriber<br>
station 800 must be handed over, contained in the MOBHORSP message.<br>
That is, the mobile subscriber station 800 transmits a MOBHOIND message to<br>
the serving base station 840 in step 833, releases a link with the serving base<br>
station 840 in step 835, and starts a connection with the corresponding base<br>
station to which the mobile subscriber station 800 must be handed over in step<br>
837.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to signify that the MOBHORSP message is a<br>
forced handover message, the 'HO Type' field is added to the MOB_HO_RSP<br>
message as shown in Table 16, and then the MOBHORSP message including<br>
the 'HO Type' field is transmitted.<br><br>
For instance, as described above, when the 'HO Type' field is set to have<br>
a value of 1, the mobile subscriber station having received the MOBHORSP<br>
message recognizes that the MOBHORSP message is a forced handover<br>
message, and then does not reject the determined handover. That is, the mobile<br>
subscriber station receives the MOBHORSP message and then must perform a<br>
handover procedure to one selected base station among the base stations, to which<br>
the mobile subscriber station 800 must be handed over, contained in the<br>
MOBHORSP message. When the number of the base stations, to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station 800 must be handed over, contained in the<br>
MOBHORSP message is one, the mobile subscriber station must<br>
unconditionally perform a handover procedure to the base station to which the<br>
mobile subscriber station 800 must be handed over.<br>
Meanwhile, when the mobile subscriber station transmits the<br>
MOBHOIND message to the serving base station, it is possible to generate and<br>
transmit the MOBHORSP message having the form as shown in Table 17.<br>
That is, the mobile subscriber station can select the type of the MOB_HO_IND<br>
message and transmit the selected type of MOBHOIND message. Herein,<br>
since the MOBHOIND message is a message transmitted when the mobile<br>
subscriber station cannot reject or cancel a handover, it is preferred that the value<br>
of the 'HO Indicator Type' field described in Table 17 is set to be 00 and then the<br>
MOBHOIND message is transmitted. Herein, a case in which the value of the<br>
'HO Indicator Type' field is set to be 00 is a case in which the mobile subscriber<br>
station releases a link with the serving base station and performs a normal<br>
handover procedure.<br>
Hereinafter, a case in which the mobile subscriber station rejects or<br>
cancels a handover being performed will be described with reference to FIGS. 9<br>
and 10.<br>
Herein, cancellation of the handover represents a case in which the<br>
mobile subscriber station randomly stops the handover procedure before the<br>
serving base station selects target base stations and transmits a MOBHORSP<br>
message to the mobile subscriber station, that is, the mobile subscriber station<br>
receives the handover response message including the list of the target base<br>
stations, in performing the handover. Further, the rejection of the handover<br>
represents a case in which the mobile subscriber station randomly stops a<br>
determined handover procedure after the serving base station selects target base<br>
stations and transmits a MOBHORSP message to the mobile subscriber station,<br>
that is, the mobile subscriber station receives the handover response message<br>
including the list of the target base stations, in performing the handover.<br>
First, a case in which the mobile subscriber station cancels a handover<br><br>
being performed will be described with reference to FIG. 9, and then a case in<br>
which the mobile subscriber station rejects a determined handover will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating a procedure by which a mobile<br>
subscriber station cancels a handover in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the mobile subscriber station 900 receives<br>
information on neighbor base stations from a serving base station 940 in step 911<br>
and determines whether to perform a scanning or not in steps 913 and 915.<br>
Then, the mobile subscriber station 900 scans the CINRs of the neighbor base<br>
stations in step 917, determines the change of the serving base station 940 in step<br>
919, and transmits a MOB_HO_REQ message to the serving base station 940 in<br>
step 921. Herein, the serving base station 940 refers to the received<br>
MOB_HO_REQ message in step 923 and transmits HOnotification messages to<br>
corresponding recommended base stations in steps 925 and 927. Therefore, a<br>
handover procedure is performed. Next, in step 925, the recommended base<br>
stations having received the HO_notification messages transmit<br>
HO_notificationresponse messages containing information regarding whether or<br>
not the recommended base stations can perform the handover procedure to the<br>
serving base station 940 in step 928. Then, the serving base station 940 having<br>
received the HO_notificationresponse messages determines a base station to<br>
which the mobile subscriber station 900 is to be handed over to, of the<br>
recommended base stations having sent the response messages, and transmits a<br>
HO_notificationconfirm message to the determined base station in steps 931 and<br>
933, thereby causing the determined base station to prepare the handover so that<br>
the mobile subscriber station 900 can be handed over to the determined base<br>
station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the mobile subscriber station 900 intends to cancel the<br>
handover while the handover procedure is performed, the mobile subscriber<br>
station 900 determines to cancel the handover in step 929. Then, the mobile<br>
subscriber station 900 transmits the MOBHOIND message containing cancel<br>
determination information (i.e., the value of HO indicator type is set to be 01) to<br>
the serving base station 940 in step 932, thereby canceling the handover<br>
procedure being performed in step 934.<br>
Herein, a method for including the cancel determination information into<br>
the MOB_HO_IND message can be achieved by adding the 'HO indicator type'<br>
field as described in Table 17. That is, the serving base station 940 receives the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message transmitted from the mobile subscriber station 900 in<br>
step 932, confirms the information of the 'HO indicator type' field added to the<br><br>
message, and recognizes that the MOB_HO_IND message is a message reporting<br>
the cancel of the handover.<br>
For instance, the 'HO indicator type' field may include two bits and has a<br>
value of 01 as described above, thereby signifying that the MOB_HO_IND<br>
message is a cancel message. Then, the serving base station 940 having<br>
received the MOB_HO_IND message containing the handover cancel message<br>
information stops the handover procedure being performed and continuously<br>
maintains a link with the mobile subscriber station 900 in step 934.<br>
Herein, the procedure is classified according to a case (step 931) in which<br>
the MOB_HO_IND message reporting the cancel of the handover is received by<br>
the serving base station 940 after the HOnotificationconfirm message has been<br>
transmitted from the serving base station 940 to a target base station, and a case<br>
(step 933) in which the MOB_HO_IND message reporting the cancel of the<br>
handover is received by the serving base station 940 before the<br>
HOnotificationconfirm message is transmitted from the serving base station<br>
940 to the target base station.<br>
That is, after transmitting the HOnotification message to the target base<br>
station (step 927) and then receiving the HO_notification_response message from<br>
the target base station (step 928), the serving base station 940 selects a target base<br>
station to which the mobile subscriber station 900 can be actually handed over.<br>
Herein, when the serving base station 940 determines the target base station to<br>
which the mobile subscriber station 900 can be actually handed over, the serving<br>
base station 940 transmits the HO_notification_confirm message to the selected<br>
corresponding target base station (step 931), thereby enabling the corresponding<br>
target base station to prepare the handover so that the mobile subscriber station<br>
900 can be handed over to the corresponding target base station.<br>
However, when the mobile subscriber station 900 transmits the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message in order to report the cancelation of the handover before<br>
the HO_notification_confirm message is transmitted from the serving base station<br>
940 to the target base station (step 933), the serving base station 940 performs a<br>
different operation. Hereinafter, this operation will be described in detail.<br>
That is, when the MOB_HO_IND message reaches the serving base<br>
station 940 (step 932) before the serving base station 940 transmits the<br>
HOnotificationconfirm message to the target base station (step 933), the<br>
serving base station 940 cancels every handover procedure (step 934).<br>
Accordingly, the handover is cancelled.<br>
In contrast, a case in which the MOB_HO_IND message is transmitted to<br>
the serving base station 940 (step 932) after the transmission of the<br>
HO_notification_confirm message (step 931) is a case in which the serving base<br><br>
station 940 has already transmitted the HO_notification_confirm message to the<br>
target base station (step 931) and has reported the handover. Accordingly, on<br>
receiving the MOB_HO_IND message from the mobile subscriber station 900,<br>
the serving base station 940 must transmit the message to the corresponding target<br>
base station again to report the cancellationof the handover.<br>
Herein, since the HOnotificationconfirm message transmitted from the<br>
serving base station 940 to the target base station is used in both a case for<br>
reporting the performance of a normal handover and a case for reporting the<br>
cancellation of the handover, the two cases are distinguished by the 'Confirm<br>
type' field as shown in Table 18. Herein, the 'Confirm type' field has a length of<br>
1 bit. Accordingly, when the 'Confirm type' field has a value of 0, the<br>
HO_notification_confirm message reports the performance of a normal handover.<br>
In contrast, when the 'Confirm type' field has a value of 1, the<br>
HOnotificationconfirm message reports the cancel of the handover.<br>
Further, a case in which the handover is cancelled is a case in which a<br>
handover procedure has been performed as a result of the mobile subscriber<br>
station 900 going away from the serving base station 940 and approaching one of<br>
neighbor base stations, but the mobile subscriber station 900 must be handed over<br>
to the serving base station 940 again as a result of the mobile subscriber station<br>
900 approaching the original serving base station 940 again during the<br>
performance of the handover procedure.<br>
Herein, according to the prior art, after being handed over to a neighbor<br>
base station, a mobile subscriber station must be handed over to an original<br>
serving base station again. Further, in a special situation, there may occur a case<br>
which such a handover must be performed continuously and repeatedly.<br>
However, according to the present invention, an unnecessary handover is not<br>
repeated and a connection with a serving base station can be continuously<br>
maintained.<br>
Hereinafter, a case in which the mobile subscriber station rejects a<br>
determined handover will be described with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure by which a mobile<br>
subscriber station rejects a handover in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the mobile subscriber station 1000 receives<br>
information on neighbor base stations from a serving base station 1040 in step<br>
1011 and determines whether to perform a scanning or not in steps 1013 and 1015.<br>
Then, the mobile subscriber station 1000 scans the CINRs of the neighbor base<br>
stations in step 1017, determines the change of the serving base station 1040 in<br>
step 1019, and transmits a MOB_HO_ REQ message to the serving base station<br><br>
1040 in step 1021. Then, the serving base station 1040 refers to the received<br>
MOB_HO_REQ message in step 1023 and transmits HOnotification messages<br>
to corresponding recommended base stations in steps 1025 and 1027.<br>
Meanwhile, the serving base station 1040 receives HO_notification_response<br>
messages from the corresponding recommended base stations, selects target base<br>
stations according to the message reception result, and transmits a<br>
MOBHORSP message to the mobile subscriber station 1000 in step 1035.<br>
Therefore, a handover is determined.<br>
That is, a procedure for steps 1011, 1013, 1015, 1017, 1019, 1021, 1023,<br>
1025, 1027, 1029, 1031, 1033, and 1035 in FIG. 10 is identical to that for steps<br>
611, 613, 615, 617, 619, 621, 623, 625, 627, 629, 631, 633, and 635 in FIG.<br>
6,respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, after the target base stations to which the mobile subscriber<br>
station 1000 can be handed over are determined and the mobile subscriber station<br>
1000 receives the MOBHORSP message from the serving base station 1040,<br>
when the mobile subscriber station 1000 intends to reject the determined<br>
handover, the mobile subscriber station 1000 determines a handover rejection in<br>
step 1037 and transmits MOB_HO_IND message containing rejection<br>
determination information to the serving base station 1040, thereby rejecting the<br>
determined handover.<br>
Herein, a method for including the rejection determination information<br>
into the MOB_HO_IND message can be achieved by adding the 'HO indicator<br>
type' field as described in Table 17. That is, the serving base station 1040<br>
having received the MOB_HO_IND message confirms the information of the<br>
'HO indicator type' field added to the message, and recognizes that the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message is a message reporting the rejection of the handover.<br>
For instance, the 'HO indicator type' field may include two bits and has a<br>
value of 01 as described above, thereby signifying that the MOB_HO_IND<br>
message is a rejection message. Then, the serving base station 1040 having<br>
received the MOB_HO_IND message containing the handover rejection message<br>
information stops the determined handover procedure and continuously maintains<br>
a link with the mobile subscriber station 1000 in step 1041. Herein, since the<br>
serving base station 1040 has already selected the target base stations and has<br>
transmitted HOnotificationconfirmation messages to the target base stations,<br>
the target base stations judges that the mobile subscriber station 1000 performs<br>
the handover procedure. Accordingly, it is preferred that the serving base station<br>
1040 notifies the target base stations of the stop of the handover.<br>
Meanwhile, a case in which the handover is rejected is a case in which<br>
the mobile subscriber station 1000 has received a HORSP message from the<br><br>
serving base station 1040, but does not select a proper target base station because<br>
there is no base station satisfying a predetermined condition from among the<br>
target base stations contained in the message. That is, since the mobile<br>
subscriber station 1000 cannot be handed over to any base station of the target<br>
base stations contained in the message transmitted from the serving base station<br>
1040, it is preferred that the mobile subscriber station 1000 rejects the handover.<br>
In the above description, a transmission procedure of messages<br>
exchanged between a mobile subscriber station and base stations in performing a<br>
procedure of a forced handover, a cancel procedure of a handover, and a rejection<br>
procedure of a handover performed in various circumstances according to the<br>
present invention has been described.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure performed by the mobile subscriber station<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 11 and 14.<br>
1. Handover Forced By A Base Station<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure by which a base station<br>
forces a handover in a broadband wireless access communication system<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, as described above, a mobile subscriber station<br>
receives a MOB_HO_RSP message from a serving base station while a handover<br>
procedure is performed in step 1100. Herein, the MOB_HO_RSP message<br>
contains the lists of target base stations selected by the serving base station.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile subscriber station confirms the lists of the target base<br>
stations through the MOB_HO_RSP message and determines one base station to<br>
be a designated target base station in step 1103.<br>
Further, as described in FIG. 8 according to the present invention, when<br>
the 'HO Type' field of the MOB_HO_RSP message has been set to have a value<br>
of 1 in step 1105, the MOB_HO_RSP message becomes a message signifying that<br>
the serving base station forces the mobile subscriber station to be inevitably<br>
handed over to the target base stations. Accordingly, the mobile subscriber<br>
station does not reject the determined handover procedure and transmits a<br>
MOB_HO_IND message in step 1109. Further, the mobile subscriber station<br>
releases a connection with the serving base station in step 1111.<br>
In contrast, when the 'HO Type' field of the MOB_HO_RSP message has<br>
been set to have a value of 0, since the MOB_HO_RSP message is not a message<br>
representing a forced handover, the mobile subscriber station can reject the<br>
handover according to its own judgment. Accordingly, when the mobile<br>
subscriber station rejects the handover instead of being handed over to the target<br><br>
base stations in step 1113, the mobile subscriber station sets the 'HO indicator<br>
type' field constituting the MOB_HO_IND message to have a value of 10 and<br>
transmits the MOB_HO_IND message in step 1115 as described above. In<br>
contrast, when the mobile subscriber station is normally handed over to the target<br>
base stations, the mobile subscriber station sets the 'HO indicator type' field to<br>
have a value of 00, transmits the MOB_HO_IND message to the serving base<br>
station in step 1109, and releases a connection with the serving base station in<br>
step 1111.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure by which a mobile subscriber station cancels or<br>
rejects a handover according to predetermined conditions during the handover<br>
will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 12 and 14.<br>
2. The Cancellation and Rejection of a Handover According to a Threshold Value.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure by which a mobile<br>
subscriber station cancels or rejects a handover in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the mobile subscriber station compares the CINR of<br>
a serving base station with a predetermined threshold value and determined<br>
whether to perform a handover procedure or not. Further, while performing the<br>
handover procedure, the mobile subscriber station determines to cancel the<br>
handover by means of a second threshold value different from the first threshold<br>
value.<br>
First, the mobile subscriber station scans the CINR of the serving base<br>
station in step 1200. As a result of the scanning, when the CINR of the serving<br>
base station is smaller than a first predetermined threshold value, the mobile<br>
subscriber station determines that it is difficult to exchange data with the serving<br>
base station, and measures the CINRs of neighbor base stations in step 1211.<br>
That is, in order to scan the CINRs of the neighbor base stations, the mobile<br>
subscriber station transmits a MOB_SCN_REQ message to the serving base<br>
station in step 1207 and receives a MOB_SCN_RSP message from the serving<br>
base station in step 1209.<br>
The mobile subscriber station having received the MOBSCNRSP<br>
message measures the CINRs of the neighbor base stations in step 1211. As a<br>
result of the measurement, when the CINR of the serving base station is smaller<br>
than a second predetermined threshold value and the CINR of one of the neighbor<br>
base stations in step 1213, the mobile subscriber station determines a handover<br>
and transmits a MOB_HO_REQ message to the serving base station in step 1215.<br>
In contrast, when such a condition is not satisfied, returns to step 1200. That is, .<br><br>
the mobile subscriber station repeats the aforementioned procedure.<br>
Meanwhile, while the MOB_HO_REQ message is transmitted to the<br>
serving base station and the handover procedure is performed according to the<br>
present invention, the mobile subscriber station continuously measures the CINR<br>
of the serving base station and compares the CINR of the serving base station<br>
with the first critical value. As a result of the comparison, when the CINR of the<br>
serving base station is still smaller than the first threshold value, the handover<br>
procedure is normally performed. In contrast, when the CINR of the serving<br>
base station grows larger than the first threshold value due to the movement of the<br>
mobile subscriber station in step 1217, the mobile subscriber station cancels the<br>
handover procedure being performed in step 1219. Accordingly, when the<br>
mobile subscriber station determines to cancel the handover procedure in this way,<br>
the mobile subscriber station transmits a MOB_HO_IND message (i.e., the value<br>
of the 'HO Indicator Type' field is set to be 01) containing handover cancel<br>
information to the serving base station in step 1221. Then, the serving base<br>
station having received the MOB_HO_IND message cancels the handover<br>
procedure and continuously maintains a connection with the mobile subscriber<br>
station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the CINR of the serving base station is still smaller<br>
than the first threshold value during the performance of the handover as described<br>
above, the serving base station normally performs the handover procedure and<br>
transmits a MOB_HO_RSP message to the mobile subscriber station. Next, the<br>
mobile subscriber station having received the MOB_HO_RSP message from the<br>
serving base station in step 1223 confirms a list of target base stations contained<br>
in the MOB_HO_RSP message, determines one target base station to be a<br>
designated target base station according to conditions in step 1225.<br>
Herein, when the MOB_HO_RSP message is a forced handover message,<br>
that is, when the 'HO Type' field contained in the MOB_HO_RSP message has<br>
been set to have a value of 1, a forced handover is performed according to the<br>
procedure described in FIG. 11. In other words, the mobile subscriber station<br>
transmits the MOB_HO_IND message in step 1237 and release a connection with<br>
the serving base station in step 1239. Further, the mobile subscriber station is<br>
handed over to one base station contained in the list of the target base stations<br>
transmitted from the serving base station.<br>
In contrast, when the MOB_HO_RSP message is not the forced handover<br>
message, that is, when the 'HO Type' field contained in the MOB_HO_RSP<br>
message has been set to have a value of 0, it is possible to continuously measure<br>
the CINR of the serving base station according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. That is, when the CINR of the serving base station is larger<br><br>
than the first threshold value in step 1229, the handover can be cancelled in step<br>
1219. Otherwise, the handover can be normally performed. In contrast, when<br>
the CINR of the serving base station is still smaller than the first threshold value,<br>
whether to perform a normal handover procedure to the target base station or not<br>
is determined in step 1231. From the result of the determination, the handover is<br>
rejected in step 1233 or the handover is performed in steps 1237 and 1239.<br>
3. Cancel and Rejection of a Handover According to the Comparison of CINRs<br>
FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure by which a mobile<br>
subscriber station cancels or rejects a handover in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 13 performs<br>
the same procedure as that of the second embodiment of FIG. 12, but a difference<br>
exists in reference values in performing the determination of the handover and the<br>
determination of the handover cancellation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the mobile subscriber station compares the CINR of<br>
a serving base station with a predetermined threshold value and determined<br>
whether to perform a handover procedure or not. Further, while performing the<br>
handover procedure, the mobile subscriber station determines the handover or the<br>
cancellation of the handover by means of another threshold value different from<br>
the threshold value.<br>
First, the mobile subscriber station scans the CINR of the serving base<br>
station in step 1300. As a result of the scanning, when the CINR of the serving<br>
base station is smaller than a predetermined threshold value, the mobile<br>
subscriber station determines that it is difficult to exchange data with the serving<br>
base station, and measures the CINR of neighbor base stations in step 1311.<br>
That is, in order to scan the CINR of the neighbor base stations, the mobile<br>
subscriber station transmits a MOBSCNREQ message to the serving base<br>
station in step 1307 and receives a MOBSCNRSP message from the serving<br>
base station in step 1309.<br>
The mobile subscriber station having received the MOB_SCN_RSP<br>
message measures the CINR of the neighbor base stations in step 1310. As a<br>
result of the measurement, when the CINR of the serving base station is smaller<br>
than the CINR of one of the neighbor base stations in step 1311, the mobile<br>
subscriber station determines a handover and transmits a MOB_HO_REQ<br>
message to the serving base station in step 1312. In contrast, when such a<br>
condition is not satisfied, returns to step 1300. That is, the mobile subscriber<br>
station repeats the aforementioned procedure.<br>
Meanwhile, while the MOB_HO_REQ message is transmitted to the<br><br>
serving base station and the handover procedure is performed according to the<br>
present invention, the mobile subscriber station continuously measures the CINR<br>
of the serving base station and compares the CINR of the serving base station<br>
with the CINR of the neighbor base stations. As a result of the comparison,<br>
when the CINR of the serving base station is still smaller than the CINR of the<br>
neighbor base stations, the handover procedure is normally performed. In<br>
contrast, when the CINR of the serving base station grows larger than the CINR<br>
of the neighbor base stations due to the movement of the mobile subscriber<br>
station in step 1313, the mobile subscriber station cancels the handover procedure<br>
being performed in step 1315. Accordingly, when the mobile subscriber station<br>
determines to cancel the handover procedure in this way, the mobile subscriber<br>
station transmits a MOB_HO_IND message (i.e., the value of the 'HO Indicator<br>
Type' field is set to be 01) containing handover cancel information to the serving<br>
base station in step 1317. Then, the serving base station having received the<br>
MOB_HO_IND message cancels the handover procedure and continuously<br>
maintains a connection with the mobile subscriber station.<br>
Meanwhile, when the CINR of the serving base station is still smaller<br>
than the CINR of the neighbor base stations during the performance of the<br>
handover, the serving base station normally performs the handover procedure and<br>
transmits a MOB_HO_RSP message to the mobile subscriber station. Next, the<br>
mobile subscriber station having received the MOB_HO_RSP message from the<br>
serving base station in step 1319 confirms a list of target base stations contained<br>
in the MOB_HO_RSP message, determines one target base station to be a<br>
designated target base station according to conditions in step 1321.<br>
Herein, when the MOB_HO_RSP message is a forced handover message,<br>
that is, when the 'HO Type' field contained in the MOB_HO_RSP message has<br>
been set to have a value of 1, a forced handover is performed according to the<br>
procedure described in FIG. 11. In other words, the mobile subscriber station<br>
transmits the MOB_HO_IND message in step 1333 and releases a connection<br>
with the serving base station in step 1335. Further, the mobile subscriber station<br>
is handed over to one base station contained in the list of the target base stations<br>
transmitted from the serving base station.<br>
In contrast, when the MOB_HO_RSP message is not the forced handover<br>
message, that is, when the 'HO Type' field contained in the MOB_HO_RSP<br>
message has been set to have a value of 0, it is possible to continuously measure<br>
the CINR of the serving base station according to the third embodiment of the<br>
present invention. That is, when the CINR of the serving base station is larger<br>
than the CINR of the neighbor base stations in step 1325, the handover can be<br>
cancelled in step 1315. Otherwise, the handover can be normally performed.<br><br>
In contrast, when the CINR of the serving base station is still smaller than the<br>
CINR of the neighbor base stations, whether to perform a normal handover<br>
procedure to the target base station or not, is determined in step 1327. From the<br>
result of the determination, the handover is rejected in step 1329 or the handover<br>
is performed in steps 1333 and 1335.<br>
As describe above, when the handover has been rejected according to the<br>
circumstances of the mobile subscriber station in step 1331, the mobile subscriber<br>
station transmits a MOB_HO_REQ message to the serving base station again in<br>
step 1312. That is, a case in which the handover is rejected is a case in which<br>
the mobile subscriber station has tried to be handed over to the neighbor base<br>
station because the serving base station has bad transmission/reception conditions,<br>
but the handover is rejected because the neighbor base station also has bad<br>
transmission/reception conditions. Herein, since the serving base station may<br>
continuously have the bad transmission/reception conditions, it is preferred to<br>
transmit a MOB_HO_REQ message to the serving base station again (step 1312)<br>
and find target base stations.<br>
However, since the reliability for recommended base stations contained in<br>
the MOB_HO_REQ message and selected by the mobile subscriber station may<br>
be reduced, it may be preferred to scan all neighbor base stations one more time<br>
and to find new recommended base stations having a high reliability.<br>
Hereinafter, the latter case will be described with reference to FIG. 14.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure by which a mobile<br>
subscriber station cancels or rejects a handover in a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, the third embodiment of FIG. 14 has the same<br>
procedure as that of the second embodiment of FIG. 13, except for the<br>
aforementioned difference. That is, when the mobile subscriber station rejects<br>
the handover in step 1429, the mobile subscriber station transmits a<br>
MOB_HO_IND message (i.e., the value of the 'HO Indicator Type' field is set to<br>
be 10) representing a handover rejection to the serving base station in step 1431.<br>
Then, the mobile subscriber station performs an initial scanning in step<br>
1400 in order to select new recommended base stations. That is, the mobile<br>
subscriber station measure the CINR of the serving base station again, compares<br>
the measured CINR of the serving base station with a predetermined threshold<br>
value set in advance in step 1403, and performs a scanning for neighbor base<br>
stations again in steps 1407, 1409, and 1410. All steps after step 1411 are<br>
identical to those of FIG. 13.<br>
As described above, in order to support the mobility of a mobile<br>
subscriber station, the present invention further incorporates a function by which<br><br>
a base station enables a mobile subscriber station to be forcedly handed over and<br>
a function by which a mobile subscriber station rejects a handover request<br>
received from a base station to the conventional handover procedure in a multi-<br>
cell structure. In addition, the present invention further incorporates a function<br>
by which a base station enables a mobile subscriber station cancels or rejects a<br>
handover procedure to maintain a connection with a serving base station again<br>
due to the change of the moving direction of the mobile subscriber station while<br>
the mobile subscriber station is being handed over from the serving base station to<br>
a target base station. Therefore, a handover can be performed with certainty and<br>
efficiency.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
