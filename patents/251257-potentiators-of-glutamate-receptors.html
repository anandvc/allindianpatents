POTENTIATORS OF GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U. S. provisional application Ser. No.<br>
60/630,060 filed Nov. 22, 2004.<br>
The present invention provides a compound of formula I, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof, and methods of using the same, as well as processes for preparing<br>
the same, and intermediates thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The excitatory amino acid L-glutamate (at times referred to herein simply as<br>
glutamate) through its many receptors mediates most of the excitatory neurotransmission<br>
within the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and has been implicated in<br>
numerous peripheral nervous system (PNS) pathways. The excitatory amino acids,<br>
including glutamate, are of great physiological importance, playing a role in a variety of<br>
neurological, physiological and psychiatric processes, such as synaptic plasticity, motor<br>
control, respiration, cardiovascular regulation, sensory perception, and emotional<br>
responses.<br>
Glutamate acts via at least two distinct classes of receptors. One class is<br>
composed of the ionotropic glutamate (iGlu) receptors that act as ligand-gated ion<br>
channels. Via activation of the iGlu receptors, glutamate is thought to regulate fast<br>
neuronal transmission within the synapse of two connecting neurons in the CNS. The<br>
second general type of receptor is the G-protein or second messenger-linked<br>
"metabotropic" glutamate (mGlu) receptor. Both types of receptors appear not only to<br>
mediate normal synaptic transmission along excitatory pathways, but also participate in<br>
the modification of synaptic connections during development and throughout life.<br>
Schoepp, Bockaert, and Sladeczek, Trends in Pharmacol. Sci., 11, 508 (1990); McDonald<br>
and Johnson, Brain Research Reviews, 15, 41 (1990).<br>
The mGlu receptors belong to the Class C G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)<br>
family. This family of GPCR's, including the calcium-sensing receptors, GABAB<br>
receptors and sensory receptors, are unique in that effectors bind to the amino-terminus<br>
portion of the receptor protein translating a signal via the transmembrane segments to the<br>
intracellular matrix through receptor/G-protein interactions. Ozawa, Kamiya and<br>
Tsuzuski, Prog. Neurobio., 54, 581 (1998). It has been demonstrated that the receptors<br>
are localized either pre- and/or post-synapticly where they can regulate neurotransmitter<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
3<br>
release, either glutamate or other neurotransmitters, or modulate the post-synaptic<br>
response of neurotransmitters, respectively.<br>
At present, there are eight mGlu receptors that have been positively identified,<br>
cloned, and their sequences reported. These are further subdivided based on their amino<br>
acid sequence homology, their ability to effect certain signal transduction mechanisms,<br>
and their known pharmacological properties. Ozawa, Kamiya and Tsuzuski, Prog.<br>
Neurobio., 54, 581 (1998). For instance, the Group I mGlu receptors, which include the<br>
mGlul and mGlu5, are known to activate phospholipase C (PLC) via Gaq-proteins<br>
thereby resulting in the increased hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and intracellular<br>
calcium mobilization. There are several compounds that are reported to activate the<br>
Group I mGlu receptors including DHPG, (+/-)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycme. Schoepp,<br>
Goldworthy, Johnson, Salhoff and Baker, J. Neurochem., 63, 769 (1994); Ito, et al.,<br>
Neurorep., 3, 1013 (1992). The Group II mGlu receptors consist of the two distinct<br>
receptors, mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors. Both receptors are negatively coupled to<br>
adenylate cyclase via activation of God-protein. These receptors can be activated by a<br>
group-selective compound such as (lS,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminohicalo[3.1.0] hexane -2,6-<br>
dicarboxylate. Monn, et al., J. Mod. Chem., 40, 528 . hoepp, et al.,<br>
Neuropharmacol., 36, 1 (1997). Similarly, the Group III mGlu receptors, including<br>
mGlu4, mGlu6, mGlu7 and mGlu8, are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gai<br>
and are potently activated by L-AP4 (L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonoburyric acid). Schoepp,<br>
Neurochem. Int., 24,439 (1994).<br>
It should be noted that many of the available pharmacological tools are not ideal<br>
in that they cross react not only on the receptors within a group of mGlu receptors but<br>
also often have some activity between groups of mGlu receptors. For instance,<br>
compounds such as 1S,3R-ACPD, (lS,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid, are believed to activate all of the Group I, II and III mGlu receptors depending upon<br>
the dose utilized while others, such as 1S,3S-ACPD, (lS,3S)-l-aminocyclopentane-<br>
trans-l,3-dicarboxylic acid, are more selective for the Group II receptors (mGlu2/3) than<br>
the Group I (mGlul/5) or Group III (mGlu4/6/7/8). Schoepp, Neurochem. Int., 24,439<br>
(1994). To date, there are very few examples of selective agents for the mGlu receptors.<br>
Schoepp, Jane, and Monn. Neuropharmacol., 38, 1431 (1999).<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>

It has become increasingly clear that there is a link between modulation of<br>
excitatory amino acid receptors, including the glutamatergic system, through changes in<br>
glutamate release or alteration in postsynaptic receptor activation, and a variety of<br>
neurological, psychiatric and neuroinflamrnatory disorders, e.g. Monaghan, Bridges and<br>
Cotman, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 29, 365-402 (1989); Schoepp and Sacann,<br>
Neurobio. Aging, 15,261-263 (1994); Meldrum and Garthwaite, Tr. Phannacol. Sci., 11,<br>
379-387 (1990). The medical consequences of such glutamate dysfunction make the<br>
abatement of these neurological processes an important therapeutic goal.<br>
Leukotrienes are potent local mediators, playing a major role in inflammatory and<br>
allergic responses including arthritis, asthma, psoriasis, and thrombotic disease.<br>
Leukotrienes are straight chain eicosanoids produced by the oxidation of arachidonic acid<br>
by lipoxygenases in several cell types including: eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells,<br>
leukocytes, and macrophages. At the present time, there are two established Class A<br>
GPCR receptors for the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (CysLTl and CysLT2) which the<br>
leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 activate, mediating their proinflamrnatory effects.<br>
Each of the CysLT receptors has distinct tissue distributions and associations with<br>
physiological responses. Also, the leukotriene LTD4 has a higher affinity for the CysLTl<br>
receptor than the other leukotrienes. Back, M. Life Sciences 71, 611-622, (2002). The<br>
leukotrienes, especially LTD4 and its receptor CysLTl, have been implicated in the<br>
pathogenesis of airway and allergic diseases such as asthma by contributing to<br>
bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and cosinophil migration. Thus, leukotrienes have<br>
been shown to play an important role in the pathology of asthma. Rigorous proof for the<br>
role 6f leukotrienes in asthma has been provided by several pivotal clinical trials in which<br>
orally administered LTD4 receptor antagonists produce clear therapeutic benefit in<br>
asthma patients. These benefits include reduction in the use of classic asthma therapies<br>
such as corticosteroids. Kemp, J.P., Amer. J. Resp. Medi. 2, 139-156, (2003).<br>
Numerous investigations confirm the importance of the leukotrienes in allergic<br>
disorders as well. Thus, after allergen provocation, a marked increase in the LT<br>
concentration in the nasal lavage fluid of patients with allergic rhinitis was detected both<br>
in the early phase and in the late phase. Creticos, P.S., S.P. Peters, N.F. Adkinson, R.M.<br>
Naclerio, E.C. Hayes, P.S. Norman, L.M. Lichtenstein, N. Eng. J. Med. 310:1626 (1984).<br>
In addition, treatment with clinically efficacious antihistamines, such as azelastine, has<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
5<br>
shown a reduction in the formation of the cysteinyl-leukotrines, establishing a correlative<br>
relationship of allergic reaction symptoms to the degree of leukotriene formation and,<br>
thus, CysLT receptor activation. Achterrath-Tuckermann, U., Th. Simmet, W. Luck, I.<br>

The present invention provides compounds of formula I that are potentiators of the<br>
mGlu2 receptor and antagonists of the CysLTl receptor. As such, compounds of formula<br>
I would provide a means to treat disorders associated with glutamate or leukotrienes. In<br>
addition, it is anticipated that in disorders with a glutamate and leukotriene component to<br>
the onset, propagation and/or symptoms, the compounds of formula I will provide an<br>
effective treatment for the patient. The medical consequences of such glutamate<br>
dysfunction make the abatement of these neurological processes an important therapeutic<br>
goal.<br>

The term "protecting group or Pg," as used herein, refers to those groups intended<br>
to protect or block functional groups against undesirable reactions during synthetic<br>
procedures. In the case of an amino or hydroxyl functional group, the suitable protecting<br>
group used will depend upon the conditions that will be employed in subsequent reaction<br>
steps wherein protection is required. For example, it may be desirable to employ the<br>
protection of multiple functional groups, such as amino and hydroxyl, and control then-<br>
protection and deprotection independently. Commonly used amino and hydroxyl<br>
protecting groups are disclosed in Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene<br>

with sugar, shellac, or other coating agents. A syrup may contain, in addition to the<br>
present compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and<br>
colorings and flavors. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be<br>
pharmaceuticalry'pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
For the purpose of parenteral therapeutic administration, the compounds of the<br>
present invention may be incorporated into a solution or suspension. These preparations<br>
typically contain at least 0.1 % of a compound of the invention, but may be varied to be<br>
between 0.1 and about 90% of the weight thereof. The amount of the compound of<br>
formula I present hi such compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
The solutions or suspensions may also include one or more of the following adjuvants:<br>
sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene<br>
glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such<br>
as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium<br>
bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as<br>
acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium<br>
chloride or dextrose. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable<br>
syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Preferred compositions and<br>
preparations are able to be determined by one skilled hi the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered topically, and<br>
when done so the carrier may suitably comprise a solution, ointment, or gel base. The<br>
base, for example, may comprise one or more of the following: petrolatum, lanolin,<br>
polyethylene glycols, bees wax, mineral oil, diluents such as water and alcohol, and<br>
emulsifiers, and stabilizers. Topical formulations may contain a concentration of the<br>
formula I or its pharmaceutical salt from about 0.1 to about 10% w/v (weight per unit<br>
volume).<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of present invention comprising a compound such as herein<br>
described and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient showed surprising properties.<br>
Therefore, the said composition is synergistic in nature.<br><br>

The compounds of formula I are potentiators of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)<br>
receptor function, in particular they are potentiators of mGlu2 receptors. That is the<br>
compounds of formula I increase mGlu2 receptor response to glutamate or a glutamate<br>
agonist, enhancing the function of the receptors. The behavior of the potentiators of<br>
formula I at mGlu2 receptors is shown in Example A which is suitable to identify<br>
potentiators useful for carrying out the present invention. Thus, the potentiators of the<br>
present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of various neurological and<br>
psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction described to be treated herein<br>
and others that can be treated by such potentiators as are appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
Example A<br>
Potentiation of Glutamate-Induced Increase in Intracellular Calcium with a mGlu2<br>
Expressing Cell Line.<br>
Cell lines expressing human mGlu2 receptors are derived as previously described<br>
(Desai, Burnett, Mayne, Schoepp, Mol. Pharmacol. 48, 648-657,1995) and cultured in<br>
DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,<br>
50 ug/mL Geneticin G418, and 0.2 mg/mL hygromycin B. Confluent cultures are<br>
passaged weekly. These cells are referred to as RGT cells for Rat Glutamate Transporter,<br>
and have been co-transfected with the grutamate/aspartate transporter GLAST. The RGT<br>
cell line expressing the mGlu2 receptors is stably transfected with the promiscuous<br>
G-protein, Galphal5 to change the signaling pathway to the mGlu2 receptor to one that<br>
could be easily measured through release of intracellular calcium. Thus, intracellular<br>
calcium levels are monitored before and after the addition of drugs on a Fluorometric<br>
Imaging Plate Reader (i.e. FLIPR, Molecular Devices). The following buffer is used<br>
throughout as an assay buffer: 10 mM KC1, 138 mM NaCl, 5 mM Ca Cl2,1 mM MgCl2, 4<br>
mM Na H2PO4,10 mM Glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells that had been plated 48<br>
hours prior at a density of 30-40,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate are loaded with a<br>
calcium-sensitive dye for 90 minutes at 25 °C. Fluo-3 (2 mM in DMSO, Molecular<br>
Probes) are mixed with a equal volume of 10% pluronic acid in DMSO, and diluted to 8<br>
uM into the buffer described above containing 10% fetal bovine serum to make the<br>
loading buffer. Following loading of the cells, the loading buffer is removed and replaced<br>
with assay buffer prior to drug addition and monitoring on the FLIPR. The resulting<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
44<br>
signal from the addition of compounds of formula (I) and submaximal concentrations of a<br>
glutamate-site agonist (e.g. 1 uM glutamate) is determined by taking the difference of the<br>
maximal fluorescent peak height minus the background fluorescence in each well and<br>
expressing the results as a percent of the signal seen with a maximal glutamate response<br>
(30 uM glutamate, typically about 30-50,000 Relative Fluorescent Units). Least squares<br>
curve fitting with a four-parameter equation is then applied to the resulting dose-%<br>
response curve to determine the resulting EC50 values.<br>
Exemplified compounds of formula I typically affect the potentiation of mGlu2<br>
receptors with EC50 values less than 12.5 uM. More specifically, examples 47, 65, 81,<br>
82, 83 and 84 affect the potentiation of mGlu2 receptors with EC50 values less than 100<br>
nM.<br>
Compounds of formula I are modulators of leukotriene receptor function, in<br>
particular they are antagonists of leukotriene receptors. That is the compounds of formula<br>
I antagonize the cysteinyl-leukotriene D4 (LTD4) receptor. The behavior of the<br>
antagonism of the cysteinyl-leukotriene D4 (LTD4) receptor by compounds of formula I<br>
is shown in Example B which is suitable to identify antagonists useful for carrying out the<br>
present invention. Thus, the leukotriene antagonists of the present invention are useful in<br>
the treatment of various inflammatory and allergic disorders mediated by leukotrienes and<br>
described to be treated herein and other disorders that can be treated by such antagonists<br>
as are appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Example B<br>
Antagonism of Cysteinyl-leukotriene D4 (LTD4) -Induced Increase in Intracellular<br>
Calcium within a Cysteinyi-Leukotriene 1 (CysLTl) Receptor Expressing Cell Line.<br>
Cell lines expressing the human CysLTl receptor [AVI2-664 (ATCC-9595)] are<br>
derived and maintained in culture media: DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1<br>
mM glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Confluent cultures are passaged weekly.<br>
Intracellular calcium levels are monitored in the CysLTl-expressing cells with the<br>
addition of LTD4, with or without prior exposure to the compounds being tested as<br>
antagonists with a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). The<br>
following buffer is used throughout as an assay buffer: Hanks Buffered Saline Solution<br>
without phenol red (G1BCO), with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4. Cells that had been plated 48<br>
hours prior at a density of 20-25,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate are loaded with a<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	,	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
45<br>
calcium-sensitive dye for 90 minutes at 25 °C. Fluo-3 (2 mM in DMSO, Molecular<br>
Probes) is mixed with an equal volume of 10% pluronic acid in DMSO, and diluted to 8<br>
M in the buffer described above containing 10% fetal bovine serum to make the loading<br>
buffer. Following loading of the cells, the buffer is removed and replaced with assay<br>
buffer prior to drug addition and monitoring on the FLIPR for several minutes. The<br>
resulting signal from the addition of 6 nM LTD4 (provides approximately 90% of the<br>
maximal signal with 25 nM LTD4) is determined by taking the difference of the maximal<br>
fluorescent peak height minus the background fluorescence in each well and expressing<br>
the results as a percent of the signal seen without pretreatment of the test compound(s).<br>
Least squares curve fitting with a four-parameter equation is applied to the resulting dose-<br>
% inhibition curve to determine the resulting IC50 values.<br>
Exemplified compounds of formula I typically affect the antagonism of CysLTl<br>
receptors with IC50 values less than 12.5 uM. More]specifically, examples 47, 60, 65, 81,<br>
82, 83 and 84 affect the antagonism of CysLTl receptors with IC50 values less than 750<br>
nM.<br>

At present, the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br>
Disorders (DSM-IY™) (1994, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C.),<br>
provides a diagnostic tool for identifying many of the disorders described herein. The<br>

classification systems for neurological and psychiatric disorders described herein and that<br>
these systems evolve with medical scientific progress.<br>
The compounds of formula 1 potentiate mGlu receptor response, in particular<br>
mGlu2 receptor response, to glutamate and glutamate agonists. Such agonists are easily<br>
recognized and some are available in the art. Schoepp, D.D., Jane, D.E., Monn, J.A.,<br>
Neuropharmacology 38: 1431-1476, (1999).<br>
Thus, a more particular embodiment, it is understood that the present invention<br>
extends to a method of potentiating the action of a glutamate receptor agonist at the<br>
Group II mGlu receptors, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an<br>
effective amount of a mGlu2 potentiator, in particular a compound of formula I, in<br>
combination with a potentiated amount of an mGlu receptor agonist. Such a combination<br>
may be advantageous in that it may augment the activity and selectivity of mGlu agonist.<br>
As used herein, the term "patient" refers to a warm blooded animal such as a<br>
mammal which is afflicted with one or more neurological and psychiatric disorders<br>
associated with glutamate dysfunction. It is understood that guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats,<br>
mice, horses, cattle, sheep, and humans, particularly humans, are examples of animals<br>
within the scope of the meaning of the term. It is also understood that this invention<br>
relates specifically to the potentiation of mammalian metabotropic glutamate receptors.<br>
It is also recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the neurological and<br>
psychiatric disorders by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders or by<br>
prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with the disorders with an effective amount of<br>
the compound of formula I. Thus, the terms "treatment" and "treating" are intended to<br>
refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling,<br>
or stopping of the progression of the neurological and psychiatric disorders described<br>
herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disorder symptoms, and<br>
is intended to include prophylactic treatment of such neurological and psychiatric<br>
disorders.<br>
As used herein, the term "effective amount" of a compound of formula I refers to<br>
an amount, that is, the dosage which is effective in treating the neurological and<br>
psychiatric disorders described herein.<br>
The attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, can readily determine an<br>
effective amount by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
under analogous circumstances. In determining an effective amount, the dose of a<br>
compound of formula I, a number of factors are considered by the attending<br>
diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the compound of formula I to be<br>
administered; the co-administration of an mGlu agonist, if used; the species of mammal;<br>
its size, age, and general health; the specific disorder involved; the degree of involvement<br>
or the severity of the disorder; the response of the individual patient; the mode of<br>
administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the<br>
dose regimen selected; the use of other concomitant medication; and other relevant<br>
circumstances.<br>
An effective amount of a compound of formula I is expected to vary from about<br>
0.01 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
Preferred amounts may be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
As used herein, the term "potentiated amount" refers to an amount of an mGlu<br>
agonist, that is, the dosage of agonist which is effective in treating the neurological and<br>
psychiatric disorders described herein when administered in combination with an<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula I. A potentiated amount is expected to be<br>
less than the amount that is required to provided the same effect when the mGlu agonist is<br>
administered without an effective amount of a compound of formula I.<br>
The attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, can readily determine a<br>
potentiated amount by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results<br>
obtained under analogous circumstances, In determining a potentiated amount, the dose<br>

general health; the specific disorder involved; the degree of involvement or the severity of<br>
the disorder; the response of the individual patient; the modes of administration; the<br>
bioavailability characteristics of the preparations administered; the dose regimens<br>
selected; the use of other concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.<br>
A potentiated amount of an mGlu agonist to be administered in combination with<br>
an effective amount of a compound of formula I is expected to vary from about 0.1<br>
milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day and<br><br>

is expected to be less than the amount that is required to provided the same effect when<br>
administered without an effective amount of a compound of formula I. Preferred amounts<br>
. of a co-administered mGlu agonist are able to be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
Of the neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate<br>
dysfunction which are treated according to the present invention, the treatment of<br>
migraine, anxiety, schizophrenia, and epilepsy are particularly preferred. Particularly<br>
preferred anxiety disorders are generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive<br>
compulsive disorder.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment the present; invention provides a method of<br>
treating migraine, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
In one of the available sources of diagnostic tools, Borland's Medical Dictionary<br>
(23rd Ed., 1982, W. B. Saunders Company, Philidelphia, PA), migraine is defined as a<br>
symptom complex of periodic headaches, usually temporal and unilateral, often with<br>
irritability, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and photophobia. As used herein<br>
the term "migraine" includes these periodic headaches, both temporal and unilateral, the<br>
associated irritability, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, photophobia, and other<br>
associated symptoms. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative<br>
nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for neurological and psychiatric<br>
disorders, including migraine, and that these systems evolve with medical scientific<br>
progress.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the present! invention provides a method of<br>
treating anxiety, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
At present, the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br>
Disorders (DSM-FV™) (1994, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C.),<br>
provides a diagnostic tool including anxiety and related disorders. These include: panic<br>
disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder,<br>
specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress<br>
disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to a<br>
general medical condition, substance-induced anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder not<br>
otherwise specified. As used herein the term "anxiety" includes treatment of those<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
50<br>
anxiety disorders and related disorder as described in the DSM-IV. The skilled artisan<br>
will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification<br>
systems for neurological and psychiatric disorders, and particular anxiety, and that these<br>
systems evolve with medical scientific progress. Thus, the term "anxiety" is intended to<br>
include like disorders that are described in other diagnostic sources.<br>
A number of preclinical laboratory animal models for migraine and anxiety have<br>
been described. One commonly used model of migraine is the dural extravasation model<br>
that has been described by Phebus et al., Life Sci., 61(21), 2117-2126 (1997) which can<br>
be used to evaluate the present compounds.<br>
Example C<br>
Animal Model of Dural Plasma Protein Extravasation (PPE).<br>
Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) are anesthetized with sodium<br>
pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments)<br>
with the incisor bar set at -2.5 mm. Following a midline sagital scalp incision, two pairs<br>
of bilateral holes are drilled through the skull (3.2 mm posterially, 1.8 and 3.8 mm<br>
laterally, all coordinates referenced to bregma). Pairs of stainless steel stimulating<br>
electrodes, insulated except at the tips (Rhodes Medical Systems, Inc.), are lowered<br>
through the holes in both hemispheres to a depth of 9.2 mm.<br>
The femoral vein is exposed and a dose of the test compound is injected<br>
intravenously (i.v.) at a dosing volume of 1 mL/kg. Approximately 8 minutes post i.v.<br>
injection, a 20 mg/kg dose of Fluorescein isothiocyanate—bovine serum albumin (FITC-<br>
BSA) is also injected intravenously. The FITC-BSA functions as a marker for protein<br>
extravasation. Exactly 10 minutes post-injection of the test compound, the left trigeminal<br>
ganglion is stimulated for 5 minutes at a current intensity of 1.0 mA (5 Hz, 5 msec<br>
duration) with a Model S48 Grass Instrument Stimulator with PSIU6 photoelectric<br>
isolation unit (Grass-Telefactor).<br>
Alternatively, rats fasted overnight are dosed orally with test compound via<br>
gavage at a volume of 2 mL/kg. Approximately 50 minutes later the animals are<br>
anesthetized and placed in the stereotaxic frame as described above. Exactly 58 minutes<br>
post-p.o. dosing, the animals are dosed with FITC-BSA (20 mg/kg, i.v.). Exactly one<br>
hour post-p.o. dosing, the animals are stimulated as described above.<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
51<br>
Five minutes following stimulation, the animals are killed by exsanguination with<br>
40 mL of saline. The top of the skull is removed to facilitate the collection of the dural<br>
membranes. The membrane samples are removed from both hemispheres, rinsed with<br>
water, and spread flat on microscopic slides. Once dried, the tissues are coverslipped<br>
with a 70% glyceroI/water solution.<br>
A fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a grating monochromator and a<br>
spectrophotometer is used to quantify the amount of FITC-BSA in each sample. An<br>
excitation wavelength of approximately 490 run is utilized and the emission intensity at<br>
535 nm was determined. The microscope is equipped with a motorized stage and also<br>
interfaced with a personal computer. This facilitates the computer-controlled movement<br>
of the stage with fluorescence measurements at 25 points (500 mm steps) on each dural<br>
sample. The mean and standard deviation of the measurements are determined by the<br>
computer.<br>
The extravasation induced by the electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion<br>
is an ipsilateral effect (i.e. occurs only on the side of the in which the trigeminal<br>
ganglion was stimulated). This allows the use of the other (unstimulated) half of the dura<br>
as a control. The ratio of the amount of extravasation in the dura from the stimulated<br>
side, over the amount of extravasation in the unstimulated side, is calculated. Control<br>
animals dosed only with saline, yie)d a ratio of approximately 2.0. In contrast, a<br>
compound which effectively prevented the extravasation in the dura from the stimulated<br>
side would yield a ratio of approximately 1.0.<br>
Examples 60, 65, 83 and 84 affect extravasation in the dura with ID100 values less<br>
than or equal to 0.1 mg/kg p.o.<br>
The fear potentiated startle response model has been extensively used as a model<br>
of anxiety and can be used to evaluate the present compounds. Davis, Psychopharmacol.,<br>
62, 1 (1979); Davis, Behav. Neuroscl, 100, 814 (1986); Davis, Tr. Pharmacol. Sci., 13,<br>
35 (1992).<br>
Example D<br>
Fear Potentiated Startle Paradigm.<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 325-400 g are purchased from Harlan<br>
Sprague-Dawley, Inc. (Cumberland, IN) and given a one week acclimation period before<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
52<br>
testing. Rats are individually housed with food and water ad libitum in an animal room on<br>
a 12-hour light/dark cycle with lights on between 6:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. The test<br>
compound of formula I is prepared in a suspension of 5% ethanol, 0.5% CMC, 0.5%<br>
Tween 80 and 99% water. 2S'-2-amino-2-(lS,2S-2-carboxycyclopropan-l-yl)-3-(xanth-9-<br>
yl) propionic acid is prepared in sterile water. Control rats are given the respective<br>
vehicle.<br>
The fear potentiated startle paradigm is conducted over three consecutive days.<br>
All three days begin with a 5-minute adaptation period before the trial starts. On day one<br>
(baseline startle) after the adaptation period, the animal receives 30 trials of 120dB<br>
auditory noise. The mean startle amplitude (Vmax) is used to assign animals to groups<br>
with similar means before conditioning begins. Day two consists of conditioning the<br>
animals. Each animal receives 0.5 mA of shock for 500 msec preceded by a 5 second<br>
presentation of light which remains on for the duration of the shock. Ten presentations of<br>
the light and shock are administered. Day three is the testing trial where drug<br>
administration occurs prior to testing. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, startle<br>
testing sessions are conducted. Ten trials of acoustic startle (120 dB), non-light paired,<br>
are presented at the beginning of the session. This is followed by 20 random trials of the<br>
noise alone and 20 random trials of noise preceded by light. Excluding the first 10 trials,<br>
the startle response amplitudes for each trial type are averaged for each animal. Data is<br>
presented as the difference between light + noise and noise-alone. Differences in startle<br>
response amplitudes are analyzed by JMP statistical software using a One-way Anova<br>
(analysis of variance, t-test). Group differences are considered to be significant at p
In another preferred embodiment the present invention provides a method of<br>
treating epilepsy, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
At present, there are several types and subtypes of seizures associated with<br>
epilepsy, including idiopathic, symptomatic, and cryptogenic.   These epileptic seizures<br>
can be focal (partial) or generalized. They can also be simple or complex. Epilepsy is<br>
described in the art, such as Epilepsy: A comprehensive textbook. Ed. by Jerome Engel,<br>
Jr. and Timothy A. Pedley. (Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, 1997). At present, the<br>
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, (ICD-9) provides a diagnostic<br>
tool including epilepsy and related disorders. These include: generalized nonconvulsive<br><br>
WO 2006/057870	PCT/US2005/041441<br>
epilepsy, generalized convulsive epilepsy, petit mal status epilepticus, grand mal status<br>
epilepticus, partial epilepsy with impairment of consciousness, partial epilepsy without<br>
impairment of consciousness, infantile spasms, epilepsy partialis continua, other forms of<br>
epilepsy, epilepsy, unspecified, NOS. As used herein the term "epilepsy" includes these<br>
all types and subtypes. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative<br>
nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for neurological and psychiatric<br>
disorders, including epilepsy, and that these systems evolve with medical scientific<br>
progress.<br>
Various electroshock-induces models has been extensively used as a model of<br>
seizure disorders.<br>
Example E<br>
Electroshock-induced seizures.<br>
Application of electrical stimulation by corneal electrodes to mice can, induce<br>
tonic hindlimb-extensor seizures. Blockade of tonic extensor seizures induced by<br>
electroshock is considered predictive for drugs which block seizure propagation and may<br>
be effective in preventing various seizures in humans, including epileptic seizures.<br>
