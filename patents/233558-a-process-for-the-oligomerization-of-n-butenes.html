				<td> Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the oligomerization of alkenes, e.g., the oligomerization of normal butenes to produce primarily octenes. More particularly the invention relates to the oligomerization of 1-butene and 2-butene contained in a mixed C4 stream which has been depleted of isobutenes such as from an MTBE unit or isobutene purification units. More particularly the invention relates to the oligomerization of butenes over ZSM-57 zeolite catalyst in a distillation column reactor. Related Art<br>
The mixed C4 stream from an MTBE unit or an isobutene purification unit, often called a raffinate stream, contains diluted normal butenes, especially butene-1 and butene-2. These streams have been dimerized in the past in tubular reactors containing catalysts such as supported phosphoric acid (SPA) and the zeolites ZSM-22 and ZSM-57. However the reaction conditions have been severe, e.g., temperatures of between 330째F to 482째F and pressures of between 1,000 psig to 1.215psig.<br>
Besides the reaction conditions the catalysts have previously had short lives. The SPA catalyst produces only about 333 tons of oligomers per ton of catalyst and has a useful lifetime of 2-3 weeks on stream, after which the catalyst must be discarded. The zeolite catalysts have longer lifetimes (3-4 months), but lose activity and must be regenerated off-line at considerable expense.<br>
The selectivity of the above-mentioned catalysts is lower than ideal. The desired product from butenes is octenes, which can be converted to isononyl alcohols. Higher oligomers, such as C12 olefins are useful to the extent that profitable outlets, e.g., tridecyl alcohol or isopar solvents, can be found.<br>
Typical results of the selectivity of the above catalysts in the tubular reactors are shown below in TABLE I:<br><br>

Finally, it should be noted that isobutenes have been oligomerized over acid cation exchange resin catalysts in distillation column reactors in combination with boiling point reactors as disclosed in U.S. patents 4,242,530 and 5,003,124.<br>
The present invention provides higher conversion per pass than in other processes with higher selectivity. A further advantage is that the present process operates under less severe conditions of temperature and pressure than prior commercial oligomerization processes using ZSM-57 catalyst Still another advantage is a much longer online time before turnaround to regeneiate the catalyst and potentially longer catalyst life. It is a feature of the present invention that the catalyst can be regenerated and enhanced in situ, thus providing even greater efficiency and cost savings.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, the present invention is a process for the oligomerization of alkenes comprising feeding alkenes to a distillation column reactor containing a bed of ZSM-57 zeolite catalyst, contacting said alkenes with said ZSM-57 zeolite catalyst under conditions of oligomerization, thereby catalytically reacting said alkenes to form oligomersand concurrently separating and recovering said oligomers. Preferably the alkenes comprise linear alkenes having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as C4 alkenes, preferably n-butenes.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the mixed butenes, such as raffinate, may be readily oligomerized over the zeolite catalyst ZSM-57 in a distillation column reactor at very high selectivity to octenes (&gt;90 mol%). The oligomerization is preferably ' carried out under conditions which favor dimerization as opposed to longer chain oligomers, preferably at pressures of between 300 and 400 psig and temperatures in the range of 240 to 320 째F at conversions of up to about 97 mol%.<br>
To obtain the advantages of the present process the mixed butenes must be free of certain components that poison the ZSM-57 catalyst such as dimethyl ether (DME), and some sulfur compounds, e.g., dimethyl sulfide, and butadiene. This is also required for the prior non catalytic distillation processes using ZSM-57. All of the undesirable materials can be removed conventionally by distillation, sulfur chemisorption and butadiene hydrogenation.<br>
In cases where the sulfur guard bed has failed and sulfur compounds have poisoned the ZSM-57 catalyst, the catalyst may be regenerated in situ by washing with normal heptane. The regeneration has been found to have increased the catalyst activity.<br>

The use of the distillation column reactor is known. Catalyst placed on trays or combined into a distillation structure and placed into a dist; jn column. The selective hydrogenation of diolefins such as propadiene and 1-3 butadiene in a distillation column reactor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,169,218 which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the present invention a fractional distillation is made simultaneously with the selective hydrogenation of the 1-3 butadiene to remove the DME contaminant as overheads.<br>
The catalyst, to be effective, must be in the form so as to provide gas liquid contact. There are many forms of catalyst structures available for this purpose and these are disclosed variously in U.S. Pat., Nos. 5,266,546; 4,731,229; and 5,073,236. The most preferred catalyst structure is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,843 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
It is believed that in the present reactions catalytic distillation is a benefit first, because the reaction is occurring concurrently with distillation, the initial reaction products and other stream components are removed from the reaction zone as quickly as possible reducing the likelihood of side reactions. Second, because all the<br><br>
components are boiling the temperature of reaction is controlled by the boiling point of the mixture at the system pressure. The heat of reaction simply creates more boil up, but no increase in temperature at a given pressure. As a result, a great deal of control'over the rate of reaction and distribution of products can be achieved by regulating the system pressure. Also, adjusting the throughput (residence time = liquid hourly space velocity"1) gives further control of product distribution and to a degree control of the side reactions such as oligomerization. A further benefit that this reaction may gain from catalytic distillation is the washing effect that the internal reflux provides to the catalyst thereby reducing polymer build up and coking. Internal reflux may be varied over the range of 0.2 to 20 L/D (wt. liquid just below the catalyst bed/wt. distillate) and gives excellent results.<br>
Referring now to the FIGURE a simplified flow diagram of the preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. The mixed C4 stream is fed along with hydrogen via flow line 101 to a first distillation column reactor 10 containing a bed 12 of hydrogenation catalyst. In the distillation column reactor 10 the butadienes are selectively hydrogenated to butenes and at the same time the OME is separated by fractional distillation and removed as overheads via flowline 102. The bottoms containing the butenes and less than 10 wppm butadiene are removed via flow line 103 and fed to reactor 20 containing a bed 22 of catalyst that chemisorbs the sulfur compounds.<br>
The effluent from the reactor 20 containing less than 1 wppm total sulfur compounds is removed via flow line 104 and fed, along with recycle from flow line 108, via flow line 105 to a second distillation column reactor 30 containing a bed 32 of ZSM-57 zeolite catalyst. A portion of the butenes in the stream are oligomerized to higher olefins, preferably octenes, in the catalyst bed. The higher boiling oligomers and some butenes are removed as bottoms via flow line 107. Some butenes may be taken as overheads and recycled as reflux (not shown) with a purge of lighter material taken via flow line 106 to prevent buildup of the lighter material.<br>
The bottoms in flow line 107 are fed to a debutanizer column 40 where any C/s are removed as overheads and recycled to the second distillation column reactor 30 for further conversion. Product oligomers are removed from the debutanizer as bottoms via flow line 109 for further separation.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Twenty-one pounds of ZSM-57 zeolite catalyst were loaded in a distillation column reactor utilizing the catalyst structure shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,843. A typical feed, as shown in TABLE II above, after treatment to remove the DME, butadiene and sulfur to acceptable levels was fed to the reactor.
