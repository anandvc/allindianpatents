				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a washer, a threaded fastener, a method of assembling atleast two parts and a power tool therefor.<br>
It is known to fasten objects with one another with a fastener which has a multi-part replacement nut, for example including an inner sleeve, an outer sleeve, and a washer. Such a replacement nut is disclosed for example in our US Patent No. 5,341,560. Another replacement nut is disclosed in our US Patent No. 6,254,323 in which a bolt has a spline underneath its upper thread, to which a washer is non-rotatably connected, and the bolt also has engaging means for applying a reaction force, while an active force of the same tool turns the nut on the bolt thread and the washer face. In the fasteners disclosed in both above mentioned patents, the common features are the use of the action and reaction force of one tool, the elimination of reaction arms on torque power tools, the conversion of torque to torsion-free bolt stretching and obtaining for the first time the desired residual bolt load rather than a torque, which is estimated based on calculated frictions rather than on actual frictions or a tension, which is based on estimated bolt relaxation when the force is transmitted from the elongated bolt to the hand-tight nut.<br>
The problem found in the industry with the fastener disclosed in U.S. patent no. 5,341,560 is that, since the nut has to be made with two sleeves<br>
-2-<br><br>
whose outside diameter has to meet the outside diameter of a regular nut, both sleeves have less material than a regular nut. This requires the use of high strength materials, which causes a reluctance on the part of the customers to change materials and fear of the unknown. !n the fastener disclosed in U.S. patent no. 6,254,323 the bolt needs to be altered, which is not just costly but not easily acceptable by the industry. In other words the fastener disclosed in our U.S. patent no. 5,341,560 requires alteration of the nut, while the fastener disclosed in our U.S. patent no. 6,254,323 requires alteration of the bolt. In addition, both versions are expensive to produce, adding to customer's reluctance to purchase these fasteners.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a washer, a fastener provided with a washer, and a method of and a power tool for fastening with the use of the washer, which avoid the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
In keeping with these objects, the present invention provides a washer to be applied between an object and a nut threadingly connected with a bolt which<br>
has an axis and is introduced into the object comprising of at least two parts to be assembled, the washer comprising a body having an axis and provided at one axial side with a first bearing face surface adapted to cooperate with a nut and having a facial friction with the nut, at an opposite axial side with a second bearing<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
face surface adapted to cooperate with the object and having a facial friction with the object, and a third turning resistant surface located inside said body, said body comprising a radially inner part having a radially outer surface and bolt thread engaging means to connect with a thread of the bolt, and also comprising a radially outer part having a radially Inner surface, and said radially outer and inner surfaces of said radially inner and radially outer parts of said body cooperating with one another so that said radially inner part cannot rotate freely inside said radially outer part during tightening but is displaced axially relative to said radially outer part upon bolt elongation, so that when the nut is turned with a given force in one direction and said body of the washer receives simultaneously said given force in an opposite direction, only the nut turns to elongate the bolt and said body of the washer remains rotation stationary, while said bolt does not turn but elongates or relaxes in an axial direction.<br>
The present invention also provides a threaded fastener for connecting at least two parts which constitute an object comprising a bolt having a thread and<br>
an axis and introduceable into the two parts; a nut screwable on said bolt; and a washer to be applied between the object and the nut, said washer comprising a body having an axis and provided at one axial side with a first bearing face surface adapted to cooperate with said nut and having a facial friction with the nut, at an opposite axial side with a second bearing face surface adapted to cooperate with said object and having a facial friction with the object, and a third turning resistant surface located inside said body, said body comprising a radially inner<br>
-4 -<br><br>
part having a radially outer surface and bolt thread engaging means to connect with a thread of the bolt, and also comprising a radially outer part having a radially inner surface, and said radially outer and inner surfaces of said radially inner and radially outer parts of said body cooperating with one another so that said radially inner part can not rotate freely inside said radially outer part during tightening but is displaced axially relative to said radially outer part upon bolt elongation, so that when said nut is turned with a given force in one direction and said body of the washer receives simultaneously said given force in an opposite direction, only said nut turns to elongate the bolt and said body of the washer remains rotation stationary, while said bolt does not turn but elongates or relaxes in an axial direction.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of assembling at least two parts which constitute an object with one another, comprising the steps of:<br>
introducing a boit having a thread and an axis into the parts so that a free end portion of the bolt extends outwardly beyond at least one side of the parts ;<br>
placing a friction washer on said free end portion of said bolt so that said friction washer engages with said thread of said bolt to create a turning friction between said washer and said bolt and so as to abut against said at least one side of the parts ;<br>
threadingly connecting a nut to said free end portion of said bolt so as to abut against the friction washer and to form an assembly ;<br>
-5-<br><br>
using the washer which has a body having an axis and provided at one axial side with a first bearing face surface adapted to cooperate with a nut and having a facial friction with the nut, at an opposite axial side with a second bearing face surface adapted to cooperate with the object and having a facial friction with the object, and a third turning resistant surface located inside the body, with the body comprising a radially inner part having a radially outer surface and bolt thread engaging means to connect with the thread of the bolt, and a radially outer part having a radially inner surface, with the radially outer and inner surfaces of the radially inner and radially outer parts of the body cooperating with one another so that the radially inner part can not rotate freely inside the radially outer part during tightening but is displaceable axially relative to the radially outer part upon bolt elongation;<br>
placing a torque power tool on the assembly so as to tighten or loosen the nut with a turning portion of said torque power tool connected to the nut to overcome a thread friction between the bolt and a facial friction with the friction washer to turn the nut, and with a reaction portion of the torque power tool connected to the washer to absorb a reaction force due to a facial friction of the friction washer with the nut; and<br>
turning with the torque power tool the nut with a given force in one direction and applying to the body of the washer simultaneously said given force in an opposite direction, so that thereby only a nut turns to elongate the bolt and the body of the washer remains rotation stationary, while the bolt does not turn but elongates or relaxes in an axial direction,<br>
-6-<br><br>
Still another feature of the present invention resides in a power tool for fastening objects, comprising a housing provided with a non-rotatable element; a power drive in said housing and provided with a rotatable driving element; and a fastener part comprising a bolt having a thread and an axis and introduceable into the parts forming an object, a nut screwable on said bolt, and a washer applied between said nut and said bolt, said washer comprising a body having an axis and being provided with a first bearing face surface located at one axial side and adapted to cooperate with said nut, a second bearing face surface located at an opposite axial side and adapted to cooperate with the object, and at least one third turning resistant surface adapted to cooperate with a bolt with said thread, of said bolt, said body comprising a radially inner part having a radially outer surface and bolt thread engaging means to connect with a thread of the bolt, and also comprising a radially outer part having a radially inner surface, and said radially outer and inner surfaces of said radially inner and radially outer parts of said body cooperating with one another so that said radially inner part cannot rotate freely inside said radially outer part during tightening but is displaced axially relative to said radially outer part upon bolt elongation, so that when said nut is turned by one of said elements with a given torque in one direction and said washer receives simultaneously a given force from another of said elements in an opposite direction, only said nut turns to tighten or loosen said bolt while said washer and said bolt remain rotation stationary.<br>
_ 7 _<br><br>
Still another feature of the present invention is that the third turning resistant surface of the washer increases its turning resistance and/or its resistance toward an axial movement in use according to the increase in drag friction created by the nut onto the bolt when it is under tension, by having the, turning resistant surface squeezed further into the bolt thread and against the inside of one of the washer parts as a result of the drag friction of the bolt or the turning force applied to the washer if the given force is applied to it in the opposite direction.<br>
In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the turning resistant portion of the washer has for example a ring having an inward side engage in the bolt thread and an outward side having gear teeth to turn a gear engaging in the gear teeth of the ring and also engaging in the inward side of the washer body with two facial friction areas, whereby the gear is connected to a plate between the washer body and the object so that when the bolt turns along with the nut the turning resistant portion of the washer wants to turn along in the same direction, trying to turn the gear, which in turn tries to turn the washer body in the opposite direction to the<br>
-7A-<br>
7<br><br>
track friction applied to its bearing face surface by the nut so that the bolt and the washer with its parts remains rotation stationary while the nut is turned.<br>
As the drag friction created by the nut on the bolt can be quite high, the nut does in no way diminish the bolt load resulting from the torque applied to the nut when the bolt stands still. It is the object of the present invention to stop the bolt from turning along with the nut, but allowing the bolt to move in an axial direction when the nut is turned. Therefore, to stop the bolt from turning with or in the third turning resistant surface of the washer when the drag friction is high, a wedge can be inserted between the inner surface of the outer washer part and the outer surface of the inner washer part to increase the turning friction created by the turning resistant surface of the washer with the bolt.'<br>
The wedge part can but does not to have project above the first bearing surface. When it does project and the nut is turned down on it, the wedge part moves down and wedges the turning resistant surface into the bolt thread to stop all turning of the bolt relative to it. When it does not project and the turning resistant surface moves up as a result of the turning of the bolt, the upward movement causes it to be pressed against the bolt thread to stop the bolt from turning, in which case it is best located within the<br>
8<br><br>
two bearing faces of the washer in a way that it also eliminates turning of the turning resistant surface of one washer part relative to the other washer part. Therefore when the bolt turns along the nut and the turning resistant surface arises as a result of it, the turning resistant surface gets squeezed further into the bolt thread, the bolt stops turning as a result of it and the turning resistant surface rises only with the bolt stretch created by the turning nut.<br>
When the washer and the fastener are designed in accordance with the present invention and the method is performed in accordance with the present invention, regular nuts and regular bolts can be used. In other words the customer can use whatever he has adding merely a washer. The benefit is quite remarkable. First of all the product is much less expensive than each of the products in the above mentioned patents. Secondly, the customer uses his approved bolts and nuts. Third, instead of reacting on a part of the nut directly as in the U.S. patent no. 5,41,560 or indirectly as in the U.S. patent no.5,946,789 by passing the reaction force through the washer to a part of the nut, the reaction force is solely absorbed by the washer. Furthermore, the solution proposed in the present application provides the identical benefits as the solutions disclosed in the above mentioned patents, one of which is a torsion-free elongation of the free portion of the bolt, a known coefficient of friction and thus a known bolt load,<br>
9<br><br>
a reaction-arm free hydraulic torque tool use, a bridge- and puller free bolt stretching. In other words, torque is converted into torsion- and side-load-free bolt elongation to the desired bolt load by means of a torque power tool, which can be also applied to torque regular nuts with a reaction member. It needs to be considered that most bolts in the industry are through bolts with a nut on the other side or blind bolts threaded into the bottom part of the two parts.<br>
It is known that if a torque power tool is applied to a fastener in a way where the nut is turned by the active force of the torque power tool and the reaction is absorbed by a regular washer underneath the nut, then either the nut or the washer will turn at will or the bolt turns along with the nut and nothing is accomplished, or the bolt end tightens further into the blind hole causing the bottom threads to mushroom which makes disassembly extremely difficult. The reason for that is that the nut has two friction areas, the threaded connection with the bolt which creates a drag friction and the facial area with the washer, whereby the washer has one facial area with the nut and one facial area with the two parts to be assembled. In other words, both have two friction areas. While it is correct that a threaded friction is a little less than a facial friction, the difference is minute as the facial friction   between the washer and the nut balance each other out, so that there is<br>
-10-<br><br>
merely one minute difference between the nut and the washer. At the same time if the bolt is a through bolt, the thread friction between the bolt and the nut and thus the bolt turning resistance is obviously much less than the facial friction of the washer and while the washer would absorb the reaction force without turning, the bolt would turn along with the nut and nothing is accomplished unless a back-up wrench is used to stop the bottom nut from turning. Therefore, neither is enough to guarantee that only the nut turns, which is why the third friction area had to be introduced to the washer. This however not enough to guarantee that only the nut turns.<br>
On the other hand, if the washer in accordance with the present invention is connected with the thread of the bolt, the bolt can not turn along with the nut because the washer will have to lift up which it can not because the nut is on top of it. This would make a bolt elongation resulting from turning down the nut impossible. The present invention therefore provides a bolt thread engaging washer section which is connected with the bolt thread. Since this alone would not help because this section could move either along with the bolt by rotating or upward if the bolt rotates in it. This in turn would allow the bolt turn along with the nut as the section rotates or moves up therefore in accordance with a further new feature of the present invention.       The bolt thread engaging means therefore is frictionally<br>
11<br><br>
connected with the body of the washer, so that its rotational or upward movement is subject to overcoming a friction greater than a drag friction created on the bolt by the turning nut, to stop the bolt from turning. This friction in conjunction with the two facial frictions of the washer assure that the bolt does not move along with the nut, that the bolt is stretched, and that the washer and its bolt thread engaging section do not rotate while the nut is being turned.<br>
It is important to understand that when the bolt turns along with the nut as a result of the drag friction and the bolt thread engagement section turns along with the bolt or moves upward in the washer nothing is accomplished. This explains why either movement of the bolt thread engaging section has to be restricted by requiring a greater force than that exerted by the drag friction created by the nut onto the bolt even when the bolt is under load. This can be accomplished in various ways explained by some examples without limiting the invention.<br>
If the reaction force of the tool is applied to the outside of the washer through engagement means thereon, it is also possible to have a pin or the like connected at one end to the thread engagement section and having its outer end sticking out of the circumference of the washer so that when the tool is connected with the washer the pin is pushed inwardly pushing the thread engagement section inwardly into the bolt thread.<br>
-12-<br><br>
The novel features which are considered as characteristic for the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figures 1-6 are views of a threaded fastener provided with a washer in accordance various embodiments of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 7 is a view illustrating a fastening process with the use of the fastener and the washer in accordance with the present invention, and a power tool.<br>
-13-<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show a threaded fastener which has a bolt identified with reference numeral 1 and introducible into an object which is composed for example of two parts to be assembled with one another as identified with reference numeral 2. The fastener further has a nut which is identified with reference numeral 3." The nut is provided with an inner thread 4 which is screwed on an outer thread 5*of the bolt 1.<br>
The threaded fastener further has a washer which is identified as a whole with reference numeral 6. The washer 6 has a body identified with reference numeral 7 which is provided with a first upper bearing face surface 8 cooperating with the nut 3, a second lower bearing face surface 9 cooperating with the object 2 or in particular with a surface of one of the parts to be assembled with one another, and at least one turning resistant surface which is identified with reference numeral 10. The first and second bearing face surfaces are spaced from one another in an axial direction or in other words in a direction of an axis A1 of the washer which coincides with an axis A2 of the bolt. The at least one third turning resistant surface 10 is located radially inwardly of the body 7 of the washer 6, The third turning resistant surface 10 is formed so as to engage with or wedge in the thread 5 of the<br><br>
14<br><br>
bolt 1, for example by providing a corresponding thread 11 on the turning resistant surface 10.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the body 7 is composed of two parts 7' and 7" which are located radially adjacent to one another, so that the part 7" is located radially inwardly of the part 7'. The turning resistant surface 10 with the bolt thread engaging means 11 is provided radially inwardly on the part 7". The parts 7' and 7" are connected with one another so as to avoid turning relative to one another, "but to permit a movement relative to one another in an axial direction. For this purpose, the portions 7' and 7" can be frictionally connected with one another, for example by being press-fit to create a greater resistance toward movement than the turning force applied by the bolt and so as to stop the boft from turning along with the nut and permitting an axial movement of the part 7" relative to the part 7' when the bolt is pulled up by the turning nut.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1a the turning of the part 7" relative to the part 7' is stopped by interengaging splines 12, for example<br>
provided on the radially outer surface of the part 7" and a radially inner<br>
surface of the part 7', which permits the axial movement of the part 7" only.<br>
15<br><br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1 b the turning of the part 7" relative to the part T is prevented for example by a key 13 which permits   only axial<br><br>
movement between the parts 7' and 7" only.<br>
As shown in Figure 2 the part 7" can be for example formed as a split ring, and its radially outward surface can have inwardly rounded pockets 14 extending in the axial direction and radially inward surface of the part 7' can contain pins 15 which are coaxial with the bolt axis and which sit partially in the pockets. They force the split ring inwardly into the bolt thread if a turning motion is introduced into the part T and/or the 7", while limiting the turning between the parts T and 7" and also adding a further friction to the movement of the parts 7' and 7" relative to one another in the axial direction.<br>
As shown in Figure 3 the part 7' can have an oval inward surface whose rounded portion has a given dimension, while the part 7" can have at least one ring section engaging the bolt thread and located in the rounded portion by another dimension. Therefore the ring section is forced inwardly into the bolt thread if a turning motion is introduced to the part 7' and/or the part 7" in either direction, while adding restrictions to the movement of the part T and the part 7" relative to one another.<br>
-16-<br><br>
In accordance with a further embodiment shown in Figure 3a, the part 7' can be other than round or oval. It can have a shape which is different from the round or oval shapes.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the part 7" can be at least one part which for example has one of its sides banking on the inward surface of the part 7' and formed to restrict the turning motion of the part 7". It has its outer side engaging with the bolt thread and formed with increasing radius relative to the above mentioned one side, so as to turn within its restrictions and thus engage more and more the bolt thread with its outer side, while squeezing more and more with its outer side against the inward surface of the part 7' to increase its friction with the part relative to the axial movement pf the part 7".<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4c a pin 16 sits for example on the part 7" and extends outwardly through the part 7' to extend over the outer circumference of the part T. Therefore the engaging means of the tool are connected to the engaging means of the part 7' , the pin 16 is pushed inwardly to push the thread engaging sections into the bolt thread, so that the washer can be placed on the bolt without requiring the turning of the washer down the extending bolt threads and so that the axial movement of the thread engaging section is subject to overcoming the friction between it and the pin 16.<br>
-17-<br><br>
In the embodiment of Figure 5 the washer is formed so as to stop the bolt and the washer from turning along with the nut when the nut is turned by a power tool. Therefore, a turning resistant portion 7" of the washer 7 has for example a ring having an inward side engaging in the bolt thread and an outward side having gear teeth to turn a gear engaging in the gear teeth of the ring and also engaging in the inward side of the washer body with the two facial friction areas. The gear 17 is connected toa plate17a between the washer body and the object so that when the bolt turns along with the nut, the turning resistant portion of the washer wants to turn along in the same direction trying to turn the gear which in turn tries to turn the washer body in the opposite direction to the drag friction applied to its bearing face surface by the nut, so that the bolt and the washer with its part remains rotation stationary while the nut is turned.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 6 the washer is formed so as to stop the bolt from turning in the turning resistant portion of the part 7" by providing at least one wedge-shaped part 18 between the parts 7' and 7". It stops the part 7" from turning in the part 7' so that the drag force of the turning bolt can only rise the turning resistant portion of the washer which, however, wedges it further into the bolt thread until the bolt stops turning and the turning resistant surface moves only axially with the bolt.<br>
The lower bearing face surface 9 of the body of the washer can be formed to have a high friction relative to the object, for example, roughened.<br>
-18-<br><br>
In accordance with the invention it is also possible that the bolt thread engaging means have a different angle than a thread of the bolt, to create a greater friction between it and the bolt thread. It is also possible that the bolt thread engaging means is not threaded, but have a surface softer than a surface of the bolt to cause friction.<br>
Figure 7 shows a power tool in accordance with the present invention. The power tool can be electrically driven, pneumatically driven, hydraulically driven, or manually driven power tool. It has a power tool part with a housing identified as a whole with reference numeral 20, and a power drive in the housing and identified with reference numeral 21. The power tool part further has a rotatable driving element 22 which is to be connected to a nut of a fastener and turn the nut to overcome a thread friction with a bolt and a facial friction with a washer to turn the nut, and a non-rotatable element 23 connectable to a washer to absorb the reaction force due to the facial friction of the washer with the nut, its facial friction with one side of two parts to be fastened with one another, and its turning friction with the bolt, so that the washer and the bolt do not turn but absorb the reaction force of the power tool.<br>
The power drive  of the power tool part can include a cylinder 24, a piston 25 reciprocatingly movable in the cylinder under the action of a working fluid medium, a piston rod 26 extending outwardly beyond the cylinder 24 and pivotably connected   with at least one driving plate 27 which carries a pawl<br>

(not shown) engaged with a ratchet 28 so as to form a pawl-ratchet mechanism, with the ratchet being turnable and connected with the rotatable driving element 22, while the non-rotatable element 23 is fixedly connected with the housing.<br>
When as shown in Figure 7 the power tool part is placed on the fastener so as to tighten or loosen the nut 5, the working fluid medium in the cylinder 24 displaces the piston 25 which in turn through the pawl-ratchet mechanism turns the ratchet 28, and as a result the rotatable driving element 22 which is connected to the nut 5 turns the nut to overcome the thread friction with the bolt 1 and the facial friction with the washer 6, while the non- rotatable element 23 which is immovably connected to the housing is connected to the washer 6 to absorb the reaction force due to the facial friction of the washer 6 with the nut 5, its facial friction with one side of the parts 2, and its turning friction with the boll 1, so that the washer 6 and the bolt 1 do not turn, but absorb the reaction force. During the operation of the power tool described, the action force is applied to the nut 5, and equal reaction force is applied to the washer 6.<br>
It is to be understood that in order to engage the nut 5 by the rotatable driving element 22, the nut and the rotatable driving element must<br>
-20-<br><br>
have corresponding connecting means formed, for example as cooperating polygonal surfaces of the nut and of the rotatable driving element. On the other hand, in order to connect the non-rotatable element 23 to the washer 6, the washer and the non-rotatable element also must be provided with connecting means formed for example also as cooperating polygonal surfaces of the washer and of the non-rotatabie element,<br>
ft will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other types of constructions differing from the types described above.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in washer, fastener provided with a washer, and method of and a tool for fastening with the use of the washer, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from<br>
21<br><br>
the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention.<br>
