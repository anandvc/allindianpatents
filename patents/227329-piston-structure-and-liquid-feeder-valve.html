				<td>PISTON STRUCTURE AND LIQUID FEEDER VALVE<br>
The invention relates to a piston structure for two-directional axial motion in a<br>
piston cylinder containing liquid, the piston structure has a first side facing a first<br>
chamber and a second side facing a second chamber, a piston-rod is attached to the<br>
first or the second side of the piston, and in a recess formed in an outer portion of the<br>
piston an O-ring made of a resilient material and having a given cross-sectional<br>
diameter is placed which seals the wall of the piston cylinder. The invention further<br>
relates to a liquid feeder valve for allowing liquid flow-through in a certain amount or<br>
for a period of time from a pressurized source of liquid.<br>
In liquid systems, for example in water-pipe systems there is often need for<br>
enabling dosage of liquid in certain amounts or for a period of time. There are valves<br>
which can be used for this purpose, for example the so called "Shell-valves", such as<br>
water-closet flush valves. This application comprises a membrane and a relatively long<br>
and narrow conduit pipe with a cross-section of about 50 urn, which restricts the<br>
pressure of water and, by forming an auxiliary current it blocks' the flow path of the<br>
liquid after filling up a given volume. With use, the liquid flows through the thin<br>
passage in the same direction every time, and due to this, solid contaminants<br>
accidentally present in the liquid may choke up the narrow passage. In such case the<br>
valve must be disassembled and these contaminants can be removed from the<br>
conduit pipe by means of a thin wire pin which is after all a wearisome operation of<br>
maintenance.<br>
Patent application US 4,057,074 describes a valve design which is provided<br>
with an active piston displaceable in two directions. According to this description the<br>
design is operable even in case of great pressure differences existing between the two<br>
sides, by means of a spring used in one of the spaces of liquid. However, this element<br>
may in itself be a cause of failure.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a simple, reliable piston and with<br>
this a feeder valve structure, which do not require maintenance, which are operable<br>
within wide-ranging limits, with which liquid flow-through can be stabilized or can be<br>
changed in time according to chosen characteristic and can be implemented at low<br>
cost<br>
It has been realised that:<br><br>
when using a piston which comprises a resilient sealing element placed in a domain of<br>
its edge where the sealing element is able to assume two different positions and move<br>
between them, different cross-section of flow can be provided, consequently different<br>
flow velocity can be obtained;<br>
the two positions can be correspondent to two different directions of flow, thereby for<br>
example removal of possible contaminants can be performed in a self-cleaning way.<br>
To achieve the aim of the present invention, a piston structure mentioned in the introductory<br>
part is provided, wherein the axial width and at least in some places the radial depth of the recess<br>
formed in the outer portion of the piston are greater than the cross-sectional diameter of the O-ring,<br>
the O-ring is placed in the recess so that it is able to move, owing to the pressure difference between<br>
the first side and the second side, between a first position facing the first side and a second position<br>
facing the second side, and when the O-ring is in its first position the cumulated cross-sectional area<br>
of the flow path between the recess and the first side of the piston is A1, and the cross-sectional area<br>
of the flow path between the recess and the first side of the piston is AO, however, when the O-ring is<br>
in its second position the cumulated cross-sectional area of the flow path between the recess and the<br>
second side of the piston is A2, and the cross-sectional area of the flow path between the recess and<br>
the first side of the piston is AO, where the smaller of A1 and A2 is smaller than AO by orders of<br>
magnitude.<br>
In another embodiment, where the liquid flow-through is stabilized independently of the<br>
pressure fluctuation, in the piston structure mentioned in the introductory part, the flow path having a<br>
cumulated area Al is made up of one or more openings in the form of a radial scraping, grooving,<br>
ribbing or engraving in one or more places on the bearing area for the sealing element of the piston,<br><br>
which openings are narrowed down by the sealing element proportional to the pressure difference<br>
when the higher pressure present in the second chamber than in the first chamber deforms the sealing<br>
element elastically.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a Piston structure for two-directional axial<br>
motion in a piston cylinder containing liquid or gaseous fluid, said piston structure has a first side<br>
facing a first chamber and a second side facing a second chamber, a piston shaft is attached to said<br>
first or second side of said piston, and in a recess formed in an outer portion of said piston an O-ring<br>
made of a resilient material and having a given cross-sectional diameter is placed which seals the<br>
wall of said piston cylinder, the axial width and at least in some places the radial depth of said recess<br>
formed in the outer portion of said piston are greater than the cross-sectional diameter of said O-ring,<br>
the O-ring is placed in said recess so that it is able to move owing to the pressure difference existing<br>
between the first side and the second side, between a first position facing the first side and a second<br>
position facing the second side, characterized in that, the outer portion of the piston and the wall of<br>
the piston cylinder define a first space adjacent the first side of the piston and a second space adjacent<br>
the second side of the piston such that the first space forms a first conduit having a first cross-<br>
sectional area for fluid flow between the first side of the piston and the recess and the second space<br>
forms a second conduit having a second cross-sectional area for fluid flow between the second side<br>
of the piston and the recess, and when said O-ring is in its first position the cumulated cross-sectional<br>
area of a flow path between said recess and the first side of said piston is Al, and the cross-sectional<br>
area of a flow path between said recess and the second side of said piston is the second cross-<br>
sectional area of the second conduit, and when said O-ring is in its second position the cumulated<br>
cross-sectional area of said flow path between said recess and the second side of said piston is A2,<br><br>
and the cross-sectional area of said flow path between said recess and the first side of said piston is<br>
the first cross-sectional area of the first conduit, where the smaller of Al and A2 is smaller than the<br>
first cross-sectional area by orders of magnitude and smaller than the second cross-sectional area by<br>
orders of magnitude, and in the first and second position the direction of the possible liquid flow<br>
between first and second chambers is opposite.<br>
The invention further provides a piston structure for two-directional axial motion in a piston<br>
cylinder comprising : a piston cylinder having an inner surface for housing the piston and containing<br>
operating fluid; a piston disposed in the piston cylinder having a first face such that the first face and<br>
the inner surface form a first chamber in the piston cylinder, a second face such that the second face<br>
and the inner surface form a second chamber in the piston cylinder, and a side surface extending from<br>
the first face to the second face, the side surface including an outer portion having first and second<br>
side walls spaced from each other by a first distance, and a bottom surface adjacent the first and<br>
second side walls, the bottom surface and the outer portion defining a second distance such that the<br>
first and second side walls and bottom surface form a recess in the side surface, the outer portion of<br>
the piston and the inner surface of the piston cylinder defining a first space adjacent the first face<br>
such that the first space forms a first conduit for fluid flow between the first chamber and the recess<br>
along a first flow path, the first space having a first cross section transverse to the first flow path, and<br>
a second space adjacent the second face such that the second space forms a second conduit for fluid<br>
flow between the second chamber and the recess along a second flow path, the second space having a<br>
second cross section transverse to the second flow path, the second cross section and the first cross<br>
section each having a first area; a third conduit connecting the recess and the first chamber along a<br>
third flow path, the third conduit having a third cross section transverse to the third flow path, the<br>
third cross section having a second area less than the first area, and a fourth conduit connecting the<br><br>
recess and the second chamber along a fourth flow path, the fourth conduit having a fourth cross<br>
section transverse to the fourth flow path, the fourth cross section having a third area less than the<br>
first area; and a resilient member with a cross-section having an outer dimension less than the first<br>
distance and less than the second distance, the resilient member being disposed in the recess<br>
proximate the inner surface of the piston cylinder such that the resilient member is movable within<br>
the recess between first and second positions owing to differences in fluid pressure existing between<br>
the first chamber and the second chamber such that in the first position the resilient member allows<br>
fluid flow from the second chamber to the recess along the second flow path, blocks fluid flow from<br>
the recess to the first space along the first flow path, and allows fluid flow from the third conduit to<br>
the first chamber along the third flow path, and in the second position the resilient member allows<br>
fluid flow from the first chamber to the recess along the first flow path, blocks fluid flow from the<br>
recess to the second space along the second flow path, and allows fluid flow from the fourth conduit<br>
to the second chamber along the fourth flow path.<br>
The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings where :<br>
Figures 1A and 1B schematically show the principle of the liquid feeder valve according to<br>
the invention with two different directions of displacement;<br>

to the invention with two different directions of displacement;<br>
Figures 3A, 3B and 3C schematically show the cross-section of the sealing<br>
element and the recess of the piston according to the invention in different positions<br>
and implementation, in which the sealing element is an O-ring;<br>
Figures 4A and 4B show two possible shaping of the recesses which are<br>
formed in the sidewall of the piston cylinder according to the invention for programmed<br>
flow;<br>
Figures 5A and 5B show in side elevation the piston of the liquid feeder valve<br>
of Figures 2A and 2B with two different directions of displacement, having a sealing<br>
element profiled differently in its cross-sectional view; and<br>
Fjgures 6A and 6B show the pressure equalizing flow-through regulating<br>
function of the sealing element of the piston according to the invention.<br>
The piston structure shown in Figures 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B consists of a piston 1<br>
movable in a piston cyjinder 2 having circular cross-section, a piston shaft 4 mounted<br>
on piston and an auxiliary piston 3 mounted on piston shaft 4. The arrow shows the<br>
direction of flow of the liquid when the auxiliary piston 3 is in open position. The closed<br>
space bordered piston 1 forms a first chamber K1, while the space of liquid<br>
connected to the liquid system and intercommunicating the second side of piston 1<br>
when auxiliary piston 3 is in open position, can be regarded as a second chamber K2,<br>
which may be of different pressure than first chamber K1. On an outer portion of piston<br>
1, on its edge, a recess 6 is formed, which in Figures 1A and 1B is shown<br>
schematically, representing only its interior shape. In recess 6 a sealing element which<br>
in the present example is an O-ring 5 having a circular cross-section and made of a<br>
conventional resilient material is placed, the diameter of which is smaller than the axial<br>
width and at least in some places smaller than the radial depth of the recess 6. As a<br>
result of this, the O-ring 5 functioning as sealing is able to assume two different<br>
specific positions as a function of the difference between pressure prevailing in the<br>
first chamber K1 and second chamber K2 formed on the first side and second side of<br>
piston 1 respectively. In both positions, the piston structure is permeable to liquid to a<br>
certain extent. It is assumed that in the first position of O-ring 5 the cumulated flow<br>
path between recess 6 and first side of piston 1 (the side on the left in Figures 1 and 2)<br>
has a cross-sectional area A1 determining liquid flow-through, and the cumulated flow-<br>
through between recess 6 and second side of piston 1 (the side on the right in Figures<br><br>
1 and 2) has a cross-sectional area A2 in the second position. If hydraulic pressure is<br>
higher in second chamber K2, then O-ring 5 is in its first position, piston 1 moves in the<br>
direction of arrow M shown in Figure 2A, and a gap having a cross-section<br>
corresponding to area A1 determines liquid flow-through, that is the rate of filling up of<br>
the first chamber K1, and through this the length of time until auxiliary piston 3 on<br>
piston shaft 4 closes free flow of liquid along the arrow indicating the direction of flow.<br>
By moving of piston shaft 4 in the opposite direction, the conditions of pressure<br>
difference between first chamber K1 and second chamber K2 will change, thereby in<br>
the second position of O-ring 5 (Figure 2B), liquid being in the first chamber K1 can<br>
flow into second chamber K2 through a cross-sectional area A2 Unmarked symbolic<br>
arrows of Figures 1B and 2B by their having greater thickness than arrows of Figures<br>
1A and 2A indicate the larger, more rapid liquid flow-through. On activating piston 1 is<br>
enforced by a certain mechanism to move towards the first chamber K1. This<br>
mechanism can be a valve to run down liquid from the first chamber K1 to a space of<br>
lower pressure through either the piston 1 or the piston cylinder 2, or alternatively can<br>
be a direct mechanical mechanism for moving the piston shaft 4 which may be<br>
performed manually or by means of any other servo structure coupled to piston shaft 4<br>
as required, in the example according to Figure 2 area A2 is essentially larger than<br>
area A1, thereby it can be assured that in case of free liquid flow-through, the set<br>
timing well exceeds the time necessary for starting the feeder valve, that is, the time<br>
necessary for pushing piston shaft 4 up to a given point for example a point of "bump".<br>
Independent of whether O-ring 5 employed as sealing element takes up its<br>
first or second position in recess 6 of piston 1, the measurement of piston 1 without<br>
sealing is such that cross-sectional cumulated flow-through corresponding to a area<br>
AO is possible between the piston and the wall of the piston cylinder 2, and this cross-<br>
sectional area AO is substantially larger than A1 and A2, or at least larger than the<br>
smaller of the two. In the present example A2 is larger than A1, and AO may<br>
approximately be of the order of A2, since it does not increase the length of time being<br>
necessary for manual (mechanical) operation, for activation of the piston structure.<br>
Figures 3A-3C are enlarged drawings of the wall of piston cylinder 2, the edge<br>
part of piston 1 in which recess 6 is formed, and the sealing element O-ring 5 placed in<br>
recess 6. In this preferred embodiment, the cross-sectional area A1 and A2 necessary<br>
for flow-through may be implemented by forming grooves either in the wall of recess 6<br><br>
or in the surface of the O-ring 5. These grooves can be found both on the bottom part<br>
and side parts of recess 6 which has a rectangular cross-sectional profile. The<br>
dimensions (width and depth) of the grooves and aiso their denseness in the wall of<br>
the recess all together determine cross-sectional areas A1 and A2. The grooves can<br>
be formed by etching or they can be scratched in using a hard tool, the latter is simpler<br>
considering the difficulties in access of the inner surface of the recess. Displacement<br>
of O-ring 5 between its first and second position may take place substantially without<br>
friction in the environment filled with liquid, and, displacement is further promoted by<br>
allowance for measure. In Figure 3B where O-ring 5 is in its second position, it locks<br>
up, since it leans against the fiat wall of recess 6 which wall is at the second side (the<br>
right side in the Figure). In this case A2=0. In the case of Figure 3C A1 is larger than<br>
A2, but, the latter is also larger than 0.<br>
Flow operation of the feeder valve having a principal piston and an auxiliary<br>
piston shown jn Figure 2, that is, setting the characteristics of operation of the feeder<br>
valve in terms of time, can be done by choosing the cumulated measurements of the<br>
openings for flow-through (At, A2), as well as by adjusting the opening point of<br>
auxiliary piston 3. It is easy to see that displacement of piston 1 means travelling of the<br>
sealing element along the inner wall of piston cylinder 2. This makes possible<br>
formation of the respective areas (A1 or A2) of openings for flow-through between the<br>
sealing element and the wall of the piston cylinder 2 instead of forming them between<br>
the sealing element and the wall of the recess 6, in this way ensuring flow-through in<br>
compliance with the instantaneous location of displacement and thereby variable<br>
speed of piston 1. This may be needed for example when auxiliary piston 3 is moved<br>
in the vicinity of its closing or opening point, when significant braking effect is needed<br>
for damping - as much as possible - the "shock" occurring for example at the time of<br>
closing. It can be very important in case of liquid feeder valves used in industry, where<br>
respectable quantities of flow-through are needed and mechanical stress of the<br>
system would be greater without braking. This kind of accomplishment that is, when<br>
area A1 is variable depending on the position of piston 1, may be assured by recesses<br>
7, 8, as it is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4A illustrates recess 7 which provides a linearly<br>
decreasing cross-section, and Figure 4B shows recess 8 by means of which the cross-<br>
section can be altered linearly as well as steplike (immediately), thereby realizing a<br>
peculiar characteristic of velocity in time.<br><br>
In Figures 5A and 5B two positions of sealing element 11 of piston 10 are<br>
shown respectively, illustrating the direction of liquid-flow and the direction of<br>
displacement M of the piston. This example shows that it is not necessary for sealing<br>
element 11 to be formed as O-ring, but other sealing having an annular cross-section<br>
can bemused, which is suitable for assuring the required sealing by leaning against the<br>
wall of the recess and the wall of the piston cylinder. The arrows indicating the flow-<br>
through are shown at the line of the axis, in relation to this it should be noted that in<br>
the condition which makes more rapid flow-through possible, that is when area A2 is<br>
larger, the opening for flow-through between the second side of piston 10 and the<br>
recess may be also realized on other parts of the piston, for example by forming bore-<br>
holes in the piston-body. These bore-holes may connect the internal space of the<br>
recess and the second side of piston 10. The piston 10 illustrated in side elevation in<br>
Fig-5A and Fig. SB includes a radial U shaped groove 12, with a difference that the<br>
right side of the piston 10 is cut through along one leg of the U shape being<br>
transversal to the" plane of drawing.<br>
In the spirit of the present invention, built upon a common ground, there are<br>
further possibilities for constructing a piston structure in which the sealing element<br>
through its elastic deformation narrows down the opening for flow-through having a<br>
area A1 proportionately to the measure of pressure difference between the first side<br>
and the second side. The operation of this is shown in Figure 6, where Figure 6A<br>
illustrates the position of sealing element 21 which is by way of example realized as an<br>
O-ring. The sealing element 21 lies above opening 23 formed on an inner surface<br>
(looking onto the first side) of the recess of piston 22. This is the situation when<br>
pressures on the first side and on the second side substantially equal to each other or<br>
there is only a slight difference between them. However, in case of liquid systems with<br>
high pressure, it may occur that this difference is great Then flow of liquid through<br>
opening 23 would be more rapid, which can be compensated by elastic deformation of<br>
the sealing element as shown in Figure 6B, where a portion of the O-ring deflects<br>
thereby it narrows down the effective cross-section of opening 23. In this manner, by<br>
appropriate choosing of the size of opening 23 as well as the material of the sealing<br>
element 21, the narrowing down of the cross-section (performed in the interest of<br>
uniformity of flow-through measured during a unit of time) is directly proportional to the<br>
invert of flow velocity. This self-adjusting structure can be used also in case of valves<br><br>
where the piston does not perform reciprocating motion. Still, all these can result in<br>
useful side effects in case of liquid feeder valves performing two-directional motion,<br>
too.<br>
In the liquid feeder valve structures like in Figure 1 and 2 it may be a problem<br>
to open the auxiliary piston 3 from its fully closed state. In case of high liquid pressure<br>
and large sizes the force caused by the pressure on the auxiliary piston 3 disables to<br>
open it with the piston shaft 4. It may be a considerable problem, especially in case of<br>
hand operated mode, but in case of applied servo machine reduction of the power<br>
need is also desirable. For this purpose the high pressure liquid can be run down from<br>
the closed space of first chamber K1 without displacing closed auxiliary piston 3. It can<br>
be achieved in different manners, all having the common feature that the high<br>
pressure liquid from first chamber K1 is getting to a space of lower pressure through<br>
either the piston 1 or the piston cylinder 2. In this case the area A2 is not relevant, it<br>
may be zero.<br>
In the arrangement of Figure 7A a further control valve 1' is formed within the<br>
piston 1, which enables then liquid to flow from first chamber K1 to a low pressure<br>
space K3, which is a liquid outlet indeed. Control valve 1' can be opened by another<br>
piston shaft 4' which passes through the hollow body of piston shaft 4" connecting<br>
piston 1 to auxiliary piston 3. The piston shaft 4* can move independently from piston<br>
shaft 4". The control valve 1' of small area can be opened against tiny force, and after<br>
release pressure and run down liquid from the first chamber K1; the high pressure<br>
liquid in second chamber K2 will have the piston 1 moved toward the first chamber K1<br>
during the opened period of control valve 1', and the main liquid stream flows into the<br>
space K3 as illustrated in Figure 7B. A spring S is used to return control valve 1' into<br>
its closed state when the piston shaft 4' is released. Then the piston 1 together with<br>
auxiliary piston 3 will move in reverse direction at a speed dependent on area A1 until<br>
auxiliary piston 3 closes the main stream.<br>
In the arrangement of Figure 8A a controllable valve V in the wall of piston<br>
cylinder 2 is used to release pressure and run down liquid from the first chamber K1.<br>
Opening and closing valve V provides a control corresponding to that of the control<br>
valve 1' described above, as illustrated also in Figure 8B. The piston shaft 4 is different<br>
from the similar element of Figures 1 and 2 in that initiating and timing the main stream<br>
flow period is activated by valve V instead piston shaft 4 of Figure 8, which requires a<br><br>
small power also in this case. The foregoing structures fundamentally concern liquids.<br>
However, it should be that by foming micro-sized radial scraping, grooving,<br>
ribbing or engraving on the bearing areas in one or more places, the components are<br>
able to perform the aforementioned asymmetrical operation in case of gases, for<br>
example in case of gaseous shock absorbers or dampers. Thus the invention can be<br>
used in connection with any fluid, either liquid or gaseous fluids.<br>
A significant advantage of the present invention is that when it is used as<br>
valve, then two-directional operation results in self-cleaning, and there is no need for<br>
using complicated tools. For putting into practice, asymmetry (A1«A2) is essential in<br>
terms of proportioning activation and required time of operation. Finally, on the one<br>
hand, the technique used makes it possible to realize a characteristic of flow-through<br>
which changes in time, on the other hand, it makes possible to keep this characteristic<br>
steady irrespective of the pressure fluctuation of the source.<br><br>
