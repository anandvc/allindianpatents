				<td>The present invention relates to a culture vessel for rooting of microshoots. More particularly this invention relates to a culture vessel useful for efficient rooting of microshoots.<br>
Micropropagation plays a key role in the large scale production of elite planting material in a short span of time. The plantlets thus propagated are generally disease free. Although different teclmiques are used for different species yet, the most commonly used explant is a nodal segment where a single axillary bud is made to proliferate into multiple<br>
shoots. The shoot differentiation may be preceded by unorganized grawth (callus) depending upon the medium composition and kind of plant growth regulators (PGRs)<br>
used. The shoots produced in culture are refferecl to as 'microshoots' or 'microcuttings'. However, the rooting of microshoots is a pre-requisite for any successful micropropagation protocol to facilitate their establishment in soil. Rooting of microshoots can be accomplished both under in vitro and ex vitro conditions.<br>
Although in ex vitro rooting, the step of hardening is omitted and both rooting and hardening are a one step procedure, yet there are some difficult to root systems which require minerals, a carbohydrate source and root promoting auxins for rooting. It is also reported that it is difficult to induce rooting in oil bearing rose cultivars (Kirichenko E.B. 1991. Factors in optimizing the multiplication of ornamental and essential oil roses in vitro. Byulleten 'Glav. Botanicheskogo Sada. 167:96-102). In such systems, in vitro rooting is required. In vitro rooting for better survival in green house conditions has been reported in pecan, oak and other woody plant species (Lazarte, I.E. 1984. Tissue culture of pecan, oak and other woody plant species. Combined Proceedings- International Plant Propagators Society. 33: 614-618.<br>
Keeping in view the difficulties encountered in rooting of microshoots of difficult root systems, the present investigation was carried out. Root induction in a liquid medium with  some kind of support systems could provide suitable micro-environment for root and shoot proliferation, for which purpose a polypropylene vessel was selected.<br>
The different components of culture vessel were a polypropylene vessel (3) with perforated aluminum platform (1) having holes of 2 cm diameter with row-to-row distance to 2 cm, which is placed at a height of 3 cm from the base and covered with polypropylene lid (2).<br>
This culture vessel is novel and is not known so far.<br>
The main object of the present investigation is to prepare a culture vessel useful for rooting of micro shoots.<br>
The other object of present investigation is to induce rooting of micro shoots in vitro.<br>
Another object of present investigation is to induce rooting in a large number of shoots concurrently.<br>
Yet another object of the present investigation is to reduce the cost of rooting. Yet another object of the present investigation is to bring about case of operation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a culture vessel useful for rooting of micro shoots, characterized by a vessel (2) made up of a nontoxic material in the form of a housing having an airtight lid (3) removably fixed to the said vessel(2), the said vessel (2) being provided at a height of about 3 cm from the base with perforated platform(l) having holes of 1-3 cm diameter with row to row distance of 2-3 cm housed in the said vessel at a distance of about 1-5 cm from the bee of the said vessel.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention a rectangular culture vessel useful for rooting of micro shoots made up of polypropylene with length, breadth and height in the ratio of 2:1 : 0.8 may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the housing selected with any appropriate size may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention vessel made up of a nontoxic stable material selected from the group consisting of a metal, glass, wood, polypropylene, polystyrene and polycarbonate may be used.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the lid made up of a nontoxic material selected from the group consisting of glass, polypropylene, polystyrene and polycarbonate, permitting light to reach the growing microshoots may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention airtight lid attached on the hinges with the vessel or fitted directly or even screwed up may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention a perforated platform made up of any nontoxic stable material selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, wood, glass and enamel may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention a culture vessel with perforated aluminium platform having holes of 2 cm diameter with row to row distance of 2 cm may be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention a culture vessel with perforated aluminium platform having holes with row to row distance of 2 cm may be used<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention a culture vessel with perforated platform placed at a height of 3 cm from the base may be used.<br>
The main advantages of present invention are:<br>
1.	Rooting could be induced at mass scale.<br>
2.	It proved to be economical as quantity of medium used is much less.<br>
3.	Elimination of agar resulted in substantial savings in cost.<br>
4.	Ease of operation because of large sized vessel with perforated platform.<br>
5.	Damage to roots is minimized as rooted plantlets can be easily pulled out.<br><br><br><br><br>

cm from the base with perforated platform(l) having holes of 1-3 cm diameter with<br>
row to row distance of 2-3 cm housed in the said vessel at a distance of about 1-5 cm<br>
from the bee of the said vessel.<br>
2.	A culture vessel as claimed in claim 1 wherein the housing used is preferably a<br>
rectangular one with length, breadth and height in the ratio of 2:1:0.8.<br>

from metal, glass, wood, polypropylene, polystyrne and polycarbonate.<br>
5.	A culture vessel as claimed in claims 1-4 wherein the lid is made up of a nontoxic<br>
material selected from glass, polypropylene, polystyrene and polycarbonate, permitting<br>
light to reach the growing micro shoots.<br>
6.	A culture vessel as claimed in claims 1-5 wherein perforated platform is made up of<br>
any nontoxic stable material selected from polypropylene, wood, glass and enamel.<br>
7.	A culture vessel as claimed in claims 1-7 wherein perforated platform used has holes<br>
preferably with 2 cm diameter.<br>
8.	A culture vessel as claimed in claims 1-8 wherein holes on perorated platform,<br>
preferably have row to row distance of 2 cm.<br>
9.	A culture vessel for efficient rooting of micro shoots as herein described with reference<br>
to Fig. 1 of the drawing accompanying the specifications.<br></td>
