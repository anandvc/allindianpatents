				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TREATING GAS<br>
FOR DELIVERY TO AN ANIMAL<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 09/081,186, filed<br>
May 19,1998, entitled "Method and Apparatus for Conditioning Gas for Medical<br>
Procedures Having Humidity Monitoring and Recharge Alert," the entirety of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to treating gases delivered into body cavities, spaces or body<br>
surfaces of an animal. More specifically, it relates to a device for, and method of, treating<br>
gases with one or more agents to be carried by the gas stream to an animal.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
The delivery of gas into the body of a patient is well known for many purposes.<br>
Gas is delivered into a body cavity, such as the abdomen, to distend a compliant surface or<br>
create pressure for a specific purpose. Distention of the abdomen using gas creates a<br>
pneumoperitoneum that achieves a space in which one can examine, repair, remove and<br>
surgically manipulate. The space created by gas insufflation is a basic component of<br>
laparoscopic surgery. Within the space of the body created by the gas flow and pressure,<br>
tissue surfaces and organs can be visualized safely and instruments placed that are used for<br>
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Examples of such uses include, but are not limited to,<br>
coagulation, incision, grasping, clamping, suturing, stapling, moving, retracting and<br>
morcelizing. The quality of the gas stream can be modified and conditioned by filtering,<br>
heating and hydrating. U.S. Patent No. 5,411,474 and the aforementioned U.S. patent<br>
application disclose methods for conditioning gas in this manner.<br>
There is room for further improvement and advancement. During a procedure that<br>
instills gas to a body cavity, body space or body surface, the addition of pharmacologically<br>
active or inert materials (organic or inorganic) can enhance tissue healing, reduce infection,<br>
reduce adhesion formation, modify the immunologic response, treat specific disease<br>
processes, reduce pain and assist in diagnosis. It is desirable to provide an apparatus and<br>
method suitable for treating gas in such a manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for treating gas<br>
with one or more agents for delivery to a body cavity, body space or body surface. The gas<br>
is received into the apparatus from a gas source. The apparatus comprises a housing<br>
defining at least one chamber having an entry port and an exit port, the entry port for<br>
receiving a gas stream from a gas source. A quantity of one or more agents is released into<br>
the chamber to be admixed in the gas stream that is delivered to the animal by a delivery<br>
device. The gas stream is optionally humidified and/or heated in the housing.<br>
The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more readily apparent when reference is made to the following description taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Definitions<br>
As used in the claims, "a" can mean one or more.<br>
As used herein, "a predetermined temperature" or "a predetermined temperature<br>
range" is one that has been preset or programmed by the user during a procedure. For<br>
example a desirable temperature range may be physiological body temperature, i.e.,<br>
approximately 35-40 C. As explained hereinafter, the temperature of the gas may be<br>
adjusted by a "dial" type or other similar adjustment.<br>
As used herein, the term "humidifying solution" means water, normal saline,<br>
lactated Ringers, any buffered or unbuffered liquid or solution, an aqueous solution, a non-<br>
water based solution, a combination of water or non-water solutions and other substances,<br>
or a gel substance containing water or non-water solutions and other substances.<br>
As used herein, the term "agent" means any organic substance, inorganic substance,<br>
inert or biologically active substance or pharmacologic material, that may effect or enhance<br>
tissue healing, reduce infection, reduce adhesions formation, modify the immunologic<br>
response, treat specific disease processes, reduce pain or be used for any therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic purpose. This includes materials in solid, liquid or gas phase, and materials that<br>
are water (aqueous) based, colloid and non-colloid suspensions, mixtures, solutions,<br>
hydrogels, lypholized materials, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, anionic, cationic, surface active<br>
agents, surgical adjuvants, anticoagulants, antibiotics, immunologic stimulators,<br>
immunologic suppressants, growth inhibitors, grow stimulators, diagnostic materials,<br>
anesthetic agents, analgesic agents, and materials by themselves or dissolved or based in<br>
other materials, such as, but not limited to, alcohols, ethers, esters, lipids and solvents. The<br>
agent can be dry, such as in a powder form. Any material that can be carried by the flow of<br>
gas into a body cavity or onto a surface for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes can be<br>
delivered in accordance with this invention. It is not intended to limit the present invention<br>
to the above examples of agents. Furthermore, the gas stream may be treated with any type<br>
or combination of agents in accordance with the present invention. An example is to treat<br>
the gas stream with a humidifying solution for hydration to prevent dessication, an<br>
antibiotic to reduce infection, an anti-inflammatory to reduce inflammation and an anti-<br>
adhesive to reduce adhesions and improve healing. Agents such as those sold under the<br>
trademarks Adept manufactured by ML Laboratories, Adcon manufactured by Gliatech and<br>
Atrisol manufactured by Atrix Laboratories can be used to reduce adhesions.<br>
As used herein, the term "gas" includes any gas or combination or mixture of gases<br>
in any proportion that occurs naturally or can be manufactured or placed or created in a<br>
container.<br>
The term "treating" used in connection with treating of the gas stream means to<br>
inject or release one or more agents into the gas stream so that the gas stream is a fume or<br>
dust in the case of a solid phase agent, or a mist or spray in the case of a liquid phase agent.<br>
In some embodiments, such as where the agent is in liquid form, the agent is wicked off or<br>
dislodged from a container. In other cases, the agent is injected or released into the gas<br>
stream. In general, the gas stream to be treated with one or more agents is also humidified.<br>
The terms "cavity" or "space" mean any body cavity or space including the<br>
abdomen, plural cavity, knee space, shoulder space, eye ball, stomach and lung.<br>
The basic tenet of the present invention is to treat a flowing gas stream with one or<br>
more agents so that the agent(s) actively or passively are injected into the gas stream and<br>
are made part of the gas stream as a result of the dynamics of flow, vapor pressure and/or<br>
rate of evaporation. The gas stream thereby is modified to contain additives that are<br>
determined desirable by the user for purposes of enhancing the outcome of a gas delivery<br>
event in connection with, for example, a particular treatment or diagnostic procedure.<br>
The term "body surface" means any surface of the body, whether internal or<br>
external, and whether exposed naturally or by way of surgical procedure.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the apparatus for treating or conditioning gas is shown<br>
generally at reference numeral 100. The apparatus 100 is adapted to receive gas from a gas<br>
regulator 10 (high or low pressure, high or low flow rate), such as an insufflator. The<br>
apparatus comprises a gas treater 120, an optional filter 110 and an optional control module<br>
140. Tubes arc provided to connect the various components of the apparatus together.<br>
Specifically, a first tube segment 160 connects the outlet of the gas regulator 10 to the inlet<br>
tubing of the filter 110 via a male Luer lock 166 or any appropriate adapter compatible<br>
with the insufflator outlet port. A second tube segment 162 connects the outlet of the filter<br>
110 to the inlet of the gas treater 120. A third tube segment 164 connects the outlet of the<br>
gas treater 120 by a male Luer lock 168 (or other appropriate fitting adapter) to a gas<br>
delivery device (not shown), such as a trocar, verres needle, endoscope or a tube that enters<br>
a body cavity or space that delivers the treated gas into the body of a annual.<br>
Alternatively, if the gas is to be delivered to a body surface, the gas delivery device may be<br>
shaped, formed or otherwise configured to direct or spread the flow of gas onto a surface.<br>
The tubing of the tube segments 160, 162 and 164 is preferably flexible and<br>
sufficiently long to permit the gas regulator 10 and control module 140 to be placed at a<br>
convenient distance from a animal undergoing procedure requiring gas delivery. For<br>
applications of the apparatus 100 where the temperature of the gas stream should be within<br>
a desired range when delivered, the gas treater 120 is preferably placed immediately<br>
adjacent to that location where the gas is to be delivered.<br>
The filter 110 is an optional element and consists of a high efficiency, hydrophobic<br>
filter (for example, Gelman Sciences Metricel M5PTJ025) having a pore size preferably<br>
small enough to exclude all solid particles and bacterial or fungal agents that may have<br>
been generated in a gas supply cylinder or the gas regulator 10 (i.e., 0.5 micron or less and<br>
preferably about 0.3 micron). A preferable filter is a hydrophobic filter, such as a glass<br>
fiber-type filter, e.g., Metrigard by Gelman Sciences or Porous Media Ultraphobic filter,<br>
model DDDF 4700 M02K-GB. Other suitable filters include polysulfone (Supor, HT<br>
Tuffrin, Gelman Sciences) and mixed cellulose esters (GN-6 Metricel, Gelman Sciences),<br>
for example. Decreasing the pore size of filter 110 below 0.1 micron causes a concomitant<br>
increase in pressure drop of gas, and thus flow rate is reduced significantly. If the<br>
procedure to be performed requires a relatively high pressure and/or flow rate of gas to the<br>
animal, such as laparoscopy, the pore size should preferably not decrease below 0.2<br>
micron. A hydrophobic filter is preferable to a hydrophilic one, as a hydrophobic filter is<br>
less likely to tear under water pressure caused by accidentally suctioning or syphoning<br>
peritoneal or irrigation fluids.<br>
In some applications, it is desirable that the gas treater 120 be connected<br>
immediately adjacent to a gas delivery device so that the gas travels a minimum distance<br>
from the outlet of the gas treater 120 to the conduit or connection to the interior of a<br>
animal. The purpose of this arrangement is to allow gas to be delivered to the animal while<br>
still at a temperature and water content or within a temperature range sufficiently close to<br>
the physiological interior body temperature or other body surface. That is, for some<br>
applications, the apparatus according to the invention prevents thermodynamic cooling of<br>
gases in transit to the animal, because it provides a highly efficient treatment chamber that,<br>
as a result of its efficiency, can be quite compact and thus be positioned very near to the<br>
animal.<br>
The control module 140 is contained within an electrical housing 210 and is<br>
connected to the gas treater 120 by several wire pairs contained within an insulated<br>
electrical cable 170. In particular, the cable 170 has a connector 172 at one end that<br>
electrically connects into a circuit connector 212 of the housing 210 for the control module<br>
140, and at the other end it is electrically connected to the gas treater 120 by a sealed<br>
electrical feedthrough 174. The cable 170 is attached to the tube segment 162 by aplastic<br>
tape or clip 176. Alternatively, the cable 170 is attached to the tube segment 162 by heat<br>
seal, extrusion, ultrasonic welding, glue or is passed through the interior of tube segment<br>
162.<br>
The control module 140 and associated components in the gas treater 120 are<br>
preferably powered by an AC-DC converter 180. The AC-DC converter 180 has an output<br>
that is connected by a plug connector 182 into a power receptacle 214 of the circuit within<br>
the control module 140, and has a standard AC wall outlet plug 184 that can be plugged<br>
into standard AC power outlets. For example, the AC-DC converter 180 is plugged into an<br>
AC power strip that is provided on other equipment in an operating room. Alternatively,<br>
electrical power for the apparatus is provided by a battery or photovoltaic source. Another<br>
alternative is to provide circuitry in the control module 140 that operates on AC signals, as<br>
opposed to DC signals, in which case the control module 140 could be powered directly by<br>
an AC outlet. The control module 140 and the heating and hydrating components inside<br>
the gas treater 120 will be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
In some embodiments, the gas treater 120 has a charging port 190 that is capable of<br>
receiving a supply of an agent and/or humidifying solution. For example, a syringe 200<br>
containing a predetermined volume ofliquid-based agent is introduced into the charging<br>
port 190 to inject it into the gas treater 120 for an initial charge or re-charge thereof. The<br>
apparatus 100 may be sold with the gas treater 120 pre-charged with a supply of an agent<br>
and/or humidifying solution such that an initial charge is not required for operation.<br>
Turning to Figure 2, the gas treater 120 will be described in greater detail. The gas<br>
treater 120 comprises a housing 122 having an (entry port) gas inlet 124 and an (exit port)<br>
gas outlet 126. The bousing 122 defines a chamber 128 that contains a treatment<br>
subchamber for treating the gas supplied through the inlet with an agent, and in some<br>
embodiments, contains elements for substantially simultaneously heating and hydrating<br>
(humidifying), as well as means 136 for sensing the temperature of the gas and means 138<br>
for sensing the relative humidity of the gas as it exits the chamber 128.<br>
Specifically, in the embodiment of Figure 2, within the chamber 128, there is<br>
provided a subchamber that comprises one or more layers of liquid-retaining or absorbing<br>
padding or sponge material, shown at reference numerals 130, 131 and 132. It should be<br>
understood that the number, spacing and absorbency of the liquid-retaining layers 130,131<br>
and 132 varies according to specific applications. Three layers are shown as an example.<br>
The material of the layers 130, 131 and 132 can be any desirable liquid-retaining or<br>
absorbent material, such as a rayon/polyester formed fabric (e.g., NU GAUZE™,<br>
manufactured and sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, Inc.). The pore size of the selected<br>
material should be chosen according to a balance of liquid-retaining capabilities and low<br>
pressure drop considerations. The larger the pore size, the greater the liquid retention<br>
capability for gas contact for aerosolizing the gas.<br>
Other forms of the treatment subchamber may consist of a subcontainer or<br>
subchamber of liquid within the chamber 128 (without absorbent layers) having a semi-<br>
permeable membrane on opposite ends to allow gas to pass therethrough. The agent in the<br>
chamber is optionally heated by a heating jacket placed around the chamber.<br>
The heating means in the gas treater 120 consists of at least one heating element<br>
134 positioned in the housing, such as between the absorbent layers 130 and 131. The<br>
heating element 134 is an electrically resistive wire, for example. The heating element 134<br>
is placed preferably between absorbent layers or en-meshed within the layers of material<br>
(in the fabric). The heating element 134 heats the gas supplied through the inlet, under<br>
control of a heat control signal supplied by the control module 140, substantially<br>
simultaneous with the treatment of the gas as the gas passes through the chamber 128.<br>
Additional heating elements may be disposed within the chamber.<br>
In order to sense the temperature and humidity of the gas as it exits the gas treater<br>
120, a temperature sensor 136 and a relative humidity sensor 138 are provided. The<br>
temperature sensor 136 may be provided anywhere within the flow of gas in the chamber<br>
128, but is preferably positioned on the downstream side of the heating element 134<br>
between liquid-retaining layers. The temperature sensor 136 is a thermistor (for example,<br>
Thermometries MA100 Series chip thermistor, or Thermometries Series BR23,<br>
Thermometries, Inc., Edison, New Jersey). It is preferable that the temperature sensor 136<br>
be accurate to within about 0.2 °C. In the present invention, the temperature of the gas is<br>
preferably sensed after the gas has been treated (and optionally humidified) so that any<br>
change in the temperature of the gas as it is treated is corrected at mat point in the<br>
apparatus, thereby compensating for enthalpy changes.<br>
The humidity sensor 138 is positioned in the flow path of gas exiting the chamber<br>
128, preferably downstream from the heating element 134 either between liquid-retaining<br>
layers or on the downstream side of the absorbent layers, proximate the exit port 126 of the<br>
housing 122. The humidity sensor 138 is preferably not in contact with a layer. Figure 2<br>
shows the humidity sensor 138 distal to the absorbent layers, separated from the liquid-<br>
retaining layer 132 by a porous mesh (plastic or metal) layer 133 that extends across the<br>
interior of the housing 122. The humidity sensor 138 actually is generally not in contact the<br>
porous mesh layer 133, but is spaced therefrom as well. The humidity sensor 138 is, in one<br>
embodiment, a humidity-sensitive capacitor sensor, such as a capacitive humidity sensor<br>
manufactured by Philips Corporation, which changes capacitance in response to humidity<br>
changes. The humidity sensor 138 measures the relative humidity of the gas as it passes<br>
through the chamber 128 to enable monitoring of the gas humidity, and in order to provide<br>
an indication of the amount of humidifying solution remaining in the gas treater 120, i.e.,<br>
in layers 130, 131 and 132. As will be explained hereinafter, in one embodiment, a<br>
timer/divider integrated circuit (IC) 145 (Figure 5), is connected to the humidity sensor 138<br>
and is preferably disposed within the housing 122 together and substantially co-located<br>
with the humidity sensor 138.<br>
One way to treat a gas stream with one or more agents using the embodiment of the<br>
gas treater 120 shown in Figure 2 is to inject from a syringe 200 a liquid-based agent into<br>
the chamber 128 through the charging port 190 for absorption onto one of the layers 130-<br>
132. When the gas stream flows over the layers 130-132, the gas stream will become<br>
treated with agent and thereby carry the agent out of the gas treater 120 into a animal.<br>
Depending on the dimensions and type of absorbent pad or pads used, there is a capacity to<br>
the amount of agent that can be introduced into the chamber 128. The size of the chamber<br>
128 can be increased to allow for larger pads, and therefore greater capacity.<br>
Several additional embodiments of the invention will now be described in<br>
conjunction with Figures 3-9, and 12-15. In these embodiments, other configurations of<br>
the housing 122 of the gas treater 120 are described that are useful to treat the gas stream<br>
flowing through the gas treater housing 122 with one or more agents. These embodiments<br>
show different types of containers for containing an agent and releasing it into the gas<br>
stream in a chamber of the gas treater 120.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate an embodiment for the gas treater housing 122 featuring<br>
multiple chambers, for example, three chambers 128A, 128B and 128C that extend a<br>
certain length portion (not necessarily all) of the housing 122. These chambers are<br>
separated by walls or partitions 202, 204 and 206. Associated with each chamber 128A,<br>
128B and 128C is a charging port 190A, 190B and 190C, respectively to receive a supply<br>
of agent from a respective source, such as an external bag, syringe, etc. The agent is<br>
delivered under pressure into a chamber through its respective charging port, or is wicked<br>
off from a small opening of a bag (FIGs. 5 and 6) placed through the charging port into a<br>
chamber. Alternatively, within each chamber 128A, 128B and 128C is one or more<br>
absorbent pads or layers similar to that shown in Figure 2, onto which a quantity of an<br>
agent is absorbed. Still a further alternative is to provide a separate semi-permeable<br>
membrane in each chamber filled with a different agent.<br>
Each of the chambers can be charged with a different agent. For example, chamber<br>
128A may be charged with a humidifying solution, chamber 128B may be charged with<br>
agent A and chamber 128C may be charged with agent B. Though not shown in Figures 3<br>
and 4, it should be understood that the heating elements, temperature sensor and humidity<br>
sensor shown in Figure 2 may optionally be included in their various configurations in the<br>
embodiment of the housing shown in Figures 3 and 4. In the embodiment of Figures 3 and<br>
4, when the gas stream flows through the housing 122, the gas stream wicks off or<br>
dislodges the humidifying solution from chamber 128A, is mixed with agent A from<br>
chamber 128B and is mixed with agent B from chamber 128C. Thus, the gas stream that<br>
exits the housing 120 is hydrated and treated with the agents, for delivery to an animal.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate another embodiment where the agents to be carried by the<br>
gas stream are contained within bags. In Figure 5, there are, for example, two bags 220<br>
and 230 each of which are to contain a quantity of an agent. The apparatus may be snipped<br>
with the bags 220 and 230 pre-loaded or pre-charged with a quantity of agents, or they may<br>
be filled with a quantity of agents prior to use. The bags 220 and 230 are formed of<br>
flexible material such as, polyethylene or other similar material. In one configuration, the<br>
bags 220 and 230 are formed of a semi-permeable membrane material such that the agent<br>
contained therein can be wicked off by the flowing gas stream over the surface of the bags<br>
through the housing 122. In another configuration, at the end of each bag 220 and 230<br>
inside the housing 122 is a restrictive orifice, nozzle or hole 222 and 232, respectively,<br>
such as a spray hole or atomizer hole to allow for contact with the gas stream to be<br>
admixed therewith. At the other end of each bag 220 and 230 is an optional charging port<br>
224 and 234, respectively, to allow the introduction of a quantity of an agent into the bags<br>
220 and 230. Openings are made in the housing 122 to allow a length of the bags 220 and<br>
230 to pass therethrough and into the chamber.<br>
As the bags are filled, they expand inside the chamber 128. The pressure of the<br>
quantity of agent in the bags 220 and 230 and/or capillary action at the holes 222 and 232<br>
forces the agent to drip out of the holes 222 and 232 to be wicked off or dislodged by the<br>
flowing gas stream through the chamber 128 and carried out of the exit port of the housing<br>
122. In the configuration where the bags 220 and 230 are formed of a semi-permeable<br>
membrane material, the pressure of the quantity of agent in the bags facilitates the wieking<br>
off of the agent through the membrane. The bags 220 and 230 are deployed within the<br>
chamber 128 so that when they are filled, they expand and are substantially confined to a<br>
predetermined region of the chamber so as not to interfere with gas flow over the other<br>
bag. For example, a heating coil 124 or an absorbent pad can be used to separate the bags<br>
220 and 230 in the chamber 128.<br>
Figure 5 shows only two bags 220 and 230, but it should be understood that one or<br>
any number of bags may be suitable depending on the number of agents to be carried by<br>
the gas stream.<br>
Figure 6 shows a variation of the embodiment of Figure 5 wherein the bags 220 and<br>
230 are located on the outside or exterior of the bousing 122. In this configuration,<br>
openings are made in the housing 122 and the hoJes 222 and 232 of the bags are located<br>
just inside the housing 122 at these openings. The agents bead out of the holes 222 and<br>
232 and are wicked off or dislodged by the flowing gas stream through the chamber 128.<br>
In addition, there will be a natural tendency for the agent in the bags 220 and 230 to enter<br>
the flowing gas stream from the holes 222 and 232 due to the change in vapor pressure.<br>
Because the gas stream is relatively dry and by contrast, the agent in the bags 220 and 230<br>
may have some degree of moisture, a natural mechanism occurs by which the moist agent<br>
will wick out of the bags in an attempt to reach a vapor pressure equilibrium. The greater<br>
the rate of flow of the gas stream, the less of the agent in the bags 220 and 230 that will<br>
bead into the gas stream. The same theory of operation applies to the embodiment of<br>
Figure 5.<br>
Even if deployed on the outside of the housing 122, the bags 220 and 230 can be<br>
filled through their respective charging ports 224 and 234 in the same manner as described<br>
in conjunction with Figure 5. The number of bags may vary on a particular application,<br>
and two are shown in Figures 5 and 6 only as an example. All other features concerning<br>
the heating, humidification and sensing in the housing 122 are applicable to the<br>
embodiments shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
A still further variation on the embodiments of Figures 5 and 6 is to provide the<br>
optional tubing member 250 that extends from a bag to an optional absorbent pad 130 that<br>
is positioned within the housing 122.<br>
Further embodiments for deploying one or more agents into the gas stream are<br>
shown in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows an elongated tubing member 300 that is<br>
disposed in the chamber 128 of the housing 122. The tubing member 300 is extremely<br>
long and winds throughout the chamber 128; Figure 7 is over-simplified in this respect.<br>
The tubing member 300 is, for example, a polyimide tubing product manufactured by<br>
MicroLumen of Tampa, Florida. The important characteristics of the tubing material are<br>
that the sides or walls of the tubing member 300 be as thin as possible so that the volume<br>
of agent that the tubing member 300 can carry is maximized. At the tip or end of the<br>
tubing member 300 is a restrictive orifice or hole 310 through which the agent may bead<br>
and be wicked off or dislodged into the gas stream in the chamber 128. If multiple types of<br>
agents are to be delivered into the gas stream, then multiple tubing members each<br>
containing a different agent is provided. A charging port 312 is also provided on the<br>
proximal end of the tubing member 300 just outside the housing 122 to supply a quantity<br>
of the agent into the tubing member 300.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a variation of the embodiment shown in Figure 7, wherein a<br>
tubing member 400 is provided that includes one or a plurality of holes or perforations 410<br>
along the length of the tubing member 400 through which the agent is allowed to release<br>
into the chamber 128. The gas stream flowing through the chamber 128 will wick off or<br>
dislodge the agent from the holes 410 and carry the agent in the gas stream. The tubing<br>
member 400 has a charging port 412 similar to charging port 300 for tubing member 300.<br>
Also, multiple tubing members 400 may be provided in the chamber to release multiple<br>
types of agents into the gas stream. The length of each tubing member 400 and the<br>
quantity and size of the holes 412 therein may be selected to control the rate at which<br>
different agents from different tubing members 400 are wicked off or dislodged by the gas<br>
stream flowing through the chamber 128.<br>
In the embodiments shown in Figures 2-8, the size of the chamber 128 of the gas<br>
treater housing 122 may vary depending on the intended use, gas flow, type of agent,<br>
whether and how many absorbent pads are provided, etc. There is no limit, either relative<br>
small, or relatively large, to the size of the chamber for purposes of carrying out the present<br>
invention.<br>
Turning to Figure 9, yet another embodiment is shown wherein an inkjet printhcad<br>
cartridge 500 is used to release vapor bubbles containing a quantity of one or more agents<br>
into the chamber 128 of the bousing 122. The inkjet printhead cartridge 500 may be one of<br>
any known inkjet printheads such as those used in inkjet printers sold by Hewlett-Packard,<br>
Canon, etc.<br>
As is well known in the art, an inkjet printhead cartridge, such as that shown at<br>
reference numeral 500, comprises a reservoir 510, a printhead 520 and a plurality of<br>
contact pads 530. Conductive traces in the cartridge 500 are terminated by the contact pads<br>
530. The contact pads are designed to normally interconnect with a printer so that the<br>
contact pads 530 contact printer electrodes that provide externally generated energization<br>
signals to the printhead 520 to spray ink onto paper. Thermal inkjet printheads create<br>
vapor bubbles by elevating the ink temperature, at the surface of a plurality of heaters, to a<br>
superheat limit. This same process can be used to create vapor bubbles of one or more<br>
agents. The printhead 520 comprises a plurality of nozzles 522 from which the vapor<br>
bubbles are released when heaters are energized to heat the quantity of agent contained in<br>
the reservoir.<br>
According to the present invention, the inkjet printhead cartridge 500 is connected<br>
to a control circuit 600 by way of connector 610 having contacts to match the contact pads<br>
530. The control circuit 600 may be contained within the control module 140 shown in<br>
Figure 1 and coupled to the cartridge 500 by one or more electrical conductors contained in<br>
the electrical cable 170. The reservoir 510 is filled with a quantity or volume of one or<br>
more agents to be released into the chamber 128. For example, a color inkjet printhead<br>
cartridge contains multiple chambers or reservoirs for each of three colors of ink. Using<br>
this same type of device, an inkjet printhead cartridge may contain a quantity or volume of<br>
several different agents to be separately or simultaneously delivered into the chamber in<br>
controlled amounts. The control circuit 600 generates appropriate control signals that are<br>
coupled to the cartridge 500 via the connector 610 to drive the heaters in the printhead 520<br>
and release vapor bubbles of one or more agents into the chamber from the nozzles 522.<br>
When the one or more agents are released into the chamber 128, the gas stream that<br>
flows through the chamber and carries the agent out the exit port of the housing 122 and<br>
into the animal. Each of the different agents can be released into the chamber 128 at<br>
different rates or volumes. Furthermore, it is possible that a different inkjet printhead<br>
i cartridge is provided for each of separate subchambers inside chamber 128 to keep the<br>
agents from mixing for a period of time before delivered into the animal.<br>
Referring back to Figure 2, electrical connections to the components inside the<br>
housing 122 of the gas treater 120 are as follows. A ground or reference lead (not<br>
specifically shown) is provided that is connected to each of the temperature sensor 136,<br>
heating element 134 and humidity sensor 138-timer/divider 145. A wire 175 (for a positive<br>
lead) electrically connects to the heating element 134 and a wire 176 (for a positive lead)<br>
electrically connects to the temperature sensor 136. In addition, three wires 177A, 177B<br>
and 177C electrically connect to the humidity sensor 138-timer divider circuitry, wherein<br>
wire 177A carries a DC voltage to the timer/divider 145, wire 177B carries an enable<br>
signal to the timer/divider 145, and wire 177C carries an output signal (data) from the<br>
timer/divider 145. All of the wires are fed from the insulated cable 170 into the<br>
feedthrough 174 and through small holes in the housing 122 into the chamber 128. The<br>
feedthrough 174 is sealed at the opening 178 around the cable 170.<br>
The charging port 190 is attached to a lateral extension 139 of the housing 122.<br>
The charging port 190 comprises a cylindrical body 192 containing a resealablc member<br>
194. The resealable member 194 permits a syringe or similar device to be inserted<br>
therethrough, but seals around the exterior of the syringe tip. This allows a volume of<br>
liquid agent or humidifying solution to be delivered into the chamber 128 without releasing<br>
the liquid already contained therein. The resealable member 194 is, for example, Baxter<br>
Interlink™ injection site 2N3379. Alternatively, the charging port may be embodied by a<br>
one-way valve, a scalable port, a screw cap, a cap with a slit to permit the introduction of a<br>
syringe or other device, such as a Safeline™ injection site, part number NF9100,<br>
manufactured by B. Braun Medical Inc., or any other covering material or member capable<br>
of permitting the introduction of a syringe and preventing the backflow of contained liquid<br>
or gas. The control module 140 will issue a warning when the humidity of the gas being<br>
treated by the gas treater 120 drops below a predetermined or user programmable relative<br>
humidity, as explained hereinafter.<br>
As an alternative, or in addition to the sensing and monitoring features described<br>
above, a backup or reserve supply container for liquid agent and/or humidifying solution is<br>
provided. Referring back to Figure 1, one form of a backup supply container is a container<br>
800 that hangs free of the apparatus 100 and is connected with an access tubing 810 to the<br>
charging port 190. The container 800 is, for example, a bag such as an intravenous fluid<br>
bag and the access tubing 810 is a intravenous type tubing.<br>
Another form of a backup supply container is a container 850 that attaches to a<br>
portion of the apparatus 100. For example, the container 850 is a reservoir tube, bag,<br>
syringe or tank that is attached to the tubing segment 162 or is strapped or fastened to the<br>
tubing segment 162 close to the gas treater 120. Another alternative would be to strap or<br>
fasten it to the outside of the housing 122 of the gas treater 120. The container 850 is<br>
connected to an access tubing 860 that connects into the charging port 190, similar to<br>
access tubing 810 described above.<br>
Access tubing 810 and 860 have a penetrating member (not shown) at their distal<br>
ends to penetrate the charging port 190 to gain access to the chamber 128 of the gas treater<br>
housing 122. Alternatively, instead of the access tubing 860, the container 850 has at the<br>
end proximate the charging port 190 a tip member similar to that of the syringe 200 to<br>
penetrate and directly couple to the charging port 190.<br>
The containers 800 and 850 can be pre-charged or charged prior to use according to<br>
techniques well known in the art. For example, container 850 has an injection site 862 to<br>
enable injection of liquid into the container 850.<br>
Preferably, the access tubing 810 or 860 of the backup supply containers 800 and<br>
850, respectively, (or the integral penetrating tip of the container 850) extend far enough<br>
through the charging port 190 so as to make contact with one of the layers 130-132 so that<br>
the liquid therein is wicked off onto one of the layers 130-132 due to capillary forces.<br>
Alternatively, the access tubing 810 or 860 (or integral penetrating tip of the container 850)<br>
stops short of one of the layers 130-132, and the pressure differential created by the<br>
flowing gas stream through the housing 122 will wick off the liquid agent and/or<br>
humidifying solution from the end of these members to contribute to the treatment of the<br>
gas.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, another variation is to provide an extension tube 870<br>
that leads from the charging port 190 where the access tubing 810 or 860 (or the integral<br>
penetrating tip member of the container 850) terminates, to the treatment subchamber<br>
inside the chamber 128, i.e., to contact one or more of the layers 130-132. Liquid agent<br>
and/or humidifying solution is continuously wicked out from the end of the extension tube<br>
870 onto one of the layers 130-132.<br>
In either form of the backup supply container, the basic principle is the same. The<br>
backup supply container provides is coupled through the charging port 190 to the treatment<br>
subchamber inside the chamber 128 to constantly replenish the treatment subchamber, e.g.,<br>
one or more of the layers 130, 131 or 132. Consequently, the treatment subchamber will<br>
have an initial amount of liquid agent and/or humidifying solution (pre-charged or charged<br>
prior to use) and a backup supply from the backup supply container is constantly supplied<br>
to the treatment subchamber to constantly replenish it as gas flows through the chamber.<br>
The overall time of sufficient gas humidification and/or treatment is thereby lengthened to<br>
a duration that is suitable for all or nearly all gas delivery applications. As a result, there is<br>
no need to be concerned about decreasing humidity of the gas delivered. The backup<br>
supply container acts a backup to provide gas humidification and/or treatment for an entire<br>
procedure. Therefore, some forms of the apparatus 100 need not include the humidity and<br>
temperature sensing and monitoring features, or the recharge alert, described herein. These<br>
features provide another type of backup that may be useful in certain applications, instead<br>
of, or in addition to the backup supply container.<br>
The desirable width and diameter of the gas treater is dependent upon many factors,<br>
including the intended use, the rate of gas flow from the gas source and the pressure<br>
desired to be maintained, which is affected more by the diameter of chamber 128 than by<br>
its length. A person of ordinary skill in the art, given the teachings and examples herein,<br>
can readily determine suitable dimensions for chamber 128 without undue<br>
experimentation. It should also be noted, however, that upon activating the apparatus or<br>
changing the demand on the apparatus (e.g., flow rate or pressure), there is a lag time of<br>
only several tenths seconds for sensing the temperature of gas and adjusting the heating<br>
element to achieve the proper gas or desired temperature. Such a fast start-up time is<br>
extremely beneficial.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the heating element 134 is shown in more detail. The<br>
heating element 134 is an electrically resistive wire that is disposed in the housing 128 in a<br>
concentrical coil configuration having a number of turns, such as 6 - 8 turns. Alternatively,<br>
a second heating element 134' is provided that is arranged with respect to the heating<br>
element 134 such that its coils are offset from those of the first heating element, relative to<br>
the direction of gas flow through the chamber. If two or more heating elements are<br>
employed, they are preferably spaced from each other in the chamber of the gas treater by<br>
approximately 3-4 mm. The first and second heating elements 134 and 134' can be coiled<br>
in opposite directions relative to each other. This arrangement allows for maximum<br>
contact of the gas flowing through the chamber with a heating element. Other non-coiled<br>
configurations of the heating element 134 are also suitable.<br>
Turning to Figure 11, another feature of the gas treater 120 is illustrated. At the<br>
inlet and/or outlet of the housing 122, fluted surfaces 123 may be provided to facilitate<br>
complete dispersion of gas as it is supplied to the gas treater 120. This improves the fluid<br>
dynamics of the gas flow through the chamber 128 to ensure that the gas is uniformly<br>
heated and humidified as it flows through the chamber 128.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 illustrate embodiments of the apparatus to treat the gas stream<br>
with a solid phase agent. Figure 12 shows a container 700 of a solid phase agent, such as<br>
in powder form, that is positioned in the chamber 128 of the gas treater housing 122. The<br>
container 700 includes a check valve 710 and a pressurizer 720, such as a carbon dioxide<br>
cartridge. When the pressurizer 720 is activated, pressure inside the container 700 is<br>
caused to rise, such that the bias of the check valve 710 is overcome, releasing the agent<br>
into the chamber 128. A button 730 on the exterior of the housing 122 is coupled by a wire<br>
or other means to the pressurizer 720 to activate it remotely.<br>
Figure 13 shows a container 700 of solid phase agent positioned outside of the<br>
housing 122. The check valve 710 of the container 700 is fed through an opening in the<br>
housing 122 into the chamber 128. The button 730 for activating the pressurizer is<br>
optionally positioned on the exterior of the container 700. Operation of the configuration<br>
shown in Figure 13 is similar to that of Figure 12.<br>
In the embodiments of Figures 12 and 13, the rate at which the solid phase agent is<br>
released into the chamber 128 is dependent upon the pressure created in the container 700<br>
by the pressurizer 720 and the size of the check valve 710. It may be desirable to deliver<br>
short bursts of the solid phase agent into the gas stream, or to deliver it into the gas stream<br>
on a continuous basis. If necessary, a separate backup source of pressure may be coupled<br>
to the container 700 to provide for longer term treatment of the gas stream. In any case, the<br>
gas stream flowing through the housing 122 will carry the solid phase agent with through<br>
the exit port.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, the control module 140 will be described in detail. The<br>
control module 140 contains monitoring circuitry and control circuitry for the apparatus<br>
100. It is understood that some forms of the apparatus 100 need not include the humidity<br>
(and heating) sensing, monitoring, temperature control and recharge alert functions. The<br>
control module 140 comprises a voltage regulator 141, a microcontroller 142, an AID<br>
converter 143, a dual operational amplifier (hereinafter "op-amp") module 144, and a<br>
timer/divider 145. The monitoring circuit portion of the control module 140 consists of the<br>
combination of the microcontroller 142 and timer/divider 145. The control circuit portion<br>
of the control module 140 consists of the microcontroller 142, A/D converter 143 and op-<br>
amp module 144. The monitoring circuit monitors the relative humidity of gas exiting the<br>
chamber based on a signal generated by the timer/divider 145. The control circuit monitors<br>
the temperature of the gas exiting the chamber, and in response, controls electrical power<br>
to the heating element to regulate the temperature of the gas to a user programmable or<br>
fixed temperature or temperature range. While the temperature of the gas exiting the<br>
chamber is actively controlled, the relative humidity of the gas in the chamber is not<br>
actively controlled; rather it is monitored and an alert is generated when it drops below a<br>
corresponding threshold so that appropriate action can be taken, such as replenishing the<br>
gas treater 120 with liquid agent or humidifying solution.<br>
Figure 14 shows that several components are preferably located within the<br>
electrical housing 210 (Figure 1), whereas other components are located within the housing<br>
of the gas treater 120 (Figure 2). In particular, the timer/divider 145 and the associated<br>
resistors R4 and R5 are preferably located inside the housing 122 of the gas treater 120,<br>
together with the humidity sensor 13S in a circuit package that includes the humidity<br>
sensor 138 exposed on one or more surfaces thereof. More specifically, the timer/divider<br>
145 is co-located with humidity sensor 138. This configuration minimizes timing error by<br>
stray wiring inductance and capacitance (sensor kept close to active circuits of<br>
timer/divider 145). In addition, by co-locating the timer/divider 145 and humidity sensor<br>
138, the need for interconnecting wires is eliminated, thereby avoiding undesirable signal<br>
radiation.<br>
The voltage regulator 141 receives as input the DC output of the AC-DC converter<br>
180 (Figure 1), such as for example, 9 V DC, that is suitable for use by the analog<br>
components of the control module. The voltage regulator 141 regulates this voltage to<br>
generate a lower voltage, such as 5 V DC, for use by the digital components of the control<br>
module. The capacitor C1 at the output of the voltage regulator 141 serves to filter out any<br>
AC components, as is well known in the art. Alternatively, a suitable DC voltage is<br>
provided by a battery or photovoltaic source shown at reference numeral 149.<br>
The microcontroller 142 may be a PIC16C84 integrated circuit microcontroller that<br>
controls system operation. A ceramic resonator 146 (4 MHZ) is provided to supply a raw<br>
clock signal to pins 15 and 16 of the microcontroller 142, which uses it to generate a clock<br>
signal for the signal processing functions explained hereinafter.<br>
The op-amp 144 module is coupled (by wire 176) to the temperature sensor 136<br>
(thermistor) mounted in the housing of the gas treater. The op-amp module 144 is, for<br>
example, aLTC1013 dual low-input-offset-voltage operational amplifier integrated circuit<br>
that includes two op-amps, referred to hereinafter as op-amp A and op-amp B. The non-<br>
inverting input of the op-amp A of the op amp module 144 is pin 3, and pin 2 is the<br>
inverting input. The output of op-amp A is pin 1. Op-amp A of the op-amp module 144 is<br>
used to buffer the output voltage of the voltage divider formed by resistors Rl and R2.<br>
The buffered output voltage, referred to as Vx in Figure 14, is applied to op-amp B in the<br>
op-amp module 144. Op-amp B is configured as a non-inverting-with-offset amplifier with<br>
a gain of 21.5, and also receives as input the output of the temperature sensor 136, adjusted<br>
by resistor R3, shown as voltage Vy in the diagram. The output voltage of op-amp B is at<br>
pin 7, referred to as Vo in Figure 14. The output voltage Vo is equal to 21.5Vy - 20.5Vx,<br>
which is inversely proportional to the gas temperature in the housing of the gas treater.<br>
The output voltage Vo ranges between 0 - 5 V DC, depending on the temperature of the<br>
gas in the chamber.<br>
The A/D converter 143 is an ADC 0831 integrated circuit analog-to-digital<br>
converter that receives as input at pin 2, the output Vo of the op-amp module 144. The<br>
A/D converter 143 generates a multi-bit digital word, consisting of 8 bits for example, that<br>
represents the output voltage Vo, and is supplied as output at pin 6, which in rum is<br>
coupled to I/O pin 8 of the microcontroller 142. The microcontroller 142 commands the<br>
A/D converter 143 to output the digital word by issuing a control signal on I/O pin 10<br>
which is coupled to the chip select pin 1 of the A/D converter 143. Moreover, the<br>
microcontroller 142 controls the rate at which the A/D converter 143 outputs the digital<br>
word by supplying a sequence of pulses on pin 9 applied to clock input pin 7 of the A/D<br>
converter 143. The "unbalanced bridge" values of resistors Rl, R2 and R3 are chosen to<br>
produce a 0 - 5 V DC output over gas temperatures from approximately 20° C to<br>
approximately 45° C. Since the bridge and the reference for the A/D converter 143 are<br>
provided by the same 5 V DC source, error due to any reference voltage shift is eliminated.<br>
The timer/divider 145 is, for example, a MC14541 precision timer/divider<br>
integrated circuit. The humidity sensor 138 is connected to pin 2 and to resistors R4 and<br>
R5 as shown. In response to an enable signal output by the microcontroller 142 on pin 12<br>
that is coupled to timer/divider pin 6, the timer/divider 145 generates an output signal that<br>
oscillates at a rate determined by the value of the resistor R4, the capacitance of the<br>
humidity sensor 138 (which varies according to the relative humidity of the gas inside the<br>
gas treater housing) and a predetermined divider constant. For example, the divider<br>
constant is 256. Specifically, the output signal of the timer/divider 145 is a square wave<br>
oscillating between 0 V ("low") and 5 V ("high") at a frequency of approximately<br>
l/[256*2.3*R4t*CJHz, where R4, is, for example, 56 kOhms, and Ct is the capacitance at<br>
some time (t) of the relative humidity sensor 138 depending on the relative humidity of the<br>
gas in the chamber. For example, the humidity sensor manufactured by Phillips<br>
Electronics, referred to above, can measure between 10-90%RH (relative humidity), where<br>
Ct at 43%RH is 122 pF (+/- 15%), with a sensitivity of 0.4 +/- 0.5 pF per 1 %RH. The<br>
output signal of the timer/divider 145 appears at pin 8, which is coupled to the I/O pin 13<br>
of the microcontroller 142. Thus, the timer/divider 145 is essentially an oscillator circuit<br>
connected to the humidity sensor that generates an output signal with a frequency<br>
dependent on a capacitance of the humidity sensor. Any oscillator circuit that can generate<br>
as output a signal whose frequency is dependent on a variable capacitance may be suitable<br>
for the timer/divider 145.<br>
The microcontroller 142 computes a measure of the relative humidity of the gas<br>
inside the gas treater housing by timing or measuring a characteristic of the output signal of<br>
the timer/divider 145. Specifically, microcontroller measures the time duration of one of<br>
the phases of the output signal of the timer/divider 142, such as the "high" phase which is<br>
approximately ½ * [256*2.3*R4,*C]. This time duration is indicative of the relative<br>
humidity of the gas in the chamber of the gas treater since the rate of the oscillation of the<br>
timer/divider depends on the capacitance of the humidity sensor 138, as explained above.<br>
For example, for a change in RH of 10-50% and/or 50 to 90%, there is a 13% change in the<br>
duration of the "high" phase of the timer/divider output signal. The microcontroller 142<br>
monitors the relative humidity of the gas exiting the chamber in this manner and when it<br>
drops below a predetermined or user programmable relative humidity threshold (indicated<br>
by a corresponding predetermined change in the oscillation rate of the timer/divider 145),<br>
the microcontroller 142 generates a signal on pin 17, called a recharge signal, that drives<br>
transistor Q3 to activate an audible alarm device, such as buzzer 147. The buzzer 147<br>
generates an audible sound which indicates that the relative humidity of the gas in the gas<br>
treater has dropped below the predetermined or user programmable threshold and that it is<br>
necessary to recharge the gas treater with liquid agent and/or humidifying solution. The<br>
relative humidity threshold corresponds to a minimum level for a desirable relative<br>
humidity range of the gas exiting the gas treater, and may be 40%, for example. The<br>
relative humidity threshold is an adjustable or programmable parameter in the<br>
microcontroller 142. Optionally, the microcontroller 142 may generate another warning<br>
signal at the output of pin 7 to illuminate an light emitting diode (LED) 148 A, thereby<br>
providing a visual indication of the humidity dropping below the relative humidity<br>
threshold in the gas treater, and the need to recharge the gas treater 120 with liquid agent<br>
and/or humidifying solution. Further, the microcontroller 142 generates a trouble or<br>
warning signal output at pin 6 to drive LED 148B (of a different color than LED 148A, for<br>
example) when there is either a "code fault" in the microcontroller 142 (an extremely<br>
unlikely occurrence) or when the relative humidity of the gas in the gas treater is less than<br>
a critical relative humidity threshold (lower than the relative humidity threshold), such as<br>
10%. In either case, power to the heating element 134 is terminated in response to the<br>
warning signal.<br>
The microcontroller 142 also controls the heating element 134 in order to regulate<br>
the temperature of the gas inside the gas treater. Accordingly, the microcontroller 142<br>
processes the digital word supplied by the A/D converter 143 to determine the temperature<br>
of the gas inside the gas treater housing. In response, the microcontroller 142 generates a<br>
heat control signal on the output pin 11 that drives transistor Ql, which in turn drives the<br>
MOSFET power transistor Q2, that supplies current to the heating element 134. The<br>
temperature of the gas inside the gas treater is regulated by the microcontroller 142 so that<br>
it is substantially at a predetermined or user programmable temperature or within a<br>
predetermined or user programmable temperature range as it exits the gas treater for<br>
delivery into the body of a animal. For laparoscopy procedures, the temperature range that<br>
the gas is regulated to be approximately 35 °- 40°C, but preferably is 37° C when it exits<br>
the Luer lock 168. The control module 140 may include a rheostat or dial-type control to<br>
allow a user to adjust the desired temperature or temperature range of the gas that is<br>
delivered into the animal. As mentioned above, when the relative humidity inside the gas<br>
treater falls below a critical threshold as determined by the monitoring circuit portion of<br>
the control module 140, the control circuit portion in response terminates power to the<br>
heating element 134 to prevent the delivery of warm gas that is extremely dry.<br>
The circuitry for monitoring the relative humidity of the gas can be embodied by<br>
other circuitry well known in the art. In addition, while the control module 140 has been<br>
described as having a single microcontroller 142 for monitoring signals representing<br>
temperature and relative humidity of the gas exiting the chamber, and for controlling the<br>
heating element to control the temperature of the gas, it should be understood that two or<br>
more microcontrollers could be used dedicated to the individual functions. In addition, the<br>
functions of the microcontroller 142 could be achieved by other circuits, such as an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), digital logic circuits, a microprocessor, or a<br>
digital signal processor.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates an alternative embodiment for monitoring relative humidity of<br>
the gas, in which a humidity sensitive resistor is used, instead of a humidity sensitive<br>
capacitor 138. The humidity sensing scheme employing a resistive humidity sensor does<br>
not require the timer/divider circuit 145 shown in Figure 14. The humidity sensitive<br>
resistor 900 is located inside the gas treater housing in a suitable location for sensing the<br>
relative humidity of the gas stream flowing through the gas treater 120. A suitable<br>
humidity sensitive resistor is a model UPS600 resistor by Ohmic, which at 45% RH is<br>
approximately 30.7 k Ohms. A resistor RIO is coupled in a voltage divider configuration<br>
with the humidity sensitive resistor 900. Three pins of the microcontroller 142 couple to<br>
the voltage divider formed by resistor R10 and humidity sensitive resistor 900.<br>
Pin 910 of the microcontroller 142 is coupled to one terminal of the resistor R10,<br>
pin 912 is coupled to one terminal of the humidity sensitive resistor 900 and pin 914 is<br>
coupled to the terminal between the resistor R10 and the humidity sensitive resistor 900.<br>
The humidity sensitive resistor 900 may be a type that requires AC excitation.<br>
Accordingly, the microcontroller 142 excites the humidity sensitive resistor 900 by<br>
applying an alternating pulse, such as a 5 volt pulse, to pins 910 and 912, such that pin 910<br>
is "high" (i.e., at 5 V) for a period of time and pin 912 is "low" (i.e., 0 V), then pin 912 is<br>
"high" for a period of time and pin 910 is low. As a result, the average excitation voltage<br>
to the humidity sensitive resistor 900 is zero. During the time period when pin 910 is<br>
"high", the microcontroller 142 senses the humidity of the gas by determining if the tap<br>
voltage pin 914 is a logic "zero" or a logic "one." If it is a logic zero (low voltage), the<br>
resistance of the humidity sensitive resistor 900 is low, indicating that the relative humidity<br>
of the gas is still high. If it is a logic one (high voltage), then the resistance of the humidity<br>
sensitive resistor 900 is high, indicating that the relative humidity of the gas is low. The<br>
value of the resistor R1O is chosen to yield a transition at pin 914 at a desired humidity<br>
threshold, such as 45% RH, with a 2.5 V transition from a low voltage to a high voltage.<br>
For example, resistor Rl0 is a 30 k Ohm resistor. In the embodiment employing a resistive<br>
humidity sensor, a microcontroller that is suitable is a PIC 16C558 in place of the<br>
microcontroller model referred to above in conjunction with Figure 14. This sensing<br>
scheme can be simplified even further if a relative humidity sensor that allows DC<br>
excitation is used. In this case, only one pin of the microcontroller 142 need be associated<br>
with humidity sensing.<br>
A resistive humidity sensor has certain advantages over a capacitive humidity<br>
sensor. It has been found that the specific type of resistive humidity sensor referred to<br>
above can tolerate immersion in water in the gas treater 120 if a user accidentally over-fills<br>
the gas treater 120. In addition, the sensing scheme using a resistive sensor does not<br>
require a relatively high frequency square wave signal, which may be undesirable in some<br>
environments where the apparatus is used. Finally, the resistive sensor affords better<br>
accuracy for relative humidity sensing in some applications.<br>
Other variations or enhancements to the circuitry shown in Figure 14 are possible.<br>
The type of microcontroller used can be one, such as the PIC16C715, that incorporates the<br>
functions of the A/D converter 143. The PIC16C715 microcontroller incorporates a multi-<br>
channel A/D converter. In addition, a more feature rich microcontroller of this type will<br>
allow for the addition of a display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) or LED display.<br>
The microcontroller could generate information on a periodic basis to be displayed to the<br>
user, such as gas temperature and relative humidity. In addition, the microcontroller may<br>
directly drive an audible alert device, rather than indirectly driving it through a transistor as<br>
shown in Figure 14. These are examples of the types of modifications or variations that are<br>
possible depending on the type of microcontroller that is selected for use in the control<br>
module 140.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the setup and operation of the apparatus 100 will<br>
be described. The AC/DC converter 180 is plugged into a 110V AC power source, such as<br>
a wall outlet or a power strip. The control module 140 is connected to the AC/DC<br>
converter 180. Alternatively, the apparatus 100 may be powered by a battery or<br>
photovoltaic source. The tubing set is then installed by attaching one end of the tube<br>
segment 160 to the outlet of the gas regulator 10 by the Luer lock 166. The tube segments<br>
160, 162 and 164 may be pre-attached to the filter 110 and the gas treater 120 for<br>
commercial distribution of the apparatus 100. The cable 170 is installed into the electrical<br>
housing 210 of control module 140 by the connector 172.<br>
The gas treater 120 is charged with a supply of liquid agent and/or humidifying<br>
solution by the syringe 200. The syringe 200 is then inserted into the charging port 190 so<br>
that a needle or cannula of the syringe 200 penetrates the resealable member 194 (Figure 2)<br>
and the liquid agent and/or humidifying solution is injected into the gas treater 120 to be<br>
absorbed by the absorbent layers. The syringe 200 is then removed from the charging port<br>
190, and the charging port 190 seals itself. The free end of the tube segment 164 is<br>
attached to a gas delivery device by the Luer lock 168 or other appropriate connector.<br>
Alternatively, the gas treater 120 may be pre-charged with the liquid agent and/or<br>
humidifying solution, thus not requiring a charge prior to operation.<br>
If the embodiment of Figures 5 or 6 is employed, then the bags 220 and 230 are<br>
charged (unless they are pre-charged) with a quantity of one or more agents. Likewise, if<br>
the embodiment of Figures 7 or 8 is employed, the tube member 300 or tube member 400<br>
is charged (unless it is pre-charged) with a quantity of one or more agents. If the<br>
embodiment of Figure 9 is employed, the reservoir(s) of the inkjet prinmead cartridge 500<br>
is charged (unless it is pre-charged) with a quantity of one or more agents. The nozzles<br>
522 of the printhead 520 are positioned in alignment with an opening to the housing 122.<br>
Finally, if the embodiment of Figures 12 or 13 is employed, the container 700 is prepared<br>
for use as described above in conjunction with Figures 12 and 13.<br>
Once the gas regulator 10 is activated, it receives gas from a gas supply cylinder<br>
and regulates the pressure and flow rate of the gas, both of which can be adjusted by the<br>
operator. The pressure and volumetric flow rate are controlled by adjusting controls (not<br>
shown) on the gas regulator 10. Gas then flows through the tube segment 160 into the<br>
optional filter 110 where it is filtered, and then through tube segment 162 into the gas<br>
treater 120. In the gas treater 120, gas comes into contact with the optional electrical<br>
heating element 134 and the optional humidifying liquid-retaining layer(s) 130-132 which<br>
are positioned wiuiin die flow path of the gas, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Depending on which gas treater embodiment of Figures 2-9, 12 or 13 is employed,<br>
the gas stream is treated with a quantity of one or more agents so that the one or more<br>
agents is carried out of the gas treater 120 for delivery to an animal. For some applications<br>
and temperature range requirements, it may be desirable to position the gas treater 120<br>
immediately adjacent the location to which the treated gas is to be delivered.<br>
In the event that heating and humidification of the gas is also desired and the<br>
appropriate components are also deployed in the gas treater 120, then in chamber 128, the<br>
gas is also simultaneously heated and humidified to the proper physiological range by<br>
regulation of the heating element 134 and liquid content of the layers 130-132 such that the<br>
temperature of gas exiting chamber 128 is within a preselected physiological temperature<br>
range (preferably 35 c to 40°C, though any desired temperature range can be preselected),<br>
and within a preselected range of relative humidity (preferably above 40% relative<br>
humidity, such as in the range of 80-95% relative humidity). If the apparatus is operated<br>
with the gas treater 120 not charged with liquid agent and/or humidifying solution either<br>
because the user forgot to manually charge it before initiating operation, or the apparatus<br>
was sold without a pre-charge of liquid (i.e., in a dry state), the relative humidity of the gas<br>
in the chamber of the gas treater 120 will be detected to be below the predetermined<br>
threshold and the alarm will be activated, alerting the user that the gas treater 120 requires<br>
charging, if a wet type of treatment is desired. The apparatus will automatically issue an<br>
alarm to alert a user to the need for charging the gas treater 120 with liquid agent and/or<br>
humidifying solution, thereby avoiding further delivery of unhydrated gas into a animal.<br>
With further reference to Figure 5, the control module 140 monitors the relative<br>
humidity of the gas exiting the chamber and further regulates the temperature of the gas in<br>
the chamber 128. In particular, the microcontroller 142 generates a recharge signal when<br>
the relative humidity of the gas in the chamber drops below the predetermined relative<br>
humidity threshold, indicating that the liquid supply in the gas treater 120 requires<br>
replenishing. An audible alarm is issued by the buzzer 147 and/or a visual alarm is issued<br>
by LED 148A to warn the attendant or user that the gas treater 120 requires recharging.<br>
Preferably, the microcontroller 142 continues the alarm until the humidity in the chamber<br>
returns to a level above the predetermined relative humidity threshold, which will occur<br>
when the gas treater 120 is recharged with liquid. Moreover, the microcontroller 142 will<br>
issue a second alarm, such as by energizing LED 148B, when the relative humidity level of<br>
gas in the gas treater 120 drops below the critical relative humidity threshold, at which<br>
point electrical power to the heating element 134 is terminated. In addition, the<br>
microcontroller 142 controls the temperature of the gas by controlling electrical power<br>
supplied to the heating element 134.<br>
In some cases, the controlled humidity of the gas stream is more important than<br>
controlled heating. For those applications, the apparatus would include only those<br>
components necessary to treat the gas stream with one or more agents (according to the<br>
embodiments of Figures 7-13) and to humidify the gas stream. Furthermore, monitoring<br>
the humidity of the gas stream is also optional for certain applications. For example,<br>
treating the gas stream with a dry agent may not normally require heating or<br>
humidification.<br>
The method and apparatus of this invention can be utilized for any circumstances,<br>
including procedures requiring the treatment of gas with one or more agents, and the<br>
optional humidification and heating of the gas. The optional filtration may also be utilized<br>
according to the sterility of gas required for the procedure. Preferable gases for endoscopy<br>
are carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. A combination of the above gases can also be used,<br>
i.e., 100% of a single gas need not be used. The procedure is preferably endoscopy such as<br>
laparoscopy, colonoscopy, gastroscopy, bronchoscopy, and thoracoscopy. However, it<br>
may also be utilised for providing heated and humidified oxygen or any anesthetic gases or<br>
combination of gases for breathing, for example, or to administer anesthesia or breathing<br>
therapy. In particular, the compact size of the apparatus make the invention portable and<br>
thus suitable for uses requiring portability. The gas delivery device that provides the direct<br>
contact to the animal should be selected according to the procedure to be performed as<br>
known to those skilled in the art. The gas that is conditioned by the apparatus may be<br>
pressure controlled, volumetrically controlled or both.<br>
