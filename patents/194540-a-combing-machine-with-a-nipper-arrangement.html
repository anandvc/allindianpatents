				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention concerns a combing machine with a nipper arrangement, a circular comb, or half comb respectively, for combing the fibre fringes nipped by the nipper arrangement, a noils suction duct surrounding the circular comb, a back detaching roll against the circumferential surface of which a first longitudi¬nal edge of a back stripper bar fits, and a front detaching roll, against the circum¬ferential surface of which a first longitudinal edge of a front stripper bar fits.<br>
The general goal of the present invention is seen in that cleaning of elements of combing machines of this type is to be facilitated. In particular, the combing ma¬chine is to be designed in such a manner that waste fibres and foreign matter stripped off the circumferential surfaces of the detaching rolls, and fly waste in general, specifically are eliminated during operation, the combing machine thus being relatively easy to maintain.<br>
The inventive combing machine, using which the goal of the invention is achiev¬ed, is characterised in that adjacent to a second longitudinal edge which is locat¬ed opposite a first longitudinal edge of each stripper bar a space is left free which communicates with the inside room of the noils suction duct.<br>
A front wall of the noils suction duct can be provided with a rim extending adja¬cent to, and at a distance from, the second longitudinal edge of one of the strip¬per bars.<br>
Owing to the inventive design of the combing machine the strippers can be kept clean during operation by air streams which are sucked past the stripper bars and about their second longitudinal edges into the noils suction duct. Thus man¬ual cleaning of the stripper bars and of the walls of the noils suction duct is re¬quired but at longer intervals.<br>
In order to further facilitate maintenance of the stripper bars and of the walls of the noils suction duct, the stripper bars can be held at their end portions in hold-<br><br>
ing elements which are mounted on a wall portion of the noils suction duct, and the front wall, two side walls and a back wall of the noils suction duct can be interconnected to form a box which as one unit together with the holding elements can be detached from the combing machine.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a combing machine with a nipper arrangement, a circular comb for combing of fibre fringes nipped by the nipper arrangement, a noils suction duct, a back detaching roll against the circumferential surface of which a first longitudinal edge of a back stripper bar fits, and a front detaching roll against the circumferential surface of which a first longitudinal edge of a front stripper bar fits contactingly, characterised in that adjacent to a second longitudinal edge of each stripper bar located opposite the first longitudinal edge a free space provided communicating with the inside room of the noils suction duct.<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail in the following with reference to illustrated design examples. It is shown in:<br>
Fig. 1 a schematic vertical section of a part of a combing position of a combing<br>
machine. Fig. 2 an alternative embodiment in a similar view as in Fig. 1, and in<br>
Fig. 3 a detail from Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 shown on an enlarged scale.<br><br>
The Figures 1 and 2 show a nipper arrangement 1 with a lower nipper plate 2 and an upper nipper blade 3. The nipper arrangement 1 can be moved to and fro between its shown front end position and a back end position (not shown). In its back end position the nipper arrangement 1 is closed and a forward end portion or a fibre fringe of a lap to be combed is nipped between the front edge of the lower nipper plate 2 and the lower edge of the upper nipper blade 3 and is combed by a continually rotating circular comb 4.<br>
The nipper arrangement 1 then is moved to its shown front end position and is opened. The combed fibre fringe is merged on a back detaching roll 5, which cooperates with an upper roll 6, with the combed web produced before. The fibre fringe is pulled through a fixed comb 7 as the detaching roll 5 moves forward and is detached from the lap remaining on the lower nipper plate 2.<br>
A front detaching roll 8, which synchronously with the back detaching roll 5 is rotated<br>
forward and backward (pilgrim motion) and with which an upper roll 9 cooperates<br>
supplies the combed fleece onto a web guide plate 10. The fleece moves toward a pair<br>
of take-off rolls 11, through a funnel 12 and is supplied to an	<br><br>
output table 13.<br>
The circular comb 4 is surrounded by a noils suction duct which comprises a front wall 14, two side walls 15 and a back wall 16. In Figure only one of the two side walls 15 is visible of course. The duct merges on its lower side into a com¬mon take off suction duct 17 co-ordinated to all the combing positions of the combing machine. Via the duct 14,15,16 and the common suction duct 17 the noils (short fibres) and impurities eliminated from the fibre fringes by the circular comb 4 and by the fixed comb 7 are carried off pneumatically. In the noils suction duct 14,15,16 also a rotating brush 18 is arranged acting onto the circular comb.<br>
A back stripper bar 19 with its upper longitudinal edge contacts the circumferen¬tial surface of the back detaching roll 5, and a front stripper bar 20 with its upper longitudinal edge contacts the circumferential surface of the front detaching roll 8. The stripper bars 19 and 20 serve to clear off fibres and other particles clinging to the circumferential surfaces of the detaching rolls 5 and 8. In the preferred em¬bodiments shown both end portions of the back stripper bar 19 are taken up each in a back groove each provided in a holding element 21 each. The end por¬tions of the front stripper bar 20 are taken up in a front groove each provided in the holding elements 21. Each of the two holding elements 21 is mounted on a portion of the corresponding side wall 15 of the noils suction duct 14,15,16.<br>
The holding element 21, indicated schematically only in the Figures 1 and 2, is shown on an enlarged scale in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 the back groove 22 in the holding element is shown, which takes up an end portion of the back stripper bar 19, as well as the front groove 23 which takes up an end portion of the front stripper bar 20. Preferentially in each groove 22 and 23 in each holding element 21 a pres¬sure spring 24, and 25 respectively, each is provided. The pressure springs 24 and 25 elastically press the stripper bars 19 and 20 upward relative to the hold¬ing elements and press them into contact with the circumferential surface of the corresponding detaching roll 5, or 8 respectively.<br>
In the preferred embodiments shown the front wall 14, both side walls 15 and the<br><br>
back wall 16 of the noils suction duct 14,15,16 are interconnected to form a unit which, together with the holding elements 21, can be detached from the combing machine. This unit is detachable mounted to the combing machine e.g. using two lower screws 26 and two upper screws 27. The shaft of the circular brush 18 in each side wall 15 extends through a recess 28 which is open up to the upper rim of the side wall; the unit formed by the front wall 14, both side walls 15 and the back wall 16 can be detached from, and re-mounted onto, the combing machine without dismantling the shaft of the circular brush 18.<br>
According to the invention a free space is provided adjacent to the lower edge of each stripper bars 19 and 20 located opposite the upper edge which contacts the detaching roll 5, or 8 respectively, said free space communicating with the inside room of the noils suction duct 14,15,16 in such a manner that the two stripper bars 19 and 20 are exposed to an air stream which is generated by the below atmospheric pressure prevailing in the noils suction duct and which keeps the stripper bars clean.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 1 the arrangement is laid out in such a man¬ner that an upper rim of the front wall 14 of the noils suction duct 14,15,16 ex¬tends adjacent and parallel to, and at a distance from, the lower edge of the front stripper bar 20. Thus between the lower longitudinal edge of the stripper bar 20 and the upper rim 29 of the wall 14 a gap 30 of a width of about 4 to 15 mm is formed via which air is sucked into the noils suction duct 14,15,16.<br>
In the alternative design example according to Fig. 2 an upper rim 31 of the front wall 14 of the noils suction duct 14,15,16 extends adjacent and parallel to, and at a distance from, the lower edge of the back striper bar 19. Between the lower longitudinal edge of the stripper bar 19 and the upper rim 31 of the wall 14 a gap 32 of a width of about 4 to 15 mm is formed via which air is sucked into the noils suction duct 14,15,16.<br>
With respect to the cleaning effect on the stripper bars 19 and 20 the arrange¬ment of the upper rim 31 of the wall 14 extending adjacent to the lower longitudi-<br><br>
nal edge of the stripper bar 19 is about equally effective compared to the ar¬rangement of the upper rim 29 of the wall 14 extending adjacent to the lower edge of the stripper bar 20. If the upper rim 31 is arranged adjacent to the lower edge of the stripper bar 19 elimination of fibre fly waste from the environment of the noils suction duct is rather improved. On the other hand, however, occasional disturbances in the web movement between the detaching rolls 5 and 8 are to be expected if during operation of the combing machine a cleaning roll 33 contact¬ing the top rolls 6 and 9 is temporarily removed. In order to avoid the occurrence of such disturbances in the embodiment according to Fig. 2 an additional screen¬ing wall 34 is arranged in front of the front stripper bar 20 which screening wall 34 together with the front wall 14 of the noils suction duct 14,15,16 forms an ad¬ditional air suction duct.<br>
The additional air duct communicates with the inside room of the noils suction duct 14,15,16. The screening wall 34 comprises an upper rim 37 which extends adjacent to, and preferably at a small distance from, the lower edge of the front stripper bar 20. The distance can be chosen e.g. from about 5 to 20 mm. Further¬more the screening wall 34 comprises, distant from the upper rim 37, a lower rim 38 around which the additional air duct via a gap 39 of a width of preferably 5 to 20 mm also communicates with the room in front of the screening wall 34 (below the web guide plate 10).<br>
The additional screening wall 34 not only reduces disturbances of the web movement between the two detaching rolls 5 and 8 if the cleaning roller 33 is re¬moved temporarily but also permits specific elimination of fibre fly waste from the zone between the detaching rolls 5 and 8 and from the zone in front of the de¬taching rolls below the web guide plate 10.<br><br><br>
