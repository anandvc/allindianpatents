A       TAMPER-PROOF       SEAL       FOR DISPOSABLE BOTTLES AND JARS;<br>
NARENDRA PRABHAKAR BONDE AN INDIAN NATIONAL OF A4-01, NEW PALM BEACH SOCIETY, SECTOR #4, NERUL, NAVI MUMBAI - 400 706, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA;<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
6-1-2004<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
TITLE:<br>
A TAMPER-PROOF SEAL FOR DISPOSABLE BOTTLES AND JARS.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles. Particularly, the present invention relates to an improved tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles and jars made of plastic, resin or polymer materials used for packaging consumer goods such as drinking water, soft drinks, liquor, edible oil etc.,<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Apparently, product tampering and adulteration have been common phenomena as long as there have been packaged consumer goods. Adulteration takes place in just about every sphere of consumer products, from petrol to water, pharmaceuticals to personal care products and edible oil to milk. Product tampering and adulteration are very high on the consumer"s emotional and psychological agenda and hence, today"s consumer craves for a sense of safety and assurance in making purchases.<br>
Disposable bottles and jars particularly made of made of plastic, resin or polymer materials find a wide application in almost all the thrust areas of fast moving consumer market especially for packaging goods such as drinking water, soft drinks, liquor, edible oil, etc.<br><br>
Such disposable bottles packaged with consumer goods are frequently prone to tampering and thereby adulteration of contents which markedly affect the safety and assurance of purchase from consumers" end.<br>
Currently available disposable bottles are fitted with tamper-evident caps which are commonly referred to as cap seal as illustrated in Fig1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. Referring to Fig1, the cap seal (1) has a seal portion (13) extending from the open end face of a cap (11) and separated from the cap (11) by a perforated line (12) which acts as a tearing path for the seal portion (13) to separate from the cap (11) at the time of unscrewing the cap (11) for opening the bottle. The functions of the cap (11) and the seal portion (13) are as follows :<br>
a)	The cap (11) acts as a closure system, which prevents spilling of the packaged material, prevents taste contamination and material degradation by preventing exposure of contents to the outer atmosphere.<br>
b)	The seal portion (13) acts as:<br>
(i)       a bonding medium between the cap and the bottle; and<br>
(ii)      acts as a tamper-evident feature by showing visual evidence of tampering by remaining on the neck of the bottle.<br>
The cap seal (1) is assembled with the bottle or jar by punching the cap seal (1) on the neck (2) of the bottle or jar. The cap seal (1) is secured onto the bottle in the following stages:.<br><br>
(i) The screw type threads of the cap (11) is secured within the groves of the bottleneck; and<br>
(ii) The seal portion (13) is locked onto the neck (2) of the bottle forming a lock mechanism (21, 22).<br>
Referring to Fig 2, when the cap (1) is opened, the seal portion (13) remains on the bottle and separates from the cap (11) along the perforated line (12). The remaining seal in the form of a ring on the bottle neck (2) serves as a visual "evidence" of tampering.<br>
However, the above cap seal has the following drawbacks as illustrated in Figs 3a, 3b, 3c :<br>
(i) If the cap seal is removed without breaking the seal and mounted back onto the bottle neck, or if the cap seal itself is replaced, the whole tamper-evident feature is hijacked. In this case, the seal may not show the tampered condition of the bottle at all, or the tampered condition of the bottle might not be evident upon replacing the cap seal. Hence, the tamper-evident feature provided by cap seal existing in the market is not sufficiently tamper-proof.<br>
1. The onus of providing the evidence of tampering is solely placed on the seal remaining on the bottleneck. The ring seal can be easily replaced, duplicated and manipulated to hide the evidence of tampering.<br><br>
2.	After the consumption of the product, the disposable bottle or jar is<br>
capable of being re-filled and sealed again to appear like a factory<br>
packed product.<br>
3.	There is a utility value in used empty bottles and jars which the<br>
consumers value and like to retain. There is no inbuilt mechanism in<br>
the packaging system to destroy re-marketability of these used empty<br>
disposable bottles and jars. The jars, such as the high density<br>
polyethylene (hdpe) jars used for packing of edible and lube oils are<br>
too tough to be destroyed by cutting or crushing.<br>
4.	Cap seal in all shapes, sizes and colors are freely available in the<br>
market. They are very cheap to manufacture and easy to duplicate.<br>
With the availability of used empty bottles, jars and cans in good<br>
condition at a fraction of the original manufacturing cost, a spurious<br>
manufacturer can easily reassemble the cap seal with the bottle at<br>
minimal cost, with minimum effort. These conditions provide the<br>
principal motive of tampering.<br>
Attempts have been made over the years to provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles. One such attempt is apparent from the Great Britain Patent document No 2068912 which discloses a bottle having a screw cap provided with a tamperproof seal which is destroyed when the bottle is first opened. The bottle has ratchet-like abutments which can be over-ridden by resilient tongues on the cap, when the cap is being screwed onto the bottle. When the cap is rotated refative to the bofffe for unscrewing the cap, the<br><br>
tongues engage with the abutments and cause a sealing ring, on which the tongues are provided, to break away from the cap.<br>
However the teachings of the Great Britain Patent document No 2068912 do not provide for a completely tamper-proof seal as the seal is vulnerable to be removed by cutting and separation from the bottle after first use thereby leading to chances of replacement of new cap and hence tampering.<br>
Therefore there exists a need in the art, to find a solution to the problems associated with the prior art and provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles the features of which incorporated therein would make the seal impossible to be restored to its originality to deceive the consumers and hence prevent tampering.<br>
Our inventor, by dint of determined research and intuitive knowledge, has proposed a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles which would overcome the deficiencies associated with the prior art and provide an improved tamper-proof seal which is impossible to be restored to its originality to deceive the consumers and hence remains safe and surprisingly tamper-proof.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The objects and advantages of the present invention which would set new safety standards in the field of packaging disposable bottles, cans and jars made of plastic, resin or polymer materials are set out herein below:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles wherein the seal is configured as a part of the bottle to<br><br>
render it impossible to be restored to its originality to deceive the consumers, after first use of the bottle.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles wherein the seal leaves multiple and prominent visible evidence of tampering at the very first attempt to open the cap, after manufacture thereby making the bottle unfit for further sealing and marketing.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles wherein the seal enables the consumers to recognize the product they favor and trust from spurious counterparts through the highest safety standards in the field of packaging disposable bottles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles wherein the seal helps manufacturers in protecting their product, brand equity, reputation and increase their profits through greater value addition and market realization from spurious manufacturers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a tamper-proof seal for disposable bottles wherein the seal enables the Government in collection of tax evaded by spurious manufacturers.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION :<br>
