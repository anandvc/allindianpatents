				<td>Field of the Invention :<br>
The present invention relates a syringe destroyer device for destroying and sterilizing the used syringe and needle. Particularly, it relates to a syringe destroyer device for simultaneously destroying and sterilizing the used syringe and needle, and to destroy the vaccine.<br>
Prior Art of the Invention :<br>
With the increase in number of infectious diseases and their spread among human beings due to reuse, particularly second use of syringes, when the same syringe has been used on the diseased patient, there is growing demand of the device to destruct syringe and needle and if possible to sterilize the destructed syringe and needle also so that the syringe and/or needle cannot be reused or subjected for second use.<br>
Such demand has further increased with AIDS emerging as a major disease of significant prevalence not only in India but also in other developing and developed countries. As a consequence of this doctors and paramedical staff are being exposed to the risk of AIDS virus infection in general and during participation in the children immunization programs in particular. It is therefore, necessary to destroy the syringe as well as needle and if possible to disinfect the syringe and needle, if not both at least the needle being used onto the patients of AIDS etc. in general and in children immunization programs in particular.<br>
Some of the known syringe and needle destroyer devices of the prior art have the major limitation that these do not sterilise the destructed needle and hence leaving chances of spreading of infection among the cleaning staff of the hospitals.<br>
Further, some of the known syringe and needle destroyer devices of the prior art have another limitation that these can only operate on power to generate required power for induction (resistance and spark) to convert hypodermic needles in to deformed structure. Still further, such known devices do not sterilise the deformed needles again leaving chances of spreading of infection among the cleaning staff of hospitals in addition to mandatory requirement of power supply.<br>
Yet another limitation of some of the known syringe and needle destroyer devices of the prior art is that these comprise of alloy electrodes to generate heat by resistance and spark to melt the needle while sterilizing the deformed needle and such requirement of alloy electrodes adds to the cost of the device, hence limiting the use of such known devices for mass application.<br>
This is another a limitation of some of the known syringe and needle destroyer devices of the prior art is that the said alloy electrodes require precise mounting techniques so that the needle is fully melted, hence making the manufacturing process of such known devices more complicated.<br>
Yet another limitation of some of the known syringe and needle destroyer devices of the prior art, as described herein above, is that these do not destroy the vaccine, generally left over amount in the syringe.<br>
In order to overcome the limitations of the power dependent and alloy electrode dependent devices, as described herein above, the manually operated devices have been made available in the prior art.<br>
The major limitation of such known manually operated syringe and needle destroyer devices is that these do not sterilize the needle and do not destroy the vaccine, generally left over amount in the syringe.<br>
The another limitation of such known manually operated syringe and needle destroyer devices is that these generally do not destroy the needle, which can be used for second and third and so on uses, hence leaving the chances of spread of infection.<br>
Need of the Invention :<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a device to destroy the syringe and needle so as to make them unfit for reuse or second use and at the same time to sterilise the destroyed syringe and needle or at least to sterilise the destroyed needle and to destroy the vaccine, generally left over amount in the syringe, which can overcome the disadvantages and limitations of the prior art, as stated above and leave no chance of spread of infection even to the cleaning staff of the hospitals.<br>
Objects of the Invention :<br>
This is the main object of the present invention to make a disclosure of a device to destroy the syringe and needle so as to make them unfit for reuse or second use and at the same time to sterilise the destroyed syringe and needle or at least to sterilise the destroyed needle and to destroy the vaccine, generally left over amount in the syringe, which can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art, as stated above.<br>
This is another object of the present invention to make a disclosure of a syringe and needle destroyer and sterilizer, as stated herein above, which can be easily manufactured and does not require power supply for its operation as mandatory requirement. However, the presently disclosed device can be operated on power with minor modifications, which does not limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
This is still another object of the present invention to make a disclosure of the said device, as stated herein above, which does not require alloy electrodes and hence reduces the cost of the said device and also simplifies the process for manufacturing the said device. Brief Description of the Invention :<br>
The present invention makes a disclosure of a device to simultaneously destroy and sterilize the syringe and needle so as to make them unfit for reuse or second use and at the same time to destroy the vaccine, generally left over in the syringe, and hence leaving no chance of spread of infection, wherein the said destroyer and sterilizer device comprises of a cutter, a grinding wheel, a means to hold the said cutter and said grinding wheel, herein after referred to as shaft, a means to rotate the said shaft provided with said cutter and said grinding wheel, a means to hold the used syringe along with its used needle, herein after referred to as syringe holder having one open end and another closed end closed with a push-pull shutter, which allows the destroyed and sterilized syringe and needle to get collected in the container provided for the said purpose.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a syringe destroyer device for destroying and sterilizing the used syringe and needle, and to destroy the vaccine characterized by a cutter and a grinding wheel for cutting and grinding, and simultaneously sterilizing while heating the used syringe and needle, and a shaft to hold said cutter and said grinding wheel, wherein said shaft is provided with a rotating means to rotate said shaft, and a syringe holder is provided to hold the used syringe along with its used needle. In accordance with this invention, said syringe holder is provided onto said cutter and/or said grinding wheel with the help of a support clamp.<br>
Further advantages and preferred embodiments of the presently disclosed destroyer and sterilizer device will be more apparent when the<br>
following description is read in conjunction with the accompanying figures, which are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention<br>
