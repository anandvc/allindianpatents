THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a method for wastewater treatment.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The process to treat effluent and to improve the effluent treatment process has been known to certain industries for many years. The wastewater or industrial effluent is the most complex, unusable output of almost all the industries. Wastewater treatment is the removal of impurities and total suspended solids as well as reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD).<br>
The waste water treatment has generally three important factors:<br>
a)	Pre-treatment<br>
b)	COD/BOD reduction.<br>
c)	Post treatment.<br>
However various effluent treatment processes involves number of stages. Some of the processes use biodegradation means while other intend towards the use of chemical or physical means to meet the stringent requirement of pollution control board. As wastewater is continuously generated from industries (effluents), nature (mudslides), human beings (domestic purpose) there is a need to treat this waste water.<br>
Typically aerobic bioreactor uses various suitable biological cultures along with necessary oxygen supply and food supply to bacterial population. It is also known that the reactors using suspended biomass as a workforce or attached growth of<br><br><br>
biomass on different substrates are fixed or fluidized. The bioreactor efficiency can be further improved by increasing the efficiency of oxygen transfer from air or gas using proper air or oxygen distributing grids. The organic loading of reactors is typically in the range of 2 to 12 kg/m3 per day. This has been achieved by different designs so far.<br>
Sometimes electrochemical process is proved to be beneficial to treat variety of industrial wastewater including paper mill waste, steel industries effluent, lead and mercury laden effluents, radioactive effluents, textile waste and the like. In view of all these improvements and proper design characteristics of the known art bio¬reactor, it has been possible to achieve the following result/advantages.<br>
(a)	lowest Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 4-5 hours<br>
(b)	90 percent of reduction in COD/BOD using various treatment system in case where BOD are lower than 2000 mg/liter and<br>
(c)	a COD/BOD ratio of 2.<br>
In spite of several advantages, the prior art process and the reactor suffers from several drawbacks as follows<br>
(a)	HRT increases with COD/BOD ratio increasing beyond 2.<br>
(b)	The oxygen demand with very advanced distribution grid is not much less, than 2 kg per 1 kg of BOD degraded in conventional bioreactor.<br>
(c)	The percentage carrier media with high surface area in the reactor vessel is not less than 50% wherever fluidized bed reactor is used.<br>
In the non-fluidized bed reactor device, there are frequent chances of bulking and floating of biomass with adverse operating conditions. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) is as high as 4-5 hours on minimum side and or as high as 20 to 30<br><br><br>
hours on maximum side depending upon the design and technology used i.e. suspended growth, fixed film growth or fluidized bed growth of biomass, fluidized bed reactor being the lowest. However, with such high HRT, the vessel sizes for large capacity plants are very big and the air distribution, liquid feeding and fluidization pose operational problems. The commissioning and stabilizing period is also higher.<br>

DETAIL DISCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A bioreactor chamber to treat wastewater having an electrode assembly installed inside is previously employed. Wastewater is treated inside the bioreactor only and treated water is taken out from an outlet. However, this system does not produce satisfactory result for wastewater containing tougher organic molecule and thereby reducing the COD level. In the present invention, an external electrode assembly is installed inside a flow channel between the feed inlet and the bioreactor chamber to pre-treat the wastewater and to achieve higher COD and BOD reduction.<br><br><br>
Referring to Figure 1 and Figure 3, of the accompanying drawings, an apparatus for treatment of wastewater by electro biodegradation is generally indicated by reference numeral (100).<br>
Figure 1: The figure shows an apparatus for treatment of wastewater by electro biodegradation comprising a bioreactor chamber (1). Wastewater is introduced inside the bioreactor chamber (1) through an inlet pipe (2) and an outlet pipe (3) is provided for transferring treated wastewater from the bioreactor chamber to a clarifier (4). A pump (9) is provided to pump the raw effluent inside the bioreactor chamber (1). Depending on the flow rate of the raw effluent the capacity of pump is decided. For aerobic system an air supply source (6) is installed, which provides air to the chamber (1). Inside the improved bioreactor, the aeration grid (5) is provided at the operative lower end of the bioreactor chamber (1) to supply air. The diameter of aeration grid (5) varies and is based on the hydraulic loads of the reactor. The number of holes in the aeration grid is calculated based on rate of airflow and the air velocity. The diameter of aeration grid (5) depends on the cross-sectional area of the bioreactor (1).<br>
Microbes are introduced inside the bioreactor chamber (1) for carrying out biodegradation. For sewage treatment, no initial inoculations are required as the sewage itself contains numerous microbes and the system is self-sustaining. For treatment of any other waste, the initial microbial inoculation is done using suspended biomass, which later forms attached growth system if a fluidized bed bioreactor with anchoring media is used. The inoculation is normally done at ambient temperature conditions. However, a range between 20-35°C is accepted as favorable condition for inoculation.<br>
11<br><br>
A flow channel (8) is provided between the inlet pipe (2) and the bioreactor chamber (1). This flow channel (8) is provided with electrode assembly for supplying electrical charge to the raw feed wastewater inside the flow channel (8). The electrode assembly is provided inside the flow channel in such a way that it prevents the obstruction in the flow of wastewater through the flow channel. An electrical power source device is provided to supply electrical current to the electrode assembly.<br>
The electrode assembly consists of an anode, a cathode, fitting means and means to supply electric current to electrodes. The electrodes in the electrode assembly are coated electrode of predetermined shape and size. An anode is fitted in the electrode assembly with the help of fitting means. The said fitting means have an outer member (10) (refer figure 2) and an inner member (12) (refer figure 2). The outer member (10) cooperates with the wall of flow channel (11) and inner member is provided for securing an anode. The inner member is secured to outer member by insulated spokes. Anode is placed inside the inner member securely. Anodes used can be expanded metal type titanium electrodes coated with mixed oxides of precious metals. The wall of the flow channel (11) acts as cathode and anode is spaced apart from the wall of the flow channel. Cathodes are made of stainless steel. For holding of electrode assembly in place in the flow channel, number of engineering alternatives can be used such as electrodes supported on some means from near the bottom, held in position by fixing from top of the flow channel and supported on a flow channel. The cage type of configuration can also be used in the bioreactor for ease of maintenance.<br>
The electrode assembly provided in the flow channel is adapted to treat the wastewater before the  wastewater is introduced  in the  bioreactor.     In this<br>
12<br><br>
configuration, the wastewater is pretreated by increasing the oxygen levels. This pretreatment breaks tougher organic molecules to simpler compounds there by increasing the rate of degradation in the subsequent bioreactor system.<br>
Different current densities (in order of 1 - 1000 Amperage) can be applied to the electrodes arranged in either parallel or series by adjusting the amperage of the power source, thus bringing flexibility in operating conditions. For wastewater with flow rate of 1000 liter per hour, an electrical current in the range of 1 ampere to 30 ampere is provided for retention time of 4 hours. Typically, the range between 9 ampere to 21 ampere is accepted as favorable condition.<br>
The treated water is then allowed to pass through on outlet (3) and is collected in a clarifier (4). The treated water so obtained also contains dead microbes, which settle down in the clarifier because of density difference. The sludge is removed from the bottom of the clarifier and treated water is taken from the top of the clarifier by a float mechanism.<br>
Figure 2A: The figure shows a top view of the electrode assembly placed inside the flow channel. The electrode assembly consists of anode (14), cathode (15), inner member (12), fitting means (16) and insulated spokes (13). The outer member cooperates with the wall of flow channel and inner member is provided for securing the anode (14). The outer member is fitted with the help of complementary fitting means (16) with the wall of the flow channel (11). The anode is secured to the inner member by insulated spokes (13). The inner member is secured to the outer member by insulated spokes (13). These spokes are prepared from any insulating material. The Inner member is adapted to locate and fit an anode securely. An anode (14) is placed spaced apart from cathode (15).<br>
13<br><br>
Figure 2B: The figure shows top view for another embodiment of the electrode assembly placed inside the flow channel wherein the wall of flow channel itself acts as cathode (15). The electrode assembly consists of anode (14), wall of the flow channel (11) acting as a cathode, outer member (10), inner member (12), fitting means (16) and insulated spokes (13). An anode (14) is spaced apart from cathode (15) with the help of insulated spokes (13).<br>
Figure 3: The figure shows another embodiment of the invention wherein an additional internal electrode assembly (7) is introduced to the system of figure 1 to transfer electrical charge to the microbes present inside the bioreactor chamber. According to this arrangement, feed water is treated twice. The wastewater is treated first inside the flow channel (8) wherein first electrode assembly is placed. The partially treated water is then allowed to pass through second electrode assembly (7) placed inside the bioreactor chamber (1) for optimum result. This arrangement helps to break tougher organic molecules to simpler compound there by increase the rate of degradation in the subsequent bioreactor system.<br>
Thus by applying electrical current to the electrode assembly present inside the flow channel biodegradation is improved having positive impact on COD/BOD reduction, organic loading, HRT. By passing electrical current to both the electrode assemblies, the microbial activity is enhanced by change in the metabolic activity of the microbes. This change in metabolic activity reduces the rate of multiplication of bacterial cell to half of the normal generation time. The growth rate of microbes is calculated by increase in the turbidity with time with and without electrical charged effluent.  The experimental results indicate that the rate<br>
14<br><br>
of metabolic activity of bacterial cell has increased due to applied electrical current.<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the following examples, which do not limit the invention in any way and only exemplify the invention.<br>

Figure 4:  Figure 4 illustrates the graphical relationship between electrical current<br>
in amperage and COD (chemical oxygen demand) level.   X-axis indicates the<br>
optimization of current (amperage) at 1000 liter per hour of sewage flow rate and<br>
Y- axis indicates COD at the outlet for an inlet COD load of 644 mg/1. The graph<br>
illustrates reduction in COD level for electrode configuration of system at various<br>
conditions.<br>
When the system in accordance with the invention was tested without supplying<br>
electrical current to an electrode assembly the reduction in COD was negligible.<br>
When the system was tested by supplying electric current only to the electrode<br>
assembly present inside a flow channel, reduction in COD was more than that<br>
achieved for the configuration of system without electric current.<br>
When the system was tested by supplying electric current only to the electrode<br>
assembly   present   inside   a   bioreactor   chamber,   reduction   in   COD   was<br>
comparatively to above said conditions.<br>
When the system was tested by supplying electric current to both the electrode<br>
assembly present inside a flow channel and inside the bioreactor, reduction in COD<br>
was higher than any configuration tested.<br>
This shows that the reduction in COD level is highest when electric current is<br>
supplied to both the electrode assembly present inside the flow channel and inside<br>
the bioreactor.<br>
It also shows that the system produces an optimum result when the applied current<br>
is between 15 ampere to 20 ampere.<br>
21<br><br>
Conclusion<br>
From the experimental results, it was found that the system works most efficiently at 17 ampere to 18 ampere for this particular efficiency. Above 20 ampere, it was found the microbes were extra charged / died and their efficiency tends to fall.<br>
For aerobic and anaerobic system;<br>
It was found that the reduction in COD was more when the system was tested by supplying electrical current to both the electrode assemblies placed inside the flow channel and inside the bioreactor chamber.<br>
When the system was tested by supplying electrical current only to the electrode    , assembly placed inside the bioreactor chamber and not to the electrode assembly placed in the flow channel the reduction in COD was comparatively less than that achieved by supplying electrical current to both the electrode assemblies.<br>
When the system was tested by supplying electrical current only to the electrode assembly placed inside the flow channel and not to the electrode assembly placed inside the bioreactor chamber the reduction in COD was comparatively less than that achieved by supplying electrical current only to the electrode assembly placed inside the bioreactor chamber and not to the electrode assembly placed in the flow channel.<br>
When the system was tested without supplying electrical current to either of the electrode assemblies the reduction in COD level was not at all significant and was comparatively less than that achieved by any of the arrangement.<br>
22<br><br>
Thus by using electrical energy in the invented improved bioreactor, biodegradation is improved having positive impact on COD/BOD reduction, organic loading, HRT, volume of carrier media if a fluidized bed bioreactor is used. Due to passage of electrical current, the microbial activity is enhanced by change in the metabolic activity of the microbes. Due to change in the metabolic activity, the rate of multiplication of a bacterial cell reduces to half of the normal generation time. The growth rate of microbes is calculated by increase in the turbidity with time with and without electrical charged effluent. The experiments also indicate presence of different microbial consortia. The reactor shows the presence of bacterial population and elimination of protozoan and other ciliates. This helps in increase the rate of biodegradation in presence of bacterial population rather than higher organisms. The experimental results indicate that the rate of metabolic activity of bacterial cell has increased due to applied electrical current. This is evident from the rate of bio-degradation and growth rate.<br>
