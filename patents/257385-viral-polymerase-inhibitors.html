				<td>VIRAL POLYMERASE INHIBITORS<br>
technical field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to inhibitors of RNA dependent RNA polymerases, particularly those viral polymerases within the Flaviviridae family, more particularly to HCV polymerase.<br>
background of the invention<br>
About 30,000 new cases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are estimated to occur in the United States each year (Kolykhalov, A.A.; Mihalik, K.; Feinstone, S.M.; Rice, C.M.; 2000; J. Virol. 74: 2046-2051). HCV is not easily cleared by the hosts' immunological defences; as many as 85% of the people infected with HCV become chronically infected. Many of these persistent infections result in chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hoofnagle, J.H.; 1997; Hepatology 26: 15S-20S). There are an estimated 170 million HCV carriers world­wide, and HCV-associated end-stage liver disease is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. In the United States alone, hepatitis C is responsible for 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually. Without effective intervention, the number is expected to triple in the next 10 to 20 years. There is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection.<br>
Currently, the only approved therapy for patients chronically infected with HCV is treatment with interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin. Recently, pegylated versions of interferon (peginterferon alpha-2a (Pegasys™, Roche) and peginterferon alpha-2b (PEG-lntron™, Schering)) have been approved for marketing in some countries for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection, both alone and in combination with ribavirin. However, it has been reported that these therapies achieve a sustained response in fewer than 60% of cases.<br>
HCV belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus hepacivirus, which comprises three genera of small enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses (Rice, C.M.; 1996; "Flaviviridae: the viruses and their replication"; pp. 931-960 in Fields Virology, Fields, B.N.; Knipe, D.M.; Howley, P.M. (eds.); Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia Pa.). The 9.6 kb genome of HCV consists of a long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5' and 3' non-translated regions (NTR's). The HCV 5' NTR is 341 nucleotides in length and functions as an internal ribosome entry site for cap-<br>
independent translation initiation (Lemon, S.H.; Honda, M.; 1997; Semin. Virol. 8: 274-288). The HCV polyprotein is cleaved co- and post-translationally into at least 10 individual polypeptides (Reed, K.E.; Rice, C.M.; 1999; Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 242: 55-84). The structural proteins result from signal peptidases in the N-terminal portion of the polyprotein. Two viral proteases mediate downstream cleavages to produce non-structural (NS) proteins that function as components of the HCV RNA replicase. The NS2-3 protease spans the C-terminal half of the NS2 and the N-terminal one-third of NS3 and catalyses cis cleavage of the NS2/3 site. The same portion of NS3 also encodes the catalytic domain of the NS3-4A serine protease that cleaves at four downstream sites. The C-terminal two-thirds of NS3 is highly conserved amongst HCV isolates, with RNA-binding, RNA-stimulated NTPase, and RNA unwinding activities. Although NS4B and the NS5A phosphoprotein are also likely components of the replicase, their specific roles are unknown. The C-terminal polyprotein cleavage product, NS5B, is the elongation subunit of the HCV replicase possessing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (Behrens, S.E.; Tomei, L.; DeFrancesco, R.; 1996; EMBOJ. 15:12-22; and Lohmann, V.; Korner, F.; Herian, U.; Bartenschlager, R.; 1997; J. Virol. 71: 8416-8428). It has been recently demonstrated that mutations destroying NS5B activity abolish infectivity of RNA in a chimp model (Kolykhalov, A.A.; Mihalik, K.; Feinstone, S.M.; Rice, C.M.; 2000; J. Virol. 74: 2046-2051).<br>
The development of new and specific anti-HCV treatments is a high priority, and virus-specific functions essential for replication are the most attractive targets for drug development. The absence of RNA dependent RNA polymerases in mammals, and the fact that this enzyme appears to be essential to viral replication, would suggest that the NS5B polymerase is an ideal target for anti-HCV therapeutics. WO 01/47883, WO 02/04425, WO 03/000254, WO 03/007945, WO 03/010140, WO 03/026587, WO 03/101993, WO 04/005286, WO 2004/064925, WO 2004/065367 and WO 2004/087714 report inhibitors of NS5B proposed for treatment of HCV.<br>
Indole inhibitors of the NS5B polymerase of HCV are disclosed in WO 03/010141. However, the inhibitors of the invention differ from those disclosed in WO 03/010141 in that they exhibit unexpectedly good activity in a cell-based HCV RNA replication assay.<br>

The reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove the MeOH, diluted with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (-50 ml_) and extracted with EtOAc (-200 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography, using 30% EtOAc in hexane as the eluent, to obtain the pure methyl ester 1-2 (4.78 g, 88% yield). Step 2:<br>
The methyl ester 1-2 from step 1 (3.31 g, 18.9 mmol) was dissolved in MeCN (50 mL) and a catalytic amount of Yb(OTf)3 (586 mg, 0.95 mmol) was added. 2-Cyclopenten-1-one (7.76 mL, 94.5 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 16 h. The MeCN solvent was removed under vacuum, the residue was re-dissolved in EtOAc (-200 mL) and extracted with aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (-100 mL), H2O (50 mL) and brine (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness under vacuum. After<br>
purification of the residue by flash column chromatography, using 40% EtOAc in hexane as the solvent gradient, the desired cyclopentanone adduct 1-3 was isolated as isolated as a beige-colored powder (3.4 g, 70% yield). Step 3:<br>
To a solution of the cyclopentanone adduct intermediate 1-3 from step 2 (3.81 g, 14.8 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (150 ml) at 0°C, NaH (60% dispersion in oil, 770 mg, 19.2 mmol) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 5 min, then Mel (1.2 ml_, 19.2 mmol) was added drop-wise and stirring was continued at 0°C for 3 h. The mixture was allowed to warm-up to RT and was quenched by the addition of aqueous saturated NH4CI (200 ml_). The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2x 500 ml) and the organic layer was washed with aqueous saturated NhUCI (2x 200 ml) H2O (200 ml) and brine (200 ml). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO4, evaporated to dryness and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography (using 30% EtOAc in hexane as the eluent) to isolate the /V-methylindole intermediate 1-4 as a beige solid (3.1 g, 77% yield). Step 4:<br>
In a sealed tube, the N-methylindole internediate 1-4 from step 3 (1.4 g, 5.16 mmol) and DAST (2.7 ml_, 20.6 mmol) were dissolved in CH2CI2 (50 ml_) and stirred at reflux for 3 days. The mixture was poured slowly into aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (-50 ml) and once the evolution of CO2 had stopped, the mixture was extracted with CH2CI2 (2x 100 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (50 ml), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (using a solvent gradient from 10% to 20% EtOAc in hexane) to isolate 3-(3,3-difluorocyclopentyl)-1-methyl-1/-/-indole-6-carboxylic acid methyl ester 1-5 (750 mg, 50% yield).<br>

Step 1:<br>
(Figure Removed)A solution of 2-methyl-5-nitrobenzoic acid 6-1 (10.0 g, 55.2 mmol) in MeOH (200 mL) and H2SO4 (1.0 ml) was heated to reflux while stirring for ~3 days. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was re-dissolved in EtOAc (-200 ml), washed with cold H2O (-50 ml), cold saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (-50 mL) and cold brine (-50 mL). The organic layer was then dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness to give the methyl ester 6-2 as a white solid, which was used without purification in step 2. Step 2: To a solution of the crude methyl ester 6-2 from step 1 (-55.2 mmol) in MeOH (200<br>
ml), Pearlman's catalyst (20% palladium hydroxide on carbon, 1.0 g) was added and the mixture was stirred under an atmosphere of H2 for 20 h at RT. The mixture was filtered through Celite and concentrated to dryness. The residue was re-dissolved in THF (200 ml), Ac2O (6.2 mL, 66 mmol) was added and the solution was stirred at RT for 3 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness under vacuum and the residue was re-dissolved in minimum volume of t-Bu methyl ether (-150 mL). The ether suspension was stirred at RT for 1 h before hexane (-100 mL) was added to precipitate the desired acetylated intermediate as a white solid. The solid was washed with hexane and dried to give the acetylated compound 6-3 in high purity (10.1 g, 88% yield). Step 3:<br>
A solution of the acetylated ester 6-3 from step 2 (8.42 g, 40.6 mmol) and potassium nitrate (5.0 g, 50 mmol) in AcOH:H2SO4 (1:1 ratio, 200 mL) was stirred at RT for 2 h and at 40°C for a further two hours. The crude reaction mixture was then poured slowly on ice (-1 L) and mixed for 20 min. The precipitate formed was filtered and washed several times with H2O to give a mixture of mainly two products, the desired 4-nitro isomer 6-4 and the undesired 6-nitro isomer 6-5 (1:2 ratio) which were separated after flash column chromatography using 30% EtOAc in hexane as the eluent. The pure 4-nitro isomer 6-4 was isolated as a yellow solid (2.05 g, 20% yield). Step 4:<br>
The 4-nitro Intermediate 6-4 from step 3 (2.05 g, 8.13 mmol) was dissolved in THF (50 mL) and the solution was cooled to 0°C before Mel (2.51 mL, 40.6 mmol) and t-BuONa (4.46 g, 46.4 mmol) were added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 15 h, H2O (-50 mL) was added and the aqueous mixture was washed with t-butyl methyl ether (-20 mL). The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 3 with 1N HCI and then extracted with EtOAc (-100 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine (-50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness to give the N-methylated compound 6-6 as a gummy foam which was used directly in step 5 without purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, wherein R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methyl iodide (CH3I) in step 4 above with the appropriate R8-X, wherein X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, methanesulfonate (mesylate), p-<br>
toluenesulfonate (tosylate), trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate), and the like.<br>
Step 5:<br>
A solution of the methylated derivative 6-6 from step 4 (~8 mmol) in MeOH (10 ml) and HCI (8N, 15 mL) was stirred at 70°C for 20 h. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was partitioned between saturated aqueous NaHCOs (20 ml) and EtOAc (50 ml). The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to give the methyl ester 6-7 as an orange solid (1.54 g), which was used in step 6 without purification. Step 6:<br>
A solution of the crude methyl ester 6-7 from step 5 (1.54 g, 6.7 mmol) in MeOH (30 ml) was treated under catalytic hydrogenation conditions using Pd/C (10%, 150 mg) under an atmosphere of H2 at RT for 2 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and concentrated to give 4-amino-2-methyl-5-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester 6-8 as a purple solid (1.33 g) which was sufficiently pure (confirmed by NMR) to be used without further purification.<br>

A solution of 4-amino-2-methyl-5-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester 6-8 from Example 6 (1.33 g, 6.85 mmol) in CH2CI2 (10 mL) was added slowly over a period of 30 min and stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 20 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness, and the residue was re-dissolved in AcOH (10.0 mL) and stirred at 70°C for 2 h to achieve cyclization of the benzimidazole ring. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (-250 mL), extracted with aqueous saturated NaHCO3 (2x 100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The<br>
organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (using a solvent gradient from 40% to 50% EtOAc in hexane) to obtain the pure 2-(1-fert-butoxycarbonylaminocyclobutyl)-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylicacid methyl ester 7-1 as a beige solid (1.41 g, 55% yield) and recover some of the unreacted diamino starting material.<br>

THF (40 ml_) and the solution was cooled to 0°C. A solution of DIBAL-H (18 ml, 1M<br>
in THF, 18 mmol) was added slowly and the reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h and then at 50°C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, a solution of potassium sodium tartrate (1M, 50 ml_) was added very slowly and stirring was continued for 1 h at RT. The solution was concentrated under vacuum in order to remove most of the THF and the extracted with EtOAc (-200 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography, using a solvent gradient from 50% EtOAc in hexane to pure EtOAc and then to 3% MeOH in EtOAc, to obtain the pure alcohol 8-1 as a yellow solid (1.09 g, 84% yield). Step 2:<br>
A solution of the alcohol 8-1 from step 1 (1.09 g, 3.16 mmol) and Dess-Martin periodinane (1.70 g, 4.0 mmol) in CH2CI2 (40 ml) was stirred at RT for 2 h. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography, using EtOAc: hexane (1:1 ratio), to obtain the pure aldehyde 8-2 (605 mg, 56% yield). Step 3:<br>
A solution of triethyl-2-phosphonopropionate (0.228 mL, 1.06 mmol) in THF (5.4 mL) was cooled to 0°C and NaH (42.5 mg, 60% in oil, 1.06 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 30 min before a solution of the aldehyde 8-2 from step 2 (300 mg in 3 mL of THF, 0.874 mmol) was slowly added and stirring was continued at RT for 20 h. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc (-100 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2x 30 mL) and brine (30 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated to a brown residue which was subsequently purified by flash column chromatography, using a solvent gradient from 40% to 60% EtOAc in hexane, to give the A/-Boc-protected ester 8-3 as a yellow foam (85 mg, 23% yield). Step 4:<br>
Hydrolysis of the Boc protecting group was achieved quantitatively by adding 4N HCI in dioxane (2 mL) and stirring the solution at RT for 1 h. After evaporation of the solvent under vacuum, (E)-3-[2-(1 -aminocyclobutyl)-3,6-dimethyl-3H-benzoimidazol-5-yl]-2-methylacrylic acid ethyl ester 8-4 was isolated pure as a yellow solid (79 mg).<br>

appropriately substituted derivatives to prepare analogues of the general formula Ille in the scheme above, wherein R50 is defined as hereinbefore. In addition, methyl esters can also be prepared in an analogous fashion using the appropriate reagent.

	Step 1:<br>
(Figure Removed)A two-necked flask (equipped with an internal thermometer) was charged with glacial AcOH (252 rnL), acetic anhydride (252.0 ml) and 2-fluoro-4-methyl-1-nitrobenzene 9-1 (25.0 g, 161 mmol) at -10°C. To the cooled solution, concentrated sulfuric acid (40 mL) was added drop-wise over a period of 5 min, followed by the very slow addition of chromium (VI) oxide (45 g, 450 mmol); the rate of addition must be very slow (~1.5 h) in order to maintain the temperature below 10 °C. Upon addition of the CrOa, the clear colorless solution becomes amber and finally dark brown at the end of the addition. After completion of the addition, the reaction was stirred for an additional 45 min (HPLC analysis indicated -70% completion of the reaction). The tar-like partial suspension was poured on ice (1.6 L), and the resulting slush was diluted with H2O up to a total of 3 L, at which point the product began to precipitate. After filtration, the beige solid was washed with cold H20 to obtain a white solid. The solid was then suspended in cold 2% NaHCO3 (250 ml), filtered and washed again with cold H2O to give the diacetate 9-2 (22 g, containing some of the unreacted starting material) as a white solid which was used as such in step 2. Step 2:<br>
In a screw-cap vial, the diacetate 9-2 from step 1 (1.0 g, 3.7 mmol) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (10.0 mL), followed by addition of H2O (1.0 mL) and concentrated<br>
HCI (1.0 ml_). The resulting partially soluble mixture was heated at 115°C for 45 min. Most of the solvents were removed under vacuum to give a gummy residue, the remaining acid and H2O was azeotroped twice with CH2CI2-hexane to give the desired semi-pure 3-fluoro-4-nitrobenzaldehyde 9-3 as a yellow solid (600 mg). This compound was further purified by flash column chromatography (using 20% EtOAc in hexanes as the eluent) to remove small amounts of unreacted 2-fluoro-4-methyl-1 -nitrobenzene 9-1 (-35% overall yield).<br>

After that period, 3-fluoro-4-nitrobenzaldehyde 9-3 from Example 9 (1.06 g, 6.27 mmol) was added and stirring was continued at RT for 16 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of H20 (20 ml_) and the product was extracted into EtOAc (2x 100 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to give the cinnamate ester 10-1 as a light orange solid which was used in step 2 without purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that analogues bearing various substituents on the cinnamate double bond may be prepared by replacing the triethyl phosphonoacetate used in this procedure with appropriately substituted derivatives or by replacing the aldehyde 9-3 with an appropriate ketone. In addition, cinnamate methyl esters can also be prepared in an analogous fashion using the appropriate reagent.<br>
Step 2:<br>
The cinnamate ester 10-1 from step 1 (-6.27 mmol) and methylamine (2M in THF, 6.3 ml, 12.5 mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (6 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. After that period, the mixture was diluted with EtOAc (100 ml) and the organic layer was washed with H20 (3x 30 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to give the crude methylamino intermediate 10-2 as an orange solid. This product was used in step 3 without purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, where R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methylamine (CH3NH2) in step 2 above with the appropriate R8-NH2.<br>
Step 3:<br>
The 3-methylamino-4-nitrocinnamate ester 10-2 from step 2 (2-2, -150 mg) and SnCI2 dihydrate (950 mg, 4.2 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) and the mixture was stirred at 80° C for 20 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL) and was slowly added to an aqueous solution of saturated NaHCO3 and stirred for 30 min. The organic layer was then extracted with ice cold brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (using a gradient from 70 % to 60 % of hexane in ethyl acetate) to give (E)-3-(4-amino-3-(methylamino)phenyl)acrylic acid ethyl ester 10-3 as a yellow solid (100 mg).<br>

(Figure Removed)A solution of 2-methyl-4-nitrobenzonitrile 11-1 (2.53 g, 15.6 mmol) in aqueous NaOH (10%, 31.0 ml) and aqueous H2O2 (10%, 16 ml) was stirred at reflux for 2.5 h. The water circulation in the cooling condenser was halted for 5-10 min (to allow removal of the dissolved ammonia), and then the water flow was restored and reflux continued for an additional 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, HCI (concentrated) was added drop-by-drop until the pH was ~3, at which point the carboxylic acid 11-2 precipitated as an orange-color solid (3.60 g). The carboxylic acid was used in step 2 without purification. Step 2:<br>
A solution of the acid 11-2 from step 1 (3.60 g, 15.6 mmol) in MeOH (30 ml) and HCI (4N HCI in dioxane, 2.0 mL) was heated to reflux for 48 h. The solvent was evaporated to dryness under vacuum and the residue obtained was re-dissolved in EtOAc (200 mL). The solution was washed with aqueous saturated NaHC03 (100 ml) and brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness to give the ester intermediate 11-3 as a yellow-colored solid (2.38 g). This material was used in step 3 without purification. Step 3:<br>

After a few min of stirring, the ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 20 h. The reaction mixture was then poured slowly on ice (-50 mL) and stirred until the ice had melted, and the desired dinitro product 11-4 was precipitated<br>
and filtered (~1.55 g of light yellow and slightly wet solid). The compound was used as such in step 4. Step 4:<br>
To a solution of the dinitro intermediate 11-4 from step 3 (1.55 g, 6.45 mmol) in THF (15.0 ml) at 0°C, a solution of methylamine (2M in THF, 15.2 ml, 32.3 mmol) was added, the ice-bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 1.5 h. The solution was concentrated to remove some of the THF and then diluted with EtOAc (-100 ml_). The organic layer was washed with H2O (-50 ml) and brine (~50 ml), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated to give the methylamino intermediate 11-5 as an orange solid (1.26 g). The compound was used in step 5 without further purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, where R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methylamine (CH3NH2) in step 4 above with the appropriate R8-NH2. Step 5:<br>
To a solution of the methylamino derivative 11-5 from step 4 (1.25 g, 5.58 mmol) in EtOH-H2O (110 ml, 1:1 ratio), K2CO3 (4.62 g, 33.5 mmol) and Na2S2O4 were added and the mixture was stirred at RT for 3 h. More H2O (-30 ml) was added and the mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove most of the EtOH. The reaction mixture was then diluted with EtOAc (-200 ml) and the organic layer was separated and extracted with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum to give 5-amino-2-methyl-4-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester 11-6 (927 mg, 86% yield) as a brown-colored solid.<br>

Step 1:<br>
(Figure Removed)2-Ethoxy-4-nitrobenzoic acid 12-1 (1.56 g; 7.38 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (15 ml) and the resulting solution stirred at 0°C. A solution of diazomethane in ethyl ether was slowly added until the yellow color persisted and was stirred for a further 20 min. The solvents were evaporated to afford the methyl ester 12-2 as a pale yellow solid (1.66 g, quant.) which was used in step 2 without further purification. Step 2:<br>
The ester 12-2 from step 1 (1.60 g; 7.10 mmol) was dissolved in dry toluene and the solution cooled to -78°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. A solution of diisobutylaluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran (1M; 8 ml_; 8 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture allowed to warm to ambient temperature. Two additional portions of DIBAL-H were added in this way (7 and 10 ml_) after 1 h and a further 1.5 h. 0.5 h after the last addition, the reaction was cooled to 0°C and 1N HCI (25 ml) was slowly added and the mixture stirred vigorously for 0.5 h. The organic solvents were then evaporated and the aqueous residue was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 ml) and washed with water (50 ml_) and brine (50 ml_). The combined extracts were then dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to afford the alcohol 12-3 as a pale yellow, fibrous solid (1.40 g; quant.) which was used as such in step 3. Step 3:<br>
A turbid solution of 1,1,1-tris(acetyloxy-1,1-dihydro-1,2-benziodoxol-3-(1 H)-one (Dess-Martin periodinane) (2.32 g; 5.47 mmol) in dichloromethane (40 ml_ + 5 ml rinse) was added to a stirred solution of the alcohol 12-3 from step 2 (0.98 g; 4.97<br>
mmol) in DCM (40 ml_) and the reaction stirred at ambient temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 4 h, saturated NaHC03 710% Na2S2O3 (1:1, 160 mL) was added and the mixture stirred vigorously until the phases were clear (ca. 0.5 h). The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (50 ml) and washed with saturated NaHCO3 (2 x 150 ml). The combined organic phases were then dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to yield the aldehyde 12-4 as a pale yellow solid (960 mg; 99 %) which was used as such in step 4.<br>
Step 4:<br>
Sodium hydride (95% dry powder; 158 mg; 6.25 mmol) was suspended in anhydrous THF (10 mL) and trimethyl phosphonoacetate (0.945 mL; 5.84 mmol) added dropwise at 0°C under a nitrogen atmosphere resulting in a solid white mass which could not be stirred. A solution of the aldehyde 12-4 from step 3 (950 mg; 4.87 mmol) in THF (7 mL + 3 mL rinse) was then added dropwise resulting in a yellow colour and slow dissolution of the white solid mass. After the addition, the reaction was allowed to warm to ambient temperature. After 15 h, the cloudy reaction mixture was evaporated to a pale yellow solid which was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL) and washed with saturated NaHCO3 (3 x 75 mL). The combined extracts were dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to afford the cinnamate ester 12-5 as pale yellow solid (1.212 g; 99 %) which was used in step 5 without further purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that the trimethyl phosphonoacetate used in this procedure can be replaced by appropriately substituted derivatives to prepare analogues bearing various substituents on the cinnamate double bond. Step 5:<br>
The 4-nitro-2-ethoxycinnamate 12-5 from step 4 (303 mg, 1.206 mmol), was dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid ( 3 mL) and the solution cooled to 0°C. Potassium nitrate (128 mg, 1.27 mmol) was added and the mixture stirred for 3.5 h at room temperature. After completion, the reaction mixture was poured over ice and the precipitated solid was collected by filtration. The crude product 12-6 was washed with water, dried under vacuum and used without purification in step 6 (390 mg). Step 6:<br>
The dinitro derivative 12-6 from step 5 (390 mg) was dissolved in THF (3 mL) and methylamine in THF (3.02 mL of a 2M solution in THF) was added. After stirring for<br>
30 min, volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the orange solid 12-7 used as such in step 7.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, where R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methylamine (CH3NH2) in step 6 above with the appropriate R8-NH2.<br>
Step 7:<br>
The nitro arene 12-7 from step 6 was suspended in a mixture of EtOH (12 ml) and water (12 ml) and K2CO3 (1.00 g, 6 equivalents ) was added followed by sodium hydrosulfite (1.26 g, 6 equivalents). The mixture was stirred for 4 h at room temperature and EtOH was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with EtOAc and the organic phase washed with brine and dried (MgSO4). Removal of the solvent and purification of the residue by flash chromatography (50 to 75% EtOAc in hexane) gave (E)-3-(5-amino-2-ethoxy-4-(methylamino)phenyl)acrylic acid methyl ester 12-8 (162 mg).<br>
(E)-3-(5-Amino-2-ethoxy-4-(methylamino)phenyl)acrylic acid methyl ester 12-8 may be converted to amine intermediates of general formula III in Example 1 using the procedures described in Examples 3 or 7 and further elaborated to inhibitors of general formula I in Scheme 1 using the procedure of Example 4.<br>
It will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that inhibitors of general formula I in Scheme I wherein R6 is -OCH3 and R5 is -CH=C(R50)-COOR may be prepared using the procedure of Example 12 but starting from a precursor identical to compound 12-1, except wherein the ethoxy group has been replaced with a methoxy group.<br>

4-Amino-2-methoxy-5-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester<br>
Step 1:<br>
(Figure Removed)Methyl 2-methoxy-5-nitrobenzoate 13-1 (6.21 g, 29.4 mmol) was suspended in MeOH (100 ml) and 20% Pd(OH)2/C (500 mg) was added. The mixture was stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere (1 atm) for 18 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure to give a residue of compound 13-2 (5.256 g), which was used as such in step 2. Step 2:<br>
The aniline 13-2 from step 1 (5.23 g) was dissolved in THF (50 ml_) and acetic anhydride (2.984 g) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The white suspension was concentrated under reduced pressure to a white paste, fert-butylmethyl ether (TBME, 20 ml) was added and while stirring, hexane (100 ml_) was added slowly. The suspension was then stirred for an additional 2h and the solid collected by filtration. The product 13-3 was washed with hexane and dried in air (6.372 g). Step 3:<br>
90% Nitric acid (9 ml) was diluted with water (9 ml) and cooled to 0°C. The anilide 13-3 from step 2 (5.905 g) was added in one portion and the mixture stirred for 30 min in the ice-water bath. The reaction mixture was then added dropwise to ice-water (700 mL) and the precipitated yellow solid was collected by filtration, washed with water and dried in air. The orange solid (5.907 g) was shown by 1H NMR to consist of a 2:1 mixture of compounds. Extraction of the aqueous filtrate from above<br>
with EtOAc gave an additional 1 g of material that was combined with the first crop and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using 015% EtOAc in CHCI3 as eluent. An orange solid 13-4 (4.11 g) was obtained (one isomer). Step 4:<br>
The nitroanilide 13-4 from step 3 (3.580 g) was dissolved in THF (50 mL) and the solution cooled in ice. lodomethane (4.155 mL, 66.7 mmol, 5 equivalents) and sodium tert-butoxide (6.414 g, 66.7 mmol, 5 equivalents) were added in two portions at a 3.5 h interval. Stirring at room temperature was continued for an additional 20 h after the second addition. THF was evaporated under reduced pressure and water (100 mL) was added. The deep red solution was washed with TBME (100 mL). The aqueous phase was acidified with cone. HCI and extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried and concentrated to give compound 13-5 as a dark red powder (3.78 g) that was used directly in step 5.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, wherein R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methyl iodide (CHal) in step 4 above with the appropriate R8-X, wherein X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, methanesulfonate (mesylate), p-toluenesulfonate (tosylate), trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate), and the like. Step 5:<br>
The free carboxylic acid 13-5 from step 4 (3.75 g) was suspended in 8M HCI (100 mL) and the mixture stirred at 100°C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, volatiles were evaporated under vacuum and the residue was co-evaporated 3 times with MeOH. Step 6:<br>
The residue from step 5 was suspended again in MeOH (100 mL) and cooled in ice-water. Thionyl chloride (5.10 mL, 5 equivalents) was added dropwise and the suspension stirred at 65°C for 4 h. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the residue 13-6 co-evaporated twice with MeOH (100 mL) and then toluene (2 x 100mL). Step 7:<br>
The residue 13-6 from step 6 was then dissolved in MeOH (200 mL), 20% Pd(OH)2 / C (500 mg) was added and the mixture stirred overnight under 1 atm of hydrogen gas. The catalyst was then removed by filtration and the solution evaporated to<br>
dryness. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and the solution washed with<br>
aqueous NaHCO3 and dried (MgS04). Removal of solvents gave a solid that was suspended in TBME (50 ml) and heated to 60°C for 30 min. An equal volume of hexane was then slowly added to the hot solution and the precipitated 4-amino-2-methoxy-5-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester 13-7 was collected by filtration, washed with TBME-hexane and dried (2.00 g).<br>
4-Amino-2-methoxy-5-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester 13-7 may be converted into the corresponding amine intermediates of general formula III in Scheme 1 following the procedures of Examples 3 or 7. These amine intermediates may be further converted into amine intermediates of general formula III in Scheme 1, wherein R5 is -OCH3 and R8 is -CH=C(R50)-COOR, by following the procedure of Example 8. All these amine intermediates of general formula III in Scheme 1 may be further elaborated to inhibitors of general formula I in Scheme 1 using the procedure of Example 4.<br>
It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the procedure of Example 13 may be applied to compound 12-2 from Example 12, or to its analogue wherein the ethoxy group has been replaced by a methoxy group, to produce diamine precursors of general formula IV in Scheme 2 or 3, wherein R6 is OCH3 or OEt. Such diamine precursors may also be converted to amine intermediates of general formula III in Scheme 1 following the procedures of Examples 3 or 7, and further elaborated to inhibitors of general formula I in Scheme 1, using the procedure of Example 4.example 14Stepl:(Figure Removed)3-Fluoro-4-nitrobenzaldehyde 9-3 from Example 9 (2.0 g, 11.8 mmol) was dissolved in THF (30 ml_) and excess methylamine (2M in THF, -21 ml, 42 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT until complete conversion was confirmed by HPLC (-2-3 h). The turbid solution was then evaporated to an orange solid which was extracted with ethyl acetate (2x 50 ml) and washed with 1 N HCI (shaken until the deep burgundy colour dissipated; 100 ml_), water (100 ml_) and brine (60 mL). The combined extracts were dried over anhydrous MgS04 and evaporated to give the methylamino intermediate 14-1 as an orange powder which was used in step 2 without any purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, where R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methylamine (CH3NH2) in step 1 above with the appropriate R8-NH2. Step 2:<br>
A solution of n-BuLi (2.5 M in THF, 14.4 ml, 36.0 mmol) in anhydrous THF (60 ml) was added slowly to a solution of TMS-diazomethane (10% in hexane, 18 mL, 36.0 mmol) at -78°C. The mixture was stirred at -78°C for 30 min, before a solution of the methylamino intermediate 14-1 from step 1 (2.16 g, 12.0 mmol, dissolved in 2 mL THF) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at -78°C for 1 h, and then allowed to warm up to RT and to stir for an additional 3 h before quenching by addition of H2O. The crude mixture was partitioned between saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (30 mL) and EtOAc (60 mL), the aqueous layer was extracted again with EtOAc (2x 60 mL) and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgS04 and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (using 20% EtOAc in hexane as the eluent) to give the desired alkyne 14-2 as a light brown solid (445 mg, -21 % yield). Step 3:<br>
In a thick-walled pressure tube, the alkyne 14-2 from step 2 (260 mg, 1.48 mmol) was dissolved in dry DMSO (6.0 mL) and TMS-azide (0.392 mL, 2.96 mmol) was added. The reaction was heated to 140°C for 2 h, then cooled and extracted with EtOAc (50 mL) and washed with brine (2x 50 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to obtain the crude triazole 14-3 as a yellow-brown solid which was used in step 4 without further purification.<br>
Step 4:<br>
The crude triazole intermediate 14-3 from step 3 (~1.10 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (10 ml_) and H20 (6 ml) which resulted in some precipitation of the starting material, K2CO3 (0.91 g, 6.58 mmol) and sodium hydrosulfite (1.15 g, 6.58 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at RT. The reaction mixture was then extracted with EtOAc (50 mL), the organic layer was washed with H2O (50 ml) and brine (30 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to a brown gum which contained A/2-methyl-4-(1 H-[1,2,3]triazol-4-yl)benzene-1,2-diamine 14-4 (amongst other minor products).<br>

The solution was diluted with EtOAc (-300 mL), the organic layer was washed with H2O (3x 50 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum to give the methylamino derivative 15-2 as a yellow solid (1.19 g). The crude material was used in step 2 without purification.<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, where R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methylamine (CH3NH2) in step 1 above with the appropriate R8-NH2. Step 2:<br>
A mixture of the methylamino derivative 15-2 from step 1 (105 mg, 0.56 mmol) and A/-methylpiperazine (0.5 mL) was heated to 90°C while stirring for 3 h and then at RT for an additional 15 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (-50 mL) and the organic layer was washed with H2O (3x 10 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum to give the piperazine derivative 15-3 as a yellow solid (140 mg) which was used in step 3 without purification.<br>
One skilled in the art will readily see that piperazine derivatives bearing other substituents may be readily used in place of A/-methylpiperazine in Step 2 above to prepare intermediates leading to other compounds of formula (I). Step 3:<br>
To a solution of the piperazine derivative 15-3 from step 2 (140 mg) in EtOH (6 mL), Pd/C (10%, 25 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred under an atmosphere of H2 at RT for 15 h.

The solution was then heated slowly to 105°C, the remaining KNOs was slowly added (temperature maintained below 110°C), and finally the solution was heated to 130°C for 15 min, allowed to cool back to RT, and poured on ice (500ml). The yellow solid formed was filtered, washed with water (50 ml), air dried for 2 h to yield 13.25 g (67%) of a 2:1 mixture of the desired product 18-2 and an unknown side-product. The mixture was used as such in step 2. Step 2:<br>
The crude dinitro carboxylic acid 18-2 (-13 g) from step 1 was dissolved in methanol (100 ml) and sulfuric acid (13.0 ml_) was added very slowly as the reaction is very exothermic. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 18 h. The solution was poured on ice (-500 ml), and the product was extracted with EtOAc (2x 100 ml). The organic layers were washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (3x 100 ml_), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to give the desired dinitro methyl ester intermediate 18-3 (9.54 g, 69% yield). Step 3:<br>
To a solution of the above dinitro arylchloride 18-3 (9.5 g, 36.5 mmol) in DMF (20 ml) at 0°, methylamine (2M in THF, 39.2 ml_, 74.7 mmol) was added with stirring. After a few minutes a crystalline solid was formed, the suspension was allowed to warm-up to RT and stirring was continued for 2 h. The reaction mixture was partitioned between H2O (200 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The organic solution was washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (100 ml), brine (3x 100 ml), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated to dryness to give the desired product 18-4 as a yellow-orange solid (7.09 g,76% yield).<br>
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that other diamine intermediates of general formula IV in Schemes 2 and 3 above, where R8 is other than methyl, may be prepared by replacing methylamine (CH3NH2) in step 3 above with the appropriate R8-NH2. Step 4:<br>
To a EtOH / H2O (100 ml, 1:1 ratio) suspension of the above dinitro aniline intermediate 18-4, K2CO3 (10.3 g, 74.5 mmol) was added with vigourous stirring, followed by the portion-wise addition of sodium hydrosulfite (13.0 g, 74.5 mmol). The yellow suspension turned blood red then black, became more homogeneous (slightly exothermic), then biphasic and a white precipitate was formed. After 30 minutes of stirring at RT, the EtOH was partly evaporated and the residue was diluted with H2O (100 ml). The reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2x 75 ml), the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporatedto yield a black amorphous solid 18-5 (1.26 g , 55%) which was used as such in step5. Step 5:<br>
To a stirred, ice cold solution of the above trianiline 18-5 (400 mg, 2.05 mmol) in acetonitrile (5 mL) under nitrogen, triethylamine (0.57 ml) was added, followed by the drop-wise addition of TrocCI (0.282 ml, 2.05 mmol). The deep purple solution was stirred and allowed to warm-up to RT over 2 h. The solvent was evaporated, the residue taken into EtOAc (30 ml), washed with 5% aqueous NaHC03 (2 x 20 mL) and brine (20 ml), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (using TLC grade silica gel and a solvent gradient from 30% to 60% EtOAc in hexane) to give the desired product 18-6 as a beige amorphous solid (459 mg, 60% yield). Step 6:<br>
To a stirred solution of above Troc-protected aniline derivative 18-6 (100 mg, 0.27 mmol) in CH2CI2 (1 mL), pyridine (0.032 mL, 0.4 mmol) followed by Fmoc-CI (80 mg, 0.31 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc (30 mL), the suspension was washed with 5% aqueous NaHC03 (2X10 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (using TLC grade silica gel and eluting with a solvent gradient from 20% to 30% EtOAc in hexane) to give two samples of the desired Fmoc-protected product 18-7; 47 mg of very pure product and 100 mg of slightly lower purity. Step 7:<br>
The doubly protected (Troc- and Fmoc-protected) trianinile derivative 18-7 (100 mg, -0.17 mmol) was dissolved in THF (1 mL) and acetic acid (0.25 mL) followed by freshly activated zinc (20.0 mg, 0.31 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at RT under nitrogen for 2h. The evolution of reaction was monitored by HPLC and after 2 h only -30 %'conversion was observed, therefore, more zinc (15 mg) was added and stirring was continued at 60°C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (30 mL), filtered over Celite and the filtrate was cooled in an ice bath and washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (20 mL); care must be taken to prevent build-up of excessive pressure.   The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgS04, and the solvent was evaporated to give the mono-protected intermediate 4-amino-2-(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonylamino)-5-(methylamino)benzoic acid methyl ester 18-8 as a white crystalline solid (68 mg, 96 % yield).<br>
Compound 18-8 was converted into the corresponding Fmoc-protected amine intermediates of general formula III in Scheme 1 following the procedures of Examples 3 or 7, and further elaborated to Fmoc-protected inhibitors of general formula Ic above, using the procedure of Example 4. These Fmoc-protected inhibitors of general formula Ic, or appropriate Fmoc-protected amine intermediates in their synthesis, may also be converted to Fmoc-protected inhibitors of general formula Id above, using the procedures of steps 1,2 and 3 of Example 8. In both cases, removal of the Fmoc protecting group may be carried out by treatment with piperidine, as is well known to one skilled in the art, and saponification of the ester group may be carried out under basic conditions (following protocols well known to those skilled in the art) to give inhibitors such as compounds 1032 (Table 1) and 3060 (Table 3). The free amine moiety of these inhibitors can be further reacted with reagents commonly known to those skilled in the art, such as isopropyl chloroformate and the like, to form inhibitors such as compound 1033 (Table 1).<br>

The mixture was purged by bubbling Ar through it for 10 min and pinacolborane (4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane; 3.0 mL, 20 mmol, 2.2 equiv.) was added by syringe. The resulting dark brown mixture was stirred at 68°C for 16 h under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then cooled to RT and the 5-bromo-2-<br>
iodopyrimidine (3.0 g, 10.5 mmol, 1.18 equiv.) was added as a solid, followed by<br>
careful, slow addition of a cooled suspension of K3PO4 (10.5 g, 47.1 mmol, 5.4 equiv.) in water (7 ml_). Alternatively, the addition of K3PO4 may precede the addition of 5-bromo-2-iodopyrimidine. The dark brown reaction mixture was then heated to 80°C under argon for 24 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and poured into 10% aqueous NaCI (100 ml). The brown suspension was extracted with EtOAc (150 ml). The extract was washed with water (2 x 50 ml_) and brine (100 ml_), dried and concentrated to 50 ml. Cooling 2 h in the fridge gave a beige precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed with a small amount of EtOAc and dried. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was slurried in acetone (20 ml), heated to boiling and cooled in the fridge overnight. The solid was filtered and the combined solids were further purified by chromatography using CHCIa as solvent to give the desired indole ester 19-2 as a beige solid in 77% yield. Step 2:<br>
The ester 19-2 (300 mg, 0.72 mmol) was suspended in DMSO (10 ml_) and the suspension warmed gently to dissolve the solid. The slightly cloudy yellow solution was cooled and stirred while 2.5 N NaOH (2.0 ml, 5.0 mmol, 8.6 equiv.) was added and stirring was continued for 4 h at RT. The mixture was slowly poured into 0.5 N HCI (200 ml). The yellow precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and dried to give compound 19-3 (273 mg, 94% yield, 100% homogeneity).<br>

The solution was then heated at 40°C with stirring and a white solid started to form (Et3NH+CI"). After heating for ~6 hrs, TLC (in 20% ethyl acetate in hexane) showed that the reaction was -60% complete. Another two equivalents of the methylamine solution in THF (330 mL) was added and the mixture was heated at 40°C with stirring for another 16 hours. TLC showed that all starting material was consumed. The reaction mixture<br>

Cell-based luciferase reporter HCV RNA Replication Assay<br>
Cell culture:<br>
Huh-7 cells with a stable subgenomic HCV replicon that encodes a modified luciferase reporter gene (expressed as a luciferase-FMDV2A-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion gene) were established as previously described (Lohman etal., 1999. Science 285: 110-113; Vroljiketal., 2003 J.Virol Methods 110:201-209.), with the exception that replicon cells were selected with 0.25 mg/mL G418. The amount of luciferase expressed by selected cells directly correlates with the<br>
level of HCV replication. These cells, designated as MP-1 cells, are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Earle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.25 mg/mL neomycin (standard medium). The cells are passaged by trypsinization and frozen in 90% FBS/10% DMSO. During the assay, DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, containing 0.5% DMSO and lacking neomycin, was used (Assay medium). The day of the assay, MP-1 cells were trypsinized and diluted to 100 000 cells/ml in assay medium. 100 µL is distributed into each well of a black 96-well ViewPlate™ (Packard). The plate was then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for two hours.<br>
Reagents and Materials:(Table Removed)Preparation of test compound:<br>
The test compound in 100% DMSO was first diluted in assay medium to a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. The solution was sonicated for 15 min and filtered through a 0.22 µM Millipore Filter unit. Into column 3 of a Polypropylene Deep-Well Titer Plate, the appropriate volume is transferred into assay medium to obtain the starting concentration (2x) to be tested. In columns 2 and 4 to 12, add 200 yuL of assay medium (containing 0.5% DMSO). Serial dilutions (1/2) are prepared by transferring 200 µL from column 3 to column 4, then from column 4 to column 5, serially through to column 11. Columns 2 and 12 are the no inhibition controls.<br>
Addition of test compound to cells:<br>
A volume of 100//L from each well of the compound dilution plate was transferred to a corresponding well of the Cell Plate (Two columns will be used as the "No inhibition control"; ten [10] columns are used for the dose response). The cell culture plate was incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 72 hours.<br>
Luciferase assay:<br>
Following the 72 h incubation period, the medium was aspirated from the 96-well assay plate and a volume of 100 uL of 1X Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) previously warmed to room temperature was added to each well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 min with occasional shaking. A black tape was put at the bottom of the plate. 100 //L of Bright-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) previously warmed to room temperature was added to each well followed by gentle mixing. The luminescence was determined on a Packard Topcount instrument using the Data Mode Luminescence (CPS) with a count delay of 1 min and a count time of 2 sec.<br><br>
(Table Removed)The luminescence determination (CPS) in each well of the culture plate was ameasure of the amount of HCV RNA replication in the presence of variousconcentrations of inhibitor. The % inhibition was calculated with the following<br>
equation:% inhibition = 100- [CPS (inhibitor) / CPS (control) x 100]<br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software; SAS Institute, Inc. Gary, N.C.).<br>
TABLES OF COMPOUNDS<br>
All compounds listed in Tables 1 to 4 below were found to have unexpectedly good activity in the cell-based HCV RNA replication assay described in Example 41.<br>
Retention times (tR) for each compound were measured using the standard analytical HPLC conditions described in the Examples. As is well known to one skilled in the art, retention time values are sensitive to the specific measurement conditions. Therefore, even if identical conditions of solvent, flow rate, linear gradient, and the like are used, the retention time values may vary when measured, for example, on different HPLC instruments. Even when measured on the same instrument, the values may vary when measured, for example, using different individual HPLC columns, or, when measured on the same instrument and the same individual column, the values may vary, for example, between individual measurements taken on different occasions.(Table Removed) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
