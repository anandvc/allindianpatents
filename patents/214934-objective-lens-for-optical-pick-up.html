				<td>Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an objective lens for optical pick-up of an optical disc apparatus that is able to record/reproduce a plurality of kinds of optical discs whose cover layers have different thickness. Particularly, the present invention relates to the objective lens that has a diffractive lens structure formed on a surface of a refractive lens.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The optical disc includes an information layer on which digital information is recorded, and a transparent cover layer that covers the information layer. A laser beam from the optical pick-up is converged to form a beam spot on the information layer through the cover layer. The distance between the optical pick-up and the information layer varies depending upon the thickness of the cover layer.<br>
Namely, the thicker the cover layer is, the farther the distance to the beam spot from the optical pick-up is. For example, since the cover layer of a compact disc (CD) or that of a CD-R has the thickness of 1.2 mm, and the thickness of the cover layer of a digital versatile disc (DVD) is 0.6 mm, the optical pick-up is required to move the beam spot away from the<br>
opcical pick-up by 0.6 mm in the cover layer (0.4 nun in air) when che DVD is replaced with che CD or the CD-R.<br>
Although a paraxial beam spot moves as the objective lens is moved, the change of the thickness of the cover layer changes spherical aberration. If the opcical pick-up only moves the objective lens when the disc is replaced, wave front aberration of the laser beam is deteriorated, thereby the diameter of che beam spot is increased, which prevents the optical disc apparatus from reproducing the recorded information from the CD. For instance, when the objective lens, which is designed to minimize che spherical aberration when the recorded information is reproduced from che DVD, is used for reproducing the information from the CD. the spherical aberration becomes too large to reproducing che information even if the objective lens moves to bring the beam spot co be coincident with the informacion layer.<br>
Therefore, there is known, as a prior art, an opcical pick-up thac adjusts the condition of The laser beam entering into the objective lens according to the thickness of the cover<br>
laver.<br>
*<br>
For example, Japanese Provisional Patent Publ.Lcat.ian No .<br>
7-98431 discloses such an opcical pick-up. The optical<br>
system shown in this publication employs a holographic lens on<br>
-<br>
the lasersource side of the objeccive lens to divide the lasor beam from the laser source into a zero order paz.illal diffractive beam and a first order divergent dif tractive beain. The zero order diffractive beam is used for the optical disc<br><br>
having a thinner cover layer (i.e., the DVD), the first order diffractive beam is used for the optical disc having a thicker cover layer (i.e. , the CD and CD-R) . The optical pick-up of the publication enables to form the diffraction-limited beam spots for the respective optical discs when the holographic lens is designed to obtain the most suitable laser beams according to the thickness of the cover layers.<br>
However, since the optical pick-up of the publication always divides the laser beam from the laser source into the zero and first order diffractive beams, and only one of these beams is used for recording/reproducing information at a time, the maximum efficiency in use of the light quantity is not more than 40%.<br>
Further, when one of the diffractive beams is being used for recording/reproducing the information, the other diffractive beam is an unnecessary beam, which increases noises.<br>
Still further, the recording density of the DVD is higher than that of the CD, which requires the optical pick-up for the DVD co form a smaller beam spot than the optical pick-up designed for the exclusive use of the CD (hereinafter referred as an exclusive CD pick-up) . Since the diameter of the beam spot has a positive correlation with the wavelength of the laser beam, the optical pick-up for the DVD requires the laser source whose oscillation wavelength is 635 through 665 nm that is shorter than the oscillation wavelength of the exclusive CD pick-up (i.e., 780 through 830 nm). On the other hand, the reflection<br>
characteristics of the CD-R requires the laser source whose oscillation wavelength is about 780 nrn.<br>
Accordingly, when the optical pick-up having a single laser source as described in the publication employs a laser source that emits a laser beam having a shorter oscillation wavelength, it cannot reproduce the information from tho CD-R.<br>
Brief Descrition of rhe<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an. objective lens for an optical pick-up, which is capable of recording/ reproducing information on a plurality nf kinds of the optical discs (e.g., CD. CD-R and DVD) of which the the cover layers are different in the thickness. Further, the present invention is aimed to provide the objective lens that has higher efficiency in use of the light quantify chan the conventional optical pick-up as disclosed in the above-identified publication.<br>
For the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided an improved objective lens for an optical pick-up, which includes a refractive lens having a positive refractive power, and a diffractive lens structure having a plurality of concentric ring-shaped steps that are formed on at least one lens surface of the refractive lens. The diff ractive lens structure has wavelength dependence such that at least two light beams having different wavelength with an identical diffractive order form appropriate wavef ronts for ar. least: two kinds of optical discs respectively provided with<br>
cover layers having different thickness.<br>
Namely, the predetermined order diffraccive light beam forms the appropriate wavefront for the optical disc having a predetermined thickness cover layer at the predetermined wavelength, and forms the appropriate wavefront for the optical disc having a different thickness cover layer at the different wavelength.<br>
With this construction, a change of the wavelength of the laser beam corresponding to the thickness of the cover layer of the optical disc causes the predetermined order diffractive light to converge onto each of the information layers with forming of an appropriate spot.<br>
Further, the diffractive lens structure is preferable to having a wavelength dependence such that a short wavelength diffractive light forms an appropriate wavefront for an optical disc having a thinner cover and a long wavelength diffractive light forms an appropriate wavefront for an optical disc having a thicker cover layer. More particularly, the diffractive lens structure may change spherical aberration in the undercorrected direction as wavelength of incident light increases.<br>
As described above, the spherical aberration varies in the overcorrected direction as the thickness of the cover layer increases. Therefore, when a longer wavelength laser source is used for an optical disc having a thicker cover layer, and a shorter wavelength laser source is used for an optical disc having a thinner cover layer, the change of the spherical aberration due to change of the cover layer's thickness is<br>
corrected by the above-mentioned wavelength dependence of the diftractive  lens structure.<br>
An additional optical path length added by a diftractive lens  structure is expressed by the  following optical  path difference  function. <br>
Φ{h) :<br>
Φ(h)   =   (P2h2 + P4h4 + P6h6 +   ...)   x <br>
where P,. P4 and P, are dif fractive coefficients cf second, fourth and sixth orders, h is a height from che optical axis and X is wavelength of incident light.<br>
The objective lens according to the present invention    may satisfy  the  following  condition   (1) ,-<br>
(1)	-15 
where ha5 is the height from the optical axis of a point where a light ray whose NA is 0.45 intersects the dif fractive lens structure.<br>
Further, it is desirable for the refractive lens and the dif fractive lens structure to have total longitudinal chromatic aberration such that the backfocus increases as the wavelength of the incident light increases. In such a case, it rs advisable that, the following condition (2) is satisfied;<br>
(2)	-0.8 
where ACA is a movement of a par axial focal point with shict of wavelength and ASA is a variation of spherical aberration for marginal rays with the shift of wavelength.<br>
The dif fractive lens structure of the objective; lens according to the present invention may have a small paraxial power, and it is desirable to satisfy the following condition<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where f0 is the focal length of the diftractive leris structure that is defined as the following equation;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
When the optical discs includes at least two kinds of optical discs whose cover layers have 1.2 nun and 0.6 nun in thickness, the following condition (4) is desirable to be satisfied;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
where X, is wavelength of the light for the optical disc having the 0.6 mm cover layer, and  is wavelength of the light for the optical disc having the 1.2 mm cover layer.<br>
Still further, the blazed wavelength A, of the dif fractive lens structure in the center region around the optical axis may satisfy a condition of X. 
(5)	0.87 
(6)	B /  
The blazed wavelength of the dif fractive lens structure in the peripheral region may be shorter than the blazed wavelength X, of the diffractive lens structure in the center region. Alternatively, peripheral region of the lens surface on which the diffractive lens structure is formed may be a continuous surface without steps. The peripheral region is defined as a region where a height from the optical axis falls in the range of about 85% through 100% of the effective radius<br>
of the refractive lens. It should be noted that the diffractive lens structure blazed for the shorter wavelength or the aberration-compensated continuous surface for the shorter wavelength may be formed inside the peripheral region.<br>
Accordingly, present invention provides for an objective lens for an optical pick-up, comprising:<br>
a refractive lens having a positive refractive power; and<br>
a diffractive lens structure having a plurality of concentric ring-shaped steps that are formed on at least one lens surface of said refractive lens,<br>
wherein said diffractive lens structure has wavelength dependence such that at least two light beams having different wavelength with an identical diffractive order form appropriate wavefronts for at least two kinds of optical discs respectively provided with cover layers having different thickness.<br>

Description of the Embodiments<br>
Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C show an objective lens 10 according to embodiments: Fig. 1A is a front view; Fig. IB is a vertical cross-sectional view; and Fig. 1C is an enlarged side view of Fig. 1B. The objective lens 10 is applied to an optical pick-up of an optical disc apparatus that is capable of recording/reproducing a plurality of kinds of optical discs (e.g., CD, CD-R and DVD) provided with cover layers having different thickness. The objective lens 10 converges incident light emitted from a light source (i.e. , a semiconductor laser) onto an information layer through the cover layer of the optical disc.<br>
The objective lens 10 is a biconvex plastic lens having first and second aspherical surfaces 11 and 12. A diffractive lens structure is formed on the first surface 11 of the objective lens 10. The diffractive lens structure is formed, similar to a Fresnel lens, as a large number of concentric rings each of which has a wedge sectional shape. Each of the boundaries between the adjacent rings is formed as a step giving a<br>
predetermined optical parb difference.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an optical system of the optical pick-up on which the objective lens 10 is installed. The optical system includes a DVD module 21. a CD module 22, a beam combiner 23, a collimator lens 24 and the objective lens 10. Each of the. modules 21 and 22 is provided with a semiconductor laser and a sensor that are mounted on a common substrate. The objective lens 10 is mounted on a focus adjusting mechanism to adjust the lens position corresponding to the position of Che information layer of the optical disc.<br>
The DVD is a thin cover type optical dine. The thickness of the cover layer of the DVD is 0.6 mm. In order to form a fine beam spot on the DVD. a laser beam whose wavelengr.h is within a range of 635 nm through 665 nm is required. On the other hand, the CD-R and the CD are thick cover type optical discs. The thickness of the cover layer of the CD-R or the CD is 1.2 mm. The CD-R requires a laser beam of about 780 nm wavelength due to ins spectral reflectance.<br>
Therefore, a semiconductor laser of the DVD module 21 emits the laser beam of 635nm or 650 nm wavelength, a semiconductor laser of the CD module 22 emits the laser beeim or 780 run wavelength.<br>
The laser beam emitted from the semiconductor laser converges onto the information layer through the cover layer Dl (shown by a solid line) or D2 (shown by a. dotted line) .<br>
When the thin cover type optical disc having the thin cover layer Dl is used, the DVD module 21 is operated to emit<br>
the laser beam L1 (shown by a solid line) . The laser beam LI is converged onto the information layer of the thin cover type optical disc through the thin cover layer Dl. When the thick cover type optical disc having the thick cover layer D2 is used, the CD module 22 is operated to emit the laser beam L2 (shown by a dotted line). The laser beam L2 is converged onto the information layer of the thick cover type optical disc through the thick cover layer D2.<br>
The dif Tractive lens structure has wavelength dependence such that a predetermined order diffractive light, which is a first order diffractive light in the embodiments, forms an appropriate wavefront for the thin cover type optical disc at a wavelength of 635 nm or 650 nm, and forms an appropriate wavefront for the thick cover type optical disc at a wavelength of 780 nm. In the embodiments, the diffractive lens structure has a wavelength dependence such that spherical aberration changes in the undercorrected direction as wavelength of incident light increases.<br>
The spherical aberration changes in the overcorrected direction as the thickness of the cover layer increases. Further, the diffractive lens structure changes the spherical aberration in the undercorrected direction as the wavelength of the incident laser beam increases. And thus, since a longer wavelength laser beam is used for the thick cover type optical disc, and a shorter wavelength laser beam is used for the thin cover type optical disc, the change of the spherical aberration due to change of the cover layer's thickness is corrected by<br>
the change of the spherical aberration due to the; wave length dependence of the diftractive lens structure.<br>
An additional optical path length added by a dif tractive lens structure is expressed by the following optical path difference function Φ(h) -.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where P2, Pt and P. are coefficients of second, fourth and sixth orders, h is a height from the optical axis and A is a wavelength of incident light. The function Φ(n) represents an optical path difference between an imaginary ray that is assumed not to be diffracted by the grating and a ray that is, diffracted by the grating, at a point on the diftractive lens structure: where the height from the optical axis is h. In such an expression. a negative value of the second order coefficient Prepresents a positive paraxial power of the diffractive lens structure. Further, the negative power increases with increasing the distance from the optical axis when the fourth order coefficient P, is larger than zero.<br>
An actual microscopic shape of the diffracuive lens structure is defined like a Fresnel lens having a large number of concentric rings. The actual shape Φ (h! is defined by subtracting Ax m (m : integer) from Φ(h) as follows.<br>
 Φ'(h)=(MOD(p2h2+p4h4+...c1-1)-c)xSymbol As is a blazed wavelength for which the seeps ot the grating gives an optical path difference by one wavelengc.h, and the diffractive efficiency becomes the maximum at. the blazed wavelength 3. Symbol C is a constant defining a phasci at a<br>
boundary between adjacent rings (0 ≤ C
The objective lens 10 satisfies the following condition (1);<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where h45 is the height from the optical axis of a point where a light ray whose NA is 0.45 intersects the diffractive 1ens structure.<br>
When the condition (1) is satisfied, the variation of the spherical aberration due to change of the cover layer's thickness can be effectively counterbalanced by the variation of the spherical aberration of the diffractive lens structure due to the wavelength change. If the intermediate term of the condition (1) becomes lower than -15,-the variation of the spherical aberration due to shift of wavelength becomes too large. Since the wavelength of the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser has a tolerance of about ±5 nm due to an individual difference, if the variation of the spherical aberration is relatively large with respect to the change of the wavelength, it becomes impossible to use a semiconductor laser emitting a laser beam whose wavelength is different from the standard wavelength. This requires selection of the<br>
semiconductor lasers, which decreases produceiviry To avoid the above situation, the compensation effect of the spherical aberration by the diffractive lens structure is, therefore, desirable to be slightly less than sufficient.<br>
On the other hand, when the intermediate term of the condition (1) exceeds -7, the variation of the spherical aberration due to shift of wavelength becomes too small, which cannot counterbalance the variation of the spherical aberration due to the change of the cover layer's chickness . Futher. che most suitable value of che intermediate term of che condition (1) is about -11 when the 635 through 665 run wavelength laser beam is used for the thin cover type optical disc and the 780 run wavelength laser beam is used for the thick cover cype optic.il disc.<br>
The shift of wavelength of the laser due to the chanqe of temperature causes the backfocus of the objective lens to change, which causes focus error. Since the change of backfocus due to temperature change are very slow, the focus error can be corrected by the focus adjusting mechanism in the optical pick-up.<br>
On the other hand, the wavelength of the laser is rapidly changed by switching of the laser output between high and low levels during recording operation. The rapid shift of wavelength also causes the focus error, and it cannor. be perfectly corrected by the focus adjusting mechanism. Thus, it is desirable chat the objective lens 10 is constituted such that movement of the focal point is reduced.<br>
The movement of the focal point may be reduced by correcting longitudinal chromatic aberration in general. However, since the objective lens of the embodiment has the wavelength dependence in the spherical aberration, the perfect correction in the longitudinal chromatic aberration, on the contrary, increases the movement of the best focus position. Thus the correction of the chromatic aberration should be balanced with the variation of the spherical aberration due to shift of wavelength.<br>
For the purpose, the refractive lens and the diffractive lens structure of the embodiment have total longitudinal chromatic aberration such that the backfocus increases as the wavelength of the incident light increases, and the following condition (2) is satisfied,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where ACA is a movement of a paraxial focal point with shift of wavelength and ASA is a variation of spherical aberration for marginal rays with the shift of wavelength.<br>
When the condition (2) is satisfied, increasing of the wavelength moves the paraxial focal point away from the lens and moves the focal point by the marginal rays closer to the lens. If the spherical aberration is almost corrected at the standard wavelength , the paraxial focal point at the increased wavelength  (&gt;o) is farther from the lens than the paraxial focal point at the standard wavelength , and the focal point by the marginal rays at the increased wavelength 3 is closer to the lens than the paraxial focal point at the standard<br>
wavelength  Therefore, the movement of the best focus position, which is an average from the paraxial focal point LC the focal point by the marginal rays, can be reduced.<br>
Further, che objective lens 10 satisfies the following condition (3) to reduce the movement of the best focus position due to rapid shift of wavelength. (3) -0.020 
where fs is the focal lengch of che diffractive lens structure chat is defined as the following equation; F0 = I/ (-P2 x 2).<br>
The condition (3) defines the compensation effect for the longicudinal chromatic aberracion. It is known chat a. value corresponding to Abbe number for a diffraccive lens is equal co -3 .453 . The negative sign of che value refleccs the opposite sense of che dispersion when compared wich chat of ref raccive lenses, and ics low magnitude is an indication of che large dispersion. Therefore, a use of a diffraccive lens scructure having small power in associacion with che refraccive lens compensaces che chromatic aberration.<br>
When the condition (3) is satisfied, the movement of cho best focus position due to rapid shift of wavelength can be reduced while keeping che compensacion ef f ecc for the spherical aberration due to the change of the cover layer's thickness. The wavelengths of the laser beam are selected so as to satisfy the following condicion (4); (4) 0.75 
type optical disc, and X, is wavelength of the laser beam for the thick cover type optical disc.<br>
When the condition (4) is satisfied, the dif tractive lens structure sufficiently changes the spherical aberration due to the shift of wavelength. The ratio of the wavelengths X1 and X, represents amount of the wavefront aberration caused by the one step of the diftractive lens structure. For example, when  is 650 rim,  is 780 nm and the amount of the wavefront aberration at 650 run is considered as the standard value, the wavefront aberration of (780 - 650)7780=0.1666X is added to the standard value per one step at 780 nm. If the ratio of the condition (4) is larger than 0.87, a number of steps of the diftractive lens structure increases in order to obtain a predetermined wavefront aberration with loss of light amount at the edge of the steps . Further, the variation of the spherical aberration with the shift of wavelength becomes too large, which prohibits the use of a semiconductor laser whose laser wavelength is different from the standard wavelength.<br>
On the other side, when the ratio , is smaller than 0.75, the difference between these wavelengths becomes too large, the averaged diftractive efficiency becomes too small. The blazed wavelength  at which the maximum diffractive efficiency is obtained is selected at the time of the design of the microscopic construction of the diffractive lens structure. The blazed wavelength  of the diffractive lens structure in the center region around the optical axis satisfies a condition of , 
set at any wavelength between and S<br>
Fig. 27 is a graph showing the diffractive efficiencies when the blazed wavelength is set at 635 nm, 690 nm or 710 nm. In any cases, the diffractive efficiencies at 635 nm and 780 nm are larger than about 90 %. This shows sufficiently larger values as compared with 40 % in the optical system disclosed in the Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. HEI 7-98431.<br>
Still further, the objective lens 10 of the embodiments satisfies the following conditions (5) and (6) to further increase the diffractive efficiency.<br>
(5)	0.87 
(6)	 /  
When the blazed wavelength Xa is close to one of the wavelengths at  and . the diffractive efficiency at the farther wavelength from the blazed wavelengch a decreases . When the conditions (5) and (6) are satisfied, the diffractive efficiency becomes about 95 % or more at both of the wavelengths  and  .<br>
The blazed wavelength of the diffractive lens structure in the peripheral region is shorter than the blazed wavelengch X,, of the diffractive lens structure in the center region. Alternatively, peripheral region of the lens surface, on which the diffractive lens structure is formed, in formed as a continuous surface wichouc steps. The peripheral region is<br>
defined as a region where a height from the optical axis falls in the range of 85% through 100% of the effective radius of the refractive lens.<br>
The DVD requires NA of 0.60, while NA of 0.50 is enough for the CD or CD-R. The laser beam outside the NA of 0.50 has, on the contrary, a bad influence on the reproducing of the CD or CD-R. The laser beam having 0.6 in NA forms a too small beam spot for the CD or CD-R. Therefore, the peripheral region is desirable to be an exclusive use of the DVD. When the blazed wavelength of the peripheral region is shorter than the center portion, the dif tractive efficiency for the CD or CD-R decreases and that for DVD increases. When the peripheral region is the continuous surface where the aberration is corrected for the DVD, the peripheral region operates to converge the laser beam for the DVD.<br>
Still further, spherical aberration of a positive refractive lens varies in the overcorrected direction as temperature rises due to decreasing of the refractive index, and the semiconductor laser has temperature dependence such that wavelength of the emitted laser increases as temperature rises. When the temperature rises, the refractive lens changes the spherical aberration in the overcorrected direction, and the dif tractive lens structure changes the spherical aberration in the undercorrected direction because the wavelength of the light emitted from the semiconductor laser increases. Thus the changes of the spherical aberrations caused by the refractive lens and the diffractive lens structure can be counterbalanced<br><br>
to each ocher.<br>
Therefore, when Che objective lens 10 is made from resin<br>
whose refractive index decreases as temperature increases, the<br><br>
diffractive lens structure is desirable to be formed in the peripheral region as well as in the center region . In such a case, the dif tractive lens structure in the peripheral region is desirable co have shorter blazed wavelength than that in the center region in order to increases the diffractive efficiency of the laser beam for the DVD.<br>
Six embodiments according to Che above mentioned construction will be described hereinafter. The objective lens 10 of the embodiments are designed for the compatible optical pick-up for both of the thin cover type optical disc having 0 . 6 mm thickness cover layer such as a DVD and the thick cover type optical disc having 1 . 2 mm thickness cover layer such as a CD or a CD-R. The diffractive lens structure is formed on the first surface in the first, second, third and fourth embodiments, and is formed on the second surface in the fifth and sixth embodiments .<br>
Fig. 3 shows the objective lens 10 of the first embodiment and the cover layer D, Of the thin cover type optical disc. Fig. 5 shows the objective lens 10 with the cover laynr D2 of the thick cover type optical disc. The numerical constructions thereof are described in TABLE 1. The surfaces #1 and if #2 represent the objective lens 10 and the surfaces #3 and #4<br><br>
represent the cover layer of the optical disc.<br>
In TABLE 1, NA denotes numerical aperture, f (unit : mm) denotes the total focal length ,  f0 (unit : mm) denotes focal length of the diffractive lens structure, co (unit : degree) denoces half angle of view,  (unit : nm) denotes the wavelength for the thin cover type optical disc,  (unit : nm) denotes the wavelength for the thick cover type optical disc,  (unit : nm) denotes a blazed wavelength, h45 (unit : mm) denotes the height from the optical axis of a point where a light ray of which NA is 0.45 intersects the diffractive lens structure, r (unit : mm) denotes a radius of curvature of a surface (the values at the vertex for aspherical surface) , d1 (unit : mm) denotes a distance between the surfaces along the optical axis for the thin cover type optical disc, d2 (unit : mm) denotes the distance for the thick cover type optical disc, n denotes a refractive index at a wavelength X nm and vd denotes an Abbe number.<br>
The base curve of the first surface 11 (surface #1.) is aspherical. The base curve is defined as a shape of the refractive lens that does not include the diffractive lens structure. The second surface 12 (surface #2) is also an aspherical surface. An aspherical surface is expressed by the following equation:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
X(h) is a SAG, that is, a distance of a curve from a tangential plane at a point on the surface where the height from the optical axis is h. Symbol c is a curvature ( 1/r) of the vertex<br><br>
of the surface. K is a conic constant, A4. A5. A6. A10 and A12 are aspherical surface coefficients of fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth and twelfth orders. The constant K and coefficients A. through A12 of the first and second surfaces of the objective lens 10 are shown in the following TABLE 2 .<br>

Figs. 4A through 4C show third order aberrations of the objective lens according to the first embodiment when the thin cover type optical disc is used at wavelength of 650 nm: Fig. 4A shows spherical aberration SA and sine condition SC at wavelength 650 nm; Fig. 4B shows chromatic aberration represented by spherical aberrations at wavelengths 650 nm, 645 nm and 655 nm; and Fig. 4C shows astigmatism (S: Sagittal, M: Meridional).<br>
The vertical axes in Figs. 4A and 4B represent the numerical aperture NA, and the vertical axis in Fig. 4C represents image height Y. Unit of the horizontal axis is "mm" in each of Figs. 4A through 4C. Figs. 6A, 6B and 6C are graphs that are similar to Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C when the thick cover type optical disc is used at wavelength of 780 nm.<br>
The spherical aberration is sufficiently corrected at both of 650 nm and 780 nm as shown in Figs. 4A and 6A.<br>
The paraxial focal point moves such that the backfocus increases as the wavelength of the incident light increases.<br>
The movement of the paraxial focal point ACA by +5 nm shift of wavelength is represented by the width between the lower ends ct the curves for 650 nm and 655 nm in Fig. 4B. The variation of spherical aberration for marginal rays ASA by *5 run shift of wavelength is represented by the width between the upper end of the curve for 650 nm and the upper end of the parallel translated curve from the curve for 655 nm so that the lownr end thereof is moved to the lower end of the curve for 650 nm. Because the ratio of these values satisfies the condition (2) . the curves for 650 nm and 655 nm in Fig. 4B intersect the vertical axis, which represents the moving amount of the best focus position due to the rapid shift of wavelength becomes relatively small.<br>

Thus, the peripheral region is defined ds a region where a height from the optical axis falls in the range of 75 -5% through 100% of the effective radius in the first embodiment.<br>
In order to optimize the peripheral region for the thin cover type optical disc, the peripheral region may be formed<br><br>
as the diffractive lens scruccure blazed for 650 nm or Che concinuous surface compensated in aberrations for 650 nm. When the peripheral region is formed as the continuous surface, the diffractive lens structure blazed for 710 nm is formed in the center region. The center region includes a center circular portion and first through fifteenth ring-shaped steps. The sixteenth ring covers the peripheral region that is rotationally symmetric aspherical surface defined by the following coefficients in Table 3 .
