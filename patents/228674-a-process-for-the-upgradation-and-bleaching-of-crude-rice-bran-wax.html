				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the up-gradation and bleaching of crude rice bran wax, obtained during refining of crude rice bran oil. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for refining and purification of crude rice bran wax obtained during de-waxing stage of refining process of rice bran oil to an essentially wax ester product which involves, a) removal of the triglycerides oil, b) removal of polymeric resinous material, c) bleaching of upgraded wax to obtain a pale yellow colored product that has potential in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Depending on the intended application, some of these process steps may be omitted; for example, if the intended application is for industrial uses such as polishes, carbon paper, etc, the color may not be a great hindrance.<br>
Background and Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
About 3.8 lakh tons of crude rice bran oil is processed in India every year (India is the world's largest producer of rice bran oil) and an important step in the processing of the oil is the removal of waxes present in the oil (de-waxing). Rice bran oil has the highest wax content among vegetable oils and can reach up to 5% [F.T. Orthoefer, in Bailey's Industrial Oil and Fat Products edited by Y.H. Hui, John Wiley &amp; ONS, Inc., New York p.393 (1996)]. Thus, there is a potential of about 28,000 tons of wax with a multitude of potential applications including paper coating, candles, waterproofing polish (floor, furniture and shoe), carbon paper, printing inks, adhesives, fruit and vegetable coatings, cosmetics, pharmaceutical preparations, etc. Purified rice bran also can at least partially substitute camauba wax, which is totally imported. The crude wax separated from the oil retains about 25% or more amount of oil, so the crude wax produced in the country is estimated to be around 35,000 to 60,000 tons. This product is presently underutilized for want of suitable processing technologies. The present invention provides for such a technology. A large number of industrial crude wax samples have been processed by the present process to test its efficacy.<br>
There have been sporadic attempts to purify the crude rice bran wax. These have generally been restricted to removal ot the oil present along with the wax. while the exact composition of the wax is not known, there have been reports on the possible<br><br><br>
presence [V.K. Belavadi and D.N. Bhowmick, J. Amer. Oil Chem. Soc. 65: 241-245 (1988)] of polymeric compounds in the wax. Removal of these components is of immense importance in the refining process so that the final product is acceptable for use in food pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Earlier methods have not been successful in total removal of such compounds (hereafter referred to as "resinous matter"). The wax after removal of oil has an unacceptable dark color, largely due to these resinous materials. Physical methods of color removal such as adsorption onto bleaching clays and carbon are not effective and chemical methods, mainly oxidative bleaching, have been resorted to, frequently under drastic conditions that may chemically alter the wax components. For bleaching to be effective, it is essential that the resinous matter is totally removed from the wax as reported in the present invention. Mild conditions can then be employed, as shown in the present invention, for bleaching the wax.<br>
As stated before, earlier attempts have largely been restricted to removal of the oil from the crude wax followed by bleaching. Chung - Sung et al, used isopropanol to remove the resinous matter from rice bran oil filter mud (Chemistry Taipei, 1961, 185-7, CA: 58: 3619) at 65°C in a ratio of 8:1. Eventhough the researchers tried to separate some resinous matter from rice bran oil filter mud, it was not possible to separate resinous matter quantitatively at 65°C when the wax is not dissolved completely in the isopropanol at this temperature. This procedure was also not tried for commercially produced crude rice bran wax obtained during the de-waxing step of rice bran oil processing.<br>
Bleached rice bran wax was prepared by dissolving rice wax in methyl ethyl ketone at 76-77°C and cooled to 55°C followed by bleaching using a number of bleaching agents such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium chlorite, oxalic acid, sorbitan sesquioleate in sequence [Ishii Masakatsu, JP: 76,30,204 (1976)]. In this process at least five bleaching agents were used in sequence and hence may not be a commercially feasible process.<br>
Cousins., et al [JAOCS, 30: 9-14 (1953)] reported some protocols to process a typical sample of tank settling from crude rice bran oil in various ways to obtain a hard, non tacky wax fraction. The procedures consists of removal of the oil from the tank settlings by washing with acetone, destruction of the phosphatides through hydrolysis<br><br>
or saponification, and subsequent purification by fractionation from isopropanol; another involved hydration of the tank settlings, followed by separation of the aqueous and oil phases, and fractionation of oil phase from isopropanol solution. The waxes were bleached by hydrogen peroxide and by chromium trioxide in the presence of H2SO4 solution or by combination of these reagents Chung - Sung et al (Chemistry Taipei, 1961, 185-7, CA: 58: 3619) also purified the wax by heating it with CrO3 and 40% H2SO4 in a ratio of 1:1.5 (wt/wt) at 95°C for 2 hr. In another report acetone fractionated rice bran wax was bleached with 0.5 parts by wt. of H2O2 as well as 0.5 and 1 part by wt. of chromium trioxide with 4.5 to 5 parts of sulphuric acid for every part of wax (S. D. Tirumala Rao and K.V. Rao, Indian Oil &amp; Soap Journal 29, (1964) 177). In all the above processes, rice bran wax was bleached with hydrogen peroxide followed by chromium trioxide in presence of sulphuric acid which are strong oxidizing agents and difficult to remove their traces from the wax and not clean and environmental friendly processes.<br>
Rice bran wax was de-gummed by precipitation from melt (at 100-120°C) or solution followed by ozonization at 12°C for 4 hr. to give de-gummed and bleached wax [Y. Yoshihiro et al., JP, 79,100,404 (1979)]. Crude rice bran wax was also oxidized with cone. HNO3 to a light yellow wax [Rao, B., et al., Indian Patent 119747 (1970)]. Ozonization and nitric acid treatments are also environmentally not clean processes.<br>
Thus the processes reported were not aimed at the complete removal of resinous matter from the crude rice bran wax obtained during the de-waxing stage of rice bran oil processing. Methodologies were needed for complete removal of the oil and the resinous matter present along with the wax esters. While de-oiling can be accomplished by a variety of organic solvents, a process for the complete removal of resinous matter does not exist. The aim of the present invention was to evolve such a process of removal of oil and the resinous matter present along with the wax ester.<br>
Objects of the Present Invention:<br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention the aqueous IPA can be re-used in the process by adjusting the required water content in the solvent.<br>
The broad applicability of the invention was examined by upgrading and bleaching the crude rice bran wax in aqueous IPA using sodium borohydride or sodium chlorite as bleaching agents.<br>
Preferably, the upgradation of crude rice bran wax is carried out using aqueous IPA with a water content ranging from 5 to 15% on the basis of wax.<br>
Preferably, there is employed 3 to 6 times volume of IPA based on the crude rice bran wax for upgradation.<br>
Preferably, there is employed a reaction time of 0.5 to 3 hours for upgradation of crude rice bran wax.<br><br>
Preferably the bleaching is carried out using sodium chlorite or sodium borohydride. Preferably 1 to 3 weight per cent of sodium chlorite or 0.5 to 3% of sodium borohydride based on the upgraded wax.<br>
Preferably sodium chlorite bleaching of upgraded wax is carried out in IP A containing 0.2 to 2% of water whereas sodium borohydride dissolved in equal weight of water and added to IPA.<br>
Preferably the sodium chlorite and sodium borohydride bleaching is carried out in 5 to 7 volumes of IPA based on the weight of upgraded wax.<br>
Preferably hydrogen peroxide (30% solution) bleaching is carried out by taking it 5 to 10 volume percent of the weight of the upgraded wax without organic solvent medium.<br>
The Gas Chromatographic (GC) composition of wax esters and physical and chemical properties of a typical bleached wax sample is given below.<br>
(Table Remove)The aim of the invention is to remove resinous matter from the crude rice bran wax by increasing the polarity of IPA by adding water to settle down the resinous matter from IPA solution followed by chemical bleaching. In the bleaching step oxidants like sodium chlorite and hydrogen peroxide and reducing agents like sodium borohydride were employed. The physical and chemical characteristics of the crude, upgraded and bleached waxes are given in Table 1. FDA specifications of rice bran wax are also given for comparison. The ranges of characteristics of upgraded and bleached waxes obtained in this invention are matching with the FDA specifications.<br>
Table 3: Physical and chemical characteristics of crude, upgraded and bleached rice bran wax(Table Remove)The Inventors have found that from a hot solution of the de-fatted wax in isopropanol, the resinous matter can be separated by the addition of a few volume percentage of water. The resinous matter would settle as a dark layer at the bottom, which can be easily separated. Thus, the undesirable material can be removed without any chemical treatment. A further advantage is that the resinous matter takes with it a good portion of the components that impart the dark color to the wax, so that removal of the resinous matter greatly improves the color of the wax.<br>
Bleaching steps are generally ineffective when the resinous matter is present and this.. explains why drastic reagents (chromium trioxide, sulphuric acid, nitric acid etc.,) and conditions described in prior art were necessary to achieve some color reduction.<br>
A large number of samples with varying oil content, obtained from commercial refining plants were processed by the present process. In initial trials, the Inventors used hexane as the de-fatting solvent. Although hexane is effective for oil removal, filtration rate for the resulting wax suspension was exceedingly slow. In later experiments the inventors have carried out de-fatting and removal of resinous matter using isopropanol (IPA) in presence of various volume percents of water. The<br>
Inventors have further discovered that both de-fatting and removal of resinous matter can be carried out in a single step provided the oil content of the crude wax low (less than 40%). In other cases, de-fatting and resinous matter removal was carried out in separate steps. After removal of the resinous matter, the product was ready for bleaching. It should be further noted that the earlier attempts at chemical bleaching were restricted to oxidative bleaching only. The inventors have found that reductive bleaching by using sodium borohydride was very effective. High cost of the reagent could be a negative factor. Hence the use of cheaper reagents was sought. Both sodium chlorite and hydrogen peroxide were found to be satisfactory. Sodium chlorite bleaching was carried out in isopropanol medium while hydrogen peroxide bleaching was carried out on the molten wax without any solvent medium.<br>
The resinous matter starts separating out from IPA soluble wax solution as a solid gummy material when IPA contains water. Then the resinous matter can be separated out from the wax solution very easily in hot condition.   Removal of this resinous^ matter from crude rice bran wax enhances the bleaching efficiency and improves the quality of bleached wax.<br>
Eventhough sodium chlorite was reported for the bleaching of rice bran wax it was used in combination with a number of other bleaching agents [Ishii Masakatsu, JP: 76,30,204 (1976)]. In the present study sodium chlorite alone could exhibit efficient bleaching capability when the bleaching was carried out in IPA medium in presence of various amounts of water.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Crude rice bran wax (500 grams) was taken in a 5 lit round bottomed flask along with IPA (1.5 liters) and heated on an isomantle to make uniform solution. The contents were further refluxed for 0.5 hrs. and allowed to settle for 3 minutes at 75°C. Resinous matter started settling down in the flask during this period. The clear IPA soluble portion was decanted into a beaker and the settled resinous matter in the flask was treated with fresh IPA (2 x 100 ml) ur ' - -eflux conditions. The pooled IPA soluble portion which contains upgraded oil was cooled to around 30°C. The crystallized upgraded wax was filtered using Buchner funnel and washed the wax<br>
with about 500 ml of IPA. The residual IPA present in wet upgraded wax was removed by vacuum distillation to obtain dried upgraded wax (302.5 g). The IPA soluble portion was concentrated using a rotary evaporator to recover the oil along with soft wax (184.5 g). The yield of the resinous matter obtained was 12.4 g. The color (Gardner scale in 1.0 cm cell) and melting point of the upgraded wax were found to be 18+ and 78 - 79°C respectively.<br>

The contents were further refluxed for 0.5 hours and allowed to settle for 3 minutes at 75°C. Resinous matter started settling down in the flask during this period. The clear IPA soluble portion was decanted into a beaker and the settled resinous matter in the flask was treated with fresh IPA (2 x 100 ml) under reflux conditions. The pooled IPA soluble portion which contains upgraded wax and oil was cooled to around 30°C. The crystallized upgraded wax was filtered using Buchner runnel and washed the wax with about 500 ml of IPA. The residual IPA present in wet upgraded wax was removed by vacuum distillation to obtain dried upgraded wax (302.5 g). The IPA soluble portion was concentrated using a rotary evaporator to recover the oil along with soft wax (185.3 g). The yield of the resinous matter obtained was 12.2 g. The color (Gardner scale in 1.0 cm cell) and melting point of the upgraded wax were found to be 18+ and 78 - 79°C respectively.<br>
Example 3:<br>

The contents were further refluxed for 0.5 hours and allowed to settle for 3 minutes at 75°C. Resinous matter started settling down in the flask during this period. The clear IPA soluble portion was decanted into a beaker and the settled resinous matter in the flask was treated with fresh IPA (2 x 100 ml) under reflux conditions. The pooled IPA soluble portion which contains upgraded wax and oil was cooled to around 33°C.

The filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator to recover the residual oil (9.5 g), with small amount of soft wax. The yield of the resinous matter was 6.7 g. The color (Gardner scale in 1.0 cm cell) and melting point of the bleached wax were found to be 13 and 79 - 80°C respectively.<br>
Example 29:<br>
Upgraded wax (250 grams) was taken in a 3 liter round bottomed flask along with IPA (1.75 lit.) and heated on an isomantle to make uniform solution. When the reflux siirted, sodium borohydride (5 grams in 10 ml water) was added and the ref! •, was continued for another 2 hrs. After completion of the reaction time the contents were<br><br>
allowed to settle for 4 minutes at hot temperature. Residual resinous matter was started settling down in the flask during this period. The clear IPA soluble portion was decanted into a beaker and the resinous matter was treated with fresh IPA (2 x 50 ml) under hot conditions. The pooled IPA soluble portion was cooled to around 30°C. The crystallized bleached wax was filtered using Buchner funnel and washed the wax with IPA (2 x 125 ml). The residual IPA present in wet bleached wax was removed by vacuum distillation to obtain dried bleached wax (234.3 g). The filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator to recover the residual oil (12.4 g), with small amount of soft wax. The yield of the resinous matter was 7.7 g. The color (Gardner scale in 1.0 cm cell) and melting point of the bleached wax were found to be 13 and 79 - 80°C respectively.<br>
Example 30:<br>
Crude rice bran wax (500 grams) was taken in a 5 lit round bottomed flask along with IPA (2.5 liters) and water (50 ml) and heated on an isomantle to make uniform solution. The contents were further refluxed for 0.5 hours and allowed to settle for 4 minutes at 76°C temperature. Resinous matter started settling down in the flask during this period. The clear IPA soluble portion was decanted into a beaker and the settled resinous matter in the flask was treated with fresh IPA (2 x 100 ml) under reflux conditions. The pooled IPA soluble portion which contains upgraded wax and oil was cooled to around 30°C. The crystallized upgraded wax was filtered using Buchner funnel and washed the wax with about 500 ml of IPA. The IPA soluble portion was concentrated using a rotary evaporator to recover the oil along with soft wax (174.8 g). The yield of the resinous matter obtained was 34.1 g. The residual IPA present in wet upgraded wax was removed by vacuum distillation. When the molten wax was free of solvent and moisture, 25 ml of hydrogen peroxide (30% solution) was added and stirred the contents for 2 hours. The moisture and hydrogen peroxide were distilled out under vacuum and obtained 291.1 g of bleached wax. The color (Gardner scale in 1.0 cm cell) and melting point of the bleached wax were found to be 14.3 and 79 - 80°C respectively.<br>
Example 31:<br>
