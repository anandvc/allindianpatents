				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RUST PREVENTIVE PIGMENT-CONTAINING POLYFUNCTIONAL EPOXY RESIN PAINT COMPOSITION, COATING FILM OF THE COMPOSITION, SUBSTRATE COATED WITH THE COATING FILM AND METHOD FOR PREVENTING CORROSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a rust preventive pigment-containing epoxy resin (corrosion resistant) paint composition, a coating film prepared from the paint composition, a substrate coated with the coating film and a method for preventing corrosion using the paint composition.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to a rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition which can be used in the field that corrosion resistance is required, for example, coating for steel constructions including ships, bridges and plants or in the field that not only corrosion resistance but also high adhesion strength at very low temperatures are required. Particularly, the invention relates to a rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition which can form, when applied on the LNG tank inner wall surface (inner hull of a ship) of an LNG carrier, a coating film having excellent corrosion resistance and also excellent adhesion properties<br><br>
against both of a hull and a mastic (a resin rope i.e. a resin material for regulating the spaces between a heat shielding box and an inner hull wall) which is interposed into between a ship body (inner hull) and a heat shielding layer formed on the inner peripheral surface of the hull even at very low temperatures of about -25°C. Further, the present invention relates to a coating film having the above properties which is obtainable from the paint composition, a substrate coated with the coating film, a laminated structure having the coating film (layer) and a method for preventing corrosion using the paint composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART In the field that corrosion resistance is required, for example, steel constructions including ships, bridges, plants or the like, it is general to apply a primary rust preventive primer (inorganic zinc shop primer or organic zinc primer) on them. The general primary rust preventive primer, however, cannot attain sufficiently high adhesion strength by bonding a hull and a heat shielding layer in an LNG carrier. As the primary anticorrosive primer having the property (high adhesion strength), there is a primary anticorrosive primer containing zinc chromate. The zinc chromate, however, is harmful for the human body and has a problem in environmental contamination (disclosed   in,   for   example,   Patent   Document   1:<br><br>
JP-A-H10(1998)-219138, Patent Document 2 : JP-A-H8(1996)-57417, Patent Document 3: JP-A-H7 (1995.)-171497 ) .<br>
A primary rust preventive primer (coating film) having high adhesion strength is formed by subjecting a steel material to primary surface treatment with shot blasting in a shot line and thereafter applying an inorganic zinc shop primer. After steel materials prepared through the primary rust preventive treatment are made into blocks by assembling with welding, the blocks are mostly allowed to stand outside in an exposed condition for a long period of time. Furthermore, they are assembled into an LNG carrier or the like and then they are coated outside after removal of rust generated during the exposure and the film prepared by the primary rust preventive treatment in a secondary surface treatment.<br>
When the inorganic zinc shop primer (primary rust preventive coating film) is not removed sufficiently with the secondary surface treatment, sufficiently high adhesion strength cannot be obtained even if the primary rust preventive primer capable of giving high adhesion strength is applied on the surface thereof. Particularly, in an inside position of an LNG tank which position is exposed at low temperatures of -25°C, sufficiently high adhesion strength cannot be obtained because the adhesion strength therein lowers extremely.<br>
In the field that corrosion resistance is required, such<br><br>
as steel constructions including ships, bridges, plants or the like, an epoxy resin anticorrosive paint may be applied other than the inorganic zinc shop primer. The epoxy resin anticorrosive paint, however, is not suitable for application in a shot line because the drying and curing of a coating film need many hours.<br>
(1) JP-A-H9(1997)-206675 (Patent Document 4) discloses a method for preventing the rust surface from corrosion. In the method, a primary rust preventive paint having a regulated paint viscosity of from 15 sec to 25 sec / Ford cup #4 is applied on a rust steel surface in an amount such that the dry film thickness is from 15 fjm to 30 Jim. Furthermore, it discloses that an example of the primary rust preventive paint is an epoxy zinc primer containing an epoxy resin, a curing agent such as an aliphatic polyamine, and zinc powder, and the epoxy zinc primer may contain additives for paints, for example, an adhesion-imparting agent such as silicate resin etc and a dehydrating agent (moisture adsorbent).<br>
The paint disclosed in Patent Document 4, however, is not designed to use at very low temperatures of -25°C or lower. The patent document 4, further, does not disclose the functional group number and molecular weight of the epoxy resin used, nor an epoxy resin (anticorrosive) composition blended with a dehydrating agent and a silane coupling agent.  Particularly,<br><br>
it does not disclose whether the inner wall surface of an LNG carrier and a mastic (resin rope) which will be exposed at very-low temperatures (-25°C or lower) can be bonded with high adhesion strength or not. The use of the epoxy resin disclosed in the patent document 4 has a problem in that the resulting paint is not suitable for coating in a shot line because of having a low curing rate.<br>
(2) JP-A-2000-239570 (Patent Document 5) discloses an anticorrosive paint composition, which is applied on the frictional joint parts of large-scale steel constructions such as brides or plants. The composition comprises (A) an epoxy resin, (B) an amine curing agent, (C) a silane coupling agent and (D) zinc powder having a particle diameter of from 10 um to 50 \xm, and which contains the silane coupling agent in an amount of from 0.5 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin solid content in the paint, and the zinc powder (D) in an amount of from 50 % to 95 % by weight in the paint solid content. It also discloses that, as the component (A), a bisphenol A type polyfunctional epoxy resin having a functional number of 2.<br>
The patent document 5, furthermore, discloses that the use of the anticorrosive paint can form a coating film having high adhesion with steel materials and the application thereof on frictional joint parts in large-scale steel constructions<br><br>
such as bridges or plants can improve frictional resistance in the joint parts.<br>
The patent document 5 does not disclose any plans to use the anticorrosive paint at very low temperatures nor any dehydrating agents and therefore, it does not disclose whether, an inner wall surfaces and a mastic of an LNG carrier which will be exposed at very low temperatures can be bonded with high adhesion strength, or not.<br>
(3) JP-A-2002-86066 (Patent document 6) discloses a method for forming a coating film by applying a coating paint for mist coatless coating on the surface coated with an inorganic zinc rich paint wherein the coating paint comprises (A) an epoxy resin, (B) an amine curing agent and (C) zinc powder excluding scaly or leaf-like zinc and has a volume concentration of the whole pigments including the zinc powder (C) of from 20 % to 70%. It also discloses that the coating paint is applied on a tank or the like as a heavy-duty anticorrosive coating paint and comprises a silicon inorganic binder as essential components, and further a dehydrating agent such as methyl orthoformate, ethyl orthoformate or dimethoxypropane. It, further, discloses, as the epoxy resin (A) , a resin in a liquid or solid state at ordinary temperatures having two or more epoxy groups, preferably about 2 from to 5 epoxy groups in one molecule. It, furthermore, discloses that use can be made of tetraalkoxy<br><br>
silicate, alkyltrialkoxy silicate, dialkyldialkoxy silicate and their partial condensates and/or hydrolysis initial condensates obtainable by condensation reaction of them in the presence of water and an acid catalyst.<br>
The patent document 6, however, has a limitation that the anticorrosive coating paint can be applied on only the surface coated with the inorganic zinc rich paint and has no plan to use it at very low temperatures.  Therefore, it does not disclose whether the paint can bond inner wall surface and a mastic of an LNG carrier which will be exposed at very low temperatures, with high bonding strength, or not.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURE<br>
FIG. 1 shows a shape and a dimension of a test piece used in a shear tensile test according to the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a shape and a dimension of a test piece used in a vertical tensile test according to the invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy paint composition, the coating film formed from the composition, the substrate coated with the coating film and the<br><br>
process for corrosion prevention according to the invention will be described in detail below.<br>
Rust Preventive Pigment-Containing Polyfunctional Epoxy Resin Paint Composition<br>
The anticorrosive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition according to the invention (simply referred to paint or paint composition) comprises the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) , the modified aliphatic polyamine (B) , the anticorrosive pigment (C) , the silane coupling agent (D) and the moisture absorbent (E).<br>
The components from (A) to (E) contained in the paint each are described below successively.<br>
(A) Polyfunctional epoxy resin<br>
The polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) in the invention has a theoretical value of the number of epoxy groups, determined with dividing the number average molecular weight Mn (measurement condition: measured in GPC, value relative to polystyrene, referred to hereinafter) by epoxy equivalent, of 1 or more. The polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) used in the first embodiment of the invention has a theoretical value determined with dividing the number average molecular weight by epoxy equivalent of preferably from 5 to 12, more preferably from 6<br><br>
to 9, most preferably about 7. When the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy paint composition contains the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) having epoxy groups in the above amount, a coating film satisfying the required high adhesion strength can be formed. Therefore, the composition has excellent drying properties in shot line coating. It is general to increase the amount of a resin to a pigment in order to increase the strength of a coating film. Consequently, the barrier effect of the coating film lowers and thereby the corrosion resistance also lowers. However, the polyfunctional epoxy resin of the paint according to the invention has a high molecular weight, and therefore the barrier effect of a coating film does not lower and also the corrosion resistance does not lower.<br>
The polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) can be prepared by, for example, a process for carrying out polymer reaction such that a bisphenol A type epoxy resin (a), which is a base, is modified with resol having a phenol skeleton and a methylol group, and the methylol and hydroxyl groups, phenolic hydroxyl groups and epoxy rings in the epoxy resin (a) are condensed.<br>
In the first embodiment of the invention, the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) preferably has an Mn of at least 5000 and an epoxy equivalent.of at least 700 taking high adhesion strength of a resulting coating film (layer) and a mating part<br><br>
 (examples: inner wall surface of LNG tank or mastic) , corrosion resistance and curing properties in forming a coating film into consideration. Furthermore, it preferably has an Mn of from 5500 to 9000 and an epoxy equivalent of from 750 to 1000 taking exhibiting drying properties and high adhesion strength into consideration.<br>
In the second embodiment of the invention, the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) used herein has a number of epoxy group of at least 1 and less than 5. In the invention, the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) even having a number of epoxy group of at least 1 and less than 5 is preferably used for outdoor coating (block coating) after secondary surface treatment by the combined use of the resin (A) and the above components from<br>
(B) to (E) although the drying properties in a shot line are inferior depending to conditions such as a case where a proper drying time cannot be kept since the length of a shot line is short or a case where forced drying equipment (for preheating or after heating) is not prepared in the cold latitudes.<br>
In the second embodiment, the polyfunctional epoxy resin<br>
(A) preferably has an Mn of from 700 to 4000 and an epoxy equivalent of from 300 to 3500. It, furthermore, preferably has a theoretical value of epoxy group of at least 1 and not more than 3, an Mn of from 800 to 3000 and an epoxy equivalent of from 400 to 2500 taking into account consideration that a<br><br>
resulting coating film has sufficiently high adhesion strength with a matter to be coated and excellent corrosion resistance, and curing properties after coating. When the Mn and epoxy equivalent are lower than the above ranges, there is a tendency for a coating film not to have sufficiently high adhesion strength and excellent corrosion resistance and further not to have rapid curing properties.<br>
In the invention, the paint containing the epoxy resin having a value of epoxy group of from 5 to 12 prepared in the first embodiment has excellent coating properties in a shot line and a resulting rust preventive paint and a resulting coating film have drying properties, high adhesion strength and corrosion resistance.<br>
Particularly, the paint containing the epoxy resin having a value of epoxy group of at least 1 and not more than 5 described in the second embodiment is suitably used for outdoor (block) coating, and a resulting rust preventive paint and its coating film have high adhesion strength and corrosion resistance.<br>
Even if any one of the epoxy resins prepared in the first and second embodiments is used as the component (A) in the invention, it is thought that the combined use of the epoxy resin and the component (B), i.e. the modified aliphatic polyamine (B) greatly influences the high adhesion strength of a resulting coating film as determined in a tensile test by GAZTRANSPORT<br><br>
&amp; TECHNIGAZ SAs in France.<br>
In any one of the first and second embodiments, the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) is contained in an amount of usually from 5 wt% to 50 wt%, preferably from 10 wt% to 40 wt%, specially from 10 wt% to 30 wt% based on 100 wt% of the total amount of the solid content contained in the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition (also called to paint, which contains a solvent, referred to hereinafter) in regard to drying properties, high adhesion strength and corrosion resistance.<br>
The component (A) is generally reacted with the following modified aliphatic polyamine (B) in a curing coating film. The constituents derived from the component (A) are contained in an amount of usually from 5 wt% to 50 wt%, preferably from 10 wt% to 40 wt% in the coating film (dried coating film) prepared by drying the paint provided that the amount is determined from the weight of the solid content (non-volatile components) in the paint, i.e. the components excluding a solvent for the above reasons.<br>
(B) Modified aliphatic polyamine<br>
Conventionally known epoxy resin curing agents can be used as the modified aliphatic polyamine (B) and are described in, for example, paragraph [0023] in JP-A-2002-86066 (KANSAI<br><br>
PAINT), paragraph [0053] in JP-A-2003-171611 or paragraphs [0121] to [0127] in JP-A-2005-15572. Specific examples are aliphatic polyamines (Bl) such as ethylene diamine, propylene diamine, butylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine or pentaethylene hexamine; amine adducts (B2) obtainable by reacting the above aliphatic polyamine with an epoxy compound (containing epoxy resin) having at least one epoxy group; Michael adduct polyamines (B3) obtainable by addition reaction of the above aliphatic polyamine and an unsaturated compound; Mannich adduct polyamines (B4) obtainable by condensation reaction of the aliphatic polyamine, formalin (formaldehyde) and a phenol; and cyanoethyl compounds (B5) obtainable by reaction of the aliphatic polyamine and acrylonitrile. They are favorably used for the reasons that the curing properties of a coating film are high and effective for adhesion strength and drying properties. The aliphatic polyamines may be used singly or in combination by a method of mixing two or more those. Of these aliphatic polyamines, the amine adducts (B2) obtainable by addition reaction of a bisphenol A solid epoxy resin (for example, Epikote#1001 type) to ethylene diamine or an ethylene diamine-containing compound (for example, ethylene diamine content of about from 90 % to 99 %) , and diluting them with a solvent (for example, xylene, N-butanol or combinations<br><br>
thereof) are particularly preferred in the above effects, and further those having an active hydrogen equivalent (typical value) of from 100 to 600 are preferred.<br>
Commercially available amine adducts are, for example, "LUCKAMIDE TD961" (modified aliphatic polyamine corresponding to the adducts (B2), the active hydrogen equivalent (typical value):356), "LUCKAMIDE WH-137" and "LUCKAMIDE WH-630" which are produced by DAINIPPON INK AND CHEMICALS,INCORPORATED, "ADEKA HARDENER EH-210" and "ADEKA HARDENER EH-220" which are produced by ADEKA Corporation, "FUJICURE-5410", "FUJICURE-5420" and "FUJICURE FXE-1000" which are produced by FUJI KASEI KOGYO Co., Ltd, "ACI HARDENER (R)K-39" which is produced by PTI JAPAN Co . (IBPTR JAPAN Co. ) , and Mannich modified aliphatic polyamine "SUNMIDE (R)CX-1154" which is produced by SANWA CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CO.,LTD.<br>
The modified aliphatic polyamines (B) is contained in an<br>
amount of usually from 5 wt% to 40 wt%, preferably from 5 wt%<br>
to 30 wt%, especially from 10 wt% to 30 wt% in the total amount<br>
(100 wt%) of non-volatile components (solid content) in the<br>
paint (containing a solvent, referred to hereinafter).<br>
The modified aliphatic polyamine (B) , further, is desirably contained in an amount of usually from 15 to 100 parts by weight, preferably from 20 to 95 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the solid content of the polyfunctional<br><br>
epoxy resin (A) in the drying properties and high adhesion strength. The modified aliphatic polyamine (B) is usually present in a dried and cured coating film as a reactant with epoxy resins such as the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A).<br>
(C) Rust preventive pigment<br>
The rust preventive pigments (C) has an average particle diameter of preferably not more than 20 µm, more preferably not more than 15 µm, especially about 10 µm. When the rust preventive pigment has an average particle diameter of more than 20 \xm, the dispersibility of these components to a resulting paint composition is inferior to cause generation of coating non-uniformity. As a result, the denseness and rust prevention properties of a coating film are apt to be inferior. Zinc alloys, which are rust preventive pigments other than zinc powder, are conventionally known alloys such as zinc-aluminum and zinc-magnesium. Examples thereof are zinc phosphate-aluminum compounds "LF BOWSEI CP-Z" available by KIKUCHI COLOR &amp; CHEMICALS CORPORATION, zinc phosphite-calcium compounds "PROTEX YM-60" available by TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL Co. , Ltd, zinc phosphite-strontium compounds "PROTEX YM-92NS" available by TAIHEI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIAL Co., Ltd,<br>
tripolyphosphate-aluminum compounds "K-WHITE #84" available by TAYCA CORPORATION, molybdate compounds "LF BOWSEI M-PSN"<br><br>
available by KIKUCHI COLOR &amp; CHEMICALS CORPORATION and zinc cyanamide compounds "LF BOWSEI ZK-32" available by KIKUCHI COLOR &amp; CHEMICALS CORPORATION .<br>
These anticorrosive pigments (C) are used in an amount of usually from 15 wt% to 70 wt%, preferably from 20 wt% to 60 wt%, specifically from 20 wt% to 40 wt% based on 100 wt% of the total of the solid content in the paint from the viewpoints of the corrosion resistance.<br>
These rust preventive pigments are desirably contained in an amount of usually from 15 wt% to 70 wt%, preferably from 20 wt% to 60 wt% in the dried coating film prepared by drying the paint on the reason same as above.<br>
(D) Silane coupling agent<br>
Examples of the silane coupling agent (D) are compounds having, in their molecule, a reactive group which contributes chemical reaction with organic materials and from 1 to 3 alkoxysilyl groups as a reactive group which contributes chemical bonding with inorganic materials. Examples of the reactive group, which contributes chemical bonding with organic materials, are epoxy, amino, mercapto, unsaturated, cation and halogen groups.<br>
Conventionally known silane coupling agents are used as the silane coupling agent (D) .  Examples thereof are those<br><br>
described in JP-A-H8(1996)-127734 filed by the present<br>
inventors and specific examples are those having affinity<br>
(application properties) with epoxy resins such as<br>
β- (3, 4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyltrimethoxy	silane,<br>
γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy	silane,<br>
γ-glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxy	silane,<br>
N-β (aminoethyl) γ-aminopropyltrimethoxy	silane,<br>
N-β (aminoethyl )γ-aminopropylmethyldimethoxy	silane,<br>

γ-chloropropyltrimethoxy silane. These silane coupling agents may be used singly or combined to use.<br>
These silane coupling agents (D) are contained in an amount of usually from 0.1 wt% to 3 wt%, preferably from 1 wt% to 3 wt% specifically from 1 wt% to 2 wt% based on 100 wt% of the total of the solid content in the paint containing a solvent from the viewpoints of adhesion with steel plate bases and adhesion with mastics.<br>
The silane coupling agents (D) are contained in an amount of usually from 0.1 wt% to 3 wt%, preferably from 1 wt% to 3 wt%, specifically from 1 wt% to 2 wt% in the dried coating film prepared by drying the paint from the reason same as above.<br>
(E) Moisture absorbent<br><br>
Conventionally known moisture absorbents can be used as the moisture absorbent (E) . For example, it is possible to use organic or inorganic dehydrating agents as described in paragraphs [0093] to [0095] in JP-A-2002-97407 filed by the present inventors. Furthermore, it is preferred to use inorganic dehydrating agents (also referred to inorganic dehydrating agents or inorganic moisture absorbents) in regard to storage stability of the paint, specifically prevention of hydrogen gas generation caused by reaction between moisture and zinc powder in the paint. As described above, the use of the paints blended with the dehydrating agent, particularly the inorganic dehydrating agent can improve storage stability.<br>
Examples of the moisture absorbents (dehydrating agents) are anhydrite (CaS04) , synthetic zeolite absorbents (Trade Name: Molecular sieve and the like) , ortho-esters such as methyl orthoformate, methyl orthoacetate, ethyl orthoformate or orthoborate; silicates; isocyanates (Trade Name: Additive Tl) ; tetraethoxy silane (Trade Name: Ethyl Silicate 28, manufactured by COLCOAT CO., LTD) and hydrolysis initial condensates of tetraethyl silicates (Trade Name: Ethyl Silicate 40, manufactured by COLCOAT CO., LTD, represented by the formula (C2H50)3Si-{0-Si (-OC2H5)2}n-OC2H5, wherein n (average) =5 . Particularly, it is preferred to use synthetic zeolite (molecular sieve)  as the component  (E) .   These moisture<br><br>
absorbents may be used singly or in combination. For example, ethyl orthoformate and synthetic zeolite may be used in combination.<br>
The moisture absorbent (E), particularly an inorganic moisture absorbent (an inorganic dehydrating agent) is contained in an amount of usually from 0.1 wt% to 3 wt%, preferably from 0.5 wt% to 2 wt% based on 100 wt% of the total of the solid content contained in the above paint (including a solvent).<br>
Furthermore, the moisture absorbent (E) is in an amount of usually from 0.1 wt% to 3 wt%, preferably from 0.3 wt% to 2 wt% in a dried coating film.<br>
When the paint or the dried coating film each contains the moisture absorbent (particularly an inorganic dehydrating agent) in the above amounts, the paint storage stability is improved.<br>
Other components<br>
- Pigments<br>
In addition to the essential components, the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition (the paint) may optionally contain pigments, solvents and other additives such as dispersing agents, thickners,  anti-sagging agents,  anti-settling agents and<br><br>
anti-segregating agents in regard to paint properties, working properties for coating and coating film appearance properties such as hue.<br>
The pigments used herein are not limited particularly, and it is possible to use those widely used in usual paint compositions.<br>
Examples of the pigments are extender pigments such as calcium carbonate, clay, talc, silica, mica, precipitated barium, potassium feldspar, albite, zirconium silicate and zinc oxide; and coloring pigments such as titanium oxide, red iron oxide, iron oxide, carbon black, phthalocyanine green and phthalocyanine blue. The pigments may be used singly or in combination.<br>
The pigments are contained in an amount of usually from 1 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 3 wt% to 6 wt% in the dried coating film formed by the paint. When the amount of the pigments in the dried coating film is over 10 wt%, the rust prevention properties are likely lowered because the proportion of zinc in the coating film is decreased.<br>
- Solvents<br>
The solvents are not particularly limited and can be selected from those capable of solving the epoxy resin (A) . For example, the solvents can be appropriately selected in accordance with various conditions such as working properties<br><br>
for coating in a shot line, working properties for coating after primary rust preventive treated steel materials are assembled to make into a block with welding.<br>
Examples of the solvents are alcohol solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and butanol; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and xylene; ketone solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone; and ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate. The solvents can be used singly or in combination in accordance with weather conditions at the time of coating.<br>
The amount of the solvents in the paint composition is not particularly limited and the solvents are used in an appropriate amount in accordance with various purposes such as working properties for coating in a shot line, working properties for coating after making the materials into a block.<br>
- Other additives<br>
The other additives are not particularly limited and it is possible to use paint additives usually used such as dispersing agents, thickners, anti-sagging agents, anti-settling agents or anti-segregating agents.<br>
Non-limitative examples of the anti-settling agents are polyethylene wax type thixotropic agents such as "DISPARLON 4200-20X" manufactured by KUSUMOTO CHEMICALS, Ltd., and the like.<br><br>
Process for Preparation of the Paint<br>
As the process for preparation of the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition (the paint) according to the present invention, conventionally processes for applying anticorrosive paints can be utilized as they are or they are appropriately combined to use without employing a special process.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, for example, the main component containing the polyfunctional epoxy resin<br>
(A) and the curing agent component containing the modified aliphatic polyamine (B) as a curing agent, are separately prepared and put in separate vessels for storage or keeping. Just before coating, the main component and the curing agent component are mixed and used as the paint of the present invention.<br>
The main component is prepared in the following process. For example, the resin vehicle component, i.e. an epoxy resin varnish obtainable by dissolving the polyfunctional epoxy resin<br>
(A) and optionally other epoxy resins in a solvent is mixed with the above components including the silane coupling agent (D), the moisture absorbent (E) , the pigments and the additives, to prepare a mixture and the solvent is appropriately added to the mixture.  The mixture is dispersed using a dispersing machine<br><br>
such as basket mill or SG mill. Thereafter, the rust preventive pigment (C) is added to the mixture and dispersed by a dispersing machine, such as high-speed disperser.<br>
In the preparation of the epoxy resin vanish obtainable by dissolving the epoxy resin (A) and optionally the other epoxy resins in a solvent, it is possible to employ a process for blending and dissolving the resin vehicle components in the solvent while stirring the components with a dispersing machine such as high-speed disperser.<br>
An example of the curing agent component may include a solution (aliphatic polyamine solution) obtainable by dissolving the modified aliphatic polyamine (B) in a solvent. It is unnecessary to employ a special process as the process for preparing the curing agent component. It is possible to employ a usual process for preparing anticorrosive paints or a usual using process for the aliphatic polyamine solution to be blended.<br>
In the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition (the paint) according to the present invention, the pigment has a dispersing degree determined by a distribution method of preferably from 5 (jm to 50 µm.<br>
The viscosity of the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition is regulated using<br><br>
a solvent in accordance with the coating processes. In the coating application using an airless coating machine, it is suitable to regulate the coating solution viscosity with Ford cup #4 for from 10 sec to 20 sec. The main component only has a viscosity namely a KU value determined by a Stormer viscometer of preferably from 49 to 109, more preferably from 57 to 88.<br>
Coating Process<br>
The process for coating a substrate with the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition is not particularly limited and, for example, the paint composition can be applied on a substrate using an airless coating machine, an air spray coating machine or coating tools such as brushes or rollers by a conventionally known coating process.<br>
The film coated with the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition preferably has a dried thickness of at least 10 urn. When the dried thickness is less than 10 |im, the rust prevention properties are sometimes insufficient.<br>
When the dried thickness is too thick, the consumption of the paint is increased uneconomically. Furthermore, the dryness of the film is inferior disadvantageously. The dried film more preferably has a thickness of about from 15 urn to 35<br><br>
µm.<br>
In the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition (the paint) of the invention, the modified aliphatic polyamine (B) functions as a curing agent for the polyfunctional epoxy resin (A) and the other epoxy resins optionally added. Therefore, after the paint is applied, it can be cured at ordinary temperatures. Furthermore, the curing may be advanced by previously heating a substrate before coating or by heating a substrate after coating.<br>
In the case of coating the both surfaces of a substrate with the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition, particularly in a shot line, by the above coating process, it is preferred to load a coated substrate in the following way taking into account the case that curing properties of a coating film formed on the substrate are insufficient.<br>
When the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint is applied on the both surfaces of a substrate, it is preferred to load substrates by inserting boards (squared timbers) coated with a polyethylene sheet between the substrates. The coated substrates between which the boards are inserted are allowed to stand over one day and night. Thereafter, the substrates with the boards, as they are, are lifted by a lifting magnet, which is an apparatus for<br><br>
adsorbing, carrying and loading a steel thing with magnetism, and loaded to another place. Resultingly, the loading can be carried out without adhesion of the coated substrates.<br>
When a reinforcing material is fixed on the surface of a substrate with welding, an inorganic zinc shop primer is coated on the substrate surface on which the reinforcing material is fixed with welding (usually, the upper surface of a substrate in coating a substrate in a shot line) and thereby adhesion between the coated substrates can be prevented without inserting polyethylene sheet-covered boards (squared timbers) between the coated substrates. As a result, the coated substrates can be directly loaded (piled up).<br>
When the substrates coated in the above coating process have wrong conditions such as occurrence of rust in their coating films caused by exposure outdoors for a long period of time, cutting processing, welding processing or mechanical damage, their coating films are slightly secondary surface preparation with a power tool and the substrates are coated with the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint using an airless coating machine, an air spray coating machine or coating tools such as brushes or rollers.<br>
After the secondary surface preparation, the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin composition(the paint) of the present invention, is applied to<br><br>
form a rust preventive pigment-containing coating film on the surface of the substrate. As a result, even if a mastic (resin rope) , which bonds between a hull body and a heat shielding layer, is bonded, it is possible to attai-n high adhesion strength as the case where a mastic is adhered on a substrate coated with the paint of the present invention in a shot line. Moreover, a usual organic resin type anticorrosive paint can be applied on the coating film of the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin composition.<br>
The rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition of the invention can prepare coating films having anticorrosive properties, good adhesion with a mastic (resin rope) bonding a hull body and a heat shielding layer and high adhesion strength in the field in need of having anticorrosion properties, such as ships, bridges, plants or other steel constructions, particularly in the field in need of having high adhesion strength such as bonding a hull body and a heat shielding layer of an LNG carrier. The present invention, further, provides a coating process using the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition, coated products obtainable by the coating process and a process for loading the coated products.<br>
The above-described high adhesion strength is officially identified by GAZTRANSPORT &amp; TECHNIGAS SAs in France.<br><br>
The identification test items relating to high adhesion strength, which are tested in this institution, are the following from (1) to (4) .<br>
(1)	Shearing tensile test using a specimen having a shape as shown in FIG. 1 at atmospheric temperatures of +20°C and -25/C.<br>
(2)	Vertical tensile test using a specimen having a shape as shown in FIG. 2 at atmospheric temperatures of +20°C and -25°C.<br>
(3)	Shearing tensile test at atmospheric temperatures of +20'C and -25°C using specimens having been immersed in a 3% salt water for 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks in the same test method as the test (1).<br>
(4)	Vertical tensile test at atmospheric temperatures of +20°C and -25°C using specimens having been immersed in a 3% salt water for 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks in the same test method as the test (2).<br>
The specimens under test were subjected to these tests from (1) to (4). As a result, specimens having high adhesion strength are required to have an adhesion strength in the shear tensile test of not less than 12 MPa, an adhesion strength in the vertical tensile test of not less than 10 MPa and an adhesion strength in each of the tensile tests after immersing in a 3% salt water for 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks of at least 80% as<br><br>
high as the initial value thereof.<br>
The use of the rust preventive pigment-containing polyfunctional epoxy resin paint composition according to the present invention can satisfy the high adhesion strength defined by the institute described above. Therefore, when the coating film formed from the paint composition is formed between a hull body, which is a substrate for coating, and a mastic (resin rope) and bonded, the hull body and the mastic can be firmly bonded.<br>

AA:  Good without any problems<br>
BB: Good without practical problems<br>
CC: there were somewhat problems<br>
DD: there were practical problems<br>
On the upper surface of a steel plate, an inorganic zinc shop primer (CERABOND 2000, manufactured by CHUGOKU MARINE PAINTS Ltd.) was applied.<br><br>
As is clear from the test results as shown in TABLE 2 (various corrosion resistances determined by weathering evaluation test, water exposure weathering test, test for exposure resistance to salt water, moisture resistant test and test for resistance to immersion in salt water, and retention of adhesion strength evaluated by the tensile tests on the test plates after immersing in the salt water), coating films having excellent corrosion resistance and adhesion strength can be prepared using the paint compositions satisfying various conditions defined in the present invention.<br>
The results, further, show that if the epoxy equivalent, number average molecular weight and number (theoretical value) of epoxy groups of the epoxy resin in the main component are in the ranges defined in the first and second embodiments of the present invention, coating films having good drying properties and adhesion strength can be obtained using the modified aliphatic polyamine as a curing agent.<br><recoating properties of coating film><br>
Each of the paints prepared in Examples and Comparative Examples was applied on a steel plate for construction (JIS G3101) (SS400, 150mm x 70mm x 6mm) processed with sand blast in an amount that the dry film thickness was 30 µm, and dried inside at a constant temperature of 23 "C and a constant relative humidity of 50 % for 7 days.  Thereafter, the steel plate was<br><br>
set in an exposure test stand put toward the south with inclination angle 45°C provided outside in Otake Technical Center, CHUGOKU MARINE PAINTS Ltd., and allowed to stand for 12 months. After the exposure, each steel plate was re-coated with the same paint prepared in Examples and Comparative Examples respectively, and then was evaluated on adhesion properties by the cross cut method and the pull off method. EXAMPLES from 1 to 8 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES from 1 to 8 were studied by comparison. As is clear from TABLE 4, when the surface of the dried coating film coated with the paint for forming the coating film was recoated with the same paint to form a coating film, the resulting coating film had good adhesion properties almost same as the initial adhesion properties although the adhesion strength of the coating film was found to have dispersion and little degradation.<br>
