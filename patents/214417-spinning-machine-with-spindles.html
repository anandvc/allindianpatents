				<td>The present invention concerns a spinning machine with spindles with an individual motor drive.<br>
In the German patent application DE 41 42 707 a spindle of the type concerned driven by an individual motor is described, in which a conventional arrangement, frequently applied in the lay-out of electric motors, comprises a stator, a rotor placed inside and two bearing plates arranged to both sides of the rotor, and of the stator respectively, which bearing plates at the centre support the spindle shaft in bearings and which at their periphery are connected to the stator housing.<br>
This arrangement would prove expensive with respect to the manufacture of the individual elements. Furthermore the bearings separated by the rotor can not be supplied with lubricant using a lubrication system which implies applica- tion of a long term lubrication as required where bearings can not be supplied by a central lubricating system via a plurality of ducts.<br>
It thus is the objective of the present invention to propose a cost effective concept of a spindle drive with individual motors. Furthermore the arrangement is to be laid out in such a maimer that the bearings can be supplied with lubricant using a simple lubricating system.<br>
From the German patent application DE 33 36 577 an individual motor spindle drive system is known in which a shaft pin on which the rotor of the electric motor is placed is pressed into rotatory elements in which arrangement the shaft pin end is embedded in a massive spindle upper portion serving for taking up spinning tubes. Using an arrangement oft his type rotational speeds of<br><br>
up to about 25000 rpm can be reached. It is a further objective of the present invention to design the spindle in such a manner that its inertia momentum is reduced.<br>
These objectives are met using an arrangement showing the characteristics according to the claims.<br>
The dependent claims concern advantageous further developments.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning machine with spindles with an individual motor drive in which the motor consists of a rotor on a shaft and of a stator in a motor housing, and with bearings, an upper bearing and a lower bearing being incorporated in a bearing unit, characterized in that below the bearing unit an electronic unit for the spindle is arranged.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail in the following with reference to an illustrated design example, the one single Fig. 1 schematically showing a sectional part view of a spindle driven by an individual motor according to the present invention.<br>
A shaft 18 is supported at its lower end in a lower bearing 52 and in an upper bearing 50 which preferentially are laid out as anti-friction bearings, in particular ball bearings. They are placed in a bearing housing 48 supported on a base plate 54. On the shaft 18 above the upper bearing 50 a rotor 34 of a motor 40 is arranged surrounded by a stator 36 arranged in a motor housing 42. Between the motor housing 42 and the bearing housing 48 a centring sleeve 44 is arranged. The motor housing 42 in turn is connected centrally to the base plate 54 serving as a housing for a lubricating oil sump 58. Above, and at a distance from, the rotor 34 a foot member 14 is arranged the foot<br><br>
member 14 and the head portion 12 being interconnected via a spindle tube 16 arranged coaxially with the shaft 18. The spindle tube takes up a spinning tube onto which in the course of the spirming process the yarn produced is wound. In the head portion 12 a clamping element 20 is provided for clamping the spinning tube (not shown) e.g. in the form of an 0-ring. The spindle 10 also can be laid out without a spindle tube; in this case a spinning tube 13 is<br><br>
centred and supported directly by the head portion, and the foot member respectively.<br>
On the foot member 14 a toothed disk 32, in ring spinning machines also called underwinding crown, is arranged. This toothed disk 32 co-operates with an upper flange 30 of a clamping sleeve 24 in order to clamp a yarn laid onto the foot member in the zone of an underwinding portion 15. For activating the clamping tube preferentially a ring support frame 84 of a ring spinning machine is used, on which a ring 86 is mounted, while the ring support frame 84 is its lowest position in such a manner that it is pressed onto a lower flange 28 of the clamping sleeve 24 whereby the clamping sleeve 24 against the force of a spring 26 is moved away from the toothed disk 32 in axial direction. The clamping tube is guided on a spindle sleeve 22 the upper end of which is conÂ¬nected to the foot member 14. The bearing arrangement 46 of the spindle 10 is supplied with lubricant from the oil sump 58 using an oil sump and wick lubricating arrangement, in which arrangement lubricant is transported via a wick 60 into the room between the upper bearing 50 and the lower bearing 52. An oil reservoir 62 made of absorbent material, e.g. of foam plastic, extends between the upper bearing 50 and the lower bearing 52. Towards the respective bearings an upper oil dispenser 64 is arranged at the upper end of the oil reservoir 62, and a lower oil dispenser 66 respectively, which supply devices prevent excessive oil supply from the oil reservoir. The dispensers 64, 66 can be laid out as grease filling between the bearings 50, 52 and the oil dispenser 62. The oil filling level 56 is to remain below the rotating elements of the lower bearing 52. From the Fig. 1 it can be seen that the rolling elements (balls) of the lower bearing 52, and of the upper bearing 50 respectively, are running directly on the surface of the shaft 18 and that the shaft 18 extends in one unit from the lower bearing 52 through to the head portion 12.<br><br>
The bearings 50, 52 advantageously are arranged distanced as far as possible from the rotor 34 of the motor 40 in such a manner that they are not subject to negative influences caused by magnetised elements. The bearings 50, 52 are to be mounted onto the shaft 18 after the rotor 34 has been magnetised.<br>
Below the motor housing 42, and the base plate 54 respectively, a dampening pad 70 can be arranged bridging the distance to an electronic unit 68. AlternaÂ¬tively, or additionally to the dampening pad 70, it can prove advantageous if a lower dampening pad 72 is arranged below the electronic unit 68. As a dampÂ¬ening material in the dampening pad 70, and in the dampening pad 72 respecÂ¬tively, a rubber-elastic element is applied (e.g. of Vulcolan polyurethane). The whole arrangement is placed on a spindle rail 74 comprising a leg 76 extendÂ¬ing transversely with respect to the axis of the shaft 18 and preferentially a further leg 78 arranged at right angles with respect to the first leg 76. The secÂ¬ond leg 78, one end of which is angled off, can be provided with a cover 80 which can extend at a distance from, and parallel to, the leg 78. In the room 82 between the second leg 78 and the cover 80 electric circuit cables or electric elements can be placed. This room is called cable duct 82. From the cable duct 82 connecting circuits can be laid out extending to the electronic unit 68, e.g. to an inverter or to switching elements in the electronic unit. For switching on and off the motor 40 a non contact switch can be provided in the electronic unit 68 which can be activated a remote control device held in the hand of an operator. The electronic unit 68 can be supplied from a direct current bus rail arranged in the cable duct 82. The electronic unit 68 is arranged at the same height level as the leg 78 of the spindle rail 74. Connecting circuits extend from the cable duct 82 into the electronic unit 68.<br>
An electronic unit 68 with one single inverter for inverting direct current (dc) into alternating current (ac) of variable frequency for a plurality of motors 40<br><br>
within a spinning machine, in which case the manufacturing cost of the spinÂ¬ning machine can be substantially reduced.<br>
The spindle upper portion comprising the upper portion of the shaft 18, the foot member 14, the head portion 12 and the spindle tube 16 is characterized by its low inertia momentum. The elements arranged coaxially with the shaft 18 mostly can be formed as die stamped or drawn sheet metal elements, e.g. the spindle tube 16, the clamping sleeve 24, the spindle sleeve 22, the motor housing 42, the centring sleeve 44 and the bearing housing 48, as well as the base plate 54, the foot member 14 and the head portion 12. For the motor housing 42, the bearing housing 48 or the foot member 14 also cast materials can be considered. The spindle rail 74 preferentially is made from steel plate.<br>
Below the ring support frame 84 advantageously a tube 88 can be arranged the inside diameter of which exceeds the outside diameter of the motor housÂ¬ing 42. Preferentially the tube 88 extends over the full length of the spindle upÂ¬per portion 11 to the clamping sleeve 24 while the ring support frame 84 is its uppermost position at the height of the head portion 12.<br>
The tube 88 mainly serves for shielding the spindles lined up side by side against each other and to restrict the air quantity whirled about by the rotating spindles 10 to the room inside the tube 88 in such a manner that the power requirement of the motor, or motors 40 is kept low.<br>
The spindle 10 produced according to the present invention at advantageous manufacturing cost is suitable for rotational speeds of above BO"OOO rpm.<br>
The motor 40 preferentially is laid out as an electronically controlled motor, i.e. as a direct current motor with electrical commutation. On the motor 40 means are provided for detecting a load cut-off, or too low a load respectively, e.g. after an end breakage or if the spinning tube 13 is missing, and a means for<br><br>
automatically cutting off the motor and for transmitting the load cut-off signal to a central control unit. The central control unit is connected to the individual spindle motors 40 e.g. via a bus circuit, each spindle motor being provided with its individual address and the operating mode of the motor being transmittable to the central control unit.<br>
The dimensions of the shaft 18 and of the elements placed thereon are chosen in such a manner that the spindle 10 during normal operation is rotating at a rotational speed above the first bending critical rotational speed.<br>
Owing to the arrangement of the bearings 50, 52 at the lower end of the shaft 18 in a bearing housing 48 the spindle 10 behaves like a spinning top which performs a precession due to unavoidable eccentricities. This precession is admitted owing to the dampening pad 70, and 72 respectively. The bearing play in the bearings 50, 52 is to be chosen as small as possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
