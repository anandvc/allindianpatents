				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a composite<br>
metal hydroxide of a uniform solid solution, a composite metal hydroxide<br>
obtained thereby and a flame retardant high-molecular composition<br>
thereby and therewith superior in flame retardancy and mechanical<br>
strength.<br>
This application has been divided out of the parent application no.<br>
1382/Cal/96 of 2.8.96 which relates to "A method of producing a<br>
composite metal hydroxide".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A demand for flame retardancy on resin composition or rubber<br>
composition has been increased year by year since a critical<br>
conflagration occurred in the past,<br>
To respond to such a strong demand for Improving flame<br>
retardancy, various flame retardants are marketed at present. Among all,<br>
in view of safety in manufacturing or using, a demand for improving flame<br>
retardancy has severely been increased centered on non-haloganated<br>
flame retardants. Under such a situation, metal hydroxides have come to<br>
be focused upon.<br>
However, since a dehydration temperature of, for example,<br>
aluminium hydroxide is iow (about 190°C) among the above metal<br>
hydroxides, there is a drawback that the kinds of applicable resins are<br>
limited in order to retain a molding temperature beiow the temperature of<br>
dehydration. In the meantime, since an Initial dehydration temperature for<br>
magnesium hydroxide is about 340°C, there is almost no limitation of the<br><br>
kinds of resins, however, a large amount should be added to obtain flame<br>
refardancy, resulting in deterioration of physical properties inherent in<br>
resins. Namely, there have been many problems practically. To solve<br>
these problems, for example, a composite metal hydroxide is proposed in<br>
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication (Tokkaihei) 6-41441. Compared<br>
with a magnesium hydroxide, the composite metal hydroxide realizes<br>
flame retardancy with less amount. However, when using zinc and<br>
magnesium hydroxide for producing a composite metal hydroxide, basic<br>
salts and oxides (zinc oxides) may be caused as by-products by<br>
characteristics of zinc as a solid solution element in a conventional<br>
method. In this way, It is difficult to obtain a composite metal hydroxide of<br>
a uniform solid solution and realize expected properties thereof such as<br>
flame retardancy and mechanical strength.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method of producing a composite metal hydroxide of a uniform solid<br>
solution having excellent flame retardancy, a composite metal hydroxide<br>
obtained thereby and a flame retardant high-molecular composition<br>
superior In mechanical strength obtained thereby and therewith.<br>
To accomplish the above object, a first gist of the invention relates<br>
to a method of producing a composite metal hydroxide characterized by<br>
reacting magnesium-containing aqueous solution (X) including water<br>
soluble zinc compound wherein magnesium ion concentration is 0.01 to 1<br>
mol/liter with alkaline material (Y) at a reaction equivalent ratio (X:Y) of<br>
X:Y˜ 1:1.01 to 1:1.20.<br>
A second gist of the invention relates to a method of producing a<br>
composite metal hydroxide thereby wherein the produced composite metal<br>
hydroxide is hydrot her malty treated at a temperature within a range of<br>
100 to 2G0°C in chlorine-containing aqueous medium wherein chlorine ion<br>
concentration is 0.5 to 2.0 mol/liter.<br>
A third gist of ths invention relates to a method of producing a<br>
composite metal hydroxide thereby wherein the produced metai hydroxide<br>
is heated in the presence of reaction mother liquor at a temperature within<br>
a range of 30 to 150°C and only the crystal surface thereof is substituted<br>
for nickel by adding water soluble nickel compound solution.<br>
A forth gist of the invention relates to a composite metal hydroxide<br>
obtained by a method according to the above first or second gist<br>
represented by the following general formula (1);<br>
Mg1-xZnx(OH)2 .....(1) <br>
wherein x indicates a positive number within a range of 0.003 = x = 0.1.<br>
A Fifth gist of the invention relates to a composite metal hydroxide<br>
obtained by a method according to the third gist represented by the<br>
following general formula (2);<br>
Mg1.x.yZnxNiy(OH)2..................(2)<br>
wherein x indicates a positive number within a range of 0.003=<br>
X = 0.1<br>
and y indicates a positive number within a range of 0.01iy<br>
= 0.05<br>
A sixth gist of the invention relates to a flame retardant high-<br>
molecular composition containing a composite metal hydroxide<br>
represented by the general formula (1) or (2) within a range of 80 to 150<br>
parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the high-molecular<br>
composition.<br>
It is difficult to stably produce a composite metal hydroxide of a<br>
uniform solid solution with Mg in conventional methods, since a stable<br>
crystal shape for a hydroxide is not hexagonal. For this reason, the<br>
inventors of the present invention have piled up studies on reaction<br>
processes for obtaining a uniform solid solution. Focused upon two points,<br>
the inventors have further accumulated their studies; one is an Mg ion<br>
concentration of Zn-containing Mg aqueous solution as a source of Mg<br>
and the other is a reaction equivalent ratio of the Zn-ccntaining Mg<br>
aqueous solution and alkaline material. As a result, they reached a<br>
conclusion that a composite metal hydroxide of a uniform solid solution<br>
represented by the above general formula (1) can be obtained by using<br>
Zn-containing Mg aqueous solution wherein Mg ion concentration Is set<br>
within a range of 0.01 to 1.0 mol/Jrter and reacting the Zn-containing Mg<br>
aqueous solution (x) and the alkaline material (Y) at a reaction equivalent<br>
ratio of (X:Y)=1:1.01 to 1:1.20. Further, they found out that occurrence of<br>
secondary aggregation can be restrained because the crystal shape of<br>
the composite metal hydroxide can be controlled by hydrothermally<br>
treatlng the composite metal hydroxide obtained by reacting thereof at the<br>
above reaction equivalent ratio in an aqueous medium having a specific<br>
chlorine ion concentration within a temperature range of 100 to 200°C for<br>
aging.<br>
Still further, they reached the present invention that the composite<br>
metal hydroxide represented by the general formula (2) wherein only the<br>
crystal surface is substituted for Ni can be obtained by heating thus<br>
obtained composite metal hydroxide within a temperature range of 80 to<br>
150°C in the presence of reaction mother liquor and adding water soluble<br>
Ni compound solution therein.<br>
Even still further, they found out that the flame retardant high-<br>
molecular composition wherein the composite metal hydroxide<br>
represented by the general formula (1) or (2) is contained within a range of<br>
80 to 150 parts by weight (just abbreviated to parts hereinafter) based on<br>
100 parts of the high-molecular compound has superior flame retardancy<br>
and satisfactory mechanical strength (such as tensile strength) even with<br>
less content thereof compared with the conventional ones.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Now, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
The method for producing the composite metal hydroxide of the<br>
present invention comprises three steps roughly.<br>
That is, the first step is a reaction step for producing the composite<br>
metal hydroxide represented by the following general formula (1) by<br>
reacting Zn-contalnlng Mg aqueous solution having a specific Mg Ion<br>
concentration and alkaline material at a specific equivalent ratio. This first<br>
reaction step is preferable conducted within a temperature range of 10 to<br>
35°C.<br>
Mg1-xZnx(OH)2 .... (1)<br>
wherein x represents a positive number within a range of<br>
0.003=x=0.1<br>
In the general formula (1), x value less than 0.003 is solid solution<br>
amount insufficient for emerging the expected effect of the composite<br>
metai hydroxide (superior flame retardancy). in the meantime, x value<br>
over 0.1 results in difficulty In forming a uniform solid solution, causing<br>
basic salts and oxides as by product, since an ion radius of zinc is larger<br>
than that of magnesium. Further, it is difficult to control a crystal shape<br>
and easy to cause secondary aggregation, which does not bring about the<br>
expected effect of the composite metal hydroxide.<br>
As the Zn-containing Mg aqueous solution, such an aqueous<br>
solution that Zn compound Is added into Mg aqueous solution is<br>
enumerated. As a source of the Mg aqueous solution, diluted bittern, sea<br>
water, magnesium nitrate and the like are enumerated in which Mg ion<br>
concentration should be set within a range of 0.01 to 1 mo (/lifer. Preferably<br>
it is within a range of 0.03 to 0.3 mol/liter, Namely, for example, when<br>
diluted bittern or sea water is adopted, Mg ion concentration over 1<br>
mol/ltter overwhelmingly causes by-products of basic salts, resulting in<br>
difficulty in forming a uniform solid solution. In addition, the Mg Ion<br>
concentration may be measured by a chela to metric titration method, an<br>
ICP emission spectrochemical analysis and the like. Measurement Is,<br>
however, not critical as long as It is a method for analyzing ion<br>
concentration in aqueous solution generally.<br>
As the Zn compound to be added into the Mg aqueous solution,any<br>
wafer soluble zinc compound such as zinc nitrate or zinc chloride is<br>
included with no limitation. The addition amount thereof based on the Mg<br>
aqueous solution is preferably set within a range of 0.3 to 10 mol% based<br>
on the Mg in the aqueous solution, more preferably 1 to 7 mol%. Namely<br>
the addition amount less than 0.3 mol % is too small an amount of solid<br>
solution to emerge the expected effect of a composite metal hydroxide. On<br>
the other hand, that over 10 mol % results in difficulty In forming a uniform<br>
solid solution since a zinc ion radius is larger than that of magnesium,<br>
causing basic salts and oxides as by-products. Further, it is difficult to<br>
control a crystal shape and easy to cause secondary aggregation, which<br>
shows a tendency that the expected effect of the composite metal<br>
hydroxide cannot be emerged.<br>
Still further, as the alkaline material to be reacted with the Zn-<br>
containlng Mg aqueous solution having a specific Mg Ion concentration,<br>
calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and the like are enumerated.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction ratio of the Zn-containing Mg aqueous<br>
solution (X) and the alkaline material (Y) at the first step is needed to be<br>
set at the equivalent ratio (X:Y)=1:1.01 to 1:1.20. Preferably, it Is set at<br>
X:Y=1:1.03 to 1:1.10. Namely, when the alkaline material (Y) is less than<br>
1.01 or the reaction equivalent ratio, by-products of basic salts may be<br>
identified, preventing formation of a uniform solid solution thereby, while<br>
when it is over 1.20, by-products of oxides may be identified, causing<br>
difficulty in controlling a crystal shape resulting in easiness in occurrence<br>
of secondary aggregation.<br>
The preferable combination of the Zn-containing Mg aqueous<br>
solution and the alkaline material at the first step is to adopt sea water (Mg<br>
aqueous solution) wherein zinc chloride, water soluble zinc compound,is <br>
added into Zn-containing Mg aqueous solution and calcium hydroxide<br>
(limemilk) as an alkaline material in view of stability of the produced<br>
composite metal hydroxide and the manufacturing cost.<br>
Subsequently, a method of the second step following the method of<br>
producing the composite metal hydroxide as the above first step is<br>
described here.<br>
The second step comprises thermally treating the composite metal<br>
hydroxide represented by the general formula (1) produced in the first step<br>
in chlorine-containing aqueous medium with a specific chlorine ion<br>
concentration within a temperature range of 100 to 2000C to be aged.<br>
As the chlorine-containing aqueous medium, aqueous solutions of<br>
calcium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium<br>
chloride and the like are enumerated. Among all, it is preferably to adopt<br>
calcium chloride aqueous solution as the chlorine-containing aqueous<br>
medium in view of controllability of the crystal shape of the composite<br>
metal hydroxide. Further, the chlorine ion concentration in the chlorine-<br>
containing aqueous medium should be set within a range of 0.5 to 2<br>
mol/liter. Preferably, it is within a range of 0.5 to 1.0 mol/llter. Namely, low<br>
concentration of chlorine ion less than 0.5 mol/liter may cause insufficient<br>
controllability of a crystal shape of the composite metal hydroxide,<br>
resulting in the easiness in occurrence of secondary aggregation. On the<br>
other hand, that over 2 mol/Wer may cause basic salts and oxides as by-<br>
products, resulting in difficulty in forming a uniform solid solution. In<br>
addition, the chlorine ion concentration may be measured by a general<br>
method for analyzing ion concentration in solution, such as a<br>
chelatometrlc tltration method or an ICP emission spectrochemical<br>
analysis.<br>
Even further, as the aging conditions for the thermal treatment, the<br>
temperature should be set within a range of 100 to 200°C and the<br>
pressure should be within a range of 0.5 to 10 kg/cm2 concomttantiy.<br>
Thus obtained composite metal hydroxide is represented by the<br>
general formula (1). The crystals may further grow and secondary<br>
aggregation may decrease through the second step, which results in more<br>
preferable flame retardants in view of various properties such as<br>
compatibility with a high-molecular compound, disperisibility, appearance<br>
of the formed product or mechanical strength.<br>
Next, the third step following the method of producing the<br>
composite metal hydroxide as the second step is described. The<br>
composite metal hydroxide obtained by this step is such as represented<br>
by the general formula (2), a solid solution comprising three metals of Mg,<br>
Zn, and Ni.<br>
Mg1-x-yZnxNly(OH)2.................(2)<br>
wherein x represents a positive number within a range of<br>
0.003=y=0.1 and y represents a positive number within a range of<br>
0.01=y=0.05.<br>
In the general formula (2), x value less than 0.003 is too small an<br>
amount of solid solution to emerge the expected effect (superior flame<br>
relardancy) of a composite metal hydroxide. On the other hand, that over<br>
0.1 mol % results in difficulty in forming a uniform solid solution since an<br>
Ion diameter of zinc is larger than that of magnesium, causing by-products<br>
of basic salts and oxides. In addition, it may cause difficulty in controlling a<br>
crystal shape and easiness in occurrence of secondary aggregation,<br>
which does not bring about the expected effect of composite metal<br>
hydroxide. In the meantime, y value less than 0.01 may cause<br>
insufficiency of nickel substitution amount on the crystal surface, which<br>
does not fully emerge the expected effect of the composite metal<br>
hydroxide, in addition, that over 0.05 may cause cost increase and also<br>
saturation of the nickel substitution amount on the crystal surface,<br>
resulting in by-products of free nickel hydroxide and the like.<br>
In the third step, the composite metal hydroxide represented by the<br>
general formula (1), which was produced in the second step, is heated in<br>
the presence of reaction mother liquor within a temperature range of 80 to<br>
150°C and water soluble nickel compound solution is added therein so as<br>
to substitute only the crystal surface for Nl, resulting In the composite<br>
metal hydroxide represented by the general formula (2).<br>
As the water soluble nickel composite solution, aqueous solutions<br>
of nickel chloride, nickel nitrate and the like are enumerated. Among all, It<br>
is preferable to use nickel chloride in view of reactivity with composite<br>
metal hydroxide. Further the mixing ratio of such water soluble nickel<br>
compound solution is preferably set within 1 to 5 moi % based on the<br>
composite metal hydroxide of a reaction mother liquor. Particularly, it is<br>
preferable to be within 1 to 3 moi %.<br>
In the meantime, a heating condition in adding water soluble nickel<br>
compound solution, as mentioned above, is set within a temperature<br>
range of 80 to 150°C. Particularly, it is preferable to set within a<br>
temperature range of 90 to 120°C. By setting as such, It becomes possible<br>
to substitute only the crystal surface effectively for nickel. Namely the<br>
lower temperature may cause free nickel hydroxides as by-products due<br>
to insufficient substitution. On the other hand, the higher temperature may<br>
cause excessive nickel substitution extending into the inside of crystal<br>
structure. In both ways, the expected effect is not realized.<br>
Thus, as the composite metal hydroxide represented by the general<br>
formula (1) through the first or second step, or represented by the general<br>
formula (2) through the third step, the crystal size is 0.2 to 4 mm, more<br>
preferably 0.2 to 2pm, most preferably 0.5 to 1.5 mm, and that with almost<br>
no or less secondary aggregation, which means that the average<br>
secondary particle size is 0.2 to 4mm, more preferably 0.2 to 2 mm, most<br>
preferably 0.5 to 1.5pm, and also a BET specific surface area is 1 to 20<br>
mVg, preferably 3 to 15 m2/g, most preferably 6 to 12 m2/g. Namely, since<br>
each value for the composite metal hydroxide is set within a range as<br>
above, it becomes possible to retain superior effects in compatibility with<br>
high-molecular com pounds such as resin or rubber, dispersibility, forming<br>
capability, appearance of the formed products, mechanical strength and<br>
the Wee to be mentioned below. In addition, the above average secondary<br>
particle diameter is a value measured by the microtrack method on<br>
sample powder, which was dispersed by as ultrasonic treatment, in 0.2%<br>
sodium hexametaphosphate aqueous solution.<br>
The BET specific surface area is a value in accordance with an N2<br>
adsorption method.<br>
Thus obtained composite metal hydroxide represented by the<br>
above general formula (1) or (2), may be used as a flame retardant as it is,<br>
however, it may possible to additionally conduct surface treatment with<br>
finishing agents such as various fatty acids, phosphoric acid ester,<br>
coupling agents and the like. The various finishing agents may be used<br>
solely or in combination of two or more.<br>
As the various fatty acids, higher fatty acids having 10 or more<br>
carbon atoms such as stearic acid, oielc acid, erucic add, palmitic acid,<br>
lauric acid and behenic acid, and alkall metal salts thereof may be listed,<br>
in addition, as the phosphate esters, mono-or diesters of orthophosphoric<br>
acid with oleyi alcohol or stearyl alcohol, mixtures of these, acid type or<br>
alkali metal salts or amine salts thereof may be listed.<br>
As the above couplings agents, silane-coupling agents such as<br>
vinylethoxysilane, vinyl-tris(2-methoxy-ethoxy)silane<br>
methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysllane, <br>
grycidioxypropyltrimethoxysilane, <br>
aminopropyitrimethoxysiiane <br>
epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane, <br>
mercaptopropyftrlmethoxysllane, tltanate coupling agents such as<br>
isopropyltrisostearoyl titanate, isopropyitris (dioctylpyrophosphate)titanate,<br>
isopropyltrl(N-aminoethyl-aminoethyl) titanate and<br>
isopropyitridecyibenzenesulfonyi titanate; aluminium coupling agents such<br>
as acetoalkoxyalminium diisopropylate.<br>
As the above surface treatment with various finishing agents, a<br>
conventional moisture or dry method is available, with no limitation.<br>
Then, by adding the composite metal hydroxide represented by the<br>
general formula (1) or (2) as a flame retardant into the high -molecular<br>
compound, a flame retardant having high-molecular composition can be<br>
obtained.<br>
As the above high-molecular compound, general resin, rubber and<br>
the like may be emumerated. For example, a copolymer of polyethylene or<br>
ethylene with other a-olefin, a copolymer of ethylene with vinyl acetate,<br>
ethyl acrylate or methyl acrylate, polypropylene, a copolymer of propylene<br>
with other a-olefin, polybutene-l, polystyrene, a styrene-acrylonltrile<br>
copolymer, thermoplastic resin such as vinyl acetate, poryacrylate,<br>
polymerchacrylate, polyurethane, polyester, polyether, pofyajmide,<br>
thermosetting resins such as phenolic resin, melamine resin, epoxy resin,<br>
unsaturated polyester resin, alkyd resin, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber,<br>
stylene-butadine rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, butyl rubber,<br>
isoprene rubber, chlorosutfonated polyethlene and the like. These high-<br>
moiecuiar compounds are appropreatefy selected.<br>
At that time, the mixing ratio of the composite metal hydroxide<br>
represented by the general formula (1) or (2) is selected appropreately<br>
depending on the kinds of the above high-molecular compounds and the<br>
like, it is set within a range of 80 to 150 parts by weight based on 100<br>
parts of the high-molecular compounds. Particularly, it is preferably 100 to<br>
130 parts. Namely, the mixing ratio thereof less than 80 parts may cause<br>
insufficient flame retardancy, while that over 150 parts may cause<br>
deterioration in mechanical strength such as tensile strength. Further, the<br>
composite metal hydroxide represented by the general formula (1) or (2)<br>
may be used solely or In combination as long as its mixing ratio is set<br>
within the above range.<br>
Further, various additives may be added appropriately other than<br>
the above composite metal hydroxide represented by the general formula<br>
(I) or (2) into the flame retardant high-molecular composition of the<br>
present invention. For Example, a general flame retardant aid such as<br>
carbon fine powder, red phosphorus is enumerated. Moreover, lubricants,<br>
antioxidants, ultraviolet inhibitors, antistatic agents, pigments, foaming<br>
agents, plasticizers, fillers, reinforcing materials, crosslinking agents and<br>
the like are enumerated.<br>
The flame retardant high-molecular compound can be obtained by<br>
adding the composite metal hydroxide represented by the general formula<br>
(1) or (2) into the high-molecular compound at a specific ratio, mixing and<br>
then kneading thereof. As a method for mixing and kneading thereof,<br>
conventional methods such as single-screw or twin-screw extruder, a roll,<br>
Banbury mixer and the like may be enumerated with no limitation.<br>
Then, as a method for forming with thus obtained flame retardant<br>
high-molecular compound, a suitable molding method is selected<br>
appropriately depending on the kinds of the high-molecular compounds,<br>
the kinds of desired molded products and the like with no limitation. For<br>
Example, Injection molding, extrusion blow molding, press molding,<br>
rotational molding, calendering, sheet forming, transfer molding, laminate<br>
molding, vacuum molding and the like may be enumerated.<br>
Further, a solid solution containing Zn and Mg cannot be obtained<br>
by the methods disclosed by EP 9230773.6 (hereinafter Just referred as<br>
D1) and EP 92310744.5 (hereinafter just referred as D2). Only Zn is an<br>
amphoteric metal among Mn, Fe, Co, Nl, Cu and Zn, which are disclosed<br>
as divalent metals in D1 and D2, and Zn hydroxide in substantially<br>
unstable. Therefore, if reaction conditions such as reaction solution pH<br>
and mother liquor concentration are not maintained appropriately in<br>
producing a solid solution containing Zn and Mg by reacting aqueous<br>
solution thereof, basic salts and oxides may be caused as by-products,<br>
resulting in a difficulty in producing a uniform Zn solid solution.<br>
A reaction equivalent ratio of 0.5 to 0.95 disclosed in D1 and D2 is<br>
within such a range as causes basic salts.<br>
On the contrary, to solve the above problems, reaction solution pH<br>
is within an appropriate range of an alkaline side by adjusting a reaction<br>
equivalent ratio within 1.01 to 1.20, and by-production of basic salts is<br>
restrained by lowering mother liquor concentration, resulting in a uniform<br>
Zn solid solution.<br>
Namely, among products disclosed in D1 and 02, the products<br>
containing Zn as a divalent metal is not a uniform solution of Zn and Mg,<br>
but a mixture of magnesium hydroxide and basic zinc chloride.<br>
Therefore, it Is obvious that the product of the present Invention<br>
differs from those of 01 and D2, and flame retardancy cannot be realised<br>
from magnesium hydroxide solid solutions of D1 and D2. This is described<br>
in the following Examples 11 to 15 and Comparative Examples 8 to 10.<br>
Further, the crystal of the composite metal hydroxide of EP<br>
92304925.8 (hereinafter just referred as D3) is long and fibrous, and has a<br>
length/diameter ratio of about 10 or more, an average diameter of<br>
approximately 0.1 to 10 urn and an average length of approximately 2 to<br>
1000 urn.<br>
On the contrary, the crystal of the composite metal hydroxide of the<br>
present invention Is a hexagonal plate, and has an average diameter of<br>
0.2 to 4 urn, an average thickness of 0 1 to 0.5 urn, and an aspect ratio<br>
(diameter/thickness ratio) of not more than 10.<br>
Further, the method of the present invention differs from that of D3.<br>
The method of D3 comprises the steps of adding an aqueous<br>
solution of the divalent transition metal of the formula M2+ A- 2 wherein M<br>
is a divalent metal such as Mn into an aqueous solution of magnesium salt<br>
represented by the formula MgA2 containing the acicular-crystal<br>
magnesium salt represented by the formula Mg(OH)2-y A-y • mH2O<br>
wherein A" is a monovalent anion with stirring, for obtaining the acicular-<br>
crystal basic magnesium salt represented by the formula M2+ x Mg1-x<br>
(OH)2-zA-z. mH2O, dehydrating thus obtained acicular-crystal basic<br>
magnesium salt, washing thereof with water, and then contacting the<br>
acicular-crystal basic magnesium salt with alkali such as sodium<br>
hydroxide In liquid medium such as water for reaction so as to substitute<br>
A z with OH " thus, the fibrous composite metal hydroxide can be<br>
obtained.<br>
On the contrary, a method of producing a composite metal<br>
hydroxide of the present invention comprises the steps of reacting<br>
magnesium-containing aqueous solution (X) including water soluble zinc<br>
compound wherein magnesium Ion concentration is 0.01 to 1 mol/llter with<br>

added into the composite metal hydroxide by 2 weight % as oleic acid so<br>
as to be surface treated. Then, it was dehydrated, washed with water and<br>
dried in an oven.<br>
Further, as a specimen, 0.2 parts antioxidant and each composite<br>
metal hydroxide (of examples), surface treated at ratios shown in the<br>
following table 3, were added based on 100 parts ethylene-ethylacrylate<br>
coporymer (ethylene acrylate content; 15 weight %, Nippon<br>
Petrochemicals Co. Ltd) so as to be mixed in a blender. After being mixed,<br>
it was kneaded by an open-roll mixer at 130°C and further press-molded<br>
at 160°C so as to be made into a sheet in 1 mm thickness and a sheet in<br>
about 3.2 mm thickness (1/8 inch) respectively. Then, each of the sheets<br>
was punched Into a dumbbell-shape and a strip-shape as samples<br>
respectively. These samples were subjected to a tensile test in<br>
accordance with JIS C3005 and a combustibility test in accordance with<br>
UL94VE.<br>

shown In the following table 4 were mixed at ratios specified therein .<br>
Except for that, each sheet was formed in the same way as that of<br>
examples 12 to 19. Then, each sheet was punched into a dumbbell-shape<br>
and a stripe-shape as specimens. These specimens were subjected to a<br>
tensile test in accordance with JIS C300S and a combustibility test in<br>
accordance with UL94VE.<br>
The results of tensile strength and combustibility tests by using these<br>
specimens are shown in the following tables 5 and 6.<br>
From the above tables 5 and 6, it is found out that all comparative<br>
examples were low in tensile strength and inferior in mechanical strength.<br>
Further, good results were not obtained for flame retardancy on<br>
comparative examples 8 to 10. On the other hand, good results were<br>
obtained for flame retardancy on ail examples although composite metal<br>
hydroxides were less added than in comparative examples. Still further,<br>
tensile strength on examples was superior to that of ail comparative<br>
examples, which shows that all examples retain high flame retardancy as<br>
well as mechanical strength.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
As the above, the composite metal hydroxide represented by the general<br>
formula (1) is produced by reacting Zn-confalning Mg aqueous solution<br>
having a specific Mg ion concentration and alkaline material at a specific<br>
reaction equivalent ratio. For this reason, a composite metal hydroxide, a<br>
uniform solid solution, wherein Zn is solid solved Into Mg system, which Is<br>
difficult to produce in the conventional methods can be obtained. Further,<br>
the composite metal hydroxide obtained at this reaction equivalent ratio is<br>
aged in aqueous medium having a specific chlorine ion concentration at a<br>
specific temperature so as to produce the composite metal hydroxide<br>
represented by general formu!a(1), whose crystal shape can be controlled,<br>
which prevents occurrence of secondary aggregation.<br>
in addition, the composite metal hydroxide represented by the general<br>
formula (2) wherein only the crystal surface is substituted for Ni can be<br>
obtained by adding water soluble Ni compound solution into the composite<br>
metal hydroxide represented by the general formula (1) at a specific<br>
temperature in the presence of reaction mother liquor. Thus obtained<br>
composite metal hydroxide is a uniform solid solution wherein Zn is solid<br>
solved into Mg system. Therefore, the flame retardant high-molecular<br>
composition obtained by mixing the composite metal hydroxide<br>
represented by the general formula (1) or (2) at a specific volume based<br>
on the high-molecular compound exerts high flame retardancy with less<br>
content thereof compared with the conventional ones and shows<br>
superiority in mechanical strength.<br>
