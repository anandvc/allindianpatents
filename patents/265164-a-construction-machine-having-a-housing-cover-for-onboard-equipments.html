				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
CONSTRUCTION MACHINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a construction machine, for example,<br>
like a hydraulic excavator or a wheel loader, and more particularly<br>
to a construction machine having a housing cover for onboard<br>
equipments.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, a hydraulic excavator, typical of construction<br>
machines, is largely constituted by an automotive vehicular lower<br>
structure, an upper revolving structure which is swingably mounted<br>
on the vehicular lower structure, and a working mechanism liftably<br>
mounted on a front portion of the upper revolving structure.<br>
Normally, the upper revolving structure is largely<br>
constituted by a revolving frame serving as a support structure,<br>
a cab which is built on a left front portion of the revolving frame<br>
to define an operating room, a counterweight which is provided at<br>
the rear end of the revolving frame as a weight balance against<br>
the working mechanism, and a housing cover which is provided on<br>
the revolving frame on the front side of the counterweight. The<br>
1<br><br>
housing cover is provided to accommodate onboard equipments which<br>
are mounted on the revolving frame, including an engine, hydraulic<br>
pump and heat exchanger (e.g., see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
2000-64348 and 2002-129592).<br>
In the case of hydraulic excavators of the prior arts,<br>
normally a housing cover is fixed on a revolving frame by means<br>
of seat screw members which are fixed by welding or the like. At<br>
the time of fixing a housing cover on a revolving frame, bolts are<br>
threaded into seat screw members through bolt through holes which<br>
are provided in the housing cover.<br>
In this regard, since the housing cover is a heavy structure,<br>
normally it becomes necessary to put the housing cover tentatively<br>
on top of the revolving frame, while bringing a bolt or bolts into<br>
alignment with a seat screw member or members prior to threading<br>
and tightening the bolts into the latter.<br>
On such an occasion, normally anti-corrosive sealing<br>
material is provided at joint portions of the revolving frame and<br>
each seat screw member, for sealing the joint portions against<br>
corrosion which might develop at joint portions of the revolving<br>
frame and seat screw members when not coated with a paint to a<br>
sufficient degree.<br>
However, when setting a bolt threaded into the housing cover<br>
in position to the seat screw member on the revolving frame, the<br>
2<br><br>
housing cover is inadvertently put on top of the revolving frame<br>
in some cases, bringing the lower end of the housing cover into<br>
contact with the sealing material on the revolving frame to cause<br>
damages to the sealing material.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the above-discussed problem with the prior art,<br>
it is an object of the present invention to provide a construction<br>
machine which is arranged particularly to prevent a partition panel<br>
from contacting a frame at the time of attaching the partition panel<br>
to a seat screw member on the frame, permitting to mount the<br>
partition panel efficiently in a facilitated manner.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
construction machine which is arranged particularly to facilitate<br>
alignment of a partition panel with a seat screw member on a frame,<br>
permitting to mount the partition panel efficiently in position<br>
on the frame.<br>
In order to achieve the above-stated objectives, the present<br>
invention is applied to a construction machine which includes a<br>
frame which constitutes a support structure, onboard equipments<br>
mounted on the support frame including an engine and a heat exchanger,<br>
a housing cover including a partition panel and internally defining<br>
a machine room to accommodate the onboard equipments, and a seat<br>
3<br><br>
screw member provided on the frame for fixing the partition panel<br>
thereon.<br>
(1) The construction machine according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the partition panel is provided<br>
with a bolt through hole to insert a bolt and a stopper adapted<br>
to rest on an upper end of the seat screw member on the frame, hanging<br>
a lower end of the partition panel in a floated state above the<br>
frame while threading and tightening the bolt into the seat screw<br>
member through the bolt through hole for fixing the partition panel<br>
to the seat screw member.<br>
With the arrangements just described, at the time of fixing<br>
a partition panel to a seat screw member which is provided on a<br>
frame, the stopper on the partition panel can be placed to rest<br>
on an upper end of a seat screw member, letting a lower end of the<br>
partition panel hang down in a floated state above the frame.<br>
Therefore, the bolt through hole in the partition panel can be easily<br>
brought into an aligned position relative to the seat screw member<br>
at the time of fixing the partition panel to the seat screw member<br>
by threading a bolt into the seat screw member through the bolt<br>
through hole in the partition panel. Thus, the partition panel can<br>
be fixed to the seat screw member efficiently in a facilitated manner.<br>
Besides, the lower end of the partition panel can be kept out of<br>
contact with the frame for protection of an anti-corrosion sealing<br>
4<br><br>
material or coating which is applied or formed on a top surface<br>
of the frame.<br>
(2)	According to the present invention, the stopper is located<br>
at a level lower than a height of the seat screw member. Accordingly,<br>
when the stopper is put to rest on an upper end of the seat screw<br>
member, the lower end of the partition panel is hung down always<br>
in a floated state above the top surface of the frame.<br>
(3)	Further, according to the present invention, the<br>
partition panel is constituted by an upright plate portion erected<br>
on upward and downward directions, and a bent edge portion formed<br>
by bending a side portion of the upright plate portion and provided<br>
with the bolt through hole, and the stopper is securely fixed on<br>
the upright plate portion at a position higher than the bolt through<br>
hole and in a lower corner portion adjoining the bent edge portion<br>
to serve also as a reinforcing member for the partition panel.<br>
In this case, after putting the stopper on top of the seat<br>
screw member, the bolt in the bolt through hole of the partition<br>
panel can be easily threaded into the seat screw member. Besides,<br>
since the stopper is securely fixed to both of the upright plate<br>
portion and bent edge portion of the partition panel, it can be<br>
utilized as a reinforcing means enhancing the rigidity of the<br>
partition panel as a whole.<br>
(4) Further, according to the present invention, the seat<br>
5<br><br>
screw member is constituted by a plate member erected on the frame,<br>
and a nut securely fixed on the plate member at a position<br>
corresponding to said bolt through hole of said partition panel,<br>
and the stopper is located at a level lower than a height of the<br>
plate member.<br>
In this case, lower end of the partition panel can be kept<br>
in a floated state above the frame simply by putting the partition<br>
panel to rest on the plate member of the seat screw member erected<br>
on the frame, permitting to align the position of the bolt through<br>
hole in the partition panel with the nut of the seat screw member<br>
surely in a facilitated and efficient way.<br>
Therefore, the bolt in the bolt through hole can be easily<br>
threaded into and tightened with the nut of the seat screw member,<br>
while lower end of the partition panel kept in a floated state above<br>
the frame, permitting to mount the partition panel efficiently in<br>
a facilitated manner.<br>
(5) Further, according to the present invention, the<br>
construction machine further comprises a door hinged on the<br>
partition panel and provided with a stay which is engageable with<br>
the stopper to lock the door in an open position.<br>
In this case, a stay on a door can be hooked on the stopper<br>
on the partition panel to lock the door in an open position. Since<br>
the stopper which is provided on the partition panel can be utilized<br>
6<br><br>
also as a stay catch member, there is no need for adding a part<br>
exclusively for the purpose of catching a stay of the door. That<br>
is to say, it becomes possible to reduce the number of parts.<br>
(6) Further, according to the present invention, the<br>
construction machine further comprises an anti-corrosive sealing<br>
material applied around a joint portion of the frame and the seat<br>
screw member, the sealing material being protected from and kept<br>
out of contact with a lower end of the partition panel by the stopper<br>
holding the lower end of the partition panel in a floated state<br>
above the frame.<br>
In this case, by the use of the stopper, a lower end of the<br>
partition panel can be hung in a floated state above the frame while<br>
tentatively setting the partition panel in position relative to<br>
the seat screw member. Therefore, the anti-corrosion sealing<br>
material which is applied around a joint portion of the frame and<br>
the seat screw member can be kept out of contact with the lower<br>
end of the partition panel. That is to say, a joint portion of the<br>
frame and seat screw member can be maintained in a corrosion-proof<br>
state over a long period of time, keeping the exterior of the machine<br>
in good conditions.<br>
(7) Further, according to the present invention, the<br>
construction machine further comprises a cab mounted on a front<br>
portion of the frame on the front side of the housing cover, the<br>
7<br><br>
partition panel being employed as a member for partitioning off<br>
the housing cover from the rear side of the cab, permitting to mount<br>
the partition panel efficiently in position which partition off<br>
the housing cover on the rear side of the cab.<br>

revolving frame 4, on the front side of the counterweight 37 which<br>
will be described hereinafter. As shown in Fig. 5, the housing<br>
cover 21 accommodates the onboard equipments on the revolving frame<br>
4, including the engine 14, hydraulic pump 15 and heat exchanger<br>
16. In this instance, as shown in Figs. 1 and 5 to 7, the housing<br>
cover 21 is composed of a top panel 21A, bonnet 21B, right door<br>
21C and support frame structure 17 of the heat exchanger 16, as<br>
well as the front partition panel 24, left front door 29 and left<br>
rear door 33 which will be described later on.<br>
The housing cover 21 is partitioned off by the top panel 21A<br>
and bonnet 21B on the top side, by the right door 21C on the right<br>
side and by the left front door 29 and left rear door 33 on the<br>
left side, respectively. On the front side, the housing cover 21<br>
16<br><br>
is partitioned off by the front partition panel 24 and an operating<br>
oil tank 36 which will be described later. Further, on the rear<br>
side, the housing cover 21 is partitioned off by the rear partition<br>
plate 17B of the support frame structure 17 of the heat exchanger<br>
16 and front of the counterweight 37.<br>
Indicated at 22 is a machine room which is provided within<br>
the housing cover 21. As shown in Figs. 5 to 7, the machine room<br>
22 is defined by the top panel 21, bonnet 21B, right door 21C, left<br>
rear door 33, support frame structure 17 of the heat exchanger 16,<br>
operating oil tank 36, and counterweight 37 to accommodate the<br>
engine 14, hydraulic pump 15 and heat exchanger 16. The machine<br>
room 22 can be opened and closed by way of the right door 21C and<br>
the left rear door 33.<br>
Denoted at 23 is a utility room which is provided within the<br>
housing cover 21 along with the machine room 22. As shown in Figs.<br>
5 to 7, the utility room 23 is defined by the front partition plate<br>
17A of the support frame structure 17 of the heat exchanger 16,<br>
and front partition panel 24 and left front door 29 which will be<br>
described later on. In addition to the air cleaner 14C of the engine<br>
14, for example, the utility room 23 adapted to accommodate a grease<br>
gun and a tool box (both of them are not shown) . The utility room<br>
23 can be opened and closed by way of the left front door 29.<br>
Indicated at 24 is a front partition panel which is provided<br>
17<br><br>
on the rear side of a cab 35 which will be described hereinafter.<br>
This front partition panel 24 constitutes part of the housing cover<br>
21. Further, the front partition panel 24 is located in a<br>
confronting position relative to a rear side 35B of the cab 35,<br>
which will be described hereinafter, partitioning a left front side<br>
of the housing cover 21 from the rear side 35B of the cab 35. In<br>
this instance, as shown in Figs. 9 to 13, the front partition panel<br>
24 is formed in a flat rectangular shape as a whole, for example,<br>
by bending a steel plate. More particularly, the front partition<br>
panel 24 is constituted by a rectangular upright plate portion 24A<br>
erected on vertically and bordered by bent edges at four sides<br>
thereof, including an upper bent edge portion 24B, a lower bent<br>
edge portion 24C, a left bent edge portion 24D and a right bent<br>
edge portion 24E.<br>
In this instance, four nuts 25 in total are welded in<br>
vertically spaced positions on the left bent edge portion 24D of<br>
the front partition panel 24 for fitting a left front door 29 which<br>
will be described hereinafter. Besides, a bolt through hole 26 is<br>
bored in a lower end portion of the left bent edge portion 24D.<br>
As shown in Figs. 10 and 11, a bolt 27 is put in the bolt through<br>
hole 26 in the left bent edge portion 24D, and the front partition<br>
panel 24 is fastened to the seat screw member 20 by threading the<br>
bolt 27 into the nut 20B of the seat screw member 20 on the left<br>
18<br><br>
side frame 11.<br>
Denoted at 28 is a stopper which is provided on the front<br>
partition panel 24 on the upper side of the bolt through hole 26.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, this stopper 28 is formed of a steel plate<br>
and in the shape of a flat rectangular strip extending in a direction<br>
away from the front partition panel 24. The stopper 28 is securely<br>
welded to a corner portion between the lower side of the upright<br>
plate portion 24A and the left bent edge portion 24D of the front<br>
partition panel 24, slightly upward of the bolt through hole 26.<br>
In this instance, as shown in Fig. 14, the lower side of the<br>
stopper 28 is located at a height A from a lower end portion 24F<br>
of the front partition panel 24, which is slightly smaller (lower)<br>
than a height B of the upper end portion 20C of the seat screw member<br>
20 from the upper surface 11A of the left side frame 11, that is,<br>
in the relations of A 
Therefore, when the front partition panel 24 is put on the<br>
upper end portion 20C of the seat screw member 20 as shown in Fig.<br>
15 and so forth, a gap space G is left between the lower end portion<br>
24F of the front partition panel 24 and the upper surface 11A of<br>
the left side frame 11 to hold the lower end portion 24F of the<br>
front partition panel 24 in a floated state above the upper surface<br>
11A of the left side frame 11.<br>
In this manner, by the stopper 28, the heavy front partition<br>
19<br><br>
panel 24 can be held in a floated state above the gap space G at<br>
the time of fastening same to the seat screw member 20, preventing<br>
the lower end portion 24F of the front partition panel 24 from<br>
contacting the upper surface 11A of the left side frame 11, for<br>
protection of a sealing material 34 which is applied on the upper<br>
surface 11A of the left side frame 11 as described hereinafter.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 15, while holding the stopper 28<br>
on the upper end portion 20C of the seat screw member 20, the bolt<br>
through hole 26 of the front partition panel 24 can be easily set<br>
in an aligned position relative to the nut 20B on the seat screw<br>
member 20. Thus, as shown in Fig. 16, the bolt 27 in the bolt through<br>
hole 26 can be easily threaded into the nut 20B on the seat screw<br>
member 20.<br>
Further, since the stopper 28 is securely fixed to both of<br>
the upright plate portion 24A and the left bent edge portion 24D<br>
(in a corner portion) of the front partition panel 24 by welding,<br>
for example, it also functions as a reinforcing member for enhancing<br>
the rigidity of the front partition panel 24 as a whole.<br>
Denoted at 28A is a stay through hole which is provided in<br>
a distal end portion of the stopper 28, which is projected in a<br>
rearward direction from the front partition panel 24, to releasably<br>
hold the other end 32B of a stay 32 which will be described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
20<br><br>
Indicated at 29 is a left front door which is hinged on the<br>
front partition panel 24 to open and close the utility room 23.<br>
In this instance, as shown in Figs. 9, 12 and 13, this left front<br>
door 29 is formed, for example, in a flat rectangular shape as a<br>
whole by the use of a steel plate and arranged to rise upward from<br>
the revolving frame 4 substantially to the same level as the front<br>
partition panel 24. Front and rear reinforcing members 29A and 29B<br>
in the form of vertically extending pillars are attached on the<br>
inner side of the left front door 29. Further, on the inner side<br>
of the left front door 29, a stay holder 29C of an L-shape in section<br>
is securely fixed on a lower end portion of the left front door<br>
29 to hold a stay 32, which will be described hereinafter.<br>
Indicated at 30 are upper and lower hinge members which are<br>
provided between the front partition panel 24 and the left front<br>
door 29. At one end, these hinges 30 are securely fixed to the front<br>
reinforcing member 29A which is fixed on the inner side of the left<br>
front door 29. At the other end, by the use of bolts 31, the hinges<br>
30 are fastened to nuts 25 which is fixed on the left bent edge<br>
portion 24D of the front partition panel 24. Thus, the left front<br>
door 29 is attached to the front partition panel 24 swingably<br>
supported on the hinges 30, and movable between a closed position<br>
substantially in parallel relation with the left side frame 11 as<br>
shown in Fig. 12 and an open position substantially in orthogonal<br>
21<br><br>
relation with the left side frame 11 as shown in Figs. 6 and 13.<br>
Thus, the left front door 29 serves to open and close the utility<br>
room 23 which is formed within the housing cover 21.<br>
Indicated at 32 is a stay which is retained in the stay holder<br>
29C of the left front door 29. This stay 32 serves to hold the left<br>
front door 29 in an open position as shown in Fig. 13, and, for<br>
example, in the form of a steel rod which is bent in a shallow U-shape<br>
as a whole.<br>
In this instance, the one end 32A of the stay 32 is loosely<br>
fitted in the stay holder 29C in a locked state in vertical direction,<br>
and retained on the left front door 29 through the stay holder 29C.<br>
On the other hand, the other end 32B of the stay 32 is a free end<br>
which is liftably and extractably retained in the stay holder 29C.<br>
Thus, the other end 32B of the stay 32 can be lifted out of the<br>
stay holder 29C to turn the stay 32 about the vertically locked<br>
end 32A.<br>
When the left front door 29 is opened from the closed position<br>
shown in Fig. 12 to the open position shown in Fig. 13, the other<br>
end 32B of the stay 32 is extracted from the stay holder 29C and<br>
put in the stay through hole 28A of the stopper 28 which is projected<br>
from the front partition panel 24. As a consequence, the other end<br>
32B of the stay 32 is hooked in the stay through hole 28A of the<br>
stopper 28, and the left front door 29 is kept in an open state<br>
22<br><br>
(in an open position) by way of the stay 32.<br>
Designated at 33 is a left rear door which is located behind<br>
the left front door 29 to open and close the machine room 22. In<br>
this instance, substantially in the same way as the above-described<br>
left front door 29, the left rear door 33 is formed in a flat<br>
rectangular shape as a whole by the use of a steel plate (Figs.<br>
6 and 9) . The left rear door 33 is pivotally supported on the rear<br>
partition plate 17B of the support frame structure 17 of the heat<br>
exchanger 16 through hinge members (not shown), forming double<br>
doors together with the left front door 29 for opening and closing<br>
the machine room 22 in the housing cover 21 from the side of the<br>
heat exchanger 16 as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Indicated at 34 is a sealing material which is applied between<br>
the left side frame 11 and the seat screw member 20. As shown in<br>
Figs. 11, 14 etc., the sealing material 34 is a filler like putty<br>
or plastic which is applied to joint portions of the upper surface<br>
11A of the left side frame 11 and the folded plate 20A of the seat<br>
screw member 20. The sealing material 34 serves to improve the<br>
exterior of the hydraulic excavator 1 by preventing corrosion which<br>
would occur at the joints of the upper surface 11A of the left side<br>
frame 11 and the folded plate 20A of the seat screw members 20 in<br>
case the joint portions are not coated with a paint in a sufficient<br>
degree.<br>
23<br><br>
Indicated at 35 is a cab which is provided on a left front<br>
portion of the revolving frame 4. The cab 35 is enclosed by front<br>
section 35A, rear section 35B, left and right side sections 35C<br>
and upper section 35D, which define an operating room. In this<br>
instance, as shown in Fig. 3, the cab 35 is fixed on the cab mount<br>
portions 8A on the left extension beam 8 and on the cab mount portions<br>
9A on the cab support frame 9 through a mount member (not shown).<br>
The rear section 35B of the cab 35 is confronted face to face by<br>
the front partition panel 24 which is located on the rear side of<br>
the cab 35 (Fig. 6).<br>
Denoted at 36 is an operating oil tank which is located on<br>
a right front portion of the revolving frame 4. This operating oil<br>
tank 36 stores operating oil to be supplied to various hydraulic<br>
actuators of the hydraulic excavator 1. In this case, right front<br>
side of the housing cover 21 is partitioned off by the operating<br>
oil tank 36.<br>
Indicated at 37 is a counterweight which is located at the<br>
rear end of the revolving frame 4, on the rear side of the engine<br>
14. as a weight balance against the working mechanism 38 which will<br>
be described hereinafter. The counterweight 37 is mounted on the<br>
counterweight mount portions 6B and 7B on the left and right vertical<br>
plates 6 and 7 of the revolving frame 4 in such a way as to partition<br>
off a right rear side of the housing cover 21.<br>
24<br><br>
Indicated at 38 is a working mechanism which is mounted on<br>
a front portion of the revolving frame 4, on the right side of the<br>
cab 35, to carry out a ground digging or working operation. Base<br>
end of the working mechanism 38 is pivotally mounted on the brackets<br>
6A and 7A of the left and right vertical plates 6 and 7 of the<br>
revolving frame 4 to turn the fore end of the lifting boom up and<br>
down relative to the revolving frame 4.<br>
Being arranged in the manner as described above, the hydraulic<br>
excavator 1 according to the present embodiment can be driven to<br>
a working site by the vehicular lower structure 2 and carry out<br>
a ground digging operation by means of the working mechanism 38<br>
on the upper revolving structure 3 which is put in swinging<br>
movements.<br>
In the case of the present embodiment, the stopper 28 which<br>
is provided on the front partition panel 24 makes it possible to<br>
attach the front partition panel 24 to the seat screw member 20<br>
on the revolving frame 4 (left side frame 11) in an efficient and<br>
facilitated manner. While referring to Figs. 14 to 16, an<br>
explanation for the attachment operation of the front partition<br>
panel 24 will now be given.<br>
In the first place, the front partition panel 24 is lowered<br>
toward the left side frame 11 as shown in Fig. 14, and then the<br>
stopper 28 of the front partition panel 24 is put on the upper end<br>
25<br><br>
of the seat screw member 20 which is provided on the left side frame<br>
11 as shown in Fig. 15. As explained hereinbefore, the height of<br>
the lower side of the stopper 28 from the lower end portion 24F<br>
of the front partition panel 24 is set at a value A which is slightly<br>
smaller than a height B of the upper end portion 20C of the seat<br>
screw member 20 from the upper surface 11A of the left side frame<br>
11.<br>
Therefore, a gap space G is left between the lower end portion<br>
24F of the front partition panel 24 and the upper surface 11A of<br>
the left side frame 11, permitting the front partition panel 24<br>
to stay in a floated state above the left side frame 11. In this<br>
state, the lower end portion 24F of the front partition panel 24<br>
is prevented from inadvertently coming into contact with the upper<br>
surface 11A of the left side frame 11, for protection of the<br>
anti-corrosion sealing material 34 which is applied around joint<br>
portions of the seat screw members 20 with the upper surface 11A<br>
of the left side frame 11.<br>
Further, while letting the stopper 28 rest on the upper end<br>
portion 20C of the seat screw member 20 as shown in Fig. 15, the<br>
bolt through hole 26 in the front partition panel 24 can be almost<br>
brought into aligned position relative to the nut 20B of the seat<br>
screw member 20 on the left side frame 11. That is to say, at the<br>
time of fixing the front partition panel 24 on the left side frame<br>
26<br><br>
11 of the revolving frame 4 by way of the seat screw members 20,<br>
a bolt 27 which is placed in a bolt through hole 26 can be easily<br>
threaded into a nut 20B of a seat screw member 20 simply by lifting<br>
the front partition panel 24 slightly in an upward direction, as<br>
shown in Fig. 16.<br>
After fixing the front partition panel 24 on the revolving<br>
frame 4, the other end of each hinge member 30 is fixed to the left<br>
bent edge portion 24D of the front partition panel 24 by the use<br>
of bolts 31 as shown in Fig. 10. By so doing, the left front door<br>
29 is pivotally attached to the front partition panel 24 by means<br>
of the respective hinge members 30. Thus, the left front door 29<br>
can be swung between the closed position of Fig. 12 and the open<br>
position of Fig. 13 to open and close the utility room 23 which<br>
is formed between the machine room 22 and the cab 35.<br>
In this instance, when the left front door 29 is swung open<br>
to the position shown in Fig. 13, the other end 32B of the stay<br>
32 which is retained in the stay holder 29C on the left front door<br>
29 is placed in the stay through hole 28A which is provided in the<br>
stopper 28 on the side of the front partition panel 24. By so doing,<br>
the other end 32B of the stay 32 is hooked in the stay through hole<br>
28A in the stopper 28 to keep the left front door 29 in the open<br>
position.<br>
In this manner, the left front door 29 can be locked in the<br>
27<br><br>
open position by hooking the other end 32B of the stay 32 in the<br>
stopper 28 which is provided on the front partition panel 24. Thus,<br>
as compared with a case where an additional member is employed simply<br>
for hooking the other end 32B of the stay 32, it becomes possible<br>
to cut the number of parts and the production cost.<br>
Thus, according to the present embodiment, the stopper 28<br>
which is provided on the front partition panel 24 can be put on<br>
the upper end portion 20C of the seat screw member 20 on the left<br>
side frame 11 to hold the lower end portion 24P of the front partition<br>
panel 24 in a floated state above the upper surface 11A of the left<br>
side frame 11 to facilitate alignment of the bolt through holes<br>
26 in the front partition panel 24 with the nuts 20B of the seat<br>
screw members 20. Thus, despite the heavy weight, the front<br>
partition panel 24 can be fixed to the seat screw members 20 easily<br>
in an efficient manner.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 15, an anti-corrosive sealing<br>
material 34 is applied around joint portions of the upper surface<br>
11A of the left side frame 11 and the seat screw members 20. However,<br>
since the lower end portion 24F of the front partition panel 24<br>
can be held in a floated state above the upper surface 11A of the<br>
left side frame 11 by the stopper 28 as mentioned above, there is<br>
no possibility of the sealing material 34 being damaged by contact<br>
with the lower end portion 24F of the front partition panel 24 to<br>
28<br><br>
the upper surface 11A of the left side frame 11. Thus, through<br>
protection of the sealing material 34 which is applied around joint<br>
portions of the upper surface 11A of the left side frame 11 and<br>
the seat screw members 20, the exterior of the hydraulic excavator<br>
1 can be kept in good conditions.<br>
Further, since the stopper 28 is welded in position in a corner<br>
portion where the upright plate portion 24A of the front partition<br>
panel 24 meets the left bent edge portion 24D, it also contributes<br>
to enhance the rigidity of the front partition panel 24.<br>
Furthermore, the stopper 28 is provided with the stay through<br>
hole 28A in its projected end portion, so that, when the left front<br>
door 29 which is attached to the front partition panel 24 is swung<br>
open, the other end 32B of the stay 32 on the left front door 29<br>
can be placed in the stay through hole 28A as shown in Fig. 13 to<br>
lock the left front door 29 in the open position through the stopper<br>
28. That is to say, the stopper 28 serves also as a hooking member<br>
for anchoring the other end 32B of the stay 32, making it possible<br>
to reduce the number of parts as compared with a case where an<br>
additional part is required exclusively for hooking the other end<br>
32B of the stay 32.<br>
Further, in the above-described embodiment, by way of example,<br>
the front partition panel 24 as a cover, which is partitioned off<br>
the left front side of the housing cover 21, is attached to the<br>
29<br><br>
seat screw member 20. However, needless to say, the present<br>
invention is not limited to the particular example shown. For<br>
example, the invention can be similarly applied to other panels<br>
of the housing cover 21. In case a right front partition panel is<br>
employed to partition off a right front side of the housing cover<br>
21 in place of the operating oil tank 36, for example, the invention<br>
can be similarly applied to such a right front partition panel.<br>
Further, in a case where a rear partition panel is provided to<br>
partition off the rear side of the housing cover 21 in place of<br>
the counterweight 37, the invention can also be applied to such<br>
a rear partition panel. Furthermore, in a case where a center<br>
partition panel is located in a center portion of the housing cover<br>
21 in place of the support frame structure 17 of the heat exchanger<br>
16, the invention is also applicable to such a center partition<br>
panel.<br>
Moreover, in the above-described embodiment, by way of<br>
example the other end 32B of the stay 32 is hooked in the stay through<br>
hole 28A which is bored in a projected end portion of the stopper<br>
28. However, the present invention is not limited to this<br>
particular example. For example, a hook may be provided on the<br>
stopper to catch the other end 32B of the stay 32.<br>
Further, in the above-described embodiment, the invention<br>
is applied to a hydraulic excavator 1, a typical example of<br>
30<br><br>
construction machine. However, the present invention is similarly<br>
applicable to other construction machines including hydraulic<br>
cranes, wheel loaders, bulldozers etc.<br>
