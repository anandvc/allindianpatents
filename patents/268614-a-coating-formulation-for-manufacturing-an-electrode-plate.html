				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COATING LIQUID FOR MANUFACTURING ELECTRODE PLATE,<br>
UNDERCOATING AGENT, AND USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
[ooo1]	This invention relates to a coating formulation<br>
for manufacturing an electrode plate for a nonaqueous<br>
electrolyte secondary battery (which may hereinafter<br>
be called simply "battery") represented, for example,<br>
by a lithium ion secondary battery or an electrode plate<br>
for an electric double layer capacitor (which may<br>
hereinafter be called simply "capacitor"), an<br>
undercoating layer, the electrode plate, its<br>
manufacturing process, the battery, and the capacitor.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]	In recent years, increasing size and weight<br>
reductions are under way in electronic equipment and<br>
communication equipment, leading to a stronger demand<br>
for size and weight reductions on secondary batteries<br>
to be employed as drive power supplies in them. To meet<br>
these demands, batteries represented by lithium ion<br>
secondary batteries having high energy density and high<br>
voltage have been proposed as replacements for<br>
conventional alkaline batteries.<br><br>
[0003]	Concerning electrode plates which considerably<br>
affect the performance of secondary batteries, on the<br>
other hand, it has been proposed to form them into thinner<br>
films of larger areas with a view to providing the<br>
secondary batteries with longer charge-discharge cycle<br>
life and higher energy density. As disclosed, for<br>
example, in Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2, etc.,<br>
there have been disclosed positive electrode plates each<br>
obtained by adding a dispersion or solution of a<br>
conductive aid and a binder in a suitable moistening<br>
agent (solvent) to powder of a positive-electrode active<br>
material such as a metal oxide, sulfide, halide or the<br>
like to prepare a paste-like active material coating<br>
formulation, providing a collector made of a metal foil<br>
as a substrate, and then applying the coating formulation<br>
onto the substrate to form a coating layer (active<br>
material layer).<br>
[0004]	Further, capacitors each of which makes use of an<br>
electric double layer formed at an interface between<br>
a polarizable electrode plate and an electrolyte are<br>
used as memory backup power supplies, and their<br>
application to those requiring a large capacity such<br>
as power supplies for electric cars is now attracting<br>
attention. For a large capacity, it is required to<br>
achieve both a high capacitance and a low internal<br>
resistance. Electrode plates for capacitors are<br><br>
generally manufactured by applying a coating<br>
formulation, which is a mixture of a binder, an active<br>
material, a conductivity-imparting agent and the like,<br>
onto collectors and then drying the coating formulation<br>
like the above-described negative electrode plates for<br>
batteries.<br>
[0005]	As the binder for use in the above-described<br>
coating formulation for the battery or capacitor<br>
electrode plate, a fluorinated resin such as<br>
polyfluorinated vinylidene or a silicone-acrylic<br>
copolymer is used, for example. Negative electrode<br>
plates (batteries) and polarizable electrode plates<br>
(capacitors) are each obtained by adding a solution of<br>
a binder in a suitable moistening agent (solvent) to<br>
an active material such as a carbonaceous material to<br>
prepare a paste-like active material coating<br>
formulation and then applying the coating formulation<br>
onto a collector. In the above-described coated<br>
electrode plates, the binder employed to prepare the<br>
active material coating formulation is required to be<br>
electrochemically stable to a nonaqueous electrolyte<br>
and to be free from dissolution into the electrolyte<br>
of the batteries or capacitors, to remain free from<br>
swelling by the electrolyte, and further to be soluble<br>
in a solvent to permit the coating.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-63-010456<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0006]	In the battery or capacitor electrode plate<br>
obtained by applying the above-described coating<br>
formulation onto the collector, the active material<br>
layer (coating layer) formed by the coating and drying<br>
is accompanied by problems such that its adhesion to<br>
the collector and its flexibility are insufficient, its<br>
contact resistance to the collector is high, and peeling,<br>
flaking, cracking and/or the like of the active material<br>
layer takes place during assembly steps of the battery<br>
or capacitor or upon charging and discharging the same.<br>
[0007]	Objects of the present invention are, therefore,<br>
to provide a coating formulation for manufacturing an<br>
electrode plate of a battery or a polarizable electrode<br>
plate of a capacitor, in which an active material layer<br>
has excellent adhesion to a collector and is also equipped<br>
with improved contact resistance to the collector, an<br>
undercoating formulation, the electrode plate and its<br>
manufacturing process, the battery, and the capacitor.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0008]	It is to be noted that positive-electrode active<br>
materials such as lithium cobaltate, negative-electrode<br><br>
active materials such as graphite and electrode active<br>
materials such as activated carbon in batteries and<br>
electric double layer capacitors may be all called<br>
"active materials" in the present invention.<br>
The above-described objects can be achieved by the<br>
present invention to be described hereinafter.<br>
Described specifically, the present invention provides<br>
a coating formulation for manufacturing an electrode<br>
plate (which may hereinafter be called simply "a coating<br>
formulation"), comprising: a solution of a<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan and an organic acid and/or a<br>
derivative thereof in an aprotic polar solvent (which<br>
may hereinafter be called simply "a<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosansolution") , and an active material<br>
added to and kneaded with the solution.<br>
[0009]	In the above-described coating formulation, the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan may preferably be at least one<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan selected from<br>
hydroxyethylchitosan, hydroxypropylchitosan,<br>
hydroxybutylchitosan and glycerylated chitosan; the<br>

vinylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, and<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide; the organic acid may preferably be<br>
a polybasic acid, especially preferably pyromellitic<br>
acid and/or trimellitic acid; and the organic acid and/or<br>
the derivative thereofmaypreferablybeusedinan amount<br>
of from 20 to 300 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight<br>
of the hydroxyalkylchitosan. The above coating<br>
formulation is useful for the manufacture of a battery<br>
electrode plate or a capacitor electrode plate.<br>
[0010]	The present invention also provides an electrode<br>
plate for abatteryor an electrode plate for a capacitor,<br>
comprising: a collector, and an active material layer<br>
formed with an active material and a binder on a surface<br>
of the collector, wherein the binder is a<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan crosslinked with a polybasicacid.<br>
In the above-described electrode plate, the polybasic<br>
acid may preferably be pyromellitic acid and/or<br>
trimellitic acid; and the polybasic acid and/or a<br>
derivative thereof may preferably be used in an amount<br>
of from 20 to 300 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight<br>
of the hydroxyalkylchitosan.<br>
[0011]	The present invention also provides a<br>
manufacturing pro cess of an elect rode pi ate for a battery<br>
or capacitor, comprising: applying a coating<br>
formulation for an electrode on a surface of a collector<br><br>
and then drying and heating the coating formulation to<br>
form an active material layer, wherein the coating<br>
formulation is the above-described coating formulation<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[0012]	in the above-described manufacturing process, the<br>
heating may preferably be conducted at 120 to 250°C for<br>
1 second to 10 minutes; the collector may preferably<br>

or the collector may preferably be a copper foil, the<br>

comprising: an undercoat layer formed with the<br>
undercoating formulation, and an active material layer<br>
(conductive layer) formed on the undercoat layer; and<br><br>
a battery or capacitor, comprising the electrode plate.<br>
Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
[0014]	According to the present invention, the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan, which has been crosslinked by<br>
forming the active material layer while using the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan solution as a binder for the active<br>
material layer and heating the layer to crosslink the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan with the organic acid and/or the<br>
derivative thereof, does not dissolve in or swell with<br>
an electrolyte, the active material layer is excellent<br>
in the adhesion to the collector and is pronouncedly<br>
reduced in the contact resistance to the collector, and<br>
the active material layer has good flexibility. It is,<br>
therefore, possible to obtain an electrode plate,<br>
battery and capacitor, which do not develop peeling,<br>
flaking, cracking or the like of the active material<br>
layer in assembly steps of the battery or capacitor or<br>
upon charging and discharging the battery or capacitor.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0015]	The present invention will next be described in<br>
further detail based on preferred embodiments.<br>
[Coating formulation]<br>
The coating formulation according to the present<br>
invention is characterized by the use of the solution,<br><br>
which contains the hydroxyalkylchitosan and the organic<br>
acid and/or the derivative thereof, as a binder for the<br>
active material layers in the battery and capacitor<br>
electrode plates.<br>
[0016]	Ahydroxyalkylchitosan, a derivative of chitosan,<br>
is a water-soluble substance, and is conventionally<br>
known to be useful in dissolving a mixture of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan and an organic acid and/or a<br>
derivative thereof in an aqueous medium and forming a<br>
hydrophilic coating on a surface of an aluminum substrate<br>
or the like (JP-A-2002-10S241).<br>
However, when an aqueous solution of such a<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan was used as a binder in a coating<br>
formulation for manufacturing an electrode plate, the<br>
aqueous solution was low in the compatibility with an<br>
active material and a conductive aid so that an active<br>
layer had low adhesion to a collector as a substrate,<br>
thereby failing to solve the problems of the conventional<br>
art. Moreover, it was difficult to completely eliminate<br>
water from the active material layer formed from the<br>
coating formulation, thereby making it difficult to form<br>
a fully-satisfactory active material layer.<br>
[0017]	The present inventors have conducted an<br>
investigation to obtain a solution of a<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan in an organic solvent, and as a<br>
result, have found that the addition of the<br><br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan together with an organic acid<br>
and/or a derivative thereof to a specific organic solvent<br>
can render the hydroxyalkylchitosan soluble in the<br>
organic solvent. It has also been found that, when an<br>
active material layer is formed by using a solution of<br>
the hydroxyalkylchitosan in the organic solvent as a<br>
binder for the active material layer, the organic acid<br>
and/or the derivative thereof acts as a crosslinking<br>
agent for the hydroxyalkylchitosan upon heating and<br>
drying, the hydroxyalkylchitosan becomes no longer<br>
soluble in or swellable with an electrolyte, and<br>
therefore, an active material layer having excellent<br>
adhesion to a collector can be formed.<br>
[0018]	The solution of the hydroxyalkylchitosan, which<br>
is useful in the present invention, is characterized<br>
by the inclusion of the hydroxyalkylchitosan and the<br>
organic acid and/or the derivative thereof in the aprotic<br>
polar solvent.<br>
The hydroxyalkylchitosan for use in the present<br>
invention preferably has a structure that like<br>
hydroxyethylchitosan, hydroxypropylchitosan,<br>
hydroxybutylchitosan or glycerylated chitosan, the<br>
corresponding alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol is<br>
added to the amino groups of chitosan, and can be produced<br>
preferably by reacting chitosan with the corresponding<br>
alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol. It is, however, to<br><br>
be noted that the hydroxyalkylchitosan for use in the<br>
present invention is not limited to such<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosans and hydroxyalkylchitosans<br>
produced by other processes can also be used likewise.<br>
It is also to be noted that plural alkylene oxides and<br>
oxiranemethanol may be used either singly or in<br>
combination.<br>
[0019]	In the present invention, the term<br>
"hydroxyalkylchitosan" is used with a meaning that<br>
embraces therein "glycerylated chitosan". However,<br>
"hydroxyalkylchitosan" and "glycerylated chitosan" may<br>
hereinafter be distinguished from each other by<br>
referring the reaction product of chitosan and an<br>
alkylene oxide as "a hydroxyalkylchitosan" and the<br>
reaction product of chitosan and oxiranemethanol as<br>
"glycerylated chitosan".<br>
[0020]	The hydroxyalkylchitosan for use in the present<br>
invention can be produced by dispersing chitosan in<br>
a water-containing alcohol medium such as, for<br>
example, water-containing isopropyl alcohol or in<br>
water under stirring, adjusting the thus-obtained<br>
dispersion alkaline, for example, with sodium<br>
hydroxide or the like, adding the alkylene oxide,<br>
and then heating the resultant mixture with stirring.<br>
On the other hand, the glycerylated chitosan for use<br>
in the present invention can be produced by dispersing<br><br>
chitosan beforehand, for example, in<br>
water-containing isopropyl alcohol under stirring,<br>
adding oxiranemethanol to the dispersion, and then<br>
heating the resultant mixture with stirring<br>
[0021]	From the standpoint of the solubility of such<br>
a hydroxyalkylchitosan in an aprotic polar solvent,<br>
the degree of addition of a corresponding alkylene<br>
oxide or oxiranemethanol to chitosan [the degree of<br>
hydroxyalkylation (no unit)] may preferably be 0.2<br>
(mole) or greater but 4 (moles) or less per pyranose<br>
ring (mole of pyranose). To obtain such a<br>
hydroxyalkylation degree, it is desired, upon<br>
production of the hydroxyalkylchitosan, to add and<br>
react 0.3 (mole) or greater but 10 (moles) or less<br>
of the alkylene oxide or oxiranemethanol per pyranose<br>
ring (mole pyranose) that makes up chitosan. A<br>
hydroxylation degree lower than 0.2 is insufficient<br>
from the standpoint of the solubility of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan in the aprotic polar solvent.<br>
Even when the hydroxylat ion degree exceeds 4, on the<br>
other hand, the solubility of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan in the aprotic polar solvent<br>
does not change so that the setting of the<br>
hydroxyalkylation degree of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan beyond 4 is uneconomical.<br>
[0022]	In the present invention, no particular<br><br>
limitation is imposed on the source of chitosan as<br>
a raw material for the hydroxyalkylchitosan and the<br>
production process of the hydroxyalkylchitosan, and<br>
chitosan products which have been industrially<br>
manufactured to date are all usable. Further, no<br>
particular limitation is imposed either on the<br>
deacetylation degree or polymerization degree of<br>
chitosan. Preferably, however, the deacetylation<br>
degree of chitosan may be 30% or higher, with 70%<br>
to 100% being more preferred and 80% to 100% being<br>
still more preferred.<br>
[0023]	Preferred as chitosan can be such chitosan that<br>
as an aqueous solution containing the chitosan at<br>
1 wt% and acetic acid at 1 wt%, the viscosity of the<br>
aqueous solution (20°C) ranges from 1 mPa-s to 10,000<br>
mPa-s. A deacetylat ion degree of lower than 30% is<br>
insufficient from the standpoint of the solubility<br>
of a hydroxyalkylchitosan, which is available from<br>
the reaction with the corresponding alkylene oxide<br>
or oxiranemethanol, in the aprotic polar solvent.<br>
If the above-described viscosity (2 0°C) is lower than<br>
1 mPa-s, the active material layer to be formed using<br>
the hydroxyalkylchitosan will be insufficient in<br>
strength. If the above-described viscosity (20°C)<br>
is higher than 10,000 mPa-s, on the other hand, a<br>
solution of the resulting hydroxyalkylchitosan will<br><br>
have an excessively high viscosity (20°C) so that<br>
the concentration of the hydroxyalkylchitosan will<br>
have to be limited at a very low level. Therefore,<br>
viscosities outside the above-described range are<br>
not preferred.<br>
[0024]	Chitosan, which is employed as a raw material<br>
for the hydroxyal kylchi tosan to be used in the present<br>
invention, may more preferably be one having a<br>
deacetylation degree of from 80% to 100% and, as an<br>
aqueous solution containing 1 wt% of the chitosan<br>
and 1 wt% of acetic acid, giving a viscosity (20°C)<br>
of from 3 mPa-s to 100 mPa-s from the standpoints of<br>
the solubility of the resulting<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan and the strength of the<br>
resulting coating.<br>
[0025]	As the organic acid or its derivative for use<br>
in the present invention, those known to date can<br>
each be used, including organic acids such as<br>
salicylic acid, pyromellitic acid, citric acid,<br>
trimelliticacid, malic acid, pyrrolidonecarboxylic<br>
acid, polymaleic acid, phthalic acid, succinic acid<br>
and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid.<br>
Preferred can be polybasic acids, their acid<br>
anhydrides, and salts of some or all of the carboxyl<br>
groups of such polybasic acids, notably their<br>
ammonium salts and amine salts and alkyl esters,<br><br>
amides, imides, amide-imides and the like of some<br>
or all of the carboxyl groups of such polybasic acids,<br>
and derivatives obtained by modifying at least ones<br>
of carboxyl groups of these compounds with<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide<br>
or a derivative thereof. Preferred as derivatives<br>
of these polybasic acids are compounds which<br>
regenerate polybasic acids upon heating of active<br>
material layers to be formed subsequently.<br>
[0026]	From the aspects of the solubility of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan in the organic solvent and the<br>
crosslinkability of the hydroxyalkylchitosan,<br>
pyromellitic acid and trimellitic acid, each of which<br>
is a trivalent or higher aromatic polycarboxylic acid,<br>
and their acid anhydrides are preferred. In the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan solution in the present<br>
invention, the organic acid and/or its derivative<br>
may be used preferably in an amount of from 20 to<br>
300 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan. Use of the organic acid<br>
and/or its derivative in an amount of smaller than<br>
20 parts by weight results in a crosslinked<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan having a lower crosslink<br>
density, so that the resulting active material layer<br>
is insufficient in the adhesion to the collector and<br>
also in the insolubility, non-swellability and<br><br>
electrochemical stability of the crosslinked<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan to the electrolyte. On the<br>
other hand, use of the organic acid and/or its<br>
derivative in an amount of greater than 300 parts<br>
by weight leads to the format ion of an active material<br>
layer with reduced flexibility, and moreover, is<br>
uneconomical.<br>
[0027]	As the aprotic polar solvent for use in the<br>
present invention, those known to date can each be<br>
used. Examples include ethers (diethyl ether,<br>
diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dioxane,<br>
etc.), carbonates (ethylene carbonate, ethyl methyl<br>
carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate,<br>
propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, etc.),<br>
amides (formamide, N-methylformamide,<br>
N-ethylformamide, N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-diethylformamide, acetamide,<br>
N-methylacetamide, N-ethylacetamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
vinylpyrrolidone, piperidone, N-methylpiperidone ,<br>
N-ethylpiperidone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide,<br>
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone,<br>
methyloxazolidinone, ethyloxazolidinone, etc.),<br>
sulfoxides (dimethyl sulfoxide, etc.) , and sulfones<br>
(tetramethylene sulfone, etc.). Among these,<br><br>
N,N-dimethyIformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
vinylpyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone<br>
and dimethyl sulfoxide are more preferred. These<br>
aprotic polar solvents may be used either singly or<br>
in combination.<br>
[0028]	As the organic acid and/or its derivative and<br>
aprotic polar solvent for use in the present invention,<br>
general commercial products can be used as they are,<br>
or they may be used after purification as needed.<br>
Concerning the hydroxyalkylchitosan, one produced<br>
by the above-described process may be used with the<br>
reaction solvent, byproducts and/or the like still<br>
contained therein, or may be used after purification.<br>
[0029]	As the order of addition of the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan and the organic acid and/or its<br>
derivative to the aprotic polar solvent upon their<br>
dissolution in the solvent to prepare the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan solution for use in the present<br>
invention, either the hydroxyalkylchitosan or the<br>
organic acid and/or its derivative may be added first<br>
or they may be added at the same time. As their<br>
dissolution method, stirring may be conducted with<br>
heating as needed although stirring at room<br>
temperature is sufficient.<br>
[0030]	The concentration of the hydroxyalkylchitosan<br><br>
in the hydroxyalkylchitosan solution for use in the<br>
present invention may range preferably from 1 to 40<br>
wt%, more preferably from 5 to 10 wt% from the<br>
viewpoints of coating applicability, transport cost<br>
and the like. A concentration lower than 1 wt% makes<br>
it difficult to obtain a stable active material layer,<br>
while a concentration higher than 40 wt% makes it<br>
hard to obtain a homogeneous solution.<br>
[0031] [Application to battery electrode plate and battery]<br>
As the positive-electrode active material among<br>
the active materials usable in the coating formulation<br>
according to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
use, for example, one or a combination of plural of<br>
lithium oxides such as LiCoC&gt;2, LiNi02 and LiMn204 and<br>
chalcogen compounds such as TiS2, Mn02, Mo03 and V205.<br>
As the negative-electrode active material, on the other<br>
hand, metal lithium, a lithium alloy, a carbonaceous<br>
material such as graphite, carbon black or acetylene<br>
black, or a material that intercalates lithium ions can<br>
be used preferably.<br>
[0032]	In the present invention, it is preferred to<br>
use a conductive aid in combination with the<br>
above-described active material. Usable examples<br>
of the conductive aid include acetylene black,<br>
Ketjenblack and other carbonaceous conductive aids,<br>
with the use of acetylene black being particularly<br><br>
preferred.<br>
[0033]	The coating formulation according to the<br>
present invention can be obtained by adding the active<br>
material and, if necessary, the conductive aid to<br>
the solution of the hydroxyalkylchitosan and the<br>
organic acid and/or its derivative in the organic<br>
solvent and then kneading the resultant mixture.<br>
The proportions of the respective components in the<br>
coating formulation may preferably be 1 to 10 parts<br>
by weight of the hydroxyalkylchitosan, 0 . 5 to 30 parts<br>
by weight of the organic acid and/or its derivative,<br>
and 1 to 15 parts by weight of the conductive aid<br>
(when used) , when the active material is assumed to<br>
amount to 100 parts by weight. Further, the solid<br>
content of the coating formulation may preferably<br>
range from 10 to 80 wt% .<br>
[0034]	If the hydroxyalkylchitosan is used in an amount<br>
smaller than 1 parts by weight in the foregoing, the resulting<br>
active material layer may be provided with insufficient<br>
strength and insufficient adhesion to the collector. If<br>
the hydroxyalkylchitosan is used in an amount greater than<br>
10 parts by weight, on the other hand, the resulting active<br>
material layer may be provided with reduced electrical<br>
conductivity.<br>
[0035]	If the organic acid and/or its derivative is<br>
used in an amount smaller than 0.5 parts by weight,<br><br>
the resulting active material layer may be provided<br>
with insufficient strength, insufficient adhesion<br>
to the collector, and insufficient electrochemical<br>
stability to the electrolyte. If the organic acid<br>
and/or its derivative is used in an amount greater<br>
than 30 wt%, on the other hand, the resulting active<br>
material layer may be provided with reduced<br>
flexibility.<br>
[0036]	When the conductive aid is used although its<br>
use is not essential, the use of the conductive aid<br>
in an amount smaller than 1 parts by weight may provide<br>
the resulting active material layer with<br>
insufficient electrical conductivity. If the<br>
conductive aid is used in an amount greater than 15<br>
parts by weight, on the other hand, the remaining<br>
components may become deficient so that the resulting<br>
active material layer may be provided with reduced<br>
performance.<br>
[0037]	The coating formulation according to the<br>
present invention may further contain optional<br>
components other than the above-described<br>
components, for example, other crosslinking agents<br>
and the like.	Examples of such other crosslinking<br>
agents include epoxy compounds such as ethylene<br>
glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol<br>
diglycidyl ether and glycerol polyglycidyl ether;<br><br>
isocyanate compounds such as toluylene diisocyanate,<br>
xylylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate<br>
and phenyl diisocyanate, and blocked isocyanate<br>
compounds formed by blocking such isocyanate<br>
compounds with blocking agents such as phenols,<br>
alcohols, active methylene compounds, mercaptans,<br>
acid-amides, imides, amines, imidazoles, ureas,<br>
carbamic acids, imines, oximes or sulfites; aldehyde<br>
compounds such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, and<br>
dialdehyde starch; (meth)acrylate compounds such as<br>
polyethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate and hexanediol diacrylates; methylol<br>
compounds such as methylolmelamine and dimethylol<br>
urea; organic acid metal salts such as zirconyl<br>
acetate, zirconyl carbonate and titanium lactate;<br>
metal alkoxide compounds such as aluminum<br>
trimethoxide, aluminum tributoxide, titanium<br>
tetraethoxide, titanium tetrabutoxide, zirconium<br>
tetrabutoxide, aluminum dipropoxide<br>
acethylacetonate, titanium dimethoxide<br>
bis (acetylacetonate) and titanium dibutoxide<br>
bis(ethylacetoacetate); carbodiimide compounds;<br>
and the like. The use of such a crosslinking agent<br>
is not essential. When to be employed, however, the<br>
amount of the crosslinking agent may suitably range<br>
from 0 . 1 to 200 wt% based on the hydroxyalkylchitosan.<br><br>
[0038]	A description will be made about a specific<br>
process for the preparation of the coating<br>
formulation for use in the present invention.<br>
Firstly, a powdery active material, which is selected<br>
as desired from materials such as those mentioned<br>
above, and if necessary, a powdery conductive aid<br>
are added to the solution of the hydroxyalkylchitosan<br>
and the organic acid and/or its derivative in the<br>
organic solvent such that they are contained in the<br>
above-described proportions. Using a<br>
conventionally-known disperser such as a<br>
homogenizer, ball mill, sand mill or roll mill or<br>
a conventionally-known kneader such as a planetary<br>
mixer, the resultant mixture is mixed and dispersed<br>
to prepare the coating formulation according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0039]	The manufacturing process of the electrode<br>
plate according to the present invention is<br>
characterized by the use of the above-described<br>
coating formulation according to the present<br>
invention. Examples of the collector for use in the<br>
manufacture of the electrode plate include, as<br>
positive electrode collectors, aluminum, tantalum,<br>
niobium, titanium, hafnium, zirconium, zinc,<br>
tungsten, bismuth and antimony; and as negative<br>
electrode collectors, metal foils such as a copper<br><br>
foil. As the positive electrode collector, aluminum<br>
is preferred for its excellent corrosion resistance<br>
to the electrolyte, its light weight, and its easy<br>
machine workability. As the thickness of the metal<br>
foil, a metal foil of from 10 to 30 μm. or so can be<br>
used. These collectors may be treated beforehand<br>
at surfaces thereof with a coupling agent such as<br>
a silane-based, titanate-based or aluminum-based<br>
coupling agent.<br>
[0040]	The electrode plate can be obtained by applying<br>
the coating formulation onto the surface of the<br>
collector to a dry thickness in a range of from 10<br>
to 200 nm, preferably in a range of from 50 to 180<br>
(im by using one of various coating methods such as<br>
gravure coating, gravure reverse coating, roll<br>
coating, Meyer bar coating, blade coating, knife<br>
coating, air knife coating, comma coating, slot die<br>
coating, slide die coating or dip coating, and then<br>
drying the thus-applied coating formulation under<br>
heat.<br>
[0041]	Upon drying under heat, the coating can be<br>
heated preferably at 100°C or higher for 1 second<br>
or longer, more preferably at 120 to 250°C for 1 second<br>
to 10 minutes so that the hydroxyalkylchitosan<br>
(binder) can be fully crosslinked to provide the<br>
resulting active material layer with improved<br><br>
adhesion to the collector and also to provide the<br>
binder with improved electrochemical stability to<br>
the electrolyte. Heat treatment conditions of lower<br>
than 100°C or shorter than 1 second may fail to provide<br>
the active material layer with sufficient adhesion<br>
to the collector and also to provide the binder with<br>
satisfactory electrochemical stability to the<br>
electrolyte.<br>
[ 004 2 ]	To improve the uniformity of the active material<br>
layer formed by conducting the coating and heat<br>
treatment as described above, it is also preferred<br>
to form the electrode plate according to the present<br>
invention by applying pressing treatment to the<br>
active material layer while using metal rolls,<br>
heatingrolls, a sheet press or the like . Aspressing<br>
conditions for the pressing treatment, a press<br>
pressure of lower than 500 kgf/cm2 can hardly provide<br>
the active material layer with uniformity, while a<br>
press pressure of higher than 7,500 kgf/cm2 breaks<br>
the electrode plate itself including the collector.<br>
As the pressing conditions, a range of from 500 to<br>
7,500 kgf/cm2 is therefore preferred.<br>
[004 3]	The electrode plate obtained as described above<br>
has, on the surface of the collector, the active<br>
material layer formed of the active material and the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan (binder) crosslinked by the<br><br>
organic acid, especially the polybasic acid, and the<br>
active material layer has such properties as<br>
described above.<br>
[0044]	When manufacturing a nonaqueous electrolyte<br>
secondary battery, for example, a lithium-based<br>
secondary battery by using the positive electrode<br>
plate and negative electrode plate of the present<br>
invention produced as described above, a nonaqueous<br>
electrolyte with a lithium salt dissolved as a solute<br>
in an organic solvent is used as an electrolyte.<br>
Usable examples of the lithium salt as the solute<br>
that forms the nonaqueous electrolyte include<br>
inorganic lithium salts such as LiC104, LiBF4, LiPF6,<br>
LiAsF6, LiC1 and LiBr; and organic lithium salts such<br>
as LiB(C6H5) 4, LiN(S02CF3 ) 2 , LiC(S02CF3 ) 3 , LiOS02CF3,<br>
LiOS02C2F5, LiOS02C3F7, LiOS02C4F9, LiOS02C5F11,<br>
LiOS02C6F13 and LiOS02C7F15.<br>
[0045]	As the organic solvent employed upon formation<br>
of the nonaqueous electrolyte, a cyclic ester, a<br>
linear ester, a cyclic ether, a linear ether or the<br>
like can be mentioned. Illustrative of the cyclic<br>
ester are ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate,<br>
butylene carbonate, y-butyrolactone, vinylene<br>
carbonate, 2-methy1-y-butyrolactone,<br>
acetyl-y-butyrolactone, and y-valerolactone.<br>
[0046]	Illustrative of the linear ester are dimethyl<br><br>
carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate,<br>
dipropyl carbonate, methyl ethyl carbonate, methyl<br>
butyl carbonate, methyl propyl carbonate, ethyl<br>
butyl carbonate, ethyl propyl carbonate, butyl<br>
propyl carbonate, alkyl propionates, dialkyl<br>
malonates, and alkyl acetates.<br>
[0047]	Illustrative of the cyclic ether are<br>
tetrahydrofuran, alkyltetrahydrofurans,<br>
dialkylalkyltetrahydrofurans,<br>
alkoxytetrahydrofurans, dialkoxytetrahydrofurans,<br>
1,3-dioxolane, alkyl-1,3-dioxolanes, and<br>
1,4-dioxolane. Illustrative of the linear ether are<br>
1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, diethyl<br>
ether, ethylene glycol dialkyl ethers, diethylene<br>
glycol dialkyl ethers, triethylene glycol dialkyl<br>
ethers, and tet raethylene glycol dial kyl ethers . It<br>
is to be noted that the remaining construction of<br>
the battery is similar to that in the conventional<br>
art.<br>
[0048] [Application to capacitor electrode plate and<br>
capacitor]<br>
A description will hereinafter be made of a case<br>
that the coating formulation according to the present<br>
invention is applied to the manufacture of a capacitor<br>
electrode plate and a capacitor. The coating<br>
formulation for the capacitor electrode plate<br><br>
contains the above-described hydroxyalkylchitosan<br>
solution and the electrode active material, and if<br>
necessary, also contains a conductivity-imparting<br>
agent.<br>
[0049]	The electrode active material for use in the<br>
present invention can be a carbonaceous material<br>
having a specific surface are of preferably 30 m2/g<br>
or greater, more preferably from 500 to 5,000 m /g,<br>
still more preferably from 1,000 to 3,000 m2/g, and<br>
powder or fibers such as activated carbon, polyacene,<br>
carbon whiskers or graphite can be used. The<br>
electrode active material may preferably be<br>
activated carbon. As the activated carbon,<br>
phenol-based, rayon-based, acrylic, pitch-based or<br>
coconut shell activated carbon can be used. It is<br>
also possible to use, as the electrode active material,<br>
nonporous carbon having graphite-like<br>
microcrystalline carbon atoms and an increased<br>
interlayer distance between the microcrystalline<br>
carbon atoms and disclosed, for example, in<br>
JP-A-11-317333 or JP-A-2002 - 025867 . The particle<br>
size of the electrode active material may range<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 100 μm, more preferably from<br>
1 to 20 μm, because this particle size range<br>
facilitates the formation of the electrode layer as<br>
a thin coating for the capacitor electrode plate and<br><br>
also provides the electrode layer with a higher<br>
capacity density.<br>
[0050]	The amount of the hydroxyalkylchitosan in the<br>
coating formulation may range preferably from 0.1<br>
to 20 parts by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to<br>
10 parts by weight in terms of solid content per 100<br>
parts by weight of the electrode active material.<br>
An unduly small amount of the hydroxyalkylchitosan<br>
makes the electrode active material and<br>
conductivity-imparting material easier to fall off<br>
from the electrode, while an excessively large amount<br>
of the hydroxyalkylchitosan covers the electrode<br>
active material under the hydroxyalkylchitosan and<br>
therefore has a potential problem in that the internal<br>
resistance of the electrode plate may increase.<br>
[0051]	The coating formulation may preferably contain<br>
a conductivity-imparting material. As the<br>
conductivity-imparting material, conductive carbon<br>
such as acetylene black, Ketjenblack or carbon black<br>
can be used. Such conductive carbon is used as a mixture<br>
with the electrode active material. The combined use<br>
of the conductivity-imparting agent can further improve<br>
the electrical contact of the active material itself,<br>
and can provide the capacitor with reduced internal<br>
resistance and a higher capacity density. The<br>
conductivity-imparting agent may be used in an amount<br><br>
of generally from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably<br>
from 2 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight<br>
of the electrode active material.<br>
[0052]	The coating formulation can be produced by<br>
mixing the hydroxyalkylchitosan solution, the<br>
electrode active material and, if necessary, the<br>
conductivity-imparting agent in a mixer. As the<br>
mixer, a ball mill, sand mill, pigment disperser,<br>
mix-muller, ultrasonic disperser, homogenizer,<br>
planetary mixer, Hobart mixer, or the like can be<br>
used. Also preferred is a method that firstly mixes<br>
the electrode active material and the conductivity-<br>
imparting agent in a mixer such as a mix-muller,<br>
planetary mixer, Henschel mixer or omni-mixer<br>
homogenizer, adds the hydroxyalkylchitosan solution,<br>
and then mixes them into a uniform mixture. Adoption<br>
of this method makes it possible to readily obtain<br>
a uniform coating formulation.<br>
[0053]	The capacitor electrode plate according to the<br>
present invention is obtained by applying the coating<br>
formulation, which contains the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan solution, the electrode active<br>
material and, if necessary, the conductivity-<br>
imparting agent, onto a collector and then drying<br>
the coating formulation to form an electrode layer.<br>
As the collector, a material having electrical<br><br>
conductivity and electrochemical durability can be<br>
used. From the viewpoint of the possession of heat<br>
resistance, a metal material such as aluminum,<br>
titanium, tantalum, stainless steel, gold or<br>
platinum is preferred, with aluminum or platinum<br>
being particularly preferred. No particular<br>
limitation is imposed on the shape of the collector.<br>
In general, however, a sheet-shaped col lector having<br>
a thickness of from 0.001 to 0.5 mm or so can be<br>
employed.<br>
[0054]	No particular limitation is imposed on the<br>
forming method of the electrode layer. Preferred<br>
is a method that applies the coating formulation for<br>
the capacitor electrode onto a collector and then<br>
dries the coating formulation to form an electrode<br>
layer on the collector. As an application method<br>
of the coating formulation onto the collector, a<br>
method such as doctor blade coating, dip coating,<br>
reverse roll coating, direct roll coating, gravure<br>
coating, extrusion coating, brush coating or spray<br>
coating can be mentioned.<br>
[0055]	The viscosity of the coating formulation may<br>
be generally from 100 to 100,000 mPa-s, preferably<br>
from 1,000 to 50,000 mPa-s, more preferably 5,000<br>
to 20,000 mPa-s, although it differs depending on<br>
the type of the coating machine and the layout of<br><br>
the coating line. No particular limitation is<br>
imposed on the amount of the coating formulation to<br>
be applied. In general, however, the coating<br>
formulation may be applied in such an amount that<br>
the electrode layer to be formed subsequent to the<br>
elimination of the solvent by drying will have a<br>
thickness of usually from 0.005 to 5 mm, preferably<br>
from 0.01 to 0.3 mm.<br>
The drying method and drying conditions for the<br>
coating layer are similar to those described above<br>
in connection with the battery electrode plate.<br>
[0056]	The capacitor according to the present<br>
invention, which has the above-described electrode<br>
plate, can be manufactured in a usual manner by using<br>
parts such as the electrode plates, the electrolyte<br>
and a separator. Described specifically, it can be<br>
manufactured, for example, by stacking the electrode<br>
plates together with the separator interposed<br>
therebetween, rolling or folding the resultant stack<br>
into a form conforming to the capacitor, placing the<br>
rolled or folded stack in a can, filling the<br>
electrolyte into the can, and sealing the can.<br>
[0057]	The electrolyte may preferably be, but is not<br>
limited particularly to, a nonaqueous electrolyte<br>
with an electrolyte dissolved in an organic solvent.<br>
As the electrolyte, any electrolyte known to date<br><br>
can be used. Illustrative are tetraethylammonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate, triethylmonomethylammonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate, tetraethylammonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate, and the like.<br>
[0058]	No particular limitation is imposed on the<br>
solvent (electrolyte solvent) for dissolving such<br>
an electrolyte, insofar as it is commonly employed<br>
as an electrolyte solvent. Specific examples<br>
include carbonates such as propylene carbonate,<br>
ethylene carbonate and butylene carbonate; lactones<br>
such as y-butyrolactone; sulfolanes; and nitriles<br>
such as acetonitrile. They can be used either singly<br>
or in combination. Among these, carbonates are<br>
preferred for their high withstand voltage. The<br>
concentration of the electrolyte may be generally<br>
0 . 5 mole /L or higher, preferably 0 . 8 mole/L or higher.<br>
[0059]	As the separator, a known separator can be used<br>
such as a microporous membrane or nonwoven fabric<br>
made of a polyolefin such as polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene as a principal material; or a porous<br>
membrane made of pulp as a principal raw material<br>
and generally called "electrolytic capacitor paper".<br>
A separator may also be formed by dispersing inorganic<br>
ceramic powder and a binder in a solvent, coating<br>
the resultant dispersion onto an electrode layer,<br>
and then drying the coating. A solid electrolyte<br><br>
or gel electrolyte may also be used instead of such<br>
a separator. As other materials such as a can, those<br>
employed in usual capacitors are all usable.<br>
[0060] [Undercoating formulation]<br>
The undercoating formulation according to the<br>
present invention is characterized in that it is<br>
obtainable by adding a conductive material to the<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan solution and kneading the<br>
resultant mixture. The hydroxyalkylchitosan<br>
solution for use in the undercoating formulation is<br>
the same as that mentioned above under the [Coating<br>
formulation]. Further, the conductive material is<br>
the same as the conductive material mentioned above<br>
under the [Application to battery electrode plate<br>
and battery] . The amount of the conductive material<br>
to be added to the hydroxyalkylchitosan solution and<br>
the method for applying the undercoating formulation<br>
onto the collector or substrate are the same as those<br>
described above.<br>
[0061]	The conventional batteries and electric double<br>
layer capacitors are each accompanied by the problems<br>
mentioned above under the Background Art,<br>
specifically, the problems of the poor adhesion<br>
between the electrode layer and the collector<br>
(substrate) and the high resistance between the<br>
electrode layer and the substrate. To solve these<br><br>
problems, a variety of undercoating formulations<br>
(primers) have been proposed. The adhesion problem<br>
has been solved by an undercoat layer formed from<br>
such an undercoating formulation, but due to the<br>
undercoat layer, the resistance between the<br>
electrode layer and the collector has become still<br>
higher, thereby failing to solve the problems.<br>
[0062]	The present inventors have found that the<br>
adhesion between the electrode layer and the<br>
collector can be significantly improved, while<br>
lowering the resistance between the electrode layer<br>
and the collector rather than increasing it at all,<br>
by applying the undercoating formulation of the<br>
present invention onto a surface of a collector to<br>
a thickness of from 0.2 to 100 fxm, preferably from<br>
1.0 to 50 p,m in terms of solid content to form an<br>
undercoat layer, and forming a positive electrode<br>
layer, a negative electrode layer or a capacitor<br>
electrode layer on the undercoat layer.<br>
[0063]	Accordingly, the present invention provides a<br>
battery electrode plate or capacitor electrode plate<br>
characterized in that an active material layer is<br>
formed on the undercoat layer formed from the<br>
undercoating formulation; and a battery or capacitor<br>
characterized by having the electrode plate.<br>
[0064]	It is to be noted that the binder, which forms<br><br>
the active material layer or electrode layer in the<br>
electrode plate, may be the above-described<br>
hydroxyalkylchitosan solution or as an alternative,<br>
a conventionally-known binder, for example, a known<br>
binder such as polyfluorinated vinylidene,<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, an acrylic resin or a<br>
silicone-acrylic resin. Especially with the<br>
above-described known binders, it has been essential<br>
to chemically treat, for example, a surface of an<br>
aluminum foil to bring about improved adhesion<br>
between the electrode layer and the collector. The<br>
use of the undercoating formulation according to the<br>
present invention can obviate such cumbersome and<br>
costly, chemical treatment and can realize still<br>
better adhesion and lower resistance. It is,<br>
therefore, possible to provide a battery and<br>
capacitor of high efficiency and high service life.<br>

Example 1 (Coating formulation, electrode plate)<br>
A positive-electrode coating formulation<br>
employed in this Example and containing a<br>
positive-electrode active material was prepared by<br>
the procedure to be described hereinafter. As<br>
materials for the positive-electrode coating<br>
formulation, LiCoO2 powder having particle sizes of<br>
from 1 to 100 μm, acetylene black as a conductive<br>
aid and the solution of Sample 4 described above in<br>
Table 1 were stirred and mixed at a mixing ratio of<br>
90 parts, 5 parts and 50 parts at a rotation speed<br>
of 60 rpm for 120 minutes in a planetary mixer to<br>
obtain a slurry-form, positive-electrode coating<br>
formulation with the positive-electrode active<br>

[0068]	Using the positive-electrode coating<br>
formulation obtained as described above and<br>
employing, as a substrate, a collector formed of a<br>
2 0-μm thick aluminum foil, the positive-electrode<br>
coating formulation was applied onto one side of the<br>
substrate by a "COMMA ROLL COATER" . The thus-coated<br>
substrate was then dried for 2 minutes in an oven<br>
controlled at 110°C, and was further dried for 2<br>
minutes in the oven controlled at 150°C to eliminate<br>
the solvent and to have the binder crosslinked, so<br><br>
40<br>
that a positive electrode plate with an active<br>
material layer formed with a dry thickness of 100<br>
μm on the collector was obtained. The positive<br>
electrode plate obtained by the above-described<br>
procedure was pressed under conditions of 5,000<br>
kgf/cm2 to make the coating uniform. Subsequently,<br>
aging was conducted for 48 hours in a vacuum oven<br>
controlled at 80°C to fully eliminate volatiles (the<br>
solvent, the unreacted polybasic acid, etc.).<br>
[0069]	Parallel lines, which consisted of<br>
perpendicularly-intersecting 11 vertical lines and<br>
11 horizontal lines, were drawn by a cutter at<br>
intervals of 1 mm on the active material layer to<br>
form 100 squares within 1 cm2. A mending tape was<br>
applied to the surface of the active material layer,<br>
and tape peeling was then conducted. The number of<br>
squares which were not peeled off was determined as<br>
a measure of adhesiveness. The average of 10 tests<br>
was 98.0 squares. Further, the conditions of the<br>
active material layer were observed after the<br>
electrode plate with the squares formed thereon as<br>
described above was immersed at 50°C for 24 hours<br>
in a mixed solvent of EC (ethylene carbonate), PC<br>
(propylene carbonate) and DME (dimethoxyethane)<br>
combined together at a volume ratio of 1:1:2. One<br>

Example 1<br>
The glycerylated chitosan solution of Sample<br>
3 (5 parts in terms of solid content), high-purity<br>
activated carbon powder (specific surface area:<br>

followed by further mixing for 10 minutes to obtain<br>
a coating formulation. Using a doctor blade, the<br>
coating formulation was applied onto a 20-μm thick<br>
aluminum foil, followed by drying at 80°C for 30<br>

electrode layer sides opposing each other, and a<br>
cellulose-made, disc-shaped separator of 18 mm in<br>
diameter and 40 |j,m in thickness was held between the<br>

put and fixed on the package with the<br>
polypropylene-made packing interposed therebetween.<br>
