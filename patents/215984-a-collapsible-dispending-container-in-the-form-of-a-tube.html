				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a collapsible dispensing container in the form of a tube and a method for improving the adhesion between a collapsible dispensing tube head.<br>
Polymeric materials have many applications in packaging structures. They are used as films, sheets, lidstock, pouches, tubes and bags. These polymeric materials may be employed as a single layer or one or more layers in a structure. Unfortunately, there are countless polymeric materials available. Furthermore, resin suppliers frequently have a tendency to claim many more applications for a product than the product is actually suitable for. In addition, in view of the specialized applications and processing problems that are encountered despite the suppliers" claims, one skilled in the art can not tell whether a particular resin will be suitable for an application unless tested. However, for various reasons there are frequently drawbacks to the use of many of these polymeric materials. For example, ethylene vinyl alcohol is an excellent oxygen barrier material for use in packaging food products. However, this polymeric material can be affected by moisture that is present in the atmosphere or the packaged product. As a result, it is frequently found that some polymeric materials are better for certain applications than others.<br>
One area where there is a need for suitable resins in film applications is in the area of heat shrinkable films. Heat shrinkable polymeric films are commonly used in packaging meats, particularly primal meat cuts and other large pieces of meat. While this description will mainly detail the usage of films for packaging meat and meat by-products, it will be understood that these films are also suitable for packaging a myriad of other products, including food products, and non-food products, for example, denfifrices, cosmefics and pharmaceuticals.<br>
Some of the films embodying the present invention are intended to be used by meat packers in the form of heat shrinkable bags with one opened end, which bags are closed and sealed alter insertion of the meat. After the product is inserted, air is usually evacuated from the package and the open end of the bag is closed. Suitable methods of closing the bag include heat sealing, metal clips, adhesives, etc. Heat is applied to the bag once sealing is completed to initiate shrinkage of the bag about the meat.<br><br>
In subsequent processing of the meal, the bag may be opened and the meat removed for further cutting of the meat into user cuts, for example, for retail cuts or for institutional use.<br>
Suitable shrink bags must satisfy a number of criteria. Many bag users seek a bag that is capable of surviving the physical process of filling, evacuating, sealing and heat shrinking. For example, during the, shrinking process great stress can be placed on the film by the sharp edges of bone in the meat. The bag must also have sufficient strength to sup."ive the material handling involved in moving the large cuts of meat, which may weigh a hundred pounds or more, along the distribution system. Because many food products including meat deteriorate in the presence of oxygen and"or water, it is desirable that the bags have a barrier to prevent the infusion of deleterious gases and/or the loss or addition of moisture. Conventional packaging for many products has frequently been made of multiple layer films having at least three layers. These multiple layer films are usually provided with at least one core layer of either an oxygen barrier material such as a vinylidene chloride copolymer, ethylene vinyl alcohol, a nylon or a metal foil, preferably aluminum. Heat shrinkabie meat bags, for example, have generally used vinylidene chloride copolymers.   The copolymer of the vinyiidene chloride may, foi example, be a copoWmei with vinyi chloride or methyl acryiate. Collapsible dispensing containers in the form of tubes may or may not use one or more foil layers. The foil layers in addition to supplying an oxygen barrier also provide the dispensing tube with "deadfoid", i.e., the property of a collapsible dispensing tube when squeezed to remain in the squeezed position without boimcing back. Collapsible dispensing lubes employing a foil layer are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 3,172,571 and No. 3, 347,419, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, collapsible dispensing tubes do not require a foil layer. They may employ only one or more layers of thermoplastic or polymeric material?. Examples of such tubes are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,418,841 and No. 4,986,053, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Methods of making collapsible dispensing tubes are well known and are disclosed in the above and other U.S. patents. Generally, foilless plastic tubes have a body wall which can be a single layer plastic sheet or film which can be extruded<br><br>
in tubular form and cut into desired lengths. Multilayer plastic sheet and film can be made by lamination, including coextrusion coaling, processes, or by coextrusion processes such as cast coextrusion through a flat die, or tubular coextrusion through a tubular die. Single and multilayer sheet or film that has been cast or laminated typically is shaped about an elongated cylindrical mandrel and sealed to itself along a side seam to form a tubular body. Single and multilayer sheet or film that is respectively extruded or coextmded through a tubular die can be extruded in near final dimensional and vacuum sized to final dimension. Single or multilayer sheet and film can be coextmded and blown as a larger tubular form, which can be cut lengthwise and formed into a tube as would be a flat sheet or film. The formed tubular body wall is joined to a head typically having a neck with a dispensing orifice, and a shoulder. One end of the tubular body is joined to the shoulder of the head. The head can be pre-formed by compression or injection molding. Usually. the tubular body is insened into a die and a head is injection molded onto the end of the tubular body such that the head and tubular body are fused or bonded together. The die which fomis the head can be one which is shaped to form a head having an integral cap having an integrally formed hinge. Typically, the tube head is sealed by a cap, filled through the tube"s lower open end, and sealed at that end. "While collapsible dispensing tubes are generally made as described above, some collapsible dispensing tubes and some containers are made by an extrusion blow molding process in which a single or multilayer parison or preform is extruded and then blow-oi in a mold into the desired shape of the finished container, for example, one having an integral body wall, shoulder, neck and closed bottom. Some containers including collapsible dispensing tubes, are made by injection molding such that they have an integral body wall, shoulder, and neck which can have an integrally formed hinge and cap, and an open bottom.<br>
Outer layers of films and body walls of containers used in packaging food products can be any suitable polymeric material such as linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, blends of these polyethylenes, and ionomers, including sodium and zinc ionomers. Such ionomers include Surlyn, ethylene vinyl acetate etc. In conventional shrink bags, the outer layers are generally linear low density polyethylene or blends thereof. Suitable outer layers<br><br>
for meat bags are taught by U.S. Patent No. 4,457,960 to Newsome, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
While conventional films have been suitable for jnany applications, it has been found that there is a need for films that, for example, are stronger and more easily processed than conventional films.   In meat bags, there is a need for films and bags that have superior toughness and sealability and the ability to undergo cross-linking without undue deterioration. Thus, it is an objecl of the present invention to provide improved structures, including single and multi-layer films, sheets, lidstock, and containers, for example, pouches, tubes and bags. In particular, there is a need for structures for use in shrink bags wherein the shrink bags are capable of withstanding production stresses and the shrink process.<br>
it has also been found that there is a need for containers, for example, collapsible dispensing containers or lubes having good bond strength beiween a propylene polymer layer or component and an ethylene polymer component. Thus, another object of this invention is to provide improved polymeric structures with improved bonding properiies. For example, it is known that in the packaging industry, it has been difficuh lo bond a structure, such as a collapsible dispensmg tube head or layer, or simply a layer made of a propylene polymer, such as polypropylene or a propylene ethylene copolymer, directly to a structure, for example, a layer made of an ethylene polymer, for example, a low density polyethylene ("LDPE"). While it is known to add an ethylene polymer to a propylene polymer structure to improve adhesion lo the ethylene polymer structure, it has heretofore been necessary to add a major amount of the ethylene polymer to sufficiently improve the adhesion. This has been undesirable. In adding a major amount, the desired properties of the propylene polymer have been significantly diminished. For example, collapsible dispensing tube heads having an integral flip top cap integrally joined to the head by a living hinge are usually made of a propylene polymer, e.g., polypropylene or a propylene ethylene copolymer, because the material properties of the polypropylene permit the hinge to be flexed repeatedly over time without cracking or breaking. Adding a major amount of a polyethylene to the propylene polymer employed to form the tube head to obtain satisfactory adhesion to a polyethylene body wall layer results in<br><br>
diminished hinge flexibility and/or early hinge failure. Further, since tube heads made of propylene poiyraer heretofore could not be satisfactorily bonded directly to a collapsible dispensing tube body wall layer of polyethylene, the packaging industry has been limited in types of heads and head materials that can be employed, and in the types of body wall layer materials that can be bonded to propylene heads. It therefore is a main objective of this invention to provide good bonding of a structure, for example, a collapsible dispensing lube head, or a layer, comprised of a propylene polymer, to a structure, for example, a tube body wail layer comprised of ethylene polymer.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a packaging structure or film having a layer of propylene polymer which can be, or which is satisfactorily bonded to a contiguous layer of an ethylene polymer.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a container, for example, a collapsible dispensing container or a collapsible dispensmg tube head comprised of a propylene polymer, joined or which can be joined with good bond strength directly to a structure, for example, a layer, or a body wall or side wall layer of a container or tube, where the layer is comprised of a polyethylene.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an above-mentioned collapsible dispensing container or tube which does not stress crack between its first ethylene polymer body wall layer and its propylene polymer head after the dispensing container or tube has been exposed to su-ess crack inducing agents.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a collapsible dispensing container or tube such as mentioned above, whose head has an integral cap joined directly to the head by an integral living hinge which can undergo 10,000 flexing cycles without undergoing stress fracture or failure.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a method for improving the adhesion between the above-mentioned structures without the use of an adhesive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The structures of the present invention include films, sheets, lidstock. pouches, containers, tubes and bags. These structures may be a single layer or multi-layer structure. The structures are comprised of poiymers that have been polymerized in the presence of a single site catalyst, such as a metailocene. A metailocene is a complex organometallic molecule typically containing zirconium or titanium, with a pair of cyclic alkyl molecules. More specifically, metailocene catalysts are usually compounds with two cyclopentadiene rings fixed to the metal. These catalysts are frequently used with aluminoxanes as a co-cata!yst or an activator. One suitable aluminozane is a methaliumoxane (MAO). Besides, titanium and zirconium, hafnium may also be used as the metal to which the cyclopentadiene is bonded. Alternative metallocenes may include Group IVA, VA and VIA transition metals with two cyclopentadiene rings. Also mono-cyciopentadiene rings or sibyl amides may altemaiiveiy be in the metailocene instead of two cyclopentadienes. Other metais to which the cyclopentadine may be<br><br>
attached may include the metals in the lanthanide series. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 show representative metallocenes that are suitable single site catalysts.<br>
While the reaction mechanism is not completelyjinderstood, it is believed that the meiallocene, single site catalyst confines the copolymerization reaction to a single site over the polymer thus controlling comonomer placement and side chain length and branching. The copolymers formed from meiallocene single site catalysis are highly stereo regular products with narrow molecular weight distribution.   The metallocenes can be used to polymerize ethylene, propylene, ethylenic and aceiylenic monomers, dienes and carbon monoxide. Comonomers with ethylene and propylene include siyrene, substituted styrene, vinyl, acrylonitrile. meihyl acr\"late, methyl meihacrylate and !.4 - hexadiene. The metaliocene single site catalysts are capable of producing isotactic polymers and syndiotactic polymers, i.e.. polymers in which the crystalline branches allemaie regularly on both sides of the back bone of the polymer. There are two general types of single site catalyst reactions. The first are nonstereoselective catalysts reactions which have been developed by Exxon and Dow and which are used to make Exxon"s Exact resins and Dow"s CGCT resins. See Figs. 3 and 4. The second type of reactions are stereoselective catalysts developed by Hoechst and Fina for stereo specific polymerization paniculariy of polypropylene and other olefms such as butene-I, and 4 mcthyipentene-1. See, e.g.. Figures 5 and 6.<br>
The ethylene alpha olefins polymerized by a single site catalyst have low crystaliinity and a density that ranges from 0.854 to 0.97 gm/cc. Although this density range is similar lo conventional ethylene polymers, i.e., LDPE, LLDPE and ULDPE. the polymers in the structures of the present invention have a narrow molecular weight distribution and homogeneous branching. The molecular weight distribution of the preferred polymers may be represented by the formula<br>
MWD      Mw/Mn = 
The preferred polymers can have a MWD of from about i .97, more preferably about 2.0 to about 2.2.<br>
In adduiou, the melt processabiUty of these polymers {Uo/h) has a range of about 5.5 to about 12 while conventional homogenous polymers are generally less<br><br>
than 6.5 at an MWD of 2. The melt tension of these polymers is in the range of about 1.5 to 3.5 grams.<br>
The MWD ofthese polymers may be determined.using a Water"s 150 to^ at I4(fc with linear columns (1036 A-10* A") from Polymer Labs and a differential refractometer detector. Comparison of the MWD of a IMI, 0.920 density CGCTpolymer wiih that of IMI, 0.920 density conventional LLDPE illustrates the very narrow MWD of the CGCT polymers which usually have a Mw/Mn of approximately 2 compared lo 3 or greater for LLDPE. A preferred ethylene copolymer is a copolymer of ethylene and a C| to C;ij alpha olefin. A preferred copolymer is a low modulus ethylene octene copolymer sold by Dow. This copolymer is formed by Dow"s constrained-geometry catalyst technology which uses a single site catalyst such as cyclo-peniadienyl titanium complexes. As best understood. Dow"s constrained geometry catalysts are based on group XV transition metals that are covaiently bonded to a monocyclopentadieny! group bridged with a heteroatom. The bond angle between the monocyciopentadienyi group, the titanium center and the heteroatom is less than 115". When the alpha olefin is present in the copolymer in the range of about 10 to 20% by weight, these copolymers are referred lo as plaslomers. When the percent alpha olefin is greater<br>
than 20% these copolymers are called elastomers. The preferred ethylene octene copolymer has the octene comonomer present in an amount less than 25%. Examples of the Dow ethylene octene copolymer have the following physical properties.<br><br>
Molecular weight distribution is defined as the ratio of weight average molecular weight lo number average molecular weight. The lower the figure, the ijarrower<br><br>
the molecular weight distribution, Melt flow ratio is defined as the ratio of melt index, as tested with a 10-kg load to the melt index with a 2-kg load. The higher the ratio, the more processable the material. Melt flow ratio is defined as melt tension measured in grams. The higher the niimber the greater the melt strength. Other suitable resins are the Exact resins sold by Exxon. Some of these resins have the following characteristics;<br><br><br>
The structure of the present invention is comprised of an ethylene, propylene, or styrene polymer or copolymer fornied by a43olymerization reaction _ in the presence of a single site catalyst preferably a metallocene. (The so-formed polymer or copolymer is sometimes referred to herein as the second polymer, for example as the second ethylene polymer, or as the second propylene polymer, to differentiate it from an ethylene or propylene polymer or copolymer that is not so formed, the latter sometimes being referred to as a first ethylene polymer or a first propylene polymer.) Ethylene may be copolymerized with any suitable monomer such as C3-C20 alpha olefin including propylene, butene-1, 1-pentene, 4-methyl penlene-1, hexene-1 and octene-1. A preferred comonomer is oclene-1. Another preferred comonomer is bulene-1. The preferred ethylene alpha olefin copolymer of the present invention has a density in the range of .880 gm/cc to about .920 gm/cc, a more preferred range of .890 gm/cc to about .915 gm/cc and a most preferred range of about .900 gm/cc to about .912 gm/cc.<br>
Figure I shows a cross section of a three layer coextruded structure. Layer 14 is the core layer which may be a barrier layer that minimizes the transmission of oxygen through the structure. Preferred barrier materials are polyvinylidene chloride copolymers such as copolymers of vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride or an alkyl acrylaie such as methyl acryiaie. Other preferred barrier materials include ethylene vinyl alcohol, nylon or a metal foil such as aluminum. Layer 14 may also be a copolymer of ethylene and styrene formed using a single site catalyst in the polymerization reaction. The copolymer of vinylidene chloride may also be polymerized by the polymerization reaction in the presence of a single site catalyst. In addition, layer 14 may also be a polystyrene formed by a polymerization reaction in the presence of a single site catalyst. One such polystyrene is the crystalline syndiotactic polystyrene sold by Idemitsu Petro-Chemicai Co., Tokyo,<br>
■<br>
Japan.<br>
On opposite sides of the core layer 14 of Figure 1 are layers 12 and 16. At least one of these layers 12 is a polymer formed by a polymerization reaction in the presence of a single site catalyst. The remaining layer 16 may be any suitable polymeric material such as a polyester, co-polyester, polyamide, polycarbonate.<br><br>
polypropylene, propylene-ethylene copoiymer, ethylene-propylene copolymer, combinations of polypropylene and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, ultra low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, medium__density polyethylene, high density polyethyiene, linear low density polyethylene copolymers, linear medium density polyethylene copolymer, linear high density polyethylene copolymer, ionomer, ethylene acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer, or ethylene methacrylic add copolymer.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the layer 12 may be a blend of a polymer formed by a polymerization reaction in the presence of a single site catalyst and a suitable polymeric material such as is identified in connection with the description of layer 16 above.<br>
As seen in Figure 2. the structure may also include embodiments which have a fourth layer 28 over the first layer 22 and a fifth polymeric layer 20 over the third layer 26. The composition of the fourth layer 28 may be selected from the same group of materials from which the composition of the first layer 12 or third layer 16 is selected, and the fifth layer 30 may also be the same composition as the first layer 22 or the third layer 26.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of Figure 2, the five layer structure may have a first layer 28 similar in composition to layer 12 of Figure 1, i.e., the film may have a first layer of a polymer fonned by the polymerization reaction with a single site catalyst or blends thereof with another suitable polymeric material. One or both of the second 22 and fourth 26 layers may be an adhesive layer.<br>
The composition of adhesive layers 22 and 25 is selected for its capability to bond the core or barrier layer 24 to the surface layers 28 and 30. A variety of the well known extrudable adhesive polymers adhere well to the core or barrier layer 24. Thus, if for example layer 30 is a polypropylene, an adhesive polymer based on polypropylene is desirably selected for layer 26. Examples of such adhesives are the extrudable polymers available under the trade designations Admer QF-500, QF550, or QF-55i fi-om Mitsui Petrochemical Company, or Exxon 5610A2.<br><br>
If the composition of layer 28 or 30 is an ethylene based polymer or copoiymcT, an adhesive polymer based on ethylene is preferably selected for layer 22, including ethylene homopolymers and copolymers. Such a preferred adhesive composition is an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer containing 25% to 30% by weight vinyl acetate. Other ethylene based homopolymers and copolymers modified to enhance adhesion properties are well known under the trade names of, for example, Bynel and Plexar. Typical base polymers for these extrudable adhesives are the polyethylene and the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers. Such adhesive polymers, including the polypropykne-based polymers, are typically modified with carboxyl groups such as anhydride. Also acceptable as adhesives are ethylene methyl acryiate copolymers (EMA).<br>
Additional layers may also be present in the structures of the present invention. For example, the present invention contemplates 4, 6, 7, 8, and higher numbers of layers in the film of the present invention and different combinations of layer structures may also be present. For example, there may be more than one barrier layer, i.e.. two layers of polyvinylidene chloride copolymers, two layers of foil or two layers of EVOH or nylon. Alternatively, there may be a layer of EVOH and a layer of a polyvinylidene chloride copolymer or a polyamide or a polystyrene and other combinations of the core materials. The additional layers of the present invention also encompass more than one polymer formed by the polymerization reaction in the presence of a single site catalyst. The polymers may be in a layer alone or in the form of a blend. Suitable polymers for blending with an ethylene polymer formed in a polymerization reaction with a single site catalyst include other ethylene polymers formed in a polymerizadon reaction with a single site catalyst, LDPE, LLDPE, ULDPE, EVA, ionomers, ethylene copolymers, ethylene methyl acryiate (EMA), ethylene acrylic acid (EAA), ethyl methyl acrylic acid (EMAA), propylene polymers, e.g., polypropyiene, (PP), ethylene normal butyl acryiate (ENBA), and ethylene propylene copolymers (PPE). Suitable polymers for blending with a propylene polymers formed in a polymerization reaction with a single site catalyst include ethylene propylene copolymers.<br>
Preferred blends using EVA"s are those having lower VA content as they tend to yield EVA layers having better hot strength. EVA"S having higher VA<br><br>
content tend to yield EVA layers having increased adhesion to for example, the vinylidene chloride copolymer layer. EVA"s having virtually any amount VA will have better adhesion to the vinylidene chloride copolymer layer than an ethylene homopolymer. However, good inlerlayer adhesion is considered desirable in the invention, and thus, steps are usually taken to enhance adhesion where no unacceptable negative effect is encountered. Thus, higher VA contents, in the range of 6% to 12* vinyl acetate are preferred, a melt index of less than 1 is also preferred. While blend amounts are shown herein in weight percent. VA contents are mole percent. Especially preferred EVA"s have VA content of 7% to 9% and melt index of 0.2 to 0.8. Blends of EVA"s to make up the EVA component of layers 16 and 18 are acceptable.<br>
The structure of the present invention may be formed by any conventional process. Such processes include extrusion, coextrusion, extrusion coating, extrusion lamination, adhesive lamination and the like, and combinations of processes. The specific process or processes for making a given film which is neither oriented nor cross-linked can be selected with average skill, once the desired structure and compositions have been determined.<br>
When the structure of the present invention is a film, the film may also be<br>
oriented either uniaxially or biaxially. Orientation can also be done by any<br>
conventional process for fomiing multiple layer films   A preferred process<br>
includes the steps of coextrusion of the layers to be oriented, followed by<br>
orientation in one of the conventional processes such as blown tubular orientation<br>
or stretch orientation in the form of a continuous sheet, both being molecular<br>
orientation processes. The double bubble technique disclosure in Pahlke, U-S.<br>
Patent No. 3,456,044 is suitable for use in producing the film of this invention.<br>
The films may also be fonned by a tubular water quench process. In this process<br>
the film may be extruded dovmwardly as a tube formed by an annular die, and<br>
carried into a water quench tank, generally with a cascade of water on the outside<br>
surface providing initial cooling. The flattened tape is withdrawn from the quench<br>
bath, is reheated (normally in a second water bath) to its orientation temperature, is<br>
stretched in the machine direction between two sets of rolls that are so rotated as to<br>
establish a linear rate differential therebetween, and is simultaneously oriented in<br>
I-<br><br>
the transverse, or cross-machine, direction as an inflated bubble trapped between the nips of the roils. In accordance with conventional practice the film will usually be cooled by air in the orientation zone.<br>
The film of the present invention may also be oriented and/or cross-linlted. The first step is the formation of a multiple layer film. The formation, of the multiple layer film, is usually most easily accomplished by coextrusion of the desired layers. Other formation processes are acceptable so long as the resulting oriented film at the conclusion of fabrication processing is a unitary structure. The second step is orienting the multiple layer film. One method for accomplishing orientation is by heating the film to a temperature appropriate to molecular orientation and molecularly orienting it. The film may then be optionally heat set by holding it at an elevated temperature while its dimensions are maintained. The orientation step is preferentially carried out in line with the first step, which is the film formation step of the process.<br>
The third step is subjecting the formed and oriented multiple layer film, to electron beam irradiation.<br>
The amount of electron beam irradiation is adjusted, depending on the make-up of the specific film to be treated and the end use requirement- While virtually any amount of irradiation will induce some cross-linking, a minimum level of at least 1.0 megarads is usually preferred in order to achieve desired levels of enhancement of the hot strength of the film and to expand the range of temperature at which satisfactory heat seals may be formed. While treatment up to about 50 megarads can be tolerated, there is usually no need to use more than 10 megarads. so this is a preferred upper level of treatment, the most preferred dosage being 2 to 5 megarads.<br>
The third step of subjecting the film lo electron beam irradiation is performed only after the multiple layer film has been formed, and after molecular orientation, in those embodiments where the film is molecularly oriented. It should be noted that, in the irradiation step, all of the layers in the film are exposed "     simultaneously Co the irradiation sources, such that irradiation of all the layers of the film takes place simultaneously.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the process, the second step of orientation may be omitted and the unoriented multiple layer film may be cross-linked by irradiation treatment to produce a cross-linked, unoriented, muitifjle layer film.<br>
EXAMPLES Multilayer films may be prepared according to the present invention. Biaxialiy stretched three layer films may be prepared by a "double bubble" process similar to that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,456,044 by coextruding the following compositions through a multilayer die, biaxialiy stretching the coextruded primary tube. The films may also be irradiated if desired.<br><br><br><br><br>

Figure 7 shows a cross section of a preferred structure, generally designated 32, having two layers. The structure can be or comprise the body wall 34 of a container, for example, the collapsible dispensing container shown in the form of a tube 36 in Figure 8.   Structure 32 is comprised of a structure or layer 38 comprising a first ethylene polymer, and a contiguous structure or layer 40 comprised of a propylene polymer blended with a second ethylene polymer fonned by a polymerization reaction with a metallocene catalyst system, or with a single site catalyst, preferably a metallocene. The propylene polymer of layer 40 can comprise homopolymers and copolymers of propylene, such as polypropylenes, copolymers of propylene and ethylene (including copolymers of ethylene and propylene), and propylene terpolymers, for example, elastomeric terpolymers prepared or derived from unsaturated monomers comprising propylene and ethylene. The propylene polymer can also comprise blends of these polymers. Layer 4 of Figure 7 Is an example of layer 1 of Example 24.<br>
The second ethylene polymer of the blend of layer 40 preferably comprises a copolymer or interpolymer of ethylene. Preferably, the ethylene polymer is a copolymer or interpolymer of ethylene and an alpha olefin, especially a C3-C20 alpha olefin. Preferred copolymers of ethylene and alpha olefins are ethylene butene-l copolymers, particularly linear ethylene butene-1 copolymers.<br>
The first ethylene polymer of layer 38 can comprise a low, linear low, very low or ultra low density polyethylene, a medium density polyethylene, a high density polyethylene, an ionomer, or any suitable blend or combination of such ethylene polymers.<br>
Structure 32 can also be comprised of a first layer of a first propylene polymer of the type of propylene polymer described above in relation to the blend of propylene polymer and second ethylene polymer, and a second layer comprised of an ethylene polymer as described above in relation to first ethylene polymer, blended with a second propylene polyhier formed by the polymerization reaction with a metallocene catalyst system or with a single site catalyst, preferably a metallocene. The second propylene polymer can comprise an interpolymer or copolymer of propylene and an alpha olefin, preferably a C3-C20 alpha olefin.<br><br>
While structures or members such as a layer formed of a first polyethylene and structures or members such as a layer, or a collapsible dispensing container head formed of polypropylene usually do not adhere wejl to each other, as will be explained, structure 32, formed of layer 38 comprised of an ethylene polymer, and layer 40 comprised of a blend of a propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer, has good interlayer adhesion.<br>
Figure 8 shows a collapsible dispensing tube 36 comprised of a tubular body wall 34 joined at its upper end directiy to the shoulder 42 of a head, generally designated 44. having a neck 46 with a dispensing orifice 48. The lower end (not shown) of body wall 34 can be sealed, for example by being brought together and sealed to itself by heat and pressure in a known manner. Head 44 preferably is comprised of a blend of a propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer which can be such as those described above for layer 40 of Figure 7. Although body wall 34 of collapsible dispensing tube 36 can be a singie layer comprised of a first ethylene polymer such as described above for layer 38, as shown in Figure 9, body wail 34 is a two layer structure such as shown in Figure 7, wherein layer 38, comprised of the first ethylene polymer, is the inner layer that is fused or joined directly to, and therefore contiguous to head 42. Layer 40, comprised of the blend of a propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer is the outer layer. As will be explained, good adhesion is obtained between inner layer 38 and shoulder 42 of head 44.<br>

The so-fonned polymer can be an ethylene polymer (sometimes referred to herein as a or the second ethylene polymer) which is blended with the propylene polymer of one of the structures, and/or it can be a propylene polymer (sometimes referred to herein as a or the second propylene polymer) which is blended with the first ethylene polymer of the other structure. The invention is especially concerned with such improved structures, especially packaging structures, wherein the so-formed polymer is a second ethylene polymer, and it is blended with the propylene polymer of the propylene polymer structure. Thus, the present invention includes improved packaging structures where one of the first or second structures, components or members is comprised of a first ethylene polymer, and the other is comprised of a blend of a propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer. The improved packaging structures have good bond strength, and there is no stress cracking between a first ethylene polymer body layer structure and a propylene polymer container or tube head structure, after the container or lube is exposed to stress crack-inducing agents.   Also, desirable properties provided by the propylene polymer to its structure, for example, in providing flexibility to an integral living hinge which integrally joins a cap to a tube head comprised of a blend of propylene polymer and the second ethylene polymer, is not diminished as compared to such a tube head comprised of the propylene polymer without the second ethylene polymer.<br>
The structures of the invention having improved bond strength include any fu^t structure comprised of a first ethylene polymer and any second structure comprised of the blend of a propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer. The structure can be merely two layers.

TYPICAL PROPERTIES OF EXACT 3024 AND 3Q27 POLYMERS AND FILMS"<br><br><br><br>
The blend of propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer can comprise any suitable minor amount, i.e., less than 50 wt.%, of second ethylene polymer, the remainder being propylene polymer. Preferably, the blend comprises about 5 to about 49 wt.% of second ethylene polymer and about 51 wt.% to about 95 wt.% of propylene polymer, more preferably, about 70 to about 90 wt.% of propylene poiymer, and about 10 to about 30 wi.% of second ethylene polymer.<br>
For a two layer film or body wall of a collapsible dispensing tube comprised of a first layer of first ethylene poiymer, preferably the LDPE Petrothene N A-980-000, bonded with good bond strength to a second layer of a blend propylene polymer and second ethylene polymer preferably comprised of the propylene terpolymer Montel KS-021P, the blend preferably is comprised of from about 85 to about 90 wt.% of the propylene terpolymer, and about 10 to about 15 wt.% of second ethylene polymer, preferably the linear ethylene butene copolymer Exact 3024. The following two-layer body wall structures comprised of these materials were produced:<br><br>
The two-layer structures were about 0-018 inch thick, the outer blend layer being about 30% and the inner LDPE layer being about 70% of the total thickness of the structure. The two layer structures were formed by a water quenched tubular coexirusion process during which the continuous tubular extrudate was vacuum calibrated by being expanded in a tubular vacuum chamber. The chamber"s interior diameter was about 1.5 inch. The continuous tubular extrudate was cut into<br><br>
ten (10) tubular bodies, each 5 inches long. The tubular bodies had an internal diameter of about 1.509 inch, an external diameter of about 1.545 inch, and a wall thickness of about .036 inch. These tubular bodies were suitable for use as the body wall of a collapsible dispensing tube.<br>
Adhesive Strength Test of Two-Laver Slructures<br>
The two layer tubular body wall structures shown as Structures A and B in Example 25 were tested for adhesive or bond strength. Strips "/^ inch wide were cut from the tubular bodies. The strips were mechanically held at one end and attempts were made at the other end of the strips to manually peel the outer layer away from the inner layer. While slight delamination occurred with control strips made from similar strips cut from similarly made two-layer coextruded tubular bodies having an outer layer of 100 wt.% of the propylene terpolymer Monlcl KS-012P and an inner layer of 100 wt.% of the LDPE Peirothene® NA-980-000, the strips of the two-layer tubular body wall Structures A and B of the invention had good bond strength. Their layers could not manually be pulled apart.<br>
Additional test strips were made of two-layer water quenched coextruded tubular bodies, i.e., body wall structures, of the invention, these having an outer layer blend of 20 wt.% of the ethylene butene piaslomer Exact 3024 and 80 wt,% ofthe propylene terpolymer Montel KS-012P, and a contiguous inner layer of 100% ofthe LDPE Peirothene® NA-980-000. These were tested as above and found to have good bond strength. However, die latter tubular bodies were less than wholly desirable for uses requiring a smooth outer surface feel, because the exterior surface ofthe outer blend layer of these test strips had a granular surface feel when passed against a person"s lips.<br>
Similar strips cut from two-layer tubular bodies ofthe invention obtained as above but whose outer layer blend contained 30% by weight Exact 3024 and the balance Montel KS-012P, were tested and found to have a good bond strength. They had an outer layer surface feel to the lips that was worse than those strips having 20% by weight of Exact 3024.<br>
Similar strips obtained from similarly made two-layer tubular bodies of the invention having an outer layer blend of about 10 wt.%i of second ethylene<br><br>
polymer Exact 3024 and about 90 wt.% of propylene polymer Montel KS-0I2P, a contiguous inner layer of the LDPE, Petrothene NA-980-000, and an outer to inner layer thickness ratio is 1:1, were tested and found to have good bond strength and a<br>
desirable smooth feel to the outer layer.<br>
From the above tests, it was found that two-layer structures of the invention having an outer layer of a blend of from about 10 to about 30 wt.% of a second ethylene alpha olefin copolymer made from a polymerization reaction with a single site catalyst, and from about 70 to about 90 wt.% of a propylene polymer, and having a contiguous inner layer of first ethylene polymer, had improved adhesive strength as compared to a two-layer coexiruded film having an outer layer of 100% propylene ethylene polymer and an inner layer of a first ethylene polymer.   It was also found thai two-layer films of the invention having an outer layer of from about 10 to less than about 20 wt.% of an ethylene bulene copolymer made from a single site metallocene catalyst and at least 80 to about 90 wl.% of a propylene polymer, and a contiguous irmer layer of a first ethylene polymer, had an outer layer which for some uses had a more desirable, softer feel than the outer layer of similar structures having from about 20 to about 30 wt.% of the ethylene butene copolymer.<br>
Bond Strength of Tubular Bodv Walls to Tube Heads In order to test the adhesive or bond strength of a tubular body wall having an inner layer of a first ethylene polymer to a collapsible dispensing tube head made of blend materials of the invention which are disclosed as comprising the tube head shown in Figure 8, four sets of such collapsible dispensing tube heads were injection molded and, during the process, fusion bonded to tubular body walls in a conventional manner described herein. These unfilled collapsible dispensing tubes were tested for head/body wail bond integrity and stress cracking. For a first test, four variables of blend materials were used t6 form the heads, Variables were 1 through 3 were blend materials of the invention.<br>
First Set Of Tube Head Variables And Tests<br>
Variables	Head Resin Material<br><br>

2	Blend of 80% PP/20% LDPE**<br>
3	Blend of 70% PP/30% LDPE**<br>
4	Control: 100% LDPE<br>
The PP of the blends was Pro-fax 8623, a propylene-ethylene copolymer comprising about 75 wt.% PP and about 25 wl.% polyethylene, based on the weight of the copolymer. The properties of Pro-fax 8623 are presented above. The LDPE* of the blend of Variable 1 was Exact 3027 and the LDPE** of the blends of Variables 2 and 3 was Exact 3024, each Exact material being a linear ethylene butene plastomer made from a polymerization reaction using a metallocene single site catalyst whose properties are presented above. The LDPE used to form the Control head (Variable 4) is available under the trade designation Rexene 1011 from Huntsman, Corp. The LDPE of the Control head has a melt flow rate of about 1.0 g/lOmin (ASTM D1238-E), and a density of about .9205 g/cm^ (ASTM-D792). The heads which were tested for bond strength and which were flex tested had a threaded neck for receiving a threaded cap, as shown in Figure 8.<br>
Five sample tube heads were injection molded of the material of each variable. Sample tubes were made. Each of the sample tube heads was fusion bonded to a 1 3/8 inch diameter extruded single layer LDPE tubular body wall made of Petrothene NA-980-000, or an LDPE having a melt index of about 1.2 g/10 min. and a density of about .920 g/cm". available under the trade designation LDPE 2020T from E. L DuPont de Nemours and Company.<br>
First Head/Bodv Wall Bond Integrity Test Each of the tubes made from the five samples of each head variable and of the Control was tested for head/body wall bond integrity. The tubular bodies were fusion bonded to the shoulders of the heads by placing an end of the tubular body in an injection mold and injecting the blend of propylene polymer and a second ethylene polymer material into a mold such that the end of the LDPE blend inner layer of the body wall was ftised to the shoulder of the tube head. The tubular body walls were cut transaxially 2 inches from the shoulder. A 2" long %,iht:h wide strip of the body wall was cut from the open end of the transaxial cut edge of<br><br>
the body wall up to but not including the shoulder, where the smp was left as-bonded to the shoulder. One inch of the strip was clamped into the top clamp and one inch of the tube body was clamped to the bottom clamp of an Instron tensile strength tester. The load cell of the tester was 1OOKG. With the strip disposed at about 90° to the longitudinal axis of the tube, the jaws were separated at a rate of about 8 inches per minute until the strip fractured or separated from the head. Peak Instron tensile strength values are shown in TABLE I below.<br><br>
The Instron test results in TABLE I indicate good head/body wall integrity for each variable and for the Control. All tubes tested above 1.2KG which was the minimum acceptable value.   Strips from all variables failed only by eventual fracturing, except for Variable 2 (80% PP/20% LDPE Blend) which had lower tensile values and failed by layer interface separation prior to breakage. The Instron tensile strength values shown in TABLE I are all well above 1.2KG and, as shown below, are superior to the values obtainable from attempting to bond the LDPE body wail layer to a tube head made of 100% propylene/ethylene copolymer, with respect to which no bond was obtained.<br>
Second Set of Tube Head Variables and Test For a second test, a second set of five variables of blend materials were used to form a second set of tube heads. In this test. Variables 6 through 8 were blend materials of the invention,<br>
Variables	Head Resin Material<br><br><br>
For the second set of variables, thePP of the blends was Pro-fax 8623 and the LDPE* of the blends was EXACT 3027. The propylene polymer (PP) used to form the Control head. Variable 5, was Pro-fax 8623. The HOPE used to form the Control head, Variable 9, was HDPE Alathon M46I2 available from Equistar Chemicals and having a meit index of about 1.2 g/cm""and a density of from about 944 to about .948 g/cm . The heads which were tested for bond strength had a ihoulder, a neck, a cap and a living hinge that integrally joined the cap to the neck. IS shown in Figure 10.<br>
Six sample tube heads were injection molded of the material of each variable. Sample tube heads were made. Each of the sample tube heads was iiision bonded to a I 3/8 inch diameter extruded single layer tubular body wall nade of the LDPE Petrothene NA-980-000.<br>
Second Head/Bodv Wall Bond Integritv Test Each of the tubes made from the six samples of each Variable 5 through 8 vas tested for head/body wall bond integrity. The tubular bodies were fusion &gt;onded to the shoulders of the tube heads as in the first test, and the same test procedure was employed as the in the first test. Peak Instron tensile strength /alues are shown in TABLE II below.<br><br><br><br>
"N" indicates no bond was achieved even with attempts to use various injection<br>
pressures and temperatures.<br>
The Instron test results in TABLE II indicate that no head/body wall bond was achieved for Variable 5 (Control 100% PP head) and Variable 6 (Head blend of 90% PP/10% LDPE*), an average minimally acceptable bond was achieved for Variable 7 (Head blend of 80% PP/20% LDPE*), and a satisfactory bond was achieved for Variable 8 (Head blend of 70% PP/30% LDPE*). The average bond for Variable 8 was greater than the average bond for Variable 9 (100% HDPE head).<br>
Head Stress Crack Test Five collapsible dispensing tubes taken from each of the Variables and from the Control of the lot of tubes made and first tested above for head/body wall bond strength were filled with a solution of 20% Nonox (nonoxyn,ol-9 polyethylene glycol) available under the trade designation Igepal CO-630 from GAF, at\d 80% ethyl alcohol, in one series of tests, and with a solution of 20% Igepai and 80% water in another series of tests, to chemically accelerate aging of the tube he^ and body wall materials and thereby generate stress cracks at the bonded interface of the inner layer of the body wall and the shoulder of the tube head. The bcttom ends of the filled tubes were sealed with clamps and placed and held in an oven at about 140°F. for various time periods ranging from 3 to 19 days. The head stress cracks (HSC) and side stress cracks (SSC) which resulted are shown in TABLE III below.<br><br><br><br>
Tabic III shows that no head stress cracks were generated for any of the Variables or for the Control. While some side stress cracks (stress cracks of the tubular body wall") occurred, they were located next to the clamped end seal, well away from the head/body wall bond. These stress cracks are thought to have resulted from the stresses imparted by the end clamps.<br>
Head Hinge Flex Tests<br>
Collapsible dispensing tube heads having a cap integrally joined to the head by an integral living hinge or strap, as shown in Figure 10, were flex tested. The tube heads were injection molded using the same materials as used for the variable and control materials employed in the first head/body wall bond integrity test and in the head stress crack test. Five tube heads of each variable and of the control were made, and the cap of each tube was mechanically moved from the open to closed to open positions (1 cycle) for 10,000 cycles without interruption , While two of the five control samples exhibited partial fracturing of the hinge, the hinges of all of the variables of the heads were satisfactory. They showed no signs of failure.<br>
The above tests show that employing a blend of a second ethylene polymer, preferably an ethylene alpha-olefm copolymer made by a polymerization reaction using a single site catalyst, with a propylene polymer, preferably a propylene-ethylene copolymer, preferably in range of from about 20 to about 30 wt.%, more<br><br>
preferably from about 25 to about 30 wt.% of second ethylene polymer, with about 70 to about 80 wt.%, more preferably from about 70 to about 75 wt% of propylene polymer, improves the bond strength of a collapsible tube head to a . tubular body wall inner layer comprised of a first ethylene poIymer, for exainpte a LDPE. This is accomplished while maintaining, or without detracting from the flexibility or flex endurance through 10,000 open-close cycles of an integral living hinge of the head, as compared to the living hinge of a head made of 100% propylene polymer. Thus, a tube body wall layer or another layer, film or structure comprised of a first ethylene polymer can now be satisfactorily bonded to a layer, tube head or other structure made or comprised of a propylene polymer, if the propylene polymer is blended with a minor amount of a second ethylene polymer made by a polymerization reaction with a metallocene catalyst system, or with a single site catalyst, which can be a metallocene.<br>
The present invention includes methods for improving the adhesion between two packaging structures, for example, between a first structure or layer comprising a first ethylene polymer and a contiguous second structure or layer comprising a propylene polymer, or for improving the adhesion between a collapsible dispensing container or tube head comprised of a propylene polymer and a collapsible dispensing tube body wall layer comprised of a first ethylene polymer, wherein the method comprises blending with the first ethylene polymer which is to form the first structure or layer and/or with the propylene polymer which is to form the second structure or layer or the tube head, a polymer formed by the polymerization reaction with a metallocene catalyst system, or with a single site catalyst, which can be a metallocene. In the method of the invention, the polymer which is blended can comprise a propylene polymer, and the propylene polymer is blended with the first ethylene polymer. Preferably, the polymer which is blended comprises a second ethylene polymer, and the second ethylene polymer, preferably a minor amount, isTjlended with the propylene polymer which is to form the second layer, or the tube head. The amount of the so-formed polymer which is blended, is any suitable amount given the materials and structures involved. The amounts to be blended are disclosed above. The so-formed polymer can be blended and extruded by conventional means and methods. For example.<br><br>
pellets of a second ethylene polymer such as Exact 3024, can be physically mixed or blended with pellets of the propylene polymer and fed to a conventional extruder in which the mixture of pellets is melt blended and coextruded through a tubular die operated under standard tube manufacturing conditions well known in the art.<br><br><br>
