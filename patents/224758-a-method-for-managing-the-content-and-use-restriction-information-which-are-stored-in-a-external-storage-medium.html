CONTENT MANAGEMENT METHOD, CONTENT MANAGEMENT<br>
APPARATUS, CONTENT PLAYBACK APPARATUS, AND CONTENT<br>
STORAGE APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
managing content to be stored in storage media or<br>
inside apparatuses, content playback / storage /<br>
management apparatuses for implementing such a<br>
method, and a storage medium storing a program for<br>
loading the content management method as well as<br>
the program itself, and in particular, the invention<br>
aims to provide an increased efficiency in<br>
management of a viewing time limit and a use time<br>
limit on content.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, there has been an increasing demand<br>
for digital content distribution services making<br>
use of communications or broadcasting.<br>
For example, newspaper story distribution<br>
services have been conceived, such as one in which<br>
newspaper accounts are downloaded every morning to<br>
a cellular phone to be stored into a storage medium<br>
attached thereto, ana the news accounts are<br>
presented for reading by connecting the storage<br>
ledium to other apparatus such as a TV set whenever<br>
it is demanded. Needs for distribution of content<br>
with a limited time period are also growing, such<br>
as one in which viewing time limit information is<br>
attached to downloaded video content and music<br>
content for allowing such content to be viewed only<br>
for a certain limited time period.<br>
In an application where content is distributed<br>
electronically to be stored in apparatuses or<br>
storage media, it is important how to prevent<br>
unauthorized use of stored content from occurring<br>
for the protection of a right of a copyright holder.<br>
Though it goes without saying that it is necessary<br>
to provide a scheme which eliminates the risk of<br>
unauthorized copying or tampering, especially,<br>
these days, there has been a growing importance of<br>
a freer content use control scheme which also<br>
controls the number of times of content viewing and<br>
viewing time limit thereof.<br>
Conventionally, a lot of schemes for ensuring<br>
compliance with a use time limit attached to<br>
distributed data have been studied. Many among such<br>
schemes compare use time limit information with<br>
current time and date, and then approve use of data<br>
in question in a case where the current time and<br>
date fits in a time period indicated by the use time<br>
limit (e.g. the men hod disclosed in Japanese<br>
Laid-Op en Patent Publication No. H10-222063).<br>
As described above, at a terminal side where<br>
data is put to use, it is popular to employ a checking<br>
method which applies a check to data to which a use<br>
time limit is attached in terms of whether current<br>
time and date which is indicated by an internal clock<br>
held in the terminal is within a designated use time<br>
limit or not. In many cases, however, because a user<br>
is able to set the time of day at his / her terminal<br>
side arbitrarily, it is possible to use data not<br>
in compliance with a use time limit by tampering<br>
its internal clock as though current time and date<br>
was within the time limit.<br>
As a method for solving such a problem, for<br>
example, a method disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Publication No. H10-207779 is cited.<br>
According to the cited method, a terminal equipment<br>
queries an information management center at the time<br>
when the terminal demands for use of data, and the<br>
information management center transmits use<br>
approval information to the terminal only in a case<br>
where it is judged to be in compliance with<br>
limitations on a use time period and on use count,<br>
where the above problem is overcome by not using<br>
a clock at the terminal side.<br>
However, according to conventional methods,<br>
either one of use time limit designation by means<br>
of absolute date conditions such as "fronxx yy (month,<br>
date) to xx zz (month, date)" and use time limit<br>
designation by means of relative date conditions<br>
such as "for vv days starting at the time of<br>
downloading" is adopted, and accordingly, it has<br>
been hard to designate a complex use time limit such<br>
as "for the maximum vv days during a time period<br>
from xx yy (month, date) to xx zz (month, date)."<br>
Moreover, because a query is always issued to<br>
an information management center at the time of each<br>
use according to the method disclosed in the Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No H10-207779, there<br>
have been problems which prevent users from using<br>
data in an easy manner; among such problems are:<br>
disadvantages of an inevitable necessity to provide<br>
a terminal apparatus with communications means, of<br>
communications cost, or, for example, of<br>
unavailability of data at a location where a radio<br>
wave does not reach.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is devised to solve these<br>
problems, and as its first object, the invention<br>
aims to provide a content management method which<br>
makes it possible to designate a use time limit with<br>
a higher degree of freedom, and to provide a program<br>
for implementation thereof, and a content playback<br>
apparatus and a content management apparatus in<br>
which such a program is installed.<br>
In addition, as its second object, the<br>
invention aims to provide a content management<br>
method for preventing an unauthorized use of data<br>
which is done by the tampering of the Lime of day,<br>
and to provide a program for implementation thereof,<br>
and a content playback apparatus, a content storage<br>
apparatus, and a content management apparatus in<br>
which such a program is installed.<br>
These objects are achieved by setting a use<br>
time limit on content flexibly with an allowed use<br>
start time and date, an allowed use end time and<br>
date, and use time period information designating<br>
the length of an allowed use time period incorporated<br>
in use restriction information on content.<br>
Furthermore, these objects are achieved by<br>
limiting an approval for use of content only in a<br>
case where it is confirmed through comparison of<br>
current time and date with reference time and date<br>
that the current time and date is after the reference<br>
time and date, where the reference time and date<br>
information which is subjected to updating at a<br>
specific timing is retained in a terminal or a storage<br>
medium; and accordingly, it becomes possible to<br>
prevent an unauthorized viewing of content which<br>
is done by turning back a terminal clock.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described below with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings. Incidentally, the present invention is<br>
in no case limited to these embodiments; the present<br>
invention is able to be exploited in various kinds<br>
of modes within the range where the gist of the<br>
present invention is maintained.<br>
(Embodiment I)<br>
FIG. 1 shows the configuration of a content<br>
playback apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the<br>
present invention. This content playback apparatus<br>
comprises content management section 101 that<br>
manages content stored in storage medium 110, time<br>
reference section 102 that acquires current time<br>
and date 120, use date information updating section<br>
103 that rewrites use date information stored in<br>
storage medium 110, playback approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 104 that judges whether a playback<br>
at the current time and date is allowable or not<br>
with reference to the use date information, and<br>
content playback section 105 that plays the content<br>
back .<br>
Time reference section 102 for acquiring<br>
current time and date 120 is usually configured to<br>
acquire current time and date by referring to an<br>
internal clock held by a content playback apparatus,<br>
however, this section may be configured in such a<br>
way that it refers to any external clock<br>
alternatively, such as a GPS or a server connected<br>
via a network.<br>
Content management section 101 manages content<br>
stored in storage medium 110. Storage medium 110<br>
is a medium having data area 111 and protective area<br>
112. Herein, protective area 112 is a special area<br>
protected so that a user is not able to write and<br>
read directly there.<br>
FIG. 2 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
the storage format of content and its use restriction<br>
information in storage medium 110 of FIG. 1.<br>
Content 210 is stored in data area 111, whereas<br>
its use restriction information 220 is stored in<br>
protective area 112 in association with content 210.<br>
Content 210 may be subjected to encryption.<br>
Use restriction information 220 contains use<br>
date information 230, use time period information<br>
240, and check value 250. Use restriction<br>
information 220 may contain other use limitations<br>
such as, for example, maximum allowed playback count<br>
of content, and so on. In addition, use restriction<br>
information 220 as a whole may be subjected to<br>
encryption.<br>
Use date information 230 is made up of allowed<br>
use start time and date 231, allowed use start time<br>
and date validity flag 232, allowed use end time<br>
and date 233, and allowed use end time and date<br>
validity flag 234.<br>
Allowed use start time and date 23 1 and allowed<br>
use end time and date 233 is information in which<br>
the start point and the end point of allowable<br>
playback time period for content is specified each<br>
with an absolute date, such as in "from xx yy (month,<br>
date) to xx z z (month, date)." It is not always<br>
necessary to designate both of allowed use start<br>
time and date 231 and allowed use end time and date<br>
2 3 3. Instead, it is possible to designate either<br>
the start time and date or the end time and date<br>
only as in, for example, "available anytime after<br>
xx yy (month, date)" or "available anytime before<br>
xx yy (month, date) ." In addition, it is also possible<br>
to designate neither of allowed use start time and<br>
date 231 and allowed use end time and date 233, in<br>
other words, make no designation of use date.<br>
Each of allowed use start time and date validity<br>
flag 232 and allowed use end time and date validity<br>
flag 234 is a flag indicating whether allowed use<br>
start time and date 231 or allowed use end time and<br>
date 233 is designated or not, where each of the<br>
flag shows that allowed use start time and date 231<br>
is not designated in a case where allowed use start<br>
time and date validity flag 232 is a value indicating<br>
invalid, whereas allowed use end time and date 233<br>
is not designated in a case where allowed use end<br>
time and date validity flag 234 is a value indicating<br>
invalid. In this embodiment, it is assumed to show<br>
that it is valid in a case where the value of a flag<br>
is "1", while it is invalid in a case where the value<br>
of the flag is "0." Such designation may also be<br>
implemented by designating an invalid value such<br>
as 0 in allowed use start time and date 231 or allowed<br>
use end time and date 233, and if done so, there<br>
is no necessity to separately provide allowed use<br>
start time and date validity flag 232 or allowed<br>
use end time and date validity flag 234.<br>
Use time period information 240 is information<br>
in which a relative allowed use time period such<br>
as "available fcr 30 days" is specified, and this<br>
information is made up of allowed use time period<br>
241, use time period validity flag 242, and use time<br>
period processing flag 243. Use time period validity<br>
flag 242 is a flag indicating the validity of allowed<br>
use time period 2 4 1, and the flag shows that allowed<br>
use time period 241 is not designated in a case where<br>
use time period validity flag 242 is a value<br>
indicating invalid. In this embodiment, it is<br>
assumed to show that it is valid in a case where<br>
the value of a flag is "1", while it is invalid in<br>
a case where the value of the flag is " 0." Such<br>
designation may also be implemented by designating<br>
a value indicating infinite as a use time period,<br>
and if done so, there is no necessity to provide<br>
use time period validity flag 242.<br>
Use time period processing flag 243 is a flag<br>
indicating whether use time period information has<br>
been subjected to processing or not, and the flag<br>
is set to be a value indicating "processed" in a<br>
case where use time period information 240 has been<br>
interpreted by use date information updating section<br>
103, which is described below, and where use date<br>
information 23 0 has been updated. In this embodiment,<br>
it is assumed to show that it has been subjected<br>
to processing in a case where the value of a flag<br>
is "1", while it has not been processed yet in a<br>
case where the value of the flag is "0." It is noted<br>
that, a specific rule may be provided to regard that<br>
use time period information has been subjected to<br>
processing in a case where, for example, allowed<br>
use time period 241 is a value indicating 0, thereby<br>
judging whether the use time period information has<br>
been processed or not yet, and if done so, there<br>
is no necessity to provide use time period processing<br>
flag 243 .<br>
Check value 250 is a value for checking to make<br>
sure that entire use restriction information 220<br>
has not been tampered. A predetermined value such<br>
as, for example, "1111" is predefined as a check<br>
value, which indicates that use restriction<br>
information 220 has been tampered if the check value<br>
is not the predetermined value. It is not necessary<br>
to provide check value 250 in a case where there<br>
is no possibility of tampering, as in a case where<br>
use restriction information 220 is stored in<br>
protective area in an encrypted form.<br>
Use date information updating section 103<br>
updates allowed use start time and date 231 and<br>
allowed use end time and date 233 by using use time<br>
period information 240 and current time and date<br>
120. This updating is done just once at the time<br>
of, for example, initial playback of content, where<br>
use date information is rewritten by setting the<br>
current time of day at the time of updating as an<br>
allowed use start time and date while setting the<br>
point in time where an allowed use time period has<br>
elapsed starting from the allowed use start time<br>
and date as an allowed use end time and date (herein,<br>
however, in a case where the point in time at the<br>
elapsing of the allowed use time period is after<br>
the original allowed use end time and date, then,<br>
the original allowed use end tine and date remains<br>
as allowed use end time and date intact).<br>
By referring to this use date information 230,<br>
playback approval / disapproval judgment section<br>
104 judges whether the content is allowable to be<br>
played back or not. In a case where it is judged<br>
by playback approval / disapproval judgment section<br>
104 as allowable to be played back, content 210 is<br>
sent from content management section 101 to content<br>
playback section 105, and content playback is<br>
executed. Incidentally, in the case of this<br>
embodiment, it is assumed that use restriction<br>
information 220 in storage medium 110 is pre-stored<br>
as allowed playback count information indicating<br>
the maximum allowed playback count of content, and<br>
use date information updating section 103 of a<br>
content playback apparatus decrements the allowed<br>
playback count information at each time of a content<br>
playback. Once after the allowed playback count<br>
information reaches to "0", playback approval /<br>
disapproval judgment section 104 is supposed not<br>
to approve the playback of the content (described<br>
later with reference to FIG. 5). In this way, it<br>
is devised to make it possible to put restrictions<br>
on the playback of content based on playback counts<br>
in addition to restrictions thereon based on use<br>
date information.<br>
With reference to FIG. 3 , an explanation is<br>
given on content playback processing according to<br>
the present embodiment. FIG. 3 is a flowchart<br>
illustrating the procedures of content playback<br>
processing according to the present embodiment.<br>
It is noted that, in this embodiment, it is<br>
assumed that the value of use time period processing<br>
flag 243 is set to be "0" up to the time of initial<br>
playback of content, and the updating processing<br>
of use date information is done at the time of the<br>
initial playback.<br>
Step 301: Current time and date 120 is acquired<br>
y time reference section 102.<br>
Step 302: Use restriction information 220 on<br>
content to be played back is acquired by content<br>
management section 101.<br>
Step 303: Check value 250 of use restriction<br>
information 22G is checked. Playback processing is<br>
aborted in a case where check value 250 is different<br>
from the predetermined value. If not, the processingg<br>
goes to step 304.<br>
Step 304 : Use date information updating section<br>
103 updates use date information 230. Details on<br>
this processing will be described later.<br>
Step 305: By comparing the use date information<br>
with the current rime and date, playback approval<br>
/ disapproval judgment section 104 judges whether<br>
the content is allowable to be played back or not.<br>
Details on this processing will be described later.<br>
In a case where the playback of the content is judged<br>
as allowable, the processing goes to step 306. If<br>
not, the playback processing is aborted.<br>
Step 306: The content is acquired by content<br>
management section 101.<br>
Next, the procedures for updating of use date<br>
information 230 by use date information updating<br>
section 103 in step 304 of FIG. 3 is described below<br>
with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4 is a flowchart<br>
illustrating the updating procedures of use date<br>
information 230.<br>
Step 401: The value of use time period validity<br>
flag 242 is checked. In a case where the use time<br>
period validity flag is "1", the processing goes<br>
to step 402. Otherwise the updating processing of<br>
use date information is ended.<br>
Step 4 0 2: The value of use time period<br>
processing flag 243 is checked. In a case where the<br>
vaiue of use time period processing flag 243 is "1",<br>
that is, the updating of the use date information<br>
has already been done, the updating processing of<br>
the use date information is ended. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 403.<br>
Step -503: The value of allowed use start time<br>
arid date validity flag 232 of use date information<br>
2 30 is checked. In a case where the value of allowed<br>
use start time and date validity flag 232 is "1",<br>
the processing goes to step 404. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 405.<br>
Step 404: Current time and date 120 is compared<br>
with allowed use start time and date 2 3 1. In a case<br>
where current time and date 120 is a time and date<br>
before allowed use start time and date 2 3 1, the<br>
updating processing of the use date information is<br>
ended. If not, the processing goes to step 405.<br>
Step 405: Allowed use start time and date 231<br>
is overwritten with current time and date 120, and<br>
the value of allowed use start time and date validity<br>
flag 232 is set into "1."<br>
Step 406: A value TE is calculated as an addition<br>
cf allowed use time period 241 to current time and<br>
date 120.<br>
Step 407: The value of allowed use end time<br>
ar.ci date validity flag 234 of use date information<br>
230 is checked. In a case where the allowed use end<br>
time and date validity flag is "1", the processing<br>
gees to step 408. If not, the processing goes to<br>
step 410 .<br>
Step 408: Current time and date 120 is compared<br>
with allowed use end time and date 233. In a case<br>
where current time and date 120 is a time and date<br>
after allowed use end time and date 233, the updating<br>
processing of the use date information is ended.<br>
If not, the processing goes to step 40 9.<br>
Step 409: TE is compared with allowed use end<br>
time and date 233. In a case where TE is a time and<br>
date before allowed use end time and date 233, the<br>
processing goes to step 410. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 411.<br>
Step 410: Allowed use end time and date 233<br>
is overwritten with TE, and the value of allowed<br>
use end time and date validity flag 234 is set into<br>
Step 411: The value of use time period<br>
processing flag 243 is set into "1."<br>
Through the above steps, it is possible to<br>
update use date information 230 by using current<br>
time and date 120 and use time period information<br>
240.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given with an example case where use date updating<br>
processing is carried out only in a case where use<br>
date information 230 has been designated in advance,<br>
and where current time and date 120 is after allowed<br>
use start time and date 231 but before allowed use<br>
end time and date 233; notwithstanding the foregoing,<br>
it may be configured to update use date information<br>
230 always by using current time and date 120 and<br>
use time period information 240 without taking into<br>
account the relation between current time and date<br>
120 and allowed use start time and date 231 as well<br>
as the relation between current time and date 120<br>
and allowed use end time and date 233. In such a<br>
configuration, steps 403, 404, 407, and 408 in FIG.<br>
4 are not necessary.<br>
In addition, herein, an explanation is given<br>
with an example case where allowed use end time and<br>
date 233 is not subjected to rewriting in a case<br>
where allowed use end time and date 233 is before<br>
TE, however, it may be configured to always rewrite<br>
allowed use end time and date 233 with TE. In such<br>
a configuration, step 409 in FIG. 4 is not necessary.<br>
Next, an explanation is given on the procedures<br>
of playback approval / disapproval judgment by<br>
playback approval / disapproval judgment section<br>
104 which is illustrated in step 305 of FIG. 3. FIG.<br>
5 is a flowchart illustrating the procedures of<br>
playback approval / disapproval judgment in playback<br>
approval / disapproval judgment section 104.<br>
Step 501: Allowed use start time and date 231<br>
is compared with current time and date 120. In a<br>
case where current time and date 120 is before allowed<br>
use start time and date 231, the processing goes<br>
to step 505. If not, the processing goes to step<br>
502 .<br>
Step 502: Allowed use end time and date 233<br>
is compared with current time and date 120. In a<br>
case where current time and date 120 is after allowed<br>
use end tine and date 233, the processing goes to<br>
step 505. If not, the processing goes to step 503.<br>
Step 503 : In a case where allowed playback count<br>
information on content is greater than "0", the<br>
processing goes to step 504. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 505.<br>
Step 504: A judgment on playback is made as<br>
allowable.<br>
Step 505: A judgment on playback is made as<br>
not allowable.<br>
Through the above procedures, it is possible<br>
to judge whether it is allowable or not to execute<br>
the playback of content which is subjected to<br>
checking of its use time limit.<br>
In the present embodiment, an explanation is<br>
given by showing an example case where, if use time<br>
period information 24 0 has been designated, the<br>
interpretation processing of use time period<br>
information 240 is firstly executed to update use<br>
date information 230. With such a configuration,<br>
it becomes possible to judge whether playback is<br>
allowable or not by playback approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 104's referring to use date<br>
information 230 only, which simplifies processing<br>
at the time of content playback execution. However,<br>
it is also possible to adopt a configuration which<br>
does not comprise use date information updating<br>
section 103 but stores the time and date at which<br>
actual use is started in use time period information<br>
240, and in which playback approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 104 interprets both of use date<br>
information 230 and use time period information 240<br>
concurrently at the time of playback to judge whether<br>
the playback is allowable or not.<br>
It is noted that, in the present embodiment,<br>
an explanation is given by showing an example case<br>
where the updating processing of use date<br>
information 230 is done at the time of initial<br>
playback of content, however, the updating<br>
processing of use date information 230 may be<br>
executed at any other point in time such as, for<br>
example, at the time of downloading the content.<br>
In addition, in the present embodiment, though<br>
an explanation is given by showing an example case<br>
where use restriction information on content is<br>
stored in protective area, the use restriction<br>
information may be stored in data area in a case<br>
where there is no possibility of tampering of the<br>
use restriction information, as in a case where the<br>
use restriction information has been subjected to<br>
encryption.<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment, though<br>
an explanation is given by showing an example case<br>
where content and its use restriction information<br>
is stored in a storage medium, it may be configured<br>
in such a way that the content and its use restriction<br>
information is stored in any internal storage area<br>
of a content playback apparatus (such as in a hard<br>
disc) .<br>
By configuring a content playback apparatus<br>
as described above, it becomes possible for a content<br>
distribution source to designate a use time limit<br>
with a high degree of freedom, and it becomes possible<br>
for the content playback apparatus to execute the<br>
playback of content in compliance with the<br>
designated use time limit.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
In Embodiment 2, the management of content and<br>
its use restriction information when the content<br>
is moved or copied is explained.<br>
FTG. 6 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
a content management apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 2 of the present invention, where the<br>
apparatus moves / copies content. This content<br>
management apparatus comprises content retaining<br>
section 602 that retains content, first content<br>
management section 601 that manages the content<br>
retained in content retaining section 602, second<br>
content management section 603 that manages content<br>
stored in storage medium 110, content move / copy<br>
section 604 that moves / copies content between<br>
content retaining section 602 and storage medium<br>
110, move / copy approval / disapproval judgment<br>
section 607 that judges whether the moving / copying<br>
thereof is allowed or not, time reference section<br>
605 that acquires current time and date 120, and<br>
use date information updating section 606 that<br>
rewrites use date information stored in content<br>
retaining section 602 and storage medium 110.<br>
First content management section 601 manages<br>
content and its use restriction information retained<br>
by content retaining section 602. Content retaining<br>
section 602 is a storage medium such as a hard disc<br>
in a personal computer.<br>
Second content management section 603 manages<br>
content stored in storage medium 110. Storage medium<br>
110 has the same configuration as that illustrated<br>
in FIG. 2 according to Embodiment 1.<br>
Content move / copy section 604 is a section<br>
that copies or moves content and its use restriction<br>
information retained in content retaining section<br>
602 to storage medium 110, or copies or moves content<br>
and its use restriction information retained in<br>
storage medium 110 to content retaining section 602.<br>
Time reference section 605 is usually<br>
configured to acquire current time and date 120 by<br>
referring to an internal clock held by a content<br>
management apparatus, however, this section may be<br>
configured in such a way that it refers to any<br>
external clock alternatively, such as a GPS or a<br>
server connected via a network.<br>
Use date information updating section 606<br>
updates allowed use start time and date 231 and<br>
allowed use end time and date 233 by using use time<br>
period information 240 and current time and date<br>
120.<br>
Move / Copy approval / disapproval judgment<br>
section 607 judges whether content is allowable for<br>
copying or moving or not.<br>
FIG. 7 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
the storage format of content and its use restriction<br>
information managed by content retaining section<br>
602. Content and its use restriction information<br>
are retained in the same format in storage medium<br>
110.<br>
In this embodiment, it is explained on a case<br>
where use date information updating section 606<br>
updates use date information 230 at the time of<br>
copying cr moving of content. With such a<br>
configuration, because it is possible to perform<br>
interpretation processing of the use time period<br>
designated by use time period information 240 at<br>
the time of moving or copying of content, it becomes<br>
unnecessary to perform interpretation processing<br>
of the use time period at the side of a content<br>
playback apparatus, which simplifies the<br>
configuration of the content playback apparatus.<br>
It is noted that, in this embodiment, it is<br>
assumed that the value of use time period processing<br>
flag 243 is set to be "0" up to the time of moving<br>
or copying of content, and the updating processing<br>
of use date information is done at the time of the<br>
moving or the copying of the content.<br>
With reference to FIG. 8, an explanation is<br>
given on the procedures of content move processing<br>
according to the present embodiment. FIG. 8 is a<br>
flowchart illustrating the procedures of content<br>
move processing from content retaining section 602<br>
to storage medium 110 according to the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
Step 801: Current time and date 120 is acquired<br>
by time reference section 605.<br>
Step 802: Use restriction information 220 on<br>
content to be moved is acquired by first content<br>
management section 601.<br>
Step 803: Check value 250 of use restriction<br>
information 220 is checked. Move processing is<br>
aborted in a case where check value 250 is different<br>
from the predetermined value.<br>
Step 804: Move / Copy approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 607 judges whether content is<br>
allowable for moving or not. In a case where the<br>
moving of the content is judged as allowable, the<br>
processing goes to step 805. If not, the move<br>
processing is aborted.<br>
Step 805: Use date information updating section<br>
606 updates use date information 230.<br>
Step 806: First content management section 601<br>
acquires content and its use restriction information<br>
to pass the acquisitions on to second content<br>
management section 603.<br>
Step 807: Second content management section<br>
603 stores content and its use restriction<br>
information in storage medium 110.<br>
Step 808: First content management section 601<br>
erases content and its use restriction information<br>
in content retaining section 602.<br>
The updating procedure of use date information<br>
in step 805 is the same as that illustrated with<br>
the flowchart in FIG. 4 according to Embodiment 1.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given by showing an example case where the updating<br>
of use date information 230 is done after having<br>
judged whether the moving of content is allowable<br>
or not, however, it may be configured in such a way<br>
that the moving of the content is done after having<br>
updated use date information 230 without judging<br>
the approval / disapproval of the moving of the<br>
content. In such a configuration, step 804 in FIG.<br>
8 may be omitted.<br>
Next, the procedures for a move / copy approval<br>
/ disapproval judgment which is made by move / copy<br>
approval / disapproval judgment section 607 in step<br>
804 of FIG. 8 is described below with reference to<br>
FIG. 9. FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating the<br>
procedures for making a move / copy approval /<br>
disapproval judgment in move / copy approval /<br>
disapproval judgment section 607.<br>
Step 901: Allowed use start, time and date 231<br>
is compared with current time and date 120. In a<br>
case where current time and date 120 is before allowed<br>
use start time and date 231, the processing goes<br>
to step 904. If not, the processing goes to step<br>
902.<br>
Step 902: Allowed use end time and date 233<br>
is compared with current time and date 120. In a<br>
case where current time and date 120 is after allowed<br>
use end time and date 233, the processing goes to<br>
step 904. If not, the processing goes to step 903.<br>
Step 903: A judgment on moving / copying is<br>
made as allowable.<br>
Step 904: A judgment on moving / copying is<br>
made as not allowable.<br>
Through the above procedures, it is possible<br>
to judge whether it is allowable or not to execute<br>
the moving / copying of content which is subjected<br>
to checking of its use time limit. It is noted that,<br>
herein, though a check is done as to whether the<br>
moving / copying is allowed or not by means of a<br>
use time limit only, an additional step such as,<br>
for example, a check by means of vacant capacity<br>
of a storage medium may be provided.<br>
In addition, herein, an explanation is given<br>
with an example case where moving / copying is allowed<br>
only in a case where allowed use start time and date<br>
231 is a time and date before current time and date<br>
120, and in addition to that, where allowed use end<br>
time and date 233 is a time and date after current<br>
time and date 120; notwithstanding the foregoing,<br>
it may alternatively be configured to allow moving<br>
/ copying in a case where either of the conditions<br>
is met: that is, provided that allowed use start<br>
time and date 231 is a time and date before current<br>
time and date 120, or that allowed use end time and<br>
date 233 is a time and date after current time and<br>
date 120.<br>
With a concent management apparatus configured<br>
as described above, it becomes possible to move<br>
content and its use restriction information from<br>
content retaining section 602 to storage medium 110,<br>
and at the same time, to update use date information.<br>
It is noted that, herein, though an explanation<br>
is given with an example case where content and its<br>
use restriction information is moved from content<br>
retaining section 602 to storage medium 110, the<br>
moving thereof from storage medium 110 to content<br>
retaining section 602 is also implementable in<br>
accordance with the same procedures.<br>
Next, with reference to FIG. 10, an explanation<br>
is given on the procedures of content copy processing<br>
according to the present embodiment. FIG. 10 is a<br>
flowchart illustrating the procedures of content<br>
copy processing from content retaining section 602<br>
to storage medium 110 according to the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
Step 1001: Current time and date 120 is acquired<br>
by time reference section 605.<br>
Step 1002: Use restriction information 220 on<br>
content no be copied is acquired by first content<br>
management section 601.<br>
Step 1003: Check value 250 of use restriction<br>
information 220 is checked. Copy processing is<br>
aborted in a case where check value 250 is different<br>
from the predetermined value.<br>
Step 1004: Move / Copy approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 607 judges whether content is<br>
allowable for copying or not. In a case where the<br>
copying of the content is judged as allowable, the<br>
processing goes to step 1005. If not, the copy<br>
processing is aborted.<br>
Step 1005: Use date information updating<br>
section 606 updates use date information 230 on<br>
content in content retaining section 602.<br>
Step 1006: First content management section<br>
601 acquires content and its use restriction<br>
information to pass the acquisitions on to second<br>
content management section 603.<br>
Step 100 7: Second content management section<br>
603 stores content and its use restriction<br>
information in storage medium 110.<br>
The procedure of move / copy approval /<br>
disapproval judgment in step 1004 is the same<br>
procedure as illustrated in FIG. 9. In addition,<br>
the updating procedure of use date information in<br>
step 1005 is the sane as that illustrated with uhe<br>
flowchart in FIG. 4 according to Embodiment 1.<br>
Through the above procedures, it becomes<br>
possible to copy content and its use restriction<br>
information from content retaining section 602 to<br>
storage medium 110, and at the same time, to update<br>
use date information.<br>
According to the copy procedures in FIG. 10,<br>
at the time of copying, both of use restriction<br>
information on content in content retaining section<br>
602, which is a copy origin, and use restriction<br>
information on the content in storage medium 110,<br>
which is a copy target, are subjected to updating,<br>
however, it may be configured to update the use date<br>
information at the copy target only without updating<br>
the use date information at the copy origin. The<br>
copy processing procedures for such a configuration<br>
is explained below with reference to FIG. 11.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating the<br>
procedures of the second content copy processing<br>
from content retaining section 602 to storage medium<br>
110 according to the present embodiment.<br>
Step 1101: Current time and date 120 is acquired<br>
by time reference section 605.<br>
Step 1102: Use restriction information 220 on<br>
content to be copied is acquired by first content<br>
management section 601.<br>
Step 1103: Check value 250 of use restriction<br>
information 220 is checked. Copy processing is<br>
aborted in a case where check value 250 is different<br>
from the predetermined value.<br>
Step 1104: Move / Copy approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 607 judges whether content is<br>
allowable for copying or not. In a case where the<br>
copying of the content is judged as allowable, the<br>
processing goes to step 1105. If not, the copy<br>
processing is aborted.<br>
Step 1105: First content management section<br>
601 acquires content and its use restriction<br>
information to pass the acquisitions on to second<br>
content management section 603.<br>
Step 1106: Second content management section<br>
603 stores content and its use restriction<br>
information in storage medium 110.<br>
Step 1107: Use date information updating<br>
section 606 updates use date information 23 0 on<br>
content in storage medium 110.<br>
The procedure of move / copy approval /<br>
disapproval judgment in step 1104 is the same<br>
procedure as illustrated in FIG. 9. In addition,<br>
the updating procedure of use date information in<br>
step 1107 is the same as that illustrated with the<br>
flowchart in FIG. 4 according to Embodiment 1.<br>
Through the above procedures, it becomes<br>
possible to copy content and its use restriction<br>
information from content retaining section 602 to<br>
storage medium 110, and to update use date<br>
information on the content in the storage medium<br>
without updating use date information on the content<br>
in content retaining section 602.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given by showing an example case where content is<br>
copied after having judged whether the copying of<br>
the content is allowable or not, however, it may<br>
be configured in such a way that the content is copied<br>
without judging the approval / disapproval of the<br>
copying of the content. In such a configuration,<br>
step 10 0 4 in FIG. 10, and step 1104 in FIG. 11 are<br>
Tint necessary.<br>
Furthermore, though an explanation is given<br>
herein with an example case where content and its<br>
use restriction information is copied from content<br>
retaining section 602 to storage medium 110, the<br>
copying thereof from storage medium 110 to content<br>
retaining section 602 is also implementable in<br>
accordance with the same procedures.<br>
(Embodiment3)<br>
In Embodiment 3, an explanation is given on<br>
a configuration for preventing an act of<br>
unauthorized viewing of content which is done by<br>
tampering a clock in a content playback apparatus.<br>
FIG. 12 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
a content playback apparatus according to Embodiment<br>
3 of the present invention. This content playback<br>
apparatus comprises content management section 1201,<br>
time reference section 1202, playback approval /<br>
disapproval judgment section 12 0 4, and content<br>
playback section 1205, which are the same as those<br>
according to Embodiment 1, and further comprises<br>
reference time and date information updating section<br>
12 0 3 that updates reference time and date<br>
information to be stored in storage medium 1210.<br>
FIG. 13 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
the storage format of content and its use restriction<br>
information in storage medium 1210 of FIG. 12.<br>
Content 1310 is stored in data area 1211,<br>
whereas its use restriction information 1320 is<br>
stored in protective area 1212 in association with<br>
content 1310. Content 1310 may be subjected to<br>
encryption.<br>
Use restriction information 1320 contains use<br>
date information 1330 and check value 13 40. Use<br>
restriction information 1320 may contain other use<br>
limitations such as, for example, maximum playback<br>
count of content, and so on. In addition, use<br>
restriction information 1320 as a whole may be<br>
subjected to encryption.<br>
In addition, reference time and date<br>
information 1350, which is commonly referred to by<br>
a plurality of content, is stored in protective area<br>
1212. Entire reference time and date information<br>
1350 may be subjected to encryption.<br>
Use date information 1330 is made up of allowed<br>
use start time and date 1331, allowed use start time<br>
and date validity flag 1332, allowed use end time<br>
and date 1333, and allowed use end time and date<br>
validity flag 1334. Descriptions of these are the<br>
same as those described in Embodiment 1.<br>
Reference time and date information 1350 is<br>
information for storing the time and date of content<br>
downloading and the time and date of the last content<br>
playback, and this information contains reference<br>
time and date 1351, reference time and date validity<br>
flag 1352, and check value 1353. Reference time and<br>
date validity flag 1352 is a flag indicating the<br>
validity of reference time and date 1351, and the<br>
flag shows that reference time and date 1351 is not<br>
designated in a case where reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352 is a value indicating invalid.<br>
In this embodiment, it is assumed to shew that it<br>
is valid in a case where the value of a flag is "1",<br>
while it is invalid in a case where the value of<br>
the flag is "0." Such designation may also be<br>
implemented by designating a value indicating 0 in<br>
the reference time and date, and if done so, there<br>
is no necessity to provide reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352. Incidentally, check value 1353<br>
is a value for checking to make sure that entire<br>
reference time and date information 1350 has not<br>
been tampered. A predetermined value such as, for<br>
example, "1111" is predefined as a check value, which<br>
indicates that reference time and date information<br>
1350 has been tampered if the check value is not<br>
the predetermined value. It is not necessary to<br>
provide check value 1353 in a case where there is<br>
no possibility of tampering, as in a case where<br>
reference time and date information 1350 is stored<br>
in protective area in an encrypted form.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an example case where<br>
reference time and date information 1350 is referred<br>
to by a plurality of content. This is implementable<br>
with such a configuration that, for example, a<br>
plurality of content is stored in a directory which<br>
is created in data area 1211, and reference time<br>
and date information corresponding to the directory-<br>
is stored in protective area 1212. It is noted that<br>
it may be configured in such a way that only one<br>
reference time and date information is provided in<br>
a storage medium to allow all content to refer to<br>
the information, or in may be configured in such<br>
a way that all content have reference time and date<br>
information individually.<br>
Check value 1340 is a value for checking to<br>
make sure that entire use restriction information<br>
1320 has not been tampered, and its use is the same<br>
as that of check value 1353. It is not necessary<br>
to provide check value 1340 in a case where there<br>
is no possibility of tampering, as in a case where<br>
use restriction information 1320 is stored in<br>
protective area in an encrypted form.<br>
Reference time and date information updating<br>
section 1203 updates reference time and date<br>
information 1350 by using current time and date 1220.<br>
By referring to use date information 1330 and<br>
reference time and date information 1350, playback<br>
approval / disapproval judgment section 1204 judges<br>
whether the content is allowable to be played back<br>
or not. In a case where it is judged by playback<br>
approval. / disapproval judgment section 1204 as<br>
allowable to be played back, content 1310 is sent<br>
from content management section 1201 to content<br>
playback section 1205, and content playback is<br>
executed.<br>
With reference to FIG. 14, an explanation is<br>
given on content playback processing according to<br>
the present embodiment. FIG. 14 is a flowchart<br>
illustrating the procedures of content playback<br>
processing according to the present embodiment.<br>
Step 1401: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
acquired by rime reference section 1202.<br>
Step 1402: Use restriction information 1320<br>
on content to be played back is acquired by content<br>
management section 1201.<br>
Step 1403: Check value 1340 of use restriction<br>
information 1320 is checked. Playback processing<br>
is aborted in a case where check value 1340 is<br>
different from the predetermined value.<br>
Step 1404: Reference time and date updating<br>
section 1203 updates reference time and date<br>
information 1350.<br>
Step 1405: Playback approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 1204 judges whether content is<br>
allowable for playback or not. In a case where the<br>
playback of the content is judged as allowable, the<br>
processing goes to step 1406. If not, the playback<br>
processing is aborted.<br>
Step 1406: The content is acquired by content<br>
management section 1201.<br>
Next, the procedures for updating of reference<br>
time and date information 1350 by reference time<br>
and date updating section 1203 in step 1404 of FIG.<br>
14 is described below with reference to FIG. 15.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating the updating<br>
procedures of reference time and dace information<br>
1350.<br>
Step 1501: Reference time and date information<br>
1350 referred to by content to be played back is<br>
acquired by content management section 1201.<br>
Step 1502: Check value 1353 of reference time<br>
and dace information 1350 is checked. The processing<br>
for updating ;he reference time and date information<br>
is aborted in a case where check value 1353 is<br>
different from the predetermined value. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 1503.<br>
Step 1503: The value of reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352 is checked. In a case where the<br>
value of reference time and date validity flag 1352<br>
is "1", the processing goes to step 1504. If not,<br>
the processing goes to step 1505.<br>
Step 1504: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with reference time and date 1351. The<br>
processing for updating the reference time and date<br>
information is aborted in a case where current time<br>
and date 1220 is before reference time and date 1351.<br>
If not, the processing goes to step 1505.<br>
Step 1505: Allowed use start time and date<br>
validity flag 1332 is checked. In a case where the<br>
value of allowed use start time and date validity<br>
flag 1332 is "1", the processing goes to step 1506.<br>
If not, the processing goes to step 1507.<br>
Step 1506: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with allowed use start time and date 1331.<br>
In a case where current time and date 3220 is a time<br>
and date before allowed use start time and date 1331,<br>
the updating processing of the reference time and<br>
date information is ended. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 1507.<br>
Step 1507: Allowed use end time and date<br>
validity flag 1334 is checked. In a case where the<br>
value of allowed use end time and date validity flag<br>
13 3 4 is "1", the processing goes to step 1508. If<br>
not, the processing goes to step 1509.<br>
Step 1508: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with allowed use end time and date 1333.<br>
In a case where current time and date 1220 is a time<br>
and date after allowed use end time and date 1333,<br>
the updating processing of the reference time and<br>
date information is ended. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 1509.<br>
Step 1509: Reference time and date 1351 is<br>
overwritten with current time and date 1220.<br>
Step 1510: The value of reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352 is set into "1."<br>
Through the above steps, it is possible to<br>
update reference time and date information 1350 by<br>
using current time and date 1220.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given with an example case where reference time and<br>
date updating processing is carried out only in a<br>
case where current time and date 1220 is after allowed<br>
use start time and date 1331 but before allowed use<br>
end time and date 1333, however, it may be configured<br>
to update reference time and date 1341 always by<br>
using current time and date 1220 without taking into<br>
account the relation between current time and date<br>
1220 and allowed use start time and date 1331 as<br>
well as the relation between current time and date<br>
1220 and allowed use end time and date 1333. In such<br>
a configuration, steps 1505 through 1508 in FIG.<br>
15 are not necessary.<br>
In addition, herein, an explanation is given<br>
with an example case where reference time and date<br>
1351 is not subjected to rewriting in a case where<br>
current time and date 1220 is before reference time<br>
and date 1341, however, it may alternatively be<br>
configured so that reference time and date 1351 is<br>
always rewritten with current time and date 1220.<br>
In such a configuration, steps 1502 through 1504<br>
in FIG. 15 are not necessary.<br>
Furthermore, though an explanation is given<br>
herein on an example case where reference time and<br>
date 1351 is simply overwritten with current time<br>
and date 1220 in step 1503, reference time and date<br>
1351 may alternatively be overwritten with a time<br>
and date which is given after an addition of a certain<br>
time (e.g. one minute) onto current time and date<br>
1220 in step 1509. With such a configuration, it<br>
becomes possible to prevent unauthorized clock<br>
tampering such as one done in a case where reference<br>
time and date is kept at a constant time and date<br>
by adjusting current time and date into the same<br>
time of day as the reference time and date which<br>
has been stored.<br>
Next, the procedures of playback approval /<br>
disapproval judgment made by playback approval /<br>
disapproval judgment section 1204 in step 1405 of<br>
FIG. 14 is described below with reference to FIG.<br>
16. FIG. 16 is a flowchart illustrating the<br>
procedures of playback approval / disapproval<br>
judgment in playback approval / disapproval judgment<br>
section 1204.<br>
Step 1601: Reference time and date 1351 is<br>
compared with current time and date 12 2 0. In a case<br>
where current time and date 1220 is a time and date<br>
before reference time and date 1351, the processing<br>
goes to step 1605. If not, the processing goes to<br>
s tep 1602.<br>
Step 1602: Allowed use start time and date 1331<br>
is compared with current time and date 1220. In a<br>
case where current time and date 1220 is before<br>
allowed use start time and date 13 3 1, the processing<br>
goes to step 1605. If not, the processing goes to<br>
step 1603.<br>
Step 1603: Allowed use end time and date 1333<br>
is compared with current time and date 1220. In a<br>
case where current time and date 1220 is after allowed<br>
use end time and date 1333, the processing goes to<br>
step 1605. If not, the processing goes to step 1604.<br>
Step 1604: A judgment on playback is made as<br>
allowable .<br>
Step 1605: A judgment on playback is made as<br>
not allowable.<br>
Through the above procedures, it is possible<br>
to judge whether it is allowable or not to execute<br>
the playback of content which is subjected to<br>
checking of reference time and date and its use date.<br>
With such a configuration, it becomes possible to<br>
prevent an unauthorized playback of content which<br>
is done by tampering an internal clock of a content<br>
playback apparatus because the playback of the<br>
content becomes unallowable in a case where the<br>
internal clock of the content playback apparatus<br>
is set into a time and date before reference time<br>
and date.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given with an example case where check is made only<br>
as to whether current time and date 1220 is a time<br>
and date before reference time and date 1351 or not<br>
in step 1601, a concurrent check may be made in step<br>
1601 as to whether current time and date 1220 is<br>
after a time and date which is given after an addition<br>
of a certain time and date (e.g. one year) onto<br>
reference lime and date 1351. With such a<br>
configuration, it becomes possible not only to<br>
prevent an unauthorized viewing of content which<br>
is done by turning a clock back, but also to prevent<br>
an unauthorized viewing of the content which is done<br>
by setting the clock ahead deliberately.<br>
FIG. 17 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
the second storage format of content and its use<br>
restriction information in storage medium 1210 of<br>
FIG. 12.<br>
In FIG. 17, reference time and date information<br>
1350 further contains allowed reference time and<br>
date correction count 1354 and reference time and<br>
date correction count 1355. Allowed reference time<br>
and date correction count 1354 indicates the maximum<br>
number of times up to which reference time and date<br>
1351 is allowed to be rewritten even in a case where<br>
reference time and date 1351 is a time and date after<br>
the current time and date, and as its initial value,<br>
the number of times of, for example, "5" is given.<br>
Reference time and date correction count 1355<br>
records the number of times of occurrences of<br>
reference time and date corrections so far, and as<br>
its initial value, the value of, for example, "0"<br>
is given.<br>
With reference to FIG. 18, an explanation is<br>
given below on the procedures of updating reference<br>
time and date in a case where the configuration of<br>
FIG. 17 is adopted. FIG. 18 is a flowchart<br>
illustrating the updating procedures of reference<br>
time and date information 1350 having the<br>
configuration of FIG. 17.<br>
Step 1801: Reference time and date information<br>
1350 referred to by content to be played back is<br>
acquired by content management section 1201.<br>
Step 1802: Check value 13 53 of reference time<br>
and date information 1350 is checked. The processing<br>
for updating the reference time and date information<br>
is aborted in a case where check value 1353 is<br>
different from the predetermined value. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 1803.<br>
Step 1803: The value of reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352 is checked. In a case where the<br>
value of reference time and date validity flag 1352<br>
is "1", the processing goes to step 1804. If not,<br>
the processing goes to step 1806.<br>
Step 1804: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with reference time and date 1351. In a<br>
case where current time and date 1220 is before<br>
reference time and date 1351, the processing goes<br>
to step 1805. If not, the processing goes to step<br>
1806.<br>
Step 1805: In a case where reference time and<br>
date correction count 1355 is less than allowed<br>
reference time and date correction count 1354, the<br>
processing goes to step 1806. Otherwise the updating<br>
processing of reference time and date information<br>
is ended.<br>
Step 1806: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with allowed use start time and date 1331.<br>
In a case where current time and date 1220 is a time<br>
and date before allowed use start time and date 1331,<br>
the updating processing of the reference time and<br>
date information is ended. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 1807.<br>
Step 18C7: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with allowed use end time and date 1333.<br>
In a case where current time and date 1220 is a time<br>
and date after allowed use end time and date 1333,<br>
the updating processing of the reference time and<br>
date information is ended. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 1808.<br>
Step 1808: In a case where current time and<br>
date 1220 is before reference time and date 1351,<br>
reference time and date correction count 1355 is<br>
incremented by 1.<br>
Step 1809: Reference time and date 1351 is<br>
overwritten with current time and date 1220.<br>
Step 1810: The value of reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352 is set into "1."<br>
Through the above steps, at the time of updating<br>
reference time and dare information 1350 by using<br>
current time and date 1220, it becomes possible to<br>
overwrite the reference rime and date information<br>
forxibly with the current time and date up to the<br>
number of times given by allowed reference time and<br>
date correction count 1354. This allows a user to<br>
correct the reference time and date up to the allowed<br>
number of times even in a situation where the<br>
reference time and date has been updatedby the user' s<br>
erroneous setting of a clock into future time of<br>
day, and therefore, it is ensured that user<br>
convenience is not sacrificed.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given with an example case where reference time and<br>
date updating processing is carried out only in a<br>
case where current time and date 1220 is after allowed<br>
use start time and date 1331 but before allowed use<br>
end time and date 1333, however, it may be configured<br>
to update reference time and date 1341 always by<br>
using current time and date 1220 without taking into<br>
account the relation between current time and date<br>
1220 and allowed use start tine and date 1331 as<br>
well as the relation between current time and dare<br>
1220 and allowed use end time and date 1333. In such<br>
a configuration, steps 1806 and 1807 in FIG. 15 are<br>
not necessary.<br>
Furthermore, though an explanation is given<br>
herein on an example case where reference time and<br>
date 1351 is simply overwritten with current tine<br>
and date 1220 in step 1808, reference time and date<br>
1351 may alternatively be overwritten with a time<br>
and date which is given after an addition of a certain<br>
time (e.g. one minute) onto current time and date<br>
1220 in step 1808. With such a configuration, it<br>
becomes possible to prevent unauthorized clock<br>
tampering such as one done in a case where reference<br>
time and date is kept at a constant time and date<br>
by adjusting current time and date into the same<br>
time of day as the reference time and date which<br>
has been stored.<br>
It is noted that, in the present embodiment,<br>
it is assumed that the updating processing of<br>
reference time and date information 1350 is done<br>
at the time of playback of content, however, the<br>
updating processing of reference time and date<br>
information 1350 may be executed at any other point<br>
in time such as, for example, at the time of<br>
downloading the content.<br>
In addition, in the present embodiment, though<br>
an explanation is given by showing an example case<br>
where use restriction information and reference time<br>
and date information on content is stored in<br>
protective area, the use restriction information<br>
and the reference time and date information may be<br>
stored in data area in a case where there is no<br>
possibility of tampering Thereof, as in a case where<br>
the use restriction information and the reference<br>
time and date information has been subjected to<br>
encryption.<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment, though<br>
an explanation is given by showing an example case<br>
where content, its use restriction information, and<br>
reference time and date information is stored in<br>
a storage medium, it may be configured in such a<br>
way that the content, its use restriction<br>
information, and the reference time and date<br>
information is stored in any internal storage area<br>
of a content playback apparatus (such as in a hard<br>
disc) .<br>
By configuring a content playback apparatus<br>
as described above, without a need to refer to an<br>
external clock such as a server's on network, it<br>
becomes possible to prevent an unauthorized viewing<br>
of content which is done by the tampering of time<br>
of day, and to execute the playback of the content<br>
in compliance with a use time limit restriction<br>
designated by a concent distribution source.<br>
(Embodiment 4 )<br>
In Embodiment 4, an explanation is given on<br>
a case where reference time and date information<br>
is updated at the time of storing of content.<br>
FIG. 19 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
a content storage apparatus according to Embodiment<br>
4 of the present invention, where the apparatus<br>
stores content in storage medium 1210. This content<br>
storage apparatus comprises concent management<br>
section 1901, time reference section 1902, reference<br>
rime and date information updating section 19 0 3,<br>
and further comprises content reception section 1904<br>
chat receives content via a network.<br>
Time reference section 1902 acquires current<br>
time and date 1220. Time reference section 1902 is<br>
usually configured to acquire current time and date<br>
by referring to an internal clock held by the content<br>
storage apparatus, however, this section may be<br>
configured in such a way that it refers co any<br>
external clock alternatively, such as a GPS or a<br>
server connected via a network.<br>
Content management section 1901 stores content<br>
in storage medium 1210 and manages it. The<br>
configuration of storage medium 1210 as well as<br>
content and its use restriction information stored<br>
in storage medium 1210 are equivalent to those<br>
illustrated in FIG. 13 according to Embodiment 3.<br>
Content reception section 1904 receives<br>
content and its use restriction information from<br>
a content distribution server on a network, and<br>
passes it on to content management section 1901.<br>
In addition, content reception section 1904 receives<br>
distributor-side-current-time-and-date 1910<br>
concurrently at the same time of receiving the<br>
content and its use restriction information.<br>
Next, with reference to FIG. 20, an explanation<br>
is given on the procedures of content storage<br>
processing in a content storage apparatus of FIG.<br>
19. FIG. 20 is a flowchart illustrating the<br>
procedures of content storage processing in a<br>
content storage apparatus of FIG. 19.<br>
Seep 2001: Content reception section 1904<br>
receives content, its use restriction information,<br>
and distributor-side-current-time-and-date 1910.<br>
Step 2002 : Time reference section 1902 acquires<br>
current time and date 1220.<br>
Step 2003: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
compared with<br>
distributor-side-current-time-and-date 1910. In a<br>
case where distributor-side-current-time-and-date<br>
1910 is a time and date after current time and date<br>
1220, the processing goes to step 2004. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 2005.<br>
Step 2004: Current time and date 1220 is<br>
replaced with<br>
distributor-side-current-time-and-date 1910.<br>
Step 2005: The content and its use restriction<br>
information are respectively stored as content 1310<br>
and use restriction information 1320 in storage<br>
medium 1210.<br>
Step 2006: Reference time and date information<br>
1350 in storage medium 1210 is updated.<br>
The updating procedure of reference time and<br>
date information 1350 in step 2006 is equivalent<br>
to the procedure illustrated in FIG. 15 according<br>
to Embodiment 3.<br>
It is noted that, in content storage procedures<br>
illustrated in FIG. 20, an explanation is given with<br>
a configuration which is able to make correction<br>
in a case where current time and date 1220 is<br>
unreliable by comparing current time and date 1220<br>
with distributor-side-current-time-and-date 1910,<br>
and by taking the later time and date of the compared<br>
two as current time and date 1220, however, step<br>
2001, step 2003, and step 2004 may be omitted in<br>
a case where it is not possible to acquire<br>
distributor-side-current-time-and-date 1910 or in<br>
a case where current time and date 1220 acquired<br>
by time reference section 1902 is reliable enough.<br>
By implementing content storage in accordance<br>
with procedures as described above, it is possible<br>
to update reference time and date information 1350<br>
at the time of content storage.<br>
It is noted that, in this embodiment, though<br>
the configuration of storage medium 1210 is<br>
explained as equivalent to that illustrated in FIG.<br>
13, the configuration illustrated in FIG. 17 may<br>
be adopted. Even in such a configuration, the<br>
procedures of content storage are equivalent to<br>
those in the flowchart illustrated in FIG. 20. An<br>
exception is that the updating procedure of<br>
reference time and date information 1350 in step<br>
2006 is equivalent to the procedure illustrated in<br>
FIG. 18 according to Embodiment 3.<br>
In addition, in the present embodiment, though<br>
an explanation is given by showing an example case<br>
where use restriction information and reference time<br>
and date information on content is stored in<br>
protective area, the use restriction information<br>
and the reference time and date information may be<br>
stored in data area in a case where there is no<br>
possibility of tampering thereof, as in a case where<br>
the use restriction information and the reference<br>
time and date information has been subjected to<br>
encryption.<br>
Further in ore, in the present embodiment, though<br>
an explanation is given by shewing an example case<br>
where content, its use restriction information, and<br>
reference time and date information is stored in<br>
a storage medium, it may be configured in such a<br>
way that the content, its use restriction<br>
information, and the reference time and dare<br>
information is stored in any internal storage area<br>
of a content playback apparatus (such as in a hard<br>
disc) .<br>
By presenting a content storage apparatus as<br>
described above, it becomes possible to store<br>
reference time and date information so that even<br>
a content playback apparatus which is not provided<br>
with a function for updating the reference time and<br>
date information is able to comply with content use<br>
time limit by using the reference time and date<br>
information.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
In Embodiment 5, a content management apparatus<br>
which manages the moving and copying of content by<br>
using reference time and date information is<br>
explained.<br>
FIG. 21 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
a content management apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 5 of the present invention. This content<br>
management apparatus comprises reference time and<br>
date information updating section 2105 in addition<br>
to first content management section 2101, content<br>
retaining section 2102, second content management<br>
section 2103, content move / copy section 2104, and<br>
move / copy approval / disapproval judgment section<br>
2106.<br>
First content management section 2101 manages<br>
content and its use restriction information retained<br>
by content retaining section 2102 . Content retaining<br>
section 2102 is a storage medium such as a hard disc<br>
in a personal computer.<br>
Second content management section 2103 manages<br>
content stored in storage medium 1210. Storage<br>
medium 1210 has the same configuration as that<br>
illustrated in FIG. 13 according to Embodiment 3.<br>
FIG. 22 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
the storage format of content and ics use restriction<br>
information managed by content retaining section<br>
2102. Content and its use restriction information<br>
are retained in the same format in storage medium<br>
1210.<br>
Content move / copy section 2104 copies or moves<br>
content and its use restriction information retained<br>
in content retaining section 210 2 to storage medium<br>
1210, or copies or moves content and its use<br>
restriction information retained in storage medium<br>
1210 to content retaining section 2102.<br>
Reference time and date information updating<br>
section 2105 is a section that updates reference<br>
time and date information retained at content<br>
retaining section 2102, and reference time and date<br>
information retained at storage medium 1210.<br>
Move / Copy approval / disapproval judgment<br>
section 2106 judges whether content is allowable<br>
for copying cr moving or not.<br>
With reference to FIG. 23, an explanation is<br>
given on the procedures of content copy processing<br>
according to the present embodiment. FIG. 23 is a<br>
flowchart illustrating the procedures of content<br>
copy processing from content retaining section 2102<br>
to storage medium 1210 according to the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
Step 2301: Use restriction information 2220<br>
on content to be copied is acquired by content<br>
management section 2101.<br>
Step 2302: Check value 2240 of use restriction<br>
information 2220 is checked. Copy processing is<br>
aborted in a case where check value 2240 is different<br>
from the predetermined value. If not, the processing<br>
goes to step 2303.<br>
Step 2303: Move / Copy approval / disapproval<br>
judgment section 2106 judges whether content is<br>
allowable fcr copying or not. In a case where the<br>
copying of the content is judged as allowable, the<br>
processing goes to step 2304. If not, the copy<br>
processing is aborted.<br>
Step 2304: First content management section<br>
2101 acquires content and its use restriction<br>
information out of content retaining section 2102<br>
to pass the acquisitions on to second concent<br>
management section 2103.<br>
Step 2305: Second content management section<br>
2103 stores content and its use restriction<br>
information in storage medium 1210.<br>
Step 2306: Reference time and date information<br>
updating section 2105 updates reference time and<br>
date information 1350 in storage medium 1210.<br>
It is noted that, herein, an explanation is<br>
given by showing an example case where content is<br>
copied after having judged whether the copying of<br>
the content is allowable or not, however, it may<br>
be configured in such a way that the content is copied<br>
without judging the approval / disapproval of the<br>
copying of the content. In such a configuration,<br>
step 2303 in FIG. 23 i s may be omitted.<br>
In addition, though the procedures of content<br>
copying are explained here, in a case of content<br>
moving, it is enough if first content management<br>
section 2101 deletes the content arid its use<br>
restriction information retained at content<br>
retaining section 2102 after execution of step 2306.<br>
Next, the procedures for a move / copy approval<br>
/ disapproval judgment which is made by move / copy<br>
approval / disapproval judgment section 2106 in step<br>
2303 of FIG. 23 is described below with reference<br>
to FIG. 24. FIG. 24 is a flowchart illustrating the<br>
procedures for making a move / copy approval /<br>
disapproval judgment in move / copy approval /<br>
disapproval judgment section 2106.<br>
Step 2401: Reference time and date information<br>
2250 referred to by content in content retaining<br>
section 2102 which is to be moved / copied is<br>
acquired.<br>
Step 2402: Check value 2253 of reference time<br>
and date information 2250 is checked. In a case where<br>
check value 2253 is different from the predetermined<br>
value, the processing goes to step 2407. If not,<br>
the processing goes to step 2403.<br>
Step 2403: The value of reference time and date<br>
validity flag 2252 is checked. In a case where the<br>
value of reference time and date validity flag 2252<br>
is "1", the processing goes to step 2404. If net,<br>
the processing goes to step 2406.<br>
Step 2404: Allowed use end time and date<br>
validity flag 2234 is checked. In a case where the<br>
value of allowed use end time and date validity flag<br>
2234 is "1", the processing goes to step 2405. If<br>
not, the processing goes to step 2406.<br>
Step 2405: Reference time and date 2251 is<br>
compared with allowed use end time and date 2233.<br>
In a case where reference time and date 2251 is after<br>
allowed use end time and date 2233, the processing<br>
gees to step 2407. If not, the processing goes to<br>
step 2406.<br>
Step 2406: A judgment on moving / copying is<br>
made as allowable.<br>
Step 2407: A judgment on moving / copying is<br>
made as not allowable.<br>
Through the above procedures, while taking<br>
reference time and date information into<br>
consideration, it becomes possible not to allow<br>
content to be moved or copied without referring to<br>
current time and date in a case where reference time<br>
and date 22 5 1 is a time and date after allowed use<br>
end time and date 2233, in other words, in a case<br>
where the content is one whose time-limited use has<br>
expired. It is noted that, herein, though a check<br>
is done as tc whether the moving / copying is allowed<br>
or not by means of a use time limit only, an additional<br>
step such as, for example, a check by means of vacant<br>
capacity of a storage medium may be provided.<br>
Next, the procedures for "updating reference<br>
time and date information by reference time and date<br>
information updating section 2105 in step 2306 of<br>
FIG. 2 3 is described below with reference to FIG.<br>
25. FIG. 25 is a flowchart illustrating the<br>
procedures of updating reference time and date in<br>
reference time and date information updating section<br>
2105.<br>
Step 2501: Reference time and date information<br>
1350 in storage medium 1210 is acquired by second<br>
content management section 2203.<br>
Step 2502: Check value 1353 of reference time<br>
and date information 1350 is checked. The processing<br>
for updating the reference time and date information<br>
is aborted in a case where check value 1353 is<br>
different from the predetermined value. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 2503.<br>
Step 2503: Reference time and date information<br>
2250 retained at content retaining section 2102 is<br>
acquired by first content management section 2101.<br>
Step 2504: Check value 2253 of reference time<br>
and date information 2250 is checked. The processing<br>
for updating the reference time and date information<br>
is aborted in a case where check value 2253 is<br>
different from the predetermined value. If not, the<br>
processing gees to step 2505.<br>
Step 2505: Reference time and date validity<br>
flag 2252 is checked. In a case where the value of<br>
reference time and date validity flag 2252 is "1",<br>
the processing goes to step 2506. Otherwise the<br>
updating processing of reference time and date<br>
information is ended.<br>
Step 2506: Reference time and date validity<br>
flag 1352 is checked. In a case where the value of<br>
reference time and date validity flag 1352 is "1",<br>
the processing goes to step 2507. If not, the<br>
processing goes to step 2508.<br>
Step 2507: Reference time and date 2251 is<br>
compared with reference time and date 1351. In a<br>
case where current time and date 2251 is a time and<br>
date after reference time and date 1351, the<br>
processing goes to step 2508. Otherwise the updating<br>
processing of reference time and date information<br>
is ended.<br>
Step 2508: Reference time and date 1351 is<br>
overwritten with reference time and date 2251.<br>
Step 2509: The value of reference time and date<br>
validity flag 1352 is set into " 1 . "<br>
Through the above procedures, when moving or<br>
copying content, it becomes possible to store the<br>
later time and date, that is, reference time and<br>
date 2253 retained at content retaining section 2102<br>
or reference time and date 1353 retained at storage<br>
medium 1210, as reference time and date of storage<br>
medium 1210.<br>
It is noted that, it may be configured so that<br>
reference time and date 2251 is overwritten with<br>
reference time and date 1351 in a case where reference<br>
time and date 2251 is judged as a time and date before<br>
reference time and date 1351 in step 2507.<br>
In addition, provided that a content management<br>
apparatus according to the present embodiment is<br>
provided with means for referring to current time<br>
and date, it maybe configured so that, in step 2508,<br>
reference time and date 1352 of storage medium 1210<br>
is overwritten by the later time and date of current<br>
time and date and reference time and date 2251.<br>
With a content management apparatus configured<br>
as described above, it becomes possible to move<br>
content and its use time limit information from<br>
content retaining section 2102 to storage medium<br>
1210, and at the same time, to update reference time<br>
and date information in storage medium 1210. Because<br>
this allows the reference time and date information<br>
to be updated into the latest state, it is possible<br>
to prevent an unauthorized act of circumventing<br>
content viewing restrictions based on reference time<br>
and date by moving or copying content.<br>
It is noted that, herein, though an explanation<br>
is given with an example case where content and its<br>
use restriction information is copied or moved from<br>
content retaining section 2102 to storage medium<br>
1210, the copying or moving thereof from storage<br>
medium 1210 to content retaining section 2102 is<br>
also implementabie in accordance with the same<br>
procedures.<br>
(Embodiment 6)<br>
In Embodiment 6, an apparatus for correcting<br>
reference time and date is explained.<br>
FIG. 26 is a configuration diagram illustrating<br>
a reference time and date correction apparatus<br>
according to Embodiment 6 of the present invention.<br>
This apparatus comprises time reference section 2601<br>
and reference time and date correction section 2602.<br>
Time reference section 2601 provides a means<br>
for acquiring precise current time and date 2603,<br>
and this section is usually configured to acquire<br>
current time and date from a GPS, a reliable server<br>
on a network, etc.; not withstanding the foregoing,<br>
it may be configured so that time reference section<br>
2601 acquires current time and date by referring<br>
to an internal clock held by a reference time and<br>
date correction apparatus, provided that the<br>
internal clock is set into accurate time and date<br>
at its initial state, and that the apparatus is<br>
configured to make it impossible for a user to do<br>
the tampering thereof.<br>
Reference time and date correction section 2602<br>
is a section that updates reference time and date<br>
information stored in storage medium 1210. Storage<br>
medium 1210 has a configuration equivalent to that<br>
illustrated in FIG. 13 according to Embodiment 3,<br>
and content 1310, its use restriction information<br>
1320, and reference time and date information 1350<br>
is stored therein.<br>
Reference time and date correction section 2602<br>
overwrites reference time and date 1351 of reference<br>
time and date information 1350 in storage medium<br>
1210 with accurate current time and date 2603 which<br>
is acquired by time reference section 2601. At the<br>
same time, reference time and date correction<br>
section 2602 sets the value of reference time and<br>
date validity flag 1352 into "1" while setting the<br>
value of check value 1353 into the predetermined<br>
value .<br>
With a configuration of a reference time and<br>
date correction apparatus as described above, even<br>
in a situation where a user makes the erroneous<br>
time-of-day settings of a content playback apparatus<br>
or a content storage apparatus, and accordingly,<br>
where content playback is disallowed because of the<br>
wrong time and date setting of reference time and<br>
date information 1350 in storage medium 1210, it<br>
is possible to forcibly correct reference time and<br>
date information 1350 in storage medium 1210.<br>
It is noted that, a reference time correction<br>
apparatus according to the present embodiment may<br>
be incorporated as one function of a content playback<br>
apparatus according to Embodiment 3, a content<br>
storage apparatus according to Embodiment 4, and<br>
a content management apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 5.<br>
As described in each embodiment above, the<br>
content management method according to the present<br>
invention is, as illustrated in FIG. 27, a content<br>
management method that manages content and use<br>
restriction information indicating the terms of use<br>
for a user thereof in association with each other,<br>
where the use restriction information contains<br>
allowed use start time and date information<br>
indicating allowed use start time and date of the<br>
content, and/or allowed use end time and date<br>
information indicating allowed use end time and date<br>
of the content, and use time period information<br>
designating the length of a time period for allowable<br>
use of the content. According to this method, it<br>
is possible to set a use time limit on content<br>
flexibly .<br>
In addition, the content management method of<br>
the present invention is, as illustrated in FIG.<br>
28, devised so that the allowed use start time and<br>
date information and the allowed use end time and<br>
date information is updated based on a calculation<br>
result which is figured out of the use time period<br>
information in accordance with a predetermined<br>
manner in the above method. According to this method,<br>
it is possible to determine a use time limit by<br>
referring only to allowed use start time and date<br>
information and allowed use end time and date<br>
information.<br>
In addition, the content management method of<br>
the present invention is, as illustrated in FIG.<br>
28, devised so chat the use time period information<br>
further contains a use time period processing flag,<br>
where the value of the use time period processing<br>
flag is updated after the updating of the allowed<br>
use start time and date information and the allowed<br>
use end time and date information in the above method.<br>
According to this method, it is possible to confirm<br>
by means of a use time period processing flag whether<br>
allowed use start time and date information and<br>
allowed use end time and date information has been<br>
updated by means of use time period information or<br>
not.<br>
In addition, the content management method of<br>
the present invention is, as illustrated in FIG.<br>
29, devised so that, in the updating of the allowed<br>
use start time and date information and the allowed<br>
use end time and date information, a rewriting is<br>
done with current time and date as allowed use start<br>
time and date, whereas a rewriting is done with a<br>
time and date which is given after an addition of<br>
the use time period information onto the current<br>
time and date as allowed use end time and date in<br>
the above method.<br>
In addition, the content management method<br>
according to the present invention is, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 30, a content management method<br>
that manages content and use restriction information<br>
in association with each other, the use restriction<br>
information indicating the terms of use for a user<br>
thereof, where the use restriction information<br>
contains allowed use start time and date information<br>
indicating allowed use start time and date of the<br>
content, and/or allowed use end time and date<br>
information indicating allowed use end time and date<br>
of the content, and use time period information<br>
designating the length of a time period for allowable<br>
use of the content, and in such a method, in the<br>
updating of the allowed use start time and date<br>
information and the allowed use end time and date<br>
information, a rewriting is done with current time<br>
and date as the allowed use start time and date,<br>
whereas a rewriting is done with a time and date<br>
which is given after an addition of the use time<br>
period information onto the current time and date<br>
as the allowed use end time and date only in a case<br>
where the time and date given after the addition<br>
of the use time period information onto the current<br>
time and date is a time and date before the allowed<br>
use end time and date.<br>
In addition, the content management method<br>
according to the present invention is, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 31, a content management method<br>
that manages content and use restriction information<br>
in association with each other, the use restriction<br>
information indicating the terms of use for a user<br>
thereof, where the use restriction information<br>
contains allowed use start time and date information<br>
indicating allowed use start time and date of the<br>
content, and/or allowed use end time and date<br>
information indicating allowed use end time and date<br>
of the content, and use time period information<br>
designating the length of a time period for allowable<br>
use of the content, and in such a method, the allowed<br>
use start time and date information and the allowed<br>
use end time and date information is updated based<br>
on a calculation result which is figured out of the<br>
use time period information in accordance with a<br>
predetermined manner, where the updating is done<br>
only in a case where current time and date is after<br>
allowed use start time and date designated by the<br>
use date information but before allowed use end time<br>
and date designated by the use date information.<br>
According to this method, it is possible to interpret<br>
use date appropriately by preventing the rewriting<br>
of date with a time and date not within the use date.<br>
In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 32, the<br>
content playback apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is a content playback apparatus that plays<br>

by configuring in such a manner that the updating<br>
of reference time and date information is executed<br>
only in a case where current time and date is a time<br>
and date after the reference time and date<br>
information, it is possible to prevent an<br>
unauthorized tampering of a clock such as one done<br>
in a case where the reference time and date<br>
information is made practically invalid by turning<br>
reference time and date back.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present<br>
invention, with a configuration where reference time<br>
and date information contains allowed reference time<br>
and date correction count and reference time and<br>
date correction count, and where the reference time<br>
and date information is allowed to be updated with<br>
current time and date even if the current time and<br>
date is a time and date before reference time and<br>
date in a case where the reference time and date<br>
correction count does not exceed the allowed<br>
reference time and date correction count, it is<br>
possible to update the reference time and date in<br>
a situation where a user makes erroneous clock<br>
setting, and so it is ensured that user convenience<br>
is not sacrificed.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention,<br>
it is possible to prevent the tampering of use<br>
restriction information or to detect whether it has<br>
been tampered or not by storing use restriction<br>
information and reference time and date information<br>
into a protective area, encrypted if necessary, and<br>
by having a check value for the detection of a<br>
tampe ring.<br>
