				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
ACTIVATOR OF PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR 5<br>
[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to an activator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor 8.<br>
[Prior art]<br>
The peroxisome is a small organ present in cells of animals and plants, and its matrix contains various enzymes such as catalases. Various compounds such as f i-brates, herbicides, and phthalic acid plasticizers are known as peroxisome proliferators which induce proliferation of peroxisomes.<br>
Isseman, et al. have identified a nuclear receptor which is activated by peroxisome proliferator and called<br>
it peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR).  	<br>
Nature, 347, p64'5-650, 1990.<br>
Three subtypes such as PPARoc, PPARy and PPAR5 have<br>
been identified.  	 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91,<br>
p7335-7359, 1994.<br>
The above-mentioned fibrates used as the serum triglyceride (TG) lowering drug can modulates PPARS activity.  Further, thiazolidine compounds (Troglitazone, Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone) useful in the treatment of diabetes are also known as ligands of PPARy.<br>
It is reported that several compounds such as GW-2433 (Glaxo Wellcome), L-165041 (Merck), and YM-16638 (Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical) activate PPARS.  Each formula is as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>
WO 92/10468 describes that GW-2433 can be employable for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.<br>
WO 97/28115 describes that L-165041 can be employable for treatment of diabetes and suppression of obesity.<br>
WO 99/04815 describes that YM-16638 shows effects for reducing serum cholesterol and reducing LDL cholesterol.<br>
Recently, JBC, 272(6), p3406-3410, 1997 and Cell, 99, p335-345, 1999 describe proposal for application of PPAR 8 ligand as an anti-cancer agent and an anti-inflammatory agent.<br>
European Patent 558 062 describes the following compound A which has a structure similar to that of the general formula (I) [mentioned below] representing a compound of the invention:<br><br><br>
All of the "compounds identified by the compound A, compound B and the general formula (I) of the invention may be described as compounds of phenoxyacetic acid type. However, there are clear structural differences between the compounds A, B and the compound of the invention.  For example, the phenoxy group of the compounds A, B has the propyl group substituted with the oxazolyl group or the ethoxy group substituted with the oxazolyl group, while the compound of the invention has the propionyl group substituted with the oxazolyl group or the like.  Further, the oxazole ring of the compounds A, B has only one of the ethyl group or the phenyl group, while the compound of the invention may have both of the groups.<br>
In addition, while the above-mentioned EP 558 062 teaches that the compound A is of value for treatment of hyperthrombinemia and as blood pressure depressant, no<br><br>
mention is given with respect to an effect as PPARS li-gand.<br>
Further, while the J. Immunol. Methods teaches the use of the compound B as blood pressure depressant, there is no  concrete description to teach that the compound is effective as PPAR5 ligand.<br>
Recently, WO 01/40207 describes a substituted oxa (thia)zole derivative showing an agonist action for PPARct, and WO 01/16120 describes an oxa (thia) zole derivative substituted with a biaryl group which is employable as a PPAR controlling agent.<br>
In comparison with the compounds of the invention, the compound of WO 01/40207 has C(=0)NH as X and an al-kylene chain bond as Y, and the compound of WO 01/16120 has an alkylene chain as X and 0, X or the like as Y. Accordingly, the structural difference is clear.<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.2001, Apr.24; 98(9): 5306-11, and WO01/00603 describe that the following compound GW-501516 has a highly selective agonist action for PPARct.<br><br>
There is a clear structural difference between the GW-501516 and the compound of the invention, that is, GW-501516 has the methyl group as X of the present invention, and S as Y.<br><br>
Further, each of WO 02/14291 (Nippon Chemiphar Co., Ltd.) and WO 02/50048 (GLAXO) discloses a compound having an agonist action of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor. WO 02/50048 describes synthetic intermediates such as ethyl[2-methyl-4-(3-(4-methyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-5-<br>
yl)propanoyl)phenoxy]acetic acid, ethyl[2-methyl-4- ( (4-me thy1-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)acetyl)phenoxy]acetic acid, ethyl[4-(1-hydroxy-3- (4-methyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)propyl)-2-methylphenoxy]acetic acid, ethyl[4-(1-hydroxy-2-(4-methyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)ethyl) -2-methylphenoxy]acetic acid.<br>

(Pharmacological experimetnt 1) I.   Method<br>
(1)  Measurement of PPARa, y, 8 transactivation activity<br>
PPARa, y,   8 transactivation activity of each compound<br>
[Examples 1-8 and known PPAR8 agonist (L-16504: Berger, J., et al. (1999), J. Biol. Chem., 274:6718-6725)] was measured in the manner described below.<br>
1)	Material<br>
CV-1 cells were obtained from Tohoku University Aging Medical Laboratory, Medical Cell Collection Center. All test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).  Final concentration of DMSO was 0.1%.<br>
2)	Plasmid<br>
Receptor expression plasmid (GAL4-hPPARa, LBD GAL4-hPPARy LBD, GAL4-hPPAR8 LBD), Reporter plasmid (UASx4-TK-LUC), and p-galactosidase expression plasmid (PGAL) similar to Kliewer, S.A., et al., ((1992) Nature, 358:771-774) were used.<br>
3)	Transfeetion<br>
CV-1 cells were seeded in 24 well culture plates at 2xl05 cells per well, and cultured for 24 hours OPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies, 500 pL/well) containing 4%-fetal bovine serum (FBS). After washing with OPTI-MEM, transfection mixture (250 pL/well) con-<br><br>
taining 0.03 pg of GAL4-hPPAR§ LBD, 0.25 pg of UASx4-TK-LUC, 0.35 pg of PGAL, and 2 pL of lipofection reagent, DMRIE-C (Life Technologies) were added.  The cells were incubated for 5 hours at 37°C.<br>
4)	Cell treatment by addition of test compound<br>
The cells were washed and incubated for 40 hours in the presence of the test compound (final concentration was 10~7M or 10"6M).<br>
5)	Measurement of the level of reporter gene expression<br>
The culture medium was removed and the cells were<br>
washed with PBS twice. A solubilizing buffer (100 pL/well) containing 25 mM Tris-P04 (pH 7.8), 15%v/v glycerol, 2% CHAPS, 1% Lecithin, 1% BSA, 4 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT was added. After the incubation for<br>
10 minutes at room temperature, a portion (20 pL) of the solution was transferred into a 96-well plate.  Subsequently, 100 pL of luciferase substrate solution (Pic-cagene: available from Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) was added, and a luminous intensity per one second (luciferase* activity) was measured using a microluminoreader (Type MLR-100, Corona Electrics Co., Ltd.). Each luciferase ac-tivety was corrected by the transfection efficiency which was calculated from p-galactosidase activity.  The assay method of p-galactosidase activity was as follows: A portion (50 pL) of the solubilized sample was transferred into another 96-well plate; 100 pL of ONPG (2-nitrophenyl-p-galactopyranoside) solution was added and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.  50 pL of a reaction stopping solution (IM sodium carbonate solution) was added. Then the absorbance at 414 nm was measured.<br>
A relative PPAR activity was calculated as follows: D% (luciferase activity of cells treated with DMSO (0.1%) alone), 100% (luciferase activity of cells treated with a<br><br>
control   (PPARct:   1CT4   M  WY-165041,    PPARy:   10"5  M  Rosiglita-zone,   PPAR8:   10"4   M  L-165041)).<br>
II.   Results<br>
The results are shown in Table 8.<br><br>
Relative activities for PPAR transactivation were shown.<br>
Each value represents as % of control.  Cells were cultured in the presence of compounds at 10"7 M except Example 1 (1CT6 M) . Positive control:<br>
a:   10~4 M WY-14643<br>
y:   10"5 M Rosiglitazone<br>
5:   10"4 M L-165041<br><br>
It is clear that the compounds of Examples have PPA transactivation activity similar to or more potent than L-165041.<br>
(Example 52) (Pharmacological tests 2)<br>
PPAR transactivation activities of the compounds of Examples 9-50 were assayed in the same manner as described in Example 51. The results are shown in Table 9.<br><br><br><br><br>
Relative activities for PPAR transactivation were 5  shown.<br>
Each value represents as % of control.  Cells were cultured in the presence of compounds at 1CT7 M except the compounds that the values are given in parentheses (for example, Example 44 etc.).  Those compounds were assayed 10  at 1CT6 M.<br><br>
NT or (NT) means "not tested". Positive control:<br>
a:   10~4 M WY-14643<br>
y:   10~5 M Rosiglitazone<br>
5:   10~4 M L-165041<br>
It is clear from Table 9 that the compounds of Examples 9-50 have potent PPAR5 transactivation activities. It is also clear from Tables 8 &amp; 9 that the compound of the formula (I) wherein R2 is methyl (Example 44) is inferior in the PPARS transactivation activity to the other compounds of the formula (I) wherein R2 is ethyl (Example 47 etc.), isopropyl (Example 3 etc.), or hexyl (Example 11 etc.).  Therefore, the alkyl group of R2 preferably has two or more carbon atoms.<br>

HDL cholesterol elevating effect was measured by using db/db mice, which are hereditary obesity mice. The db/db mice (10 weeks old) were divided into groups based on serum HDL cholesterol levels. Each of the compounds of the present invention (compounds synthesized in Examples 4 and 10) and GW-501516 was orally administered for one week twice daily. Mice of the control group (to which no agent was administered) were orally given 1% methyl cellulose solution. After 16 hours from the final administration, blood sample was collected, and serum HDL cholesterol level was measured.  HDL cholesterol was separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels (Choi/Trig Combo, Helena Laboratories).  Serum total cholesterol levels were measured enzymaticallly using a kit (Pure Auto, Daiichi '<br><br>
Chemicals) by an automatic analyzer (7060E type, Hitachi Ltd.). HDL cholesterol levels were calculated from total cholesterol levels and HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol ratios.<br>
II.  Results<br>
Serum HDL cholesterol levels of experiments groups are shown in Table 10.  Each value represents as % of the control group.<br><br>
As shown in Table 10, compounds of the present invention raised serum HDL cholesterol significantly.  It is clear that they have potent HDL cholesterol elevating effect .<br>
Therefore, the compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of dyslipidemia.<br><br><br>
