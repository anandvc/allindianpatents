				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR IMPLANTING AN OCULAR IMPLANT AT A<br>
LOCATION IN A PATIENT'S EYE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to methods andlapparatus for delivering solid or<br>
semi-solid materials into the eye. Specifically, the methods and apparatus can be used to<br>
introduce implants containing therapeutic or active agents, including bioerodible implants,<br>
into various locations within the eye, including the vitreous of the eye.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] A primary difficulty in treating diseases of the eye is the inability to introduce<br>
drugs or therapeutic agents into the eye and maintain these drugs or agents at a therapeutically<br>
effective concentration in the eye for the necessary duration. Systemic administration may<br>
not be an ideal solution because, often, unacceptably high levels of systemic dosing are<br>
needed to achieve effective intraocular concentrations, with the increased incidence of<br>
unacceptable side effects of the drugs. Simple ocular instillation or application is not an<br>
acceptable alternative in many cases because the drug may be quickly washed out by tear-<br>
action or is otherwise depleted from within the eye into the general circulation.<br>
Suprachoroidal injections of drug solutions have also been performed, but again the drug<br>
availability is short-lived. Such methods make it difficult to maintain therapeutic levels of<br>
drug for adequate time periods.<br>
[0003] Efforts to address this problem have lead to the development of drug delivery<br>
devices, or implants, which can be implanted into the eye such that a controlled amount of<br>
desired drug can be released constantly over a period of several days, or weeks, or even<br>
months. Many such devices have been previously reported. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,853,224, which discloses biocompatible implants for introduction into an anterior segment<br>
or posterior segment of an eye for the treatment of an ocular condition. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,164,188 discloses a method of treating an ocular condition by introduction of a<br>
biodegradable implant comprising drugs of interest into the suprachoroidal space or pars<br>
plana of the eye. See also U.S. Patents Nos. 5,824,072, 5,476,511,4,997,652,4,959,217,<br>
4,668,506, and 4,144,317. Other methods include anchoring a plug or tack containing a drug<br>
into the sclera of the eye (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,233).<br>
[0004] Various sites exist in the eye for implantation of a drug delivery device or implant,<br>
such as the vitreous of the eye, anterior or posterior chambers of the eye, or other areas of the<br>
eye including intraretinal, subretinal, intrachoroidal, suprachoroidal, intrascleral, episcleral,<br>
subconjunctival, intracomeal or epicomeal spaces. Wherever the desired location of<br>
implantation, typical methods of implantation all require relatively invasive surgical<br>
procedures, pose a risk of excessive trauma to the eye, and require excessive handling of the<br>
implant. For example, in a typical method for placement in the vitreous, an incision is made<br>
through the sclera, and the implant is inserted into and deposited at the desired location in the<br>
vitreous, using forceps or other like manual grasping device. Once deposited, the forceps (or<br>
grasping device) is removed, and the incision is sutured closed. Alternatively, an incision can<br>
be made through the sclera, a trocar can be advanced through the incision and then the<br>
implant can be delivered through the trocar. Similar methods can be employed to deliver<br>
implants to other locations, e.g., implantation in the anterior chamber of the eye through an<br>
incision in the cornea.<br>
[0005] The drawbacks of such techniques for implant delivery are many-fold. Extensive<br>
handling of the implant is necessitated in these techniques, creating a risk that the implant will<br>
be damaged in the process. Many such implants are polymer-based and are relatively fragile.<br>
If portions of such implants are damaged and broken-off, the effective therapeutic dose<br>
delivered by the implant once placed will be significantly altered. In addition, it becomes<br>
inherently difficult using these methods to achieve reproducible placement from patient to<br>
patient. Also of import is that fact that all such techniques require an incision or puncture in<br>
the eye large enough to require suturing. Thus such techniques are typically performed in a<br>
surgical setting.<br>
[0006] There thus remains a need for a more facile, convenient, less invasive, and less<br>
traumatic means for delivering implants into the eye. There also remains a need for a more<br>
controlled means of delivering implants into the eye.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
(0007] The present invention meets these and other needs and provides methods and<br>
apparatus for easily, safely, and more precisely delivering an implant into the eye.<br>
[0008] In one aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided having an elongate<br>
housing with a cannula extending longitudinally from the housing. The cannula includes a<br>
lumen extending through the length of the cannula, such that an ocular implant can be<br>
received within the cannula lumen. A plunger having a push rod is also received within the<br>
cannula lumen and is capable of movement from a first to second position within the lumen.<br>
A linkage is provided having a moveable end engageable with the plunger, and a fixed end<br>
secured to the housing. The moveable end of the linkage is capable of movement from a first<br>
to second position relative to the housing upon application to the linkage of a force normal to<br>
the housing axis. When such a force is applied the plunger moves from the first to the second<br>
position within the cannula, forcing an implant retained within the cannula to be ejected.<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, the apparatus further includes an actuating lever with one end<br>
pivotally mounted within mounted the housing and the other end of the lever engaged with the<br>
linkage. The actuating lever can further be configured for manual accession, such that manual<br>
depression of the lever against the linkage provides the force normal to the housing axis<br>
which causes translational motion of the moveable end of the linkage along the housing axis<br>
and subsequent movement of the plunger and ejection of the implant. The linkage, itself can<br>
further include a series of flexibly joined segments.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, the apparatus includes a linkage that includes one or more<br>
flexible bow elements. The bow element or elements can further include a portion or portions<br>
that extend from the housing for manual accession, such that manual depression of the portion<br>
or portions provides the normal force to the housing axis to cause translational motion of the<br>
linkage.<br>
[0011 ] In a further embodiment, the apparatus includes an actuating lever operably linked<br>
to a linkage comprising a cam assembly. The actuating lever can be oriented for movement in<br>
a direction normal to the housing axis and can be further configured for manual accession.<br>
Manual depression of the lever causes rotation of the cam assembly about a fixed pivot point<br>
resulting in engagement of the cam assembly with the plunger and subsequent movement of<br>
the plunger to eject the implant.<br>
[0012] In yet another embodiment, the cannula is further configured to have an outer<br>
diameter of 0.032 inches or less. In further embodiments, the cannula is configured to have<br>
an outer diameter of 0.028 inches or less or 0.025 inches or less. Alternatively, in cases where<br>
the cannula has a non-circular cross-section, the cannula can have a cross-sectional area of up<br>
to 0.0008 square inches or more, depending on the particular cross-sectional geometry.<br>
Cannulas having such configurations are able to receive and deliver smaller ocular implants,<br>
i.e., so-called microimplants.<br>
[0013] The invention also provides methods of delivery of an implant to a location of the<br>
eye. Various sites exist in the eye for implantation of a drug delivery device or implant, such<br>
as the vitreous of the eye, anterior or posterior chambers of the eye, or other areas of the eye<br>
including intraretinal, subretinal, intrachoroidal, suprachoroidal, intrascleral, episcleral,<br>
subconjunctival, intracorneal or epicomeal spaces. In one aspect of the invention, a cannula is<br>
used having an outer diameter of 0.032 inches or less. In other aspects of the invention, a<br>
cannula is used having an outer diameter of 0.028 inches or less or 0.025 inches or less. In<br>
yet another aspect of the invention, in cases where the cannula has a non-circular cross-<br>
section, the cannula has a cross-sectional area of up to 0.0008 square inches or more,<br>
depending on the particular cross-sectional geometry. The use of cannulas having such cross-<br>
sectional dimensions allows for self-sealing methods of implant delivery.<br>
[0014] Accordingly, in one embodiment, a method of delivering an ocular microimplant<br>
into a patient's eye is provided which involves providing a cannula having a distal sharpened<br>
tip, lumen extending through the cannula, a microimplant that can be retained within the<br>
lumen, and a push rod that can be received through a proximal end of the cannula. The<br>
cannula is then used to puncture through the outer layer of a patient's eye with the cannula and<br>
inserted to a desired location within the patient's eye or is otherwise advanced to a desired<br>
location in a patient's eye. Once the cannula is positioned, the push rod is moved from the<br>
proximal end of the cannula toward the distal end of the cannula, thereby ejecting the<br>
microimplant from the cannula. After ejection, the cannula and push rod are removed from<br>
the patient's eye. In certain aspects, where cannulas having particular cross-sectional<br>
geometries are used, the puncture created by the insertion of the cannula into the patient's eye<br>
is self-sealing upon the removal of the cannula. Particular orientations of the cannula during<br>
insertion can aid in self-sealing. The cannula tip can further be configured to have particular<br>
beveled designs which further aid in the self-sealing method. Alternatively, methods of<br>
' delivery are also contemplated where the resultant puncture is not self-sealing but can be<br>
sealed using known methods.<br>
[0015] While the delivery apparatus according to the invention facilitates the inventive<br>
method of delivering an ocular microimplant, it is not necessary to the practice of inventive<br>
method. For example, one skilled in the art can also use a needle and plunger assembly,<br>
where the needle has dimensions corresponding to the described cannula.<br>
[0016] The methods and apparatus of the invention provide numerous advantages, not<br>
least of which is providing for an easier, convenient, and less traumatic means for delivering<br>
implants into the eye. In certain embodiments, the self-sealing means of implant delivery can<br>
be achieved, which in addition to being less invasive and traumatic, offers less costly<br>
treatment by obviating the need for performing the procedure in a surgical setting.<br>
[0017] The methods and apparatus of the invention also provide for a more controlled<br>
means of delivering implants into the eye. In particular, embodiments of the inventive<br>
apparatus are designed to provide a smooth, controlled delivery of the implant. Additional<br>
embodiments provide for safety features which include, among other things, user feedback<br>
upon the ejection of an implant and locking mechanisms which prevent backflow of eye fluid<br>
after ejection and/or which also prevent reuse of the applicator. Another advantage of the<br>
inventive apparatus is ease and flexibility of manufacture and assembly of apparatuses for<br>
delivery of different implants.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0036] An embodiment of an implant delivery apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is depicted in FIGS. 1-9. As shown, implant delivery apparatus 10 includes external<br>
housing 20 with nose cone 30 attached to and extending from the housing. Cannula 40,<br>
having beveled tip 41, extends from the nose cone. Ejector button 50 extends through<br>
opening 52 of the housing. As described further herein, an implant can be loaded into the<br>
cannula and the apparatus can be readily manipulated to introduce the cannula into a patient's<br>
eye at a desired location. Depression of the ejector button actuates the apparatus, and causes<br>
the ejection of the implant into the patient's eye.<br>
[0037] As used herein, "implants" refers to ocular implants or drug delivery devices<br>
which can be implanted into any number of locations in the eye, and which are designed such<br>
that a controlled amount of desired drug or therapeutic can be released over time. Such<br>
implants, which can be solid or semi-solid, are biocompatible, and in many but not all cases<br>
are formed of a bioerodible substance, such as a bioerodible polymer. "Microimplants" refers<br>
to implants having a sufficiently small cross-sectional area that they can be delivered by<br>
methods and/or apparatus according to the invention that result in self-sealing of the eye at the<br>
puncture site associated with the delivery. In particular, such microimplants have dimensions<br>
such that they are deliverable through 21 gauge or 22 gauge or smaller gauge cannulas. Thin<br>
wall versions of 21 gauge needles can be manufactured having inner diameters of up to 0.028<br>
inches, thus cylindrical microimplants deliverable through such sized cannulas will have outer<br>
diameters of less than 0.028 inches. Thin wall versions of 22 gauge needles can have inner<br>
diameters of up to 0.023 inches, and thus cylindrical microimplants with diameters of less<br>
than 0.023 inches will be deliverable through such sized cannulas. Microimplants can also<br>
have non-circular cross-sectional geometries for delivery through cannulas having<br>
corresponding cross-sectional geometries. Where the micro-implant has non-circular cross-<br>
section, the cross-sectional area may be up to 0.00025 square inches or more, depending on<br>
the particular cross-sectional geometry.<br>
[0038] As used herein, "self sealing" methods of delivering microimplants into the eye<br>
refers to methods of introducing microimplants through a cannula and into desired locations<br>
of a patient's eye without the need for a suture, or other like closure means, at the cannula<br>
puncture site. Such "self sealing" methods do not require that the puncture site completely<br>
seal immediately upon withdrawal of the cannula, but rather that any initial leakage is<br>
minimum and dissipates in short order such that a surgeon or another equally skilled in the art,<br>
in his or her good clinical judgment, would not be compelled to suture or otherwise provide<br>
other like closure means to the puncture site.<br>
[0039] The apparatus is ergonomically configured for easy gripping and manipulation,<br>
and has a general overall shape similar to a conventional pen or other writing instrument. The<br>
apparatus will typically be grasped by the user between the thumb and the middle finger.<br>
Tactile ridges 22 are provided on the housing, in the areas around the ejector button where the<br>
thumb and middle finger of the user are contact the apparatus, to provide a more secure grip<br>
and feel to the user. Ejector button 50 itself is provided with tactile grooves 53 on the button<br>
surface where the index finger typically contacts the button, also providing for a more secure<br>
grip and feel for the user.<br>
[0040] As shown more clearly in FIG. 4, nose cone 30 can be manufactured as a separate<br>
piece that is then secured to the housing. Specifically, collar 24 extends from the housing as<br>
shown. Nose cone 30 is configured for receipt over and attachment to the collar.<br>
[0041] As seen in FIG. 5, nose cone 30 receives cannula assembly 42 which consists of<br>
cannula 40 and cannula hub 44. The hub is configured for receipt and securement within nose<br>
cone 30, with cannula 40 extending through nose cone hole 32. The cannula lumen is in<br>
communication with inner passageway 43 of the hub, such that implant 1 can be passed<br>
through the inner passageway of the hub and loaded into the cannula lumen. Plunger 46<br>
includes push rod 48 and cone 49. Push rod 48 is configured for slidable receipt within the<br>
cannula lumen, and is of sufficient length to displace a loaded implant retained with the<br>
cannula lumen and eject it from the cannula tip.<br>
[0042] Referring to FIG. 6, it can be seen that housing 20 is formed of two half sections<br>
21 and 22. These sections are preferably configured to snap-fit together, although other<br>
known methods of attaching the two halves together are contemplated, including, e.g., gluing,<br>
welding, fusing, etc. Alternatively, the housing could be singularly molded. Label plate 23 is<br>
also provided, which likewise can be snapped onto or otherwise secured to, the housing.<br>
Nose cone 30 can be secured to collar 24 of housing 20 by similar means.<br>
[0043] Actuating lever 52 and linkage 60 are retained within housing 20. As seen in<br>
FIGS. 6 and 8, actuating lever 52 consists of elongate member 54 having pins 55, 56<br>
extending from the member at one end and ejector button 50 extending from the other end.<br>
Pins 55, 56 extend along a common axis and are received in corresponding pivot holes 26 of<br>
the housing sections, such that when assembled, the lever can pivot about the pins in a<br>
restricted range of motion within the housing.<br>
[0044] Linkage 60, as seen more clearly seen in FIG.. 7, consists of front and rear blocks<br>
61 and 62, with a plurality of joined segments 63 extending therebetween. The segments are<br>
sequentially joined to one another. Flexible joints 64 connect the segments to each other and<br>
to the front and rear blocks. The linkage is flexible yet resilient, and preferably formed of a<br>
contiguous, moldable plastic piece. Portions of the linkage having a relatively thin cross-<br>
sectional area of material form flexible joints 64, and disposed between thicker, less flexible<br>
segments 63. This allows for flexure of the linkage at the joint locations when a force is<br>
applied to the linkage. Other known materials are also suitable for the linkage, including e.g.<br>
shape memory alloys, provided the resultant linkage is capable of lengthwise extension when<br>
a force normal to or perpendicular to the length of the linkage is applied.<br>
[0045] When assembled, rear block 62 is fixedly secured into slot 27 of the housing, as<br>
shown in FIG. 6, and more clearly in FIGS. 9 and 10. Guide pins 65,66 extend from front<br>
block 61 and are received in guide track 28. Guide track 28 is defined by guide ribs 29,29<br>
that extend inwardly from collar 24. Cone 49 of plunger 46 abuts against front block 61 of the<br>
linkage. Alternatively, the linkage-plunger assembly can be integrally formed as a single unit.<br>
The linkage, guide track, plunger, cannula, and implant (if loaded within the cannula) are all<br>
aligned along the longitudinal axis of the apparatus.<br>
[0046] As can be seen, the underside of button 50 of actuating lever 52 is in contact with<br>
the linkage (FIG. 9A). In operation, depression of button 50 by the user transmits force<br>
against the linkage through underside of button 50 in a direction generally normal to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the apparatus. This force is transmitted through the linkage, and is<br>
converted into a longitudinal force along the longitudinal axis of the apparatus, through<br>
flexure of the linkage joints. Because the rear block end of the linkage remains fixed to the<br>
housing, this action results in translational motion of the free, front block end of the linkage in<br>
the direction away from the fixed rear block of the linkage. This translational movement of<br>
the front block of the linkage in turn pushes push rod 46 through the lumen of cannula 40.<br>
Where an implant is loaded and retained within the cannula lumen, the motion of the push rod<br>
in turn ejects the implant from the cannula tip (FIG. 9B).<br>
[0047] Button 50 also includes tab 57, which is engageable with lab slot 58 of the<br>
housing. The tab includes a detent which, when engaged in slot 58 will provide an audible<br>
click, signaling the user that the implant has been deployed, and will also retain the actuating<br>
lever in a locked, depressed condition, after deployment of the implant.<br>
[0048| A second embodiment of an implant delivery apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is depicted in FIGS. 10-11. In this embodiment, implant delivery apparatus 110<br>
includes housing 120 with actuator 170 disposed within the housing. The actuator includes<br>
linkage 160 formed of two opposing flexible bowing elements 165 and 166. Ridges 171 and<br>
172 are provided on the apexes of the bowing elements, and portions of the bowing elements<br>
that include ridges 171 and 172, extend through openings 124 and 125 of the housing.<br>
Cannula assembly 142 is secured to the housing. As with the previous embodiment, an<br>
implant can be likewise loaded into the cannula. Depression of bowing elements 165 or 166<br>
actuates the apparatus, causing the ejection of the implant from the cannula, as will be further<br>
detailed.<br>
[0049] Housing 120 is formed of two sections, upper and lower housing sections 121 and<br>
122, that can be assembled as previously described above with respect to the embodiment of<br>
FIGS. 1-9. Similarly, apparatus 110 is also ergonomically configured for easy gripping, and<br>
will likewise typically be grasped by the user between the thumb and the middle finger.<br>
Ridges 171 or 172 include tactile grooves or are otherwise textured to provide for a more<br>
secure grip and feel for the user. Additional tactile ridges can be provided on the housing<br>
itself in proximity to openings 125 and 126.<br>
[0050] Linkage 160 further includes front and rear blocks 161 and 162, and push rod 148<br>
extending from the front block 161. The ends of bowing elements 165 and 166 coincide at<br>
front and rear blocks 161 and 162. Suitable materials for linkage 160 are the same as those<br>
describe above with respect to linkage 60 of the embodiment of FIGS. 1-9. When assembled,<br>
rear block 162 is secured to the housing and retained in a fixed position relative to the housing<br>
by tabs 127 and 128. Front block 161 is received and slidable within track 129 on lower<br>
housing section 122. Push rod 148 extends from front block 161 and is axially aligned with<br>
cannula 140. The push rod can be formed of wire, and in one method of manufacture, the<br>
linkage can be molded directly onto a wire and then the wire can be cut to the desired<br>
dimensions to form the push rod.<br>
10051] In the undeployed condition, depicted in FIG. 11 A, implant 101 is retained in the<br>
cannula, distal to the push rod. Manual pressure on bowing element 165 or 166 supplies a<br>
normal force to longitudinal axis of the apparatus. This force is transmitted, via flexing of the<br>
bowing elements, into a longitudinal force along the longitudinal axis, which in turn causes<br>
movement of the free, front block 161 of the linkage away from the fixed, rear block 162.<br>
This in turn pushes push rod 146 through the cannula, which in turn ejects a loaded implant<br>
from the cannula, as shown in FIG. 1 1B.<br>
[0052] Lock tab 174 is provided on upper housing section 121 and further includes lock<br>
stop 175 that is engageable with notch 176 on front block 161. The lock tab itself can be<br>
integrally formed with upper housing section 121, and configured such that the lock stop<br>
snap-fits into the notch when positioned properly. In operation, as front block 161 moves<br>
forward in relation to the housing, angled face 178 engages lock stop 175 and deflects the<br>
lock tab upward. The lock tab remains deflected upward until movement of the front block<br>
brings notch 176 into position such that lock stop engages the notch. As can be appreciated,<br>
the location of the notch relative to the front block length will govern the distance traveled by<br>
the push rod in ejecting the implant. In the embodiment shown, the actuator can be inserted<br>
into the housing in two different orientations to provide for two different ejection distances<br>
for the push rod. As seen, a similar angled face 179 and notch 177 are provided on block 161<br>
opposite face 178 and notch 176, with notch 176 being offset from notch 177 relative to<br>
housing longitudinal axis. Therefore, the same actuator can be rotated 180 degrees upon<br>
assembly of the apparatus such that lock stop 175 instead engages notch 177, thereby<br>
allowing for the push rod to travel an alternate distance govenrned instead by the location of<br>
notch 177 relative to the front block length. In the embodiment shown, notch 177 provides<br>
for a 1 mm displacement and notch 176 provides for a 2 mm displacement.<br>
[0053] A third embodiment of an implant delivery apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is depicted in FIGS. 12A-12B. In this embodiment, implant delivery apparatus 210<br>
includes housing 220 and cannula assembly 242. Cannula assembly 242 includes cannula 240<br>
disposed within and extending from nose portion 230, and push rod 248 that is slidably<br>
received with the cannula and terminates at its proximal end in cone 249 which is disposed in<br>
the interior of the housing. Lever 254 is mounted for movement normal to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the apparatus. One end of the lever extends from the apparatus through opening 251<br>
and terminates in button 250. The other end of the lever includes tab 257 which is engageable<br>
with latch 258 on housing 220. The tab and latch can be configured to engage in a snap-fit<br>
relationship. Cam 260 is disposed within housing 220 and is pivotally mounted to the<br>
housing about pivot 265 which is located distally relative to lever 254. Slot 267 is provided<br>
on cam 260. Pin 256 on lever 254 is slidably retained within slot 267. The end of cam 260 is<br>
located proximal to the cone 249 and push rod 248 assembly.<br>
[0054] In the undeployed condition depicted in FIG. 12A, implant 201 is retained in the<br>
cannula distal to the push rod. Manual depression of button 250 causes downward movement .<br>
of lever 254 normal to the longitudinal axis of the apparatus. This movement exerts a force<br>
onto cam 260 which is transmitted by way of pin 256 of the lever to slot 267 of the cam,<br>
causing rotational movement of cam about pivot 265. With the end of cam 260 in ~<br>
approximation to cone 249, such rotation of the cam causes the end of the cam to engage cone<br>
249, causing translational movement of cone 249 and plunger 248 relative to the housing.<br>
This translational movement of the plunger, in turn, ejects the implant from the cannula, as<br>
depicted in FIG. 12B. When the lever is fully depressed and the implant ejected, tab 257<br>
engages latch 258, thereby locking the assembly into a depressed, post-ejection, condition.<br>
[0055] An advantage of an implant delivery apparatus according to the invention is that it<br>
provides for a very smooth, controlled ejection of the implant. By "controlled" it is meant<br>
that the force applied to the implant for ejection is proportional to the force applied by the<br>
user to actuate the apparatus. The user has direct feedback as to the rate of ejection and can<br>
dynamically adjust the force being delivered to the linkage to obtain the desired ejection rate.<br>
In addition, depending in particular linkage configurations and dimensions, the apparatus can<br>
be configured such that the range of translational movement of the plunger along the<br>
longitudinal, or "x" axis, of the housing can be significantly longer, although still proportional<br>
to, the range of movement of the actuator along the normal or "y" axis. In such situations,<br>
relatively long implants can be effectively delivered by an apparatus that is actuated by a<br>
comparatively short actuating stroke. The embodiment of FIGS. 9A &amp; 9B depicts such a<br>
situation, where the displacement y of button 50 results in a larger displacement x of plunger<br>
48.<br>
|0056] The controlled delivery that can be achieved by the inventive apparatus has<br>
additional advantages as well. For example, the controlled delivery provides a more<br>
predictable and reproducible placement of the implant, i.e., the implant will tend to be placed<br>
at a location very near the cannula tip, and not be projected to a more distant location as may<br>
potentially occur with the use of, e.g., a spring-loaded device where a sudden force is<br>
instantaneously applied to the implant. The inclusion of locking mechanisms, such as tab 57<br>
and slot 58 locking mechanism of the apparatus of FIGS. 1-9, or the lock tab mechanism of<br>
the apparatus of FIGS. 10-11, or the tab-latch mechanism of the apparatus of FIGS. 12A-12B,<br>
guards against backflow of eye fluid into the cannula after deployment of the implant. These<br>
locking mechanisms can further be configured such that the engagement between the two is<br>
irreversible, which prevents reuse of the apparatus. This is advantageous, e.g., if a single-use<br>
apparatus is desired.<br>
[0057] The combination of the overall housing shape, together with the particular<br>
positioning of the tactile ridges in approximation with the actuator position also provides for<br>
additional safety advantages. In particular, the design allows the user to control the<br>
positioning of the cannula and maintain its stability primarily through manipulation of the<br>
thumb and middle finger. The index finger meanwhile controls actuation of the apparatus,<br>
and thus the ejection of the implant from the cannula at the desired location. This design<br>
effectively separates positioning control from actuation control, and reduces the risk that the<br>
step of ejecting the implant will inadvertently cause movement of the device such that the<br>
actual placement of the implant is not at the intended location.<br>
[0058] The cannulas themselves are in many respects is similar to standard surgical<br>
needles, and can be formed of stainless steel in a variety of gauges. The gauge will be chosen<br>
such that the inner diameter of the cannula lumen, or bore, will correspond to the outer<br>
diameter of the chosen implant, with enough tolerance such that the implant can be received<br>
into and subsequently ejected from the cannula lumen. In the embodiment of FIGS. 10 and<br>
11, cannula 140 can be a standard surgical needle having luer lock fitting on its hub, which<br>
can be received and secured to a corresponding luer fitting provided on the end of housing<br>
120.<br>
(0059] It is desirable, although not necessary, to use a cannula that corresponds in<br>
dimensions to a 21 or 22 gauge needle or smaller. Such a small cannula has the important<br>
advantage that punctures made by such small bore needle or cannula according to techniques<br>
described herein are self-sealing. In the present application, this becomes advantageous in<br>
that the implant delivery into the eye can be accomplished without the need for suturing the<br>
puncture site, as would be necessary were a larger gauge needle used. We have determined<br>
that by using a 21 or 22 gauge cannula or smaller, the implant can be placed and the cannula<br>
withdrawn without excessive fluid leakage from the eye, despite the normal fluid pressures<br>
within the eye, and stitching of the puncture site can be avoided. 21 gauge needles have outer<br>
diameters of approximately 0.032 inches. Thin wall or extra thin wall versions of 21 gauge<br>
needles can have inner diameters of approximately 0.023 to 0.026 inches. 22 gauge needles<br>
have outer diameters of approximately 0.028 inches, and thin wall or extra thin wall versions<br>
of 22 gauge needles have inner diameters of approximately 0.019 to 0.023 inches. Ideally a<br>
cannula corresponding in dimensions up to those of 22 or 23 gauge, thin wall needles are<br>
used. Microimplants are dimensioned to have outer diameters to be received within the<br>
needle cannulaes with sufficient tolerances to be readily pushed through the cannula. For<br>
example and without being so limited, microimplants with a diameter of 0.018 inches can be<br>
easily delivered through a 22 gauge thin wall needle, and a microimplant with a diameter of<br>
0.015 inches is easily deliverable through a 23 gauge thin wall needle. The invention further<br>
contemplates the use of cannulas having non-circular cross-sections, including oval or<br>
elliptical cross-sections. For such non-circular cross-sectional cannulas, it is desirable that the<br>
cross-sectional area correspond to that of a circular cannula having up to a 0.032 inch<br>
diameter, that is, a cross-sectional area up to 0.0008 square inches or more, depending on the<br>
particular cross-sectional geometry.<br>
[0060] In addition to cannula dimensions, additional modifications to both the cannula tip<br>
and in particular methods of insertion can further aid successful self-sealing methods of<br>
implantation. A typical problem when inserting a cannula into any tissue is the phenomena of<br>
"coring" of the tissue, where the insertion actually cuts a cylindrical section of tissue that<br>
enters the cannula lumen. Such coring when it occurs in the eye can exacerbate leakage of<br>
eye fluid through the injection site. By approaching the eye tissue at more of an angle relative<br>
to normal, there is a better opportunity for the cannula tip to penetrate and separate through<br>
the tissue layers and reduce coring of the tissue. Additional techniques to further reducing<br>
coring and/or excessive leakage are further described herein.<br>
[0061 ] The cannula tip itself also can be configured to reduce coring phenomena, for<br>
instance, by sharpening certain portions of the bevel tip and dulling others. Figs. 12A and<br>
12B depict one such embodiment, where cannula tip 40a includes side bevels 31a, 32a that<br>
extend distally of designated line LI and constitute approximately one half of the bevel tip<br>
and dulled area 33a extending proximally of line LI, constituting the other half of the bevel<br>
tip. The dulled area 33a can be created through conventional polishing techniques known in<br>
the art. Figs. 13A and 13B depict another such embodiment, where cannula tip 40b that also<br>
includes side bevels 3 lb and 32b extending distally of designated line L2 and dulled area 33b<br>
extending proximally of line L2. However, in this embodiment, the side bevels 31b, 32b<br>
constitute only about one quarter or less of the bevel tip. In each of these embodiments, the<br>
sharp side bevels allow for an initial piercing of tissue, but as the tip is further inserted the<br>
tissue encounters the dulled areas of the bevel tip, which do not have sharp cutting edges, thus<br>
promoting separation of tissue layers as the cannula is advanced and mitigating against further<br>
cutting and possible coring of the tissue. In addition to these designs, conventional needle tips<br>
have also proven satisfactory.<br>
[0062] One skilled in the art will appreciate that the particular site of entry and the<br>
distance the cannula is inserted will depend on the particular application and the desired final<br>
location of the implant. As can also be appreciated, the ability provided herein to provide for<br>
a self-sealing method for delivering implants, has enormous impact on the ability of<br>
physicians and healthcare workers to treat diseases of the eye, because it obviates in most<br>
situations the necessity of surgery facilities, and accompanying surgical support, currently<br>
required by conventional methods.<br>
[0063] To administer an implant using, e.g., the implant delivery apparatus of FIGS. 1-9,<br>
the user can grasp apparatus 10 between the thumb and middle finger along tactile ridges 22,<br>
and position the apparatus near the desired point of entry into the patient's eye. The patient<br>
typically will be under a topical or local anesthetic. The user can then advance cannula 40<br>
into the patient's eye to the desired depth, and depress ejector button 50 to eject the implant at<br>
the desired location. The cannula 40 is then withdrawn. Specific techniques for cannula<br>
advancement, including angles of orientation of the cannula and the bevel are further<br>
discussed herein. Where cannula 40 is dimensioned to receive and retain a microimplant, as<br>
previously discussed, the resultant puncture site can self-seal upon withdrawal of the cannula.<br>
Otherwise, in situations where a larger cannula and implant are used, the puncture site can be<br>
closed up bv known methods, such as suturing.<br>
[0064] Methods of delivering implants, including self-sealing methods, can also be<br>
performed without the inventive apparatus, albeit less conveniently. In such self-sealing<br>
methods, a cannula having dimensions corresponding to those described above can be<br>
provided attached to a suitable holder, such as, e.g., a typical needle and syringe assembly.<br>
The microimplant is loaded and retained within the cannula lumen, and a push rod is further<br>
provided with the distal end received through the proximal end of the cannula lumen and<br>
positioned adjacent the microimplant. The distal end of the push rod remains outside the<br>
cannula and manually accessible. This assembly is then brought into position near the<br>
patient's eye, and the cannula is then used to puncture through the outer layer of a patient's eye<br>
and the cannula is further advanced a desired location within the patient's eye for deposition<br>
of the microimplant. Once the cannula is positioned, the push rod is moved from the<br>
proximal end of the cannula toward the distal end of the cannula, thereby ejecting the<br>
microimplant from the cannula. After ejection, the cannula and push rod are withdrawn from<br>
the patient's eye, and the puncture created by the insertion of the cannula into the patient's eye<br>
is self-sealing upon the removal of the cannula. Alternatively, similar methods can be<br>
employed using cannulas having other dimensions, where the resultant puncture is not self-<br>
sealing but can be sealed using known methods.<br>
[0065] For placement e.g. in the vitreous cavity of the eye, useful implantation methods<br>
include advancing the needle through the pars plana at a location approximately 3.5-4 mm<br>
from the limbus of the eye. For smaller diameter needles, e.g., 25 gauge or smaller, the<br>
needle can be inserted from any angle relative to the eye and still produce acceptable self-<br>
sealing results. For larger gauge needles, e.g., 23 gauge and above, self-sealing results can be<br>
enhanced by inserting the needle at angle relative to the eye surface. For example, good<br>
results are achieved by inserting the angle at an angle of 45° or less relative to the eye surface.<br>
Also, slightly improved results can be seen in some cases by orienting the bevel of the needle<br>
downward with respect to the eye surface. Another advantageous method involves a so-<br>
called "tunnel technique" approach. In this technique, the patient's eye is restrained from<br>
moving using e.g. a cotton swab or forceps, and the needle is advanced into the sclera at an<br>
angle approaching parallel relative to the eye surface. In this technique, the bevel will usually<br>
be oriented upward with respect to the eye surface. Once the tip is advanced sufficiently far<br>
enough into the scleral layer, usually such that the bevel portion is at least disposed within the<br>
scleral layer, the angle of the needle is adjusted to a more downward angle into the eye, and<br>
the needle is further advanced. Using such methods, with the shallower angle of insertion,<br>
yields wound edges that close up and seal more readily. Without being bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that insertion of the needle by this technique creates a scleral "flap" that, under<br>
intraocular pressure of the eye, is forced upward and pressed against the wound path to more<br>
effectively close up the wound.<br>
[0066] In addition, the direction of insertion of the needle relative to the limbus of eye can<br>
have further implications upon the deposition of the implant in the vitreous cavity. For<br>
example, advancement of the needle posteriorally of the limbus or even circumferentially<br>
relative to the limbus usually provides for a suitable and acceptable location for deposition of<br>
the implant. On the other hand, advancement of the needle anteriorally of the limbus requires<br>
some caution, as it can lead to placement of the implant close to the lens of the eye, which<br>
may cause some complications.<br>
[0067] Implants that are compatible with loading and ejection from apparatus according to<br>
the present invention can be formed by a number of known methods, including phase<br>
separation methods, interfacial methods, extrusion methods, compression methods, molding<br>
methods, injection molding methods, heat press methods and the like. Particular methods<br>
used can be chosen, and technique parameters varied, based on desired implant size and drug<br>
release characteristics. For microimplants described herein, which can be delivered through<br>
cannulas corresponding to a 21 gauge needle or smaller, and which therefore have cross-<br>
sectional diameters of 0.026 inches or less, or similar cross-sectional areas, extrusion<br>
methods are particularly useful. Extrusion methods, as well as injection molding,<br>
compression molding, and tableting methods, can all achieve the small cross-sectional<br>
diameters or areas required of microimplants. Extrusion methods also may result in more<br>
homogenous dispersion of drug within polymer, which can be important given the small<br>
dimensions of microimplants.<br>
|0068] As previously mentioned, microimplants that have diameters of 0.018 inches or<br>
less are deliverable through 22 gauge thin-walled cannulaes, and microimplants with<br>
diameters of 0.015 inches or less are deliverable through 23 gauge thin-walled cannulaes.<br>
Because of the extremely small cross-sectional diameters or areas of these microimplants, the<br>
corresponding length will need to proportionally larger to provide desired therapeutic dosages<br>
of many active agents. Typically, the microimplants can be manufactured so as to extend up<br>
to about 6 or 7 mm in length or longer. A microimplant of 7 mm or less in length may be<br>
preferable, at least for placement in the vitreous, as implants of greater length may interfere<br>
with a patient's vision.<br>
[0069] In manufacturing an implant delivery apparatus according to the invention, it may<br>
be desirable to pre-load the implant into the cannula. Pre-loaded apparatus provide added<br>
convenience for the user and avoid unnecessary handling of implants. Further, such loading<br>
can be done under sterile conditions, thereby ensuring delivery of a sterilized implant. For the<br>
embodiment of FIGS. 1-9, the implant can be pre-loaded into the cannula assembly and the<br>
loaded cannula assembly incorporate into the nose cone. In this fashion, loaded nose<br>
cone/cannula assemblies can be pre-assembled, for later incorporation with the housing<br>
assembly. Similarly, for the embodiment of FIGS. 10-11, the implant can be preloaded in the<br>
cannula and then later assembled onto the housing assembly. In an alternative variation on<br>
this embodiment, the cannula can have two separate parts, with one part of the cannula<br>
retained within the housing that then communicates with the other external portion of the<br>
cannula that is subsequently connected to the housing. In such a variation, an implant can<br>
further be preloaded in the cannula part retained within the housing. In any case, push rods<br>
and linkages of the appropriate lengths are provided dependent on the length of the particular<br>
loaded implant, such that complete ejection of the particular implant can be assured.<br>
[0070] Label plates, or other locations on the housing, can include the appropriate<br>
information relative to particular implant loaded. Given this interchangeability, unique<br>
apparatus for the delivery of selected implants can be easily manufactured, simply by<br>
providing the particular cannula, plunger, and linkage system for the selected implant. The<br>
remaining components of the apparatus remain the same. The name plate or housing itself<br>
can be labeled to correspond to the selected implant, thus identifying the apparatus with the<br>
loaded implant.<br>
[0071] When the apparatus is assembled with the implant pre-loaded, it may further be<br>
desirable that the implant be positioned just proximal of the opening at the cannula tip. In this<br>
fashion, the introduction of air into the eye can be avoided when the implant is ejected, as<br>
could otherwise occur were the implant located further within the cannula lumen and an air<br>
bubble or air pocket allowed to exist between the cannula tip and the implant and ejection of<br>
the implant were to force the air bubble or air pocket into the eye. One method to accomplish<br>
this is to load the implant distally into the cannula followed by the plunger, with the plunger<br>
length designed to push the implant to the desired pre-actuation position. When the cannula<br>
assembly is then installed onto the housing, the plunger and thus the implant is advanced to<br>
the desired position. To guard against inadvertent premature release of the implant, the<br>
cannula can have a slight bend incorporated into the tip such that enough friction exists<br>
between the inner wall of the cannula and the implant to hold the implant in place, but at the<br>
same time, the frictional force is easily overcome by action of the plunger to eject the implant<br>
upon actuation of the apparatus.<br>
[0072] Other mechanisms to retain the implant within the cannula are also contemplated.<br>
An example of one such retention mechanism involves the use of an O-ring which can be<br>
deployed so that at least a portion of the O-ring extends into the lumen of the cannula, and be<br>
in frictional contact with the implant. In this fashion, the implant is held in place within the<br>
cannula by the O-ring, but again the frictional force imparted by the O-ring against the<br>
implant is easily overcome by the force imparted by the plunger to eject the implant from the<br>
cannula. In one variation, the O-ring can be disposed within the cannula itself. In another<br>
variation, shown in Fig. 15, notch 303 is cut across the exterior of cannula 340, where the<br>
depth of the notch is such that it reaches into the lumen. That is, the notch is cut into the<br>
cannula to a depth where the cannula lumen is in communication with the notch and thus the<br>
exterior of the cannula. O-ring 302 is then positioned around the cannula exterior with a<br>
section of the O-ring residing in the notch, such that a portion of the O-ring extends into the<br>
cannula lumen, and is in frictional contact with implant 301 positioned therein. In the<br>
variation shown, the frictional force applied can be approximately 25-30 g, which is easily<br>
overcome by typical actuating forces of approximately 500 g. The O-ring can be formed of a<br>
variety of known materials, including silicone or thermoplastic elastomers. The O-ring can<br>
have circular cross-sections, or in order to provide more contact surface area with the implant,<br>
it can also have more oblong cross-sections, or oval cross-sections, or even rectangular cross-<br>
sections. The inclusion of the O-ring around the exterior of the cannula can also serve<br>
additional purposes. As an example, the provision of the exterior located O-ring provides an<br>
easily identifiable depth gauge and depth stop for the user to ensure that the cannula is<br>
inserted into the desired eye location up to but not beyond a specified depth prior to ejection<br>
of the implant. Alternatively, the cannula itself can be suitably marked to provide easily<br>
identifiable depth markings.<br>
[0073] Other contemplated retention mechanisms similarly involve deployment or<br>
insertion of a frictional stop into the lumen of the cannula. For example, in a variation on the<br>
use of O-rings as described above, a notch can likewise be cut into the cannula and the<br>
cannula then fitted with a shrink tubing, such as thin-wall medical grade heat shrink polymer<br>
tubings, which include but are not limited to e.g. polyolefins, fluoropolymers (PTFE),<br>
polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalates (PET). Once positioned around<br>
the cannula, such tubings can be caused to shrink both axially and radially, resulting in a<br>
portion of the tubing being shrink-fitted through the notch and into the lumen, to create a<br>
frictional stop much like the previously described O-ring variations. In another example,<br>
other frictional stops can be deployed within the cannula, including, e.g., leaf springs, spring<br>
clips, or other like mechanisms, which would impart a frictional force against a retained<br>
implant, yet still allow the implant to be expelled from the cannula upon actuation. Still other<br>
frictional stops can be created by manipulation of the cannula itself. For example, similar to<br>
the bending of the cannula described above, a section of the cannula can be dented or<br>
"dimpled" such that there is an indention of the cannula wall within the lumen. Such an<br>
indentation can form the frictional stop.<br>
[0074] Still other retention mechanisms are contemplated that can rely on biocompatible<br>
adhesives, coatings, or membranes. For example, a relatively weak biocompatible adhesive<br>
can be used to coat the implant or the lumen such that the implant adheres to and remains<br>
positioned within the lumen. Alternatively, the lumen can be coated with a polymeric or other<br>
coating that provides additional frictional resistance to movement of the implant within the<br>
lumen. In such cases, the resistance provided by the adhesive or coating will be easily<br>
overcome upon actuation of the delivery device. As another example, a thin membrane can<br>
be deployed within the lumen that spans the lumen diameter. Such a membrane would have<br>
sufficient integrity to resist movement of the implant within the lumen, but would readily give<br>
way or break when the actuation force is imparted to expel the implant.<br>
[00751 Other cannula designs can likewise achieve the desired effect of avoiding the<br>
introduction of air into the eye upon ejection of the implant. For example, the implant can be<br>
positioned proximally of the cannula tip but with sufficient tolerance between the implant and<br>
cannula wall to provide for air exhaust past the implant as it is moved through the cannula.<br>
Adequate tolerances are those that retain air in front of the implant at close to ambient<br>
pressure as the implant is moved along the cannula. Because fluid pressure within the eye is<br>
typically slightly positive relative to ambient pressure, air at ambient pressure will not enter<br>
the eye.<br>
[0076] Loaded apparatus according to the invention can be packaged to include a safety<br>
cap extending over the cannula and securing to the housing. This will provide a measure of<br>
safety during handling of the apparatus. The button or other depression mechanism of the<br>
apparatus can also include a notch which receives the rim of the safety cap. In this<br>
configuration, the safety cap will then also operate to guard against unintentional depression<br>
of the button or other depression mechanism and ejection of the implant.<br>
[0077] As can be appreciated, an implant delivery apparatus according to the invention<br>
that is provided loaded with the desired implant is of great benefit to the physician user. Such<br>
apparatus can be provided sterile packaged for a single use application. The user need not<br>
ever handle the implant itself. As previously mentioned, the apparatus provides for a<br>
controlled ejection of the implant. The configuration and design of the apparatus also helps to<br>
achieve uniform placement of implants from patient to patient. Further, when the apparatus is<br>
configured to deliver a micro-implant, the apparatus provides a self-sealing method for<br>
delivery, as previously discussed. This has enormous benefit to the physician and patient in<br>
that the entire implant procedure can safely, easily, and economically be performed in a<br>
physician's office, without the need for more costly surgical support currently required for<br>
implant delivery.<br>
[0078] The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Effects of needle size and technique on vitreous leakage<br>
[0079] Different gauge needles together with various insertion techniques were pursued to<br>
determine the maximum size needle gauge and optimum insertion technique for mimimum<br>
vitreous leakage and "self-sealing" wounds.<br>
[0080] Eight rabbits were anaesthetized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail. Drops of a<br>
0.5% Opthaine solution were delivered to each eye of the rabbit as a local anaesthetic. 16g,<br>
20g, 22g, 23g, 25g needles (Beckton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were attached to<br>
syringes and inserted into the vitreous cavities of the rabbits' eyes, through the pars plana (2-3<br>
mm from the limbus) according to varying techniques. For each needle size, the needles were<br>
inserted at either angles of 90° or 45° relative to the pars plana of the eye, or according to the<br>
following "tunnel" technique. In the "tunnel" technique, the needle is initially advanced into<br>
the first scleral layer of the eye tissue at a very shallow angle, almost parallel, to the sclera.<br>
Once the needle has penetrated sufficiently, usually to a position whereby the bevel has<br>
passed into the scleral layer, the orientation of the needle is adjusted and further advanced at a<br>
sharper angle of attack, for example, typically anywhere up to 45°. Table 1A below details<br>
the needle gauge and insertion technique for each animal.<br>
[0082] Based on the above and additional observations, it can be concluded that insertion<br>
technique as well as needle size are important factors in determining wound characteristics<br>
and subsequent wound leakage. For the 25 gauge needles, the angle or technique of insertion<br>
was less important, with the would be being relatively small, sealed, and demonstrating<br>
minimal to no leakage. For larger gauge needles, insertion techniques become more<br>
important, insertion of the needle at angles less than normal, i.e., less than 90°, dramatically<br>
reduced the amount of leakage and the ability of the wound to sealf seal was enhanced.<br>
Insertion by the above-described tunnel technique gave the most promising results, but even a<br>
direct approach at an angle under 45° provides very good results. Additionally, slightly better<br>
results were obtained with the bevel facing downward relative to the eye tissue upon insertion.<br>
Thus it is expected that self-sealing is achievable with 23 gauge or larger needles, including<br>
22 and 21 gauge needles, using the described techniques.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: DELIVERY OF M1CROIMPLANTS<br>
[0083] Cylindrical microimplants having dimensions of 0.015 inches diameter and 6mm<br>
length were delivered into posterior segments of rabbits' eyes using a 23 gauge thin wall<br>
needle and according to insertion techniques described above in Example 1.<br>
[0084] Four rabbits were anaesthetized as before with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail and<br>
with drops of a 0.5% Opthaine solution administered to each eye of the rabbit as a local<br>
anaesthetic. 23g thin wall needles (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were attached to syringes and the<br>
needle cannulaes were loaded with the microimplants. The needles were inserted into the<br>
vitreous cavities of the rabbits' eyes, according to varying techniques detailed in Example 1<br>
and as further described herein. Table 2A below details the needle gauge and insertion<br>
technique for each animal.<br>
[0085] In addition to the angle of insertion and the bevel orientation, different orientations<br>
of the needles relative to the limbus of the eye were also examined for situations where the<br>
needle was inserted at an angle other than normal, i.e., 90°. More specifically, the needles<br>
advanced into the eye in (1) a circumferential fashion, that is, along a direction generally<br>
tangential to the limbus, (2) a posterior manner, that is, the needle is advanced generally<br>
towards the posterior of the eye, and (3) in an anterior manner where the needle advanced<br>
toward the anterior of the eye.<br>
[0086] Upon insertion of the needle, the microimplants were delivered into the vitreous<br>
cavity of the posterior segment by advancing a push wire through the needle cannula to push<br>
the microimplants through the needle cannula. The needle was then removed and the resulting<br>
wound was examined and observations of wound shape and characteristics and amount of<br>
vitreous leakage were recorded. The results are tabulated in Table 2B below. Observations<br>
were also made as to location and condition of the delivered implant.<br>
[0087] From the above and additional observations it can be expected that insertion of the<br>
needle at an angle of 45° or less gave satisfactory results with respect to self-sealing and<br>
likewise resulted in satisfactory placement of the implant. While the previously described<br>
tunnel technique provides for the best self-sealing results, the positioning of the implant was<br>
slightly less controllable than that observed by a methods where the needle was advanced<br>
along a single path.. Also, the orientation of the needle relative to the limbus can be<br>
important. For example, needles advanced into the eye circumferentially or posteriorly<br>
provide for a more advantageous deposition of the implant, whereas needles advanced<br>
anteriorly can result in placement of the implant close to the lens which may cause<br>
complications. Other difficulties observed in placement of the implants were caused in one<br>
instance by breakage of implants during loading such that small pieces of implant were<br>
located in the wound. Such occurrences are easily alleviated through increased care in<br>
loading the implant and ensuring that the push wire is long enough to completely eject the<br>
implant.<br>
