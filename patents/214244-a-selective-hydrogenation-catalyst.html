				<td>Selective-Hydrogenation-€atalvst for Selectively Hydrogenating of<br>
Unsaturated Olefin, Process for Preparing the Sam and Its Use<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a selective hydrogenation catalyst for the<br>
selective hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, a process for preparing<br>
this catalyst and its use, more specifically, to the selective hydrogenation<br>
catalyst for selectively hydrogenating acetylenic and diolefinic compounds<br>
having two to four carbon atoms into corresponding olefin and its use in<br>
petroleum hydrocarbon thermal cracking process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known that the steam cracking of petroleum hydrocarbon is the<br>
most important process for manufacturing the monomers of polyolefin such<br>
as ethylene, propylene. Its process route is that after mixing petroleum<br>
hydrocarbon with steam, the mixture stream in cracking furnace is thermal<br>
cracked at 750-870°C to form H2, CO, CO2 and the mixture of saturated and<br>
unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons having one to three carbon atoms and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons. By passing through a series of fractionating towers,<br>
the feed stream is fractionated into fractions of &gt;C10, H2 and CH4, C2, C3, C4,<br>
C5-C10. In C2-C10 fractions, there exist unsaturated hydrocarbons such as<br>
mono-olefin, alkyne, diolefin etc. The alkyne and diolefin in C2, C3 fractions<br>
are the poisonous impurities which interfere the follow up polymerizations of<br>
ethylene, and propylene. They make the activity of polymerization catalyst<br>
decrease and catalyst consumption increase, moreover the performance of<br>
polymerization product poor. It is needed to control strictly the amount of<br>
diolefin and alkyne such as acetylene contained in the cracked product. In<br>
recent years, the high efficiency catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene<br>
newly developed gets more and more strict on the concentration requirement<br>
of alkyne and polyolefin. For example, for C2 fraction, the acetylene content<br>
was limited to 10-6 mol% or less after 1980"s, and for some process having<br>
special requirement such as the manufacture of HDPE, the acetylene content<br>
in refined ethylene was limited to 0.1 X 10"6 mol% or less.<br>
Therefore, how to remove more efficiently the highly unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbon such as acetylene from the cracked product has been concerned<br>
generally. In general, the catalytically selective hydrogenation method is<br>
adopted to remove the acetylene in ethylene-ethane fraction.<br>
In the reaction of selective hydrogenation for acetylene removal, the<br>
whole acetylene should be converted while no over-hydrogenation occurs<br>
such that ethylene loss is avoided. Consequently, both the superior activity<br>
and higher selectivity of the hydrogenation catalyst are required. Moreover,<br>
the acetylene absorbed on catalyst surface is easily dimerized through<br>
hydrogenation to form unsaturated C4 hydrocarbons such as 1,3-butadiene,<br>
and such a C4 hydrocarbon would react subsequently with acetylene or<br>
ethylene or other unsaturated hydrocarbon to form C6-C24 oligomers (known<br>
as "green oil"). A part of so-called green oil, flowing along with the feed<br>
stream, is removed in a green oil absorber, and the other part would adhere on<br>
the catalyst surface and cover on the active center of catalyst, which will<br>
make its hydrogenation activity and selectivity decrease gradually, shorten the<br>
catalyst operation cycle period and lead to more frequent regeneration, affect<br>
the service life, thus increase in production costs. Therefore, the selective<br>
hydrogenation catalyst having superior performance should have high activity,<br>
selectivity and lower amount of green oil formation, particularly the amount<br>
of green oil adhered on the catalyst should be low.<br>
In the prior art, generally a large quantity of supported Pd catalyst is<br>
adopted and other cocatalyst component added. For example, cocatalyst<br>
component disclosed in US4,404,124 is Ag, that in EP89252Js Au, that in DE<br>
1,284,403 and USA, ,577,047 is Cr, that in US3,912,789 is Cu, that in<br>
US3,900,526 is Fe, that in US3,489,809 is Rh, that in US3,325,556 is Li, that<br>
in CN1151908A is K; moreover other cocatalyst components disclosed<br>
include Pb, Zn etc.<br>
In above-mentioned cocatalyst components disclosed, some of them<br>
sacrificed Pd catalyst"s selectivity due to improving its activity, some of them<br>
can improve the Pd catalyst"s selectivity or reduce the green oil formation, but<br>
their activity reduced significantly. Consequently, only the Pd-Ag catalyst is<br>
in common use industrially at present. But with respect to its activity and<br>
selectivity, Pd-Ag catalyst is still less than satisfactory, particularly the control<br>
of green oil formation on catalyst surface is undesirable yet.<br>
In connection with the above disadvantages, a selective hydrogenation<br>
catalyst for alkyne is disclosed in the Chinese Patent Application CN<br>
1,279,126A, wherein the main catalyst component is Pd and cocatalyst<br>
component is Bi and Ag. When the catalyst system is used in the selective<br>
hydrogenation of alkyne, it reduces green oil formation obviously while<br>
exhibits higher activity and selectivity, thus the carbon deposit decrease and<br>
service life of the catalyst increase.<br>
However, said catalyst is still less than satisfactory. Along with the<br>
increasing of alkyne handling capacity in industrial application and the<br>
aggravation of side reaction at severer reaction conditions such as high space<br>
velocity (7,000-20,000hr-1) and high alkyne content, the activity, selectivity,<br>
the regeneration period and service life of said catalyst are unsatisfactory,<br>
further improvements thereof are still needed. In general, the catalytic ability<br>
of the catalyst decreases due to deposition of carbon on the catalyst after a<br>
long time of alkyne selective hydrogenation, and the catalyst should be<br>
regenerated by heating to about 500°C with air blow so as to recover the<br>
activity and selectivity if it fail to meet the production requirement even at an<br>
elevated temperature. The temperature, at which a catalyst is regenerated,<br>
controlled strictly. But even so, the technical parameters of the catalyst such as<br>
specific surface area and the like are also changed greatly after enduring 3-5<br>
times of regeneration. The poor repeatability and stability of catalyst will<br>
result in the deterioration of its properties until it can not be used again and<br>
must be substituted with a new catalyst.<br>
It is known that rare earth metals can be used in hydrogenation catalyst<br>
wherein Pd acts as main active component. For example, in US5,426,253, a<br>
process for hydrogenating 2,2-dichloro-l,l,l,2-tetrafluoroethane and<br>
2-chloro-l,l,l,2-tetrafluoroethane or a mixture thereof into<br>
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is disclosed, wherein the main active component of<br>
the adopted catalyst is a metal of Group VIII selected from the group<br>
consisting of Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh, Co. Ru and Ir. Moreover, said catalyst contains at<br>
least one of the following metals: Cu, Ag, Au, La, Ce and Nd, and which is<br>
disclosed to be used as the cocatalyst with a corrosion-resistance in the<br>
hydrogenation and dechlorination of halohydrocarbon concerned in this patent<br>
so as to protect the activity of the catalyst from the influence of HC1 formed in<br>
the dechlorination.<br>
As a result of making repeated experiments, the present inventors<br>
discover that by means of the supporter loaded concurrently main active<br>
component Pd, cocatalyst component Bi, rare earth metals and at least one of<br>
Ag, Cu, K, Na, Sr, Mn, Zr, Mo, Co, Ge, or a combination of two or more<br>
metals thereof, the hydrogenation reaction of acetylene is carried out in higher<br>
selectivity and higher activity under a high space velocity, wherein said<br>
acetylene exists in the C2 fraction resulted from petroleum hydrocarbon<br>
thermal cracking process. Moreover, the catalyst of the present invention has<br>
the advantage of good stability, small changes in catalyst"s properties after<br>
multiple times regenerations, easily controllable physical parameters,<br>
improved regeneration period and service life due to the addition of rare earth<br>
metals.<br>

following active components loaded on a porous inorganic supporter:<br>
(1) at least one of Pt, Pd, Ni, Ru, Co, and Rh;<br>

wherein the rare earth metal is selected from Sc, Y, and Lanthanides in Group<br>
II1B of periodic table of elements.<br>
The preparation method of the catalyst of the present invention is: the rare<br>
earth metal component being loaded first, or the rare earth metal component<br>
and K or Na component being loaded concurrently first, and then other active<br>
components being loaded stepwise or concurrently.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
This invention is described hereinafter in detail.<br>
It is understood that this invention is not limited to the specific<br>
compositions, steps and materials and modifications on these compositions,<br>
steps and materials can be made under the spirit of the present invention. It<br>
should be pointed out that the terms used herein are only descriptive but they<br>
cannot be conceived as limit to the scope of the invention.<br>
The selective hydrogenation catalyst of this invention for selectively<br>
hydrogenating unsaturated olefin comprises mainly the following active<br>
components loaded on a porous inorganic supporter:<br>
(1) at least one of Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh, Co, and Ru;<br>
(2) at least one of Ag, Cu, Zn, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Be, Sn, Pb, , Sr, Ba, Ra,<br>
Fe, Mn, Zr, Mo, and Ge;<br>
(3) at least one of rare earth metals; and<br>
(4) Bi:<br>
wherein the rare earth metal is selected from Sc, Y and Lanthanides including<br>
La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu.<br>
Based on the total weight of the metal elements, the amount of active<br>
component( 1), for each 100% by weight of the catalyst (hereinafter the<br>
percentage being based on the weight ratio of metal elements) is 0.001-1%,<br>
preferably 0.008-0.3%, more preferably 0.01-0.15%. The preferred component<br>
(l)is Pd or Pt.<br>
Based on the total weight of the metal elements, the amount of active<br>
component(2), for each 100% by weight of the catalyst, is 0.001-10%,<br>
preferably 0.01-2%. The preferred active component (2) is at least one of Ag,<br>
K, Na, Zn, Sn, Pb, Cd, more preferably Ag or Ag and K or Ag and Na.<br>
It should be particularly noted that, according to the performance<br>
requirement for the final catalyst, two or more metals, such as Ag and alkali<br>
metal Na or K, can be used together, and made to improve the catalyst<br>
performances obviously.<br>
The weight percentage (wt.%) of active component (3), for each 100% by<br>
weight of the catalyst, is 0.01-5%, preferably 0.05-3%, more preferably<br>
0.1-1.5%. The preferred rare earth metal is La, Ce, Nd, Pm, Eu, Y or mixtures<br>
thereof, more preferably La and / or Nd. The rare earth metal content loaded<br>
on the supporter has direct influence on the performance of the final catalyst<br>
of the invention. Generally, when the content of the rare earth metal is less<br>
than 0.01%, its stabilizing effect and promoter action on the catalyst would<br>
not be very obvious, the invention fails to be achieved; however, when the<br>
content is higher than 5%, such a high amount not only makes the catalyst<br>
cost up, but also influence fairly on the performances, such as activity and<br>
selectivity of the catalyst.<br>
The weight percentage of active component (4) , for each 100% by<br>
weight of catalyst, is 0.001-5%, preferably 0.005-1%.<br>
The porous inorganic supporter of the invention can be the well-known<br>
supporter in the prior art. For example, diatomaceous earth, spinel, Sio2, TiO2,<br>
AL2O3, or mixtures thereof. The preferred supporter of the invention is Al2O3<br>
or SiO2; Its shape can be granular, gear-shaped, spherical, laminar or strip,<br>
preferably gear-shaped or spherical, more preferably gear-shaped (such a<br>
shape has an advantage of low bed pressure drop at high space velocity); its<br>
specific surface area is l-200m/g, preferably 2-120m/g, more preferably<br>
2-50m2/g.<br>
It should be particularly noted that the gear-shaped supporter is<br>
preferably used in the catalyst of the invention for industrial application. As a<br>
result of the increase of space velocity in selective hydrogenation, the<br>
increase of the pressure drop of catalyst bed would have certain influence on<br>
the normal operation at downstream section. When the space velocity<br>
increases, the pressure drop of the catalyst made of gear-shaped supporter,<br>
and of spherical supporter both increase to some extent, but the speed gain of<br>
pressure drop of spherical supporter is higher than that of gear-shaped<br>
supporter. Therefore, in higher space velocity hydrogenation, the gear-shaped<br>
supporter chosen is superior to spherical supporter.<br>
For the preparation of the catalyst of the invention, the well-known<br>
conventional method such as impregnating and spraying can be used to load<br>
said active components on the supporter stepwise or concurrently.<br>
The preferred preparation method is: the rare earth metal component<br>
being loaded first, or the rare earth metal component and K or Na component<br>
being loaded concurrently first, and then other active components loaded<br>
stepwise or concurrently.<br>
The most preferred method is:<br>
(1) Adding the salt solution of rare earth metal into the supporter<br>
forming materials during the formation of the supporter; or impregnating the<br>
supporter after the formation of the supporter with an aqueous solution of rare<br>
earth metal salt, drying and calcining, the preferred rare earth metal salt<br>
solution is its nitrate solution;<br>
(2) Impregnating concurrently or separately said supporter with the salt<br>
solution of component(l), salt solution of component(2) and salt solution of<br>
component^), after drying at 100-300°C for 5-24hr, calcining at 350-900°C<br>
for 4-20hr to obtain the catalyst.<br>
When the active component (1) is Pd, the suitable examples of palladium<br>
salt include (but not limit to) palladium chloride, palladium bromide,<br>
palladium iodide, palladium acetate, palladium nitrate, palladium sulfate,<br>
palladium acetylacetonate, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. For<br>
convenience, the preferred palladium compound is palladium chloride and/or<br>
palladium nitrate.<br>
When the active component (2) is Ag, the suitable examples of the silver<br>
salt include (but not limit to) silver nitrate, silver fluoride, silver perchlorate,<br>
and mixtures of any two or more thereof. For convenience, the preferred<br>
silver compound is an aqueous solution of silver nitrate.<br>
When the active component (2) is potassium or sodium, the suitable<br>
examples of the alkali metal compound include (but not limit to) potassium<br>
(or sodium) nitrate, potassium (or sodium) halide, K(or Na) XO3 (wherein<br>
X=halogen), potassium (or sodium) phosphate, potassium (or sodium)<br>
hydrogen phosphate, potassium (or sodium) carbonate, potassium (or sodium)<br>
hydrogen carbonate, potassium (or sodium) salts of organic acids, potassium<br>
(or sodium) hydrate, potassium (or sodium) molybdate, potassium (or sodium)<br>
sulfate, potassium (or sodium) arsenate and mixtures of any two or more<br>
thereof. For convenience, the preferred alkali metal compound is an aqueous<br>
solution of potassium (or sodium) hydrate.<br>
When the active component (3) is rare earth metal, the suitable examples<br>
of the rare earth element compound include (but not limit to) its nitrate, halide,<br>
salt of organic acid, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. For<br>
convenience, the preferred rare earth element compound is an aqueous<br>
solntion of nitrate solution.<br>
When the active component (4) is Bi, the suitable examples of bismuth<br>
salt includes (but not limit to) bismuth nitrate, and bismuth chloride.<br>
It should be noted that, it is advantageous to impregnate the supporter<br>
with the maximum amount of the salt solution of active component<br>
absorbable by the supporter.<br>
It is observed clearly through scanning electron microscope (SEM) that<br>
the active component(l), such as Pd, in the catalyst of the invention disperses<br>
uniformly on catalyst surface and forms a very thin Pd layer with a thickness<br>
of 1 to 30 µm, in generally. In connection with the selective hydrogenation<br>
which is mainly a diffusion-controlled reaction, the catalyst to be used therein<br>
with a thinner thickness of Pd layer will be advantageous to make the activity<br>
and selectivity of the catalyst higher.<br>
The catalyst of the invention is applicable to all the selective<br>
hydrogenation for high unsaturated hydrocarbon to corresponding olefin,<br>
especially applicable to the petroleum hydrocarbon thermal cracking selective<br>
hydrogenation for the C2 fraction containing high unsaturated hydrocarbon<br>
such as acetylene to olefin. The term "high unsaturated hydrocarbon" herein is<br>
referred to the hydrocarbons containing triple bond and/or two or more double<br>
bonds. The term "petroleum hydrocarbon thermal cracking process selective<br>
hydrogenation" throughout the specification means both "front end<br>
hydrogenation" and "back end hydrogenation" well known by persons skilled<br>
in the art. The catalyst of the invention also is applicable to the removal of<br>
trace acetylene from refined ethylene so as to obtain the product which<br>
satisfies with the standard of polymerizing grade ethylene.<br>
In service to said hydrogenation, the selective hydrogenation catalyst of<br>
the invention demonstrates the following outstanding results:<br>
(1) The synergistic effect of the multiple active components in the<br>
catalyst of present invention makes the activity and selectivity of the catalyst<br>
increase, the green oil formation reduce, the carbon deposition of long<br>
duration decrease, thus the service period is lengthened over a wider ranger,<br>
the service life of the catalyst is increased.<br>
(2) The Pd layer on the catalyst is very thin(l-30 u m). This kind of thin<br>
Pd layer is favorable to the diffusion of reactants, especially at higher space<br>
velocity (higher concentration of reactants and larger material handling<br>
capacity), the catalyst still has higher activity and selectivity. So it is very<br>
applicable to industrial cracking process.<br>
(3) The stability of catalyst is improved obviously, thus both the activity<br>
and selectivity of the catalyst are made to increase.<br>
(4) Moreover, the gear-shaped supporter adopted makes the catalyst be<br>
able to operate stably at high space velocity, increase greatly the handling<br>
capacity of the catalyst.<br>
In brief, the catalyst of the invention is able to carry out hydrogenation<br>
of alkyne or diolefin high selectively and high actively at higher space<br>
velocity, moreover maintain low green oil formation, and the catalyst has the<br>
advantage of long regeneration period, long service life and low cost.<br>

Comparative Example 3<br>
A 0.03wt.%Pd-0.1wt.%K-0.07wt.%Ag-0.03wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst was<br>
prepared according to the same method as described in example 2, except the<br>
gear-shaped alumina was not impregnated with aqueous solution of<br>
lanthanum nitrate.<br>
A micro-counter estimation unit was used to evaluate the catalysts of<br>
Examples 1-3 and Comparative Examples 1-3. The packing quantity of the<br>

conducted under the following conditions: H2/alkyne=1.3, reaction<br>
temperature: 130°C, inlet concentration of alkyne: 0.51%, space velocity:<br>
10,000hr-1. The results were shown in Table 1.<br>
As the results shown in Table 1, both the acetylene conversion and the<br>
ethylene selectivity are improved obviously by using the<br>
Pd-La-Ag-Bi/alumina catalyst and Pd-La-Ag-K-Bi/alumina catalyst of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example 4<br>
300g of alumina spheres were weighed out precisely. A<br>
0.03wt.%Pd-0.5wt.%La-0.186wt.%Ag-0.12wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst was<br>
prepared according to the same method as described in Example 1.<br>
Example 5<br>
A 0.03wt.%Pd-l.0wt.%La-0.186wt.%Ag-0.12wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst<br>
was prepared according to the same method as described in Example 4,<br>
except the amount of lanthanum nitrate was changed.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A 0.03wt.%Pd-0.186wt.%Ag-0.12wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst was prepared<br>
according to the same method as described in Example 4, except the alumina<br>
was not impregnated with an aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate .<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
A 0.03wt.%Pd-0.18wt.%Ag/alumina catalyst was prepared according to<br>
the same method as described in Example 4, except the alumina was not<br>
impregnated with an aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate and the<br>
Pd-Ag/alumina catalyst was not impregnated with an aqueous solution of<br>
bismuth nitrate.<br>
Example 6<br>
An aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate was put into alumina powder<br>
to prepare gear-shaped supporter by conventional method. The gear-shaped<br>
supporter was impregnating successively with aqueous solutions of palladium<br>
nitrate, silver nitrate and bismuth nitrate, after drying and calcining, a<br>
0.03wt.%Pd-0.5wt.%La-0.186wt.%Ag-0.12wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst was<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 7<br>
A 0.031 wt.%Pd-2.5wt.%La-0.186wt.%Ag-0.03wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst<br>
was prepared according to the same method as described in Example 6.<br>
Example 8<br>
A 0.03 wt.% Pd-0.1wt.% K-0.5wt.% La-0.105wt.% Ag-0.06wt.%<br>
Bi/alumina catalyst was prepared according to the same method as described<br>
in Example 6.<br>
Example 9<br>
A 0.03wt.% Pd-0.1wt.% K-0.5wt.% La-0.07wt.% Ag-0.03wt.%<br>
Bi/alumina catalyst was prepared according to the same method as described<br>
in Example 6.<br>
The catalysts of Comparative Example 4, Comparative Example 5, and<br>
Examples 4-9 were chosen to perform hydrogenation experiments<br>
respectively.<br>
200ml of catalyst was packed into a tubular reactor; glass beads were<br>
packed on the top of the catalyst bed and under the bottom thereof. After<br>
displacing with nitrogen gas, and reducing, a fraction from the top of<br>
de-ethanizer of the back end hydrogenation process in ethylene cracking<br>
procedure was hydrogen-mixed and then passed from top to bottom through<br>
the reactor, in which the fraction contained 0.8-l.lmol% of acetylene,<br>
15-20mol% of ethane and the balance of ethylene. The hydrogenation<br>
reaction was conducted under the following conditions: H2/alkyne=1.5, inlet<br>
temperature of reactor: 35 °C, space velocity: 10,00hr-1. The results were<br>
shown in table 2.<br>
As the results shown in the table 2, the selectivity of catalyst is increased<br>
by more than 10% under the condition of higher space velocity of 10,000hr-1<br>
due to the existing of rare earth metal component, which is very valuable to<br>
the industrial application of the catalyst.<br>
Under the aforesaid conditions, after the catalysts of Comparative<br>
Example 2, Comparative Example 4, Example 4 and Example 5 reacting<br>
respectively for 943 hours, the collected amount of green oil and the weight<br>
gain of the catalyst (i. e. the total weight of green oil and carbon deposit on<br>
each catalyst) were measured carefully as shown in the following table 3.<br><br>
The lighter color of green oil indicates the smaller molecular weight of<br>
green oil, so that it is easier to be removed during catalyst regeneration. The<br>
smaller weight gain of the catalyst indicates the longer operating period of a<br>
catalyst. From the results shown in table 3, it is very clear that the weight gain<br>
of catalyst is reduced by more than 30% and the amount of green oil after<br>
reaction is decreased obviously due to the existing of rare earth metal element<br>
and Bi.<br>
Example 10<br>
20g of formed gear-shaped alumina supporter were impregnated with an<br>
aqucons solution of lanthanum nitrate, so as to made a La-loaded supporter<br>
containing 0.1 wt.% of La. According to aforesaid preparation method, the<br>
La-loaded supporter was impregnated successively with aqueous solutions of<br>
palladium chloride, silver nitrate, bismuth nitrate, after drying and calcining, a<br>
0.03 wt.%Pd-0.1 wt.%1 .a-0.18wi.%Ag-0.10wt.%Bi/Alumina catalyst was<br>
obtained.<br>
Example 11-15<br>
Five catalysts were prepared according to the same method as described<br>
in Example 10, except aqueous solutions of cerium nitrate, neodymium nitrate,<br>
praseodymium nitrate, europium nitrate, yttrium nitrate were substituted for<br>
the aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate respectively in each Example.<br>
A micro-counter estimation unit was used to evaluate the catalysts of<br>
Examples 10-15. The packing quantity of the catalyst was 1ml and the<br>
packing height of it was 20mm. The evaluation was conducted under the<br>
following conditions: H2/alkyne.5, reaction temperature: 90 D , inlet<br>
concentration of alkyne: 0.4mol%, space velocity: 10.00hr-1. The results<br>
were shown in Table 4.<br><br>
Example 16<br>
300g of gear-shaped alumina supporter was loaded successively with<br>
lanthanum nitrate, potassium hydrate, palladium chloride, silver nitrate and<br>
bismuth nitrate by impregnating with the corresponding aqueous solution and<br>
drying respectively. After calcining, a 0.032wt.%Pd-0.1wt.%K-lwt.%<br>
La-0.03wt.% Ag-0.03wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst was obtained.<br>
Example 17<br>
300g of gear-shaped alumina supporter was impregnated with aqueous<br>
solutions of potassium carbonate and lanthanum nitrate at the same time, then<br>
dried and calcined to obtain a K-La-loaded supporter. The K-La-loaded<br>
supporter was loaded simultaneously with palladium nitrate, silver nitrate,<br>
bismuth nitrate. After calcining, a 0.032wt.%Pd-0.1wt.%K-0.3wt.%<br>
La-0.01 wt.% Ag-0.03wt.%Bi/alumina catalyst was obtained.<br>
The catalysts of Example 16 and 17 were tested in an industrial sideline<br>
unit respectively. 200ml of the catalyst was packed into a tubular reactor.<br>
After displacing the reactor with nitrogen gas, a C2-C3 fraction from the top of<br>
pre-de-propanizer of the front end hydrogenation process in ethylene cracking<br>
procedure was passed through the reactor in which the fraction contained<br>
0.4-0.7mol% of acetylene, 0.4-0.6mol% of MAPD (propyne + propadiene),<br>
500-2000ppm of carbon monoxide, 8-14mol% of hydrogen, 25-31mol% of<br>
methane, 4-6mol% of ethane, 45-50mol% of ethylene, and a little amount of<br>
propane. The above hydrogenation reaction was conducted under the<br>
following conditions: inlet temperature of reactor: 70 °C, space velocity:<br>
20,000hr"\ The results were shown in table 5.<br><br>
The results shown in table 5 indicate that the catalyst of the present<br>
invention could be used not only to remove acetylene from feedstock, but also<br>
to remove propyne and propadiene existing in feedstock at the same time.<br>
