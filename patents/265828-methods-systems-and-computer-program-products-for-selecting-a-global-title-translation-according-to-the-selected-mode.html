SELECTING A GLOBAL TITLE TRANSLATION MODE BASED ON AN<br>
ORIGINATOR OF A SIGNALING MESSAGE AND PERFORMING GLOBAL<br>
TITLE TRANSLATION ACCORDING TO THE SELECTED MODE<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/217,100, filed August 312005 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/690,165, filed June 13, 2005, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference In their entirety.<br>

TECHNICAL FIELD The subject matter (|lescribed herein relates to performing global title translation (GTT).   More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to methods, systems, and computer program products for selecting a' GTT mode from a plurality of different GTT modes based on a message originator and for performing GTT in accordance with the selected mode.<br>
i<br>
BACKGROUND ART Within a signaling System 7 (SS7) network, the signaling connection control part (SCCP) protocoI is used for accessing databases and other entities within the network. The SCCP protocol also provides an advanced addressing capability where a subsystem is represented as an array of digits known as a global title address. By utilizing global title translation, the SS7 point code (PC) and subsystem number (SSN) of a final destination are not required to be known by the message oridinator. All the originator is required to know is the called party dialed digits arid the address of a node that can perform the global title translation. Global the translation is commonly employed to locate* databases that provide 800 number toll free and caller ID sen/ices within telecommunications networks. Depending on network topology, global title translation processing is typically performed at a signal transfer point (STP), a<br><br>
signaling gateway (SG), or a service control point (SCP) where one network makes an inter-connection to an adjacent network.<br>
The addressing information used to facilitate message routing at the SCCP level commonly includes a destination point code, a subsystem number, and optionally a global title. If a destination PC and SSN are not specified in the SCCP portion of an SS7 message, global title translation may be used to resolve a global title address (GTA), translation type (TT), and/or global title indicator (GTI) contained in the message to a destination point code and subsystem number.<br>
In addition to called party global title translation where global title translation is based on the SCCP called party address, methods for calling party global title translation have been developed. For example, in U.S. patent application no. 10/397,774, filed March 26, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by translation in its entirety. methods for performing calling party global title translation are described. In addition to performing called or calling party global title translation, there may be a need to combine these methods. However, there is currently no implementation known that combines calling and called party global title translation. Moreover, there may be a need to perform different types of global title translation based on the originator of a message. However, conventional global title translation requires that the same type of global title translation be performed for all signaling messages that require global title translation. Accordingly, there exists a long felt need for selecting a global title translation mode based on an originator of a signaling message and performing global title translation according to the selected mode.<br>
SUMMARY According to one aspect, a method for global title translation includes receiving a signaling message that requires global title translation. A GTT mode is selected f rom a plurality of different GTT modes based on an originator of the signaling message. A lookup Is performed in a GTT database according to the selected GTT mode. By selecting a GTT mode based on an originator of a signaling message, different GTT modes can be selected for different message originators.<br><br>
The subject matter described herein for selecting a global title translation mode based on an originator of a signaling message and performing global title translation according to the selected mode may be implemented using a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions embodied in a computer readable medium. Exemplary computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein include disl

Figures 2A and 2B are a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps for performing GTT according to a plurality of different modes according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein; and<br>
Figure 3 is a network diagram illustrating an exemplary operating environment in which may be desirable to perform GTT according to a plurality of different modes using the subject matter described herein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer program products for selecting a global title translation mode for a message and for performing GTT according to the selected mode. Figure 1 illustrates a signal transfer point (STP) 100 for performing global title translation according to a plurality of different GTT modes of an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 1, STP 100 includes a plurality of internal processing modules for routing and processing SS7 messages. In the illustrated example, STP 100 includes a link interface module (LIM) 102 for<br><br>
sending and receiving SS7 messages via SS7 signaling linkcs, a data communications module (DCIVI) 104 for sending and receiving SS7 messages via IP signaling links, a database services module (DSM) 106 for performing database related services, and a provisioning interface 108 for allowing an external system to provision databases within STP 100. In the illustrated example, modules 102,104, and 106 and interface 108 are connected via a counter-rotating, dual-ring bus 110.<br>
SS7 LIM 102 includes an SS7 level one and two module 112 for performing SS7 level one and two functions, such as error detection, error correction, and sequencing of SS7 messages. Gateway screening module 114 determines whether to allow messages into a network. Discrimination module 116 analyzes destination point codes in a message to detennine whether further processing is required for the messages or whether the messages are to be through-switched. Distribution module 118 distributes messages identified by discrimination module 116 as requiring further processing to other internal processing modules for the processing to be performed. Routing module 120 routes messages identified by discrimination module 116 as t)eing destined for other signaling nodes. Routing module 120 may access a routing database 122 to route the messages.<br>
DCM 104 includes a physical layer 124 for performing physical layer functions for IP signaling links. Internet protocol layer 126 performs IP layer, functions, such as IP fonwarding. Transport layer 128 performs transport layer functions, such as TCP, UDP or SCTP functions. SS7 adapter layer 130 performs functions for adapting SS7 traffic to be sent and/or received over an IP network. Gateway screening module 114, distribution module 118, routing module 120, and routing database 122 perform the same functions as those described above with regard to LIM 102. Hence a description of these functions will not be repeated herein.<br>
Database services module 106 includes a service selection module 132 for selecting a service for messages identified as requiring further internal processing. For purposes of explanation of the subject matter described herein, the selected service is assumed to be global title translation. Service selection may be performed based on one or more parameters in a signaling<br><br>
message, such as SCCP parameters including translation type, nature of address indicator, routing indicator, global title indication, number plan, etc. Global title translation engine 134 can select a global title translation mode from a plurality of different GTT modes based on a message attribute, such as message originator, and perform global title translation according to the selected global title translation mode. The message originator used for selecting the global title translation mode can be identified based on incoming linkset of the message, an OPC of the signaling message, a calling party address of the message, or any other suitable information indicating the source of the received message. The different GTT modes require searching a global title translation database 136 based on different matching criteria or qualifiers for translation matching of a signaling message to an entry in database 136. Further, the different GTT modes can be ordered in a hierarchy. The different GTT modes can be utilized in a hierarchical order untit a GTT mode is found which provides a matching translation in database 136 for the signaling message. For example, global title translation may first be attempted using a first GTT mode. If global title translation using the first GTT mode fails, GTT may be performed based on the remaining the GTT modes where the modes are executed in a hierarchical order from the most preferred mode to the least preferred mode.<br>
Global title translation according to the selected global title translation mode can be based on the calling party address, the called party address, the OPC, the GTI, the SSN, or other suitable information in a received message. Global title translation database 136 may include data structures for performing global title translation according to a selected global title translation mode. When a match entry is found in database 136, the message undergoing GTT is modified to include data from the matching entry. The data may include the point code of a destination node for final GTT or an intermediate node for intermediate GTT. Next, routing function 120 and routing database 122 can receive and route the message to a destination based on the inserted destination point code. Routing function 120 and routing database 122 can perform similar functions to those described with regard to LIM102. Hence, a description thereof will not be repeated herein.<br><br>
Exemplary GTT modes that may be implemented by GTT engine 134 include advanced called party (CdPA) GTT, CdPA GTT, and calling party (CQPA) GTT. Table 1 below shows an example of acceptable combinations of GTT selection qualifiers used by the advanced CdPA mode.<br><br>
Table 1 also shows the order of preference for the qualifier combinations. In Table 1, GTT is performed based on the parameters corresponding to the row with which a received message has the most matching parameters. From Table 1, it can be seen that advanced called party GTT can be performed based on called party parameters, such as the SCCP called party address, calling party parameters, such as the SCCP calling party address, and/or message transfer part (MTP) parameters, such as the originating point code (OPC).<br>
Table 2 shown below illustrates exemplary selection qualifiers in order of preference used for calling party GTT.<br><br><br>
From Table 2, it can be seen that calling party GTT is performed based on the calling party global title address, calling party point code, and calling party subsystem number.<br>
In performing GTT according to the called party GTT mode, GTT may be performed based on the called party address. This is the conventional manner in which GTT is performed. Hence, further description thereof will not be repeated herein.<br>
Table 3 below shows different exemplary GTT mode hierarchies that may be available on an STP.<br><br>
According to an aspect of the subject matter described herein, an operator of an STP can specify, for example, on an incoming linkset basis, the GTT mode hierarchy that the STP follows when performing GTT. If the hierarchy specified by the operator for a particular incoming linkset contains multiple GTT modes, the STP can go through each GTT mode in order until a matching translation is -found. Table 3 includes 8 different hierarchies, numbered 1-8. An operator may select one or more of these hierarchies. For example, if an operator selects hierarchy number 4 of Table 3, the STP follows the order of advanced CdPA, CgPA GTT, and CdPA GTT. An operator may also define his or her own hierarchy in which GTT modes are executed in the order preferred in the operator's network.<br>
Figures 2A and 2B are a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps performed by STP 100 in performing global title translation according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 2A, in<br><br>
step 200, STP100 receives a signaling message. In step 202, discrimination module 116 determines whether further internal processing is required. In step 204, if further internal processing is not required, control proceeds to step 206 where the message is routed to its intended destination based on the destination point code or optionally the originating point code-destination point code combination. In step 204, if discrimination module 116 determines that further internal processing is required, the message is forwarded to DSM106. In step 208, service selection module 132 of DSM 106 determines whether GTT processing is required. In step 210, if GTT processing is not required, control proceeds to step 212 where another selected service is performed for the message and the message is routed to its intended destination.<br>
In step 210, if GTT processing is determined to be required, control proceeds to step 214 where a GTT mode is selected based on provisioning information and message origination parameters. For example, an operator may provision all three of the above-described modes to be performed in a hierarchical order for a given linkset. Referring to Figure 2B, in step 216, a GTT lookup is performed according to the selected mode. For example, if the selected mode is advanced called party GTT, the lookup may be performed using the parameters and orders specified in Table 1. If calling party GTT is the selected mode for the linkset, the GTT lookup may be performed based on the calling party parameters and orders specified in Table 2. If called party GTT is selected, the GTT may be performed using the SCCP called party address.<br>
Once the initial GTT lookup is performed, control proceeds to step 218 ■ where it is determined whether a match was located. If a match was located, control proceeds to step 220 where the destination point code from the entry is inserted in the message and the message is routed based on the DPC and optionally the OPC. If a match is not located, control proceeds to step 222 where it is determined whether the current mode is the last mode defined for this linkset. If the current mode is the last mode and the translation failed, control proceeds to step 224 where a GTT translation failure is indicated. If the current mode is not the last mode, control proceeds to step 225 where the next mode in the hierarchy is selected. Control then returns to step 218 and steps<br><br>
220-225 are repeated for the next mode. Thus, the steps in Figure 2 illustrate that GTT can be performed according to a plurality of different modes and that modes can be organized according to predetermined hierarchy.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an SS7 network in which global title translation according to the subject matter described herein may be implemented. Referring to Figure 3, the SS7 network includes STPs 300, 302, and 304 for communicating signaling traffic between SSPs 306, 308, 310, and 312 and SCPs 314 and 316. Signaling messages may be communicated between STP 300 and SSPs 306,308,310, and 312 on linksets 318,320,322,324,326, and 328. STP 300 may be connected to SCPs 314 and 316 by linksets 330 and 332.<br>
In Figure 3, SCP databases 314 and 316 may represent different applications. SCPs 314 and 316 may have the same global title address. * Customers connected to end offices 306,308,310, and 312 may fonn/ard query messages to SCPs 314 and 316. STPs 302 and 304 may perfonn intermediate global title translation for the query messages to route the messages to STP 300. In order to determine the appropriate application to which a message should be forwarded, STP 300 may perform calling party GTT for messages originating on linksets 326 and 328. For example, it may be desirable to route all query messages from SSPs 306 and 308 to SCP 314. In a similar manner, it may be desirable to route all messages from SSPs 310 and 312 to SCP 316. This can be accomplished by performing calling party GTT for messages received via linksets 326 and 328. In order for applications on SCPs 314 and 316 to send messages back to the proper SSP, it may be desirable that STP 300 to perform advanced called party global title translation so that the response messages will be routed to STPs 302 and 304 for final global title translation. STPs 302 and 304 may then perform final global title translation using the called party GTT mode of operation.<br>
The subject matter described herein is not limited to the GTT modes described above or using the parameters described above to select among GTT modes. For example, GTT modes may be selected and GTT may be performed using any user-specified parameters, including l\/ITP, SCCP, TCAP, and or MAP parameters. Examples of such parameters include optional SCCP<br><br>
parameters, such as XUDT sequence numbers, TCAP parameters, such as opcode, and message type (begin, invoke, return result, and end). In addition, • GTT modes may be selected based on non-message criteria, such as time of day.<br>
The subject matter described herein for performing GTT using different modes is not limited to providing a GTT destination address as the result of the GTT. For example, GTT tables may be configured such that the GTT result is discard message, copy message, or send error message, without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein.<br>
It will be understood that various details of the subject matter described herein may be changed without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation, as the subject matter described herein is defined by the claims as set forth hereinafter.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
