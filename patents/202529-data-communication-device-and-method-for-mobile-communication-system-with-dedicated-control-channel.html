				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a data communication device and method for a mobile communication system, and in particular, to a device and method for communicating control information for a data communication service using a dedicated control channel in a mobile communication system which provides a multimedia data communication service.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Today, mobile communication systems tend to use a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology. To transmit control signals for call processing, a conventional CDMA mobile communication system based on the TIA/EIA 1S-95 standard multiplexes the control signals to a traffic channel for transmitting voice information. The traffic channel has a fixed frame length of 20ms, and a signal traffic with the control signals transmits the entire frame message by a blank-and-burst technique or shares the frame with a main user traffic by a dim-and-burst technique to transmit the control signals.<br>
Although this signaling technique is available for an IS-95 CDMA mobile communication system which provides the voice service only, it is unavailable for<br><br>
a CDMA mobile communication system which provides a multimedia data service including a packet data-service as well as the voice service. That is, the CDMA mobile communication system for the multimedia data service should include channels for the voice and data services to flexibly allocate the channels at the users requests. To this end, the CDMA mobile communication system includes a voice traffic channel (or fundamental channel) and a packet traffic channel (or supplemental channel).<br>
Conventionally, for the data service through the fundamental channel (or voice traffic channel) and the supplemental channel (or packet traffic channel), the CDMA mobile communication system should maintain the fundamental channel to transmit the control signal, even in a state where there is no communication between a base station and a mobile station, resulting in a waste of the channel and the radio capacity. In addition, the conventional CDMA mobile communication system uses the fixed single frame length of 20ms without respect to the size of a message to be transmitted, which may cause a low throughput and a traffic delay.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a dedicated control channel structure capable of efficiently communicating a control message between a base station and a mobile station, a call control message of a upper layer and a control message for connection of a packet traffic channel, by proving a dedicated control channel with which the mobile station can exclusively communicate the control signal to the base station in a CDMA mobile communication system, and a method for operating the same.<br>
-   2   -<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a device and method for generating and communicating a control message haying a variable frame length according to the size of a communication control message in a CDMA mobile communication system using a dedicated control channel.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a device and method for adaptively intermittently communicating a control message on a dedicated control channel according to absence/presence of the control message in a mobile communication system using the dedicated control channel.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a frame data processing device and method, in which a reception device receives frame data transmitted in a discontinuous transmission mode, detects an energy of the received frame data and judges absence/presence of an effective frame so as to process, the frame data according to the judgement.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a frame data processing device and method, in which a receiver receives frame data transmitted in a discontinuous transmission mode, detects an energy of the received frame data and judges absence/presence of an effective frame, so as to process the received frame data according to a frame detection result and an error detection result.<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided a *<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
-   5<br><br>
A CDMA mobile communication system according to the present invention additionally includes a dedicated control channel (DCCH) with which a mobile station can exclusively communicate a control signal to a base station. The dedicated control channel is a control channel which is exclusively used in communicating the control signal between the base station and a particular mobile station. In particular, the dedicated control channel is used in exchanging the signals for controlling connection of the traffic channel.<br>
Furthermore, in communicating a control signal using the dedicated control channel the novel CDMA mobile communication system uses different-sized frames of first and second lengths according to the size of the control signal. That is for the small-sized control signal, the system generates and transmits the frame having the first length; for the large-sized control signal, the system generates and transmits the frame having the second length.<br>
In addition, the CDMA mobile communication system determines presence/absence of the control message to be communicated, to control (repress) an output of the dedicated control channel when there is no control message to transmit and to form an output path for the dedicated control channel only when there exists the control message to transmit.<br>
Now, reference will be made to the CDMA mobile communication system<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The dedicated control channel is used in exchanging the messages for<br>
—  6-<br><br>
controlling connection of the traffic channel between the base station and the mobile station. Prior to describing the structure of the dedicated control channel, the channels used in the novel CDMA mobile communication system and their uses will be mentioned first hereinbelow.<br>
As to a forward link which is an RF (Radio Frequency) link for transmitting a signal from the base station to the mobile station, the common channels include a pilot channel, a sync channel and a paging channel (or a common control channel), and the user channels include a dedicated control channel, a voice traffic channel and a packet traffic channel. As to a reverse link which is an RF link for transmitting a signal from the mobile station to the base station, the common channel includes an access channel (or a common control channel) and the user channels include a pilot channel, a dedicated control channel, a voice traffic channel and a packet traffic channel.<br>
Therefore, a channel transceiver device for the base station and the mobile station in the CDMA mobile communication system consists of a pilot channel transceiver used for estimating the channel gain and phase and performing cell acquisition and handoff, a paging channel transceiver for performing initial synchronization and providing base station information, access channel information and neighbor cell information, a dedicated fundamental channel transceiver for transmitting/receiving voice data, a dedicated supplemental channel transceiver for transmitting/receiving packet data, and a dedicated control channel transceiver for transmitting/receiving setup/release and communication state-related control messages for the dedicated fundamental channel and the dedicated supplemental channel.<br>
-    7    -<br><br>
Table 1 shows uses of the respective channels for the forward link and the reverse link according to the services.<br>

The CDMA mobile communication system may have an idle mode, a voice<br>
-   8   -<br><br>
mode (or voice traffic channel using mode), a packet reservation mode (or packet traffic channel using mode) and a combined mode of the above-mentioned modes according to the service states. The dedicated control channel is preferentially used for a call providing a service for the packet reservation mode (i.e., a service using the packet traffic channel) among the above-mentioned modes. Here, the dedicated control channel is allocated to the mobile stations using the packet data service. However, exceptionally, the dedicated control channel may be used together with the voice traffic channel for the high quality voice service. In this case, the dedicated control channel can be shared by several mobile stations, instead of being exclusively used by a particular mobile station.<br>
The call processing for the packet data service is compatible with an IS-95 call processing method. In call setup for the packet data service, the IS-95 origination message and channel allocation message which are modified to support the packet data service are used; in call release for the packet data service, an IS-95 release order message modified to support the packet service is used. A call setup procedure and a call release procedure, at the request of the mobile station, are shown in FIGs. 1A and 1B, respectively, by way of example.<br>
Referring to FIG, 1 A, the mobile station is synchronized with the base sation through the sync channel in step 111, and the base station sends system, access channel and neighbor cell parameters to the mobile station through the paging channel in step 113. The mobile station then outputs an origination message via the access channel in step 115. The base station then acknowledges the origination message via the paging channel in step 116, and allocates the traffic channels via the paging channel in step 117. When the traffic channels are assigned for<br><br>
communication between the base station and the mobile station, the system transitions to a connection establishment state in step 121, in which the dedicated control channels for the forward link and the reverse link are also allocated.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1B, to release the call in the connection establishment state, the mobile station sends a control message for the call release request through the reverse dedicated control channel in step 151, and the base station then outputs a control message for the call release via the forward dedicated control channel in step 153.<br>
As illustrated in FIGs. 1A and 1B, the differences between the message used in the call control procedure for the packet data service and the message of the IS-95 standard, are as follows. In the origination message (see Step 115 of FIG. 1A), the packet data mode is added to the service option; in the channel assignment message (see Step 117 of FIG. 1A), packet data control channel allocation information is added to the allocation mode and used as an allocation indicator for the dedicated control channel, and dedicated control channel-related information (a channel identifier and a channel parameter) is included in an annexed field. Further, in the release order message (see Step 153 of FIG. 1B), the dedicated control channel-related information is included in the annexed field. Since the dedicated control channel is not yet established in the connection establishment procedure, the call setup-related messages are transmitted through the IS-95 channels (i.e., the sync, the paging and the access channels). In the state where the dedicated control channels for the forward and the reverse links are established by the call setup-related messages, the call control messages (e.g., the call release message) are transmitted through the dedicated control channel.<br>
-   10   -<br><br>
It is assuned that the dedicated control channel according to the present<br>
invention has the following characteristics. That is, a data rate is 9.6Kbps, a frame length is 5ms or 20ms long, and a frame CRC consists of 16 bits (for 5ms frame) or 12 bits (for 20ms frame). Further, in a user mode, not a common mode, several dedicated control channels are required. The dedicated control channels operate only in a competitive transmission mode, not a reserved transmission mode. In the following description, the frame length 5ms is called a first length of the frame and the frame length 20ms is called a second length of the frame.<br>
FIGs. 2A to 2C illustrate structures of a first length frame, a second length frame and a second length traffic frame, respectively.<br>
FIG. 2A illustrates the first length frame of 5ms period, in which reference numeral 211 denotes a fixed length message of an upper layer and reference numeral 212 denotes a first length frame communicated in a physical layer. The fixed length message may be a DMCH (Dedicated MAC (Medium Access Control) Channel) message, a DSCH (Dedicated Signaling Channel) message, etc. FIG. 2B illustrates the second length frame of 20ms period, in which reference numeral 221 denotes a variable length message of the upper layer and reference numeral 222 denotes a second length frame communicated in the physical layer. The variable length message may be the DSCH message. FIG. 2C illustrates a second length traffic frame of 20ms period, in which reference numeral 231 denotes a traffic structure of the upper layer and reference numeral 232 denotes a second length traffic frame communicated in the physical layer. The traffic may be a DTCH (Dedicated Traffic Channel) traffic.<br>
-   11   -<br><br>
The dedicated traffic channel has the functions of delivering packet data service-related control messages (e.g., a packet traffic channel allocation message, a layer 3 control message, etc.), delivering the IS-95 control message by encapsulating, delivering a short user packet, and transmitting a power control bit (PCB) through the forward link.<br>
In order to increase the throughput of the CDMA mobile communication system, the frame length of the dedicated control channel should be variable. In particular, a frame length obtained by dividing a reference frame length by an integer should be used to improve the throughput. For example, when the reference frame length is 20ms, it is preferable to design the system to be able to use a 5ms or 10ms frame. In the embodiment, it is assumed that the 5ms frame is used. In this way, it is possible to increase the throughput and decrease the traffic delay, as compared with the case where the 20ms frame shown in FIG. 2B is used.<br>
FIG. 3A illustrates a transmission time for the second length frame (i.e., 20ms frame), and FIG. 3B illustrates a transmission time for the first length frame (i.e., 5ms frame). The time required in sending a request message through the dedicated control channel and taking a corresponding action after reception of an acknowledge, is 80ms as shown in FIG. 3A when the 20ms frame is used, and is 20ms, which is a quarter of 80ms, as shown in FIG. 3B when the 5ms frame is used. Of course, this shows the case where the respective messages are so short as to be loaded into the 5ms frame, i.e., where the maximum gain can be obtained with the 5ms frame. Here, the reason that the throughput is increased is because the signal is efficiently transmitted, increasing the time at which the actual user data can be transmitted.<br>
-   12   -<br><br>
In the embodiment, the dedicated control channel is used in a control hold state and an active state out of the states for performing the procedures for the packet data service. Shown in Table 2 is the relationship between the logical channels and the physical channels for the forward and the reverse links.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>

DMCH          Dedicated              DMCH          Dedicated DSCH            Control CH           DSCH            Control CH Active State     DTCH                                            DTCH<br>
DTCH            Packet Traffic        DTCH            Packet Traffic CH                                                  CH<br>
In Table 2, the dedicated MAC channel (DMCH) is a forward or reverse channel necessary for transmission of a MAC message, and is a one-to-one channel allocated in the control hold state and the active state for the packet service. The dedicated signaling channel (DSCH) is a forward or reverse channel necessary for transmission of the layer 3 signaling message, and is a one-to-one channel allocated in the control hold state and the active state for the packet service. The dedicated traffic channel (DTCH) is a forward or reverse channel necessary for transmission of the user data, and is a one-to-one channel allocated in the active state for the<br>
-    13    -<br><br>
packet service.<br>
The control hold state in Table 2 means a state where although the dedicated MAC channel DMCH and the dedicated signaling channel DSCH are allocated to the forward and reverse links, an RLP (Radio Link Protocol) frame with the user data packet cannot be exchanged because the dedicated traffic channel DTCH is unestablished. In addition, the active state means a state where the channels DMCH, DSCH and DTCH are allocated to the forward and reverse links so that the RLP frame with the user data packet can be exchanged.<br>
Therefore, FIGs. 2A to 2C show the logical channel message frames or data mapped into the physical channel frames. Here, reference numerals 211, 221 and 231 denote the logical channel message frames, and reference numerals 212, 222 and 232 denote the physical channel message frames.<br>
Now, a description will be made as to the structures and operations of the first length frame and the second length frame for the dedicated control channel. The frame length of the dedicated control channel varies dynamically according to the kind of the messages. At the receiver, the frame length is determined every 5ms.<br>
In a packet channel connection control mode for transmitting the fixed length message of 5ms shown in FIG. 2A, request/allocation for the forward and reverse packet traffic channels is made using a 5ms request/acknowledge message. The forward packet traffic channel allocation which begins at the base station is independent of the reverse packet traffic channel allocation which begins at the mobile station. The connection control messages include a packet traffic channel<br>
-    14   -<br><br>
request message, a packet traffic channel allocation message and a packet traffic channel acknowledge message. These messages are transmitted through the DMCH among the logical channels. Table 3 shows channel allocation message fields for the reverse packet traffic channel, for the first length frame of 5ms.<br>

The 24-bit fixed length message in the form of Table 3 is transmitted with the 5ms frame, shown in FIG. 2A, of the dedicated control channel.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for allocating and releasing the packet traffic channel through the dedicated control channel, while the system transitions from the control hold state to the active state and then transitions again from the active state to the control hold state.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, it is assumed in step 411 that the base station and the mobile station maintain the control hold state in which the dedicated control channel is connected. In this state, the mobile station generates a control message for requesting allocation of the reverse packet traffic channel through the dedicated MAC channel DMCH and sends it through the physical channel, in step 413. The base station then generates a control message for allocating the reverse packet traffic channel via the dedicated MAC channel DMCH and sends the generated control message via the physical channel, in step 415. Then, the base station and the mobile station transition to the active state where the packet traffic channel is allocated to communicate the packet data, in step 417. In this active state, the mobile station initializes a Tactive timer in step 419 to check the time at which transmission of the packet data is discontinued. Here, if transmission of the packet data is continued before a value of the Tactive timer expires, the active state is maintained and then the step 419 is repeated to initialize the Tactive timer.<br>
However, if transmission of the packet data is not continued until the value of the Tactive timer expires, the mobile station perceives this in step 421, and generates a control message for requesting release of the reverse packet traffic<br>
-   16   -<br><br>
channel through the dedicated MAC channel DMCH and sends the generated control message through the physical channel, in step 423. In response to the control message, the base station generates a response control message for release of the reverse packet traffic channel via the dedicated MAC channel DMCH and sends the generated control message via the physical channel, in step 425. Subsequently, the base station and the mobile station release the reverse traffic channel and transition to the control hold state, in step 427, preparing for the next state.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, in the procedure of requesting and allocating the reverse packet traffic channel, the mobile station generates the reverse packet traffic channel request message including the requested channel data rate information and sends it to the base station. The base station then analyzes the received message to determine whether the requested parameter can be supported or not and sends, in answer to the request message, the reverse packet channel allocation control message of Table 3 to the mobile station according to the determination. When an additional negotiation is required, the above-mentioned request and response procedures may be repeated. Further, if there is no packet data to transmit during the packet data communication, the packet traffic channel releasing process is performed after a lapse of the time set in the Tactive timer.<br>
In a transmission mode for the variable length frame, the variable length message according to the IS-95 standard is divisionally loaded into the 20ms frames of the dedicated control channel, as shown in FIG. 2B. Specifically, the transmission modes may include a mode for transmitting the frame without error detection and correction by ACK/NACK (acknowledge/negative acknowledge), a mode where ACK/NACK occurs when an entire variable length message is received<br>
-   17    -<br><br>
and retransmission is performed for the entire variable length message, and a mode where ACK/NACK is performed for the respective frames.<br>
In a user data transmission mode, the RLP frames with the user traffic is divisionally loaded into the 20ms frames of the dedicated control channel, as shown in FIG. 2C. The user data transmission mode can be used in the event that it is inefficient to establish the packet traffic channel for transmitting the data because there is a small amount of the data to transmit.<br>
Now, a description will be made as to the physical device for transmitting the frames of the dedicated control channel in the CDMA mobile communication system using the dedicated control channel described above.<br>
First, referring to FIGs. 5A and 5B, the description will be given as to a frame transmission device for the forward dedicated control channel. In figures, a control message buffer 511 temporarily stores a control message communicated through the dedicated control channel. The control message buffer 511 shouldhave a proper size to store one or more second length frames of 20ms. Further, the control message buffer 511 interfaces a control message between an upper layer processor and a modem controller 513. Here, the upper layer processor sets a flag after storing in the control message buffer 511 the control message with the header information for discrirninating the 5ms and 20ms frames according to the message type, and the modem controller 513 clears the flag after reading the control message, so as to prevent over-writing and over-reading.<br>
After reading the control message stored in the control message buffer 511,<br>
-   18   -<br><br>
the modem controller 513 analyzes a header of the control message to detect a message type, outputs a message (or payload) to be transmitted through the dedicated control channel according to the detected message type, and outputs a control signal according to the detected message type. Here, the control signal generated from the modem controller 513 is a frame select signal for selecting the first and second length frames. As fox the message type, the control message may have a first control message of 5ms shown in FIG. 2A or a second control message of 20ms shown in FIG. 2B, and the size of the control data output from the modem controller 513 depends on the analysis result. That is, for the 5ms control message, the modem controller 513 outputs 24-bit data having the structure of Table 3; for the 20ms control message, the modem controller 513 outputs 172-bit data. Further, the modem controller 513 determines absence/presence of the control message to control an output of the dedicated control channel. That is, the modem controller 513 generates a first gain control signal when there is a control message to transmit, and generates a second gain control signal for repressing (checking) a signal transmitted to the dedicated control channel when there is no control signal to transmit. Here, the gain control signals are output control signals for controlling transmission output of the dedicated control channel. Although the present invention has been described with reference to an embodiment having the gain controller placed at a prestage of a spreader, it is also possible to place the gain controller at a following stage of the spreader.<br>
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) generator 515 adds CRC bits to the control message output from the modem controller 513 so that it can be possible to determine the frame quality (i.e., determine whether or not the frame has an error) at the receiver. Specifically, for the 5ms frame, the CRC generator 515 generates<br>
-    19   -<br><br>
16-bit CRC to output a 40-bit control message, under the control of the modem controller 513; for the 20ms frame, the CRC generator 515 generates 12-bit CRC to output a 184-bit control message.<br>
A tail bit generator 517 generates tail bits necessary for termination of an error correction code. This tail bit generator 517 analyzes an output of the CRC generator 515 to generate the tail bits according to the analysis and adds the generated tail bits to the output of the CRC generator 515. Specifically, the tail bit generator 517 generates 8 tail bits and adds them to the output of the CRC generator 515. Therefore, for the 5ms control message, the control message output from the tail bit generator 517 is composed of 48 bits as represented by reference numeral 212 of FIG. 2A. Further, for the 20ms control message, the control message output from the tail bit generator 517 is composed of 192 bits as represented by reference numeral 222 of FIG. 2B.<br>
An encoder 519 encodes an output of the tail bit generator 517. The encoder 5 ] 9. used in the embodiment, is a convolutional encoder or a turbo encoder using an encoding rate 1/3. An interleaver 521 interleaves encoded control data output from the encoder 519. That is, the interleaver 521 changes arrangement of the bits within the frame by the frame unit of the message, so as to improve a tolerance for a burst error.<br>
The CRC generator 515, the tail bit generator 517, the encoder 519 and the interleaver 521 constitute a control message generation block 550 for generating the control message and transmitting the generated control message via the physical channel. FIG. 5A shows, by way of example, the structure in which the control<br>
-   20   -<br><br>
message generation block 550 processes the control messages of both the 5ms and 20ms frames. However, it is also possible to include the control message generation blocks as many as the number of the frame sizes of the control message processed in the dedicated control channel, and generate the control message by selecting the control message generation block corresponding to the length of the frame to be transmitted by the modem controller 513. In this case, the respective control message generation block should include the CRC generator, the tail bit generator, the encoder and the interleaver according to the frame length of the corresponding control message.<br>
A signal mapping block 523 converts a transmission signal by converting a transmission signal of the logic "\" to "-1" and a transmission signal of the logic "0" to "+1". A gain controller 525, a gain multiplier, forms or blocks a path for the control message, being transmitted, of the dedicated control channel according to a gam control signal Gc output from the modem controller 513. That is, the gain controller 525 performs a DTX (Discontinuous Transmission) mode of operation, in which the path of the dedicated control channel is formed according to the gain control signal when there is the control message to transmit, and the path of the dedicated control channel is blocked when there is no control message to transmit.<br>
A serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 527 multiplexes symbols of the control message, output from the gain controller 525, to distribute them to spreaders for the corresponding carriers. Here, in the embodiment, 3 carriers are used, by way of example. In this case, there exist 3 carrier channels each having two phase branches (i.e., I and Q branches). Therefore, since the control message of the 5ms frame is composed of 144 symbols, the number of the symbols output through the 1 and Q<br>
-   21   -<br><br>
branches for the respective carriers is 24. Further, since the control message of the 20ms frame is composed of 576 symbols, the number of the symbols output through the I and Q branches for the respective carriers is 96. Occasionally, the dedicated control channel transmitter may use a single carrier. In this case, the S/P converter 527 simply performs a symbol distribution function for the I and Q branches of the single carrier. A PCB (Power Control Bit) puncturer 529 punctures a control bit to be output to the mobile station via the forward link. Here, the control bit may be a power control bit PCB for controlling a reverse link power of the mobile station.<br>
FIG. 5B illustrates a spreader for spreading the symbols output from the PCB puncturer 529. The embodiment includes the spreaders as many as the number of the carriers. For the convenience of explanation, FIG. 5B shows the structure of the spreader corresponding to a particular carrier. Referring to FIG. 5B, an orthogonal code generator 535 generates an orthogonal code used for the dedicated control channel. Here, the orthogonal code may be a Walsh code or a quasi-orthogonal code. Multipliers 531 and 533 multiply the orthogonal code output from the orthogonal code generator 535 by the corresponding I and Q branch signals, respectively, to output spread control signals for the forward link dedicated control channel. Although the invention has been described with reference to an embodiment which spreads the orthogonal code using BPSK (Bi-Phase Shift Keying) modulation, it is also possible to spread the orthogonal code using QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation.<br>
A modulator 537 receives PN codes (Pseudo random Noise sequence) PNi and PNq output from a undepicted PN sequence generator to spread the I and Q branch signals. For the modulator 537, a complex multiplier can be used.<br>
-    22    -<br><br>
Referring to FIGs. 5A and 5B, when the quasi-orthogonal code is used, the number of the code channels can be extended at the expense of an FEC (Forward Error Correction) rate. Further, in the forward link, a power fluctuation due to punctuation of the power control bit can be prevented through code bit level frame staggering.<br>
In FIG. 5 A, the frame length (,5ms or 20ms) of the control message to be transmitted is determined in the modem controller 513. That is, the modem controller 513 determine the frame length by examining the header information representing whether the control message stored in the control message buffer 511 is a 24-bit fixed length control message or a variable length control message. When the header information represents the 24-bit fixed length control message, it is determined that the control message has the 5ms frame length. When the header information represents the variable length control message, it is determined that the control message has the 20ms frame length. The modem controller 513 generates a signal for controlling the control message generation block 550 according to the frame length determination. Here, the numerals in sub-blocks 515, 517, 519 and 521 of the control message generating block 550 represent the bit numbers according to the frame lengths; for the 5ms frame, the upper parameters are used, and for the 20ms frame, the lower parameters are used.<br>
In addition, the modem controller 513 controls the dedicated control channel in the DTX mode. That is, in the preferred embodiment, the signaling message and the MAC-related message for the data service are transmitted/received through the dedicated control channel, contributing to an effective use of the channel capacity. The 1S-95 system is structured to multiplex the voice traffic and the signaling<br>
-   23   -<br><br>
traffic, so that the voice and signaling channels should be normally opened for the data service. However, since the dedicated control channel of the invention operates in the DTX mode, it is not necessary to normally open the channel for the control signal. When there is no signal information to transmit, it is possible to suppress a transmission power in a DTX gain controller, thus effectively utilizing the radio capacity.<br>
As to the DTX transmission mode of operation, when it is perceived that the control message buffer 511 has no control message to transmit, the modem controller 513 generates the second gain control signal so that the gain controller 525 maintains an output of the dedicated control channel to be "0". That is, the modem controller 513 generates the first gain control signal (Gc = predefined gain) when there is the control message to transmit, and generates the second gain control signal (Gc = 0) when there is no control message to transmit. The gain controller 525 may be positioned following a spreading stage. However, in this case, there may arise a problem of PCB puncturing. Further, although the invention has been described with reference to an embodiment performing the DTX mode for the dedicated control channel using the gain controller 525, it is also possible to block the signal path using a switch when there is no control signal to transmit to the dedicated control channel.<br>
FIGs. 5A and 5B illustrate the structure of the dedicated control channel transmission device for the forward link (from the base station to the mobile station). The dedicated control channel transmission device for the forward link should perform a PCB puncturing operation for controlling a transmission power of the mobile station. However, a dedicated control channel transmission device for<br>
-    24    -<br><br>
the reverse link (from the mobile station to the base station) does not have to perform the PCB puncturing operation. Accordingly, the dedicated control channel transmission device for the reverse link can be constructed as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the dedicated control channel transmission device for the reverse link has the same structure as the dedicated control channel transmission device for the forward link, except for the S/P converter, the spreader structure, the encoding rate of the convolutional encoder. In the embodiment, the encoding rate of the forward link encoder is 1/3 and the encoding rate of the reverse link encoder is 1/4.<br>
In transmitting the control signal using the reverse dedicated control channel, the dedicated control channel transmission device for the reverse link also determines the frame length according to the size of the control message and transmits the control message by the determined frame length unit. Further, the dedicated control channel transmission device for the reverse link examines presence/absence of the control message to transmit through the reverse dedicated control channel, to suppress an output of the reverse dedicated control channel when there is no control signal to transmit and to form an output path for the reverse dedicated control channel only when there is an actual control message to transmit.<br>
In FIG. 6, a spreader 631 spreads the control signal output through the dedicated control channel using the orthogonal code and the PN sequence.<br>
A device for receiving the control signals transmitted through the forward or reverse dedicated control channel should determine the frame length of the control<br>
-   25    -<br><br>
message to process the control message. The dedicated control channel reception device for the forward or reverse link can be constructed as shown in FIG. 7A and 7B.<br>
FIGs. 7A and 7B illustrate the dedicated control channel reception devices for the forward or the reverse link according to the present invention. The reception devices determine the frame length and whether or not the frame is being transmitted by detecting the CRC bits of the received control message.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7A, a despreader 711 despreads a received signal using a PN sequence and an orthogonal code to receive a dedicated control channel signal. A diversity combiner 713 combines the signals, received through multiple paths, output from the despreader 711. A soft decision generator 715 quantizes the received signal into a digital value of several levels to decode the received signal. A deinterleaver 717 deinterleaves the coded symbols interleaved during transmission to rearrange the symbols in the original state. Here, the deinterleaver 717 should be able to deinterleave both the 5ms frame and the 20ms frame, in order to deinterleave them in the same manner as the interleaver in the dedicated control channel transmission device. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 7B, it is also possible to use two demterleavers. In FIG. 7B, a first deinterleaver 717 deinterleaves the interleaved frame data in the same manner as the 5ms frame interleaver of the dedicated control channel transmission device. Similarly, a second deinterleaver 718 deinterleaves the interleaved frame data in the same manner as the 20ms frame interleaver of the dedicated control channel transmission device.<br>
A timer 719 generates a control signal for decoding the data received through<br>
-   26   -<br><br>
the dedicated control channel at fixed periods. Here, the tinier 719 is a 5ms timer. A first decoder 721 is enabled by the control signal output from the timer 719 and decodes the deinterleaved data output from the first deinterleaver 717. The first decoder 721 decodes the first control message of 5ms. A second decoder 723 is enabled by the control signal output from the timer 719 and decodes the deinterleaved data output from the second deinterleaver 718. The second decoder 723 decodes the second control message of 20ms. A first CRC detector 725 receives an output of the first decoder 721 and checks the CRC for the 5ms frame. A second CRC detector 727 receives an output of the second decoder 723 and checks the CRC for the 20ms frame. Here, the first and second CRC detectors 725 and 727 output a true signal " 1" or a false signal "0" as the result signal.<br>
A frame decision block 729 analyzes the result signals output from the first and second CRC detectors 725 and 727 to decide the frame length of the control message received through the dedicated control channel. The frame decision block 729 generates a select signal sell for selecting the first decoder 721 when the first CRC detector 725 outputs the true signal, generates a select signal sel2 for selecting the second decoder 723 when the second CRC detector 727 outputs the true signal, and generates a DISABLE signal for shutting off the outputs of the first and second decoders 721 and 723 when the first and second CRC detectors 725 and 727 both generate the false signal.<br>
A selector 731 selects the decoded data output from the first and second decoders 721 and 723 according to the output signals of the frame decision block 729. That is, the selector 731 selects the output of the first decoder 721 when the received frame is a 5ms frame, selects the output of the second decoder 723 when<br>
-   27    -<br><br>
the received frame is a 20ms frame, and shuts off the outputs of both the first second decoders 721 and 723 for the period in which the control message is not received.<br>
A modem controller 733 stores the received control message of the decoded data output from the selector 731 in a control message buffer 735. The upper layer processor then reads and processes the control message stored in the control message buffer 735.<br>
Now, operation of the dedicated control channel reception device will be described hereinbelow with reference to FIGs. 7A and 7B. The despreader 711 receives the control signal through the dedicated control channel, and despreads the received control signal with the PN sequence. The control signals received through the dedicated control channel are restored to the original control message by way of the reverse process of transmission.<br>
Thereafter, in the base station and the mobile station, the first decoder 721 decodes the 5ms frames and the second decoder 723 decodes the 20ms frames to process the control message. The first and second CRC detectors 725 and 727 then perform CRC checking for the decoded data output from the first and second decoders 721 and 723, respectively, and output the result values to the frame decision block 729. The frame decision block 729 then decides the frame length of the received control message and whether the frame is being transmitted or not, according to the CRC check results.<br>
When it is assumed that CRC5 denotes the CRC check result for the 5ms<br>
-   2 8    -<br><br>
frame and CRC20 denotes the CRC check result for the 20ms frame, the frame decision block 729 will generate the select signals as shown in Table 4.<br>
TABLE 4<br>
CRC Detector          Frame decision              Selector              Decision Results CRC5      CRC20            block True        False                 sell             1st Decoder Selected     5ms Frame False       True                  sel2             2nd Decoder Selected    20ms Frame False       False            DISABLE        Decoder Output Off    No Frame True        True                   XXX<br>
As shown in Table 4, when CRC5 and CRC20 are both not detected (i.e., false), the frame data is not received, which corresponds to a duration where the transmission device does not transmit the control message in the discontinuous transmission mode. However, when CRC5 and CRC20 are both detected (i.e., true), a frame error occurs.<br>
During transmission, the radio signal may include impulse noises due to other electronic equipments and the power line. In this case, the reception device of the mobile communication system may misconceive the noise components as to be the frame data. That is, there is a probability that the CRC detector will output a true signal as an output signal, even though the noise is received instead of the effective frame.<br>
-   29   -<br><br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a dedicated control channel reception device according to another embodiment of the present invention, which includes a frame detector for detecting an effective (or valid) frame of data when the transmission device of the mobile communication system discontinuously transmits the data of a single length frame. FIG, 10 is a flowchart illustrating a method for detecting the valid frame in the frame detector 740 of the reception device of FIG. 8,<br>
For the convenience of explanation, it is assumed that the size of the frame data transmitted from the transmission device is 5ms long and the number of the decoded symbols output from the decoder is 144.<br>
In FIG- 10, a register b stores a symbol energy value obtained by squaring an output of a diversity combiner 713 shown in FIG. 8, a registers accumulates the energy values output from the register b, and a register n stores the accumulated number of the input symbols. That is, the register b stores the energy value of the input symbols, and the register S accumulates the energy values of the symbols according to the number of the symbols stored in the register n.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 8 and 10, the received signal is despread in the despreader 711 and combined with the signals received through the multipath in the diversity combiner 713. A frame detector 740 then receives the combined signal output from the diversity combiner 713 and detects the valid frame by performing the procedure of FIG. 10, and outputs the true signal "1" or the false signal "0" according to the frame detection results.<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 10, the frame detector 740 initializes the register S<br>
-   30   -<br><br>
and the register n (S=0 and n=0) in step 1011. After initialization, if the diversity combiner 713 generates an output, the frame detector 740 calculates in step 1013 the symbol energy value by squiring the output of the diversity combiner 713 and stores the value in the register b. The frame detector 740 updates in step 1015 the registers S by adding the value of the register b to the previous value of the register S and updates the number of the input symbols by increasing the value of the register n by one. After increasing the value of the register n, the frame detector 740 determined in step 1017 whether the value of the register n is 144. That is, since the 5ms frame data is composed of 144 symbols, it is determined in the step 1017 whether the symbols of the 5ms frame are completely received or not. When the value of the register n is smaller than 144 in step 1017, the frame detector 740 returns to step 1013 to repeat the procedure for detecting the energy value of the input symbols and accumulating the value of the register S, since reception of the 5ms frame data is not yet completed.<br>
In the meantime, if the value of the register n becomes 144, the frame detector 740 senses complete reception of the 5ms frame data and compares in step 1019 the value accumulated at the register S with a threshold value. Here, the threshold value can be set to the minimum energy value of the 5ms valid frame, and can be used as a reference value for deciding whether the 5ms frame data is received or not. As the result of comparison, if the value of the register S is larger than the threshold value, the frame detector 740 proceeds to step 1021 to output the true signal to the frame decision block 730; if the value of the register S is smaller than the threshold value, the frame detector 740 advances to step 1023 to output the false signal to the frame decision block 730. When the false signal is applied to the frame decision block 730, the transmission device performs the discontinuous<br><br>
transmission mode to suppress transmission of the control message.<br>
When the frame detector 740 generates the true signal or the false signal in accordance with the procedure of FIG. 10, the frame decision block 730 generates the control signal for selecting the frame length by performing the procedure shown in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating a method for deciding the length and presence of the frame in the frame decision block 730 of FIG. 8.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the frame decision block 730 determines in step 1211 whether the frame detector 740 outputs the true signal. When a frame decision true signal is received, the frame decision block 730 checks in step 1213 whether the true signal is received from the CRC detector 725. If the true signal is received from the CRC detector 725 in step 1213, the frame decision block 730 generates an ENABLE signal to the selector 731 in step 1215, and then terminates the procedure. However, if the frame detection true signal is not received in step 1211, the frame decision block 730 generates the DISABLE signal to the selector 731 and terminates the procedure. In addition, when the signal output from the CRC detector 725 is not the true signal in step 1213, the frame decision block 730 generates the DISABLE signal to the selector 731 and terminates the procedure. Here, the frame decision block 730 can decide whether the frame data is received or not, depending on only the output of the frame detector 740,<br>
The selector 731 then selects the output of the decoder 721 to provide it to the modem controller 733 or controls (shuts off) transmission of the output of the decoder 721, according to the ENABLE or DISABLE signal output from the frame decision block 730.<br>
-   32   -<br><br>
The descriptions of FIGs. 8,10 and 12 are given on the assumption that the received frame is 5ms frame. However, the frame detection and decision method stated above can be also applied to a frame having a different length, in the same manner. That is, for the case of the 20ms frame, the deinterleaver 717, the decoder 721 and the CRC detector 725 of FIG. 8 are modified to receive and process the 20ms frame, and the frame detector 740 detects the frame according to the procedure shown in FIG. 11. That is, for the case of the 20ms frame, the number of the symbols output from the encoder of the transmission device is 576, so that the frame detector 740 accumulates the energy value of the symbols received during the 576 symbol duration and compares the accumulated value with the threshold value to determine whether the frame is detected or not. Here, the threshold value for the 20ms frame can be set to the minimum energy value of the 20ms valid frame, and can be used as a reference value for determining whether the 20ms frame data is received or not.<br>
Shown in Table 5 are decision results of the frame decision block 730 with respect to the output signals of the frame detector 740 and the CRC detector 725, based on the procedure of FIG. 12.<br>
TABLE 5<br>
Frame        CRC           Frame                         Selector              Decision Results Detector    Detector    Determiner<br>

In Table 5, when the outputs of the frame detector 740 and the CRC detector 725 are both not the true signals, the frame decision block 730 decides that the message frame is not transmitted from the transmission device ("No Frame") or that the frame has an error ("Error Frame"). In the embodiment, when the outputs of the frame detector 740 and the CRC detector 725 are both the false signals, the frame decision block 730 decides that transmission device does not transmit the message frame; when one of the outputs of the frame detector 740 and the CRC detector 725 is the false signal, the frame decision block 730 decides that the corresponding message frame is an error frame.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a reception device according to another embodiment of the present invention, which includes two frame detectors for detecting the frames having two different lengths. FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a method for detecting the valid frame in a second frame detector 741 of FIG. 9.<br>
In the following description, it is assumed that the first and second frames are 5ms and 20ms long, respectively. Further, the first frame of 5ms and the second frame of 20ms are composed of 144 symbols and 576 symbols, respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the reception device includes a first frame detector 743 and the second frame detector 741, to receive the frames having different lengths. The remaining structures are the same as those shown in FIG. 8. In FIG. 9, the first<br>
-    34    -<br><br>
frame detector 743 is a 5ms frame detector and the second frame detector 741 is a 20ms frame detector. The first frame detector 743 performs the same operation as the frame detector 740 of FIG. 8, as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
Likewise, the second frame detector 741 receives the output of the diversity combiner 713, detects the valid second frame according to the procedure of FIG. 11 and outputs the true or false signals according to the detection results. Referring to FIG. 11, steps 1111 to 1115 are identical to the steps 1011 to 1015 of FIG. 10. However, the second frame detector 741 repeats the steps 1113 and 1115 until the value of the register n becomes 576 in step 1117. Thereafter, in step 1119, the second frame detector 741 compares the accumulated value of the register S with the threshold value to determine whether the accumulated value of the register S is larger than the threshold value. As the result of comparison, if the value of the register S is larger than the threshold value, the second frame detector 741 outputs the true signal to the frame decision block 750, in step 1121; if the value of the register S is smaller than the threshold value, the second frame detector 741 proceeds to step 1123 and outputs the false signal to the fame length decision block 750.<br>
Upon reception of the true or false signal from the first and second frame detectors 743 and 741, the frame decision block 750 performs the procedure of FIG. 13. FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating a method for determining the frame length in the frame decision block 750 of FIG. 9.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the frame decision block 750 examines in step 1311 whether the frame detection true signal is received from the first and the second<br>
-   35   -<br><br>
frame detectors 743 and 741. If the frame detection true signal is received, the frame decision block 750 judges in step 1313 whether the frame detection true signals are received from both the first and second frame detectors 743 and 741. As the result of judgement, if the frame detection true signals are received from both the first and second frame detectors 743 and 741, the frame decision block 750 examines in step 1315 whether the first CRC detector 725 outputs the true signal. When the true signal is input from the first CRC detector 725, the frame decision block 750 advances to step 1317 to determine whether the second CRC detector 727 outputs the true signal. When the true signals are input from both the first and second CRC detectors 725 and 727, the frame decision block 750 generates the select signal sel2 to the selector 731 in step 1319, so that the selector 731 selects the frame output from the second decoder 723 and provides the selected frame to the modem controller 733.<br>
However, when the signal output from the first CRC detector 725 is not the true signal in step 1315, the frame decision block 750 examines in step 1321 whether the signal output from the second CRC detector 727 is the true signal. As the result of examination, if the input signal is the true signal, the frame decision block 750 goes to the step 1319 and generates the select signal sel2 to the selector 73 1. The selector 731 then selects the output of the second decoder 723 in response to the select signal sel2 and outputs the selected signal to the modem controller 733. However, when the output signal of the second CRC detector 727 is the false signal in the step 1321, the selector 731 outputs the DISABLE signal and terminates the procedure. The selector 731 then selects none of the outputs of first and second decoders 721 and 723. Thus, there is no data delivered to the modem controller 733.<br>
-   36   -<br><br>
In addition, when the true signal is input from only one of the first and second frame detectors 743 and 741 in step 1313, the frame decision block 750 judges in steps 1323 and 1329 whether the input signal is received from the first frame detector 743 or the second frame detector 741. As the result of judgement, if the true signal is received from the first frame detector 743, the frame decision block 750 examines in step 1325 whether the first CRC detector 725 outputs the true signal. When the signal output from the first CRC detector 725 is the true signal, the frame decision block 750 generates the select signal sell to the selector 73 1, in step 1327. However, when the false signal is output from the first CRC detector 725, the frame decision block 750 generates the DISABLE signal. The selector 73 1 then selects the first frame output from the first decoder 721 to provide it to the modem controller 733 in response to the select signal sell, and shuts off the outputs of the first and second decoders 721 and 723 in response to the DISABLE signal.<br>
Moreover, the frame decision block 750 determines in step 1329 whether the input true signal is received from the second frame detector 741. If so, the frame decision block 750 determines in step 1311 whether the second CRC detector 727 outputs the true signal. When the second CRC detector 727 outputs the true signal, the frame decision block 750 proceeds to step 1319 and generates the select signal sel2 to the selector 731. However, when the second CRC detector 727 outputs the false signal, the frame decision block 750 outputs the DISABLE signal to the selector 731. The selector 731 then selects the second frame output from the second decoder 723 to provide it to the modem controller 733 in response to the select signal sel2, and shuts off the outputs of the first and second decoders 721 and 723 in response to the DISABLE signal.<br>

In Table 6, the "False Frame" means that the transmission device does not transmit the message frame (i.e., "No Frame") or the frame has an error during transmission (i.e., "Error Frame"). In. case of "False Frame", the frame decision block 750 examines the outputs of the frame detectors 741 and 743 and the CRC detectors 725 and 727 to determine whether "False Frame" corresponds to "No Frame" or "Error Frame". In the embodiment, the frame decision block 750 outputs the decision results according to the outputs of the frame detectors 741 and 743 and the CRC detectors 725 and 727, as shown in Table 7.<br>

The outputs of the frame decision block 750 are delivered to the modem controller 733, as illustrated in FIG. 14.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, when the frame decision block 750 generates the select signal sell or sel2, the selector 731 selects the decoded message for the frame corresponding to the select signal and outputs the selected message to the modem controller 733. The modem controller 733 then delivers the received message to the upper processor. However, when the frame decision block 750 generates the DISABLE signal, the selector 731 blocks the output path for the decoded message. In this case, the modem controller 733 examines a frame decision signal output from the frame decision block 750. When the frame decision signal represents "No Frame", the modem controller 733 does not deliver the decision result to the upper layer on the judgement that there is no message transmitted from the transmission device. However, when the frame decision signal represents "Error Frame", the modem controller 733 delivers the decision result to the upper processor on the<br>
-   40   -<br><br>
judgment that the transmission device has transmitted a message but the message has an error during transmission. Therefore, the upper processor may take a proper action on the error frame.<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates a simulation result for processing control messages having a variable frame length through the dedicated control channel according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1:5, shown is a comparison result between the throughputs when the 5ms frame is used and when the 20ms frame is used for the dedicated control channel. Here, the forward packet traffic channel has a data rate 307.2Kbps, the 20ms fixed frame and 1% FER (Frame Error Rate).<br>
As described above, the DCMA mobile communication system according to the present invention has the following advantages:<br>
(1)	The control message transmitted to the dedicated control channel has a<br>
different length according to the size of the control message, so that the throughput<br>
may be increased and the traffic delay may be decreased by utilization of the<br>
dedicated control channel;<br>
(2)	Use of the dedicated control channel is discontinuously controlled<br>
according to presence/absence of the control message to transmit. Thus, the radio<br>
capacity may be increased by the DTX mode transmission;<br>
(3)	The system provides reliable transmission through faster error detection<br>
and correction, as compared with the 1S-95 system. Further, the system effectively<br>
uses the radio resources through utilization of an optimal channel environment and<br>
can provide the improved voice service through the dedicated control channel, so<br>
that it is possible to effectively support the IS-95 message; and<br>
(4)	In the CDMA mobile communication system, it is possible to reduce the<br>
-   41   -<br><br>
probability of receiving the error frames by using both the energy measurement result for the frame and the error detection result.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
