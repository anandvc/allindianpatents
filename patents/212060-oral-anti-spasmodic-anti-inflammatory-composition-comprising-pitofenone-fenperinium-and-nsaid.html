				<td>A NOVEL ANTI-SPASMODIC COMPOSITION. TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention describes a novel composition comprising a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug and their salts and their chirally pure forms and two drugs pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide  in  a pharmaceutically   acceptable combination.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Amongst the various non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs diclofenac particularly sodium diclofenac is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthiritis, osteoarthirities and ankylosing spondylitis. This has been disclosed in the following references (references from US Pat 5202159)<br>
As such, Intestinal, ureteric and biliary colic are extremely common clinical conditions requiring prompt medical attention to relieve the symptoms and help the patient get back to his/her vocation to avoid/minimize economic loss and reduce the load on the medical institution. Non -surgical treatment can provide immediate relief to the patient while investigations are being carried out to determine the future course of management. Currently available treatment modalities include anticholinergics like, atropine and its derivatives, ambutonium, glycopyrronium , isoperopamide, pripenzolate, etc. Combination therapy with<br>
analgin, pitofenone and fenpiverinium are also used. In addition, drugs such as meberverine valethamate bromide, clidinium are also used with.<br>
All drugs do not provide predictably uniform results in all patients. All the drugs used in these conditions do carry some side effects. Anticholinergics produce dry mouth, tachycardia in some patients, are contraindicated in glaucoma and prostatic hypertrophy and other antispasmodic agents may cause drowsiness as a side effect. Analgin is implicated in causing bone marrow depression.<br>
In the comprehensive review of a pharmacological properties of Diclofenac Sodium (Brogden et al, Drugs 20/24-48 (1980) it has been reported to have anti inflammatory activity, analgesic activity and anti pyretic activity. Conventionally it has been used in clinical condition for rheumatic disorders. Recently it has been reported to be of use in painful non-rheumatic syndromes for example biliary colic, (Grossi et al. current Therapeutic Research, volumes 40 No. 5 (1986)} and acute renal colic {Garcia Alonso F. et al, Evr. J. clin Pharmacol 40, 543-546 (1991)}<br>
However it has been reported that Diclofenac Sodium intramuscular is more effective than Narcotic analgesic like pethidine intramuscular in the management of acute renal colic and has fewer side effects. Based on the market survey among the various products available as antispasmodic one major product is composed of Analgin with two spasmolytic agents that is pitofenone<br>
hydrochloride and fenpiverenium bromide.<br>
No pharmacological composition has been reported in literature as well as no product is available where Diclofenac sodium is employed in combination with Spasmolytic agents.<br>
Our findings as disclosed in this patent application indicate that non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium when combined with fenpiverenium bromide and pitofenone hydrochloride forms an excellent antispasmodic composition. The composition when given orally and intramuscularally is not only clinically effective but is superior to the existing therapeutic agents. It is superior in two ways one it has more effective action and second it has fewer side effects.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel anti-spasmodic composition comprising diclofenac and like non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and their salts and pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a process for the manufacture of a novel anti-spasmodic composition comprising sodium diclofenac and pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide a novel injectable delivery system for the anti-spasmodic composition.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide an anti-spasmodic composition which can be taken orally by way of a Pediatric suspension, capsule/tablet.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An anti-spasmodic composition comprising a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, its salts and its chirally pure forms and two drugs pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide . The composition is capable of being used in the form of an injection or a tablet.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION  OF THE INVENTION<br>
The various non-stimulatory antiinflammatory drugs that can be used along with Pitofenone hydrochloride and Fenpiverenium bromide are selected from Aspirin, Diclofenac, Diflunisal, Etodolac, Flurbiprofen/Flurbiprofen Sodium, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin/Indomethacin Sodium, Ketoprofen, Mefnamic Acid, Naproxen/Naproxen Sodium, Paracetamol, Phenylbutazone, Piroxicam, Sulindac, Ketorolac, Nimesulide and the like.<br>
Several formulations can be made in the form of tablets or injections comprising the three ingredients Diclofenac and like non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and their salts, Pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverenium bromide.<br>
Besides the ingredients disclosed above the composition also<br>
comprises the usual excipients like starch, microcrystaline<br>
cellulose, DCP, purified talc, magnesium sterate etc described<br>
in the standard text. Tablets may be film coated, sugar coated or<br>
specially  coated  as  described  in  the  existing  art.<br>

*	Patients in the age group of 16-60 years<br>
*	Non-pregnant females were also included<br>
*	Patients with biliary, intestinal and ureteric colic<br>
*	Patients with any of the above conditions who could not be<br>
administered antispasmodic drugs belonging to the anticholinergic<br><br>
group (patients with glaucomam prostatic hypertrophy ) were also<br>
included.<br>
The following patients were excluded:<br>
*	Patients with peptic ulcer disease<br>
*	Patients requiring immediate surgery for their underlying<br>
condition were also excluded from the study.<br>
SAMPLE SIZE:       Fifty patients. STUDY PROCEDURE:    The study was open labeled.<br>
Patients attending the surgical OPD with complaint of moderate to severe abdominal pain and diagnosed to have one of the conditions listed in the inclusion criteria were enrolled. According to the study protocol, patients could be hospitalized for the acute condition for observation, and parenteral drug to relieve the acute pain was permitted. If on observation for a few hours, the patient is relieved of the pain but requires oral medication for continued relief of pain after discharge from the ward, the patient was put on test medication if the patient qualified the inclusion criteria.<br>
ADMINISTRATION OP THE TEST DRUG.<br>
The test drug was administered orally, The dose was one tablet three times daily for a maximum period of five days. Patients administered the test drug were kept in the emergency ward for observation till such time the patient was relieved of the symptoms. The protocol permitted patients to receive parenteral<br>
antispasmodic in cases of severe and disabling colic. Such<br>
patients were discharged on the oral test drug given in the dose<br>
of one tablet threice daily for a maximum period of five days.<br>
CONCOMITANT MEDICATION AND DIETARY ADVICE:<br>
Concomitant medication such as antibiotics, urinary antiseptics,<br>
medical therapy  for gall stones, etc were continued during the<br>
protocol therapy. Similarly, any specific dietary restrictions/<br>
advice were also continued.<br>
Patients were not permitted any concomitant antispasmodic therapy<br>
during the trial.<br>
ESCAPE MEDICATION AND TERMINATION OF PROTOCOL THERAPY:<br>
Patients not responding to the test medication within a period of<br>
two (2) hours were administered parenteral analgesic. Such<br>
patients were deemed treated and not replaced by fresh patients.<br>
All patients on enrollment were subjected to history, clinical examination and history of past drug therapy which included:<br>
1.	Duration of illness<br>
2.	Severity of pain<br>
3.	Frequency of antispasmodic drug intake<br>
4.	Duration of antispasmodic drug use<br>
5.	Relief with existing therapy; excellent, good, fair poor<br>
6.	Need to take parenteral antispasmodic while on existing oral<br>
therapy<br>
7.	Side effects with current therapy<br>
EVALUATION PARAMETERS:<br>
The following parameters were used to determine the efficacy and safety of the test medication.<br>
1.	Did the patient receive parenteral antispasmodic prior to oral<br>
therapy with the test drug.<br>
2.	Severity of pain after the first dose<br>
3.	Speed of relief<br>
4.	Did the patient need parenteral drug for pain relief after<br>
administration of the first dose of the test drug.<br>
5.	Severity of pain at home after subsequent doses<br>
6.	Duration of intake of test drug<br>
7.	Patient's evaluation of the test drug<br>
8.	Investigator's evaluation of the test drug<br>
FINAL EVALUATION:<br>
EXCELLENT: Acute pain relieved in less than half an hour. Parental drug for pain relief not needed. Drug well tolerated with out any side effects<br>
GOOD rAcute pain relieved in one to two hours without any need for parenteral drug for pain relief. Drug well tolerated without any side effects.<br>

From   the   above	tables   of   demographic   details,    there    is    no<br>
statistically   significant   difference	between   the   two   sexes   with<br><br>
relation to age, diagnosis and duration of illness. However, there is a statistically significant dirrerence in the mean number of tablets per week consumed for the relief of ureteric colic for female patients in comparison to males (p,0.05). Since there were no male patients with biliary colic, it is not possible to determine the difference between the two sexes.<br>
Past history of parenteral antispasmodic drug intake<br>
Almost all patients needed parenteral antispasmodic drugs for<br>
symptomatic relief while on oral  antispasmodic drugs. Although<br>
all patients were not able to exactly remember, the frequency of<br>
parenteral antispasmodic drug therapy varied from once every one<br>
month to two to four times every month.<br>
Most of the patients of both sexes reported uniformly good<br>
response with existing antispasmodic drug therapy. Five patients<br>
of intestinal colic, three of ureteric colic and two of biliary<br>
colic reported uncomfortable side effects such as, dry mouth and<br>
pa/petitions with anticholinergic drugs.<br>
Need  for additional parenteral antispasmodic drug in the present<br>
study:<br>
No patient required parenteral antispasmodic in the present<br>
study.<br>
