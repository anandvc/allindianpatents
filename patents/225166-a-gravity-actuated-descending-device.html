&amp;<br>
THE PATENT RULES-2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATIONS (SEE SECTION-10 &amp; RULE 13)<br>
A GRAVITY ACTUATED DESCENDING DEVICE<br>
SHAM BHALCHANDRA ANTOORKAR, AN INDIAN<br>
NATIONAL 102, SAHAJANAND COMPLEX, SHAHIBAUG, AHMEDABAD-3 80004, GUJARAT (INDIA)<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a gravity actuated descending device.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to a descending device which works on gravitational force, due to the weight of an object (person or material) without requiring an external source of energy and used for sliding/gliding down from a tall structure through a fixed track for the purpose of adventure sports, transportation of persons and/or materials or emergency rescue of persons and in which uni-directional latching means is provided for safe boarding and adjustable braking means provided for controlling the downward speed/movements and safe landing.<br>
Prior Art;<br>
Adventure sports are becoming popular day by day and the youth is looking for avenues providing thrill of adventurism. To satisfy such needs of youth, different types of amusement parks have been established during last few years having different types of rides such as Roller Coaster, Giant Wheel, Water Slides, etc. These require external power source and therefore there is a need for a device which can work without needing external power and serve to give thrill of adventurism to youth as well as rescue facility during emergencies.<br><br>
US 4667617: It discloses an arrangement of ropes and hooks to hold the boat to the shore. The arrangement also enables less experienced persons to use the arrangement and anchor the boat to the shore unlike other conventional arrangement ropes which demands experience and skill without which the attempts to more the boat can be both frustrating and/or dangerous. This patent has no common feature with the present invention except that it uses ropes. The application arrangement, scheme and/or principals used are completely different.<br>
US 5282136: It discloses controlling device to control the movement of the load raised or lowered by means of cranes with jib or boom. This controlling device for cranes avoids oscillation of load hung from jib or boom. This device also controls the winding and unwinding of the rope on rope drum. Control device basically consists of sensors, solenoid valves and a processor to process the information by sensors, to control the solenoid valves, to control the hydraulic pressure of oil, and to control unwinding and winding of the rope drum. Thus all these things such as sensors, processors, solenoid valves are electronic and electrical instruments which do not exist in the present invention.<br>
US 6085872: It discloses elevator driven by hydraulic jack directly connected to car. The very word elevator denotes elevating i.e. raising from lower lever to upper level. The hydraulic jack used for this purpose is power driven and needs external source of power such as electric motor and controls. The passenger car and counter weight travels on rigid rails vertically. The present invention is different and needs no external power for its movement from high point to low point. It works by virtue of weight of the person and object. Gravity Actuated Descending Device as described in this patent application does not raise or elevate the person; it enables him to come down in case of emergencies or offers simulated experience of glider or parasail.<br><br>
US 436174: It discloses few parts of the urinal block by which the device can be attached and detached by any person. It also provides a system whereby the water can uniformly reach all the areas of the bowl thereby keeping it clean. This invention has no common feature with the present invention and deals with a different field that is toilet blocks. The configuration used for uniformly spreading water has no similarity with the present invention. Present invention deals with automatic and hand operated braking systems to control the gravitational acceleration of the descending object or person.<br><br>
Further persons, specifically tourists, climb hills, and reach its top for pleasure, exercise or religious reasons, as most of the religious tourists places are having temples, etc. at the top of the hills. In climbing persons get tired and these persons/ tourists are required to climb down to the base of the hills and for which a need of descending device is felt.<br>
At some tourist places having temples at hill top and having road for vehicles, there is a parking problem for vehicles and these vehicles are leaving after the tourists/persons at hill top have to come down at hill base for parking. In such places also there is a need for the descending device to bring the persons from the hill top to the base of hill where the vehicles are parked.<br>
Further though the climbing to the hill top takes more time than the time required for climbing down, even then climbing down a hill needs enough time for a tired person, climbing down is also not very safe as in a hurry, person may fall down and meet with an accident, therefore there is a need for the descending device for transportation of persons quickly and safely to the base of the hill.<br>
Further, some material is also required to be transported from the tourist places at hilltop to the hill base and there is a need of a descending device which can serve the purpose of transportation of materials quickly at a low cost.<br>
Further in the present day development many tall buildings and other structures have been installed for catering to various needs of the Society. Some time there is a need to come down these tall structures/objects without using conventional ladders or lifts such as in case of fire or any other calamity/emergency people have to escape, for which there is a need for a descending device for rescuing the persons quickly and safely to the ground.<br><br>
The present invention solves the above drawbacks, mainly comprising a pair of track ropes, one end of each rope fixed to the high rise structure above the platform and the other end fixed to the ground keeping an angle of inclination 20 to 45 degrees, a pair of carriages, interconnected by a haulage rope passing over the rotating pulley, slidingly provided one each on said track ropes, said carriage comprises of a pair of side plates connected together and accommodating there between one or more grooved wheels mounted over the track ropes, a fulcrum pin with angular lever provided in upper portion of said plates, a brake shoe paddle fixed on said fulcrum pin, between said plates, a counterweight provided on a shorter arm of the lever and a seat attached at the lower portion of said plates. Typically this equipment is incorporated with a centrifugal speed governor, consisting of plurality of the pistons plying in respective cylinders connected to a bush mounted on the shaft of said rotating pulley through a spring, outer surface of pistons provided with brake liner and enclosed inside a drum having cover mounted on the shaft of the said rotating pulley.<br>
This equipment is not only having a limited use of emergency escape but also have some drawbacks: (i) While boarding the carriage from the platform at high rise structure, a person requires its full attention and to take due care for applying brakes by pulling the lever as there is no latching/locking arrangement and with partial weight of the person the carriage starts moving downwards if lever is not properly pulled to apply hand brakes, which sometimes result in fatal accident.<br>
(ii) The hand brake together with the centrifugal brake due to its constriction are not able to restrict the speed of descending carriage to safe limits in case of steep track rope angles with ground due to land restriction and the persons get injured while landing at high speed.<br><br>
Object of Invention:<br>

Detailed description of drawings:<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 to 35, the gravity actuated descending device (100) mainly comprises at least one pair of track ropes (1&amp;2), one end of each track rope connected to the high rise/tall object (3) such as hill, tower, building, mast, etc. above an embarkation platform or a monkey board (4) and the other end of each track rope fixed to the ground (5) such that each rope is inclined at an angle of 20 to 45 and there is a clear gap between sliders/trolleys (6) sliding on the track ropes. A pair of sliders (6) one each provided to slide over a track rope are interconnected by a haulage rope (7) which passes over a rotating pulley (8) mounted on a bracket (9) which is fixed to the tall object(3)preferably above the embarkation platform(4).<br>
There are three types of slider (6) having three different types of brakes, developed according to this invention and any one of them can be selected according to the requirement.<br>
First type of the said slider with brakes is called 'brake-apply type', as shown in FIGS. 3 &amp; 4 which provides moderate twist in track rope and is used in partial braking mode.<br>
The Second type of the said slider with brakes is called 'brake-release type' as shown in FIGS. 5&amp;6 which provides severe twist in track rope and is used in total braking mode.<br>
The Third type of the slider is called 'brakes on landing station' as shown in FIGS. 29 &amp; 31, which is without brakes, as it does not provide any twist in track rope or create friction in track rope but brakes are applied on wheels which rolls on rails provided at the landing station. The First type i.e. brake release type of slider(6) comprises a pair of side plates(14) connected together, keeping a gap there between, for accommodating therein a number of housings(10), preferably three. Each of the housing (10) is having a shaft (13) and a pair of grooved wheels (11) fitted on its shaft (12)<br><br>
and the ends of the housing shaft (13) projecting out through the side plates (14). Wheel (11) is free to rotate on its shaft (12) as well as through the gap between the side plates (14) and between the two grooved wheels (11) providing proper seat and grip on the track rope (1&amp;2). A pair of lever (15) is fixed to the projecting ends of the housing shaft (13) with the help of the toothed couplings (16) and the free ends of the levers (15) are interconnected with a horizontal member (17) with the help of a pin, thereby forming a flexible parallelogram ABCD. A handle (21) is fixed to the projecting out housing shaft (13) of the third housing i.e. the middle one. A clamp/connector (20) is fixed to the horizontal member (17) to which a seat or hook for seating/holding the user(s) is attached. The toothed coupling (16) connecting the lever to the housing shaft (13) permits the adjustment needed for desired angle( ) of the levers(15)for selecting the mode of braking to create sufficient twist in the track rope to get the total brake or partial brake or free downward slide of the slider(6).<br>
When one or more persons hang or occupy seat, due to the weight at the clamp (20), the housings (10) with grooved wheels (11) are partially rotated thereby creating desired twisting track rope, creating additional friction or drag due to twist in track rope which enables the complete stoppage of the slider or limiting the downward speed of the descending slider (6). The handle (21) is used as hand brake and on pulling, track rope is twisted further for additional braking action.<br>
The construction of Second type i.e. brake release type slider (6) as shown in FIGS. 5&amp;6 is mainly same as of the first type with a difference that the middle housing (10) with grooved wheels (11) is removed and the brake handle (21) is modified to be in the form of an angular lever preferably having one arm longer than the other. The angular handle at its joint is mounted on the side plates (14) with the help of fulcrum pin and the small arm is connected to the clamp (20) fitted to the horizontal member (17). arrangement is such<br><br>
that by the weight of the user track rope is severely twisted thereby completely stopping the downward movement of the slider and for allowing downward motion of the slider, the angular brake release handle (21) is pulled, thereby lifting/raising up the seat with the person and removing the twist from the track rope and thereby releasing the brake.<br>
The third type of slider is for the persons or youths who wants higher descending speeds and thrills. In this type of slider the user weight dependant self actuating lever brakes or flexible parallelogram with pair of grooved wheels housing used for twisting the track rope for creating braking effect are dispensed with. Instead free rotating wheels mounted on external surface of the slider are used for the application of brakes at the landing station, which is described hereinafter:<br>
To prevent any fall of user due to downward slide/movement of the slider during boarding at the embarkation point, a latching/locking means (22) as shown in FIG. 13 has been provided according to this invention. The locking means (22) comprises a unidirectional rotatable sprocket (23) fitted at the free end of a pair of lever arms (24). The two arms connected together at the sprocket end which is extended upwards from the slider. The other ends of the levers arms (24) are connected to the slider, preferably one arm connected to the side plates (14) and the other arm to the horizontal member (17). A link chain (25) is fixed to the track rope near the embarking platform (4). When the empty slider (6) moves upward, approaching the platform (4), sprocket (23) is engaged with the link chain(25) which permits only unidirectional (upward) movement and does not allow its rotation in the reverse (downward) direction, thus slider is locked at the embarkation point allowing boarding without fear and preventing any chance of accident. For starting the downward movement sprocket (23) is lifted up away from the chain (25) by preferably using the same handle (21) of the hand brake.<br><br>
In case the user fails to pull the hand brake (21) due to nervousness or being unconscious the slider (6) strikes the ground with speed, causing injury to the users. In order to avoid such collision, an automatic mechanical geared centrifugal brake system/speed governor has been provided according to this invention. As shown in FIGS. 14 &amp; 15, the automatic geared centrifugal speed governor (26) is preferably provided with the rotating pulley (8). The governor (26) comprises a plurality of brake shoes (27) each plying in respective recess (28), and held in brake shoe holder with spring attached to a rotator (30) mounted on a shaft (31) connected to the rotating pulley (8) passes and is being rotated by the moving sliders. The brake shoes (27) are enclosed in a drum (32), having a cover (33) and outer surface of each shoe (27) is provided with brake liner (34). The rotor shaft (31) passes co-axially through the drum (32). A gear chain having gears (35, 36, 37 &amp; 38) is mounted on the shaft (31) for proportionately increasing the speed of rotor assembly in comparison with the speed of the pulley (8), thereby moving brake shoes (27) away from the centre of the drum (32) due to centrifugal force, rubbing the break liner (34) against the inside surface of the brake drum (32), thereby creating frictional drag and reducing the speed of the shaft (31). When the speed of the shaft (31) is reduced to a desired limit the expanded springs (29) will contract and bring the brake shoes (27) back to their normal position thus controlling and maintaining the speed of the pulley (8) at a desired level and allowing the slider to land on the ground at the controlled safe speed even when the hand brake is not operated or it fails to work. Sometimes even this controlled descending may cause dashing of the slider against stopper at the end of the track rope, causing minor crash. Also when user fails to apply the hand brakes for complete stoppage of slider it causes jerk or crash. For complete safety, a pneumatic braking system (99) is incorporated with the device of this invention. The pneumatic braking system (99), as shown in FIG. 18, is actuated by cams (39) with cam lobes (40) mounted on speed reduction gear box (41) coupled to the rotating pulley (8) Refer DWG. Arrangement is such that the pulley (8) drives the speed<br><br>
reduction gear box (41), the output shaft with cams rotates by less than one rotation during the entire travel of slider (6) from embarkation platform (4) to the ground (5) and just before the slider reaches the ground the lobe (40) of one of the two cams (39) hits the roller valve (42) forcing the air into pneumatic cylinder, pushing out its plunger (43) due to air pressure from air compressor which hits the lever of frictional brake (44), stopping the movement of haulage rope (7) and bringing the slider (6) to complete halt, thus averting even a minor accident. After total stoppage of the slider, the air from the pneumatic brake cylinder is released to permit the movement of haulage rope (7) thus allowing the downward movement of the other slider at top, which is also brought to complete halt as it reaches the ground with users and same cycle of brake release takes place. This makes the device fool proof and offers protection against human error.<br>
When the device is used for recreational sports, users require high speed, thrills and some different landing. Therefore according to this invention, the slider (6) near the end of its downward journey travels on a track made of rope - rigid rail combination permitting horizontal travel at the landing station (98) having structural construction as shown in FIG. 28, which is fixed on the ground (5) by suitable fixing means. The structural landing station (98) has two or more adjoining rails (45) supported over the structural frame to receive the slider at the end of its travel at an inclination and then allowing horizontal travel of the slider (6). The slider (6) is provided with the external wheels (46). The wheels (46) which travel on rails (45) are provided with centrifugal brakes and/or normal frictional brakes operated by a handle (as shown in FIGS. 29, 30, 31 &amp; 32) to bring the slider (6) to complete halt.<br>
The base of landing station may be provided with water in a shallow pool. The pontoons/skis are fitted below the seat/chair of the slider (6) which on the landing create water splashing all around for the amusement and also act as a speed reducer for the slider.<br><br>
As a further alternative wheels can also be provided below the seat/ chair of the slider and landing station (98) is provided with sand bed at its base. This will provide amusement/fillings of sand landing as well as the sand bed act as a speed reducer for the slider (6), in case of failure of brakes or non-application of brake in time. Due to any reason, a shock absorber (50) is provided on each track rope (1 &amp; 2), before stopper, near the end of the rope anchored to the ground (5). The shock absorber (50) shown in FIGS. 22 &amp; 23 comprises an assembly of two or more telescopic pipes (47) through which passes the track rope (1&amp; 2) having shock absorber body plates (53) at both its ends. A compression spring (48) is provided inside the pipe (47) and surrounds the track rope (1 &amp; 2). A plurality of flexible rubber hoses each connected to hose holder brackets (52) at the two ends by pins (51) are provided surrounding the said telescopic pipe assembly. The brackets (52) are fixed to the body plates (53). The shock absorber absorbs the shock and impact caused due to slider (6) striking the ground, due to failure or non-application of brakes, due to any reason.<br>
Normally the track ropes (1&amp;2) are tied to anchors embedded in concrete on the ground. This invention provides a portable anchoring means which does not require concreting work. The portable anchor (56) according to this invention shows in FIGS. 24 to 27 comprises a frame (55) made of structural members bolted or welded together, to give any desired shape. The frame (55) is provided with a number of holes at desired places and at a desired inclination for passing there through nails (57) which are hammered in the ground. The nails are inclined in opposite direction to the inclination of the track rope as shown in FIG. 27, to improve the grip of anchor nails with soil and to make it firm and rigid. The nail (57) is provided with handle (57A) for easy removal. Turn buckle (54) is provided for anchoring the track rope (1&amp; 2) with the frame (55).<br><br>
The device (100) of this invention mounted on the high rise structure/object (3) with the help of clamps (19) shown in FIG. 21. One or more clamps (19) are used above the platform (4) for rigidly mounting the device. The rotating pulley (8) is mounted on the bracket (9) and geared centrifugal brake system controlling the speed of the rotating pulley or pneumatic brake system applied at the pulley (8) or hydraulic brake system applied at the pulley (8) for reducing the speed of the slider, are mounted on a suitable frame fixed on the platform (4) and/or to the structure (3). Attaching the device (100) with the help of the clamps (19) allows quick installation and dismantling of the device.<br>
For using this device of this invention for transportation or for sports purposes, the track ropes (1 &amp; 2) may be used in pairs as shown in FIGS. 33 to 36, i.e. each of the sliders (6) slides on double ropes or two or more track ropes. Further a wing (72) provided on wing frame (73) in the form of a kite or umbrella covered by fabric or paper etc. is connected to the slider (6) which gives a gliding feel to the users and at the same time is quite safe against any accident.<br>
This invention also provides a hydraulic brake system (97) which can be used in the place of mechanical geared centrifugal frictional brake system (26) used to control the speed of the descending slider (6). The hydraulic brake system as shown in FIG. 17 comprises a hydraulic cylinder (68). A piston (66) connected to a piston screw (67) is held between the two end plates (71) of the cylinder. The free end of the piston screw (67) projecting out of the cylinder end plate (71) and coupled to the drive/rotating pulley (8) mounted on the bracket (9). The pulley (8) is rotated by the haulage rope (7), interconnecting the sliders (6) which slide over the track ropes (1&amp;2). The piston (66) is locked by a lock (64) against the rotation but it is free to reciprocate to and fro between the cylinder end plates (71). The cylinder (68) is filled with oil (69) in a leak proof manner at the ends interconnected by piston ports/valves (71). The piston<br><br>
screw (67) is coupled to the drive pulley (8) with the help of couplings (62 &amp; 63) either directly or through a gear box.<br>
When pulley (8) starts rotating due to the movement of the haulage rope, screw (67) with the piston (66) starts moving inward pushing oil, inside the cylinder. The oil under compression finds passage through piston ports (71) and flows to other side of the piston, creating passage for piston and decides the rate of movement of piston which is directly proportionate to the oil flow rate through the ports (71). Thus the piston movement gets restricted due to oil flow through ports/valves which in turn controls the rotation of the rotating pulley (8) and the haulage rope (7) and the descending slider (6). The ports (71)/valves provided on the piston (as shown in FIG. 17) are such that the piston pressurized oil permits speed reduction in both the direction. Alternately ports/valves can be provided in such a manner that oil pressure and speed control is provided in one direction only and the movement of the piston in opposite direction is free. A Sheave (58) as shown in details in FIGS. 19 &amp; 20 is provided as a guiding device for haulage rope. The Sheave (58) comprises a housing (59) for mounting a pair of vertical grooved wheels/pulleys (60) and a pair of horizontal grooved rollers for guiding the haulage rope (7), interconnecting a pair of sliders (6). The haulage rope (7) passes through the guide pulleys (60) as well as rotating pulley (8) co-axially connected to two gear boxes, one speed increasing gear box and the other speed reduction gear box. Speed increase gear box helps in increasing the speed of centrifugal brakes instantaneously, through the brake shoes (27) towards the periphery of circular enclosure/brake drum (32), rubbing the brake liners (34) therewith, creating frictional drag which in turn reduces the speed of the guide pulley, haulage rope and the slider sliding down on the track rope. The speed reduction gear box is so adjusted that its output shaft, mounted with cams, rotates less than one rotation during the complete travel of the slider from the top of the platform (4) to bottom on the ground (5). The cam angfe is so adjusted that slider is about to reach the bottom of<br><br>
travel the cam lobe presses the roller valve which allows the air flow under high pressure from the compressor to actuate pneumatic cylinder and bringing out the plunger rod instantly, to actuate a lever of frictional brake for complete stoppage of the slider and thus avoiding accident or crash landing in case the user fails to use the hand brake.<br>
Generally a pair of slider/carriages/trolleys interconnected by haulage rope, slides on track ropes, while one slides down on one track rope due to the weight of the user, the other moves upwards on the other track rope. When first reaches the ground at the bottom, the other reaches the platform at the top and is occupied by the users. As soon as the users of the slider at the bottom arrive, the other slider moves down and the first one moves up.<br>
However instead of a pair of carriage, only one carriage and one counter weight carriage can also be used, the counter weight carriage being a little heavier than the slider/carriage for use. Once the users land from the slider on the ground, the counter weight being heavier moves down, bringing the slider at the top for further use and thus, the slider/carriage moves up and down on the same track rope and the counter weight on the other track rope.<br>
It is clear from the above description with reference to FIGS. Of the accompanying drawings that, the gravity actuated descending device is a versatile device to be used for transportation, quick escape or adventure sports, without using external source of energy and is quite safe. Various means, as described, can be used for descending at desired speed and with full safeguards against even a minor accident or crash, even when the user fails to apply hand brake or in case the hand brake fails to work.<br>
Various changes may be made in the form of invention without affecting the scope.<br><br>
