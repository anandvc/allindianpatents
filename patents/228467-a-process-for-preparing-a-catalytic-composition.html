The present invention relates to a catalytic composition which comprises an ERS-10 zeolite, a metal of group VIII, a metal of group VI and optionally one or more oxides as carrier. According to a preferred aspect, the catalytic composition also contains a metal of group II B and/or III A. The catalytic system of the present invention is particularly useful in the upgrading of mixtures of hydrocarbons which boil within the naphtha range containing sulfur impurities, i.e. in hydrodesulfuration with the contemporaneous skeleton isomerization of the olefins contained in these hydrocarbons, the whole process being carried out in a single step. This catalytic system can be used, in particular, for the upgrading of mixtures of hydrocarbons which boil within the naphtha range deriving from cracking processes, preferably mixtures of hydrocarbons having a boiling point within the naphtha range deriv-<br><br>
ing  from FCC  catalytic  cracking  (Fluid Catalytic Cracking).<br>
Hydrocarbons which boil within the naphtha range deriving from FCC (i.e. gasoline cut) are used as blending component of gasolines. For this purpose, it is necessary for them to have a high octane number together with a low sulfur content, to conform with the law restrictions which are becoming more and more severe, in order to reduce the emission of pollutants. The sulfur present in gasoline mixtures in fact mainly comes (&gt;90%) from the gasoline cut deriving from FCC.<br>
This cut is also rich in olefins which have a high octane number. Hydrogenation processes used for desul-furation also hydrogenate the olefins present with a consequent considerable reduction in the octane number (RON and MON) . The necessity has therefore been felt for finding a catalytic system which decreases the sulfur content in the hydrocarbon mixtures which boil within the naphtha range and, at the same time, minimizes the octane loss (RON and MON) , which can be achieved, for example, by the skeleton isomerization of the olefins present.<br>
The use of zeolites with a medium pore dimension as isomerization catalysts and the consequent recovery of octane in the charges already subjected to desulfu-<br><br>
Y<br>

ration are known (US 5298150, US 5 3£Q2££*™IIS. 53264620 /^^^   " I<br>
US 5318690, US 5360532,  US 5500108, US 5510016,  US i<br>
5554274, US 599439). In these known processes, in order to obtain hydrodesulfuration with a reduced octane number, it is necessary to operate in two steps, using in the first step catalysts suitable for desulfuration and in the second step catalysts for recovering the octane number.<br>
US 5.378.352 describes a process in a single step for desulfurating hydrocarbon fractions, with boiling points within the range of gasolines, using a catalyst which comprises a metal of group VIII, a metal of group VI, a zeolite selected from ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-35, ZSM-48, ZSM-50, MCM-22 and mordenite, and a metal oxide as ligand, with a process temperature preferably higher than 340°C.<br>
Some catalytic materials containing metals of groups VI and VIII, a refractory carrier and a zeolite selected from ZSM-35, ZSM-5, mordenite and fajasite, are described in EP 442159,_^P_437877/ EP 434123 for the isomerization and disproportioning of olefins; in US 4343J592 for hydrodewaxing; in US 4519900 for hydro-denitrogenation, in EP 07222 0 for a process in two steps comprising dewaxing and hydrodesulfuration; in US 4959140 for a hydrocracking process in two steps.<br><br>
We have now surprisingly found a new catalytic system with which it is possible to desulfurate, with high conversion values, mixtures of hydrocarbons that boil within the naphtha range containing sulfur and olefins and contemporaneously obtain the skeleton isomerization of the olefins present. This new catalytic system is also active at temperatures and pressures that are lower than those preferably used in the known art for desulfuration.<br>
Skeleton isomerization enables hydrocarbons to be obtained, which boil within the naphtha range and at the same time with very low RON (research octane number) and MON (motor octane number) losses.<br>
The results obtained do not only relate to the desulfuration of hydrocarbon cuts that boil within the "heavy naphtha" range (130°-250°C), i.e. cuts poor in olefins, but also feeds of "full range naphtha", which boil within the range of 35°-250°C, i.e. in the case of cuts rich in olefins. In fact, the catalytic system of the present invention has a high selectivity for desulfuration with respect to hydrogenation, which represents an additional advantage in terms of octane recovery in the end-gasoline.<br>

-	the complement to 10 0 is n-hexane.<br>
The catalysts are all activated following the same procedure, in a stream of H2S/H2-<br>
The catalytic activity is evaluated as follows: HDS conversion : 100 x (ppm S-n-ppm Sout) /ppm Sfn ISO isomerizing property:<br>
100 x (i-pentanes + i-pentenes)/ £ C5<br><br>

1.5 g of catalyst A, diluted with corundum, are charged into a reactor (3 0-50 mesh) and activated in the presence of H2S/H2 (10% vol) up to 400°C for 3 hours; the system is then brought under H2 pressure up to 10 bars and the model feed is sent, with a ratio H2/HC equal to 3 00 Nl/1. The operating conditions and catalytic results are indicated in Table 2. EXAMPLE 13: catalytic activity of catalyst B<br>

1.5 g of catalyst H are treated as in example 9. The operating conditions and catalytic results are indicated in Table 2. EXAMPLE 18 - (comparative) Catalytic activity of catalyst I<br>
1.5 g of catalyst I, not containing a zeolitic component, are treated as in example 9. The operating conditions and catalytic results are indicated in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 19 - (comparative) Catalytic activity of catalyst L<br>

1.5 g of catalyst M, containing ZSM-5 as catalytic component, are treated as in example 9. The operating conditions and catalytic results are indicated in Table 2.<br><br><br>
From the data provided in Table 2, it can be seen that under the same reaction conditions, intended as the result of the combination of the operating variables , the catalysts of the present invention allow much higher desulfuration conversions to be obtained than those with a catalytic composition containing a different zeolite from ERS-10 zeolite (catalyst M) . In particular at low temperatures (250-256°C), conversion values are obtained which are at least the double of those obtained with the catalytic composition containing ZSM-5. At these temperatures, with the comparative catalyst M, an isomerization is obtained which is<br><br>
comparable to that obtained with the catalysts of the present invention, whereas at higher temperature (280-297°C), the isomerization values obtained with the catalysts of the present invention are much higher than those obtained with the catalytic composition of the prior art containing ZSM-5 zeolite. Comparative catalysts I and L, which do not contain zeolite, have high conversion values for desulfuration but have a negligible isomerization capacity. In addition, under the same reaction conditions, the catalysts of the present invention have a greater selectivity for the isomerization of the charge, with respect to the hydrogenation of the olefins, as can be demonstrated by comparing the values indicated in the column HYD/ISO of Table 2. EXAMPLE 21: catalytic activity of catalyst C<br>
1.5 g of catalyst C are treated as in example 9 as regards the activation procedure and then tested on the model charge under the following operating conditions: T = 336°C WHSV = 4.8 hours'1 H2/HC = 300 Nl/1<br>
The following catalytic results are obtained: HDS (%) : 89.4 ISO (%):  61.5 HDS/HYD :  8.6<br><br>
HYD/ISO :  0.2<br>
From the above data it can be seen that at high temperatures the catalyst C, in addition to having a good desulfurating capacity, has a very high performance in terms of isomerizing capacity and contemporaneous reduced hydrogenating activity (HYD/ISO = 0.2), thus keeping a tight check, in the case of the desulfu-ration treatment of FCC gasolines, on the decrease in the octane number.
