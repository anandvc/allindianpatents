				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general relates to mobile devices. More particularly this invention relates to location based services. More particularly, the present invention relates to method and system of conveying of location of mobile device using automatically synthesized voice calls.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The patent publication WO2005015365A2 describes a communication system comprising remote units and a communication centre where one remote unit is capable of obtaining the location information of other remote units present in the network. The remote units have a text to speech controller which can convert text based location information to speech signal and then transmit it to other remote units. The publication further discloses sending additional information as well along with the location information. The remote unit comprises a button to transmit its location information to other remote units. The publication, however, does not explicitly mention the presence of a conveying list in the remote unit to which the location information is to be transmitted.<br>
The patent US7076235B2 describes a method to send a notification message to emergency contacts stored as a list in the memory of a wireless device. The notification message could be delivered through different delivery methods, voice being one of them. The wireless device may also send its location information along with the notification message. The patent however, does not explicitly<br><br>
mention the presence of a text to speech controller in the wireless device which converts the location information into voice message before transmission.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most of the location based services in current technology is either data or data over voice communication. Since it is data, some standards are necessary to effectively use the location based services which is time consuming. Also data transfer requires other end (i. e the called party mobile terminal) to recognize the data and have some processing module to suitably process the data to inform the user. In any case of data communication either SMS, GSM data call or GPRS the standard is necessary. SMS has further disadvantage of being store and forward technique. Added with standard, GSM data call has low baud rate and GPRS seems to be costly in developing countries. The most important advantage of current invention is that the called party need not have any Special processing module for this. The current technique works on any mobile phones (including CDMA) with only basic feature of voice calls.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method of conveying of location of mobile device using automatically synthesized voice calls comprising the steps of:<br>
a) putting location information in a memory of the mobile device,<br><br>
) fetching the location information from the memory and sending it as a Dice message to another mobile device authorised by the user to receive le location information by a text to speech controller;<br>
c)	maintaining   contact number of authorised users in a conveying list on the mobile device; and<br>
d)	dialling the numbers present in the conveying list one after the other and conveying the location information by the mobile device.<br>
The mobile device consists of list of numbers of other mobile devices called and if the mobile device, wants to convey the location information to other devices, it dials each number in the list one after the other and waits for the call to be picked up within the predefined time interval. If the call is not picked within the predefined interval the call is disconnected and the next number in the list is dialed. If the call is picked up by the other device, this device called gets the location information from the memory and generates the voice signal using Text to speech controller that tells the location information. After conveying the location information the call is disconnected and the mobile device gets the next number from the conveying list and dials it to convey information. If the dialed person disconnects the call, the mobile device cancels the call and dials the next number in the list. The mobile device keeps on conveying the information to the numbers in the conveying list either in loop or once depending on the setting. The location information in memory is updated frequently and further expanded to store the name of the<br><br>
person.<br>
Accordingly the invention also explains a system for conveying of location of mobile device using automatically synthesized voice calls comprising:<br>
a)	a memory for putting location information of the mobile device,<br>
b)	a text to speech controller for fetching the location information from the memory and sending it as a voice message to another mobile device authorised by the user to receive the location information; and<br>
c)	a conveying list for maintaining contact number of authorised users on the mobile device;<br>
where the numbers present in the conveying list is dialled one after the other for conveying the location information by the mobile device.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Minimum Components required for this invention: This invention tells about Conveying of Location of Mobile Device using automatically Synthesized Voice calls.<br>
a)	The system consists of a processing module to place in memory the location information that is obtained using any of the techniques.<br>
b)	The Text to speech controller that reads the location information from memory and voice signal is generated.<br>
c)	The generated voice signal is passed to the microphone of the mobile<br><br>
device.<br>
d)	The list of numbers called conveying list to which the calls has to be<br>
made.<br>
e)	The memory location to store some predefined information<br>
Description<br>
The mobile device [101] consists of list of numbers of other mobile devices called conveying list. The mobile device [101], if it wants to convey the location information to other devices, it dials each number in the list one after the other and waits for the call to be picked up within the predefined time interval. If the call is not picked within the predefined interval the call is disconnected and the next number in the list is dialed. If the call is picked up by the other device, this device called [101] gets the location information from the memory and generates the voice signal using Text to speech controller [207] that tells the location information. After conveying the location information the call is disconnected and the mobile device [101] gets the next number from the conveying list and dials it to convey information as explained before. Suppose even if the dialed person also disconnects the call, the mobile device [101] cancels the call and dials the next number in the list. In this way the mobile device [101] can keeping on conveying the information to the numbers in the conveying list either in loop or once depending  on  the setting.  The  location  information  in  memory is  updated<br><br>
frequently depending on the technique of obtaining and the method used, so that latest location information is stored in memory. This can be further expanded to store the name of the person (predefined information [202]) in memory of device [101], so that voice signal is generated for name of the person along with the location information, so that the others devices can know clearly about the person who conveyed them the location information.<br>
Workflow: When the mobile device [101] wants to convey the location information, the processor (CPU) [201] gets the number from the conveying list [203] and dials the number. If the call gets connected within the predefined time interval, the CPU signals the Text to speech controller [207]. The Text to speech controller [207] then reads the predefined Information [202] and location information [204] and coverts them to speech signal and sends it to the microphone [208].After sending the speech signal completely, the TTS controller (Text to speech controller) [207] send an acknowledgment to the processor [201]. The processor [201] disconnects the call and dials the next number in the conveying list [203]. Suppose even if the called device also disconnects the call, the processor [201] cancels the call and gets the next number from the conveying list [207] and dials it. In this way the mobile device [101] can keeping on conveying the information to all the numbers in the conveying list [203] either in loop or once depending on the setting.<br>
Some of the examples of using this technique-Case 1: The mobile system consists of list of numbers called the Conveying list.<br><br>
Conveying button is provided for the mobile system. When the Conveying button is pressed by the user, the mobile system dials the numbers in the Conveying list with a predefined timeout interval for connecting each numbers in the list. When the dialed number gets connected, based on the location text generated in any of the dynamically technique* it converts to a speech signal. This call gets automatically disconnected after the location information is talked out. This gets repeated for each number. This can be further improved by storing the name in predefined information of mobile system, so that name along with dynamically generated location is talked out by the Text to speech controller.<br>
For Example:<br>
The mobile device [101] of Mr. X has the list of 3 people numbers called [301], [302], and [303] in Conveying list. When Mr. X press the Conveying button the number of the first person [301] is dialed automatically. If the person [301] attend the call within predefined timeout interval, he can hear the voice Mr. X miller Road (assuming Mr. X in miller road) and the call gets disconnected automatically. After this, the call is dialed to the next person [302] .If the person [302] attends the call within predefined timeout interval he can hear the voice Mr. X infantry road (if Mr. moved to infantry road). Suppose if the person [302] does not attend the call within the predefined timeout interval, the call gets disconnected and the call is dialed to next person number [303]. The above process repeats depending on the option of loop or once.<br>
Suppose even if the dialed person also disconnects, the call is transferred to next person in the list.<br><br>
uase z:<br>
In an another case, if the person having mobile device [101] wants to keep informing either single or multiple people about his location continuously without disconnecting the call then he can set the option of his mobile system to conference call (that is he may manually call all the concerned people and tell them to be in conference) or he can ask the other person to be in line (if he is single person) and set the option to start Conveying. Now where ever the person having mobile device [101 ] travels, the location information is obtained dynamically and the location is talked out to other devices that are in line. The option to set at what interval the location information has to be given can be provided.<br>
For Example:<br>
If the person having mobile device [101] want to inform the person [301] in which route he is coming, he can ring up to person [301] and ask him to stay in line. The person having mobile device [101] enables the option stat Conveying. Assume person having mobile device [101] have set the interval option to 5 min. Assume person having mobile device [101] is moving from C.V Raman Nagar to Rajarajeshwari nagar by vehicle. Now While the person having mobile device [101] is moving, after ever 5 minute the location information is obtained and talked out by the mobile system like Mr. X cv raman nagar Mr. X A/GEF, Mr. X MG Road ,Mr. X Richmond circle, Mr. X KR market , Mr. X My sore Road , Mr. X rajarajeshwari nagar. The same method can be applied for conference call also.<br><br>
The accuracy of total system depends on accuracy of obtaining location information.<br>
"Location information can be obtained<br>
Using the cell id<br>
Using the GPS.<br>
Using GPS and GIS information.<br>
Etc.<br>
Using cell id<br>
Based on the location information transmitted by the BTS (Base Transceiver Station) of GSM network the mobile device can get the location information and store in memory location.<br>
Using GPS If the mobile device is fitted with GPS receiver, the coordinates of the location information can be obtained at some required regular interval and stored in memory location.<br>
Using GPS and GIS information.<br>
If the mobile device contains GIS information, based on the location coordinates obtained from GPS or any other technique, the mobile device can compute the location information by name and store in memory location.<br><br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
No standard is required. Can be easily adopted in mobile systems.<br>
It can be adopted in any mobile system only with basic feature of voice calls. The<br>
other end (the called party) need not any special processing module for this.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
