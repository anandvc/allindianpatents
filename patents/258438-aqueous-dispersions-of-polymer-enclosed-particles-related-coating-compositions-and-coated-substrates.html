FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to, among other things, aqueous dispersions<br>
of polymer-enclosed particles, such as nanoparticles, methods for making such an aqueous dispersion, polymerizable polymers useful in such a method, powder coating compositions formed from such an aqueous dispersion, and substrates at least partially coated with such a composition.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
[0003]	Coating compositions, such as powder coating compositions, often<br>
include colorant and/or filler particles to impart color and/or performance properties in the resulting coating. Pigment particles tend to have a strong affinity for each other and, unless separated, tend to clump together to form agglomerates. Therefore, these<br>
agglomerates are often dispersed in a resinous grind vehicle and, optionally, dispersants by milling or grinding using high shear techniques to break up the agglomerates. If nano-sized pigment particles are desired, further milling is often required to obtain the desired particle size.<br>
[0004]	Pigments and fillers usually consist of solid crystalline particles ranging<br>
in diameter from about 0,02 to 2 microns (i.e., 20 to 2000 nanometers). Agglomeration is a serious problem for nano-sized particle pigments and filler materials (such as carbon black) in particular because these nanoparticles have a relatively large surface area. Thus, acceptable dispersion of such nanoparticles often requires an inordinate amount of resinous grind vehicle and/or dispersant to effect de-agglomeration and to prevent subsequent re-agglomeration of the nanoparticJes.<br>
[0005]	The presence of such high levels of resinous grind vehicles and<br>
dispersants, however, in the final coating composition can be detrimental to the resultant coating. For example, high levels of dispersants have been known to contribute to water sensitivity of the resultant coating- Also, some resinous grind vehicles, for example, acrylic grind vehicles, can negatively impact coating performance properties such as chip resistance and flexibility.<br>
[0006]	Powder coatings compositions for use in coating various types of<br>
substrates are often desired. Such coating compositions can greatly reduce, or even<br>
eliminate, the use of organic solvents that are often used in liquid coating compositions.<br>
When a powder coating composition is cured by heating, little if any volatile material is<br>
given off to the surrounding environment. This is a significant advantage over liquid<br>
coating compositions in which organic solvent is volatized into the surrounding<br>
atmosphere when the coating composition is cured by heating.<br>
[0007]	It would also be desirable to provide an aqueous dispersion of resin-<br>
enclosed particles, wherein re-agglomeration of the panicles is minimized, and which may be suitable for use in preparing powder coating compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008|	In certain respects, the present invention is directed to aqueous<br>
dispersions comprising polymer-enclosed particles, wherein the polymer-enclosed particles comprise particles enclosed by a friable polymer. The present invention is also<br>
directed to powder coating compositions comprising such polymer-enclosed particles, substrates at least partially coated with such powder coating compositions, and substrates at least partially coated with a multi-layer composite coating wherein at least one coating layer is deposited from such a powder coating composition.<br>
[0009]	In other respects, the present invention is directed to methods for making<br>

These methods comprise: (a) determining the visible color of the preselected coating by measuring the absorbance or reflectance of the preselected coating; and (b) making a powder coating composition comprising a plurality of<br>
polymer-enclosed nanoparticles having a maximum haze of 10%, wherein a coating deposited from the powder coating composition matches the visible color of the preselected coating.<br>
[0014]	The present invention is also directed to water-dispersible, polymerizable<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]	For purposes of the following detailed description, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention may assume various alternative variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. Moreover, other than in any operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing, for example, quantities of ingredients used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0016]	Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth<br>
the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard variation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
[0017]	Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is<br>
intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10"<br>
is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10.<br>
[0018]	In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural and plural<br>
encompasses singular, unless specifically stated otherwise. In addition, in this application, the use of "or" means "and/or" unless specifically stated otherwise, even though "and/or" maybe explicitly used in certain instances.<br>
[0019]	As previously mentioned, certain embodiments of the present invention<br>
are directed to aqueous dispersions of polymer-enclosed particles. As used herein, the term "dispersion" refers to a two-phase system in which one phase includes finely divided particles distributed throughout a second phase, which is a continuous phase. The dispersions of the present invention often are oil-in-water emulsions, wherein an aqueous medium provides the continuous phase of the dispersion in which the polymer-enclosed particles are suspended as the organic phase,<br>
[0020]	As used herein, the term "aqueous", "aqueous phase", "aqueous medium,"<br>
and the like, refers to a medium that either consists exclusively of water or comprises predominantly water in combination with another material, such as, for example, an inert organic solvent. In certain embodiments, the amount of organic solvent present in the aqueous dispersions of the present invention is less than 20 weight percent, such as less than 10 weight percent, or, in some cases, less than 5 weight percent, or, in yet other cases, less than 2 weight percent, with the weight percents being based on the total weight of the dispersion. Non-limiting examples of suitable organic solvents are propylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monohexyl ether, ethylene glycol rnonobutyl ether, n-butanol, benzyl alcohol, and mineral spirits.<br>
[0021]	As used herein, the term "polymer-enclosed particles" refers to particles<br>
that are at least partially enclosed by, i.e., confined within, a polymer to an extent sufficient to physically separate particles from each other within the aqueous dispersion, thereby preventing significant agglomeration of the particles. It will be appreciated, of course, that the dispersions of the present invention may also include particles that are not polymer-enclosed particles-<br>
 [0022]	In certain embodiments, the particles that are enclosed by a polymer in the<br>
aqueous dispersions of the present invention comprise nanopartictes. As used herein, the term "nanoparticles1' refers to particles that have an average particle size of less than 1 micron. In certain embodiments, the nanoparticles used in the present invention have an average particles size of 300 nanometers or less, such as 200 nanometers or less, or, in some cases, 100 nanometers or less. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the aqueous dispersions of the present invention comprise nanoparticles that are polymer-enclosed and, therefore, are not significantly agglomerated<br>
[0023]	For purposes of the present invention, average particle size can be<br>
measured according to known laser scattering techniques. For example, average particle size can be determined using a Horiba Model LA 900 laser diffraction particle size instrument, which uses a helium -neon laser with a wave length of 633 nm to measure the size of the particles and assumes the particle has a spherical shape, i.e., the "particle size" refers to the smallest sphere that will completely enclose the particle, Average particle size can also be determined by visually examining an electron micrograph of a transmission electron microscopy ('TEM") image of a representative sample of the particles, measuring the diameter of the particles in the image, and calculating the average primary particle size of the measured particles based on magnification of the TEM image. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand how to prepare such a TEM image and determine the primary particle size based on the magnification. The primary particle size of a particle refers to the smallest diameter sphere that will completely enclose the particle. As used herein, the term "primary particle size" refers to the size of an individual particle.<br>
[0024]	The shape (or morphology) of the particles can vary. For example,<br>
generally spherical morphologies (such as solid beads, microbeads, or hollow spheres), can be used, as well as particles that arc cubic, platy, or acicular (elongated or fibrous). Additionally, the particles can have an internal structure that is hollow, porous or void free, or a combination of any of the foregoing, e.g., a hollow center with porous or solid walls. For more information on suitable particle characteristics see H, Katz et al. (Ed.), Handbook of Fillers and Plastics (1987) at pages 9-10.<br>
 [002S]	Depending on the desired properties and characteristics of the resultant<br>
dispersion and/or coating compositions of the present invention (e.g., coating hardness, scratch resistance, stability, or color), mixtures of one or more particles having different average particle sizes can be employed.<br>
[0026]	The particles, such as nanoparticles, present in the aqueous dispersions of<br>
the present invention can be formed from polymeric and/or non-polymeric inorganic materials, polymeric and/or non-polymeric organic materials, composite materials, as well as mixtures of any of the foregoing. As used herein, "formed from" denotes open, e.g., "comprising," claim language. As such, it is intended that a composition or substance "formed from" a list of recited components be a composition comprising at least these recited components, and can further comprise other, non-recited components, during the composition's formation. Additionally, as used herein, the term "polymer" is meant to encompass oligomers, and includes without limitation both homopolymers and copolyiners.<br>
[0027]	As used herein, the term "polymeric inorganic material" means a<br>
polymeric material having a backbone repeat unit based on an element or elements other than carbon.   Moreover, as used herein, the term "polymeric organic materials" means synthetic polymeric materials, semi-synthetic polymeric materials and natural polymeric materials, all of which have a backbone repeat unit based on carbon.<br>
[0028]	The term "organic material," as used herein, means carbon containing<br>
compounds wherein the carbon is typically bonded to itself and to hydrogen, and often to other elements as well, and excludes binary compounds such as the carbon oxides, the carbides, carbon disulfide, etc.; such ternary compounds as the metallic cyanides, metallic carbonyls, phosgene, carbonyl sulfide, etc.; and carbon-containing ionic compounds such as metallic carbonates, for example calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate.<br>
[0029]	As used herein, the term "inorganic material" means any material that is<br>
not an orgaiuc material.<br>
[0030]	As used herein, the term "composite material" means a combination of<br>
two or more differing materials. The particles formed from composite materials<br>
generally have a hardness at their surface that is different from the hardness of the internal portions of the particle beneath its surface. More specifically, the surface of the panicle can be modified in any manner well known in the art, including, but not limited to, chemically or physically changing its surface characteristics using techniques known<br>
in the art.<br>
[0031]	For example, a particle can be formed from a primary material that is<br>
coated, clad or encapsulated with one or more secondary materials to form a composite particle that has a softer surface. In certain embodiments, particles formed from composite materials can be formed from a primary material that is coated, clad or encapsulated with a different form of the primary material. For more information on particles useful in the present invention, see G. Wypych, Handbook of Fillers, 2nd Ed. (1999) at pages 15-202.<br>

include any inorganic materials known in the art. Suitable particles can be formed from ceramic materials, metallic materials, and mixtures of any of the foregoing. Non-limiting examples of such ceramic materials can comprise metal oxides, mixed metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal carbides, rnetai sulfides, metal silicates, metal borides, metal carbonates, and mixtures of any of the foregoing. A specific, non-limiting example of a metal nitride is boron nitride; a specific, non-limiting example of a metal oxide is zinc oxide; non-limiting examples of suitable mixed metal oxides are aluminum silicates and magnesium silicates; non-limiting examples of suitable metal sulfides are molybdenum disulfide, tantalum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, and zinc sulfide; non-limiting examples of metal silicates are aluminum silicates and magnesium silicates, such as vermiculite-<br>
[00331	In certain embodiments of the present invention, the particles comprise<br>
inorganic materials selected from aluminum, barium, bismuth, boron, cadmium, calcium, cerium, cobalt, copper, iron, lanthanum, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, selenium, silicon, silver, sulfur, tin, ritanium, tungsten, vanadium, yttrium, zinc, and zirconium, including oxides thereof, nitrides thereof, phosphides thereof, phosphates thereof, selenides thereof, sulfides thereof, sulfates thereof, and mixtures thereof. Suitable non-limiting examples of the foregoing inorganic particles<br>
include alumina, silica, titania, ceria, zirconia, bismuth oxide, magnesium oxide, iron oxide, aluminum silicate, boron carbide, nitrogen doped titania, and cadmium selenide.<br>

inorganic oxide, such as silica in colloidal, fumed, or amorphous form, alumina or colloidal alumina, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, cesium oxide, yttrium oxide, colloidal yttria, zirconia, e.g., colloidal or amorphous zirconia, and mixtures of any of the foregoing; or an inorganic oxide of one type upon which is deposited an organic oxide of another type.<br>
[0035]	Non-polymeric, inorganic materials useful in forming the particles used in<br>
the present invention can comprise inorganic materials selected from graphite, metals, oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, sulfides, silicates, carbonates, sulfates, and hydroxides- A non-limiting example of a useful inorganic oxide is zinc oxide.

In certain embodiments, the particles comprise colloidal silica. As disclosed above, these materials can be surface treated or untreated. Other useful particles include surface-modified silicas, such as are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,853,809 at column 6, line 51 to column 8, line 43, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0037]	As another alternative, a particle can be formed from a primary material<br>
that is coated, clad or encapsulated with one or more secondary materials to form a composite material that has a harder surface. Alternatively, a particle can be formed from a primary material that is coated, clad or encapsulated with a differing form of the primary material to form a composite material that has a harder surface.<br>
 [0038]	In one example, and without limiting the present invention, an inorganic<br>
particle fanned from an inorganic material, such as silicon carbide or aluminum nitride, can be provided with a silica, carbonate or nanoclay coating to form a useful composite particle. In another non-limiting example, a silane coupling agent with alkyl side chains can interact with the surface of an inorganic particle formed from an inorganic oxide to provide a useful composite particle having a "softer" surface. Other examples include cladding, encapsulating or coating particles formed from non-polymeric or polymeric materials with differing non-polymeric or polymeric materials. A specific non-limiting example of such composite particles is DUALITE™, which is a synthetic polymeric particle coated with calcium carbonate that is commercially available from Pierce and Stevens Corporation of Buffalo, NY.<br>
[0039]	In certain embodiments, the particles used in the present invention have a<br>
lamellar structure. Particles having a lamellar structure are composed of sheets or plates of atoms in hexagonal array, with strong bonding within the sheet arid weak van der Waals bonding between sheets, providing low shear strength between sheets. A non-limiting example of a lamellar structure is a hexagonal crystal structure, inorganic solid particles having a lamellar fullerene (i.e., buckyball) structure are also useful in the present invention.<br>

[0045]	The particles can also be hollow particles formed from materials selected<br>
from polymeric and non-polymeric inorganic materials, polymeric and non-polymeric organic materials, composite materials and mixtures of any of the foregoing. Non-limiting examples of suitable materials from which the hollow particles can be formed are described above.<br>
[0046]	In certain embodiments, the particles used in the present invention<br>
comprise an organic pigment, for example, azo compounds (monoazo, di-azo, P-Naphthol, Naphthol AS salt type azo pigment lakes, benzimidazolone, di-azo condensation, isoindolinone, isoindoline), and polycyclic (phthalocyanine, quinacridone, perylene, perinone, diketopyrrolo pyrrole, thioindigo, anthraquinone, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine, flavanthrone, pyranthrone, anthanthrone, dioxazine, triarylcarboniiun, quinophthalone) pigments, and mixtures of any of the foregoing.

[0084]	The aqueous dispersions comprising polymer-enclosed particles of the<br>

For example, in certain embodiments, the aqueous dispersions of the present invention are prepared by a method comprising (A) providing a mixture, in an aqueous medium, of (i) particles, (ii) one or more polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers; and/or (iii) a mixture of one or more polymerizable unsaturated monomers with one or more polymers; and/or (iv) one or more polymers, and then subjecting the mixture to high stress shear conditions in the presence of an aqueous medium.<br>
[0085]	Such methods are described in detail in United States Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 10/876,031 at [0054] to [0090], incorporated by reference herein, and United States Published Patent Application 2005/0287348 at [0036] to [0050], the cited portion of which being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0086]	hi other embodiments, however, the aqueous dispersions of the present<br>
invention are made by a method comprising (1) providing a mixture, in an aqueous medium, of (i) particles, (iii) a polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and (iii) a water-dispersible polymerizable dispersant, and (2) polymerizing the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and polymerizable dispersant to form polymer-enclosed particles comprising a water-dispersible polymer. In these embodiments, the polymerizable dispersant may comprise any polymerizable material that is water-dispersible and which, upon polymerization with the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, produces polymer-enclosed particles comprising a water-dispersible polymer, in some cases, a water-dispersible, friable polymer. In certain embodiments, the polymerizable dispersant comprises the previously described water-dispersible, polymerizable polyester polyurethane having terminal ethylenic unsaturation.<br>
 [0087]	In these embodiments, the water-dispersible polymerizable dispersant is<br>
capable is dispersing itself and other materials, including the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers, in the aqueous medium without the need for surfactants and/or high shear<br>
conditions. As a result, the foregoing method for making an aqueous dispersion of<br>
polymer-enclosed particles is particularly suitable in situations where use of the high<br>
stress shear conditions described United States Patent Application Serial No. 10/876,031<br>
at [0081] to [0084] and United States Published Patent Application No. 2005/0287348 at<br>

step of subjecting the mixture of particles, polymerizabie ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer, and water-dispersible polymerizable dispersant to high stress shear conditions.<br>
[0088]	In addition, the foregoing method of the present invention enables the<br>
formation of nanoparticles in situ, rather than requiring the formation of nanoparticles prior preparation of the aqueous dispersion. In these methods, particles having an average particle size of 1 micron or more, after being mixed with the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and the water-dispersible polymerizable dispersant in the aqueous medium, may be formed into nanoparticles (i.e., the nanoparticles are formed in situ). In certain embodiments, the nanoparticles are formed by subjecting the aqueous medium to pulverizing conditions. For example, the particles can be milled with milling media having a particle size of less than 0.5 millimeters, or less than 0.3 millimeters, or, in some cases, less than 0.1 millimeters. In these embodiments, the particles can be milled to nanoparticle size in a high energy mill in the presence of the aqueous medium, the polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and the water-dispersible polymerizable dispersant. If desired, another dispersant can be used, such as SOLSPERSE 27000, available from Avecia, Inc.<br>
[0089]	As indicated, the foregoing methods for making aqueous dispersions of<br>
the present invention include the step of free-radically polymerizing the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and polymerizable dispersant to form polymer-enclosed particles comprising a water-dispersible polymer. Li certain embodiments, at least a portion of the polymerization occurs during formation of nanoparticles, if applicable. Also, a free radical initiator may be used. Both water and oil soluble initiators can be used.<br>
 [0090]	Non-limiting examples suitable water-soluble initiators include<br>
ammonium peroxydisulfate, potassium peroxydisulfate and hydrogen peroxide. Non-limiting examples of oil soluble initiators include t-butyl hydroperoxide, dilauryl peroxide and 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile). In many cases, the reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging from 20° to 80°C. The polymerization can be carried out in either a batch or a continuous process. The length of time necessary to cany out the polymerization can range from, for example, 10 minutes to 6 hours, provided that the time is sufficient to form a polymer in situ from the one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
[0091]	Once the polymerization process is complete, the resultant product is a<br>
stable dispersion of polymer-enclosed particles in an aqueous medium which can contain some organic solvent. Some or all of the organic solvent can be removed via reduced pressure distillation at a temperature, for example, of less than 40°C,   As used herein, the term "stable dispersion" or "stably dispersed" means that the polymer-enclosed particles neither settle nor coagulate nor flocculate from the aqueous medium upon standing.<br>

aqueous dispersions of the present invention in an amount of at: least 10 weight percent, or in an amount of 10 to 80 weight percent, or in an amount of 25 to 50 weight percent, or in an amount of 25 to 40 weight percent, with weight percents being based on weight of total solids present in the dispersion.<br>
[0093]	In certain embodiments, the dispersed polymer-enclosed particles have a<br>
maximum haze of 10%, or, in some cases, a maximum haze of 5%, or, in yet other cases, a maximum haze of 1 %, or, in other embodiments, a maximum haze of 0-5%. As used herein, "haze" is determined by ASTM D1003.<br>

determined by first having the particles, such as nanoparticles, dispersed in a liquid (such as water, organic solvent, and/or a dispersant, as described herein) and then measuring these dispersions diluted in a solvent, for example, butyl acetate, using a Byk-Gardner TCS (The Color Sphere) instrument having a 500 micron cell path length. Because the % haze of a liquid sample is concentration dependent, the % haze as used herein is<br>
reported at a transmittance of about 15% to about 20% at the wavelength of maximum<br>
absorbance.   An acceptable haze may be achieved for relatively large particles when the<br>
difference in refractive index between the particles and the surrounding medium is low.<br>
Conversely, for smaller particles, greater refractive index differences between the<br>
particle and the surrounding medium may provide an acceptable haze.<br>
[0095]	In the foregoing methods of the present invention, upon reaction of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer with the polymerizable dispersant, polymer-enclosed<br>
particles are formed, which, as previously indicated, the inventors believe results in a<br>
phase barrier that physically prevents the particles, particularly nanoparticles, from re-<br>
agglomerating within the aqueous dispersion. As a result, the foregoing methods of the<br>
present invention result in an aqueous dispersion of particles, such as nanoparticles,<br>
wherein reagglomeration of the nanoparticles is minimized or avoided altogether.<br>
[0096J	In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to methods for<br>
making polymer-enclosed particles. These methods comprise the methods for making an aqueous dispersion of polymer-enclosed particles, as previously described, wherein the polymer-enclosed particles comprise a friable polymer and further comprising (1) removing water from the aqueous dispersion to form a solid material comprising the polymer-enclosed particles, and (2) fragmenting the solid material. In these embodiments, the water can be removed from the aqueous dispersion by any suitable drying method, such as through the use of a drum dryer, a roller dryer, a spray dryer, or the like. Moreover, the solid material can be fragmented by any suitable technique, such as through the use of a hammer mill or the like. Following fragmentation, the resultant granules may be further processed, such as by being screened in a classifier, before packaging.<br>
[0097]	The present invention is also directed to powder coating compositions<br>
formed from an aqueous dispersion of polymer-enclosed particles. As used herein, the term "powder coating composition" refers to compositions suitable for producing a coating, which are embodied in solid particulate form, rather than liquid form. In certain embodiments of the powder coating compositions of the present invention, the polymer-enclosed particles comprise nanoparticles.<br>
[0098]	In addition to the polymer-enclosed particles, the powder coating<br>
compositions of the present invention may comprise a particulate film-forming resin. Suitable film-forming resins include, for example, an epoxy resin, such as an epoxy<br>
group-containing acrylic polymer or a polyglycidyl ether of a poJyhydric alcohol and a suitable curing agent for the epoxy resin, such as a polyfiinctional carboxylic acid group-containing material or a dicyanamide. Examples of curable paniculate resinous materials are described in Reissue United States Patent No. RE 32,261 and United States Patent No. 4,804,581, incorporated by reference herein. Examples of other suitable particulate film-forming resins are carboxylic acid functional resins, such as carboxylic acid functional polyesters and acrylic polymers and suitable curing agents for such materials, such as triglycidyl isocyanurate and beta-hydroxyalkylamide curing agents as described, for example, in United States Patent No. 4,801,680 and United States Patent No. 4,988,767, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0099]	In certain embodiments, the powder coating compositions of the present<br>
invention contain from 50 to 90 percent by weight, such as 60 to 80 percent by weight, of<br>
the particulate film-forming resin, based on the total weight of the powder coating<br>
composition. In certain embodiments, the powder coating compositions of the present<br>
invention contain from 0.1 to 50 percent'by weight, such as 1 to 20 percent by weight, of<br>
polymer-enclosed particles, based on the total weight of the powder coating composition.<br>
[0100]	The powder coating compositions of the present invention can optionally<br>
include other materials such as other pigments, fillers, light stabilizers, flow modifiers,<br>
anti-popping agents, and anti-oxidants. Suitable pigments include, for example, titanium<br>
dioxide, ultramarine blue, phthalocyanine blue, phthalocyanine green, carbon black,<br>
graphite fibrils, black iron oxide, chromium green oxide, ferride yellow and quindo red.<br>
[0101]	Anti-popping agents can be added to the composition to allow any volatile<br>
material to escape from the film during baking. Benzoin is a commonly preferred ami-popping agent and when used is generally present in amounts of from 0-5 to 3.0 percent by weight based on total weight of the powder coating composition.<br>
[102]	In certain embodiments, the powder coating compositions of the present<br>
invention include fumed silica or the like to reduce caking of the powder during storage.<br>
An example of a fumed silica is sold by Cabot Corporation under the trademark CAB-O-<br>
SEL. The fumed silica is present in amounts ranging from 0.1 to 1 percent by weight<br>
based on total weight of the powder coating formulation.<br>
[103]	The present invention is also directed to methods for making powder<br>
coating compositions. In certain embodiments, wherein the polymer-enclosed particles<br>
comprise a friable polymer, the polymer-enclosed particles and other coating<br>
components are all embodied in a dried, paniculate form, blended together, and then melt<br>
blended in an extruder. In other embodiments, however, such as those cases wherein an<br>
aqueous dispersion of polymer-enclosed particles is used that does not include a friable<br>
polymer, the powder coating compositions of the present invention are made by a<br>
method comprising (1) introducing to an extruder powder coating composition<br>
components comprising: (a) an aqueous dispersion of polymer-enclosed panicles, and (b)<br>
dry materials; (2) blending (a) and (b) in the extruder; (3) devolatilizing the blend to<br>
form an extrudate; (4) cooling the extrudate, and (5) milling the extrudate to a desired<br>
panicle size. As used herein, the term "devolatize" means to remove volatile materials,<br>
including water and organic solvents. In certain embodiments, such powder coating<br>
compositions are made by a method and/or apparatus described in United States Patent<br>
Application Publication Nos. 2005/0212159A1; 2005/0213423AL; and/or<br>
2005/0212171 Al, the relevant disclosures of which being incorporated herein by<br>
reference.	:<br>
[0104]	In these methods of the present invention, the dry materials may include<br>
the paniculate film-forming resin described earlier as well as any other composition<br>
additives. The dry materials may be first blending irva high shear mixer such as a<br>
planetary mixture. In certain embodiments, the dry materials and the aqueous dispersion<br>
of the present invention are then blended in an extruder at a temperature ranging from<br>
80°C to 150°C. The extrudate is then cooled and pulverized into a paniculate blend.<br>
[0105]	The powder coating compositions of the invention can be applied to a<br>
variety of substrates including metallic substrates, for example, aluminum and steel substrates. The powder coating compositions are often applied by spraying, and in the case of a metal substrate, by electrostatic spraying, or by the use of a fluidized bed. The powder coating compositions of .the present invention can be applied in a single sweep or in several passes to provide a film having a thickness after cure of from about 1 to 10 mils (25 to 250 micrometers), usually about 2 to 4 rails (50 to 100 micrometers). In many cases, after application of the powder coating composition, the coated substrate is heated to a temperature sufficient to cure the coating, often to a temperature ranging from 25()°F to 500"F (121.1°C to 260.0"C) for 1 to 60 minutes, such as 300°F to 400T (148.9°C to 204.4°C) for 15 to 30 minutes.<br>
 [0106]	As a result, the present invention is also directed to substrates, such as<br>
metal substrates, at least partially coated by a coating deposited from a powder coating composition of the present invention.<br>
[01071	The powder coating compositions of the present invention may be used to<br>
form a single coating, for example, a monocoat, a clear top coating or a base coat in a two-layered system or both; or as one or more layers of a multi-layered system including a clear top coating composition, a colorant layer and/or a base coating composition, and/or a primer layer, including, for example, an electrodeposition primer and/or a primer-surfacer layer.<br>
[0108]	The present invention is also directed to substrates at least partially coated<br>
with a multi-layer composite coating wherein at least one coating layer is deposited from such a composition. In certain embodiments, for example, the powder coating composition of the present invention comprises the basecoat layer in a multi-layer composite coating comprising a basecoat and a topcoat.   As a result, in these embodiments, after application and curing of the powder coating composition of the present invention, at least one topcoat layer can be applied to the basecoat layer. The topcoat can, for example, be deposited from a powder coating composition, an organic solvent-based coating composition or a water-based coating composition; as is well known in the art. The film-forming composition of the topcoat can be any of the compositions useful in coatings applications, including, for example, a film-forming composition that comprises a resinous binder selected from acrylic polymers, polyesters, including alkyds, and polyurethanes. The topcoat composition can be applied by any conventional coating technique such as brushing, spraying, dipping or flowing, but they are most often applied by spraying. The usual spray techniques and equipment for air spraying, airless spray and electrostatic spraying in either manual or automatic methods can be used.<br>
[0109]	In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to reflective<br>
surfaces at least partially coated with a color-imparting non-hiding coating layer deposited from a powder coating composition comprising a plurality of polymer-enclosed panoparticles having a maximum haze of 10%. In certain embodiments, a clearcoat layer may be deposited over at least a portion of the color-imparting non-hiding coating layer.<br>
 [0110]	As used herein, the term "reflective surface" refers to a surface<br>
comprising a reflective material having a total reflectance of at least 30%, such as at least 40%. "Total reflectance" refers herein to the ratio of reflected light from an object relative to the incident light that impinges on the object in the visible spectrum integrating over all viewing angles. "Visible spectrum" refers herein to that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between wavelengths 400 and 700 nanometers. "Viewing angle" refers herein to the angle between the viewing ray and a normal to the surface at the point of incidence. The reflectance values described herein may be determined, for example, by using a Minolta Spectrophotometer CM-3600d according to the manufacturer supplied instructions.<br>
[0111]	In certain embodiments, the reflective surface comprises a substrate<br>
material such as, for example, polished aluminum, cold roll steel, chrome-plated metal,<br>
or vacuum deposited metal on plastic, among others. In other embodiments, the<br>
reflective surface may comprise a previously coated surface which may, for example,<br>
comprise a reflective coating layer deposited from a coating composition, such as, for<br>
example, a silver metallic basecoat layer, a colored metallic basecoat layer, a mica<br>
containing basecoat layer, or a white basecoat layer, among others.<br>
[0112]	Such reflective coating layers may be deposited from a film-forming<br>
composition that may, for example, include any of the film-forming resins typically used<br>
in protective coating compositions. For example, the film-forming composition of the<br>
reflective coating may comprise a resinous binder and one or roore pigments to act as the<br>
colorant. Useful resinous binders include, but are not limited to, acrylic polymers,<br>
polyesters, including alkyds and polyurethanes. The resinous binders for the reflective<br>
coating composition may, for example, be embodied in a powder coating composition,<br>
an organic solvent-based coating composition or a water-based coating composition.<br>
[0113]	As noted, the reflective coating composition can contain pigments as<br>
colorants. Suitable pigments for the reflective coating composition include, for example, metallic pigments, which include aluminum flake, copper or bronze flake and metal oxide coated mica; non-metallic color pigments, such as titanium dioxide, iron oxide, chromium oxide, lead chromate, and carbon black; as well as organic pigments, such as, for example, phthalocyanine blue and phthalocyanine green.<br>
 [0114]	The reflective coating composition can be applied to a substrate by any<br>
conventional coating technique such as brushing, spraying, dipping or flowing, among others. The usual spray techniques and equipment for air spraying, airless spraying and electrostatic spraying in either manual of automatic methods can be used. During application of the basecoat to the substrate, the film thickness of the basecoat formed on the substrate often ranges from 0.1 to 5 mils (2.5 to 127 micrometers), or 0.1 to 2 mils (25 lo 50.8 micrometers).<br>
[0115]	After forming a film of the reflective coating on the substrate, the<br>
reflective coating can be cured or alternatively given a drying step in which solvent is driven out of the basecoat film by heating or an air drying period before application of subsequent coating compositions. Suitable drying conditions will depend on the particular basecoat composition, and one the ambient humidity if the composition is water-borne, but often, a drying time of from 1 to 15 minutes at a temperature of 75° to 200°F (21 ° to 93°C) will be adequata<br>
[0116]	The reflective surfaces of the present invention are at least partially coated<br>
with a color-imparting non-hiding coating layer deposited from a powder coating composition of the present invention. AS used herein, the term "non-hiding coating layer" refers to a coating layer wherein, when deposited onto a surface, the surface beneath the coating layer is visible, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the surface beneath the non-hiding coating layer is visible when the non-hiding layer is applied at a dry film thickness of 0.5 to 5.0 mils (12.7 to 127 microns). One way to assess non-hiding is by measurement of opacity. As used herein, "opacity" refers to the degree to which a material obscures a substrate.<br>
[0117J	"Percent opacity" refers herein to the ratio of the reflectance of a dry<br>
coating film over a black substrate of 5% or less reflectance, to the reflectance of the same coating film, equivalently applied and dried, over a substrate of 85% reflectance. The percent opacity of a dry coating film will depend on the dry film thickness of the coating and the concentration of color-imparting particles. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the color-imparting non-hiding coating layer has a percent opacity of no more than 90 percent, such as no more than 50 percent, at a dry film thickness of one (1) mil (about 25 microns).<br>
 (0118]	In certain embodiments of the reflective surfaces of the present invention,<br>
a clearcoat layer is deposited over at least a portion of the color-imparting non-hiding coating layer. The clearcoat layer may be deposited from a composition that comprises any typically film-forming resin and can be applied over the color-imparting non-hiding layer to impart additional depth and/or protective properties to the surface underneath. The resinous binders for the clearcoat can be embodied as a powder coating composition, an organic solvent-based coating composition, or a water-based coating composition. Optional ingredients suitable for inclusion in the clearcoat composition include those which are well known in the art of formulating surface coatings, such as those materials described earlier. The clearcoat composition can be applied to a substrate by any conventional coating technique such as brushing, spraying, dipping or flowing, among others.<br>
[0119]	In certain embodiments, coatings deposited from a powder coating<br>
composition of the present invention exhibit a "richer" color as1 compared to a similar<br>
powder coating composition that does not include a plurality of polymer-enclosed<br>
nanoparticles having a maximum haze of 10%, such as those described above. As a<br>
result, the present invention is directed to methods for increasing the color richness of a<br>
coating deposited from a powder coating composition. These methods comprise<br>
including in the powder coating composition a. plurality of polymer-enclosed<br>
nanoparticles having a maximum haze of 10%. As used herein, the term "color richness"<br>
refers to the L* value in the CIELAB color system as described in United States Patent<br>
No. 5,792,559 at col, 1, lines 34 to 64, the cited portion of which being incorporated<br>
herein by reference, wherein a lower L* value corresponds to a higher level of color<br>
richness. For purposes of the present invention, color measurements at various angles<br>
can be made using an X-RITE spectrophotometer, such as an MA68I Multi-angle<br>
spectrophotometer, commercially available from X-Rite Instruments, Inc.<br>
[0120]	The present invention is also directed to methods for matching the color<br>
of a preselected protective and decorative coating deposited from a liquid coating composition. The inventors have discovered that, unlike prior art powder coating compositions, the powder coating compositions of the present invention are capable of producing coatings that exhibit color properties similar to coatings deposited from liquid coating compositions. As a result, the powder coating compositions of the present<br>
invention can be used for color matching of coatings deposited from liquid coating compositions. These methods comprise: (a) determining the visible color of the preselected coating by measuring the absorbance or reflectance of the preselected coating; and (b) making a powder coating composition comprising a plurality of polymer-enclosed nanoparticles having a maximum haze of 10%, wherein a coating deposited from the powder coating composition matches the visible color of the preselected coating. In these methods, the absorbance or reflectance of the preselected coating is determined using a spectrophotoraeter (as described above) and a curve of the absorbance or reflectance across the range of wavelengths corresponding to the visible spectrum is produced. This curve is referred to as the visible absorbance or reflectance spectrum. A powder coating composition is produced, which includes a plurality of polymer-enclosed nanoparticles having a maximum haze of 10%, such that the coating deposited from the powder coating composition has a visible absorbance or reflectance spectrum closely matching that of the preselected coating.<br>

[0140]	Components 1 to 9 were premixed in a Henschel Blender for 1 minute at<br>
1000 RPM. The mixture was then extruded through a Coperion W&amp;P 30mm co-rotating twin screw extruder at a 340 RPM screw speed and an average torque of 30-40%. The extruder was equipped with a low pressure injection system and five independently temperature controlled zones, as described in United States Published Patent Applications 2005/0213423; 2005/0212159A1; and 2005/0212171 Al. The five independently temperature controlled zones were controlled at the following temperatures: Zone 1: 60°C; Zone 2: 120'C; Zone 3: 130°C; Zone 4: 120"C; Zone 5: 100°C. The extrudate was cooled and ground in a mechanical milling system to a particle size of about 28 to 30 microns. Oversized panicles were removed and component 10 was added.<br>
EXAMPLE H<br>
Preparation of Powder Coating Compositions<br>
[0141 ]	Various powder coating compositions were prepared from the powder<br>
coating composition intermediate of Example 10 and the Polyurethane/Nanopigment Dispersions of Examples 2-4 and 7-9, as well as various mixtures of those dispersions (weight ratios ranging from 90:; 10 to 10:90), Each of the powder coating compositions were prepared using the Coperion W&amp;P 30mm co-rotating twin screw extruder and conditions described in Example 10 equipped with a low pressure injection system and five independently temperature controlled zones, as described in United States Published Patent Applications 2005/0213423; 2005/0212159A1; and 2005/0212171A1. The powder coating composition intermediate of Example 10 was fed to the extruder at a rate of 280 grams per minute and the pigments dispersions were fed to the extruder at a rate of 105 grams per minute through a low pressure injection system. Zone 4 was equipped with a devolatilization port for volatile vapor removal. The extrudate was cooled and ground in a mechanical milling system-to a particle size of about 28 to 30 microns.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Color Matching Method<br>
[0142]	This Example demonstrates the improved ability of the powder coating<br>
compositions of the present invention to match the color of a chromatic coating deposited from a liquid coating composition. Li this Example, a chromatic purple/magenta coating deposited from a liquid coating composition was the standard. The color data as measured by an MA68I Multi-angle spectrophotometer at various viewing angles is illustrated in Table 1. Powder coating A represented the best color match that could be achieved using a powder coating composition comprising only standard pigments. Powder coating B represents the best color match that could be achieved using a powder coating composition comprising a combination of the nanopigment dispersions of Examples 2-4 and 7-9.<br>
TABLE 1 <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0143]	In this Example, a positive trend in "C" Value is observed thus indicating a<br>
better color match with the standard at face angles (15 and 25), When measuring flop angles (45,75,110) negative trends indicate darker and more desirable chroma movements. In the case of the above sample, all three angles decreased in their values in regards to the original powder match thus moving closer to standard.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Polyurethane/Nanopigment Dispersion<br>
[0144]	This example describes the preparation of a nano-sized PR-179 perylcne<br>
red pigment dispersion. The dispersion was prepared from the following mixture of ingredients in the ratios indicated:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Commercially available from Suit Chemical<br><br>
[01451	The ingredients were mixed and recycled through an Advantis VIS Drajs<br>
mill containing 500 ml of 0.3 ram Zirconox YTZ® grinding media in a one liter grinding chamber. The mixture was milled at a maximum of 1350 rpm for a total lime of42.75 hours. The final product -was a red liquid with a nonvolatile content of 39.4% as measured at 110°C for one hour.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
[0146]	In this Example, two powder coating compositions were prepared using<br>
the ingredients and the method described in Example 10. For Example 14a, 3 pans by weight of PR 179 pigment, commercially available from Sun Chemical, was included in the composition of Example 10. For example, 14b, 3 parts by weight of the polyurethane/nanopigment dispersion was included in the composition of Example 10. The powder coating compositions of Examples 14a and 14b were electrostatically applied to 4" x 12" electrocoated panels. The panels were cured at an appropriate elevated temperature and cooled to ambient temperature. Color data was measured by an MA68I Multi-angle spectrophotometer at various viewing angles. The results are illustrated in Table I and are reported as the difference in the value:for Example 14b as compared to Example 14a.<br><br>
