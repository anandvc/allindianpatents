				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD: 5<br>
The present invention relates to  The Container is suitable for holding a beverage, but is not limited thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
According to French patent number 9513480 a champagne bottle has been modified to allow a musical device to be affixed to the'base of the bottle.<br>
The champagne bottle has a base which is recessed and the musical device is affixed to    the bottom of the bottle in the recessed area, so that it does not affect the stability of the<br>
bottle when it is placed on a flat surface.<br>
According to the French patent, the champagne bottle with the musical device affixed in the aforementioned manner, plays a pleasant tune when the bottle is lifted and tilted.<br>
The present invention provides an alternative type of container which allows it to be used as a percussive instrument.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>

It is preferred that the container further includes percussion means which is confined in the second chamber.<br>
It is preferred that the percussion means includes particulate matter confined to the second chamber and adapted to make a noise when the container is shaken.<br>
Preferably the container is a bottle.<br>
The container may be shaped like a maraca.<br>
The first chamber may be located above the second chamber.<br>
It is preferred that the first chamber and the second chamber together form an exterior surface of the container.<br>
It is preferred that the container includes a bulbous lower end, which lower end includes the first chamber and the second chamber.<br>
It is preferred that the first chamber occupies a major part of the lower end of the container.<br>
The container preferably includes a first part including the first chamber and a second part including the second chamber.<br>
It is preferred that the first part is removably connected to the second part.<br>
It is preferred that the second part comprises a base portion which acts as a support for the first part<br>
It is preferred that the first pan includes a connecting means.<br>
The connecting means is preferably provided on a base portion of the first part.<br>
According to one preferred form of the invention, the base portion is substantially flat. According to an alternative form of the invention, the base portion is substantially concave.<br>
According to one embodiment the base portion has a rim for supporting the first part when the first part is not connected to the second chamber.<br>
The second part preferably includes a coupling means which is adapted to couple to the connection means of the first part.<br>
According to one particularly preferred form of the invention, the connection means includes a downwardly directed protrusion which is adapted to connect with a female portion of the coupling means of the second part. According to this form of the invention, the first part is preferably adapted to be screwed onto the second part or vice versa.<br>
According to another particularly preferred form of the invention, the connection means includes a structure which is a snap fit with a complementary structure on the second part.<br>
The second chamber may be sealed.<br>
The paniculate matter preferably includes at least one of ball bearings, plastic beads and ceramic beads.<br>
The second part preferably includes an upper surface which is adapted to abut a lower surface of the first part.<br>
It is preferred that the second part is permanently affixed to the first part.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Figure 1 shows a front view of a bottle according to the present invention. Figure 2 shows an angled front view of a first part of the bottle shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 shows an angled top view of a second part of the bottle shown in Figure 1. Figure 4 shows a top view of the second part.<br>
Figure 5 shows a side view of the second part.<br>
Figure 6 shows a front view of the first part according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 7 shows a front view of the first part according to another embodiment. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
As shown in Figure 1 a bottle in accordance with the preferred embodiment is shaped like amaraca.<br>
The handle 11 of the bottle 10 flares upwardly and outwardly. A screw-on cap 12 may be fitted to the mouth of the bottle 10.<br>
The neck 11 of the bottle 10 extends upwardly from a generally round shaped mam chamber 14.<br>
The main chamber 14 has a base 15 as shown in Figure 2.<br>
A spigot 16 extends downwardly from the centre of this base 15 and is provided with an external thread 17.<br>
The spigot 16 is adapted to screw into a hole 18 with threaded internal peripheral walls adapted to permit the spigot 16 to be screwed there into.<br>
The percussion part 20 according to the present embodiment of the invention has a generally flat top surface 21 and has a generally bowl shaped outer peripheral surface with a slightly convex base 23.<br>
According to an alternative preferred form of the invention which is not illustrated in the drawings, the base 15 and the percussion part 20 carry complementary structures which provide for a snap fit between the parts 15 and 20.<br>
Percussion beads or ball bearings are adapted to be placed inside the hollow percussion part 20 and the percussion beads may be scaled off inside the percussion part 20 prior to attachment of the percussion part 20 to the spigot 16. Once the percussion part 20 is screwed onto the spigot 16 the two parts may be permanently connected together by suitably gluing the opposing-faces 14 and 21 of the main chamber 14 and the percussion part 20.<br>
As shown in Figure 7 and Figure 6 the size of the main chamber may vary, with the main chamber being larger in the bottle of Figure 7 compared to that of the bottle shown in Figure 6.<br>
It is intended that in use the bottle be rilled with a beverage or other substance and that once the substance has been removed the bottle can then be shaken like a maraca. It is also possible that the bottle can be used as a maraca prior to removal of the contents from it However it is preferred that the beverage is removed firstly to prevent accidental spillage of the beverage from within the container and secondly to ensure the best possible simulation of a maraca.<br>
Variations may be made to the above described embodiment without departing from the overall concept For example the percussion part of the bottle could be provided in the form of a specially shaped container which is merely stuck to the bottom of the bottle.<br>
Furthermore the percussion part could be in the form of a ring which is attached to the outside of the main chamber of the bottle. The ring could be in the form of a toroid or similar shaped structure which may be placed over the neck of the bottle.<br>
According to another variation of the present invention the bottle could be made with two chambers formed therein and a small hole to the chamber housing the percussion beads to enable the percussion beads to be placed therein.<br>
Once the percussion beads are inside the percussion bead chamber, the small opening could then be sealed.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the invention which is not shown in the drawings, the cap 12 includes a teat for excretion of contents from the container.<br>
