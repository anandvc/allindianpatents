				<td>The present invention concerns a multimodal polyethylene composition<br>
comprising a low molecular weight fraction, a high molecular weight<br>
fraction and an ultrahigh molecular weight fraction, with improved<br>
homogeneity. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for the<br>
production of such a composition as well as to the. use of such, a<br>
composition for the production of a pipe, for moulding applications, and<br>
wire and cable applications.<br>
Multimodal polyethylene compositions are frequently used e.g. for the<br>
production of pipes due to their favourable physical and chemical<br>
properties as e.g. mechanical strength, corrosion resistance and long-term<br>
stability. When considering that the fluids, such as water or natural gas,<br>
transported in a pipe often are pressurized and have varying temperatures,<br>
usually within a range of 0°C to 50°C, it is obvious that the polyethylene<br>
composition used for pipes must meet demanding requirements.<br>
For multimodal polymers comprising more than one polymer fraction with<br>
different molecular weight, homogeneity is known to be a critical property,<br>
because low degrees of homogeneity adversely affect e.g. the surface<br>
properties and other properties of the polymer composition. For obtaining a<br>
sufficient degree of homogeneity, mixing of the different fractions the<br>
composition is consisting of must be reached down to the microscopic<br>
scale.<br>
It is furthermore known that in the production of multimodal polymers, in<br>
particular when produced in a multistage process, advantageously a<br>
polymerisation catalyst is used which has been submitted to a<br><br>
prepolymerisation step. In such a prepolymerisation usually a small<br>
quantity of polymer is produced. However, by prepolymerisation, a further<br>
polymer fraction is introduced into the polymer composition which renders<br>
the achievement of homogeneity even more difficult.<br>
When compounding multimodal polymer compositions e.g. for the<br>
production of pipes, so-called "white spots" occur in the compounded<br>
material. These white spots usually have a size of below 10 to about 50<br>
micrometer and consist of high molecular weight polymer particles that<br>
have not been adequately compounded in the composition. Further, when<br>
compounding polymer compositions e.g. for the production of films, gel<br>
particles with a size of about 0.01 to 1 mm often occur. These gel particles<br>
also consist of high molecular weight polymer particles not adequately<br>
compounded and appear as disfiguring inhomogeneities in the finished<br>
film. Still further, inhomogeneities in multimodal polymer compositions<br>
may also cause waviness of the surface of articles produced thereof.<br>
As a measure for the homogeneity in multimodal resins the ISO 18553 test<br>
can be applied. ISO 18553 originally is a method for rating pigmented<br>
spots, i.e. serves to determine how well pigments are dispersed in a<br>
polymer. As the dispersion of the pigment is dependent on the overall<br>
homogeneity of the polymer because inhomogeneities of the polymer are<br>
not coloured by the pigment, ISO 18553 can also be used as a measure for<br>
the homogeneity of a polymer by counting the non-coloured white spots<br>
and rating them according to the ISO 18553 scheme.<br>
As a further measure for the homogeneity of a polymer, the white spot area<br>
test has been developed which to a far extent is based on the modified ISO<br>
18553 white spot rating test as described in the above paragraph. This test<br>
is described in detail below.<br><br>
It is known that homogeneity of a multimodal polymer composition can be<br>
improved by applying multiple compounding steps and/or particular<br>
compounding conditions to the resin coming from the reactor. These<br>
measures, however, have the disadvantage that they are associated with a<br>
significant increase in production costs for the composition.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a multimodal<br>
polyethylene composition, comprising inter alia an ultrahigh molecular<br>
weight fraction, with improved homogeneity and thus improved properties,<br>
in particular surface properties. In particular, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide such a multimodal polyethylene composition having<br>
improved homogeneity directly after its production. At the same time, the<br>
composition should have good processing and good mechanical properties<br>
The present invention provides in a first embodiment a polyethylene<br>
composition comprising a base resin comprising three ethylene homo- or<br>
copolymer fractions (A), (B) and (C) with different weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw, wherein<br>
a)	fraction (A) has an MFR21 equal or lower than 20 g/10min,<br>
b)	fraction (B) has a lower weight average molecular weight than<br>
fraction (C),<br>
c)	fraction (C) has a lower weight average molecular weight than<br>
fraction (A),<br>
d)	the composition has a viscosity at a shear stress of 747 Pa<br>
(eta747) of 350 kPas or higher, and<br>
e)	the composition has a MFR5 of 0.15 g/10min or higher, and a<br>
white spot area of 1 % or below.<br><br>
The present invention furthermore provides in a second a polyethylene<br>
composition comprising a base resin comprising three ethylene homo- or<br>
copolymer fractions (A), (B) and (C) with different weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw, wherein<br>
a)	fraction (A) has an MFR21 equal or lower than 20 g/10min,<br>
b)	fraction (B) has a lower weight average molecular weight than<br>
fraction (C),<br>
c)	fraction (C) has a lower weight average molecular weight than<br>
fraction (A),<br>
d)	the composition has a viscosity at a shear stress of 747 Pa<br>
(eta747) of 350 kPas or higher, and<br>
e)	the composition has a MFR5 of 0.15 g/10min or higher and a<br>
rating in the ISO 18553 white spot rating test of below 4.5.<br>
The polyethylene compositions according to the invention have an<br>
improved microscopic mixing directly after its production, which is<br>
demonstrated by the fact that already after a single, usual compounding<br>
step a resin with an excellent homogeneity is obtained. Thus, the<br>
composition combines good mechanical with good surface properties and<br>
hence e.g. an improved impact strength with an improved appearance of the<br>
final product.<br>
The term "base resin" means the entirety of polymeric components in the<br>
polyethylene composition according to the invention, usually making up at<br>
least 90 wt% of the total composition. Preferably, the base resin in its<br>
entirety is consisting of fractions (A), (B) and (C).<br>
In addition to the base resin, usual additives for utilization with<br>
polyolefms, such as pigments (for example carbon black), stabilizers<br><br>
(antioxidant agents), antacids and/or anti-UVs, antistatic agents and<br>
utilization agents (such as processing aid agents) may be present in the<br>
polyethylene composition. Preferably, the amount of these additives is 10<br>
wt% or below, further preferred 8 wt% or below, of the total composition.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises carbon black in an amount of 8 wt%<br>
or below, further preferred of 1 to 4 wt%, of the total composition.<br>
Further preferred, the amount of additives different from carbon black is 1<br>
wt% or less, more preferably 0.5 wt% or less.<br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights for the<br>
fractions, is referred to as "multimodal". The prefix "multi" relates to the<br>
number of different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of.<br>
Thus, for example, if the composition according to the present invention<br>
consists of the three fractions (A), (B) and (C) is it usually referred to as<br>
"trimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the<br>
individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process,<br>
utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each<br>
reactor, the polymer fractions produced in the different reactors will each<br>
have their own molecular weight distribution and weight average molecular<br>
weight. When the molecular weight distribution curve of such a polymer is<br><br>
recorded, the individual curves from these fractions are superimposed into<br>
the molecular weight distribution curve for the total resulting polymer<br>
product, usually yielding a curve with two or more distinct maxima.<br>
In the first embodiment of the composition according to the invention, the<br>
composition preferably has a rating in the ISO 18553 white spot rating test<br>
of below 4.5.<br>
The following preferred embodiments pertain to both the first and the<br>

Still further, the base resin preferably has an MFR21 of 1 to 50 g/10min.<br>
The FRR21/5 of the base resin preferably is from 10 to 100, and more<br>
preferably is from 15 to 70.<br>
The density of the base resin is preferably 915 kg/m3 or more, more<br>
preferably 930 kg/m or more. Further, the density of the base resin is<br>
preferably 970 kg/m or less.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the base resin preferably is from<br>
100,000 to 1,000,000 g/mol, and more preferably from 200,000 to 800,000<br>
g/mol.<br>
Usually, the composition according to the invention, measured after a<br>
single compounding step as defined below, has a white spot area of 0.01 to<br><br>

compounding step, has a white spot area of 0.7 % or below, usually of 0.01<br>
to 0.7 %.<br>
Furthermore, the polyethylene composition, measured after a single<br>
compounding step as defined below, preferably has a rating.in the ISO<br>
18553 white spot rating test of below 4, more preferred of below 3. Usually<br>
then, the composition, after said single compounding step, has a rating in<br>
the ISO 18553 white spot test of preferably 0.01 to below 4, more<br>
preferably of 0.01 to below 3.<br>
Preferably, fraction (A) is present in. the base resin in an amount of from<br>
0.5 to 15 wt%, more preferred in an amount of from 0.5 to 10 wt% and still<br>
more preferred in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 wt%.<br>

Fraction (B) preferably has a density of 915 kg/m3 or more, more preferably<br>
of 940 kg/m3 or more. Further, fraction (B) preferably has a density of 980<br>
kg/m or less.<br>

Further preferred, fraction (C) of the polyethylene composition is a<br>
copolymer of ethylene with one or more alpha-olefin comonomers.<br>
Preferably, the alpha-olefin comonomer of fraction (C) is having from 4 to<br>
8 carbon atoms, and more preferably is selected from 1-butene, 1-hexene,<br>

The SHI is the ratio of the viscosity of the polyethylene composition at<br>
different shear stresses. In the present invention, the shear stresses at 2.7<br>
kPa and 210 kPa are used for calculating the SHI2.7/210 which may serve as a<br>
measure of the broadness of the molecular weight distribution.<br>
Furthermore, the polyethylene composition preferably has a viscosity at a<br>
shear stress of 2.7 kPa (eta(2.7)) of 10 to 500 kPas, more preferably 20 to<br>
450 kPas and most preferably 40 to 400 kPas.<br>
The polyethylene composition according to the invention preferably has a<br>
value for the viscosity at a shear stress of 747 Pa (eta747) of 550 kPas or<br>
higher, more preferably of 600 kPas or higher.<br>
Where herein preferred features of fractions (A), (B) and (C) of the<br>
composition of the present invention are given, these values are generally<br>
valid for the cases in which they can be directly measured on the respective<br><br>
fraction, e.g. when the fraction is separately produced or produced in the<br>
first stage of a multistage process.<br>
However, the base resin may also be and preferably is produced in a<br>
multistage process wherein e.g. fractions (A), (B) and (C) are produced in<br>
subsequent stages. In such a case, the properties of the fractions produced<br>
in the second and third step (or further steps) of the multistage process can<br>
either be inferred from polymers, which are separately produced in a single<br>
stage by applying identical polymerisation conditions (e.g. identical<br>
temperature, partial pressures of the reactants/diluents, suspension medium,<br>
reaction time) with regard to the stage of the multistage process in which<br>
the fraction is produced, and by using a catalyst on which no previously<br>
produced polymer is present. Alternatively, the properties of the fractions<br>
produced in a higher stage of the multistage process may also be calculated,<br>
e.g. in accordance with B. Hagstrom, Conference on Polymer Processing<br>
(The Polymer Processing Society), Extended Abstracts and Final<br>
Programme, Gothenburg, August 19 to 21, 1997, 4:13.<br>
Thus, although not directly measurable on the multistage process products,<br>
the properties of the fractions produced in higher stages of such a<br>
multistage process can be determined by applying either or both of the<br>
above methods. The skilled person will be able to select the appropriate<br>
method.<br>
Fraction (A) preferably has a weight average molecular weight of from<br>
600,000 g/mol to 5,000,000 g/mol, more preferably from 600,000 to<br>
2,000,000 g/mol.<br>
Fraction (A) preferably has an MFR21 of 10 g/10min or below, more<br>
preferably of 5 or below.<br><br>
Fraction (B) preferably has a weight average molecular weight of from<br>
2,000 g/mol to 50,000 g/mol, more preferably from 5,000 to 30,000 g/mol.<br>
Fraction (B) of the polyethylene composition preferably has an MFR2 of 10<br>
g/10 min or more, more preferably of 80 g/10min or more.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of fraction (C) is preferably from<br>
30,000 to 600,000 g/mol, more preferably from 50,000 to 500,000 g/mol.<br>
In the production of the base resin Ziegler-Natta (ZN) or metallocene<br>
catalysts are preferably used, more preferably Ziegler-Natta catalysts.<br>
The catalyst may be supported, e.g. with conventional supports including<br>
silica, Al-containing supports and magnesium dichloride based supports.<br>
Preferably the catalyst is a ZN catalyst, more preferably the catalyst is non-<br>
silica supported ZN catalyst, and most preferably MgCl2-based ZN catalyst.<br>
The Ziegler-Natta catalyst further preferably comprises a group 4 (group<br>
numbering according to new IUPAC system) metal compound, preferably<br>
titanium, magnesium dichloride and aluminium.<br>
The catalyst may be commercially available or be produced in accordance<br>
or analogously to the literature. For the preparation of the preferable<br>
catalyst usable in the invention reference is made to WO2004055068 and<br>
WO2004055069 of Borealis and EP0 810 235. The content of these<br>
documents in its entirety is incorporated herein by reference, in particular<br>
concerning the general and all preferred embodiments of the catalysts<br>
described therein as well as the methods for the production of the catalysts.<br>
Particularly preferred Ziegler-Natta catalysts are described in EP 0 810<br>
235.<br><br>
The base resin of the polyethylene composition according the invention<br>
preferably is produced so that at least one of fractions (B) and (C),<br>
preferably (C), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br>
With regard to the production process of the polyethylene composition<br>
according to the invention, it is preferred that one of the fractions (B) and<br>
(C) of the base resin, preferably fraction (B), is produced in a slurry<br>
reaction, preferably in a loop reactor.<br>
Furthermore, the polyethylene base resin preferably is produced in a<br>
multistage process. Polymer compositions produced in such a process are<br>
also designated as "in-situ"-blends.<br>
A multistage process is defined to be a polymerisation process in which a<br>
polymer comprising two or more fractions is produced by producing each,<br>
or at least two, polymer fraction(s) in a separate reaction stage, usually<br>
with different reaction conditions in each stage, in the presence of the<br>
reaction product of the previous stage which comprises a polymerisation<br>
catalyst.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that fractions (A), (B) and (C) of the<br>
polyethylene composition are produced in different stages of a multistage<br>
process.<br>
Preferably, the multistage process comprises at least one gas phase stage in<br>
which, preferably, fraction (C) is produced.<br>
Further preferred, fraction (C) is produced in a subsequent stage in the<br>
presence of fraction (B) which has been produced in a previous stage.<br>
It is previously known to produce multimodal olefin polymers, such as<br>
multimodal polyethylene, in a multistage process comprising two or more<br><br>
reactors connected in series. As instance of this prior art, mention may be<br>
made of EP 517 868, which is hereby incorporated by way of reference in<br>
its entirety, including all its preferred embodiments as described therein, as<br>
a preferred multistage process for the production of the base resin of<br>
polyethylene composition according to the invention.<br>
Preferably, the main polymerisation stages of the multistage process are<br>
such as described in EP 517 868, i.e. the production of fractions (B) and<br>
(C) is carried out as a combination of slurry polymerisation for fraction<br>
(B)/gas-phase polymerisation for fraction (C). The slurry polymerisation is<br>
preferably performed in a so-called loop reactor. Further preferred, the<br>
slurry polymerisation stage precedes the gas phase stage.<br>
Preferably, the main polymerisation stages, i.e. the production of fractions<br>
(B) and (C) are preceded by the production of fraction (A) in a first stage.<br>
Fraction (A) is preferably an ethylene homopolymer. At this first<br>
polymerisation stage which may be designated as prepolymerisation,<br>
preferably all of the catalyst is charged into a loop reactor and the<br>
polymerisation is preferably performed as a slurry polymerisation.<br>
The resulting end product consists of an intimate, mixture of the polymers<br>
from the different polymerisation stage. The different molecular-weight-<br>
distribution curves of these polymers together form a molecular-weight-<br>
distribution curve having a broad maximum or several maxima, i.e. the end<br>
product is a multimodal polymer mixture.<br>
It is preferred that the multimodal base resin of the polyethylene<br>
composition according to the invention is a trimodal polyethylene mixture<br>
consisting of fractions (B) and (C), and fraction (A). It is also preferred that<br>
this trimodal polymer mixture has been produced by polymerisation as<br><br>
described above under different polymerisation conditions in two or more<br>
polymerisation reactors connected in series. Owing to the flexibility with<br>
respect to reaction conditions thus obtained, it is most preferred that the<br>
polymerisation is carried out in a loop reactor/a gas-phase reactor<br>
combination.<br>
Preferably, the polymerisation conditions in the preferred multistage<br>
method are so chosen that the comparatively low-molecular weight polymer<br>
(B), preferably having no content of comonomer, is produced in one stage,<br>
preferably the first stage after prepolymerisation of fraction (A), owing to a<br>
high content of chain-transfer agent (hydrogen gas), whereas the high-<br>
molecular weight polymer (C), preferably having a content of comonomer,<br>
is produced in another stage, preferably the second stage. This preferred<br>
order of stages may, however, be reversed.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the polymerisation, the temperature in the<br>
loop reactor where preferably fraction (B) is produced is preferably is 85 to<br>
115 °C, preferably 90 to 105 °C and most preferably 92 to 98 °C.<br>
Preferably, the temperature in the gas-phase reactor, where preferably<br>
fraction (C) is produced, is 70 to 105 °C, more preferably is 75 to 100 °C,<br>
and most preferably is 82 to 97 °C.<br>
A chain-transfer agent, preferably hydrogen, is added as required to the<br>
reactors, and preferably 100 to 800 moles of H2/kmoles of ethylene are<br>
added to the reactor, when the LMW fraction is produced in this reactor,<br>
and 0 to 50 moles of H2/kmoles of ethylene are added to the gas phase<br>
reactor when this reactor is producing the HMW fraction.<br><br>
Preferably, the base resin of the polyethylene composition is produced with<br>
a rate of at least 5 tons/h, more preferably at least 10 ton/h, and most<br>
preferably at least 15 tons/h.<br>
The composition of the invention preferably if produced in a process<br>
comprising compounding step, wherein the composition of the base resin,<br>
i.e. the blend, which is typically obtained as a base resin powder from the<br>
reactor, is extruded in an extruder and then pelletised to polymer pellets in<br>
a manner known in the art.<br>
Optionally, additives or other polymer components can be added to the<br>
composition during the compounding step in the amount as described<br>
above. Preferably, the composition of the invention obtained from the<br>
reactor is compounded in the extruder together with additives in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br>
The extruder may be e.g. any conventionally used extruder. . As an<br>
example of an extruder for the present compounding step may be those as<br>
supplied by Japan steel works, Kobe steel or Farrel-Pomini, e.g. JSW 460P.<br>
In one embodiment, the extrusion step is carried out using production rates<br>
of at least 400, at least 500, at least 1000 kg/h may be used in said<br>
compounding step.<br>
In another embodiment the compounding step can be effected with<br>
production rate of that least 5 tons/h, preferably at least 15 tons/h, more<br>
preferably at least 20 or 25 tons/h or even at least 30 or more tons/h, such<br>
as at least 50, such 1-50, preferably 5-40, 10-50, in some embodiments 10-<br>
25 tons/h.<br><br>
Alternatively, production rates at least 20 tons/h, preferably at least 25<br>
tons/h, even at least 30 tons/h, e.g. 25-40 tons/h may be desired during the<br>
compounding step.<br>
The present multimodal polyethylene composition of the invention enables<br>
such production rates within the property window of the invention, i.e. with<br>
various property combinations of MFR's of the fractions and of final base<br>
resin variations together with excellent homogeneity, just to mention few.<br>
Preferably, in said extrusion step, a total SEI (specific energy input) of the<br>
extruder may be at least 150, 150-400, 200-350, 200-300 kWh/ton.<br>
It is known that the temperature of the polymer melt may vary in the<br>
extruder, the highest (max) melt temperature of the composition in the<br>
extruder during the extrusion step is typically more than 150°C, suitably<br>
between 200 to 350°C, preferably 250 to 310°C, more pref. 250 to 300°C.<br>
The benefit of the invention is that an excellent homogeneity can be<br>
obtained without extensive mixing, already by effecting once the<br>
compounding step, e.g. the preferable extrusion with production rates as<br>
defined above, and additionally, together with the high level homogeneity<br>
desirable polymer properties can be achieved/maintained.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to an article, such as a pipe, an<br>
injection moulded article, a wire or cable, or a high density film,<br>
comprising a polyethylene composition as described above, and to the use<br>
of such a polyethylene composition for the production of such an article.<br>
Experimental and Examples<br>
1. Definitions and measurement methods<br><br>
a)	Molecular weight<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a<br>
method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A waters 150CV plus instrument was<br>
used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and<br>
trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was<br>
calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the<br>
Mark Howings constant K: 9.54*10-5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92*10-4<br>
and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the broadness<br>
of the distribution, since each is influenced by the opposite end of the<br>
"population".<br>
b)	Density<br>
Density is measured according to ISO 1872, Annex A.<br>
c)	Melt Flow Rate/Flow Rate Ratio<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the<br>
lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190°C and<br>
may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (ISO 1133<br>
condition D - "MFR2"), 5 kg (ISO 1133 condition T - "MFR5") or 21.6 kg<br>
(ISO 1133 condition G - "MFR21").<br>
The quantity FRR (flow rate ratio) is an indication of molecular weight<br>
distribution and denotes the ratio of flow rates at different loadings. Thus,<br>
FRR21/5 denotes the value of MFR21/MFR5.<br><br>
d)	Rheological Parameters<br>
Rheological parameters such as Shear Thinning Index SHI and Viscosity<br>
are determined by using a rheometer, preferably a Rheometrics Phisica<br>
MCR 300 Rheometer. The definition and measurement conditions are<br>
described in detail on page 8 line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br>
e)	Measurement of Homogeneity - White spot area test<br>
The polymer composition according to the present invention has an<br>
improved homogeneity directly after its production in the polymerisation<br>
reactor. However, as, first, homogeneity is usually measured only on a<br>
compounded composition, and, second, the way in which compounding is<br>
carried out has a decisive influence on the homogeneity of the compounded<br>
composition, it is important that the compounding conditions to which the<br>
composition is subjected and the compounding equipment used are/is<br>
clearly defined before homogeneity of the composition is determined, e.g.<br>
in terms of the white spot area test or the modified ISO 18553 white spot<br>
rating test as described below.<br>
Accordingly, homogeneity of the compositions described herein is<br>
determined after a single compounding step only, which is to be carried out<br>
as follows:<br>
The base resin powder coming from the reactor is transferred, e.g. via<br>
intermediate holding tanks (50-250 tons), to the compounding unit without<br>
extra handling like grinding or cooling or similar processes.<br>
The powder is then poured into the inlet of the compounder together with<br>
the appropriate amounts of additives. The additives can be, typically,<br>
stearates, antioxidants, UV-stabilisers, or pigments/carbon blacks. The<br><br>
additives can be added as a pure component or as a master batch with a PE<br>
carrier.<br>
The base resin plus additives are then passed through the compounding unit<br>
only once.<br>
No material that has passed the compounder once is allowed to be<br>
transferred back to the inlet of the compounder for further work nor is it<br>
allowed to pass the compounded material further to a second processing<br>
unit.<br>
The idea of the single compounding step is that a reactor powder is allowed<br>
only one single pass through the compounding unit.<br>
The equipment to be used for the single compounding step is a twin-screw<br>
extruder like counter rotating equipment as supplied by Japan steel works,<br>
e.g. CIM JSW 460P or equivalent equipment.<br>
Typical compounding conditions in the single compounding step used in<br>
CIM JSW 460P having a screw diameter of 460 mm are:<br>
production: 25 to 30 tons/h<br>
mixer specific energy input (SEI): 260 kWh/ton<br>
gear pump SEI: 19 kWh/ton<br>
Temp, before gear pump:	290 °C<br>
Temp, after gear pump:	300 °C<br>
suction pressure gear pump: 1.6 bar<br>
mixer speed:	400 rpm<br><br>
The white spot area of the once compounded composition is determined at<br>
least partly following ISO 18553, as follows:<br>
A sample of a composition (including a pigment to make the<br>
inhomogeneities visible, e.g. carbon black in an amount of around 2.5 wt%)<br>
which is obtained after a single compounding step as described above, is<br>
analysed by first obtaining 6 microtome cuts of 6 different parts of the<br>
sample (thickness 
The cuts are evaluated at a magnification of 100, and the size, i.e. the part<br>
of the surface, of the non-coloured inclusions ("white spots", agglomerates,<br>
particles) on a total surface of each cut of 0.7 mm2 is determined. All white<br>
spots with a diameter &gt; 5 microns are counted. The "white spot area" is<br>
then expressed as the averaged fraction of the white spots on the total<br>
surface of the sample cut.<br>
f) Measurement of homogeneity - Rating in modified ISO 18553 white<br>
spot rating test<br>
In addition to the white spot area test, homogeneity complementary is<br>
determined according to the modified ISO 18553 white spot rating test. In<br>
this test, inhomogeneities of the composition present after a single<br>
compounding step as described above, which appear as white spots, are<br>
determined and rated according to the rating scheme given in ISO 18553.<br>
The lower the composition is rated in this test, the better is the<br>
homogeneity of the composition.<br>
2. Polyethylene compositions<br>
Production of polyetlrylene compositions base resins was performed in a<br>
multistage reaction comprising a first polymerisation stage in slurry in a<br><br>
50 dm3 loop reactor (fraction (A)), followed by transferring the slurry to a<br>
500 dm3 loop reactor wherein polymerisation was continued in slurry to<br>
produce the low molecular weight component (fraction (B)), and a second<br>
polymerisation in a gas phase reactor in the presence of the product from<br>
the second loop reactor to produce the comonomer containing high<br>
molecular weight component (fraction (C)). As comonomer, butene-1 has<br>
been used.<br>
As a catalyst, Lynx 200 available from Engelhard Corporation Pasadena,<br>
U.S.A. has been used for Example 1.<br>
In comparative example 1, a catalyst prepared according to example 1 of<br>
EP 0 688 794 has been used.<br>
The polymerisation conditions applied and the properties of the polymers<br>
obtained are listed in Table 1.<br>
After production of fraction (C) (and hence the complete base resin), the<br>
obtained polymer powder was transferred to an extruder where it was<br>
compounded together with 2.5 wt% carbon black according to the<br>
procedure described under item e) above.<br><br><br><br>
