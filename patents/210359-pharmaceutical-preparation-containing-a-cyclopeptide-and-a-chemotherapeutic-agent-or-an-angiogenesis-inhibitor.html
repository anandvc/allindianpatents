Pharmaceutical preparation<br>
The invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical preparation comprising cyclo.(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and at least one chemotherapeutic agent and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and/or an angiogenesis inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salt4s.<br>
This novel preparation can be used to control pathologically angiogenic disorders, thromboses, .myocardial infarct, coronary heart disease, arteriosclerosis, tumours, osteoporosis, inflammations and infections.<br>
The invention was based on the object of providing novel medicinal products in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which have better properties than known medicinal products used for the same purposes.<br>
This object has been achieved by the finding of the novel preparation.<br>
CyclO)(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) is disclosed in EP 0 770 622 and acts" in particular as integrin inhibitor, in particular inhibiting the interactions of the Cty, 33 or p5 integrin receptors with ligands, such as, for example, the binding of fibrinogen to the 0^3 integrin receptor. The compound shows particular activity in the case of the integrins Ovp3, civps, ctiibp3 and Ctvpi, Ovp6 and ccvp8.<br>
This effect can be detected, for example, by the method described by J.W. Smith et al- in J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12267-12271 (1990).<br>
The present invention is to be regarded as a selection invention in relation to EP 0 770 622.<br><br>

WO 98/14192 mentions pharmaceutical products which comprise combinations of non-peptide vitronectin receptor antagonists with chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of an antiangiogenesis therapy combined with a chemotherapy is described by J. Folkman in Nature Medicine 1, 27-30 (1995).<br>
The efficacy of cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val)¦ in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent can be shown in Lewis lung carcinoma system. The Lewis lung carcinoma is only inadequately .influenced by conventional chemotherapeutic agents (Y. Kakeji and B.A. Teicher, Invest. New Drugs 15: 39-48 (1997)). The method for delaying tumour growth is carried out in analogy to Kakeji {F. Mitjans et al., J. Cell Sci. 108: 2825-2838 (1995)) .<br>
The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical preparation comprising cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and at least one chemotherapeutic agent and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts.<br>

Preferred angiogenesis inhibitors are described, for example, in Table 1 in WO 9741844.<br>
Particular preference is given to cXvp3 and c^ps integrin inhibitors, for example the compounds mentioned in EP 0 770 622.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical preparation can be produced by converting cyclo{Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val)  and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and at least one   chemotherapeutic  agent   and/or   one   of   its physiologically acceptable salts and/or an angiogenesis inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts, into a suitable daily dosage form together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or ancillary substance. The preparations obtained in this way can be employed as medicinal products in human or veterinary medicine, in particular for the treatment of tumours.  Suitable carrier substances are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable for enteral (for example oral, sublingual or rectal), parenteral or topical (for example transdermal) administration and do not  react  with  the  compounds,  for  example  water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, glycerol  acetate  and  other  fatty  acid  glycerides, gelatin, soya lecithin, carbohydrates such as lactose or  starch,  magnesium  stearate,   talc,   cellulose. Particularly used for oral administration are tablets, coated tablets, capsules, syrups, suspensions or drops, for  rectal  administration  are  suppositories,   for parenteral  administration  are  solutions,  preferably oily or aqueous solutions, also suspensions, emulsions or  irnplants,  and  fox  topical  administration  are<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
ointments, creams or plasters. The active ingredients can also be lyophilized and the resulting lyophilizates be used, for example, for producing injectable products. The preparations can be sterilized and/or contain ancillary substances such as preservatives, stabilizers and/or wetting agents, emulsif iers," salts to influence the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colours and/or flavours. They may also comprise further active ingredients, for example other substances which lower blood pressure or have a diuretic effect, but also vitamins and/or mineral salts, in particular those which favour metabolic processes.<br>
The preparations according to the invention are used to control pathologically angiogenic disorders, thromboses, myocardial infarct, coronary heart disease, arteriosclerosis, tumours, osteoporosis, inflammations and infections. As a rule, they are employed for controlling tumours, that is to say to inhibit tumour growth or tumour metastases.<br>
It is possible to use cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) in  combination  products  employed  for  controlling diseases in which Otv integrins, especially 0^3 and 0^5, are involved and inhibition thereof forms part of the therapy.  In the case of non-oncological disorders, cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) is used in combination with a therapeutic agent typical for this disorder. The pathologies include thrombosis, myocardial infarct, arteriosclerosis,    inflammations,    stroke,    angina pectoris,   oncoses,   osteolytic  diseases   such  as osteoporosis, pathologically angiogenic diseases such as,   for  example,   inflammations,   ophthalmological diseases, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, myopia,  ocular histoplasmosis,  rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rubeotic glaucoma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, restenosis after   angioplasty,   viral   infection,   bacterial<br><br>

b)	on radiotherapy,<br>
c)	on photodynamic therapy,<br>
d)	together with monoclonal antibodies against tumour-<br>
selective epitopes,<br>
e)	together with fusion proteins,<br>
f)	together with peptide vaccines and<br>
g)	on gene therapy.<br>
The doses of cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val)  or its salts and of the chemotherapeutic agents and/or the angiogenesis inhibitors are preferably between about 0.1 and 100 mg\ in particular between 0.2 and 20 mg, very especially between 0.1 and 10 mg per dose unit. The daily dose is preferably between about 0.001 and 1, in particular between 0.002  and 0.2 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
During chemotherapy, the peptide can be given, for example, also in a dose of 1-10 mg/kg 2x a week. The chemotherapeutic agents can be administered, for example, also in a dose of 1-10 mg/kg once a week to every 3-4 weeks. However, the specific dose^ for each patient depends on a wide variety of factors, for example on the efficacy of the specific compound employed, on the age, body weight, general state of health, ¦ sex, on the diet, on the time and route of administration, on the excretion rate, drug combination and severity of the particular disorder for which the therapy is applied. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of the described pharmaceutical preparations for the production  of  a medicinal  product  for  controlling<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
pathologically angiogenic disorders, thromboses, myocaVdial infarct, coronary heart disease, arteriosclerosis, tumours, osteoporosis, inflammations and infections.<br>
The  invention v further  relates  to  the  use  of  the described pharmaceutical preparations for controlling pathologically   angiogenic   disorders,    thromboses, myocardial    infarct,    coronary    heart    disease, arteriosclerosis,  tumours, osteoporosis,  inflammations and infections.<br>
The invention particularly relates to the use of cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts consecutively or in physical combination with a chemotherapeutic agent and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and/or an angiogenesis inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts for producing a medicinal product for controlling tumours.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts consecutively or in physical combination with a chemotherapeutic agent and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts for producing a medicinal product for controlling tumours.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts consecutively or in physical combination with a chemotherapeutic agent and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts for controlling tumours.<br>
The ingredients of the novel pharmaceutical preparation are preferably administered in combination. However, they can also be administered singly, simultaneously or consecutively.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
The invention also relates  to a kit  consisting of separate packs of<br>
(a)	an effective amount  of  cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-<br>
NMe-Val) and<br>
(b)	an effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent.<br>
The kit comprises suitable containers such as boxes, individual bottles, bags or ampoules. The kit may, for example, comprise separate ampoules in each of which there is an effective amount of cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val) and of the chemotherapeutic agent in dissolved or lyophylized [sic] form.<br>
WO 9814192 discloses various biological tests suitable for determining the concentration of the compounds having a pharmacological effect.<br>
Cyclo{Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val), the therapeutic agent or the angiogenesis inhibitor can if an .acidic functionality is present be converted with a base into the relevant acid addition salt, for example by reacting the equivalent amounts of the acid and of the base in an inert solvent such as ethanol and then evaporating.<br>
Bases particularly suitable for this reaction are those which provide physiologically acceptable salts. Thus, an acid can be converted with a base (for example sodium or potassium hydroxide or carbonate) into the corresponding metal, in particular alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, also into the corresponding amount of ammonium salt.<br>
On the other hand, a basic functionality can be converted into the relevant acid addition salt, for example by reacting equivalent amounts of the base and of the acid in an inert solvent such as ethanol and then evaporating. Particularly suitable acids for this reaction  are  those  which  provide  physiologically<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
acceptable salts. Thus, it is possible to use inorganic acids1,   for  example  sulfuric  aeid,   nitric  acid, hydrohalic  acids  such  as  hydrochloric  acid  or hydrobromic   acid,   phosphoric   acids   such   as orthophosphoric  acid,  sulfamic  acid,  also  organic acids, in particular aliphatic, alicyclic, araliphatic or aromatic  or  heterocyclic monobasic  or polybasic carboxylic,  sulfonic or sulfuric acids,  for example formic¦acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic  acid,  malonic  acid,   succinic  acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic  acid,  nicotinic  acid,  isonicotinic  acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, ettianedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic  acid,  benzenesulfonic  acid, p-toluenesulfonic   acid,   naphthalene   mono-   and disulfonic  acids,  laurylsulfuric  acid.  Salts  with physiologically   unacceptable . salts,   for   example picrates,  can be used to isolate and/or purify the compounds of the formula I [sic].<br>
The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical preparation comprising an Otvp3 and/or an (Xyps integrin inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and at least one MMP inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts, and to a pharmaceutical ' preparation comprising an 01^3 and/or an Ovp5 integrin inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and at least one tyrosin kinase inhibitor and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
Preferred Ovp3 and Ovp5 integrin inhibitors are described, for example, in EP 0 770 622, EP 0 710 657, EP 0 820 988, EP 0 820 991. WO 94/12181, WO 94/08577, EP 0 518 586, EO 95/32710, WO 96/00574, WO 96/00730 or in DE 198 50 131.<br><br>

Among MMP inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, those mentioned above are preferred.<br>
Example of testing a combination therapy:<br>
Delay in tumour growth in analogy to Kakeji (F. Mitjans et al., J. Cell Sci. 108: 2825-2838 (1995)):<br>
Lewis lung carcinoma cells (2x 10E6) are injected into C57BL mice 8-10 weeks old. On the fourth day, cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMe-Val)      (30 mg/kg)      is<br>
administered i .p. each day [sic] . The tumour growth is<br>
*<br>
measured each day (B. A. Teicher et al. , Int. J. Cancer 57: "920-925 (1994) ) . Once the tumours have reached a particular volume of about 100 mm3, various cytotoxic combination therapies by intraperitoneal injection start on day 7 after tumour inoculation. Examples: 5-fluorouracil (30 mg/kg) or Adriamycin (1.8 mg/kg) are given each day from day 7 to 11. Cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg), carmustine (15 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (2.5 mg/kg) are given on day 7, 9 and 11. Cisplatin (10 mg/kg) is given on day 7.<br>
The tumours are measured three times a week until a^ volume of approximately 500 mm3 is reached. The delay in tumour growth is calculated as the time required by an individual tumour to reach 500 mm3 compared with untreated controls.<br>
