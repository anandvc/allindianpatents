THE PATENTS (AMENDMENT) RULES 2006<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"2-HYDROXY-MUTILIN CARBAMATE OF FORMULA (I)"<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM P.L.C., a British company, of 980 Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medical therapy, particularly antibacterial therapy.<br>
Pleuromutilin, the compound of formula (A), is a naturally occurring antibiotic which has antimycoplasmai activity and modest antibacterial activity. Mutilin and other compounds with a free OH at C-14 are inactive. The impact of further modification at C-14 on the activity of pleuromutilin has been investigated (H. Egger and H. Reinshagen, J. Antibiotics, . 1976, 29, 923). Replacing the hydroxy group of the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 by another O, S or N-linked group was found to improve anti-microbial activity. Thus, introducing a diethylaminoethylthio group gives the compound of formula (B), also known as Tiamulin, which is used as a veterinary antibiotic (G. Hogenauer in Antibiotics, Vol. V, part 1, ed. F.E. Hahn, Springer-Verlag, 1979, p.344).<br><br>
In this application, the non-conventional numbering system which is generally used in the literature (G. Hogenauer, loc. cit.) is used.<br>
WO 97/25309 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further modification of the acyloxy group, disclosing inter alia 14-O-acyIcarbamoyl (RaCONRbCO2-) derivatives of mutilin in which Ra may have a range of values, including optionally substituted heterocyclic and Rb is a selected from a variety of monovalent groups.<br>
WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives of mutilin in which the N-atom of the carbamoyl group is acylated by a group which includes an azabicyclic moiety.<br>
WO 99/21855 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further derivatives of mutilin or 19,20-dihydromun in, in which the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 is modified. In such compounds, the 2 position (a to the ketogroup) may be substituted by hydroxy. The vast majority of the compounds exemplified therein, however, do not have such a substituent.<br>
In addition 19,20-dihydro-2a-hydroxy-mutilin is described by G. Schulz and H. Bemer in Tetrahedron, 1984, vol. 40, pp 905-917.<br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that certain novel 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives mutilin derivatives further having a (2S)-hydroxy substituent have potent antimicrobial activity.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br><br><br>
in which:<br>
R1 is a 5- or 6-membered optionally substituted heteroaryl group; and R2 is vinyl or ethyl.<br>
In this series of compounds, the introduction of a (2S)-hydroxy substituent is found to impart greater metabolic stability towards liver enzymes than the corresponding 2-unsubstituted counterparts.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups for R1 include those having a 5 or 6-membered single ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms and optionally comprising a further heteroatom selected from oxygen or sulphur, for example pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, isoxazole, thiazole, imidazole, pyrazole; or a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 3 nitrogen atoms, for example, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole; or a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a benzene ring, for example, benzimidazole. Further examples of heteroaryl groups for R1 include those having a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a second 5 or 6-membered optionally substituted heteroaryl ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms.<br>
Representative examples of such heteroaryl groups for R1 include, for example, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, 3-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine, pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine, pyrimidine, and thiazole. Preferred examples of such heteroaryl groups for R1 include, for example, pyridine, pyrimidine, and thiazole.<br>

The compounds of this invention may be in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric hydrates as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are suitably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 50% pure, suitable at least 60% pure, advantageously at least 75% pure, preferably at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, especially at least 98% pure, all percentages being calculated as weight/weight.<br>
Compounds of the invention that contain a basic group such as an amino substituent may be in the form of a free base or an acid addition salt. Compounds having an acidic group such as a carboxy substituent may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Compounds of the invention having both a basic and an acidic centre may be in the form of zwitterions, acid addition salt of the basic centre or alkali metal salts (of the carboxy group). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts include those described by Berge, Bighley, and Monkhouse,J. Pharm. ScL, 1977, 66,1-19. Suitable salts include the hydrochloride, maleate, and methanesulphonate; particularly the hydrochloride.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those described by Berge, Bighley, and Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19. Suitable salts include alkali metal salts such as the sodium and potassium salts.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula (I), which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT):<br><br><br>
(II)<br>
in which X and P are hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group, such as an acyl group, and R^ is as hereinbefore defined;<br>
with an acyl isocyanate of formula R1ACONCO in which R1A is R1 as hereinbefore defined or a group convertible into R1, for instance a group comprising a protected substituent therein and thereafter and if necessary:<br>
(a)	deprotecting a group X and/or P to generate hydroxyl groups at position 11 and 2, respectively,<br>
(b)	converting a group R1A to R1, for instance removing a protecting group,<br>
(c)	converting a group R1 to another group R1, and<br>
(d)	hydrogenating the vinyl group at position 12 to form an ethyl group.<br>
Preferably, it is desirable to use a compound of formula (II) in which both P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups.<br>
Similar such processes have been previously described in WO 97/25309 and WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Methods for preparing acyl isocyanates are described in the literature. For example, they may be prepared by reaction of an acid chloride (R1ACOCl) with silver cyanate {e.g. as described by Murdock and Angier in J. Org. Chem., 1962, 27,3317), tri-«-butyl tin isocyanate (e.g. as described by Akteries and Jochims, Chem. Ber., 1986, U9, 83), or trimethylsilyl isocyanate (e.g. as described by Sheludyakov et al, J. Gen. Chem. USSR, 1977, 2061-2067) in an inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, chloroform, dichloromethane, or 1,2-dichloroethane. Alternatively, they may be prepared by treating a primary amide (RlACONH2) or N,N-bis(trimethyIsilyI) derivative thereof, with oxalyl chloride or phosgene<br>
in an inert solvent (e.g. Speziale and Smith, J. Org. Chem., 1962,27, 3742; Kozyukov, et al, Zh Obshch Khim, 1983, 53,2155).<br>
The formation and reaction of the acyl isocyanate may be conveniently carried out in one process. This typically involves reaction of a compound of formula (IT) with an acid chloride R1ACOCl in the presence of silver cyanate and a tertiary base (e.g. triethylamine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine), usually triethylamine, in an inert solvent (e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichIoroethane).<br>
Thus, in a further aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT) with an acyl chloride compound of formula R1ACOCl, in the presence of silver cyanate and a base, such as triethylamine, and, thereafter, if necessary, carrying out one or more of the following steps in any desired order:<br>
(e)	deprotecting a group P and/or X to generate hydroxyl groups at position 2 and 11, respectively,<br>
(f)	converting a group R1A to R1, for instance removing a protecting group,<br>
(g)	converting one group R1 to another group R1, and<br>
(h) hydrogenating the vinyl group at position 12 to form an ethyl group.<br>
Preferably, it is desirable to use a compound of formula (H) in which both P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups.<br>
Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are those well known in the art and which may be removed under conventional conditions and without disrupting the remainder of the molecule.<br><br>
A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which hydroxy groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given in for example "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991). Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organocarbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Representative values for P include acetate, dichloroacetate or trifluoroacetate, preferably dichloroacetate. Representative values for X include acetate, dichloroacetate or trifluoroacetate, preferably trifluoroacetate. After formation of the 14-O-carbamoyl derivative, the 2- and 11-O-acyl groups may be removed by selective hydrolysis (e.g. using NaOH in MeOH).<br>
Protecting groups which can be used for substituents in R1A for instance amino, carboxy, hydroxy are well known in the art, see for instance "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991). Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organocarbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl: Particularly suitable carboxy protecting groups include alkyl and aryl groups, for instance methyl, ethyl and phenyl. Particularly suitable amino protecting groups include alkoxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) in which R1 = Et may be prepared by reducing a vinyl group Rl by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst (e.g. 10% Palladium-on-carbon) in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, either before or after the carbamoylation of a compound of formula (II).<br>
Compounds of formula (H) in which P and X are both hydroxyl protecting groups are novel intermediates which are of use in preparing compounds of formula (I).<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for a compound of<br>
formula (IT) in which P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups, in particular an organo¬carbonyl group, for instance a (C1-6)aIkylcarbonyl group in which the alkyl moiety may be<br>
substituted by from 1 to 3 halogen atoms, for instance trifluoroacetyl and dichloroacetyl. Preferably, P is dichloroacetyl and X is trifluoroacetyl. A preferred compound of formula (II) is:<br>
(2S)-2-Dichloroacetoxy-11 -O-trifiuoroacetyi-mutilin.<br>
A compound of formula (H) may be prepared from mutilin, via an intermediate 2-diazo compound, the preparation of which is similar to that described by HBemer, et al. in Monatsheftefur Chemie, 1981, vol. 112, pp 1441-1450. This intermediate may then be reacted with a carboxylic acid to give a 2-acyloxy-mutilin derivative. Typically, reaction with dichloroacetic acid gives a 2-dichloroacetoxy-mutilin derivative.<br>
A preferred synthetic route for compounds of formula (I) is outlined in the following scheme:<br><br><br>
using the following reagents and conditions:<br>
(i) ethyl formate, sodium methoxide, toluene, room temperature;<br>
(ii) KOH/EtOH, room temperature;<br>
(iii) tosyl azide, triethylamine, dichloromethane, -10°C to room temperature;<br>
(iv) dichloroacetic acid, dichloromethane, 0°C to room temperature;<br>
(v) trifluoroacetyl imidazole, tetrahydrofuran, room temperature;<br>
(vi) R1ACOCl, silver cyanate, triethylamine, dichloromethane, room temperature;<br>
(vii) 0.5M KOH, EtOH, room temperature.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may contain a chiral centre, and therefore the above processes may produce a mixture of diastereoisomers. A single diastereoisomer may<br><br>
be prepared by separating such a mixture of diastereoisomers by conventional techniques such as chromatography or fractional crystallisation.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. When some of the compounds of this invention are allowed to crystallise or are recrystallised from organic solvents, solvent of crystallisation may be present in the crystalline product. Similarly, some of the compounds of this invention may be crystallised or recrystallised from solvents containing water. In such cases water of hydration may be present in the crystalline product. Crystallisation procedures will usually produce stoichiometric hydrates. Compounds containing variable amounts of water may be produced by processes such as lyophilisation.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are suitably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 50% pure, suitable at least 60% pure, advantageously at least 75% pure, preferably at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, especially at least 98% pure, all percentages being calculated as weight/weight. An impure or less pure form of a compound according to the invention may, for example, be used in the preparation of a more pure form of the same compound or of a related compound (for example a corresponding derivative) suitable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives of the compounds of the invention. Salt formation may be possible when one of the substituents carries an acidic or basic group. Salts may be prepared by salt exchange in conventional manner.<br>
Acid-addition salts may be pharmaceutically acceptable or non-pharmaceutically acceptable. In the latter case, such salts may be useful for isolation and purification of the compound of the invention, or intermediates thereto, and will subsequently be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or the free base.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives have antimicrobial properties and are therefore of use in therapy, in particular for treating microbial infections in animals, especially mammals, including humans, in particular humans and domesticated animals (including farm animals). The compounds may be used for the treatment of infections caused by, for example, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasmas, including, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp., Legionella sp., Chlamydia sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating microbial infections in animals, especially in humans and in domesticated mammals, which comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof, or a composition according to the invention, to a patient in need thereof.<br>
Compounds of the present invention show good activity against Chlamydia pneumoniae. This has been implicated in heart disease, in particular in promoting vascular infection (see for instance FR 2 771 008-Al, Hoechst Marion Roussel SA). Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing C. pneumoniae -induced atherosclerosis which method comprises treating a subject in need thereof with an<br><br>
effective amount of a compound of formula (I). A compound of formula (I) may also be used in combination with an anti-atherosclerotic agent, to reduce the incidence of heart attack and other cardiac events. Representative examples of anti-atherosclerotic agents include the class, of cholesterol-lowering compounds referred to generically as "statins", for instance atorvastatin (Lipitor, 'Warner Lambert), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Lipovas, Merck) and cerivastatin (Baycol, Bayer). It has also been suggested that Chlamydia pneumoniae may contribute to Alzheimer's Disease. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating Alzheimer's Disease which method comprises treating a subject in heed thereof with an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The invention further provides the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of microbial infections.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be used to treat skin and soft tissue infections and acne, by topical application. Accordingly, in a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament adapted for topical administration for use in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and also in the treatment of acne in humans.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be also used for the elimination or reduction of nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. pneumonia and M. catarrhalis, in particular colonisation of the nasospharynx by such organisms, by the administration of a compound of the present invention thereto. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament adapted for administration to the nasal cavity, for reducing or eliminating the nasal carriage of pathogenic organisms. Preferably, the medicament is adapted for focussed delivery to the nasopharynx, in particular the anterior nasopharynx.<br>
Such reduction or elimination of nasal carriage is believed to be useful in prophylaxis of recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis (RABS) or recurrent otitis media in humans, in particular in reducing the number of episodes experienced by a patient over a given period of time or increasing the time intervals between episodes. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament adapted for administration to the nasal cavity, for prophylaxis of recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis or recurrent otitis media.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may suitably be administered to the patient at a daily dosage of from 1.0 to 50 mg/kg of body weight. For an adult human (of approximately 70 kg body weight), from 50 to 3000 mg, for example about 1500 mg, of a compound according to the invention may be administered daily. Suitably, the dosage for adult humans is from 5 to 20 mg/kg per day. Higher or lower dosages may, however, be used in accordance with normal clinical practice.<br>
To lessen the risk of encouraging the development of resistant organisms during prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis, it is preferred to administer the drug on an intermittent, rather than a continual, basis. In a suitable intermittent<br><br><br>
   treatment regimen for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent sinusitis, drug substance is administered on a daily basis, for a small number of days, for instance from 2 to 10, suitably 3 to 8, more suitably about 5 days, the administration then being repeated after an interval, for instance, on a monthly basis over a period of months, for instance up to six months. Less preferably, the drug substance may be administered on a continuing, daily basis, over a prolonged period, for instance several months. Suitably, for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent sinusitis, drug substance is administered once or twice a day. Suitably, drug substance is administered during the winter months when bacterial infections such as recurrent otitis media and recurrent sinusitis tend to be more prevalent. The drug substance may be administered at a dosage of from 0.05 to l.OOmg, typically about 0.1 to 0.2mg, in each nostril, once or twice a day.<br>
More generally, the compounds and compositions according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other antibiotics.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The compounds and compositions according to the invention may be formulated for administration by any route, for example oral, topical or parenteral. The compositions may, for example, be made up in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, creams, syrups, sprays or liquid preparations, for example solutions or suspensions, which may be formulated for oral use or in sterile form for parenteral administration by injection or infusion.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dosage form, and may contain conventional excipients including, for example, binding agents, for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example potato starch; and pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents, for example sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives, including, for example, suspending agents, for example sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, oily esters (for example glycerine), propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and, if desired, conventional flavouring and colour agents.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for topical administration may, for example, be in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, eye ointments, eye drops, ear drops, nose drops, nasal sprays, impregnated dressings, and aerosols, and may contain appropriate<br><br><br>
conventional additives, including, for example, preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration, and emollients in ointments and creams. Such topical formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, for example cream or ointment bases, ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions and aqueous bases for sprays. Such carriers may constitute from about 1% to about 98% by weight of the formulation; more usually they will constitute up to about 80% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for topical administration, in addition to the above, may also contain a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent; for example, betamethasone.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may be formulated as suppositories, which may contain conventional suppository bases, for example cocoa-butter or other glycerides.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for parenteral administration may conveniently be in fluid unit dosage forms, which may be prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, may be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound may be dissolved in water for injection and filter-sterilised before being filled into a suitable vial or ampoule, which is then sealed. Advantageously, conventional additives including, for example, local anaesthetics, preservatives, and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. In order to enhance the stability of the solution, the composition may be frozen after being filled into the vial, and the water removed under vacuum; the resulting dry lyophilised powder may then be sealed in the vial and a accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions may be prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound may instead be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before being suspended in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in such suspensions in order to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
A compound or composition according to the invention is suitably administered to the patient in an antimicrobially effective amount.<br>
A composition according to the invention may suitably contain from 0.001% by weight, preferably (for other than spray compositions) from 10 to 60% by weight, of a compound according to the invention (based on the total weight of the composition), depending on the method of administration.<br>
When the compositions according to the invention are presented in unit dosage form, for instance as a tablet, each unit dose may suitably comprise from 25 to 1000 mg, preferable from 50 to 500 mg, of a compound according to the invention.<br>
Representative compositions of the present invention include those adapted for intranasal administration, in particular, those that will reach into the nasopharynx. Such compositions are preferably adapted for focussed delivery to, and residence within, the nasopharynx. The term 'focussed delivery' is used to mean that the composition is delivered to the nasopharynx, rather than remaining within the nares. The term 'residence' within the nasopharynx is used to mean that the composition, once delivered to the nasopharynx, remains within the nasopharynx over a course of several hours, rather than being washed<br><br>
away more or less immediately. Preferred compositions include spray compositions and creams. Representative spray compositions include aqueous compositions, as well as oily compositions that contain amphiphilic agents so that the composition increases in viscosity when in contact with moisture. Creams may also be used, especially creams having a rheology that allows the cream to spread readily in the nasopharynx.<br>
Preferred aqueous spray compositions include, in addition to water, further excipients including a tonicity modifier such as a salt, for instance sodium chloride; preservative, such as benzalkonium salt; a surfactant such as a non-ionic surfactant, for instance a polysorbate; and buffer, such as sodium dihydrogen phosphate; present in low levels, typically less than 1%.<br>
The pH of the composition may also be adjusted, for optimum stability of the drug substance during storage. For compounds of the present invention, a pH in the range 5 to 6, preferably about 5.3 to 5.8, typically about 5.5 is optimal.<br>
Representative oily spray and cream compositions are described in WO 99/07341 and WO 99/12520 (SmithKline Beecham). Representative aqueous sprays have previously been described in WO 99/21855 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Suitably, the drug substance is present in compositions for nasal delivery in between 0.001 and 5%, preferably 0.005 and 3%, by weight of the composition. Suitable amounts include 0.5% and 1% by weight of the composition (for oily compositions and creams) and from 0.01 to 0.2% (aqueous compositions).<br>
Spray compositions according to the present invention may be delivered to the nasal cavity by spray devices well known in the art for nasal sprays, for instance an air lift pump. Preferred devices include those that are metered to provide a unit volume of composition, preferably about 100µl, and optionally adapted for nasal administration by addition of a modified nozzle.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br><br>

"2-HYDROXY-MUTILIN CARBAMATE OF FORMULA (I)"<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM P.L.C., a British company, of 980 Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medical therapy, particularly antibacterial therapy.<br>
Pleuromutilin, the compound of formula (A), is a naturally occurring antibiotic which has antimycoplasmai activity and modest antibacterial activity. Mutilin and other compounds with a free OH at C-14 are inactive. The impact of further modification at C-14 on the activity of pleuromutilin has been investigated (H. Egger and H. Reinshagen, J. Antibiotics, . 1976, 29, 923). Replacing the hydroxy group of the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 by another O, S or N-linked group was found to improve anti-microbial activity. Thus, introducing a diethylaminoethylthio group gives the compound of formula (B), also known as Tiamulin, which is used as a veterinary antibiotic (G. Hogenauer in Antibiotics, Vol. V, part 1, ed. F.E. Hahn, Springer-Verlag, 1979, p.344).<br><br>
In this application, the non-conventional numbering system which is generally used in the literature (G. Hogenauer, loc. cit.) is used.<br>
WO 97/25309 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further modification of the acyloxy group, disclosing inter alia 14-O-acyIcarbamoyl (RaCONRbCO2-) derivatives of mutilin in which Ra may have a range of values, including optionally substituted heterocyclic and Rb is a selected from a variety of monovalent groups.<br>
WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives of mutilin in which the N-atom of the carbamoyl group is acylated by a group which includes an azabicyclic moiety.<br>
WO 99/21855 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further derivatives of mutilin or 19,20-dihydromun in, in which the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 is modified. In such compounds, the 2 position (a to the ketogroup) may be substituted by hydroxy. The vast majority of the compounds exemplified therein, however, do not have such a substituent.<br>
In addition 19,20-dihydro-2a-hydroxy-mutilin is described by G. Schulz and H. Bemer in Tetrahedron, 1984, vol. 40, pp 905-917.<br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that certain novel 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives mutilin derivatives further having a (2S)-hydroxy substituent have potent antimicrobial activity.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br><br><br>
in which:<br>
R1 is a 5- or 6-membered optionally substituted heteroaryl group; and R2 is vinyl or ethyl.<br>
In this series of compounds, the introduction of a (2S)-hydroxy substituent is found to impart greater metabolic stability towards liver enzymes than the corresponding 2-unsubstituted counterparts.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups for R1 include those having a 5 or 6-membered single ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms and optionally comprising a further heteroatom selected from oxygen or sulphur, for example pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, isoxazole, thiazole, imidazole, pyrazole; or a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 3 nitrogen atoms, for example, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole; or a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a benzene ring, for example, benzimidazole. Further examples of heteroaryl groups for R1 include those having a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a second 5 or 6-membered optionally substituted heteroaryl ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms.<br>
Representative examples of such heteroaryl groups for R1 include, for example, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, 3-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine, pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine, pyrimidine, and thiazole. Preferred examples of such heteroaryl groups for R1 include, for example, pyridine, pyrimidine, and thiazole.<br>

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those described by Berge, Bighley, and Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19. Suitable salts include alkali metal salts such as the sodium and potassium salts.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula (I), which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT):<br><br><br>
(II)<br>
in which X and P are hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group, such as an acyl group, and R^ is as hereinbefore defined;<br>
with an acyl isocyanate of formula R1ACONCO in which R1A is R1 as hereinbefore defined or a group convertible into R1, for instance a group comprising a protected substituent therein and thereafter and if necessary:<br>
(a)	deprotecting a group X and/or P to generate hydroxyl groups at position 11 and 2, respectively,<br>
(b)	converting a group R1A to R1, for instance removing a protecting group,<br>
(c)	converting a group R1 to another group R1, and<br>
(d)	hydrogenating the vinyl group at position 12 to form an ethyl group.<br>
Preferably, it is desirable to use a compound of formula (II) in which both P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups.<br>
Similar such processes have been previously described in WO 97/25309 and WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Methods for preparing acyl isocyanates are described in the literature. For example, they may be prepared by reaction of an acid chloride (R1ACOCl) with silver cyanate {e.g. as described by Murdock and Angier in J. Org. Chem., 1962, 27,3317), tri-«-butyl tin isocyanate (e.g. as described by Akteries and Jochims, Chem. Ber., 1986, U9, 83), or trimethylsilyl isocyanate (e.g. as described by Sheludyakov et al, J. Gen. Chem. USSR, 1977, 2061-2067) in an inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, chloroform, dichloromethane, or 1,2-dichloroethane. Alternatively, they may be prepared by treating a primary amide (RlACONH2) or N,N-bis(trimethyIsilyI) derivative thereof, with oxalyl chloride or phosgene<br>
in an inert solvent (e.g. Speziale and Smith, J. Org. Chem., 1962,27, 3742; Kozyukov, et al, Zh Obshch Khim, 1983, 53,2155).<br>
The formation and reaction of the acyl isocyanate may be conveniently carried out in one process. This typically involves reaction of a compound of formula (IT) with an acid chloride R1ACOCl in the presence of silver cyanate and a tertiary base (e.g. triethylamine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine), usually triethylamine, in an inert solvent (e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichIoroethane).<br>
Thus, in a further aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT) with an acyl chloride compound of formula R1ACOCl, in the presence of silver cyanate and a base, such as triethylamine, and, thereafter, if necessary, carrying out one or more of the following steps in any desired order:<br>
(e)	deprotecting a group P and/or X to generate hydroxyl groups at position 2 and 11, respectively,<br>
(f)	converting a group R1A to R1, for instance removing a protecting group,<br>
(g)	converting one group R1 to another group R1, and<br>
(h) hydrogenating the vinyl group at position 12 to form an ethyl group.<br>
Preferably, it is desirable to use a compound of formula (H) in which both P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups.<br>
Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are those well known in the art and which may be removed under conventional conditions and without disrupting the remainder of the molecule.<br><br>
A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which hydroxy groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given in for example "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991). Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organocarbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Representative values for P include acetate, dichloroacetate or trifluoroacetate, preferably dichloroacetate. Representative values for X include acetate, dichloroacetate or trifluoroacetate, preferably trifluoroacetate. After formation of the 14-O-carbamoyl derivative, the 2- and 11-O-acyl groups may be removed by selective hydrolysis (e.g. using NaOH in MeOH).<br>
Protecting groups which can be used for substituents in R1A for instance amino, carboxy, hydroxy are well known in the art, see for instance "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991). Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organocarbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl: Particularly suitable carboxy protecting groups include alkyl and aryl groups, for instance methyl, ethyl and phenyl. Particularly suitable amino protecting groups include alkoxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) in which R1 = Et may be prepared by reducing a vinyl group Rl by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst (e.g. 10% Palladium-on-carbon) in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, either before or after the carbamoylation of a compound of formula (II).<br>
Compounds of formula (H) in which P and X are both hydroxyl protecting groups are novel intermediates which are of use in preparing compounds of formula (I).<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for a compound of<br>
formula (IT) in which P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups, in particular an organo¬carbonyl group, for instance a (C1-6)aIkylcarbonyl group in which the alkyl moiety may be<br>
substituted by from 1 to 3 halogen atoms, for instance trifluoroacetyl and dichloroacetyl. Preferably, P is dichloroacetyl and X is trifluoroacetyl. A preferred compound of formula (II) is:<br>
(2S)-2-Dichloroacetoxy-11 -O-trifiuoroacetyi-mutilin.<br>
A compound of formula (H) may be prepared from mutilin, via an intermediate 2-diazo compound, the preparation of which is similar to that described by HBemer, et al. in Monatsheftefur Chemie, 1981, vol. 112, pp 1441-1450. This intermediate may then be reacted with a carboxylic acid to give a 2-acyloxy-mutilin derivative. Typically, reaction with dichloroacetic acid gives a 2-dichloroacetoxy-mutilin derivative.<br>
A preferred synthetic route for compounds of formula (I) is outlined in the following scheme:<br><br><br>
using the following reagents and conditions:<br>
(i) ethyl formate, sodium methoxide, toluene, room temperature;<br>
(ii) KOH/EtOH, room temperature;<br>
(iii) tosyl azide, triethylamine, dichloromethane, -10°C to room temperature;<br>
(iv) dichloroacetic acid, dichloromethane, 0°C to room temperature;<br>
(v) trifluoroacetyl imidazole, tetrahydrofuran, room temperature;<br>
(vi) R1ACOCl, silver cyanate, triethylamine, dichloromethane, room temperature;<br>
(vii) 0.5M KOH, EtOH, room temperature.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may contain a chiral centre, and therefore the above processes may produce a mixture of diastereoisomers. A single diastereoisomer may<br><br>
be prepared by separating such a mixture of diastereoisomers by conventional techniques such as chromatography or fractional crystallisation.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. When some of the compounds of this invention are allowed to crystallise or are recrystallised from organic solvents, solvent of crystallisation may be present in the crystalline product. Similarly, some of the compounds of this invention may be crystallised or recrystallised from solvents containing water. In such cases water of hydration may be present in the crystalline product. Crystallisation procedures will usually produce stoichiometric hydrates. Compounds containing variable amounts of water may be produced by processes such as lyophilisation.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are suitably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 50% pure, suitable at least 60% pure, advantageously at least 75% pure, preferably at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, especially at least 98% pure, all percentages being calculated as weight/weight. An impure or less pure form of a compound according to the invention may, for example, be used in the preparation of a more pure form of the same compound or of a related compound (for example a corresponding derivative) suitable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives of the compounds of the invention. Salt formation may be possible when one of the substituents carries an acidic or basic group. Salts may be prepared by salt exchange in conventional manner.<br>
Acid-addition salts may be pharmaceutically acceptable or non-pharmaceutically acceptable. In the latter case, such salts may be useful for isolation and purification of the compound of the invention, or intermediates thereto, and will subsequently be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or the free base.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives have antimicrobial properties and are therefore of use in therapy, in particular for treating microbial infections in animals, especially mammals, including humans, in particular humans and domesticated animals (including farm animals). The compounds may be used for the treatment of infections caused by, for example, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasmas, including, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp., Legionella sp., Chlamydia sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating microbial infections in animals, especially in humans and in domesticated mammals, which comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof, or a composition according to the invention, to a patient in need thereof.<br>
Compounds of the present invention show good activity against Chlamydia pneumoniae. This has been implicated in heart disease, in particular in promoting vascular infection (see for instance FR 2 771 008-Al, Hoechst Marion Roussel SA). Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing C. pneumoniae -induced atherosclerosis which method comprises treating a subject in need thereof with an<br><br>
effective amount of a compound of formula (I). A compound of formula (I) may also be used in combination with an anti-atherosclerotic agent, to reduce the incidence of heart attack and other cardiac events. Representative examples of anti-atherosclerotic agents include the class, of cholesterol-lowering compounds referred to generically as "statins", for instance atorvastatin (Lipitor, 'Warner Lambert), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Lipovas, Merck) and cerivastatin (Baycol, Bayer). It has also been suggested that Chlamydia pneumoniae may contribute to Alzheimer's Disease. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating Alzheimer's Disease which method comprises treating a subject in heed thereof with an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The invention further provides the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of microbial infections.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be used to treat skin and soft tissue infections and acne, by topical application. Accordingly, in a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament adapted for topical administration for use in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and also in the treatment of acne in humans.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be also used for the elimination or reduction of nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. pneumonia and M. catarrhalis, in particular colonisation of the nasospharynx by such organisms, by the administration of a compound of the present invention thereto. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament adapted for administration to the nasal cavity, for reducing or eliminating the nasal carriage of pathogenic organisms. Preferably, the medicament is adapted for focussed delivery to the nasopharynx, in particular the anterior nasopharynx.<br>
Such reduction or elimination of nasal carriage is believed to be useful in prophylaxis of recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis (RABS) or recurrent otitis media in humans, in particular in reducing the number of episodes experienced by a patient over a given period of time or increasing the time intervals between episodes. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament adapted for administration to the nasal cavity, for prophylaxis of recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis or recurrent otitis media.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may suitably be administered to the patient at a daily dosage of from 1.0 to 50 mg/kg of body weight. For an adult human (of approximately 70 kg body weight), from 50 to 3000 mg, for example about 1500 mg, of a compound according to the invention may be administered daily. Suitably, the dosage for adult humans is from 5 to 20 mg/kg per day. Higher or lower dosages may, however, be used in accordance with normal clinical practice.<br>
To lessen the risk of encouraging the development of resistant organisms during prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis, it is preferred to administer the drug on an intermittent, rather than a continual, basis. In a suitable intermittent<br><br><br>
   treatment regimen for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent sinusitis, drug substance is administered on a daily basis, for a small number of days, for instance from 2 to 10, suitably 3 to 8, more suitably about 5 days, the administration then being repeated after an interval, for instance, on a monthly basis over a period of months, for instance up to six months. Less preferably, the drug substance may be administered on a continuing, daily basis, over a prolonged period, for instance several months. Suitably, for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent sinusitis, drug substance is administered once or twice a day. Suitably, drug substance is administered during the winter months when bacterial infections such as recurrent otitis media and recurrent sinusitis tend to be more prevalent. The drug substance may be administered at a dosage of from 0.05 to l.OOmg, typically about 0.1 to 0.2mg, in each nostril, once or twice a day.<br>
More generally, the compounds and compositions according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other antibiotics.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The compounds and compositions according to the invention may be formulated for administration by any route, for example oral, topical or parenteral. The compositions may, for example, be made up in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, creams, syrups, sprays or liquid preparations, for example solutions or suspensions, which may be formulated for oral use or in sterile form for parenteral administration by injection or infusion.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dosage form, and may contain conventional excipients including, for example, binding agents, for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example potato starch; and pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents, for example sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives, including, for example, suspending agents, for example sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, oily esters (for example glycerine), propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and, if desired, conventional flavouring and colour agents.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for topical administration may, for example, be in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, eye ointments, eye drops, ear drops, nose drops, nasal sprays, impregnated dressings, and aerosols, and may contain appropriate<br><br><br>
conventional additives, including, for example, preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration, and emollients in ointments and creams. Such topical formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, for example cream or ointment bases, ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions and aqueous bases for sprays. Such carriers may constitute from about 1% to about 98% by weight of the formulation; more usually they will constitute up to about 80% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for topical administration, in addition to the above, may also contain a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent; for example, betamethasone.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may be formulated as suppositories, which may contain conventional suppository bases, for example cocoa-butter or other glycerides.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for parenteral administration may conveniently be in fluid unit dosage forms, which may be prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, may be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound may be dissolved in water for injection and filter-sterilised before being filled into a suitable vial or ampoule, which is then sealed. Advantageously, conventional additives including, for example, local anaesthetics, preservatives, and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. In order to enhance the stability of the solution, the composition may be frozen after being filled into the vial, and the water removed under vacuum; the resulting dry lyophilised powder may then be sealed in the vial and a accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions may be prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound may instead be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before being suspended in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in such suspensions in order to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
A compound or composition according to the invention is suitably administered to the patient in an antimicrobially effective amount.<br>
A composition according to the invention may suitably contain from 0.001% by weight, preferably (for other than spray compositions) from 10 to 60% by weight, of a compound according to the invention (based on the total weight of the composition), depending on the method of administration.<br>
When the compositions according to the invention are presented in unit dosage form, for instance as a tablet, each unit dose may suitably comprise from 25 to 1000 mg, preferable from 50 to 500 mg, of a compound according to the invention.<br>
Representative compositions of the present invention include those adapted for intranasal administration, in particular, those that will reach into the nasopharynx. Such compositions are preferably adapted for focussed delivery to, and residence within, the nasopharynx. The term 'focussed delivery' is used to mean that the composition is delivered to the nasopharynx, rather than remaining within the nares. The term 'residence' within the nasopharynx is used to mean that the composition, once delivered to the nasopharynx, remains within the nasopharynx over a course of several hours, rather than being washed<br><br>
away more or less immediately. Preferred compositions include spray compositions and creams. Representative spray compositions include aqueous compositions, as well as oily compositions that contain amphiphilic agents so that the composition increases in viscosity when in contact with moisture. Creams may also be used, especially creams having a rheology that allows the cream to spread readily in the nasopharynx.<br>
Preferred aqueous spray compositions include, in addition to water, further excipients including a tonicity modifier such as a salt, for instance sodium chloride; preservative, such as benzalkonium salt; a surfactant such as a non-ionic surfactant, for instance a polysorbate; and buffer, such as sodium dihydrogen phosphate; present in low levels, typically less than 1%.<br>
The pH of the composition may also be adjusted, for optimum stability of the drug substance during storage. For compounds of the present invention, a pH in the range 5 to 6, preferably about 5.3 to 5.8, typically about 5.5 is optimal.<br>
Representative oily spray and cream compositions are described in WO 99/07341 and WO 99/12520 (SmithKline Beecham). Representative aqueous sprays have previously been described in WO 99/21855 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Suitably, the drug substance is present in compositions for nasal delivery in between 0.001 and 5%, preferably 0.005 and 3%, by weight of the composition. Suitable amounts include 0.5% and 1% by weight of the composition (for oily compositions and creams) and from 0.01 to 0.2% (aqueous compositions).<br>
Spray compositions according to the present invention may be delivered to the nasal cavity by spray devices well known in the art for nasal sprays, for instance an air lift pump. Preferred devices include those that are metered to provide a unit volume of composition, preferably about 100µl, and optionally adapted for nasal administration by addition of a modified nozzle.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br><br>

"2-HYDROXY-MUTILIN CARBAMATE OF FORMULA (I)"<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM P.L.C., a British company, of 980 Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medical therapy, particularly antibacterial therapy.<br>
Pleuromutilin, the compound of formula (A), is a naturally occurring antibiotic which has antimycoplasmai activity and modest antibacterial activity. Mutilin and other compounds with a free OH at C-14 are inactive. The impact of further modification at C-14 on the activity of pleuromutilin has been investigated (H. Egger and H. Reinshagen, J. Antibiotics, . 1976, 29, 923). Replacing the hydroxy group of the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 by another O, S or N-linked group was found to improve anti-microbial activity. Thus, introducing a diethylaminoethylthio group gives the compound of formula (B), also known as Tiamulin, which is used as a veterinary antibiotic (G. Hogenauer in Antibiotics, Vol. V, part 1, ed. F.E. Hahn, Springer-Verlag, 1979, p.344).<br><br>
In this application, the non-conventional numbering system which is generally used in the literature (G. Hogenauer, loc. cit.) is used.<br>
WO 97/25309 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further modification of the acyloxy group, disclosing inter alia 14-O-acyIcarbamoyl (RaCONRbCO2-) derivatives of mutilin in which Ra may have a range of values, including optionally substituted heterocyclic and Rb is a selected from a variety of monovalent groups.<br>
WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives of mutilin in which the N-atom of the carbamoyl group is acylated by a group which includes an azabicyclic moiety.<br>
WO 99/21855 (SmithKline Beecham) describes further derivatives of mutilin or 19,20-dihydromun in, in which the glycolic ester moiety at position 14 is modified. In such compounds, the 2 position (a to the ketogroup) may be substituted by hydroxy. The vast majority of the compounds exemplified therein, however, do not have such a substituent.<br>
In addition 19,20-dihydro-2a-hydroxy-mutilin is described by G. Schulz and H. Bemer in Tetrahedron, 1984, vol. 40, pp 905-917.<br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that certain novel 14-O-carbamoyl derivatives mutilin derivatives further having a (2S)-hydroxy substituent have potent antimicrobial activity.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):<br><br><br>
in which:<br>
R1 is a 5- or 6-membered optionally substituted heteroaryl group; and R2 is vinyl or ethyl.<br>
In this series of compounds, the introduction of a (2S)-hydroxy substituent is found to impart greater metabolic stability towards liver enzymes than the corresponding 2-unsubstituted counterparts.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups for R1 include those having a 5 or 6-membered single ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms and optionally comprising a further heteroatom selected from oxygen or sulphur, for example pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, isoxazole, thiazole, imidazole, pyrazole; or a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 3 nitrogen atoms, for example, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole; or a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a benzene ring, for example, benzimidazole. Further examples of heteroaryl groups for R1 include those having a 5 or 6-membered ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a second 5 or 6-membered optionally substituted heteroaryl ring comprising 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms.<br>
Representative examples of such heteroaryl groups for R1 include, for example, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, 3-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine, pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine, pyrimidine, and thiazole. Preferred examples of such heteroaryl groups for R1 include, for example, pyridine, pyrimidine, and thiazole.<br>

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those described by Berge, Bighley, and Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19. Suitable salts include alkali metal salts such as the sodium and potassium salts.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula (I), which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT):<br><br><br>
(II)<br>
in which X and P are hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group, such as an acyl group, and R^ is as hereinbefore defined;<br>
with an acyl isocyanate of formula R1ACONCO in which R1A is R1 as hereinbefore defined or a group convertible into R1, for instance a group comprising a protected substituent therein and thereafter and if necessary:<br>
(a)	deprotecting a group X and/or P to generate hydroxyl groups at position 11 and 2, respectively,<br>
(b)	converting a group R1A to R1, for instance removing a protecting group,<br>
(c)	converting a group R1 to another group R1, and<br>
(d)	hydrogenating the vinyl group at position 12 to form an ethyl group.<br>
Preferably, it is desirable to use a compound of formula (II) in which both P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups.<br>
Similar such processes have been previously described in WO 97/25309 and WO 98/05659 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Methods for preparing acyl isocyanates are described in the literature. For example, they may be prepared by reaction of an acid chloride (R1ACOCl) with silver cyanate {e.g. as described by Murdock and Angier in J. Org. Chem., 1962, 27,3317), tri-«-butyl tin isocyanate (e.g. as described by Akteries and Jochims, Chem. Ber., 1986, U9, 83), or trimethylsilyl isocyanate (e.g. as described by Sheludyakov et al, J. Gen. Chem. USSR, 1977, 2061-2067) in an inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, chloroform, dichloromethane, or 1,2-dichloroethane. Alternatively, they may be prepared by treating a primary amide (RlACONH2) or N,N-bis(trimethyIsilyI) derivative thereof, with oxalyl chloride or phosgene<br>
in an inert solvent (e.g. Speziale and Smith, J. Org. Chem., 1962,27, 3742; Kozyukov, et al, Zh Obshch Khim, 1983, 53,2155).<br>
The formation and reaction of the acyl isocyanate may be conveniently carried out in one process. This typically involves reaction of a compound of formula (IT) with an acid chloride R1ACOCl in the presence of silver cyanate and a tertiary base (e.g. triethylamine, diisopropyl ethylamine, pyridine), usually triethylamine, in an inert solvent (e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichIoroethane).<br>
Thus, in a further aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT) with an acyl chloride compound of formula R1ACOCl, in the presence of silver cyanate and a base, such as triethylamine, and, thereafter, if necessary, carrying out one or more of the following steps in any desired order:<br>
(e)	deprotecting a group P and/or X to generate hydroxyl groups at position 2 and 11, respectively,<br>
(f)	converting a group R1A to R1, for instance removing a protecting group,<br>
(g)	converting one group R1 to another group R1, and<br>
(h) hydrogenating the vinyl group at position 12 to form an ethyl group.<br>
Preferably, it is desirable to use a compound of formula (H) in which both P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups.<br>
Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are those well known in the art and which may be removed under conventional conditions and without disrupting the remainder of the molecule.<br><br>
A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which hydroxy groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given in for example "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991). Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organocarbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Representative values for P include acetate, dichloroacetate or trifluoroacetate, preferably dichloroacetate. Representative values for X include acetate, dichloroacetate or trifluoroacetate, preferably trifluoroacetate. After formation of the 14-O-carbamoyl derivative, the 2- and 11-O-acyl groups may be removed by selective hydrolysis (e.g. using NaOH in MeOH).<br>
Protecting groups which can be used for substituents in R1A for instance amino, carboxy, hydroxy are well known in the art, see for instance "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2nd edition, 1991). Particularly suitable hydroxy protecting groups include, for example, triorganosilyl groups such as, for instance, trialkylsilyl and also organocarbonyl and organooxycarbonyl groups such as, for instance, acetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl: Particularly suitable carboxy protecting groups include alkyl and aryl groups, for instance methyl, ethyl and phenyl. Particularly suitable amino protecting groups include alkoxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) in which R1 = Et may be prepared by reducing a vinyl group Rl by hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst (e.g. 10% Palladium-on-carbon) in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, either before or after the carbamoylation of a compound of formula (II).<br>
Compounds of formula (H) in which P and X are both hydroxyl protecting groups are novel intermediates which are of use in preparing compounds of formula (I).<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for a compound of<br>
formula (IT) in which P and X are hydroxyl protecting groups, in particular an organo¬carbonyl group, for instance a (C1-6)aIkylcarbonyl group in which the alkyl moiety may be<br>
substituted by from 1 to 3 halogen atoms, for instance trifluoroacetyl and dichloroacetyl. Preferably, P is dichloroacetyl and X is trifluoroacetyl. A preferred compound of formula (II) is:<br>
(2S)-2-Dichloroacetoxy-11 -O-trifiuoroacetyi-mutilin.<br>
A compound of formula (H) may be prepared from mutilin, via an intermediate 2-diazo compound, the preparation of which is similar to that described by HBemer, et al. in Monatsheftefur Chemie, 1981, vol. 112, pp 1441-1450. This intermediate may then be reacted with a carboxylic acid to give a 2-acyloxy-mutilin derivative. Typically, reaction with dichloroacetic acid gives a 2-dichloroacetoxy-mutilin derivative.<br>
A preferred synthetic route for compounds of formula (I) is outlined in the following scheme:<br><br><br>
using the following reagents and conditions:<br>
(i) ethyl formate, sodium methoxide, toluene, room temperature;<br>
(ii) KOH/EtOH, room temperature;<br>
(iii) tosyl azide, triethylamine, dichloromethane, -10°C to room temperature;<br>
(iv) dichloroacetic acid, dichloromethane, 0°C to room temperature;<br>
(v) trifluoroacetyl imidazole, tetrahydrofuran, room temperature;<br>
(vi) R1ACOCl, silver cyanate, triethylamine, dichloromethane, room temperature;<br>
(vii) 0.5M KOH, EtOH, room temperature.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may contain a chiral centre, and therefore the above processes may produce a mixture of diastereoisomers. A single diastereoisomer may<br><br>
be prepared by separating such a mixture of diastereoisomers by conventional techniques such as chromatography or fractional crystallisation.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. When some of the compounds of this invention are allowed to crystallise or are recrystallised from organic solvents, solvent of crystallisation may be present in the crystalline product. Similarly, some of the compounds of this invention may be crystallised or recrystallised from solvents containing water. In such cases water of hydration may be present in the crystalline product. Crystallisation procedures will usually produce stoichiometric hydrates. Compounds containing variable amounts of water may be produced by processes such as lyophilisation.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are suitably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 50% pure, suitable at least 60% pure, advantageously at least 75% pure, preferably at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, especially at least 98% pure, all percentages being calculated as weight/weight. An impure or less pure form of a compound according to the invention may, for example, be used in the preparation of a more pure form of the same compound or of a related compound (for example a corresponding derivative) suitable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives of the compounds of the invention. Salt formation may be possible when one of the substituents carries an acidic or basic group. Salts may be prepared by salt exchange in conventional manner.<br>
Acid-addition salts may be pharmaceutically acceptable or non-pharmaceutically acceptable. In the latter case, such salts may be useful for isolation and purification of the compound of the invention, or intermediates thereto, and will subsequently be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or the free base.<br>
The compounds of the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives have antimicrobial properties and are therefore of use in therapy, in particular for treating microbial infections in animals, especially mammals, including humans, in particular humans and domesticated animals (including farm animals). The compounds may be used for the treatment of infections caused by, for example, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasmas, including, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp., Legionella sp., Chlamydia sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating microbial infections in animals, especially in humans and in domesticated mammals, which comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof, or a composition according to the invention, to a patient in need thereof.<br>
Compounds of the present invention show good activity against Chlamydia pneumoniae. This has been implicated in heart disease, in particular in promoting vascular infection (see for instance FR 2 771 008-Al, Hoechst Marion Roussel SA). Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing C. pneumoniae -induced atherosclerosis which method comprises treating a subject in need thereof with an<br><br>
effective amount of a compound of formula (I). A compound of formula (I) may also be used in combination with an anti-atherosclerotic agent, to reduce the incidence of heart attack and other cardiac events. Representative examples of anti-atherosclerotic agents include the class, of cholesterol-lowering compounds referred to generically as "statins", for instance atorvastatin (Lipitor, 'Warner Lambert), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Lipovas, Merck) and cerivastatin (Baycol, Bayer). It has also been suggested that Chlamydia pneumoniae may contribute to Alzheimer's Disease. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating Alzheimer's Disease which method comprises treating a subject in heed thereof with an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The invention further provides the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of microbial infections.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be used to treat skin and soft tissue infections and acne, by topical application. Accordingly, in a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the preparation of a medicament adapted for topical administration for use in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and also in the treatment of acne in humans.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be also used for the elimination or reduction of nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. pneumonia and M. catarrhalis, in particular colonisation of the nasospharynx by such organisms, by the administration of a compound of the present invention thereto. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament adapted for administration to the nasal cavity, for reducing or eliminating the nasal carriage of pathogenic organisms. Preferably, the medicament is adapted for focussed delivery to the nasopharynx, in particular the anterior nasopharynx.<br>
Such reduction or elimination of nasal carriage is believed to be useful in prophylaxis of recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis (RABS) or recurrent otitis media in humans, in particular in reducing the number of episodes experienced by a patient over a given period of time or increasing the time intervals between episodes. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof in the manufacture of a medicament adapted for administration to the nasal cavity, for prophylaxis of recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis or recurrent otitis media.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may suitably be administered to the patient at a daily dosage of from 1.0 to 50 mg/kg of body weight. For an adult human (of approximately 70 kg body weight), from 50 to 3000 mg, for example about 1500 mg, of a compound according to the invention may be administered daily. Suitably, the dosage for adult humans is from 5 to 20 mg/kg per day. Higher or lower dosages may, however, be used in accordance with normal clinical practice.<br>
To lessen the risk of encouraging the development of resistant organisms during prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis, it is preferred to administer the drug on an intermittent, rather than a continual, basis. In a suitable intermittent<br><br><br>
   treatment regimen for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent sinusitis, drug substance is administered on a daily basis, for a small number of days, for instance from 2 to 10, suitably 3 to 8, more suitably about 5 days, the administration then being repeated after an interval, for instance, on a monthly basis over a period of months, for instance up to six months. Less preferably, the drug substance may be administered on a continuing, daily basis, over a prolonged period, for instance several months. Suitably, for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media or recurrent sinusitis, drug substance is administered once or twice a day. Suitably, drug substance is administered during the winter months when bacterial infections such as recurrent otitis media and recurrent sinusitis tend to be more prevalent. The drug substance may be administered at a dosage of from 0.05 to l.OOmg, typically about 0.1 to 0.2mg, in each nostril, once or twice a day.<br>
More generally, the compounds and compositions according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other antibiotics.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative or solvate thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The compounds and compositions according to the invention may be formulated for administration by any route, for example oral, topical or parenteral. The compositions may, for example, be made up in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, creams, syrups, sprays or liquid preparations, for example solutions or suspensions, which may be formulated for oral use or in sterile form for parenteral administration by injection or infusion.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dosage form, and may contain conventional excipients including, for example, binding agents, for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example potato starch; and pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents, for example sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives, including, for example, suspending agents, for example sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, oily esters (for example glycerine), propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and, if desired, conventional flavouring and colour agents.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for topical administration may, for example, be in the form of ointments, creams, lotions, eye ointments, eye drops, ear drops, nose drops, nasal sprays, impregnated dressings, and aerosols, and may contain appropriate<br><br><br>
conventional additives, including, for example, preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration, and emollients in ointments and creams. Such topical formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, for example cream or ointment bases, ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions and aqueous bases for sprays. Such carriers may constitute from about 1% to about 98% by weight of the formulation; more usually they will constitute up to about 80% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for topical administration, in addition to the above, may also contain a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent; for example, betamethasone.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may be formulated as suppositories, which may contain conventional suppository bases, for example cocoa-butter or other glycerides.<br>
Compositions according to the invention intended for parenteral administration may conveniently be in fluid unit dosage forms, which may be prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, may be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound may be dissolved in water for injection and filter-sterilised before being filled into a suitable vial or ampoule, which is then sealed. Advantageously, conventional additives including, for example, local anaesthetics, preservatives, and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. In order to enhance the stability of the solution, the composition may be frozen after being filled into the vial, and the water removed under vacuum; the resulting dry lyophilised powder may then be sealed in the vial and a accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions may be prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound may instead be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before being suspended in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in such suspensions in order to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
A compound or composition according to the invention is suitably administered to the patient in an antimicrobially effective amount.<br>
A composition according to the invention may suitably contain from 0.001% by weight, preferably (for other than spray compositions) from 10 to 60% by weight, of a compound according to the invention (based on the total weight of the composition), depending on the method of administration.<br>
When the compositions according to the invention are presented in unit dosage form, for instance as a tablet, each unit dose may suitably comprise from 25 to 1000 mg, preferable from 50 to 500 mg, of a compound according to the invention.<br>
Representative compositions of the present invention include those adapted for intranasal administration, in particular, those that will reach into the nasopharynx. Such compositions are preferably adapted for focussed delivery to, and residence within, the nasopharynx. The term 'focussed delivery' is used to mean that the composition is delivered to the nasopharynx, rather than remaining within the nares. The term 'residence' within the nasopharynx is used to mean that the composition, once delivered to the nasopharynx, remains within the nasopharynx over a course of several hours, rather than being washed<br><br>
away more or less immediately. Preferred compositions include spray compositions and creams. Representative spray compositions include aqueous compositions, as well as oily compositions that contain amphiphilic agents so that the composition increases in viscosity when in contact with moisture. Creams may also be used, especially creams having a rheology that allows the cream to spread readily in the nasopharynx.<br>
Preferred aqueous spray compositions include, in addition to water, further excipients including a tonicity modifier such as a salt, for instance sodium chloride; preservative, such as benzalkonium salt; a surfactant such as a non-ionic surfactant, for instance a polysorbate; and buffer, such as sodium dihydrogen phosphate; present in low levels, typically less than 1%.<br>
The pH of the composition may also be adjusted, for optimum stability of the drug substance during storage. For compounds of the present invention, a pH in the range 5 to 6, preferably about 5.3 to 5.8, typically about 5.5 is optimal.<br>
Representative oily spray and cream compositions are described in WO 99/07341 and WO 99/12520 (SmithKline Beecham). Representative aqueous sprays have previously been described in WO 99/21855 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
Suitably, the drug substance is present in compositions for nasal delivery in between 0.001 and 5%, preferably 0.005 and 3%, by weight of the composition. Suitable amounts include 0.5% and 1% by weight of the composition (for oily compositions and creams) and from 0.01 to 0.2% (aqueous compositions).<br>
Spray compositions according to the present invention may be delivered to the nasal cavity by spray devices well known in the art for nasal sprays, for instance an air lift pump. Preferred devices include those that are metered to provide a unit volume of composition, preferably about 100µl, and optionally adapted for nasal administration by addition of a modified nozzle.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br><br>
