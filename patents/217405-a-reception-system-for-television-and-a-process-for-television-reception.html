				<td>The invention relates to a reception system for television comprising at<br>
least two tuners each furnished with at least one input and one output, a first RF<br>
low signal noise converter linked at least to the first input of the first tuner,<br>
optionally at least one second RF low signal noise converter, and means for<br>
switching the input of the second tuner by choice over to the second converter<br>
or over to the first converter.<br>
Such a system is generally used for the reception of television programs<br>
broadcast by satellite.<br>
In the case of satellite television, the converters are generally called<br>
"LNBs", the abbreviation standing for "Low Noise Block"; when the system<br>
comprises two converters, they are generally each placed at the center of a<br>
satellite antenna and thus there are two antennas; however, they may<br>
sometimes be placed at the center of the same satellite antenna, according to a<br>
so-called "twin LNB" configuration.<br>
The document EP 0314931 (BRIONVEGA) describes a system comprising<br>
a plurality of converters and antennas, a single tuner ("satellite receiver"<br>
referenced 21), and means (referenced 29) for switching the input of this tuner<br>
by choice over to one or other of the plurality of converters (referenced 4, 7).<br>
In the case of a system utilizing two converters and two tuners, the<br>
simplest configuration consists in connecting a converter to the first tuner and<br>
the other to the second tuner; according to a more complex configuration, the<br>
first converter provides a signal to be split on the one hand permanently to the<br>
first tuner and on the other hand optionally to the second tuner, according to the<br>
position of these switching means; such a system then generally comprises:<br>
- switching means exhibiting two possible positions, one for switching the<br>
input of the second tuner over to the second converter as in the simplest<br>
configuration, the other for switching the input of the second tuner over to the<br>
first converter,<br>
- splitting means (the so-called "splitter") for splitting the signal delivered<br>
by the first converter to two outputs, one of which is permanently linked to the<br>
input of the first tuner, and the other of which is linked to the switching means;<br>
these splitting means are generally incorporated into the first tuner, so that this<br><br>
tuner then exhibits, in addition to the input for gathering the signal from the first<br>
converter, an output for duplicating this signal to another tuner.<br>
A two-tuner system as described above may have the following<br>
applications:<br>
it allows the viewer to watch a television program picked up by the first<br>
converter and the first tuner, while recording another television program<br>
processed by the second tuner; such an application is described in<br>
particular in patent application EP300193 - THOMSON,<br>
it allows the viewer to watch a main image of a television program and to<br>
inlay a secondary image of another television program into this image;<br>
such an application is described in particular in patent application<br>
US5557338-THOMSON.<br>
By virtue of the switching means of the system described hereinabove, the<br>
system can therefore be used, as described hereinabove, to receive two<br>
television programs simultaneously, whether these programs originate from two<br>
different transmitting sources via the two converters of the system, or whether<br>
these programs originate from the same transmitting source via just the first<br>
converter of the system:<br>
 in the first case of different sources, the switching means are actuated in<br>
such a way that the input of the second tuner is linked to the second<br>
converter,<br>
in the second case where the source is identical, the switching means<br>
are actuated in such a way that the input of the second tuner is linked to<br>
the first converter via splitting means as described hereinabove.<br>
For applications of this type, it is then necessary to actuate the system<br>
switching means, depending on whether the two programs originate from the<br>
same source or from different sources.<br>
To actuate the switching means, one merely needs to change the<br>
arrangements for piugging in the input of the second tuner.<br>
To avoid this manual operation, it is also possible to provide switching<br>
means which can be actuated remotely, for example with the aid of a remote<br>
control; such switching means are described (and referenced 29) in the<br><br>
document EP 0314931 already cited and are actuated remotely by the keypad<br>
(referenced 23) of a remote control (see column 5, lines 3 to 6).<br>
The intervention of an operator for the actuation of the switching means<br>
has drawbacks, related for example to the risk of a keying error or to the need,<br>
for the operator, to know whether the two programs are or are not broadcast by<br>
the same source.<br>
The aim of the invention is to avoid these drawbacks.<br>
Document US 6009304 describes a system comprising two RF low signal<br>
noise converters suitable for delivering by choice a left polarized signal ("L")<br>
and/or a right polarized signal ("R"); each converter comprises a low noise<br>
amplifier ("LNA"), a bandpass filter ("BPF"), a mixer ("MIX") for converting the<br>
incoming signal into an intermediate frequency signal, and an intermediate<br>
frequency amplifier ("IF Amp"); between the mixer ("MIX") and the amplifier ("IF<br>
Amp"), the system comprises means ("S.W.") for switching the input of each<br>
amplifier ("IF Amp") by choice over to the output of the mixer of the first<br>
converter or/and over to the output of the mixer of the second converter; the<br>
system comprises means for driving the switching means as a function of the<br>
value of the voltages applied to the output of the converter (see claim 3 +<br>
column 1, lines 40 to 60); unlike in the case of the reception systems described<br>
above, the state of the switching means is, at this juncture, independent of the<br>
state, in service or otherwise, of the converters; the system finally comprises<br>
means suitable for putting one or other of the converters out of service by<br>
removing the power supply to its intermediate frequency amplifier ("IF Amp"),<br>
when it is detected that the output of this amplifier is not loaded (claim 1); the<br>
output of an amplifier is considered not to be loaded when a voltage of 0 V or<br>
less than the voltage for driving the switching means is measured (column 5,<br>
lines 29 to 35).<br>
According to this document, the same means of detection serve to drive<br>
switching means and means for placing out of service; the detection means are<br>
not suitable for detecting whether one or other of the converters is in service;<br>
thus, this document does not teach any solution of a kind as to avoid the<br>
aforesaid drawbacks.<br><br>
To avoid the aforesaid drawbacks, the subject of the invention is a<br>
reception system for television comprising a plurality of tuners each furnished<br>
with at least one input and one output, at least one RF low signal noise<br>
converter linked to an input of a tuner of said plurality, optionally at least one<br>
other RF low signal noise converter, and means for switching the input of at<br>
least one other tuner of said plurality by choice over to a converter which is not<br>
yet linked to a tuner of said plurality or over to a converter already linked to a<br>
tuner, characterized in that it comprises means for detecting whether the<br>
converter not yet linked is in service or is not in service, and means suitable for<br>
actuating said switching means in such a way as to link said input of this tuner<br>
to the not yet linked converter when said detection means detect that the latter<br>
is in service and to link said input of this tuner to the converter already linked to<br>
another tuner when said detection means detect that the" converter not yet<br>
linked is not in service.<br>
Other advantageous characteristics of the system according to the<br>
invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br>
The subject of the invention is in particular a reception system for<br>
television comprising at least two tuners each furnished with at least one input<br>
and one output, a first RF low signal noise converter linked at least to the first<br>
input of the first tuner, optionally at least one second RF low signal noise<br>
converter, and means for switching the input of the second tuner by choice over<br>
to the second converter or over to the first converter characterized in that it<br>
comprises means for detecting whether the second converter is in service or is<br>
not in service, and means suitable for actuating said switching means in such a<br>
way as to link the input of the second tuner over to the second converter when<br>
one detects that the latter is in service and to link the input of the second tuner<br>
over to the first converter when one detects that this second converter is not in<br>
service.<br>
The invention may also exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:<br>
- the second converter being supplied with current when it is in service, the<br>
means for detecting whether the second converter is in service or is not in<br>
service rely on the detection of the current on the suppiy circuit of this second<br>
converter,<br><br>
- the system also comprises a programmable microcontroller suitable for<br>
controlling the switching means incorporating software means adapted in such<br>
a way that the input of the second tuner is connected:<br>
? to the second converter if the value of said current exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold,<br>
? to the first converter if the value of said current is less than or equal to<br>
said threshold.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a process for television reception with<br>
the aid of at least two tuners each connectable to corresponding means of<br>
reception, which may be placed in service or out of service independently of<br>
one another, characterized in that it comprises the steps consisting in, for at<br>
least one of the tuners,<br>
detecting whether the means of reception corresponding to said tuner<br>
are in service, and,<br>
in the case where one detects that said means are in service,<br>
connecting said tuner to these means,<br>
in the case where one detects that said means are not in service,<br>
connecting said tuner to other means already connected to another<br>
true.<br>
The invention may also exhibit the characteristic according to which, each<br>
of the means of detection requiring, when they are in service, a power supply<br>
producing a current greater than a predetermined threshold vaiue, one detects<br>
whether the means of reception are in service by comparing the value of current<br>
produced by said power supply with said threshold value.<br>
The invention will be better understood on reading the following<br>
description, given by way of non-limiting example, and with reference to the<br>
appended figures in which:<br>
- figure 1 illustrates a reception system for television according to a first<br>
embodiment of the invention,<br><br>
- figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of software means able to drive the<br>
switching means of the system according to the invention as described in<br>
figure 1,<br>
- figure 3 illustrates a reception system for television according to a second<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to figure 1, the reception system for television comprises a first<br>
satellite antenna furnished with a first low noise converter 1, optionally a second<br>
satellite antenna furnished with a second low noise converter 1 and a box 10.<br>
The box 10 itself comprises:<br>
a first tuner 2 furnished with a so-called "demodulated" output and with<br>
an input 3 connected to the converter 1 via a socket 5 of the box; this<br><br>
first tuner here incorporates meansl (SP) for splitting the<br>
input signal both toward the demodulation processing circuits specific to<br>
this tuner and toward a so-called "duplication" output 4,<br>
a second tuner 2" furnished with an input 3" and with a so-called<br>
"demodulated" output,<br>
means 6 for switching the input 3" of the second tuner 2" by choice over<br>
to the second converter 1" via another socket 5" of the box or over to the<br><br>
output 4 of the splitting means incorporated into the first tuner,<br>
means 7 of decoding the signals delivered by the tuners 2 and 2", driven<br>
by a microcontroller 8; these decoding means, known per se, will not be<br>
described in greater detail; they are conventionally furnished with inputs<br>
9 and 9" each linked to the so-called "demodulated" output of the tuners<br>
2, 21; they are also furnished with outputs (not represented) linked for<br>
example to display means and/or to recording means,<br>
means 12 of control of the converter 1 which is plugged into the socket 5<br>
of the box and means 12" of control of the converter 1" which is plugged<br>
optionally into the other socket 5" of the box; these means of control<br>
have two main functions:<br>
o to supply power to each of the converters 1,1",<br>
o to determine, by way of the supply voltage level, the direction of<br>
polarization, right "R" or left "L", of the television signal to be received<br><br>
by the converter; such a function is described in detail in the<br>
document US 6009304 already cited (see in particular column 1);<br>
These means of control 12, 12" are suitable for injecting the supply<br>
voltage for driving each converter 1,1" between the socket of the box 5,<br>
5" of this converter and, as the case may be, the switching means 6; thus<br>
plugged in upstream of the switching means 6, they are capable of<br>
powering this converter regardless of the state of these switching means.<br>
As illustrated in figure 1, these means of control 12, 12" may be driven by<br>
the microcontroller 8.<br>
The radiofrequency signals from each converter 1,1" are superimposed<br>
on the supply voltage for driving this converter.<br>
According to the invention:<br>
the switching means 6 are controllable remotely by the microcontroller 8,<br>
the box 10 furthermore comprises means of current detection 11" which<br>
are disposed on the supply circuit of the second converter 1", here<br>
between the means of control 12" and the socket 5", and which are<br>
suitable for delivering, to the microcontroller 8, data relating to the value<br>
I" of this supply current,<br>
the microcontroller 8 incorporates software means for control of the<br>
switching means 6 adapted in such a way that the input 3" of the second<br>
tuner 2" is connected:<br>
? to the second converter 1" if the value of said current exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold,<br>
? to the output 4 of the splitting means incorporated into the first<br>
tuner 2, that is to say indirectly to the first converter 1 if the value<br>
of said current is less than or equal to said threshold.<br>
To implement the invention, these software means may for example be<br>
employed according to the logic chart of figure 2:<br>
- in the first step called "Power On", the microcontroller and the other<br>
components of the box 10 are powered up conventionally, and the means of<br>
control 12 of the converter 1 which is linked to the socket 5 are activated,<br><br>
- in the second step called "Init", and the state of the switching means 6 is<br>
initialized in such a way that the socket 5" of the box is connected to the input 3"<br>
of the second tuner 2",<br>
- in the third step called "Read", the means of control 12" of the converter<br>
1" which is optionally linked to the socket 5" are activated and the data<br>
transmitted by the means of current detection 11 are gathered,<br>
- in the fourth step called "compare", the value of current read I in the<br>
previous step is compared with a predetermined threshold value l0; for a<br>
conventional converter powered conventionally at 12.5 V or at 17 V depending<br>
on the polarity, vertical or horizontal, of the television signaTTo be received, the<br>
value of the supply current may reach the maximum value of around 350 mA;<br>
the predetermined threshold value is chosen for example to be around 10% of<br>
this maximum value, i.e. here lo = 35 mA approximately:<br>
o if I &gt; lo, then the fifth step consists in maintaining or in restoring the<br>
state of the switching means 6 in such a way that the socket 5" of the<br>
box is connected to the input 3" of the tuner 2";<br>
o if I 
switching means 6 in such a way that the output 4 of the splitting<br>
means incorporated into the first tuner 1 is connected to the input 3" of<br>
the second tuner 2"; preferably, in this case, the means of control 12"<br>
are deactivated so as to limit energy consumption and to avoid any risk<br>
of short-circuiting at the level of the socket 5";<br>
- on completion of the fifth step, we loop back to the third step described<br>
above called "Read"; the looping rate can be adjusted in a manner known per<br>
se as a function of the desired rate of updating of the state of the switching<br>
means 6.<br>
Thus, by virtue of the invention, the tuner 2" is:<br>
either linked to the second converter 1" when one detects a supply<br>
current to this converter via the socket 5", that is to say when the second<br>
converter 1" is in service, that is to say is plugged into the socket 5" of<br>
the box 10,<br>
or linked to the first converter 1 via the tuner 2, when one does not<br>
detect any supply current via the socket 5", that is to say when the<br><br>
second converter 1" is not in service, that is to say is not plugged into<br>
this socket of the box 10.<br>
Thus, by virtue of the invention, the two tuners are always operational and<br>
connected to a source without any intervention from the viewer being necessary<br>
any longer, whether just one or two sources are connected to the box 10; when<br>
just one source is connected via the socket 5, the two tuners are linked to this<br>
single source; when two sources are connected, each tuner is linked to a<br>
source.<br>
According to a variant relating to the components of the box 10, the means<br>
for splitting the signal delivered by the first converter are external to the tuner 1;<br>
such means are called splitters.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention described in figure 3,<br>
where the system again comprises two tuners 2 and 2" here each furnished with<br>
a so-called "duplication" output 4, 4", in addition to the elements described<br>
hereinabove, the system comprises:<br>
switching means 6" which make it possible to connect the input 3 of the<br>
first tuner 2 by choice to the first converter 1 via the socket 5 or to the<br>
second converter 1" via the socket 5"; the means of controi 12 of the<br>
converter 1 are plugged in upstream of the switching means 6" so as to<br>
be able to power this converter regardless of the state of these switching<br>
means.<br>
means of detection of current on the supply circuit of the first<br>
converter 1, which are positioned between the means of control 12 and<br>
the socket 5 of the box 10, and are suitable for delivering, to the<br>
microcontroller 8, data relating to the value I" of said current,<br>
the microcontroller 8 incorporates software means for control of the<br>
switching means 6" adapted in such a way that the input 3 of the first<br>
tuner 2 is connected:<br>
to the first converter 1 if the value of said current I" exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold,<br><br>
to the output 4" of splitting means incorporated into the second<br>
tuner 2", that is to say indirectly to the second converter V, if the<br>
value of said current is less than or equal to said threshold.<br>
The advantage of this variant is that, the system being perfectly<br>
symmetrical, when a single source or a single converter is connected to the<br>
box, one obtains the advantages of the invention regardless of which socket 5,<br>
5" this converter is connected to.<br>
The invention applies also to television reception systems comprising<br>
more than two tuners, for example n tuners; the box then comprises n input<br>
sockets connectable to an antenna, more precisely to a converter (since there<br>
may be several converters for the same antenna); inside the box, suitable<br>
switching means make it possible to link by choice at least one of the tuners, or<br>
even each tuner, either to the socket corresponding thereto when the latter is<br>
connected to a converter and when this converter is in service, or, in the<br>
converse case, to another socket corresponding to another tuner from the<br>
moment that this socket is itself connected to an in-service converter, so that,<br>
by virtue of the invention, all the tuners of the box are connected permanently to<br>
in-service converters and can be used simultaneously for displaying or<br>
recording different television programs.<br>
Thus, regardless of the number of antennas in the reception system - this<br>
number being less than or equal to the number of tuners - the system according<br>
to the invention makes it possible to automatically connect each of the tuners to<br>
at least one antenna, without requiring the intervention of an operator, without<br>
any risk of error of connection, and without needing to know whether various<br>
programs are or are not broadcast by the same source.<br>
In the description hereinbelow, the detection of the placing in service or<br>
otherwise of a converter relies on the measurement of current, upstream of the<br>
means of control 12. 12", in the radiofrequency line linking the socket 5. 5"<br><br>
capable of being connected to this converter to the switching means 6,6"<br>
without departing from the invention, this same measurement of current can be<br>
incorporated into the means of control 12, 12" themselves.<br><br>
Finally, without departing from the invention, means other than the<br>
measurement of current produced by the power supply to the converters may<br>
be used to detect whether a converter not yet linked is or is not in service.<br><br>

the detection of a current on the supply circuit of this converter (1").<br>
3.- The system as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that it comprises a<br>
programmable microcontroller (8) suitable for controlling the switching means<br>
(6) incorporating software means adapted in such a way that the input (3") of the<br>
second tuner (2") is connected:<br>
? to the not yet linked converter (V) if the value of said detected current<br>
exceeds a predetermined threshold,<br>
? to the already linked converter (1) if the value of said detected current<br>
is less than or equal to said threshold.<br>
4. A process for television reception with the aid of at least two tuners<br>
each connectable to corresponding means of reception, which may be placed in<br><br>
service or out of service independently of one another, characterized in that it<br>
comprises the steps consisting in, for at least one of the tuners,<br>
detecting whether the means of reception corresponding to said tuner<br>
are in service, and,<br>
in the case where one detects that said means of reception are in<br>
service, connecting said tuner to these means of reception,<br>
in the case where one detects that said means of reception are not in<br>
service, connecting said tuner to other means of reception already<br>
connected to another tuner.<br>
5. The process for television reception as claimed in claim 4,<br>
characterized in that, each of the means of detection requiring, when they are in<br>
service, a power supply producing a current greater than a predetermined<br>
threshold value, characterized in that one detects whether the means of<br>
reception are in service by comparing the value of current produced by said<br>
power supply with said threshold value.<br>
The invention concerns a system comprising a first converter (1) connected<br>
to a first tuner (2) and optionally, to a second tuner (2") via switching means<br>
(6), optionally a second converter (1") connected to the second tuner (2"),<br>
means (11) for detecting whether the second converter (1") is operating and<br>
means for actuating the switching means (6) so as to connect the second<br>
tuner (2") to the second converter (1") when it is detected that the latter is<br>
operating and, otherwise, to connect it to the first converter (1). The<br>
invention is useful for automatically connecting each of the tuners to at<br>
least an antenna.</td>
