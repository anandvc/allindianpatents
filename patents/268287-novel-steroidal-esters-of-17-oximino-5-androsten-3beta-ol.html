				<td>Novel steroidal esters of 17-oximino-5-androsten-3β-ol<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel steroidal esters of 17-oximino-5-androsten-3ßol The present invention particularly relates to steroidal esters of compound of formula A wherein R is selected form a group consisting of alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl<br>
Formula A (Formula Removed) <br>
The compounds are useful as 5α-reductase inhibitor and androgen dependent<br>
disorders for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia Background of the invention<br>
Hyperplasia is a general medical term referring to excess cell proliferation and benign prostatic hyperplasia is non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland caused by increase in the number of stromal and epithelial cells resulting in obstruction of the proximal urethera, thus causes urinary flow disturbances [Roehrborn, C G BJU Int 2006, 97, 7,Emberton, M BJU Int 2006, 97, 12 and Fitzpatnck, J M BJU Int 2006, 97, 3 ,] It is leading disorder of the elderly male population and prevalence increases with age affecting around 80% by the age of 80 years Nearly all men will develop microscopic BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) by the age of 90 [Berry, S J et al, Br J Urol, 1995, 5, 85]<br>
Number of different causes for the overgrowth includes age, late activation of cell growth, abnormal increase in the clonal expansion of transit cell and change in ratios of androgen-estrogen level, which promote growth of prostatic tissue [Theomher, M et al Prostate,1996, 28, 392 and Jenkins,E P et al J Clin Invest ,1992, 89, 293 ] But the most widely accepted hypothesis is the dihydrotestosterone hypothesis which postulates that<br>
BPH occurs following an age related changes in the prostate androgen metabolism which favours accumulation of dihydrotestosterone<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
FIGURE 1<br>
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent circulating androgen hormone, is produced by NADPH dependent stereoselective reduction of testosterone (T), under catalysis of the enzyme steroid 5α-reductase (5AR) [Hitoshi, T et al Chem Pharm Bull 2000, 48, 552] Within prostate dihydrotestosterone binds to cytosol androgen receptor protein (AR) and DHT-AR complex enters the nucleus, interacts with DNA binding sites where it stimulates the RNA synthesis (Figure 1)[ Liao, S Int Rev Cytol 1975, 41, 87] The concentration of dihydrotestosterone is 2 5 fold higher than in normal prostate<br>
Therefore, inhibition of androgen action by 5α-reductase is a logical treatment of 5α-reductase activity disorder l e benign prostatic hyperplasia<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
 (FIGURE 2)<br>
Androgen suppression causes reduction in prostatic volume which is believed to decrease the static component of bladder outlet obstruction resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia (Figure 2) [Reid, P et al J Clin Invest New Drugs 1999, 17, 271] With the discovery of two 5a-reductase isozymes, their physiological and pharmacological roles in BPH, a significant research has been carried out to synthesize and evaluate nonsteroidal [Marisa, C et al Chem Pharm Bull 2001, 49, 525 , Frye, J Med Chem,1994, 37, 2352] and steroidal compounds [Leny, MA et al J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,1994, 48, 197 , Toshiaki, K et al, Chem Pharm Bull, 1996,44 ,115] as competitive [4-azasteroids, 6-azasteroids ] or non-competitive [3-carboxysteroids ] inhibitors of 5a-reductase Of these, only Finasteride (3) (MK-906) [Foley, C L et al Drugs of Today 2004, 40, 213 ], and Dutastende (4) [Susumu, T , et al Chem Pharm Bull, 2000, 4#,1689] are being used clinically in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
It has been reported that various steroidal compounds possess high affinity for 5a-reductase inhibitors on account of their ability to form a coordinate bond with iron heame [Hartmann, R W et al, J J Med Chem 2000, 43, 4266] On other hand, progesterone esters (5,6) synthesised by Mexico laboratory exhibited high antiandrogemc activity [Cabeza, M et al, Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo) 1999, 47, 1232 and Cabeza, M et al Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo) 2001, 49, 1081<br><br>
On long term usage of Finasteride and Dutastende the most common reported side effect include decreased libido, decreased ejaculate amount and erectile dysfunction Whereas progesterone esters have been found to possess good antiandrogemc activity but are still under clinical investigation<br>
Based on these observations, it was envisaged to synthesize 17-oximmo-5-<br>
androsten-3β-yl esters (10-16)   Benign prostatic hyperplasia is also described by<br>
abnormal increase in the number of cells in prostate which may result not only from<br>
increased cell proliferation but also from decreased level in programmed cell death<br>
(apoptosis) These analogues were evaluated for 5α-reductase inhibitory activity and<br>
antiproliferative activity   These compounds may be useful in androgen dependent<br>
benign prostatic hyperplasia, by acting not only at the molecular level for the<br>
underlying cause of the disease but also decreasing the growth of prostate by killing cells<br>

Biological Evaluation<br>
The synthesized steroidal derivatives have been evaluated for in vitro antiproliferative<br>
activity using DU-145 cell lines and in vivo studies 1 e 5α-Reductase Inhibitory activity [George, F W et al Endocrinology, 1989,125, 2434]<br>
1) In vitro antiproliferative activity against human prostate cancer cell line (DU-145)<br>
Compounds were screened for antiproliferative activity on human prostate cell<br>
line DU-145 at National Centre of Human Genome Studies and Research  Panjab<br>
University, Chandigarh All the compounds (10 to 16), Finasteride and starting material (9) were tested at five different concentrations 0 01, 0 5, 1 0, 2 0, and 5 0 µg/ml Finasteride was the positive control in this growth inhibitory assay<br>
Growth inhibitory activity assay (MTT assay)<br>
We investigated the effect of newly synthesized compounds on cell growth inhibition using MTT assay This assay quantifies the viable cells by observing the reduction of tetrazohum salt, MTT to formazan crystals by the live cells Based on the absorbance of the cell sample after the test is carried out, cell viable can be measured [Loveland, B E , Jones, T G , Mackay I R „ Vaillant, F , Wang, Z X , Hertzog, P J Bwchem International 1992, 27, 501 and Wright, S A , Thomas, L N , Douglas, R C , Lazier, C B , Rittmaster, R S J Chn Invest 1996, 98, 2558] Cells were cultured at a density of 5 x 103 cells / well in 96 well plates at 37°C in 5 0% CO2 atmosphere and were allowed to attach for 24 hr The cells were treated in triplicate with graded concentration of sample and reference drug Finasteride at 37°C for 48 hr A 20 µl aliquot of MTT solution was added directly to all the appropriate wells Following 4 hr of incubation at 37µl, the media was removed and formazan crystals, which results<br>
from the reduction of MTT by active cell were dissolved in 100µl DMSO and vigorously mixed to dissolve the reacted dye The absorbance of each well was read on Ehsa plate reader (Merck) at 570 nm The spectrometer was calibrated to zero absorbance using culture medium without cells The relative cell viability (%) related to control well containing cell culture medium without drug was calculated by [A] test/[A] control x 100<br>
% Growth Inhibition^ [OD] control - [OD] test/ [OD] control X 100<br>
Results*<br>
All the newly synthesized compounds were tested for antiproliferative<br>
activity using DU-145 cell line The results are expressed in terms of percentage growth inhibition (Table 1) and percentage viable cells (Figure 5)<br>
Esters of 17-oximino-5-androsten3ß-ol (10-16) , synthesized in our lab revealed a great reduction in the level of cellular cytotoxicity as compared to Finasteride (3) Examination of data of these analogues 10 to 16 demonstrated a great tolerance of phenyl ring and its parα-substituted analogues  Unsubstituted analogue 13 and parα-<br>
substituted (electron donating group) compounds 12, 14 and 15 were found to be the most active compounds with &gt;90% growth inhibition at concentration of 5 0 ug/ml relative to Finasteride (78% at 5 0 µg/ml) (Table 1) On the other hand analogues 10, 11 with electron withdrawing substituent decreased the growth of DU-145 cancer cell lines from 81-84%(relatively less), but still better than Finasteride (78%) Parent Compound 9 has not shown any significant inhibitory effect on cell proliferation<br>

Number of ester derivatives bearing oxime group (NOH) at C-17, connected directly to the steroidal D ring were synthesized and screened in vitro (Table 1 and Figure 5) Examination of data of these analogues 10 to 16 demonstrated a great tolerance of phenyl ring and its parα-substituted analogues This is in agreement with the previous reports that have pointed out the importance of aromatic and β-substituted aromatic esters Unsubstituted analogue 13 and compounds 12, 14 and 15 with an electron donating moiety at para position have been found to be more potent than the reference Finasteride Compounds 12, 14 and 15 were found to be the most active with &gt;90% growth inhibition at concentration of 5 0 µg/ml relative to Finasteride (78% at 5 0 µg/ml) On the other hand analogues 10, 11 with electron withdrawing substituents<br>
demonstrated relatively less activity than above compounds but still better than Finasteride Parent Compound 9 has not shown significant antiproliferative activity<br>
b) In vivo (effect on steroid androgen level)<br>
Treatment of animals<br>
Animals (Sprague Dawley male rats weighing 150-200 g) were divided into 3 groups, vehicle (control), Finasteride (standard), treated (test sample) and each group consist of 5 animals Sprague Dawley rats were treated intraperitoneally with Finasteride 40 mg/kg and equimolar dose of compounds After 6 hr of treatment, blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture under diethyl ether anesthesia and serum was separated from cells by centnfugation Plasma testosterone values were obtained by ELSIA plate reader at 550 nm and are given in ng/ml Ehsa<br>
The aliquots of 50ul of each of standards, control and unknown (serum samples) were added to Testosterone Antibody coated wells 100µl of HRP-testosterone conjugate was added to all the wells and the plates were shaken gently on a shaker for proper mixing of the reagents Following 4 hr of incubation at 37°C, the incubation mixture was removed The wells were washed with phosphate buffer for 5-6 times (200µl each time), followed by addition of 100ul of TMB / H2O2 substrate in each of the wells The plates were further incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes At the end of incubation reaction was stopped by using 100ul of 0 5 M H2SO4 as stopping reagent The absorbance of each well was read on Ehsa plate reader at 450 nm [Rassaie, M J , Kuman, G L , Pandey, P K , Gupta, N , Kochupillai, N , Grover, P K Steroids 1992, 57, 288 and Hosoda, H , Yoshida H, Sakai, Y , Miyam, S , Nambara, T Chem Pharm Bull 1980, 28, 3035] Results<br>
The effect of compounds (10 to 16) and Finasteride on the serum concentration of testosterone are reported in Table 2 and Figure 6<br>
Serum 'T' level were increased in Finasteride treated rats (1 26±0 02 ng/ml compared with 0 742±0 07 ng/ml control rats) It is apparent from Table 2 and Figure 6 that almost all the ester derivatives of 17-oximino-5-androsten-3ß-ol were able to increase the serum testosterone level as compared to control except compound 15 The 6 hr post dose serum T levels were 1 05±0 08 ng/ml for the compound 13 with<br>
unsubstituted phenyl group Ester derivatives 12 and 14 with electron releasing group at β-position of phenyl ring has been found to have  increased activity, while presence of electron withdrawing moiety at this position causes the loss of activity (10, 11) Significant increase in level of serum testosterone level    has been found in the compound 16<br>
Table 2 Serum levels of Testosterone (Table Removed) <br><br>
Intact male rats (Sprague Dawley, 200-250 g) were used in the designed study in which various compounds were compared for in vivo 5α-reductase inhibitory potency, as judged by the their ability to attenuate the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ELISA for testosterone were found to be suitable for determination in serum of rate since the cross reactive DHT levels were extra low in male The procedure measure T equally well, and method met all the requirement of precision, accuracy, sensitivity and selectivity<br>
c) In vitro cytotoxicity using mouse macrophages (acute toxicity)<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity test using DU-145 cells in the preliminary evaluation of anticancer drug enable us to select most potent compound, but cytotoxic agents however frequently exhibit-unspecific toxicity Nevertheless the ability to selectively kill the target cell remains a highly desirable property of potential new therapeutic cytotoxic agents In this study, we have demonstrated the applicability of Red dye uptake (MTT) assay using mouse macrophages (Balb C) for in vitro toxicity testing of newly synthesized compounds<br>
