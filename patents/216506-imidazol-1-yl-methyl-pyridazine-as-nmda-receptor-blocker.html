The compounds of formula I and their salts are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties. Compounds of the present invention are NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor subtype selective blockers, which have a key function in modulating<br><br>
neuronal activity and plasticity which makes them key players in mediating processes underlying development of CNS as well as learning and memory formation.<br>
Under pathological conditions of acute and chronic forms of neurodegeneration overactivation of NMDA receptors is a key event for triggering neuronal cell death. NMDA receptors are composed of members from two subunit families, namely NR-1 (8 different splice variants) and NR-2 (A to D) originating from different genes. Members from the two subunit families show a distinct distribution in different brain areas. Heteromeric combinations of NR-I members with different NR-2 subunits result in NMDA receptors displaying different pharmaceutical properties. Possible therapeutic indications for NMDA NR-2B receptor subtype specific blockers include acute forms of neurodegeneration caused, e.g., by stroke and brain trauma, and chronic forms of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and neurodegeneration associated with bacterial or viral infections, and, in addition, depression and chronic and acute pain.<br>
Furthermore, EP 1254661 describes a method for preventing dyskinesias with selective NMDA antagonists and WO 02S5352 discloses the usefulness of NMDA modulators for the treatment of addictive illnesses, such as smoking cessation.<br>
Most important indications are Parkinson"s disease, (neuropatic) pain and stroke.<br>

The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Test method -H-Ro25-69.S] binding (Ro 25-6981 is | R-(R*,S*)]-a-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-p-methyl-4-(phenyl-methyl)-l-piperidine propanol)<br>
Male Fiillinsdorf albino rats weighing between 150-200 g were used. Membranes were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain minus cerebellum and medulla oblongata with a Polytron (10.000 rpm, 30 seconds), in 25 volumes of a cold Tris-HCl 50 mM, EDTA 10 niM, pH 7.1 buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 g for 10 minutes at<br>
4 °C. The pellet was resuspended using the Polytron in the same volume of buffer and the homogenate was incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. After centrifugation the pellet was homogenized in the same buffer and frozen at -80 °C for at least 16 hours but not more than 10 days. For the binding assay the homogenate was thawed at 37 °C, centrifuged and the pellet was washed three times as above in a Tris-HCl 5 mM, pH 7.4 cold buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and used at a final concentration of 200 mg of protein/ml.<br>
 H-Ro 25-6981 binding experiments were performed using a Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 7.4 buffer. For displacement experiments 5 nM of "H-Ro 25-69(SI were used and non specific binding was measured using 10 mM of tetrahydroisoquinoline and usually it accounts for 10% of the total. The incubation time was 2 hours at 4 °C and the assay was stopped by filtration on Whatmann GF/13 glass fiber filters (Unifilter-96, Packard, Zurich, Switzerland). The filters were washed 5 times with cold buffer. The radioactivity on the filter was counted on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter after addition of 40 ml of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S.A., Zurich, Switzerland).<br>
The effects of compounds were measured using a minimum of 8 concentrations and repeated at least once. The pooled normalized values were analyzed using a non-linear regression calculation program which provide ICjo with their relative upper and lower 95% confidence limits.<br><br>

The compounds of formula lA and IB and their salts, as herein described, can be incorporated into standard pharmaceutical dosage forms, for example, for oral or parenteral application with the usual pharmaceutical adjuvant materials, for example, organic or inorganic inert carrier materials, such as, water, gelatin, lactose, starch.<br><br>
magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, gums, polyalkylene-glycols and the like. The pharmaceutical preparations can be employed in a solid form, for example, as tablets, suppositories, capsules, or in liquid form, for example, as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Pharmaceutical adjuvant materials can be added and include preservatives stabilizers, wetting or emulsifying agent.s, salts to change the osmotic pressure or to act as buffers. The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain other therapeutically active substances.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage lies in the range of about 0.1 nig per dosage to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I although the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is shown to be indicated.<br>
