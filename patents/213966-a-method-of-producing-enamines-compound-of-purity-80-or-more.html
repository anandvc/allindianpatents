				<td>A process for producing highly pure enamines<br>
[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to a process by which highly pure enamines can be<br>
easily produced.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Enamine is a general term for aß-unsaturated amines, which are extremely useful<br>
compounds in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Enamines are generally<br>
synthesized by a dehydrative condensation reaction between an aldehyde or ketone<br>
and a secondary amine. In the synthesis of enamines, the dehydrative condensation<br>
reaction has been well known to proceed more smoothly when one equivalent of an<br>
aldehyde or ketone is reacted with more than one equivalent of a secondary amine<br>
than when one equivalent of an aldehyde or ketone is reacted with one equivalent of a<br>
secondary amine. Accordingly, when the excess amount of the secondary amine is<br>
used in said synthetic reaction, the desired product, the enamine, and the secondary<br>
amine are included in the final product obtained after the reaction is completed.<br>
Enamines thus obtained can be used for other reactions without any purifications, but<br>
in some reactions, for example, such as a condensation reaction between an enamine<br>
and a halogenated alkyl compound, purification of the enamine is necessary because<br>
the secondary amine inhibits the reaction. As a procedure for the purification of<br>
enamines, fractional distillation is generally known, but especially in the production<br>
of a large amount of enamine, large scale fractional distillation equipment is required,<br>
and additionally, this purification procedure is generally accompanied by<br>
disadvantages such as the decomposition of the enamines in the course of the<br>
fractional distillation at a high temperature.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that enamines generally have poor stability against water<br>
[Barton S. D.; Ollis W. D. Comprehensive Organic Chemistry; Sutherland I.O. Ed.;<br>
Pergamon: New York, 1979; Vol. 2, Part 6], and studies on the rate (mechanism) of<br>
hydrolysis of various enamines have been reported [J. Org. Chem., 32, 1111 (1967); J.<br>
Org. Chem., vol. 40, No. 5, 607-614 (1975); J. Am. Chem. Soc, 82, 4261-4270<br>
(1970), etc.].<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
The present inventors have eagerly investigated methods of producing highly pure<br>
enamines and found that the enamines obtained using specific secondary amines are<br>
unexpectedly stable against water and, additionally, that the highly pure enamines can<br>
be easily obtained by a simple treatment using water (an acidic aqueous solution), to<br>
complete the present invention.<br>

[Mode for carrying out the invention]<br>
The reaction to produce the compound of the general formula (3) by reacting a<br>
compound of the general formula (1) with a compound of general formula (2) is<br>
performed according to commonly known methods to produce enamines [for example,<br>
USP 3,481,939; Can. J. Chem. Vol. 68, 127-152 (1990); J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans.<br>
1, 3389-3396 (2000); etc.].<br><method to remove excess amine compound of the general formula from></method>
reaction mixture&gt;<br>
When more than one equivalent of the compound of the general formula (2)<br>
shown above is reacted with one equivalent of the compound of general formula (1)<br>
shown above, the compound of general formula (3) shown above and the compound<br>
of general formula (2) are contained in the reaction mixture. The compound of<br>
general formula (2) remaining in the reaction mixture can be easily removed by a<br>
treatment with an acidic aqueous solution, that is, by adding an acidic aqueous<br>
solution to the reaction mixture, shaking or stirring it for from 5 minutes to 2 hours<br>
and, then, removing the aqueous layer.<br>
The acidic aqueous solution to be employed can be, for example, a dilute aqueous<br>
solution of mineral acid such as dilute sulfuric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute<br>
nitric acid, or an aqueous solution of organic acid such as an aqueous solution of<br>
acetic acid, and aqueous solutions of oxalic acid, carbonic acid, citric acid and<br>
phosphoric acid, and is preferably dilute sulfuric acid or an aqueous solution of acetic<br>
acid. Specifically, in the case of an aqueous solution of a mineral acid, 1 to 15<br>
w/v % (preferably 5 to 10 w/v %, and more preferably between 6 and 8 w/v %) of<br>
such a solution can be used, while in the case of an aqueous solution of an organic<br>
acid, 3 to 20 w/v % (preferably 5 to 15 w/v %, and more preferably 8 to 10 w/v %) of<br>
such an aqueous solution can be used. Generally, an acidic aqueous solution with a<br>
pH value of between 1 and 7 (preferably between 2 and 6) can be used.<br>
The addition of an acidic aqueous solution and shaking or stirring can be<br>
performed at 0°C to 30°C (preferably at 0°C to 15°C, and more preferably at 0°C to<br>
5°C).<br>
Furthermore, when the molecular weight of the enamine is large, some of them are<br>
in the form of solid or have a low fluidity at the treatment temperature mentioned<br>
above. In these cases, said treatment can be performed after the addition of a<br>
water-insoluble aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, benzene, toluene or hexane to the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
After the treatment of the reaction mixture with the acidic aqueous solution in the<br>
manner mentioned above, if necessary, it can be furthermore treated with a basic<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
The basic aqueous solution to be employed is not particularly restricted, provided<br>
that it does not decompose the produced enamines, and can be, for example, a dilute<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide such as a dilute aqueous solution of<br>
sodium hydroxide or a dilute aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide; a dilute<br>
aqueous solution of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide such as a dilute aqueous<br>
solution of calcium hydroxide; or an aqueous solution of a carbonate salt such as an<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate or an aqueous solution of calcium<br>
carbonate, and is preferably a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or a dilute<br>
aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. Specifically, 0.1 to 10 w/v % (preferably<br>
0.3 to 5 w/v %., and more preferably 0.5 to 3 w/v %) of such an aqueous solution can<br>
be used. Generally, a basic aqueous solution with a pH value of between 7 and 14<br>
(preferably between 13 and 14) can be used.<br>
The "treating with using a basic aqueous solution" means the addition of the basic<br>
aqueous solution and shaking or stirring of the resulting mixture for from 5 minutes to<br>
2 hours, and can be performed at 0°C to 30°C (preferably at 0°C to 15°C, and more<br>
preferably at 0°C to 5°C).<br>
Furthermore, when the molecular weight of the enamine is large, some of them are<br>
in the form of solid or have a low fluidity at the treatment temperature mentioned<br>
above. In these cases, said treatment can be performed after the addition of a<br>
water-insoluble aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, benzene, toluene or hexane to the<br>
reaction mixture.<br><method to remove the dehydrating agent from reaction mixture><br>
In the case that a compound of the general formula (1) shown above is reacted<br>
with a compound of the general formula (2) shown above in the presence of a<br>
dehydrating agent and the dehydrating agent is removed from the reaction mixure<br>
after the completion of the reaction, said dehydrating agent can be easily removed by<br>
treatment with water, that is, by adding sufficient water (or ice water) to dissolve the<br>
dehydrating agent, shaking or stirring it for from 5 minutes to 2 hours and, then,<br>
removing the aqueous layer.<br>
The dehydrating agent to be employed in this case is not particularly restricted,<br>
provided that it can generally be used as a dehydrating agent for the production of<br>
enamines and that it dissolves in water, and can be, for example, magnesium sulfate,<br>
sodium sulfate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate or calcium chloride, and<br>
preferably magnesium sulfate.<br>
The addition of water (ice water) and shaking or stirring can be performed at 0°C<br>
to 30°C (preferably at 0°C to 15°C, and more preferably at 0°C to 5°C).<br>
Furthermore, when the molecular weight of the enamine is large, some of them are<br>
in the form of solid or have a low fluidity at the treatment temperature mentioned<br>
above. In these cases, said treatment can be performed after the addition of a<br>
water-insoluble aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, benzene, toluene or hexane to the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
