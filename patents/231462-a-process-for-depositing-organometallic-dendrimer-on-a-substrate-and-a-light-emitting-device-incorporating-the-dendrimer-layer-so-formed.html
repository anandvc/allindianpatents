				<td>A PROCESS FOR DEPOSITING ORGANOMETALLIC DENDRIMER ON A<br>
SUBSTRATE AND A LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE INCORPORATING THE<br>
DENDRIMER LAYER SO FORMED<br>
This invention relates to metal-containing dendrimers and light-emitting devices<br>
containing them.<br>
A wide range of luminescent low molecular weight metal complexes are known<br>
and have been demonstrated as both light emitting and charge transporting materials in<br>
organic light emitting devices, in particular light emitting diodes (LEDs) also known as<br>
electroluminscent (EL) devices. Analysis of spin statistics associated with the injection<br>
of oppositely charged carriers which pair to form excitons shows that only 25% of the<br>
excitons formed in the LED are in the singlet state. Although it has been suggested that<br>
the barrier of 25% for singlet excitons may be exceeded under certain circumstances it is<br>
known to be far from 100%. For most organic materials only the singlet states can decay<br>
radiatively generating light, the triplet states decay non-radiatively. The possibility to<br>
extract luminescence from the triplet excited state has recently been demonstrated by<br>
inclusion of phosphorescent guest metallic complexes in host matrices. However, blend<br>
systems are sensitive to the concentration of the guest in the host and only low<br>
concentrations of the guest can be used before phase separation leads to aggregation and<br>
quenching.<br>
In addition the metal complexes used to date have been designed to be volatile so<br>
that layers can be deposited by thermal evaporation. In many applications solution<br>
processing would be preferable to evaporation, but the current materials do not form<br>
good films when deposited by solution processing. In addition it would be advantageous<br>
to have guest host systems in which high levels of guest can be used. This is possible<br>
with dendritic materials.<br>
According to the present invention these problems are solved by forming certain<br>
dendrimers with metal ions as part of the core. Dendrimers are highly branched<br>
macromolecules in which branched dendrons (also called dendrites) are attached to a<br>
core. The properties of the dendrimers make them ideal for solution processing and<br>
allow incorporation of metal complex chromophores, which have been demonstrated to<br><br>
be effective in light emitting devices (LEDs), into a solution processable system.<br>
The known examples of metal containing dendrimers fall into three classes<br>
(i) metal ion at the centre<br>
(ii) metal ions on the periphery<br>
(iii) metal ions at the branching points<br>
There is a range of metal containing dendrimers which have metal ions as part of<br>
the branching points and coordinating groups linking the metal ions, (see, e.g., Chem.<br>
Comm. (2000) 1701 and Adv. Mater. 10(4) (1998) 295). The photoluminescent<br>
properties of some of these materials have been studied in solution, but the solid state<br>
luminescent properties have generally not been explored. It does not necessarily follow<br>
that a material that is luminescent in solution will also be luminescent in the solid state.<br>
Concentration quenching in the solid state is a common occurrence. In the dendrimers<br>
with metals ions at the branching points there is a high density of chromophores which<br>
makes concentration quenching particularly likely. Similarly in dendrimers with metal<br>
ions at the periphery, the metal ions in adjacent molecules will be close and again<br>
concentration quenching will be a problem.<br>
The current invention is directed towards dendrimers with metal ions as part of<br>
the core. When the metal ion chromophore is sited at the core of the molecule, it will be<br>
relatively isolated from the core chromophores of adjacent molecules, which minimizes<br>
possible concentration quenching or triplet-triplet annihilation.<br>
Further the organometallic dendrimers already disclosed generally do not have<br>
conjugated dendrons, and so are unlikely to work well in an electroluminescent device.<br>
For example the only lanthanide (Ln) dendrimers reported to date have a Ln core and<br>
benzyl ether Frechet-type dendrons. These compounds were shown to give PL emission,<br>
but have not been proven in EL devices. Kawa, M.; Frechet, J.M.J. Thin Solid Films,<br>
331 (1998)259]<br>
Some organic dendrimers have been demonstrated to work in organic light<br>
emitting devices. However, the use of metal ion chromophores in the dendrimers opens<br><br>
up the range of materials that can be used, and may offer benefits in terras of stability<br>
and / or charge transport compared to organic systems. A particular benefit is the<br>
potential for highly efficient solution processed phosphorescent systems. Accordingly,<br>
the present invention provides a light emitting device which comprises a layer<br>
containing a metal ion containing dendrimer and, in particular, an organometallic<br>
dendrimer with a metal cation as part of its core, said core (or centre) not comprising a<br>
magnesium chelated porphyrin.<br>
The present invention is particularly directed towards the use of dendrimers<br>
containing one or more at least partially conjugated organic dendrons with a metal ion as<br>
part of the corel. Such dendrimers form another aspect of the present invention. The<br>
atoms or groups coordinating/binding to the metal typically form part of the core itself<br>
e.g. fac-tris (2-phenylpyridyl) iridum III. Thus the dendrimers typically have the<br>
formula (I):<br>
CORE - pENDRITE] (I)<br>
in which CORE represents a metal ion or a group containing a metal ion, n represents an<br>
integer of I or more, each DENDRITE, which may be the same or different, represents<br>
an inherently at least partially conjugated dendritic structure comprising aryl and/or<br>
heteroaryl groups or nitrogen and, optionally, vinyl or acetylenyl groups connected via<br>
sp2 or sp hybridised carbon atoms of said (hetero)aryl vinyl and acetylenyl groups or via<br>
single bonds between N and (hetero)aryl groups, CORE terminating in the single bond<br>
which is connected to an sp2 hybridised (ring) carbon atom of the first (hetero)aryl group<br>
or single bond to nitrogen to which more than one at least partly conjugated dendritic<br>
branch is attached, said ring carbon or nitrogen atom forming part of said DENDRITE.<br>
It is to be understood that the term "metal ion" or "metal cation", as used herein,<br>
describes the charge state the metal would have without any ligands attached (the<br>
oxidation state). In the dendrimers that contain a metal cation the overall charge of the<br>
dendrimer is neutral and the metal-ligand bonding will have more or less covalent<br><br>
character depending on the metal and ligand involved.<br>
As used herein the term acetylenyl refers to acetylenyl groups that are di-valent,<br>
vinyl refers to vinyl groups that are di- or tri-valent, and aryl refers to aryl groups that<br>
are di-, tri- or multivalent. In a preferred embodiment the dendrites are conjugated.<br>
The dendrimers of the invention are preferably luminescent in the solid state. The<br>
luminescent moiety may be partially or wholly within the core itself. The luminescence<br>
is preferably from the metal complex.<br>
Suitable branching points include aryl and heteroaryl, which can be fused,<br>
aromatic ring systems and N. The links between branching points include bonding<br>
combinations such as aryl-aryl, aryl-vihyl-aryl, aryl-acetylenyl-aryl, aryl-aryr-aryl<br>
(where aryl' may be different from aryl), N-aryl and N-aryl'-N. An individual dendron<br>
may contain one or more of each type of branching point. Moreover, in the case of the<br>
aryl-vinyl-aryl and aryl-acetylenyl-aryl linkages within the dendron there may be one or<br>
more aryl- vinyl or aryl-acetylenyl link between the branching points. Indeed there may<br>
be more than one vinyl or acetylenyl or aryl moiety between two aryl groups but<br>
preferably no more than three. Further, there can be advantages in using an asymmetric<br>
dendrimer i.e. where the dendrons are not all the same.<br>
Thus the dendrimers may be ones having the formula (II):<br>
CORE - [DENDRITEl][DENDRlTE2]m (II)<br>
in which CORE represents a metal ion or a group containing a metal ion, n and m, which<br>
may be the same or different, each represent an integer of at least 1, each DENDRITE1,<br>
which may be the same or different when n is greater than 1, and each DENDRITE2,<br>
which may be the same or different when m is greater than 1, represent dendritic<br>
structures, at least one of said structures being fully conjugated and comprising aryl<br>
and/or heteroaryl groups or nitrogen and, optionally, vinyl and/or acetylenyl groups,<br>
connected via sp2 or sp hybridized carbon atoms of said (hetero)aryl, vinyl and<br>
acetylenyl groups or via single bonds between N and (hetero)aryl groups, and the<br><br>
branching points and/or the links between the branching points in DENDRITE1 being<br>
different from those in DENDRITE2, CORE terminating in the single bond which is<br>
connected to a sp2 hybridized (ring) carbon atom of the first (hetero)aryl group or single<br>
bond to nitrogen to which more than one conjugated dendritic branch is attached, said<br>
ring carbon atom or nitrogen forming part of said fully conjugated DENDRITE1 or<br>
DENDRITE2 and CORE terminating at the single bond to the first branching point for<br>
the other of said DENDRITE1 or DENDRITE2, at least one of the CORE, DENDRITE1<br>
and DENDRITE2 being luminescent, as well as a light emitting dendrimer having the<br>
formula (III):<br>
CORE - [DENDRITE]n (III)<br>
in which CORE represents a metal ion or a group containing a metal ion, n represents an<br>
integer of 1 or more, each DENDRITE, which may be the same or different, represents<br>
an inherently at least partially conjugated dendritic molecular structure which comprises<br>
aryl and/or heteroaryl or N and, optionally, vinyl and/or acetylenyl groups connected via<br>
sp2 or sp hybridized carbon atoms of said (hetero)aryl, vinyl and acetylenyl groups or via<br>
single bonds between N and (hetero)aryl groups, and wherein the links between adjacent<br>
branching points in said DENDRITE are not all the same, CORE terminating in the<br>
single bond which is connected to a sp2 hybridized (ring) carbon atom of the first<br>
(hetero)aryl group or N to which more than one dendritic branch is attached, said ring<br>
carbon atom or N forming part of said DENDRITE, the CORE and/or DENDRITE being<br>
luminescent. In one aspect of the invention DENDRITE, DENDRITE1 and/or<br>
DENDRITE2 does not include N as a branching point and is conjugated.<br>
It is to be understood that in formulae I, II and HI CORE does not. comprise a<br>
magnesium chelated porphyrin.<br>
In this context, conjugated dendrons (dendrites) indicate that they are made up of<br>
alternating double and single bonds, apart from the surface groups. However this does<br>
not mean that the n system is fully delocalised. The delocalisation of the K system is<br><br>
dependent on the regiochemistry of the attachments. In a conjugated dendron any<br>
branching nitrogen will be attached to 3 aryl groups.<br>
The dendrimer may have more than one luminescent moiety. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the dendrimer incorporates at least two inherently luminescent moieties<br>
which moieties may or may not be conjugated with each other, wherein the dendron<br>
includes at least one of the said luminescent moieties. Preferably the luminescent<br>
moiety or moieties further from the core of the dendrimer have a larger HOMO-LUMO<br>
energy gap than the luminescent moiety or moieties closer to or partly or wholly within<br>
the core of the dendrimer. In another embodiment the HOMO-LUMO energy gap is<br>
substantially the same although the surface groups may change the HOMO-LUMO<br>
energy gap of the chromophores at the surface of the dendrite. Sometimes in, say, the<br>
second generation dendrimer the surface group makes the chromophore at the distal end<br>
of the dendrite of lower HOMO-LUMO energy compared to that of the next one in.<br>
The relative HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of the moieties can be measured by<br>
methods known per se using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. One of the luminescent<br>
moieties may be, or be (partly or wholly) within, the core itself, which will thus<br>
preferably have a smaller inherent HOMO-LUMO gap energy than the other<br>
luminescent moiety or moieties in the dendron. Alternatively, or in addition, the<br>
dendrons themselves may each contain more than one luminescent moiety, in which case<br>
those further from the core will again preferably have larger inherent HOMO-LUMO<br>
gap energies than those closer to the core. In this case, the core itself need not be<br>
luminescent, although luminescent cores are generally preferred.<br>
Suitable surface groups for the dendrimers include branched and unbranched<br>
alkyl, especially t-butyl, branched and unbranched alkoxy, for example 2-ethylhexyloxy,<br>
hydroxy, alkylsilane, carboxy, carbalkoxy, and vinyl. A more comprehensive list<br>
includes a further-reactable alkene, (meth)acrylate, sulphur-containing, or silicon-<br>
containing group; a sulphonyl group; polyether group; a C1-to-C15 alkyl (preferably t-<br>
butyl) group; an amine group; a mono-, di- or tri-C1-to-C15 alkyl amine group; a -COOR<br>
group wherein R is hydrogen or C1-to-C15 alkyl; an -OR group wherein R is hydrogen,<br><br>
aryl, or C1-to-C,5 alkyl or alkenyl; an -O2SR group wherein R is C1-to-C15 alkyl or<br>
alkenyl; an -SR group wherein R is aryl, or C1-to-C15 aikyl or alkenyl; an -SiR3 group<br>
wherein the R groups are the same or different and are hydrogen, C1-to-C15 alkyl or<br>
alkenyl, or an -SR' group (R' is aryl or C1-to-C15 alkyl or alkenyl), aryl, or heteroaryl.<br>
Typically /-butyl and alkoxy groups are used. Different surface groups may be present<br>
on different dendrons or different distal groups of a dendron. It is preferred that the<br>
dendrimer is solution processable i.e. the surface groups are such that the dendrimer can<br>
be dissolved in a solvent.<br>
The surface group can be chosen such that the dendrimer can be photopatterned.<br>
For example a cross-linkable group is present which can be cross-linked upon irradiation<br>
or by chemical reaction. Alternatively the surface group comprises a protecting group<br>
which can be removed to leave a group which can be cross-linked. In general, the<br>
surface groups are selected so the dendrimers are soluble in solvents suitable for solution<br>
processing.<br>
The aryl groups within the dendrons can be typically benzene, napthalene,<br>
biphenyl (in which case an aryl group is present in the link between adjacent branching<br>
points) anthracene, fluorene, pyridine, oxadiazole, triazole, triazine, thiophene and where<br>
appropriate substituted variations. These groups may optionally be substituted, typically<br>
by C1 to C15 alkyl or alkoxy groups. The aryl groups at the branching points are<br>
preferably benzene rings, preferably coupled at ring positions 1, 3 and 5, pyridyl or<br>
triazinyl rings. The dendrons themselves can contain a, or the, fluorescent chromophore.<br>
It is possible to control the electron affinity of the dendrimers by the addition to<br>
the chromophores of electron-withdrawing groups, where appropriate, for example<br>
cyano and sulfone which are strongly electron-withdrawing and optically transparent in<br>
the spectral region we are interested in. Further details of this and other modifications of<br>
the dendrimers can be found in W099/21935 to which reference should be made.<br>
It will be appreciated that one or more of the dendrons attached to the core<br>
(provided that at least one dendron is a specified conjugated dendron) can be<br>
unconjugated. Typically such dendrons include ether-type aryl dendrons, for example<br><br>
where benzene rings are connected via a methyleneoxy link. It will also be appreciated<br>
that when there is more than one dendron, the dendrons can be of the same or different<br>
generation (generation level is determined by the number of sets of branching points). It<br>
may be advantageous for at least one dendron to be of the second, or higher, generation<br>
to provide the required solution processing properties.<br>
The cores typically comprise a metal cation and attached ligands; the metal is<br>
typically central in the core and the core is typically luminescent. If it is not luminescent<br>
one or more of the dendrons should contain a luminescent group.<br>
When the core comprises a metal cation and attached ligands it is typically a<br>
complex of a metal, cation and one, two'or more coordinating groups, at least one, and<br>
preferably at least two, of the coordinating groups being bound to a dendron. Typically<br>
the luminescence of the dendrimer will derive from that complex. When CORE in<br>
formula (I), (II) or (III) above represents a group containing a metal cation , CORE is<br>
typically a complex of a metal cation and two or more coordinating groups, at least one<br>
and preferably two or more of the said groups each being bound to a DENDRITE,<br>
DENDRITE' or DENDRITE2 moiety as defined in formulae (I), (II) or (III), respectively,<br>
by the single bond in which CORE in these formulae terminates.<br>
In one aspect of the invention CORE may be represented as a complex of the<br>
following formula (IV):<br>
M[X-]qYr	(IV)<br>
wherein M is a metal cation, each [X-], which are the same or different, is a coordinating<br>
group X attached to a single bond in which CORE terminates, each Y, which may be the<br>
same or different, is a coordinating group, q is an integer and r is 0 or an integer, the sum<br>
of (a.q) + (b.r) being equal to the number of coordination sites available on M, wherein<br>
a is the number of coordination sites on [X-] and b is the number of coordination sites on<br>
Y.<br>
The single bond in the, or each, [X-] moiety, being a bond in which CORE<br><br>
terminates, connects to a dendron. Preferably there are at least two dendrons in a<br>
dendrimer, in which case q in formula (IV) is an integer of 2 or more. The said two or<br>
more dendrons typically have the structures represented by DENDRITE, DENDRITE1<br>
and/or DENDRITE2 as defined in formulae (I) to (III) above. The coordinating groups<br>
Y, when present, are neutral or charged chelated ligands which are not attached to<br>
dendrons and which serve to fulfil the coordination requirements of the metal cation.<br>
Suitable metals include:<br>
lanthanide metals: such as cerium, samarium, europium, terbium, dysprosium,<br>
thulium, erbium and neodymium,<br>
d-block metals, especially those in rows 2 and 3 i.e. elements 39 to 48 and 72 to<br>
80: such as iridium, platinum, rhodium, osmium, ruthenium, rhenium, scandium,<br>
chromiurn, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper, and<br>
main group metals of the Periodic Table: such as metals from Groups 1A, IIA, IIB, IIIB<br>
e.g. lithium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc, aluminum, gallium and indium. Suitable<br>
substituents Y, for rhenium in particular, include CO and halogen such as chlorine. For<br>
iridium dendrimers, the part of the ligands attached to the metal is preferably a nitrogen-<br>
containing heteroaryl, for example pyridine, attached to a (hetero) aryl where aryl can be<br>
a fused ring system, for example substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or benzothiophene.<br>
It should also be noted that the pyridine can also be substituted. Platinum dendrimers<br>
and especially platinum dendrimers with a porphyrin core with stilbene-based dendrons<br>
attached in the meso position are generally less preferred.<br>
It will be appreciated that the light emission can be either fluorescent or<br>
phosphorescent depending on the choice of metal and coordinating groups.<br>
Suitable coordinating groups for the f-block metals include oxygen or nitrogen<br>
donor systems such as carboxylic acids, 1,3-diketonates, hydroxy carboxylic acids,<br>
Schiff bases including acyl phenols and iminoacyl groups. As is known, luminescent<br>
lanthanide metal complexes require sensitizing group(s) which have the triplet excited<br>
energy level higher than the first excited state of the metal ion. Emission is from an f-f<br><br>
transition of the metal and so the emission colour is determined by the choice of the<br>
metal. The sharp emission is generally narrow, resulting in a pure colour emission useful<br>
for display applications. Due to the ability to harvest triplet excitons i.e.<br>
phosphorescence, the potential device efficiency can be higher than for fluorescent<br>
systems.<br>
Main group metal complexes show ligand based, or charge transfer emission.<br>
The emission colour is determined by the choice of ligand as well as the metal. A<br>
wide range of luminescent low molecular weight metal complexes are known and have<br>
been demonstrated in organic light emitting devices [see, e.g., Macromol. Sym. 125<br>
(1997) 1-48, US-A 5,150,006, US-A 6,083,634 and US-A 5,432,014]. Suitable ligands<br>
for di or trivalent metals are shown in Figure 1; they include oxinoids (I) e.g. with<br>
oxygen-nitrogen or oxygen-oxygen donating atoms, generally a ring nitrogen atom with<br>
a substituent oxygen atom, or a substituent nitrogen atom or oxygen atom with a<br>
substituent oxygen atom such as 8-hydroxyquinolate (LA) and hydroxyquinoxalinol (1<br>
B), 10-hydroxybenzo(h)quinolinato (II), benzazoles (III), schiff bases (V), azoindoles<br>
(IV), chromone derivatives (VI), 3-hydroxyflavone (VII), and carboxylic acids such as<br>
salicylato (VIII) amino carboxylates (IX) and ester carboxylates (X). The substituents<br>
including the R and X groups are typically halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, cyano,<br>
amino, amido, sulfonyl, carbonyl, aryl or heteroaryl on the (hetero)aromatic rings which<br>
may modify the emission colour. The R groups in formulae V and X are typically alkyl<br>
or aryl. The alkyl groups are typically alkyl groups of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, especially 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. The aryl groups are typically<br>
phenyl groups.<br>
The d-block metals form organometallic complexes with carbon or nitrogen<br>
donors such as porphyrin, 2-phenyl-pyridine, 2-thienylpyridine, benzo(h)quinoline, 2-<br>
phenylbenzoxazole, 2-phenylbenzothiazole or 2-pyridylthianaphthene and<br>
iminobenzenes. The (hetero)aromatic rings can be substituted for example as for the R<br>
and X groups given above. The emission of d-block complexes can be either ligand<br>
based or due to charge transfer. For the heavy d-block elements, strong spin-orbit<br><br>
coupling allows rapid intersystem crossing and emission from triplet states<br>
(phosphorescence).<br>
In fluorescent electroluminescent devices, many excitons form in the non-<br>
emissive triplet state, reducing the efficiency of light emission.<br>
Hence devices based on phosphorescent emitters, which can harvest the triplet<br>
excitons, have the potential for much higher efficiency than devices based on fluorescent<br>
emitters.<br>
The dendrimers can be built in a convergent or divergent route, but a convergent<br>
route is preferred. Thus the dendrons are attached to the appropriate ligands and these<br>
are subsequently attached to the metal cation to form the dendritic metal complex.<br>
Optionally other non-dendritic ligands can subsequently be attached to said complex.<br>
Alternatively a ligand with a suitably reactive functional group can be complexed to the<br>
metal ion, and then reacted with appropriately functionalised dendrons. In this latter<br>
method, not all ligands have to have the reactive functional groups, and thus this method<br>
allows the attachment of dendrons to some but not all of the ligands complexed to the<br>
metal. A key property of the dendrons is to impart solution processibility to the metal<br>
complex and therefore allow the formation of good quality thin films suitable for use in<br>
light-emitting diodes.<br>
The dendritic metal complexes may be homoleptic or contain more than one type<br>
of dendritic ligand, as discussed above. Alternatively, the metal complex may contain<br>
one or preferably more than one, e.g. 2 or 3, dendritic ligands plus one or more non-<br>
dendritic ligands. For example, with terbium complexes it is possible to have three<br>
dendritic ligands terminating in a carboxylate moiety for complexing to the metal plus<br>
one or more coligands to satisfy the co-ordination sphere of the metal cation. Suitable<br>
neutral co-ligands include 1,10-phenanthroline, bathophenanthroline, 2,2'-bipyridyl,<br>
benzophenones, pyridine N-oxide and derivatives of these. Also for iridium it is<br>
possible to have two dendritic phenylpyridine ligands with the third ligand a non-<br>
dendritic phenylpyridine ligand. It is desirable that the number of dendritic ligands is<br>
sufficient to provide the required solution processing. In the case of the dendritic metal<br><br>
complexes where all the ligands are different the method of preparation may give rise to<br>
a statistical mixture of all complex types. This is not necessarily disadvantageous<br>
providing that the optical, electronic, and processing properties are satisfactory. In the<br>
case of mixed dendron complexes it is preferable that the moieties forming the<br>
attachment point to metal are all the same or have similar binding constants. In the case<br>
of dendritic complexes that contain two or more different dendrons at least one should<br>
desirably be a conjugated dendron. The conjugated dendrons can be comprised of a<br>
number of different types of branching points.<br>
The surface groups and dendrites can be varied so the dendrimers are soluble in<br>
solvents, such as toluene, THF, water and alcoholic solvents such as methanol, suitable<br>
for the solution processing technique of choice. Typically t-butyl and alkoxy groups<br>
have been used. In addition, the choice of dendron and/or surface group can allow the<br>
formation of blends with dendrimers (organic or organometallic), polymer or molecular<br>
compounds. In one embodiment of the present invention there is a blend of a<br>
phosphorescent dendrimer possessing an organometallic core and a dendrimer which<br>
possesses the same dendron type but a different core.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention the organometallic<br>
dendrimer can be incorporated into a light emitting device as either a homogeneous layer<br>
or as a blend with another dendrimer (organic or organometallic), polymer or molecular<br>
compound. In one embodiment we show the first example that we are aware of a d-<br>
block phosphorescent material being used as a homogenous light emitting layer in an<br>
LED. We have also found that when a phosphorescent organometallic dendrimer is<br>
blended with a fluorescent host the emission spectrum may depend on the driving<br>
frequency of electrical pulsing. A device can be driven by applying voltage (or current)<br>
pulses with a certain duration and period (together describing the driving frequency).<br>
Within the regime where the duration and/or period of the pulses are on a timescale of a<br>
similar order of magnitude to the phosphorescence decay lifetime then the emission<br>
spectrum may be sensitive to the driving frequency. In another embodiment, it has been<br>
found that it is advantageous to blend the dendrimer with a charge transporting material.<br><br>
In particular it has been found that the presence of a hole-transporting and/or a bipolar<br>
material and/or electron transporting material is advantageous. In a further embodiment<br>
the bipolar material should contain carbazole units. Another embodiment has one or<br>
more of each type of charge transporting material.<br>
The organometallic dendrimers can be incorporated into an LED in a<br>
conventional manner. In its simplest form, an organic light emitting or<br>
electroluminescent device can be formed from a light emitting layer sandwiched<br>
between two electrodes, at least one of which must be transparent to the emitted light.<br>
Such a device can have a conventional arrangement comprising a transparent substrate<br>
layer, a transparent electrode layer; a light emitting layer and a back electrode. For this<br>
purpose the standard materials can be used. Thus, typically, the transparent substrate<br>
layer is typically made of glass although other transparent materials such as PET, can be<br>
used.<br>
The anode, which is generally transparent, is preferably made from indium tin<br>
oxide (ITO) although other similar materials including indium oxide/tin oxide, tin<br>
oxide/antimony, zinc oxide/aluminum, gold and platinum can also be used. Conducting<br>
polymers such as PANI (polyaniline) or PEDOT can also be used.<br>
The cathode is normally made of a low work function metal or alloy such as Al,<br>
Ca, Mg, Li, or MgAl or optionally with an additional layer of LiF. As is well known,<br>
other layers may also be present, including a hole transporting material and/or an<br>
electron transporting material. When the dendrimer is a phosphorescent emitter, it has<br>
been found that it is particularly beneficial to have a hole-blocking/electron-transporting<br>
layer between the light emitting dendrimer layer and the cathode. In an alternative<br>
configuration, the substrate may be an opaque material such as silicon and the light is<br>
emitted through the opposing electrode.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the layer containing the dendrimer<br>
can be deposited from solution. Conventional solution processing techniques such as<br>
spin coating, printing, and dip-coating can be used to deposit the dendrimer layer. In a<br>
typical device a solution containing the dendrimer is applied over the transparent<br><br>
electrode layer, the solvent evaporated, and then subsequent layers applied. The film<br>
thickness is typically 10nm to 1000nm, preferably less than 200nm, more preferably 30-<br>
120nm.<br>

Device Fabrication<br>
LEDs were fabricated by the following method. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)<br>
substrates were cleaned with acetone and 2-propanol in an ultrasound bath. A hole<br>
injecting layer of PEDOT (Bayer) was then spin-coated from water at 1000 rpm onto the<br>
cleaned ITO substrate and dried at 80 °C on a hot plate for 5 minutes. Dendrimer<br>
solutions were subsequently spin-coated onto the PEDOT layer at speeds of 800 rpm to<br>
give films typically 100 nm thick, and an aluminium cathode was then evaporated giving<br>
devices with active areas of 2 mm2. Device testing was performed in vacuum using a<br>
Keithley source measure unit for dc operation as well as a Hewlett Packard pulse<br>
generator (rise time 
the time required for charging the LED, was estimated to be in the order of 100 ns and<br>
driving conditions were chosen appropriately. The emission spectra were measured<br>
using an ISA Spectrum One CCD spectrometer. PL and PL excitation (PLE) spectra<br>
were obtained on an ISA Fluoromax fluorimeter. All emission spectra were corrected for<br>
the instrument response. As a crosscheck, PL spectra were also recorded on the CCD and<br>
found to be identical to those obtained on the fluorimeter.<br>
Example 14, Device Results for Gl-Pt-porphyrin 12<br><br>
Films and LED devices were made using 12 blended with either dendrimer A or<br>
dendrimer B (fig 9). Films of 12 / host blends were formed by spin-coating THF<br>
solutions of the two dendrimers (10 mg/ml) in a w/w ratio of host to guest of 10:1<br>
corresponding to a molar ratio of approximately 3:1. No phase separation was observed<br>
with these spin-coated films and their absorption was found to be a sum of the<br>
components. The films of the blends appeared to be of comparable quality to films<br>
prepared of the individual materials<br>
The synthesis of A is described in Reference Example 7 taken together with Reference<br>

The absorption spectra of the materials A, B and 12 are shown in Fig. 10. For A, B and 12<br><br>
the stilbene moieties are found to give rise to an absorption peak at 320 nm. In A the core<br>
gives rise to an additional absorption at 420 run, whilst in B the core gives rise to an<br>
absorption at 370 nm and for 12 absorption bands are observed at 420 nm, 514 nm and 544<br>
nm, corresponding to the Soret and Q-bands of the Gl-Pt-porphyrin 12.<br>
Figure 11 shows PL and EL spectra of blends of the materials under continuous excitation.<br>
Upon optical excitation, the emission of A appears green and peaks at 495 nm, whereas the<br>
emission of B is in the blue and peaks at 470nm, and in both blends the guest dendrimer 12<br>
emits in the red to near IR with peaks at 662 nm and 737 nm. The emission of the host<br>
dendrimers A and B is attributed to fluorescence, whereas the emission of the guest 12 is<br>
believed to be due to phosphorescence. For both the A : 12 and B : 12 blends the host PL<br>
emission is much stronger than the guest PL emission.<br>
The most surprising result illustrated in Figure 11 is the large difference between EL spectra<br>
of the blend B : 12 compared to the PL spectra. In contrast to the PL, in EL the guest<br>
emission is very much stronger than the host emission in the B : 12 blend. For the A : 12<br>
blend there is also an increase in the guest to host emission in the EL relative to the PL,<br>
although the increase is less marked than in the case of the B : 12 blend. The differences<br>
between the EL and PL spectra are due to charge trapping in the EL devices, which affects<br>
where recombination occurs. In both blends there is a red shift in the guest EL emission<br>
compared with the PL emission. The devices can be driven continuously or by pulse<br>
driving. It was also found that there is a dependence of the emission spectrum on the driving<br>
conditions and the duty cycle.<br>
Example 15, Device results for Ir dendrimer [2-(4'-Gl-Ph)Py]3Ir 10<br>
Devices containing the novel Ir dendrimer 10 were fabricated using the standard method<br>
described above. Devices were made with a neat Ir dendrimer layer and with a layer<br>
containing the Ir dendrimer blended with a mixture of dendrimer B and PBD (2-(4-<br><br>
biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-l,3,4-oxadiazole)). The structures of the two types of<br>
device were:<br>
ITO / PEDOT /10 (140nm) / Al<br>
ITO / PEDOT / dendrimer B. 10 : PBD / Al<br>
where in the blend the ratio of dendrimer B: ifl : PBD is 1 : 0.1 : 0.4 by weight, and two<br>
devices were formed one with a blended layer thickness of 150nm and the other with a<br>
blended layer 200 nm thick .<br>
The emission spectra of the neat materials as well as the blends are shown in Fig. 12. The<br>
iridium dendrimer (10) exhibits broad EL in the green (peak at 53 5 nm with features at 577<br>
nm and 623 nm). The benzene cored dendrimer (B) emits in the blue (peak at 460 nm). In<br>
blends both the host and the guest emit. The EL spectrum of the blend is not a mere<br>
superposition of the guest and host. In the thicker device, the emission band of the host<br>
cannot be identified, yet there is significant unstructured emission below the band of the<br>
iridium dendrimer. Most significantly, a new emission band is observed at 660 nm, which<br>
forms the emission maximum in some cases. This band is not immediately visible in neat<br>
10 devices.<br>
The blend EL spectra appeared white whereas PL spectra of films were green. This suggests<br>
that the broad feature formed in EL at 660 nm be not due to an exciplex but rather due to<br>
an intermolecular charge transfer state formed between host and guest. A strong dependence<br>
of the emission spectrum on the driving conditions is observed, indicating that the emission<br>
consists of both phosphorescent and fluorescent components.<br>
Example 16, Device results for iridium dendrimer [2-(3'-Gl-Ph)Py]jIr (11)<br>
The EL spectra of the dendrimers 11 and 10 are shown in Figure 13. The spectrum of 11<br>
is slightly broader and exhibits less vibronic structure. The emission peaks at 518 nm,<br>
whereas the emission for 10 peaks at 532 nm and has a vibronic feature at 569 nm. There<br><br>
is a significant increase in the red tail emission of 11. The device consisting of 10 was more<br>
efficient than that containing 11.<br>
Example 17, Device results for G2-Pt-porphyrin (13)<br>
Single layer devices of neat G2-Pt-porphyrin dendrimer (13) were fabricated<br>
(PEDOT/13/A1). In Figure 14, the EL spectrum of 13 is compared to the PL spectrum of<br>
the G1-Pt-porphyrin dendrimer (12). As has previously been observed in both free base<br>
and platinum porphyrin dendrimers, the EL spectra exhibit a stronger weighting of the lower<br>
energy emission peak.<br>

numbers apply accordingly.<br>

The results given above were obtained from devices which were prepared according to<br>
one of the following procedures.<br>
Standard device (no PEDOT)<br>
1.	Etch ITO squares 12x12 mm into 4x12 mm ITO strip by acid etch<br>
2.	Acetone rinse for 10 minutes with ultrasonication<br>
3.	Propan-2-ol rinse for 10 minutes with ultrasonication<br>
4.	Substrates dried under dry nitrogen flow<br>
5.	Substrates subject to oxygen plasma treatment for 5 minutes at 100 W<br>
6.	Dendrimer film deposited by spin coating<br>
7.	Substrates placed in vacuum evaporator<br>
8.	20 nm of calcium deposited at 0.1 nm/s under vacuum of 1 x 10"* mBar<br>
9.	100 nm of aluminium deposited at 0.1 nm/s under vacuum of 1 x 106 mBar<br>
In step 6, typically a solution concentration of 20 mg/ml was used to achieve a<br>
film thickness of 100-120 nm, and a concentration of 5 mg/ml was used to<br>
achieve aa film thickness of 45-50 nm. The solvent was usually ChCl3 and the<br>
spin rate 2000 rpm for 60 sec.<br>
For the devices with PEDOT the following steps were carried out between steps 5 and<br>
6:<br>
A.	PEDOT spun from water solution at 2500 rpm for 1 minute<br>
B.	PEDOT layer dried in air at 85 °C for 5 minutes<br>
TCTA is tris(carbazolyl)triphenylamine<br>
EHP-TCTA was prepared as in Example Z.<br>
CBP is 4, 4'-N,N'-dicarbazole-biphenyl.<br>
BCP is 2, 9-dimethI-4, 7-diphenyI-l,10-phenanthroline.<br>
TPBI is 2,2', 2" -(l,3,5-phenylene(tris[l-phenyl-lH-benzimidazole].<br>
Devices for lit and 27f were prepared in the following manner. ITO substrates<br>
were patterned by photolithographic methods, cut into squares 1" x 1" and cleaned<br>
sequentially in detergent, NH3: H2O2,1:1 and deionized water for 1 hour in an ultrasonic<br>
bath before drying in a stream of dry nitrogen. The dry substrates were transferred into<br><br>
a dry N2 atmosphere glove-box where they were subjected to 02 plasma treatment<br>
(Emitech Kl 050X plasma unit) at 60 W for 4 mins. Films of the dendrimer doped CBP<br>
or TCTA were deposited on the substrates by spin-coating inside the glove-box. Spin-<br>
coating was performed using solutions in CHCl3 (CBP and TCTA) or toluene (TCTA)<br>
at a concentration of 5 mg/ml with spin rate 2000 rpm for 1 min. The dried spin-coated<br>
films were then transferred to the chamber of a vacuum evaporator without exposure to<br>
air for vacuum-deposition of subsequent organic charge transport layers and/or metal<br>
electrodes at low pressure (
monitored by an in-situ quartz crystal microbalance and material was deposited at a rate<br>
of 0.1-0.5nm/s.<br>
Devices based on 11 and 27 emit green light with CLE. co-ordinates around<br>
(0.31, 0.63) whilst devices based on 111 emit red light with CLE. co-ordinates around<br>
(0.64, 0.35).<br>
As can be seen from the results in the table, for the green emitting Ir dendrimers<br>
it can be advantageous to blend the dendrimer with a charge-transporting material<br>
(TCTA or CBP). A hole-blocking layer (TPBI) between the missive layer and the<br>
cathode can give a further efficiency improvement. It was found that the ratio of 11 to<br>
TCTA was fairly flexible, and over a range of 5 -11 mol% there was little variation in the<br>
efficiency of the device. It can be advantageous to blend the phosphorescent dendrimer<br>
with both an electron-transporting material (TPBI) and a bipolar charge transport<br>
material (CBP) as this allows a remarkably high efficiency to be achieved from a device<br>
with only a single organic layer (final row in the Table).<br>
