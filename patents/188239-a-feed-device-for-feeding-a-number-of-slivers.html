Sliver feeding device<br>
The invention concerns a sliver feeding device according to the pre-characterising clause of Claim 1.<br>
For the purpose of feeding sliver-processing machines, for example lap forming machines, a group of slivers is fed to each draft system which is located above a feed plate for the lap forming machine. There are normally two or three such draft systems arranged in succession above the feed table. The individual slivers are drawn out of cans, via an associated roller located above the can, and fed to the corresponding draft system. The cans are located in rows next to the feed table. This means that the slivers are fed transversely relative to the longitudinal direction of the feed table.<br>
A device of this type is described in, for example, the brochure "The Kara Shokki CHERRY SUPERLAP SL 100 - Imprint 9-91". In this device, there are three rows of cans, each with 12 cans, placed in front of the feed table. This means that for each draft system, in which the draft rollers are aligned transversely relative to the direction of transport on the feed table, twelve slivers are delivered for the purpose of forming a web. So that the individual slivers are presented to the corresponding draft system in correctly ordered alignment, the slivers are deflected downwards, via a guide roller, from the take-off point on the cans to a pair of carrier rollers. There are also spacers mounted before each pair of delivery rollers for lateral guidance of the slivers. The slivers emerging from the nip clearance of the carrier rollers are passed to a deflection element, located on a guide table, by which they are horizontally deflected by 90° and passed to a draft system.<br>
In this device, the slivers are deflected a total of three times in the area of the feed plate before they are fed to the draft system ordered in correct alignment and adjacent to each other. From a technological viewpoint, each deflection process has a negative effect on the structure of the slivers. Twisting of the sliver can occur at the deflection points and this can have a negative effect in the subsequent drafting process.<br>
The object of the invention, therefore, is to reduce the number of sliver deflection points and to develop a simple and cost-effective feed device for the slivers.<br>
This object is achieved in that the feed device consists of several guide elements which are distributed over the width of the draft system for the purpose of individually deflecting each of the separate slivers downwards into a delivery direction aligned transversely relative to the horizontal take-off direction. By this arrangement or construction of the feed device it is possible to have only one deflection point for feeding the slivers to the draft system.<br><br>
It is proposed to construct the guide elements as rotationally symmetrical deflection elements.<br>
In order to avoid additional sliver deflections and achieve better guidance, it is proposed that the rotationally symmetrical axis of the guide element assigned to a particular take-off point is aligned transversely relative to the direction of feed of the sliver, as viewed from the take-off point.<br>
In order to achieve, accordingly, better alignment of the guide elements to the take-off points and of the take-off point to the draft system, it is proposed that the guide elements are mounted so that the vertical planes occupied by the axes of some of the guide elements intersect. By this means the position of each guide element can be aligned individually to the take-off point and the take-off point can be aligned to the draft system, thereby achieving a gentle deflection of the slivers.<br>
Furthermore, this also enables the slivers to be fed from the separate take-off points in a star configuration, i.e., no further guide devices are required for the sliver between the sliver take¬off point and the associated deflection roller.<br>
A design is proposed in which the guide elements, or their axes, are disposed on a plane which is aligned transversely relative to the downwardly aligned direction of delivery of the delivery elements. This arrangement produces an accessible sliver deflection point which allows the slivers to be threaded-in and set without difficulty.<br>
The further proposal whereby the axes of some of the guide elements are disposed in different horizontal planes produces a deflection point of compact design which prevents overlapping of the slivers or rubbing between the slivers and allows the draft system to be optimally aligned to the take-off point.<br>
Exact alignment of the guide elements to the said take-off point is simplified if, as further proposed, the guide elements are mounted so that the axes of some of the guide elements are inclined at different angles relative to a horizontal plane.<br>
A design is proposed, for the purpose of feeding slivers to the draft system from two sides, in which the guide elements are disposed laterally reversed relative to the vertical middle plane of the draft system.<br>
The guide elements in this case are preferably disposed in the area of planes which extend outwards in a pine-tree formation from the middle plane of the draft system.<br>
In order to reduce to a minimum the friction between the guide elements and the sliver at the deflection point it is proposed to construct the guide elements as deflection rollers which are mounted so as to be capable of rotation. For the purpose of exact guidance of the slivers, the guide rollers have one or several guide grooves. Several guide grooves are provided where one guide roller serves to simultaneously deflect several slivers. This<br><br>
enables a maximum number of slivers to be fed in correct alignment to the draft system.<br>
For the purpose of aligning the slivers delivered from the deflection rollers to form a web for presentation to the draft system, it is further proposed to include a sliver guide element below the deflection rollers with sliver guides fixed at intervals, the sliver guide element extending over the width of the draft system.<br>
The sliver guides can constituted by mutually adjacent and offset holes. These holes are appropriately chamfered in the area where the sliver enters.<br>
It is also possible, however, to form the holes so that they serve to hold guide tubes for guiding the sliver, i.e., the tubes can be separately mounted and removed. This renders possible, in particular, the production of a sliver guide element from wear-resistant material. The guide tube may advantageously be made from ceramic.<br>
For the purpose of facilitating threading of the slivers when the latter are set into the sliver guide element, it is proposed that the sliver guide element has slots of different lengths which are open at one end.<br>
For the purpose of aligning the slivers delivered from the sliver guide element relative to each other, a design is proposed in which the sliver guides of the sliver guide element are formed from guide tubes which are fixed so as to be capable of adjustment and offset adjacent to each other and which possess through-apertures.<br>
The guide tubes are preferably located in a mounting so that they are capable of lateral displacement relative to the middle plane of the draft system.<br>
This mounting can consist of a rod or a carrier with a longitudinal groove in which the guide tubes are mounted adjacent to each other so as to be capable of displacement. They can be fixed in position by means of a screw.<br>
In order to guide the slivers in such a way that they do not rub against each other in the area preceding the sliver guide element, it is proposed to include at least two adjacent mountings, each mounting holding a group of adjacent guide tubes.<br>
The inclination of the axes of symmetry within each group of guide tubes promotes the process whereby the slivers are guided together to form a web which is transferred to the subsequent draft system.<br>
Threading-in of the slivers is facilitated by the proposed tapering of the apertures of the guide tubes.<br>
A further variant is proposed in which the guide tubes have apertures which, viewed in the direction of delivery of the slivers, first taper and then diverge. This promotes both correct threading and self-cleaning of the aperture, i.e., it reduces the accumulation of dirt on the aperture.<br><br>
In order to increase the service life of the guide tubes, it is proposed that these are made partially from ceram ic or sintered aluminum.<br>
In order to achieve better alignment of the slivers delivered from the sliver guide element to the intake of the draft system, particularly in the edge area of the sliver lap, it is proposed are that the mountings are fixed so as to be capable of liberal adjustment relative to the middle plane of the draft system. This allows simultaneously lateral adjustment of a group of guide elements in one direction.<br>
The sliver take off-points are preferably rollers which are mounted, so as to be capable of rotation, on a feed frame, the rotational axes of each of the rollers being disposed so that they can be aligned approximately parallel to the axis of the associated deflection roller.<br>
To aid feeding to the draft system, the sliver guide element can be succeeded by a deflection roller and a guide table for the purpose of passing the sliver web into the first clamping point of the draft system.<br>
As is further proposed, the sliver guide element can also consist of a roller with guide grooves for the individual slivers.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides feed device for feeding a number of slivers delivered from various take-off points to a pair of intake rollers of a draft system, in which the slivers, which are delivered approximately horizontally and transversely relative to the delivery direction<br><br>
of the draft system are deflected and presented to the draft system transversely relative to the axes of rotation of the pair of intake rollers characterized in that the feed device consists of several guide elements which are distributed over the width of the draft system for individually deflecting the separate slivers downwards into a delivery direction aligned transversely relative to the horizontal delivery direction .<br>

Fig. 1 shows a lap-forming machine 1 for forming lap rolls 2 which are subseguently transported to a combing machine for further processing. The machine 1 possesses a feed plate 4, with two draft systems 5 and 6 being located above the feed plate. The draft systems 5, 6 are supplied with slivers F which are drawn out of cans K in the can rows Rl to R4 across corresponding take-off points 8. The can rows R1-R4 are disposed on either side of the feed table 4. The take-off points 8 can be constructed as draw-off rollers 9 as shown, for example, in Fig. 5. These draw-off rollers 9 are mounted so as to be capable of rotating freely around an axis 10. The draw-off rollers 9 are fixed to a feed frame 12, being capable of rotation. The slivers F drawn from the cans K are passed to a feed device 14 at which they are deflected from an approximately horizontal position to a vertical position. This feed device is shown in detail in enlarged scale in Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
This feed device 14 consists of several deflection rollers 16a to 16f which are mounted so as to be capable of rotation, some of them occupying different horizontal planes I-III. The deflection rollers 16a to 16f are mounted, so as to be capable of rotation, on a holder 18 which in turn is fixed to a rod 20 of frame which is not illustrated in greater detail. The holder 18 is mounted on the rod 20 so as to be capable of displacement and can be fixed in a set position by a screw 21. The separate axes 17a to 17f are located - viewed in the vertical direction - in the area of an oblique plane 23 or 24.<br>
The configuration is such that the deflection rollers 16a to 16c constitute a mirror-image of the deflection rollers 16d to 16f, so that the deflection rollers have a pine-tree configuration.<br>
As shown by Fig. 3, the planes defined by the axes 17a to 17c intersect. The use of this differently angled arrangement of the axis 17a to 17f enables the slivers F to be passed directly from the corresponding draw-offer roller 9 to the feed device 14 without special deflection points. Each of the deflection rollers 16a to 16f possesses two guide grooves 47, 48 , each of which holds one sliver. As shown particularly by Fig. 5, the axes 17c of<br><br>
the deflection roller 16c are aligned approximately parallel to the axis 10 of the corresponding draw-off roller 9. On its path from the draw-off roller 9 to the deflection roller 15c the sliver F is vertically supported by transverse rods 26 mounted on the feed frame 12. The special configuration of the rollers 16a to 16f described above enables the slivers which are deflected at the rollers to be delivered downwards in a sliver web 30 having the corresponding width B necessary for presentation to the subseguent draft system 5 or 6. For the purpose of passing the slivers F in this width to the draft system 5 or 6 with an appropriate mutual alignment of the slivers F, there is located below the feed device a sliver guide element 15 with holes 28 corresponding in number to the slivers F delivered downwards.<br>
As shown particularly by Fig. 3, the holes 28 are horizontally offset within the sliver guide element 15. These define the structure of the sliver web 30 that is produced following passage of the slivers through the sliver guide element 15. The inlet area of the holes 28 has chamfers 29. This is to facilitate threading-in of the slivers and also prevent splicing-off of outer fibres of the slivers. A chamfer 29 of this type could also be applied at the outlet from the sliver guide element 15.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a special design of the sliver guide element 15 in which a ceramic insert 32 with a through-hole 33 for the sliver F is inserted into the holes 28. In comparison with the design according to Fig. 4, the hole 28 in the design according to Fig. 7 has a larger diameter and the through-hole 33 has the same diameter as the hole 28 of the design according to Fig. 4. The design variant according to Fig. 7 offers a simple construction of the sliver guide element 15 and also the possibility of replacement of the inserts 32 when these become worn. The material and shape of the inserts 32 could be matched to the sliver number or sliver material.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further design variant of the sliver guide element 15 in which the holes 28 have been replaced by longitudinal slots<br>
35	and 36 which are open at one end. The longitudinal slots 35 and<br>
36	are of different lengths so that the delivery structure remains the same as in the embodiment example according to Figs. 3 and 4. The design according to Fig. 8 offers the particular advantage that the slivers can be easily threaded-in, i.e., it is not necessary to point the tips of the slivers for the purpose of threading-in.<br>
As shown by Fig. 6, the sliver web 30 is delivered downwards to a guide roller 38 which is mounted so as to be capable of free rotation. The guide roller 38 is mounted above a guide table 39 over which the sliver web is fed to the pair of input rollers 41 of the draft system 5. The sliver web 30 is drawn or drafted in the draft system 5 and is passed, as a web 43, via a guide surface 44 to the feed plate 4 under a clamping line of a driven carrier roller 45. The web 42 delivered from the draft system 6 is plied with the web 43 in the area of this clamping point and then passed to the lap-forming unit. The guide roller 38 is located directly above the guide table 39, forming with the guide table 39 a clamping point for the delivered sliver web. Thus, in this area of the clamping point, there is no further free deflection of the<br><br>
slivers since it is no longer possible for the slivers to become twisted, producing an unwanted structure.<br>
It would also be conceivable for the feed device 14 to be inclined in the vertical direction, rendering superfluous an additional deflection by the guide roller 38.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a further embodiment example of a lap-forming machine 1 in which the components are essentially the same as those of the embodiment example according to Fig. 1. Only the feed device 14 which constitutes the deflection point for the slivers F differs from the embodiment example according to Fig. 1. This is shown particularly by the side view in Fig. 10 and by the enlarged partial views in Figs. 11 and 12.<br>
The slivers are fed from the cans K in the can rows Rl to R2 and R3 to R4 to the corresponding feed device 14 in an approximately horizontal position.<br>
The slivers F pass via each of the take-off points 8 of the cans K to the corresponding deflection rollers 55a to 55o (Fig. 12).<br>
The deflection rollers 55a to 55o are mounted, so as to be capable of rotation, in staggered plates 53a to 53o. The plates 53a to 53o are mounted at defined intervals from each other on a holder 50 or a holder 51. The holders 50, 51 are mounted on a rod 52, each being inclined by an approximate angle a to the vertical middle plane M of the feed device 14. As shown particularly by the side view according to Fig. 11, the holders 51, 52 and the deflection rollers 55a to 55o are aligned in an approximately horizontal plane. For the purpose of demonstrating this more clearly, a horizontal plane H has been indicated, together with an axis joining line Al or A2 between each of the deflection rollers. As shown, the lines Al and A2 run approximately parallel to the horizontal plane H.<br>
With two exceptions, the individual axes 56a to 56o are inclined at a defined angle b to the horizontal plane H. Only the axes 56b and 56i run parallel to the horizontal plane H. This angled arrangement relative to the horizontal plane H is configured so that each of the deflection rollers pass the slivers F towards the holes 28 of the subsequent sliver guide element in such a way that there is no additional deflection of the slivers F. Thus, the deflection rollers 55a to 55o deflect the individual slivers F gently, without applying further stress. This is also achieved by a further inclination of the axes 56a to 56g relative to the axis joining line Al and of the axes 56h to 56o relative to the axis joining line A2. As shown by Fig. 5, this enables the axes of rotation of the individual deflection rollers to be aligned approximately parallel to the axes of rotation 10 of the associated draw-off roller 9 for the cans K.<br>
This pine-tree configuration of the feed device, occupying an approximately horizontal plane H, also produces an accessible, easily manipulated deflection point, i.e., the association between the individual deflection rollers and the corresponding delivery rollers 9 is clearly visible. The feed device 14 is fixed to a frame (not illustrated) by means of a rod 52. This mounting can be<br><br>
effected so that the position of the feed device 14 can be ajdusted horizontally and/or vertically.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 12 there is no sliver F on the deflection rollers 55g to 55o. These rollers could be used for holding a reserve sliver (not illustrated) or for an additional sliver if a further sliver F is drawn from a seventh can K in a can row Rl to R4.<br>
It is also conceivable to use fixed deflection elements, e.g. rotationally symmetrical ceramic parts, instead of the rotary rollers 16a to 16f and 55a to 55o. Although this would produce greater friction at the deflection points than in the case of the rotary deflection rollers it would offer a simple and cost-effective way of producing these deflection points.<br>
In order to achieve an appropriately angled position of the deflection rollers in the horizontal and vertical planes, in the solution according to Fig. 11 the plates 53a to 53o must be staggered accordingly (as shown).<br>
The slivers are passed through the sliver guide element 15 of the embodiment example according to Fig. 12 to the point at which they are presented to the draft system 5, 6 in a manner similar to that described with reference to the embodiment example according to Fig. 6.<br>
Figs. 13 and 14 show a further special design of the sliver guide element 15. In this case displaceable guide tubes 58 and 59, disposed adjacent to each other, are used instead of simple through-holes 28 in the sliver guide element 15. These guide tubes 58, 59 have funnel-shaped oblong through-apertures 60 which taper downwards. This form of the through-aperture 60 allows the slivers to be threaded-in without difficulty and also prevents outer fibres from being peeled away from the sliver web structure. The slivers are lightly compressed by the funnel-shaped, oblong aperture and changed in shape from the round sliver structure to a flat sliver structure. This flat sliver structure is better suited to the subsequent processing in the draft system 5 or 6 and enables a closed fibre mat to be presented to the draft system for drafting. In order that the slivers, which have a flat cross-sectional form, lie adjacent to each other without intermediate spaces the guide tubes 58 and 59 and their through-apertures 60 are disposed so that they overlap with the dimension X over the width B'. Precise setting of the dimension X is rendered possible by the fact that the guide tubes 58 and 59 are laterally displaceable, as indicated schematically by the double arrow. There are also applications in which the dimension X is set to zero. This, however, depends on the particular type of fibre material being processed. In order to bring together the flat slivers F delivered from the guide tubes 58 and 59 to form one sliver lap the symmetrical axes 61 and 62 of the guide tubes 58, 59 are inclined relative to the vertical middle plane V, i.e., the vertical plane in which the axes 61 are located would intersect the vertical plane in which the axes 62 are located below the sliver guide element 15.<br>
The guide tubes 58, 59 are fixed within the mountings 64 and 65 by means of the plates 67 so as to be capable of displacement. The<br><br>
plates 67 each possess holes, through which pass the screws 7 5 which are screwed into a guide nut 71. The guide nut 71 is formed so that it is capable of longitudinal displacement within the T-shaped longitudinal slot 69 of the mounting 64 or 65. When the screw is tightened the upper face of the nut 71 is tensioned against the top inside face of the T-shaped longitudinal slot 69 thereby preventing longitudinal displacement and fixing the guide tube in it set position.<br>
On the mounting 64 there is an angle piece 72 which is fixed to the schematically illustrated frame 77 by the screw 78. As shown particularly by Fig. 14, the angle piece possesses an elongated hole 66 allowing common lateral adjustment of the guide tubes 58. Normally, there are several such angle pieces placed at intervals on the mounting 64. This lateral displacement facility on the mounting 64 allows the edges of the of the delivered sliver mat to be set in relation to the intake of the subsequent draft system. The same adjustment facility is obviously also provided for the mounting 64. For reasons of clarity, however, this has not been shown.<br>
The use of guide tubes of this type allows individual intake adjustments to be made, taking account of the particular fibre material. The individual guide tubes can also be replaced relatively easily in case of wear.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a further means of fixing the tube 58. In this case, a holder 63 with a bearing part 68 is mounted on the tube 58. The bearing part 68 is fixed to a rod 70 so that it is capable of displacement. To achieve locking at a predefined point, a screw 73 projecting through the bearing part 68 is pressed against the rod 70. The rod, in turn, is mounted, so as to be incapable of displacement, in a frame 77. As described above, there could also be a device by means of which the tubes 58 can be laterally adjusted together by the displacement of the frame 77. It is also conceivable that, instead of the rod 70 having a round profile, it is formed so as to produce with an appropriately designed bearing part 68 a form-fit which prevents radial twisting of the guide tube 58 around the rod 70.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a further embodiment of a guide tube 80 in which there is a contraction in the central part of the aperture 81. The plate 67 fixes this guide tube 80 to an angle part [79] by means of the screw 75. The angle part 79 can be fixed to the frame 77 so as to be capable of displacement, as in the case of the angle part 72. Furthermore, the angle part 79 could have elongated holes in the area of the screw 75, allowing lateral displacement of the tube 80 across the direction of feed. There are also other conceivable designs of the guide tubes and their means of mounting.<br>
The design of the feed device proposed according to the invention allows slivers to be fed in a star formation from corresponding take-off points 8 without the need for further additional deflection points for the slivers F.<br><br><br>
