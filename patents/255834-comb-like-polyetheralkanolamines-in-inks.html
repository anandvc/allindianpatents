Comb-Like PolYetheralkanolamines in Inks<br>
Cross-references to Related Applications<br>
This Application claims priority to US Provisional application serial number 60/570,600 filed May 13, 2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a non-aqueous and aqueous pigmented inks wherein the pigment dispersant is a polyetheralkanolamine comb polymer. This invention also relates to aqueous pigmented inks which can be used in ink jet printers.<br>
Background Information<br>
When a pigment is used as a colorant, an ink composition is prepared by mixing the concentrated pigment dispersion which contains pigment, water, dispersant and the like with water, resin, a water-soluble organic medium, and other ingredients. U.S Pat. No. 6,818,053 discloses a production process for producing a pigment dispersion comprising the steps of (a) providing a mixture consisting essentially of a pigment, a dispersant, a polysiloxane surfactant and/or an alkanediol, a polyhydric alcohol and water; and (b) dispersing the mixture to produce the pigment dispersion. The patent also claims an ink composition prepared from the above pigment dispersion.<br>
In pigmented ink compositions, the pigment dispersion is generally stabilized by a dispersant which serves to prevent the pigment particles from agglomerating and settling out of the carrier. U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,698 discloses an ink composition comprising pigment, aqueous medium, and an acrylic/acrylate block copolymer as a<br><br>
stabilizing agent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,522 employs a graft polymer comprising a hydrophilic polyacrylic acid backbone and hydrophobic segment side chains in an aqueous ink composition. U.S. Pat. No. 4,597,794 discloses an aqueous ink dispersion for ink jet printers in which pigment is contained in a polymer having ionic hydrophilic segments and aromatic hydrophobic segments that adhere to the pigment surface.<br>
U.S Pat. No. 5,948,843 relates to a lithographic printing ink containing a dispersing agent of a reaction product of a styrene/maleic anhydride (SMA) copolymer and an alcohol as a pigment dispersant. U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,197 employs hydroxyl-terminated branched polymer off a short carbon chain in an ink jet ink.<br>
While prior pigmented ink compositions showed acceptable stability for the pigment dispersion, improved pigment ink dispersion is still needed to further lower the ink viscosity, impart better print density, increase pigment loading, and lower degree of shear thinning after aging. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved pigmented ink composition.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One embodiment of the present invention relates to ink compositions which comprise: a) a solvent component; b) a pigment component; and c) an effective pigment-dispersing amount of a substantially water-soluble dispersant having the structure:<br><br>

In a preferred form of the invention, n is any integer between 1 and about 10 when the hydrocarbyl group is aromatic. In another embodiment, n is any integer between about 1 and 20 when the hydrocarbyl group is aliphatic.<br>
A polyetheralkanolamine comb polymer according to the present invention de-flocculates pigments, and provides steric stabilization. Higher gloss and color strength are achieved due to the small particle sizes of the deflocculated pigments. In addition, the comb polymer of the present invention reduces viscosity, subsequently, which results in improved leveling is improved and higher pigment loading is possible.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
An essential component of a finished liquid ink composition according to the present invention is a comb polymer, made in accordance herewith serves to stabilize the pigment against agglomeration in the formulation.<br>
A comb polymer suitable for use in an ink formulation according to one embodiment of the present invention is formed by reacting a monofunctional, amine-terminated polyether with a glycidyl ether of a polyol. The product resulting from such a process may be conveniently referred to as a polyetheralkanolamine. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the amine-terminated polyether (ATP) reactant is present in an amount sufficient to ensure that the total number of reactive hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen atom of the amine(s) present is at least<br><br>
stoichiometrically equal to the amount of epoxide groups present in all glycidyl ethers of a polyols present.<br>
In another broad respect, the present invention provides a process which comprises reacting a monofunctional, amine-terminated polyether ("ATP") with a glycidyl ether of a polyol. A process according to the invention comprises reacting one or more epoxy resins (including without limitation Bisphenol A and its derivatives and analogs) with an ATP having a hydrophilic backbone (such as a polyethylene oxide (PEO) backbone) at elevated temperature, to afford a thermoplastic polyethanolamine having many hydrophilic branches. The polymer molecular weight and physical properties may be controlled by selection of raw materials and ratio of the two starting materials.<br>
A polyethanolamine composition of the present invention may be prepared by reaction of a diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A (or Bisphenol F) with a mono-functional polyetheramine having a molecular weight of 250 to 3500. The polyether (a.k.a. polyoxyalkylene) chain may be based on a polymer of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, or any combination of these materials, and may also include materials derived from cyanoethylated polyoxyalkylene glycols.<br>
A reaction according to the invention, for forming the water-soluble comb materials herein described may take place at any temperature between about 50°C and 150" C. Reaction times vary independently, and may be any time between about 2 and about 10 hours. A comb polymer in one embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 5% by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in another embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 10 % by weight of the<br><br>
polymer in water A comb polymer in one embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 15% by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in another embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 20 % by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in one embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 25% by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in another embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 30 % by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in one embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 35% by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in another embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 40 % by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in one embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 45% by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in another embodiment is preferably soluble in water to a degree of at least 50 % by weight of the polymer in water. A comb polymer in one embodiment is miscible with water in all proportions.<br>
A general reaction scheme for the preparation of a comb polymer according to one embodiment of the present invention is:<br><br><br>
in which an epoxy resin containing at least two epoxy functional end groups is reacted with a primary amine. R1 n the above reaction may be any C1-C1oo hydrocarbyl group; thus the epoxy reactant may be any epoxy resin of at least a functionality of two, and includes without limitation the materials listed under the glycidyl ethers section of this specification. Further, it is easy for one of ordinary skill in the art to control the relative amounts of the raw materials used in forming a dispersant according to the present invention. In one embodiment, there is an excess of epoxy resin present, which results in dispersant molecules which are end-capped with epoxy groups. In another embodiment, there is excess amine used in forming the dispersants, which results in dispersant molecules which are end-capped with amine groups.<br>
In the above equation, n is any integer between about 1 and about 50; R2 may be any hydrocarbyl group which includes as a part of its molecular structure a portion containing at least two alkoxy groups linked to one another, i.e., the group R2 may be a group:<br><br>
in which R3 is any C1 to about C24 hydrocarbyl group; X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6 in each occurrence are independently selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, subject to the proviso that at least one of the two X groups that are attached to the same alkoxy unit are hydrogen, p, q, and r may each independently be any integer between zero and about 100, including zero, subject to the proviso that at least one of p, q, and r is not zero, and s = 0 or 1.<br><br>
The Amine Component<br>
Such a group R2 as specified above may be incorporated into a polymeric dispersant of the invention by reaction of an amine having the structure:<br><br>
in which the variables are as defined above, with an epoxy resin having at least di-functionality, as previously specified. Thus, the above structures include R2 groups that include both random and block polymers and co-polymers of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and butylene oxide. According to one preferred form of the invention, the molecular weight of the amine reactant is any molecular weight between about 100 and 12,000. In cases where mixtures of such amines are employed to produce a polymer provided herein, the preferred molecular weight will be an average molecular weight of all amines present, and it is recognized by those skilled in the art that the production of alkoxylated amines inherently results in the production of a mixture of amines.<br>
Thus, the mono-functional, amine-terminated polyethers used in this invention include mono-amines having a molecular weight of from about 100 to about 12,000, which mono-amines include those marketed by Huntsman LLC of Houston, Texas under the trademarks JEFF AMINE® and SURFONAMINE®, as well as analogous compounds offered by other companies comprising polyoxyalkylenated primary amines. Preferred amine-terminated polyethers have a molecular weight of from about<br><br>
1,000 to about 3,000. While these particular materials are methoxy terminated, the amine-terminated polyethers used in practice of this invention can be capped with any other groups in which the methyl group of the methoxy group is replaced with a hydrogen or higher hydrocarbon such as ethyl, propyl, butyl, etc., including any hydrocarbyl substituent which comprises up to about 18 carbons. It is especially preferred that the amine termination is a primary amine group. Thus, mono-functional amine-terminated polyethers useful in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention may have the general structure:<br><br>
in which R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen and any C1 to C4 hydrocarbyl group; R3 is independently selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, ethoxy, and hydroxy; and wherein n is any integer in the range of between about 5 and 100, and including mixtures of isomers thereof. Such materials are available from Huntsman LLC of Houston, Texas.<br>
The Glvcidyl Ether Component<br>
The glycidyl ethers of polyols useful in providing a composition according to the present invention are generally known as "epoxy resins" which include various epoxy resins including conventional, commercially-available epoxy resins. In addition, mixtures including any two or more epoxy resins may be employed in any ratio of combination with one another to provide a mixture with which a primary amine as set forth herein may be reacted. In general, the epoxy resins can be glycidated resins,<br><br>
cycloaliphatic resins, epoxidized oils and so forth. The glycidated resins are frequently formed as the reaction product of a glycidyl ether, such as epichlorohydrin, and a bisphenol compound such as bisphenol A. C2-C28 alkyl glycidyl ethers; C2-C28 alkyl-and-alkenyl-glycidyl esters; C1-C28 alkyl-, mono- and poly-phenol glycidyl ethers; polyglycidyl ethers of pyrocatechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, 4-4'-dihydroxydiphenyl methane (or bisphenol F), 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethyldiphenyl methane, 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl dimethyl methane (or bisphenol A), 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3J-dimethyldiphenyl propane, 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, and tris (4-hydroxyphenyl) methane; polyglycidyl ethers of NOVOLAC® resins; polyglycidyl ethers of diphenols obtained by esterifying ethers of di-phenols obtained by esterifying salts of an aromatic hydrocarboxylic acid with a dihaloalkane or dihalogen dialkyl ether; polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols obtained by condensing phenols and long chain halogen paraffins containing at least two halogen atoms; N,N'-diglycidyl-aniline; 4-glycidyioxy-HN'-diglycidyl aniline; N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-diglycidyl-4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane; N,N,N',N'-tetraglycidyl-4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane; N,N'-diglycidyl-4-aminophenyl glycidyl ether; and combination thereof. Commercially-available epoxy resins that can be used in the practice of this invention include but are not limited to ARALDITE® GY6010 resin (Huntsman Advanced Materials), ARALDITE® 6010 resin (Huntsman Advanced Materials), EPON® 828 resin (Resolution Polymers), and DER® 331 resin (the Dow Chemical Co.). Heloxy™<br>
68, Eponex™ 1510, and ARALDITE® 0500.<br>
In general the polymers of the present invention are obtained by reacting aromatic polyepoxides with monofunctional amine-terminated polyethers in excess of<br><br>
aromatic polyepoxides based on equivalent, wherein from about 40% to about 75% of the epoxide groups of the starting material are reacted and the epoxy equivalent: amine equivalent ratio is between 1.10:1 to 2.5:1. U.S. Patent No. 6,506,821 Bl discloses epoxy resins obtained by reacting aromatic polyepoxides with polyoxyalkyleneamines in an equivalent ratio (epoxy equivalent: amine equivalent) of between 3.6 :1 and 10:1. Since the epoxide group content of these resins is numerous, they are water insoluble and are not suitable as pigment dispersants. U.S. Application No. 20050020735 discloses a dispersant prepared by reacting (1) monofunctional or polyfunctional aromatic epoxides; with (2) polyoxyalkylenemonoamines, wherein from 90% to 100% of the epoxide groups are reacted. The polymers of the present invention are also obtained by reacting aliphatic polyepoxides with monofunctional amine-terminated polyethers. However, we have unexpectedly found that when an excess of epoxy resin is utilized that the viscosities of pigmented formulations are far lower than what one would expect.   In one preferred embodiment the ratio of epoxy groups to amino hydrogen atoms (hydrogens attached to a nitrogen atom of a primary amine) in a reactant mixture used to form a dispersant according to the present invention is in the range of between about 1.1 : 1 to 2.5 : 1.   Such a provision ensures that less than 90% of the epoxy groups in the reactive mixture are reacted, which is especially beneficial when the epoxy component is aromatic to produce a material within this invention.<br>
Thus, it will be seen and recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that the R1 group of a dispersant according to the present invention, as specified in claims 1 and 16 appended hereto, is a hydrocarbyl residue derived from a material as described above.<br><br>
It is generally preferred that the amine-terminated polyether and glycidyl ether of a polyo! are present in such amounts that the amine group of the polyether is able to be consumed by reacting with essentially all of the epoxide functionality of the glycidyl ether. Thus, during the reaction, the amount of amine-terminated polyether is stoichiometrically equal to or greater than the amount of epoxide in the glycidyl ether of a polyol. The resulting product has little if any unreacted epoxide functionality left after the reaction.<br>
Depending on the starting amount used of a primary amine, it is possible to form either a secondary or tertiary amine in the final product. It is therefore possible to form products which contain repeating units where an ATP has reacted with two epoxide groups to form a tertiary amine. This result can be depicted by the following representative formula:<br>
RNHCH2CH0HCH2-[-0-A-0-CH2CHOHCH2NRCH2CHOHCH2-0-]x-A-O-CH2CHOHCH2-NRH in which R represents the capped polyether portion of the ATP; A represents a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical, such as the hydrocarbon portion of bisphenol A; and x can vary from 0 (if no tertiary amine present) to about 100. The reaction that forms such products is preferably conducted at any temperature in the range of between about 80°C to about 150°C, under ambient pressure.<br>
A comb polymer component of an ink formulation according to the present invention typically comprises any amount between about 0.5 to about 25 % by weight, based on the total weight of all pigment solids present in the ink formulation. According to a preferred embodiment, the comb polymer component of an ink formulation according to the present invention typically comprises any amount<br><br>
between about 1% to about 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of all pigment solids present in the ink formulation.<br>
The second component of an ink composition according to the present invention is the pigment component, which is typically an insoluble colorant material, such as phthalocyanine. However, a wide variety of organic and/or inorganic pigments may be present in an ink composition according to the present invention. Representative examples of inorganic pigments are carbon black, titanium oxides, and iron oxides. Representative examples of organic pigments are azo pigments (such as azo lakes, insoluble azo pigment, condensed azo pigments, and chelate azo pigments), polycyclic pigments (such as phthalocyanine pigments, perylenes and perylene pigments, anthraquinone pigments, quinacridone pigments, dioxazine pigments, thioindigo pigments, isoindolinone pigments, and quinophthalone pigments), lake pigments (such as base dye lakes, and acid dye lakes), nitro pigments, nitroso pigments, and aniline black daylight fluorescent pigments. Other pigments may also be used such as those that are dispersed in a water phase or those whose surfaces have been treated with a surfactant or a polymeric dispersing agent (such as graphite).<br>
The amount of pigment present in an ink formulation according to the present invention may vary depending upon the structure, but they may be present in any amount ranging from about 1 % to about 30%, and preferably from about 2% to about 10% by weight, based on the total weight of ink composition.<br><br>
Carrier Medium (Solvent) Component<br>
The third component of an ink composition according to the present invention is the solvent, which is sometimes referred to as the carrier medium. The carrier medium can be either aqueous or non-aqueous. When aqueous, the carrier medium is water or comprises a mixture of water and at least one organic solvent which is soluble in water to an appreciable extent. One preferred water-soluble organic solvent comprises one or more polyhydric alcohols. Polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol; diols such as butanediol, pentanediol. Glycols and glycol esters are also useful, and include those such as glycerol, propylene glycol laurate; polyalkyl glycols such as polyethylene glycol; and lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol mono-ethyl ether and ethylene glycol mono-butyl ether.<br>
Other suitable water-soluble organic solvents include lower alcohols and all their isomers having fewer than about 8 carbon atoms per molecule such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol; ketones such as acetone; ethers such as dioxane; esters such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, and lactams such as 2-pyrrolidone.<br>
The amount of solvent present in an ink formulation according to the invention is any amount in the range of between about 50 % to about 99.8 %, preferably about 70 % to about 99.8% based on total weight of the ink. Selection of a particular ink composition as being suitable for a given final-use formulation depends on requirements of the specific application, such as desired surface tension and viscosity, the selected pigment, drying time of the pigmented ink jet ink, and type of paper onto which the ink will be printed, as is generally recognized or appreciated by those skilled in this art.<br><br>
Other Additives<br>
An ink composition according to the present invention may be suitably prepared by combining the various components and mixing them in an ordinary kitchen blender. Optionally, a surfactant may be added to wet the pigment and modify the surface tension of the ink to control penetration of the ink into the paper. Examples of surfactants include nonionic, amphoteric, anionic, zwitterionic, and cationic surfactants, and those of ordinary skill in this art are aware of the surfactants employed in this field. Other additives such as binders (resins), biocides, humectants, chelating agents, viscosity modifiers, and defoamers may also be present in an ink composition according to the invention. Optionally, acrylic and non-acrylic polymers may be added to improve properties such as water fastness and smear resistance. These maybe solvent based, emulsions, or water soluble polymers.<br>
When employed in ink compositions, the polyetheralkanolamine comb polymers of the present invention de-flocculate pigments and provide steric stabilization. Higher gloss and color strength are achieved due to the small particle sizes of the deflocculated pigments. Leveling is seen to be improved and higher pigment loading is possible. As an added benefit, the comb polymers of the present invention reduce viscosity.<br>
In a general sense, a primary amine from which a comb polymer according to the invention may be prepared is defined by the general formula:<br><br><br>
in which R3 is any Cj to about C24 hydrocarbyl group; X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6 in each occurrence are independently selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, subject to the proviso that at least one of the two X groups that are attached to the same alkoxy unit are hydrogen, p, q, and r may each independently be any integer between zero and about 100, including zero, subject to the proviso that at least one of p, q, and r is not zero, and s = 0 or 1. In the case where s = 0, the materials are the SURFONAMINE® amines available from Huntsman. To provide materials with s = 1, one reacts the desired polyoxyalkylated alcohol with acrylonitrile, and subsequently reduces the nitrile to the primary amine, as such technique for cyanoethylation is well-known in the art. Generally, one may pass a mixture of acrylonitrile (present in excess) and a 2000 molecular weight MPEG over an AMBERLYST® A-26 catalyst (NH4OH on resin) in a suitable reactor at about 50°-60° C. The resulting effluent is stripped of any excess acrylonitrile, and the crude cyanoethylation product is reduced in the presence of hydrogen over a cobalt catalyst at 150° - 200° C under a pressure of about 200psi. The final product is stripped of lights to yield a tan-brown solid having a melting point of about 50°-52° C.<br>
The patent literature is filled with prior art on cyanoethylation techniques, including without limitation US Patent 6,794,530, and all references cited therein, which are herein incorporated by reference thereto.<br>
The following examples are provided as illustrative examples of the invention and shall not be construed as delimitive of the scope of the present invention whatsoever.<br><br>

The method of preparation of materials according to the above 2 formulations involved weighing the Joncryl® 63 binder, water, dispersant, into a beaker and mixed at low shear using a Silverson L4RT-A mixer until they were uniform. Then the pigment<br><br>
(carbon black or yellow pigment) was added in three portions and mixed well to wet the particles between additions. After complete incorporation of the pigment, this composition (termed the premix) was mixed for 10 minutes at high shear to begin the process of wetting and de-agglomeration of the pigment concentrates.<br>
The following examples compare the viscosity of the present invention with the prior art.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
The viscosities of premix Formulation 2 using dispersants from Preparations 2-8, (present invention), Example 11, Example 1, Example 3, and Example 5 are shown in Table 1 below. As can be seen, our present invention is much more effective at dispersing yellow pigment than competitor products (Examples 1, 3, 5, and 11), as reflected by much lower viscosity.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
The viscosities of premix Formulation 1 using dispersants from Preparation 2, 5 and Preparation 7, 8, (present invention), and Example 11 are shown in Table 2 below. As can be seen that our present invention is more effective at dispersing carbon black than the prior art, Example 11, as reflected by lower viscosity.<br><br>

As can be seen, the aged sample performed as well as a fresh one, which evidences the stability of the dispersants under the conditions tested.<br><br>
The present invention thus defines a whole new class of dispersant materials useful in formulating inks, coatings, and the like, including ink formulations comprising such dispersant materials as defined herein.<br>
As used in this specification and the appended claims, the word "hydrocarbyl", when referring to a substituent or group is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon<br><br>
atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character. Examples of hydrocarbyl substituents or groups include: (1) hydrocarbon (including e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl) substituents, alicyclic (including e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, and aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents, as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two substituents together form an alicyclic radical); (2) substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon substitueiit (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, and sulfoxy); (3) hetero substituents, that is, substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and encompass substituents as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and imidazolyl. In general, no more than two, preferably no more than one, non-hydrocarbon substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group; typically, there will be no non-hydrocarbon substituents in the hydrocarbyl group.)<br>
