limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as<br>
provided for by the terms of Grant No. 1R43CA111752-01 awarded by NIH/NCI, and Grant<br>
No. 70NAB1H3028 awarded by NIST.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] This invention relates generally to submicron-sized particles or labels that can be<br>
covalently or non-covalently affixed to entities of interest for the purpose of quantification,<br>
location, identification, or tracking. More particularly, it relates to surface enhanced<br>
spectroscopy-active composite nanoparticles, methods of manufacture of the particles, and<br>
uses of the particles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Fluorescence is a primary means by which biomolecules are tracked and<br>
quantitated. Fluorescent tags are used in DNA sequencing, gene expression analysis using<br>
microarrays, flow cytometry and its variants, RT-PCR. and a host of other applications. One<br>
application of special interest, and increasing importance, is intracellular imaging.<br>
Bimolecular binding/debinding events have been monitored by fluorescence resonance<br>
energy transfer (FRET), whereby event-driven changes in the distance between a fluorophore<br>
and quencher lead to changes in fluorescence intensity. Covalent attachment of fluorophores<br>
to surface antibody markers on white blood cells is the basis of cytometry; likewise covalent<br>
attachment of fluorescent tags has been used to visualize every organelle within a cell, and<br>
virtually every process that cells undergo. Despite their numerous strengths, organic<br>
fluorophores have several limitations, (i) They are highly susceptible to photobleaching and<br>
photodecomposition as excited states are both better oxidants and better reductants than the<br>
ground state, (ii) The fluorescence emission envelope is broad, limiting the number of<br>
spectrally orthogonal tags, (iii) The fluorescence is typically excited in the visible, a region<br>
where biological samples exhibit intrinsic background fluorescence, (iv) different colors of<br><br>
fluorophores often have vastly different structures and chemical properties, necessitating<br>
different attachment and handling protocols.<br>
[0004] The development of fluorescent nanoparticulate semiconductors (quantum dots)<br>
has extended the utility of fluorescence-based optical detection tags. (Chan, et al., Science<br>
1998, 281, 2016-18; Bruchez, et al., Science 1998, 281, 2013-16.) The disclosure of Chan, et<br>
al., and all other patents, patent applications, and publications referred to herein are<br>
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Quantum dots exhibit far less<br>
photobleaching than organic fluorophores, and in the visible, have narrower emission<br>
bandwidths. A consequence of the narrower emission envelope, though, is the narrower<br>
excitation envelope in the visible; as a result, ultraviolet light is required to excite multiple<br>
tags, which is less than optimal for biological systems. Moreover, bandwidths of quantum<br>
dots increase considerably as the particles emit in the red and especially in the near-IR, and<br>
accordingly, many fewer colors are available . Nevertheless, quantum dots have been used<br>
extensively for intracellular imaging applications, with promising results. Recent reports<br>
have used quantum dots to track the binding and endocytosis of epidermal-growth factor and<br>
for long-term imaging of quantum dots that were endocytosed or attached to biotinylated<br>
surface proteins of living cells. However, the bulk of the literature describes non-targeted<br>
approaches to cellular delivery. A peptide translocation domain was used to introduce various<br>
ratios of 5 colors of quantum dots into cell subsets to produce 10 unique codes. Various<br>
reports describe tracking of cells injected into mice after being encoded by quantum dots,<br>
including using a lipofection reagent and transduction peptides. Development of Xenopus<br>
embryos was also tracked after injection of micelle-encapsulated quantum dots.<br>
Unfortunately, endocytosed quantum dots are sequestered and not able to participate in<br>
further intracellular labeling and quantum dots delivered by transfection and electroporation<br>
are prone to aggregation. Microinjection allows delivery of unaggregated quantum dots, but<br>
is a serial process requiring much skill. Additionally, the long-term imaging with UV light<br>
can cause degradation of the quantum dots, resulting in spectral shifts and cytotoxicity.<br>
Likewise, the introduction of metal nanoparticles into cells has been described. Metal<br>
nanoparticles were shown to be successfully introduced inside living cells in 1990, when<br>
electron microscopy was used to examine nuclear uptake of colloidal gold microinjected into<br>
the cytoplasm. (Feldherr, et al, J Cell Biol 1990, 111, 1-8; Feldherr, et al., J Cell Biol 1991,<br>
115, 933-39.) The art was advanced by using video-enhanced color microscopy to track the<br>
nuclear targeting ability of peptide modified colloidal gold. Several reports have taken<br><br>
advantage of the strong plasmon resonance from Ag and Au nanoparticles by modifying them with biological molecules to track the dynamics of membrane-transporter protein on living<br>
cells in real time. The absence of photobleaching in both techniques allows long-term<br>
imaging without any degradation of the particles. In theory, particle size, shape and<br>
composition may be controlled to allow multiplexed plasmon resonance imaging<br>
experiments, but in practice, the width of features coupled with difficulty in making all<br>
particles a given size reduce the number of colors to 2-3.<br>
[0005] Raman scattering is readily excited using monochromatic far-red or near-IR light,<br>
photon energies too low to excite the inherent background fluorescence in biological samples.<br>
Since Raman spectra typically cover vibrational energies from 200-3500 cm-1, and since<br>
individual vibrations typically have very narrow bandwidths, i.e. 
envisage measuring a dozen (or more) reporters simultaneously, all with a single light source;<br>
however, normal Raman is very weak, limiting its utility for use in bioanalytical chemistry.<br>
In SERS, molecules in very close proximity to nanoscale roughness features on noble metal<br>
surfaces (gold, silver, copper) give rise to million- to trillion-fold increases |known as<br>
enhancement factor (EF)'J in scattering efficiency. SERS can also be used to detect molecules<br>
adsorbed to individual metal nanoparticles and has been used to demonstrate the detection of<br>
a single molecule.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0043] Surface Enhanced Spectroscopy-Active Composite Nanoparticles are described in<br>
United States Patent No. 6,514,767, entitled "Surface Enhanced Spectroscopy-Active<br>
Composite Nanoparticles," United States Patent Application No. 10/345,821, filed January<br>
16, 2003, entitled, "Surface Enhanced Spectroscopy-Active Composite Nanoparticles," and<br>
United States Patent Application No. 60/557,729, filed March 29, 2004, entitled "Surface<br>
Enhanced Spectroscopy-Active Composite Nanoparticles," each of which isincorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0044] The present invention provides new. methods for the preparation of Surface<br>
Enhanced Spectroscopy-Active Composite Nanoparticles (SACNs). and methods for<br>
preparing improved SACNs. Such nanoparticles each comprise a SES-active metal<br>
nanoparticle, a submonolayer, monolayer, or multilayer of spectmscopy-active species in<br>
close proximity to the metal surface, and an encapsulating shell comprising a polymer, glass<br>
(SiO2), or any other dielectric material. This places the spectroscopy-active molecule<br>
(referred to herein as the "reporter") at the interface between the metal nanoparticle and the<br>
encapsulant. In a typical embodiment, a SACN comprises (i) a metal nanoparticle core (e.g.,<br>
An or Ag), (ii) a Raman-active reporter,, that gives a unique vibrational signature, and (iii)<br>
an SiO; encapsulant that "locks" the reporter molecules in place while also providing a highly<br>
compatible surface for subsequent immobilization of biomolecules. The glass coating, which<br>
is essentially SERS-inactive, also stabilizes the particles against aggregation and prevents<br>
competitive adsorption of unwanted species. In some embodiments, the reporter and the<br>
encapsulant are introduced to the nanoparticle core sequentially. In some embodiments, the<br>
encapsulant comprises the reporter molecule. In some embodiments, the SACN further<br>
comprises polymer coatings adjacent to the nanoparticle.<br>
[0045] The nanoparticle core may be any nanoparticle known in the art. As used herein,<br>
the term "nanoparticle", "nanostructure", "nanocrystal", "nanotag," and "nanocomponent"<br><br>
encapsulaht; and a biomolecule selected from the group consisting of a protein and a nucleic<br>
acid.<br>
[0012] The present invention also provides a method for detecting an analyte comprising:<br>
obtaining a biological sample; and contacting the sample with a bioconjugated SACN<br>
comprising a biomolecule that binds to the analyte; and detecting the analyte bound lo said<br>
bioconjugated SACN.<br>
[0013] The present invention also provides a method, comprising; contacting a sample<br>
suspected of containing an analyte with at least one specific binding partner to the analyte on<br>
a lateral-flow assay surface to bind to the analyte in the sample; previously, simultaneously or<br>
subsequently to step (a), binding at least one analyte binding partner with a SACN; and<br>
detecting a SERS signal whereby the presence of the analyte is determined in the sample by<br>
the intensity or presence of the signal, whereby the presence of at least one analyte in the<br>
sample is determined.<br>
[0014] The present invention also provides a method, comprising, providing a<br>
microscope coupled to a CCD camera; providing a cell; contacting the cell with at least one<br>
SACN capable of specifically binding to the cell or a portion of the cell; providing a<br>
wavenumber filtering device between the cell and the camera; acquiring a plurality of data<br>
sets; and assembling the data sets; whereby a spatial profile of the SACN is acquired .<br>
[0015] The present invention also provides a nanoparticle, a metal nanoparticle; more<br>
than one Raman-active reporter molecule associated with said nanoparticle; and an SiO2<br>
encapsulate.<br>
The present invention also provides a method, comprising: contacting HAuCl4 with<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride; further contacting the solution resulting from step a) with a<br>
mixture of sodium citrate dehydrate and NaBH4, whereby a gold nanoparticle is produced.<br>
The present invention also provides a method comprising, providing a gold nanoparticle<br>
prepared by the previously described method; associating a Raman-active reporter molecule<br>
with said nanoparticle; and encapsulating the nanoparticle with SiO2; whereby a SACN is<br>
prepared.<br>
The present invention also provides a nanoparticle comprising: a anisotropic metal<br>
nanoparticle;a SERS-active reporter molecule associated with said anisotropic metal<br>
nanoparticle; SiO2 encapsulating the anisotropic metal nanoparticle.<br><br>
are used interchangeably to refer to a particle, generally a metallic particle, having one<br>
dimension in the range of about 1 nm to about 1000 nm. including any integer value between<br>
1	nm and 1000 nm. In some embodiments, the metal nanoparticle core is a spherical or<br>
nearly spherical particle of 20-200 nm in diameter. In some embodiments the range is about<br>
2	nm to about 50 nm, in some embodiments in the range of about 20 nm to about 50 nm (for<br>
example about 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,36, 37, 38, 39,40,<br>
41,42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48,49, or 50 nm). Anisotropic nanoparticles may have a length<br>
and a width. In some embodiments, the length of an anisotropic nanoparticle is the<br>
dimension parallel to the aperture in which the nanoparticle was produced. In the case of<br>
anisotropic nanoparticles, in some embodiments, the nanoparticle has a diameter (width) of<br>
350 nm or less. In other embodiments, the nanoparticle has a diameter of 250 nm or less and<br>
in some embodiments, a diameter of 100 nm or less. In some embodiments, the width is<br>
between 15 nm to 300 nm. In some embodiments, the nanoparticle has a length of about 10-<br>
350 nm.<br>
[0046] Nanoparticles may be isotropic or anisotropic. Nanoparticles include colloidal<br>
metal hollow or filled nanobars, magnetic, paramagnetic, conductive or insulating<br>
nanoparticles, synthetic particles, hydrogels (colloids or bars), and the like. It will be<br>
appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that nanoparticles can exist in a variety of<br>
shapes, including but not limited to spheroids, rods, disks, pyramids, cubes, cylinders,<br>
nanohelixes, nanosprings. nanorings, rod-shaped nanoparticles, arrow-shaped nanoparticles,<br>
teardrop-shaped nanoparticles, tetrapod-shaped nanoparticles, prism-shaped nanoparticles,<br>
and a plurality of other geometric and non-geometric shapes. Another class of nanoparticles<br>
that has been described include those with internal surface area. These include hollow<br>
particles and porous or semi-porous particles. Moreover, it is understood that methods to<br>
prepare particles of these shapes, and in certain cases to prepare SERS-active particles of<br>
these shapes, have been described in the literature. While it is recognized that particle shape<br>
and aspect ratio can affect the physical, optical, and electronic characteristics of<br>
nanoparticles, the specific shape, aspect ratio, or presence/absence of internal surface area<br>
does not bear on the qualification of a particle as a nanoparticle.<br>
[0047] Much of the SERS literature (both experimental and theoretical) suggests that<br>
anisotropic particles (rods, triangles, prisms) may provide increased enhancement compared<br>
to spheres. For example, the so-called "antenna effect" predicts that Raman enhancement is<br>
expected to be larger at areas of higher curvature. Many reports of anisotropic particles have<br><br>
been recently described, including Ag prisms and "branched" Au particles. Such anisotropic<br>
particles, used as building blocks for the formation of SACNs, are within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0048] Anisotropic Au and Ag nanorods may be produced by electrodeposition into<br>
preformed alumina templates, in a manner similar to the production of Nanobarcodes®<br>
particles. See, for example, Niccwarner-Pena, S. R.; Freeman, R. C; Reiss, B. D.; He, L.;<br>
Peiia, D. J.; Walton, I. D.; Cromer, R.; Keating, C. D.; Natan, M. J. "Submicrometer metallic<br>
barcodes," Science 2001, 294, 137-141.; Walton, I. D.; Norton, S. M.; Balasingham, A.; He,<br>
L.; Oviso, D. F. J.; Gupta, D.; Raju, P. A.; Natan, M. J.; Freeman, R. G. "Particles for<br>
multiplexed analysis in solution: detection and identification of striped metallic particles<br>
using optical microscopy," Anal. Chem. 2002, 74, 2240-2247. These Nanobarcodes particles<br>
are prepared by the deposition of alternating layers of materials, typically Au and Ag, into<br>
preformed alumina templates. In a typical embodiment, Nanobarcodes particles are<br>
approximately 250 nm in diameter and 6 microns long.<br>
[0049] To make metal nanoparlicles to be used in SACNs, the electrodeposition may be<br>
carried out in smaller diameter pores, as described, for example, in Example 10. In some<br>
embodiments, the pore diameter is less than 100 nm and, in some embodiments, between 10<br>
and 50 nm. Uniform alumina templates with these dimensions have been reported by several<br>
research groups. Such templates are now commercially available. Thus, in one embodiment,<br>
the invention provides a method, comprising causing deposition of a metal into a pore of a<br>
template, the pore diameter of which is less than 300 nm; causing deposition of a second<br>
material into said pore of said template, wherein the deposition of at least one of said first<br>
material and said second material involves faradaic electrochemical processes to generate a<br>
segmented, pore-bound nanoparticle; again causing deposition of a metal into the pore; and<br>
releasing the second material and the template from said segmented, pore-bound nanoparticle<br>
to generate a at least two free metal nanoparticles. In this embodiment, the pore-bound<br>
segmented nanoparticle has the composition ABA, and upon release of B and the template,<br>
two particles of A are produced. The depositions can be repeated to generate segments<br>
having the composition (AB)„ or A(BA)„, wherein n is any integer between 1 and 1000, and<br>
upon release from the template, n or n+1 particles of A are produced.<br>
[0050] In one embodiment, SACNs prepared by this method are approximately 250 nm in<br>
diameter and 250 nm long. An example of this method is described in Example 10B. Figure<br>
15A and B show a view of SACNs prepared by this method. While these particles appear to<br><br>
be rod-shaped, a closer view, shown in Figure 16A and B reveals them to have a non-<br>
geometric shape. The non-geometric shape is believed to result from the lack of a smooth<br>
interface between the metal (e.g., Au) and the material to be released (e.g., Ag) in the<br>
preparation of the particles. The lack of a smooth interface may result from inlerdiffusion of<br>
the two metals to form alloys, and subsequent dealloying during the release step. These non-<br>
geometric panicles are useful for SERS, as shown in Figure 17A and B. Deliberate<br>
simultaneous deposition of Au and Ag (e.g. 80:20 Au: Ag) will lead to significant alloying,<br>
and subsequent acid-driven dissolution of Ag can lead to very highly pitted surfaces that<br>
exhibit considerable internal surface area. To the extent that reporter molecules can access<br>
such interior sites, thereby experiencing the heightened electromagnetic fields between<br>
SERS-active nanofeatures, such surfaces may exhibit improved SERS behavior.<br>
[0051] In some embodiments, the invention provides a method comprising causing<br>
deposition of a first metal into a pore of a template, the pore diameter of which is less than<br>
300 nm; causing deposition of a second metal into said pore of said template; causing<br>
deposition of a third material into said pore of said template, wherein the deposition of at<br>
least one of said first material and said second material involves faradaic electrochemical<br>
processes to generate a segmented, pore-bound nanoparticle; repeating the steps of causing<br>
deposition of the first and second metals; and releasing said third material and said template<br>
from said segmented, pore-bound nanoparticle to generate at least two free metal<br>
nanoparticles, each comprising said first metal and said second metal. In this embodiment,<br>
the pore-bound segmented nanoparticle has the composition ACBAC, and upon release of B<br>
and the template, two particles of AC are produced. The depositions can be repeated to<br>
generate segments having the composition (ACB)n wherein n is any integer between 1 and<br>
1000, and upon release from the template, n particles of AC are produced. In some<br>
embodiments, one of the metals is magnetic.<br>
[0052] According to some embodiments, the metal includes at least one element selected<br>
from the Periodic Table of the Elements that are commonly known as metals. The metal may<br>
include primarily a single element. Alternatively, the metal may be a combination of at least<br>
two elements, such as an alloy, for example a binary alloy. Metals include Group 11 metals<br>
(Cu, Ag, and Au), or any other metals known by those skilled in the art to support SERS.<br>
[0053] In other embodiments, the metal includes an additional component, such as in an<br>
AU2S/Au core-shell particle. Au2S/Au core-shell particles have been reported to have widely<br>
tunable near-IR optical resonance. (Averitt, et al., October 1999, JOSA B, Volume 16, Issue<br><br>
10, 1824-1832.) Alternatively, Ag core/Au shell particles, like those described in J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 2001, 123. 7961, or Au core/Ag shell particles, or any core-shell combination<br>
involving SERS-active metals, can be used. Other combinations suitable for use in core-shell<br>
particles are included in this invention, such as Au- or Ag-nanoparticle functionalized<br>
silica/alumina colloids, Au- or Ag- functionalized TiO2 colloids, Au nanoparticle capped-Au<br>
nanoparticles (see, for example, Mucic, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 12674), Au<br>
nanoparticle-capped TiO2 colloids, particles having and Si core with a metal shell<br>
("nanoshells"), such as silver-capped SiO2 colloids or gold-capped SiO2 colloids. (See, e.g.<br>
Jackson, et al., 2004 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 101(52): 17930-5). Hollow nanoparticles<br>
such as hollow nanospheres and hollow nanocrystals may also be utilized in the SACNs.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a nanoparticle for use in a SACN<br>
comprising a core-shell particle active for SERS or a hollow nanoparticle active for SERS.<br>
The improved SERS signal of these particles may be demonstrated by manufacturing batches<br>
of these particles following a literature procedure and comparing the SERS signal to the<br>
metal particles described herein.<br>
[0054] Methods for preparing SACNs are disclosed in United States Patent No.<br>
6,514,767. Additional methods are disclosed herein, including in the Examples section. The<br>
SACNs referred to herein are photostable (do not exhibit signal bleaching), thermally stable,<br>
show linearity of signal, and exhibit batch to batch reproducibility, as explained in Example<br>
8.<br>
[0055] Examples of Raman-active reporters suitable for use in the present invention<br>
include 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MP); trans-4, 4' bis(pyridyl)ethylene (BPE); quinolinethiol;<br>
4,4'-dipyridyl, 1,4-phenyldiisocyanide; mercaptobenzamidazole; 4-cyanopyridine;<br>
1 ',3,3,3'.3'-hexamethy!indotricarbocyanine iodide; 3,3'-diethyltiatricarbocyanine; malachite<br>
green isothiocyanate; bis-(pyridyl)acetylenes; and Bodipy. Data for 5 different reporters are<br>
shown in Figure 2. It is clear that the spectra are distinct, and that for each species, there is at<br>
least one band that is unique. Additional features of suitable Raman-active reporters are<br>
described below.<br>
[0056] In one embodiment, the invention provides a SACN comprising more than one<br>
reporter. The preparation of one such SACN is described in Example 3. In one embodiment,<br>
the SACN comprises a metal nanoparticle core, a trans-l,2-bis.(4-pryridyI)ethylene reporter,<br>
and a 4-mercaptopyridine reporter.<br><br>
[0057] There is a background signal associated with SERS substrates that is typically<br>
absent from normal Raman. The present invention also provides methods for reduction of<br>
background signal from SACNs, as well as improved SACNs exhibiting reduced background<br>
signals. In Figure I, for example, the background signal at 1600 cm"' is -7000 counts, while<br>
the signal S is -11,000 counts above background. If measurements are shot-noise (N) limited<br>
[N = background"2], the S/N = 130:1, but the remaining peaks in the spectrum are<br>
. significantly lower. Reducing the background by a factor of 2.25 would lead to a 50%<br>
improvement in S/N, which in turn would help to resolve weak signals and generally improve<br>
the distinctness of different spectra. The present invention therefore provides methods,<br>
comprising reducing the background signal in an assay utilizing a SACN particle, wherein<br>
said reducing comprises removing strongly SERS-active impurities from a component<br>
selected from the group consisting of the sample to be analyzed, the SACN particle, and other<br>
buffers or related materials involved in an assay. . It is known that trace impurities (even<br>
those present in the reagents used to manufacture colloidal Au) may become irreversibly<br>
adsorbed to the panicle surface. Accordingly, rigorous purification of all materials, and<br>
especially the reporter, using ultrafiltration, HPLC, distillation, sublimation, and/or<br>
recrystallization may reduce background signal.<br>
[0058] For example, in the case of a lateral flow immunoassay, common substrates are<br>
PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) and nitrocellulose. It has been found that nitrocellulose is<br>
desirable in terms of Raman background.for two reasons. First, the PVDF exhibits some<br>
autofluorescence, as indicated by the drop in background after 2 minutes of continuous<br>
exposure to the excitation source (785 nm laser, approximately 200 mW power at the sample)<br>
in Figure 3. Though there are few Raman features in the background, the variability in<br>
intensity is more difficult to deal with than small peaks. Even after this decrease, the overall<br>
background is larger than that obtained from two separate nitrocellulose sources, neither of<br>
which displayed photoinduced changes in Raman emission over extended illuminations. A<br>
similar phenomenon is seen in Figure 4, which shows that glass has a weak but measurable<br>
background Raman when excited with 785 nm light. Raman spectra were acquired from<br>
glass slides obtained from two separate vendors. An integration time of 1 second was used<br>
for each acquisition, whereas a 5 second integration time was used to obtain the Raman<br>
background from a quartz slide. The quartz slide is hardly recognizable above the baseline,<br>
whereas each glass slide has measurable levels of background. Though background can be<br><br>
subtracted from spectra, the presence of a measurable background limits integration limes<br>
and can possibly hinder detection of trace quantities of Raman reporters.<br>
[0059] In another illustration of this effect, the background from particles made with<br>
highly purified reagents may be compared to those of identical composition made with "as-<br>
procured" reagents. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for reduction of<br>
background signal in a Raman spectrum generated by SACNs, comprising preparing an<br>
optimized SACN, wherein said optimized SACN comprises a reporter molecule, and wherein<br>
said reporter molecule is purified prior to incorporation in the optimized SACN, and<br>
generating a Raman spectrum with said optimized SACN. wherein background signal of said<br>
spectrum is reduced compared to a spectrum generated by a corresponding SACN which is<br>
not optimized.<br>
[0060] In some embodiments, the improved SACNs of the present invention provide an<br>
increased SERS signal when compared to known SACNs. For certain particle sizes and<br>
shapes, and at certain excitation wavelengths, Ag particles often provide larger SERS signal<br>
than Au particles. Improving the reproducibility of Au colloid synthesis would be expected<br>
to result in better SACN candidates. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for<br>
improved Au colloid synthesis. One example of such a method is described in Example 2.<br>
This method uses a combination of NaBH^, Na^citrate, and NH2OH for metal reduction. The<br>
improved method is more facile and results in more monodisperse particles when compared<br>
to other methods (such as traditional synthesis of colloidal Au using just citrate as the<br>
reductant.).<br>
[0061] In another embodiment, a nanoparticle for use in a SACN is prepared by a method<br>
comprising depositing a submonolayer coating of Ag on the surface of an Au nanoparticle, as<br>
in Freeman, el u\.. Journal of Physical Chemistry (1996), 100(2). 718-24. It is expected<br>
that a SACN including such a coated nanoparticle can be used to increase the SERS signal<br>
from spherical nanoparticles by about two-fold.<br>
[0062] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for optimizing reporter<br>
loading and SiO2 coating on SACNs. For each reporter successfully incorporated into a<br>
SACN, it is desirable to determine the conditions under which the maximum amount of<br>
reporter is present on the metal surface before the SiO: shell is completed.<br>
[0063] In some embodiments, SACNs are prepared with SiO2-precursor molecules that<br>
can also provide the Raman label moiety. This method should aid in increasing the SERS<br>
signal from the SACN. For example, 4-propylpyridineirimethoxysilane may provide the<br><br>
Raman reporter (the pyridyl group) and act as a SiO2 precursor through the trimethoxysilane.<br>
Because the SiO2 precursor and the label will not have lo compete for space on the Au<br>
particle, a higher surface coverage of label should be achievable. Commercially available<br>
.silanes. for example, are a ready source for silanes that may be applicable as unimolecular<br>
reporters/precursors. Examples of silanes include 3-(2,4-<br>
dinitrophenylamino)propyllriethoxysilane, 2-cyanoethyltrimethoxysilane, and p-<br>
aminophenyltrimethoxysilane, n-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-4.5-dihydroimidazoIe.<br>
[0064] In another embodiment, a nanoparticle is coated with a Raman-active polymer,<br>
such as a suitable polystyrene copolymer, a polyacetylene, or polythiophene. Such polymers<br>
may conveniently contain reactive groups, such as amines or thiols, to facilitate<br>
bioconjugation (see below) or for attachment of SiO2 precursors.<br>
[0065] In order to generate SACNs of a minimum diameter, the thickness of the SiO2<br>
may be reduced. In typical embodiments, the SiO2 shell thickness ranges from 1-40 nm. In<br>
some embodiments, the SiO2 encapsulant is 5-15 nm thick. While in theory it is possible to<br>
make the SiO2 shell any arbitrary thickness, this may be at the expense of maintaining the<br>
integrity of the coating. In some embodiments, it is important for the SiO2 shell to (i) protect<br>
the metal core and Raman label molecules from attack; (ii) prevent adsorption of potential<br>
spectral interferents on the metal surface; (iii) provide a SiO2 surface for biofunctionalization:<br>
and/or (iv) prevent aggregation induced by Van der Waals forces between the metal cores.<br>
[0066] SACNs with improved signal intensity as compared to SACNs based on spherical<br>
nanoparticles may be prepared using single crystal Au or Ag nanorods. The electrodeposition<br>
conditions (overpotential, temperature, additives, etc.) determine the structure of the nanorods<br>
that, in turn, determines the physical and mechanical properties of the nanorods. The SERS<br>
signal of nanorods can potentially be significantly increased if they are single-crystalline. It<br>
is generally known that the epitaxial, two-dimensional (2D) nucleation/growth mechanism<br>
requires electrodeposition at very low overpotential. Recently, electrodeposition of single<br>
crystalline Cu, Ag and Au nanowircs was achieved with reduced metal ion concentration, low<br>
overpotential, elevated temperature and addition of surfactant to the plating solution. Wang,<br>
et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 841-845; Tian, et a!., Nano Lett. 2003, 3, 919-923.<br>
[0067] Commercially available templates with pore diameters of 18 nm and 35 nm may<br>
be used to synthesize single-crystalline metal nanorods, including Au nanorods, with lengths<br>
between 50 and 100 nm. Evaporated Ag with a (111 )-growth orientation and thickness of<br>
200 nm may be used as a substrate. The electrodeposition may be conducted in potentiostatic<br><br>
mode by using a reference electrode to control precisely the overpotential during deposition.<br>
Significant conditions, such as solution composition and temperature, may be evaluated to<br>
achieve slow, epitaxial 2D- nucleation and growth of the Au nanorods. High-resolution TEM<br>
will reveal the nanorods' structure and X-ray diffraction may be used to determine crystal<br>
orientation. To make better use of the templates, multiple panicles per pore may be<br>
manufactured by sequential plating of Au nanorods separated by thin (10-20 nm) Ag<br>
segments with the same (11 l)-orientation. In theory, it would be possible to completely fill a<br>
pore using this method. As the templates are typically 50 - 60 urn thick it would be possible<br>
to prepare more than 400 100-nm long particles per pore. The same (potentiostatic)<br>
electrodeposition technique may be applied for synthesis of Ag nanorods by using (111) Cu<br>
substrate as the selectively-etchable plating base.<br>
[0068] As an alternative (and possibly less expensive) method, Au nanorods may be<br>
prepared using or adapting the solution-based method reported by Nikoobakht and El-Sayed.<br>
Nikoobakhl, B. and El-Saved, M. A. "Preparation and growth mechanism of gold nanorods<br>
(NRs) using seed-mediated growth method," Chem. Mater. 2003, 15, 1957-1962. A TEM<br>
image of nanorods prepared in a solution-based method is shown in Figure 5. In this sample,<br>
the average nanorod is approximately 10 nm x 50 nm in size, but there is considerable<br>
variation in particle size and shape, as seen by the formation of nanocubes. Solution-based<br>
methods are readily scaled to larger volumes.<br>
[0069] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for reduction of<br>
background signal in a Raman spectrum generated by SACNs, comprising preparing an<br>
optimized SACN, wherein said optimized SACN is prepared by a method comprising<br>
removing material irreversibly bound to the particle surface during the course of preparing<br>
the SACN, wherein background signal of said spectrum is reduced compared to a spectrum<br>
generated by a corresponding SACN which is not optimized. In one embodiment, removal is<br>
accomplished by vigorous oxidation of the SACN intermediate followed by mild reduction.<br>
Removal may comprise treatment of the metal nanoparticle with an oxidant, such as a<br>
combination of UV-generated ozone/oxygen radicals, followed by treatment with a reductant,<br>
such as ethanol, to remove exogenous organics. An example of cleaning a SERS-active<br>
metal surface is described in: Ron, et al., Langiiiuir 1998. 14, 1116-1121. In one<br>
embodiment, the metal is Au. In the course of the method, the Au surface is converted to the<br>
unstable gold oxide, and subsequently reduced by ethanol. In another embodiment, the<br>
method comprises treatment of the metal with a combination of UV-generated ozone/oxygen<br><br>
radicals (the oxidant), followed by treatment with a solution of reporter in ethanol, so that<br>
adsorption of the reporter may occur immediately upon reduction. In other embodiments, the<br>
ethanol is removed by centrifugation, and the reporter added in a further step.<br>
[0070] In some cases, species that contribute to background noise are introduced in an<br>
assay. For example, certain membranes used for filtration and preparation of samples have<br>
been found to introduce background into the Raman spectrum of assays involving SACN<br>
particles. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
reducing a background signal in a Raman spectrum of a SACN particle, comprising preparing<br>
a sample for analysis, said preparation comprising removing species from the sample or assay<br>
system that contribute to a background signal. In another embodiment, the present invention<br>
provides a method for reducing a background signal in a Raman spectrum of a SACN<br>
particle, comprising removing species from assay components that contribute to a<br>
background signal.<br>
USES OF SACNS<br>
[0071] The discovery of new drugs using high-throughput multiplex systems is an active<br>
research area. Automated and combinatorial chemistry can produce millions of new<br>
structures. The analysis of these drugs requires high-throughput and highly multiplex<br>
sensing. The use of SACN technology provides a highly multiplexed approach. Raman<br>
spectroscopy is ideal for providing the label-multiplex capability due to the sharpness of<br>
Raman peaks, and SERS offers many unique labeling opportunities. In some embodiments,<br>
multiplexed assays may be performed using a number of SACNs which include both a<br>
Raman-active molecule and one or more moieties. The moieties may be capable of<br>
selectively bonding to one or more delectable substances within a sample fluid, while the<br>
reporter molecules can be used to identify the SACN within the fluid (and hence the<br>
associated moiety). As the individual SACNs are relatively small, and as the number of<br>
targets which can be independently identified can be potentially quite large, large numbers of<br>
individual assays might be performed within a single fluid sample by including a large<br>
number of differing SACNs.<br>
[0072] A typical Raman spectrum spans over 3000 cm-1. See Figure 1. In one<br>
embodiment, a relatively narrow region of the spectrum is focused on by generating a<br>
plurality of different SACNs that comprise structurally-related reporter molecules. For<br>
example, a set of structurally related reporter molecules might include pyridine, pyridine-d5<br><br>
(deuterated pyridine), and pyridine-15N, 4-(methylamino)pyridine, 4-aminopyridine, 4-<br>
mercaptopyridine. 4-pyridinemethanol. 4-hydroxypyridine, and 2.3.5-trimethylpyridine.<br>
Because the Raman spectrum is based upon vibration modes, small changes in chemical<br>
structure can provide unique Raman bands. Therefore, a single SERS-active structure, e.g., a<br>
nanoparticle, is modified with a plurality of structurally-related reporters to produce a<br>
plurality of SACNs, each of which has unique SERS spectra, but similar chemical reactivity.<br>
This approach may require very high spectral resolution, and therefore potentially large<br>
and/or expensive monochromators.<br>
[0073] In another embodiment, the entire spectrum (rather than a small region thereof) is<br>
utilized. In this embodiment, a plurality of SCANs is prepared that collectively have widely-<br>
spaced vibrational bands. In some embodiments, a computer program conveniently may be<br>
used to make the selection from a given group of SACNs or reporters, each having certain<br>
spectral characteristics. In one embodiment, the computer program may be designed to select<br>
a plurality of SACNs or reporters based on user-specified spectral separation criteria.<br>
Alternatively the computer program may be designed to generate a possible SACN or<br>
reporter sets according to spectral separation magnitude. No single class of reporter<br>
molecules would be expected to exhibit vibrational bands over the entire spectral window,<br>
and therefore, in this embodiment, a variety of molecules are used as reporters. Selection of<br>
the molecules may be made guided by the following four criteria:<br>
[0074] 1. The reporter has Raman-active vibrational modes, i.e., modes causing a<br>
change in polarizability during the vibration.<br>
[0075] 2. The reporter adsorbs to any SERS-active surface, i.e., ΔGads« 0.<br>
[0076] 3. The reporter has as few bands as possible, to maximize free "spectral space."<br>
Non-linear molecules with N atoms exhibit 3N-6 allowed vibrations (IR + Raman). Clearly,<br>
smaller molecules are useful, though it is necessary to balance N with ΔGads, which typically<br>
is more negative for large molecules.<br>
[0077] 4. The reporter is compatible with the aqueous environment of the particle<br>
synthesis and capping protocols, as well as glass forming chemistry itself.<br>
[0078] A wealth of tabulated information is available on Raman spectra of various<br>
molecules. See, e.g., Nakamoto, K. Infrared and Raman Spectra of Inorganic and<br>
Coordination Compounds; 4th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc: New York; 1986; Lin-View, D.;<br>

Agbenyega, J. K. The Raman Spectra of Polymers; John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.: Chichester;<br>
1993, all incorporated herein by reference. Using the criteria set forth above, the following<br>
classes of candidate reporters have been identified as useful for reporter molecules for<br>
SACNs.<br>
[0079] Organic molecules: small size, unsaturation, heteroatoms, and electronegative<br>
substituents all lead to unique features. Examples with known Raman features: pyridines,<br>
triazines, pyrimidines, pyrroles, oxazoles, imidazoles, furans, cyanides, cyanamides, and their<br>
derivatives (i.e., 2-, 3-, 4- functionalized). Acetylenes, nitro/nitroso, -CCU, and -CCI3 all give<br>
unique fingerprint bands. Isothiocyanales (R-N=C=S) and isocyanides (R-N=C) are<br>
particularly attractive, since they are strong Raman scatterers, adsorb to Au. have vibrations<br>
at energies- not shared by any common functional groups, and the vibrational spectra depend<br>
strongly on R- group electronegativity.<br>
[0080] Ort:anic/inorganic anions: extremely simple spectra (often a single peak) are a big<br>
plus. Examples of reporters that give simple spectra include cyanide, SCN', ClO3', HCO2",<br>
and others. Some of these may be included at the time of metal particle synthesis. For<br>
example, colloidal Au has residual tightly-bound CI" arising from HAuCl4. It is possible to<br>
start with other metal salts, especially if strong reducing agents like NaBH4 are used.<br>
[0081] Coordination complexes and other compounds containing transition metals: the<br>
metal-ligand bond is an excellent opportunity to generate vibrational features at lower Raman<br>
shifts, i.e., 200-800 cm-1. Likewise, the ligand-based vibrations themselves are shifted<br>
relative to the uncomplexed state, and where possible, changing the metal redox state moves<br>
the energies of both bands. Ambidentate ligands like SCN' are particularly attractive as they<br>
can bridge a metal ion and the metal surface. In another embodiment, complexes which<br>
contain one or more strongly SERS-active ligands (e.g. cyanide in [Fe(CN)63]or |Fe(CN)64']),<br>
or 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) in [Ru(bipy);,2+ ]) can be used. Alternatively, organometallic<br>
species, i.e. those with one or more metal-carbon bonds (e.g. ferrocene) can exhibit intense<br>
Raman spectra.<br><br>
[0082] Mixed valent species: Prussian blue and WO3 are examples of materials whose<br>
vibrational spectra change as a function of metal ion redox state. The latter is particularly<br>
interesting since intercalation of H+ (i.e., to make HxWO3). D+, or Li+ allows continuous<br>
tuning.<br>
[0083] Isotopes: Changing the reduced mass of a vibrational mode is an excellent<br>
approach to shifting its energy, and this is readily available through isotopic substitution. For<br>
example, deuterated BPE, deuterated 4,4'-dipyridyl, and deuterated bis-(pyridyl)acetylenes;<br>
as well as pyridine, pyridine-d5 (deuterated pyridine), and pyridine-15N.<br>
[0084] Spectral independence conveniently may be assessed using spectral deconvolution<br>
software, that combines background subtraction and peak detection, along with methods such<br>
as direct classical Least Squares.. The use of such software allows the evaluation of<br>
candidate reporter molecules against other candidate reporters. Such software allows input of<br>
the pure reporter spectra and produces an output that quantitates each component in mixtures.<br>
[0085] Once a reporter set has been selected, the signal intensity of the SACNs can be<br>
normalized, thus resulting in SACNs with equal signals per number of particles. This<br>
capability, which is not possible with molecular fluorophores, ensures the maximum possible<br>
dynamic range for a given measurement. In one embodiment, the normalization process<br>
comprises two steps. In the first step, the intensity ratios of the identifying feature for<br>
reporters are measured. In the second step, SACNs comprising a decreased quantity of<br>
reporter, defined by the inverse of its intensity ratio to that of the weakest reporter, are<br>
prepared, with the exception of the SACN comprising the lowest intensity signal. This<br>
method assumes linear adsorption at low reporter concentrations, which is routinely observed<br>
for a range of reporters (also see Example 8). In another embodiment, normalization of<br>
reporter adsorption may be achieved by increasing the amount of SiO2 precursor (silane) on<br>
the nanoparticle surface during SACN synthesis, thereby reducing the reporter adsorption.<br>
These methods result in a plurality of SACNs having substantially equal peak intensities. As<br>
used herein, in some embodiments, substantially equal refers to peak intensities lhal are<br>
within 10% of each other. In other embodiments, substantially equal refers to peak intensities<br>
that are within 5% of each other, and in still other embodiments, substantially equal refers to<br>
peak intensities that are within 1% of each other.<br>
[0086] The present invention comprises SACNs comprising a reactive group on the<br>
solvent-accessible part of the particle, such as an -SH group, a -NH: group, or a -COO-<br>
group. In some embodiments the reactive group is associated with the encapsulent. The<br><br>
present invention provides methods for preparing bioconjugated SACNs, including<br>
preparation SACNs comprising a reactive group, such as thiol-active SACNs for<br>
bioconjugation. In embodiments where SACNs are encapsulated with SiO2, the surface<br>
silanol groups can be derivatized. The silica shell of the SACNs can be functionalized to<br>
bear free sulfhydryl groups either during the course of making the SiO; shell ("direct<br>
modification"), or after the shell has been completely formed ("post-modification"). Many<br>
reactions for the modification of silanol groups are known to those skilled in the art. For<br>
example, the SiO2 surface can be modified to present amines, (by reaction with aminopropyl<br>
trimethoxysilane (APTMS)) or ethoxides (3-glycidyloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTMS)).<br>
Reagents also exist to incorporate sulfhydryls, carboxyl and other potential sites for<br>
conjugation. Preparation of thiol-active SACNs is described in Example 4.<br>
[0087] Thiol-active SACNs are useful for the preparation of SACNs conjugated to<br>
biomolecules, for example, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids. For the attachment of<br>
antibodies, APTMS may be used to obtain amine groups, and subsequent carbodiimide<br>
chemistry to attach antibodies. Alternatively, GPTMS may be used to produce an ethoxide<br>
surface to which amines on the antibodies will directly react. In other embodiments, silanes<br>
terminated in alkylhalide, haloacetyl, and benzylhalide groups may be used for reaction with<br>
cysteine groups in proteins. Preparation of a bioconjugated SACN is described in Example 5.<br>
The cleanliness and presence of ions on a glass surface may have an influence on the success<br>
of derealization.<br>
[0088] In some embodiments, the SACNs as directly produced may be used as described<br>
herein. However, in other embodiments, better results may be obtained after the SiO2 surface<br>
is "cleaned" or modified, including reactions with acids or bases.<br>
10089] For each method developed, the derivatizing agents (e.g. silanes) and biomolecule<br>
may be titrated in order to control levels of derivatization. Fluorescently labeled antibodies,<br>
including those many available commercially, may be used to quantitate the amount of<br>
material present on the surface. This may be monitored as variables are optimized. To<br>
determine if the biomolecule remains reactive, fluorescent dye-labeled binding partners to the<br>
biomolecule may be mixed with particles, using uncoated particles as a control. For example,<br>
streptavidin-coated SACNs can be mixed with fluorescent dye labeled-biotin. The resulting<br>
particles may be centrifuged, supernatant removed, and the fluorescence of the particles<br>
measured.<br><br>
[0090] In some embodiments, biomolecules are attached to thiol-activated reporters using<br>
the heterobifunctional cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl 4-|N-maleimidomethyl|cyclohexane-l-<br>
carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC). This molecule contains both a muleimide group that is reactive<br>
toward sulfhydryls and a sulfo-NHS ester that preferentially reacts with primary amines. In<br>
this case, a simple one-pot reaction can be used to attach streptavidin, and is readily adaptable<br>
to attachment of most proteins, amine-terminated oligonucleotides, or other molecules that<br>
bear primary amines.<br>
[0091] SACNs with amine functionality on the surface can be treated with succinic<br>
anhydride, which reacts with primary amines to leave a free carboxylate. A carbodiimide<br>
may be used to link to amines on biomolecules, such as streptavidin. Amine-coated particles<br>
may also be linked to amines on the biomolecule using a homobifunctional linker such as<br>
glutaraldehyde, An alternative option is to first convert a portion of the protein's amines to<br>
sulfhydryls using 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) and subsequently link to the particles<br>
using sulfo-SMCC.<br>
[0092] Bioconjugated SACNs may be purified, in part for purposes of reducing non-<br>
specific binding. In the case of an antibody-conjugated SACN, free antibody will compete<br>
with the SACNs for antigens, reducing sensitivity. In one embodiment, SACNs arc purified<br>
by centrifugation, including more than one centrifugation. Purification efficiency may be<br>
spectroscopically determined by doping in fluorescently labeled proteins. Because it is<br>
known than fluorescent dyes can interact with glass surfaces, it may be necessary to confirm<br>
results with radioactively labeled proteins. A tangential flow filtration device may be used<br>
for the purification of silica-coated particles as well as the purification of conjugated SACNs.<br>
[0093] It is desirable to eliminate or reduce non-specific binding (NSB) of SACNs. The<br>
SACNs may be tested on glass slides, microwell plates and fixed cell surfaces. The level to<br>
which each of the different conjugation protocols, and surface coverage, affect NSB may be<br>
identified. For example, the effect of standard blocking agents and wash buffers, such as<br>
Tween®, and casein, in addition to different pH and buffers may be determined. In one<br>
embodiment, NSB can be reduced by blocking the particles with a blocking agent, including<br>
agents described herein. In one embodiment, the blocking agent is BSA, as described in<br>
Example 6. Alternatively NSB may be reduced or eliminated by polymer-based<br>
derivatization of the SiO2 shell, such as with polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol and<br>
dextrans, polyethylenimine and dendrimers, all known to have low NSB. In addition,<br>
commercially available microarray glass coating reagents may also be used.<br><br>
[0094] In one embodiment, a conjugated SACN comprises a spacer molecule between the<br>
SACN and the conjugated biomolecule. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
certain spacer molecules, such as polyethylene glycol or dextran, will minimize NSB. Spacer<br>
molecules may be introduced into the bioconjugated SACN by methods described herein, and<br>
other methods known in the art. For example, commercially available cross-linkers that<br>
incorporate a discrete PEG subunit into a sulfo-SMCC may be used. A biomolecule may be<br>
attached to this PEG-based linker. Similarly, functional PEG molecules can be co-conjugated<br>
to SACNs along with the antibody. In this regard, the PEG acts as a spacer to minimize<br>
exposure of the bare silica surface to undesired species in the assay. Alternatively, it is<br>
possible to first conjugate bifunctional PEG molecules to the SACNs. The available<br>
functional group of the PEG may then be used for further conjugation to an antibody or other<br>
biomolecule.<br>
[0095] In a one embodiment, assays and kits are provided in the present invention for the<br>
detection of a target analyte. An analyte can be any specific substance or component that one<br>
is desirous of detecting and/or measuring. Analytes of interest include, for example, antigens<br>
(such as antigens specific to bacterial, viral or protozoan organisms); antibodies, including<br>
those induced in response to an infection, allergic reaction, or vaccine; hormones, proteins<br>
and other physiological substances (for example, human chorionic gonadotropin, estrogens,<br>
progestins, testosterones, corticosteroids, human growth factors, hemoglobin, and<br>
cholesterol); nucleic acids; a variety of enzymes; therapeutic compounds and illicit drugs;<br>
contaminants and environmental pollutants; or any number of natural or synthetic substances.<br>
[0096] In one embodiment, the invention provides a sandwich immunoassay using<br>
SACNs that can be used to replace an ELISA-type assay. The analytical technique of<br>
enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay (ELISA) and related techniques are now the most<br>
widely known immunoassays. The stages of a conventional ELISA procedure generally<br>
include initially adsorbing a capture antibody onto a solid support. Upon incubation with a<br>
sample, an antibody-target protein complex is formed. The final sandwich immunoassay<br>
complex typically includes an indicator enzyme that permits optical measurements of the<br>
antigen concentration. In a sandwich assay immunoassay using SACNs, however, instead of<br>
an indicator enzyme, a SACN is used to permit optical detection. In this embodiment, the<br>
bioconjugated SACNs may be prepared with precisely known concentrations of specific<br>
active antibody species attached to their surfaces, and can be quantified using a binding assay<br><br>
with a protein quantification assay, such as the BCA assay. Such an assay can be<br>
multiplexed, as described in Example 11.<br>
[0097] The methods according to the present invention are useful for detection of<br>
analytes in samples of biological origins. Such samples include, but are not limited to blood<br>
or serum; saliva, sputum, tears, sweat, or other secreted fluids; urine or fecal matter; as well<br>
as biologically derived fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, interstitial fluid, cellular extracts<br>
and the like. Whole blood is a suitable medium for SERS measurements from SACNs. See<br>
Figure 20.<br>
[0098] A minimal volume of sample is used for the assay, including sample volumes that<br>
range from about 1 uL to about 500 uL in some embodiments, from about 1 uL to about 100<br>
uL in other embodiments, from about 5 uL to about 50 uL in other embodiments, and<br>
between about 10 uL and about 30 uL in still other embodiments. Larger sample volumes<br>
may be used if the situation warrants it, such as in the case of bulk blood monitoring in a<br>
blood bank, where sample volumes may be on the order of milliliters. Smaller volumes may<br>
also be used if the situation warrants; for example, in the case of an assay for a cell, the<br>
volume of the cell may be used. In the case of an assay that targets an intracellular<br>
component, the volume of the intracellular component may be used. In such cellular or<br>
subcellular assays, the volume may be as low as I pL.<br>
[0099] The assays of the present invention are based on binding assays such as, but not<br>
limited to, immunoassays. The binding partners involved in such binding assays include, but<br>
are not limited to, the following binding pairs: antibody and antigen or hapten; hormone and<br>
receptor; biotin and avidin; carbohydrate and lectin; effector and receptor molecules;<br>
enzymes and cofactors, substrates, or inhibitors; aplamers and their targets, and<br>
complementary nucleotide sequences. ■ Thus, the descriptions and examples included below<br>
are for demonstration purposes and should not be considered limiting to the particular<br>
applications addressed.<br>
[0100]	In one, embodiment, the present invention comprises a method for detecting the<br>
presence of at least one analyte which comprises the following steps: (a) contacting the<br>
sample suspected of containing the analyte with at least one specific binding partner to the<br>
analyte on a lateral-flow assay surface to bind to the analyte in the sample; (b) previously,<br>
simultaneously or subsequently to step (a), binding the at least one analyte binding partner<br>
with a SACN to form a conjugated SACN; and (c) detecting a SERS signal whereby the<br>
presence of the analyte is determined in the sample by the intensity or presence of the signal.<br><br>
[0101]	In one embodiment, the sample is placed on a sample zone. The sample filters<br>
down through the sample zone and then through a label zone containing a label, e.g., a<br>
conjugated SACN. The SACN binds to sample analyte to form complexes, and the<br>
complexes then migrate along the membrane or detection strip. The complexes of SACN-<br>
analyte, if present, bind to the at least one specific binding partner that is immobilized in a<br>
detection zone on the membrane. Formation of this SACN-labeled complex with its specific<br>
binding partner results in a detectable SERS signal, indicating a positive result that the<br>
analyte is present in the sample. In the case where the analyte is IL-5, for instance, the<br>
SACN may be conjugated to an IL-5 antibody and a corresponding capture antibody for IL-5<br>
may be present in the detection zone. A lateral flow assay is described in Example 12.<br>
[0102]	In one embodiment, the biological sample is a cell. The cell may either be<br>
living or dead. Images of cells containing Raman spectral information can be obtained by a<br>
number of methods. A microscope can be coupled to a CCD camera such that complete<br>
images of the object may be obtained. Then, between the sample and the camera, a<br>
wavenumber filtering device such as a monochromator or liquid crystal tunable filter is<br>
inserted. The filtering device only allows a narrow bandwidth of the scattered radiation to<br>
reach the camera at any one time. Multiple images are collected, each covering a small<br>
spectral range of the scattered radiation. The spectra from each point in the image are<br>
assembled in software. At the other extreme, light from a single point of an image may be<br>
dispersed through a monochromator and the complete spectrum of that point can be acquired<br>
on an array detector. The object is then scanned such that each point in the image is acquired<br>
separately. The Raman image is then assembled in software. In another approach, a line<br>
scan instrument can be constructed that excites the sample with a line of radiation. The line<br>
is imaged spatially along one axis of a CCD camera while simultaneously being spectrally<br>
dispersed along the orthogonal axis. Each readout of the camera acquires the complete<br>
spectrum of each spatial pixel in the line. To complete the image the line is scanned across<br>
the sample.<br>
[0103]	Thus, according to this invention, cells or cell populations may be identified by<br>
using an antibody-conjugated SACN prepared with an antibody which binds a cell surface<br>
antigenic receptor which is expressed on a cell subpopulation. Identification of cells and cell<br>
populations may also be achieved via a sandwich approach. For example, Example 13<br>
describes an assay in which NeutrAvidin conjugated SACNs were applied to SK-BR-3 cells<br>
stained for the Her2 receptor and biotinylated anti-mouse antibody. Novel high-throughput<br><br>
cell-based screening technologies are needed to keep pace with growing compound libraries<br>
and the almost daily discovery of new therapeutic targets. For example, Vitra Biosciences<br>
CellPlex™ card allows for multiplexing of cellular assays. Another approach, which would<br>
allow for versatility in the assay formats, is to encode cells with unique identifiers. This<br>
would allow populations of cells to be studied simultaneously, thereby increasing throughput.<br>
For example, cell type A can be encoded with SACN type 1, cell type B encoded with SACN<br>
type 2, and so forth. These cells can be mixed together prior to the cellular assay being<br>
performed. The cellular assay would be performed using traditional fluorescence methods,<br>
such as GFP. Final analysis would be completed by reading the fluorescence to determine<br>
the outcome of the experiment, and SERS to decode the cell type, using a Raman microscope<br>
or cell sorted with Raman detection. This strategy would allow the study of phenotypes in<br>
mixed cell populations.<br>
[0104]	SACNs may also be used to detect intracellular targets. SACNs may be<br>
introduced into cells via microinjection, electroporation, endocytosis-mediated approaches<br>
including the use of amphipathic peptides such as PEP-1, the use of cationic lipid-based<br>
reagents, such as Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the use of micelles and transfection<br>
reagents such as transferrin, mannose, galactose, and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), and other reagents<br>
such as the dendrimer-based reagent SuperFect (Qiagen). Intracellularly, indirect methods<br>
can be used to prove that the particles are bound to the desired targets. The simplest method<br>
to demonstrate the specificity of the probes is to use immunofluorescence to verify the<br>
location of the SACNs. There are a number of commercially available fluorescent probes that<br>
are useful for labeling cellular structures (such as the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and<br>
endoplasmic reticulum) in living cells. By conjugating an antibody that targets the same<br>
structure, what fraction of particles is actively labeling their larget can be determined; and<br>
what percentage are non-specifically bound. Another approach to verifying the location of<br>
the SACNs is to use fluorescent protein fusions, such as GFP and its analogs.<br>
[0105]	The present invention is directed to imaging agents displaying important<br>
properties in medical diagnosis. More particularly, the present invention is directed to<br>
imaging agents comprising SACNs. The imaging agents of the present invention are useful<br>
in imaging a patient generally, and/or in specifically diagnosing the presence of diseased<br>
tissue in a patient. By choice of composition, the excitation and emission of SACNs can be<br>
tuned to occur between 633 nm and 1000 nra, in the minimum region for absorption and<br>
scattering by tissues. The imaging process may be carried out by administering an imaging<br><br>
agent of the invention to a patient, and then scanning the patient using any system that can<br>
perform spectral imaging, such as spot scanning confocal microscopes, line scanning<br>
systems, and Optical Coherence tomographic systems. SACNs of the present invention can<br>
also be seen by any imaging system that detects only over a single wavelength band, the list<br>
above as well as any fluorescence imaging system that has an excitation light source and<br>
filtered image detection. Other suitable imaging systems and methods are described in<br>
HANDBOOK OF OPTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS, Valery Tuchin editor (2004)<br>
Springer. Also included are time domain methods, such as dynamic light scattering<br>
spectroscopy and tomography, time-of-flight imaging, quasi-elastic light scattering<br>
spectroscopy, photon-correlation spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and diffusion wave<br>
spectroscopy. All these techniques allow differentiation between photons and where they<br>
have been based on their time signatures. Since SACNs will have different time signatures<br>
than fluorescent substances, etc., they can be discriminated against tissues and other labels<br>
with these methods. Useful instrument parameters are a modulated light source and time<br>
sensitive detector. Modulation can be pulsed or continuous.<br>
[0106]	The scanning results in spectra or images of an internal region of a patient<br>
and/or of any diseased tissue in that region. By region of a patient, it is meant the whole<br>
patient, or a particular area or portion of the patient. The imaging agent may be employed to<br>
provide images of the vasculature, heart, liver, and spleen, and in imaging the gastrointestinal<br>
region or other body cavities, or in other ways as will be readily apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art, such as in tissue characterization, blood pool imaging, etc.<br>
[0107]	This invention also provides a method of diagnosing abnormal pathology in<br>
vivo comprising, introducing a plurality of SACNs targeted to a molecule involved in the<br>
abnormal pathology into a bodily fluid contacting the abnormal pathology, wherein the<br>
SACNs become associated to a molecule involved in the abnormal pathology, and imaging<br>
the associated SACNs in vivo. The method is generally applicable to any organ accessible by<br>
the probes: gastro-intestinal tract, heart, lung, liver cervix, breast, etc. In some embodiments,<br>
the SACNs can be introduced via an endoscope, as in the case of a colonoscopy, or a needle,<br>
or used with a disposable tip or sleeve. In other embodiments, the SACNs may be introduced<br>
by directly by the imaging probe itself. For example, individual optical fibers, or bundles of<br>
optical fibers, can be introduced into live organisms for imaging, and has been demonstrated<br>
for imaging of nerves, brain, microvessels, cells, as well as for characterizing biodistribution.<br>
Gel-coaled optical fibers are very well known in the sensor literature. SACNs can be non-<br><br>
covalently bound to the gel, diffusing into the relevant tissue upon introduction. A variety of<br>
other methods to immobilize SACNs onto the outer surface of fibers such that they diffuse<br>
into liquid phases to which they are contacted can be envisioned.<br>
[0108]	In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for labeling an<br>
animal with a SACN, comprising introducing a SACN into an animal. SACNs can be<br>
introduced into animals by any suitable means, such as by subcutaneous implantation or<br>
intravenously, and detected using appropriate equipment (see 15). The present invention also<br>
provides an identification system and related methods for animals such as livestock or house<br>
pets by utilizing a SACN implanted under the hide or skin to identify the animal.<br>
[0109]	It should be noted that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the<br>
invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art<br>
without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to<br>
embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances which fall within the scope of the<br>
disclosed invention.<br>

Example I<br>
[0214]	A typical synthesis of ~ 45 nm diameter Au colloid using a combination of<br>
sodium borohydride, sodium citrate, and hydroxylamine hydrochloride is described. All<br>
glassware are washed with aqua regia and rigorously rinsed with 18 MΩ water. The reactions<br>
are carried out in a cold room. Solutions of 0.01% (w/w) HAuCl4 3H2O in water, 8% (w/w)<br>
sodium citrate dihydrate in 0.01 N NaOH, 10-4% sodium borohydride in 0.01 N NaOH, and<br><br>
400 mM hydroxylamine hydrochloride in water, are prepared. A mixture of citrate and<br>
borohydride solutions is then prepared by combining 1 mL of the sodium citrate solution with<br>
100 uL of the sodium borohydride solution and 500 uL of 0.01 N NaOH. After preparing<br>
this mixture 200 uL of the hydroxylamine solution is injected into 100 mL of the HAuCl4<br>
solution in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and briefly stirred. After 20 minutes the<br>
borohydride/citrate mixture is injected into the rapidly stirring solution of HAuCl4; and<br>
hydroxylamine. Best results are obtained when the mixture is injected midway between the<br>
center of the stirring vortex and the wall of the flask.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0215]	Preparation of Gold Nanoparticles. Stock solutions of HauCl43H2O are<br>
prepared at either 1 % or 2% concentration (w/v) in H2O. These solutions are filtered through<br>
0.2 µm membranes before being placed in the cold room. The bottles containing the stock<br>
solutions are also typically covered in aluminum foil to reduce exposure to light. The<br>
following solutions are typically prepared:<br>
1.	1.0L of 0.02% HauCI4 in H2O.<br>
2.	5 mL 32% (w/v) sodium citrate dehydrate in 0.01 N NaOH.<br>
3.	10 mL 1.6 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride in H2O.<br>
4.	10 mL of 4% (w/v) NaBH4 in 1.0 N NaOH which is prepared by dilution<br>
of the stock solution.<br>
[0216]	All reactions are carried out in a cold room after allowing solutions to reach the<br>
temperature of the room. The HauCl4 solution is placed in a 2 L round bottom flask and a<br>
glass stirring rod with Teflon paddle is inserted into the flask to provide stirring. 1.0 mL of<br>
the hyrdroxylamine solution is added to the flask and stirred. Immediately after the addition<br>
of the hydroxylamine a solution of 4 x 10"4% NaBH4 is prepared by serial dilution of the 4%<br>
stock. These dilutions are made in 0.01N NaOH. Then, 1 mL of 32% sodium citrate is<br>
mixed with 525 µL of 0.01 N NaOH and 75 µL of 4 x I0"1 % NaBH4. At 20 minutes after the<br>
addition of hydroxylamine l .0 mL of the citrate/borohydride mixture is added to the reaction<br>
flask while it is being stirred rapidly.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0217]	SERS Spectra of SACNs tagged with both 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MP) and<br>
trans-4, 4'-bis(pyridyl)ethylene (BPE).<br><br>
[0218]	Materials: Water used for all preparations was 18.2 MQ. distilled through a<br>
Barnstead nanopure system. 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), HAuCl43H2O<br>
trisodium citrate dihydrate, sodium hydroxide, sodium borohydride, hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride, trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (BPE), 4-mercaptopyridine, sodium silicate,<br>
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethyl alcohol, and 2.0 M ammonia in ethanol were obtained<br>
from Sigma-Aldrich. BPE was recrystallized before use.<br>
[0219]	Colloid preparation: 35-nm colloidal Au was prepared from HAuCl4*3H2O.<br>
Aqueous solutions of 4% sodium citrate and 400 mM hydroxylamine hydrochloride were<br>
prepared immediately prior to synthesis, as was a solution of 10"2% sodium borohydride in<br>
0.001 N NaOH. A 300 U.L aliquot of this borohydride solution was mixed with 500 U.L of the<br>
citrate and 350 U.L of the hydroxylamine and immediately injected into 200 mL of 0.01 %<br>
HAuCl4 under vigorous stirring. The size of the resulting particles was determined by<br>
transmission electron microscopy using Image J software.<br>
[0220]	SACNs preparation: All reactions were performed in plastic flasks. A typical<br>
experiment used 30 ml of 35-nm colloid. The colloid was rendered vitreophilic with the<br>
addition 40uL of 1.0 mM APTMS and allowed to stir for 15 minutes. The Raman label<br>
mixture (600 u,L of 10"5 M 4-mercaptopyridine and 50 U.L of 10'5 M BPE) was added to the<br>
solution, which was then stirred for 15 additional minutes. Finally, 1.2 mL of 0.54% sodium<br>
silicate was added and allowed to react for 42 hours. After this time 120 mL of EtOH was<br>
added to the solution, followed by 1 mL of 2 M ammonia (in ethanol) and 20 uL of<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). This reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 day before<br>
purifying via centrifugation. This amount of TEOS varied, if a thinner or thicker shell is<br>
desired.<br>
[0221 ]	The resulting SACNs had a mixture of two different species of Raman-active<br>
molecules, 4-MP and BPE, in a 12:1 ratio. SERS spectra of these 4-MP/BPE-SACNs<br>
obtained using 633 nm excitation (Trace A) and 785 nm excitation (Trace B) are plotted in<br>
Figure 6. For comparison, the characteristic Raman spectra of BPE-SACNs (dashed line) and<br>
4-MP-SACNs (solid line) are plotted in Figure 7. It can be seen that features of the 4^MP<br>
Raman signal dominate the spectrum of the 4-MP/BPE-SACNs obtained using 785 nm<br>
excitation while features of both BPE and 4-MP Raman signals are evident in the spectrum<br>
obtained using 633 nm excitation. Thus, by careful choice of two or more different species of<br>
Raman-active molecules, and their relative ratios, it is possible to prepare SACNs that<br><br>
provide different Raman scattering spectra depending on the excitation wavelength. This<br>
allows an additional level of multiplexing capability.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0222]	Preparation of thiol-active SACNs<br>
[0223]	A. Silica Modification: The silica shell of the SACNs can be functionalized to<br>
bear free sulfhydryl groups either during the course of making the SiO2 shell ("direct<br>
modification"), or after the shell has been completely formed ("post-modification").<br>
[0224]	B. Post-Modification: Prepare a 50 mL batch of SACNs according to standard<br>
protocols. Proceed through all stages of silica growth, except that the SACNs should be<br>
resuspended to only 10 mL in water after the final centrifugation. Assuming negligible<br>
losses, this leaves the SACNs at a 5x concentration from the original colloid. Add 40 mL of<br>
ethanol to the SACNs. Under moderate magnetic stirring, add 1 mL concentrated NH4OH<br>
(30%, J.T. Baker #9733-01). While this is stirring, make a solution that is 900 uL ethanol, 95<br>
uL tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Sigma #333859) and 5 uL (3-<br>
mereaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS, Fluka #63800). Add 100 uL of this mixture<br>
(effectively 9.5 uLTEOS and 0.5 uL MPTMS) to the stirring SACNs, and allow the reaction<br>
to proceed overnight. Purify by repeated centrifugation. Spin down and resuspend the pellet<br>
in water a minimum of 3 times to ensure complete removal of ethanol and excess reagents.<br>
Resuspend to 5 mL (lOx) after the final spin.<br>
[0225]	C. Direct Modification: Again, begin to prepare a 50 mL batch of SACNs<br>
using typical conditions. The only change is during the Stober growth step. As before, add 1<br>
ml. of concentrated NH4OH and stir for 5 minutes. Then, mix 47.5 uL of TEOS with 2.5 uL<br>
of MPTMS, and add them to the tags. Stir overnight and purify by centrifugation,<br>
resuspending the purified tags to 5 mL (lOx).<br>
Example 5<br>
[0226]	Bioconjugation of SACNs<br>
[0227]	With thiol-activated SACNs, biomolecules are attached using the<br>
heterobifunclional cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[N-rnaleimidoinethyl]cycIohexane-l-<br>
carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc). This molecule contains both a<br>
maleimide group that is reactive toward sulfhydryls and a sulfo-NHS ester that preferentially<br>
reacts with primary amines. In this case, a simple one-pot reaction can used to attach<br><br>
streptavidin, and should be readily adaptable to attachment of most proteins or other<br>
molecules that bear primary amines.<br>
[0228]	Tags may be concentrated prior to conjugation. To conjugate to thiol-activated<br>
tags as described above, first add 0.25 mg of streptavidin to 5 mL of 2 mM PBS buffer (0.54<br>
mM KCI, 27.6 mM NaCI, pH = 7.4). Add the thiol-activated tags (5 mL at lOx<br>
concentration) and mix well. Next, weigh out I mg of sulfo-SMCC and add it to the tags and<br>
SAv. Immediately mix by vortexing, and react for 1 hour while rotating at room temperature.<br>
After 1 hour tags are purified by centrifugation, and resuspension in 2 mM PBS buffer. A<br>
small amount (0.1 % final concentration) of BSA may be added to minimize the sticking of<br>
particles to the centrifuge walls. While this reaction utilizes streptavidin, other proteins<br>
(including antibodies) have been conjugated using similar methods. If more control over the<br>
reaction is necessary, the protein can be "pre-activated" to adding it to the tags. Because the<br>
maleimide group of sulfo-SMCC is quite stable in aqueous solutions (-60 hours),<br>
biomolecules can be activated by reaction with sulfo-SMCC for 30-120 minutes followed by<br>
purification on a desalting column. This essentially creates a maleimide-activated<br>
biomoleeule that can be directly added to sulfhydryl-bearing SACBs.<br>
[0229]	For avidin, analogues (including streptavidin and NeutrAvidin™), and the<br>
fluorescent biocytin Alexa Fluor® 594 (Molecular Probes # A12922; "biocytin-594") can be<br>
used to quantitale the number of biomolecules bound to the SACNs. The strong visible<br>
absorption of the SACNs suggests use of this highly sensitive fluorescent detection rather<br>
than using common colurimetric methods (including biotinylated horseradish peroxidase) for<br>
streptavidin quantitation. This red-excited dye is useful in a region where the colloidal<br>
particles have little absorption which might interfere with measurements. All fluorescence<br>
measurements were made using a Fluorolog-3 from Jobin Yvon - Spex.<br>
[0230]	To alleviate concerns that the highly absorbing SACNs may influence<br>
fluorescence measurements, the experiment has been carried out in two different forms. The<br>
first is the most straightforward; biofunctionalized particles were incubated in with the<br>
biocytin-594 for a given amount of time (nominally 2 hours, protected from light to avoid<br>
photobleaching). Tags are then purified by repeated centrifugation (2 times is sufficient if the<br>
amount of dye is carefully controlled), and their fluorescence is measured.<br>
[0231]	The converse to taking direct fluorescence measurements from the tags is to<br>
measure the amount of fluorescent molecules that do not bind to the tags. Again, tags are<br>
incubated in a carefully chosen amount of dye, and centrifuged just one time. The<br><br>
supernatant is carefully collected and measured for fluorescence. The amount of dye that has<br>
bound to the particles can then be determined by subtraction of this value from the known<br>
original concentration of dye. One important item to note is that non-stick microcentrifuge<br>
tubes (Corning Costar) were used, as the biocytin Alexa Fluor® 594 adsorbs rapidly to the<br>
walls of regular tubes. Similar protocols can be used with fluorescently-labeled secondary<br>
antibodies if the particles are conjugated to antibodies instead of avidin analogues.<br>
[0232]	These quantitation methods have been used to show that the amount of a given<br>
biomolecule conjugated to the tags can be controlled by adding in another reactive molecule.<br>
In Figure 8, the number of biotin molecules that were bound to nanoparticles conjugated with<br>
varying ratios of NeutrAvidin™ and bovine serum albumin (BSA) is shown. Conjugation<br>
conditions were equivalent for all reactions, with the ratio of biomolecules being the only<br>
variable.<br>
[0233]	As expected, higher amounts of BSA lead to lower levels of bound biotin.<br>
Assuming that each NeutrAvidin™ (NAv) is capable of binding 2 biotins (conjugation to the<br>
particle is likely to block some amount of the 4 binding sites), there are up to 300-400<br>
NeutrAvidin™ molecules bound to each tag. But, measurement of the pure BS A-con jugated<br>
particles, the calculations show less than 10 biocytin-594 molecules bound on each<br>
nanoparticle. This is consistent with very low levels of non-specific binding that would be<br>
expected by conjugation of BSA (a common blocking reagent) to the particles.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0234]	Non-specific binding characteristics<br>
[0235]	As a first characterization step a simple experiment was devised to determine if<br>
the streptavidin-coated SACNs could specifically bind biotinylated-BSA. Eight wells of a<br>
polystyrene microwell plate were coaled with either biotinylated-BSA or BSA by incubating<br>
with a 0.5% solution in PBS for thirty minutes. All wells were then washed 4 times with PBS<br>
for 1 minute, and then blocked for 30 minutes with a PBS buffer containing I mM EDTA,<br>
0.1 % BSA and 0.01 % Zwittergent 3-08. After aspirating the blocking solution from each<br>
well, 20 uL of sample and 20 uL of PBS were added and incubated for 2 hours. The samples<br>
comprised neutravidin (NAv)-coated SACNs, streptavidin (SAv)-coated SACNs, SACNs that<br>
had been thiol modified (but not conjugated) and control tags with no functionalization of the<br>
silica coating. Wells were washed with blocking buffer for 15 minutes, followed by PBS (3 x<br>
5 min) and water (3 x I min). They were allowed to dry, and the amount of bound tag was<br><br>
quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a microwell plate reader (data-not<br>
shown). Values were background subtracted based on the average absorbance of wells that<br>
had not been treated. The NAv and SAv tags bound wjth high specificity to the biotin coated<br>
wells and exhibited little non-specific binding to BSA-coated wells. However, the thiol-<br>
coated tags and standard silica-coated tags showed low levels of binding to all wells.<br>
Subsequent experiments have shown that this phenomenon can be avoided by blocking the<br>
particles by adding a small amount of BS A to the particles, centrifuging and resuspending in<br>
PBS. After determining that the SAv- and NAv-conjugated tags were specific for biotin, the<br>
number of biotin binding sites that were present on each tag was measured by two methods.<br>
A fluorescent biotin analogue, biocytin Alexa Fluor® 594, was reacted with the SACNs.<br>
After appropriate wash steps, the number of bound fluorophores was determined by direct<br>
measurement and by fluorescence depletion. The values obtained by the two methods were<br>
consistent (Figure 12), although direct fluorescence measurements always produced a lower<br>
number. The average number of bound biotins was approximately 700 per nanoparticle<br>
under optimal reaction conditions.<br>

terminated oligonucleotides to thiol-modified SACNs. After attachment and purification, a<br>
dye-labeled complementary strand was incubated with the modified particles. Quantitation of<br>
the fluorescent probe (after centrifugation to remove unbound probe) indicated that about 15<br>
oligonucleotides were bound to each nanoparticle. Oligonucleotides were directly attached to<br>
NAv-tags, in which the oligonucleotides had a biotin group at one end for attachment to the<br>
tag and a fluorophore at the other, to allow a direct measurement of conjugation efficiency.<br>
This also yielded approximately 15 oligonucleotides conjugated per nanoparticle. Amine-<br>
modified SACNs were coupled to thiol-terminated fluorescent oligonucleotides using the<br>
same sulfo-SMCC chemistry described above, again with similar results.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0238]	Two characteristics that are desired of quantitative optical tags are that they<br>
respond linearly to the excitation source and that they are relatively unaffected by long-term<br>
exposure to excitation. The first quality has been demonstrated with SACNs by exposing a<br><br>
sample to various amounts of excitation power and measuring the resulting signal. These<br>
results are shown in Figure 9.<br>
[0239]	To demonstrate photostability a sample of SACN was deposited on a quartz<br>
slide and placed in the sample holder of a Raman spectrometer. For this experiment the<br>
spectrometer delivered 60 mW of power at 647.1 nm. The emitted light was collected<br>
through a 50 x 0.8 NA microscope objective, passed through a holographic notch filter to<br>
reject Rayleigh scattering, focused into a 0.5 m monochromalor and detected with a liquid<br>
nitrogen cooled CCD. Spectra were collected approximately every hour for 6 hours during<br>
which time the sample was continuously illuminated. The signal from the sample is plotted<br>
as a function of time in Figure 10. This data shows that these particles are quite stable, with<br>
only a 20% loss in signal over 6 hours.<br>
[0240]	Thermal stability of the SACNs is also desirable. To demonstrate this, two<br>
batches of 1.5 X BPE SACNs (in 35 mL) were boiled for one hour. (The tags were<br>
concentrated from 50 mL down to 35 mL, to approx 1.5X concentration. UV-Vis and SERS<br>
spectra were recorded before and after boiling. The small differences in absorbance and<br>
SERS before and after boiling are mostly attributable to slight difference in concentration.<br>
The SACNs are essentially not affected by boiling.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0241]	Evidence of batch to batch reproducibility<br>
[0242]	To determine the reproducibility of making tags from start to finish of the<br>
process, a total of 6 colloids were made and were labeled B-G. These colloids were used to<br>
prepare a total of 13 different batches of tags, using identical protocols for each batch. The<br>
(normalized) absorption spectra of these colloids are shown in Figure 11, and it is apparent<br>
that they are quite similar after all steps are complete.<br>
[0243]	After normalizing the concentration by equilibrating the optical density of each<br>
solution to 1.0, the SERS response was measured using 785 nm excitation. SERS signals<br>
were monitored at the major peak (~l200 cm'1) (not shown). Using all samples, the RSD of<br>
the group is 12.5%. If one significant outlier is removed, the remaining twelve samples<br>
exhibit an RSD of 7.5%.,<br><br>
Example 10<br>
[0244]	A. Preparation of anisotropic nanorods with diameter 18-90 nm<br>
[0245]	Commercially available templates, with different pore size (18 nm to 90 nm)<br>
were used for electrodeposition of anisotropic Au nanorods. Evaporated Ag, about 1 nm<br>
thick, served as a plating substrate. Immediately before electrodeposition the template was<br>
assembled into the electrochemical cell and soaked in Ag-plating solution under house<br>
vacuum for 1 hr for ensuring proper wetting of the pores, followed by electrodeposition into<br>
the pores of 1 urn thick fresh Ag. Subsequently the electrodeposition of nanowires consisting<br>
of alternating Au and Ag stripes occurred. Commercial plating solutions were used: Cyless<br>
Silver (Technic, Inc.) and Microfab Au 100 (Sulfite-based Au-solution from Enthone-OMI,<br>
Inc.). The length of the Au segments was determined by the desired aspect ratio of the Au<br>
nanorods; the length of the Ag segments could be in the range of 10-200 nm; the total number<br>
of stripes per pore was determined by the desired Final (after release from template)<br>
concentration of Au nanorods/ml solution.<br>
[0246]	Different plating techniques were used depending on template pore diameter.<br>
For pore diameter of 65 nm and 90 nm , a semi-automated synthesizer for Nanobarcodes<br>
particles was used in constant current mode. Plating of AuAg-nanowires with 59 stripes<br>
(each stripe 30 nm long) sequentially plated into one template leading after Ag-rcmoval to 3<br>
x 10" Au nanorods/template has been demonstrated.<br>
[0247]	A release protocol was developed starting with the dissolution of the Ag<br>
(substrate and Ag-stripes) in Nitric acid, followed by template dissolution in NaOH. To<br>
prevent dumpiness of the released Au nanorods a short SAM-molecule (self-assembled<br>
monolayer) was added to the NaOH during template dissolution. Examples for short thiol-<br>
containing molecules are mercaptoethanol (ME), mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and<br>
mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESA). These short molecules were later replaced with the<br>
Raman reporter molecule. An alternative method which produced better results was to<br>
introduce the Raman reporter molecule directly to the NaOH during template dissolution. 4-<br>
Mercaptophenol (MP) and 2-quinolinethiol (QSH) were successfully used and demonstrated<br>
Raman signal with Au nanorods. Figure 12 shows the Raman spectra of 65 x 30 nm and 90 x<br>
30 nm Au particles released in QSH . Figure 13 illustrates the Raman spectra of 65x 30 nm<br>
and 90 x 30 nm Au particles released in MP.<br>
[0248]	The constant current mode of electrodeposition was not efficacious for<br>
templates with pore diameter of 35nin and less. Different pulse plating techniques (pulse<br><br>
current, reverse pulse current and double pulse) may be used. Using polycarbonate templates<br>
with hole diameter in the submicron range, reverse current electrodeposition with ultrasonic<br>
agitation has been applied successfully to grow Au single-crystals from cyanide solutions.<br>
However, polycrystalline Au was deposited from Au-sulfite solutions using a variety of<br>
reverse pulse conditions: Dobrev, D; Vetter, J.; Angert, N.; Neumann. R.; Electrochimica<br>
Acta 2000, 45, 3117-3125. It has been shown earlier that pulsed potentiostatic deposition<br>
from Au -sulfite solution improved the metal distribution onto photoresist patterned<br>
structures but didn't strongly influence the properties (stress, purity, resistance) of the Au-<br>
films, which was explained by the irreversibility of Au/Au(I) couple in sulfite solutions:<br>
Horkans. J.; Romankiw, L.T.; J. Electrochem. Soc. 1977, 124, 1499-1505...<br>
[0249]	The pulse parameters (pulse current, frequency and duty cycle) have been<br>
varied in such manner that the average plating current was somewhat low (0.25-1 mA/sqcm)<br>
to ensure a slow growth of the Au and Ag stripes. Successful plating was achieved at the<br>
following pulse plating conditions: pulse current of 2 mA/sqcm; frequency range 0.025 - 2.5<br>
Hz and duty cycle 0.1-0.3. The same pulse conditions were used for both Au and Ag-stripes<br>
within one experiment. A Multichannel Potentiosiat/Galvanoslat (Princeton Applied<br>
Research) was used; after plating of each stripe the solution was changed followed by rinse<br>
and refill with the next solution manually. Plating of 19 alternating Au/Ag stripes yielding,<br>
after Ag-removal, 3xEl 1 Au nanorods/tcmplate(35nm pore diameter) and lxE12 Au<br>
nanorods/template (18 nm pore diameter) has been demonstrated. Automation of the pulse<br>
plating may further increase the number of panicles by another order of magnitude because<br>
the template thickness is 50 urn. Figure 14 shows a TEM image of Au nanorods with 35 nm<br>
diameter, released in ME and the Raman spectrum of the nanorods after replacement of ME<br>
with QSH.<br>
B. Preparation of anisotropic Au particles of 250 nm x 250 nm.<br>
[0250]	250 nm x 250 nm Au particles were prepared similar to the particles in part A.<br>
Alumina templates with pore size 250 nm were used for electrodeposition of Au<br>
nanoparticles. Evaporated Ag, about I urn thick, served as a plating substrate. Fresh Ag, 5 nm<br>
thick, was electrodeposited into the holes for additional sealing of the template, followed by<br>
sequential electrodeposition of nanowires consisting of alternating Au and Ag stripes, each<br>
250 nm long. Commercial plating solutions were used: Cyless Silver (Technic, Inc.) and<br>
Microfab Au 100 (Enthone-OMl, Inc.). A semi-automated synthesizer for Nanobarcodes<br>
particles was used for plating of 9 Au and Ag-stripes, each at a const current of 1 mA. A<br><br>
release protocol was developed starting with the dissolution of the Ag (substrate and Ag-<br>
stripes) in Nitric acid, followed by template dissolution in Sodium Hydroxide. To prevent<br>
dumpiness of the released Au nanoparticles a thiol- Raman reporter molecule, 4-<br>
Mercaptophenol (MP), pre-dissolved in Ethanol (EtOH) was introduced to the Sodium<br>
Hydroxide during release. The release steps were as follows:<br>
[0251]	1. 12 ml 40% HN03, 6()min<br>
[0252]	2. 2ml 28mM MP/EtOH + 8ml 3M NaOH/20%EtOH/80%H2O, 30min<br>
[0253]	3. 200 pi 28mM MP/EtOH + 800 ul 3M NaOH/20%EtOH/80%H,O,<br>
30min<br>
[0254]	4. Centrifuge: 4200 rpm, 2min<br>
[0255]	5. 3x rinse 200 ul MP/EtOH + 800 ul EtOH/H2O (1:4)<br>
[0256]	6. Centrifuge: 4200 rpm, lmin after each<br>
[0257]	SEM/TEM sample, 10 ul each<br>
[0258]	7. 0.1 ml sample: dilute to 1 ml with H2O for UV-vis<br>
[0259]	8. 2x rinse H2O, centrifuge at 6200 rpm, 10 min each<br>
[0260]	9. Acquire Raman<br>
The concentration of Au-particles after the release was 5x10 /ml. The gold particles were re-<br>
suspended in Ethanol and a 300 uL aliquot was taken for glass coating. 490 uL Ethanol, 160<br>
uL 18 M water, 10 uL 30% Ammonium Hydroxide, and 40 uL neatTetraethylorthosilicate<br>
(TEOS) were added to the aliquot of gold particles. The sample was sonicated and placed on<br>
a vortexer at the lowest setting to mix for 45 minutes. The sample was then rinsed three times<br>
in 18 M water. Figure 15A and B show SEM images for the resulting anisotropic particles.<br>
Figure 16A and B show a closer view of a single particle. Raman spectra of the particles are<br>
shown in Figure 17A and B.<br>
Example 11<br>
[0261]	IL7 Sandwich Immunoassay<br>
[0262]	A protein microarray experiment was simulated by printing capture IL-7<br>
antibodies onto a microarray slide. Each spot was approximately 500 urn on a side, and<br>
repeated six times on each glass substrate (printed by Telechem, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). A<br>
hydrophobic pen was used to provide a liquid barrier on the glass slide so each of the six<br>
spots may be treated independently. After the pen dried, the slide was blocked for at least 60<br>
minutes with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br><br>
All incubation and wash steps were carried out on an orbital rocker or shaker, and solutions<br>
were aspirated by pipette prior to addition of new solutions. After blocking, slides were<br>
washed 3 times for 5 minutes each (3x5) with 0.5% BSA/PBS. Antigens were prepared in a<br>
0.5% BSA/PBS solution and incubated on the arrays for 45 minutes to 2 hours, after which<br>
arrays were once again washed (3x5) in 0.5% BSA/ PBS. IL7-modified SACNs (using<br>
biotinylated antibodies onto neutravidin coated SACNs) were then incubated on the arrays for<br>
90 minutes. This was followed by a wash (3x5) in 0.5% BSA/PBS and quick rinses in PBS<br>
and water. Slides were blown dry by a jet of nitrogen gas immediately after the water rinse.<br>
Raman spectra from these arrays were acquired using a diode laser (785 nm, 200 mW) and an<br>
Ocean Optics USB-2000 spectrometer and software. The typical integration time for spectra<br>
acquired on glass arrays was two seconds. Background subtraction was used to remove the<br>
broad glass background from all spectra. Without optimization, a limit of detection between<br>
10-100 pg/ml (Figure 18) was achieved, which is comparable to many commercial enzyme<br>
immunoassays. The potential for multiplex assays was then demonstrated, by probing three<br>
different analytes (ovalbumin, bacillus globigii, and C-reactive protein) on adjacent spots of a<br>
protein chip. Antibodies to each antigen were conjugated to SACNs with different reporter<br>
molecules giving BPE-anti Bg, QSH-anti Ova, and Bodipy-anti CRP particles. An array of<br>
spots containing capture antibodies to the antigens was exposed to a mixture of all three<br>
antigens. After appropriate rinsing the spots were exposed to all three detection SACNs.<br>
Raman spectra were then collected from each of the spots. The data show a clean signal at<br>
each spot, with the spot that was designed to capture CRP giving a strong Bodipy tag signal,<br>
for example.<br>
Example 12<br>
[0263]	A lateral How immunoassay for Bot tox was undertaken, using Tetracore,<br>
Inc.'s (Gaithersburg, MD) lateral flow cartridge. In this experiment, the device was opened,<br>
removed the pad containing their colorimetric detection reagent (which comprises colloidal<br>
Au conjugated to a detection Ab), and replaced it with a conjugate comprising SACNs<br>
conjugated to the same Ab (provided by Tetracore). Raman spectra were collected using the<br>
instrument previously described. The data show minimal non-specific binding, and successful<br>
capture of the conjugate in the presence of antigen, with a non-optimized limit of detection<br>
similar to their commercial product. Results are shown in Figure 19.<br><br>
Example 13<br>
[0264]	Staining of SK-BR3 cells with SACNs<br>
[0265]	Cells were cultured on a chamber slide. Cells were washed with PBS three<br>
times, 1 min each. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS lor 10 min at room<br>
temperature, and washed as before. Cells were blocked with 1 % BSA/PBS for 20 min at<br>
room temperature. Cells were incubated with 1 ug/ml mouse anti-her2 antibodies (diluted<br>
with block buffer) for 30 min at room temperature, then washed as above. Cells were then<br>
incubated with lug/ml biotinylated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. and washed as before. The<br>
cells were incubated with 50 ul of 2X streptavidin conjugated SACN at room temperature for<br>
1 hr, and washed as before. Hoechest dye (diluted 1:500) was added and the cells incubated<br>
for 5 minutes. The cells were washed as before. The cells were mounted with a coverslip<br>
using 90% glycerol in PBS, and the edges were sealed with nail polish. Figure 21A shows<br>
bright field and SERS images of the resulting sample, and demonstrate binding of SACNs to<br>
specific locations on the cell surface and the cell interior.<br>
Example 14<br>
[0266]	Detection of SACNs in tissue samples.<br>
[0267]	SACNs particles can also be detected in the presence of tissue samples stained<br>
with strongly colored organic dyes. For example, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) are the<br>
standard dyes used to visualize cell size and shape. Both molecules exhibit fluorescence in<br>
the visible, making use of conventional immunohistochemical methods on the same sample<br>
difficult or impossible. However, with 785 nm excitation, a minimal background is obtained,<br>
rendering the SACNs easily visualizable. Thus, a mouse tissue array from Zymed was<br>
treated with H&amp;E according to standard histopathology protocols, resulting in highly colored<br>
spots. Several spots were treated with polylysine and then BPE SACNs. Figure 21B shows<br>
Raman spectra from untreated and treated spots, indicating the ease with which SACNs can<br>
be seen over a background of H&amp;E stains. Accordingly, the present invention provides 1. A<br>
method, comprising contacting a tissue sample with at least one biomolecule-conjugated<br>
SACN particle capable of specifically binding to the tissue sample; and acquiring a Raman<br>
image of the tissue/biomolecule-conjugated SACN particles mixture. The tissue is contacted<br>
with one or more additional non-SACN reagents, usch as cosin, hemotoxylin, and a<br>
combination of hemotoxylin and eosin. Background Raman image of a tissue sample may be<br>
obtained and subtracted from the Raman image of the tissue/biomolecule-conjugated SACN<br><br>
particles mixture. Additionally, the Raman image may further be compared with the Raman<br>
image with an image of a tissue sample which has been stained with strongly colored organic<br>
dyes to visualize cell size and shape, such as an H&amp;E stain.<br>
Example 15<br>
[0268]	In vivo labeling of animals with SACNs.<br>
[0269]	SACNs were injected into nude mice in 2 ways: a) by tail injection for<br>
circulation in the blood stream; and b) by subcutaneous injection for localization under the<br>
skin. In both cases the optical probe was held over the skin and the Raman signal detected<br>
emitted from below the skin. The peaks of the SACNs could be seen above the background.<br>
The portable detection system had a 785 nm laser for excitation manufactured by Ahura<br>
Corp. 106mW of light was delivered to the specimen via an optical fiber and optical head<br>
manufacture by InPhotonics Inc. Raman scattered light was detected by the same optical<br>
head. A dichroic filter sends the collected light to a second optical fiber, attached to a<br>
spectrometer, Ocean Optics USB2000,with a 50-micron slit and 1200 grooves/mm grating<br>
blazed at 750nm. The spectrometer data was collected by a laptop computer.<br>
[0270] In the case of a) signal was detected at approximately 45 minutes. At this time a<br>
signal was detected when the probe was held over the mouse liver, Figure 22. The SERS tag<br>
spectrumappears on a background that is a mixutre of tissue fluorescence and Rayleigh back<br>
scatter. The actual backround measured depends on the probe position over the skin. If the<br>
probe is in contact with the skin, then the spectra may contain more tissue fluorescence. If<br>
the probe is offset from the skin, the spectra may contain more Rayleigh backscatter. For<br>
example, in the case of a spectrum acquired at the liver, and a spectrum acquired at the flank<br>
of the mouse, the backgrounds are different. Since the backgournd can vary, SACNs have an<br>
advantage since the tags can be quantified by the peak height over background.<br>
[0271]	In the case of b) the signal was detected immediately after injection, as shown<br>
in Figure 23. Figure 23 also contains a spectrum taken from a mouse with no SACN,<br>
acquired at the flank. The signal would diminish over lime as the tag diffused into the body of<br>
the mouse. The^subcutaneous spectrum also contains some background fluorescence and<br>
Rayleigh scatter, however the SACN signal is much stronger over the background.<br>
Example 16<br>
[0272]	Multiplexed cellular imaging experiments.<br><br>
[0273]	The cell line LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive, adherent cell line derived from a<br>
human prostate carcinoma, will be used. LNCaP cells are available from ATCC (Rockville,<br>
MD). LNCaP cells are excellent models for prostate cancer. There are a number of<br>
commercially available antibodies to biomarkers that are known to be important in prostate<br>
cancer, such as alpha-melhylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) and Prostate Specific Antigen<br>
(PSA). Other antibodies useful as markers or controls include antibodies to CDH1,<br>
CTNNB1, CCND1, HPN, TP53, CDKN1B, and BCL2.<br>
[0274]	Antibodies to these markers will be conjugated to SACNs. Cellular labeling<br>
and imaging experiments in which LNCaP cells are treated with various compounds and<br>
conditions will be performed. The effect on the cell viability, and the spatial localization of<br>
the antibody conjugated SACNs will be monitored.<br>
[0275]	SACNs conjugated to both AMACR antibodies and PSA antibodies will be<br>
used to compare protein expression of AMACR and PSA in the cell lines LNCaP, DU-145<br>
and PC-3 as detailed by Kuefer, et a!., Am J Pathol 2002, 161, 841-48. Cells will be treated<br>
with bicalutamide, an oral medication from the anti-androgen class of prescription drug<br>
treatments for prostate cancer. LNCaP, a hormone-sensitive tumor cell line, demonstrates<br>
stronger AMACR expression by Western blot analysis than do cell lines DU-145 and PC-3.<br>
Upon treating the LNCaP cells with bicalutamide, the AMACR protein expression in cells<br>
remains unchanged, whereas prostate-specific antigen, known to be androgen-regulated,<br>
demonstrates decreased protein expression. Spatial localization of the SACNs will be<br>
performed. In intracellular imaging, unlike surface labeling experiments, it is not possible to<br>
wash away unbound tags. These experiments will therefore allow us to understand what<br>
happens to excess SACNs that are not bound to a specific target within the cell (for example,<br>
if that target is down-regulated, such as PSA in this assay).<br>

published a study of the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an over-the-counter<br>
dietary supplement, on the gene and protein expression of LNCaP cells. They found that<br>
DHEA affected cell proliferation and increased the protein expression of PSA as well as a<br>
number of IGF receptors. Using SACNs conjugated to PSA antibodies, and antibodies<br>
indicative of cell growth in cancer cells, such as CCND1 (cyclin Dl), this biological system<br>
will be investigated. The cells will be treated with DHEA, testosterone, rctinoic acid, and<br>
17beta-estradiol (E2), and compare the cellular imaging results with those reported by Arnold<br>
et al.<br><br>
