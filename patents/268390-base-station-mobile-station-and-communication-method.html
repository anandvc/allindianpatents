BASE STATION, MOBILE STATION AND<br>
COMMUNICATIONS METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to<br>
a technical field of radio communications,<br>
specifically to a base station, a mobile station, and<br>
a communications method that can be used in various<br>
bands.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In existing communications systems of<br>
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA),<br>
Global System for Mobile communications, and the like,<br>
a center frequency of frequency bands used for<br>
communications is determined to coincide with a<br>
predetermined frequency called a raster or a frequency<br>
raster. The frequency rasters are arranged, for<br>
example, every 200 kHz on a frequency axis.<br>
Therefore, a mobile station can identify the<br>
center frequency of an operator and thus connect to a<br>
downlink by searching for the frequency rasters by turns<br>
on the frequency axis (searching every 200 kHz) .<br>
Downlink cell search is described in Keiji TACHIKAWA,<br>
"W-CDMA mobile communications method", Maruzen, Inc.,<br>
pp. 35-45.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
A radio communications system based on an<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)<br><br>
method that uses plural wide or narrow bands has been<br>
in consideration. The OFDM method is employed because<br>
this method can provide advantages of efficiently<br>
suppressing multi-path propagation interference,<br>
inter-symbol interference, and the like. In such radio<br>
communications systems, a wideband of, for example, 20<br>
MHz and a band (for example, 5 MHz), which is a part<br>
of the wideband, are used depending on an apparatus<br>
configuration of the mobile station, an apparatus<br>
configuration of the base station, applications, and<br>
the like, which allows various operators to provide<br>
service.<br>
For example, spectra in the OFDM method<br>
radio communications system having plural bands are<br>
shown in FIG. 1. Communications based on the OFDM<br>
method can be carried out in both the wide transmission<br>
band of 20 MHz and the narrow transmission band of 5<br>
MHz in relation to the transmission bandwidth of 20 MHz.<br>
In such radio communications systems, there<br>
exist terminal devices having a receivable bandwidth<br>
that is narrower than the transmission bandwidth of the<br>
base station. For example, a terminal device having<br>
a receivable bandwidth of 5 MHz carries out<br>
communications using a frequency band including a<br>
center frequency of the wide bandwidth of 20 MHz.<br>
The objective of the present invention is<br>
to provide a base station, a mobile station and a<br>
transmission method that facilitate peripheral cell<br>
detection in a mobile transmission system where the OFDM<br>
method of communications is carried out in any one of<br>
two or more frequency bands.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br><br>
In order to eliminate the above disadvantage,<br>
a base station according to an embodiment of the present<br>

frequency band out of a transmission band, the base<br>
station including an allocation portion that allocates<br>
for a mobile station performing peripheral cell search<br>
a band that includes a center frequency on a raster of<br>
a first band and has a bandwidth equal to or wider than<br>
a bandwidth of a second band with which a<br>
synchronization channel is transmitted.<br>
With such a configuration, the mobile<br>
station can carry out the peripheral cell search using<br>
the band including the center frequency.<br>
A communications method according to an<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Based on the following embodiments, a best<br>
mode for carrying out the present invention is described<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>
The same reference marks are used for<br>
elements having the same function in all the drawings<br>
for explaining the embodiments, and repeated<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
A radio communications system according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention is provided with<br>
a base station apparatus and a mobile station apparatus.<br>
The base station carries out communications<br>
based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM) method with the mobile station,<br>
using a predetermined frequency band out of a<br>
transmission band.<br>
In this embodiment, the base station uses<br>
a bandwidth of 20 MHz and the mobile station uses a<br>
bandwidth of 5 MHz, as one example. However, this<br><br>
embodiment can be applied to a situation where a<br>
terminal device uses a certain part of the transmission<br>
band of the base station.<br>
First, a cell search method at the time of<br>
starting communications is explained with reference to<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
The base station and the mobile station can<br>
carry out communications using any one of various wide<br>
or narrow frequency bands. In this embodiment, the<br>
mobile station has a receivable bandwidth narrower than<br>
the transmission bandwidth of the base station. In<br>
this embodiment, a first band indicates a transmission<br>
signal bandwidth of the base station, and a second band<br>
indicates the narrowest receivable bandwidth among all<br>
receivable bandwidths of all the mobile stations.<br>
Therefore, the bandwidth of the first band is equal to<br>
or greater than the bandwidth of the second bandwidth.<br>
The bandwidth of the second band is equal to<br>
transmission bandwidths of a synchronization channel,<br>
a broadcast channel, and a control channel in the base<br>
station (a bandwidth of a frequency block). In<br>
addition, the bandwidth of the second band is a<br>
bandwidth equal to or less than a receivable bandwidth<br>
of a terminal device that has the lowest performance<br>
among the plural terminal devices prepared in the system,<br>
the terminal devices having various receivable<br>
bandwidths, and determined in advance by the system.<br>
The mobile station uses the synchronization<br>
channel (SCH) to carry out cell search (step S302) . For<br>
example, the base station uses a predetermined<br>
frequency band out of the transmission band in order<br>
to transmit a downlink signal. For example, the base<br>
station transmits the synchronization channel using<br><br>
the second band including a center frequency on a raster<br>
of the first band. The mobile station receives the<br>
downlink signal.<br>
For example, the mobile station detects a<br>
band that includes the center frequency of the 20 MHz<br>
and has a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz or more, for example,<br>
1.25 MHz or 5 MHz, out of the 20 MHz spectrum. When<br>
the base station uses a bandwidth of 20 MHz and the<br>
mobile station uses the same bandwidth of 20 MHz, the<br>
mobile station can easily find the center frequency of<br>
the 20 MHz band by the cell search.<br>
When the mobile station uses a bandwidth of<br>
5 MHz whose center frequency is different from the<br>
center frequency of the 20 MHz band, the center<br>
frequency of the 20 MHz band is detected by carrying<br>
out correlation detection in accordance with a<br>
predetermined synchronization pattern. The<br>
correlation calculation makes it possible to detect the<br>
center of the band because a correlation value becomes<br>
smaller due to only one sub-carrier deviation. As the<br>
synchronization pattern, a PN code sequence, a Gold code<br>
sequence, and other various sequences may be used.<br>
For example, a 20 MHz band, a 10 MHz band,<br>
and a 5 MHz band are prepared in a cell where the mobile<br>
station exists, and the mobile station can use any one<br>
of the bands.<br>
Next, the mobile station receives the<br>
broadcast channel (BCH) transmitted from the base<br>
station and obtains frequency band information<br>
indicated by the base station by using the broadcast<br>
band (step S304). The base station maps the<br>
synchronization channel over all the sub-carriers and<br>
transmits the mapped signal. In addition, the base<br><br>
station transmits the synchronization channel to all<br>
the users using the 5 MHz band having the center<br>
frequency of the 20 MHz band at the center. The mobile<br>
station using the 5 MHz band can detect the center<br>
frequency of the broadcast channel and appropriately<br>
demodulate the broadcast channel transmitted in the 5<br>
MHz band whose center corresponds to the center<br>
frequency. The broadcast channel includes center<br>
frequency information that makes it possible to<br>
identify a position of the center frequency of the 5<br>
MHz band, which is used as a part of the 20 MHz band.<br>
Generally, the center frequency is not on a raster. The<br>
center frequency information may include information<br>
indicating how far the frequency is away from the<br>
frequency on the raster, for example.<br>
Next, the mobile station demodulates the<br>
broadcast channel, reads the center frequency<br>
information, and adjusts the frequency synthesizer in<br>
a radio portion in order to tune in the center of the<br>
5 MHz band, which the mobile station uses, to the center<br>
frequency included in the center frequency information.<br>
Namely, the mobile station sets a carrier frequency to<br>
a band that includes the center frequency included in<br>
the center frequency information and has a bandwidth<br>
equal to or more than the bandwidth of the second band.<br>
Subsequently, the mobile station receives<br>
the control channel (CCH), using the designated band,<br>
for example, a rightmost band of 5 MHz out of the 20<br>
MHz band, and starts communications (step S306). For<br>
example, the mobile station receives the CCH in the<br>
instructed band, refers to control information (paging<br>
information) that is included in the CCH and indicates<br>
the presence/absence of an incoming call to the mobile<br><br>
station, and starts communications when receiving the<br>
paging information to the mobile station. In addition,<br>
the mobile station updates the reception frequency band<br>
depending on instruction from the base station.<br>
Next, the mobile station carries out<br>
communications, using a data channel in the instructed<br>
band (step S308) . For example, the mobile station<br>
receives the CCH and the data channel in the instructed<br>
band in a predetermined period of time. In addition,<br>
the mobile station updates the reception frequency band<br>
depending on instruction from the base station. When<br>
the mobile station completes the communications using<br>
the data channel in the instructed band, the procedure<br>
returns to step S306.<br>
In step S306 and step S308, when the mobile<br>
station carries out the communications with the base<br>
station, using the rightmost band of 5 MHz, the mobile<br>
station once shifts the center frequency to the center<br>
of the transmission band and carries out peripheral cell<br>
search, in other words, detects an SCH and a BCH, in<br>
order to search peripheral cells during communications,<br>
as shown in FIG. 4. The mobile station swiftly returns<br>
the shifted center frequency to the original center<br>
frequency after the peripheral cell search, and resumes<br>
the communications. In this case, the base station<br>
allocates a band of 1.25 MHz or more that includes the<br>
center frequency on the raster of 20 MHz for the mobile<br>
station that carries out the peripheral cell search.<br>
Namely, when a mobile station carrying out<br>
communications using a frequency band, which is a part<br>
of the system bandwidth, for example, a mobile station<br>
carrying out communications using a frequency block<br>
that is not the frequency block including the center<br><br>
frequency of the system bandwidth carries out the<br>
peripheral cell search, frame timing (including symbol<br>
timing) is detected by using the SCH transmitted in the<br>
frequency block including the center frequency. In<br>
this case, a scramble code (cell ID) is sent through<br>
the control channel of the cell where the communications<br>
are carried out.<br>
According to this, the peripheral cell<br>
search using the SCH needs less time. As a result, high<br>
quality communications due to fast handover can be<br>
continued.<br>
In this case, the base station does not carry<br>
out allocation due to scheduling during which the mobile<br>
station may carry out the peripheral cell search.<br>
Alternatively, the base station sets up a time period<br>
when the allocation due to scheduling is not carried<br>
out in order to allow the mobile station to carry out<br>
the peripheral cell search, and the mobile station<br>
carries out the peripheral cell search during the time<br>
period.<br>
When the peripheral cell search is carried<br>
out, the SCH transmitted through a frequency block<br>
including the center frequency is required to be<br>
received in addition to the frequency block allocated<br>
for communications, as described above. By not<br>
carrying out the allocation due to the scheduling in<br>
a time period when the peripheral cell search is carried<br>
out, concurrent reception of different frequencies is<br>
not necessary in the mobile station, thereby<br>
simplifying a configuration of the reception<br>
apparatus.<br>
Next, a configuration of a transmission<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment is explained<br><br>
with reference to FIG. 5. The transmission apparatus<br>
is provided in, for example, the base station.<br>
A transmission apparatus 100 includes pilot<br>
channel signal generation portions 102i (1 
L1/L2 control channel signal generation portions 104j_,<br>
paging channel signal generation portions 106i, and<br>
data channel signal generation portions 108i that are<br>
prepared depending on the number 2M (M: integer, 1 or<br>
greater) of frequency blocks; multiplexing portions<br>
114i that are prepared depending on the number 2M of<br>
the frequency blocks and connected to the pilot channel<br>
signal generation portions 102i, the L1/L2 control<br>
channel signal generation portions 104i, the paging<br>
channel signal generation portions 106i, and the data<br>
channel signal generation portions 108j_; an IFFT 116<br>
connected to the multiplexing portion 114i; a CP<br>
providing portion 118 connected to the IFFT 116i; and<br>
a synchronization channel (SCH) signal generation<br>
portion 110 and a broadcast channel signal generation<br>
portion 112 that are connected to the multiplexing<br>
portion 114M.<br>
The M-th frequency block includes the center<br>
frequency of the transmission bandwidth of the<br>
transmission apparatus 100.<br>
The pilot channel signal generation<br>
portions 102i generate pilot channel signals and output<br>
the pilot channel signals to the multiplexing portions<br>
114i. The L1/L2 control channel signal generation<br>
portions 104i generate L1/L2 control channel signals<br>
and output the L1/L2 control channel signals to the<br>
multiplexing portions 114i. The paging channel signal<br>
generation portions 106i generate paging channel<br>
signals and output the paging channel signals to the<br><br>
multiplexing portions 114i. The data channel signal<br>
generation portions 108i generate data channel signals<br>
and output the data channel signals to the multiplexing<br>
portions 114i. The synchronization channel signal<br>
generation portion 110 generates a synchronization<br>
channel signal and outputs the synchronization channel<br>
signal to the multiplexing portion 114M. The broadcast<br>
channel signal generation portion 112 generates a<br>
broadcast channel signal and outputs the broadcast<br>
channel signal to the multiplexing portion 114M.<br>
The multiplexing portions 114i (i + M)<br>
corresponding to frequency blocks that are not the M-th<br>
frequency block multiplex the pilot channels that<br>
transmit the pilot channel signals, the L1/L2 control<br>
channels that transmit the L1/L2 control channel<br>
signals, the paging channels that transmit the paging<br>
channel signals, and the data channels that transmit<br>
the data channel signals, and output the multiplexed<br>
signal to the IFFT 116.<br>
In addition, the multiplexing portion 114M<br>
corresponding to the M-th frequency block multiplexes<br>
the pilot channel that transmits the pilot channel<br>
signal, the L1/L2 control channel that transmits the<br>
L1/L2 control channel signal, the paging channel that<br>
transmits the paging channel signal, the data channel<br>
that transmits the data channel signal, the<br>
synchronization channel that transmits the<br>
synchronization channel signal, and the broadcast<br>
channel that transmits the broadcast channel signal,<br>
and outputs the multiplexed signal to the IFFT 116.<br>
The IFFT 116 performs Inverse Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation on the multiplexed signal.<br>
The CP providing portion 118 provides a<br><br>
guard interval to the signal that has been modulated<br>
by the OFDM method after the Inverse Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation, and outputs symbols to be transmitted.<br>
Then, a signal form of the symbols to be transmitted<br>
is transformed into a signal form for transmitting in<br>
a radio frequency, and the transmission is carried out.<br>
In the transmission apparatus 100, the<br>
transmission bandwidth of the SCH may be 2n x a block<br>
bandwidth (n: integer, 1 or more).<br>
Because the SCH is transmitted by the center<br>
of the system bandwidth, the SCH may be mapped in only<br>
a part of the two frequency blocks in the center when<br>
the block bandwidth and the SCH bandwidth are identical,<br>
for example, when the block bandwidth is 1.25 MHz and<br>
the SCH bandwidth is 1.25 MHz, as shown in FIG. 6A.<br>
However, by setting the SCH transmission<br>
bandwidth to be 2n x the block bandwidth, the above<br>
problem, that is, a problem of the SCH being mapped in<br>
only a part of the central two frequency blocks can be<br>
solved, as shown in FIG. 6B.<br>
Next, a reception apparatus 200 according<br>
to this embodiment of the present invention is explained<br>
with reference to FIG. 7. The reception apparatus 200<br>
is provided in, for example, a mobile station.<br>
The reception apparatus 200 includes a<br>
carrier frequency multiplication portion 202 to which<br>
a reception signal is input, a filtering portion 204<br>
to which an output signal of the carrier frequency<br>
multiplication portion 202 is input, a switch 206<br>
connected to the filtering portion 204, a peripheral<br>
cell search portion 218 and a communications portion<br>
208 that are switchably connected to the switch 206,<br>
a handover determination portion 234 connected to the<br><br>
peripheral cell search portion 218, a peripheral cell<br>
search timing control portion 232 serving as a<br>
controller, and a carrier frequency setting portion 230<br>
connected to the peripheral cell search timing control<br>
portion 232. Information indicating an allocation<br>
frequency block allocated to a connected cell is input<br>
to the carrier frequency setting portion 230, and<br>
information indicating a carrier frequency is input, to<br>
the carrier frequency multiplication portion 202. The<br>
peripheral cell search timing control portion 232<br>
controls the switch 206.<br>
In addition, the communications portion 208<br>
includes a synchronization detection portion 210 and<br>
a CP removal portion 212 that are connected to the switch<br>
206, an FFT 214 connected to the CP removal portion 212,<br>
and a decoding portion 216 connected to the FFT 214.<br>
The synchronization detection portion 210 is connected<br>
to the CP removal portion 212.<br>
In addition, the peripheral cell search<br>
portion 218 includes a synchronization timing<br>
detection portion 220 that is connected to the switch<br>
206 and serves as a synchronization channel detector,<br>
a CP removal portion 222 connected to the switch 206,<br>
an FFT 224 connected to the CP removal portion 222, and<br>
a cell ID detection portion 226 and a reception signal<br>
power measurement portion 228 that are connected to the<br>
FFT 224. The synchronization timing detection portion<br>
220 is connected to the CP removal portion 222. The<br>
cell ID detection portion 226 and the reception signal<br>
power measurement portion 228 are connected to the<br>
handover determination portion 234. An output signal<br>
of the cell ID detection portion 226 is input to the<br>
reception signal power measurement portion 228.<br><br>
The reception signal is multiplied by a<br>
carrier frequency set by the carrier frequency setting<br>
portion 230 in the carrier frequency multiplication<br>
portion 202, and then filtered by the filtering portion<br>
204 .<br>
The peripheral cell search timing control<br>
portion 232 controls the switch 206. The peripheral<br>
cell search timing control portion 232 switches the<br>
switch 206 so that communications or the peripheral cell<br>
search is carried out at an arbitrary timing. For<br>
example, the base station 100 informs the mobile station<br>
200 of data allocation, for example, through the CCH,<br>
when data are allocated. The mobile station 200<br>
determines whether there are data incoming to the same<br>
mobile station 200 in accordance with the received CCH.<br>
When it is determined in accordance with the paging<br>
information stored in the CCH as a result of the<br>
reception of the CCH that there are no data incoming<br>
to the mobile station 200, the mobile station 200 goes<br>
into a waiting state until reception of the next CCH.<br>
The peripheral cell search timing control portion 232<br>
controls the switch 206 so that the peripheral cell<br>
search is carried out during the waiting state.<br>
Additionally, in this case, the peripheral<br>
cell search timing control portion 232 outputs to the<br>
carrier frequency setting portion 230 information<br>
indicating that the peripheral cell search is being<br>
carried out. When the carrier frequency setting<br>
portion 230 inputs the information, the carrier<br>
frequency setting portion 230 sets the frequency<br>
corresponding to the M-th frequency block including the<br>
center frequency of the transmission band of the<br>
connected cell, and outputs information indicating the<br><br>
frequency to the carrier frequency multiplication<br>
portion 202.<br>
In addition, when the peripheral cell search<br>
is being not carried out, the peripheral cell search<br>
timing control portion 232 outputs to the carrier<br>
frequency setting portion 230 information indicating<br>
that the communications are being carried out. When<br>
the carrier frequency setting portion 230 inputs the<br>
information, the carrier frequency setting portion 230<br>
sets the frequency corresponding to the allocated<br>
frequency block in accordance with allocation<br>
frequency block information of the connected cell, and<br>
outputs information indicating the frequency to the<br>
carrier frequency multiplication portion 202.<br>
When the peripheral cell search is being<br>
carried out, the synchronization channel transmitted<br>
from a peripheral base station is used to detect a timing<br>
of the synchronization channel by the synchronization<br>
timing detection portion 220, and the CP is removed by<br>
the CP removal portion 222 in accordance with the<br>
detected timing. In addition, the signal after the CP<br>
removal undergoes the Fast Fourier Transformation in<br>
the FFT 224. The FFT 224 outputs plural sub-carrier<br>
signals.<br>
The cell ID detection portion 226 detects<br>
the cell ID (peripheral cell ID) from the signal that<br>
has undergone the Fast Fourier Transformation, and<br>
outputs information indicating the cell ID to the<br>
handover determination portion 234 and the reception<br>
signal power measurement portion 228.<br>
The reception signal power measurement<br>
portion 228 measures reception power of the signal that<br>
has undergone the Fast Fourier Transformation,<br><br>
corresponding to each of the cell IDs, and outputs<br>
information indicating the reception power (peripheral<br>
cell reception level) to the handover determination<br>
portion 234 .<br>
The handover determination portion 234<br>
determines in accordance with the detected peripheral<br>
cell ID and the peripheral cell reception level<br>
corresponding to the detected peripheral cell whether<br>
the handover should be carried out. When it is<br>
determined that the handover should be carried out, the<br>
handover determination portion 234 feedbacks a<br>
handover request signal for requesting the handover to<br>
the base station.<br>
In addition, when the communications with<br>
the connected cell are being carried out, predetermined<br>
processes are carried out in the communications 208.<br>
The synchronization detection portion 210<br>
carries out synchronization detection in accordance<br>
with the reception signal, and outputs information<br>
indicating the synchronization timing to the CP removal<br>
portion 212. The CP removal portion 212 removes the<br>
CP of the reception signal in accordance with the<br>
synchronization timing. The signal after the CP<br>
removal undergoes the Fast Fourier Transformation in<br>
the FFT 214, and is output to the decoding portion 216.<br>
The decoding portion 216 carries out a decoding process<br>
on the signal that has undergone the Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation, and outputs the decoding result.<br>
Specifically, the decoding portion 216 decodes the data<br>
channel, the paging channel, and the control channel<br>
of the allocated frequency band of the connected cell.<br>
As a result, the decoding result is output from the<br>
decoding portion 216.<br><br>
Next, the transmission apparatus 100<br>
according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention is explained.<br>
The transmission apparatus 100 according to<br>
this embodiment transmits the paging information<br>
through the frequency block including the center<br>
frequency of the entire band.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the transmission<br>
apparatus 100 is provided, for example, in a base<br>
station, and includes the pilot channel signal<br>
generation portions 102i (1 
channel signal generation portions 104i, and the data<br>
channel signal generation portions 108i that are<br>
prepared depending on the number 2M (M: integer, 1 or<br>
greater) of frequency blocks; the multiplexing<br>
portions 114i that are prepared depending on the number<br>
2M of the frequency blocks and connected to the pilot<br>
channel signal generation portions 102i, the L1/L2<br>
control channel signal generation portions 104i, and<br>
the data channel signal generation portions 108i; the<br>
IFFT 116 connected to the multiplexing portion 114i;<br>
the CP providing portions 118 connected to the IFFT 116;<br>
and the synchronization channel (SCH) signal<br>
generation portion 110, the broadcast channel signal<br>
generation portion 112, and the paging channel signal<br>
generation portion 120 that are connected to the<br>
multiplexing portion 114M.<br>
The M-th frequency block includes the center<br>
frequency of the transmission bandwidth of the<br>
transmission apparatus 100.<br>
The pilot channel signal generation<br>
portions 102i generates the pilot channel signals and<br>
output the pilot channel signals to the multiplexing<br><br>
portions 114i. The L1/L2 control channel signal<br>
generation portions 104i generate the L1/L2 control<br>
channel signals and output the L1/L2 control channel<br>
signals to the multiplexing portion 114i. The data<br>
channel signal generation portions 108i generate the<br>
data channel signals and output the; data channel signals<br>
to the multiplexing portions 114i.<br>
The synchronization channel signal<br>
generation portion 110 generates the synchronization<br>
channel signal and outputs the synchronization channel<br>
signal to the multiplexing portion 114M. The broadcast<br>
channel signal generation portion 112 generates the<br>
broadcast channel and outputs the broadcast channel<br>
signal to the multiplexing portion 114M. The paging<br>
channel signal generation portion 120 generates the<br>
paging channel and outputs the paging channel to the<br>
multiplexing portion 114M.<br>
The multiplexing portions 114i (i ¥= M)<br>
corresponding to the frequency blocks that are not the<br>
M-th frequency block multiplex the pilot channels that<br>
transmit pilot channel signals, the L1/L2 control<br>
channels that transmit the L1/L2 control channel<br>
signals, and the data channels that transmit the data<br>
channel signals, and output the multiplexed signal to<br>
the IFFT 116.<br>
In addition, the multiplexing portion 114M<br>
corresponding to the M-th frequency block multiplexes<br>
the pilot channel that transmits the pilot channel<br>
signal, the L1/L2 control channel that transmits the<br>
L1/L2 control channel signal, the data channel that<br>
transmits the data channel signal, the synchronization<br>
channel that transmits the synchronization channel<br>
signal, the broadcast channel that transmits the<br><br>
broadcast channel signal and the paging channel that<br>
transmits the paging channel signal, and outputs the<br>
multiplexed signal to the IFFT 116.<br>
The IFFT 116 performs the Inverse Fast<br>
Fourier Transformation on the multiplexed signal.<br>
The CP providing portion 118 provides a<br>
guard interval to the signal that has been modulated<br>
by the OFDM method after the Inverse Fast Fourier<br>
Transformation, and outputs symbols to be transmitted.<br>
Then, a signal form of the symbols to be transmitted<br>
is transformed into a signal form for transmitting in<br>
a radio frequency, and the transmission is carried out.<br>
In the transmission apparatus 100, the<br>
transmission bandwidth of the SCH may be 2n x a block<br>
bandwidth (n: integer, 1 or more).<br>
Next, a reception apparatus 200 according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention is<br>
explained. The reception apparatus 200 according to<br>
this embodiment has the same configuration as the<br>
reception apparatus explained with reference to FIG.<br>
7. However, the switch 206 in the reception apparatus<br>
200 in FIG. 7 is not necessary when the reception<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment is in a waiting<br>
state .<br>
The transmission apparatus 100 according to<br>
this embodiment transmits the paging information<br>
through the frequency block including the center<br>
frequency of the entire band. The mobile station 200<br>
determines whether there are data incoming to the same<br>
mobile station 200 in accordance with the received CCH.<br>
When it is determined in accordance with the paging<br>
information stored in the CCH as a result of the<br>
reception of the CCH that there are no data incoming<br><br>
to the: mobile station 200, the mobile station 200 goes<br>
into a waiting state until reception of the next CCH.<br>
The peripheral cell search timing control portion 232<br>
controls the switch 206 so that the peripheral cell<br>
search is carried out during the waiting state.<br>
According to the transmission apparatus 100<br>
of this embodiment, because the paging information is<br>
transmitted through the frequency block including the<br>
center frequency of the entire band, the frequency band<br>
for the paging information can be made identical to the<br>
frequency band for the peripheral cell search.<br>
Therefore, when it is determined in accordance with the<br>
paging information that there are no data incoming to<br>
the mobile station 200, the peripheral cell search can<br>
be carried out without changing the carrier frequencies.<br>
In other words, time necessary for the frequency shifts<br>
from the frequency corresponding to the allocated<br>
frequency block of the connected cell to the frequency<br>
band including the center frequency of the transmission<br>
band of the base station and back to the frequency<br>
corresponding to the allocated frequency block of the<br>
connected cell can be saved. In addition, the<br>
peripheral cell search at the time of the waiting state<br>
can be simplified.<br>
Next, the transmission apparatus 100<br>
according to yet another embodiment of the present<br>
invention is explained.<br>
Because the transmission apparatus 100<br>
according to this embodiment has the same configuration<br>
as the transmission apparatus 100 explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 5, the explanation is omitted.<br>
Next, a reception apparatus 200 according<br>
to yet another embodiment of the present invention is<br><br>
explained. The reception apparatus 200 according to<br>
this embodiment has the same configuration as the<br>
reception apparatus explained with reference to FIG.<br>
7. However, the switch 206 in the reception apparatus<br>
200 in FIG. 7 is not necessary.<br>
The reception apparatus 100 allocates the<br>
frequency band including the center frequency of the<br>
transmission band of the base station for the mobile<br>
station at the timing of the cell search carried out<br>
by the mobile station.<br>
For the purpose of illustration, an example<br>
where the transmission band of the base station is<br>
divided into three frequency blocks is explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 9. However, the following<br>
explanation holds true when the transmission band of<br>
the base station is divided into two or four or more<br>
frequency blocks.<br>
Plural mobile stations are grouped, and the<br>
divided frequency blocks are allocated for the<br>
corresponding groups. The frequency blocks allocated<br>
for the corresponding groups are changed in a<br>
predetermined time cycle.<br>
For example, the base station divides all<br>
the users into plural groups, for example, three groups<br>
A, B, and C.<br>
A frequency block for the user group A is<br>
a frequency block 1, 2, 3, 1, ..., at the time t, t + 1,<br>
t + 2, t + 3, ..., respectively. In addition, a frequency<br>
block for the user group B is a frequency block 2, 3,<br>
1, 2, ..., at the time t, t + 1, t + 2, t + 3, ..., respectively.<br>
A frequency block for the user group A is a frequency<br>
block 3, 1, 2, 3,..., at the time t, t + 1, t + 2, t + 3, ...,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
The base station changes the group to which<br>
the mobile station that requests execution of the<br>
peripheral cell search belongs, to the group for which<br>
the frequency block including the center frequency is<br>
allocated. For example, when the mobile station<br>
belonging to the user group A requests the execution<br>
of the peripheral cell search at the time t, the base<br>
station changes the user group to which the same mobile<br>
station belongs from the user group A to the user group<br>
B for which the frequency block including the center<br>
frequency of the transmission band of the connected cell<br>
is allocated at the time t, namely, the frequency block<br>
2. In this case, the same mobile station continues to<br>
belong to the user group B after the cell seeirch is<br>
completed.<br>
In addition, the base station may<br>
temporarily allocate the frequency block including the<br>
center frequency for the mobile station requesting the<br>
execution of the peripheral cell search. For example,<br>
the base station exceptionally allocates the frequency<br>
block 2 for the same mobile station during a time period<br>
t, and returns the same mobile station to the user group<br>
A time t+1 to remain thereafter,<br>
