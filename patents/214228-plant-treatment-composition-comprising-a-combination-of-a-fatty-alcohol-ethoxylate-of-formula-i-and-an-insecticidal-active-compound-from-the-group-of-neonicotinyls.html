COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PLANT TREATMENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING A COMBINATION OF A FATTY ALCOHOL ETHOXYLATE OF FORMULA (I) AND AN INSECTICIDAL ACTIVE COMPOUND FROM THE GROUP OF NEONICOTINYLS"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,  a German company of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
&amp;!*. -       *ta~S<br><br>
The present invention relates to the novel use of fatty alcohol ethoxylates as Penetrants for certain active compounds having insecticidal properties.<br>
It is generally known that many agrochemically active compounds, in particular those having systemic action, have to penetrate into the plant to be able to unfold their activity evenly throughout the plant. Thus, when the active compound is taken up via the leaves, the active compounds have to overcome the penetration barrier of the cuticle. Moreover, it is important that the agrochemically active compounds Penetrate rapidly, distributed over a surface which is as large as possible, into the plant, since there may otherwise be the risk that the active components are washed off by rain.<br>
Furthermore, it is generally known that some additives used in crop protection compositions, such as, for example, surfactants, mineral oils and vegetable oils, promote penetration of agrochemically active compounds into the plant and are thus able to enhance the activity of the active compounds. In the individual case, the additives may increase wettability, lead to a better distribution of the spray coating on. the surface (= spreading) of the plant, increase the availability of the active compound in the dried spray residue by partial dissolution or directly promote penetration of the active compound through the cuticle. Here, the additives are either incorporated directly into the formulation - which is only possible up to a certain percentage - or added it to the spray liquor in question using the tank mix method.<br>
Furthermore, it is already known that fatty alcohol ethoxylates can be used as penetrants for numerous agrochemically active compounds (cf. EP-A 0 579 052 and Recent Res. Devel. in Agricultural &amp; Food Chem. 2 (1998), 809-837). However, it is<br><br>
Le A 35 291-Foreign Countries<br>
-2-<br>
disadvantageous that the desired effect is only observed when the formulation used has a relatively high content of fatty alcohol ethoxylate.<br>
It has now been found that fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the formula |5<br>
CH3-(CH2)	CH2-(-0-CH2—CH2—)—OH     ©<br>
in which<br>
m        represents average values from 8.0 to 13.0, 1)<br>
n        represents average values from 6.0 to 17.0,<br>
can be used as penetrants for insecticidally active compounds from the group of the<br>
neonicotinyls when they are present in commercial formulations in concentrations<br>
15	from 0.1 to 30% by weight, the weight ratio of insecticidally active compound from<br>
the group of the neonicotinyls to fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I) being from 1:0.1 to 1:2.0.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to the use of fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the<br>
2)	formula (I) for the stated purpose. Moreover, the invention relates to plant treatment<br>
compositions comprising<br>
from 0.1 to 30% by weight of fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I),<br>
25	-	from 1 to 50% by weight of active compound from the group of the<br>
neonicotinyls,<br>
from 1 to 80% by weight of dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and/or butyrolactone, and 3)<br><br>
Le A 35 291-Foreign Countries<br><br>
from 0 to 20% by weight of additives.<br>
It is extremely surprising that fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the formula (I) are con¬<br>
siderably more suitable as penetrants for insecticidally active neonicotinyls than<br>
	comparable substances used for the same purpose. It is also unexpected that even<br>
very low concentrations of fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I) are sufficient to achieve the desired effect.<br>
The use according to the invention of fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the formula (I) has<br>
	a number of advantages. Thus, these fatty alcohol ethoxylates are products which can<br>
be handled without any problems and are available even in relatively large amounts. Moreover, they are biodegradable and permit the effectiveness of the application of neonicotinyls to be increased considerably.<br>
1 &gt;	The formula (I) provides a general definition of the fatty alcohol ethoxylates which<br>
can be used according to the invention. These fatty alcohol ethoxylates are, in general, mixtures of substances of this type having different chain lengths. Accordingly, for the indices m and n, average values are obtained which may not be integers.<br>
2)<br>
Preference is given to using fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the formula (I) in which<br>
m        represents average values from 9.0 to 12.0<br>
25	n        represents average values from 7.0 to 9.0.<br>
Very particular preference is given to the fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I) in which<br>
3)	m        represents the average value 10.5 and<br><br>
Le A 35 291-Foreign Countries<br>
n        represents the average value 8.4.<br>
The fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the formula (I) and their use as surfactants are already known.<br>
In the present context, insecticidally active neonicotinyls is preferably to be understood as meaning the following substances:<br><br><br>

:o<br>
When fatty alcohol ethoxylates of the formula (I) are used according to the invention,<br>
the content of these products can be varied within a certain range. In general, fatty<br>
alcohol ethoxylates of the formula (I) are used in such an amount that they are<br>
present in the commercial formulations in concentrations from 0.1 to 30% by weight,<br>
: 15	preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight. Here, the weight ratio of insecticidally active<br>
compound from the group of the neonicotinyls to fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I) is chosen such that it is generally from 1:0.1 to 1:2.0, preferably from 1:0.2 to 1:0.5.<br><br>
Le A 35 291-Foreign Countries<br>
The content of the individual components in the plant treatment compositions according to the invention can be varied within a certain range. Preference is given to plant treatment compositions in which the concentrations<br>
	-	of fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I) are from 0.5 to 15% by weight,<br><br>
of active compound from the group of the neonicotinyls are from 2.5 to 30% by weight,<br>
of dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and/or butyrolactone are from 30 to 80% by weight and<br>
of additives are from 0 to 15% by weight.<br>
	If the plant treatment compositions according to the invention are ready-to-use<br>
products, preference is given to those in which the content<br>
of fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I) is from 0.01 to 0.2% by weight,<br>
of active compound from the group of the neonicotinyls is from 0.001 to<br>
2|0	0.03% by weight,<br>
of dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and/or butyrolactone is from 0 to<br>
50% by weight and<br>
of additives is from 0 to 95% by weight.<br>
	The plant treatment compositions according to the invention are prepared by mixing<br>
the components with each other in the ratios desired in each case. In general, an active compound from the group of the neonicotinyls is initially charged, and the other components are then added with stirring, in any order.<br><br>
When preparing the plant treatment compositions according to the invention, the temperatures can be varied within a certain range. In general, the compositions are prepared at temperatures from 10°C to 50°C, preferably at room temperature.<br>
Suitable for preparing the plant treatment compositions according to the invention is an apparatus customarily used for preparing agrochemical formulations.<br>
The plant treatment compositions according to the invention can be applied either as such or after prior dilution with water or other diluents, i.e., for example, as emulsions, suspensions, solutions or aerosols. Application is carried out by customary methods, i.e., for example, by spraying, watering, atomizing, injecting or spreading.<br>
The application rate of the plant treatment compositions according to the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It depends on the particular active compounds contained in the formulations, and their concentration.<br>
With the aid of the plant treatment compositions according to the invention, it is possible to apply neonicotinyls in a particularly advantageous manner to the plants and/or their habitat. Here, the tendency of solid active compounds to crystallize is reduced, the penetration power of the active compounds is enhanced and, compared to customary formulations, the biological activity of the active components is increased.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a plant treatment composition comprising<br>
from 0.1 to 30% by weight of fatty alcohol ethoxylate of the formula (I)<br>

were then fixed with the aid of microscope slides such that the points of application on the leaves in an area of 2 cm were not twisted. Following their preparation, the ready-to-use preparations of active compound were stirred at room temperature for 60 minutes. 20<br>
Application and work-up<br>
In each case 3 ul of the preparation of active compound were applied onto the middle of a leaf. The plants were then allowed to rest until the preparation of active<br>
25	compound had dried on. At the same time, as a control, in each case 3 ul of the<br>
preparation of active compound were pipetted directly into a scintillation bottle. This control was carried out in 5 repetitions. Immediately afterwards, the other preparations of active compounds and plants were subjected to the same procedure. Following application, a temperature of 21-22°C and a relative atmospheric humidity<br>
30	of 70% was maintained in the laboratory.<br><br>

After all of the preparations of active compounds that had been applied had dried on,<br>
the treated plants were placed in a climatized chamber for 22 or 46 hours. 24 or 48<br>
hours after the application of the preparations of active compounds, the leaves of all<br>
5	plants were once more fixed using slides. The entire surface of the point of<br>
application was then covered with 30 ul of a 5% strength solution of cellulose acetate in acetone. After the solution had dried on completely, the cellulose acetate film formed was in each case removed and placed into a scintillation bottle. In each case, 1 ml of acetone was then added to the cellulose acetate film. The samples remained<br>
10	at room temperature in closed vessels until the substance contained therein had been<br>
dissolved. Thereafter, in each case 2 ml of scintillation liquid were added. Beforehand, the tips of the leaves had been cut off in one piece and placed into cardboard hats. Cardboard hats and content were dried at 50°C for 16 hours. The radioactivity of all  samples was then determined by liquid and incineration<br>
15	scintillation. The values obtained are used to calculate the percentage of uptake of<br>
active compound and translocation. 0% means that no active compound has been taken up and translocated; 100% means that all of the active compound has been taken up and translocated.<br>
