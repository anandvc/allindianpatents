				<td>EMULSION POLYMER ADHESVES<br>
The present invention relates to latex polymer emulsions with high peel, high temperature cohesion, and balance of other pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) properties.<br>
Historically, solvent-based adhesives have been preferred for applications requiring a balance of such performance properties. Environmental considerations, however, favor elimination of solvents. This and higher coating speeds attainable with emulsion PSAs, favor their use in place of solvent-based PSAs. Typically, PSAs displaying such high and desirable levels of peel and adhesion do so at the cost of poor cohesive strength at elevated temperatures.<br>
U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 12/004,242 discloses aqueous dispersions of water-insoluble latex polymer formed by a two stage process where the first stage polymer comprises at least 40% of a monomer having a homopolymer Tg of less than -40°C, and 10 to 50% of a soft hydrophilic, nonionic monomer having a homopolymer Tg of less than 30°C. The resulting compositions may be useful as PSAs with improved water resistance. These polymers may be formed in the presence of broad range of chain transfer agent. Although U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 12/004,242 attempts to solve problems associated with cohesion/adhesion balance, it does not address the formation of the inventive latices which achieve the balance of those desirable performance properties at high temperatures. The present invention solves this problem by use of a select balance of chain transfer agent and reinforcing second stage polymer.<br>
The present invention provides a pressure sensitive adhesive formed by a multi-staged emulsion polymerization process. The resulting adhesive comprises at least one soft first polymer and at least one reinforcing polymer. According to the invention, a first soft polymer is formed in a polymerization stage in the presence of 3 to 12 mmoles of chain transfer agent per kg of monomer, said first polymer having a Tg of less than -20°C. In a subsequent polymerization stage, a reinforcing polymer is formed in the presence of said first polymer. The resultant<br>
polymer is useful as a PSA with high peel while retaining a good balance of other PSA properties.<br>
As used herein, the use of the term "(meth)" followed by another term such as acrylate refers to both acrylates and methacrylates. For example, the term "(meth)acrylate" refers to either acrylate or methacrylate; the term "(meth)acrylic" refers to either acrylic or methacrylic; the term "(meth)acrylonitrile" refers to either acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile; and the term "(meth)acrylamide" refers to either acrylamide or methacrylamide. The term "(co)polymer" as used herein refers to homopolymers and copolymers.<br>
"Glass transition temperature" or "Tg" as used herein, means the temperature at or above which a glassy polymer will undergo segmental motion of the polymer chain. Glass transition temperatures of a polymer can be estimated by the Fox equation; see, Bulletin of the American Physical Society, 1, 3, p.123 (1956). The values of Tg reported herein are calculated using the Fox equation.<br>
As used herein, "multi-stage polymer" means a polymer formed in two stages ("two-stage") or more than two stages, in which the second stage polymer and any subsequent stage polymers are polymerized in the presence of the first and earlier stage polymers. A multi-stage polymer may further comprise other polymers which are blended, admixed or otherwise added to it.<br>
As used herein, "reinforcing polymer" means a polymer polymerized in the presence of the first polymer, which either has a Tg of 60° C or higher, or is formed from monomers having two or more alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated groups, or combinations thereof.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a multi-stage emulsion polymer comprising (a) 90 to 99.5 wt.% of a first polymer, based on total weight of first polymer and reinforcing polymer, wherein the first polymer is formed from at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and has a Tg of less than -20°C, and is polymerized in the presence of 3 to 12 mmoles of chain transfer agent per kg of monomers in the first polymer; and (b) 0.5 to 10 wt.% of a reinforcing polymer based on total weight of first polymer and reinforcing polymer. The monomers used to form the reinforcing polymer are dispersed in<br>
the first polymer and may swell the first polymer prior to polymerization of the monomers to form the reinforcing polymer.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a latex polymer emulsion prepared by a process comprising the steps: (a) emulsion polymerization of a first stage polymer of at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, wherein the first stage polymer has a Tg of less than -20°C, and wherein the polymerization is carried out in the presence of 3 to 12 mmoles of chain transfer agent per kg of monomers in the first stage! (b) addition to the first stage polymer of monomers to form the reinforcing polymer, such monomers selected from the group consisting of (i) monomers capable of forming a polymer with a Tg of 60°C or higher, and (ii) monomers having two or more alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated groups, and (hi) combinations thereof, wherein the addition is carried out under conditions wherein no significant polymerization occurs; and (c) polymerizing the monomers to form the reinforcing polymer in the presence of the first stage polymer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a composite article comprising a substrate and a film formed from a multi-stage emulsion polymer comprising (a) 90 to 99.5 wt.% of a first polymer, based on total weight of first polymer and reinforcing polymer, wherein the first polymer is formed from at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and has a Tg of less than -20°C, and is polymerized in the presence of 3 to 12 mmoles of chain transfer agent per kg of monomers in the first polymer; and (b) 0.5 to 10 wt.% of a reinforcing polymer based on total weight of first polymer and reinforcing polymer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a composite article comprising a substrate and a film formed from a latex polymer emulsion prepared by a process comprising the steps: (a) emulsion polymerization of a first stage polymer of at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, wherein the first stage polymer has a Tg of less than -20°C, and wherein the polymerization is carried out in the presence of 3 to 12 mmoles of chain transfer agent per kg of monomers in the first stage; (b) addition to the first stage polymer of monomers to form the reinforcing polymer, wherein the<br>
monomers are selected such that the reinforcing polymer either has a Tg of 60°C or higher, or is formed from monomers having two or more alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated groups, or combinations thereof, wherein the addition is carried out under conditions wherein no significant polymerization occurs; and (c) polymerizing the monomers to form the reinforcing polymer in the presence of the first stage polymer.<br>
In these embodiments, the substrate may comprise tape or label backing, rigid or flexible films, metallized films, synthetic and natural foams, thermoplastic and thermosetting substrates (i.e., plastics such as PVC and PET), flocked substrates, plasticized and non-plasticized polymeric substrates, paper, cardboard, plastic-based composites, cellulosic-based composites, metals and other materials. In one embodiment, the substrate comprises polyvinyl chloride resin, with or without at least one plasticizer. In mounting tape applications, the substrates may be plastics, metals, plasters, wood, cellulosic composites, plastic composites and combinations thereof. Plasticizers present in the substrate may be polymeric or monomeric plasticizers; preferably such plasticizers are monomeric plasticizers.<br>
The preparation of aqueous dispersions of water-insoluble latex polymers by emulsion polymerization is well known in the art. The practice of emulsion polymerization is discussed in detail in D. C. Blackley, Emulsion Polymerization (Wiley, 1975). Conventional emulsion polymerization techniques may be used to prepare the first and subsequent water-insoluble latex polymers of this invention. The practice of emulsion polymerization is also discussed in H. Warson, The Applications of Synthetic Resin Emulsions, Chapter 2 (Ernest Benn Ltd., London 1972).<br>
Thus, monomers may be emulsified with an anionic, cationic or nonionic dispersing agent, using, for example, from about 0.25% to 5% by weight of dispersing agent on the weight of total monomers. Combinations of anionic and nonionic emulsifiers may also be used. High molecular weight polymers such as hydroxy ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol may be used as emulsion stabilizers and protective colloids, as may polyelectrolytes such as polyacrylic acid.<br>
Suitable cationic dispersion agents include lauryl-pyridinium chlorides, cetyldimethyl amine acetate, and alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chlorides in which the alkyl group has from 8 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Suitable anionic dispersing agents include, for example, the higher fatty alcohol sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, and the like! alkylaryl sulfonates such as sodium or potassium isopropylbenzene sulfonates or isopropyl naphthalene sulfonates, and the like! alkali metal higher alkyl sulfosuccinates, such as sodium octyl sulfosuccinate, sodium N-methyl, N-palmitoyltaurate, sodium oleyl isothionate, and the like; and alkali metal salts of alkylarylpolyethoxyethanol sulfates or sulfonates, such as sodium tert-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethyl sulfate having 1 to 5 oxyethylene units, and the like.<br>
Suitable non-ionic dispersing agents include alkylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols having alkyl groups of from about 7 to 18 carbon atoms and from about 6 to about 60 oxyethylene units, such as heptylphenoxypolyethoxy-thanols, methyloctylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, and the like! polyethoxy-thanol derivatives of methylene-linked alkyl phenols; sulfur-containing agents such as those made by condensing from about 6 to about 60 moles of ethylene oxide with nonyl mercaptan, dodecyl mercaptan, and the like, or with alkylthiophenols wherein the alkyl groups contain from 6 to 16 carbon atoms; ethylene oxide derivatives of long-chained carboxylic acids, such as lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and the like, or mixtures of acids such as those found in tall oil containing from 6 to 60 oxyethylene units per molecule; analagous ethylene oxide condensates of long-chained alcohols such as octyl, decyl, lauryl, or cetyl alcohols, ethylene oxide derivative of etherified or esterified polyhydroxy compounds having a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain, such as sorbitan monostearate containing from 6 to 60 oxyethylene units; also, ethylene oxide condensates of long-chain or branched chain amines, such as dodecyl amine, hexadecyl amine, and octadecyl amine, containing from 6 to 60 oxyethylene units; block copolymers of ethylene oxide sections combined with one or more hydrophobic propylene oxide sections. Mixtures of alkyl benzenesulfonates and ethoxylated alkylphenols may be employed.<br>
A polymerization initiator of the free radical type, such as ammonium or potassium persulfate, may be used alone or as the oxidizing component of a redox system, which also includes a reducing component such as potassium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate or sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate. The reducing component is frequently referred to as an accelerator. The initiator and accelerator, commonly referred to as catalyst, catalyst system or redox system, may be used in proportion from about 0.01% or less to 3% each, based on the weight of monomers to be copolymerized. Examples of redox catalyst systems include t-butyl hydroperoxide/sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate/ Fe(II), and ammonium persulfate/sodium bisulfite/sodium hydrosulfite/Fe(lI). The polymerization temperature may be from room temperature to 90°C, or higher, and may be optimized for the catalyst system employed, as is conventional. Emulsion polymerization may be seeded or unseeded. Seeded polymerization tends to yield aqueous dispersions of latex polymer having more uniform physical properties than unseeded polymerization.<br>
Chain transfer agents including mercaptans, polymercaptans and polyhalogen compounds are used in the polymerization mixture to moderate polymer molecular weight of the first polymer. They may also be used in the formation of the reinforcing polymer. Examples of chain transfer agents which may be used include long chain alkyl mercaptans such as t-dodecyl mercaptans, methyl 3-mercaptopropionate, alcohols such as isopropanol, isobutanol, lauryl alcohol or t-octyl alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene and trichloro-bromoethane. In the present invention, the chain transfer agent is charged to the monomer mixture for the first polymer at lower limits of 3 or 4 to upper limits of 9 or 12 mmoles per kilogram of monomer in the first stage. All ranges are inclusive and combinable. Additional chain transfer agent may be used in forming the reinforcing polymer.<br>
The polymerization process may be a thermal or redox type; that is, free radicals may be generated solely by the thermal dissociation of an initiator species or a redox system may be used. A monomer emulsion containing all or some portion of the monomers to be polymerized may be prepared using the monomers, water and emulsifiers. A catalyst solution containing catalyst in water may be separately prepared. The monomer emulsion and catalyst solution<br>
may be co-fed into the polymerization vessel over the course of the emulsion polymerization. The reaction vessel itself may initially contain water. The reaction vessel may also additionally contain seed emulsion and further may additionally contain an initial charge of polymerization catalyst. The temperature of the reaction vessel during the emulsion polymerization may be controlled by cooling to remove heat generated by the polymerization reaction or by heating the reaction vessel. Several monomer emulsions may be simultaneously co-fed into the reaction vessel. When multiple monomer emulsions are co-fed, they may be of different monomer composition. The sequence and rates at which the diverse monomer emulsions are co-fed may be altered during the emulsion polymerization process. After addition of the monomer emulsion or emulsions has been completed, the polymerization reaction mixture may be subjected to a monomer reduction step to minimize the concentrations of unreacted monomer and unreacted polymerization catalyst species. The pH of the contents of the reaction vessel may also be altered during the course of the emulsion polymerization process. Both thermal and redox polymerization processes may be employed.<br>
The monomers used in preparing the first stage polymer may be any of those conventionally used in the synthetic resin emulsion art. Acrylic monomers are preferred for preparing latex polymer to be used in adhesive coating compositions. Examples of acrylic monomers include the (C1-C24) alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids.

Further<br>
examples of useful monomers include the partial esters of unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and particularly the alkyl half esters of such acids. Examples of such partial esters are the alkyl half esters of itaconic acid, fumaric acid and maleic acid wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Representative members of this group of compounds include methyl acid itaconic, butyl acid itaconic, ethyl acid fumarate, butyl acid fumarate, and methyl acid maleate. Minor amounts of other comonomers, such as adhesion promoting comonomers, may also be used. These monomers may be copolymerized with acrylic monomers to yield the first polymer.<br>
Examples of alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids which may be copolymerized with acrylic and other monomers in forming the first polymer of the invention include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, beta-acryloxypropionic acid and higher oligomers of acrylic acid and mixtures thereof, ethacrylic acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, crotonic acid, citraconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, alpha-chloroacrylic acid, cinnamic acid, mesaconic acid and mixtures thereof. Acrylic and methacrylic acids are preferred, and methacrylic acid is especially preferred. It is preferred that alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid comprise an amount ranging from upper limits of 10, 5 or 3.5% to lower limits of 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5% by weight based on the total weight of monomer, of the monomer composition of the first polymer. All ranges are inclusive and combinable.<br>
In addition to monoethylenically unsaturated monomer, small proportions of alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated monomer having at least two sites of alpha, beta-ethylenic unsaturation, that is, di-or multi-ethylenically unsaturated monomer, may be used as comonomer in preparing the first polymer. However, it is not necessary to employ any multi-ethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the first polymer may be formed in the presence of a polymerizable surfactant. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated surfactant monomers include, but are not limited to for example, salts or quaternary nitrogen compounds comprising at least one acid, wherein the acid is a sulfonic acid, a carboxylic acid, or a phosphoric acid, or a mixture thereof, and at least one nitrogenous base, wherein the nitrogenous base contains at least one<br>
nitrogen atom and at least on ethylenically unsaturated moiety. Other suitable examples are described in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2003/0149119.<br>

Additional suitable polymerizable surfactant monomers also include, for example, maleate derivatives (as described in U.S. Patent 4,246,387), and allyl derivatives of alkyl phenol ethoxylates (as described in Japanese Patent 62-227435). The amount of surfactant used is typically from 0.1 to 6 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 2 wt.%, based on the total weight of monomer.<br>
Furthermore, a lower limit of 2, 3 or 5 wt.%, and an upper limit of 15, 20 or 25 wt.% (all ranges being inclusive and combinable), based on weight of monomer in the first polymer, of a low molecular weight polymeric component having a number average molecular weight of less than about 35,000 and a softening point of at least 40°C, as described in U.S. Patent 4,912,169, may be blended in as a separate dispersion or formed in the presence of the first and/or second stage polymer as a separate polymerization step. Alternately, the first stage polymer may be formed in the presence of a low molecular weight polymeric component. The low molecular weight polymeric additive may be formed using polymerizable surfactant(s) of the types described above. The low molecular weight polymeric additive may function as a tackifier in the latex emulsion polymer.<br>
A polymerization inhibitor may optionally be added to the polymerization process in making the first polymer. In the case of two -stage and multi-stage polymers, after preparation of the first polymer and prior to the second or subsequent stage(s), a polymerization inhibitor may be added or alternatively, the second or subsequent stage(s) in the process of preparing the compositions of this invention may be undertaken without the addition of the inhibitor.<br>

Alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated monomer having at least two sites of alpha, beta-ethylenic unsaturation may be referred to as "multifunctional monomer" or "MFM". In some embodiments, the reinforcing polymer comprises from 1 to 100%, preferably from 10 to 100%, more preferably from 20 to 100%, by weight of MFMs based on the total weight of reinforcing polymer. In some embodiments, the reinforcing polymer may have a Tg of 60°C or higher and comprise no MFMs.<br>
Monomers used in preparing reinforcing polymers with a Tg of 60°C or higher include methyl methacrylate, styrene and other styrenic monomers, isobornyl methacrylate, and t-butyl methacrylate.<br>

It is also preferred that monomers having two sites of alpha, beta-ethylenic unsaturation be selected from the diacrylates and dimethacrylates. It is also preferred that monomers having three sites of alpha, beta-ethylenic unsaturation be selected from the triacrylates and trimethacrylates. In another embodiment, it is preferred that the monomer having two sites of alpha, beta-ethylenic unsaturation be selected from a group comprising multifunctional styrenic monomers, such as divinyl benzene, which may either be used alone or in combination with other suitable MFMs. Of the preferred diacrylates and dimethacrylates, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,6-hexene diol diacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, and tripropylene glycol diacrylate are especially preferred.

Preferably, the monomers used to form the reinforcing polymer should be selected such that they comprise a substantial proportion of monomer having low water solubility. Low levels, less than about 5% by weight based on the total weight of reinforcing polymer, of water soluble monomers such as ethylenically<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids such as methacrylic acid or acrylic acid may be included in the monomers used to form the reinforcing polymer. Examples of MFMs which have low water solubility include trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (water solubility at 25°C: 
Additionally, the pressure sensitive adhesive may contain plasticizers, tackifiers, crosslinkers, multi-valent metal ion salts, defoamers, thickeners, rheology modifiers, pigments, and wetting agents.<br>
Specific tackifiers useful in the present invention include both high softening point tackifiers and low softening point tackifiers. Typically they are present in ranges from upper limits of 50, 35 and 25 wt.% to lower limits of 0.5, 1 and 2 wt.% based on total weight of polymer. All ranges are inclusive and combinable. As used herein, high softening point tackifiers are defined as tackifiers having a softening point of 100°C or greater, preferably from 100 to 130°C; and low softening point tackifiers have a softening point of less than 100°C, preferably from 70 to up to 100°C. The tackifier resins include rosins, rosin esters, C5 and C9 based hydrocarbons, and hybrid blends of rosin and hydrocarbon resin. Typically these compounds are added as an aqueous dispersion.   In one embodiment of the invention, the emulsion polymer further comprising tackifier with a softening point of 70°C or higher.<br>
Preferably, after the addition of monomer used to form the reinforcing polymer to the first stage polymer, sufficient time is allowed to permit the monomer to swell the latex particles. The monomer used to form the reinforcing polymer may be selected to include only those monomers which have low water solubility. By low water-solubility is meant a solubility in water at ambient temperature of less than about 2 g /100 g of water (2 wt.%). Preferably, the monomer is allowed to swell the first stage polymer until the monomer swollen first stage polymer has been swollen essentially to equilibrium with the additional alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Preferably, less than<br>
50%, more preferable less than 10%, most preferably less than 5% of the monomers used to form the reinforcing polymer are polymerized prior to completion of the addition of the monomers used to form the reinforcing polymer. The aqueous dispersion may be agitated during the swelling process.<br>
After the first stage polymer has been swollen essentially to equilibrium, the monomer used to form the reinforcing polymer is polymerized within the monomer swollen initial latex polymer. That is, effective amount of initiator or other polymerization promoter is not present or introduced to the monomer mix until the first stage polymer has been swollen essentially to equilibrium; the condition prior to the introduction of effective amount of initiator or other promoter(s) is what is referred to herein as conditions wherein no significant polymerization occurs. Such conditions may be achieved by reducing polymerization in the aqueous dispersion by; l) destroying residual initiator(s) used to form the first stage polymer by, for example, maintaining the dispersion of first stage polymer at such a temperature and for such a time as to decompose the initiator(s) thermally! 2) destroying residual initiator(s) used to form the first stage polymer by the addition of an appropriate reducing agent; 3) reducing or eliminating the formation of radicals in the dispersion by reducing the temperature of the dispersion; 4) the addition of free radical inhibitors to the dispersion; or combinations of two or more of the above. This second or subsequent stage polymerization may be initiated by conventional free radical generating initiator systems. Preferably the initiation occurs by way of redox initiation.<br>

The test results described in Table 2 were performed as described below.<br>
Preparing Adhesive Strips for testing<br>
A sheet of corona treated 50 micron polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film was direct coated with the wet emulsion PSA on a RK Print Coat Instruments K 202 Control Coater using a US-56 meyer rod, set at speed 4 to deliver a 50 g/m2 coat weight. The coated PET sheet was allowed to air dry for 10 minutes and then oven dried at 105°C for 3 minutes. The PET facestock coated with the PSA was then closed with a Chemsultants RP-12 silicone release liner. The sheet was cut into 1 inch wide strips with the grain of the drawdown using a standard cutting board. The cut strips were then aged overnight in a controlled temperature and humidity room at 22°C and 50% humidity. The adhesive strips were then ready to be used for testing.<br>
24 hour Stainless Steel (SS) 180° Peel<br>
The release liner of an adhesive strip was removed and then the exposed strip was applied lengthwise to a clean 5 cm by 15 cm stainless steel panel. The panel with the strip on it was then placed on a Chemlnstruments Rolldown automated roller which applied a 2 kg roller at a rate of 30 cm per minute to the panel. The prepared strip was then aged in a temperature and humidity controlled room at 22°C and 50% humidity for 24 hours.   After 24 hours, the strip on the panel was mounted onto an Analogic Measurometer II peel tester to perform 180° peel at a rate of 30 cm per minute. Measurements were in ounces which were converted into pounds (l pound = 16 ounces = 4.4 Newtons).<br>
2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 1.8 kg Room Temperature (RT) Shear Test:<br>
The release liner of an adhesive strip was removed and then the exposed strip was applied lengthwise to a clean 5 cm by 15 cm stainless steel panel with about an inch of the strip hanging over the end of the panel. The panel with the strip on it was then placed on a Chemlnstruments Rolldown automated roller which applied a 2 kg roller at a rate of 30 cm per minute to the panel. A set 2.5 cm metal stamp was placed over the end of the panel with the extra length of strip hanging over, and with a blade, a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm section of the strip was cut. The remaining length of the tape was removed from the panel and then the panel was prepared for the shear bar. The extra tape hanging over the panel was reinforced with a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm cardboard square and then further reinforced with masking tape and staples. Next a hole punch was used to create a hole in the middle of the reinforced overhanging area.   The panel was then mounted into a slot on a Scientific Machine &amp; Co. shear bar. The timer was zeroed and a 1.8 kg weight was hung from the hole in the strip. Measurements were in hours.<br>
Hot Shear at 65°C<br>
The release liner of an adhesive strip was removed and then the exposed strip was applied width wise to a clean 5 cm by 7.5 cm stainless steel panel with<br>
about 2.5 cm of the strip hanging over the end of the panel. The panel with the strip on it was then placed on a Chemlnstruments Rolldown automated roller which applied a 2 kg roller at a rate of 30 cm per minute to the panel. A set 2.5 cm metal stamp was placed over the end of the panel with the extra length of strip hanging over, and with a blade, a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm section of the strip was cut. The remaining length of the tape was removed from the panel and then the panel was prepared for the hot shear test. The extra tape hanging over the panel was reinforced with a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm cardboard square and then further reinforced with masking tape and staples. Next a hole punch was used to create a hole in the middle of the reinforced overhanging area.   The panel was then mounted into a slot on a Chemlnstruments 30 Bank Shear Tester which was in a Gruenberg oven set at 65°C. The timer was zeroed and a 1kg weight was hung from the hole in the strip. Measurements were in minutes.<br>
Shear Adhesion Failure Temperature (SAFT)<br>
The release liner of an adhesive strip was removed and then the exposed strip was applied width wise to a clean 5 cm by 7.5 cm stainless steel panel with about 2.5 cm of the strip hanging over the end of the panel. The panel with the strip on it was then placed on a Chemlnstruments Rolldown automated roller which applied a 2 kg roller at a rate of 30 cm per minute to the panel. The roller completed a full cycle, up and back, on the panel to complete applying the proper amount of pressure to the panel. A set 2.5 cm metal stamp was placed over the end of the panel with the extra length of strip hanging over, and with a blade, a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm section of the strip was cut. The remaining length of the tape was removed from the panel and then the panel was prepared for the SAFT test. The extra tape hanging over the panel was reinforced with a 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm cardboard square and then further reinforced with masking tape and staples. Next a hole punch was used to create a hole in the middle of the reinforced overhanging area.   The panel was then mounted into a slot on a Chemlnstruments 30 Bank Shear Tester which was in a Gruenberg oven set at 40°C. The timer was zeroed and a 1kg weight was hung from the hole in the strip and the SAFT program was initiated. There was a 20 minute hold at 40°C,<br>
then a 0.5°C rise in temperature per minute up to 205°C when the test was terminated. Measurements were in minutes and then converted to temperature via a SAFT chart to give the adhesive SAFT temperature.<br>
Loop Tack Test<br>
The release liner of a 12.5 cm adhesive strip was removed and then the exposed strip was fashioned into a loop by having its ends touch with the adhesive side out. Masking tape was wrapped around the ends to secure the loop and a staple was put in that secured area to create an edge for a better connection to the loop tester.   The secured end of the loop was mounted into the clamp of a Chatillon DFMIO loop tack tester. A 2.5 cm wide stainless steel panel was then mounted and screwed down to the substrate area. The load cell was zeroed and the test was started. The loop was brought down to cover the 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm cross section of the panel and then was immediately brought up to measure tack. Measurements were in pounds (1 pound = 4.4 Newtons).<br>
