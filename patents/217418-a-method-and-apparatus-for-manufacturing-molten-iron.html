(a) Field of the Invention<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   an   apparatus   and   method   for<br>
manufacturing molten irons, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for<br>
manufacturing molten irons in which iron ores and additives are dried white being<br>
10          conveyed, and, then by the sensible heat of exhaust gas of a fluidized-bed reactors,<br>
the iron ores and additives are charged to the fluidized-bed reactors to the thereby<br>
manufacture molten irons.<br>
(b) Description of  the Related Art<br>
The iron and steel industry is a core industry that supplies the basic<br>
15           materials needed in construction and in the manufacture of automobiles, ships,<br>
home appliances, and many of the other products we use. It is also an industry with<br>
one of the longest histories that has progressed together with humanity. In an iron<br>
foundry, which plays a pivotal roll in the iron and steel industry, after molten irons<br>
(i.e., pig iron in a molten state) are produced using iron ores and coats as raw<br>
20           materials, steel is produced from the molten irons then supplied to customer.<br>
Approximatety 60% of the world's iron production is realized using the blast<br>
furnace method developed in the 14th century. ln the blast furnace method, coke<br>
produced using as raw materials iron ores and bituminous coal that have undergone<br>
a sintering process are placed in a blast furnace, and oxygen is supplied to the<br>
25              furnace to reduce the iron ores to iron to thereby manufacture molten irons. The<br>
blast furnace method, which is a main aspect of molten Irons production, requires<br>
raw materials having a hardness of at least a predetermined level and grain size that<br>
can ensure ventilation in the furnace. Coke in which a specific raw coal that has<br>
undergone procassing is needed 35 a carbon source used as fuel and a reducing<br>
30              agent Also, sintered ore that has undergone a successive compacting process is<br>
needed as an iron source. Accordingly, in the modern blast furnace method, it is<br>
necessary to include raw material preparation and processing equipment such as<br>
coke manufacturing equipment and sintering equipment. Therefore, not only is it<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
necessary to obtain accessory equipment in addition to the blast furnace, but<br>
equipment to prevent and minimize the generation of pollution in the accessory<br>
equipment ta needed. The amount of investment therefore, is considerable,<br>
ultimately increasing manufacturing costs.<br>
5                           In order to solve these problems of the blast furnace method, significant<br>
effort is being put forth in iron foundries all over the world to develop a smelting<br>
reduction process that produces molten irons by directly using fine coal as fuel and<br>
a reducing agent, and also directly using fine ores, which make up over 80% of the<br>
world's ore production, as an iron source.<br>
10                          The smelting reduction process typically uses a two-stage process of<br>
preliminary reduction and final reduction. The conventional molten Iron<br>
manufacturing apparatus includes a fluidized-bed reactor that forms fluidized beds,<br>
and a melter-gasifier that forms coal packed bed and that is connected thereto. Iron<br>
ores and additives at room temperature are charged in the fluidized-bed reactor to<br>
15            undergo preliminary reduction. Since high-temperature reduced gas is supplied from<br>
trie metter-gasifier to the fluidized-bed reactor, that iron ores and additives increase<br>
in temperature as a result of making contact with the high-temperature reduced gas.<br>
At the same time, 90% or more of the iron ores and additives at room temperature<br>
are reduced, and 30% or more of the same are calcined and charged to the melter-<br>
20            gasifier.<br>
Coal is supplied to the meller-gasifier to form a coal packed bed, and the<br>
iron ones and additives at room temperature undergo smelting and slagging in the<br>
coal packed bed to be discharged as molten irons and slag. Oxygen is supplied<br>
through a plurality of tuyeres installed to an outer wall of the melter-gasifier such that<br>
25            the  coal packed bed is burned and then the oxygen is converted into  high<br>
temperature reduced gas, after which the high temperature reduced gas is supplied<br>
to the fluidized-bed reactor. Following reduction of the iron ones and additives at<br>
room temperature, they are exhausted outside. A temperature of the emitted<br>
exhaust gas is approximately 680ºC, and a pressure thereof is 1.7—2.5bar.<br>
30                           In the case where iron ores are charged to the fluidized-bed reactor for<br>
reduction into reduced iron, in order to prevent the reduced iron from sticking to the<br>
fluidized-bed  reactor and in order to prevent thermal loss in the melter-gasifier,<br>
additives such as limestone and delomite are charged to the fludized-bed reactor<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
together with the iron ones. The additives are typically around 15-20% of the total<br>
amount of the charged material.<br>
Prior to charging the iron ores and additives to the fluidized-bed reactor, the<br>
iron ores and additives are dried in a drying apparatus to thereby ensure the free<br>
5              Row of these materials in the fluidized-bed reactor. To perform this operation hot air<br>
is supplied to the drying apparatus to dry the iron ores and the additives. Since the<br>
iron ores makes up 80% or more of the combination with the additives, overall<br>
operating conditions are determined based on the requirements of the iron ore.<br>
However, because the additives have a grain size and density that are less than that<br>
10              of the iron one, a significant amount of loss of the additives with a small grain size<br>
occurs if dried under the same conditions as the iron ore. Further, the drying<br>
apparatus frequently malfunctions since a substantial load is given to the same in<br>
order to realize favorably drying. Finally, 50% or more of the iron ores become fine<br>
ore of 1mm or less to thereby clog the drying apparatus, thereby necessitating<br>
15              frequent production stoppages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
20            detail with reference to the accommpanying drawings. It should be clearly understood<br>
that many variations and/or modifications of the basic inventiva concepts may<br>
appear to those skilled in the present art. The embodiments are to be regarded as<br>
illustrative in nature, and not restrictive.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an apparatus for manufacturing molten irons<br>
25            according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus dries and<br>
conveys iron ores and additives, and supplies the same to a fluidized-bed reactor.<br>
An apparatus  100 for manufacturing molten irons according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention includes the main elements of a fluidized-bed<br>
reactor unit 20, a melter-gasifier 10, a raw material supplying unit 60 and other<br>
30            accessory equipments. The fluidized-bed reactof Unit 20 includes one or more<br>
fluidizedS-bed reactors having a fluidized bed therein, and acts to reduce and calcine<br>
iron ores and additives to reduced material. The reduced material is charged to the<br>
melter-gasifier 10, which includes a coal packed bed therein, and oxygen is supplied<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
to the melter-gasifier 10 is gasified by a pyrolysis reaction at an upper area of the<br>
coal packed bed and by a combustion reaction by oxygen at a lower area of the coal<br>
packed bed. Hot reduced gas generated in the melter-gasifier 10 by the gasified<br>
reaction is supplied in succession to the fluidized-bed reactors through a reduced<br>
5            gas supply line L59, which is connected to a rear and of the final reducing reactor 27,<br>
to be used as a reducing agent and fluidized gas.<br>
A dome-shaped empty space is formed to an area above a coal packed<br>
bed of the melter-gasifier 10. The flow rate of gas is reduced by the empty space<br>
such tnat large amounts of fine powder included in the charged reduced material<br>
10            and fine powder generated as a result of an abrupt increase in temperature of coal<br>
charged in the melter-gasifier 10 are prevented from being discharged out of the<br>
meltar-gasifier 10. Further, such a configuration, allows for absorbing of variations in<br>
pressure in the melter-gasifier 10 caused by irregular changes in the amount of gas<br>
generated as a result of directly using coal. The coal is gasified and removes volatile<br>
15            members therein while dropping to the bottom of the coal packed bed, and is<br>
ultimately burned as a result of oxygen supplied through tuyeres at the bottom of tha<br>
melter-gasifier The generated combustion gas raises through the coal packed bed,<br>
and is converted into high temperature reduced gas and exhausted to outside the<br>
melter-gasifier 10. Part of the combustion gas is scrubbed and cooled while passing<br>
20            through water collecting devices 51 and 53 such that pressure applied to the melter-<br>
gasifier 10 is maintained within the range of 3.0-3.5 atmospheres.<br>
A cyclone 14 collects exhaust gas generated in the melter-gasifier 10 such<br>
that dust is again supplied to the melter-gasifier 10, and gas is supplied as reduced<br>
gas to the fluidized-bed reactors through the reduced gas supply line L59.<br>
25                            Reduced iron drops to the bottom of the coal packed bed together with the<br>
coal to undergo final reduction and smelling by combustion gas and combustion<br>
heat generated by gasifying and combusting coal, after which the iron is exhausted<br>
to the outside.<br>
The raw material supplying unit 60 that uses the exhaust gas exhausted<br>
30             from the fluidized-bed reactors includes an iron ore hopper 30, an additive hopper<br>
40, and a, conveying, line L57, and acts to dry and convey iron ores and additives to<br>
the fluidized-bed reactor unit 20, iron ores and additives discharged respectively<br>
from the iron ore hopper 30 and the additive hopper 40 are supplied to the rock<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
hopper 21 through the conveying Itna L57 connected to an iron ores supply Iine L30<br>
and an additive supply line L40. Among the fluidized-bed reactors, part of the<br>
exhaust gas exhausted from the pre-heating reactor 23 is supplied to the conveying<br>
line L57 through a branched exhaust gas branched line L55. The conveying line L57<br>
5           is extended vertically, and iron ores and additives are supplied to the conveying line<br>
L57 at a location 1 —2m higher than the supply position of exhaust gas. If iron ores<br>
and additives are supplied from a location 1 -2m higher than the supply position of<br>
exhaust gas, scattering loss of the iron ones and additives occurring during drying<br>
and conveying is minimized, and the area of contact with the exhaust gas is<br>
10           maximized such that it is possible to dry and convey the iron ores and additives very<br>
efficiently. The supply position of the iron ones and additives from the conveying line<br>
157 shown in FIG. 1 is used for illustrative purposes and does not restrict the<br>
present invention. Accordingly, it is only necessary that the conditions described<br>
above be satisfied.<br>
15                        Iron ores and additives are died and conveyed by the exhaust gas exiting<br>
the exhaust gas branched line L55 that is connected to the lower port of the<br>
conveying fine L57 to be charged in the rock hopper 21. The amount of exhaust gas<br>
branched and used in diving and conveying is preferably 20—40% of the exhaust<br>
gas amount exhausted from the fluidized-bed reactors. If this amount of exhaust-gas<br>
20           is used, an amount of dried and conveyed iron ores and additives is sufficient to<br>
manufacture molten irons.<br>
If iron ores having a grain size of 8mm or less is used, volume and density<br>
are relatively low such mat a smooth supply to the rock hopper 21 is possible.<br>
Further, a suitable flow speed of the exhaust gas in the conveying line L57 is<br>
25           10-30m/s. If the flow speed of the exhaust gas is less than 10m/s. the pressure at<br>
the bottom part of the conveying line L57 increases to destabilize the flow of the<br>
exhaust gas. On the other hand, it the flow of the exhausit gas exceeds 30m/s.<br>
scattering loss may occur.<br>
Hence, by using the exhaust gas as a conveying gas of the iron ores and<br>
30           additives and drying the same by the sensible heat of the exhaust gas, the exhaust<br>
gas may be recycled to thereby save energy, and drying may be stably realized.<br>
Since drying and conveying occur simultaneously in the conveying line L57, the<br>
number of different types of equipment used for drying and conveying is significantly<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
reduced. Especially, the amount of iron ores ami additives, supplied to the conveying<br>
line L57 may be adjusted respectively by an iron ore valve V30 and an additive<br>
valve V40, and the amount of the exhaust gas supplied to tha conveying line L57<br>
may be adjusted by an exhaust gas valve V55.<br>
5                            In the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention, iron ores and additives are selectively<br>
supplied to the conveying line L57 according to operating conditions to thereby<br>
realize drying and conveying. in the case where additives are supplied to the<br>
conveying line L57 to realize drying and conveying. the valve V40 is opened while<br>
10            the valve V30 is closed such that only the additives are dried and conveyed. In this<br>
case, the flow speed of the exhaust gas supplied to the conveying line L57 is<br>
preferably 1u~20m/s. If the flow speed of the exhaust gas is less than 10m/s,<br>
additives charged to a lower part of the conveying line L57 are not fully transported<br>
in the conveying line L57, and some particles are accumulated in the lower part of<br>
15            the conveying line L57. Therefore, a pressure at the lower part of the conveying line<br>
L57 is significantly increased such that flow in the conveying line L57 is made<br>
unstable. On the other hand, a flow speed of the exhaust gas exceeding 20m/s<br>
not suitable since the grain size of the additives is too  small. Here the amount of<br>
iron ores that is processed is approximately 100~ 130 tons/day, and the amount of<br>
20            additives processed is approximately  15—30 tons/day.<br>
Further, in the case where iron ones are supplied to the conveying line L57<br>
to be dried and conveyed, the valve V30 is opened while the valve V40 is dosed<br>
such that only the iron ores are dried and conveyed. In this case, the flow speed of<br>
the exhaust gas supplied to the conveying line L57 is preferably slightly greater. As<br>
20            a result of the greater particle size and density of the iron ores compared to the<br>
additives, the Flow speed of the exhaust gas is preferabty 20-30m/s. As described<br>
above, the iron ores and additives may be separately dried and conveyed as in the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, or may be mixed then dried and conveyed.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic view of an spparatus for manufacturing molten it irons<br>
30            according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An apparatus 200 for manufacturing molten irons according to the second<br>
embodiment of  the present invention shown in FIG. 2 is identical to that of the first<br>
embodiment except for a raw material supply unit 65. Aocordingly, elements of the<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
apparatus 200 for manufacturing molten irons identical to the elements of the first<br>
embodiment wilI not be described, and the explanation will be concentrated on the<br>
raw material supply unit 65.                                                                                                            <br>
As shown in FIG. 2. the raw material supply unit 65 includes the iron ore<br>
5             hopper 30, the additive hopper 40, a drying assembly 61, an iron ore storage bin 34.<br>
an additive storage bin 44, and conveyor belts 63 and 66.<br>
An iron ore supply line L31 connected to the iron ore hopper 30 and an<br>
additive supply line L41 connected to the additive hopper 40 are connected to the<br>
drying assembly 61 to supply iron ores and additives thereto. The drying assembly<br>
10            61 supplies hot air to a lower area of its dispersing plate such that iron ores and<br>
additives are dried white being vibrated to a fluidized bed state. Iran ores and<br>
additives dried in the drying assembly 81 are stored respectively in the iron ore<br>
storage bin 34 and the additive storage bin 44. The dried and stored iron ores and<br>
additives are transmitted by the first conveyor belt 63. The first conveyor belt 63 is<br>
15             connected to the vertical second conveyor belt 65 such that the dried iron ores and<br>
additives are charged to the rock hopper 21.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention is used by connecting the<br>
conveying line L57 to the above apparatus. Iron ores are supplied to the conveying<br>
line L57 through an iron  ore by pass Line L33 connected to the iron one supply line<br>
30             L31, and additives are supplied to the conveying line L57 through an additive<br>
bypass line L43 connected to the additive supply line L41. Accordingly, iron ores<br>
and additives are formed into an iron-containing mixture and dried immediately prior<br>
to supply to the fluidized-bed reactors having fluidized beds.<br>
Especially, the apparatus 200 for manufacturing molten irons of the second<br>
25             embodiment provides particular convenience by using the bypass lines  L33 and L43<br>
when the drying assembly 61 malfunctions or an excessivg load is given to the<br>
drying assembly B1.<br>
That is, in the case where the drying assembly 61 malfunctions, valves V31<br>
and V41 directed to the drying assembly 61 are closed, while valves L33 and L43<br>
30              respectively mounted on the bypass lines L33 and L43 are opened such that iron<br>
ores and additives are directly supplied to the conveying line L57. Further, the valve<br>
V55 is opened such that exhaust gas is supplied to the conveying line L57 through<br>
the exhaust gas branched line L55, resulting in drying and conveying iron ores and<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
additives to the rock hopper 21. Accordingly, iron ores and additives are<br>
continuously dried and conveyed to enable charging to the fluidized-bed reactors,<br>
thereby allowing the manufacture of molten irons to be more flexibly performed.<br>
In the case where a significant load is applied to the drying assembly 61.<br>
5           the valves V33 and V43 are opened in a state where both the valves V31 and V41<br>
directed to the drying assembly 61 are opened such that part of the iron ores and<br>
additives supplied to the drying assembly 61 are supplied to the conveying line L57.<br>
Therefore, the load applied to the drying assembly 61 is minimized.<br>
The present invention will be described in greater detail below through an<br>
10           experimental example. This experimental example merely illustrates the present<br>
invention and is not meant to limit the present invention.<br>
Experimental Example<br>
Iron ores and  additives of limestone were dried and conveyed through a<br>
conveying line. The properties of the iron ores and additives used in this case are as<br>
15            shown in Table I below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Among  the  exhaust  gas  exhausted  from   the  fluidized-bed   reactors,<br>
20—40% was branched and supplied to the conveying line. The details of the<br>
20            exhaust gas supplied to the conveying line are as shown in Table 2 below.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
In the case where iron ores and the additives of limestone are each<br>
supplied to the conveying line, the size of the conveying line extended vertically, and<br>
the gas flow rate and pressure drops in the conveying line are as shown in Table 3<br>
below.<br>
5                          Tabla 3<br><br>
Results of comparing water content prior to drying and following drying and<br>
conveying of the iron ores and additives in the conveying line are shown in Table 4<br>
below.<br>
10                     Table4<br><br>
As shown in Table 4. when the iron ores and additives are dried through<br>
the conveying line, the amount of water content therein is significantly reduced,<br>
thereby indicatirg that conveying and drying are efficiently realized.<br>
15                        The present indention has the advantage of being able to use Fine ores and<br>
fine additives. That is by using iron was and additives of a minimal grain size, these<br>
materials may be conveyed and  simultaneously dried using exhaust gas.<br>
In the present invention, since exhausted gas amitted from fluidized beds are<br>
branched and used, the amount of waste gas is reduced and energy may be reused.<br>
20                       In particular, by drying the iron ores and additives immidiately prior to<br>
supplying the same to fluidized beds, pre-heating and reduction rates in the fluidized<br>
beds are further increased.<br>
Also, since the present invention may be applied to general drying<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/057037    PCT/KR2003/002814<br>
assemblies, precautions may ba taken against any problems that may occur with the<br>
drying assembly and load applied to the drying assembly may be dispersed such<br>
that the apparatus for an manufacturing molten irons may be more flexibly operated.<br>
A mixture containing iron is reduced using multiple stages of fluidized beds<br>
5           such that a reduction material that has been fully reduced and calcined may be<br>
obtained.<br>
Although embodiments of the present invention have been described in<br>
detail herein above in connection with certain exemplary embodiments, it should be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments,<br>
10           but, on the contrary is intended: to cover various modifications and/or equivalent<br>
