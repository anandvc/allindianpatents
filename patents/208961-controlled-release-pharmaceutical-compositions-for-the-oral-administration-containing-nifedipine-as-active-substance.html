CONTROLLED    RELEASE    PHARMACEUTICAL    COMPOSITIONS    FOR    THE    ORAL<br>
ADMINISTRATION CONTAINING NIFEDIPINE AS ACTIVE SUBSTANCE<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The nifedipine represents the most studied and used inhibitor of the<br>
passage of the calcium ions in the slow flowing channels which affect<br>
the myocardium, the vasal smooth musculature and the sinoatrial (SA)<br>
and atrioventricular (AV) nodes.<br>
The administration of nifedipine determines an increase of the<br>
coronary flow and a reduction of the peripheral vascular resistances<br>
while it has not practical interference with the SA and AV nodes.<br>
Consequently the nifedipine has been used for years for the<br>
hypertensive forms therapy and for the anginal syndrome control in<br>
often multifactorial therapeutical protocols and for treatments<br>
protracted in time, as a result of the chronic proceeding of such<br>
pathologies.<br>
The nifedipine is a crystalline powder, insoluble in water, soluble in<br>
acetone and in other organic solvents, sensitive to light of different<br>
wavelengths, including the ultraviolet one.<br>
The absorption of the nifedipine presents a strong interindividual<br>
variability and, as it is a matter of the reference drug of an<br>
important therapeutical category, several studies have been directed<br>
to verify possible correlations among the physical characteristics,<br>
the pharmaceutical forms and the therapeutic efficacy.<br>
The poor solubility in water of nifedipine in crystals causes in fact<br>
a low bioavailability.<br>
For the above reported problems various solutions have been proposed<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
which, however, show the drawback to give unsatisfactory results or<br>
they result being excessively complex.<br>
The importance of the crystals size, for therapeutic efficacy<br>
purposes, is proved in the Patent EP 0047899, wherein the formulations<br>
obtained from very fine nifedipine crystals, having a specific surface<br>
ranging from 0.5 to 6 m2 /g, are proposed.<br>
In the Patent EP 0220760B1, the nifedipine bioavailability is<br>
correlated to the micronization processes of the active principle in<br>
order to obtain "an extremely high specific surface".<br>
Even technically complex solutions such as the nifedipine dissolution<br>
in derivatives of the tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and the subsequent<br>
dosage in capsules of soft gelatin have been adopted (Patent EP<br>
0143857) in order to overcome the variables linked to the crystals<br>
size.<br>
The Patent EP 0315960 proposes aqueous or hydro-alcoholic solutions  in<br>
order  to  increase-the  bioavailability:   certainly   the  variability<br>
linked   to   the   crystals   is   overcome   but   problems   such   as   a   lower<br>
stability and a greater productive complexity are introduced.<br>
The  Patent  W0  93/13773  describes   controlled  release   formulations<br>
obtained      from      a      mixture      of      3       components       (nifedipine,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone or derivatives,   and  acrylic  based  polymers)<br>
which,    deposited   on   particles   of   a   hydrosoluble   carrier,    allows   to<br>
obtain formulations  suitable for a single daily administration.<br>
The  Patent  GB  2166651A  concerns   the  production  of   controlled   release<br>
microparticles   from 0.1   to  125   micrometers,   named   "pharmasomes",<br>
obtained  by   a   complex   technique   wherein   the   drug   (nifedipine   in   the<br>
Example   no.    3)    and   suitable   polymers   are   solubilized   and   then<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
emulsionated. The solvent phase is subsequently removed in order to<br>
obtain a powder coated to mask the flavour or to obtain the controlled<br>
release.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The problems of the prior art are overcome by the controlled release<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for the oral administration containing<br>
nifedipine as active substance according to the present invention.<br>
Said compositions comprise:<br>
-	an amorphous coprecipitate of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone:<br>
-	a hydrophile derivative of cellulose in an amount by weight ranging from 0.1. to 6 times with respect to the nifedipine;<br>
-	carboxypolymethylene and lactose in an amount by weight ranging from 0.1 to 5 times with respect to the nifedipine and<br>
-	a protective or-retarding superficial coating.<br>
Said compositions may be prepared in tablets or capsules shape having<br>
a release time ranging from 8 to 24 hours.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preparation of the controlled release pharmaceutical compositions<br>
for the oral administration containing nifedipine as active substance<br>
according to the present invention first of all provides for the<br>
preparation of an amorphous coprecipitate of nifedipine and<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and subsequently the use of said coprecipitate<br>
for the preparation of compositions in mixture with suitable<br>
excipients.<br>
The coprecipitate of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone is prepared<br>
by the following process.<br>
A solution of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone is prepared in an<br><br>
-4-<br>
organic solvent, preferably methylene chloride, having a concentration of nifedipine ranging from 2.5 to 20% by weight and a ratio by weight between nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone ranging from 1:1 to 1:5.<br>
Then the obtained solution is treated in a spray-drier plant at a temperature equal to 90Â°C.<br>
The obtained coprecipitate has the shape of an amorphous powder and, analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is endothermic melting peak at about 175Â°c free, characteristic of the nifedipine crystals.<br>
In the accompanying drawing Figure 1 the diagram, obtained with the coprecipitate obtained in the Example 1 described below is reported and, for comparison, in Figure 2 the characteristic diagram of the nifedipine crystals is reported. The coprecipitate amorphous character is confirmed by the X-ray crystallogram of Figure 4 relative to the coprecipitate of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone in comparison with the crystallogram of Figure 3 relative to the nifedipine.<br>
The coprecipitate used in the preparation of the compositions according to the present invention has a granulometry lower than 100 micrometers.<br>
The preparation of the compositions in tablets shape is realized according to the following process.<br>
A granulate is prepared by the fluidized bed technique introducing the coprecipitate of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone, a hydrophile derivative of cellulose in an amount by weight ranging from 0.1 to 6 times by weight with respect to the nifedipine and carboxypolymethylene and lactose in an amount by weight ranging from 0.1 to 5 times with respect to the nifedipine. Moreover substances as<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
talc, magnesium stearate and colloidal silica, suitable to aid the<br>
technological process are added.<br>
Purified water is used for the granulation. Then the obtained granules<br>
are transformed in tablets which are coated with a protective or<br>
retarding superficial film.<br>
Said hydrophile derivative of cellulos_e is selected from the group<br>
consisting  of  hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,  hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, or mixtures of the same and other derivatives<br>
of the cellulose.<br>
The retarding superficial coating contains a material selected from<br>
the group consisting of an acrylic polymer, an alkylcellulose,<br>
paraffin, stearic acid, shellac, hydrogenated vegetable oil or a<br>
mixture in any proportion of the previous and possible plasticizers<br>
such as for example diethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, glyceryl<br>
triacetate, polyethylene glycols.<br>
The preparation of the capsule-shaped compositions may be realized<br>
using the same granules used for the tablets, or it may be realized<br>
applying the coprecipitate of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone on<br>
saccharose and starch inert cores which are subsequently coated with<br>
said retarding material in order to obtain spheroidal particles having<br>
a diameter ranging from 700 to 1400 micrometers, using for example the<br>
fluidized bed technique.<br>
As it is observed in the description of the prior art, the nifedipine<br>
is used in therapy for the treatment of diseases such as the essential<br>
hypertension and the angina cordis, with protocols necessarily<br>
protracted in time and frequently in association with other drugs.<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
The   compositions   according   to   the  present   invention  are   able   to   help<br>
the    posological    scheme    for    the    patient    allowing    one    or    two<br>
administrations  a day.<br>
In   fact   the   release   of   the   nifedipine   from   said   compositions   is<br>
modulable  from 8  to  24  hours  by varying the amounts  of  the  hydrophile<br>
derivative   of   cellulose,   of   the   carboxypolymethylene   and   of   the<br>
lactose as shown by the examples.<br>
In   addition  to   the   tablets   and  capsules   shape,   said   compositions  may<br>
also    be    prepared    in    other    forms    such    as    for    example    pills,<br>
confections,   single   dose   or   multi-dose   granules   with   dispenser,<br>
spheroids,   etc.<br>
The nifedipine content for dosage unit is ranging from 0.1 to 400 mg.<br>
Moreover, the compositions according to the present invention have the<br>
advantage to be prepared by a simpler and cheaper process with respect<br>
to the prior art one.<br>
Operating according to the known technique, for example according to<br>
the GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) technology only with<br>
very sophisticated processes it is possible to obtain compositions<br>
having characteristics similar to the compositions according to the<br>
present invention ones. The GITS technique is described in "Nifedipine<br>
Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System" (December 21, 1987- The American<br>
Journal of Medicine, Vol. 83 Suppl. 6B).<br>
For illustrative aim of the invention the following Examples are<br>
reported.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation   of   the   coprecipitate   of   nifedipine   and<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
1.0 Kg of nifedipine and 1.0 Kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone are dissolved<br>
in 18 liters of methylene chloride at room temperature.<br>
The obtained solution is treated in a spray-drier plant at a<br>
temperature equal to 90 0C with double fluid nozzle with external<br>
mixing.<br>
A solid coprecipitate having a ratio by weight between nifedipine and<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone equal to 1:1 and a granulometry lower than 100<br>
micrometers is obtained.<br>
This coprecipitate, analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry<br>
gives a diagram (Figure 1) endothermic melting peak at about 175 Â°C<br>
free characteristic of the nifedipine crystals {Figure 2, reported as<br>
comparison).<br>
Moreover the amorphous character of the coprecipitate is confirmed by<br>
the comparison of the X-ray crystallogram of the Figure 4<br>
(coprecipitate) with the crystallogram of the Figure 3 (nifedipine).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Composition in tablets of 30 mg of nifedipine.<br>
A tablet composition is prepared using the coprecipitate of nifedipine<br>
and polyvinylpyrrolidone 1:1, obtained as previously described, having<br>
a granulometry lower than 100 micrometers.<br>
A granulate is first prepared introducing in a fluid bed plant<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxypolymethylene and talc, in<br>
addition to the coprecipitate of nifedipine and polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
Purified water is used in order to obtain the granules which, mixed<br>
with magnesium stearate and colloidal silica, allow to obtain some<br>
tablets which are subsequently coated with an opaque, protective film.<br>
