				<td>FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a hair conditioning composition comprising silicone polymers containing quaternary groups and a gel matrix. The composition of the present invention can provide improved conditioning benefits such as smooth feel and reduced friction to both damaged hair and non-damaged hair, while providing other benefits such as slippery and slick feel on wet hair.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the surrounding environment and from the sebum secreted by the scalp. The soiling of hair causes it to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. The soiling of the hair necessitates shampooing with frequent regularity.<br>
Shampooing cleans the hair by removing excess soil and sebum. However, shampooing can leave the hair in a wet, tangled, and generally unmanageable state. Once the hair dries, it is often left in a dry, rough, lusterless, or frizzy condition due to removal of the hair's natural oils and other natural conditioning and moisturizing components. The hair can further be left with increased levels of static upon drying, which can interfere with combing and result in a condition commonly referred to as "flyaway hair," or contribute to an undesirable phenomena of "split ends," particularly for long hair.<br>
A variety of approaches have been developed to condition the hair. A common method of providing conditioning benefit to the hair is through the use of hair conditioning agents such as cationic surfactants and polymers, high melting point fatty compounds, low melting point oils, and silicone compounds. Most of these conditioning agents are known to provide conditioning benefits by depositing on the hair.<br>
Human hair becomes damaged due to, for example, shampooing, combing, permanent waves, and/or coloring the hair. Such damaged hair is often left hydrophilic and/or in a rough condition especially when the hair dries, compared to non-damaged or<br>
less damaged hair. There is a need for hair conditioning compositions which provide improved conditioning benefits such as smooth feel and reduced friction on dry hair, especially on damaged hair.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there remains a desire for hair conditioning compositions which provide improved conditioning benefits such as smooth feel and reduced friction on dry hair, especially on damaged hair. There also exists a desire for hair conditioning compositions which provide the above conditioning benefits, while providing other conditioning benefits such as slippery feel and slick feel on wet hair,<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides improved hair conditioning compositions. In accordance with one of the preferred embodiments, there has now been provided a conditioning composition comprising a silicone polymer containing quaternary groups, and a gel matrix. The silicone polymer comprises silicone blocks with greater than about 200 siloxane units. And the gel matrix comprises a cationic surfactant, a high melting point fatty compound, and an aqueous carrier.<br>
Another preferred embodiment includes the composition above combined with at least one additional silicone-based component selected from the group consisting of silicone emulsions, amino silicones, silicone copolyols, and silicone-based quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
The present invention also provides novel intermediates that are useful for employment in hair compositions. One exemplary intermediate comprises a first polymer comprising silicone and a second polymer comprising a silicone, wherein the resulting combination of the two polymers have a tan 8 value of from about 0.01 to about 5.<br>
The present invention further provides unique merchandising systems. The merchandising systems include a hair conditioning composition as provided herein, and a means for communicating a benefit from using the composition. In accordance with one of the preferred embodiments, there has now been provided a merchandising system comprising one of the hau1 conditioning compositions set forth above; and at least one of packaging for the hair conditioner and marketing material pertaining to the hair<br>
conditioner comprising indicia and/or an image providing a communication to consumer related to hair breakage, hair fall out or hair shed, and/or hair strength.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The essential components of the personal care composition are described below. Also included is a nonexclusive description of various optional and preferred components useful in embodiments of the present invention. While the specification concludes with claims that particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
All percentages, parts, and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified. The term "weight percent" may be denoted as "wt.%" herein.<br>
All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The compositions and methods/processes of the present invention can comprise, consist of, and consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, steps, or limitations described herein.<br>
Herein, "mixtures" is meant to include a simple combination of materials and any compounds that may result from their combination.<br>
As used herein, "indicia" means an identifying mark, including text and/or graphics.<br>
As used herein, "image" means a photograph, illustration, and/or other pictorial representation of an object.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the hair conditioning composition of the present invention comprise a silicone polymer containing quaternary groups and a gel matrix. These compositions are prepared by a method comprising the step of mixing the silicone polymer containing quaternary groups with the gel matrix.<br>
Damaged hair is less hydrophobia compared to non-damaged and/or less damaged hair. It is believed that by providing unproved hydrophobicity to hair, the hair conditioning composition can provide improved smooth feel and reduced friction to the hair. It is also believed that the improved hydrophobicity to the hair can be provided by some other preferred features of the present invention, for example, the use of additional materials such as silicones, and/or cationic surfactants. Further, without being limited to the theory, it is believed that unproved hydrophobicity provides improved tolerance to the hair for humidity in the surrounding circumstances, and thus provides reduced frizziness and/or fly-aways on rainy and/or humid days.<br>

substantially free of anionic compounds.   Anionic compounds herein include anionic<br>
surfactants and anionic polymers.    In the present invention, "substantially free of anionic<br>
compounds" means that the composition contains 1% or less, preferably 0.5% or less,<br>
more preferably less than 0.01% of anionic compounds.<br>

The composition of the present invention comprises a gel matrix comprising a cationic surfactant, a high melting fatty compound, and an aqueous carrier. The cationic surfactant, together with the high melting fatty compound, and an aqueous carrier, provides a gel matrix which is suitable for providing various conditioning benefits, especially slippery and slick feel on wet hair. Thus, the silicone polymers containing quaternary groups (described above) and the gel matrix both provide conditioning benefits, such that when combined can impart increased functionality as compared to the individual components.<br>
In view of providing the above gel matrix, the cationic surfactant and the high melting point fatty compound are contained at a level such that the mole ratio of the cationic surfactant to the high melting point fatty compound is in the range of, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:10, more preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:6 or from about 1:1 to about 1:4, in view of providing the above conditioning benefits especially slippery and slick feel on wet hair. Exemplary compositions of the present invention comprise, by weight of the composition, from about 60% to about 99%, preferably from about 70% to about 95%, and more preferably from about 80% to about 95% of a gel matrix including lamellar gel matrix, to which optional ingredients can be added (e.g., silicones).<br><br>
1 .   Cationic Surfactant<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a cationic surfactant. The cationic surfactant is a mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt having the formula (XIII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein one of R?!, R72, R73} and R?4 is selected from an aliphatic group of from about 16 to about 30 carbon atoms or an aromatic, alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 30 carbon atoms; the remainder of R?l, R?25 R?3( and R?4 are independently selected from an aliphatic group of from about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms or an aromatic, alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 8 carbon atoms; and X" is a salt-forming anion such as those selected from halogen, (e.g., chloride, bromide), acetate, citrate, lactate, glycolate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfonate, sulfate, alkylsulfate, glutamate, and alkyl sulfonate radicals. The aliphatic groups can contain, in addition to carbon and hydrogen atoms, ether linkages, and other groups such as amino groups. The longer chain aliphatic groups, e.g., those of about 16 carbons, or higher, can be saturated or unsaturated. Preferably, one of R?!, R72, R73( and R?4 {s seiected from an alkyl group of from about 16 to about 30 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 18 to about 26 carbon atoms, still more preferably from about 22 carbon atoms; the remainder o R?2&gt; R?3s and R?4 are independently selected from the group consisting of CH3, C2H4OH, CH2C6H5, and mixtures thereof; and (X) is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, CH30SO3, and mixtures thereof. It is believed that such mono-long alkyl<br>
quaternized ammonium salts can provide improved slippery and slick feel on wet hair, compared to multi-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salts. It is also believed that mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salts can provide improved hydrophobicity and smooth feel on dry hair, compared to amine or amine salt cationic surfactants.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of such mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants include: behenyl trimethyl ammonium chloride available, for example, with tradename Genamine KDMP from Clariant, with tradename INCROQUAT TMC-80 from Croda and ECONOL TM22 from Sanyo Kasei; stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride available, for example, with tradename CA-2450 from Nikko Chemicals; cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride available, for example, with tradename CA-2350 from Nikko Chemicals; behenyltrimethylammonium methyl sulfate, available from FeiXiang; hydrogenated tallow alkyl trimethyl ammonium chloride; stearyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride; and stearoyl amidopropyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride.<br>
Among them, more preferred cationic surfactants are those having a longer alkyl group, i.e., C22 alkyl group. Such cationic surfactant includes, for example, behenyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and behenyltrimethylammonium methyl sulfate. It is believed that cationic surfactants having a longer alkyl group provide improved hydrophobicity on dry hair, compared to cationic surfactant having a shorter alkyl group. It is also believed that compared to cationic surfactants having a shorter alkyl group, cationic surfactants having a long alkyl group can provide improved hydrophobicity to the hair, especially to damaged hair, when combined with the polyol esters of the present invention. Alternatively, it is believed that cationic surfactant having an adequate length of alkyl group provides improved slippery and slick feel on wet hair, compared to a cationic surfactant having too long an alkyl group. Thus, it is believed that the selection of C22 alkyl group among long alkyl groups provides balanced benefits between<br>
improved hydrophobicity on dry hair and improved slippery and slick feel on wet hair.<br>
The compositions of the present invention preferably comprise the cationic surfactant in amount of from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 1% to about 8%, still more preferably from about 1.5% to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
2.   High Melting Point Fatty Compound<br>
The hair conditioning composition of the present invention comprises a high melting point fatty compound. The high melting point fatty compounds useful herein have a melting point of about 25°C or higher, and are selected from the group consisting<br>
of fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty alcohol derivatives, fatty acid derivatives, and mixtures thereof. It is understood by the artisan that the compounds disclosed in this section of the specification can in some instances fall into more than one classification, e.g., some fatty alcohol derivatives can also be classified as fatty acid derivatives. However, a given classification is not intended to be a limitation on that particular compound, but is done so for convenience of classification and nomenclature. Further, it is understood by the artisan that, depending on the number and position of double bonds, and length and position of the branches, certain compounds having certain required carbon atoms may have a melting point of less than about 25°C. Such compounds of low melting point are not intended to be included in this section. Nonlimiting examples of the high melting point compounds are found in International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, Fifth Edition, 1993, and CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook, Second Edition, 1992.<br>
The high melting point fatty compound can be included in the composition at a level of from about 0.1% to about 20%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%, still more preferably from about 2% to about 8%, by weight of the composition.<br>
The fatty alcohols useful herein are those having from about 14 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms. These fatty alcohols are saturated and can be straight or branched chain alcohols. Nonlimiting examples of fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The fatty acids useful herein are those having from about 10 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from about 12 to about 22 carbon atoms, and more preferably from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms. These fatty acids are saturated and can be straight or branched chain acids. Also included are diacids, triacids, and other multiple acids which meet the requirements herein. Also included herein are salts of these fatty acids. Nonlimiting examples of fatty acids include lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, sebacic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The fatty alcohol derivatives and fatty acid derivatives useful herein include alkyl ethers of fatty alcohols, alkoxylated fatty alcohols, alkyl ethers of alkoxylated fatty alcohols, esters of fatty alcohols, fatty acid esters of compounds having esteriflable hydroxy groups, hydroxy-substituted fatty acids, and mixtures thereof. Nonlimiting examples of fatty alcohol derivatives and fatty acid derivatives include materials such as<br>
methyl stearyl ether; the ceteth series of compounds such as ceteth-1 through ceteth-45, which are ethylene glycol ethers of cetyl alcohol, wherein the numeric designation indicates the number of ethylene glycol moieties present; the steareth series of compounds such as steareth-1 through steareth-10, which are ethylene glycol ethers of steareth alcohol, wherein the numeric designation indicates the number of ethylene glycol moieties present; ceteareth 1 through ceteareth-10, which are the ethylene glycol ethers of ceteareth alcohol, i.e., a mixture of fatty alcohols containing predominantly cetyl and stearyl alcohol, wherein the numeric designation indicates the number of ethylene glycol moieties present; CI-CSQ alkyl ethers of the ceteth, steareth, and ceteareth compounds just<br>
described; polyoxyethylene ethers of behenyl alcohol; ethyl stearate, cetyl stearate, cetyl palmitate, stearyl stearate, myristyl myristate, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether stearate, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether stearate, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether stearate, ethyleneglycol monostearate, polyoxyethylene monostearate, polyoxyethylene distearate, propyleneglycol monostearate, propyleneglycol distearate, trimethylolpropane distearate, sorbitan stearate, polyglyceryl stearate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl distearate, glyceryl tristearate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
High melting point fatty compounds of a single compound of high purity are preferred. Single compounds of pure fatty alcohols selected from the group of pure cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol are highly preferred.

The silicone compound can be included in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 8%, still more preferably from about 0.5% to about 3% by weight of the composition.<br>
The silicone compounds hereof can include volatile soluble or insoluble, or nonvolatile soluble or insoluble silicone conditioning agents. By soluble what is meant is that the silicone compound is miscible with the carrier of the composition so as to form part of the same phase. By insoluble what is meant is that the silicone forms a separate,<br>
discontinuous phase from the carrier, such as in the form of an emulsion or a suspension of droplets of the silicone. The silicone compounds herein may be made by conventional polymerization, or emulsion polymerization.<br>
The silicone compounds for use herein will preferably have a viscosity of from<br>
about 1,000 to about 2,000,000 centistokes at 25°C, more preferably from about 10,000 to about 1,800,000 centistokes, and even more preferably from about 25,000 to about 1,500,000 centistokes. The viscosity can be measured by means of a glass capillary viscometer as set forth in Dow Corning Corporate Test Method CTM0004, July 20,1970, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Silicone compounds of high molecular weight may be made by emulsion polymerization.<br>
Silicone compounds useful herein include polyalkyl polyaryl siloxanes, polyalkyleneoxide-modified siloxanes, silicone resins, amino-substituted siloxanes, and mixtures thereof. The silicone compound is preferably selected from the group consisting of polyalkyl polyaryl siloxanes, polyalkyleneoxide-modified siloxanes, silicone resins, and mixtures thereof, and more preferably from one or more* polyalkyl polyaryl siloxanes.<br>
Polyalkyl polyaryl siloxanes useful here in include those with the following<br>
structure (XIV)<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
 (XIV) wherein R is alkyl or aryl, and x is an integer from about 7 to about 8,000.   A represents •<br>
groups which block the ends of the silicone chains. The alkyl or aryl groups substituted on the siloxane chain (R) or at the ends of the siloxane chains (A) can have any structure as long as the resulting silicone remains fluid at room temperature, is dispersible, is neither irritating, toxic nor otherwise harmful when applied to the hair, is compatible with the other components of the composition, is chemically stable under normal use and storage conditions, and is capable of being deposited on and conditions the hair. Suitable A groups include hydroxy, methyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, and aryloxy. The two R groups on the silicon atom may represent the same group or different groups.<br><br>
Preferably, the two R groups represent the same group. Suitable R groups include<br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, phenyl, methylphenyl and phenylmethyl. The preferred silicone<br>
compounds	are	polydimethylsiloxane,	polydiethylsiloxane,	and<br>
polymethylphenylsiloxane. Polydimethylsiloxane, which is also known as dimethicone, is especially preferred. The polyalkylsiloxanes that can be used include, for example, polydimethylsiloxanes. These silicone compounds are available, for example, from the General Electric Company in their ViscasilR and SF 96 series, and from Dow Corning in their Dow Corning 200 series. Polymethylphenylsiloxanes, for example, from the General Electric Company as SF 1075 methyl phenyl fluid or from Dow Coming as 556 Cosmetic Grade Fluid, are useful herein.<br>
Also preferred, for enhancing the shine characteristics of hair, are highly arylated silicone compounds, such as highly phenylated polyethyl silicone having refractive index of about 1.46 or higher, especially about 1.52 or higher. When these high refractive index silicone compounds are used, they should be mixed with a spreading agent, such as a surfactant or a silicone resin, as described below to decrease the surface tension and enhance the film forming ability of the material.<br>
Another polyalkyl polyaryl siloxane that can be especially useful is a silicone gum. The term "silicone gum," as used herein, means a polyorganosiloxane material having a viscosity at 25°C of greater than or equal to 1,000,000 centistokes. It is recognized that the silicone gums described herein can also have some overlap with the above-disclosed silicone compounds. This overlap is not intended as a limitation on any of these materials. Silicone gums are described by Petrarch, and others including U.S. Patent No. 4,152,416, to Spitzer et al., issued May 1, 1979 and Noll, Walter, Chemistry and Technology of Silicones, New York: Academic Press 1968. Also describing silicone gums are General Electric Silicone Rubber Product Data Sheets SE 30, SE 33, SE 54 and SE 76. All of these described references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The "silicone gums" will typically have a mass molecular weight in excess of about 200,000, generally between about 200,000 and about 1,000,000. Specific examples include polydimethylsiloxane, poly(dimethylsiloxane methylvinylsiloxane) copolymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane diphenylsiloxane methylvinylsiloxane) copolymer and mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyalkyleneoxide-modified siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polypropylene oxide modified and polyethylene oxide modified polydimethylsiloxane. These materials are also known as dimethicone copolyols.<br>
Silicone resins, which are highly crosslinked polymeric siloxane systems, are useful herein. The crosslinking is introduced through the incorporation of tri-functional and tetra-functional silanes with mono-functional or di-functional, or both, silanes during manufacture of the silicone resin. As is well understood in the art, the degree of crosslinking that is required in order to result hi a silicone resin will vary according to the specific silane units incorporated into the silicone resin. In general, silicone materials which have a sufficient level of trifunctional and tetrafunctional siloxane monomer units, and hence, a sufficient level of crosslinking, such that they dry down to a rigid, or hard, film are considered to be silicone resins. The ratio of oxygen atoms to silicon atoms is indicative of the level of crosslinking in a particular silicone material. Silicone materials which have at least about 1.1 oxygen atoms per silicon atom will generally be silicone resins herein. Preferably, the ratio of oxygen:silicon atoms is at least about 1.2:1.0. Silanes used in the manufacture of silicone resins include monomethyl-, dimethyl-, trimethyl-, monophenyl-, diphenyl-, methylphenyl-, monovinyl-, and methylvinylchlorosilanes, and tetrachlorosilane, with the methyl substituted silanes being most commonly utilized. Preferred resins are offered by GE Advanced Materials as GE SS4230 and SS4267. Commercially available silicone resins will generally be supplied in a dissolved form in a low viscosity volatile or nonvolatile silicone fluid. The silicone resins for use herein should be supplied and incorporated into the present compositions in such dissolved form, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the silicone resins can enhance deposition of other silicone compounds on the hair and can enhance the glossiness of hair with high refractive index volumes.<br>
Other useful silicone resins are silicone resin powders such as the material given the CTFA designation polymethylsilsequioxane, which is commercially available as<br>
Tospearl™ from GE Toshiba Silicones.<br>
Silicone resins can conveniently be identified according to a shorthand nomenclature system well known to those skilled in the art as the "MDTQ" nomenclature.<br>
Under this system, the silicone is described according to the presence of various siloxane monomer units which make up the silicone. Briefly, the symbol M denotes the mono-functional unit (CH3)3SiOo.s; D denotes the difunctional unit (CH^SiO; T denotes the trifunctional unit (CHsJSiOj^; and Q denotes the quadri- or tetra-functional unit SiO2-<br>
Primes of the unit symbols, e.g., M1, D', T, and Q1 denote substituents other than methyl, and must be specifically defined for each occurrence. Typical alternate substituents include groups such as vinyl, phenyl, amino, hydroxyl, etc. The molar ratios of the various units, either in terms of subscripts to the symbols indicating the total number of each type of unit in the silicone, or an average thereof, or as specifically indicated ratios in combination with molecular weight, complete the description of the silicone material under the MDTQ system. Higher relative molar amounts of T, Q, T' and/or Q1 to D, D', M and/or or M1 in a silicone resin is indicative of higher levels of crosslinking. As discussed before, however, the overall level of crosslinking can also be indicated by the oxygen to silicon ratio.<br>
The silicone resins for use herein which are preferred are MQ, MT, MTQ, MQ and MDTQ resins. Thus, the preferred silicone substiruent is methyl. Especially preferred are MQ resins wherein the M:Q ratio is from about 0.5:1.0 to about 1.5:1.0 and the average molecular weight of the resin is from about 1000 to about 10,000.<br>

in which G is chosen from the group consisting of hydrogen, phenyl, OH, Cj-Cg alkyl and preferably methyl; a is 0 or an integer having a value from 1 to 3, preferably 1 ; b is 0, 1 or 2, preferably 1; n is a number from 0 to 1,999; m is an integer from 0 to 1,999; the sum of n and m is a number from 1 to 2,000; a and m are not both 0; Rj is a monovalent<br>
radical of formula CqH2qL in which q is an integer from 2 to 8 and L is chosen from the groups<br>
in which R2 is chosen from the group consisting of hydrogen, phenyl, benzyl, a saturated hydrocarbon radical, preferably an alkyl radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and<br>
A" denotes a halide ion.<br>

highly preferred amino silicones are those corresponding to formula (XVI) wherein m=0, a=l, q=3, G=methyl, n is preferably from about 400 to about 600, more preferably about<br>
500; and L is -N(CH3)2 or -NH2, more preferably -NH2-   Such highly preferred araino<br>
silicones can be called as terminal aminosilicones, as one or both ends of the silicone chain are terminated by nitrogen containing group.<br>
An especially preferred amino-substituted siloxane corresponding to formula (XVI) is the polymer known as "trimethylsilylamodimethicone," of formula (XVII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In this formula n and m are selected depending on the molecular weight of the compound desired; both a and b denote an integer from 2 to 8.<br>

Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the polypropylene glycol herein deposits onto, or is absorbed into hair to act as a moisturizer buffer, and/or provides one or more other desirable hair conditioning benefits.<br>
The polypropylene glycol useful herein may be either water-soluble, water-insoluble, or may have a limited solubility in water, depending upon the degree of polymerization and whether other moieties are attached thereto.

ELASTICITY AND VISCOSITY<br>
It has been discovered that silicone blends useful in the present invention have a preferred tan 5 value. Tan 8 is a calculation related to the blended material's elasticity, and is equal to loss modulus (G") divided by storage modulus (G'). Loss modulus (G") and storage modulus (G') are measured by the following method:<br>
Instrument: TA AR2000 or AR-G2 Rheometer, using the oscillation mode with a 40 mm diameter 2 degree AL cone and a gap of 57 urn.<br>
Sample Preparation: scoop samples with spatula, and put the sample onto the measurement table of the rheometer without scrambling to avoid generation of bubbles.<br>
Measurement Protocol: 1) equilibrate sample at a temperature of 26.7°C for 4 minutes; 2) begin oscillation at a frequency step of from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz with the oscillation fixed at 5.0 Pa and the temperature at 26.7°C. The loss modulus and storage modulus readings are recorded and available via the rheometer instrumentation.<br>
Exemplary silicone blends have tan 8 values, as recorded at a frequency of 10 Hz and 26.7°C, from about 0.01 to about 5, preferably from about 0.05 to about 1, and more preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.5. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the preferred tan 6 value correlates to an in-use signal of end rinsing and/or clean feeling after rinsing, and consumers accordingly perceive compositions comprising these silicone blends to be superior in comparison to existing products.<br>
The silicone blends also have preferred viscosity values, including, for example, less than about 10,000,000 centistokes, less than about 1,000,000 centistokes, and less than about 500,000 centistokes.

METHOD OF USE<br>
The hair conditioning compositions of the present invention are used in conventional ways to provide conditioning and other benefits. Such method of use depends upon the type of composition employed but generally involves application of an effective amount of the product to the hair or scalp, which may then be rinsed from the hair or scalp (as in the case of hair rinses) or allowed to remain on the hair or scalp (as in the case of gels, lotions, creams, and sprays). "Effective amount" means an amount<br>
sufficient enough to provide a dry conditioning benefit.    In general, from about Ig to about 50g is applied to the hair or scalp.<br>
The composition may be applied to wet or damp hair prior to drying of the hair. Typically, the composition is used after shampooing the hair.   The composition is distributed throughout the hair or scalp, typically by rubbing or massaging the hair or scalp.   After such compositions are applied to the hair, the hair is dried and styled in accordance with the preference of the user.   In the alternative, the composition is applied to dry hair, and the hair is then combed or styled in accordance with the preference of the user.<br>

In the latter case, the lower molecular weight materials can be any which can form a stable blend with the quaternary silicone polymer. Examples of low molecular weight materials include silicones such as decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, oxygen-containing solvents such as dipropyleneglycol-n-butylether, and silicone copolyols. Silicone copolyols are preferred. For the quaternary silicone polymer emulsion, the polymer is emulsified in the presence of an anionic, cationic, nonionic, or amphoteric surfactant, preferably a nonionic or cationic surfactant, by methods well known in the art. In examples containing the silicone quaternary polymer and a silicone copolyol, the two are mixed prior to addition to the product.<br>
Heat deionized water to 85°C. Mix cationic surfactants and high melting point fatty compounds into the water. Maintain the water at a temperature of about 85°C until the components are homogenized and no solids are observed. Cool the mixture to about 55°C and maintain at this temperature to form a gel matrix. Add the indicated quaternary silicone polymer to the gel matrix, either as the emulstion or as the blend with the copolyol. When included, add polyalphaolefin, polypropylene glycols, silicones, and/or polysorbates to the gel matrix. Maintain the gel matrix at about 50°C during this time with constant stirring to assure homogenization. When included, add other additional components such as perfumes and preservatives at this point also. After homogenization, cool to room temperature.<br>
