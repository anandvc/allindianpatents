3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
The present invention relates to an economic process for preparing surface-reacted calcium carbonate. The present invention further relates to a surface-reacted calcium carbonate having an increased BET surface area, and the use of a process for adjusting the BET surface area.<br>
In practice, calcium carbonate is used in huge quantities in the paper, paint, rubber and plastics industries for various purposes such as coatings, fillers, extenders and pigments for papermaking as well as aqueous lacquers and paints and in water treatment, and notably as a means of removing inorganic materials such as heavy metals and/or pharmaceutical waste such as polycyclic compounds, cholesterol and/or endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC).<br>
With respect to precluding aggregation of calcium carbonate particles and enhancing the affinity of these particles with a substance to which the particles are being added, for example as a filler or flocculating agent, the physical and chemical properties of the surfaces of such calcium carbonate particles are amended by treating the calcium carbonate with fatty acid or a sodium salt of a fatty acid, resin acid or other acids.<br>
In the art, several approaches for improving the chemical and physical properties of calcium carbonate have been proposed. For example, US 4,219,590 describes a method for improving calcium carbonate by causing calcium carbonate particles to undergo contact reaction with an acid gas capable of reacting with calcium carbonate for finely uniformizing the calcium carbonate particle size and, at the same time, coating the surface of the calcium carbonate particles with the calcium salt of the acid of the acid gas. US 6,666,953 Bl relates to a pigment, filler or mineral containing a natural calcium carbonate, treated with one of more providers of H3O ions and gaseous CO2, allowing a reduction in the weight of paper for a constant surface area without loss of physical properties when it is used as a pigment or coating filler for said paper. WO 99/02608 Al describes a method of producing a high solids slurry of an acid-resistant precipitated calcium carbonate, wherein a solids slurry is treated<br><br>
with a chemical additive, such as sodium aluminate, in order to impart acid resistance to the calcium carbonate.<br>
Additionally, US 5,584,923, US 5,647,902, US 5,711,799, WO 97/08247 Al and WO 98/20079 Al, respectively, describe calcium carbonate which is acid-resistant to enable its use as a filler material in the making of neutral to weakly acidic paper, and a process for producing this acid-resistant calcium carbonate.<br>
Furthermore, WO 2005/121257 A2 discloses a method for producing a dry mineral pigment characterized in that it contains a product formed in situ by the multiple reaction of a calcium carbonate and with the reaction product or products of said carbonate with gaseous CO2 formed in situ and/or from an external supply; and with at least one compound of formula R-X. WO 2004/083316 Al refers to mineral pigments containing a product formed in situ by the double and/or multiple reaction between a calcium carbonate and the reaction product or products of the said carbonate with one or more moderately strong to strong H3O+ ion donors and the reaction product or products of the said carbonate with gaseous CO2 formed in situ and/or coming from an external supply, and at least one aluminium silicate and/ or at least one synthetic silica and/or at least one calcium silicate and/or at least one silicate of a monovalent salt such as sodium silicate and/or potassium silicate and/or lithium silicate, preferably such as sodium silicate and/or at least one aluminium hydroxide and/or at least one sodium and/or potassium aluminate, used in papermaking applications, such as mass filling and/or paper coating.<br>
US 5,043,017 relates to calcium carbonate, acid-stabilized by the addition to finely divided calcium carbonate of one of a calcium-chelating agent and a conjugate base, such as sodium hexametaphosphate, followed by the addition of an acid, such as phosphoric acid.<br>
However, the prior art seems to be silent on economic methods for preparing and controlling high surface area materials and methods for controlling the particle size<br><br>
of materials allowing for the provision of specific calcium carbonate materials for the desired purpose. In particular, methods for preparing high surface area materials of the prior art require the use of high amounts and concentrations of medium-strong to strong acids (having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5) to obtain a desired material having a high specific BET surface area. Additionally/ the use of such medium-strong to strong acids necessitates the use of high safety requirements in order to minimize the danger to employees. Furthermore, the use of high amounts and concentrations of said medium-strong to strong acids also result in a high and cost-intensive consumption of chemicals and water.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to have a process available which allows for preparing surface-reacted calcium carbonate and provides the possibility of controlling particular parameters such as the specific BET surface area and particle size of the calcium carbonate.<br>
Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an economic process for preparing a surface-reacted calcium carbonate, in which the specific BET surface area of the calcium carbonate can be controlled or adjusted. A further objective of the present invention is the provision of a process for preparing calcium carbonate, in which the specific BET surface area of the calcium carbonate particles is increased. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process, in which the required amount of medium-strong to strong acids is reduced for a given specific BET surface area of a calcium carbonate relative to a material prepared by a process of the prior art implementing only medium-strong to strong acids. Even a further objective of the present invention is to provide a process, in which the specific BET surface area of a calcium carbonate is increased for a given amount of medium-strong to strong acid relative to a material prepared by a process of the prior art implementing only medium-strong to strong acids. A further objective of the present invention is to provide a process, in which the particle size of the calcium carbonate particles can be controlled or adjusted. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process, in which the surface-reacted calcium carbonate can be prepared in high yield.<br><br>
The present invention aims at solving these and other objectives by providing a process for preparing surface-reacted calcium carbonate as described in the present invention and defined in the claims.<br>

According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the product obtained by the inventive process, i.e. the aqueous suspension is dried after step e) in order to preferably yield a dry or solid product.<br>
In the following, the steps a) to e) of the inventive method for preparing surface-reacted calcium carbonate are described in more detail:<br>
Step a): providing calcium carbonate comprising aqueous preparation<br>
According to step a) of the process of the present invention, a calcium carbonate is provided.<br>
Preferably, the calcium carbonate is selected from ground (or natural) calcium carbonate (GCC) and./or precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), which is also known as synthetic calcium carbonate.<br>
GCC is understood to be a naturally occurring form of calcium carbonate, mined from sedimentary rocks such as limestone or chalk, or from metamorphic marble rocks. GCC is almost exclusively of the calcific polymorph, which is said to be trigonal-rhombohedral and represents the most stable of the calcium carbonate polymorphs.<br>
Preferably, the natural calcium carbonate is selected from the group comprising marble, chalk, calcite, dolomite, limestone and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
By contrast, calcium carbonate polymorphs of the PCC type often include, in addition to calcites, less stable polymorphs of the aragonitic-type, which has an orthorhombic, acicular crystal shape, and hexagonal vateritic-type, which has an even lower stability than aragonite. The different PCC forms may be identified according to their characteristic x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) peaks.<br>
PCC synthesis most commonly occurs by a synthetic precipitation reaction that includes a step of contacting carbon dioxide with a solution of calcium hydroxide, the latter being most often provided on forming an aqueous suspension of calcium oxide, also known as burnt lime, and the suspension of which is commonly known as milk of lime. Depending on the reaction conditions, this PCC can appear in various forms, including both stable and unstable polymorphs. Indeed, PCC often represents a thermodynamically unstable calcium carbonate material.<br>
When referred to in the context of the present invention, PCC shall be understood to mean synthetic calcium carbonate products obtained by carbonation of a slurry of calcium hydroxide, commonly referred to in the art as a slurry of lime or milk of lime when derived from finely divided calcium oxide particles in water.<br>
Preferred synthetic calcium carbonate is precipitated calcium carbonate comprising aragonitic, vateritic or calcific mineralogical crystal forms or mixtures thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the calcium carbonate is ground prior to the process for preparing surface-reacted calcium carbonate. The grinding step can be carried out with any conventional grinding device such as a grinding mill known to the skilled person.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the calcium carbonate of step a) has a weight medium diameter of 0.01 um to 10 urn,, and more preferably of 0.5 um to 2 um, as measured according to the measurement method provided in the Examples section here below.<br><br>
In a preferred process for the preparation of the aqueous suspension, the calcium carbonate, either finely divided (such as by grinding) or not, is suspended in water and thus in the form of a slurry.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, said slurry preferably has a pH of less than 11, preferably of less than 10.5, as measured according to the measurement method described in the Examples section here below.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous calcium carbonate slurry has a solids content greater than or equal to 10 wt-%, and more preferably of between 10 wt.-% and 80 wt.-%, based on the weight of the slurry. The applicant would remark that in the case of very high solids contents, it is a requirement to have sufficient water for the reactions following the contacting of step e) to occur. More preferably, the aqueous calcium carbonate slurry has a solid content in the range of 16 wt.-% to 60 wt-%, and even more preferably in the range of 16 wt-% to 40 wt.-% based on the weight of the slurry.<br>
Step b): providing at least one acid having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5<br>
According to step b) of the process of the present invention, 5 wt.-% to 50 wt-%, based on the weight of calcium carbonate, of at least °ne acid having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 is provided, wherein the corresponding acid anion is capable of forming water-insoluble calcium salts. Said insoluble corresponding calcium salts may, in addition to said acid anion, include OH- ions and/ or crystal water.<br>
The H3O+ -ions provided by the at least one acid having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 serve to partially dissolve the calcium carbonate particle, generating calcium ions for subsequent precipitation of an insoluble, at least partially crystalline calcium salt of the anion at the calcium carbonate surface.<br><br>
Preferably, the acid added to the aqueous suspension containing the calcium carbonate has a pKa at 25oC of 2.5 or less. For medium-strong acids such as H3PO4, oxalic acid or mixtures thereof, a pKa at 25°C from 0 to 2.5 may be observed. These one or more medium-strong to strong acids can be added to the suspension as a concentrated solution or diluted solution..<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, H3PO4 is used as the at least one acid having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5. It is especially preferred to use H3PO4 in a concentration of at least 10 % (v/v), more preferably of at least 20 % (v/v) and most preferably of at least 30 % (v/v). In another preferred embodiment, it is preferred to use H3PO4 in a concentration of 20 % to 40 % (v/v).<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the at least one acid having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 is provided in the form of:<br>

It is to be understood by the skilled person that, e.g., 5 % of the time period necessary for continuously adding said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 25 essentially corresponds to the addition of 5 % of the total amount of said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 to be added since the acid according to the present invention preferably is added at the same rate (amount/time).<br>
Said weak acid and/ or its hydrogen saltmay for example be added to the aqueous suspension continuously at essentially the same rate (amount/time) over a period of 15 min or less, preferably over a period of 10 min or less, more preferably over a period of 5 min or less.<br>

For example, the at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid and/or hydrogen salt of said at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid may be added after 5 % or after<br><br>
10 % of the time period necessary for continuously adding said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5. By using route IIIA, it is possible to obtain calcium carbonate particles having an increased weight median diameter. Said process may provide calcium carbonate particles having a median diameter that is at least 5 % greater, more preferably at least 10 % greater and most preferably at least 20 % greater than the median diameter obtained by contacting the same calcium carbonate provided in step a) with gaseous carbon dioxide and the at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid and/or hydrogen salt of said at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid at the end of the process of adding said acidjfs) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5, i.e. for example after 80 % of the time period necessary for continuously adding said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to obtain calcium carbonate particles having a decreased median diameter by using Route IIIA of the inventive process, if the at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid and/or hydrogen salt of said at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid is added near the end of the process of adding said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5, for example after 80 % of the time period necessary for continuously adding said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 (and essentially corresponding to 80 % of the total amount of said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 to be added).<br>
Furthermore, by using Route IIIA of the inventive process, it is also possible to obtain calcium carbonate particles having an increased specific BET surface area. The process may provide calcium carbonate particles having a specific BET surface area that is at least 10 % greater, more preferably at least 15 % greater and even more preferably at least 20 % greater than the specific BET surface area obtained by contacting the same calcium carbonate provided in step a) with the at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid and/or hydrogen salt of said at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid<br><br>

Accordingly, it is possible to selectively control or adjust specific parameters or properties of the calcium carbonate like the specific* BET surface area and the median diameter by using Route IIIA of the inventive process. The addition of the at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid and/or hydrogen salt of said at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid at the end of the process of adding said acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 to the calcium carbonate dispersion may lead to calcium carbonate particles having a decreased or lower specific BET surface area and a lower weight median diameter, whereas the addition of the at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid and/or hydrogen salt of said at least one water soluble non-polymeric organic and/or inorganic weak acid at the beginning of the process of acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 addition, e.g. after 5 wt.-% of the acid(s) having a pKa of less than or equal to 2.5 have been added, may lead to calcium carbonate particles having an increased specific BET surface area and a higher or increased weight median diameter.<br>

Measurement methods<br>
The following measurement methods are used to evaluate the parameters given in<br>
the examples and claims.<br>
Specific Surface Area (SSA) of a material<br>
The specific surface area is measured via the BET method according to ISO 9277 using nitrogen, following conditioning of the sample by heating at 250°C for a period of 30 minutes. Prior to such measurements, the sample is filtered within a Btichner funnel, rinsed with deionised water and dried overnight at 90 to 100°C in an oven. Subsequently the dry cake is ground thoroughly in a mortar and the resulting powder placed in a moisture balance at 130°C until a constant weight is reached.<br>
Particle size distribution (mass % particles with a diameter 
 <br>
Weight median grain diameter and grain diameter mass distribution of a particulate material, such as calcium carbonate, are determined via the sedimentation method, i.e. an analysis of sedimentation behaviour in a gravimetric field. The measurement is made with a Sedigraph™ 5120.<br>
The method and the instrument are known to the skilled person and are commonly used to determine grain size of fillers and pigments. The measurement is carried out in an aqueous solution of 0.1 wt.-% Na4P207, The samples were dispersed using a high speed stirrer and ultrasonic.<br>
Median grain diameter (also) of surface-reacted calcium carbonate material<br>
Median grain diameter of surface-reacted calcium carbonate material is determined using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 Laser Diffraction System.<br>

Crystallographic structures of materials were identified based on the XRD analytical technique using Brucker AXS:D8 Advance instrumentation, scanning 2 to 70° 2theta at a scanning speed of 0.5 seconds/step and a step size of 0.01° 2theta. Analysis of the resulting spectra was based on the PDF 2 database of reference spectra issued by the International Centre for Diffraction Data.<br>
pH of an aqueous slurry<br>
The pH of the aqueous suspension is measured using a standard pH-meter at approximately 25°C.<br>
Solids content of an aqueous slurry<br>
The slurry solids content (also known as "dry weight") is determined using a Moisture Analyser HR73 commercialised by Mettler-Toledo with the following<br><br>
