COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS FOR MAKING POLYURETHANE INTEGRAL SKIN FOAMS"<br>
HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL LLC, of 500 Huntsman Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
PROCESS FOR MAKING POLYURETHANE INTEGRAL SKIN FOAMS<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polyurethane molded articles having a dense periphery (skin) with a certain hardness and a cellular core (so-called integral skin foam) and to foams prepared thereby.<br>
A class of materials which has been widely used as blowing agent in the production of polyurethane integral skin foams are the fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, and in particular trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). Recent concern over the potential of chlorofluorocarbons to cause depletion of ozone in the atmosphere has led to an urgent need to develop reaction systems in which chlorofluorocarbon blowing agents are replaced by alternative materials which are environmentally acceptable and which also produce integral skin foams having the necessary properties for the many applications in which they are used.<br>
Such alternative blowing agents proposed in the prior art include hydrochlorofluorocarbons<br>
and hydrofluorocarbons.<br>
In particular 1,1-dichloro-l-fluoroethane (HCFC 141b) has been used as blowing agent for<br>
polyurethane integral skin foams leading to foams with a densified skin with a high surface<br>
hardness.  However HCFC 141b still contains chlorine atoms and hence is harmful to the<br>
environment<br>
1,1,1,2-terrafluoroethane (HFC 134a) has been used to replace HCFC 141b as blowing agent<br>
in polyurethane integral skin foam but results in an inferior product due to the lower skin<br>
hardness.<br>
5 DE 19836662 describes polyurethane integral skin foams made using hydrofluorocarbon blowing agents namely 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa) and/or 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134). Skin hardness of foam obtained using these blowing agents is inferior to that of foam blown using HCFC 141b as blowing agent.<br>
Object of the invention is the preparation of polyurethane integral skin foams having a high surface hardness using environmentally friendly blowing agents.<br>
The present invention provides a process for making polyurethane molded articles having a dense periphery and a cellular core comprising the step of reacting an organic polyisocyanate composition with a polyfunctional isocyanate-reactive composition in the presence of hydrofluorocarbon blowing agents, characterised in that a blowing agent mixture is used that contains or consists of 50 to 99 % by weight of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafiuorobutane (HFC 365mfc) and 1 to 50 % by weight of at least one fluorinated .<br>
2<br><br>
hydrocarbon selected from the group consisting of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC 245fa), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFC 227ea).<br>
Using these environmentally friendly blowing agent mixtures improves the quality of the skin of the integral skin foam in terms of increased density, hardness and abrasion resistance without adversely affecting other foam properties.<br>
These mixtures have been described in WO 98/27145 for use as blowing agents for the manufacture of foamed plastics, in particular rigid insulating polyurethane foams and highly resilient polyurethane foams.<br>
Preferred blowing agent mixtures for use in the present invention contain or consist of 80 to 99 % by weight of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane and 1 to 20 % by weight of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane and/or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, especially mixtures which contain or consist of 80 to 99 % by weight of HFC 365mfc and 1 to 20 % by weight of HFC134a and/or HFC 227ea.<br>
Especially preferred mixtures with HFC 134a contain or consist of 91 to 95 % by weight of HFC 365mfc and 5 to 9 % by weight of HFC 134a; mixtures which consist of the given compounds in the given amounts have a boiling point of 20°C.<br>
Especially preferred mixtures with HFC 227ea are those, which contain or consist of 80 to 99 % by weight of HFC 365mfc and 1 to 20 % by weight of HFC 227ea and especially of 85 to 89 % by weight of HFC 365mfc and 11 to 15 % by weight of HFC 227ea; mixtures, which consist of the given compounds in the last-mentioned amounts, have a boiling point of about 23°C.<br>
The blowing agent mixtures of the present invention are used in amounts of between 2 and<br>
15 % by weight based on the weight of the isocyanate-reactive composition.<br>
In semi-rigid integral skin foam the level of blowing agent mixture is preferably between<br>
10 and 15 % by weight based on the weight of the isocyanate-reactive composition.<br>
In rigid integral skin foam, particularly when used as imitation wood the level of blowing<br>
agent mixture is preferably between 2 and 10, most preferably between 4 and 8 % by<br>
weight based on the weight of the isocyanate-reactive composition.    In addition to<br>
improved scratch and abrasion resistance, the use of foam systems containing the blowing<br>
3<br><br>
agent mixture of the present invention also improves the surface quality by reducing the number of surface bubbles which can occur. The foamed part consequently requires less repairs to obtain the high quality visual appearance of the final coated imitation wood part.<br>
Suitable organic polyisocyanates for use in the process of the present invention include any<br>
of those known in the art for the preparation of polyurethane integral skin foams, and in<br>
particular the aromatic polyisocyanates such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate in the form of<br>
its 2,4"-, 2,2"- and 4,4"-isomers and mixtures thereof, the mixtures of diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanates (MDI) and oligomers thereof known in the art as "crude" or polymeric MDI<br>
(polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates) having an isocyanate functionality of greater<br>
than 2, toluene diisocyanate in the form of its 2,4- and 2,6-isomers and mixtures thereof,<br>
1.5-naphthalene diisocyanate and 1,4-diisocyanatobenzene. Other organic polyisocyanates<br>
which may be mentioned include the aliphatic diisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate,<br>
1,6-diisocyanatohexane	and	4,4"-diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane.<br>
Modified polyisocyanates, for example containing urethane-, urea-, biuret-, allophonate-, carbodiimide- or uretdion-groups can be used as well, or isocyanate-terminated prepolymers.<br>
Suitable isocyanate-reactive compounds to be used in the process of the present invention<br>
include any of those known in the art for the preparation of polyurethane integral skin foams.<br>
Of particular importance for the preparation of semi-rigid polyurethane integral skin foams<br>
are polyols and polyol mixtures having average hydroxyl numbers of from 20 to 200,<br>
especially from 20 to 50 mgKOH/g, and hydroxyl functionalities of from 2 to 3.    For<br>
polyether polyols the molecular weight is preferably between 2000 and 8000, for polyester<br>
polyols preferably between 2000 and 4000. Of particular importance for the preparation of<br>
rigid polyurethane integral skin foams are polyols, in particular polyether polyols, having<br>
average hydroxyl numbers between 300 and 1850, preferably between 350 and 650 mg<br>
KOH/g,  and  hydroxyl  functionalities  of from  2 to   6,  preferably  from  3   to  4.<br>
Mixtures of different polyols can be used; the mixing ratio depends on the application of the<br>
integral skin foam and the desired surface hardness of the skin.<br>
Suitable polyols have been fully described in the prior art and include reaction products of<br>
alkylene oxides, for example ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, with initiators<br>
containing from 2 to 8 active hydrogen atoms per molecule.   Suitable initiators include:<br>
polyols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, trimerhylolpropane,<br>
triemanolamine, penlaervtbritol, sorbitol and sucrose; polyarnines, for example ethylene<br>
diamine, tolylene diamine (TDA), diaminodiphenymaethane (DADPM) and polymethylene<br>
polyphenylene   polyarnines;    and   aminoalcohols,    for    example    ethanolamine    and<br>
-diethanolamine; and mixtures of such initiators.   Other suitable polymeric polyols include<br>
polyesters obtained by the condensation of appropriate proportions of glycols and higher<br>
4<br><br>
functionality polyols with dicarboxylic or polycarboxylic acids such as adipic acid, glutaric acid and phthalic acid. Still further suitable polymeric polyols include hydroxyl-terminated polythioethers, polyamides, polyesteramides, polycarbonates, polyacetals, polyolefins and polysiloxanes.<br>
The quantities of the polyisocyanate compositions and the polyfunctional isocyanate-reactive compositions to be reacted will depend upon the nature of the polyurethane integral skin foam to be produced and will be readily determined by those skilled in the art.<br>
Generally water or other carbon dioxide-evolving compounds are used together with the physical blowing agents mixture of the present invention. Where water is used as chemical co-blowing agent typical amounts are in the range from 0.2 to 5 %, preferably from 0.5 to 3 % by weight based on the isocyanate-reactive compounds.<br>
In addition to the polyisocyanate and polyfunctional isocyanate-reactive compositions and the blowing agents, the foam-forming reaction mixture will commonly contain one or more other auxiliaries or additives conventional to formulations for the production of polyurethane integral skin foams. Such optional additives include crosslinking agents, for examples low molecular weight polyols such as ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanedioL glycerol, trimethyolpropane and triemanolamine, urethane catalysts, for example tin compounds such as stannous octoate or dibutyltin dilaurate or tertiary amines such as l,4-diaza-(2,2,2)-bicyclooctane, bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether, dimethylcyclohexylamine or triethylene diamine, surfactants, fire retardants, for example halogenated alkyl phosphates such as tris chloropropyl phosphate, and fillers such as carbon black.<br>
In operating the process for making integral skin foams according to the invention, the known techniques may be used together with conventional mixing methods. Reference is made in this respect to EP 364854.<br>
Densities of the integral skin foams of the present invention are usually within the range 300 to 600, preferably 400 to 500 kg/m3.<br>
The obtained surface hardness in Shore D for rigid integral skin foams is for a density of about 500 kg/m3 in the range 65 to 70. For semi-rigid integral skin foams surface hardness Shore A of between 75 and 80 are obtained for a density of about 350 kg/m3.<br>
The integral skin foams of the present invention can be used in all applications where integral skin foams of the prior art have been used, such as upholstery, shoe soles, imitation wood and steering wheel covers.<br>
