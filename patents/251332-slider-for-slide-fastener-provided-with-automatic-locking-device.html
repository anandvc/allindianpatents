The front side attaching portion 15 as the attaching portion 10 for attaching the spring 5 with the locking pawl is built at the upper side of the guide post 33, the rear side attaching portion 16 as the attaching portion 10 for attaching the spring 5 with the locking pawl is built at the rear side of the upper wing plate 31 with a gap between itself and the front end attaching portion 15, and a recessed portion 39 is provided at this gap portion so as to mount the pintle 8 of the pull 4 on the gap portion. Lengths of the front side attaching portion 15 and the rear side attaching portion 16 are different in a longitudinal direction of the body 3. In other words, the rear side attaching portion 16 is shorter than the front side attaching portion 15 and the front side attaching portion 15 is longer than the rear side attaching portion 16. In addition, heights of the front side attaching portion 15 and the rear side attaching portion 16 are different in a vertical direction of the body 3 . In other words, the front side attaching portion 15 is higher than the rear side attaching portion 16 and the rear side attaching portion 16 is lower than the front side attaching portion 15.<br>
In the front side attaching portion 15, the housing groove 11 as a gap for housing the spring 5 with the locking pawl is recessed on an upper face in a central longitudinal direction, a bottom portion of this housing groove 11 is recessed in a curved shape, and on each of the side walls 17 on each side, a shelf portion 18 projecting in a stepped manner toward the inside of the housing groove 11 is provided. This shelf portion 18 is formed so as to be positioned outside of a side edge of the spring 5 with the locking pawl without mounting the spring 5 with the locking pawl housed in the housing groove 11 before the side walls 17 are elastically deformed so as to incline. In addition, on the rear side attaching portion 16, the housing groove 11 shaped in a gap-shape is recessed in the central longitudinal direction, a pawl hole 20, in which the pawl element 28 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl is inserted, communicating with the element guide groove 19 is provided at the front end of the housing groove 11, and the locking pawl 27 provided at a front end of the pawl element 28 is projected to the element guide groove 19. By forming a front wall of the pawl hole 20 to project and rise upward, the projection amount regulating portion 12 for regulating the projection amount of the locking pawl 27 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl to the element guide groove 19 by a predetermined amount is provided and a bent portion on an upper side of the pawl element 29 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl elastically contacts the projection amount regulating portion 12. In addition, as shown in FIG. 7, at the side wall 17 of the housing groove 11 at the rear side of the pawl hole 20, a projection 35 projecting toward the inside of the housing groove 11 is provided, and the insertion portion 24 capable of inserting the insertion element 30 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl is provided between this projection 35 and a rear wall 41 of the housing groove 11 so as to form the holding portion 23 capable of holding the insertion element 30 by the projection 35 and the rear wall 41. On the housing groove 11 of the rear side attaching portion 16, three directions are encircled by right and left side walls 17 on both sides and the rear wall 41 so as to prevent other elements from contacting the pawl element 28 to be inserted from an outside of the rear side attaching portion 16 into the pawl hole 20. The projection amount regulating portion 12 and the holding portion 23 are integrally formed with the rear side attaching portion 16.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the spring 5 with the locking pawl is formed by cutting the linear material A with a rectangular cross-section that is continued in a length direction for each predetermined length so as to form the locking pawl 27 and then, bending this linear material A. As shown in FIG. 3, the spring 5 with the locking pawl comprises a curved portion bent approximately in a inverted U-shape, the upper element 25 and the lower element 26 to be connected through the curved portion, wherein the insertion element 30 is formed by bending the front end of the upper element 25 downward, the pawl element 28 is formed by bending the lower element 26 downward, and the locking pawl 27 is formed at a front end thereof. The upper element 25, the lower element 26 and the curved portion have a same cross- sectional shape having a same width and thickness. This locking pawl 27 is formed by cuing the linear material A in such a manner that the cross-section is made gradually small toward its cutting end. On the other hand, a cut end portion of the linear material A on a side opposite to an cut end portion provided with the locking pawl 27 has a remaining shape formed after the locking pawl 27 is cut off, which serves as the insertion element 30 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl. Therefore, the linear material A is completely used in order to manufacture the spring 5 with the locking pawl and no portion is wasted. In the meantime, the linear material A may have a circle or an elliptic cross-section and a cross-section of the locking pawl 27 may be equal with other portions of the spring 5 with the locking pawl.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the pull 4 is formed from a grip body 37 of a rectangular shape that is provided with a connection portion 38 shaped in a C-shape at its front end, and a clamper of an arietiform circle shape, namely, a connection ring 7 is rotatably provide at the connection portion 38. In the meantime, the pull 4 may be formed in a short strip shape with a pintle 8 at its front end without the clamper.<br>
The slider 1 is assembled in such a manner that the pintle 8 of the connection ring 7 that is attached rotatably at the front end of the pull 4 is arranged inside of the recessed portion 39 provided between the front side attaching portion 15 and the rear side attaching portion 16 formed on the body 3, the spring 5 with the locking pawl is mounted so as to cover the pintle 8 from above to insert the pawl element 28 into the pawl hole 20, the front end of the locking pawl 27 is projected to the element guide groove 19, and the curved portion of the spring 5 with the locking pawl is housed in the housing groove 11 of the front side attaching portion 15. Since the long front side attaching portion 15 houses the curved portion 29 and a larger part of the lower element 26 extending to the curved portion 29 in its housing groove 11, it is possible to certainly prevent the curved portion 29 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl as the operational portion that is elastically deformed and the lower element 26 from contacting other elements at the outside. In this case, as shown in FIG. 5, the upper and lower elements<br>
25 and 26 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl are arranged so that their both side edges are located inside of the shelf portion 18 in the housing groove 11, and as shown in FIG. 7, the insertion element 30 at the front end of the upper element 25 is inserted in the insertion portion 24 that is provided on the housing groove 11 of the rear side attaching portion 16.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 8, the upper end portions of the side walls 17 on both sides in each housing groove 11 are pressurized toward the inside of the housing groove 11 and the upper end portions of the side walls 17 are elastically modified to be inclined so as to nip side edges of the upper element 25 from right and left.<br>
In front side attaching portion 15, the upper end portion of the side wall 17 is inclined to the inside of the housing groove 11 based on a bent reference position 40 shown in FIG. 5 and the shelf portion 18 moves to the inside of the housing groove 11 so as to be put between the upper element 25 and the lower element 26 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl beyond the side edge of the upper element 25. As a result, the shelf portion 18 is located under the upper element 25 so that the upper element 25 is mounted on the shelf portion 18 and a front and rear faces of the upper element 25 are nipped from above and below by the upper end portion of the side wall 17 and the shelf portion 18.<br>
On the other hand, the lower element 26 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl is formed to freely move without being nipped between the side wall 17 and the shelf portion 18.<br>
In the assembled slider 1, if the pull 4 is pulled, as shown in FIG. 9, the pawl element 28 is pulled up, and the bent portion abuts against the rear face of the upper element 25 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl fixed to the side wall 17 of the rear side attaching portion 16 as shown by a chained line, which prevents any further pulling operation. Accordingly, this portion prevents and regulates the upward movement of the locking pawl 27 of the spring 5 with the locking pawl so as to configure the movement regulating portion 13. Since a portion fixed to the rear side attaching portion 16 in the upper element 25 is made into the movement regulating portion 13, the lower element 26 is pulled up with a strong force. Even if the pawl element 28 or the lower element 26 strikes the upper element 25, the upper element 25 is not deformed since it is supported by the rear side attaching portion 16 and a stable movement regulating function can be exerted. In addition, since the rear side attaching portion 16 is formed so that a height in a vertical direction of the body 3 is lower than that of the front side attaching portion 15, the upper element 25 is inclined downward from the front side attaching portion 15 to the rear side attaching portion 16 and a position where the upper element 25 is fixed on the rear side attaching portion 16 is lower than a position where the upper element 25 is fixed on the front side<br>
attaching portion 15. With this configuration, a moving distance till the bent portion of the pawl element 28 abuts against the rear face of the upper element 25 can be made shorter and a limit position of an upward movement of the locking pawl 27 can be arranged within an allowable range of an elastic modification of the spring 5 with the locking pawl to exert a stable snapping force for a long period of time. If the pull 4 is released, the spring 5 with the locking pawl moves downward, and as shown in FIG. 9, the lower element 26 elastically contacts the projection amount regulating portion 12 projected on the body 3 and any more projection of the locking pawl 27 to the element guide groove 19 is regulated. In the meantime, a position of the projection amount regulating portion 12 is not limited to the present embodiment and it may be provided at a bottom of the housing groove 11 of the front side attaching portion 15.
