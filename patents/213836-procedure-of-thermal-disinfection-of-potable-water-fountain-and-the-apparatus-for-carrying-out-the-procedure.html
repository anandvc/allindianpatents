PROCEDURE OF THERMAL DISINFECTION OF POTABLE WATER FOUNTAIN AND THE APPARATUS FOR CARRYING OUT THE PROCEDURE.<br>
DIEAU SA of  ZI DE LADOUX,  RUE VERTE,  F-63118,  CEBAZAT, FRANCE, FRENCH Company<br>
1 DES 2005<br>
GRANMTED<br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Description	<br><br>
The invention concerns a water fountain 1 as example and of the type non-limiting composed of the detachable bottle placed on the mechanism of percussion (and receptacle) 3: this bottle feeds the network 4 in water which opens on a tap for distribution 6. An evaporator 5 allows the eventual refrigeration of water before the tap 6. The invention consists of surrounding a part (sufficient to obtain the required effect) of the laterafturface of the network 4 by a mechanism of heating 7, notably a heating plaque which espouses the lateral surface of the network 4. At regular intervals, the plaque 7 heats the water of the network 4 at a temperature and lasting for a sufficient time for the pathogenic bacteria to be destroyed.<br>
Application of this procedure of disinfection by periodic integral heating of the circulation   system and distribution of water to all types of fountain, the bottle, direct release or to glass   Total disinfection comprises a level of micro fissures, joints etc and destruction or prevention of   , the bio film.<br>
Technical sector of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns the technical sector of the apparatus of the type known as "water fountain" and most particularly their disinfection.<br>
One knows that the water fountains are the apparatus meant to distribute fresh and warm water voluntarily, from the bottle of water that one replaces when it is exhausted or when the date of expiry intervenes or from the network of potable water.<br><br><br>
These fountains essentially comprise a system of nourishment in water, a system of distribution /refrigeration of water and of heating and diverse control elements.<br>
Technical Problem caused<br>
The problem that occurred was one of bacterial proliferation, either inoffensive or pathogenic. Naturally, the most acute problem is related with the pathogenic bacteria proliferation, Pseudomonas, E.Coll, Staphylococcus, etc<br>
The contamination bacteria can intervene in numerous stages of the preparation of the fountain,<br><br>
for its charge in water and of its utilization.<br>
The fountain in general composes at least, for the fountains of the bottle, a system of percussion of the bottles or bottle, which can be contaminated accidentally at each manipulation.<br>
The cover of the bottle can itself be contaminated at the time of all manipulation, or also lasting the routing and the stocking, or at the same time the exposure of the bottle.<br>
Finally the water presented in the circuit of water distribution of the fountain etc... gives place to a bacteria development, called "bio film" normally in case of prolonged non utilization, but also in case of normal utilization<br>
Anterior Art:<br><br>
   One knows/(FR99 13838) of mechanisms that aim to heat all the days that form part of the     system of tubes adjacent to or near the system of percussion of the bottle, by the method notably of electric resistances, in order to provoke a thermal shock from 90 to 93Â° C lasting for a sufficient time (some minutes) capable of destroying the total flora and pathogen.<br>
With such a system one has already noted a notable diminution of the bacterial development.<br><br>
One also knows/some systems which have renounced the disinfection, judging it as very difficult in order to hold onto an alarm system which launches itself in the given time frame (calculated after some official recommendations) following the percussion of the bottle. Besides, these systems do not resolve the problem of disinfection but are simply supposed to avoid the supervision of a dangerous threshold of pathogenic proliferation, they are limited by the vigilance of the personnel.<br>
Such an alarm system is therefore useful only in complement to the other measures treating the base problem.       <br>
The fact that such systems exist and are commercialized, showing well that the solution of the technical problem laid out (that is to say the real disinfection of the water fountains) is far from being simple, since one is reduced, in most of the cases, to some palliatives such that the charge of the bottle to the term of a certain time aptly judged to guarantee a good hygiene.<br><br>
      One also knows/that some systems of "kits" of distribution of disposable water or of detachable vats which are replaced or disinfected around 4 times each year.<br><br><br><br>
The frequency of disinfection can be augmented for economic considerations (cost). The laboratory results show that, in a period of only 2 weeks, the total flora is important already. Moreover contaminations by some pathogenic bacteria can be supervised at any time at the time of the utilization of the fountain.<br>
One also will note that such system are already insufficient by themselves, in no way eliminate<br><br>
the danger of pathogenic proliferation: in effect, if the striker of the bottle is contaminated, for<br>
example because of bad cleaning, it will not serve the purpose of replacing the bottle in the given<br>
security time. In effect the pathogenic flora will subsist to the level of the striker and at the start<br>
of the tubes et will get along all the more than one believed to eradicate.<br>
One knows of some systems of disinfection which consist in machines churning some warm<br><br>
water and that one periodically connects to the fountains in order to disinfect the system lasting a<br><br><br>
Sufficient time, by a circulation of warm water at 90-95Â° C. These machines are very efficient but the efficiency<br>
of disinfection is naturally dependant on the frequency to which one decides to employ them.<br>
One knows that some detachable systems or "kits" capable of forming a system of reception of the bottle that<br>
one wipes or throws after each use. This system agrees to the evidence of the inconvenience already<br>
mentioned.<br>
This system is thus a system capable of treating only a limited zone and very localized which is the zone from<br>
where the water comes through.<br>
One has finally found a use for filters on the water fountains of type " networks" but these filters are not really<br>
efficient and posses the property of discoloration of water that is not hygienic in that sense.<br>
An apparatus for dispensing drinking water including of a chamber in which a container packed with drinking water is mounted, a conduit connected with the container in the chamber to dispense drinking water through the apparatus, and sterilizer installed adjacent the conduit means to apply sterilization with substantial heat thereto. The sterilizing means may include automatic control system to control automatically sterilizing with heat. The conduit may includes a storage area for storing drinking water within the conduit, and the storage area may includes two tanks for storing drinking water, one is a cold water tank including a refrigeration device to chill the drinking water, and the other is a hot water tank including heating device to heat the drinking water. The sterilization with heat may be done by heating the conduit with heaters installed surrounding thereof, or may be done by circulating hot water which is stored in the hot water tank through the apparatus. Furthermore, the sterilizer installed adjacent said conduit with the exception of the portions in which hot water is usually passed through in the apparatus during dispensing the drinking water to apply substantial sterilization with heat thereto.<br>
There thus exists an important need and recognition for an efficient system of disinfection of apparatus of the water fountain type which are independent of the quality and of the maintenance of the frequency and that which depends neither on the property of the material (tissu, chiffons, sponges etc..) used for the cleaning, neither at the time of presence of the bottle or the general manner of the water in the tubes, vats and analog volumes, neither the frequency of disinfection nor the property of the cover of the bottle is revealed and which is efficiency for all types of domestic fountains for the use in enterprises or in the collection to the bottle or the network and of all capacities.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention concerns of a mechanism and the procedure talks of" an integral thermal<br>
disinfection"       characterized such that one permanently     disinfects   the       water	contained      in   a<br>
"water fountain" (of all types as indicated below) while heating at a predetermined temperature and lasting for a predetermined time, all with a predetermined frequency, the ensemble (or the quasi totality, like one will see after this) some rubes, vats, taps, joints, connections and other elements   of  the circuit    or    network    of   feed,   of    distribution and of the circulation of water of the<br><br><br>
said fountain, situated between the system of percussion of the bottle (or the arrival of water from the network) and the tap of distribution.<br>
By "the ensemble of the tubes, vats, taps, joints and other elements" the professional will understand that one designates it either for the totality of the tubes and other elements, or for a part as important as possible for these tubes and other elements, if possible the quasi-totality, in all states of cause a fraction sufficiently important in order to assure the function of thermal disinfection of the water for the invention. One willfie able to for example treat a given fraction of this set-up and assure a time of treatment sufficient for that by thermal conduction, the non treated zones being carried out, however at the temperature of treatment. One will also be able to make changes to the temperature of the treatment and/or the frequency of the treatment .The professional will know how to adapt these parameters being heard other than the the curves of bacterial proliferation and the optimal condition of destruction of pathogenic bacteria are well known since a number of decades.<br>
One remembers* that a water fountain is essentially composed of a zone of arrival of water (in this case a fountain of bottle, this zone is composed principally of:-<br>
- of a receptacle of the bottle composing of a mfthod of "percussion" of the bottle that is to say, of vertical position of the bottle and of the perforation of its cover and at the start of the tube; in the case of a fountain - network, it comprises of methods of connection of the fountain to the network of alimentation in potable water and also at the start of the tube.)<br>
-	of a network or of tubes of circulation/distribution of water since the receptacle<br>
upto the taps of distribution of water for usage.<br>
-	of eventual methods of refrigeration of atleast a part of the tubes notably  in the<br>
case where the fountain is composed of 2 circuits, one to deliver water at a normal<br><br>
temperature or tempered and the other to deliver cold or warm water with the joints, connections and other pieces corresponding to the 2 circuits and at their command.<br>
-    of a mechanism of heating for the distribution of warm water<br>
eventually some control methods<br>
As seen certain fountains also compose of the methods of heating localized or the methods of connection with some machines of disinfecton to warm water.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention is thus concerned with a mechanism and procedure of thermal disinfection of potable water of a water fountain integrated to the said fountain and characterized such that one disinfects it permanently, by some actions effected at some intervals of pre-programmed times, the water contained in the system or circuit of feed/distribution of a "water fountain" '(Â°f all types as indicated above) while heating, at a predetermined temperature and lasting for a pre determined time, all with a predetermined frequency , the integrality of the said system or circuit and thus the water contained in the ensemble of tubes (and/or vats, networks and other elements of the system or circuit in contact with the water) of the said fountain situated between the system of percussion of the bottle (or the arrival of water from the network) and the distribution tap.<br>
The professional will understand that one will not unnecessarily duplicate the characteristics of "procedure" and of the "mechanism" and that the description (or claim) of the one that will be worth of a description (or claim) of the other. Thus, the description and the claim of a procedure comprises a stage X that will be worth also for the description and the claim of a<br><br><br>
mechanism comprising of the methods to put in place the said stage X, if these methods are well known or have been described or are claimecj in relation to this procedure.<br>
One has therefore essentially considered in the anterior art, to locally heat the zone for arrival of water or certain limited zones. One has also considered to periodically disinfect the ensemble of the system by a circulation of very warm water. One has never considered heating the ensemble of tubes of a fountain.<br>
Or the considered industry has accommodated itself from results, even partials obtained or the industry has considered that a lot of technical obstacles opposes to the success of heating of the ensemble of the tubes with a lot of risks of failure.<br>
There exist in effect a number of technical obstacles, which form that many problems to be resolved.<br>
  On one hand, the tubes, or the receptacle, eventually those or the vats incorporated or the "kits"described above, even those or the taps of distribution composing of joints, raccords, asperities, ends, interstices and analogs which form as many potential nests where the bacteria can hang itself from, then proliferate and from where it is difficult to dislodge them or destroy them.<br>
On the other hand, the water, which circulates in the tubes, gives away irreparably, like in the best-known systems, formation of a "biofilm" which forms itself on the inner wall and is constituted of colonies of non-pathogenic bacteria. This biofilm presents itself under the aspect of a transparent tablet and sticky, which \one hand is not pleasant and which on the other hand forms an ideal center of culture for the pathogenic bacteria. Such a biofilm thus represents a permanent potential danger, which favors the proliferation of the pathogenic bacteria of those, which are presented lasting for a sufficiently long time.<br>
Neither of the anterior systems are capable and moreover is not attached to destroy this biofilm or restrict its formation. However, its elimination represents a hygiene capital factor.<br><br><br>
The invention resolves all the problems which have just been described, including the prevention or destruction of the biofilm (or restriction of its formation), disinfection of all interstices, connections, elbows etc....and also the fissures anct micro-fissures which appear in the metal, like on a tube saying "read" of such micro-fissures constituting as many nests of bacteria impossible to disinfect efficiently with the known systems and as many more pernicious that they are invisible for the proposed agent for periodic cleaning.<br>
The invention aims in particular at a mechanism and a procedure of thermal disinfection of water of a water fountain integrated to the said fountain, characterized as such in which one permanently, disinfects by the thermal route, that is to say by punctual thermal actions but at preprogrammed intervals, regular preference, the water contained in one "water fountain" (of all types, as indicated above) while heating at a predetermined temperature and lasting for a predetermined time, all with a predetermined frequency, and all (that is to say the ensemble of these parameters) being adapted in order to obtain the effect of the desired thermal disinfection the metal and/or alloy constitutive of the ensemble of the tubes of the said fountain, situated between the system of percussion of the bottle (or the arrival of water from the network)and the tap of distribution and/or directly the water contained in the ensemble of the tubes.<br>
According to a mode of non limiting, preferred realization effects heating of the tubes by the insertion in the tubes of feed (and of distribution) in water of the said circuit on the entire length of these or sensitively along their length of a tube saying "a passage for current" that is to say a metal tube heated by the Joules effect by the passing of an apt electric current to carry the temperature of the water upto the desired value in the conditions of the desired function and adapted to obtain the desired thermal disinfection.<br>
According to a mode of preferred realization, these are the tubes themselves which are constituted by a like 'tube for passage of electric current'. This solution presents the decisive advantages because they radically eliminate all risjcs.<br><br>
A non-limiting example for a feed of such a tube for passage of current which is of known type, is in the order of 1000 A under a weak voltage of around 3 V.<br>
On would also be able to employ a tube for passage of current for the tubes and another method of heating for example a sheath comprising of an electric resistance for the other elements such as vats, taps, valves and analogs. <br>
According to yet another method of non-limiting, preferred results effects the heating of the metal or alloy of the tubes while joining the tube on the ensemble of its length, an apt heat resistance to indirectly carry the temperature of water to the desired value in the conditions of the desired functioning and adapted to obtain the desired thermal infection.<br>
By "to the desired value in the conditions of the desired function" and "and adapted in order to obtain the desired thermal disinfection" the professional will understand that the desired value or adapted is of the order of 90-95 Â°C and that the desired conditions or adapted are those which correspond to a time and frequency of a treatment at the same time sufficient in order to break the proliferation bacteria, destroy the pathogenic bacteria and preferably restrict the formation of a biofilm, all while remaining economically satisfying.<br>
The invention thus proposes auto disinfection by periodic heating of the ensemble of the tubes (and/or vats etc..) to a temperature of disinfection. This heating is rendered possible by the weak thermal inertia of the used material for the conception of the ensemble of the tubes and vats etc...to condition naturally that these elements being constituted of a thermal conductor material like stainless steel of food grade quality and metal or well known alloys and analogs.<br>
The invention allows for the first time to produce some water, which is of sanitary quality, is in permanence identical to the quality of water contained in an open bottle. To eventually suppose that the water in the bottle is accidentally infected before the opening the system according to the invention would be capable of destroying the pathogenic flora.<br><br><br>
In addition, by thermal condition the system of percussion or the arrival of water, like one or all the taps are equally disinfected by the procedure according to the invention.<br>
The treatment according to the invention will be for example effected by a high at 90 - 95Â°C lasting between 10 to 20 minutes of preference around some 10 minutes every 24 hours, of preference each night.<br>
Essentially, the invention thus covers the following aspects:<br>
Procedure for thermal disinfection of potable water for a water fountain, comprising a system or circuit for distribution of water comprising appoint of alimentation in water, a system or circuit of distribution comprising some tubes, vats, taps and circuit analogs and tap for distribution characterized in that.<br>
One permanently disinfects the water contained in the said system or circuit of distribution of the said fountain while heating at a predetermined temperature and lasting for a predetermined time, all this with a predetermined frequency adapted to operate the said disinfection.<br>
The integrality of the said system or circuit and therefore the water contained in the ensemble of the said system or circuit is in contact with the water.<br>
Situated between the point of alimentation in water (system of percussion of the bottle or arrival of water from the network) and the tap for distribution.<br>
Mechanism of thermal disinfection of potable water of a water fountain integrated to the said fountain comprising the system or circuit of distribution of water comprising a point of alimentation in water, a system or circuit of distribution comprising some tubes, vats taps or circuit analogs and a tap for distribution characterized in this.<br><br><br>
It comprises the methods of heating at a predetermined temperature lasting for a predetermined time all this with a predetermihed frequency adapted to operate the said disinfection.<br>
-	of the integrality of the said system or circuit and therefore the water contained in the ensemble of the said system or circuit in contact with water.<br>
-	situated between the point of alimentation in water (the system of percussion of the bottle or arrival of water from the network) and the distribution tap.<br>
The water fountains are characterized such that they put in place a procedure according to the invention or comprising a mechanism according to the invention.<br>
the couples(or combinations) of the water tubes 13 and from mechanism heating 14 of thermal disinfection applicable to the mechanisms according to the invention.<br>
The other characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood on reading the description which is going to follow and by referring itself to the diagrams annexed on which<br>
-    Figure 1 represents a mode of putting in place the invention of the said "bottle"<br>
Figure 2 represents a method to put in place the invention on a fountain fed by the<br>
network titled "direct release"<br>
Figure 3 represents a mode of possible result of a combination of a tube of water and a<br>
tube of joint heating.	
Figure 4 represents a method to put in place the invention on the fountain of the said<br>
"with bank of glass"<br>
On the figures annexed the same references have the same significations<br><br><br>
The invention will be better understood by reading the description, which is going to follow, and some non-limiting examples<br>
Figure 1 represents water fountain 1 of type A network comprising of a detachable bottle 2, placed on the mechanism of percussion (and receptacle) 3; this bottle fed in water the network 4 which opens on a tap for distribution 6. An evaporator 5 allows the eventual refrigeration of water before the tap 6. The invention consists of surrounding a part (sufficient to obtain the desired effect) of the latefal surface of the network 4 by a mechanism of heating 7, notably a heated plaque which espouses the lateral surface of the network 4 .At regular intervals plaque 7 heats the water of the network4 at a temperature and lasting a sufficient time such that the pathogenic bacteria are destroyed.<br>
One can in addition predict that the mechanism for heating 7 is prolonged upto a level for the mechanism of percussion 3 before disinfecting it at the same time as the water contained in network 4.<br>
/ One can also predicfthat the mechanism of percussion 3 comprises of the delays or thermal v.- liaisons in heat conductor material which plunges in water of the network 4: thus at the time of the disinfection of the water of network 4, the mechanism of the percussion will be equally disinfected by the effect of the thermal conductor as in the mass of water. One can simply predict a time for heating of water in the network 4 sufficient such that the thermal conduction can establish itself and that the disinfection of the mechanism of the percussion is efficient.<br>
One knows thai, the case failing, the network 4 can be replaced by a tube in the form of âserpentine to which will be joined, a heating element of disinfection and eventually a refrigeration element that can replace the failed case of the network 4. Such a system is represented in figure 2.<br><br><br>
Figure 2 represents a water fountain fed in by the feeding network with potable water and said to be direct release. The potable water arrives in E and is circulated in the tubes 13, generally rolled in serpentine. A freezing fluid F arrives in 10 and circulates in a tube joined to tube 13 before producing fresh water. Mechanism 14 for heating for disinfection according to the invention is joined to tube of water 13. As one sees it, all have preferred this mechanism 14 is joined to the tube of water on its entire length and upto tap 6. However, according to this variant the mechanism of heating 14 for disinfection can disinfect the 2 extremities only by thermal convection.<br>
Figure 3 represents a method of non-limiting realization for a couple of tubes of water 13 and of the heating mechanism 14 of disinfection according to the invention. One sees the tube of water 13 and of the heating mechanism 14 of disinfection are reunited thermally in a sheath conductor of the heat 15. The sheath 15 presents such a form mat can accommodate the freezing tube 12 on the nearing wall of the tube of water 13.<br>
Figure 4 represents putting in place of the invention in a fountain of water of the type 'with bank of glass". In this type of fountain the refrigeration of water is assured by a secondary circuit 40 of freezing fed in by an evaporator 20 which forms a block of glass around these exchange tubes. The refrigerating fluid is sent by a pump P towards a furnace 50 where one finds a tube of potable water 13 joined to a mechanism of disinfection 14 according to the invention for example in the mechanism, a sheath as represented in figure 3. The potable water arrived in E, is either that of the network or of the bottle and is delivered by tap 6.<br>
As the professional will understand it easily The materials will be adapted at such a time so as to assure a good thermal conductivity and resistance to the temperature of disinfection.<br>
A luminous light and eventually an alarm like a vibrator or buzzer can be a title of precaution, that needs to activate itself when the mechanism of disinfection function before avoiding all risks of burning either by water or by a piece of the fountain. Such a system of alarm can for example be set off by putting a programmed route of mechanism of disinfection according to the invention and can disconnect itself when the temperature has returned to an inoffensive temperature. It can also be set off and stopped by a thermostat.<br><br>
The system of invention is a preference programmed by a memoir and a clock and some adapted electrical and mechanical methods. As mentioned atfeve the mechanism is programmed to enter in function at the moment of non-usage notably at night.<br>
All these systems are known since decades in numerous industries, notable in household electronics and will not be described here.<br>
The invention also covers all the methods of realization and all the applications, which will be directly accessible to the professional to read in the present report, of his proper knowledge and<br>
eventually of simple routine tests.<br><br><br>
