PROVISIONALThe following specification describes the invention.               /	COMPLETE The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
4. DESCRIPTION : Starts from page 2.<br>

7. ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION : On page No.9<br><br>
Present invention relates to a process using nutrient food, a combination of plurality of agriculturally useful active microbes in an equipment called biorefinery specially designed for aerobic refining of any organic manure such as composts or vermicompost, so as to produce a freshly brewed refined organic manure solution for applying agriculturally useful active microbes and extracted nutrients to soil and on the surfaces of crops.<br>
It is a well-known fact that, excessive and obsessive use of chemicals has disturbed the biological cycle, thereby destroying the soul of soil. Adding organic matter only, is not sufficient to rejuvenate the soil. This organic matter has to be acted upon by microbes to unlock the nutrients and make them available to the plants. Application of composts to increase the organic matter of soil is a well-known method, which also improves the fertility of soils. The nutrients in composts are in a locked up form and it takes a long period for the nutrients to be released and therefore there is delay in realizing visible results of the same. The nutrients from the compost are released by the process of composting which is carried out presently by heaping the raw organic matter, adjusting moisture, carbon nitrogen ratio and adding microbial inoculants primarily having cellulolytic or amylolytic or lignocellulolyic ability. This process is time consuming and results in wastage of valuable nutrients. The conditions of composting are not controlled and therefore the quality of the end product is not consistent. Upon addition of compost to the soil the nutrients are not released instantaneously and often the benefits are observed after a crop period. Also the compost has to be added in large amounts @ 1 to 5 tones per ha.<br>
Object of the present invention, therefore aims at developing an improved process to brew extracted and added microbes, which refine any organic manure such as compost or vermicompost in the specialized refining equipment, which is referred to as biorefinery<br>
herself<br>
2<br><br>
The reference is also made to US patent document No.2002164781 and Japanese Patent document No. JP2004189554.<br>
1.	The US Patent has stated compost tea system to produce "Compost Tea". "Compost Tea" has been produced for many decades by various methods and involves only extraction of good principles from compost in aerated or non-aerated systems. Our invention relating to production of "Refine Organic Manure" differs from compost tea by virtue of the process and equipment used to produce the same. "Refine Organic Manure" is a result of extraction coupled with brewing to increase the potency of the required principles by microbial action and the counts of microbes. Thus, the end products "compost tea" and "Refined Organic Manure" differ.<br>
2.	According to US Patent, Compost tea is an actively aerobic extract of compost. This extract will differ with respect to the compost used. Where as the "Refined Organic Manure" produced as per our invention is an extraction and simultaneous brewing or fermentation process involving use of specified food medium and consortium of specific microbial culture which has a said composition after brewing resulting in production of "Refined Organic Manure".<br>
3.	In the US Patent there is no control over the nature of aerobic microbes which are extracted from the compost in the compost tea. As per our invention, there is a greater control over the microbial growth as the food of microbes and the microbes themselves of the said composition are added prior to the process.<br>
4.	As per the Japanese patent No. JP2004189554 the "organic liquid fertilizer" which is produced is the outcome of the very basic system which has been carried out for years by farmers all over the world. This system too produces a product similar to "Compost Tea" wherein any organic fertilizer is actively aerated in a vessel. There is no brewing or fermenting component involved, whereas the present invention involves a specified process to produce liquid "Refined Organic<br>
3<br><br>
Manure" encompassing extraction and brewing processes utilizing specified media and microbes.<br>
Therefore, the present   invention is a technically advanced, new and is totally dissimilar as compared to the cited US and Japanese patent documents.<br>
Object of the present invention, therefore aims at developing an improved process to brew extracted and added microbes, which refine any organic manure such as compost or vermicompost in the specialized refining equipment, which is referred to as biorefinery herein.<br>
According to another object of this invention, aims at reducing the time required for extracting valuable nutrients and micro-flora from compost or vermicompost. We propose the use of such extracted nutrients will accelerate the positive responses on growth of plants on application, within 2 to 10 days.<br>
Dynamic brew solution with plurality of high concentration of microbes produced by the said method trigger-off biological chain reactions and makes the soils dynamic and full of life by restoring natural organic cycle so as to turn the soils into a live medium for plant growth. The dose of the said solution will be 10 to 20 liters per acre for soil and foliar application.<br>
According to another object of the invention, the nutrient food required for brewing desired microbes shall increase the growth of microbes and their activity or metabolism in the refined organic manure solution.<br>
According to still another object, wherein the brewing of agriculturally useful microbes in any organic manure such as compost or vermicompost is supplemented with plurality of other agriculturally useful aerobic microbes viz: nitrogen fixing, phosphate solubilizing, mycoparasitic, antagonistic nematophagus, chitinolytic, amylolytic, entomopathogenic and plant growth promoting microbes.<br>
4<br><br>
According to still another object of this invention, the locked substances in any organic manure such as compost or vermicompost are acted upon by a combination of aerobic dynamic microbes mentioned above and are released in the final product i.e. refined organic manure solution and are easily made available for immediate assimilation for the plants, thereby enhancing physiological activities of the plants to show visible effects within a shorter period of time of 2 to 10 days.<br>
According to still another object of this invention, agriculturally useful microbial cultures shall be freshly produced at the site of application i.e. on the farm and will remove the drawbacks of losses of activity of such microbes dispensed in vogue, as biofertilizer and biopesticide due to storage and logistic problems. Such prepared solution shall be much more affordable to the farming community to reduce their burden of expenses for cultivation of crops.<br>
The process as per the invention is carried out in a biorefinery or a special purpose vessel which is a subject matter of divisional application.<br>
According to this invention, therefore, a process to refine an organic manure such as compost, vermicompost comprises adding combination of plurality of agriculturally useful active microbes, nutrient food required for growth of such agriculturally useful microbes and an organic manure such as compost or vermicompost in 20 to 60 micron porous sieve nylon or plastic bags in a bio-refinery, a vessel specially designed for this process, filled with water, mixing with a pump for 5 to 30 minutes, aerating for 20 to 48 hours, to produce a freshly brewed refined organic solution containing soluble extract of added organic manure such as. compost or vermicompost ready for use on farms for improving the bio-diversity of the soil, preventing plant diseases and boosting plant growth.<br>
The refined organic manure solution prepared by the process of the invention contains soluble nutrients such as enzymes, proteins, vitamins, minerals, agriculturally<br>
5<br><br>
useful microbes such as fungi, yeast, actinomycetes, protozoa, nematodes, algae bacteria, and the like.<br>
