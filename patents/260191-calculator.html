				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a calculator and, more particularly, to concerned with, a calculator which combines a series of standard matheroatical functions with at least one other function.<br>
The circuitry involved in performing calculations by means of the calculator of this invention is conventional end will not be described herein since it is well known in the art end suitable circuits/components ere readily available commercially.<br>
According to one aspec.t of the present invention, there is provided a calculator which comprises: (a) a housing; (b) a rendom number generator housed within said housing; (c) function keys opernbly connected to logic circuitry housed within the housing, whereby mathematical operations can be performed; (d) a display panel  arranged to display the results of said mathematical operations; and (e) at least one other key operably connected to a memory device housed within said housing and arranged to generate an output from a selection of outputs held in said memory device, said output being directed to said display panel, wherein said function keys comprise a "lucky number" function<br>
key or keys which is or are operably connected to said random number generator, for initiating random number generation cycle; said random number cycle being iterative until terminated by the user; said "lucky number" is a random number.<br>
The, calculator includes a plurality of function selection keys which select the mode of operation required by the user.  These will include a "maths" key which is ueed to select the normal mathematical functions, e.g. addition, multiplication, square root, n  root etc. Another function selection may be used to give a time display.<br>
One of the function, keys is used to select a "lucky number" feature; when selected, further keys on the calculator may operate to select the number of digits required in the "lucky number" or its range; and<br><br>
versions, selected according to the birth star-sign of the owner.  This enables the memory unit(s) associated with the horoscope function to be specifically oriented to the birth sign of the user.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, and to ehow how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, which shows one embodiment thereof.<br>
Referring to the drawing, the calculator comprises a housing 1 which incorporates logic circuitry (not shown) and at least one memory device (not shown).  The calculator has a display panel 2, e.g. an LCD display. In the illustrated embodiment, the display is In the form of a single line display comprising up to thirty-two characters.  A plurality of function keys and function selection keys are provided on the face of the housing 1, and these are operably connected to the logic circuitry and the memory device (s) to provide the user with the results of the selected functions which are then displayed at panel 2. The function keys include an ON/OFF key 3} a CLEAR key 4; mathematical function keys 5a - 5K; and a numerical keypad (0-9) and decimal point). The maths keys are used to perform the following functions:<br>
5a. - subtract memory (sub-total);<br>
5b - add memory (sub-total);<br>
5c - recall memory (sub-total);<br>
5d - divide;<br>
5e_ - logarithm or root function (x1/n);<br>
5f - multiply;<br>
53 - raise to power;<br>
5h - percentage;<br>
51 - equals;<br>
51 - add;<br>
5k -   subtract.<br><br>
These maths function keys are located on the right hand side of the keyboard, ae shown.<br>
A group 7-11 of function selection keys are provided just to the left of centre of the housing. These include a time display key 7; general maths operation key 8; a horoscope function key 9; a personal or emotional horoscope selection key 10; and a business or professional horoscope selection key 11.<br>
The operation of function keys 7 and 8 is self-explanatory.<br>
Scroll keys 12e end 12b form part of a central group of keys 12.  Scroll keys 12a and 12b are used in conjunction with the horoscope function key 9 and with zodiacal star sign indicator 14. Key 9 is used to display the general horoscopes for the sign mentioned at 14. This function can call up to 948 read-only horoscope files to be displayed on the screen (two and half years of daily, monthly and yearly horoscopes). These files vary in size between 300 end 600 characters and are written by highly reputed astrologers.  Scroll keys 12a and 12b are used to permit the whole of a file to be viewed. When key 9, the general horoscope function key, is pressed, the machine prompts the user to specify the date for the horoscope (any date in 2Â½ year period covered by the machine). When the date is entered, the horoscope file is displayed on the screen. The left-right scroll buttons 12a and 12b are then used to view the file in its entirety,<br>
A second horoscope key 10, when pressed, will put the device in "emotional compatibility" mode. Selecting one of the Sun Signs (from key group 13) and a date will display an index which measures, on that particular day, the emotional compatibility of the selected sign with the machine sign (14).<br>
The third horoscope key is key 11.  Pressing this key will put the machine in "professional<br><br>
compatibility" mode.  This works in the same way as the emotional compatibility key, using the group of signs 13 and a selected date.<br>
The two types of compatibility indices and the accompanying comments are also the work of professional astrologers and are located in 25,920 files in the memory of the machine.<br>
A further group of function keys 15, 16 and 17 control a "lucky number" function Which operates in conjunction with a random number generator (not shown) which forms part of the logic/memory circuitry within housing 1. Button 15 prompts the user to specify the number of digits required in the lucky number.  The second button 16 prompts the user to specify the range for the lucky number. When the proper information is entered in either case, the machine prompts the user to press the "Feeler" button 17 (the half-circle below the lung-shaped keys in the Figure) but not to release it until he or she feels the lucky number is about to appear.  Pressing the Feeler button 17 triggers a random number selection process which is continuously reiterated until the user releases ths Feeler button. The last random number is then displayed.<br>
When one of the horoscope keys 9, 10 or 11 is selected, the calculator uses a memory which incorporates a large number of astrological predictions/recommendations; these are preferably obtained from a respected astrologer.  The user selects one of a further group of keys 13, which represent the signs of the zodiac (Aries, Taurus ... Aquarius, Pisces), in conjunction with either key 10 or key 11. The key from group 13 is selected in accordance with the birth sign of the person with whom the user is dealing or intending to deal (whether in personal or business matters).<br>
The illustrated calculator is available in twelve<br><br>
versions according to the zodiacal star sign of the user; this is indicated by the star sign indicator 14. The memory units associated with function keys 9, 10 and 11 are specifically designed to be appropriate to . the user's star sign 14.<br>
An alternative embodiment (not shown), with a larger memory, is adopted for use by anyone, i.e. it ia not dedicated to a particular birth sign.  In this embodiment, a birth sign selector function key is provided in place of the fixed sign indicator 14.<br><br><br><br>
