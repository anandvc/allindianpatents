The present invention relates to a double pilfer-proof threading system for glass containers used in Bottling units to prevent the liquid being diluted, adulterated, contaminated or misuse of the contents of the bottle. Tampering of the cap, leaves behind as an evidence a hold ring of the extended circular web cap which cannot be lifted off the neck.<br>
In most of the industries where the contents are required to be preserved in tact for consumption, particularly in the Distilleries, Soft-drinks, Pharmaceuticals, food and vinegars for household, a number of devices have been used to secure the contents by means of closures. A number of devices for closure of bottles have been made, as an on-going business exercise, to improve and secure the containers. In the early days of the business, the use of corks, plastics, crown corks, metals and also pilfer proof caps came into vogue as and when the growth and technology of bottle closure industry improved. The progress of the bottle closure or capping industry which commenced with manual operations by hand for making the devices is now coping with advanced automatic machines.<br>
When metallic bottle closure became popular, tampering of bottle, hit the reputed brands of containers. Due to the increasingly high occurrences of tampering of bottles in the Distilleries and other places, many attempts have been made in recent years towards producing tamper-proof bottle closures or caps which could signal or alert potential consumers, that tampering or unauthorized access of the container has transpired. A number of ways or methods have been adopted by the industry such as tear-away strip, caps and other devices, including cap and bottle neck configuration to provide easy on and off use of the cap by the bottler and ultimately by the end user of the bottled product.<br>
Pilferproof devices of the caps for bottles has been the subject of a continuous research for many years and many patents have been granted for various pilfer proof bottle. The quest for search for a new system of device to achieve the set objectives mentioned herein is distinct from the prior art.<br><br>
Amongst the Patents granted, mention might be made of U.S.Patent No.5,711,443 and U.S.Patent No.6,332,55061. In these devices there are many set backs in manufacturing or disadvantages and suffer from some drawbacks or other. For instance the cited Patents granted are mainly a Tamper Evident Container closure whereas the present invention is a double pilfer proof threading system comprising of the threads on the upper and lower parts of the neck of the bottle with top circumferential beads at the places in combination with the extended cap body member with circular web extended downwards crimp fitted on to the bottom circumferential bead in such a way that the hold ring cannot be taken off from the neck of the bottle.<br>
The U.S.Patent No.6,332,55061 is a closure cap consisting of an outer tamper evident cap engagable over an inner container sealing cap; cap retaining prongs on the outer cap for placement on the container neck, a tear strip for severing the outer cap between its upper and lower ends, the former holds on to the bottle and the later enables to open the bottle by severence. All these innovations are concerned and rotates round the cap structure alone. It is noteworthy that the outer cap is used as a cup for drinking or for drinking medicine. The U.S.Patent No.5,711,443 is also a closure cap with a cap retaining prongs on the outer cap and also a tear strip for severing the outer cap. In the cited Patents greater emphasis is made of the tear strip removal and of cap retaining prongs.<br>
The present invention has overcome many of the disadvantages of the existing cap and neck devices and has come out with a double pilfer proof threading system wherein the tampering is made evident and re-filling of the bottle or misuse of the contents is prevented as the broad band or hold-ring which forms part of the extended circular web of the cap member prevents being lifted off the neck of the bottle when the cap is unscrewed.<br>
In the present invention, the combination of the extended web downwards with the features on the top neck portion of the bottle with circumferential band with the tear of web and the circumferential ends made engagable by crimp fitting inwards, that holds the hold ring or broad band onto the bottle bending inwards. At the same time the grip of the hold ring is so firm due to crimp fitting which gives a firm hold on to the bottle neck.<br><br>
The container sealing cap may, at a glance, gives an impression of similarity but a closer look at the U.S.Patents and the present invention have many dissimilarities. Basically the U.S.Patents are for a container closure with tamper evident hold. After the tear off the cap could be lifted off easily as there are no threads on the bottleneck. Cap retaining prongs on the outer cap which permits placement. Sealing cap is cylindrically curved to an external radius. The cap is externally sized to have either a relatively snug fit or a somewhat loose or sliding fit within the upper portion of the Cap. The ribs are in pairs with longitudinal spike like ribs. Further the closure cap have an outer cap and inner cap including a circumferential side walls having upper and lower ends and the cap has an inner circumferential shoulder.<br>
From the above description it is obvious that the tamper-evident cap in both the cited Patents are mainly manufactured in a mould and fitted on to the glass bottle having all the features described including an outer and inner cap. The tearing up seal and hold ring are also embodied therein.<br>
In spite of the commonality of the hold ring, tear up strip or the tearing webs, the present invention is entirely different in formation of the various parts and functions. This is due to the combination of the feature of the threading system on the bottle neck as described hereunder and the firm grip and support to the inner surface of the circular web extended downwards and to help edges of the circular web of the cap to turn inwards and prevents lifting of the hold ring due to crimp fitting of the edges.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in the formation of the threads on the upper and the lower parts of the neck of the bottle with the top circumferential bead in between and with the bottom thread at the lower portion in combination with the circumferential bead which forms the hold ring and the extended cap body member with circular web extended downward which is crimp fitted on to the neck portion of the glass bottle when the interior of the said circular extended body of the web holds on to the exterior shape of the features on the top of the neck with a firm grip and when the cap is opened or tampered the holding cap prevents being lifted off the neck of the bottle and is left behind as proof of tampering.<br><br>
Accordingly the main objectives of the present invention are as under:<br>
a)	To provide a double pilfer-proof threading system to prevent misuse of the contents or adulteration of the contents, such that, the closure of the container is made impracticable by means of the broad based band or hold-ring being made a permanent fixture and not removable<br>
b)	Another object of the invention is to provide consumers with a genuine product.<br>
c)	Other objects are in part obvious and will in part, appear hereafter.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention of a double pilfer-proof threading system for glass bottles consisting of the essential features positioned in a sequence on the exterior of the top neck portion of the said bottles in combination of a cap body member with circular web extended downwards comprises of:<br>
a)	a top threading portion on the exterior of the glass bottle on the neck portion.<br>
b)	a top circumferential broad band, a means for the resting of the rupturable circumferential webs of the extended web of the cap or tear off portion.<br>
c)	a middle ring a means for a tight grip for the interior surface of the body of the circular extended cap when crimp fitted on the neck of the bottle.<br>
d)	a bottom threading portion, a means for the interior surface of the cap web to hold a firm grip on the bottom thread and prevent being taken off the hold ring of the bottle.<br>
e)	a bottom circumferential bead, a means for the interior surface of the cap web to hold firm grip and support and to help the edges of the circular ribs of the cap to turn inwards when crimpped and prevent lifting of the holding after removal of cap upper portion.<br><br>
. f) a tear off portion or a rupturable circumferential web portion situated above the said middle ring on the surface of the top circumferential bead, a means for tear off and facilitate removal of the cap from the bottle<br>
g) when the said circular cap body member is crimp fitted on to the neck of the bottle, the exterior of the body closely and firmly grips on to the neck and take the shape of the features of the neck portion and<br>
h) the edge of the circular cap body member extended downwards turns inwards and in the process firmly holds the bottom circumferential bead which acts as a means for preventing the hold-ring being lifted off from the neck of the bottle.<br>
i) The formation of the threads on the upper and the lower parts of the neck bottle with the top circumferential bead in between with the circumferential bead which forms the hold ring and the extended cap body member with the circular web extended downwards crimp fitted on to the neck of the glass bottle, hold the bottom circumferential bead which prevents the hold ring being taken off from the neck of the bottle.<br>
The invention is further described with the help of the accompanying drawings wherein<br>
Fig.1	Shows a front view of the double pilfer proof neck portion of the container<br>
embodying the essential features of the invention;<br>
Fig.2	Shows an elevation of the cap body member with circular web extended<br>
downwards with a rupturable circumferential connectors or tear off portion;<br>
Fig.3	Shows front view of the neck portion of the bottle with the cap body<br>
member with circular web extended downwards as crimp fitted.<br>
Fig.4	Shows front view of the bottle after the removal of the cap of the bottle,<br>
indicating the pilfer-proof hold-ring of a brood-band, not being lifted off the neck of the bottle.<br><br>
Referring to Fig.1, the essential features of the invention, particularly on the neck portion of the bottle is shown having a total neck length of 41.4mm of 750 ml bottles consists of 5 parts where in top thread portion (1) having 3 number screw threads of 8 TPI with l.lr has a total length of 11.30mm which means for screwing the web of the cap body member, The top circumferential bead (2) of 10.05mm length has rounded of corners which is a means of support to the rupturable portion of the cap body member web or the connectors at a time of opening the cap and the middle ring (3) is of 3mm in length followed by bottom thread portion of 8.80mm length has 2 threads of 8 TPI with l.lr (4) for screwing the bottom of the cap body member extended and bottom circumferential bead (4) which is 5.5mm in length. The bottom three feature of the neck portion of the bottle (3) (4) and (5) forms a hold ring to prevent the bottom portion of the extended web (inner surface) taken off the neck after the cap is opened. The top thread portion (1) has length of 11.30 mm has three threads whereas the bottom thread portion (4) having a length of 8.80 has two threads. In between the two features of threads the top circumferential bead (2) is of 10.50 mm length. The novel feature of the present invention is the bottom thread portion (4) of 8.80 mm in length supported by the middle ring (3) and bottom circumferential bead (5) which forms the hold-ring to prevent being lifted of the neck in the event of pilferage or tampering. The present invention is unique and novel in adopting a device or hold-ring to prevent the misuse of tampering of filled bottles of reputed brand by unscrupulous persons.<br>
Fig.2 : The Cap body member with circular extended web downwards consists of a cap portion (6) a rupturable portion (7) and circumferential bead (8) and the edges of the circular web extended downwards (9) acts as lock/grip on the bottom circumferential bead.<br>
In Fig.3 the surfaces of the various features of the neck portion of the bottle are smugly<br>
holding on the interior surface of the circular extended body of the web, when the bottle<br>
is crimp fitted.<br>
In Fig.4, the hold ring (3) (4) and (5) is shown as not being lifted off the neck of the<br>
bottle.<br>
From the description of the present invention it can thus be seen that when the cap of the bottle is opened by breaking the tear off portion or circumferential rupturable web,<br><br>
ne noia nng OT THe cap web body is left secured fitted within the neck of the botle and an impediment for further closure by any means. Hence the bottle and the contents cannot be misused even if the cap is tampered.<br>
In a general manner while there has been disclosed an effective and efficient invention of a threading system on the bottle with circumferential beads and a cap body member with a circular web extended downwards which is crimp fitted, it should be well understood that the invention is not limited to such features as described herein above as there might be changes made in the arrangements, dispositions and form of the Darts, dimensions and changes in the media of the bottle, from crown cork, glass, plastics, aluminium or other materials and the measurements of the features described herein above may vary according to the size of the bottle without departing from the principle of the present invention as comprehended within the scope of the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
