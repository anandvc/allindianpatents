				<td>MATERIAL FEEDING DEVICE FOR CYLINDER SEWING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a material feeding device for cylinder sewing machine, and more particularly to the material feeding device that actualizes reducing the distance from the center of a needle to the front edge of needle plate mount of a material feeding portion configured at the left side of the needle while facing forward, thereby realizing an easier sewing of leather bags, leather shoes, and so on.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art<br>
FIG. 1 shows an outward appearance of a side view facing material feeding direction of a right side of a needle of a cylinder sewing machine provided with a horizontal rotary hook, FIG. 2 shows a cross sectional view of a material feeding mechanism, and FIG. 3 shows a structural view of a cutting pedestal.<br>
A main head (1) comprises a needle bar mechanism, a balance mechanism, and an upper material feeding mechanism, and the main head (1) is fixedly configured to a base (2). A thread feeding device (5) and material feeding teeth (10) for executing material feeding are configured on a left side facing the needle (4). A right side of the needle (4) is configured with a cutting pedestal (21) supporting the rotary hook. Each of the mechanisms of the main head (1) rotates in synchronization, thereby achieving objective of sewing.<br>
A needle plate (7) is fixedly configured to a needle plate mount (6), the needle plate mount (6) being configured with material feeding teeth (10). A disc gear (11) is configured on a lateral surface of the material feeding teeth (10), and which mutually meshes with a freely rotatable gear (12) that is supported by means of sleeve coupling (32). The bottom of the gear (12) is connected to a shaft (14) via universal joints (13a), (13) and (13b). The said shaft 14, supported by a bearing, can rotate-freely and is fixedly configured with a gear 15 at its lower end.<br><br>
The uni-directional clutches (17) and (18) are connected to the shaft (not shown) which is configured with a gear (16) at the front end and the said gear (16) is mutually meshed with the gear (15). The gear (16) is freely rotatable by means of a bearing support (not shown).<br>
A mechanism that drives the material feeding teeth (10) is configured on the needle plate mount (6). Such a configuration produces a difference in distance between a distance (B) from the needle (4) to an<br>
outer lateral surface of the needle plate mount (6) and a distance (A) from the needle (4) to an outer lateral surface of the needle plate (7).<br>
Working movement of a material feeding device is described hereinafter, wherein a swinging motion transmitted from a material feeding movement production mechanism (not shown) enables the unidirectional clutches (17) and (18) to produce mutual swinging through pull rods (19) and (20). The unidirectional clutches (17) and (18) connectively move with a shaft (not shown) configured center of the gear (16), thereby enabling the gear (16) to execute intermittent rotation.<br>
The Intermittent rotation is transmitted to the gear (15), and the gear (15) fixedly configured on the perpendicularly fitted shaft (14) transmits the intermittent rotation to the material feeding teeth (10) by means of the universal joints (13b), (13) and (13a) and utilizing the gear (12) and the gear (11) to alter direction.<br>
Because a thread feeding device (5) turns in synchronization with the intermittent rotation of the material feeding teeth (10), thus material to be sewed is pulled along on a needle plate (7) or three-dimensional material is pulled along on a cutting pedestal (21) by being clamped between the thread feeding device (5) and the material feeding teeth (10), and through working movements of the balance mechanism, the<br>
bar   needle   mechanism   and   the   rotary   hook   mechanism   sewing   operation   is   thereby accomplished.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, which shows the material feeding mechanism of the cutting pedestal<br>
(21) positioned on a right side of the needle (4) and having the rotary hook configured thereon,<br><br>
because motion mechanism of the material feeding teeth (10) is configured on the needle plate mount (6), and the distance (B) from a center of the needle (4) to a left extremity of the needle plate mount (6) is relatively larger than the distance (A) to an extremity of the needle plate (7) (see FIG. 3), difficulty in sewing of three-dimensional materials of relatively stiff material results thereof. Hence, there is a necessity for improvement in design of the material feeding device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A material feeding mechanism of the present invention, which modifies a needle plate<br>
mount conventionally fixedly configured on a left side of a needle to be fixedly configured on a<br>
cutting pedestal of a right side of the needle, and transmits motion to a transmission mechanism<br>
of material feeding teeth attached within the cutting pedestal, thereby resulting in a distance from<br>
the needle to an outer end of a needle plate to equal a distance from the needle to an outer side<br>
extremity of the needle plate.<br>
The present invention provides a material feeding device for cylinder sewing machine<br>
comprising a main head which is fixedly configured to a base and is provided with a needle bar<br>
mechanism, a balance mechanism, and an upper material feeding mechanism, whereby each of<br>
the mechanisms of the main head rotate in synchronization with the material feeding mechanism<br>
of the cutting pedestal, and the thread feeding device and the material feeding teeth are<br>
configured on the left side of the needle by facing forward, and the cutting pedestal, utilized to<br>
support the rotary hook, is configured to the right side of the needle,<br>
characterized in that:<br>
the rotary hook is fixedly configured at the top of the cutting shaft which is<br>
disposed at the center of the cutting shaft sleeve to be supported by the bearing<br>
and freely rotatable over the cutting pedestal; and<br>
a coronal gear, fixedly configured above the cutting shaft sleeve, meshes with the<br>
relay gear which is fixedly configured over the needle plate mount via a bolt.<br>
whereby the needle plate mount is fixedly screwed to the cutting pedestal, the<br><br>
relay gear is enabled to freely rotate above the needle plate mountvia a guide plate<br>
and meshes with the material feeding teeth with the same external gear shape, the<br>
other end of the relay gear meshes with the coronal gear,<br>
the arrangement being such that the transmission mechanism composed of the said coronal<br>
gear, material feeding teeth and relay gear are composed in a longitudinal configuration to<br>
shorten the distance between the needle and the perpendicular face of the needle plate mount.<br>
According to aforementioned configuration, a cylinder sewing machine of the present invention is able to simplify execution of sewing of three-dimensional materials made from relatively stiff material, thereby enhancing effectiveness of the cylinder sewing machine.<br>
To enable a further understanding of the said objectives and the technological methods of the invention herein, the brief description of the drawings below is followed by the detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 shows a side view of an outward appearance of a cylinder sewing machine of conventional art.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a cross sectional view of an assemblage of a cutting pedestal of conventional art.<br>
FIG 3 shows a schematic side view of an outward appearance of the cutting pedestal of conventional art.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a schematic side view of an outward appearance of the cutting pedestal according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a cross sectional view of an assemblage of a material feeding mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 show conventional art, FIG. 4 shows a structural explanatory view of an<br><br>
outward appearance of the present invention. FIG. 5 shows a cross sectional view of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a rotary hook (28) is fixedly configured on a top extremity of a cutting shaft (22) fitted center of a cutting pedestal (21), and the cutting shaft (22) is further configured central of a cutting shaft sleeve (23), and is enabled to be freely rotatable by means of a bearing (24) support on the cutting pedestal (21).<br>
A coronal gear (25) is fixedly configured on the cutting shaft sleeve (23), and which mutually meshes with a relay gear (30) fixedly configured to the needle plate mount (6) by means of a bolt (33). The needle plate mount (6) is fixedly configured to the cutting pedestal (21) by means of a screw (not shown).<br>
Under effect of a guide plate (not shown), the relay gear (30) is enabled to freely rotate on the needle plate mount (6), while teeth formed on an outer periphery of the relay gear (30) are in concert with material feeding teeth (10), and, moreover, mutually mesh with the material feeding teeth (10). Another end of the relay gear (30) mutually meshes with the coronal gear (25), and acts as a relay station for transmitting rotation thereof. Furthermore, a gear (15) and teeth (16) (not shown) similarly mutually mesh at a lower section of the cutting shaft sleeve (23), and which transmit intermittent rotation to the coronal gear (25) of a top extremity of the cutting shaft sleeve (23).<br>
A transmission mechanism is structured to utilize the coronal gear (25), the material feeding teeth (10) and the relay gear (30), and which assume a lengthwise arrangement in outward appearance. The present invention has modified a 24mm distance B of conventional art (see FIG. 3) to a distance C (see FIG 4) (approximating a 15mm distance A of conventional art as depicted In FIG. 3), and can be reduced even more to a distance of 8.6mm.<br>
Working movement of a material feeding mechanism is described hereafter, wherein<br>
rotation of a lower shaft (not shown) utilizes pull rods (not shown) of a material feeding motion<br>
producing mechanism to enable unidirectional clutches (17) and (18) to produce an intermittent<br>
swinging motion, which then transmits the intermittent motion to the cutting shaft sleeve (23)<br><br>
through a gear mechanism, and thereon is transmitted to the material feeding teeth (10) through the relay gear (30) mutually meshing with the coronal gear (25). thus quantity of material to be sewed is synchronized and pulled along by being clamped between the thread feeding device (5) and the material feeding teeth (10).<br>
According to aforementioned configuration of the present invention, because of modification to the material feeding mechanism so as to be close to the left side of a needle, distance from the needle to the perpendicular face of the needle plate (7) has been reduced to the minimum as possible, thus enhancing sewing operation efficiency of three-dimensional materials made from relatively stiff material, for instance, leather bags, leather shoes, and so on.<br>
It is, of course, to be understood that the embodiments described herein is merely illustrative of the principles of the invention and that a wide variety of modifications thereto may be effected by persons skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
