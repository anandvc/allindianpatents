COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
CUTTING TOOL FOR WORK PIECES<br>
MAPAL  FABRIK FUR PRAZISIONSWERKZEUSE Dr. Kress KG of  OBERE BAHNSTRASSE 13, 73431 AALEN., GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed 5 -<br><br><br>
• iS<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a tool for the fine   machining of workpieces according to the preamble of claim 1. •<br>
 Tools of the type addressed here are known. They have at least one cutter tip, by meemn of which chips, are removed from the workpiece by a relative movement being realized between the tool or the cutting edge of the cutter tip and the workpiece  The tool is usually set in rotation in order to machine -n stationary workplace. The at least one cutter tip can be displaced by means -.of  a setting device, it lias<br>
been. found that, in the process, an exact orientation of the cutter tip cannot be realized or can only be realized with Considerable effort.<br>
The object- of the invention is therefore to provide a tool which does not have this disadvantage.    to   achieve this object, a tool is proposed which is<br>
Point-like contact between setting device and dutber tip is thus avoided. At the sam time, ;on account, of the tact that<br>
2<br><br>
the adjusting element extends over a (region of the side face<br>
of the cutter tip, exact positioning of the cutter tip is<br>
possible.	<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the tool which is distinguished by the fact thai: the adjusting element has an adjusting surface which comprises two bearing surfaces arranged at a distance from one another is preferred. In other words: the adjusting surface has an interruption in order to realize two contact regions  arranged at a distance<br>
i<br>
from one another, between the cutter tip and the adjusting element,<br>
An  exemplary  embodiment  of  the  tool  which  is<br>
	.......	i<br>
distinguished by the fact that the setting device has two adjusting elements which act on different side faces of the cutter tip and thus permits different setting directions is<br>
i<br>
especially preferred.	<br>
Further  configurations  follow  from  the  remaining subclaims <br>
The invention is explained in; more detail below with<br>
■   i	-•■.■•<br>
i<br>
reference to the drawing in which:  i<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic  ketch of  a tool in front view Figure 2  shows a detail of the tool in aide view, Figure 3 shows a first modified form compared with the tool shown in figure 2;<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a further modified form of the tool shown in<br>
figure 2;	"<br>
Figure 5 shows views of an adjusting element; Figure 6 shows a plan view of a modified exemplary embodiment<br>
of the adjusting element, and Figure 7 shows a side view of the adiustinq element shown in<br>
figure S. The diagrammatic sketch according to figure 1 shows a tool 1 in front view, that is the front end 3 of the tool.<br>
Here,   the basic body 4 of the tool l, by way of example, is designed to be essentially cylindrical, It is provided with a  recess which extends in the longitudinal  direction of the tool 1  andserves as chip space 5.    recess 9 into which a cutter tip1 11 is inserted is made in a boundary surface 7 of the chip space 5. An edge of the cutter tip 11 which projects beyond the peripheral surface 13 serves as cutting edge 15 and to remove chips from a workpiece. For example, the tool 1 serves for the fine machining of a bore surface 17, indicated by a circle, in a workpiece.<br>
in the exemplary embodiment shown here, the cutter tip 11 is fastened to the basic body of the tool 1 by means of a clamping screw 19 which passes through the cutter tip 11 and holds the latter securely by means of a  screw head, It is also possible to fasten the cutter tip 11 to the basic body of the tool 1 by means of a conventional clamping shoe.<br>
4<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the cutter tip 11 in side view. It can be seen that the top and bottom side faces  21 and 23,    respectively,<br>
1<br>
run conically toward one another and enclose an acute angle With one another, which opens from right to left. As a result, a "positive" clearance angle is realised: the side face 21 falls away from left to right starting from the cutting edge 15, whereas the bottom side face .23 rises from left to right.<br>
A setting  device  25,  which   comprises  an adjusting element 27,  interacts with the bottom side face 23. The adjusting element 27 is provided, with an adjusting surface 29, which bears flat against: the bottom side face 23 of the cutter tip 11 and falls away from right to left. The adjusting element 27 can be displaced relative to the cutter tip 11 by means of a set screw 31. The bottom side face 23 and  the  adjusting  surface  29  virtually  form  a  wedge  mechanism. During a displacement of the adjusting element 27 to the left, the cutter tip 11 is displaced outward in the radial direction relative to the rotational or center axis 33 of the tool 1.<br>
The adjusting element 27 has a preferably cylindrical extension 35, which is accommodated in a corresponding recess in the basic body 4 of the tool .1 and serves to guide  the adjusting element 2 7 in the tool 1. <br><br>
In the representation according to figure l, the basic<br>
"body 4 of the tool 1 is partly cut away  so that the clamping<br>
screw 19, the extension 35 and the set  screw 31 can be seen.<br>
The set screw 31 is accommodated in a hole which is made in<br>
the basic body 4 and opens to the right, that is to say it intersects the peripheral surface 13..; As a result, the set screw 31 is fiehley accaafliblo from the right. However, it  is also possible to design the chip space 5 to be so large that the set  screw 3,1 is also accessible from the left via the chip space 5.<br>
Figure 2, in plan view, shows the  front part of the tool 1  with" the cutter tip 11, the top longitudinal edge of which forms the cutting edge 15, the right-hand top corner 37 likewise belonging to the cutting edge of the cutter tip 11. Here, by way of example, the cutter tip is designed to be<br>
essentially square. However, it may  also be designed, for<br>
example, as a parallelogram or as a rhombus. The head of the<br>
clamping screw 19   which passes through the cutter tip 11 and<br>
is anchored in trie basic body of the tool l, can clearly be<br>
seen, By means " of this clamping screw 19, the full face of<br>
the cutter tip 11 is pressed against the base of the recess<br>
9. The setting device 25 can clearly be seen here,  in<br><br>
Particular the  adjusting element 27, which extends over a region of the bottom side face 23 of the cutter tip 11. The adjusting element preferably extends" over a substantial part<br>
6<br><br>
of the: side face of the cutter  tip 11 in particular Virtually over Its entire width. The  extension 35, which projects at the bottom beyond the adjusting element, can also be seen in the plan view. Here, just" like the clamping screw 19, the set screw 31 extends perpendicularly to the plane of figure 2.<br>
It can be seen from the representation  accoxding to figure 2 that the setting device 25 comprises an adjusting element 27 which, during an appropriate displacement, displaces the cutter tip 11 at an angle of 90° to the center axis 33. The machining radius of the tool 1, that is the size of the  projection of the cutting edge 15 relative to the peripherals surface 13, can thus bo set.<br>
It can be seen from figure 2  that the cutter tip 11 also  projects relative to the front end 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows a first modified form of the tool l. The same elements are provided with the same reference numerals, so that in this respect reference is made to the description of  figures 1 and 2.<br>
The exemplary embodiment shown in figure 3 differs from that shown in figure 2 solely by virtus of the fact  that the setting device 2 5 is not arranged between the putter tip .3.1 and the center axis 33 of the tool 1 " but at the inner side face 39 of the cutter tip 11  the side face 39 here running essentially perpendicularly  to  the  center  axis  33  and<br><br><br>
                           7<br><br>
parallel to the outer side face 41 which projects beyond the<br>
front end 3 of the tool 1.	<br><br>
In an arrangement of the setting device 25 and of the associated adjusting element 27 according to figure 3, an axial displacement of the cutter tip 11 is achieved by means of the set screw 31, so that ir.s outer side face 41 projects more or lean  beyond the front end 3 of the tool 1.<br>
The modified exemplary embodiment of the tool 1 shown in<br>
figure 4 is distinguished by the fact that the setting device<br>
25 has two adjusting elements 27 and 27" , the first adjusting<br>
element, as explained with reference to figure 2,    running<br>
between cuttar tip 11 and center axis 33 of the tool, and the<br>
second adjusting element 27  as  explained with reference to<br>
figure 3, running at a distance  from the front end 3<br>
"perpendicularly to the center axis 33.  It is therefore<br>
possible to set the projection of the cutter tip beyond both<br>
the peripheral surface 13 and the front end 3, that is the<br>
radius and the length of the tool.<br>
Figure 5 shows one of the adjusting elements, for example the adjusting element 27 of the setting device 25,  in various view  and also the set screw 31. At the top in figure 5, the set screw 31  is shown in aide view on. the extreme left. The set screw 31 hers is a differential screw" which has two  separate regions with different external threads; for example, the left-hand region 43 is designed aa<br>
8<br><br>
a right-handed thread and the right-hand region 43 is deigned as a left-handed thread The threaded regions may of course also be transposed it is essential here that the threaded regions have opposite orientation.<br>
To the right of the set screw 31, the adjusting element 37 is shown in side view, as is the case in figure 1. The adjusting  element 27 is again shown to the right  of this in front view, as is the case in figures 2 and 4. On. the extreme right at the top, the adjusting element 27 is    again shown in <br>
side view, although here the left side of the adjusting element 27 is reproduced. At the bottom in figure 5, the adjusting element 27 is reproduced in plan view, 30 that the adjusting surface 29 can also be seen in plan view. The cylindrical extension 35, which serves to guide. the adjusting element 27 in the basic body of the , tool 1-, becomes clear from the representation according to figure 5. The hole 47 serving to receive the set screw 31 can clearly be seen in the various representations of the adjusting element 27. It passes through the extension 35,<br>
In the top half of figure 5, it can be seen that the adjusting surface 29 is inclined relative to the center plane 47, indicated by a line, of the adjusting element 27. The angle of inclination of the adjusting surface 29 is matched to the angle of inclination of that side face of the cutter tip 11 against which the adjusting element 27 bears.<br>
9<br><br>
In an especially preferred manner, the adjusting surface  29 13 designed in such a way that it has two bearing surfaces 29a and "29b lying at a distance from one another. The region 29o lying in between is sunk relative to the adjacent regions, so that the adjusting element 27 does not touch the associated aide face of the cutter tip 11 here. This configuration ensures that, the adjusting element 27 bears flat against the associated side faces of the cutter tip 11, so that- support of the cutter tip 11 over a relatively large area by means of the setting element 2 5 is ensured. In particular, more or less point-like contact of a set screw, ay ussed in a conventional manner, is  avoided.<br>
Figure:  i5 shows a modified exemplary embodiment of. an<br>
adjusting element 27 in plan view, Parts  which correspond to<br>
, the parts?  described above  are  provided with  the  same<br>
reference numerals, so that in this respect -reference is made<br>
to tha description with regard to figures 1 to 5.<br>
The. adjusting element 27 has an adjusting surface 29 which, as explained with refensnce . to figure 5, has two bearing surfaces 29a and 29b arranged at a distance from one another. Provided between the bearing surfaces 29a and 29b is a sunk reqion 29c, which does not touch the associated side face ,of a cutter tip 11 when the adjusting element is being used.-<br>
10<br><br>
. A hole 47, into which a clamping screw (not shown here) can be inserted, passes  through the adjusting element 27.<br>
The exemplary embodiment of the adjusting element 27 shown here is distinguished by the fact that wall regions laterally adjoining the adjusting surface 29 are designed in a V-shape, the V opening from top to bottom in the direction of  the adjusting  surface 29. This results in two opposite contact surfaces 51 and 51 the length of which is defined by the bottom region 53 opposite the adjusting surface 29 being rounded off. The contact surfaces used are the rectilinear sections between the region 53 and the adjusting surface 29  of the side wall of the adjusting element 27.<br>
The region 53 connecting the two contact surfaces 51, 51" Is of curved design. Its outer contour preferably follows ah arc of a circle. The radius of the arc of a circle is preferably selected to be larger than that of the recess in the basic body 4 of the tool 1, into which recess the adjusting element 27 is inserted. This ensures that the adjusting -element 27 touches the basic body 4 of the tool l merely in the region of the contact surfaces 51, 51".<br>
An exaet angular orientation of the adjusting element"27 and thus of the adjusting surface 79  is obtained by means of the v.-shaped contact surfaces 51, 51", which interact  with corresponding bearing surfaces in the basic body" 4 of the tool 1- This exact orientation enables the cutter tip 11<br>
\11<br><br>
interacting "with the adjusting element 27 to be oriented exactly and thus enables, for example, the desired slope of a secondary cutting edge, which slopes down from the front edge of a cutter tip 11 (SEE figure 2 for example) to the left, to be ensured.<br>
The yj.de view of the adjusting element 27 shown in  figure 7 shows that it is designed essentially like the adjusting element explained with reference to figures 1 to 5. Figure 7 shows the width B of the. contact surfaces 51, 51" . A first, line 55 indicates how far the contact surfaces 51, 51" extend downward. A second line 57 indicates that the contact surfaces 51, 5l do not have to extend fully up to the adjusting surface 29.<br>
     It is essential that the adjusting element 27 explained with reference to figures 6 and 7 is distinguished by the fact that both the adjusting element 27 and the adjusting surface 29 are exactly oriented by V-shaped or: prismatic orientation of the contact surfaces 51 51 <br>
Adjusting elements as have been explained with reference to figures 6 and 7 may be used individually,  as  described with reference to figures 2 and 3. However, it is also possible  to use two such adjusting elements, as has been<br>
explained, with reference to figure 4<br>
It is especially advantageous that the setting device 25 is of very simple construction" and the inclination of the<br>
12<br><br>
side faces  of  the cutter tip  11  which is provided for by the positive clearance angle,  is utilized for forming  wedge mechanism, it is thus possible in a simple manner to displace the cutter tip 11 in the direction of the center axis 33 and/or at an angle thereto by displacing the adjusting element 27 and./or the second adjusting element 27<br>
In practice, the size of the adjustment... is relatively small and. essentially serves to compensate for tolerances in the manufacture of the cutter tip 11 and/or of the recess 9 receiving the cutter tip. In addition, any clearance possibly .still present between clamping screw 19 and cutter tip 11 can be compensated fox- by means of the setting devices described hers. In particular, a settling movement of the cutter tip, that is a displacement of the cutter tip 11 during the initial use of the tool 1, can be reliably avoided in a simple manner.<br>
From the explanations with regard to figures 1 to 7, it-can readily be seer that the setting device described here may also  in particular, be used in tools which have a "plurality of cutter tips  By means of the setting device 25, dimensional differences between the various cutter tips can then also be compensated For,     that is to say not only dimensional differences which exist in the respective cutting edge 15 of a cutter tip 11.<br>
13<br><br>
Finally, the setting device 25 described here may also *e uaod together with tools whose outer contour is not cylindrical, at least not continuously cylindrical. In all cases, it is ensured that the setting of the cutter tip and its positioning can be optimally predetermined, so that dimensional specifications can he exactly adhered to during the fine machining.<br>
From the above,  it becomea clear that,  when the set screw 31 is turned in the one direction of rotation, the adjusting element 21    is displaced and, on account of the wedge-shaped contact between the adjusting element: 27 and the cutter tip 11,  the cutter tip 11 is displaced radially outward, in the course of which the clamping ©crew 19 holding the cutter tip 11 is elascically deformed. If, in the course  of setting work, the Bet screw 31 is turned in the other direction  of  rotation,  "the  adjusting  element  27  is accordingly displaced in the other direction/ as a result of which, on account of the wedge-shaped contact with the cutter tip 11, the latter is moved back into the position directed radially inward. This movement is effected on.account of the elastic deformation of the clamping screw 19 by virtue of the fact, that the existing prestreas  is  reduced ayain  ss  a function of the yiae of the displacement o£ the adjusting element 27, it is therefore not necessary to knock "the cutter tip  11  inward  with  a  tool,  but  rather  this  return<br>
