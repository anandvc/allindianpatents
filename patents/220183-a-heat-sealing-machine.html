				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention pertains to the field of conditioning of products and in particular of rotary heatsealing machines with the purpose of closing bags and pouches of heatsealable material.<br>
In known heatsealing machines, the top edges of the bag or pouch to be closed are heated through their outer side so as to soften the thermoplastic material of the bag or pouch before, it is sealed by pressure of the topedges against one another. The result is that the thicker the thermoplastic sheets, the more calorific power is required to soften the thermoplastic material in order to seal together the top edges of the bag or pouch. Furthermore, the length of the machine increases with the amount of required calorific power to soften the thermoplastic material.<br>
The present invention has therefore purpose to obviate to these inconveniences of known heatsealing machines and to that effect presents a h e a t s e aling d e v ice as defined in the claims.<br>
The invention has also for object a heatsealing machine operating the device as per the invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a heat sealing machine for sealing bags or pouches comprising;<br>
two endless belts (11) rotating in the opposite direction, two wheels (12) driving the said belts, characterized in that the lips of the bags or pouches to be sealed are drawn inside through the said endless belts (11) and the interior walls of the said lips are softened by heating and the softened lips are further guided through the guiding wheels (15) in order to seal the lips against one another.<br>
The  invention  is  explained  as  follows,  with  the  help  of appended drawings including :<br>
-	figure 1 is a plan view of an example of mechanical motion<br>
of bags or pouches in a rotary (continuous motion) heatsealing<br>
machine ;<br>
figure 2 is a perspective view of an example of mechanical device as per the invention to set apart the edges to be sealed<br>
-	figures 3 and 4 illustrate the setting aspect of the edges<br>
to  be  sealed  during the trav. el Of a  bag in the device of<br>
figure 2 ;<br>
-	figure 5 is a perspective view of an example of pneumatic<br>
device as per invention to set apart the edges to be sealed.<br>
On figure 1 is shown an example of a device to move the bags or pouches.<br>
This moving device comprises essentially two endless belts 11, rotating in opposed directions. These belts are driven by two wheels 12 and maintained by two guiding wheels 15. The parallel parts 12 move between pressure_ elements 16 subject of spring effect (not shown). The edges of bags or pouches to be closed are presented at the infeed of the parallel belts 12 and are driven between these. The edges of the bags 10 moven continuously one after the other in front of a heating device (not shown on figure 1) foreseen at the infeed of the belts 12 so as to soften the thermoplastic material on the edges to be sealed, thereafter these edges heated and softened of each bag are pressed together to ensure sealing, thus closing the bags or pouches one after the other.<br>
In conformity with the invention, the softening of edges 11 of the bags is obtained by heating the inner sides of the edges of the bags rather then the outer sides as is done on known heatsealing machines. By thus heating the inner edges to be sealed, the calorific energy produced by a heating source is applied directly on the active faces of the edges to be sealed and is effective without loss through the thickness of the edges contrary to what occurs when the heat is applied at the outer faces of the edges and has than to penetrate through the thickness of the bags or pouches's material. A noticeable gain of calorific energy is thus resulting.<br>
To heat the inner faces of the edges 11 of the bag or pouch, it is at first necessary to set these edges apart, which may be done by a mechanical or by a pneumatic device.<br>
The figure 2 illustrates an example of mechanical solution. A cross piece 22 presents a salient 24 in the axis alignrent of travel of the bags or pouches 10. The guides 28 are foreseen to lead the edges 11 of the bag or pouch 10 to be sealed towards the salient 24. The salient presents a groove 26 which temporarily holds back the forward corner 13 of the bag or pouch when it comes into contact with the salient 24. The bag or pouch is thus made to open up (figure 3) whilst it travels forward thanks to the fact that the both top edges are separated by the salient 24 (figure 4). In the vicinity of that salient 24 , the crosspiece may be fitted with a duct or pipe 27 through which the hot air under pressure is introduced to blow the air jet against the inner sides of the edges of the bag or pouch and so soften the thermoplastic material of the edges to be sealed.<br>
Furthermore, the air jet removes all dust or impurities before sealing operation.<br>
The figure 5 illustrates an example of pneumatic operation. The bag is led by the belts 11 between two guides 32 of which the inner sides 34 are slightly slanting so as to create a passage in the shape of an elongated funnel.<br>
The slanting flanges 34 are foreseen with a series of holes of various sections which could be closed according to the nature of the bags or pouches. Through foreseen inner channels in the guides 32, a slight depression may thus be created at the holes 36 so as to suck each top edge 11 of the bag or pouch 10 against the related guide. A mobile nozzle 38 is actuated to come in between the set against top edges and blow into it a jet of air/ The nozzle 38 may also be made to pivot in the direction of movement of the bag or pouch, so that the nozzle 38 can be disengaged as the rear of end of the bag or pouch 10 is passing through.<br>
It is well understand that various modifications may be brought by the skilled technician to the above device merely described above as an non limiting example without leaving the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1 .       A heat sealing machine for sealing bags or pouches comprising;<br>
two endless belts (11) rotating in the opposite direction, two wheels (12) driving the said belts, characterized in that the lips of the bags or pouches to be sealed are drawn inside through the said endless belts (11) and the interior walls of the said lips are softened by heating and the softened lips are further guided through the guiding wheels (15) in order to seal the lips against one another.<br>
2. A heat sealing machine for sealing bags or pouches substantially as herein described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br><br><br></td>
