	FORGOING MACHINE HAVING ROLLERS BETWEEN A SUPPORT AND<br>
				A SLIDE BODY OF A DIE ASSEMBLY<br>
		The invention relates to a. forging machine, more<br>
	particularly to a forging machine having rollers between<br>
5	a support and a slide body of a male die assembly.<br><br>
		Fasteners, such as screws and nuts, are generally<br>
	manufactured by feeding a wire material into .a forging<br>
	machine. In the forging machine, the wire material is<br>
	straightened and cut into workpieces that are conveyed<br>
10	to a female die unit, and a male die unit is forced to<br>
	move to the female die unit to perform a series of forging<br>
	operations so as to forge the workpieces.<br>
		Referring to Figu.re 1 , a conventional forging machine<br>
	1 includes a support 11 having a receiving space 111,<br>
15	two rolling devices 12 disposed respectively at left<br>
	and right sides of the receiving space 111, and a. male<br>
	die assembly 13 installed slidiably in the receiving space<br>
	111. Bach rolling device 12 includes a plurality of<br>
	rollers 121 in contact with the male die assembly 23<br>
20	so that the male die assembly 13 can slide smoothly via.<br>
	the rollers 12 1, andgeneration of fractional heat during<br>
	the sliding of the male die assembly 13 can be avoided.<br><br>
		As the forging machine 1 is designed to produce a<br>
	large number of products within 1 man, the male die<br>
25	assembly 13 has to operate at a high speed. However,<br>
	since the rolling devices 12 are provided only at the<br>
	front of the two sides of the support 11 and at the front<br><br><br>
2<br>
	of the male die assembly 13 , during the sliding motion<br>
	of the male die assembly 13, the rolling movements occur<br>
	only at the front thereof, and the rear side of the male<br>
	die assembly 13 is suspended unsupportedly in the<br>
5	receiving apace 111. Furthermore, because the length<br>
	of the male die assembly 13 from a location where it<br>
	contacts the rollers 121 to its rear end is twice the<br>
	length from that location to its front end which is<br>
	assembled with a plurality of punching heads (not shown) ,<br>
10	in case the male die assembly 13 is tilted slightly,<br>
	its rear end will vibrate, resulting in positional<br>
	deviation and reduced stability of the punching heads.<br>
	As a result, when the male die assembly 13 moves forward<br>
	to effect forging, particularly, to press the front end<br>
15	punching heads against a female die assembly 14, the<br>
	male die assembly 13 will strike obliquely the female<br>
	die assembly 14, thereby adversely affecting the<br>
	accuracy of the forging operation and the quality of<br>
	products. Therefore, further improvement relating to<br>
20	the sliding of a male die assembly is desirable.<br>
		Therefore, the main object of the present invention,<br>
	is to provide a forging machine with improvements that<br>
	can overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior-<br>
	art .<br>
25		According to this invention, a forging machine<br>
	comprises a support including a bottom wall, two<br>
	sidewalls extending upward from left and right sides<br><br><br>
3<br>
	of the bottom wall, and two track plates attached to<br>
	the sidewalla, respectively. Each of the sidewalls has<br>
	a lower portion to which a corresponding one of the track<br>
	plates is attached, and an upper portion extending above<br>
5	the lower portion, The bottom wall , the sidewalls, and<br>
	the track, plates cooperatively confine a receiving<br>
	space.<br>
		The forging machine further comprises two first<br>
	rolling devices respectively mounted on the track plates<br>
10	proximate to a front end of the support, and having first<br>
	rollers exposed from the track plates, respectively;<br>
	two second rolling devices respectively mounted on the<br>
	upper portions proximate to a rear end of the support,<br>
	and having second rollers exposed from the upper portions,<br>
15	respectively; and a die assembly having a slide body<br>
	elidably mounted within the receiving space. The slide<br>
	body includes left and right lower side faces<br>
	respectively contacting the first rollers, and left and<br>
	right upper flanges that extend respectively above the<br>
20	left and right lower side faces and that are seated'<br>
	slidably and respectively on top of the track plates.<br>
	to contact the second rollers.<br>

	2, two first rolling devices 3, two second rolling<br>
	 devices 4 and a male die assembly 5.<br>
		The support 2 has a bottom wall 21, two sidewalls<br>
15	22 extending respectively from left and right sides of<br>
	the bottom wall 21, and two longitudinal track plates<br>
	23 mounted respectively on the sidewalls 22 and elongated<br>
	in a front-to-rear direction. The bottom wall 21, the<br>
	sidewalls 22 and the track plates 23 cooperatively<br>
20	confine a receiving space 24. Each sidewall 22 has a<br>
	lower portion 220 to which a corresponding one of the<br>
	track plate 23 is attached, and an upper portion 221.<br>
	The upper portion 231 is stepped and thus has a sidewall<br>
	shoulder face 222 extending horizontally and<br>
25	longitudinally above a top end of the corresponding track<br>
	plate 23 . A sidewall inner face 224 extends vertically<br>
	and downwardly from the. sidewall shoulder face 223 to<br><br><br>
6<br>
	the top end of the corresponding track plate 23 and faces<br>
	the receiving space 24. A cavity 223 is formed in the<br>
	upper portion 221 proximate to a rear end 227 of the<br>
	support 2, and opens at the sidewall shoulder face 222<br>
5	and at the sidewall inner face 324. Each, track plate<br>
	23 has upper and lower through holes 231 proximate to<br>
	a front end 229 of the support 2.<br>
		Referring to Figures 5, 6 and 7 in combination with<br>
	Figure 2 r each through hole 231 in each track plate 23<br>
10	has an inner small hole portion 233, an outer large hole<br>
	portion 234 , and a shoulder 235 formed inside the through<br>
	bole 23 1 between the large and small hole portions 2 34<br>
	and 23 3. The first rolling devices 3 are mounted in<br>
	the respective track places 23 on left and right sides<br>
15	of the male die assembly 5. Each first rolling device<br>
	3 includes two first roller units 31 mounted respectively<br>
	within the two through holes 231 in the corresponding<br>
	track plate 23. Each first roller unit 31 has a first<br>
	roller holder 311, a first roller 312 disposed inside<br>
20	the first roller holder 311 and exposed front the first<br>
	roller holder 311 to project into the receiving space<br>
	24 , a first roller shaft 313 holding pivot ally the first<br>
	roller 312 within the first roller holder 311, a first<br>
	packing plate 314 disposed between the corresponding<br>
25	track plate 23 and. sidewall 22, adjustment screws 315<br>
	extending threadedly into the first packing plate 314<br>
	through the track plate 2 3, springs' 316 disposed between<br><br><br>
7<br>
	the first roller holder 311 and theshoulder 235 inside<br>
	the through hole 231, and a fixing screw 3.17 extending<br>
	into the track plate 23 to abut against the first packing<br>
	plate 314.<br>
5		The first roller holder 311 has a holder inclined<br>
	face 318 that is proximate to the first packing plate<br>
	314 and that is inclined outwardly. And the first<br>
	packing plate 314 has a complementary packing inclined<br>
	face 319 in contact with the holder inclined face 318-<br>
10	Each spring 316 provides a biasing force that biases<br>
	the first roller holder 311 against the first packing<br>
	plats 314 . The first packing plate 314 can move forward<br>
	or rearward when the adjustment screws 315 are turned<br>
	and cooperates with the springs 316 to move the first<br>
15	roller holder 3 11 outward or inward. When the fixing<br>
	screw 317 is tightened, it abuts against and immobilizes<br>
	the first packing plate 314.<br>
		Referring to Figures 8, 9 and 10 in combination with<br>
	Figure 2, each second rolling device 4 includes a second<br>
20	roller unit 4 1 having a second roller holder 4 11 mounted<br>
	inside the cavity 223 of the respective sidewall 22 ,<br>
	The upper portion 221 of the sidewall 2 2 further has<br>
	a cavity bounding wall part 228 extending at one side<br>
	 of the second roller holder 4 11 opposite to the slide<br>
25	body 50 . The second roller unit 41 further has a second<br>
	 packing pi ate 415 inserted inbetweenthe cavity bounding<br>
	wall part 223 and the second roller holder 411, a second<br><br><br>
8<br>
	roller 412 disposed rotatably inside the second roller<br>
	holder 411 and exposed from the second roller holder<br>
	411 to project into the receiving space 24, a second<br>
	roller shaft 4 13 attached to the second roller holder<br>
5	411 to hold pivotally the second roller 412 within the<br>
	second roller holder 411, and two fastening bolts 414<br>
	extending through the cavity bounding wall part 228 and<br>
	the second packing plate 415 and inserted threadedly<br>
	into the second roller holder 411 so as to position the<br>
10	second roller holder 411 inside the cavity 223 . A cover<br>
	plate 42 is disposed over the sidewall shoulder face<br>
	222 and the second roller holder 411 and projects into<br>
	the receiving space 24 so as to extend over the male<br>
	die assembly 5. The cover plate 42 is fixed to the<br>
15	sidewall shoulder Eace 222 using a plurality of locking<br>
	screws 43.<br>
		Referring again to Figures 2, 7 and 10, the male die<br>
	assembly 5 has a slide body 50 slidably mounted within<br>
	the receiving space 24 to move forward or rearward . The<br>
20	slide body 50 includes left and right lower side faces<br>
	51 respectively confronting the track plates 23, left<br>
	and right upper flanges 52 that project outwardly above<br>
	the respective left and right lower- side faces 51 and<br>
	are seated slidably on the top ends of the track plates,<br>
25	respectively, two pairs of first steel plates 53 each<br>
	pair of which overlie portions of one of the left and<br>
	right lower side faces 51, and two second steel plate3<br><br><br>
9<br>
	54 covering outer surfaces of the respective left and<br>
	right upper f langes 52 . Each of the left and right upper<br>
	flanges 52 is slidable between the corresponding track<br>
	plate 23 and the corresponding cover plate 42 .<br>
5		when the slide body 50 is driven to move forward and<br>
	rearward, the first steel plates 53 are in sliding<br>
	contact with the respective first rollers 312, and the<br>
	second steel plates 54 are in sliding contact with the<br>
	respective second rollers 412, Due to the gapless<br>
10	sliding contact with the first and second rollers 312,<br>
	412 near both of the front and rear ends of the support<br>
	2, the slide body 50 can be slid smoothly and stably<br>
	within the receiving space 24.<br>
		Referring to Figures l,r 12 and 13, according to the<br>
15	second preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
	the second rolling device 4 may include a second roller<br>
	unit 44. The second roller unit 44 differs from the<br>
	second roller unit 41 of the first preferred embodiment<br>
	in having a second roller holder 441, a second packing<br>
20	plate 481, and a retaining plate 482.<br>
		The second roller holder 441 has a holder lateral<br>
	wall 442 facing the cavity bounding wall part 228 of<br>
	the sidewall 22 . The holder lateral wall 442 has a slide<br>
	groove 443 that extends in a direction from a top end<br>
25	to a bottom end of the second roller holder 441, and an<br>
	inclined surface 444 facing the slide groove 433. The<br>
	second packing place 401 is inserted into the slide<br><br><br>
10<br>
	groove 44 3 and has one side 4 88 in contact with the cavity<br>
	bound ing wall part 228, and another side 487 opposite<br>
	to the side 488 and contacting the inclined surface 444<br>
	of the holder lateral wall 442. The side 487 of the<br>
5	second packing plate 481 is inclined with respect to<br>
	the side 43 8 and the cavi ty bounding wall part 22 8 . The<br>
	second packing plate 481 is slidable. over the inclined<br>
	surface 444 and along the slide groove 443 to move the<br>
	second toller holder 441 in a direction substantially<br>
10	perpendicular to the cavity bounding wall part 228 so<br>
	that the second roller holder 441 can be moved toward<br>
	or away from the slide body 5 0 (see Figure 2).<br>
		The retaining plate 4 82 is fisted to a top end of<br>
	the second roller holder 441 above the second packing<br>
15	plate 481 by means of screws 489 so as to retain the<br>
	second packing plate 481 in the slide groove 443. An<br>
	adjustment screw 483 extends through the retaining plate<br>
	492 and is inserted threadedly into the second packing<br>
	plate 4.81 . Two fastening bolts 4 84 extend through the<br>
20	cavity bounding wall part 228. and are inserted threadedly<br>
	into the second packing plate 481 and the holder lateral<br>
	wall 442. A biasing member is associated with each<br>
	fastening bolt 484 to bias the second roller holder 441<br>
	to move in a direction toward the cavity bounding –wall<br>
25	part 228, or, away from the slide body 50 . Each fast ening<br>
	bolt 484 has a head 4841 extending outwardly of the cavity<br>
	bounding wall part 228. The biasing member in thi.s<br><br><br>
11<br>
	embodiment includes three spring discs 485 disposed<br>
	around each fastening blot 484 beween the head 4841<br>
	and the cavity bounding wall part. 228.<br>
		When the adjustment screw 483 is turned relative to<br>
5	the retaining plate 482, the second packing plate 481<br>
	can be moved upward or downward. When the second packing<br>
	plate 481 is moved upward, the second roller holder 441<br>
	is pushed toward the slide body 50 so that the position<br>
	of the second rol 1 er 4 12 is adjusted. When the second<br>
10	packing plate 481 is moved downward, the second roller<br>
	holder 411 is moved back by the biasing action of the<br>
	spring discs 485 in a direction away from the slide body<br>
	50 .<br>
		Referring to Figures 14 , 15 and 16, according to the<br>
15	third preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
	upper and lower plate portions 491 and 492 may be used<br>
	in place of the second packing plate 481 of the second<br>
	preferred embodiment, upper and lower groove portions<br>
	494, 49 5 may be used in place of the. slide groove 443<br>
20	of the second preferred embodiment, and upper and lower<br>
	surface portions 496, 497 may be used in place of the<br>
	inclined surface 4 44 in the second preferred embodiment.<br>
		Each o£ the upper and lower plate portions 491, 492<br>
	is inserted into one oi the upper and lower groove<br>
25	portions 4 94, 495, and has two opposite sides<br>
	respectively contacting the cavity bounding wall part<br>
	228 and one of the upper and lower surface portions 436,<br><br><br>
12<br>
	497. One inclined side 498 of the upper plate portion<br>
	491 contacts the upper surface portion 496, whereas one<br>
	inclined side 4 99 of the lower plate portion 492 contacts<br>
	the lower surface portion 497. The upper and lower<br>
5	surface portions 4 96, 497 are inclined in two different<br>
	directions so that the tipper groove portion 494 tapers<br>
	downward and t he 1ower groove port i on 495 tapers upward.<br>
	Likewise, the upper plate portion 491 tapers downward,<br>
	 and the lower plate portion 492 tapers upward. An<br>
10	adjustment screw 493 passes through the upper plate<br>
	portion 491 and is inserted into the lower plate portion<br>
