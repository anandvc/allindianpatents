This invention relates to a composition for improving age-related physiological deficits and extending life span in mammals. The invention also relates to a method for improving the condition of elderly mammals, particularly by preventing or restoring the age-related metabolic changes particularly those bound to mitochondria dysfunction.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Elderly mammals often become fi^l in their last few years of life. From an appearance point of view, they become thin and have poor skin and coat condition. Other symptoms include joint stiffiiess, loss of lean body mass, energy loss, weight gain, neurological disorders and digestive system problems.<br>
Certaia of these problems may be effectively tinted, using medication but a better alternative would be to delay the onset of these problems, or treat these problems, through the diet, hi particular, elderly animals should be fed a balanced, maintenance food that contains high quality protein, lower amoimts of fat to reduce energy intake, dietary fiber, and antioxidants. However, despite the use of balanced, maintenance foods, the condition of elderly animals may deteriorate r^idly.<br>
On the molecular level, it is known that mitochondria function is impaired durii^ aging and this is associated with important functional deficits (both physical and cognitive) and the development of degenerative diseases.<br>
Indeed, mitochondria generate most of the raiergy of the cell primarily through oxidative phosphorylation, a complex process that uses electrons generated through oxidation of glucose and fatty acids to gaierate ATP. Proteins of the mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation complex have been shown to be impaired upon aging, leading to a higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a deCTease in efficiency of energy production. Free radical produced by aerobic<br><br>
respiration cause cumulative oxidative damages resulting in aging and cell death. The biggest impact of age-related increase in ROS will be on somatic tissues composed of post-mitotic non-replicative cells (muscles: cardiac and skeletal, nervous tissues; brain, retinal pigment epithelium).<br>
Numerous age-related changes have been reported in mitochondria. Oxidative damage to mitochondria DNA (mt DNA) increases with aging (Beckman KB, Ames BN (1999) Mutat Res. 424 (l-2):51-8) along with the oxidation of glutathione (GSH) a major intracellular antioxidant system, which plays an important role in protection against age-related mt DNA oxidative damage. A substantial increase in protein oxidation is also obsa^ed upon aging (Stadtman ER. (1992), Science 257 (5074):1220-4). Age-related increase in the amount of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been linked to the high peroxidizabihty of the mitochondria lipids upon aging. This is well illustrated by the change in the composition of cardiolipin, a phosphoUpid found principally in mitochondria, which fatty acid composition tends to shift towards a more unsaturated state with substitution of 18:2 acyl chains with the more peroxidizable 22:4 and 22:5 upon aging (Laganiere S, Yu BP (1993), Gerontology 39 (1):7-1S). The mitochondria content in cardiolipin has also been reported to decrease witii age, Cardiolipin interacts with many components of the mitochondria inner membrane such as Cytochrome oxidase, transporters/ translocators (ADP/ATP, phosphate, pyruvate, carnitine, etc) and plays an active role in then: activity (Hoch FL. (1992) Biochim Biophys Acta. 1113 (1):71-133 ; Paradies G, Ruggiero FM. (1990) Biochim Biophys Acta. 1016(2):207-12). The mitochondria energy metabolism depends upon the transport of metabohtes such as pyruvate across the mitochondria inner membrane. Pyruvate transport is carrier-mediated (Hoch FL. (1988) Prog Lipid Res. 27 (3);199-270 ) and atequiremmt for cardiolipin has been demonstrated for optimal pyruvate translocase activity (Paradies G, Ruggiero FM. (1990) Biochim Biophys Acta. 1016 (2):207-12). Otiier modifications such as decrease in mitochondria membrane potential and morphological changes (swelling, altered cristae, matrix vacuolisation) are associated with chronic oxidative stress and aging.<br><br>
Several dietary intarentions have been described that restore the age-related letaboUc changes and increase longevity.<br>
For example, long-term caloric restriction (CR) initiated before mid-hfe, retards aging and has multiple effects on the metabolism of the cell. Indeed, CR decreases oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids in rodents (Shigenaga MK, Ames BN. (1994) in: Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease, B. Frei editor. Academic Press, New York, pp 63-106) increases motor activity in rodents, reduces fiber loss and the age-related accumulation of dysfunctional fibers (Aspnes LE et al. (1997) FASEB J. 11 (7):573-81). However life long food restriction in pets is both unpractical and not well perceived by pet owners.<br>
Therefore there is a need for non-restricted and efiScient nutritional ways of improving age-related physiological deficits and extending Hfe span in humans and animals, more particularly pets.<br>
Summary of the Inventioii<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a food composition intended to prevent or restore age-related functional deficits in mammals by reversing age-related gene expression alterations, which comprises a combination being able to mimic the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression, said cofflbiaation containing at least one molecule that stimulates energy metaboUsm of the cell and at least one antioxidant.<br>
Indeed, it has been surprisingly foxmd that the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression can be mimicked by nutritional interventions that do not limit calorie intake but result in improved mitochondria function. In fact, it is possible to target mitochondria function through dietary intervention and have an impact on genes linked to energy metaboUsm and longevity.<br>
In a preferred embodunent, the molecule that stimulates energy metabolism is any nutrient improving energy production in mitochondria, such as L-caraitine,<br><br>
creatine, fatty acids (mono and polyunsaturated, particularly omega-3 fatty acids), cardiolipin, nicotinamide, carbohydrate and natural sources thereof, for example.<br>
The antioxidant aims to prevent oxidative damage that can result from the disruption of the ATP/ADP and/or NAD+/NADH homeostasis due to the increased substrate availability / utilization in the aged mitochondria. Among antioxidants: sources of tiiiols, compounds that decrease protein oxidation and compounds that upregulate cell antioxidant defenses are preferably used.<br>
The food composition may be a complete and nutritionally balanced food for human or animal. It can also be a dietary supplement, for example.<br>
The food composition according to the present invention can prevent or delay mitochondrial dysfunctions occuring during aging by modulating and/or regulating expression of genes linked to energy raetaboUsm. It can also provide multiple benefits by improving age-related functional deficits e.g. in skeletal and cardiac muscle function, vascular function, cognitive function, vision, hearing, olfaction, skin and coat qiiaUty, bone and joint health, renal health, gut function, immxme function, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory processes, cancer incidence and ultimately increasing longevity in pets.<br>
In another aspect, this invention relates to the use of a combination being able to mimic the effects of caloric restriction on gene eiqiression, which comprises at least one molecule that stimulates energy metabohsm of the cell and at least one antioxidant, for the preparation of a composition intended to prevent or restore age-related functional deficits m mammals.<br>
In a fijither aspect, this invention provides a method to prevent or restore age-related functional deficits in mammals, comprising administering to the mammal, a food composition comprising a combination being able to mimic the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression, said combination containing at least one molecule that stimulates energy metabohsm of the cell and at least one antioxidant.<br><br>
The said composition may be administered to the mammal as a supplement to the normal diet or as a component of a nutritionally complete food. It is preferred to include the nutritional agent in a nutritionally complete food.<br>
Administering to a mammal, a food composition as described above, results in an improved mitochondria function, also mimicking the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression without limiting calorie intake.<br>

They may be sources of thiols (e.g. Llpoic acid, cysteine, cystine, methionine, S-adenosyl-methionine, taurine, glutathione and natural sources thereof), or compounds that upregulate their biosynthesis in vivo, for example.<br>
The antioxidant according to the invention may be used either alone or in association with other antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), carotenoids (carotenes, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthine..) ubiquinones (e.g.CoQlO), tea catechins (e.g epigallocatechin gallate), coffee extracts containing polyphenols and/or diterpenes (e.g. kawheol and cafestol), ginkgo biloba extracts, grape or gr^e seed exfracts rich in proauthocyanidins, spice extracts (e.g. rosemary), soy extracts containing isoflavones and related phytoestrogens and other sources of flavonoids with antioxidant activity, compounds that upregulate cell antioxidant defense (e.g. ursodeoxycholic acid for increased glutathione S-transferase, ursoUc acid for increased catalase, ginseng and gingenosides for increase superoxide dismutase and natural sources thereof i.e. herbal medicines).<br>
Preferably, the amount of the antioxidant is of at least 0.025 mg per kg of body weight per day, more preferably from 0.025 mg to 250mg per kg of body weight per day.<br>
The food composition may be a complete and nutritionally balanced food. It can also be a dietary supplement, for example.<br>
In one embodiment, a nutritionally complete pet food can be prepared. The nutritionally complete pet food may be in any suitable form; for example in dried form, setni-moJst form or wet form; it may be a chilled or shelf stable pet food product.

For dried pet foods a suitable process is extrusion cooking, althougji baking and other suitable processes may be used. When extrusion cooked, the dried pet food is usually provided in the form of a kibble. If a prebiotic is used, the prebiotic may be admixed with the other ingredients of the dried pet food prior to processing. A suitable process is described in European patent application No 0850569;. If a probiotic micro-organism is used, the organism is best coated onto or filled into the dried pet food. A suitable process is described in European patent appUcation No 0862863.<br>
For wet foods, the processes described in US patents 4,781,939 and 5,132,137 may be used to produce simulated meat products. Other procedures for producing chunk type products may also be used; for example cooking in a steam oven. Alternatively, loaf type products may be produced by emulsifying a suitable meat material to produce a meat emulsion, adding a suitable gelling agent, and heating the meat emulsion prior to filling into cans or other containers.<br>
In another embodiment, a food composition for himiau consumption is prepared. This composition may be a nutritional complete formula, a dairy product, a chilled or shelf stable beverage, soup, a dietary supplement, a meal replacement, and a nutritional bar or a confectionery.<br>
Apart from the combination according to tiie invention, tiie nutritional formula may comprise a source of protein. Dietary proteins are preferably used as a source of proteirt The dietary proteins may be any suitable dietary protein; for example animal proteins (such as milk proteins, meat proteins and egg proteins); vegetable proteins (such as soy protein, wheat protein, rice protein, and pea protein); mixtures of fi^e amino acids; or combinations thereof. Milk proteins such as casein, whey proteins and soy proteins are particularly preferred. The composition may also contain a source of carbohydrates and a source of fat.<br>
If the nutritional formula includes a fat source, the fat source preferably provides about 5% to about 55% of the energy of the nutritional formula; for example about 20% to about 50% of the energy. The lipids making up the fat source<br><br>

Any suitable carbohydrates may be used, for example sucrose, lactose, glucose, fructose, com syrup solids, and maltodextrins, and mixtures thereof. Dietary fibre may also be added if desired. If used, it preferably comprises }xp to about 5% of the energy of the nutritional formula. The dietary fibre may be from any suitable origin, including for example soy, pea, oat, pectin, guar gum, gum arabic, and fiuctooligosaccharides. Suitable vitamins and minerals may be included in the nutritional formula in an amount to meet the appropriate guidelines.<br>
One or more food grade emulsifiers may be incorporated into the nutritional formula if desired; for example diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides, lecithin and mono- and di-glycerides. Similarly suitable salts and stabilisers may be included.<br>
The nutritional formula intended improving or preventing age-related fimctional deficits is preferably enterally administrable; for example in the form of a powder, a liquid concentrate, or a ready-to-drink beverage. If it is desired to produce a powdered nutritional formula, the homogenised mixture is transferred to a suitable drying apparatus such as a spray drier or freeze drier and converted to powder.<br>
In another embodiment, a usual food product may be enriched with the combination according to the present invention. For example, a feimented milk, a yoghurt, a fresh cheese, a renneted milk, a confectionery bar, breakfast cereal flakes or bars, drinks, milk powders, soy-based products, non-milk fermented products or nutritional supplements for climcal nutrition. Then, the amount of the molecide fliat stimulates energy metabolism is preferably of at least about 50 ppm by weight and the antioxidant is preferably of at least 10 com bv weifiht.<br><br>

As target genes the following non exhaustive gene list includes genes involved in:<br>
-	ATP generation (brmn creatine kinase, muscle creatine kinase, mito sarcomeric creatine kinase, ATP synthase, Adenine nucleotide translocase, creatine transporter, tricarboxilate carrier, phosphate transporter,...),<br>
-	glycolysis (alpha-enolase, glucose-6~phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase...),<br>
-	gluconeogenesis (glucose-6 phosphatase, glucose 1,6-bis phosphatase,...),<br>
-	p-oxidation (carnitine carrier, pahnitoyl. Carnitine transferase....)<br>
-	inflammatory response (cox-2, cyclophilin C-AP, lysozyme C....),<br>
-	mitochondria biogenesis (mitochondria LON protease, HSP70...),<br>
-	fatly acid synthesis (fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase,...)<br>
-	cardiolipin synthesis (PA :CTP cytidylyl transferase...),<br>
-	protein turnover (proteasome subunit, ribosomal proteins,....),<br>
-	stress response ( NF-K-B- p65, I-K-B a chain...),<br>
-	thiol protease (cathepsin H and D..),<br>
-	and other genes (thyroid hormone receptor, glutamine synthase	), for<br>
example.<br>
TTie food composition according to the present invention can also provide multiple benefits by improving age-related fimctional deficits e.g. in skeletal and<br><br>
cardiac muscle function, vascular function, cognitive function, vision, hearing, olfaction, skin and coat quality, bone and joint health, renal health, gut function, immune function, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory processes, and ultimately increasing longevity in mammals.<br>
According to another aspect, this invention relates to the use of a combination being ahle to mimic the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression, which comprises at least one molecule that stimulates energy metaboUsm of the cell and at least one antioxidant, for the preparation of a composition intended to prevent or restore age-related functional deficits in mammals.<br>
The said molecule and antioxidant have been described above.<br>
According to a last aspect, this invention provides a method to prevent or restore age-related functional deficits in mammals, comprising administering to the mammal, a food composition comprising a combination being able to mimic the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression, said combination containing at least one molecule that stimulates energy metabolism of the cell and at least one antioxidant.<br>
The said composition may be administered to the mammal as a supplement to the normal diet or as a component of a nutritionally complete food. It is preferred to prepare a nutritionally complete food as described above.<br>
Preferably, the amoimt of the food composition to be consumed by the mammal to obtain a beneficial effect will depend upon its size, its type, and its age. However an amount of said molecule of at least Img per kg of body weight per day and an amount of the antioxidant of at least 0.025 mg per kg of body weight per day, would usually be adequate.<br>
Administering to a pet or human, a food composition as described above, results in an improved mitochondria function, also mimicking the effects of caloric restriction on gene expression without limiting calorie intake and side effects.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and in no way should be construed as limiting the subject matter of the present application. All percentages are given by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>

Dietary intervention was of 3 months, all animal groups were fed Ad lib except for the group of caloric restricted mice which as fed 67% of the daily food consumed by the control Ad Ub group. Animal weight was measured once a week.<br>
•	Animals:<br>
Male mice C57/B16 were obtained from Iffa credo (France) at 9 weeks of age. Upon arrival mice were housed by groups of 6 animals. After 3 weeks adaptation, mice (12 weeks old) were randomised in 6 groups (A to E) of 12 mice each and housed individually. Dietary intCTvention was of 3 months; mice had free access to water and were submitted to 12 hours light and dark cycles.<br>
•	Diets:<br>
The conttol diet (diet A) composedof 18% proteins (soy and whey), 11% fat (soybean oil), 59% carbohydrates (starch + sucrose) and 10% cellulose was supplemented with either ginkgo biloba extract (diet E), or a cocktail of antioxidants comprising vitamine C, vhamine B, grape seed extract and cysteine (diet C) and/or L-camitine (diet D and F respectively). For caloric restriction (diet B) fat, starch and sucrose were reduced to provide 67% of the daily calorie consumption of the Ad-hb<br><br>
control group while providing 100% for proteins, minerals and vitamins. These diets are as follows:<br>
Diet A - Control: 18% proteuis (soy and whey), 11% fat, 59% carbohydrates, 5% cellulose.<br>
Diet B - Caloric restriction : 18% proteins (soy and whey), 7.7% fat, 32.5%<br>
carbohydrates, 5% cellulose<br>
Diet C - Coclctail of antioxidants : Diet A + 0.19% vit C, 0.03% vit E, 0.075%<br>
gTE^e seed extract, 0.4% cysteine.<br>
Diet D : Diet A + 0.3% L- carnitine + coclctail of antioxidants of diet C.<br>
Diet E : Diet A + 0.0375% Ginkgo biloba extract (Linnea)<br>
Diet F : Diet A + 0.3% L- carnitine<br>
•    RNA preparation:<br>
Mice were decapitated and dissected rapidly. Skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) were immeraed in RNAlatter (Ambion) and &amp;ozen at ~80°C until use. For RNA extraction, muscles were homogenized with ceramic beads (FastPrep, Q-Biogene) and the RNA extracted with Totally RNA kit (Ambion). The quahty of the RNA was checked by Agilent technology. RNA pools from four mice each were created and hybridized to Affymetrix Murine U74Av2 high-density ohgonucleotide micro arrays.<br>
Results<br>
As a first assessment, the five e^qjerimental diets were compared to the control diet and clustered (hierarchical clustering) using Spotfire. With this j^roach, differential geoe expression profiles indicate that (1) flie two diets containing L-camitine and caloric restriction belong to the same cluster (2) the diet containing both the antioxidant cocktail and L-camitine is the most similar to caloric restriction and (3) the antioxidant cocktail &amp; ginkgo form a separate group.<br>
Example 2: Dry pet food<br><br>
A feed mixture is made up of about 58% by weight of com, about 5.5% by weight of com gluten, about 22% by weight of chicken meal, 2,5% dried chicory, 1 % carnitine, and 1% creatine for stimulation of energy metabohsm, 0.1% VitC, vitE (150 lU / kg), 0.05%grape seed proanthocyanidin extract and 1% cysteine as antioxidant, salts, vitamins and minerals making up the remainder.<br>
The fed mixture is fed into a preconditioner and moistraied. The moistened feed is then fed into an extrader-cooker and gelatinised. The gelatinised matrix leaving the extruder is forced through a die and extruded. The extradate is cut into pieces suitable for feeding to dogs, dried at about 110°C for about 20 minutes, and cooled to form pellets.<br>
This dry dog food is able to improve or restore the age-related deficits m dogs.<br>
Example 3: Dry pet food<br>
A feed mixture is prepared as in example 1, using 2% carnitine for stimulation of energy metabohsm and 0.05% ginkgo biloba extract as antioxidant. Then, the fed mixture is processed as in example 1. The dry dog food is also particularly intended to improve or restore the age-related deficits in dogs.<br>
Example 4: Wet canned pet food<br>
A mixture is prepared from 73 % of poultry carcass, pig lungs and beef Uver (ground), 16 % of wheat floiu", 2 % of dyes, vitamins, and morganic salts, and 2 % of carnitine for stimulation of energy metabolism and 0.4 % green tea as antioxidant.<br>
This mixture is emulsified at 12°C and extmded in the form of a pudding which is then cooked at a temperature of 90°C. It is cooled to 30°C and cut in chunks. 45 % of diese chunks are mixed with 55 % of a sauce prepared from 98 Vo of water, 1 % of dye, and 1 % of guar gum. Tiaplate cans are filled and sterihzed at 125°Cfor40min.<br><br>
Example 5: Wet canned pet food<br>
A mixture is prepared from 56% of poultry carcass, pig lungs and pig liver (ground), 13% offish, 16% of wheat flour, 2% of plasma, 10.8% of water, 2.2% of dyes, 1% of semi refined kappa carrageenan, inorganic salts and 9% oil rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (olive oil) and 1 % creatine for stimulation of energy metabolism and 1 % taurine as antioxidant. This mixture is emulsified at 12°C and extruded in the form of a pudding which is then cooked at a temperature of 90°C. It is cooled to 30°C and cut in chunks.<br>
30% of these chunks (having a water content of 58%) is incorporated in a base prepared from 23% of poultry carcass, 1% of guar gum, 1% of dye and aroma and 75% of water. Tinplate cans are then filled and sterilized at 127 °C for 60 min.<br>
