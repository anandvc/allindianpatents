				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for batchwise heat treatment of goods to be<br>
annealed which are heated in a heating chamber after scavenging air with a<br>
scavenging gas under protective gas to a predetermined treatment temperature,<br>
with the protective gas being conveyed through the heating chamber depend-<br>
ing on the occurrence of impurities in different quantities.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Metal strips and wires are subjected to heat treatment under protective gas for<br>
recrystallization, which gas should especially prevent oxidation processes on<br>
the surface of the annealing good by atmospheric oxygen. The air is scavenged<br>
at first from the heating chamber by a non-combustible gas, preferably nitrogen,<br>
until the oxygen content has been decreased to a permissible maximum<br>
amount before the heat treatment is performed under a protective gas such as<br>
nitrogen or hydrogen. Since lubricant residues usually adhere to the annealing<br>
goods, said impurities are vaporized during a vaporization phase during the<br>
heating of the annealing good to the treatment temperature, with the vaporized<br>
impurities being diluted and scavenged by the protective gas conveyed through<br>
the heating chamber. For economic reasons, the quantity of the protective gas<br>
conveyed through the heating chamber is controlled depending on the respec-<br>
tive obtained quantity of vaporized impurities. The vaporized quantity of impuri-<br>
ties rapidly increases with the rise of the surface temperature of the annealing<br>
good, which is followed by a decrease again after the vaporization of the main<br>
quantity of impurities, despite rising surface temperatures. The progress of the<br>
-    2    -<br><br>
vaporized quantities of impurities over the vaporization phase determines the<br>
largest volume flow of protective gas through the heating chamber during the<br>
main occurrence of vaporizing impurities, with the quantity of shield gas con-<br>
veyed through the heating chamber being reducible with increasing reduction of<br>
vaporizing impurities and increasing dilution of the impurities in the protective<br>
gas, until towards the end of the heat treatment only a remainder of impurities<br>
is present in the heating chamber which no longer impairs the treatment of the<br>
annealing good, so that during the cooling of the annealing good it is only nec-<br>
essary to compensate a heat-induced decrease in volume in order to maintain<br>
a predetermined minimum pressure in the heating chamber. Despite this ad-<br>
justment of the quantity of protective gas conveyed through the heating cham-<br>
ber to the vaporization phase, the quantity of protective gas to be employed for<br>
each batch remains comparatively high.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is thus based on the object of providing a method of the kind<br>
mentioned above for the heat treatment of annealing goods in such a way that<br>
the quantity of protective gas required for each batch can be reduced.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention in such a way that the protective gas<br>
which is withdrawn from the heating chamber after the main occurrence of im-<br>
purities and which is loaded with a residual quantity of impurities is conveyed<br>
into the heating chamber, optionally after intermediate storage, during the main<br>
occurrence of impurities of a subsequent batch before non-loaded protective<br>
gas is introduced into the heating chamber.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that a respectively high degree of purity of<br>
the protective gas is only necessary at the end of the heat treatment of the an-<br>
nealing good, so that during the main occurrence of impurities protective gas<br>
loaded with such impurities can be conveyed through the heating chamber as<br>
long as the loading is limited and a sufficient dilution effect is ensured. For this<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
reason, the protective gas of a following batch which is withdrawn from the<br>
heating chamber after the main occurrence of the impurities and is loaded with<br>
a residual quantity of impurities can be conveyed during the main occurrence of<br>
impurities into the heating chamber again, so that a considerable portion of the<br>
otherwise discarded quantity of protective gas from a preceding batch can be<br>
used again and can replace a portion of the otherwise required non-loaded pro-<br>
tective gas without impairing the treatment of the annealing good. The non-<br>
loaded protective gas will only be used to an extent which at the end of the heat<br>
treatment allows a protective gas atmosphere which is substantially free from<br>
impurities, as is also present in conventional heat treatments. In order to enable<br>
the use of the protective gas which is drawn off during the heat treatment of a<br>
batch and is loaded with limited residual content of impurities for the heat<br>
treatment of a subsequent batch, the protective gas withdrawn from a heating<br>
chamber can be introduced into a further parallel heating chamber which is op-<br>
erated in a time-staggered manner concerning charging however. It is under-<br>
stood that it is also possible to intermediately store the protective gas with-<br>
drawn from a heating chamber, which ensures the guidance of the protective<br>
gas in accordance with the invention when only one single heating chamber is<br>
provided and makes the charging of several heating chambers independent<br>
from each other in a temporal respect.<br>
Similarly, the scavenging gas which towards the end of the scavenging process<br>
is still loaded with a residual quantity of oxygen can be used during a following<br>
batch. For the use of said scavenging gas with a residual load of impurities dur-<br>
ing a following batch it will depend on whether or not the scavenging gas is also<br>
used as a protective gas. When nitrogen is used as a scavenging and protec-<br>
tive gas, the scavenging gas withdrawn from the heating chamber can also be<br>
introduced into the heating chamber during the heat treatment following the<br>
scavenging process in the case of a respectively low contamination by a resid-<br>
ual content of oxygen, which is not possible in the case of different gases for<br>
scavenging and heat treatment.<br>
-    4    «<br><br>
Since the occurrence of impurities decreases asymptotically in the discharge<br>
section of the vaporization phase during the heat treatment of annealing goods<br>
with surface impurities, an average contamination is obtained for the intermedi-<br>
ately stored protective gas which is withdrawn from the heating chamber, which<br>
contamination must be upwardly limited in view of the conditions in the heating<br>
chamber during the vaporization phase. To ensure that a predetermined upper<br>
limit value can be maintained in a simple manner, the protective or scavenging<br>
gas which is loaded with impurities can be intermediately stored once its per-<br>
centage of impurities falls below an upper threshold value, which lies 10% over<br>
the average percentage of contaminations of the intermediate protective or<br>
scavenging gas.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The method in accordance with the invention is now explained in closer detail<br>
by reference to the drawing, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an installation for the heat treatment of annealing goods accord-<br>
ing to the method in accordance with the invention in a schematic block<br>
diagram;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the temperature curve of the annealing good over the treatment<br>
time on its surface and in its interior and the occurring percentage of va-<br>
porizing impurities, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows the demand for protective gas occurring during the treatment time.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In accordance with Fig. 1, heating chambers 1 are provided for the heat treat-<br>
ment of annealing goods such as metal strip or metal wire bunches, which<br>
heating chambers are charged in batches with the annealing goods. Said heat-<br>
ing chambers 1 which are formed by hood-type annealing furnaces for example<br>
are connected in the conventional manner to a protective gas feed line 2 and a<br>
protective gas discharge line 3. Moreover, a discharge gas line 4 is provided<br>
-    5    -<br><br>
through which a storage reservoir 5 can be loaded, with the help of a compres-<br>
sor 6 according to the embodiment. The storage reservoir is unloaded via a line<br>
7 which is connected to the heating chambers 1 and which is connected via a<br>
device 8 for pressure regulation with the storage reservoir 5.<br>
When the annealing goods are heated in the respective heating chambers 1 af-<br>
ter the scavenging process with the help of scavenging gas under protective<br>
gas atmosphere, a temperature curve T1 is obtained on the surface of the an-<br>
nealing good according to Fig. 2. Curve T2 indicates the temperature curve in<br>
the interior of the annealing good. As a result of the surface heating of the an-<br>
nealing good, lubricant residues adhering to the surface will evaporate, with the<br>
vaporizing quantities of impurities increasing strongly with the surface tempera-<br>
ture T1 according to curve 9 which indicates the quantities of impurities vapor-<br>
izing during a vaporization phase 10, which then drops due to the increasing<br>
cleaning of the surface and approaches a negligible residual value. This means<br>
that in the area of the main occurrence of vaporizing impurities, the largest<br>
quantity of protective gas needs to be conveyed through the heating chambers<br>
1 in order to ensure scavenging and thus a dilution of the impurities. Fig. 3 indi-<br>
cates the respectively required quantity of scavenging gas through the stepped<br>
curve 11. Section a corresponds to the largest demand for protective gas dur-<br>
ing the main occurrence of vaporizing impurities. Since said main occurrence of<br>
impurities does not need to be diluted and scavenged by non-loaded protective<br>
gas from the protective gas line 2, protective gas from storage reservoir 5 is<br>
used. This pre-loaded protective gas which is additionally loaded with the main<br>
occurrence of impurities, is drawn off from the heating chamber 1 and is re-<br>
jected or combusted if it concerns a combustible protective gas. Following sec-<br>
tion a, the heating chamber 1 is supplied with non-loaded protective gas from<br>
the protective gas line 2 during the sections b and c in order to ensure a re-<br>
spective cleaning of the protective gas atmosphere within the heating cham-<br>
bers 1 when the heat treatment is interrupted and the cooling phase is initiated.<br>
Since the loading of the protective gas with vaporized impurities decreases with<br>
decreasing occurrence of the vaporizing impurities according to the decreasing<br>
-   6    -<br><br>
branch of curve 9, the protective gas which is withdrawn from the heating<br>
chamber 1 and which is loaded only slightly with vaporized impurities can be in-<br>
termediately stored for later use during the main occurrence of vaporizing impu-<br>
rities in a following batch. For this purpose, said protective gas is supplied via<br>
line 4 to the compressor 6 for loading the storage reservoir 5. An average load-<br>
ing of the protective gas by the vaporized impurities is obtained in storage res-<br>
ervoir 5 due to the vaporization rate which decreases during the expiry of the<br>
vaporization phase 10. To ensure that this average value beneath a predeter-<br>
mined limit value can be maintained, the gas withdrawal from the heating<br>
chambers 1 via line 4 can start when the loading of the withdrawn protective<br>
gas falls below an upper limit value m which lies 10% above the average share<br>
of impurities of the protective gas which is intermediately stored in storage res-<br>
ervoir 5. The loaded protective gas from the storage reservoir 5 can then be<br>
used for the start of the vaporization phase 10 of a subsequent batch, namely<br>
in the region of sections d and a of the curve 11. Once the upper limit value m<br>
for the loading of the protective gas to be withdrawn is reached during the va-<br>
porization phase 10 at time t1, the protective gas quantity indicated in Fig. 3<br>
with the hatching can be stored in storage reservoir 5.<br>
When a combustible protective gas such as hydrogen is used as a protective<br>
gas, the air cannot be scavenged from the heating chambers 1 before each<br>
annealing. Instead it is necessary to use a non-combustible scavenging gas. In<br>
Fig. 3, said use of scavenging gas is indicated by curve 12. Similarly, the com-<br>
bustible scavenging gas must be scavenged with the help of a non-combustible<br>
scavenging gas prior to the venting of the heating chambers 1 at the end of the<br>
cooling phase, as is indicated with curve 13. Fig. 1 shows the scavenging gas<br>
feed line with reference numeral 14. The discharge of the scavenging gas is<br>
made via line 15.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment.<br>
The provision of a storage reservoir 5 could be omitted when charging the heat-<br>
ing chambers 1 occurs in a time-staggered manner in such a way that the pro-<br>
-    7    -<br><br>
tective gas quantity withdrawn from time t1 from one of the heating chambers 1<br>
is supplied to the other heating chamber 1, namely during the main occurrence<br>
of the vaporizing impurities, so that the required protective gas quantity in the<br>
sections d and a of Fig. 3 can be covered at least partly by the protective gas<br>
quantity withdrawn from the respectively other heating chamber 1.<br>
It is also possible that the scavenging gas used according to curves 12 and 13<br>
is partly re-used again when said scavenging gases from the heating chamber<br>
1 have a respectively low percentage of impurities which are determined when<br>
scavenging the air by atmospheric oxygen and when scavenging the protective<br>
gas by the protective gas. The scavenging gas which is loaded to an only com-<br>
paratively low extent can be used advantageously during one of the following<br>
batches at the beginning of the scavenging processes. If the scavenging gas<br>
corresponds to the protective gas, then it is understood that it is also possible<br>
that the scavenging gas loaded only marginally with impurities is also used dur-<br>
ing the heat treatment under protective gas atmosphere in the described man-<br>
ner.<br>
