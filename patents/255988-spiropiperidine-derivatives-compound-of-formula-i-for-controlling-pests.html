SPIROPIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES FOR CONTROLLING PESTS<br>
The present invention relates to hetero-spiroindoline derivatives to processes for preparing them to insecticidal acaricidal molluscicidal and nematicidal compositions comprising them and to methods of using them to combat and control insect acarine mollusc and nematode pests.<br>
Aza-spiroindolines with pharmaceutical properties are disclosed in for example WO02/94825 and WO00/27845. Synthetic routes to selected compounds are described for instance in Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters (1995) 5 1875 and Tetrahedron Letters (2001) 42 999.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that certain hetero-spiroindolines have insecticidal properties.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method of combating and controlling insects acarines nematodes or molluscs which comprises applying to a pest to a locus of a pest or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest an insecticidally acaricidally nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I);<br><br>

The compounds of the invention may be made in a variety of ways. For example as shown in Scheme I.<br>
SCHEME I<br><br>
Thus a compound of formula 1 may be synthesised from compounds of formula 2 by reaction with an alkylating agent of the formula R8-L where L is chloride bromide iodide or a sulfonate (e.g. mesylate or tosylate) or similar leaving group at a temperature of between ambient temperature and 100°C typically 65°C in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane chloroform or 1 2-dichloroethane in the presence of a tertiary amine base<br><br>
such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine and optionally catalysed by halide salts such as sodium iodide potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide.<br>
Alternatively a compound of formula 2 may be reacted with an aldehyde of the formula RCHO at a temperature between ambient temperature and 100°C in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or ethanol or mixtures of solvents in the presence of a reducing agent such as borane-pyridine complex sodium borohydride sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride sodium cyanoborohydride or such like to produce a compound of formula 1 where R8 is CH2-R.<br>
Alternatively a compound of formula 2 maybe reacted with paraformaldehyde and a boronic acid of the formula R-B(OH)2 at a temperature between ambient temperature and 100°C in an organic solvent such as ethanol 1 4-rdioxane or water to produce a compound of formula 1 where R8 is CH2-R.<br>
A compound of formula 2 may be obtained from a compound of formula 3 by reaction with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid at ambient temperature in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane chloroform or 1 2-dichloroethane followed by neutralisation of the reaction mixture with an aqueous solution of an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate sodium bicarbonate or similar compound.<br>
Compounds of formula 3 may be obtained from compounds of formula 4 by reaction with a suitable electrophilic species. Compounds of formula 3 where Y is a carbonyl group may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 4 with a carboxylic acid derivative of formula R1-C(0)-Z where Z is chloride hydroxy alkoxy or acyloxy at a temperature between 0°C and 150°C optionally in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane chloroform or 1 2-dichloroethane optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine and optionally in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Compounds of formula 3 where Y is a carbonyl group and Rl is an amino substituent of formula R'-NH- may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 4 with an isocyanate of formula R'-N=C=0 under similar conditions. Compounds of formula 3 where Y is a group of formula S(0)q maybe formed from compounds of formula 4 by treatment with compounds of formula of Rl-S(0)q-Cl under similar conditions. Compounds of formula 3 where Y is a thiocarbonyl group and Rl is an amino substituent of formula R'-NH- may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 3 with an isothiocyanate of formula R*-N=C=S under similar conditions. Alternatively compounds of<br><br>
formula 3 where Y is a thiocarbonyl group and Rl is a carbon substituent may be formed by treatment of compounds of formula 3 where Y is a carbonyl group and Rl is a carbon substituent with a suitable thionating agent such as Lawesson's reagent.<br>
In the above procedures acid derivatives of the formula Rl -C(0)-Z -isocyanates of formula R'-N=C=0 isothiocyanates of formula R'-N=C=S and sulfur electrophiles of formula Rl -S(0)q-Cl are either known compounds or may be formed from known compounds by known methods by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula 4 maybe obtained from compounds of formula 5 by reaction with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium-tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride or similar hydrides or alkoxyhydrides in an organic solvent such as in dioxane or at temperature of between 100°C and 125°C following the procedure described in WO-0027845.<br>
Compounds of formula 5 may be obtained from compounds of formula 6 following the procedure described in WO00/27845.<br>
Compounds of formula 6 maybe obtained following the procedure described by Bremner etal. in Synthesis 1991 528.<br>
Compounds of formula 5 and 6 are either known compounds or may be formed from known compounds by known methods by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Certain compounds of formula 2 3 and 4 are novel compounds and as such form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Alternatively compounds of formula 1 may be made by the reactions summarised in Scheme II<br>

In order to apply a compound of formula (I) as an insecticide acaricide nematicide or molluscicide to a pest a locus of pest or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest a compound of formula (I) is usually formulated into a composition which includes in addition to the compound of formula (I) a suitable inert diluent or carrier and optionally a surface active agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals which are able to modify the properties of an interface (for example liquid/solid liquid/air or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion emulsification and wetting). It is preferred that all compositions (both solid and liquid formulations) comprise by weight 0.0001 to 95% more preferably I to 85% for example 5 to 60% of a compound of formula (I).

Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients which have significantly different physical chemical or biological properties such that they do not easily lend themselves to the same conventional formulation type. In these circumstances other formulation types may be prepared. For example where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a water insoluble liquid it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) formulation.<br><br>

Step A: 2-Chloro-4-amino-pyridine was brominated according to the method described in Synthesis 2001 14&gt; 2175-2179: a solution of 4-chloro-4-amino-pyridine (12.3 g) in acetonitrile (500 ml) was treated with N-bromosuccinimide (17.8 g) and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The solution was then concentrated in vacuo and the residue subjected to silica gel chromatography (cyclohexane:ethyl acetate 8:2) to afford 3-bromo-2-chloro-4-aminopyridine (12.2 g m.p. 146°C (hexane/ether)) and 5-bromo-2-chIoro-4-aminopyridine (2.9 g m. p. 117-119°C).<br>
Step B: Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (1M solution in THF 5.1 ml) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 3-bromo-2-chloro-4-aminopyridine (1.04 g) in tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) at -78°C under N2. The resulting solution was then stirred at room temperature for 30 min. warmed to 0°C then cooled again at -78°C. 4-Chloromethyl-3 6- . dihydro-2H-pyridine-l-carboxy!ic acid tert-butyl ester (1.16 g prepared according to WO 98/25605) dissolved in a minimum volume of THF was added dropwise then the solution<br><br>
was refluxed for 14 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature poured into diluted aqueous ammonium chloride extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (CH2CI2 then CH2Cl2/EtOAc 8:2 cyclohexane:ethyl acetate 8:2) to afford 4-[(3-bromo-2-chloro-pyridin-4-ylamino)-methyl]-3 6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (1.42 g) which was identified by its mass and 1H NMR spectra. MS (ES+) 346/348/350 (MH+-isoprene) 402/404/406 (MH+). .<br>
Step C: Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (1M solution in THF 3 ml) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 4-[(3-Bromo-2-chloro-pyridin-4-ylamino)-methyl]-3 6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-l-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (0.53 g) in tetrahydrofuran (20ml) at -78°C under N2. The yellow solution was warmed to 0°C and then 2-chloroisonicotinoyl chloride (50% solution in toluene 0.95 g) was added. The solution was stirred at 0°C for 10<br>
*<br>
min. quenched by addition of aqueous ammonium chloride extracted with EtOAc dried (Na2S04) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (CH2C12 then CH2Cl2/EtOAc 8:2 cyclohexane:ethyl acetate 8:2) to afford 4-{[(3-bromo-2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-(2-chloro-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-amino]-methyl}-3 6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (0.63 g) which was identified by its mass and 1H NMR spectra. MS (ES+) 443/445 (MH+-BOC) 484/486 (MH+-isoprene).<br>
Step D: In a dried argon purged flask 4-{[(3-bromo-2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-(2-chloro-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-amino]-methyl}-3 6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-l-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester obtained in Step C (0.63 g) was dissolved in dimethylacetamide (10 ml); triethylamine (0.41 ml) tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.40 g) and palladium(II) acetate (40 mg) were successively added and the solution was heated at 90°C for 18 hours. After cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was diluted with diethyl ether washed with brine dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography of the residue (cyclohexane:ethyl acetate 8:2) afforded l-(2-chloro-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-spiro[[(4-chloro-2 3-dihydro-lH-pym&gt;lo[3 2^<br>
carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (0.21 g) which was identified by its mass and 1H NMR spectra. MS (ES+) 461/463 (MH+).<br>
Step E: l-(2»chloro-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-spiro[[(4-chloro-2 3-dihydro-lH-pyrrolo[3 2-c]pyridine)-3 4 -(r 2%3\4 -tetrahydropyridine)]-r carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester obtained in Step D (0.19 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (13 ml) and treated<br><br>
successively with triethylsilane (0.33 ml) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.63 ml); the solution was stirred under argon for 8 hours diluted with dichloromethane neutralised with aqueous sodium bicarbonate dried (sodium sulphate) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in acetonitrile (13 ml) and treated with diisopropylethylamine (0.12 ml) and 4-chlorocinnamyl chloride (84 mg) for 48 hours at room temperature. Standard aqueous workup afforded a residue which was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel cyclohexanerethyl acetate 8:2+ 0.5 % triethylamine) to give the title product (43 mg) as a colourless solid. M.p. 95-96°C; MS (ES+) 513/515 (M+H+).<br>
