				<td>Pyrrolidone-Carboxylic Modified Polysiloxanes Having Aqueous and Detergent Solubilities and Water-In-Oil Emulsion Capability<br>
[0001] The present invention recognizes the properties of 2-pyrrolidone-4-carboxylic substituted polysiloxanes can be dramatically altered by increasing the presence of the carboxylic-substituted pyrrolidone monomer portion-of the polysiloxane, such that the resultant amidopolysiloxane has an acid equivalent weight of about 300-3,000 daltons and a molecular weight Mw of about 1,000-60,000 daltons resulting in enhanced detergent and water solubilities and the ability to form water-in-oil emulsions.<br>
[0002] OrganosiUcone fluids, including polydimethylsiloxanes, have a wide variety of properties including lubricity, water repellency, permeability to gases, dielectric properties, low surface tension and resistance to high temperatures, weathering and oxidation. Consequently, silicone fluids are found in a wide number of commercial products including lubricants, coolants, protective coatings, water repellents, surfactants, wetting agents, anti-foaming agents for liquids, brake fluids, personal care and other cosmetic products, adhesives, dielectric fluids, textile finishes, polishes, mold release agents, sealants and rust preventatives. [0003] Although silicone fluids tend to be soluble in a wide variety of polar organic oils and solvents, they are not water-miscible or -soluble nor fully detergent soluble resulting in transparent formulations. However, there are numerous means for modifying the silicone backbone (copolymerization) to enhance its hydrophilicity and/or lipophilic properties. Examples include modifying the silicone backbone to modifiy its interactions between the oil and water phases with the addition of: (Cj-CaJalkoxyalkylene moieties, e.g., —(CH^a-ECv-POp-OH; (C2-C3)alkoxylenealipnatic hydrocarbon moieties, e.g., —KCH2)n-BOm-POp-(CH2)x-CH3; or an aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g., —(CHj)x-CH3; where n, m, p and x refer to the number of indicated substituents and are preferably integers up to about SO. The ethylene oxide moieties tend to increase hydrophilicity, the propylene oxide moieties tend to increase or balance the hydrophobicity and aliphatic hydrocarbons tend to increase hydrophobicity and can also be used to solidify the siloxane. However, the copolymerization of the silicone with ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy moieties essentially dilutes the silicone effect provided by the siloxane polymer backbone.<br>
[0004] Organosilicones having carboxyl substituted pyrrolidone group or an amidoamine derivative thereof are disclosed as part of a broad group of organosilicones in U.S. 5,596,061. However, these compositions do not directly exhibit water compatibility or detergent solubility (col. 1, lines 31-42). To obtain water solubility requires a further reaction to prepare, for example, a silicone-containing phospholipid (col. 1, lines 38-42). However, Monasil PLN phospholipid silicone, commercially available from Uniqema, New Castle', Delaware, USA, is a twenty-five weight percent concentrate in water which is a translucent two-phase dispersion.<br><br>
[0005] For the purposes of this invention, molecular weight MB is the mean number average polymer weight measured by gel permeation dhromatography (GPC). Molecular weight Mw is the mean polymer weight average of the polymer as estimated by correlation to polydimethylsiloxane fluid viscosity, an industry accepted technique. Total Acid Number is the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) required to neutralize the acid groups in a gram of the polymer. Acid Equivalent Weight is the mass of polymer containing one mole of acid groups expressed as grams/mole and is that amount which would combine with one mole of potassium hydroxide. Detergent includes surfactants, surface active argents and combinations thereof. Dispersion, or detergent dispersible, refers to a two phase system where the polysiloxane is in a separate phase from the water phase and the dispersion is not «fcar. Detergent solubility refers to a composition where inclusion of the carboxy pyrrolidone anoidopolysiloxanes of this invention forms a clear system in the presence of water and a detergent. Descriptions of detergents (surfactants and surface agents) are provided infra. Water solidbility refers to a composition where the carboxy pyrrolidone amidopolysiloxanes of this invention are sufficiently ionized to form a clear system hi an aqueous system, without the presence of detergent.<br>

(Figure Remove)<br><br>
[0006] The 2-pyrrolidone-4-carboxylic substituted polysiloxanes composition of the present invention, also referred to as amidopolysiloxames, is represented by a random polymer of Formula 1 comprising: (Table Remove)<br><br><br>
D is oxygen or nitrogen, wherein at least 50% on a molar basis of D is oxygen;<br>
R5 is hydrogen, (Q-Ca) alkyl or poIyoxy(Cr-C3)alkylene of 2 to 200 units, wherein <br>
at least<br>
50% on a molar basis of Rsis bydrogen . x is 1 or 2;<br>
R6 is branched or unbranched (Ci.2o)alkyl; each R2, which can be independently the same or different, is selected from (C1-C4)alkyl,<br>
phenyl or -OR7 wherein R'is bydrogen or lower (Chalky!, wherein collectively<br>
R2 is substantially capped moieties;<br><br>
each R3, which can be independently the same or different, is selected from (Q-Q) alley!<br>
or.pbenyl;<br>
each R4, which can be independently the same or different, is selected from phenyl, (C|.M)alkyl, (Ci.3«)alkenyl, and/or (C|^o)alkyl-capped or uncapped polyoxy(C2-C3)alkylene of 2 to 200 units; a is an integer from 10 to 560;<br>
b is an integer from 1 to 40, wherein the absolute ratio of a to b is about 2.5 to about 35 and wherein the average integer sum of a+b exists in the range of 11 to 600 and preferably about 50 to about 400 and more preferably from about 150 to about 350;<br>
c is an integer from 0 to 10, wherein the absolute ratio of b to c is no less than about 4. [0008] As known by those familiar with silicone chemistry, the distribution of a, b and c polymer subunits of Formula 1 are randomly arranged, hence termed a random polymer. The carboxy pyrrolidone structure of Formula 1 is primarily obtained from the reaction of a pendant primary amine source and itaconic acid or ester. As such, a portion of R1 can be a primary amine (-R*-NHj), essentially an unreacted by-product that may or may not be desired in the final product. [0009] The term capped in reference to R2 is where a silicone-carbon bond exists which is not readily hydrolyzed. Similarly, the term uncapped refers to R2 when it is -OR7, since it can be reacted or hydrolyzed or can bond to substrates or increase the polymer molecular weight by condensation. R2 is preferably substantially alkyl-capped. The terms uncapped or alky] capped in reference to the polyoxyalkylenes of R4 refers to the polyoxyalkylene chain ending in -OH (uncapped) or continues with an ether linkage (capped). [0010] Another aspect of Formula 1 comprises amidopolysiloxanes where: R1, thepyrrolidone-containing functional group, D is oxygen;<br>
R5 is hydrogen, (CpQ) alkyl or a polyoxy (CVCs) alkylene of 1 to 6 units, wherein at least 50% on a molar basis of R5 is hydrogen. R6 is a branched or unbranched (C3-C4) alkyl; each R2 is selected from methyl, phenyl, -OR1 where R7 is methyl, ethyl or<br>
hydrogen and collectively R2 is substantially capped moieties; each R3 is selected from methyl or phenyl; each R4 is selected from phenyl, methyl, (Ci.M)alkyl, or (Ci.2o)alkyl-capped or<br>
uncapped polyoxy(C2-Cj)alkylene of 1 to 30 units; a is an integer from 10 to 560;<br><br>
b is an integer from 1 to 40, wherein the absolute ratio of a to b is about 2.5 to about 35, with a preferred ratio of 20-26;<br>
and the average integer sum of a+b exists in the range 11 to 600 and preferably about 11 to about 400, and more preferably from about 150 to about 350; and<br>
c is an integer from 0 to 10,<br>
wherein the absolute ratio of b to c is no less than about 4. [0011] Another aspect of Formula 1 comprises amidopolysiloxanes where:<br>
R2 is methyl; R3 is methyl; R5 is hydrogen; D is oxygen; R* is propyl or isobutyl;<br>
a is an integer from 10 to 560; b is an integer from 1 to 40, wherein the absolute ratio of a to b is about 2.5 to about 35, and the average integer sum of a+b exists in the range of about 11 to about 400, more preferably from about 150 to about 350; and c is 0.<br>
[0012] The amidopolysiloxane compositions of the present invention will have a molecular weight average Mw of about 1,000-60,000 daltons and an acid equivalent weight of about 300-3,000 daltons. By varying these parameters within these ranges, a variety of properties related to detergent solubility, water solubility, and the ability to form water-in-oil emulsions can be affected. At times, neutralization of a portion or all of the carboxyl groups of the 2-pyrrolidone containing polysiloxane will be necessary to obtain some of these properties. These properties, in turn, provide for a variety of physical forms of the amidopolysiloxanes of Formula 1 conducive to various uses, for example, cleaning, lubrication, personal care products such as shampoos, conditioners, lotions, creams, soaps, body washes and antiperspirants. [0013] These 2-pyrrolidone-carboxylic modified polysiloxanes have the capability to (a) be compatible in hydrocarbon and silicon oils; (b) act as emulsifiers and enable an aqueous solution to be readily dispersed in an oil phase containing silicone or hydrocarbon oils or mixtures thereof as a water-in-oil emulsion: (c) readily compatible in detergents and aqueous solutions and (d) place the 2-pyrrolidone containing polysiloxane into a physical form that allow for its incorporation into a variety of vehicles providing desirable characteristics to cleansers, hair conditioners, shampoos, lotions, creams, antiperspirants, other skin and scalp care products and cosmetics, lubricants, polishes and sealants.<br>
[0014] The carboxyl functional amidopolysiloxanes and their corresponding ester and amide derivatives of the present invention can be prepared by techniques known in the art See, for example, U.S. 6,228,967. For example, a corresponding aminopolysilicone compositions or fluids of the Formula 1, but where R1 is -R6NH2, is reacted with up to about one equivalent, preferably about stoichiometric quantities, of itaconic acid or its ester per functional primary amine group(s) at an elevated temperature for the time sufficient for substantially all of the itaconic acid or its ester to react with the functional primary amine group(s). In general, from at least about 0.5,<br><br>
preferably from about 0.9 to about 1.1 equivalents of itaconic acid or its ester per functional primary amine group is reacted with the silicone fluid wherein substantially all the itaconic acid and preferably all the functional primary amine group(s) is reacted resulting in the formation of amidopolysiloxanes of Formula 1. The aminopolysilicone starting materials are commercially obtainable.<br>
[0015] The reaction can be carried out neat or in an inert solvent such as a lower alkyl alcohol such as isopropanol (IPA), hydrocarbon solvent, or a silicone solvent, preferably cosmetically acceptable (described below) as desired, at elevated temperature up to about 175°C, preferably from about 90°C to about 130°C for about one to five hours, preferably two to three hours. The reaction readily proceeds and generally a substantially complete reaction of the itaconic acid or its ester with the available functional primary amine group(s) occurs via the Michael addition reaction of the double bond of the itaconic acid followed by immediate cyclization to form a pyrrolidone group. Routine analytical techniques for amine and acid values as well as monitoring water and/or alcohol evolution are used to determine completion of the reaction. [0016]   Itaconic acid (tnethylene succinic acid) or its ester derivative is a compound of the formula: CH2 = C(COOR9)CH2COOR9 wherein R9 which can be the same or different, is hydrogen or lower alkyl (1-6 carbon atoms). The compound itaconic acid is available commercially from Rhone Pouleuc and Pfizer Chemicals Division whereas ester derivatives thereof are available.from Morflex Inc., Greensboro, N.C. The compounds are produced by known fermentation techniques although chemical synthesis methods are also known. [0017] As the polysiloxane amine starting materials are reacted with itaconic acid to form the compositions of the present invention, the viscosity of the desired product is usually several times greater. At times, this results in compositions that are much too viscous (about 1,000,000 cPs (centipoises) or greater measured by Brookfield LVT viscometer using a spindle 4) to easily handle or to readily disperse or solubilize. Consequently, in those instances where the viscosity of the final product is too great, it is desired that the polysiloxane amine starting material be dissolved in a solvent and the reaction with the itaconic acid be carried out in the presence of the solvent at a temperature of from about 90°C to 12S°C, preferably 100°C to 115°C to preferably obtain substantially complete reaction of the amine groups, generally a period of about one to five hours, preferably two to three hours. It is preferred to choose solvents or combination of solvents, particularly polar solvents, with boiling or reflux points at or near the preferred reaction temperature of 90-110°C. The reaction rate can be enhanced by the use of a sealed reactor to complete the reaction using a low boiling point (less than about 90°C at atmospheric pressure) at elevated pressure in relation to ambient pressure. Polar solvents, such as (Q-Cis) alkyl esters of lower (C|-Q) alcohols in combination with lower (Cj to Q) alcohols, and mixtures thereof, are<br><br>
preferred since they facilitate a higher reaction temperature at ambient pressure, which will enhance the reaction rate and degree of reaction.<br>
[0018] The lower (C|-Q) alcohols are commonly used as a solvent for itaconic acid; however, their presence in the final product is often not desired, as the alcohol's concentration increases, it is more apt to break an emulsion to which the final amidopolysiloxane is an ingredient. The (Q-Qj) alkyl esters of lower (C|-Q) alcohols, although, not known as solvents for itaconic acid are compatible with the lower alcohol and the desired amidopolysiloxane. Thus, the mixture of the lower alcohol and the alkyl esters of lower alcohols allows a reduction in the presence of the alcohol in the final product, enhances the reaction rate and, often, the amidopolysiloxane is less viscous than when only an alcohol is used as the solvent. Generally, the ratio of the (Q-Cig) alkyl esters of (Ci-Q) alcohols to (Q-Q) alcohols will be from 1:1 to 10:1 by weight. When isopropyl alcohol, a common solvent for both itaconic acid and silicone fluids, is used preferred alkyl esters of alcohols include isopropyl myristate ester, isopropyl palmitate ester and isopropyl laurate ester. [0019] Suitable solvents, oils, diluents and diluent oils for the amidopolysUoxanes of Formula 1 can be selected from a broad range of silicones, organo-modified silicones and/or hydrocarbon oils. Examples include isoparaffinic oils such as IsoparM (available from ExxonMobil); (Q-C|8) alkyl esters of (Q- Q) alcohols, for example, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate and isopropyl laurate; dimethicones having cyclomethicones and cycloalkyldimethicones such as cyclotetradimethicone, cyclopentadimethicone cylcohexadimethicone and cycloheptadimethicone, wherein the dimethicone, cyclo methicones and cycloalkylmethicones have kinematic viscosity of less than about 20 centistokes; liquid triglycerides such as corn oil, canola oil; emollients, for example, squalenes; (Cj-Ci^alkyl alcohols including propanol, and isopropanol, and other cosmetically acceptable oils, wherein the 2-pyrrolidone-carboxylic containing polysiloxane preferably has a solubility of at least 50 grams (g) per 100 grams of solvent at room temperature. This reaction mixture can be further post-blended with compatible oils, if required. When using the oil as a solvent for the preparation of the amidopolysiloxanes of Formula 1, the temperature should generally not exceed the temperature at which the oil undergoes chemical and physical degradation which is preferably not greater than about 120° C (at atmospheric pressure). [0020] Of the solvents, oils and diluents useful for a particular amidopolysiloxane of the present invention, the ones yielding the lowest viscosity and of the most common use for the particular desired end use application are preferred.<br>
[0021] The variations in properties of the 2-pyrrolidone containing polysiloxanes occur over a continuum of the ranges where a is an integer from 10 to 560; b is an integer from 1 to 40, the absolute ratio of a to b is about 2.5 to about 35 and the average integer sum of a+b exists in the range of 11 to 600. When it is desired for the amidopolysiloxane to have water-soluble properties<br><br>
or to be used in a cleansing formulation (detergent soluble), then the amidopolysiloxane requires at<br>
least partial neutralization of the carboxylic groups with a suitable base.<br>
[0022] Generally, the amidopolysiloxanes of Formula 1 which are detergent soluble will have an<br>
absolute a to b ratio of about 2.5 - 35 with from 1-100 percent on a molar basis of the carboxyl<br>
groups are neutralized rendering the polymer composition detergent soluble. The clarity of the<br>
amidopolysiloxane of the present invention is affected by the amount of reaction by-products in<br>
the random polymer. In the instance of pure random polymer composition of Formula 1, the<br>
detergent solubility is expected to be up to about 50 percent (weight/weight) for a suitably chosen<br>
detergent.<br>
[0023] The detergent soluble property will be more evident when the following composition is<br>
prepared, comprising:<br>
i) 90-99.9% by weight of a detergent system where such a system can be selected from a wide range of anionic, cationic, non-ionic, amphoteric surfactants that singularly or in combination form a single clear phase in water. Descriptions of detergents are provided infra. The surfactant(s) are about 5% to 50% by weight of the system;<br>
ii) about 0.1 to 10 weight percent of the amidopolysiloxane of Formula 1, preferably 0.5 to 5 weight percent wherein a is an integer from 10 to 560; b is an integer from 1 to 40, the absolute ratio of a to b is about 2.5 to about 35, preferably about 13 - 33, more preferably about 20-26; and<br>
iii) an organic or inorganic base, as described in more detail below, sufficient to neutralize 1% to 100%, preferably greater than 50%, on a molar basis of the carboxyl groups of the amidopolysiloxane. The amount of neutralization depends on the alkalinity or pH of the detergent system prior to amidopolysiloxane addition and the absolute ratio of a to b of the carboxylic containing polymer, which relates to the polarity of the polymer. The solution pH will be about 3.5-11; and preferably about 4.5-8.<br>
[0024] Examples of specific uses are: cleansers including shampoos, body washes, soaps, facial washes, hygiene washes, and wipes; as a spreading and wetting agents; and emulsion polymerization.<br>
[0025] Generally, the amidopolysiloxanes of Formula 1 which are water soluble will have an absolute a to b ratio of about 2.5 -13 with from 50 -100 percent, preferably greater than 75 percent, on a molar basis of the carboxyl groups are neutralized rendering the polymer composition water soluble. The water solubility .of the amidopolysiloxane of the present invention is affected by the amount of reaction by-products in the random polymer of Formula 1. In the instance of a pure random polymer of Formula 1, the water solubility is expected to be up to about 40-50 weight/weight percent of water.<br><br>
[0026] The aqueous soluble property will be more evident when the following composition is prepared comprising:<br>
i) 90-99.9% by weight of a clear aqueous system comprised primarily of water and other optional water soluble additives;<br>
ii) about 0.1 to 10 weight percent of the amidopolysiloxane of Formula 1, preferably 0.5 to 5 weight percent, where specifically a is an integer from 10 to 560; b is an integer from 1 to 40, the absolute ratio of a to b is about 2.5 to about 13; and<br>
iii) an organic or inorganic base, as described in more detail below, sufficient to neutralize 50% to 100% on a molar basis of the carboxyl groups of the amidopolysiloxane. The amount of neutralization depends on the alkalinity or pH of the aqueous system before amidopolysiloxane polymer addition and the absolute ratio, a to b, of the carboxylic containing polymer, which relates to the polarity of the polymer.<br>
[0027] Examples of specific uses for the aqueous soluble product are: aqueous spreading and wetting agents; paper and textile treatment; and skin and hair conditioning preparations. [0028] Neutralization refers to forming the ionized carboxylic acid group as opposed to the protonated form of the carboxylic acid and is accomplished by addition of organic or inorganic bases and/or their salts, representing a wide spectrum of assorted monovalent, divalent and/or polyvalent species. Examples include alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, aluminium . hydroxide, alkali earth metal hydroxides such as calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide,   • alkanolamines such as MEA (monoethanolamine), DEA (diethanolamine) or TEA (triethylethanolamine), other amines such as silicone amines, lauryl amine and (Ce-C^) aliphatic amines and product mixtures that contain excess alkalinity from one or more bases in this list. The base is added in an amount sufficient to solubilize the amidopolysiloxane into a clear formulation or an enhanced emulsification stability. Generally, complete neutralization will require a pH of about 6.5. When the formulation or composition into which the amidopolysiloxane is being added has a pH of greater than neutral to about 12, self-neutralization may occur. The ultimate pH is dependent upon the desired use of the formulation.<br>
[0029] Generally, it was found that by neutralizing the carboxylic groups it imparted foaming and enhanced (a) water solubility or (b) detergent solubility. When the amidopolysiloxanes were not neutralized, they exhibited the expectant anti-foaming characteristics of silicones. [0030] Neutralization can occur at any step in the process of incorporating these the amidopolysiloxanes, for example, the polymer can be dispersed in an aqueous or detergent system and then a base added to form the clarified aqueous or detergent product; or the polymer can be preneutralized prior to addition to the aqueous or detergent system; or the water phase pH adjusted appropriately prior to polymer addition.<br><br>
[0031] Generally, the water-in-oil emulsion properties will be more evident when a is an integer from 10 to 560; b is an integer from 1 to 40, the absolute ratio of a to b is about 13 to about 35, preferably about 15-33, more preferably about 22 - 26; wherein the average integer sum of a+b exists in the range of 11 to 600 and preferably about 50 to about 400 and more preferably from about 150 to about 350. When c is zero and the amidopolysiloxane is used in a water-in oil emulsion, then the emulsion exhibits better sensory feel compared to emulsifiers known in the art containing pendant alkoxylate functionality on the polysiloxane. Neutralization of a portion or all of the carboxyl groups of the amidopolysiloxane may be desired to obtain the optimum water-in-oil emulsion characteristics. Examples of specific uses are: polishes; mold release agents; wipes; sun screens; antiperspirants; make-up removers; skin creams and lotions; hair crimes; color cosmetics; active delivery vehicles; and hair color preparations. [0032] The amidopolysiloxanes can be formulated into water-in-oil emulsions comprising:<br>
(a)	about 0.1 to about 5, preferably 0.25 to about 2, weight/weight percent of<br>
the amidopolysiloxane of Formula 1, wherein the carboxylic group may contain some<br>
ester and/or amide functional groups, but is preferably in the free acid form;<br>
(b)	about 8 to about 60 weight/weight percent of an oil phase comprised of<br>
either silicone, organosilicone and/or hydrocarbon containing oils (as previously described<br>
above); and<br>
(c)	about 40 to about 90 weight/weight percent of a water phase of pH about<br>
2 to about 12, containing about 0.1 to about 40 weight percent added electrolyte.<br>
[0033] As the amount of the amidopolysiloxane begins exceeding 2 weight percent of the emulsion, and the greater it becomes, the potentially less stable the emulsion becomes. More preferably, the water-in-oil emulsion will comprise about 0.25 -1 weight/weight percent of the amidopolysiloxane and from 20 - 40 weight/weight percent oil.<br>
[0034] The amount of electrolyte in the emulsion is application dependent. For example, an antiperspirant emulsion generally contains about 20-30 weight percent and a deodorant emulsion generally contains about 10-15 weight percent electrolyte. Electrolytes and their use are readily known by those in the emulsion art and include salts of Group IA and IIA alkali metals including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, salts of Group IVB metals including titanium and zirconium, salts of Group Iffi metals including zinc and salts of Group EQA metals including aluminum and their combinations including those coupled with chlorohydrates. [0035] The emulsion is prepared by blending the amidopolysiloxane with the oil phase and then adding and mixing in or homogenizing the water or aqueous phase. The water-in-oil emulsion can be blended at ambient (room) temperature by applying a minimum amount of mechanical shear energy such that re-dispersible and/or stable emulsions are prepared.<br><br>
[0036] The oil (b) and/or water (c) phases can optionally contain a wide assortment of other active and inactive materials as known to those in the art of formulating emulsions. Examples include sunscreen actives, preservatives, vitamins, pigments such as titanium and zinc oxides, color and fragrance.<br>
[0037] Other oil compatible additives may also be present or added to the diluent oils containing the amidopolysiloxane such as a co-emulsifier, preferably nonionic having an HLB (hydrophilic to lipophilic balance) of 4 to 12, including polyoxyethylene (POE) alcohols, POE sorbitan esters, polysorbate esters and PEG (polyethylene glycol) esters such as Arlatone P135 (polyhydroxystearic PEG ester available from Uniqema, Delaware, USA); film forming polymers, stabilizing polymers, preservatives, essential oils, fragrances, colors, drug actives, vitamins, waxes, thickeners, and UV active materials like sunscreens.<br>
[0038] The amidopolysiloxanes can 'also be made into master-batches comprising an oil phase component and the amidopolysiloxane, prior to combining with the water phase to form an emulsion. An example of one technique is the reaction of an equivalent amount of aminopolysiloxane starting materials, based on amine equivalent, with about 0.5 to about 1.10 molar equivalents of itaconic acid, preferably in the presence of an amount of compatible inert oil-phase diluent (as required when the neat reaction gets too thick to pour freely). Reaction conditions are essentially as described above, in Examples 12 -14 below and in the series of patents assigned to Mona Industries (for example, US 6,228,967 wherein reaction temperatures of about 90°C to about 125°C were sufficient to complete the reaction in just a few hours), thus preparing essentially all acid functionality on the R1 pyrrolidone-containing functional group. [0039] Another method for preparation of a masterbatcb is blending the amidopolysiloxane with a primary diluent oil or mixed oil phase, preferably at temperatures between about 20°C and about 90°C; wherein oil phase can contain a broad range silicone, organo-modified silicone, and/or hydrocarbon containing fluids, as previously described; and optional oil compatible functional materials, including but not limited to, co-emulsifying low 4-12 HLB surfactants (e.g. Arlatone P135), film forming polymers, stabilizing polymers, preservatives, essential oils, fragrances, colors, drug actives, vitamins, waxes, thickeners, and UV active materials like sunscreens. [0040] The pH and/or electrolytic strength of the water phase may be adjusted to lesser or greater degrees with organic or inorganic acids, bases and/or their salts, thus representing a wide spectrum of assorted monovalent, divalent and/or polyvalent species. Other optional water compatible<br>
S**<br>
functional materials may include, but are not limited to, water soluble glycols, diols, polyols, preservatives, colors, deodorants, antiperspirant salts, high HLB surfactants, sunscreen actives, vitamins, thickeners, hydrocolloids, dispersed phases (like kaolin clays) and the like. The water phase adjustments will be specifically tailored to influence final emulsion properties, including but<br><br>
not limited to, overall emulsion stability, internal droplet structure and size distribution, tactile feel, viscosity, and internal-phase ingredient stability and delivery kinetics. [0041] The amidopolysilicones of the present invention may be incorporated in a wide variety of detergent systems that include one or more surfactants and surface active agents. Examples of surfactants and surface active agents include anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as described in further detail below.<br>
[0042] Anionic surfactants include alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. These materials have the respective formulae ROSOjM and ROCCjH^O), SOsM, wherein R is alkyl or alkenyi of from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, x is 1 to about 10, and M is hydrogen or a cation such as ammonium, alkanolammonium (e.g., triethanolammonium), a monovalent metal cation (e.g., sodium and potassium), or a polyvalent metal cation (e.g., magnesium and calcium). Desirably, M should be chosen such that the anionic surfactant component is water soluble. The anionic surfactant or surfactants should be chosen such that the Krafft temperature is about IS'C or less, preferably about 10'C or less, and more preferably about 0*or less.<br>
[0043] Krafft temperature refers to the point at which solubility of an ionic surfactant becomes determined by crystal lattice energy and heat of hydration, and corresponds to a point at which solubility undergoes a sharp, discontinuous increase with increasing temperature. Each type of surfactant will have its own characteristic Krafft temperature. Krafft temperature for ionic surfactants is, in general, well known and understood in the art. A visual indicator of when the Krafft point has been reached is when the solution becomes cloudy as temperature is lowered. [0044] In the alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates described above, desirably R has from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms in both the alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. The alkyl ether sulfates are typically made as condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms. The alcohols can be derived from fats, e.g., coconut oil, palm oil, tallow, or the like, or the alcohols can be synthetic. Such alcohols are reacted with 1 to about 10, and especially about 3, molar proportions of ethylene oxide and the resulting mixture of molecular species having, for example, an average of 3 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, is sulfated and neutralized.<br>
[0045] Specific examples of alkyl ether sulfates which can be used in the present invention are sodium and ammonium salts of coconut alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate; tallow alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate, and tallow alkyl hexaoxyethylene sulfate. Preferred alkyl ether sulfates are those comprising a mixture of individual compounds, said mixture having an average alkyl chain length of from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms and an average degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to about 4 moles of ethylene oxide. Such a mixture also comprises from 0% to about 20% by weight of Qj-u compounds; from about 60% to about 100% by weight of C|4.16 compounds, from 0% to about 20% by weight of Cn.i» compounds; from about 3% to about 30%<br><br>
by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxyJation of 0; from about 45 % to about 90% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to about 4; from about 10% to about 25% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of from about 4 to about 8; and from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation greater than about 8.<br>
[0046] Other suitable anionic surfactants are the water-soluble salts of organic, sulfuric acid reaction products of the general formula [Rj-SOj-M] where RI is selected from the group consisting of a straight or branched chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having from about 8 to about 24, preferably about 10 to about 18, carbon atoms; and M is as previously described above in this section. Examples of such surfactants are the salts of an organic sulfuric acid reaction product of a hydrocarbon of the methane series, including iso-, neo-, and n-paraffins, having about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms and a sulfonating agent, e.g., SO3, H2SO4, obtained according to known sulfonation methods, including bleaching and hydrolysis.<br>
[0047] Still other suitable anionic surfactants are the reaction products of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut or palm oil; or sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl tauride in which the fatty acids, for example, are derived from coconut oil. [0048] Additional suitable anionic surfactants ate the succinates, examples of which include disodium N-octadecylsulfosuccinate; disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate; diammonium lauryl sulfosuccinate; tetra sodium N-(l,2-dicarboxyethyl)-N-octadecylsulfosuccinate; the diamyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid; the dihexyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid; and the dioctyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid. Other suitable anionic surfactants are those that are derived from amino acids. Nonlimiting examples of such surfactants include N-acyl-L-glutamate, N-acyl-N-methyl-p-alanate, N-acylsarcosinate, and their salts. As well as surfactants derived from taurine, which is also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. An example of such an acid is N-acyl-N-methyl taurate.<br>
[0049] Olefin sulfonates having about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms may also be used as a surfactant of the present invention. The term "olefin sulfonates" is used herein to mean compounds which can be produced by the sulfonation of alpha-olefins by means of uncomplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such that any sulfones which have been formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxy-alkanesulfonates. The sulfur trioxide can be liquid or gaseous, and is usually, but not necessarily, diluted by inert diluents, for example by liquid SO:, chlorinated hydrocarbons, etc., when used in the liquid form, or by air, nitrogen, gaseous SOj, etc., when used in the gaseous<br><br>
form. The alpha-olefins from which the olefin sulfonates are derived are mono-olefins having<br>
about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably about 14 to about 16 carbon atoms.<br>
[0050] In addition to the true alkene sulfonates and a proportion of hydroxy-alkanesulfonates, the<br>
olefin sulfonates can contain minor amounts of other materials, such as alkene disulfonates<br>
depending upon the reaction conditions, proportion of reactants, the nature of the starting olefins<br>
and impurities in the olefin stock and side reactions during the sulfonation process.<br>
[0051] Another class of suitable anionic surfactants is the beta-alkyloxy alkane sulfonates. These<br>
compounds have the following formula:<br>

where R3 contains an alkyi, alkenyl, or hydroxy alkyl radical of from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, from 0 to about 10 ethylene oxide moieties and from 0 to about 1 glyceryl moiety; Y is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms; R3 is an alkyl or monohydroxyalkyl group containing 1 to about 3 carbon atoms; X is 1 when Y is a sulfur atom, and 2 when Y is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; R4 is an alkylene or hydroxyalkylene of from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms and Z is a radical selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphonate, and phosphate groups.<br>

[0074]        The pyrrolidone carboxy substituted polysiloxane of Example 5 of U.S. 5,807,955 was prepared using lateral (pendant) amino functional silicone fluid having an average molecular weight (per primary amine) of about 4400 obtained from Shin-Etsu under the product designation of KF-865. 88 grams (0.02 moles) of the silicone fluid was admixed with 2.6 grams of itaconic acid (0.02 moles) and heated to a temperature of 12O°C to obtain a clear melt. The heating was continued for an additional two hours, with the product formed having an acid number of 13 mg potassium hydroxide per gram, molecular weight average (Mw) of about 20,000 and molecular weight number average (Mh) of about 7500. This material is commercially available as Monasil PCA, (Uniqema, New Castle, Delaware.)<br>
Example 2<br>
[0075]        100.0 grams (0.05 moles) of a lateral (pendant) amino functional silicone fluid having an average molecular weight (per primary amine) of about 2250 and as otherwise described in Table 1 was admixed with 6.5 grams of itaconic acid (0.05 moles) and heated to a temperature of 120°C to obtain a clear melt. The heating was continued for ah additional two hours, with the product formed having an acid number of 28 mg potassium hydroxide per gram, average molecular weight (Mw) of about 40,000 and molecular weight number average (Mn) of about 20,000.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0076]        100.0 grams (0.045 moles) of a lateral amino functional silicone fluid having an average molecular weight (per primary amine) of about 2300 and as otherwise described in Table 1 was admixed with 5.6 grams of itaconic acid (0.045 moles) and heated to a temperature of 120°C to obtain a clear melt. The heating was continued for an additional two hours, with the product formed having an acid number of 26 mg potassium hydroxide per gram, average molecular weight (Mw) of about 50,000 and molecular weight number average (Mn) of about 30,000.<br><br>

[0077]        100.0 grains (0.22 moles) of a lateral (pendant) amino functional silicone fluid having an equivalent weight (per primary amine) of about 450 and as otherwise described in Table 1 was obtained and admixed with 28.0 grams of itaconic acid (0.22 moles) and heated to a temperature of 120°C to obtain a clear melt The beating was continued for an additional two hours, with the product formed having an acid number of 128 mg potassium hydroxide per gram, an average molecular weight Mw of about 30OO and a molecular weight number average (Mn) of about 900. The prepared material was not soluble in water.<br>

i<br>
an equivalent weight (per primary aunine) of about 2000 and as otherwise described in Table 1 was admixed with 6.5 grams of itaconic acid (0.05 moles) and heated to a temperature of 120°C to obtain a clear melt. The heating was continued for an additional two hours, with the product formed having an acid number of 28 mg potassium hydroxide per gram polysiloxane, an average molecular weight (Mw) of about 10,000 and a molecular weight number average (Mn) of about 3300.<br>
Examples 6-11<br>
[0079]        Additional pyrrolidone-carboxylic modified polysiloxanes were made. The materials, solvents and amounts are shown in Table 2. The itaconic acid solution used in these examples was prepared by adding itaconic acid (FTA) to excess isopropanol and heating to about 40°C to 50°C until the ITA was dissolved into the alcohol, men allowed to cool. The itaconic acid was dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) at 50°C to give a 15% weight/weight active solution, equating to 55.15 g IP A The amount of the ITA that was added was based on the amount and alkali number of the polysiloxane starting material according to the following formula:<br>
Itaconic Acid (g) = raminopolysiloxane starting material ($) • aminopolvsiloxane alkali number!<br>
[ITA acid value • 2].<br>
(Since water generated by the reaction counts only 0.2% of the total charge, it was ignored from the percent solid calculation.)<br>
[0080]        The amino polysiloxane starting material was charged to the reactor and then the solvent was added and the agitator started. The cooling water on reflux condenser was turned on and the reactor slowly heated to 85°C ±5°C. Once at reaction temperature, the ITA solution was<br><br>
added slowly in a manner so the reaction temperature did not drop more than 3°C during addition. In these examples the IT A solution was added in increments with two-thirds being added first and reacted for 10 minutes and then the viscosity was tested. When the viscosity was in the range 300 to lOOOcPs at 50°C, the next addition of one-ninth of the IT A solution was added and reacted for 10 minutes. Then the viscosity was tested and when it was in the range 1000 to 1300 cPs at 50°C, then the next one-ninth portion of the IT A solution was added over 30 minutes and reacted for another 10 minutes before measuring the viscosity again. When the viscosity was in the range of 1300 to 1500 cPs at SO°C, the last one-ninth of the ITA solution was added over 30 minutes. After the viscosity is in the range of 1500 to 1200 cPs at 50°C, the mixture is held at reaction temperature and sampled every two hours for viscosity, acid value and alkali number until meeting desired specifications. It is then allowed to cool to about 50°C and filtered.<br>

*	D5 is cyclopentadimethicone and is of medium polarity<br>
*	Isopar M is a branched isoparaffinic hydrocarbon solvent by ExxonMobil which is fairly non-polar.<br>
Example 9 illustrates the importance of matching the polarity of the solvent with the final product. In this example, the product is too polar due to a high incorporation of pyrrolindone carboxylate to remain in phase with the isoparaffinic solvent upon cooling. Polar solvents, such as C^ia alkyl esters of lower alcohols or lower alcohols would be preferred and also enhances reaction rates.<br>
Example 12<br>
[0081]       A premix was obtained where itaconic acid was dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) at<br>
50°C to give a 15% weight/weight active solution, equating to 55g IPA. Thereafter, the quantity<br>
of solvent required to give a 50% weight/weight active final product was calculated and shown in<br>
Tables.<br>
[0082]        Charged to a reaction flask was 150 g of an aminosilicone starting material the same<br>
as that used for Example 2 of Table 1. Its amine value was calculated to determine the amount of<br>
itaconic acid needed for a stoiciometric reaction. In this example, the starting aminopolysilicone<br><br>
had a measured amine value of 28 mg KOH/g, then 150 g contains 0.07487 moles of amine which equates to 9.73 g of itaconic acid.<br>
[0083]       Then 105 g isopropanol was added to the aminosilicone in the reactor as solvent and brought to a reaction temperature of 86°C. At reaction temperature, the itaconic acid/IP A premix was slowly added over about one hour via drip feed yielding 160g total IP A solvent under reflux. [0084]       The reaction was monitored via acid and amine values until the reaction reached the desired end point of less than 1 ^remaining amine. At this stage, the heat was removed and the reaction cooled to room temperature. A total of 10 hours under reflux was required. [0085]       Example 13 was made using the same general process using the materials and conditions described in Table 3, except isopropyl myristate (IPM) was used as part of the solvent system to raise reflux temperature and lower reaction time to 6 hours.<br>
[0086]       Example 14 uses IP A as solvent in a closed reflux at 2 Bar gauge pressure to further reduce reaction cycle time.<br>

Example IS (Failed Emulsion Using a Carboxy-Polysiloxane of the prior art)<br>
[0087]        Oil Phase preparation: One gram of the trimethylsiloxy capped polysiloxane product<br>
of Example 1 was gently mixed for one hour at room temperature with 19 grams<br>
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane. Water phase preparation: 0.70 grams of magnesium sulfate was<br>
dissolved in 78.30 grams distilled water.<br>
[0088]       The water phase was combined slowly to the oil phase under moderate<br>
homogenization (2000 rpm), followed afterwards by 2-minute homogenization at 10,000 rpm. The<br>
product phase separated immediately.<br>
Example 16 (Emulsion)<br>
[0089]       Oil Phase preparation: One gram of the trimethylsiloxy capped polysiloxane product<br>
of Example 2 was gently mixed for one hour at room temperature with 19 grams<br>
decamethylcyclopentasilxane.<br>
[0090]       The water phase preparation and method of combining the two phases were as<br>
described in Example 15 above.<br><br>
[0091]       The resultant product was a low viscosity water-in-oil emulsion that showed no sign of phase separation after two weeks at 45°C and was still stable after 6 months at 25°C.<br>
Example 17<br>
[0092]        Same composition and method as Example 16 were used with the addition of 0.25 grams of glycolic acid to the water phase prior to emulsification. The product phase was a medium-viscosity (about 10,000 cPs) water-in-oil emulsion that showed no sign of phase separation after two weeks at 45°C and was still stable after 6 months at 25°C.<br>

[0095]       The components of water phase B of Table 5 were added together and mixed until clear. The water phase was combined slowly to the oil phase under moderate (2000 rpm) homogenization, followed afterwards by 2-minute homogenization at 10,000 rpm resulting in a water-in-oil emulsion that was still stable after five freeze-thaw cycles of -20°C and 25°C.<br><br>

[0101] The emulsion product viscosity was in the same range as that generally found in commercial roll-on products. The emulsion product was stable for more than six months at room temperature and illustrates that even low amounts of polymer can greatly impact stability. The same formulation was made without the polymer and it immediately separated.<br>

[0102] Translucent antiperspirant compositions were prepared by first combining the silicone oil<br>

[0103] The ingredients of water phase B were blended and homogenized until uniform. Both<br>
phases were heated to about SO°C after which the water phase was combined to the oil phase using<br>
the method described in Example 18 above (while observing it thickened dramatically and became<br>
clear). Both example products cooled to a stable translucent paste. These examples are not<br>
considered optimized in terms of clarity and it is anticipated, that additional refractive index<br>
matching, as known to those in the art, will yield a clear product at room temperature. The<br>
translucent emulsion appeared clear and non-whitening when applied to the skin.<br><br>

[0105] The emulsion broke easily when polishing hard surfaces and therefore was considered easy to apply. It beaded water, was free of attracted dirt and was still extremely glossy and smooth a month later. It is felt that this class of emulsions would be useful in many polish and/or lubricant applications, particularly those related to the automotive, metalworking, furniture and hard surface industries.<br><br>

[0106] A test cleanser was prepared by blending together the ingredients listed in Table 11.<br>

[0107] 20% by weight of the active polymer from Example 4 (acid equivalent weight of 450g/mol) was blended with deionized water to prepare a two-phase dispersion. This dispersion was then neutralized with NaOH (inorganic), TEA (very hydrophilic) or cocodimethyl amine (CDA) (moderate hydrophobe) to -pH 6, followed by blending each with a portion of the test cleanser as indicated in Table 12 below. The stability of the resultant test cleansers were observed and reported in Table 12.<br>

[0108] Regardless of the ion pair or salt formed, the amidopolysiloxane of the present invention from example 4 is completely compatible in the cleanser system and was noted to foam well, in contrast to the silicone polymers in the art which act as defoamers.<br>
Example 26<br>
[0109] 25% isopropyl myristate by weight was added to 75% by weight Example 2 polymer to slightly dilute the polymer such that the viscosity was reduced. This mixture was mixed in a 50:50 by weight ratio with SLES-2 (a hydrophobic surfactant of sodium laureth-2 sulfate) and then neutralized to pH 6 with NaOH (38% final polymer activity). The product was thin and clear prior<br><br>
to neutralization but formed a dear ge! after NaOH neutralization. The non-neutralized mixture was clear and easy to handle, so it was selected for use, Part n of Table 13, in the next example.<br>
Example 26A-D<br>
[0110] The sample of example 26 was added to the test cleanser, but the process was slow and difficult due to low dissolution time of the silicone polymer in the cleanser. Consequently, the order of addition was altered by making the cleanser base with only the surfactants, thus leaving out the final water charge until after the polymer premix was added. Thus, the Surfactant Premix, Part I, and the Polymer Addition, Pan n, of Table 13 were blended and the water, salt and pH of Part m were then added with mixing. For each sample, Parts, I, n and IE were blended m the amounts provided in Table 14.<br>

[0111] Even at over 4% polymer by weight, the clarity was surprisingly clear. This result compares very favorably considering most commericial silicone polymers are low molecular weight (-750-1000 daltons) and typically highly ethoxylated to achieve this result. Cleansing and foaming were good and the product left a desirable conditioned feel to the hands, without any feel of product build-up.<br>
[0112] Using the industry standard Ross Miles Foam test at 40° C, the formulation of 26A was tested against a control (same formulation without the polysiloxane of Example 2). The foam reported density (in millimeters, mm) given below was obtained by taking the actual foam height and subtracting from it the drainage liquor of 50-70 mm (millimeters).<br><br>
