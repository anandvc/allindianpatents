COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION-10 PROCESS FOR PACKING INSECT REPELLENT DEVICE<br>
GODREJ SARALEE LTD.,<br>
Of Pirojshanagar, Eastern Express Highway,<br>
Vikhroli (E), Mumbai 400 079, Maharashtra, India,<br>
An Indian Company<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE<br>
PERFORMED:-<br><br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process of packing insect repellent device more particularly packing coiled insect repellent device used to control mosquitoes and other biting arthropods in living rooms and the said packaging of the coiled insect repellent device can be dispensed or sold as a pair of coils without any breakage.<br>
Coiled mosquito repellent consists of slowly burnable solid materials that contain an insect control ingredient such as repellent, insecticide, or an insect growth regulator. These coils are burnt to release smoke thus vaporising the insect control ingredient along with the smoke in the air constantly to repel mosquitoes from the area.<br>
Conventional mosquito incense coils are available in flat spiral shape with double coils nested one within the other. The user has to separate the double coil and use the single coil daily. Normally the coils are packed in cartons of 5 double coils each. Very often there is a practice among customers to purchase single double coils for protection against mosquito bites. The retailers have to sell single double coil as loose. In doing so there is a chance of coil getting broken while removing from the primary pack and also the coils tend to absorb moisture from air when exposed which will lead to extinguishing of the coil while burning.<br>
In one available product the coils are packed in a plastic tray of 5 and covered with film. These types of coil packaging are expensive and also the customers have to remove the coils from the pack and use only single coil daily and the tray holding the coils are used to collect the ashes from the burning coil.<br>
2<br><br>
irranother coil product sold under the brand name 'MORTEIN' has 5-10 pairs of coils packed in tin containers and these containers are also used to hold the coils while burning. Such containers are also expensive and the user has to remove rest of the coil while using only one coil for protection against insects every night. The coils thus removed from the primary pack can absorb moisture and get exposed to other environmental factors that result in extinguishing of the coils while burning. There is also considerable breakage of coils at the customer end observed.<br>
Hence it is an object of the present invention to provide a process of packing coiled insect repellent device that can be dispensed/sold without breakage<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a process of packing coiled insect repellent device that is cheaper and avoid breakage during transport.<br>
It is also yet another object of the present invention provides a process of packing coiled insect repellent device that prevents the coil from being exposed to the environment that will lead to extinguishing.<br>
