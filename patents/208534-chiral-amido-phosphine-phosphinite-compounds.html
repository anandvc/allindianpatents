wherein R3 and R4 have the significances given above, in a solvent and in the presence of a base.<br>
Suitably, the compound of formula III is dissolved in a solvent, preferably under an inert atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen or argon, and a base (the first) is added, which can usually be effected at room temperature. Then, the solution is cooled down considerably, suitably to about -80°C, and subsequently the second base is added thereto followed slowly by the chlorophosphane, suitably dissolved in a solvent.  The reaction starts even at the low temperature.  Subsequently, the temperature can be increased gradually, conveniently to room temperature, and thereafter the thus-<br><br>
obtained product (the compound of formula I) can be isolated and purified according to methods known per se.<br>
In the process in accordance with the invention bases which serve in the role of the "first base" are secondary or tertiary amines, especially dialkylamines or trialkylamines, e.g. dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine and tripropylamine, and bases which serve in the role of the "second base" are alkali metal alkyls or alkali metal aryls, e.g. propyllithium, butyllithium, phenyllithium, butylsodium and butylpotassium, i.e. a combination of a secondary or tertiary amine (first base) with an alkali metal alkyl or alkali metal aryl (second base).  Diisopropylamine and butyllithium are especially preferred bases.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, methylene chloride and chloroform; and aliphatic and cyclic ethers such as, for example, diethyl ether, tert. butyl methyl ether and 1,2-dimethoxyethane and, respectively, dioxan, furan and tetrahydrofuran; or mixtures of such solvents.   Diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran is preferably used as the solvent for the manufacture of the amidophosphine-phosphinite compounds.<br>
For the isolation and purification of the product, the mixture is conveniently evaporated, the residue is taken up in a suitable solvent, especially in a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, and, after removal of residual solid constituents by filtration, the filtrate is evaporated to dryness. The thus-obtained chiral compound of formula I can be purified further by crystallization, especially from a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. pentane.<br>
The enantiomerically-pure (R)- or (S)-compounds of formula III in turn can be produced by the asymmetric hydrogenation of the corresponding a-ketoamide R1COCONHR2 using enantiomerically-pure hydrogenation<br>
catalysts in a manner known per se [H.Takaya et. al., "Asymmetric Hydrogenation", pages 1-39 in Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis, Ed. Iwao Ojima, VCH Publishers, Inc., New YorkAVeinheim/Cambridge (1993) as well as the references cited at the end of the article].<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the complexes of formulae Il-a to Il-n not only as such, i.e. in the form of the respective individual complex<br><br>
consisting of the ligands Y in accordance with the invention (the chiral amidophosphine-phosphinite compound of formula I), the group VIII metal and optionally further ligands, but also in the form of the individual components, act as catalysts for enantioselective reactions, e.g. asymmetric hydrogenations.  The complexes of formulae Il-a to Il-n themselves can be produced from these components in a manner known per se: see, for example, J.A.C.S. 93, 3089-3091 (1971); J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Comm. 1990. 869-871; Tetr.: Asymm. 7(11), 3059-3062 (1996); ibid. 6(1), 11-14 (1995); F.R. Hartley, The Chemistry of Platinum and Palladium, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., London 1973; J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Comm. 1986, 1338-1339; Inorg. Chem. 30, 125-130 (1991); Organometallics 12, 1406-1415 (1993); as well as ibid 15, 2440-2449 (1996).<br>
The complexes in accordance with the invention of the compounds of formula I with Group VIII metals, especially those of the aforementioned formulae Il-a to Il-k, are suitable, for example, for the catalysis of the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds of formula V to compounds of formula VI<br><br>
wherein HX signifies a mineral acid from the group of HBF4, H2SO4, HPF6, HC1, HBr, HI, H3PO4, HSbF6, HCIO4 and NaH2P04 or a strong organic acid from the group of Ci-8-alkylS03H, picric acid, formic acid, lower alkyl- and arylcarboxylic acids, e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid and benzoic acid, and dicarboxylic acids e.g. oxalic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid and phthalic acid, and * denotes a chiral centre.<br>
The molar ratio (substratexatalyst, commonly denoted as "S/C") between the compound of formula V to be hydrogenated and the metal complex which is used as the catalyst in accordance with any one of formulae Il-a to Il-k, conveniently lies between about 20 and about 80 000,<br><br>
preferably between about 500 and about 30 000. The hydrogenation is conveniently carried out at temperatures in the range of about 0°C to about 150°C, preferably 10°C to 100°C, and under a pressure of about 1 to about 200 bar (about 0.1 MPa to about 20 MPa), preferably 10 to 80 bar (1 MPa to 8 MPa).<br>
The free base of the compounds of formula VI is a known and valuable intermediate for pharmaceutically usable end products, e.g. the antitussive dextromethorphan and the analgesic levorphanol.<br>
The complexes in accordance with the invention are also suitable, for example, as catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds of formula VII to compounds of formula VIII<br><br>
wherein R5 signifies Ci-8-alkyl, Ci-8-alkoxy, phenyl, benzyl or a group N(R6)2 and R6 signifies hydrogen, Ci_8-alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and * denotes a chiral<br>
centre.<br>
Cationic rhodium complexes of formula Il-a are preferably used as the catalysts for this asymmetric hydrogenation.<br>
The ratio between rhodium and the ligands in accordance with the invention (chiral amidophosphine-phosphinite compound of formula I) lies in the range of about 0.05 to about 5 mol, preferably of 0.5 to 2 mol, of rhodium per mol of ligand.  The molar ratio between the compound of formula VII to be hydrogenated and rhodium in the complex of formula Il-a, i.e. the substrate: catalyst ratio (S/C), conveniently amounts to about 20 to about 100 000, especially about 500 to about 50 000. The enantioselective hydrogenation of compounds of formula VII using a complex of formula Il-a can be effected at temperatures of about 10°C to about 120°C, preferably at about 10°C to about 60°C. The hydrogenation is conveniently effected under a pressure of<br><br>
about 1 to about 150 bar (about 0.1 to about 15 MPa), preferably of 5 to 60 bar (0.5 to 6 MPa).<br>
The compounds of formula VIII are valuable intermediates for the synthesis of retinoids, which can be used e.g. for the therapy and prophylaxis of dermatological disorders, e.g. acne and psoriasis [see, for example, Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 57, 741 (1985) as well as European Patent Publication 0 802 181 Al].   Further, the compounds of formula VIII, which can be converted by hydrolysis into phorenol and in a further reaction step into optically active actinol, are important intermediates for the production of 3-hydroxy-carotenoids, especially for the production of zeaxanthin [see Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 51, 535-564 (1979) and Helv. Chim. Acta 63, 1451-1455 (1980)].<br>

A catalyst solution was prepared in a glove box (O2 content 
 <br>
0.025 molar methanolic hydrochloric acid solution and 40 ml of methylene chloride, subsequently stirred at 20°C for 1.5 hours and thereafter transferred into a pressure-tight catalyst supply vessel. A 2 1 steel autoclave was charged with 71.6 g (0.5 mol) of 2-keto-3,3,N-trimethyl-butyramide and 310 ml of methanol and sealed. After replacement of the atmosphere with hydrogen the catalyst solution was allowed to flow from the catalyst supply vessel into the autoclave with slight over-pressure and the hydrogenation was carried out while stirring at 60°C and at a pressure of 60 bar (6 MPa). After 20 hours the hydrogenation was interrupted and the reaction mixture was evaporated. From a solution of the residue in 250 ml of diisopropyl ether there firstly separated at room temperature 1.2 g of crystalline product with ee = 3% and a melting point of 135-137°C. By adding 275 ml of cyclohexane and stirring the mixture in an ice bath for 3 hours there were isolated 43.9 g (60.5%) of (R)-2-hydroxy-3,3,N-trimethyl-butyramide; m.p. 69-71°C; [a]2D° = -61.0° (c = 1, CHCI3), ee = 98.7% (measured by GC on an OV-61/p-DiMe-(3-CD chiral column).<br>

3.88 g (26.7 mmol) of (R)-2-hydroxy-3,3,N-trimethyl-butyramide were dissolved in 200 ml of dried tetrahydrofuran at RT in a 500 ml flask having a valve cut into the side for argon gasification, a stirrer core and a serum<br><br>
stopper, and 0.5 ml of diisopropylamine was added using a syringe.  After stirring for 30 minutes the colourless solution was cooled to about -78°C and 28.5 ml (53.5 mmol) of butyllithium were added using a syringe during 10 minutes. After stirring at -78°C for 1 hour the pale yellow suspension was treated dropwise with a solution of 11.8 g (53.5 mmol) of chloro-diphenylphosphane in 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran over 30 minutes, a pale yellow clear solution gradually forming after a further 60 minutes at -78°C. Subsequently, the cooling bath was removed, the solvent was evaporated at RT and the residual foam-like yellow oil was dried in a HV for 5 hours.  A colourless suspension with a lithium chloride precipitate formed upon adding 200 ml of diethyl ether. The supernatant yellow solution was filtered over Alox (I, basic; aluminium oxide for chromatography, activity grade I, CAMAG, CH-4123 Muttenz, Switzerland) with diethyl ether in a protective gas suction filter. The combined filtrates were evaporated completely in a Schlenk tube in a HV and the residue was dried in a HV for 12 hours. The residual yellow oil was solidified with liquid nitrogen at about -180°C and treated rapidly with 50 ml of pentane.  Colourless crystals formed after ultrasound treatment for 5 minutes. After standing at about 5°C for 24 hours the supernatant solution was separated and the white crystallizate was washed twice at 0°C with 20 ml each time, a total of 40 ml, of pentane and dried in a HV for 2 hours.

The term "oxygen acid or complex acid" (source of the anion A") signifies an acid from the group of H2SO4, HCIO4, HBr04, HIO4, HNO3, H3PO4, H3PO3 and CF3SO3H or a halogen complex with the element boron, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth.   Preferred representatives of both types of acids are HCIO4, CF3SO3H, HPF6, HBF4, HB(phenyl)4, HB[3,5(CF3)2-C6H3]4, HSbF6 and HAsF6. The anion A" is formed in each case by removing a hydrogen ion; examples are CIO4, PFg and BF4.<br>
The term "anionic coordinating ligand" (B) embraces especially halogen, a carboxylic acid residue, a sulphonate residue, e.g. tosylate or methanesulphonate, a 1,3-diketonate, e.g. acetylacetonate, an optionally substituted phenolate, hydroxy, nitrate, nitrite, cyanate, rhodanide, cyanide, allyl and 2-methylallyl. When phenolate is substituted, Ci-4-alkyl groups<br>
and halogen atoms especially come into consideration as substituents, with 1    the substitution being single or multiple.<br>
As the alkali metal ion (M+) or alkaline earth metal ion (M2+) there is especially suitable the sodium or potassium ion or, respectively, the calcium or magnesium ion.<br>
The term "tetrasubstituted ammonium ion" (M+) signifies an anion consisting of a nitrogen atom and four identical or different substituents which are selected from the group of Ci-8-alkyl, phenyl and benzyl, such as,<br><br>
for example, the anions (Ci.8-alkyl)4N+, (phenyl)N+(Ci_8-alkyl)3 and (benzyl)N+(Ci_8-alkyl)3.<br>
The term "halogen" (B, C2 or C3) embraces fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.  In the case of a complex of formula Il-e in which B signifies halogen, the halogen can be derived from the corresponding alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or tetrasubstituted ammonium halide.<br>
Preferred complexes in accordance with the invention of the compounds of formula I are the optically active cationic and neutral rhodium, iridium and ruthenium complexes of formulae Il-a to Il-k.<br>
The process in accordance with the invention for the manufacture of the novel chiral compounds of formula I comprises reacting a compound of the general formula<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 have the significances given above, with a disubstituted chlorophosphane of the general formula<br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 have the significances given above, in a solvent and in the presence of a base.<br>
Suitably, the compound of formula III is dissolved in a solvent, preferably under an inert atmosphere, e.g. nitrogen or argon, and a base (the first) is added, which can usually be effected at room temperature. Then, the solution is cooled down considerably, suitably to about -80°C, and subsequently the second base is added thereto followed slowly by the chlorophosphane, suitably dissolved in a solvent.  The reaction starts even at the low temperature.  Subsequently, the temperature can be increased gradually, conveniently to room temperature, and thereafter the thus-<br><br>
obtained product (the compound of formula I) can be isolated and purified according to methods known per se.<br>
In the process in accordance with the invention bases which serve in the role of the "first base" are secondary or tertiary amines, especially dialkylamines or trialkylamines, e.g. dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine and tripropylamine, and bases which serve in the role of the "second base" are alkali metal alkyls or alkali metal aryls, e.g. propyllithium, butyllithium, phenyllithium, butylsodium and butylpotassium, i.e. a combination of a secondary or tertiary amine (first base) with an alkali metal alkyl or alkali metal aryl (second base).  Diisopropylamine and butyllithium are especially preferred bases.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, methylene chloride and chloroform; and aliphatic and cyclic ethers such as, for example, diethyl ether, tert. butyl methyl ether and 1,2-dimethoxyethane and, respectively, dioxan, furan and tetrahydrofuran; or mixtures of such solvents.   Diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran is preferably used as the solvent for the manufacture of the amidophosphine-phosphinite compounds.<br>
For the isolation and purification of the product, the mixture is conveniently evaporated, the residue is taken up in a suitable solvent, especially in a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, and, after removal of residual solid constituents by filtration, the filtrate is evaporated to dryness. The thus-obtained chiral compound of formula I can be purified further by crystallization, especially from a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon, e.g. pentane.<br>
The enantiomerically-pure (R)- or (S)-compounds of formula III in turn can be produced by the asymmetric hydrogenation of the corresponding a-ketoamide R1COCONHR2 using enantiomerically-pure hydrogenation<br>
catalysts in a manner known per se [H.Takaya et. al., "Asymmetric Hydrogenation", pages 1-39 in Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis, Ed. Iwao Ojima, VCH Publishers, Inc., New YorkAVeinheim/Cambridge (1993) as well as the references cited at the end of the article].<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the complexes of formulae Il-a to Il-n not only as such, i.e. in the form of the respective individual complex<br><br>
consisting of the ligands Y in accordance with the invention (the chiral amidophosphine-phosphinite compound of formula I), the group VIII metal and optionally further ligands, but also in the form of the individual components, act as catalysts for enantioselective reactions, e.g. asymmetric hydrogenations.  The complexes of formulae Il-a to Il-n themselves can be produced from these components in a manner known per se: see, for example, J.A.C.S. 93, 3089-3091 (1971); J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Comm. 1990. 869-871; Tetr.: Asymm. 7(11), 3059-3062 (1996); ibid. 6(1), 11-14 (1995); F.R. Hartley, The Chemistry of Platinum and Palladium, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., London 1973; J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Comm. 1986, 1338-1339; Inorg. Chem. 30, 125-130 (1991); Organometallics 12, 1406-1415 (1993); as well as ibid 15, 2440-2449 (1996).<br>
The complexes in accordance with the invention of the compounds of formula I with Group VIII metals, especially those of the aforementioned formulae Il-a to Il-k, are suitable, for example, for the catalysis of the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds of formula V to compounds of formula VI<br><br>
wherein HX signifies a mineral acid from the group of HBF4, H2SO4, HPF6, HC1, HBr, HI, H3PO4, HSbF6, HCIO4 and NaH2P04 or a strong organic acid from the group of Ci-8-alkylS03H, picric acid, formic acid, lower alkyl- and arylcarboxylic acids, e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid and benzoic acid, and dicarboxylic acids e.g. oxalic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid and phthalic acid, and * denotes a chiral centre.<br>
The molar ratio (substratexatalyst, commonly denoted as "S/C") between the compound of formula V to be hydrogenated and the metal complex which is used as the catalyst in accordance with any one of formulae Il-a to Il-k, conveniently lies between about 20 and about 80 000,<br><br>
preferably between about 500 and about 30 000. The hydrogenation is conveniently carried out at temperatures in the range of about 0°C to about 150°C, preferably 10°C to 100°C, and under a pressure of about 1 to about 200 bar (about 0.1 MPa to about 20 MPa), preferably 10 to 80 bar (1 MPa to 8 MPa).<br>
The free base of the compounds of formula VI is a known and valuable intermediate for pharmaceutically usable end products, e.g. the antitussive dextromethorphan and the analgesic levorphanol.<br>
The complexes in accordance with the invention are also suitable, for example, as catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds of formula VII to compounds of formula VIII<br><br>
wherein R5 signifies Ci-8-alkyl, Ci-8-alkoxy, phenyl, benzyl or a group N(R6)2 and R6 signifies hydrogen, Ci_8-alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and * denotes a chiral<br>
centre.<br>
Cationic rhodium complexes of formula Il-a are preferably used as the catalysts for this asymmetric hydrogenation.<br>
The ratio between rhodium and the ligands in accordance with the invention (chiral amidophosphine-phosphinite compound of formula I) lies in the range of about 0.05 to about 5 mol, preferably of 0.5 to 2 mol, of rhodium per mol of ligand.  The molar ratio between the compound of formula VII to be hydrogenated and rhodium in the complex of formula Il-a, i.e. the substrate: catalyst ratio (S/C), conveniently amounts to about 20 to about 100 000, especially about 500 to about 50 000. The enantioselective hydrogenation of compounds of formula VII using a complex of formula Il-a can be effected at temperatures of about 10°C to about 120°C, preferably at about 10°C to about 60°C. The hydrogenation is conveniently effected under a pressure of<br><br>
about 1 to about 150 bar (about 0.1 to about 15 MPa), preferably of 5 to 60 bar (0.5 to 6 MPa).<br>
The compounds of formula VIII are valuable intermediates for the synthesis of retinoids, which can be used e.g. for the therapy and prophylaxis of dermatological disorders, e.g. acne and psoriasis [see, for example, Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 57, 741 (1985) as well as European Patent Publication 0 802 181 Al].   Further, the compounds of formula VIII, which can be converted by hydrolysis into phorenol and in a further reaction step into optically active actinol, are important intermediates for the production of 3-hydroxy-carotenoids, especially for the production of zeaxanthin [see Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 51, 535-564 (1979) and Helv. Chim. Acta 63, 1451-1455 (1980)].<br>

A catalyst solution was prepared in a glove box (O2 content 
 <br>
0.025 molar methanolic hydrochloric acid solution and 40 ml of methylene chloride, subsequently stirred at 20°C for 1.5 hours and thereafter transferred into a pressure-tight catalyst supply vessel. A 2 1 steel autoclave was charged with 71.6 g (0.5 mol) of 2-keto-3,3,N-trimethyl-butyramide and 310 ml of methanol and sealed. After replacement of the atmosphere with hydrogen the catalyst solution was allowed to flow from the catalyst supply vessel into the autoclave with slight over-pressure and the hydrogenation was carried out while stirring at 60°C and at a pressure of 60 bar (6 MPa). After 20 hours the hydrogenation was interrupted and the reaction mixture was evaporated. From a solution of the residue in 250 ml of diisopropyl ether there firstly separated at room temperature 1.2 g of crystalline product with ee = 3% and a melting point of 135-137°C. By adding 275 ml of cyclohexane and stirring the mixture in an ice bath for 3 hours there were isolated 43.9 g (60.5%) of (R)-2-hydroxy-3,3,N-trimethyl-butyramide; m.p. 69-71°C; [a]2D° = -61.0° (c = 1, CHCI3), ee = 98.7% (measured by GC on an OV-61/p-DiMe-(3-CD chiral column).<br>

stopper, and 0.5 ml of diisopropylamine was added using a syringe.  After stirring for 30 minutes the colourless solution was cooled to about -78°C and 28.5 ml (53.5 mmol) of butyllithium were added using a syringe during 10 minutes. After stirring at -78°C for 1 hour the pale yellow suspension was treated dropwise with a solution of 11.8 g (53.5 mmol) of chloro-diphenylphosphane in 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran over 30 minutes, a pale yellow clear solution gradually forming after a further 60 minutes at -78°C. Subsequently, the cooling bath was removed, the solvent was evaporated at RT and the residual foam-like yellow oil was dried in a HV for 5 hours.  A colourless suspension with a lithium chloride precipitate formed upon adding 200 ml of diethyl ether. The supernatant yellow solution was filtered over Alox (I, basic; aluminium oxide for chromatography, activity grade I, CAMAG, CH-4123 Muttenz, Switzerland) with diethyl ether in a protective gas suction filter. The combined filtrates were evaporated completely in a Schlenk tube in a HV and the residue was dried in a HV for 12 hours. The residual yellow oil was solidified with liquid nitrogen at about -180°C and treated rapidly with 50 ml of pentane.  Colourless crystals formed after ultrasound treatment for 5 minutes. After standing at about 5°C for 24 hours the supernatant solution was separated and the white crystallizate was washed twice at 0°C with 20 ml each time, a total of 40 ml, of pentane and dried in a HV for 2 hours.
