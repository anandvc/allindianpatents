ELECTRICALLY HEATED PARTICULATE FILTER REGENERATION<br>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR HYBRID VEHICLES<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001]     This invention was produced pursuant to U.S.  Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE).  The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]     The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
heating particulate filters in hybrid vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Diesel engines typically have higher efficiency than gasoline<br>
engines due to an increased compression ratio and a higher energy density of<br>
diesel fuel. A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are typically<br>
filtered from diesel exhaust by a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed in the<br>
exhaust stream.<br>
[0005] Over time, the PF becomes full and the trapped diesel<br>
particulates must be removed. During regeneration, the diesel particulates are<br>
burned within the PF. Some regeneration methods ignite particulate matter<br>
present on the front of the PF via a front surface heater.    Regeneration of<br>
1<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
particulate matter present inside the PF is then achieved using the heat<br>
generated by combustion of particulate matter present near the heated face of<br>
the PF or by the heated exhaust passing through the PF.<br>
[0006] Some hybrid vehicles include diesel engines in their powertrain<br>
configuration. To maximize fuel economy, the hybrid vehicles implement a start-<br>
stop mode where the diesel engine is temporarily shut off during the drive cycle.<br>
During such time, exhaust flow through the PF ceases. A control strategy is<br>
needed to efficiently regenerate the PF.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, a control system for controlling regeneration of a<br>
particulate filter for a hybrid vehicle is provided. The system generally includes a<br>
regeneration module that controls current to the particulate filter to initiate<br>
regeneration. An engine control module controls operation of an engine of the<br>
hybrid vehicle based on the control of the current to the particulate filter.<br>
[0008] In other features, a method of controlling regeneration of a<br>
particulate filter for hybrid vehicles is provided. The method generally includes:<br>
initiating regeneration by controlling current to the particulate filter; determining a<br>
temperature of the particulate filter; and starting an engine of the hybrid vehicle<br>
based on the temperature of the particulate filter.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>

GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
[0020] The hybrid vehicle 10 shown in Figure 1 includes a<br>
turbocharged diesel engine system 11. The turbocharged diesel engine system<br>
11 includes an engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to drive a<br>
transmission (not shown). The transmission (not shown) can be either an<br>
automatic or a manual transmission that is driven by the engine 12 through a<br>
corresponding torque converter or clutch (not shown). Air enters the system by<br>
passing through an air filter 15. Air passes through the air filter 15 and is drawn<br>
into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air entering<br>
the system 11. The greater the compression of the air generally, the greater the<br>
output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air cooler 20<br>
before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0021] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the systems and<br>
methods of the present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a<br>
plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the present<br>
disclosure can be implemented in a v-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected<br>
into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites<br>
the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust<br>
exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0022] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PF) 34. Optionally, an EGR<br>
valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake<br>
5<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
manifold 22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to<br>
drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received<br>
from the air filter 15. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC<br>
32 and the PF 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on the post<br>
combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the temperature of<br>
the exhaust. The PF 34 receives exhaust from the DOC 32 and filters any<br>
particulates present in the exhaust.<br>
[0023] The hybrid vehicle 10 further includes an electric machine 36<br>
and a power source 46. The electric machine 36 operates in one of a motor<br>
mode and a generator mode. When operating in the motor mode, the electric<br>
machine 36 is powered by the power source 46. When operating in the motor<br>
mode, the electric machine 36 provides positive torque which assists the engine<br>
12 or drives the transmission (not shown). When operating in the generator<br>
mode, the electric machine 36 generates electrical energy to charge the power<br>
source 46. The electric machine 36 may be driven by the engine 12 or by the<br>
transmission (not shown). As can be appreciated, the power source 46 can<br>
power other vehicle components in addition to the electric machine 36.<br>
[0024] A control module 44 controls the engine and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed and/or modeled information and the particulate filter<br>
regeneration methods and systems of the present disclosure, in various<br>
embodiments, an exhaust temperature sensor 47 generates an exhaust<br>
temperature signal based on a temperature of the exhaust. A mass airflow<br>
sensor 48 generates an exhaust air signal based on air entering or exiting the<br>
6<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
engine 12. A current and/or voltage sensor 49 generates a current and/or<br>
voltage signal based on the voltage and/or current supplied by the power source<br>
46 to the PF 34. An oxygen sensor 51 generates an oxygen level signal based<br>
on a level of oxygen in the exhaust.<br>
[0025] In general, the control module 44 receives the signals and<br>
estimates loading of the PF 34. When the estimated loading achieves a<br>
threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter of particulate matter) and the engine is turned<br>
off, current is controlled to the PF 34 via the power source 46 to initiate the<br>
regeneration process. The duration of the regeneration process varies based<br>
upon the amount of particulate matter within the PF 34. It is anticipated, that the<br>
regeneration process can last between 1 - 6 minutes. Current is only applied,<br>
however, during an initial portion of the regeneration process. More specifically,<br>
the electric energy heats the face of the PF 34 for a threshold period (e.g., 1 - 2<br>
minutes). Once the face is sufficiently heated, the engine 12 is turned on and<br>
exhaust flowing from the engine 12 and passing through the front face is heated.<br>
The remainder of the regeneration process is achieved using the heat generated<br>
by combustion of particulate matter present near the heated face of the PF 34 or<br>
by the heated exhaust passing through the PF 34.<br>
[0026] With particular reference to Figure 2, the PF 34 is preferably a<br>
monolith particulate trap and includes alternating closed cells/channels 50 and<br>
opened cells/channels 52. The cells/channels 50, 52 are typically square cross-<br>
sections, running axially through the part. Walls 58 of the PF 34 are preferably<br>
comprised of a porous ceramic honeycomb wall of cordierite material.    It is<br>
7<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
appreciated that any ceramic comb material is considered within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure. Adjacent channels are alternatively plugged at each end as<br>
shown at 56. This forces the diesel aerosol through the porous substrate walls<br>
which act as a mechanical filter. Particulate matter is deposited within the closed<br>
channels 50 and exhaust exits through the opened channels 52. Particles 59<br>
flow into the PF 34 and are trapped therein.<br>
[0027] For regeneration purposes, a grid 64 including an electrically<br>
resistive material is attached to the front exterior surface referred to as the front<br>
face of the PF 34. Current is supplied to the resistive material to generate<br>
thermal energy. It is appreciated that thick film heating technology may be used<br>
to attach the grid 64 to the PF 34. For example, a heating material such as Silver<br>
or Nichrome may be coated then etched or applied with a mask to the front face<br>
of the PF 34. In various other embodiments, the grid 64 is composed of<br>
electrically resistive material such as stainless steel and attached to the PF 34<br>
using an adhesive or press fit to the PF 34.<br>
[0028] It is also appreciated that the resistive material may be applied<br>
in various single or multi-path patterns as shown in Figure 3. Segments of<br>
resistive material can be removed to generate the pathways. In various<br>
embodiments a perforated heater insert 70 as shown in Figure 4 may be<br>
attached to the front face of the PF 34. In any of the above mentioned<br>
embodiments, exhaust passing through the PF 34 carries thermal energy<br>
generated at the front face of the PF 34 a short distance down the channels 50,<br>
52.   The increased thermal energy ignites particulate matter present near the<br>
8<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
inlet of the PF 34. The heat generated from the combustion of the particulates is<br>
then directed through the PF 34 to induce combustion of the remaining<br>
particulates within the PF 34.<br>
[0029] With particular reference to Figure 5, a thermally conductive<br>
coating 72 can be additionally applied at the inlets 62 of the channels 50, 52.<br>
The coating 72 can extend a short distance down the opened ends of the closed<br>
channels 50. In various embodiments, the conductive coating extends within an<br>
inch of the front face of the PF 34. The resistive material of the grid 64 contacts<br>
the conductive coating 72. Thermal energy is transferred to the conductive<br>
coating 72 when electrical energy passes through the resistive material. Heat<br>
from the conductive coating 72 ignites particulate matter present near the inlet of<br>
the PF 34.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 6, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of the particulate filter regeneration system that may be embedded<br>
within the control module 44. Various embodiments of particulate filter<br>
regeneration systems according to the present disclosure may include any<br>
number of sub-modules embedded within the control module 44. As can be<br>
appreciated, the sub-modules shown in Figure 6 may be combined and/or further<br>
partitioned to similarly control regeneration of the PF 34. Inputs to the system<br>
may be sensed from the vehicle 10 (Figure 1), received from other control<br>
modules (not shown) within the vehicle 10 (Figure 1), and/or determined by other<br>
sub-modules (not shown) within the control module 44. In various embodiments,<br>
the control module 44 of Figure 6 includes a regeneration control module 80, a<br>
9<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
grid temperature determination module 82, an engine control module 84, and a<br>
propagation module 86.<br>
[0031] The regeneration control module 80 receives as input an<br>
accumulation level of particulate matter present in the PF 34 (Figure 1), referred<br>
to as a particulate matter level 88, a grid temperature 90, an engine status 92,<br>
and a propagation status 94. Based on the particulate matter level 88, the<br>
regeneration control module 80 determines whether regeneration is desired and<br>
sets a regeneration status 96 accordingly. Once the engine status 92 indicates<br>
that the engine 12 (Figure 1) is OFF (as will be discussed in more detail below),<br>
the regeneration control module 80 controls current to the PF 34 (Figure 1) via a<br>
current control signal 98 and the regeneration status 96 is set to indicate that<br>
regeneration has begun. Once the grid temperature 90 exceeds a threshold<br>
temperature, the regeneration control module 80 stops the flow of current to the<br>
PF 34 (Figure 1) via the current control signal 98 and the regeneration status 96<br>
is set to indicate that temperature control of the grid 64 (Figure 2) has completed.<br>
Once the propagation status 94 indicates that regeneration is complete, the<br>
regeneration control module 80 sets the regeneration status 96 to indicate that<br>
regeneration is complete. In various embodiments, the regeneration status 96 is<br>
an enumeration with values representing, for example, 'regeneration desired,'<br>
'regeneration begun,' 'regeneration grid temperature control complete,' and<br>
'regeneration complete.'<br>
[0032] The grid temperature determination module 82 receives as input<br>
a current and/or a voltage signal 100 and the regeneration status 96.  Based on<br>
10<br><br>
GM, Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
the current and/or the voltage signal 100 the grid temperature 90 module<br>
estimates the temperature of the grid 64 (Figure 2) once the regeneration status<br>
96 indicates that regeneration has begun.<br>
[0033] The engine control module 84 receives as input the<br>
regeneration status 96. Based on the regeneration status 96, the engine control<br>
module 84 controls the engine 12 (Figure 1) to be either ON or OFF via engine<br>
parameters 102. For example, when the regeneration status 96 indicates that<br>
the regeneration grid temperature control is complete, the engine control module<br>
84 controls the engine 12 (Figure 1) to be ON and in particular, controls the<br>
exhaust flow and exhaust temperature via the engine parameters 102. Based on<br>
whether the engine 12 (Figure 1) is ON or OFF, the engine control module 84<br>
sets the engine status 92 accordingly. For example, if the engine 12 (Figure 1) is<br>
operating, the engine status 92 is set to TRUE. If the engine 12 (Figure 1) is not<br>
operating, the engine status 92 is set to FALSE.<br>
[0034] The propagation module 86 receives as input an exhaust<br>
temperature 104, the grid temperature 90, an oxygen level 106, an exhaust flow<br>
108, and a particulate matter level 88. Based on at least one of the exhaust<br>
temperature 104, the grid temperature 90, the particulate matter level 88, and the<br>
oxygen level 106, the propagation module 86 estimates a combustion<br>
temperature of the particulate matter in the PF 34 (Figure 1). Using the<br>
particulate matter combustion temperature and the exhaust flow 108, the<br>
propagation module 86 determines the propagation status 94 of the combustion<br>
and thus, determines whether the combustion has completed.   For example, if<br>
11<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
the regeneration has completed, the propagation status 94 is set to TRUE.<br>
Otherwise, if the regeneration has not completed, the propagation status 94 is<br>
set to FALSE.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Figure 7, a flowchart illustrates an exemplary<br>
particulate filter regeneration method that can be performed by the particulate<br>
regeneration system of Figure 6 in accordance with various aspects of the<br>
present disclosure. As can be appreciated, the order of execution of the steps of<br>
the exemplary particulate filter regeneration method can vary without altering the<br>
spirit of the method. The exemplary particulate filter regeneration method may<br>
be performed periodically during control module operation or scheduled to run<br>
based on certain events.<br>
[0036] In one example, the method may begin at 200. The need for<br>
regeneration is evaluated at 210. If regeneration is desired at 210, the engine<br>
status 92 is evaluated at 220. Otherwise, if regeneration is not desired at 210,<br>
the method may end at 290. If the engine status 92 indicates that the engine 12<br>
(Figure 1) is OFF at 220, current is controlled to the PF 34 (Figure 1) to initiate<br>
combustion of the particulate matter present near the face of the PF 34 (Figure 1)<br>
at 230. Otherwise, if the engine 12 (Figure 1) is ON at 220, the method may end<br>
at 290.<br>
[0037] Once current is controlled to the PF 34 (Figure 1) at 230, the<br>
grid temperature 90 is monitored at 240. In various embodiments, the grid<br>
temperature 90 is estimated as discussed above. If the grid temperature 90<br>
exceeds a predetermined threshold at 240, current to the PF 34 is turned off at<br>
12<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309163-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000480<br>
250 and the engine 12 (Figure 1) is started at 260. While the engine 12 (Figure<br>
1) is operating, the exhaust flow is controlled at 270 until regeneration is<br>
complete at 280. Thereafter, the method may end at 290.<br>
[0038] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
