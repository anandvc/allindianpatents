				<td>Production of Humanized Antibodies In Transgank Animals<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to humanized antibodies produced from transgenic non-human animals. The non-human animals are genetically engineered to contain one or more humanized immunoglobulin loci which are capable of undergoing gene rearrangement and gene conversion in the transgenic non-human animals to produce diversified humanized immunoglobulins. The present invention former relates to novel sequences, recombination vectors and transgenic vectors useful for making those transgenic animals. The humanized antibodies of the present invention have minimal immunogeiricity to humans and are appropriate for use in the therapeutic treatment of human subjects.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The therapy of infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, virus and parasites is largely based on chemotherapy. However, the emergence of drug-resistant organisms requires the continuous development of new antibiotics. Therapies of patients with malignancies and cancer are also based on chemotherapy. However, many of these therapies are ineffective and the mortidity of diseased patients is high. For both infectious diseases and cancer, improved and innovative therapies are needed. Therapy of steroid resistant rejection of transplanted organs requires the use of biological reagents (monoclonal or polyclonal antibody preparations) that reverse the ongoing alloimmune response in the transplant recipient The major problem of antibody preparations obtained from animals is the intrinsic immunogenicity of non-human immunoglobulins in human patients. In order to reduce the immunogenicity of non-human antibodies, genetic engineering of individual antibody genes in animals has been proposed. In particular, it has been shown that by fusing animal variable (V) region exons with human constant (C) region exons, a chimeric antibody gene can be obtained. However, this approach may only eliminate the immunogenicity caused by the non-human<br><br>
Fc region, while the remaining non-human Fab sequences may still be immunogenic. In another approach, human immunoglobulin genes for both, heavy and light chain immunoglobulins have been introduced into the genome of mice. While this genetic engineering approach resulted in the expression of human immunoglobulin polypcptidcs in genetically engineered mice, the level of human immunoglobulin expression is low. This may be due to species-specific regulatory elements in the immunoglobulin loci that are necessary for efficient expression of immunoglobulins. As demonstrated in transfected cell lines, regulatory elements present in human immunoglobulin genes may not function properly in non-human animals.<br>
Several regulatory elements in immunoglobulin genes have been described. Of particular importance are enhancers downstream (3*) of heavy chain constant regions and intronic enhancers hi light chain genes. In addition, other, yet to be identified, control elements may be present in immunoglobulin genes. Studies in mice have shown that the membrane and cytoplasmic tail of the membrane form of immunoglobulin molecules play an important role in expression levels of human-mouse chimerk antibodies in the serum of mice homozygous for the human Cyl gene. Therefore, for the expression of heterologous immunoglobulin genes in animals it is desirable to replace sequences that contain enhancer elements and exons encoding transmembrane (Ml exon) and cytoplasmic tail (M2 exon) with sequences that are normally found in the animal in similar positions.<br>
The introduction of human irnmunoglobuHn genes into the genome of mice . resulted in expression of a diversified human antibody repertoire in genetically engineered mice. En both mice and humans, antibody diversity is generated by gene rearrangement. This process results in the generation of many different recombined V(D)J segments encoding a large number of antibody molecules with different antigen binding sites. However, In other animals, like rabbits, pigs, cows and birds, antibody diversity is generated by a substantially different mechanism called gene conversion. For example, it is well established (hat in rabbh and chicken, VDJ rearrangement is vary limited (almost 90% of immunoglobulin is generated with the 3'proximal VH1 element) and antibody diversity is generated by gene conversion and hypermutation. In contrast, mouse and<br><br>
human gene conversion occurs very rarely, if at all. Therefore, it is expected that in animals that diversify antibodies by gene conversion a genetic engineering approach based on gene rearrangement will result in animals with low antibody titers and limited antibody diversity. Thus, the genetic engineering of large animals for the production of non-immunogenic antibody preparations for human therapy requires alternative genetic engineering strategies.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides humanized immunoglobuUns (antibodies).<br><br>
By "a humanized antibody" or "a humanized immunogtobulin" is meant an immimoglobulin molecule having at least a portion of a human trnmunogkibulin polypeptide sequence (or a polypeptide sequence encoded by a human Ig gene segment). The humanized immunoglobulin molecules of me present invention can be isolated from a transgenic non-human animal engineered to produce humanized immunoglobulin molecules. Such humanized immunoglobulin molecules are less immunogenic to primates, especially humans, relative to non-humanized immunoglobulin molecules prepared from the animal or prepared from cells derived from the animal.<br>
The term "non-human animals" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, rabbits, pigs, birds (e.g., chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and the like), sheep, goats, cows and horses. Preferred non-human animals are those animals which rely primarily on gene conversion and/or somatic hypo-mutation to generate antibody diversity, e.g.3 rabbit, pigs, birds (e.g., chicken, turkey, duck, goose and the like), sheep, goat, and cow. Particularly preferred non-human animals are rabbit and chicken.<br>
In animals such as human and mouse, there are multiple copies of V, D and J gene segments on the heavy chain locus, and multiple copies of V and J gene segments on a light chain locus. Antibody diversity in these animals is generated primarily by gene rearrangement, i.e., different combinations of gene segments to form rearranged heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region. In other animals (e.g., rabbit, chicken, sheep, goat, and cow), however, gene rearrangement does not play a significant role in the generation of antibody diversity, For example, in rabbit, only a very limited number of the V gene segments, most often the V gene segments at the 3' end of the V-region, are used in gene rearrangement to form a contiguous VDJ segment In chicken, on! y one V gene segment (the one adjacent to the D region, or "the 3' proximal V gene segment*), one D segment and one J segment are used in the heavy chain rearrangement; and only one V gene segment (the 3' proximal V segment) and one J segment are used in the light chain rearrangement. Thus, in these animals, there is little diversity among initially rearranged variable region sequences resulting from junctional diversification. Further diversification of the rearranged Ig genes is achieved by gene conversion, a<br><br>
process in which short sequences derived from the upstream V gene segments replace short sequences within the V gene segment in the rearranged Ig gene.<br>
The term "Ig gene segment" as used herein refers to segments of DNA encoding various portions of an Ig molecule, which are present in the germline of animals and humans, and which are brought together in B cells to form rearranged Ig genes. Thus, [g gene segments as used herein include V gene segments, D gene segments, J gene segments and C region gene segments.<br>
The term "human Ig gene segment" as used herein includes both naturally occurring sequences of a human Ig gene segment, degenerate forms of naturally occurring sequences of a human Ig gene segment, as well as synthetic sequences that encode a polypeptide sequence substantially identical to the polypeptide encoded by a naturally occurring sequence of a human Ig geno segment By "substantially" is meant that the degree of amino acid sequence identity is at least about 85%-95%.<br>
A preferred humanized immunoglobulin molecule of the present invention lontains at least a portion of a human heavy or light chain constant region polypeptide sequence. A more preferred immunoglobulin molecule contains at least a portion of a Iwman heavy or light chain constant region polypeptide sequence, and at least a portion of i human variable domain polypeptide sequence.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a preparation of humanized antibodies is provided.<br>
By "a preparation of humanized antibodies" or "a humanized antibody ^reparation" is meant an isolated antibody product or a purified antibody product prepared from a transgenic non-human animal (e.g., serum, milk, or egg yolk of the animal) or from :ells derived from a transgenic non-human animal (e.g., a B-cell or a hybtidoma cell).<br>
A humanized antibody preparation can be a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, which includes a repertoire of humanized immunoglobulin molecules. A humanized antibody preparation can also be a preparation of a monoclonal antibody.<br>
Although the immunogenicity to humans of a humanized monoclonal antibody preparation is also reduced as compared to anon-humanized monoclonal antibody preparation, humanized polyclonal antibody preparations are preferred embodiments of<br><br>
the present invention. It has been recognized that humanized monoclonal antibodies still invoke some degree of an immune response (an anti-idiotype response) in primates (e.g., humans) when administered repeatedly in large quantities because of the unique and novel idiotype of the monoclonal antibody. The present inventors have uniquely recognized that the overall immunogenicity of polyclonal antibodies is less dependent on an anti-idiotype response. For example, polyclonal antibodies made from non-human animals with only the constant region elements humanized (e.g., polyclonal antibodies having constant regions encoded by human gene segments, and having variable domains encoded by the endogenous genes of the non-human animal), are substantially non-irnmunogenic to primates.<br>
Without intending to be bound to any theory, the present inventors have proposed that the reduced immunogenicity of such a humanized polyolonal antibody preparation is due to the fact that the preparation contains a very large number of different antibodies with many different idiotypes which are to a large extent defined by novel ammo acid sequeaces in the camplimentarity determining regions (CDR) of the heavy and light chain. Therefore, upon administration of such preparation into a primate such BE a human, the administered amount of each individual immunoglobulin molecule hi the preparation may be too low to solicit immune response against each immunoglobulin molecule. Thus, the humanized polyclonal antibody preparation which has many different idiotypes and variable regions has minimal immunogenicity to a recipient, even if the antibodies In the polyclonal antibody preparation are all directed to the same antigen. To further reduce any potential residual immunogenicity, a humanized polyclonal antibody preparation may be prepared which is composed of immunoglobulin molecules having both the variable domains and the constant regions encoded by human Ig gene segments.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody preparation which Includes humanized immunoglobulin molecules having at least a portion of a human heavy or light chain constant region polypcptkk sequence. More preferably, the humanized immunoglobulines in the antibody preparation of the present invention further contain at least a portion of a human variable domain polypeptide<br><br>
sequence, in addition to at least a portion of a human constant region polypeptide sequence.<br>
Preferred humanized antibody preparations of the present invention are composed of humanized antibodies made fiom transgenic non-human animals whose antibody diversity is generated primarily by gene conversion, such as rabbit, birds (e.g., chicken, turkey, duck, goose and the like), sheep, goat, and cow; preferably, rabbit and chicken.<br>
Once a transgenic non-human animal capable of producing diversified humanized immunoglobulin molecules is made (as farther set forth below), humanized iramunoglobulins and humanized antibody preparations against an antigen can be readily obtained by immunizing the animal with the antigen. A variety of antigens can be used to immunize a transgenic host animal. Such antigens include, microorganism, «.g. viruses and unicellular organisms (such as bacteria and fungi), alive, attenuated or dead, fragments of the microorganisms, or antigenic molecules isolated fiom the microorganisms.<br>
Preferred bacterial antigens for use in immunizing an animal include purified antigens from Staphylococcus aureus such as capsular polysaccbarides type S and 8, recombtnant versions of virulence factors such as alpha-toxin, adhesin binding proteins, collagen binding proteins, and fibronectin binding proteins. Preferred bacterial antigens also include an attenuated version of &amp; aweus, Psevdomonas aerugtnosa, enterdcoccus. enterobacter, and Kkbsiellapneumoniae, or culture supernatant fiom these bacteria cells. Other bacterial antigens which can be used in immunization include purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), capsular antigens, capsular polysaocharides and/or recombtaant versions of the outer membrane proteins, fibronectin binding proteins, endotoxin, and exotoxin from Pseudomonas aaruginosa, enterococcus, enterobacter, and KlcbsieUa pneumoniae.<br>
Preferred antigens for the generation of antibodies against fungi include attenuated version of flingi or outer membrane proteins thereof, which fungi include, but are not limited to, Candida albicans, Candida parepsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and CryptoooccuB neoformans.<br><br>
Preferred antigens for use in immunization in order to generate antibodies against viruses include the envelop proteins and attenuated versions of viruses which include, but are not limited to respiratory synctial virus (RSV) (particularly the F-Protein), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatfts B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), EB V, and HSV.<br>
Therapeutic antibodies can be generated for the treatment of cancer by immunizing transgcnic animals with isolated tumor cells or tumor cell lines, tumor-associated antigens which include, but are not limited to, Her-2-neu antigen (antibodies against which are useful for the treatment of breast cancer); CD20, CD22 and CD53 antigens (antibodies against which are useful for the treatment of B cell lymphomas), (3) prostate specific membrane antigen (PMSA) (antibodies against which are useful for the treatment of prostate cancer), and 17-1A molecule (antibodies against which are useful for the treatment of colon cancer).<br>
The antigens can be administered to a transgenic host animal in any convenient manner, with or without an adjuvant, and can be administered in accordance with a predetermined schedule.<br>
After immunization, serum ex* milk from the immunized transgenic animals can be fractionated for the purification of pharmaceutical grade polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. In the case of transgenic birds, antibodies can also be made by fractionating egg yolks. A concentrated, purified immunoglobulin fraction may be obtained by chromatography (affinity, ionic exchange, gel filtration, etc,), selective precipitation with salts such as ammonium sulfatc, organic solvents such as ethanol, or polymers such aspolyethylcneglycoL<br>
For making a monoclonal antibody, spleen cells are isolated from the immunized transgenic animal and used either in cell fusion with transformed cell lines for the production of hybridomes, or cDNAs encoding antibodies are cloned by standard molecular biology techniques and expressed in transfected cells. The procedures for making monoclonal antibodies are well established in the art. See, e.g., European Patent Application 0 583 980 Al ("Method For Generating Monoclonal Antibodies From Rabbits"), U.S. Patent No. 4,977,081 ("Stable Rabbit-Mouse Hybridomas And Secretion<br><br>
Products Thereof), WO 97/16537 ("Stable Chicken B-cell Line And Method of Use Thereof), and EP 0 491 057 Bl ("Hybridoma Which Produces Avian Specific Immunogiobulin 0"), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In vitro production of monoclonal antibodies from cloned cDNA molecules has been described by Andris-Widhopf et ah, "Methods for the generation of chicken monoclonal antibody fragments by phage display", Jlmmunol Methods 242:159 (2000), and by Burton, D. R., "Phage display", bmwnottehnology 1:87 (1995), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, purified monoclonal or poJyclonal antibodies are admixed with an appropriate pharmaceutical carrier suitable for administration in primates especially humans, to provide pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which can be employed in the present pharmaceutical compositions can beany and all solvents, dispersion media, botonic agents and the like. Except insofar as any conventional media, agent, diluent or carrier Is detrimental to the recipient or to the therapeutic effectiveness of the antibodies contained therein, its use in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is appropriate. The carrier can be liquid, semi-solid, e.g. pastes, or solid carriers. Examples of carriers include oils, water, saline solutions, alcohol, sugar, gel, lipids, liposomes, resins, porous matrices, binders, fillers, coatings, preservatives and the like, or combinations thereof<br>
The present invention is further directed to novel nucleotide sequences and vectors, as well as the use of the sequences and vectors in making a tnmsgenic non-human animal which produces humanized Immunoglobulins.<br>
In genera], the genetic engineering of a non-human animal involves the integration of one or more human Ig gene segments into the animal's genome to create one or more humanized Ig loci. It should be recognized that, depending upon the approach used in the genetic modification, a human Ig gene segment can be integrated at the endogenous Ig locus of the animal (as a result of targeted insertion, for example), or at a different locus of the animal. In other words, a humanized Ig locus can reside at the chromosomal location where the endogenous Ig locus of the animal ordinarily resides, or at a chromosomal location other than where the endogenous Ig locus of the animal<br><br>
ordinarily resides. Regardless of the chromosomal location, a humanized Ig locus of the present invention has the capacity to undergo gene rearrangement and gene conversion in the non-human animal thereby producing a diversified repertoire of humanized immunoglobulin molecules. An Ig locus having the capacity to undergo gene rearrangement and gene conversion is also referred to herein as a "functional" Ig locus, and the antibodies with .a diversity generated by a functional Ig locus are also referred to herein as "functional" antibodies or a "functional" repertoire of antibodies.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides novel sequences useful for creating a humanized Ig locus and making transgenic animals capable of producing humanized immunoglobulin molecules, in particular, the present invention provides sequences from tbe 5' and 3* flanking regions of the Ig gene segments of non-human animals, preferably, animals which rely primarily on gene conversion in generating antibody diversity (e.g., rabbit, pigs, sheep, goat, cow, birds such as chicken, turkey, duck, goose, and the like).<br>
The 5* and 3' flanking regions of the genes coding for the constant region are particularly important as these sequences contain untranslated regulatory elements (e.g., enhancers) critical for high Ig expression in the serum. The 3* flanking region of the genes coding for the constant region of me heavy chain also contain exons coding for the membranous and cytoplasmic tail of the membrane form of immunoglobulin (Volgma et al. JJmmiatoI 165:6400,2000). It has been previously established that the membrane and cytoplasmic tail of the membrane form of antibodies are critical in achieving a high level of expression of the antibodies in mice sera (Zou et al,, Science 262:1271,1993). Thus, the identification of the flanking sequences permits the replacement of exons and intervening introns of the Cy gene with the human equivalent, and the maintenance of the endogenous exons encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail regions as well as the endogenous non-coding enhancer sequences.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides 3' flanking sequences of heavy chain constant regions of non-human animals. More particularly, nucleotide sequences downstream (31,3-prime) of the genes coding for rabbit Of, cow Cy 1,2,3, and sheep Cyl,2 are provided. Especially preferred nucleotide sequences include SEQ ID NO:<br><br>
10 (3' of Mtbbit Cy), SEQ ID NOS: 3-5 (3' of cow Cyl A3), and SEQ ID NOS: 8-9 (31 of sheep Cyl,2).<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides 3' flanking sequences of Hght chain constant regions of non-human animals. More particularly, the present invention provides nuclcotide sequences downstream (31,3-prime) of the genes coding for CK in rabbits. Especially preferred nucleotide sequences include SEQ ID NO: 11 (3* of rabbit CK).<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention provides 5* flanking sequences of heavy chain constant regions of non-human animals. More particularly, ttucleoUde sequences upstream (5', 5-prime) of the rabbit Oy gene are provided. Especially preferred sequences include SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 13.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides 5' flanking sequences of light chain constant regions of non-human animals.<br>
Portions of the above novel flanking sequences are provided by the present invention. By "a portion" is meant a fragment of a flanking nucleotide sequence capable of mediating homologous recombination between the human Ig gene segment and the target animal Ig gene segment. Generally, a portion is at least about 200 base pairs, preferably, at least about 400 base pairs, for recombination in animal cells such as ES cells or fibroblasts, and at least about 40 base pairs, preferably at least about 50 base pairs, for recombination in E. coli. Examples of portions of the above novel flanking sequences include SEQ ID NOS: 59-60,61-62,63-64, 65-66, 67-68 and 69-70 (represented by the underlined sequences in Figures 8-12 and 14, respectively).<br>
In a further aspect, (he present invention provides vectors useful for the replacement of an Ig gene segment of a non-human animal with the corresponding human Ig gene segment These vectors, also referred to herein as "recombination vectors", include a human Ig gene segment which is linked to flanking sequences at the 5' end and the 3' end, wherein the flanking sequences have a degree of homology with the flanking sequences of the target animal Ig gene segment sufficient to mediate homologous recombination between the human gene and the animal gene segments. Generally, at least about 200 bases should be identical between the flanking regions in a recombination<br><br>
vector and the flanking regions of the target gene to achieve efficient homologous recombination in animal cells such as BS cells and fibroblasts: and at least about 40 bases should be identical to achieve efficient homologous recombination in E. coli.<br>
Recombination vectors useful for replacing the animal's immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region genes are provided, which contain from 5' to 3', a nucleotide sequence homologous to the 5' flanking region of the target animal heavy chain constant region gene, a human heavy chain constant region gene (e.g., human Cyl), and a nucleotide sequence homologous to the 3' flanking region of the target animal heavy chain constant region gene.<br>
Preferred recombination vectors ate provided tor the replacement of the rabbit heavy chain constant region genes. One such vector contains from 5' to 3', a nuclootide sequence as sot forth in SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 13 or a portion thereof, a human heavy chain constant region gene segment, a nucleotide sequence as set form in SEQ ED NO: 10 or a portion of or SEQ ID NO: 10. Another such vector contains SEQ ID NO: 51 (Figure 8) which is characterized as having a human Cyl gene linked to flanking sequences from the 5' and 3* flanking regions of a rabbit heavy chain constant region gene.<br>
Recombination vectors are also provided which are useful for replacing the animal's Immunoglobulin light chain constant region genes. Such vectors contain from 5' to 3*, a nucleotide sequence homologous to the 5' flanking region of the target light chain constant region gene, a human light chain constant region gene (e.g., human Ctc or CX), and a nucleotide sequence homologous to the 3' flanking region of the target light chain constant region gene.<br>
Preferred vectors include those useful for replacing the rabbit light chain constant region genes. A preferred vector contains a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 53, which sequence is characterized as having a human CK linked to flanking sequences from the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the rabbit light chain CK! gene.<br>

The recombination vectors of the present invention can include additional sequences that facilitate the selection of cells which have undergone a successful recombination event. For example, marker genes coding for resistance to neomyoin, bleomycin, puromycin and the like can be included in the recombination vectors to facilitate the selection of cells which have undergone a successful recombination event.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, transgenlc constructs or vectors carrying one or more humanized Ig loci are provided<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides transgenic constructs containing a humanized Ig heavy chain locus which includes one or more V gene segments, one or more D gene segments, one or more J gene segments, and one or more constant region gene segments, wherein at least one gene segment is a human heavy chain gene segment The gene segments in such humanized heavy chain locus are juxtaposed wit respect to each other in an unrearranged configuration (or "the germline configuration"), or in a partially or fully rearranged configuration. The humanized heavy chain locus has the capacity to undergo gene rearrangement (if the gene segments are not fully rearranged) and gene conversion in the non-human animal thereby producing a diversified repertoire of heavy chains having human polypeptide sequences, or "humanized heavy chains".<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the humanized heavy chain locus contains at least one C-region gene segment that is a human constant region gene segment, preferably,-Ca or Cy (Including any of the Oy subclasses 1,2,3 and 4).<br>
In another more preferred embodiment, the humanized heavy chain locus of the transgene contains a humanized V»region end a humanized C-region, i.e., a V-region having at least one human VH gene segment and a C-region having at least one human C gene segment (e.g., human Ca or Cy).<br>
Preferably, tfae humanized Vnregion includes at feast about 10-100 heavy chain V (or "VH") gene segments, at least one of which is a human VH gene segment In accordance with the present invention, the human VH gene segment included in the<br><br>
transgene shares at least about 75% to about 85% homology to the VH gene segments of the host animal, particularly those animal VH gene segments included in the upstream region of the transgene. As described above, a human VH segment encompasses naturally occurring sequences of a human VH gene segment, degenerate forms of naturally occurring sequences of a human VHgene segment, as well as synthetic sequences that encode a polypeptide sequence substantially (i.e., at least about 85%-9S%) identical to a human heavy chain V domain polypeptide.<br>
Preferably, the human VH gene segments) is placed downstream of the non-human VH segments in the transgene locus. Preferably, the non-human VH gene segments in the transgene are the VH gene segments from the 3' VH-region in the Ig locus of the host animal, including the 3' proximal VH1.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides tranegenic constructs containing a humanized light chain locus capable of undergoing gene rearrangement and gene conversion in the host animal thereby producing a diversified repertoire of light chains having human polypeptide sequences, or "humanized light chains".<br>
The humanized light locus includes one or more V gene segments, one or more J gene segments, and one or more constant region gene segments, wherein at least one gene segment is a human light chain gene segment. The gene segments in the humanized light chain locus ere juxtaposed in an unrearranged configuration (or "the gennline configuration"), or fully rearranged configuration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the humanized light chain locus contains at least one C-region gene segment thai is a human constant region gene segment, preferably, CX orCjc,<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the humanized light chain locus of die transgene contains a humanbed V-region and a humanized C-region, e.g., a V-region having at least one human VL gene and/or at least one rearranged human VJ segment, and a C-region having at least one human C gene segment (e.g., human CX or CK).<br>
Preferably, the humanized V-region includes at least about 10*100 light chain V (or "VL") gene segments, at least one of which is a human VL gene segment The human VL gene segment included in the transgene shares at least about 75% to about 85%<br><br>
homology to the VL gene segments of the host animal, particularly those animal VL gene segments included in the upstream region of the transgene. Consistently, a human VL segment encompasses naturally occurring sequences of a human VL gene segment, degenerate forms of naturally occurring sequences of a human VL gene segment, as well as synthetic sequences that encode apolypeptide sequence substantially (i.e., at least about 85%-95%) Identical to a human light chain V domain polypeptlde,<br>
Preferably, the human VL gene segments) is pieced downstream of the non-human VL segments in the transgene locus. The non-human VL gene segments in the transgene construct are selected from the VL gene segments in the 3'VL-region in the light chain locus of the host animal, including the 3' proximal VL1.<br>
In still another preferred embodiment, the humanized light chain locus includes a rearranged human VJ segment, placed downstream of a number of (e.g., 10-100) VL gene segments of either non-human or human origin.<br>
Another aspect of ate present invention is directed to methods of making a transgenic vector containing a humanized Ig locus. Such methods involve isolating an Ig locus or a portion thereof from a non-human animal, and insetting the desired human Ig gene segment(s) into the isolated animal Ig locus or the isolated portion of an animal Ig locus. The human Ig gene segments) are inserted into the isolated animal Ig locus or a portion thereof by ligation or homologous recombination in such a way as to retain the capacity of the locus of undergoing effective gene rearrangement and gene conversion in the non-human animal.<br>
Preferably, DNA fragments containing an Ig locus to be humanized are isolated from animals which generate antibody diversity by gene conversion, e.g., rabbit and chicken. Such large DNA fragments can be isolated by screening a library of piasmids, cosmids, YACs or BACs, and the like, prepared from the genomic DNA of the non-human animal. An entire animal C-region can be contained hi one plasmid or cosmid clone which is subsequently subjected to humatiization. YAC clones can carry DNA fragments of up to 2 mcgabascs, thus an entire animal heavy chain locus or a large portion thereof can be isolated in one YAC clone, or reconstructed to be contained in one YAC clone. BAC clones are capable of carrying DNA fragments of smaller sizes (about ISO-<br><br>
250 kb), However, multiple BAC clones containing overlapping fragments of an Ig locus can be separately humanized and subsequently injected together into an animal recipient cell, wherein die overlapping fragments reoombine in the recipient animal cell to generate a continuous Ig locus.<br>
Human Ig gone segments can be integrated into the Ig locus on a vector (e.g., a BAC clone) by a variety of methods, including ligation of DNA fragments, or insertion of DNA fragments by homologous recombination. Integration of the human Ig gene segments is done in such a way that the human Ig gene segment is operably linked to the host animal sequence in the transgene to produce a functional humanized Ig locus, i.e., an Ig locus capable of gene rearrangement and gene conversion which lead to the production of a diversified repertoire of humanized antibodies.<br>
Preferably, human Ig gene segments are integrated into the Ig locus by homologous recombination. Homologous recombination can be performed in bacteria, yeast and other cells with a high frequency of homologous recombination events. For example, a yeast cell is transformed with a YAC containing an animal's Ig locus or a large portion thereof. Subsequently, such yeast cell is further transformed with a recombination vector as described hereinabove, which carries a human Ig gene segment linked to a 5' flanking sequence and a 3* flanking sequence. The 5' and the 3' flanking sequences in the recombination vector are homologous to those flanking sequences of the animal Ig gene segment on the YAC. As a result of a homologous recombination, the animal Ig gene segment on the YAC is replaced with the human Ig gene segment. Alternatively, a bacterial cell such as E. coli is transformed with a BAC containing an animal's Ig locus or a large portion thereof. Such bacterial cell is further transformed with a recombination vector which carries a human Ig gene segment linked to a 5' flanking sequence and a 3' flanking sequence. The 5' and the 3* flanking sequences in the recombination vector mediate homologous recombination and exchange between the human Ig gene segment on the recombination .vector and the animal Ig gene segment on the BAC. Humanized YACs and BACs can be readily isolated from the cells and used in making transgenic animals.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, methods of making transgenic animals capable of producing humanized immunoglobulms are provided.<br><br>
According to the present invention, a transgenic animal capable of making humanized immunoglobulins ere made by introducing into a recipient cell or cells of an animal one or more of the transgenic vectors described herein above which carry a humanized Ig locus, and deriving an animal from the genetically modified recipient cell or cells.<br>
Preferably, the recipient cells are from non-human animals which generate antibody diversity by gene conversion and hypermutation, e.g., bird (such as chicken), rabbit, cows and the lite. In such animals, the 3'proximal V gene segment is preferentially used for the production of immunoglobulins. Integration of a human V gene segment into the Ig locus on the transgene vector, either by replacing the 3'proximal V gene segment of the animal or by being placed hi close proximity of the 3'proximal V gene segment, results in expression of human V region polypeptide sequences in the majority of immunoglobulins. Alternatively, a rearranged human V(D)J segment may be inserted into die J locus of the immunoglobulin locus on file tomsgene vector.<br>
The transgenic vectors containing a humanized Ig locus is introduced into the recipient cell or cells and then integrated into the genome of the recipient cell or cells by random integration or by targeted integration.<br>
For random Integration, a transgenic vector containing a humanized Ig locus can be Introduced into an animal recipient cell by standard transgenic technology. For example, a transgenic vector can be directly injected into the pronucleus of a fertilized oocyte. A transgenic vector can also be introduced by co-incubation of sperm with the transgenic vector before fertilization of the oocyte. Transgenic animals can be developed from fertilized oocytes. Another way to introduce a transgenic vector is by transfecting embryonic stem cells and subsequently injecting the genetically modified embryonic stem cells into developing embryos. Alternatively, a transgenic vector (naked or in combination with facilitating reagents) can be directly injected into a developing embryo. Ultimately, chimeric transgenic animals are produced from the embryos which contain the humanized Ig transgene integrated in the genome of at least some somatic cells of the transgenic animal.<br><br>
in a preferred embodiment, a transgene containing a humanized Ig locus is randomly integrated into the genome of recipient cells (such as fertilized oocyte or developing embryos) derived from animal strains with an unpaired expression of endogenous inrmunoglobulin genes. The use of such animal strains permits preferential expression of immunoglobulin molecules from the humanized transgenio Ig locus. Examples for such animals include the Alicia and Basilea rabbit strains, as well as Agammaglobinemic chicken strain. Alternatively, transgenic animals with humanized immunoglobulin transgenes or loci can be mated with animal strains with impaired expression of endogenous immunoglobulins. Offspring homozygous for an impaired endogenous Ig locus and a humanized transgenic Ig locus can be obtained.<br>
For targeted integration, a transgenic vector can be introduced into appropriate animal recipient cells such as embryonic stem cells or already differentiated somatic cells. Afterwards, cells in which the transgene has integrated into the animal genome and has replaced the corresponding endogenous Ig locus by homologous recombination can be selected by standard methods. The selected cells may then be fused with enucleated nuclear transfer unit cells, e.g. oocytes or embryonic stem cells, cells which are totipotent and capable of forming a functional neonate. Fusion is performed in accordance with conventional techniques which are well established. See, for example, Cibelli et al., Science (1998) 280:1256. Enucleation of oocytes and nuclear transfer can also be performed by microsurgery using injection pipettes. (See, for example, Wakayama et al., Nature (1998) 394:369.) The resulting egg cells are then cultivated in an appropriate medium, and transferred into synchronized recipients for generating transgenic animals. Alternatively, the selected genetically modified cells can be injected into developing embryos which are subsequently developed into chimeric animals.<br>
Further to the present invention, a transgenic animal capable of producing humanized immunoglobulins can also be made by introducing into a recipient cell or cells, one or more of the recombination vectors described herein above, which carry a human Ig gene segment, linked to 5' and 3' flanking sequences mat are homologous to the flanking sequences of the endogenous Ig gene segment, selecting cells in which the endogenous Ig<br><br>
gene segment is replaced by the human Ig gene segment by homologous recombination, and deriving an animal from the selected genetically modified recipient cell or cells.<br>
Similar to the target insertion of a transgenic vector, cells appropriate for use as recipient cells in this approach include embryonic stem cells or already differentiated somatic cells. A recombination vector carrying a human Ig gene segment can be introduced into such recipient cells by any feasible means, e.g., transfection. Afterwards, cells in which the human Ig gene segment has replaced the corresponding endogenous Ig gene segment by homologous recombination, can be selected by standard methods, These genetically modified cells can serve as nuclei donor cells in a nuclear transfer procedure for cloning a transgenic animal. Alternatively, the selected genetically modified embryonic stem cells can be injected into developing embryos which can be subsequently developed into chimeric animals.<br>
. Transgenic animeJs produced by any of the foregoing methods form another embodiment of the present invention. The transgenic animals have at least one, i.e., one or more, humanized Ig loci in the genome, from which a functional repertoire of humanized antibodies is produced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention provides transgenic rabbits having one or more humanized Ig loci in the genome. The transgenic rabbits of the present invention are capable of rearranging and gene converting the humanized Ig loci, and expressing a functional repertoire of humanized antibodies.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides transgenic chickens having one or more humanized Ig loci in the genome. The transgenic chickens of the present invention are capable of rearranging and gene converting the humanized Ig loci, and expressing a functional repertoire of humanized antibodies.<br>
Cells derived from the transgenic animals of the present invention, such as B cells or cell lines established from a transgenic animal immunized against an antigen, are also part of the present invention.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, methods are provided for treating a disease in a primate, in particular, a human subject, by administering a purified humanized<br><br>
antibody composition, preferably, a humanized polyclonal antibody composition, desirable for treating such disease.<br>
The humanized polydonal antibody compositions used for administration arc generally characterized by containing a polyclonal antibody population, having intmnnoglobulin concentrations from 0.1 to 100 mg/ml, more usually from 1 to 10 mg/ml. The antibody composition may contain immunoglobulins of various isotypes. Alternatively, the antibody composition may contain antibodies of only one isotype, or a number of selected isotypes.<br>
In most instances the antibody composition consists of unmodified immunoglobulins, i.e., humanized antibodies prepared from die animal without additional modification, e.g., by chemicals or enzymes. Alternatively, the hnmunoglobulin fraction may be subject to treatment such as enzymatic digestion (e.g. with pepsin, papain, plasmin, glycostdases, nucleates, etc.), heating, etc, and/or further fractionated.<br>
The antibody compositions generally are administered into the vascular system, conveniently intravenously by injection or infusion via a catheter implanted into an appropriate vein. The antibody composition is administered at an appropriate rate, generally ranging from about 10 minutes to about 24 hours, more commonly from about 30 minutes to about 6 hours, in accordance with the rate at which the liquid can be accepted by (he patient. Administration of the effective dosage may occur in a single infusion or in a series of infusions. Repeated infusions may be administered once a day, once a week once a month, or once every three months, depending on the half-life of the antibody preparation and the clinical indication. For applications on epithelial surfaces the antibody compositions are applied to the surface in need of treatment in an amount sufficient to provide the intended end result, and can be repeated as needed.<br>
The antibody compositions can be used to bind and neutralize antigenic entities in human body tissues that cause disease or that elicit undesired or abnormal immune responses. An "antigenic entity" is herein defined to encompass any soluble or cell-surface bound molecules Including proteins, as well as cells or infectious disease-causing organisms or agents that are at least capable of binding to an antibody and preferably are also capable of stimulating an immune response.<br><br>
Administration of an antibody composition against an infectious agent as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy results in elimination of infectious particles. A single administration of antibodies decreases the number of infectious particles generally 10 to 100 fold, more commonly more than 1000-fold. Similarly, antibody therapy in patients with a malignant disease employed as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy reduces the number of malignant cells generally 10 to 100 fold, or more than 1000-fold. Therapy may be repeated over an extended amount of time to assure the complete elimination of infectious particles, malignant cells, etc. In some instances, therapy with antibody preparations will be continued for extended periods of time in the absence of detectable amounts of infectious particles or undesirable cells. Similarly, the use of antibody therapy for the modulation of immune responses may consist of single or multiple administrations of therapeutic antibodies. Therapy may be continued for extended periods of time in the absence of any disease symptoms.<br>
The subject treatment may be employed in conjunction with chemotherapy at dosages sufficient to inhibit infectious disease or malignancies. In autoimmune disease patients or transplant recipients, antibody therapy may be employed in conjunction with immunosuppreasive therapy at dosages sufficient to inhibit immune reactions.<br>
The invention is further illustrated, but by no means limited, by the following examples.<br>

Example S Cloning of Rabbits<br>
Mature Dutch Belton rabbits are superovulated by subcutaneous injection of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) every 12 hours (0.3 mg x 2 and 0.4 mg x 4). Ovulation is induced by intravenous administration of 0.5 mg hiteinizing hormone (LH) 12 hours after the last FSH injection. Oocytes are recovered by ovidual flush 17 hours after LH injection. Oocytes are mechanically enucleated 16-19 hours after maturation. Chromosome removal is assessed with blsBENZIMIDE (HOECHST 33342, Sigma, St Louis, MO) dye under ultraviolet light Enucleated oocytes are fused with actively dividing fibroblasts by using one electrical pulse of 180 V/cm for 15 us (Electrocell Manipulator 200. Oenetronics, San Diego, CA). After 3-5 hours oocytes are chemically activated with calcium ionophore (6 uM) for 4 rain (# 407952, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 2 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP, Sigma) in CR2 medium (Specialty Media, Lavalett, NJ) with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free, Sigma) for 3 hours.

Segment Encoding a Human VH Domain Polypeptide Sequence<br>
The upstream and downstream regions (i.e., the 5' and 3' flanking regions) of the rabbit heavy chain Cy gene from an a2-allotypc rabbit were sequenced. A DNA fragment (SEQ ID NO: 51) is generated by PCR using overlapping ollgonucleotides wherein the DNA fragment contains from 5' to 3', a sequence derived from the 5' flanking region of the rabbit Cy gene, me human Cy I gene, and a sequence derived from the 3* flanking region of the rabbit Cy gene (Figure 8).<br>
A genoraic BAG library derived from an a2-aJlotype rabbit is generated by standard procedures and screened with probes specific for rabbit Cy. A BAG clone containing rabbit heavy chain gene segments is identified. The rabbit Cy gene on this BAG done is replaced with the human Cyl gene by homologous recombination in Kcoli using the DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO: 51 and thepET system. This replacement is accomplished by two consecutive recombination steps: first the rabbit Cy gene segment is replaced with a marker gene; then the marker gene is replaced tine human Cyl gene segment<br>
The modified BAG clone containing rabbit heavy chain genes and the inserted human Oyl gene is further modified by replacing the 3'proximal VH1 segment with a synthetic VH gene segment (Figure 9). This synthetic VH gene segment (SEQ ID NO: 52) Is made using overlapping oligonculeotides and includes a 51 flanking sequence, a 3' flanking sequence, and a sequence coding for a polypeptide nearly identical to the human unnwnoglobulin heavy chain variable domain polypeptide sequence described by Huang<br><br>
and Stellar (J. Immvnol 151:5290-5300,1993). The coding sequence of the synthetic VH gene segment is designed based on the published sequence of a rabbit VH1 gene («2, Knight and Becker, Cell 60:963-970,1990) and is more than 80% identical to rabbit VH gene segments. The 5' and the 3' flanking sequences in the synthetic VH segment are derived from the upstream and downstream regions of die a2-allotype rabbit VH1 gene. The synthetic VH gene of SEQ ID NO: 32 is used to replace the rabbit VH1 gene on the BAC clone by homologous recombination using the pET or the redcpy system. The modified BAC clone is amplified and purified using standard procedures.<br>

A DNA fragment (SEQ ID NO: S3) is generated by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides wherein the DNA fragment contains fiom 5' to 3', a sequence derived from the 5' flanking region of the rabbit Ocl gene, the human Ctrl gene, and a sequence derived from the 3' flanking region of the rabbit CK! gene (Figure 10).<br>
A genomic BAC library derived from a bS-allotype rabbit is generated by standard procedures and screened with probes specific for rabbit Gd. A BAC clone containing rabbit light chain gene segments is identified. The rabbit del gene on this BAC clone is replaced with the human Gel gene on the DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO: S3 by homologous recombination in E,coli using the pET or the redsfty system. This replacement is accomplished by two consecutive recombination steps: first the rabbit Cxi gene segment is replaced with a marker gene; then the marker gene is replaced the human CK! gene segment.<br>
The modified BAC clone containing rabbit light chain genes and the inserted human Ctcl gene is further modified by inserting a rearranged VJ DNA fragment into the<br><br>
J region of the rabbit light chain locus. The rearranged VJ DNA fragment encodes a human immunoglobulin variable domain polypeptide described by Pritsch et al. (Blood 82(10):3103-3112,1993) aid Uumer-Rieske et al. (Eur J. Immtmol. 22 (4), 1023-1029, 1992)) (Figure 7). The nuckotide sequence of the rearranged VJ fragment is designed to maximize the sequence homology at the nucleotide level to the rabbit Vkappa sequence published by Licberman et al (J. ImmunoL 133 (5), 2753-2756,1984). This rearranged VJ DNA sequence Is more than 80% identical with known rabbit VK genes. Using overlapping oiigonucleotides in PCR. the rearranged VJ DNA fragment is linked to a 5' and a 3' flanking sequence, resulting the DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO: 34 (Figure 11). The 5'flanking sequence is derived from 5* of a rabbit VK, the 3'fianking sequence is derived from 3' of rabbit 32. The DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO: 54 is subsequently inserted into the rabbit light chain locus by homologous recombination hi E. coli using the pET or the redEJfy system. The insertion is performed in such a way that (he rabbit light chain region containing the rabbit Viel gene segment, the rabbit Jl and J2 segments, and the sequences in between, is replaced with the rearranged VJ DNA fragment Again, this insertion is accomplished by replacement of the rabbit V to J region with a marker gene, followed by the replacement of the marker gene with the rearranged VJ DNA fragment The modified BAC clone is amplified and purified using standard procedures.<br>
Tramgenic Rabbits Expressing the Humanized Immunoglobulin Light and/or Heavy Chain Transgene<br>
Transgenic rabbits are generated as described by Fan et al. (Pathol, Int. 49: 583-594,1999). Briefly, female rabbits are superovulated using standard methods and mated with male rabbits. Pronuclear-stage zygotes are collected from oviduct and placed in an appropriate medium such as Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. The exogenous DNA (e.g., the humanized BAC clone from Example 4 and/or 5 which has been linearized prior to injection) is microinjected into the malepronucleus with the sid of a pair of manipulators. Morphological surviving zygotes<br><br>
are transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant rabbits. Pseudopregnancy is induced by the injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Between about 0.1-1% of the injected zygotes develop into live transgenic rabbits. Integration of the transgene in the genome IB confirmed by Southern blots analysis using a probe specific for the transgene.<br>
cDKA is prepared using RNA isolated from B cells (in blood, spleen and/or lymph nodes) of a transgenic rabbit. Primers specific for the human transgene (human CH gene segment or the synthetic humanized VH gene segment) are used to generate amplified products from cDNA. The observation of amplified products indicates that the transgene is rearranged in the transgenic animal and the rearranged transgene is transcribed in the animal. Amplified products are sequenced and the presence of donor sequences from upstream V genes indicates that the transgene introduced into the gcrmline of the animal undergoes gene conversion.<br>
The presence of antibodies containing human IgG and/or human kappa light chain antigenic determinants in the serum of transgenic founder rabbits is determined using an ELISA assay.<br>
Example 9<br>
Production of Humanized Antibodies From Tranagenic Rabbits with the Genetic Background of the Alicia and/or Basilea Rabbit Strain<br>
The Alicia strain lacks the VH1 gene segment and therefore has an impaired Ig heavy chain expression. Transgenic founder rabbits capable of expressing humanized heavy chain molecules in the genetic background of the Alicia rabbit straht are generated, e.g., by using fetal fibroblasts established tram Alicia rabbits in Examples 4-5 above, or by using zygotes from female Alicia rabbits mated with male Alicia rabbits in Example 8 above. Transgenic animals are also obtained which are homozygous for the Alicia Ig phendype and are also homozygous for a humanized heavy chain transgene. Serum is tested in ELISA for the presence of humanized heavy chain (e.g., a human heavy chain<br><br>
constant region). The concentration of antibodies with humanized Ig heavy chains in these homozygous Alicia animals is substantially higher, e.g., about 10 to 100 fold higher, than that produced from a transgene integrated in the genome of wild type (non-Alicia) rabbits.<br>
The Basilea strain does not express id light chain and in its place exclusively express the K2 and K light chains. Transgenic founder rabbits capable of expressing humanized light chain molecules in the genetic background of the Bastlea rabbit strain are generated, e.g., by using fetal fibrobJasts established from Basilea rabbits in Examples 4-5 above, or by using zygotes from female Basilea rabbits mated with male Basilea rabbits in Example 8 above, Transgenic animals are obtained which are homozygous for the Basilea light chain phenotype, and are also homozygous for a humanized light chain transgene. Serum is tested in ELISA for the presence of Hie humanized light chain. The concentration of the humanized light chain in the homozygous Basilea animals is substantially higher, about 10-100 fbld higher, than tfae concentration of a humanized light chain in a transgenic rabbit with the wild type (non-Basilea) genetic background. Traaagentc founder rabbits are mated with each other to generate transgenic rabbits with the following baits: (1) having at least one humanized light chain transgene, (2) having at least one humanized heavy chain transgene, (3) homozygous for the Alida heavy chain locus, and (4) homozygous for the Basilea light chain locus.<br>

A genomic BAC library derived from a jungle fowl chicken was screened with radiolabeled probes specific for chicken light chain Clambda and chicken Vpsi25 (the V gene segment at the very 5' end of the light chain locus). A BAC done containing the entire lambda light cfaain locus was identifled. The chicken CX gene on this BAC clone is replaced with the human CX2 gene by homologous recombination in E, colt using the pET system (Zhang et at, Nat.

A second DNA fragment (SEQ ID NO: 57) was synthesized using overlapping oligonucleotides wherein the DNA fragment contains from 3' to 3', a sequence derived from the 5' flanking region of the chicken light chain Clambda gene, the human Clambda2 gene, and a sequence derived from Hie 3' flanking region of the chicken Clambda gene (Figure 12),<br>
E. colt cells of the chicken light chain BAC clone were transformed with a recombination plasmid expressing the recE and recT functions under an biducible promoter. Cells transformed with the recombination plasmid were then transformed with the first DNA fragment above and selected afterwards hi media containing kanamycin. Clones resistant to kanamycin were identified, and the replacement of the chicken CX segment by the kanamycin selection cassette via homologous recombination was confirmed by restriction enzyme digest.<br>
In the second homologous recombination step, cells positive for the kanamycin selection cassette were transformed with the second DNA fragment above. Transformed cells were screened for the loss of kanamycin resistance as indicative of the replacement of the kanamycin selection cassette by the human CX2 gene. The exchange was confirmed by restriction enzyme digest and/or sequence analysis.<br>
The ET cloning procedure is summarized in Figure 13.<br>
The BAC clone containing the chicken light chain locus and the inserted human Clambda2 gene segment was further modified by inserting a rearranged VJ DNA fragment The rearranged VJ DNA fragment encodes a human immunoglobulin variable domain polypcptide described by Kametani et al. (J. Biochem. 93 (2), 421-429, 1983) as<br><br>
10 LAMBDA CHAIN V-l REGION NIG-64 (P01702) (Figure 14). The nucleotide sequence of the rearranged VJ fragment was so designed as to maximize the sequence homology at the nucleotide level to the chicken Vlambdal sequence published by McCormaok et al. (Cell 36,785-791,1999). This rearranged VJDNA sequence is more than 80% identical with known chicken light chain V genes. The rearranged VJ DNA fragment was linked to a 5' fianking sequence and a 3* flanking sequence, resulting in the DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO; 56 (Figure 14). The 5' flanking sequence was derived from y of chicken VUmbdal, and the 3'flanking sequence was derived from 3* of chicken J. The DNA fragment of SEQ ID NO: 58 was subsequently inserted into die chicken light chain locus in K ooli using thepET system as shown in Figure 15. The insertion was performed in such a way that the region on the chicken light chain locus from the 5* end of the chicken Vlambdal gene segment to the 3' end of the chicken J region was replaced whh the rearranged, synthetic VJ DNA fragment Again, this insertion wais accomplished by the replacement of the chicken V-J region with a marker gene, followed by the replacement of the marker gene with the rearranged VJ DNA fragment.

A jungle fowl chicken genomic BAG library was generated by standard procedures and screened with probes specific for chicken Cy. A BAG clone containing chicken heavy chain gene segments is identified. The upstream and downstream regions (i.e., the 5* and 31 flanking regions) of the heavy chain Of gene are sequenced. The chicken Cy gene on this BAG clone is replaced with the human Cyl gone by homologous recombination in E. coll using the pET system as follows.<br>
A first DNA fragment containing a kanamycin selection cassette is generated by PCR using primers specific for Tn5 gene. The 5' and 3' primers are designed to<br><br>

A second DNA fragment is generated by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides wherein this second DNA fragment contains from 5s to 3', a sequence of about SO bp derived from the 5* flanking region of the chicken Cy gene, the human Cyl gene, and a sequence of about SO bp derived from the 3' flanking region of the ohioken Cy gene.<br>
E. coli cells of the chicken CYBAC clone are transformed with a recombination plasmid expressing the recE and reel functions under an inducible promoter. Cells transformed with the recombination plasmid are further transformed with the first DNA fiagment and selected in media containing kanamyora. Clones resistant to kanamyoin are identified, and the replacement of the chicken CY segment by the kanamycin selection cassette via homologous recombination is confirmed by restriction enyme digest.<br>
In the second homologous recombination step, cells positive for the kanamyoin selection cassette are now transformed with the second DNA fragment described above. Transformed cells are screened for loss of kanamycin resistance as indicative of the replacement of the kanamycin selection cassette by the human Cyl gene. The exchange is confirmed by restriction enzyme digest and/or sequence analysis,<br>
The BAC clone containing the inserted human Cyl gene is further modified by replacing the 3'proximal VH1 segment (ie., the 3'proximal VH1 gene in the V region) with a synthetic VH gene segment This synthetic VH gene segment is designed based on the published sequence of a chioken VHl gene (Arakawa et al., EMBO J 15(10): 2540-2546,1996). The synthetic gene segment is more than 80% identical to chioken VH gene segments and encodes an amino acid sequence that is identical to the ammo acid sequence of a human imrnunoglobuUn heavy chain variable domain polypeptide described by Matthyssens and Rabbitss (in Steinberg CM and Lefkovits I, (eds). The Immune System: 132-138, S. Karger, NY 1981). This synthetic VH segment including 5' and 3' flanking sequences is synthesized by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides, The 5' and the 3' flanking sequences are derived from tie upstream and downstream regions of chicken<br><br>
VH1 gene. This synthetic VH segment is used to replace the chicken VH1 gene on the BAG done by homologous recombination using the pET system. The modified BAG clone is amplified and purified using standard procedures.<br>
Transgenic Chicken Expressing the Humanized ImmuBoglobuiin Light and/or Heavy Chain Tranigenes<br>
The production of transgenio chicken is earned out using techniques as described by Etches et al., Methods in Molecular Biology 62: 433-450; Pain et al., Cells Tissues Organs 1999; 165(3-4): 212-9; Sang, H., "Transgenic chickens— methods and potential applications", Trends Biotecknot 12:415 (1994); and in WO 200075300, "Introducing a nucleic add into an avian genome, usefiil for transfecting avian biastodermal cells for producing transgenic avian animals with the desired genes, by directly introducing the nucleic acid into die germinal disc of the egg".<br>
Briefly, the modified BAG clones are linearized and mixed with a transfection reagent to promote uptake of DNA into cells. The formulations are injected into a multicell stage chicken embryo in close proximity to the germinal disc. The window In the egg shell Is closed and the eggs are incubated. Alter hatching chiraerlc chickens are identified by FOR and Southern blot analysis using transgene specific sequences. Integration of the transgene in the genome is confirmed by Southern blots analysis using a probe specific for the transgene. Heavy and light chain transgenic animals are bred with each other to generate transgenic chickens expressing antibodies having humanized heavy and light chains.<br>
oDNA is prepared using RNA isolated from B cells (in blood, spleen and/or lymph nodes) from transgenic chickens. Primers specific for the human transgene (e.g., human CH gene segments and/or the synthetic humanized VH gene segments) are used to generate amplified products from cDNA. The observation of amplified products indicates that the transgene is rearranged in the transgenic animal and the rearranged transgene is transcribed in the animal. Amplified products are sequenced and the presence of donor<br><br>

Production of Functional Humanized Antibodies in Transgenic Chicken with the Agammaglobulittemic Phenotype<br>
Transgenic chickens with the following traits are produced: (1) having at least one humanized light chain transgene, (2) having at least one humanized heavy chain transgene, and (3) homozygous for the agammaglobulinemic phenotype. These animals produce antibodies into the blood and eggs, and antibodies can be purified from either source. In general, antibody concentrations in the eggs are about 5% to 50% of antibodies concentration in the blood. Animals that contain humanized antibodies at high levels in eggs can be selected and bred to produce offspring. Alternatively, transgeolc animals can , be generated that specifically secrete humanized antibodies into their eggs.<br>

Chicken embryonic stem cells are isolated and cultured as described by Pain et al. (Development 122,2339-2348; 1996). Chicken embryos are obtained from eggs immediately after they are laid. The entire blastoderm is removed by gentle aspiration, embryos are slowly dissociated mechanically and cells are seeded in ESA complete medium on inactivated STO feeder cells. ESA medium is composed of MEM medium containing 10% PCS, 2% chicken serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/ml ovalbumin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 pM of each nucleotide<br><br>
adenosine, guanosine, cytidine. undine, thymidine, 0.16 mM (3-mercaptoetfamol, ESA complete medium is supplemented with 10 ng/ml bPGF, 20 ng/ml h-IOF-l, 1% vol/vol avian-SCF and 1 % vol/vol h-LIF, 1% vol/vol h-IL-1 1. Cell cultures are incubated wt 37°C in 7.5 C02 and 90% humidity. After 48 hours fresh blastodermal cells are added to the culture in half of the original volume of ESA complete medium. After an additional incubation for three days, the culture medium is partially (50%) replaced with fresh ESA complete medium, and totally every day thereafter. For cell harvesting, cultures are washed with PBS and incubated in apronase solution (0.025% w/v), Dissociated cells are transacted with various linearized tamsgenic constructs containing a humanized Ig locus. Transfected cells are incubated with STO feeder cells (as described above) hi the presence of selective antibiotics. Cells are transferred onto fresh feeder cells twice per week. Antibiotic resistant cells areisolated and the integration of a humanized Ig gene fragments at a random site or at the corresponding chicken immunoglobulin gene loci is confirmed byPCR.<br>
Subsequently, genetically modified cells ate injected into recipient embryos. As recipient embryos, freshly laid eggs are irradiated (6X3y - Cobalt source). Between 100 to 200 genetically modified cells are injected into the subgenninal cavity using a inicroplpet. The window in the egg shell is closed and the eggs are incubated. Somatic chimerism of hatched chickens is evaluated by FCR. Germ-line chimerism is assessed by mating of somatic chimeras.<br>

jfoample 20 Evaluation of Immunogentcity<br>
Serum samples are collected from five cynomologous monkeys on day 0. Subsequently, a purified partially human polyclonal antibody preparation (5 mg/kg) is administered into five cynomologous monkeys by intravenous administration. The administration is repeated six times in bi-weekly intervals. Monkeys are monitored closely for any side-effects (e.g., anaphylactic shock, reflected by an elevated body temperature), After seven months serum is collected from Mood samples. Affinity resins containing purified human IgG or partially human IgG are produced by standard procedure using CNBr-actSvated Sepharose. Monkey serum samples (3 ml) are added to the IgG-affinity resin (4 ml) containing 10 mg human or partially human IgG. Subsequently, the columns are washed with PBS. Bound monkey immunoglobulin is dated from the column with 0.1M glcyin/HCl pH2.5 and dialyzed 2 times against PBS. The protein content of the eluted fractions is determined using the BCA assay using human IgG as a standard. The total amounts of protein in these fractions demonstrate that therapy with partially human IgG does not lead to a significant antibody response in the treated animals.<br>
Treating Animals Using Humanized Antibodies<br>
Humanized polyclonal immunoglobulins are purified from the serum of genetically engineered rabbits, or from egg yolk of genetically engineered chickens, by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. SCID-mice are injected with one million human liver carcinoma cells expressing HBaAg. Subsequently, 25 ug immunoglobulin is injected peritoneally once per day. Animals treated with antibodies isolated from non-immunized rabbit serum die after about 60 days. This is similar to untreated recipients of liver carcinoma cells. In contrast, mice treated with antibodies isolated from immunized rabbit serum survive for more than 150 days. This<br><br>
demonstrates that human antibodies produced in genetically engineered rabbits are capable of eliminating human carcinoma cells from SCID-mice.<br><br>
