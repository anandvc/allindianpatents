				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to particular types of alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures adapted for laundry and cleaning product use by controlling compositional parameters, especially a 2/3-phenyl index, a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index and linearity, as well as to improved detergent and cleaning products containing these surfactant mixtures, to alkylbenzene precursors for the surfactant mixtures, and to methods of making the precursors as well as the surfactant mixtures. The present compositions are especially useful for fabric laundering.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Historically, highly branched alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants, such as those based on tetrapropylene, known as "ABS" or "TPBS", were used in detergents. However, these were found to be very poorly biodegradable. A long period followed of improving manufacturing processes for alkylbenzene sulfonates, making them as linear as practically possible, hence the acronym "LAS". The overwhelming part of a large art of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant manufacture is directed to this objective. However, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are not without limitations; for example, they would be more desirable if improved for hard water cleaning and/or cold water cleaning properties. They can often fail to produce good cleaning results, for example when formulated with nonphosphate builders and/or when used in hard water areas.<br>
As a result of the limitations of the alkylbenzene sulfonates, consumer cleaning formulations have often needed to include a higher level of co-surfactants, builders, and other additives than would have been needed given a superior alkylbenzene sulfonate. Yet another currently unresolved problem in alkylbenzene sulfonate manufacture is to make more effective use of current LAB feedstock. It would be highly desirable, both from a performance point of view and from an economic point of view, to better utilize certain desirable types of branched hydrocarbons.<br>
Accordingly there exists a substantial unment need for further improvements in alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures. Improved alkylbenzene sulfonates should provide one or more of the following advantages: superior cleaning, hardness tolerance, biodegradability and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that there exist certain alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures, hereinafter "enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures" which offer one or more, and even several of the above-outlined advantages. The discovery of these mixtures solves important problems of the kind described in the background.<br>
More specifically, it has now surprisingly been found for that the alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures of the present invention provide superior cleaning performance, cost advantage, along with good biodegradability as compared to conventional alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures. In most cases, standard environmental tests, such as the previously described Modified SCAS, are sufficient in determining acceptable surfactant biodegradability. It has additionally been discovered that the alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures of the present invention afford a further improved performance and biodegradation profile over the prior art. The present invention achieves the further improved profile by optimizing key compositional parameters, including, but not limited to, the 2/3-phenyl index, the 2-methyl-2-phenyl index and overall linearity. These features provide superior cleaning performance to those who practice the invention, while providing globally acceptable protection of the environment during and following such practice.<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention, an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture is provided.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, a process for making an alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture, and an alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture made by such process is provided.<br>
In still another aspect of the present invention, detergent compositions, especially laundry detergent compositions, comprising the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture of the present invention are provided.<br>
The present invention, on the other hand, is not intended to encompass any wholly conventional alkylbenzene sulfonate compositions or the derivative detergent compositions, such as those based exclusively on linear alkylbenzene sulfonates made by any process, or exclusively on known unacceptably branched alkylbenzene sulfonates such as ABS or TPBS.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, an enhanced alkylbenzene mixture is provided.<br>
In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, there are encompassed herein a number of alternate and less preferred embodiments, such as those in which there is blending of the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture of the invention with one or more other alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants. In practical terms, such blending is usually encompassed before sulfonation and detergent formulation, but the outcome is a surfactant mixture or detergent composition containing a blend of the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant with other, known, alkylbenzene sulfonates. Such alternate embodiments of the invention nonlimitingly include those termed herein as "medium 2/3-phenyl surfactant mixtures".<br>
Preferred cleaning composition embodiments also contain specific cleaning adjuncts defined hereafter. Moreover, the invention encompasses less preferred but sometimes useful embodiments for their normal purposes, such as the addition of useful hydrotrope precursors and/or hydrotropes, such as C1-C8 alkylbenzenes, more typically toluenes, cumenes, xylenes, naphthalenes, or the sulfonated derivatives of any such materials, minor amounts of any other materials, such as tribranched alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants, dialkylbenzenes and their derivatives, dialkyl tetralins, wetting agents, processing aids, and the like. It will be understood that, with the exception of hydrotropes, it will not be usual practice in the present invention to include any such materials. Likewise it will be understood that such materials, if and when they interfere with analytical methods, will not be included in samples of compositions used for analytical purposes.<br>
The abovementioned embodiments and other aspects of the present invention are more fully described and exemplified in the detailed description hereinafter.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.<br>

B. Enhanced alkvlbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures defined on the basis of their preparation<br>
Preferably the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures herein are the product of sulfonating the corresponding enhanced alkylbenzene mixtures, wherein the enhanced alkylbenzene is produced by alkylating benzene with a substituted olefin, and more particularly the lightly substituted types described in more detail hereinafter, over an acidic mordenite-type catalyst, or other suitable catalyst as defined elsewhere herein.<br>
In outline, enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures herein can be made by the steps of:<br>
(I)	alkylating benzene with an alkylating mixture;<br>
(II)	sulfonating the product of (I); and (optionally but very preferably)<br>
(III)	neutralizing the product of (II).<br>
Provided that suitable alkylation catalysts and process conditions as taught herein are used, the product of step (I) is an enhanced alkylbenzene mixture in accordance with the invention. Provided that sulfonation is conducted under conditions generally known and reapplicable from LAS manufacture, see for example the literature references cited herein, the<br>
product of step (II) is an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonic acid mixture in accordance with the invention. Provided that neutralization step (III) is conducted as generally taught herein, the product of step (III) is an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture in accordance with the invention. Since neutralization can be incomplete, mixtures of the acid and neutralized forms of the present enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures in all proportions, e.g., from about 1000:1 to 1:1000 by weight are also part of the present invention. Preferably, said alkylating mixture contains said branched C9-C2omonoolefins having at least two different carbon numbers in said C9-C20 range, and has a mean carbon content of from about 9.0 to about 15.0 carbon atoms; and wherein said components (a) and (b) are at a weight ratio of at least about 15:85.<br>
Preferred enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures herein comprise the product of a process comprising the steps of: (I) alkylating benzene with an alkylating mixture; (II) sulfonating the product of (I); and (optionally but very preferably) (III) neutralizing the product of (II); wherein said alkylating mixture comprises: (a) from about 1% to about 99.9%, by weight of methyl-substituted C9-C15 (preferably C10-C14) monoolefins, said substituted monoolefins having structures identical with those of the substituted monoolefins formed by dehydrogenating substituted paraffins of formula R'LR2 wherein L is an acyclic aliphatic moiety consisting of carbon and hydrogen and containing two terminal methyls; R1 is C, to C3 alkyl; and R2 is selected from H and C, to C3 alkyl; and (b) from about 0.1% to about 85%, by weight of C9-C15 (preferably C10-C14) linear aliphatic olefins; wherein said alkylating mixture contains said methyl-substituted C9-C3 monoolefins having at least two different carbon numbers in said C9-C)5 range, and has a mean carbon content of from about 9.0 to about 15.0 carbon atoms (preferably from about 10.0 to about 14.0, more preferably from about 10.5 to about 12.5, more preferably still from about 11.0 to about 12.0); and wherein said components (a) and (b) are at a weight ratio of at least about 15:85 (preferably having methyl-substituted component (a) &amp; modified unsubstituted component (b) in a performance and biodegradation optimum ratio, for example from 25% to 60% of (a) and 40% to 75% of (b), more preferably 35% to 55% of (a) and 45% to 65% of (b), more preferably still 40% to 50% of (a) and 50% to 60% of (b), wherein these percentages by weight exclude any other materials, for example diluent hydrocarbons, that may be present in the process). Said monoolefins (a) or (b) may be internal monoolefins, alpha-olefins, and/or mixtures thereof. They may be diluted with certain materials selected from paraffins and inert, non-paraffinic solvents. Further, the resultant olefin/paraffin mixture may be obtained via the dehydrogenation of a paraffin mixture obtained from kerosene feed stock via a molecular sieving unit designed to isolate a mixture, consisting mainly of both linear and<br>
monomethyl branched paraffins from cyclic and dimethyl branched paraffins.   Said mixture is blended, if needed, to achieve a linear content of 40% to 75%.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention encompasses an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture prepared in accordance with the above-outlined steps wherein said alkylating mixture may be obtained via any one of the following:<br>
1)	Dimerization of short chain olefin mixtures inside a molecular sieve<br>
2)	Oligomerization of short chain olefin mixtures inside a molecular sieve<br>
3)	Product of cracking long-chain hydrocarbon waxes under conditions to obtain a mainly mono methyl branched olefin product;<br>
4)	Dehydrogenation of a paraffin mixture obtained from a gas to liquids (GTL) plant.<br>
Other enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures herein are made by the above-<br>
outlined processes wherein in step (I), said alkylation is performed in the presence of an<br>
alkylation catalyst, said alkylation catalyst is an intermediate acidity solid porous alkylation<br>
catalyst, and step (II) comprises removal of components other than monoalkylbenzene prior to<br>
contacting the product of step (I) with sulfonating agent.<br>
Also encompassed is the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according to the above-defined processes wherein said alkylation catalyst is other than a member selected from the group consisting of HF, A1C13, sulfuric acid and mixtures thereof. Such is the case when the alkylation catalyst is selected from the group consisting of non-fluoridated acidic mordenite-type catalyst, fluoridated acidic mordenite-type catalyst and mixtures thereof.<br>
The processes are tolerant of variation, for example conventional steps can be added before, in parallel with, or after the outlined steps (I), (II) and (III). This is especially the case for accommodating the use of hydrotropes or their precursors. Thus the invention encompasses an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according to the above-outlined processes wherein a hydrotrope, hydrotrope precursor, or mixtures thereof is added after step (I); or the hydirotrope, hydrotrope precursor or mixtures thereof is added during or after step (II) and prior to step (III); or a hydrotrope can be added during or after step (III).<br>
In certain cases, compositions herein can also be prepared by blending. Thus, the invention includes a detergent composition using an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant blend according to the first embodiment wherein said enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture is prepared by a process comprising a step selected from: (i) blending a mixture of enhanced and modified unsubstituted alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants having a 2/3-phenyl index of 500 to 700 with an alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture having a 2/3-phenyl index of 75 to 160 and (ii) blending a mixture of methyl-substituted and modified unsubstituted<br>
alkylbenzenes having a 2/3-phenyl index of 500 to 700 with an alkylbenzene mixture having a 2/3-phenyl index of 75 to 160 and sulfonating said blend. Sulfonation and Workup or Neutralization (Steps II / III)<br>
In general, sulfonation of the enhanced alkylbenzene mixture in the instant process can be accomplished using any of the well-known sulfonation systems, including those described in "Detergent Manufacture Including Zeolite Builders and other New Materials", Ed. Sittig., Noyes Data Corp., 1979, as well as in Vol. 56 in "Surfactant Science" series, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1996, including in particular Chapter 2 entitled "Alkylarylsulfonates: History, Manufacture, Analysis and Environmental Properties", pages 39-108 which includes 297 literature references. This work provides access to a great deal of literature describing various processes and process steps, not only sulfonation but also dehydrogenation, alkylation, alkylbenzene distillation and the like. Common sulfonation systems useful herein include sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, oleum, sulfur trioxide and the like. Sulfur trioxide/air is especially preferred. Details of sulfonation using a suitable air/sulfur trioxide mixture are provided in US 3,427,342, Chemithon. Sulfonation processes are further extensively described in "Sulfonation Technology in the Detergent Industry", W.H. de Groot, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1991.<br>
Any convenient workup steps may be used in the present process. Common practice is to neutralize after sulfonation with any suitable alkali. Thus the neutralization step can be conducted using alkali selected from sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium and substituted ammonium alkalis and mixtures thereof. Potassium can assist solubility, magnesium can promote soft water performance and substituted ammonium can be helpful for formulating specialty variations of the instant surfactants. The invention encompasses any of these derivative forms of the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures as produced by the present process and their use in consumer product compositions.<br>
Alternately the acid form of the present surfactants can be added directly to acidic cleaning products, or can be mixed with cleaning ingredients and then neutralized.<br>
The hydrotropes or hydrotrope precursors useful herein can in general be selected from any suitable hydrotrope or hydrotrope precursor, including lower alkyl (C1-C8) aromatics and their sulfonic acids and sulfonate salts, but are more typically based on a sulfonic acid or sodium sulfonate salt of toluene, cumene, xylene, napthalene or mixtures thereof. The hydrotrope precursors are selected from any suitable hydrotrope precursor, typically toluene, cumene, xylene, napthalene or mixtures thereof. A hydrotrope precursor is a compound that during step (III), namely the sulfonation step, is converted into a hydrotrope.<br>
Moreover, it is contemplated that the alkylation "step" (I) herein can be "staged" so that two or more reactors operating under different conditions in the defined ranges may be useful. By operating a plurality of such reactors, it is possible to allow for material with less preferred 2-methyl-2-phenyl index to be initially formed and, surprisingly, to convert such material into material with a more preferred 2-methyl-2-phenyl index.<br>
In terms of sulfonating agent selection, the invention encompasses an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture wherein step (II) is performed using a sulfonating agent selected from the group consisting of sulfur trioxide, sulfur trioxide/air mixtures, and sulfuric acid (including oleum). Chlorosulfonic acid or other known sulfonating agents, while less commercially relevant, are also useful and are included for use in the invention.<br>
Although in general, neutralization step (III) can be carried out with any suitable alkali, the invention includes an enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture wherein said step (III) is performed using a basic salt, said basic salt having a cation selected from the group consisting of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, substituted ammonium, and mixtures thereof and an anion selected from hydroxide, oxide, carbonate, silicate, phosphate, and mixtures thereof. Preferred basic salt is selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate, potassium hydroxide, potassium silicate, magnesium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof. Alkylation Catalyst<br>
To secure the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures of the invention, the present invention uses a particularly defined alkylation catalyst. Said alkylation catalyst is an intermediate acidity solid porous alkylation catalyst defined in detail hereinafter. Particularly preferred alkylation catalysts comprise at least partially dealuminized acidic non-fluoridated mordenites, at least partially dealuminized acidic fluoridated mordenites, and mixtures thereof. In additional embodiments, a preferred alkylation catalyst is that which exhibits the same or similar characteristics as the mordenite catalyst, under the same or similar conditions. One such catalyst may stem from the group consisting of zeolite beta catalysts, of certain and specific form, but is not preferred.<br>
Numerous alkylation catalysts are unsuitable for making the present enhanced<br>
alkylbenzene mixtures and enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures. Unsuitable<br>
alkylation catalysts include any of: sulfuric acid, aluminum chloride, and HF. Also unsuitable are<br>

In contrast, suitable alkylation catalysts herein are selected from shape-selective moderately acidic alkylation catalysts, preferably zeolitic. The zeolite catalyst used for the alkylation step (I) is preferably selected from the group consisting of mordenite, HZSM-12, NES and offretite, any of these being in at least partially acidic form. Mixtures can be used and the catalysts can be combined with binders etc. More preferably, the zeolite is substantially in acid form and is contained in a catalyst pellet comprising a conventional binder and further wherein said catalyst pellet comprises at least about 1 %, more preferably at least 5%, more typically from 50% to about 90%, of said zeolite.<br>
More generally, a suitable alkylation catalyst is typically at least partially crystalline, more preferably substantially crystalline not including binders or other materials used to form catalyst pellets, aggregates or composites. Moreover the catalyst is typically at least partially acidic. Fully exchanged Ca-form mordenite, for example, is unsuitable whereas H-form mordenite is suitable.<br>

The resulting zeolites can have a SiO2:Al2O3 ratio of 15:1 to 26:1, preferably 17:1 to 23:1, and are preferably calcined to at least partially convert the NH4+/H+ form to the H+ form. Optionally, though not necessarily particularly desirable in the present invention, the catalyst can contain a Group VIII metal (and optionally also an inorganic oxide) together with the calcined zeolite of '472.<br>
Another acidic mordenite catalyst useful for the alkylation step herein is disclosed in US 4,861,935 which relates to a hydrogen form of mordenite incorporated with alumina, the composition having a surface area of at least 580 m2 /g.

Yet another alkylation catalyst useful herein is described in US 5,175,135 Avhich is an acid mordenite<br>

range from about 0.18 cc/g to about 0.45 cc/g and the ratio of the combined meso- and<br>
   macropore- volume to the total pore volume is from about 0.25 to about 0.75.                   Particularly preferred alkylation catalysts herein include the acidic mordenite catalysts<br>
        Zeocat™ FM-8/25H available from Zeochem; CBV 90 A available from Zeolyst International,<br>
         and LZM-8 available from UOP Chemical Catalysts as well as fluoridated versions of the above<br>
commercial catalysts. Fluoridated mordenites can be prepared by a number of ways. A method<br>
of providing a particularly useful fluoridated mordenite is described in US 5 ,777,187. The<br>
invention encompasses preferred embodiments in which the mordenites are fluoridated, but also<br>
has other preferred embodiments in which the mordenites are non-fluoridated.<br>
Most generally, any alkylation catalyst may be used herein provided that the alkylation catalyst can (a) accommodate methyl-substituted olefins as described elsewhere herein into the smallest pore diameter of said catalyst and (b) selectively alkylate benzene with said substituted olefnis and optionally mixtures thereof with linear olefins. Acceptable selectivity is in accordance with a 2/3-Phenyl index of about 275 to about 10,000 as defined herein.<br>
In other terms, the catalyst selections herein are made in part with the intention of minimizing internal alkylbenzene formation (e.g., 4-phenyl, 5-phenyl ...). The formulators contiibuting to the present invention have unexpectedly discovered that control of internal alkylbenzene sulfonate isomers in the present inventive surfactant mixtures in conjunction with introduction of limited methyl branching is very helpful for improving their performance. The present invention connects this discovery to discoveries of the synthesis chemists in the present invention, who have determined how to control internal isomer content while providing limited methyl branching in the enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures in accordance with the formulators' prescriptions.<br>
The extent to which internal isomer content needs to be controlled can vary depending on the consumer product application and on whether outright best performance or a balance of performance and cost is required. In absolute terms, the amount of internal isomer such as internal alkylbenzene isomer is preferably always kept below 25% by weight, but for best results, from 0 to 10%, preferably less than about 5% by weight. "Internal alkylbenzene" isomers as defined herein include alkylbenzenes having phenyl attachment to an aliphatic chain in the 4,5,6 or 7 position.<br>
Without intending to be limited by theory, there are two reasons for which it is believed that the preferred alkylation catalysts are the above-described shape selective zeolitic type catalysts, especially mordenites. The first reason is to provide the selectivity of formation of preferred compounds such as substituted and unsubstituted 2-phenyl and 3-phenylalkylbenzenes.<br>
This selectivity is measured by the 2/3-phenyl index. The second reason is to control the amount of quaternary alkylbenzenes and thus quaternary alkylbenzene sulfonates.<br>
Results with alkylation catalysts such as HF can give quite high levels of quaternary alkylbenzenes as shown in the literature (see J. Org. Chem. Vol. 37, No. 25, 1972). This contrasts with the surprising discovery as part of the present invention that one can attain low levels of quaternary alkylbenzenes in catalyzed reactions of benzene with substituted olefins, as characterized by 2-methyl-2-phenyl index. In practice, some isomerization of the enhanced alkylbenzenes may occur during alkylation, i.e. the ratio of enhanced alkylbenzenes to modified unsubstituted alkylbenzenes may vary.

Moreover, as is wel known to practitioners of detergent analysis, a number of detergent adjuncts (paramagneti* materials such as certain transition metal bleach catalysts, for example, and sometimes evei water) are capable of interfering with methods for determining the parameters of alkylbenzem sulfonate surfactant mixtures as described hereinafter.

(A methyl-substituted olefin mixture, which is an alkylating agent for preparing enhanced<br>
alkylbenzenes in accordance with the invention) a) A 179.6 g sample of the mono methyl branched alcohol mixture of Example 1 is added to a nitrogen blanketed stirred three neck round bottom 500 mL flask, fitted with a Dean Stark trap and a reflux condenser along with 36.5 g of a shape selective zeolite catalyst (acidic mordenite catalyst Zeocat™ FM-8/25H). With mixing, the mixture is then heated to about 110-155°C and water and some olefin is collected over a period of 4-5 hours in the Dean Stark trap. The conversion of the alcohol mixture of Example 1 to a substantially non-randomized methyl branched olefin mixture is now complete. The substantially non-randomized methyl branched olefin mixture remaining in the flask along with the substantially non-randomized methyl branched olefin mixture collected in the dean stark trap is recombined and filtered to remove catalyst.   The solid filter cake is washed twice with 100 mL portions of hexane.   The hexane<br>
filtrate is evaporated under vacuum and the resulting product is combined with the first filtrate to give 151.2 g of a substantially non-randomized methyl branched olefin mixture. b) The olefin mixture of Example 2a is combined with 36g of a shape selective zeolite catalyst (acidic mordenite catalyst Zeocat™ FM-8/25H) and reacted according to Example 2a with the following changes. The reaction temperature is raised to 190-200°C for a period of about 1-2 hours to randomize the specific branch positions in the olefin mixture. The substantially mono methyl branched olefin mixture with randomized branching remaining in the flask along with the substantially mono methyl branched olefin mixture with randomized branching collected in the dean stark trap are recombined and filtered to remove catalyst. The solid filter cake is washed twice with 100 mL portions of hexane. The hexane filtrate is evaporated under vacuum and the resulting product is combined with the first filtrate to give 150.0 g of a substantially mono methyl branched olefin mixture with randomized branching.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Enhanced Alkylbenzenes with a 2/3-Phenyl Index of about 550 and a 2-Methyl-2-Phenyl index of about 0.02 (Enhanced alkylbenzenes in accordance with the invention) 150.0 g of the substantially mono methyl branched olefin mixture of Example 2 and 36 g of a shape selective zeolite catalyst (acidic mordenite catalyst Zeocat™ FM-8/25H) are added to a 2-gallon stainless steel, stirred autoclave. Residual olefin and catalyst in the container are washed into the autoclave with 300 mL of n-hexane and the autoclave is sealed. From outside the autoclave cell, 2000 g of benzene (contained in a isolated vessel and added by way of an isolated pumping system inside the isolated autoclave cell) is added to the autoclave. The autoclave is purged twice with 250 psig N2, and then charged to 60 psig N2. The mixture is stirred and heated to about 200°C for about 4-5 hours. The autoclave is cooled to about 20°C overnight. The valve is opened leading from the autoclave to the benzene condenser and collection tank. The autoclave is heated to about 120°C with continuous collection of benzene. No more benzene is collected by the time the reactor reaches 120°C. The reactor is then cooled to 40°C and 750 g of n-hexane is pumped into the autoclave with mixing. The autoclave is then drained to remove the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is filtered to remove catalyst and the n-hexane is removed under vacuum.

Methods for Determining Compositional Parameters (2/3-phenyl index. 2-methvl-2-phenvl index) of Mixed Alkylbenzene/ Alkylbenzene sulfonate/ Alkylbenzene sulfonic Acid Systems.<br>
It is well known in the art to determine compositional parameters of conventional linear alkylbenzenes and/or highly branched alkylbenzene sulfonates (TPBS, ABS). See, for Example Surfactant Science Series, Volume 40, Chapter 7 and Surfactant Science Series, Volume 73, Chapter 7. Typically, this is done by GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy for the alkylbenzenes and HPLC for the alkylbenzene sulfonates or sulfonic acids; 13C nmr is also commonly used. Another common practice is desulfonation. This permits GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy to be used, since desulfonation converts the sulfonates or sulfonic acids to the alkylbenzenes that are tractable by such methods.<br>
In general, the present invention provides unique and relatively complex mixtures of enhanced alkylbenzenes, and similarly complex surfactant mixtures of enhanced alkylbenzene sulfonates and/or alkylbenzene sulfonic acids. Compositional parameters of such compositions can be determined using variations and combinations of the art-known methods.<br>
The sequence of methods to be used depends on the composition to be characterized as follows:<br><br>

Run both standards using the conditions specified above to define the retention time for each standard. This defines a retention time range which is the retention time range to be used for characterizing any alkylbenzenes or alkylbenzene mixtures in the context of this invention (e.g., test samples). Now run the test samples for which compositional parameters are to be determined. Test samples pass the GC test provided that greater than 90% of the total GC area percent is within the retention time range defined by the two standards. Test samples that pass the GC test can be used directly in the NMR1 and NMR2 test methods. Test samples that do not pass the GC test must be further purified by distillation until the test sample passes the GC test.<br>
DESULFONATION (VE\ - The desulfonation method is a standard method described in "The Analysis of Detergents and Detergent Products" by G. F. Longman on pages 197-199. Two other useful descriptions of this standard method are given on page 230-231 of volume 40 of the Surfactant Sience Series edited by T. M. Schmitt: "Analysis of Surfactants" and on page 272 of volume 73 of the Surfactant Science Series: "Anionic Surfactants" edited by John Cross. This is an alternative method to the HPLC method, described herein, for evaluation of alkylbenzene sulfonic acid and/or salt mixtures (alkylbenzene sulfonic acid and/or salt mixtures, including those of the claimed invention). The method provides a means of converting the sulfonic acid and/or salt mixture into alkylbenzene mixtures which can then be analyzed by means of the GC and NMR methods NMR1 and NMR2 described herein.<br>

b)	Add 800 mL of acetonitrile and mix. Dilute to volume after solution comes to room temperature. This prepares a solution of 100 mM NaCl/40% ACN.<br>
c)	Filter through an LC eluent membrane filter and degas prior to use.<br>
2.	Mobile phase B - Prepare 2000 mL of 60% acetonitrile in HPLC grade water.<br>
Filter through an LC eluent membrane filter and degas prior to use.<br>
B.	C8 and C15 Internal Standard Solution<br><br>
1.	Weigh 0.050 g of a 2-phenyloctylbenzenesulfonate and 0.050g of 2-Phenylpentadecanesulfonate standards and quantitatively transfer to a 100 mL volumetric flask.<br>
2.	Dissolve with 30 mL ACN and dilute to volume with HPLC grade water. This prepares ca. 1500-ppm solution of the mixed standard.<br>
Sample Solutions<br>
1.	Wash Solutions - Transfer 250 uL of the standard solution to a 1 mL autosampler vial and add 750 uL of the wash solution. Cap and place in the autosampler tray.<br>
2.	Alkvlbenzene sulfonic acid or Alkvlbenzene sulfonate - Weigh 0.10 g of the alkylbenzene sulfonic acid or salt and quantitatively transfer to a 100 mL volumetric flask. Dissolve with 30 mL ACN and dilute to volume with HPLC grade water. Transfer 250 uL of the standard solution to a 1 mL autosampler vial and add 750 uL of the sample solution. Cap and place in the autosampler tray. If solution is excessively turbid, filter through 0.45 um membrane before transferring to auto-sampler vial. Cap and place in the auto-sampler tray.<br>
HPLC System<br>
1.	Prime HPLC pump with mobile phase. Install column and column inlet filter and<br>
equilibrate with eluent (0.3 mL/min for at least 1 hr.).<br>

3.	The column should be washed with 100% water followed by 100% acetonitrile<br>
and stored in 80/20 ACN/water. The HPLC elution time of the 2-phenyloctylbenzenesulfonate defines the lower limit and the elution time of the 2-phenylpentadecanesulfonate standard defines the upper limit of the HPLC analysis relating to the alkylbenzene sulfonic acid/salt mixture of the invention. If 90% of the alkylbenzene sulfonic acid/salt mixture components have retention times within the range of the above standards then the sample can be further defined by methods NMR 3 and NMR 4.<br>
If the alkylbenzene sulfonic acid/salt mixture contains 10% or more of components outside the retention limits defined by the standards then the mixture should be further purified by method HPLC-P or by DE, DIS methods.<br>
HPLC Preparative (HPLC-P) - Alkylbenzene sulfonic acids and/or the salts which contain substantial impurities (10% or greater) are purified by preparative HPLC. See L.R. Snyder and J.J. Kirkland, "Introduction to Modern Liquid Chromatography", 2nd. Ed., Wiley, NY, 1979. This is routine to one skilled in the art. A sufficient quantity should be purified to meet the requirements of the NMR 3 and NMR 4. Preparative LC method using Mega Bond Elut Sep Pak® (HPLC-P)<br>
Alkylbenzene sulfonic acids and/or the salts which contain substantial impurities (10% or greater) can also be purified by an LC method (also defined herein as HPLC-P). This procedure is actually preferred over HPLC column prep purification.<br>
As much as 500 mg of unpurified alkylbenzene sulfonic salt can be loaded onto a 10g(60ml) Mega Bond Elut Sep Pak® and with optimized chromatography the purified salt can be isolated and ready for freeze drying within 2 hours. A 100 mg sample of alkylbenzene sulfonate salt can be loaded onto a 5g(20ml) Bond Elut Sep Pak and ready within the same amount of time. .A. Instrumentation<br>

DISTILLATION (PIS) - A 5-liter, 3-necked round bottom flask with 24/40 joints is equipped with a magnetic stir bar. A few boiling chips (Hengar Granules, catalog #136-C) are added to the flask. A 91/2-inch long vigreux condenser with a 24/40 joint is placed in the center neck of the flask. A water-cooled condenser is attached to the top of the vigreux condenser which is fitted with a calibrated thermometer. A vacuum-receiving flask is attached to the end of the condenser. A glass stopper is placed in one side arm of the 5-liter flask and a calibrated thermometer in the other. The flask and the vigreux condenser are wrapped with aluminum foil. To the 5-liter flask, is added 2270 g of an alkylbenzene mixture which contains 10% or more impurities as defined by the GC method. A vacuum line leading from a vacuum pump is attached to the receiving flask. The alkylbenzene mixture in the 5-liter flask is stirred and vacuum is applied to the system. Once the maximum vacuum is reached (at least 1 inch of Hg pressure by gauge or less), the alkylbenzene mixture is heated by means of an electric heating mantle. The distillate is collected in two fractions. Fraction A is collected from about 25°C to about 90°C as measured by the calibrated thermometer at the top of the vigreux column. Fraction B is collected from about 90°C to about 155°C as measured by the calibrated thermometer at the top of the vigreux column. Fraction A and pot residues (high boiling) are discarded. Fraction B (1881 g) contains the alkylbenzene mixture of interest. The method can be scaled according to the practitioner's needs provided that sufficient quantity of the alkylbenzene mixture remains after distillation for evaluation by NMR methods NMR1 and NMR2.<br>
ACIDIFICATION (AC) - Salts of alkylbenzene sulfonic acids are acidified by common means such as reaction in a solvent with HC1 or sulfuric acid or by use of an acidic resin such as<br>
Amberlyst 15. Acidification is routine to one skilled in the art.   After acidifying remove all<br>
solvents, especially any moisture, so that the samples are anhydrous and solvent-free.<br>
Note; For all of me below NMR test methods, the chemical shifts of the NMR spectrum are either<br>
externally or internally referenced to TMS in CDC13, i.e. chloroform.<br>
