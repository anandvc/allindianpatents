to the following<br>
methods,   devices,   apparatuses,   and  systems:<br>
(1)	an  encoding  method  of  compressing/encoding recorded  digital   image  data  such  as  caption  data  or simple  animated  cartoon  data;<br>

(9)	a  broadcasting/distributing  system  for broadcasting/distributing  various  pieces  of  information, which  are  compressed/encoded  by  the  encoding  method,   by<br>
radio  or  wire;   and<br>
(10)     an  electronic  mail  system  for  exchanging various  pieces  of  information,   which  are  compressed/ encoded  by  the  encoding  method,   by  radio  or  via  network lines   (e.g.,   internet  lines)   using  wires.<br>
As  methods  of   compressing  and  recording  or communicating  image  data  such  as   caption  data,   the following  conventional  methods  are  known.<br>
The  first  method  is  a  character  code  conversion method,   in  which  text  data  is   separated   for  every  other word,   and  character  codes  corresponding  to  the respective  words  are  recorded  or  communicated  as  data. Currently,   as  character  codes,   2-byte  codes  used  for Japanese  and   1-byte  codes  used   for  English  are  widely used.     As  Japanese  codes,   JIS  codes,   shift  JIS  codes, and  the  like  are  used.     As  English  codes,   ASCII  codes and  the  like  are  used.<br>
In  the  first  method,   a  character  font  ROM corresponding  to  each  character  code  set  must  be prepared  in  the  image  playing  back  apparatus.     A character  code  which  does  not  correspond  to  any  one  of the  character  font  ROMs   cannot  be  played  back.     For this   reason,   in  order   to  allow  the   image  playing  back apparatus  to  handle  a  plurality  of   languages, a  character  font  ROM  is   required   for  each   language.<br>
The  second  method  is  a  method  of  reading  test  data as  image  data  and  encoding  the  data  to  compress  the<br>
entire  data.     As  a  typical  example  of   this  encoding method,   a  run-length  compression  method  is  known.<br>
In  the  run-length  compression  method,   the  length of  continuous  pixels  of  continuous   identical  data  of pixel  data  obtained  by  scanning  text  data   line  by  line is  converted  into  a  run-length  code,   and  the  resultant data   is   recorded  or  transmitted.<br>
Consider  a  pixel  data   line   like "aaaabbbbbbbcccccdd".     According  to  the  run-length compression  method,   this  data  line  is  converted  into data   (run-length  compressed  code)   like   "a4,   b7,   c5,   d2" consisting  of   pieces   of   pixel   information   (a,   b,   c,   and d)   and  the  numbers  of  pixels   followed   (4,   7,   5,   and  2) indicating  the  numbers  of  pieces  of  pixel  information.<br>
As  methods  of   further  converting  this  run-length compressed  code  into  a  binary  code,   modified  Huffman codings  and  arithmetic  codings  are  known.<br>
Modified  Huffman  codes   (to  be  abbreviated  to  MH codes)   used  as   standard  codes   in   facsimile  apparatuses will  be  briefly  described  first.     Note  that  MH  codes are  used  only  when  the  contents  of   image   information, i.e.,   pixels,   have  two  colors,   i.e.,   black  and  white.<br>
A  data   file  is   converted  into  MH  codes  by  using an  algorithm  which  is  designed  such  that  a  binary  bit code  having  a  small  number  of  bits   (i.e.,   a  simple code)   is  assigned  to  data  with  a  statistically  high frequency  of  use   (i.e.,   frequently  used  data),   and<br>
a  binary  bit  code  having  a   large  number  of  bits   (i.e., a  complicated  code)   is  assigned  to  data  with  a  low frequency  of  use   (i.e.,   rarely  used  data)   so  as  to reduce   the   total  data  amount  of   the  data   file.<br>
In  MH  codings,   as   the  number  of   types  of  data  to be  encoded  increases,   a  corresponding  code  table increases   in  size.     In  addition,   complicated  code tables   corresponding  to  the  number  of  data  to  be encoded  are  required  in  both  an  encoder  and  a  decoder.<br>
For  this   reason,   MH  codings   in  a  multilingual system  handling  various   languages   lead  to  great increases   in  the  costs  of  both   the  encoder  and  the decoder.<br>
Arithmetic  codings  will  be  described  next.<br>
In  performing  arithmetic  codings,   first  of  all, data  is  read,   and  the  frequency  of  use  of  each  data  is checked.     Codes  having  small  numbers  of  bits  are  then assigned  to  the  data  in  the  order  of  decreasing frequencies  of  use  so  as   to   form  a  code  table.     The code  table   formed  in  this  manner  is   recorded   (or transmitted)   as  data.     Thereafter,   the  data   is  encoded on  the  basis  of   this  code  table.<br>
In  arithmetic  codings,   although  a  code  table  must be  recorded  or  transmitted,   data  can  be  formed  by  using a  code  table  optimal   for  the  contents  of  a   file  to  be recorded  or  transmitted.      In  addition,   in  arithmetic codings,   complicated  code  tables  are  not  required  in<br>
both  an  encoder  and  a  decoder,   unlike  in  MH  codings.<br>
In  arithmetic  codings,   however,   since  a  code  table is   formed  in  encoding  data,   the  data  must  be  read twice,   and  decoding  processing  is  complicated.<br>
USP  4,811,113  discloses  an  image  encoding  method other  than  the  above  two  methods.      In  this  method, a  flag  bit  representing  the  number  of  bits  as  a  code data   length  is  prepared  before  a  run-length  code,   and encoding  and  decoding  are  performed  while  an  integer multiple  of  the  value  of  the  flag  bit  is  regarded  as a  code  data   length.<br>
In  this  method,   since  a  data   length  is   calculated from  a   flag  bit,   a   large  code  table  is  not  required, unlike  in  MH  codings.     However,   the  internal   circuit arrangement  of  a  decoder  tends   to  be  complicated because  of  hardware  for  calculating  a  code  data   length.<br>
In  addition,   in  this  method,   although  monochrome (black  and  white)   data  can  be  encoded/decoded  as   in  MH codings,   multi-color  image  data   cannot   be   compressed without  any  improvement.<br>
It  is  the  first  object  of  the  present  invention  to provide  an  image  information  encoding  method  which  can eliminate  the  drawback   (necessity  to  use  large  code tables)   of  MH  codings,   the  drawback   (necessity  to  read data   twice)   of   arithmetic   codings,   and  the  drawback (inability  to  compress  multi-color  image  data)   of the   flag-bit-attached  run-length  coding  method<br>
 (USP  4,811,113)   at  practical   level.<br>
It is the second object of the present invention to provide a decoding method of decoding data encoded in  accordance  with  the   first  object.<br>
It   is   the  third  object  of   the  present   invention  to provide  a  compression/expansion  system  based  on  a combination  of   the  encoding   (compression)   method  and the  decoding   (expansion)   method  according   to   the   first and  second  objects.<br>
It  is  the  fourth  object  of   the  present  invention to  provide  a  recording  medium   (e.g.,   a  two-sided high-density  optical  disk)   on  which  information  is recorded  by  the  encoding  method  according  to  the  first object.<br>
It  is  the  fifth  object  of  the  present  invention  to provide  a  device   (e.g.,   an  integrated  circuit)   for performing  signal  processing  based  on  the  encoding method  according  to  the   first  object.<br>
It  is   the  sixth  object  of  the  present  invention   to provide  a  device   (e.g.,   an  integrated  circuit)   for performing   signal   processing  based  on   the  decoding method  according  to  the  second  object.<br>
It  is   the  seventh  object  of  the  present  invention to  provide  a  recording  apparatus   for  recording  various pieces  of   information  on  a  recording  medium   (e.g.,   a two-sided  high-density  optical  disk)   by  the  encoding method  according  to  the  first  object.<br>
It   is   the  eight  object  of   the  present  invention  to provide  a  playing  back  apparatus   for  playing  back information  recorded  on  the  above  recording  medium  by the  decoding  method  according  to  the  second  object.<br>
It  is  the  ninth  object  of  the  present  invention  to provide  a  broadcasting/distributing  system  for broadcasting/distributing  various  pieces  of   information, which  are  compressed/encoded  by  the  encoding  method according  to  the  first  object,   by  radio  or  wire.<br>
It  is   the  tenth  object  of   the  present  invention  to provide  an  electronic  mail  system  for  exchanging various  pieces  of   information,   which  are compressed/encoded  by  the  encoding  method  according  to the   first  object,   by  radio  or  via  network   lines   (e.g., internet   lines)   using  wires.<br>
To  achieve  the  above-mentioned  first  object, according  to  an  encoding  method  of   the  present invention,   an  information  integral  body   (e.g.,   PXD  in FIG.   9,   or  SPD  in  FIG.   10),   formed  of  a  plurality  of pixel  data  each  defined  by  a  predetermined  number  of bits   (e.g.,   2-bit),   is  processed  so  that  a  data  block, containing  the  same  continuous  pixel  data,   is compressed  as   one  unit  of   compression   (e.g.,   any  of CU01   to  CU04   in  FIG.   9).     The  encoding  method  comprises the  steps   of:<br>
a  compression  data  specifying  step   (e.g.,   ST801   in FIG.   13)   for  specifying  the  data  block  of   the  one<br>
compression  unit   (CU01-CU04)   of   the  information integral  body   (PXD/SPD);   and<br>
a  compression  data  generating  step   (e.g.,   ST806   in FIG.   13,   or  ST908  to  ST914   in  FIG.   14)   for  generating a  compressed  unit  data  block   (e.g.,   CU01*  to  CU04*   in FIG.   9)   in  accordance  with  a  coding  header   (e.g.,   0-bit to   6-bit  of  rules   1   to  4   in  FIG.   5)   corresponding  to a  continuing  number   (e.g.,   any  of   1   to   255)   of  the  same pixel  data  in  the  data  block  of  the  one  compression unit,   with  a  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   2-bit to  8-bit)   indicating  the  continuing  number   (1-255)   of the  same  pixel  data,   and  with  data   (e.g.,   2-bit) representing  the  same  pixel  data   in  the  data  block  of the  one  compression  unit.<br>
To  achieve  the  above-mentioned  second  object, according  to  a  decoding  method  of   the  present invention,   a  bit  train  of  one  unit  of  a  compressed  data block,   obtained  by  compressing  the  same  continuous pixel  data  as  one  unit  of  compression,   is  expanded (e.g.,   ST1005   in  FIG.   15),   wherein  the  compressed  data block  corresponds  to  at   least  part  of  an  information integral  body   (e.g.,   PXD  in  FIG.   9,   or  SPD  in  FIG.   10) formed  by  a  plurality  of  pixel  data  each  defined  by a  predetermined  number  of  bits   (e.g.,   2-bit),   and  the compressed  data  block  includes   a  coding  header indicating  data  of  a  number  of  pixels   followed,   which number  data  corresponds  to  the  number  of  the  same<br>
continuous  pixel  data,   or  includes  a  coding  header indicating  the  number  data  of  pixels  followed  as  well as  the  same  continuous  pixel  data  thereof.     The decoding  method  comprises  the  steps  of:<br>
a  coding  header  detecting  step   (e.g.,   ST1101  to ST1109  in  FIG.   16)   for  detecting  the  coding  header  from the  data  block   (e.g.,   any  of  CU01*   to  CU04*   in  FIG.   9) of  the  one  compression  unit  contained  in  the information  integral  body   (PXD/SPD);<br>
a  continuous   pixel  number  detecting  step   (e.g., STlllO  to  ST1113  in  FIG.   16)   for  detecting  the  number data  of   the  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   any  of   2-bit  to 8-bit  in  FIG.   5,   or  data  length  of   zero  as  in  the  case of   rule  5   in  FIG.   5;   the  zero  data   length  will  not affect  on  a  later  subtraction),   from  the  data  block (e.g.,   any  of  CU01*  to  CU04*  in  FIG.   9)   of  the  one compression  unit,   in  accordance  with  a  content  of  the coding  header   (e.g.,   data   length  of  any  of   0-bit  to 6-bit  at  rules   1  to  4   in  FIG.   5;   the  data   length  of 0-bit  as   in  the  case  of   rule   1  will  not  affect  on a  later  subtraction)   detected  by  the  coding  header detecting   step   (ST1101   to  ST1109);<br>
a   pixel  data  determining   step   (e.g.,   ST1114   in FIG.   16)   for  determining  a  content   (e.g.,   any  of   "00", "01",   "10",   "11")   of   the  pixel  data  in  an  uncompressed data  block   (e.g.,   any  of  CU01  to  CU04   in  FIG.   9)   of  the one  compression  unit,   in  accordance  with  a  remainder<br>
 (e.g.,   2-bit  of  the  pixel  data  at  rules   1   to  4   in FIG.   5)   of   the  data  block   (e.g.,   any  of   CU01*   to  CU04* in  FIG.   9)   of  the  one  compression  unit,   from  which removed  are  the  coding  header   (e.g.,   any  of  0-bit  to 6-bit)   detected  by  the  coding  header  detecting  step (ST1101  to  ST1109   in  FIG.   16)   and  the  number  data  of the  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   any  of   2-bit  to  8-bit  in FIG.   5)   detected  by  the  continuous  pixel  number detecting  step   (STlllO  to  ST1113  in  FIG.   16);   and<br>
a  pixel  pattern  restoration  step   (e.g.,   ST1115  to ST1118  in  FIG.   16)   for  arranging  bit  data  of  the content  determined  by  the  pixel  data  determining  step (ST1114   in  FIG.   16),   by  a  number  indicated  by  the number  data  of  the  pixels  followed   (e.g.,   any  of  2-bit to  8-bit  in  FIG.   5)   detected  by  the  continuous  pixel number  detecting  step   (STlllO  to  ST1113  in  FIG.   16),   so as  to  restore  a  pattern  of  uncompressed  pixel  data  of the  one  compression  unit.<br>
To  achieve  the  above-mentioned  third  object, according  to  a  system  of  the  present  invention,   an information  integral  body   (e.g.,   PXD  in  FIG.   9,   or  SPD in  FIG.   10),   formed  of  a  plurality  of  pixel  data  each defined  by  a  predetermined  number  of  bits   (e.g.,   2-bit), is  processed  so  that  a  data  block,   containing  the  same continuous  pixel  data,   is  compressed   (e.g.,   ST806   in FIG.   13)   as  one  unit  of  compression   (e.g.,   any  of  CU01 to  CU04  in  FIG.   9),   and  a  bit  train  of  the  compressed<br>
data  block  is   then  expanded   (e.g.,   ST1005   in  FIG.   15). The  system  is  constituted  by  a  combination  of:<br>
(a)	an  encoding  processing  including:<br>

a  data  restoration  means   (e.g.,   501N  to  503N  in FIG.   23)   for  detecting  the  coding  header  from  the compressed  unit  data  block   (CUOl*  to  CU04*)   received  by the  receiver  means   (503N),   for  detecting  a  location  of the  continuous  pixel  data  in  accordance  with  a  content of  the  detected  coding  header,   for  obtaining  from  the detected  location  the  continuous  pixel  data  as  well  as the  pixel  data  subsequent  to  the  continuous  pixel  data, and  for  restoring  an  uncompressed  pixel  data  block  of the  one  compression  unit  representing  data  which  is  not subjected  to  a  data  compression  by  the  compressed  data generating  means   (e.g.,   5001  to  5031   in  FIG.   23).<br>
According  to  the  encoding  method  of  the  present invention,   three  or  more  types  of  pixel  data  are<br>
compressed  on  the  basis  of  at   least  rules   2   to  4   of  the following  rules   1   to  6.     Assume  that  pixel  data indicating   respective  pixel  dots   consists   of   2   bits. <rule>     For  Continuous   1  To  3   Identical  Pixel  Data:<br>
One  data  unit  consists  of  4  bits.     The  first 2  bits  represent  the  number  of  pixels  followed.     The next  2  bits  represent  pixel  data   (image  compressed  data PXD). <example><br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "11")   is one,   then  PXD  =  01-11.<br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "10")   is two,   then  PXD  =   10-10.<br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "00")   is three,   then  PXD  =  11-00. <rule>     For  Continuous   4  To  15   Identical  Pixel  Data:<br>
One  data  unit  consists  of  8  bits.     The  first  2 bits  are  set  to   "00".     The  subsequent  4  bits  represent the  number  of  pixels  followed.     The  next  2  bits represent  pixel  data. <example><br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "01")   is five,   then  PXD  =   00-0101-01. <rule>     For  Continuous   16  To  63   Identical  Pixel  Data:<br>
One  data  unit  consists  of   12  bits.     The   first 4  bits  are  set  to   "0000".     The  subsequent  6  bits represent  the  number  of  pixels  followed.     The  next<br>
2  bits  represent  pixel  data. <example><br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "10")   is 16,   then  PXD  =  0000-010000-10.<br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "11")   is 46,   then  PXD  =  0000-101110-11.<br><rule>    For  Continuous   64  To  255   Identical  Pixel Data:<br>
One  data  unit  consists  of   16  bits.     The  first 6  bits  are  set  to   "000000".     The  subsequent  8  bits represent  the  number  of  pixels   followed.     The  next 2  bits  represent  pixel  data. <example><br>
If  the  number  of  pixels   followed   (e.g.,   "01")   is 255,   then  PXD  =  000000-11111111-01.<br><rule>     For  Continuous  Identical  Pixel  Data  Up  To  The End  Of  Line  Of  Pixel  Data  String  To  Be Run-Length  Coded:<br>
One  data  unit  consists  of   16  bits.     The  first<br>
14  bits  are  set  to  "00000000000000".     The  next  2  bits<br>
represent  pixel  data.	,|t<br><exantple><br>
If  identical  pixels   (e.g.,   "00")  continues  to  the end  of  a  line,   then  PXD  =  00000000000000-00.<br>
If  identical  pixels   (e.g.,   "11")  continues  to  the end  of  a  line,   then  PXD  =  00000000000000-11. <rule>     For  Non-Byte-Aligned  State  At  The  End  Of<br>

Four-bit  dummy  data   "0000"   is  added  to  the  end  of a  line. <example><br>

Encoding  and  decoding  methods  according  to  an embodiment  of  the  present  invention  will  be  described below  with  reference  to  the  accompanying  drawings.     In<br>
order  to  avoid  a  repetitive  description,   the  same reference  numerals  denote  parts  having  the  same functions   throughout  the  drawings.<br>
FIGS. 1 to 27 are views for explaining an image information encoding/decoding system according to an embodiment  of  the  present  invention.<br>
FIG.   1  schematically  shows  the  structure  of  data recorded  on  double-sided  optical  disk  OD  as  an information  holding  medium  to  which  the  present invention  can  be  applied.<br>
Optical  disk  OD  is  a  double-sided  optical  disk. Each  surface  of  this  optical  disk  has  a  storage capacity  of  about  5  Gbytes.     Many  recording  tracks  are arranged  between  the   lead-in  area  on  the  inner peripheral  side  of  the  disk  and  the  lead-out  area  on the  outer  peripheral   side  of   the  disk.      Each  track  is constituted  by  many  logical   sectors.     Various  pieces  of information   (compressed  digital  data)   are  stored  in  the respective  sectors.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the logical structure of data to be recorded on the optical disk in FIG. 1. More specifically, a system area in which system data used by disk OD is stored, a volume management information area, and a plurality of file areas are formed in the aggregate  of   logical   sectors   in  FIG.   1.<br>
Of   the  plurality  of   file  areas,   for  example,   file 1   contains  main  picture  information   ("VIDEO"   in<br>
FIG.   2),   sub-picture  information   ("SUB-PICTURE"   in FIG.   2)   having  contents   supplementary  to  the  main picture  information,   audio  information   ("AUDIO"   in FIG.   2),   playback  information   ("PLAYBACK   INFO."   in FIG.   2),   and  the  like.<br>
FIG.   3  shows  an  example  of  the  logical  structure of  a  sub-picture  information  pack  being  subjected  to the  encoding   (or  the  run-length  compression).<br>
As   shown  at  the  upper  portion  of  FIG.   3,   one  pack of   the  sub-picture  information  contained  in  the  video data   is   constituted  by,   for  example,   2048  bytes.     This one  pack  sub-picture   information  includes  one  or  more sub-picture  packets   subsequent  to  the  header  of   the leading  pack.     The  first  sub-picture  packet  is  provided with  run-length-compressed  sub-picture  data   (SP  DATAl) after  its  packet  header.     Similarly,   the  second sub-picture  packet  is  provided  with  run-length-compressed  sub-picture  data   (SP  DATA2)   after  its  packet header.<br>
Sub-picture  unit  header  31  is  assigned  to  sub-picture  data  unit  30  which  is  obtained  by  gathering a  plurality  of  sub-picture  data  pieces   (SP  DATAl,   SP DATA2,    ...).     Here,   the  gathered  sub-picture  data pieces  constitute  one  unit  of  the  run-length compression.     Following  after  sub-picture  unit  header 31   is  pixel  data   32  obtained  by  run-length-compressing the  picture  data  of  one  unit  which  is,   for  example,<br>
image  data  on  one  horizontal   (scanning)   line  of  a two-dimensional  display  screen.<br>
In  other  words,   one  unit  of  run-length-compressed data   30   is   formed  of  a  group  of   the  sub-picture  data pieces   (SP  DATAl,   SP  DATA2,    ...)   of  one  or  more  sub-picture  packets.     In  short,   sub-picture  data  unit  30  is constituted  by  sub-picture  unit  header   31,   in  which various  parameters  for  sub-picture  displaying  are recorded,   and  display  data   (compressed  pixel  data)   32 formed  of  run-length  codes.<br>
FIG.   4   shows   the  contents  of   sub-picture  unit header  31   in  one  unit  of  run-length  compressed  data  30 in  FIG.   3.     The  data  of  a  sub-picture   (e.g.,   subtitles corresponding  to  a  scene  in  a  movie)   to  be  recorded/ transmitted   (communicated)   together  with  a  main  picture (e.g.,   a  picture  of  the  movie)  will  be  described  below.<br>
As  will  be  seen  from  FIG.   4,   recorded  in  sub-picture  unit  header  31  are:   start  address  SPDDADR  of sub-picture  pixel  data   (display  data);   end  address SPEDADR  of  pixel  data   32;   data  SPDSIZE  of   the  display-start  position  and  display  area   (width  and  height)   of pixel  data   32  with  respect  to  a  TV  display  screen; background   color  SPCHI   designated  by  the   system; sub-picture  color  SPCINFO  designated  by  the  system; pallet  color  number  SPADJINFO  of  an  emphasizing  color designated  by  the  system;   modification  information SPMOD  of   sub-picture  pixel  data   32;   mixing  ratio  SPCONT<br>
of sub-picture (SP) to main-picture (MP); start-timing (corresponding to the frame number of MP) SPDST of the sub-picture; and start addresses SPLinel to SPLineN of decode  data  of  respective  lines.<br>
More  specifically,   as  indicated  by  the  lower portion  in  FIG.   4,   various  parameters   (e.g.,   SPDDADR) having  the   following  contents   are  recorded  on   sub-picture  unit  header  31:<br>
(1)	the   start  address   information   (SPDDADR:<br>
an  address  relative  to  the  beginning  of   the  header)   of the  display  data   (sub-picture  pixel  data)   following  the header;<br>
(2)	the  end  address  information   (SPEDADR:   an address  relative  to  the  beginning  of  the  header)   of  the display  data;<br>
(3)	information (SPDSIZE) indicating the display start position and display range (width and height) of the  display  data  on  the  monitor  screen;<br>
(4)	information   (SPCHI)   designated  by  the  system and  indicating  the  background  color   (a  16-color  palette number  set  by  a  story  information  table  or  a  display control   sequence  table);<br>
(5)	information  designated  by  the  system  and indicating  a  sub-picture  color   (a   16-color  palette number  set  by  the  story  information  table  or  the display  control  sequence  table);<br>
(6)	information   (SPAJDNFO)   designated  by  the<br>
system  and  indicating  a   sub-picture  emphasizing  color (a  color  palette  number  set  by  the  story  information table  or  the  display  control  sequence  table);<br>
(7)	information   (SPMOD)   designated  by  the  system and  specifying  the  sub-picture  image  mode  information indicating  either  a   field  mode  for  non-interlaced display  or  a  frame  mode  for  interlaced  display   (when the  pixel  data  to  be  compressed  is  defined  by  various number  of  bits,   the  number  of  bits  of  this  pixel  data can  be  specified  by  the  content  of  this  mode information);<br>
(8)	information   (SPCONT)   designated  by  the  system and  indicating  the  mixing  ratio  of   the  sub-picture  to the  main  picture;<br>
(9)	information   (SPDST)   indicating  the  display start  timing  of  the  sub-picture  with  the  frame  number (e.g.,   an   I  picture  frame  number  of  MPEG)   of  the  main picture;<br><br>
(10)	information   (SPlinl)   indicating  the  start address   (an  address  relative  to  the  beginning  of  the sub-picture  unit  header)   of  the  encoded  data  on  the first  line  of  the  sub-picture;   and<br>
(11)	information   (SPlinN)   indicating  the  start address   (an  address  relative  to  the  beginning  of  the sub-picture  unit  header)   of  the  encoded  data  on  the  Nth line  of  he  sub-picture.<br>
Note  that  information  SPCONT  indicating  the  mixing<br>
ration  of   the  sub-picture  to  the  main  picture  indicates the  mixing  ratio  of  the  sub-picture  with   (system  set value)/255,   and  the  mixing  ratio  of  the  main  picture with   (255   -   set  value)/255.<br>
Sub-picture  unit  header  31  includes  the  start address   (SPLine  1  to  SPLine  N)   of  data  to  be  decoded on  every  lines.     For  this  reason,   scrolling  of  only  the sub-picture  on  the  display  screen  can  be  realized  by changing  the  designation  of  a  decoding  start  line  in accordance  with  an  instruction  from  a  microcomputer (MPU  or  CPU)   on  the  decoding  side.      (How  the  scrolling is  performed  will  be  described  later  with  reference  to FIG.   21)<br>
A  field/frame  mode   (SPMOD)   can  be  recorded  on  sub-picture  unit  header  31  to  indicate  how  the  sub-picture corresponds  to  a  TV  field/frame  of  the  NTSC  scheme.<br>
In general, bit "0" is written in this field/frame mode recording portion (SPMOD). Upon reception of sub-picture data unit 30, the decoding side determines from bit "0" that the frame mode (non-interlaced mode) is set, and decodes the received encoded data in units of lines. As a result, a decoded image like the one shown at the lower left position in FIG. 8 is output from the decoder. This image is displayed on the display screen of  a  monitor,   a  television   (TV)   set,   or  the  like.<br>
If  bit   "1"   is  written  in  the  field/frame  mode recording  portion   (SPMOD),   the  decoding  side  determines<br>
that  the  field  mode   (interlaced  mode)   is   set.     In  this case,   after  the  encoded  data  is  decoded  in  units  of lines,   the  same  data  corresponding  to  two  lines  are consecutively  output,   as  shown  at  the  lower  right position  in  FIG.   8.     As  a  result,   a  frame  corresponding to  the  TV  interlaced  mode  can  be  obtained.     With  this operation,   an  image  twice  as   large  in  amount  as  that  in the  frame  mode   (non-interlaced  mode)   can  be  displayed with  the  same  data  amount,   although  the  image  quality is   lower  than  that  in  the  frame  mode.<br>
The  data   length   (variable  length)   of  the  pixel data   (run-length  data)   32  of   sub-picture  shown  in FIG.   3  or  4   is  determined  depending  on  whether  run-length  compression  rules  1  to  6  in  FIG.   5  or  run-length compression  rules   11  to  15   in  FIG.   6  are  used.<br>
Rules   1  to  6   in  FIG.   5  are  used  when  pixel  data  to be  compressed  has  a  multi-bit  configuration   (2  bits  in this   case).     Rules   11   to   15   in  FIG.   6   are  used  when pixel  data  to  be  compressed  has  a   1-bit  configuration.<br>
Whether  run-length  compression  rules   1  to  6  or  11 to   15  are  to  be  used  can  be  determined  by  the  contents (e.g.,   a  bit  width  flag)   of  parameter  SPMOD   (see  a portion  near  the  middle  of   the  table  shown  at  the  lower portion  in  FIG.   4)   in  sub-picture  unit  header  31.      If, for  example,   the  bit  width  flag  of  parameter  SPMOD  is "1",   the  pixel  data  to  be  run-length  compressed  is 2-bit  data,   and  hence  rules   1  to  6   in  FIG.   5  are  used.<br>
If  the  bit  width  flag  of  parameter  SPMOD  is   "0",   the pixel  data  to  be  run-length  compressed  is   1-bit  data, and  hence  rules   11  to   15   in  FIG.   6  are  used.<br>
Assume  that   four  groups  A,   B,   C,   and  D  of compression  rules  are  provided  respectively  for  four kinds  of  the  bit-configuration  of  pixel  data,   when  this pixel  data  can  optionally  have  the  bit-configuration  of either  of   1-bit,   2-bit,   3-bit,   and  4-bit.     Under  this assumption,  when  parameter  SPMOD  is  constituted  by 2-bit  flag,   the  1-bit  pixel  data  using  rule  group  A  can be  designated  by  the   2-bit  flag  of   "00" .     In  similar manner,   the  2-bit  pixel  data  using  rule  group  B  can  be designated  by  the   2-bit  flag  of   "01",   the   3-bit  pixel data  using  rule  group  C  can  be  designated  by  the   2-bit flag  of   "10",   and  the  4-bit  pixel  data  using  rule  group D  can  be  designated  by  the   2-bit   flag  of   "11".      In  this case,   rules   11   to  15  of  FIG.   6   can  be  used  for  the compression  rules  of  group  A,   and  rules   1   to  6  of FIG.   5  can  be  used  for  the  compression  rules  of  group B.     When  the  contents  of  coding  headers  and  the  bit-configuration  of  pixel  data,   as  well  as   the  number  of rules,   are  properly  modified,   the  compression  rules  of groups  C  and  D  will  be  derived   from  rules   1   to  6  of FIG.   5.<br>
FIG.   5   is  a  view  for  explaining  run-length compression  rules   1   to   6  which  are  used  in  an  encoding method  according  to  an  embodiment  of   the  present<br>
invention,   wherein  pixel  data  constituting  sub-picture pixel  data   (run-length  data)   32   in  FIG.   4  consists  of a  plurality  of  bits   (2  bits   in  this  case).<br>
FIG.   9  is  a  view  for  explaining  compression  rules 1  to  6,   in  detail,   in  a  case  wherein  pixel  data constituting  sub-picture  pixel  data   (run-length  data) 32  in  FIG.   4  consists  of   2  bits.<br>
According  to  rule  1  on  the  first  row  in  FIG.   5, when  1  to  3  identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded (run-length  compressed)   data  unit  is  constituted  by  4 bits.     In  this  case,   the  first  2  bits  represent  the number  of  pixels   followed,   and  the  next  2  bits represent  pixel  data   (pixel  color  information  or  the like).<br>
For  example,   first  compression  data  unit  CUOl  of picture  data  PXD  before  compressed,   which  is  indicated by  the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   9,   contains   2   2-bit  pixel data  dO,   dl  =   (0000)b   (b  indicates  binary  data).     In this  case,   2  identical   2-bit  pixel  data   (00)b  continue.<br>
In  this  case,   as  indicated  by  the  lower  portion  in FIG.   9,   2-bit  display  (10)b  representing  the  number  of pixels   followed   "2"   is  coupled  to  contents   (00)b  of  the pixel  data  to  form  dO,   dl  =   (1000)b,   which  is  data  unit CUOl*  of  picture  data  PXD  after  compressed.<br>
In  other  words,   (0000)b  of  data  unit  CUOl  is converted  into   (10000)b  of  data  unit  CUOl*  according  to rule   1.     In  this  case,   bit  length  compression  is  not<br>
practically  realized.     However,   for  example,   3 continuous  identical  pixels   (00)b,   i.e.,   CU01   = (000000)b,   are  compressed  into  CU01*   =   (1100)b.     That is,   the  pixel  data  can  be  compressed  by  2  bits.<br>
According  to  rule  2  on  the  second  row  in  FIG.   5, when  4   to  15   identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded data  unit  is   constituted  by  8  bits.      In  this   case,   the first   2  bits  represent  a  coding  header  indicating  that encoding  is  performed  according  to  rule  2,   the subsequent  4  bits  represent  the  number  of  pixels followed,   and  the  next   2  bits  represent  pixel  data.<br>
For  example,   second  compression  data  unit  CU02  of picture  data  PXD  before  compressed,   which  is  indicated by  the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   9,   contains   5   2-bit  pixel data  d2,   d3,   d4,   d5,   d6   =   (0101010101)b.     In  this  case, 5   identical   2-bit  pixel  data   (01)b  continue.<br>
In  this  case,   as  indicated  by  the  lower  portion  in FIG.   9,   coding  header   (00)b,   4-bit  display   (0101)b representing  the  number  of  pixels  followed   "5",   and contents   (01)b  of  the  pixel  data  are  coupled  to  each other  to  form  d2,   d6   =   (00010101)b,   which  is  data  unit CU02*  of  picture  data  PXD  after  compressed.<br>
In  other  words,   (0101010101)b   (10-bit   length)   of data  unit  CU02   is  converted  into   (00010101)b   (8-bit length)   of  data  unit  CU02*  according  to  rule   2.     In this  case,   the   10-bit  data  is  compressed  into  the  8-bit data,   i.e.,   the  substantial  bit  length  compression<br>
amount  corresponds  to  only  2  bits.     If,   however,   the number  of  pixels   followed  is   15   (which  corresponds  to a   30-bit  length  because   15   "Ol"s  of  CU02  continue),   the data  is  compressed  into  8-bit  data   (CU02*   =  00111101). That  is,   30-bit  data  can  be  compressed  by  22  bits.     The bit  compressing  effect  based  on  rule   2  is  therefore larger  than  that  based  on  rule  1.     In  order  to  cope with  run-length  compression  of  a  fine  image  with  high resolution,   rule   1   is  also  required.<br>
According  to  rule  3  on  the  third  row  in  FIG.   5, when   16  to  63  identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded data  unit  is   constituted  by  12  bits.      In  this  case,   the first  4  bits  represent  a  coding  header  indicating  that encoding  is  performed  according  to  rule  3,   the subsequent  6  bits  represent  the  number  of  pixels followed,   and  the  next   2  bits   represent  pixel  data.<br>
For  example,   third  compression  data  unit  CU03  of picture  data  PXD  before  compressed,   which  is  indicated by  the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   9,   contains   16   2-bit  pixel data  d7  to  d22  =   (101010   •••   1010)b.     In  this  case,   16 identical   2-bit  pixel  data   (10)b  continue.<br>
In  this  case,   as   indicated  by  the   lower  portion  in FIG.   9,   coding  header   (0000)b,   6-bit  display   (010000)b representing  the  number  of  pixels   followed   "16",   and contents   (10)b  of   the  pixel  data  are  coupled  to  each other  to   form  d7   to  d22   =   (000001000010)b,   which  is data  unit  CU03*  of  picture  data  PXD  after  compressed.<br>
In  other  words,   (101010   •••   I010)b   (32-bit  length) of  data  unit  CU03   is   converted  into   (000001000010 )b (12-bit  length)   of  data  unit  CU03*  according  to  rule  3. In  this   case,   the   32-bit  data   is  compressed  into  the 12-bit  data,   i.e.,   the  substantial  bit   length compression  amount  corresponds   to   20  bits.      If, however,   the  number  of  pixels   followed  is   63   (which corresponds  to  a   126-bit  length  because  63   "10"s  of CU03  continue),   the  data  is  compressed  into  12-bit  data (CU03*  =  000011111110).     That  is,   126-bit  data  can  be compressed  by  114  bits.     The  bit  compressing  effect based  on  rule  3   is  therefore  larger  than  that  based  on rule  2.<br>
According  to  rule  4  on  the  fourth  row  in  FIG.   5, when  64  to  255  identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded data  unit  is  constituted  by   16  bits.      In  this   case,   the first  6  bits  represent  a  coding  header  indicating  that encoding  is  performed  according  to  rule  4,   the subsequent  8  bits  represent  the  number  of  pixels followed,   and  the  next  2  bits  represent  pixel  data.<br>
For  example,   fourth  compression  data  unit  CU04  of picture  data  PXD  before  compressed,   which  is   indicated by  the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   9,   contains   69   2-bit  pixel data  d23  to  d91   =   (111111   •••  llll)b.     In  this  case,   69 identical   2-bit  pixel  data   (ll)b  continue.<br>
In  this  case,   as   indicated  by  the  lower  portion in  FIG.   9,   coding  header   (000000)b,   8-bit  display<br>
 (00100101)b  representing  the  number  of  pixels   followed "69",   and  contents   (ll)b  of  the  pixel  data  are  coupled to  each  other  to  form  d23  to  d91   =   (0000000010010111)b, which   is  data  unit  CU04*   of   picture  data   PXD  after compressed.<br>
In  other  words,   (111111   •••  llll)b   (138-bit length)   of  data  unit  CU04   is  converted  into (00000000l00l0lll)b   (16-bit  length)   of  data  unit  CU04* according  to  rule  4.     In  this  case,   the  138-bit  data  is compressed  into  the  16-bit  data,   i.e.,   the  substantial bit  length  compression  amount  corresponds  to  122  bits. If,   however,   the  number  of  pixels   followed  is   255 (which  corresponds  to  a  510-bit  length  because  255 "ll"s  of  CU04  continue),   the  data  is  compressed  into 16-bit  data   (CU04*  =  0000001111111111).     That  is, 510-bit  data  can  be  compressed  by  494  bits.     The  bit compressing  effect  based  on  rule  4   is   therefore  larger than  that  based  on  rule  3.<br>
According  to  rule  5  on  the   fifth  row  in  FIG.   5, when  identical  pixels  continue  from  a  switching  point of  a  data  unit  of  encoding  to  the  end  of  a  line,   one encoded  data  unit  is  constituted  by  16  bits.     In  this case,   the  first  14  bits  represent  a  coding  header indicating  that  encoding  is  performed  according  to  rule 5,   and  the  next   2  bits  represent  pixel  data.<br>
For  example,   fourth  compression  data  unit  CU05  of picture  data  PXD  before  compressed,   which  is  indicated<br><br>
by  the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   9,   contains  one  or  more 2-bit  pixel  data  d92  to  dn  =   (000000   •••  0000)b.     In this  case,   a   finite  number  of   identical   2-bit  pixel data   (00)b  continue.     According  to  rule  5,   however,   the number  of  pixels   followed  may  be  1  or  more.<br>
In  this  case,   as  indicated  by  the  lower  portion  in FIG.   9,   coding  header   (00000000000000)b  is  coupled contents   (00)b  of  the  pixel  data  to  form  d92   to  dn  » (0000000000000000)b,   which  is  data  unit  CU05*  of picture  data  PXD  after  compressed.<br>
In  other  words,   (000000   -  0000)b   (unspecified bit  length)   of  data  unit  CU05  is  converted  into (0000000000000000)b   (16-bit  length)   of  data  unit  CU05* according  to  rule  5.     According  to  rule  5,   if  the number  of  pixels   followed  up  to  the  end  of  a   line  is   16 or  more,   a  compressing  effect  can  be  obtained.<br>
According  to  rule  6  on  the  sixth  row  in  FIG.   5,   if the  length  of   1-line  compressed  data  PXD  is  not  an integer  multiple  of   8  bits   (i.e.,   not  byte-aligned)   at the  end  of  a  pixel  line  on  which  data  to  be  encoded  are arranged,   4-bit  dummy  data  is  added  to  the  1-line compressed  data  to  make  1-line  compressed  data  PXD coincide  with  a  byte  unit   (i.e.,   for  byte-aligning).<br>
For  example,   the  total  bit  length  of  data  units CU01*   to  CU05*  of  picture  data  PXD  after  compressed, which  is   indicated  by  the  lower  portion  in  FIG.   9,   is always  an  integer  multiple  of   4  bits.     However,   this<br>
length   is   not   always   an   integer  multiple   of   8   bits.<br>
If,   for  example,   the  total  bit  length  of  data units   CU01*   to  CU05*   is   1020,   and   4   bits   are   required for  byte-aligning,   4-bit  dummy  data  CU06*   =   (0000)b  is added  to  the  end  of   the   1020-bit  data  to  output  data units   CU01*   to  CU06*   as   byte-aligned   1024-bit  data.<br>
Note   that   2-bit  pixel   data   is   not   limited   to  data representing   four  types  of   pixel   colors.     For  example, pixel  data   (00)b  may  represent  a  background  pixel  of a  sub-picture;   pixel  data   (01)b,   a  pattern  pixel  of  the sub-picture;   pixel  data   (10)b,   the   first  emphasizing pixel  of  the  sub-picture,   and  pixel  data   (ll)b,   the second  emphasizing  pixel  of   the  sub-picture.<br>
As   the  number  of   bits   constituting   pixel   data becomes   larger,   more  types  of   sub-picture  pixels   can  be designated.      If,   for  example,   pixel  data   is   constituted by  3-bit  data   (000)b  to   (lll)b,   a  maximum  of  eight types   of   pixel   colors   +   pixel   types   (emphasizing effects)   can  be  designated  in  sub-picture  data  to  be run-length  encoded/decoded.<br>
FIG.   6   is   a  view  for  explaining   run-length compression  rules   11   to   15  which  are  used  in  an encoding  method  according  to  another  embodiment  of   the present  invention  wherein  pixel  data  constituting  sub-picture  pixel   data   (run-length  data)   32   in   FIG.   4 consists  of  one  bit.<br>
According   to  rule   11   on  the   first   row   in   FIG.   6,<br>
when  1  to  7  identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded (run-length  compressed)   data  unit  is  constituted  by  4 bits.     In  this  case,   the  first   3  bits  represent  the number  of  pixels  followed,   and  the  next   1  bit  represents pixel  data   (information  such  as  a  pixel  type).     If,   for example,   1-bit  pixel  data   "0",   it  indicates  a  background pixel  of  a  sub-picture.     If  this  data  is   "1",   it indicates  a  pattern  pixel  of  the  sub-picture.<br>
According  to  rule  12  on  the  second  row  in  FIG.   6, when  8  to  15  identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded data  unit  is  constituted  by  8  bits.     In  this  case,   the first  3  bits  represent  a  coding  header   (e.g.,   0000) indicating  that  encoding  is  based  on  rule  12,   the subsequent  4   bits  represent  the  number  of  pixels followed,   and  the  next  1  bit  represents  pixel  data.<br>
According  to  rule  13  on  the  third  row  in  FIG.   6, when  16  to  127  identical  pixels  continue,   one  encoded data  unit  is  constituted  by  12  bits.     In  this  case,   the first  4  bits  represent  a  coding  header   (e.g.,   0000) indicating  that  encoding  is  based  on  rule  13,   the subsequent  7  bits  represent  the  number  of  pixels followed,   and  the  next  1  bit  represents  pixel  data.<br>
According  to  rule  14  on  the  fourth  row  in  FIG.   6, when  identical  pixels  continue  from  a  switching  point of  a  data  unit  of  encoding  to  the  end  of  a   line,   one encoded  data  unit  is  constituted  by  8  bits.     In  this case,   the  first  7  bits  represent  a  coding  header<br>
 (e.g.,   0000000)   indicating  that  encoding   is   performed according   to   rule   14,   and   the  next   1   bit   represents pixel  data.<br>
According   to  rule   15   on   the   sixth  row  in  FIG.   6, if   the   length  of   1-line  compressed  data  PXD   is  not  an integer  multiple  of   8  bits   (i.e.,   not  byte-aligned)   at the  end  of   a  pixel   line  on  which  data  to  be  encoded  are arranged,   4-bit  dummy  data  is  added  to  the   1-line compressed  data  to  make  1-line  compressed  data  PXD coincide  with  a  byte  unit   (i.e.,   for  byte-aligning).<br>
An  image  encoding  method   (an  encoding  method  using run-length   coding)   will  be  described   in  detail   next with  reference  to  FIG.   7.<br>
FIG.   7   shows  a  case  wherein  pixel  data constituting  sub-picture  pixel  data   (run-length  data) 32   in  FIG.   4   is   constituted  by  the  first  to  ninth lines,   2-bit  pixels   (having  a  maximum  of   four  types  of contents)   are  arranged  on  each   line,   and  character patterns   "A"   and   "B"   are  expressed  by  the   2-bit  pixels on  the  respective   lines.     The  manner  of  encoding   (run-length  compressing)   the  pixel  data  on  each   line  will  be described  in  detail  below.<br>
As   indicated  by  the  upper  portion   in   FIG.   7,   an image  as   a   source   is   constituted  by  three   types   (a maximum  of   four   types)   of   pixel   data.      That   is,   2-bit image  data   (00)b  represents   the   pixel   color   of   the background  of   the   sub-picture;   2-bit   image  data   (01)b,<br>
the  pixel   color  of   characters   "A"   and   "B"   in  the sub-picture;   and  2-bit  image  data   (10)b,   an  emphasizing pixel  color  with  respect  to  sub-picture  characters   "A" and   "B".<br>
When  the  original  image  containing  characters   "A" and   "B"   is   scanned  by  a  scanner  or  the  like,   these character  patterns  are  read,   from  the  left  to  right  of each  scanning  line,   in  units  of  pixels.     The  picture data  read  in  this  manner  is   input  to  an  encoder (denoted  by  reference  numeral   200  in  the  embodiment  in FIG.   10  which  will  be  described   later)   for  performing run-length  compression  based  on  the  present  invention.<br>
This  encoder  can  be  constituted  by  a  microcomputer (MPU  or  CPU)   in  which  software  for  executing  run-length compression  based  on  rules   1   to  6  described  with reference  to  FIG.   5  runs.     This  encoder  software  will be  described  later  with  reference  to  the  flow  charts   in FIGS.   13  and   14.<br>
Encoding  processing  of   run-length  compressing a  sequential  bit  string  of  character  pattern   "A"   and "B"   read  in  units  of  pixels  will  be  described  below. In  the  case  shown  in  FIG.   7,   a  source  image  is assumed  to  have  three  color  pixels.     More   specifically, in  picture  data   (the   sequential   bit   string  of   character patterns   "A"   and   "B")   to  be  encoded,   background  color pixel   "•"   is  represented  by  2-bit  pixel  data   (00)b, character  color  pixel   "#"   is   represented  by   2-bit   pixel<br>
data   (01)b,   and  emphasizing  color  pixel   "O"   is represented  by  2-bit  pixel  data   (10)b.     The  bit  count (=   2)   of  pixel  data   (e.g.,   00  or  01)   is  also  called a  pixel  width.<br>
For  the  sake  of   simplicity,   in  the  case  shown   in FIG.   7,   the  display  width  of   picture  data   (sub-picture data)   to  be  encoded  is   set  to  be  16  pixels,   and  the number  of   scanning   lines   (display  height)   is  set  to  be 9   lines.<br>
Image data (sub-picture data) obtained from a scanner is temporarily converted into a run-length value  by  the  microcomputer.<br>
Consider  the   first   line   at   the   lower  portion   in FIG.   7.     Three  continuous  pixels   "•  •  •  "   are  converted into   (•  *3);   subsequent   1  pixel   "0",   (0*1);   subsequent   1 pixel   "#",    (#*1);   subsequent   1   pixel   "O" ,   (C  *1); subsequent  continuous   3  pixels   "••••",   (●  *3);   subsequent 1   pixel   "O",   (O  *1);   subsequent  continuous   4  pixels "####",   (#*4);   subsequent   1   pixel   "O",   (!{*1);   and   last 1   pixel   "•" ,    (●*1).<br>
As  a  result,   as  indicated  by  the  intermediate portion  in  FIG.   7,   the  run-length  data   (before compressed)   on  the   first   line  becomes "● *3/0  *l/#*l/0  *l/●  *3/C&gt;  *l/#*4/0  *1/●  *l".     This data   is   constituted  by  a   combination  of   image   information   such   as   a   character   color   pixel,   and   the   number   of pixels   followed  which  represents   a  continuation  count.<br>
Similarly,   the  pixel  data   strings   on  the   second  to ninth  lines   indicated  by  the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   7 become  the  run-length  data  strings  on  the  second  to ninth   lines   indicated  by  the   intermediate   portion   in FIG.   7.<br>
Consider  the  data  on  the   first   line.     Since   3 background  color  pixels   "•  •  •  "   continue  from  the  start of   the  line,   compression  rule   1   in  FIG.   5   is  used.     As a  result,   first  three  pixels   "•  •  •  ",   i.e.,   (•  *3),   on the  first  line  are  encoded  into   (1100),   which  is  a combination  of   2  bits   (11)   representing   "3"   and   (00) representing  background  color  pixel   "#".<br>
Since  the  next  data  on  the   first   line  is   1   pixel "O",   rule   1   is  used.     As  a  result,   next  pixel   "O", i.e.,   (O  *1),   on  the   first  line  is  encoded  into   (0110), which  is  a  combination  of   2  bits   (01)   representing   "1" and   (10)   representing  emphasizing  color  pixel   "   ". Since  the  next  data  is   1   pixel   "#",   rule   1   is used.     As  a  result,   next  pixel   "#",   i.e.,   (#*1),   on  the first   line   is   encoded  into   (0101),   which   is   a combination  of   2  bits   (01)   representing   "1"   and   (01) representing   character  color  pixel   "#"    (the  portions corresponding  to  pixels   "###..."   are  enclosed  with  the broken  lines   in  the   intermediate  and   lower  portions   in FIG.   7).<br>
Similarly,   (O  *1)   is  encoded  into   (0110);    (●  *3), (1100);   and   (O  *1),    (0110) .<br>
Since  the  subsequent  data  on  the  first  line  are   4 pixels   "####",   compression  rule  2  in  FIG.   5  is   used. As   a  result,   pixels   "####",   i.e.,   (#*4),   on  the  first line  are  encoded   into   (00010001),   which  is   a combination  of   2-bit  header   (00)   representing  that  rule 2   is  used,   4   bits   (0100)   representing  the  number  of pixels   followed   "4",   and   (01)   representing  character color  pixel   "#"    (the  portions   corresponding  to   "#"   are enclosed  with  the  broken  lines   in  FIG.   7).<br>
Since  the   subsequent  data  on  the  first  line  is   1 pixel   "O",   rule  1   is  used.     As  a  result,   pixel   "O", i.e.,    (0*1),   is  encoded  into   (0110),   which  is  a combination  of   2  bits   (01)   representing   "1"   and   (10) representing  emphasizing  color  pixel   "O" •<br>
Since  the  last  data  on  the  first  line  is   1   "•", rule   1   is  used.     As  a  result,   pixel   "•",   i.e.,   (0*1), is  encoded  into   (0100),   which  is  a  combination  of   2 bits   (01)   representing   "1"   and   (00)   representing background  color  pixel   "•".<br>
In  the  above  manner,   run-length  data "●  *3/0  *l/#*l/0 *1/●  *3/0  *l/#*4/0  *l/●  *l"   (before compressed)   on  the  first  line  is  run-length  compressed into   (1100)    (0110)    (0101)    (0110)    (1100)    (0110) (00010001)    (0110)    (0100),   thereby  completing   the encoding  of   the  first   line.<br>
In   the   same  manner  as   described  above,   encoding proceeds   up  to  the  eighth  line.     All   the  data  on  the<br>
ninth  line  are  identical  background  color  pixels "●●●...".      In  this   case,   compression  rule   5   in  FIG.   5 is  used.     As  a  result,   run-length  data   "●  *16"   (before compressed)   on  the  ninth  line  is  encoded  into   16-bit data   (0000000000000000),   which  is  a  combination  of 14-bit  header   (00000000000000)   representing   that identical  background  color  pixels   "•  •  •  ..."   continue  to the  end  of   the   line  and  2-bit  pixel  data   (00) representing  background  color  pixel   "●".<br>
Note that encoding based on rule 5 is used when data to be compressed starts midway along a line and continues  to  the  end  of  the  line.<br>
FIG.   10   is   a  block  diagram  for  explaining   the   flow of  processing  from  the  step  of  mass-producing high-density  optical  disks  having  image  information encoded  on  the  basis  of  the  present  invention  to  the step  of  playing  back  the  information  on  the  user  side, together  with  the  flow  of   processing  from  the  step  of broadcasting/cable-distributing  image  information encoded  on  the  basis  of  the  present  invention  to  the step  of  receiving/playing  back  the  information  on  the user/subscriber  side.<br>
Assume  that  run-length  data  before  compressed  like the  one  shown  at  the  intermediate  portion  in  FIG.   7   is input  to  encoder  200   in  FIG.   10.      Encoder   200  performs run-length  compression   (encoding)   of   the   input  data  by software  processing  based  on  compression  rules   1   to   6<br>
in  FIG.   5.<br>
When  data  of  a  logic  structure   like  the  one  shown in   FIG.   2   is   to  be  recorded  on  optical  disk  OD  in FIG.   1,   encoder   200   in  FIG.   10   performs   run-length compression  processing   (encoding  processing)  with respect   to   sub-picture  data   in   FIG.   3.<br>
Various  data   required  to   complete  optical  disk  OD are  also  input  to  encoder   200   in   FIG.   10.     These  data are  compressed  on  the  basis  of,   e.g.,   the  standards  of MPEG   (Motion  Picture  Expert  Group),   and  the  compressed digital  data  are  sent  to  laser  cutting  machine  202  or modulator/transmitter  210.<br>
In   laser  cutting  machine   202,   the  MPEG-compressed data  from  encoder  200  is  recorded  on  a  mother  disk   (not shown)   to  manufacture  optical  disk  master  204.<br>
In  two-sided  high-density  optical  disk  production plant  206,   the  information  of  master  204   is   transferred onto,   e.g.,   a   laser  beam  reflecting   film  on  a  0.6-mm thick  polycarbonate  base.     Two   large-capacity polycarbonate  base  on  which  different  pieces  of  master information  are  respectively  transferred  are   joined  to each  other  to  form  a   1.2-mm  thick  two-sided  optical disk   (or  a  two-sided  disk  having  one  information  read surface).<br>
Double-sided  high-density  optical   disks   OD mass-produced  by  plant   206   are  distributed   to  various types  of  markets  and  to  users<br>
Distributed  disk  OD  is  played  back  by  disk  player 300  of  the  user.     Disk  player  300  includes  decoder  101 for  decoding  data  encoded  by  encoder  200   into  original information.     The  information  decoded  by  decoder   101 is   sent  to,   e.g.,   a  monitor  TV  of  the  user  to  be visualized.      In  this  manner,   the  end  user  can  enjoy the  original  picture  information  from  large-capacity disk  OD.<br>
The  compressed  information  sent  from  encoder  200 to  modulator/transmitter  210   is  modulated  in  accordance with  predetermined  standards  and  transmitted.     For example,   the  compressed  picture  information  from encoder  200   is  broadcasted  through  a  satellite   (212), through  corresponding  audio  information.     Alternatively, the  compressed  picture  information  from  encoder  200   is transmitted  through  a  cable   (212),   together  with corresponding  audio  information.<br>
The  compressed  picture/audio  information broadcasted  or  transmitted  through  the  cable  is received  by  receiver/demodulator  400  of  a  user  or subscriber.     Receiver/demodulator  400   includes  decoder 101   for  decoding  the  data  encoded  by  encoder  200   into the  original  information.     The  information  decoded  by decoder   101   is   sent  to,   e.g.,   the  monitor  TV  of   the user  to  be  visualized.      In  this  manner,   the  end  user can  enjoy  the  original   picture   information   from  the compressed  picture  information  broadcasted  or<br>
transmitted  through  the  cable.<br>
FIG.   11   is  a  block  diagram  showing  an  embodiment (non-interlaced  specification)   of  decoder  hardware  for executing  image  decoding   (run-length  expansion)   based on  the  present  invention.     Decoder   101   (see  FIG.   10) for  decoding  run-length  compressed  sub-picture  data  SPD (corresponding  to  data   32   in  FIG.   3)   can  have  an arrangement  like  the  one  shown  in  FIG.   11.<br>
A  sub-picture  data  decoder  for  run-length expanding  a  signal  containing  run-length  compressed pixel  data  having  a  format   like  the  one  shown  in  FIG.   4 will  be  described  below  with  reference  to  FIG.   11.<br>
As   shown   in  FIG.   11,   decoder   101   comprises  data I/O   102   to  which   sub-picture  data   SPD   is   input;   memory 108   retaining  sub-picture  data  SPD;   memory  control   105 for  controlling  the  read  operation  of  memory  108; continuous  code  length  detector  106   for  detecting  the continuous  code  length   (coding  header)   of  one  unit   (one block)   from  the  run  information  of  encoded  data   (run-length  compressed  pixel  data)   read  out   from  memory   108, so  as   to  output   separation   information   for  the continuous   code  length;   coding  data  separator  103   for extracting  one-block  encoded  data   in  accordance  with the  information  from  continuous  code   length  detector 106;   run-length  setter  107   for  receiving  a  signal output   from  coding  data   separator   103  and  representing the  run  information  of  one  compression  unit,   together<br>
with  a  signal   (period  signal)   output  from  continuous code  length  detector  106  and  indicating  the  number  of continuous  bits   "0"s,   i.e.,   the  number  of  data  bits "0"s  continuing  from  the  start  of   the  coding  data  of one  block,   and  calculating  the  number  of   pixels followed  in  one  block   from  these   signals;   pix.   color out-stage  104   (Fast-in/Fast-out  type)   for  receiving pixel  color  information  from  coding  data  separator   103 and  the  period  signal  output  from  run-length  setter  107 and  outputting  the  color  information  only  for  the corresponding  interval;   microcomputer  112  for  loading the  header  data   (see  FIG.   4)   in  sub-picture  data  SPD read  out  from  memory  108,   and  performing  various  types of   processing  settings  and  control  operations  on  the basis  of  the  loaded  data;   address  control   109   for controlling  the  read/write  addresses  of  memory  108; insufficient  pix.   color  setter  111  in  which  color information  corresponding  to  a  line  on  which  no  run information  is  present  is   set  by  microcomputer  112;   and display  activator  110   for  determining  a  display  area, of  a  TV  screen  or  the  like,   in  which  a   sub-picture  is to  be  displayed.<br>
In  other  words,   as  described  in  FIG.   11, run-length  compressed  sub-picture  data  SPD  is   sent  to the  internal  bus  of  decoder   101  through  data   I/O  102. Sub-picture  data   SPD  sent  to  the  bus   is   supplied  to memory  108  through  memory  control   105   to  be  stored<br>
therein.     The  internal  bus  of  decoder  101   is   connected to  coding  data   separator   103,   continuous   code   length detector  106,   and  microcomputer   (MPU  or  CPU)   112.<br>
Sub-picture  unit  header  31  of   the  sub-picture  data obtained  from  memory  108   is  read  by  microcomputer  112. Microcomputer  112  detects   the  various  parameters   shown in  FIG.   4  from  read  sub-picture  unit  header  31.     In accordance  with  the  detected  parameters,   the  start address  of  decoding   (SPDDADR)   is  set  at  address controller  109;   display  activator  110  receives information   (SPDSIZE)   indicating  the  display  start position,   display  width,   and  display  height   of   the sub-picture;   and  coding  data  separator   103   receives display  width   (or  the  number  of  dots  of  the   line)   of the  sub-picture.     The  parameters  detected  by microcomputer  112  are  then  stored  in  the  internal registers  of   respective  circuit  blocks   (109,   110, and   103).     Thereafter,   microcomputer  112   can  access the  parameters   stored  in  the  circuit  blocks   (109,   110, and   103).<br>
Address   controller   109   accesses  memory   108   through memory  controller   105   in  response  to  the   starting address   (SPDDADR)   of   decoding   set  at  the   register  of controller   109,   sc   that   the   reading  of   the   sub-picture data  to  be  decoded  starts.     The  sub-picture  data  read from  memory  108   is   supplied  to  coding  data   separator 103   and   to   continuous   code   length  detector   106.<br>
The  coding  header   (2  to  14  bits  according  to  rules 2  to  5   in  FIG.   5)   of  run-length  compressed  sub-picture data  SPD  is  detected  by  continuous  code  length  detector 106.     The  number  of  continuous  pixels  of   identical pixel  data   in  sub-picture  data  SPD  is  detected  by  run-length  setter   107  based  on  a  signal  from  continuous code  length  detector  106.<br>
More  specifically,   continuous  code  length  detector 106   counts  the  number  of  bits  of   "0"   in  the  data  read from  memory  108  in  order  to  detect  the  coding  header (cf.   FIG.   5).      In  accordance  with  the  value  or  content of  the  detected  coding  header,   detector  106   supplies separation  information  SEP.INFO,   to  coding  data separator   103.<br>
In  response  to  separation  information  SEP.INFO., coding  data  separator   103   sets   the  continuous  pixel numbers   (run  information)   at  run  length  setter   107.     At the  same  time,   separator  103   sets   the  pixel  data (separated  data  indicating  the  pixel  color)   at  pixel color  output  stage   104  of  a  FIFO   (first-in/first-out) type.      In  this   case,   coding  data  separator  103   counts the  pixel  number  of  the  sub-picture  data,   and  compares the  counted  pixel  number  with  the  display  width   (or  the number  of   pixels  on  one   line)   of   the   sub-picture.<br>
Here,   if   no  byte-aligning  is   established  when   the decoding  of   one  line  is   completed   (or  if  the  bit   length of   one   line  data   is   not   the   integral   of   the  unit  of<br><br>
number   "8"),   coding  data  separator   10 3  discards  or neglects   the  trailing   4-bit  data  on  the   line,   regarding as   the  dummy  data  added  at  the   time  of   encoding.<br>
Run-length  setter   107   supplies   pixel  color  output stage   104  with  a   PERIOD  SIGNAL   for  outputting  the  pixel data,   based  on  the  continuous   pixel   number   (run information),   pixel   dot   clock   DOTCLK,   and  horizontal/ vertical   sync   signals  H-SYNC/V-SYNC.     Pixel  color output   stage   104   outputs   the  pixel   data   from  coding data   separator  103,   as   the  decoded  display  data,   during the  active  period  of   the  pixel  data  output  signal (PERIOD  SIGNAL),   or  during  the  period  of   outputting  the same  pixel  color.<br>
Within  the  above-mentioned  active  period  of  the PERIOD  SIGNAL,   if  the  start  line  of  decoding  is  changed by  the   instruction   from  microcomputer   112,   a  certain line(s)   having  no  run  information  could  exists.     When the  no-run-information   line(s)   is(are)   found  during  the decoding,   insufficient  pixel   color   setter   111   sends data   (COLOR   INFO.)   of   preset   insufficient  pixel   color to  pixel   color  output   stage   104.      Then,   pixel   color output   stage   104   outputs   the  data   (COLOR   INFO.)   of   the insufficient  pixel   color   from  insufficient  pixel   color setter   111,   so   long  as   the  no-run-information   line(s) is(are)   input  to  coding  data  separator   103.<br>
More  specifically,   in  the  case  of  decoder  101   in FIG.   11,   if   input   sub-picture  data   SPD  includes  no<br>
image  data,   microcomputer  112  sets  pixel  color information  as   shortage  data  in  insufficient  pix.   color setter  111.<br>
A  display  enable  signal   for  determining  a  specific position  on  a  monitor   screen   (not  shown)   at  which a  decoded  sub-picture  is  to  be  displayed  is   supplied from  display  activator  110  to  pix.   color  out-stage   104 in   synchronism  with   a   horizontal/vertical   sync   signal for  a   sub-picture  image.     Display  activator  110   sends a  color  switching  signal  to  pix.   color  out-stage   104   in accordance  with  a  color  information  instruction  from microcomputer  112.<br>
After  the  processing  settings  of  microcomputer 112,   address  control   109   sends  address  data  and  various timing  signals   to  memory  control   105,   continuous   code length  detector   106,   coding  data  separator  103,   and run-length  setter   107.<br>
When  a  pack  of   sub-picture  data  SPD  is   received through  data   I/O  102  and  stored  in  memory  108, microcomputer  112  reads  the  contents  of  the  pack  header of   data   SPD   (e.g.,   a   start  address  of  decoding,   an  end address  of  decoding,   a  display  start  position,   a display  width,   and  a  display  height).     Microcomputer 112   sets   a  start  address  of  decoding,   an  end  address  of decoding,   a  display  start  position,   a  display  width,   a display  height,   and  the  like  in  display  activator   110 on   the  basis   of   the  read   contents.     At   this   time,<br>
a   specific  bit  configuration  of  compressed  pixel  data (2-bit  pixel  data  in  this  case)   can  be  determined  by the  contents   of   sub-picture  unit  header   31   in  FIG.   4.<br>
The  operation  of  decoder  101   in  a  case  wherein compressed   pixel  data  has  a   2-bit  configuration   (rules 1   to   6   in  FIG.   5  are  used)  will  be  described.<br>
When  the  start  address  decoding  is   set  by microcomputer   112,   address  control   109   sends corresponding  address  data  to  memory  control   105, and  a  read  start  signal  to  continuous  code  length detector  106.<br>
In  response  to  the  sent  read  start   signal, continuous   code   length  detector   106   sends   a   read  signal to  memory  control   105  to   load  encoded  data   (compressed sub-picture  data  32).     Continuous   code   length  detector 106  then  checks  whether  all  the  upper  2  bits  of  the read  data  are   "0"s.<br>
If all the bits are not "0"s, it is determined that the block length of the unit of compression is 4   bits   (see   rule   1   in  FIG.   5).<br>
If  the  bits   (upper  2  bits)   are   "0"s,   the subsequent   2  bits   (upper  4  bits)   are  checked.      If  they are  not   "0"s,   it   is   determined  that   the  block   length  of the  unit   of   compression   is   8   bits   (see   rule   2   in FIG.   5).<br>
If   the  bits   (upper  4   bits)   are   "0"s,   the subsequent   2  bits   (upper  6   bits)   are  checked.      If   they<br>
are  not   "0"s,   it  is  determined  that  the  block  length  of the  unit  of  compression  is   12  bits   (see  rule   3   in FIG.   5).<br>
If  the  bits   (upper  6  bits)   are   "0"s,   the subsequent  8  bits   (upper  14  bits)   are  further  checked. If   they  are  not   "0"s,   it  is  determined  that  the  block length  of  the  unit  of  compression  is   16  bits   (see rule   4   in  FIG.   5).<br>
If  the  bits   (upper  14  bits)   are   "0"s,   it  is determined  that  the  block  length  of  the  unit  of compression  is   16  bits,   and   identical   pixel  data continue  up  to  the  end  of   the   line   (see  rule   5   in FIG.   5).<br>
If  the  number  of  bits  of  the  pixel  data  read  up  to the  end  of  the  line  is  an  integer  multiple  of   8,   the pixel  data  is  used  as  it  is.     If  the  number  of  bits   is not  an  integer  multiple  of   8,   it  is  determined  that 4-bit  dummy  data  is  required  at  the  end  of   the  read data  to  realize  byte-aligning   (see  rule  6   in  FIG.   5).<br>
Coding  data  separator   103  extracts   1-block  data (the  unit  of   compression)   of   sub-picture  data   32   from memory  108  on  the  basis  of   the  above  determination result  obtained  by  continuous  code  length  detector   106. Coding  data  separator   103   separates  the  extracted 1-block  data  into  the  number  of  pixels   followed  and pixel  data   (e.g.,   pixel  color  information).     The separated  data  of  the  number  of  pixels   followed<br>
 (RUN INFO.) is sent to run-length setter 107, and the separated pixel data (SEPARATED DATA) is sent to pix. color  out-stage   104.<br>
Display  activator   110  generates   a  display  enable signal   (enable   signal)   for  designating  a  sub-picture display  interval   in   synchronism  with  a  pixel  dot  clock (PIXEL-DOT  CLK),   a   horizontal   sync   signal   (H-SYNC),   and a  vertical   sync   signal   (V-SYNC)   in  accordance  with  the display  start  position  information,   the  display  width information,   and  the  display  height  information received  from  microcomputer   112.     This  display  enable signal  is  output  to  run-length  setter  107.<br>
Run-length  setter  107   receives  a  signal  output from  continuous   code  length  detector   106  and  indicating whether  the  current  block  data  continues  to  the  line end,   and  continuous   pixel  data   (RUN   INFO.)   from  coding data  separator   103.     On  the  basis  of  the  signal   from continuous   code  length  detector   106  and  the  data   from coding  data  separator   103,   run-length  setter  107 determines   the  number  of   pixel  dots  of  a  block  which  is being  decoded,   and  outputs   a   display  enable   signal (output  enable   signal)   to   pix.   color  out-stage   104 during  an  interval   corresponding  to  the  number  of  dots.<br>
Pix.   color  out-stage   104   is   enabled  during  an interval   in  which  an  period   signal   is   received   from run-length  setter   107.      In  this   interval,   pix.   color out-stage   104   sends   the  pixel  color  information<br>
received  from  coding  data  separator  103,   as  decoded display  data,   to  a  display  unit   (not  shown)   in synchronism  with  the  pixel  dot  clock   (PIXEL-DOT  CLK). That  is,   pix.   color  out-stage  104  outputs  the  same display  data  corresponding  to  the  pixel  pattern continuous  dots  of  the  block  which  is  being  decoded.<br>
Upon  determining  that  the  encoded  data  are identical  pixel  color  data  continuing  to  the   line  end, continuous  code  length  detector  106  outputs  a  signal for  a  continuous  code  length  of   16  bits  to  coding  data separator  103,   and  also  output,   to  run-length  setter 107,   a  signal  indicating  that  identical  pixel  data continue  up  to  the  line  end.<br>
Upon  reception  of  the  above  signal  from  continuous code  length  detector  106,   run-length  setter  107  outputs an  output  enable  signal   (period  signal)   to  pix.   color out-stage   104   to  keep  the  color  information  of  the encoded  data  in  an  enable  state  until  horizontal   sync signal  H-SYNC  is  inactivated.<br>
When  microcomputer  112  changes  the  start  line  of decoding  to  scroll  the  displayed  contents  of  a   sub-picture,   no  data   line  used  for  decoding  may  be  present in  a  preset  display  area   (i.e.,   a  decoding   line shortage  may  occur).<br>
In  decoder   101   in  FIG.   11,   in  order  to  cope  with such  a  case,   pixel   color  data  for  compensating  for  a line  shortage  is  prepared  in  advance.     When  a  line<br>
shortage  is  actually  detected,   the  current  display  mode is   switched  to  an  insufficient  pixel  color  data  display mode.     More  specifically,  when  a  data  end  signal   is supplied  from  address  control   109   to  display  activator 110,   display  activator  110  sends  a  color  switching signal   (COLOR  SW  SIGNAL)   to  pix.   color  out-stage   104. In  response  to  this  switching  signal,   pix.   color out-stage   104   switches  the  mode  of  outputting  decoded pixel  color  data  from  the  encoded  data  to  the  mode  of outputting  decoded  color  information   (COLOR  INFO.)   from display  activator  110.     This   switched  state  is  kept during  an   insufficient  line  display  interval   (DISPLAY ENABLE  =  active).<br>
When  the  above   line   shortage  occurs,   a  decoding operation  may  be  stopped  instead  of  using  insufficient pixel  color  data.<br>
More  specifically,   when,   for  example,   a  data  end signal  is   input   from  address   control   109   to  display activator   110,   a  color  switching  signal   for  designating a  display  stop  may  be  output   from  display  activator   110 to  pix.   color  out-stage  104.     Pix.   color  out-stage   104 keeps   stopping  the  display  of   a   sub-picture  during  an interval   in  which  this  display  stop  designation  color switching  signal  is  active.<br>
FIG.    8   shows   two  display  modes   (non-interlaced display  and  interlaced  display)   to  explain  how character  pattern   "A"   of   the  pixel  data   (sub-picture<br>
data)   encoded  in  FIG.   7   is  decoded.<br>
Decoder  101  in  FIG.   11  can  be  used  to  decode compressed  data  like  the  one  shown  at  the  upper  portion in  FIG.   8  into  interlaced  display  data  like  the  one shown  at  the  lower  left  portion  in  FIG.   8.<br>
In  contrast  to  this,   when   compressed  data   like  the one  shown  at   the  upper  portion  in  FIG.   8   is   to  be decoded  into  interlaced  display  data  shown  at  the   lower right  portion  in  FIG.   8,   a   line  doubler  for  scanning the  same  pixel   line  twice   (e.g.,   re-scanning  line  #10. in  an  even  field,  which  has  the  same  contents  as  those of   line  #1   in  an  odd  field;   switching  in  units  of V-SYNC  pulses)   is  required.<br>
When  an  image  display  amount  equivalent  to  that  in the  interlaced  display  mode  is  to  be  displayed  in  the non-interlaced  display  mode,   another  line  doubler (e.g.,   line  #10  having  the  same  contents  as   those  of line  #1  at  the  lower  end  portion  in  FIG.   8   is  made  to follow  line  #1;   switching  in  units  of  H-SYNC  pulses).<br>
FIG.   12  is  a  block  diagram  for  explaining  an embodiment   (interlaced  specifications)   of  decoder hardware  having  the  above  line  doubler  function. Decoder  101   in  FIG.   10  may  be  constituted  by  a  decoder having   the   arrangement   shown  in  FIG.   12.<br>
In  the  arrangement  in  FIG.   12,   microcomputer  112 detects   the  generation  timings  of  odd  and  even fields   in  the  interlaced  display  mode  on  the  basis  of<br>
a  horizontal/vertical   sync  signal   for  a  sub-picture.<br>
Upon  detection  of  an  odd  field,   microcomputer  112 supplies,   to  select  signal  generator  118,   a  mode  signal indicating  that  the  current   field  is  an  odd  field.     As a  result,   select  signal  generator  118  outputs  a  signal to  selector  115  to  select  decoded  data   from  decoder 101.     Decoder  101   then  outputs   the  pixel  data   (see  the lower  right  portion  in  FIG.   8)   of   lines   #1   to  #9   in  the odd  field,   as  an  video  output,   to  an  external  unit through  selector  115.     In  this  case,   the  pixel  data  of lines  #1  to  #9   in  the  odd  field  are  temporarily  stored in   line  memory  114.<br>
Upon  detecting  that  the  odd  field  has  shifted  to an  even  field,   microcomputer  112  supplies,   to  select signal  generator  118,   a  mode  signal   indicating  that  the current  field  is  an  even  field.     As  a  result,   select signal  generator  118  outputs  a  signal  to  selector  115 to  select  the  data  stored  in  line  memory  114.     Line memory  114  then  outputs  the  pixel  data   (see  the  lower right  portion  in  FIG.   8)   of   lines   #10  to  #18   in  the even  field,   as  a  video  output,   to  the  external  unit through  selector  115.<br>
In  this  manner,   the  sub-picture  image   (character "A"   in  FIG.   8)   of   lines   #1   to  #9   in  the  odd   field  is synthesized  with  the   sub-picture   image   (character   "A" in  FIG.   8)   of   lines   10#   to  #18   in  the  even  field, thereby  realizing  interlaced  display.<br>
Note  that  sub-picture  unit  header  31  of  the  sub-picture  data  in  FIG.   4  includes  a  parameter  bit   (SPMOD) indicating  a  frame  display  mode/field  display  mode  for a  TV  screen.<br>
For example, an image display amount equivalent to that in the interlaced display mode is displayed in the non-interlaced  display  mode  in  the   following  manner.<br>
Upon  loading  sub-picture  unit  header  31, microcomputer  112  in  FIG.   12  can  determine  from  the  set value  of  parameter  SPMOD   (active  =   "1";   inactive  =   "0") whether  the  interlaced  mode   (active   "1")   or  the non-interlaced  mode   (inactive   "0")   is   set.<br>
In  the  arrangement   in  FIG.   12,   if  parameter  SPMOD is  active  =   "1",   microcomputer  112  detects  that  the interlaced  mode  is   set,   and  sends  a  mode  signal indicating  the  interlaced  mode  to  select  signal generator  118.     Select  signal  generator  118   supplies  a switching  signal  to  selector   115  every  time  horizontal sync   signal  H-SYNC  is  generated.     Selector   115 alternately  switches  the  decoded  output   (decoded  data) of  the  current  field  from  decoder   101   and  the  decoded output  of  the  current  field  temporarily  stored  in  line memory  114   every  time  horizontal   sync   signal  H-SYNC   is generated,   and  outputs   a  video  output   to  an  external  TV set  or  the  like.<br>
When  the  current  decoded  data  and  the  decoded data   in   line  memory   114   are   switched   for  each  H-SYNC,<br>
a  picture  having  a  density   (the  number  of   horizontal scanning  lines)   twice  that  of  the  original  image (decoded  data)   is  displayed  on  the  TV  screen  in  the interlaced  mode.<br>
In  decoder  101  having  the  above  arrangement, sequentially  input  bit  data  are  read  by  2   to   16   bits while  being   counted  bit  by  bit   from  the  beginning   of a  decoded  data   unit  block,   and  are  decoded,   instead   of being  decoded  after  read  by  cne   line.      In   this   case, the  bit  length   (4  bits,   8  bits,   12  bits,   16  bits,   or the   like)   of  one  decoded  data  unit  is  detected immediately  before  a  decoding  operation.     For  example, compressed  pixel  data  is  decoded   (played  back)   into three  types  of  pixels   ("•",   "G",   and   "#"   in  FIG.   7)   in real  time  in  the  unit  of  the  detected  data   length.<br>
In  decoding  pixel  data  encoded  according  to  rules 1  to   6   in  FIG.   5,   decoder  101  may  have  a  bit  counter and  a  data  buffer   (line  memory  114  or  the   like)   having a  relatively  small   capacity.     In  other  words,   the circuit  arrangement  of  decoder  101  can  be  relatively simplified,   and  the  overall  apparatus   including  this encoder  can  be  reduced  in  size.<br>
That   is,   the  encoder  of   the  present   invention requires  no  large  code  table  in  the  coder  unlike   in  the conventional  MH  coding  method,   and  need  not  read  the same  data   twice   in  an  encoding  operation  unlike   in   the arithmetic  coding  method.      In  addition,   the  decoder  of<br>
the  present   invention  requires   no  relatively complicated  hardware  like  a  multiplier,   and  can  be realized  by  adding  simple  circuits  such  as  a  counter and  a   small-capacity  buffer.<br>
According  to  the  present  invention,   run-length compression/encoding  and  run-length  expansion/decoding of  many  types  of  pixel  data   (a  maximum  of   four  types  of pixel  data  each  having  a   2-bit  configuration)   can  be realized  with  a  relatively  simple  arrangement.<br>
FIG.   13   is  a  flow  chart   for  executing  image encoding   (run-length  compression)   according  to  an embodiment  of   the  present  invention  and  for  explaining software  executed  by  the  encoder   (200)   in  FIG.   10.<br>
A  series  of  encoding  operations  based  on  rules   1 to  6   in  FIG.   5  is  executed,   as   software  processing,   by the  microcomputer  in  encoder  200  in  FIG.   10.     The overall  encoding  processing  can  be  performed  by  encoder 200   in  accordance  with  the  flow  chart  in  FIG.   13. Run-length  compression  of   image  data  in  sub-picture data  can  be  performed  in  accordance  with  the  flow  chart in   FIG.   14.<br>
In  this  case,  when  the  number  of   lines  and  the number  of  dots  of  image  data  are  designated  by  a  key input  operation   (step  ST801),   the   computer  in   the encoder  200  prepares  a  header  area   for  sub-picture data,   and  initializes  the  line  count  to   "0" (step  ST802).<br>
When  an  image  pattern  is   sequentially  input   in units  of  bits,   the  computer  in  the  encoder   200  obtains the   first  1-pixel  data   (2  bits  in  this  case),   and stores   the  pixel  data.     In  addition,   the  computer initializes  the  pixel  count  to   "1",   and  the  dot  count to   "1"    (step  ST80 3).<br>
Subsequently,   the   computer   in  encoder   200   obtains the  next  pixel  data   (2  bits)   of   the  pixel  pattern, and  compares   it  with  the  stored  preceding  image  data (step  ST804).<br>
If  it  is  determined  from  the  comparison  result that  the  pixel  data  do  not  match  each  other   (NO  in  step ST805),   encoding   1   is   performed   (step  ST806),   and  the current  pixel  data  is   stored   (step  ST807).     The  pixel count  is  then  incremented  by  one,   and  the  dot  count  is also  incremented  by  one  accordingly   (step  ST808).<br>
If  it  is  determined  from  the  comparison  result that  the  pixel  data  match  each  other   (YES  in  step ST805),   encoding   1   in  step  ST806   is   skipped,   and  the flow  advances   to   step  ST808.<br>
After  the  pixel   count  and  the  dot  count  are incremented   (step  ST808),   the  computer  in  encoder   200 checks   whether  a   pixel   line  which   is   currently  encoded is   the  end  of   a  pixel   line   (step   80S).      If   the   pixel line  is  the  end  of   the  line   (YES  in  step  ST809), encoding  2  is  performed   (step  ST810).      If   the  pixel line  is  not  the  end  of   the  line   (NO  in  step  ST809),   the<br>
flow  returns   to  step  ST840,   and  the  processing  in  steps ST804   to  ST808   is  repeated.<br>
Upon  completion  of  encoding  2  in  step  ST810,   the computer  in  encoder  200  checks  whether  a  bit  string after  encoding  is  an  integer  multiple  of   8  bits (byte-aligned)   (step  ST811A).     If  the  bit  string  is  not byte-aligned   (NO  in  step  ST811A),   4-bit  dummy  data (0000)   is  added  to  the  end  of  the  bit  string  after encoding   (step  ST811B).     After  this  dummy  addition processing,   or  if  the  bit  string  after  encoding  is byte-aligned   (YES  in  step  ST811A),   the  line  counter  of the  computer  in  the  encoder   (e.g.,   the  general-purpose register  in  the  microcomputer)   is  incremented  by  one (step  ST812).<br>
If  the  current  line  is  not  the  final  line   (NO  in step  ST813)   after  the  line  counter  is  incremented,   the flow  returns  to  step  ST803,   and  the  processing  in  steps ST803  to  ST812  is  repeated.●<br>
If  the  current   line  is  the  final   line   (YES  in  step ST813)   after  the  line  counter  is  incremented,   the encoding  processing   (run-length  compression  of  the  bit string  of  the   2-bit  pixel  data)   is  completed.<br>
FIG.   14   is  a  flow  chart  for  explaining  the contents  of  encoding   1   in  FIG.   13.<br>
In  encoding   1   (step  ST806)   in  FIG.   13,   pixel   data to  be  encoded  is  assumed  to  have  a  2-bit  width,   and hence  run-length  compression  rules   1  to  6   in  FIG.   5  are<br>
used.<br>
In  correspondence  with  rules   1   to   6,   computer software  is  executed  to  determine  whether  the  pixel count   is  0   (step  ST901),   1  to  3   (step  ST902),   4   to  15 (step  ST903),   16  to  63   (step  ST904),   or  64   to   255   (step ST905),   or  indicates  the  end  of  a   line   (step  ST906),   or is   256   or  more   (step  ST907).<br>
The  computer  in  encoder  200  determines   the  number of   run  field  bits   (one  unit  length  of   identical  pixel data)   on  the  basis  of  the  above  determination  result (steps   ST908   to  ST913),   and  ensure  an  area corresponding  to  the  determined  number  of   run  field bits  after  sub-picture  unit  header  31.     The  number  of pixels   followed  is  output  to  the  run  field  ensured  in this  manner,   and  the  pixel  data  is  output  to  the  pixel field.     These  data  are  recorded  in  a  memory  unit   (not shown)   in  encoder  200   (step  ST914).<br>
FIG.   15   is  a  flow  chart  for  executing   image decoding   (run-length  expansion)   according  to  an embodiment  of   the  present  invention,   and  for  explaining software  executed  by  microcomputer   112   in  FIG.   11   or   12.<br>
FIG.   16   is   a   flow  chart   for  explaining   the contents  of  the  decoding  step   (step  ST1005)   used  in  the software   in   FIG.   15.<br>
Microcomputer  112   loads   first  header  31  of run-length  compressed  sub-picture  data   (pixel  data  has a   2-bit  configuration),   and  analyzes   its   contents   (see<br>
FIG.   4).     The  data  is   then  decoded  on  the  basis  of   the analyzed  contents  of  the  header.     The  number  of   lines and  the  number  of  dots  of  the  data  are  designated. When  the  number  of  lines  and  the  number  of  dots  are designated   (step  ST1001),   the  line  count  and  the  dot count  are  initialized  to   "0"   (steps  ST1002  and  ST103).<br>
Microcomputer  112   sequentially  receives   the  data bit  string  following  sub-picture  unit  header  31, and  counts  the  number  of  dots  and  the  dot  count. Microcomputer  112  then  subtracts  the  dot  count   from  the number  of  dots  to  obtain  the  number  of  pixels   followed (step  ST1004).<br>
Upon  calculating  the  number  of  pixels   followed in  this  manner,  microcomputer  112  executes  decoding in  accordance  with  the  number  of  pixels  followed (step  ST1005).<br>
After the decoding processing in step ST1005, microcomputer 112 adds the dot count to the number of pixels followed to obtain a new dot count (step ST1006).<br>
Microcomputer  112   sequentially  loads  data  and executes  the  decoding  processing  in  step  ST1005.     When the  accumulated  dot  count  coincides  with  the  initially set  line  end  count   (the  position  of  the  end  of  the line),  microcomputer  112   terminates  decoding  processing for  1-line  data   (YES  in  step  ST1007).<br>
If  the  decoded  data   is  byte-aligned   (YES   in<br>
step  ST1008A),   dummy  data   is   removed   (step  ST1008B). The   line  count  is  then  incremented  by  one   (step ST1009).   The  processing   in   steps  ST1002  to  ST1009   is repeated  until  the  final  line   (NO  in  step  ST1010). If   the  current  line  is  the  final  line   (YES  in  step ST1010),   the  decoding  processing  is  terminated.<br>
For  example,   FIG.   16  shows  the  contents  of  the decoding  processing  in  step  ST1005   in  FIG.   15.<br>
From  the  beginning  of   this  processing,   2  bits  are obtained,   and  it  is  checked  whether  the  bits  are   "0". This  determination  step  is  repeated   (steps   ST1101  to ST1109).     With  this  processing,   the  number  of  pixels followed,   i.e.,   the  number  of  continuous   runs, corresponding  to  run-length  compression  rules   1  to  6   is determined   (steps  ST1110  to  ST1113).<br>
After  the  number  of  continuous  runs   is  determined, the  subsequent   2  bits  obtained  afterward  is   used  as a  pixel  pattern   (pixel  data;   pixel  color  information) (step  ST1114) .<br>
When  the  pixel  data   (pixel  color  information)   is determined,   index  parameter   "i"   is  set  to  0   (step ST1115).     Until  parameter   "i"   coincides  with  the  number of  continuous  runs   (step  ST1116),   a   2-bit  pixel  pattern is   output   (step  ST1117),   and  parameter   "i"   is incremented  by  one   (step  ST1118).     After  identical  data corresponding  to  one  unit  is  output,   the  decoding processing  is  completed.<br>
As  described  above,   according  to  this   sub-picture decoding  method,   sub-picture  data  can  be  decoded  by simple  processing,   i.e.,   only  determination  processing for  several  bits,  data  block  separation  processing,   and data  bit  counting  processing.     For  this   reason,   a  large code  table  used  in  the  conventional  MH  coding  method  or the   like  is  not  required,   and  the  processing/arrangement for  decoding  encoded  bit  data  into  original  pixel information  can  be  simplified.<br>
In  the  above  embodiment,   the  encoded  bit  length  of identical  pixels  corresponding  to  one  unit  can  be determined  by  reading  a  maximum  of   16-bit  data  in  a decoding  operation.     However,   the  encoded  bit  length  is not  limited  to  this  value.     For  example,   the  encoded bit  length  may  be  32  or  64  bits.     However,   as  the  bit length  increases,   a  data  buffer  having  a  larger capacity  is  required.<br>
In  addition,   in  the  above  embodiment,   pixel  data (pixel  color  information)   includes  pieces  of  color information  of  three  colors  selected  from,   e.g.,   a 16-color  color  palette.     Instead  of  using  such  pixel data,   pieces  of  amplitude  information  of  the  three primary  colors   (e.g.,   red  R,   green  G,   and  blue  B;   or intensity  Y,   chroma-red  Cr,   and  chroma-blue  Cb)   can be  expressed  by  2-bit  pixel  data.     That  is,   pixel  data is  not  limited  to  specific  color  information.<br>
FIG.   17   shows   a  modification  of   the  embodiment  of<br>
FIG.   11.      In  the  embodiment  of   FIG.   11,   the  coding header  is   separated  by  microcomputer   112   in   software basis.     On  the  other  hand,   in  the  embodiment  of FIG.   17,   the  coding  header  is   separated  based  on  the hardware  in  decoder  101.<br>
More  specifically,   as   shown  in  FIG.   17,   sub-picture  data  SPD  subjected  to  the  run-length compression  is   sent,   via  data   I/O   102,   to  the   internal bus  of  decoder  101.     Sub-picture  data  SPD  on  the internal  bus   is   sent  to  memory  108  through  memory controller  105,   and  is  then  stored  in  memory  108.     The internal  bus  of  decoder  101   is   connected  to  coding  data separator  103,   to  continuous  code  length  detector  106, and  to  header  separator  113  which  is  coupled  to microcomputer   (MPU  or  CPU)   112.<br>
Sub-picture  unit  header  31  of  the  sub-picture  data read  from  memory  108   is  read  by  header  separator   113. Separator  113  detects  various  parameters   shown  in FIG.   4   from  read  header  31.     Based  on  the  detected parameters,   separator  113   sets  at  address  controller 109   the  start  address   (SPDDADR)   of  decoding;   at  display activator  110  the  information   (SPDSIZE)   of   the  display width  and  display  height  of   the   sub-picture  as  well  as the  display  start   position  of   the   sub-picture;   and  at coding  data  separator  103  the  display  width   (the  number of  dots  of  the  line).     These  set  information  pieces  are stored  in  the  internal  registers  of   corresponding<br>
circuit  blocks   (109,   110,   and   103).     Thereafter, microcomputer  112  can  access  the  parameters  stored  in the  circuit  blocks   (109,   110,   and   103).<br>
Address  controller  109   accesses  memory  108  through memory  controller  105  in  response  to  the  starting address   (SPDDADR)   of  decoding  set  at  the  register  of controller  109,   so  that  the  reading  of  the  sub-picture data  to  be  decoded  starts.     The  sub-picture  data  read from  memory  108   is  supplied   to  coding  data   separator 103  and  to  continuous  code  length  detector  106.<br>
The  coding  header   (e.g.,   2  to   14  bits  of   rules   2 to  5  in  FIG.   5)   of  run-length-compressed  sub-picture data  SPD  is  detected  by  continuous  code  length  detector 106.     The  number  of  pixels   followed  with  respect  to  the same  pixel  data  within  sub-picture  data  SPD  is  detected by  run-length  setter  107   in  accordance  with  the  signal from  continuous  code  length  detector  106.<br>
Another  decoding  method  differing  from  the decoding  method  of  FIGS.   15  and  16  will  be  explained with  reference  to  FIGS.   17   to  21.<br>
FIG.   18   is   a  flow  chart   for  explaining  the   former processing  of  the  image  decoding   (run-length  expansion) according  to  another  embodiment  of   the  present invention.<br>
When  the  decoding  starts,   respective  blocks   in decoder  101  of  FIG.   17   are  initialized   (e.g.,   registers are  cleared  and  counters  are  reset).     Thereafter,<br>
sub-picture  unit  header  31   is   read,   and  the  contents (various  parameters   shown  in  FIG.   4)   of  header  31  are set  at  internal  registers  of  header  separator  113   (step ST1200).<br>
After  the  parameters  of  header  31  are  set  at  the registers  of  header  separator  113,   microcomputer  112  is informed  of  the  end  status  of   reading  of   header   31 (step  ST1201).<br>
When  microcomputer  112   receives   the  end  status  of header  reading,   it  designates   the  start   line  of decoding   (e.g.,   SPLine   1   in  FIG.   4).     The  designated start  line  of  decoding  is   sent  to  header  separator  113 (step  ST1202).<br>
When  header  separator  113  receives  the  designated start  line  of  decoding,   separator  113   refers   to  the various  parameters   set  in  its  own  registers.     Then, according  to  the  parameters   set   in  the  registers  of separator  113,   the   following  data  set  operations  are performed   (step  ST1203):<br>
*	the  designated  decoding  start  line  address (SPDDADR  in  FIG.   4)   and  the  decoding  end  address (SPEDADR  in  FIG.   4;   the  address   obtained  by  relatively-shifting  by  one  line  from  the  start   line  address)   are set  at  address   controller   109;<br>
*	the display start position, display width, and display height of the decoded sub-picture (SPDSIZE in FIG.   4)   are  set  at  display  activator  110;   and<br>
*   the  width  of  display   (LNEPIX;   although  not shown,   LNEPIX   is   part   of   SPDSIZE   in   FIG.   4   and indicates  the  number  of  dots  on  one  line)   is   set  at coding  data  separator  103.<br>
Address  controller  109  sends  the  decoding addresses  to  memory  controller  105.     Then,   the  data  to be  decoded   (i.e.,   compressed  sub-picture  data  SPD)   is read,   via  memory  controller  105,   from  memory  108  to coding  data  separator   103  and  to  continuous   code  length detector  106.      In  this  case,   the  read  data  is   set  at respective  registers  of   separator  103  and  detector  106 in  unit  of  RbyteS   (step  ST1204).<br>
Continuous  code  length  detector  106  counts  the number  of   0-bit  of  the  data  read  from  memory  108,   and detects  the  coding  header  corresponding  to  either  of rules   1  to  5   shown  in  FIG.   5   (step  ST1205).     Details  of detection  of  the  coding  header  will  be  described  later with  reference  to  FIG.   20.<br>
Then,   continuous  code  length  detector  106  generates separation  information  SEP.INFO,   corresponding  to either  of   rules   1   to  5   shown  in  FIG.   5   (step  ST1206).<br>
More  specifically,   for  example,   when  the  count  of 0-bit  of  data  read  from  memory  108  is   zero,   separation information  SEP.INFO,   indicating  rule   1   is   obtained; when  the  count  of   0-bit  of  data  read  from  memory  108   is two,   separation  information  SEP.INFO,   indicating  rule  2 is  obtained;   when  the  count  of   0-bit  of  data  read  from<br>
memory   108   is   four,   separation  information  SEP.INFO, indicating  rule  3  is  obtained;   when  the  count  of   0-bit of   data   read   from  memory  108   is   six,   separation information  SEP.INFO,   indicating  rule  4   is  obtained; and  when  the  count  of  0-bit  of  data  read  from  memory 108   is   fourteen,   separation  information  SEP.INFO, indicating  rule  5  is  obtained.     The  separation information  SEP.INFO,   thus  obtained   is   sent  to  coding data   separator  103.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  content  of   separation information  SEP.INFO,   from  continuous  code   length detector  106,   coding  data  separator  103   sets   the  number of   pixels   followed   (PIXCNT;   run  information)   at   run length  setter  107.     Further,   coding  data  separator  103 sets  at  pixel  color  output  stage  104  the  2-bit  pixel data   (pixel   color  data  picked  up  from  the  sub-picture data  packet)   subsequent  to  the  number  of  pixels followed.     At  this  time,   current  count  value  NOWPIX of   a   pixel   counter   (not   shown)   in   separator   103   is incremented  by  number  PIXCNT  of   pixels   followed (step  ST1207).<br>
FIG.   19   is  a  flow  chart  for  explaining  the   latter processing   (subsequent  to  node  A  in  FIG.   18)   of   the image  decoding   (run-length  expansion)   according  to another  embodiment  of  the  present  invention.<br>
In  the  former  step  ST1203,   coding  data  separator 103   is   informed,   by  header  separator  113,   of  the  number<br>
LNEPIX  of  pixel  data   (the  number  of  dots)   of  one  line corresponding  to  the  display  width  of  the  sub-picture. Coding  data  separator  103  checks  whether  the  value NOWPIX  of   the  internal  pixel  counter  of  separator  103 exceeds  the  value  LNEPIX  of  the  informed  one-line  pixel data   (step  ST1208).<br>
In  step  ST1208,   when  the  pixel  count  value  NOWPIX is  equal  to  or  larger  than  the  one-line  pixel  data value  LNEPIX   (NO  at  step  ST1208),   the  internal  register of   separator  103,   to  which  one  byte  data  is  set,   is cleared,   and  the  pixel  count  value  NOWPIX  becomes   zero (step  ST1209).     At  this  time,   if  the  data  has  been byte-aligned,   the  trailing  4-bit  data  is  discarded  or neglected.     On  the  other  hand,  when  the  pixel  count value  NOWPIX  is  smaller  than  the  one-line  pixel  data value  LNEPIX   (YES  at  step  ST1208),   the  internal register  of  separator  103  is  not  cleared,   or  the  state of  the  internal  register  remains.<br>
Run  length  setter  107  responds  to  the  number PIXCNT   (run  information)  of  pixels  followed  set  at  the former  step  ST1207,   to  dot  clock  DOTCLK  determining  the rate  of   transferring  the  pixel  dots,   and  to  horizontal-and  vertical-sync  signals  H-SYNC  and  V-SYNC  for synchronizing  the   sub-picture  to  the  main  picture display.      In  response  to  these  data  or  signals,   run length  setter  107  generates  a  display  period  signal (PERIOD  SIGNAL)   which  is  provided  for  enabling  pixel<br>
color  output  stage  104  to  output  for  a  required  period of   time  the  pixel  data  set  in  stage  104.     The  generated PERIOD  SIGNAL  is   sent  to  pixel  color  output  stage   104 (step  ST1210).<br>
Pixel   color  output  stage   104  outputs,   as  display data  of  the  decoded  sub-picture,   the  separated  data (e.g.,   pixel  data  indicating  the  pixel  color)   set  at the  former  step  ST1207   for  a  period  during  which  the PERIOD  SIGNAL  is  being  sent  from  run  length  setter  107 to  output  stage   104   (step  ST1211).<br>
Thereafter,   the  sub-picture  display  data  thus obtained  can  be  properly  superimposed  to  a  main  picture by  a  specific  circuit  block   (not  shown),   and  an  image of  the  superimposed  main/sub-picture  can  be  displayed on  a  TV  monitor   (not  shown).<br>
After  the  output  processing  of  the  pixel  data  at step  ST1211  is  completed,   if  the  data  to  be  decoded remains,   the   flow  returns  to  the  former  step  ST1204   (NO at   step  ST1212).<br>
Whether  or  not  the  data  to  be  decoded  remains  can be  determined  by  checking  if  coding  data  separator  103 completes  the  data  processing  for  the  end  address (SPEDADR)   of  the  sub-picture  display  data  set  by  header separator  113.<br>
When  no  data  to  be  decoded  remains,   or  the  data processing  up  to  the  end  address  is  completed   (YES  at step  ST1212),   it  is  checked  whether  a  display  enable<br>
signal   (DISPLAY  ENABLE)   from  display  activator   110   is active  or  not.     Note  that  activator  110  generates   the active   (e.g.,   high-level)   display  enable  signal  unless activator   110   receives  a  data  end  signal   (DATA  END SIGNAL)   from  address  controller  109.<br>
Even  when  the  decoding  of  current  data  has  already been  completed,   if  the  display  enable  signal  is   still active,   it  is  determined  that  the  current  state  is   in the  display  period  of   the  sub-picture   (YES  at  step ST1213).      In  this  case,   display  activator   110   sends a  color  switch  signal  to  run-length  setter  107  and  to pixel   color  output  stage   104   (step  ST1214).<br>
At  the  time  when  the  color  switch  signal   is   sent, pixel  color  output  stage   104  already  receives insufficient  pixel  color  data  from  insufficient  pixel color  setter  111.     When  output  stage  104  receives  the color  switch  signal  from  display  activator  110,   the pixel  color  data  to  be  output  is  switched  to  the insufficient  pixel  color  data  obtained  from insufficient  pixel  color  setter  111   (step  ST1215). Then,   so  long  as  the  display  enable  signal  is  active (or  in  the   loop  of  steps  ST1213  to  ST1215)   during  the display  period  in  which  no   sub-picture  data  to  be decoded  exists,   the  display  area   for  the  sub-picture  is filled  with  the  insufficient  pixel  color  provided  by insufficient  pixel  color  setter  111.<br>
On  the  other  hand,   when  the  display  enable  signal<br>
is   inactive,   it   is  determined  that   the  display  period for  the  decoded  sub-picture  elapses   (NO  at   step ST1213).     In  this  case,   display  activator  110  supplies microcomputer  112  with  an  end  status   indicating  that the  decoding  of  the  sub-picture(s)   of  one  frame  is completed   (step  ST1216).     The  decoding  of  the  sub-picture(s)   in  one  screen  image   (or  one   frame)   is   thus completed.<br>
FIG.   20   is  a  flow  chart  for  exemplifying  the content  of  the  coding  header  detection  step  ST1205 shown  in  FIG.   18.     The  processing  of  the  coding  header detection  can  be  executed  by  continuous  code  length detector  106   shown  in  FIG.   17   (or  FIG.   11).<br>
First,   continuous  code   length  detector   106   is initialized  so  that  its  internal  status  counter (STSCNT;   not  shown)   is  set  to  zero   (step  ST1301). Then,   the  contents  of  two-bit  subsequent  to  the  data which  has  been  read  from  memory  108  to  detector  106   in unit  of  byte  are  checked.     When  the  contents  are   "00" (YES  at  step  ST1302),   counter  STSCNT  is   incremented  by 1   (step  ST1303).     If  the  checked  two-bit  does  not  reach the  end  of  one  byte   (NO  at  step  ST1304),   the  contents of  next  two-bit  are  further  checked.     When  the  contents are  still   "00"   (YES  at  step  ST1302),   counter  STSCNT  is further  incremented  by  1   (step  ST1303}.<br>
After  repeating  the  processing  of   the  loop  of steps  ST1302  to  ST1304,   if  the  checked  two-bit  reaches<br>
the  end  of  one  byte   (YES  at  step  ST1304),   it  is determined  that  the  coding  header  of  FIG.   5   is constituted  by  more  than   6  bits.     In  this   case, continuous  code  length  detector  106  reads  next  one  byte data   from  memory  108   (step  ST1305),   and  status   counter STSCNT  is   set  to  "4"   (step  ST1307).     At  this  time,   the same  one  byte  data  is  read  by  coding  data   separator  103.<br>
After  status  counter  STSCNT  is   set  to   "4",   or  the contents  of  two-bit  checked  at  the   former  step  ST1302 is  not   "00"   (NO  at  step  ST1302),   the  content  of   status counter  STSCNT  is  established,   and  the  established content  is  output  as  the  content  of  the  coding  header shown  in  FIG.   5   (step  ST1307).<br>
More  specifically,   when  the  established  content  of status   counter  STSCNT  is   "0",   the  coding  header  of  rule 1  of  FIG.   5  is  detected.     When  STSCNT  =   "1",   the  coding header  of   rule  2  is  detected.     When  STSCNT  =   "2",   the coding  header  of  rule  3   is  detected.     When  STSCNT  = "3",   the  coding  header  of  rule  4   is  detected.     When STSCNT  =   "4",   the  coding  header  of  rule  5   (the  same pixel  data  continues  up  to  the  end  of   line)   is<br>
detected.<br>
FIG. 21 is a flow chart for explaining the image decode processing according to the present invention, wherein  the  decoded   image   is   scrolled.<br>
First,   the  respective  blocks  in  decoder  101  of FIG.   11  or  FIG.   17  are  initialized,   and  line  counter<br>
LINCNT   (not   shown)   is   cleared   to   zero   (step  ST1401). Then,   microcomputer  112   (FIG.   11)   or  header  separator 113   (FIG.   17)   receives   the  header  read  end  status   sent at  step  ST1201  of  FIG.   18   (step  ST1402).<br>
The  content   (zero  at  initial)   of   line  counter LINCNT  is   sent  to  microcomputer  112   (FIG.   11)   or  header separator  113   (FIG.   17)   (step  ST1403).     Microcomputer 112  or  header  separator  113  checks  whether  the  received status   is  the  end  status   (step  ST1206  of  FIG.   18)   of one  frame  or  one  screen   (step  ST1404).<br>
If   the  received  status   is  not  the  end  status  of one   frame   (NO  at   step  ST1405),   the  processing  waits   for the  end  status.     When  the  end  status  is  received   (YES at  step  ST1405),   line  counter  LINCNT  is  incremented  by-one   (step  ST1406).<br>
When  the  content  of  incremented  counter  LINCNT does  not  reach  the  end  of   line   (NO  at  step  ST1407),   the decode  processing  of  FIGS.   15  and   16,   or  the  decode processing  of  FIGS.   18  and  19   is  restarted   (step ST1408),   and  the  processing  returns  to  step  ST1403.     To repeat  the  restart  of  decoding   (steps  ST1403  to ST1408),   the  run-length-compressed  sub-picture  can  be scrolled  while  it  is  decoded.<br>
Meanwhile,   when  the  content  of  incremented  counter LINCNT  reaches  the  end  of   line   (YES  at.   step   STI4C"   , the  decode  processing  associated  with  scrolling   zi   the sub-picture  is   finished.<br>
FIG.   22   is   a  block  diagram  for  explaining  the brief  configuration  of  an  optical  disk  record/playback apparatus   in  which  the  encoding  and  decoding  of  the present  invention  are  executed.<br>
Optical  disk  player  300  of  FIG.   22  basically  has the  same  configuration  as  a  conventional  optical  disk playback  apparatus   (such  as   a  compact  disk  player  or a   laser  disk  player).     However,   optical  disk  player  300 has  a  special   configuration  that  a  digital  signal, obtained  before  decoding  the  run-length-compressed image  information   (i.e.,   an  encoded  digital  signal), can  be  output   from  inserted  optical  disk  OD  on  which recorded  is   image  information  containing  run-length-compressed  sub-picture  data  according  to  the  present invention.     Since  the  encoded  digital  signal  is compressed,   the  transmission  bandwidth  necessary  to  the encoded  digital  signal  can  be  narrower  than  that necessary  to  non-compressed  data.<br>
The  compressed  digital  signal   from  optical  disk player  300  is  on-aired  or  is  output  to  a  communication cable,   via  modulator/transmitter  210.<br>
The  on-aired  compressed  digital  signal  or  the cable-output  compressed  digital   signal  is   received  by receiver/demodulator  400  of  a  user  or  subscriber. Receiver  400  is  provided  with  decoder   101  having  a configuration  as   shown,   for  example,   in FIG*,  11   cr FIG.   17.     Decoder  101  of  receiver  400  decodes  the<br>
compressed  digital  signal  having  been  received  and demodulated,   so  as  to  output  image  information containing  the  original  sub-picture  data  before encoded.<br>
In  the  configuration  of  FIG.   22,   when  the transmission  system  of  the  transmitter/receiver  has an  average  bit  rate  of  more  than  about  5M-bit/s,   high-quality  multi-media  video/audio  information  can  be transmitted.<br>
FIG.   23  is  a  block  diagram  for  explaining  a  case wherein  image  information  encoded  on  the  basis  of   the present  invention  is  exchanged  between  two  arbitrary computers  through  a  communication  network   (e.g.,   an internet).<br>
User  #1  having  user's  source  #1,  which  is  managed by  a  host  computer   (not  shown),   has  personal  computer 5001.     Various   input/output  devices   5011  and  various external  memory  units   5021  are  connected  to  computer 5001.     Modem  card  5031   incorporating  the  encoder  and the  decoder  of  the  present  invention  and  having  a function  required  for  communication  is  inserted  in  an internal  slot   (not  shown)   of  personal  computer  5001.<br>
Similarly,   user  #N  having  user's  source  #N  has personal  computer  500N.     Various  input/output  devices 501N  and  various   external  memory  units   502N  are connected  to  cumputer  5 0CN.     Xodem  card  503N incorporating  the  encoder  and  the  decoder  of  the<br>
present  invention  and  having  a  function  required  for communication  is  inserted  in  an  internal  slot   (not shown)   of  personal  computer  500N.<br>
Assume  that  user  #1  operates  computer  5001  to communicate  with  computer  500N  of  another  user  #N through  line  600  such  as  an  internet.     In  this  case, since  both  users   #1  and  #N  have  modem  cards   5031  and 503N  incorporating  the  encoders  and  the  decoders, compressed  image  data  can  be  efficiently  exchanged within  a  short  period  of   time.<br>
FIG.   24   shows  a  brief  configuration  of  a record/playback  apparatus   for  recording  on  optical  disk OD  the  image  information  encoded  according  to  the present  invention,   and  for  playing  back  the  recorded information  to  decode  it  according  to  the  present invention.<br>
Encoder  200  of  FIG.   24  is  so  constructed  that  it performs  the  encode  processing   (corresponding  to  the processing  of  FIGS.   13  and  14)   similar  to  the  encode processing  of  encoder  200  of  FIG.   10,   provided  that encoder  200  of  FIG.   24  executes  the  encode  processing based  on  a  software  or  hardware   (containing  a  firmware or  wired-logic  circuits).<br>
The  record  signal  containing  sub-picture  data encoded  by  encoder  200,   etc.   is  subjected  to,   for example,   a   (2,7)   RLL  modulation  at  modulator/laser driver  702.     The  modulated  record  signal  is  sent  from<br>
laser  driver  702  to  a  high-power  laser  diode  mounted  in optical  head  704.     A  particular  pattern  corresponding to  the  record  signal   is  written  in  a  magneto-optical disk  or  phase-change  optical  disk  OD  by  means  of   the recording  laser  from  optical  head  704.<br>
Thereafter,   the  information  written  in  disk  OD  is read  by  a  laser  pickup  of  optical  head  706.     The  read information  is  then  demodulated  at  demodulator/error correction  circuit  708  in  which  an  error  correction  is performed,   if  necessary.     The  demodulated  and  error-corrected  signal   is   subjected  to  various  data processing  at  data  processor  710  for  audio/video information,   so  that   information,   equivalent  to  the original  information  before  recording,   is  played  back.<br>
Data  processor  710  includes  a  decode  processing portion  corresponding  to,   for  example,  decoder  101  of FIG.   11.     This  decode  processing  portion  can  perform the  decoding   (i.e.,   expanding  of  compressed  sub-picture data)   of  FIGS.   15  and  16.<br>
FIG.   25  shows  an  example  of  an  IC  device  in  which the  encoder qf.  the  present  invention  is  integrated  with its  peripheral  circuits.<br>
FIG.   26  shows  an  example  of  an  IC  device  in  which the  decoder  of  the  present  invention  is  integrated  with its  peripheral  circuits.<br>
FIG.   27  shows  an  example  of  an  Ic  cevice  In  which the  encoder  and  decoder  of  the  present  invention  are<br>
integrated  with  their  peripheral  circuits.<br>
Thus,   the  encoder  and/or  the  decoder  according  to the  present  invention  can  be  reduced  to  practice  in  a form  of  a  semiconductor  integrated  circuit   (IC).     The present  invention  can  be  embodied  by  installing  such an  IC  in  various  apparatuses.<br>
Generally,   the  data  line  on  which  the  bit  train  of compressed  data   (PXD)  as  shown  in  FIG.   9  is  arranged includes  the  image  information  of  one  horizontal scanning   line  of  a  TV  display  screen.     However,   the data  line  may  include  the  image  information  of  two  or more  horizontal   scanning   lines  of   the  TV  display screen,   or  may  include  the  image  information  of  all horizontal  scanning  lines  of  one  TV  display  screen  (or one  frame  of  the  TV  display  screen).<br>
Incidentally,  the  target  of  data  encoding  based  on the  compression  rules  of  the  present  invention  is  not limited  to  the  sub-picture  data   (color  information  with respect  to  3  or  4  colors)   explained  in  the  present specification.     When  the  portion  of  the  pixel  data  is constituted  by  more  bit  numbers,   various  information can  be  packed  in  this  portion.     For  instance,   if  8-bit per  one  pixel  dot  is  assigned  to  the  pixel  data,   256-color  pictures  can  be  transmitted  only  by  the  sub-picture   (in  addition  to  a  main  picture).<br>
As  has  been  described  above,   according  to  the present  invention,   instead  of  performing  decoding  after<br>
reading  1-line  data,   data  is  decoded  in  a  small  unit  by making  bit  data  configurations  conform  to  a  plurality of  compression  rules  every  time  data  is  read  in  units of  bits.     For  this  reason,   according  to  the  present invention,   a  large  code  table  need  not  be  set  in  the decoder  unlike  in  the  MH  coding  method.     In  addition, the  same  data  need  not  be  read  twice  in  an  encoding operation  unlike  in  the  arithmetic  coding  method. Furthermore,   the  decoding  side  may  use  a  simple  counter for  counting  bit  data  but  requires  no  multiplier  in  a decoding  operation  unlike  in  the  arithmetic  coding method.     According  to  the  present  invention,   therefore, decoding  processing  can  be  made  relatively  simple.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
