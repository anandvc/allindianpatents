				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel culture media compositions for extraordinarily faster in vitro induction of germination and release of epicotyl dormancy in Polygonatum Cirrhifolium Royle, an endangered medicinal plant species. The Said compositions comprise Murashige and Skoog (MS), a basal culture medium, varied concentrations of plant hormones, and other additives. The present invention also relates to a method for faster in vitro propagation of Polygonatum Cirrhifolium Royle.<br>
Background Art<br>
Polygonatum Cirrhifolium Royle (Liliaceae) is an important medicinal plant of temperate<br>
Himalayas (Wealth of India Raw materials, 1976, 9, 365, CSIR, New Delhi).<br>
Its rhizomes constitute an important ingredient of Astavarga a group of eight drugs used<br>
extensively in Indian system of medicine mainly as a tonic and aphrodisiac (Misra, B. and<br>
Vaishya, R. 1972, Bhavaprakasha Nighantu, pt.l, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Santhan, Sloka<br>
120-122).<br>
These attributes are ascribed to the presence of steroidal saponins and polysaccharides in<br>
the rhizomatous root-stock of the plant. The plant is also useful in the preparation of<br>
cosmetics, skin tonic and as a vegetable (Singh, U. et al., 1983, In: Economic plants of<br>
India, IARI, new Delhi, 180).<br>
It is being over exploited from the wild habitats for its medicinal properties and this has led<br>
to its being placed among the threatened category of plants (Shah, N.C. 1983, In: An<br>
assessment of threatened plants of India, Botanical Survey of India, Calcutta, 40-49).<br>
According to seed dormancy classification of Mikolaeva (Mikolaeva, M.G. 1977, In :<br>
A. A.Khan (ed.) The physiology and biochemistry of seed dormancy and germination, 51-<br>
74. North Holand Publ. Co., Amsterdam, New York and oxford) epicotyl dormancy is one<br>
of the seven types of morpho-physiological dormancy.<br>
Morphophysiologically dormant seeds have rudimentary embryos that require cold or<br>
some combination of warm or cold stratification to complete embryo growth (Baskin, J.M.<br>
and Baskin, C.C. 1985, Amer. J. Bot., 72(2), 185-290). Under in vitro conditions these<br>
requirements can be substituted by providing inorganic and organic nutrients, plant growth<br>
regulators and appropriating the thermo and photoperiodic conditions.<br>
Immature embryos can often be induced to germinate supplying nutrients (Dure,L.S. Ill,<br>
1975 Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 26, 259-278). Stimulatory effect of GAs on germination of<br>
both dormant and non-dormant seeds has been widely reported (Lang,A. 1965, 848-893;<br>
Stokes,P. 1965, 746-803, Encydop. Plant Physiology. XV/2; Villiers, T.A. 1972, In: Seed<br>
biology (T.T.Kozlowski, ed.) Vol II, 220-281; Black, M. 1980/1981, Israil J. Bot. 29: 181-<br>
192).<br>
Since gibberellins are known to activate hydrolytic enzymes especially in dark which<br>
results in the increase in osmotic content of the seed, increasing its water potential and<br>
giving the hypocotyl power to break through the seed coat.<br>
In epicotyl dormancy gibberellins have been found to be potent substitute for the cold<br>
stratifications, resulting in the maturity of embryo.   Prior to present invention there is no<br>
particular embodiment of invention or report in which germination has been induced in P.<br>
cirrhifolium by in vitro or other means.    The germination is protracted, meagre and<br>
asynchronous and takes 3 to 5 years for plants to grow to full size when raised from seeds<br>
(Dhar &amp; Lattoo, under communication).<br>
Literature is replete with references where in vitro approaches have been successfully tried<br>
to release various forms of physiological dormancy employing various growth adjuvants<br>
especially GA3, BAP and NAA. (Chee, P.P. 1994. Hort Science, 29 (6), 695-97; Nhut,D.T.<br>
1998. Plant Cell Rep., 17(12), 913-16; Choi, Y.E. et al., 1999, Plant Cell Rep., 18(6), 493-<br>
99; Chu,P.P. 1994, Hort Science, 29(6), 695-97; Buchheim J.A.T. 1994 Plant Cell Tissue<br>
Organan Culture, 36(1), 35-43; Gingas,V.M. and Lineberger,R.B. 1989. Plant Cell Tissue<br>
Organ Culture, 17(3), 191-203, Thomas,J.A. and Meyer,M.M. 1987. In vitro 23, 3pt 2, 70<br>
A).<br>
Two of the applicants of the present invention (Dhar and Lattoo) studied the broader<br>
phenological pattern of germination in this particular species under laboratory and field<br>
conditions for three years of growth. Phenological observations indicated that the seeds of<br>
P. cirrhifolium exhibit epicotyl dormancy and have separate stratification requirements for<br>
hypocotyl, epicotyl and radicle emergence. Their's is the first report on record regarding<br>
the nature of dormancy in the referred species (under communication). They also found<br>
that epicotyl requires one, two or more startifications to release first foliage leaves.<br>

Inventors have done years of research to come out with said novel culture media compositions. The said concentration ranges of said modified MS culture medium, said hormones and said additives is extremely critical. The criticality of the said media compositions, the sequence of use of said media compositions, and the parameters determined in the said media compositions is tested with much trial and error, and then only inventors were able to achieve the desired results. Any deviation from the same would not produce desired results.<br>

The synegistic activity for the in vitro release of epicotyl dormancy in P.cirrhifolium indicated by the release of rosette of leaves and differentiation of de nova axillary buds and their sprouting of the medium is presented in the following examples which may not be construed to limit the scope of invention.<br>
Example 4: Experiment consisted of 9 treatments in the form of various combinations of BAP (1-6 mg/1) and NAA (0.1-1.0 mg/1) supplemented to MS basal culture medium containing 1.65g/l NH4NO3; 1.9g/l KNO3, O.44g/ 1 CaCl2. 2H2O, O.37g/l MgSO4. 7H20, 0.17g/l KH2PO4, 37.25 mg/1 Na2 EDTA, 27.8 mg/1 FeSO4.7H20, 0.83 mg/lKI, 6.2 mg/1 H3 BO3, 22.3 mg/1 MnSO4. 4H20, 8.6 mg/1 ZnSO4. 7H20, 0.25mg/l Na2 MoO4. 2H20, 0.025 mg/1 CuSO4. 5H2O, 0.025 mg/1 CoCl2.6H20, 100mg/l myo-inositol, 0.5 mg/1 nicotinic acid, 0.5mg/l pyridoxine HC1, 0.1 mg/1 thiamine HC1, 2mg/l glycine, 30g/l sucrose, 7.0g/l agar. Each treatment consisted of 24 cultures. These were incubated at 20°C under 16 hr photoperiod (2000 lux) at 60% RH. Synergistic combination of BAP and NAA is effective at all levels (table 1). However BAP to NAA ratio of 3:1 yields the optimum response resulting in release of first foliage leaves in 85.15% of secondary explants. 6mg/l of BAP in combination with lmg/1 of NAA gave maximum number of leaves (3.40) and leaf length (5.56 cm) respectively.<br>
Table 4: Influence of 3 levels of BAP in combination with 3 levels of NAA on the<br>
release of first foliage leaves cultured on MS medium (data from periodic observations compiled after 16 weeks of culture).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 5: In this experiment there were 5 treatments with varying levels of GA3 (1-20 mg/1) in combination with 3mg/l of BAP and 1.0 mg/1 of NAA supplemented to MS basal culture medium containing 1.65g/l NH4NO3; 1.9g/l KNO3, O.44g/1 CaCl2. 2H2O, O.37g/l MgSO4. 7H20, 0.17g/l KH2PO4, 37.25 mg/1 Na2 EDTA, 27.8 mg/1 FeSO4.7H20, 0.83 mg/lKI, 6.2 mg/1 H3 BO3, 22.3 mg/1 MnSO4. 4H20, 8.6 mg/1 ZnSO4. 7H20, 0.25mg/l Na2 MoO4. 2H20, 0.025 mg/1 CuSO4. 5H2O, 0.025 mg/1 CoCl2.6H20, 100mg/l myo-inositol, 0.5 mg/1 nicotinic acid, 0.5mg/l pyridoxine HC1, 0.1 mg/1 thiamine HC1, 2mg/l glycine, 30g/l sucrose, 7.0g/l agar. Each treatment consisted of 24 cultures. These were incubated at 20°C under 16 hr photoperiod (2000 lux) at 60% RH. Effect of various levels of GA3 in combination with BAP (3mg/l) and NAA (1.0 mg/1) on percentage of secondary explants producing axillary buds per explant and percentage of axillary buds producing leaves is described in table 5. There is a concomitant increase in the elicitation of response with the increasing concentrations of GA3.<br>
Table 5: Effect of various levels of GAs in combination with 2mg/l of BAP and l.Omg/1 of NAA on de novo axillary bud differentiation and the release of foliage leaves from them on MS medium (data from periodic observations compiled after 16 weeks of culture).
