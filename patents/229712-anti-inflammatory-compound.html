Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds and methods of using those compounds -to treat anti-inflammatory diseases<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Basic research has recently provided the life sciences community with an unprecedented volume of information on the human genetic code and the proteins that are produced by it. In 2001, the complete sequence of the human genome was reported (Lander, E.S.'et al. Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome. Nature (2001) 409:860; Venter, J.C. et al. The sequence of the human genome. Science (2001) 291:1304). Increasingly, the global research community is now classifying the 50,000+ proteins that are encoded by this genetic sequence, and more importantly, it is attempting to identify those proteins that are causative of major, under-treated human diseases.<br>
Despite the wealth of information that the human genome and its proteins are providing, particularly in the area of conformational control of protein function, the methodology and strategy by which the pharmaceutical industry sets about to develop small molecule therapeutics has not significantly advanced beyond using native protein active sites for binding to small molecule therapeutic agents. These native active sites are normally used by proteins to perform essential cellular functions by binding to and processing natural substrates or tranducing signals<br><br>
from natural ligands. Because these native pockets are used broadly by many other proteins within protein families, drugs which interact with them are often plagued by lack of selectivity and, as a consequence, insufficient therapeutic windows to achieve maximum efficacy. Side effects and toxicities are revealed in such small molecules, either during preclinical discovery, clinical trials, or later in the marketplace. Side effects and toxicities continue to be a major<br>
#<br>
reason for the high attrition rate seen within the drug development process. For the kinase protein family of proteins, interactions at these native active sites have been recently reviewed: see J. Dumas, Protein Kinase Inhibitors: Emerging Pharmacophores 1997-2001, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents (2001) 11:405-429; J. Dumas, Editor, New challenges in Protein Kinase Inhibition, in Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry (2002) 2: issue 9. -<br>
It is known that proteins are flexible', and this flexibility has been reported and utilized with the discovery of the small molecules which bind to alternative, flexible active sites with proteins. For review of this topic, see Teague, Nature Reviews/Drug Discovery, Vol. 2, pp. 527-541 (2003). See also, Wu et al, Structure, Vol. 11, pp. 399-410 (2003). However these reports focus on small molecules which bind only to proteins at the protein natural active sites.. Peng et al, Bio. Organic and Medicinal Chemistry Ltrs., Vol. 13, pp. 3693-3699 (2003), and Schindler, et al, Science, Vol. 289, p. 1938 (2000) describe inhibitors of abl kinase. These inhibitors are identified in WO Publication No. 2002/034727. This class of inhibitors binds to the ATP active site while also binding in a mode that induces movement of the kinase catalytic loop. Pargellis et al., Nature Structural Biology, .Vol. 9, p. 268 (2002) reported inhibitors p38 alpha-kinase also disclosed in WO Publication No. 00/43384 and Regan et al., /. Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 45, pp. 2994-3008 (2002). This class of inhibitors also interacts with the kinase at the ATP active site involving a concomitant movement of the kinase activation loop.<br>
More recently, it has been disclosed that kinases utilize activation loops and kinase domain regulatory pockets to control their state of catalytic activity. This has been recently reviewed (see, e.g., M. Huse and J. Kuriyan, Cell (2002) 109:275).<br>

With respect to the method of using the novel compounds, the activation state of a kinase is determined by the interaction of switch control ligands and complemental switch control pockets. One. conformation of the kinase may result from the switch control ligand's interaction with a particular switch control pocket while another conformation may result from the ligand's interaction with a different switch control pocket. Generally interaction of the ligand with one pocket, such as the "on" pocket, results in the kinase assuming anactive conformation wherein<br>
the kinase is biologically active. Similarly, an inactive conformation (wherein the kinase is not<br>
»-<br>
biologically active) is assumed when the.ligand interacts-with another of the switch control pockets, such as the "off' pocket. The switch control pocket can be selected from the group consisting of simple, composite and combined switch control pockets. Interaction between the switch control ligand and the switch control pockets is dynamic and therefore, the ligand is not always interacting with a switch control pocket. In some instances, the ligand is not in a switch control pocket (such as occurs when the protein is changing from an active conformation to an inactive conformation). In other instances, such as when the ligand is interacting with the environment surrounding the protein in order to determine with which switch control pocket to interact, the ligand is not in a switch control pocket. Interaction of the ligand with particular switch control pockets is controlled in part by the charge status of the amino acid residues of the switch control ligand. When the ligand is in a neutral charge state, it interacts with one of the switch control pockets and when it is in a charged state, it interacts with the sther of the switch control pockets. For example, the switch control ligand may have a plurality of OH groups and be in a neutral charge state. This neutral charge state results in a ligand that is more likely to<br><br>
interact with one of the switch control pockets through hydrogen boding between the OH groups and selected residues of the pocket, thereby resulting in whichever protein conformation results from that interaction. However, if the OH groups of the switch control ligand become charged through phosphorylation or some other means, the propensity of the ligand to interact with the other of the switch control pockets will increase and the ligand will interact with this other switch control pocket through complementary covalent binding between the negatively or positively charged residues of the pocket and ligand. This will result in the protein assuming the opposite conformation assumed when the ligand was in a neutral charge state and interacting with the other switch control pocket.<br>
Of course, the conformation of the protein determines the activation state of the protein and can therefore play a role in protein-related diseases, processes, and conditions. For example, if a metabolic process requires a biologically active protein but the protein's switch control ligand remains in the switch control pocket (i.e. the "off pocket) that results in a biologically inactive protein, that metabolic process cannot occur at a normal rate. Similarly, if a disease is exacerbated by a biologically active protein and the protein's switch control ligand remains in the switch control pocket (i.e. the "on" pocket) that results in the biologically active protein conformation, the disease condition will beworsened. Accordingly, as demonstrated by the present invention, selective modulation of the switch control pocket and switch control ligand by the selective administration of a molecule will play an important role in the treatment and control of protein-related diseases, processes, and conditions.<br>
One aspect of the invention provides a method of modulating the activation state of a kinase, preferably p3 8 α-kinase and including both the consensus wild type sequence and disease polymorphs thereof. The activation state is generally selected from an upregulated or downregulated state. The method generally comprises the step of contacting the kinase with a molecule having the general formula (I). When such contact occurs, the molecule will bind to a particular switch control pocket and the switch control ligand will have a greater propensity to interact with the other of the switch control pockets (i.e., the unoccupied one) and a lesser propensity to interact with the occupied switch control pocket. As a result, the protein will have a greater propensity to assume either an active or inactive conformation (and consequently be upregulated or downregulated), depending upon which of the switch control pockets is occupied by the molecule. Thus, contacting the kinase with a molecule modulates that protein's activation<br><br>
state. The molecule can act as an antagonist or an agonist of either switch control pocket The contact between the molecule and the kinase preferably occurs at a region of a switch control pocket of the kinase and more preferably in an interlobe oxyanion pocket of the kinase. IN some instances, the contact between the molecule and the pocket also results in the alteration of the conformation of other adjacent sites and pockets, such as an ATP active site. Such an alteration can also effect regulation and modulation of the active state of the protein. Preferably, the region of the switch control pocket of the kinase comprises an amino acid residue sequence operable for binding to the Formula I molecule. Such binding can occur between the molecule and a specific region of the switch control pocket with preterted regions including the a-C helix, the α-D helix, the catalytic loop, the activation loop, and the C-terminal residues or C-Iobe residues (all residues located downstream (toward the C-end) from the Activation loop), and combinations thereof. When the binding region is the a-C helix, one preterted binding sequence in this helix is the sequence IKXKRXXREXXLLXXM, (SEQ ECLNO. 2). When the binding region is the catalytic loop, one preterted binding sequence in this loop is DEHRD (SEQ ID NO. 3). When the binding region is the activation loop, one preterted binding sequence in .this loop is a sequence  selected  from   the  group'consisting  of DFGLARKTDD   (SEQ   ID   NO.4), EMTGYVATRWYR (SEQ ID NO. 5), and combinations thereof. When the binding region is in the C-lobe residues, one preterted binding sequence is WMHY (SEQ ID NO. 6). When a biologically inactive protein conformation is desired, molecules which interact with the switch control pocket that normally results in a biologically active protein conformation (when interacting with the switch control ligand) will be selected. Similarly, when a biologically active protein conformation is desired, molecules which interact with the switch control pocket that normally results in a biologically inactive protein conformation (when interacting with the switch control ligand) will be selected.   Thus, the propensity of the protein to assume a desired conformation will be modulated by administration of the molecule. In preterted forms, the molecule will be administered to an individual undergoing treatment for a condition selected from the group consisting of human inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, ostero-arthritis, asthma, gouty arthritis, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, Gram-negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, reperfiision injury, neural trauma, neural ischemia, psoriasis, restenosis, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, bone resorptive diseases, graft-versus-host reaction, Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis,<br><br>
inflammatory bowel disease, pyresis, and combinations thereof. In such forms, it will be desired to select molecules that interact with the switch control pocket That generally leads to a biologically active protein conformation so that the protein will have the propensity to assume the biologically inactive form and thereby alleviate the condition. It is contemplated that the molecules of the present invention will be administerable in any conventional form including oral, parenteral, inhalation, and subcutaneous. It is preterted for the administration to be in the oral form. Preterted molecules include the preterted compounds of formula (I), as discussed above.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating an inflammatory condition of an individual comprising the step of administering a molecule having the general, formula (I) to the individual. Such conditions are often the result of an overproduction of the biologically active form of a protein, including kinases.   The administering step generally includes the step of causing said molecule to contact a kinase involved with the inflammatory process, preferably p38 α-kinase. When the contact is between the molecule and a kinase, the contact preferably occurs in an interlobe oxyanion pocket of the kinase that includes an amino acid residue sequence operable for binding to the Formula I molecule. Preterted binding regions of the interlobe oxyanion pocket include the a-C helix region, the α-D helix region, the catalytic loop, the activation loop, the C-terminal residues, and combinations thereof. When the binding region is theα-Chelix, one preterted binding sequence in this helix is the sequence EXXKRXXREXXLLXXM, (SEQ ID NO. 2). When the binding region is the catalytic loop, one preterted binding sequence in this loop is DIIHRD (SEQ ID NO. 3). When the binding region is the activation loop, one preterted binding sequence in this loop is a sequence selected from the group consisting ofDFGLARHTDD (SEQ ID NO.4), EMTGYVATRWYR (SEQ ID NO. 5), and combinations thereof.   Such a method permits treatment of the condition by virtue of the modulation of the activation state of a kinase by contacting the kinase with a molecule that associates with the switch control pocket that normally leads to a biologically active form of the kinase when interacting with the switch control ligand. Because the Ugand cannot easily interact with the switch control pocket associated with or occupied by the molecule, the ligand tends to interact with the switch control pocket leading to the biologically inactive form of the protein, with the attendant result of a decrease in the amount of biologically active protein. Preferably, the inflammatory condition is selected from the group consisting of human inflammation,<br><br>

As with the other methods of the invention, the molecules may be administered in any conventional form, with any convention excipients or ingredients. However, it is preterted to administer the molecule in an oral dosage form. Preterted molecules are again selected from the group consisting of the preterted formula (I) compounds discussed above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREtertED EMBODIMENTS The present invention provides a way of rationally developing new small molecule modulators which interact with naturally occurring proteins (e.g.? mammalian, and especially human proteins) in order to modulate the activity of the proteins. Novel protein-small molecule adducts are also provided- The invention preferably makes use of naturally occurring proteins having a conformational property whereby the proteins change their conformations in vivo with a corresponding change in protein activity. For example, a given enzyme protein in one conformation may be biologically upregulated, while in another conformation, the same protein may be biologically downregulated. The invention preferably malces use of one mechanism of conformation change utilized by naturally occurring proteins, through the interaction of what are termed "switch control ligands" and "switch control pockets" within the protein.<br>
As used herein, "switch control ligand" means a region or domain within a naturally occurring protein and having one or more amino acid residues therein which are transiently modified in vivo between individual states by biochemical modification, typically phosphorylation, sulfation, acylation or oxidation. Similarly, "switch control pocket" means a plurality of contiguous or non-contiguous amino acid residues within a naturally occurring protein and comprising residues capable of binding in vivo with transiently modified residues of a switch control ligand in one of the individual states thereof in order to induce or restrict the conformation of the protein and thereby modulate the biological activity of the protein, and/or which is capable of binding with a non-naturally occurring switch control modulator molecule to induce or restrict a protein conformation and thereby modulate the biological activity of the protein.<br>
A protein-modulator adduct in,accordance with the inventiofi comprises a naturally occurring protein having a switch control pocket with a non-naturally occurring molecule bound to the protein at the region of said switch control pocket, said molecule serving to at least<br><br>
partially regulate the biological activity of said protein by inducing or restricting the conformation of the protein. Preferably, the protein also has a corresponding switch control ligand, the ligand interacting in vivo with the pocket to regulate the conformation and biological activity of the protein such that the protein will assume a first conformation and a first biological activity upon the ligand-pocket interaction, and will assume a second, different conformation and biological activity in the absence of the ligand-pocket interaction.<br>
The nature of the switch control ligand/switch control pocket interaction may be understood from a consideration of schematic Figs. 1-4. Specifically, in Fig. 1, a protein 100 is illustrated in schematic form to include an "on" switch control pocket 102, and "off switch control pocket 104, and a switch control ligand 106. In addition, the schematically depicted protein also includes an ATP active site 108. In the exemplary protein of Fig. 1, the ligand 106 has three amino acid residues with side chain OH groups 110. The off pocket 104 contains corresponding X residues 112 and the on pocket 102 has Z residues 114. In the exemplary instance, the protein 100 will change its conformation depending upon the charge status of the OH groups 110 on ligand 106, i.e., when the OH groups are unmodified, a neutral charge is presented, but when these groups are phosphorylated a negative charge is presented.<br>
The functionality of the pockets 102, 104 and ligand-106 can be understood from a consideration of Figs. 2-4. In Fig. 2, the ligand 106 is shown operatively interacted with the off pocket-104 such that the OH groups 110 interact with the X residues 112 forming a part of the pocket 104. Such interaction is primarily by virtue of hydrogen bonding between the OH groups 110 and the residues 112. As seen, this ligand/pocket interaction causes the protein 100 to assume a conformation different from that seen in Fig. 1 and corresponding to the off or biologically downregulated conformation of the protein.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the situation where the ligand 106 has shifted from the off pocket interaction conformation of Fig. 2 and the OH groups 110 have been phosphorylated, giving a negative charge to the ligand. In this condition, the ligand has a strong propensity to interact with on pocket 102, to thereby change the protein conformation to the on or biologically upregulated state (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a illustrates that the phosphorylated groups on the ligand 106 are attracted to positively charged residues 114 to achieve an ionic-like stabilizing bond. Note that In the on conformation of Fig. 4, the protein conformation is different than the off conformation of Fig. 2, and that the ATP active site is available and the protein is functional as a kinase enzyme.<br><br>
Figs. 1 -4 illustrate a simple situation where the protein exhibits discrete pockets 102 and 104 and ligand 106. However, in many cases a more complex switch control pocket pattern is observed. Fig. 6 illustrates a situation where an appropriate pocket for small molecule interaction is formed from amino acid residues talcen both from ligand 106 and, for example, from pocket 102. This is termed a "composite switch control pocket" made up of residues from both the ligand 106 and a pocket, and is reterted to by the numeral 120. A small molecule 122 is illustrated which interacts with the pocket 120 for protein modulation purposes.<br>
Another more complex switch pocket is depicted in Fig. 7 wherein the pocket includes residues from on pocket 102, and ATP site 108 to create what is termed a "combined switch control pocket." Such a combined pocket is reterted to as numeral 124 and may also include residues from ligand 106. An appropriate small molecule 126 is illustrated with pocket 124 for protein modulation purposes.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that while in the simple pocket situation of Figs. 1-4, the small molecule will interact with the simple pocket 102 or 104, in the more complex situations of Figs. 6 and 7 the interactive pockets are in the regions of the pockets 120 orl24. Thus, broadly the the small molecules interact "at the region" of the respective switch control pocket.<br><br>

AFFINITY AND BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF P38-ALPHA KINASE INHIBITORS A fluorescence binding assay is used to detect binding of inhibitors of Formula I with unphosphorylated p38-alpha kinase as previously described:   see J. Regan et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2002) 45:2994.<br>
1.        P38 MAP kinase binding assay<br>
The binding affinities of small molecule modulators for p38 MAP kinase were determined using a competition assay with SKF 86002 as a fluorescent probe, modified based on published methods (C. Pargellis, et al Nature Structural Biology (2002) 9, 268-272. J. Regan, et al J. Med. Chem. (2002) 45, 2994-3008). Briefly, SKF 86002, a potent inhibitor of p38 kinase (A  180 nM), displays an emission fluorescence around 420 nm when excitated at 340 nm upon its binding to the kinase. Thus, the binding affinity of an inhibitor for p38 kinase can be measured by its ability to decrease the fluorescence from SKF 86002. The assay was performed in a 384 plate (Greiner ucteaf 384 plate) on a Polarstar Optima plate . reader (BMG). Typically, the reaction mixture contained 1 JIM SKF 86002, 80 nM p38 kinase and various concentrations of an inhibitor in 20 mM Bis-Tris Propane buffer, pH 7,<br><br>
containing 0.15 % (w/v) n-octylglucoside and 2 mM EDTA in a final volume of 65 jil. The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme. The plate was incubated at room temperature ( 25 °C) for 2 hours before reading at emission of 420 nm and excitation at 340 nm..By comparison of rfu (relative fluorescence unit) values with that of a control (in the absence of an inhibitor), the percentage of inhibition at each concentration of the inhibitor was calculated. IC50 value for the inhibitor was calculated from the % inhibition values obtained at a range of concentrations of the inhibitor using Prism. When time-dependent inhibition was assessed, the plate was read at multiple reaction times such as 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours. The IC50 values were calculated at the each time point. An inhibition was assigned as time-dependent if the IC50 values decrease with the reaction time (more than twofold in four hours).<br><br><br><br>
