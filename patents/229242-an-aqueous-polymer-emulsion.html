				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to processes for preparing polymer emulsions and polymers formed therefrom. In particular, the present invention relates to aqueous emulsion polymerization processes for preparing polymer emulsions and emulsion polymers formed therefronv<br>
"Emulsion polymer", as used herein, refers to a water-insoluble polymer which is prepared by emulsion polymerization techniques.<br>
"Polymer emulsion", as used herein, refers to an aqueous composition having discrete, water-insoluble polymer particles dispersed therein.<br>
As used herein, acrylate and methacrylate are referred to as "(meth)acrylate," acrylic acid and methacrylic acid are referred to as "(meth)acrylic acid."<br>
Emulsion polymers, such as hollow or voided emulsion polymers, are<br>
known for use in several industrial applications. The literature uses the terms<br>
i"hollow" and "voided" interchangeably. These polymers are often used in paints,<br>
coatings, inks, sunscreens and paper manufacture. Hollow emulsion polymers<br>
are generally prepared by swelling a core/shell emulsion polymer in such a way<br>
that one or more voids form in the interior of the emulsion polymer particle. These voids contribute, among othjer things, to the opacity of coatings and films prepared with the hollow emulsion polymer.<br>
For some applications, it is particularly desirable to minimize the weight of the coating applied. For example, it is desirable for certain paper coatings applications to have a high performance coating without adding considerably to the weight of the paper.<br><br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide lightweight, low density additives<br>
for coatings, such as voided latex particles.<br>
Voided latex particles can be prepared by any of several known process,<br>
including those described U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,427,836, 4,468,498, 4,594,363,<br>
4,880,842, 5,494,971, 5,521,253, 5,157,084, 5,360,827 among others. Voided<br>
latex particles, as described in the references noted above, are prepared by<br>
swelling the core of a core-shell emulsion polymer. Some of the processes, such<br>
as that described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,827 describe the processes whereby, in<br>
the latter stages of polymerizing the shell, monomer is added to facilitate<br>
diffusion of base into the core of the polymer in order to achieve swelling. Then,<br>
the pH of the emulsion is adjusted with a carboxyl-group containing monomer<br>
which is subsequently polymerized. However, this process is time consuming<br>
and does not result in suitable lightweight emulsion polymers.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome the deficiencies in the previously<br>
known processes by providing low density voided emulsion polymers and a<br>
process for preparing them.<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for<br>
preparing emulsion polymer particles comprising:<br>
a) providing an aqueous emulsion of<br>
i) multi-stage emulsion polymer, comprising a core stage polymer<br>
and a shell stage polymer,<br>
wherein the core stage polymer comprises, as polymerized<br>
units, from 5 to 100 percent by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the core stage polymer, of hydrophilic monoethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer, and from 0 to 95 percent by weight,<br>
based on the weight of the core stage polymer, of at least one<br>
nonionic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer; and<br>
wherein the shell stage polymer comprises, as polymerized<br>
units, at least 50 percent by weight of nonionic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer;<br>
ii) monomer at a level of at least 0.5 percent by weight based on the<br>
weight of the multi-stage emulsion polymer; and<br>
iii) swelling agent<br>
under conditions wherein there is no substantial polymerization of the<br>
monomer; and<br>
b) reducing the level of monomer by at least fifty percent.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an aqueous<br>
polymer emulsion comprising water and swollen multi-stage emulsion polymer<br>
wherein the dry bulk density of the swollen multi-stage emulsion is: less than<br>
0.77 grams per cubic centimeter ("g/cc") when the swollen multi-stage emulsion<br>
polymer has a particle size below 275 nanometers ("nm"); less than 0.74 g/cc<br>
when the swollen multi-stage emulsion polymer has a particle size of from 275 to<br>
500 nm; less than 0.59 g/cc when the swollen multi-stage emulsion polymer has<br>
a particle size of from 501 to 750 nm; less than 0.46 g/cc when the swollen multistage<br>
emulsion polymer has a particle size of from 751 to 1300 nm.<br>
The stages of the multi-stage polymers of the present invention include<br>
core stage polymer (the "core"), and shell stage polymer (the "shell"). The core<br>
and shell may themselves be comprised of more than one stage. There may also<br>
be one or more intermediate stages. Preferably, the multi-stage polymer<br>
comprises a core, an intermediate layer and a shell.<br>
The cores of the multi-stage polymers of the present invention are<br>
emulsion polymers comprising, as polymerized units, from 5 to 100 percent by<br>
weight, based on the weight of the core, of at least one hydrophilic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer and from 0 to 95 percent by weight,<br>
based on the weight of the core stage polymer, of at least one nonionic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br>
Cores containing at least five percent by weight, based on the total weight<br>
of the core polymer, of at least one hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer will generally result in a suitable degree of swelling. There may be<br>
instances wherein, because of the hydrophobicity of certain comonomers or<br>
combinations thereof in conjunction with the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of<br>
a particular hydrophilic monomer, the copolymer may be suitably prepared with<br>
less than five percent by weight, based on the total weight of the core polymer, of<br>
a hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer. Preferably, the core<br>
comprises, as polymerized units, hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer at a level of from 5 to 100, more preferably, from 20 to 60, and most<br>
preferably, from 30 to 50 percent by weight based on the total weight of the core.<br>
The hydrophilic core polymer may be made in a single stage or step of the<br>
sequential polymerization or may be made by a plurality of steps in sequence.<br>
The multi-stage emulsion polymer of the present invention contemplates a<br>
core polymer wherein at least one hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer is polymerized alone or with at least one nonionic monoethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer. This process also contemplates, and includes in the term<br>
"hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer," the use of a<br>
nonpolymeric compound containing at least one carboxylic acid group which<br>
absorbed into the core polymer before, during or after the polymerization of the<br>
hydrophobic shell polymer as a replacement for the hydrophilic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer in the hydrophilic core polymer, as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. 4,880,842. In addition, this invention contemplates, and<br>
includes in the term "hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer," the<br>
use of a latent hydrophilic core polymer which contains no hydrophilic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer but which is swellable upon hydrolysis<br>
to a hydrophilic core polymer as described in U.S. Pat. 5,157,084.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer useful for<br>
making the core polymer include monoethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>
containing acid-functionality such as monomers containing at least one<br>
carboxylic acid group including acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acryloxypropionic<br>
acid, (meth)acryloxypropionic acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, maleic acid or<br>
anhydride, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, monomethyl maleate, monomethyl<br>
fumarate, monomethyl itaconate and the like. Acrylic acid and methacrylic acid<br>
are preferred.<br>
Suitable nonpolymeric compounds containing at least one carboxylic acid<br>
group include C6-Ci2 aliphatic or aromatic monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic<br>
acids, such as benzoic acid, m-toluic acid, p-chlorobenzoic acid, o-acetoxybenzoic<br>
acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, octanoic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, lauric<br>
acid and monobutyl phthalate and the like.<br>
Suitable nonionic monoethylenically unsaturated monomers for making<br>
the hydrophilic core polymer include styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl<br>
styrene, t-butyl styrene, vinyltoluene, ethylene, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride,<br>
vinylidene chloride, (meth)acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylamide, (Cj-C^ alkyl or (C3-<br>
C20) alkenyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid, such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate, benzyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, oleyl (meth)acrylate, palmityl<br>
(meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate and the like.<br>
The core, whether obtained by a single stage process or a process involving<br>
several stages, has an average particle size of from 50 nm to 1.0 micron,<br>
preferably from 100 nm to 300 nm, diameter in unswollen condition. If the core<br>
is obtained from a seed polymer, the seed polymer preferably has an average<br>
particle size of from 30 nm to 200 nm.<br>
The core may also optionally contain less than 20 percent by weight,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the core,<br>
of polyethylenically unsaturated monomer, wherein the amount used is<br>
generally approximately directly proportional to the amount of hydrophilic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer used; in other words, as the relative<br>
amount of hydrophilic monomer increases, it is acceptable to increase the level of<br>
polyethylenically unsaturated monomer. Alternatively, the core polymer may<br>
contain from 0.1 to 60 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the core<br>
polymer, of butadiene.<br>
Suitable polyethylenically unsaturated monomers include comonomers<br>
containing at least two addition polymerizable vinylidene groups and are alpha<br>
beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid esters of polyhydric alcohols<br>
containing 2-6 ester groups. Such comonomers include alkylene glycol<br>
diacrylates and dimethacrylates, such as for example, ethylene glycol diacrylate,<br>
ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4-butylene<br>
glycol diacrylate propylene glycol diacrylate and triethylene glycol<br>
dimethylacrylate; 1,3-glycerol dimethacrylate; 1,1,1-trimethylol propane<br>

ether, divinyl sulfone, diallyl cyanamide, ethylene glycol divinyl ether, diallyl<br>
phthalate, divinyl dimethyl silane, glycerol trivinyl ether, divinyl adipate;<br>
dicyclopentenyl (meth)acrylates; dicyclopentenyloxy (meth)acrylates;<br>
unsaturated esters of glycol monodicyclopentenyl ethers; allyl esters of a,punsaturated<br>
mono- and dicarboxylic acids having terminal ethylenic<br>
unsaturation including allyl methacrylate, allyl acrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl<br>
fumarate, diallyl itaconate and the like.<br>
The multi-stage polymer of the present invention preferably contains an<br>
intermediate stage. The intermediate stage polymer, when present, partially or<br>
fully encapsulates the core and itself is partially or fully encapsulated by the<br>
shell. The intermediate stage is prepared by conducting an emulsion<br>
polymerization in the presence of the core.<br>
The intermediate stage preferably contains, as polymerized units, from 0.3<br>
to 20, more preferably from 0.5 to 10 percent by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the core, of at least one hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br>
The intermediate stage preferably contains, as polymerized units, from 80 to<br>
99.7, more preferably from 90 to 99.5 percent by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the intermediate stage, of at least one nonionic monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer. The hydrophilic monoethylenically unsaturated monomers and the<br>
nonionic monoethylenically unsaturated monomers useful for making the core<br>
are also useful for making the intermediate layer.<br>
The shell of the multi-staged polymer of this invention is the product of<br>
emulsion polymerizing from 80 to 100, preferably from 90 to 100, percent by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the shell, of at least one nonionic<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer. The nonionic monoethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers suitable for the core are also suitable for the shell.<br>
Styrene is preferred.<br>
The shell may also contain, as polymerized units, from 0 to 20, preferably<br>
from 0 to 10, percent by weight based on the weight of the shell, of one or more<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomers containing acid-functionality for<br>
making the hydrophobic polymer shell include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid,<br>
acryloxypropionic acid, (meth)acryloxypropionic acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid,<br>
maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, monomethyl maleate,<br>
monomethyl fumarate, monomethyl itaconate and the like. Acrylic acid and<br>
methacrylic acid are preferred.<br>
The monomers used and the relative proportions thereof in the shell<br>
should be such that it is permeable to an aqueous or gaseous volatile or fixed<br>
basic swelling agent capable of swelling the core. Monomeric mixtures for<br>
making the shell preferably contain from about 0.1% by weight to about 10% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the shell polymer, of an acid-functional<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer. Preferably, the proportion of acidfunctional<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer in the shell polymer does<br>
not exceed one-third the proportion thereof in the core polymer.<br>
The presence of acid-functional monoethylenically unsaturated monomer<br>
in the shell polymer may serve several functions:<br>
(1) stabilizing of the final multi-stage emulsion polymer;<br>
(2) assuring permeability of the shell to a swelling agent; and<br>
(3) compatibilizing the shell with the previously formed stage of the<br>
multistage emulsion polymer.<br>
As used herein, the term "sequentially emulsion polymerized" or<br>
"sequentially emulsion produced" refers to polymers (including homopolymers<br>
and copolymers) which are prepared in aqueous medium by an emulsion<br>
polymerization process in the presence of the dispersed polymer particles of a<br>
previously formed emulsion polymer such that the previously formed emulsion<br>
polymers are increased in size by deposition thereon of emulsion polymerized<br>
product of one or more successive monomer charges introduced into the medium<br>
containing the dispersed particles of the preformed emulsion polymer.<br>
In the sequential emulsion polymerization with which the present<br>
invention is concerned, the term "seed" polymer is used to refer to an aqueous<br>
emulsion polymer dispersion which may be the initially-formed dispersion, that<br>
is, the product of a single stage of emulsion polymerization or it may be the<br>
emulsion polymer dispersion obtained at the end of any subsequent stage except<br>
the final stage of the sequential polymerization. Thus, a hydrophilic core<br>
polymer which is herein intended to be encapsulated by one or more subsequent<br>
stages of emulsion polymerization may itself be termed a seed polymer for the<br>
next stage.<br>
The method of this invention contemplates that the core, the intermediate<br>
stage, the shell, or any combination thereof may be made in a single stage or<br>
step of the sequential polymerization or may be made by a plurality of steps in<br>
sequence following the polymerization. The first stage of emulsion<br>
polymerization in the process of the present invention may be the preparation of<br>
a seed polymer containing small dispersed polymer particles insoluble in the<br>
aqueous emulsion polymerization medium. This seed polymer may or may not<br>
contain any hydrophilic monomer component but provides particles of minute<br>
size which form the nuclei on which the hydrophilic core polymer, with or<br>
without nonionic comonomer, is formed.<br>
A water-soluble free radical initiator is utilized in the aqueous emulsion<br>
polymerization. Suitable water-soluble free radical initiators include hydrogen<br>
peroxide; tert-butyl peroxide; alkali metal persulfates such as sodium, potassium<br>
and lithium persulfate; ammonium persulfate; and mixtures of such initiators<br>
with a reducing agent. Reducing agents include: sulfites, such as alkali metal<br>
metabisulfite, hydrosulfite, and hyposulfite; sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate;<br>
and reducing sugars such as ascorbic acid and isoascorbic acid. The amount of<br>
initiator is preferably from 0.01 to Spercent by weight, based on the total amount<br>
of monomer and in a redox system the amount of reducing agent is preferably<br>
from 0.01 to 3 percent by weight based on the total amount of monomer. The<br>
temperature may be in the range of about 10°C to 100°C. In the case of the<br>
persulfate systems, the temperature is preferably in the range of 60°C to 90°C.<br>
In the redox system, the temperature is preferably in the range of 30°C to 70°C,<br>
preferably below about 60°C, more preferably in the range of 30°C to 45°C. The<br>
type and amount of initiator may be the same or different in the various stages<br>
of the multi-stage polymerization.<br>
One or more nonionic or anionic emulsifiers, or surfactants, may be used,<br>
either alone or together. Examples of suitable nonionic emulsifiers include tertoctylphenoxyethylpoly(<br>
39)-ethoxyethanol, dodecyloxypoly(10)ethoxyethanol,<br>
nonylphenoxyethyl-poly(40)ethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol 2000 monooleate,<br>
10<br>
ethoxylated castor oil, fluorinated alkyl esters and alkoxylates, polyoxyethylene<br>
(20) sorbitan monolaurate, sucrose monococoate, di(2-<br>
butyl)phenoxypoly(20)ethoxyethanol, hydroxyethylcellulosepolybutyl acrylate<br>
graft copolymer, dimethyl silicone polyalkylene oxide graft copolymer,<br>
poly(ethylene oxide)poly(butyl acrylate) block copolymer, block copolymers of<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol<br>
ethoxylated with 30 moles of ethylene oxide, N-polyoxyethylene(20)lauramide,<br>
N-lauryl-N-polyoxyethylene(3)amine and poly(10)ethylene glycol dodecyl<br>
thioether. Examples of suitable anionic emulsifiers include sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, potassium stearate, sodium dioctyl<br>
sulfosuccinate, sodium dodecyldiphenyloxide disulfonate,<br>
nonylphenoxyethylpoly(l)ethoxyethyl sulfate ammonium salt, sodium styrene<br>
sulfonate, sodium dodecyl allyl sulfosuccinate, Unseed oil fatty acid, sodium or<br>
ammonium salts of phosphate esters of ethoxylated nonylphenol, sodium<br>
octoxynol-3-sulfonate, sodium cocoyl sarcocinate, sodium l-alkoxy-2-<br>
hydroxypropyl sulfonate, sodium alpha-olefin (Ci4-Ci6)sulfonate, sulfates of<br>
hydroxyalkanols, tetrasodium N-(l,2-dicarboxy ethyl)-Noctadecylsulfosuccinamate,<br>
disodium N-octadecylsulfosuccinamate, disodium<br>
alkylamido polyethoxy sulfosuccinate, disodium ethoxylated nonylphenol half<br>
ester of sulfosuccinic acid and the sodium salt of tertoctylphenoxyethoxypoly(<br>
39)ethoxyethyl sulfate. The one or more surfactants are<br>
generally used at a level of from 0 to 3 percent based on the weight of the multistage<br>
polymer. The one or more surfactants can be added prior to the addition of<br>
any monomer charge, during the addition of a monomer charge or a combination<br>
thereof. In certain monomer/emulsifier systems for forming the shell, the<br>
tendency to produce gum or coagulum in the reaction medium may be reduced or<br>
prevented by the addition of about 0.05% to about 2.0% by weight, based on total<br>
weight of the shell polymer, of emulsifier without detriment to the deposition of<br>
the polymer formed on the previously formed core particles.<br>
The amount of emulsifier may be zero, in the situation wherein a<br>
persulfate initiator is used, to 3 percent by weight, based on the weight of total<br>
weight of the core polymer. By carrying out the emulsion polymerization while<br>
maintaining low levels of emulsifier, the subsequent stages of polymer-formation<br>
deposit the most-recently formed polymer on the existing dispersed polymer<br>
particles resulting from the preceding step or stage. As a general rule, the<br>
amount of emulsifier should be kept below that corresponding to the critical<br>
micelle concentration for a particular monomer system, but while this limitation<br>
is preferable and produces a unimodal product, it has been found that in some<br>
systems the critical micelle concentration of the emulsifier may be exceeded<br>
somewhat without the formation of an objectionable or excessive number of<br>
dispersed micelles or particles. It is for the purpose of controlling the number of<br>
micelles during the various stages of polymerization so that the deposition of the<br>
subsequently formed polymer in each stage occurs upon the dispersed micelles or<br>
particles formed in the previous stages, that the concentration of emulsifier is<br>
kept low.<br>
The viscosity- average molecular weight of the polymer formed in a given<br>
stage may range from 100,000, or lower if a chain transfer agent is used, to<br>
several million molecular weight. When 0.1% by weight to 20% by weight, based<br>
on the weight of the monomer, of a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer<br>
mentioned hereinbefore is used in making the core, the molecular weight is<br>
increased whether or not crosslinking occurs. The use of the polyethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer reduces the tendency of the core polymer to dissolve when<br>
the multistaged polymer is treated with a swellant for the core. If it is desired to<br>
produce a core having a molecular weight in the lower part of the range, such as<br>
from 500,000 down to as low as about 20,000, it is frequently most practical to do<br>
so by avoiding the polyethylenically unsaturated monomers and using a chain<br>
transfer agent instead, such as 0.05% to 2% or more thereof, examples being<br>
alkyl mercaptans, such as sec-butyl mercaptan.<br>
The weight ratio of core to the intermediate stage, if present, is generally<br>
in the range of from 1:0.5 to 1:10, preferably in the range of from 1:1 to 1:7. The<br>
weight ratio of core to shell is generally in the range of from 1:5 to 1:20,<br>
12<br>
preferably in the range of from 1:8 to 1:15. When trying to decrease the dry<br>
density of the final product, is preferred to have as little shell as possible while<br>
still encapsulating the core.<br>
The amount of polymer deposited to form shell polymer is generally such<br>
as to provide an overall size of the multistage polymer particle of from 70 nm to<br>
4.5 microns, preferably from 100 nm to 3.5 microns, more preferably from 200<br>
nm to 2.0 microns, in unswollen condition (that is, before any neutralization to<br>
raise the pH to about 6 or higher) whether the shell polymer is formed in a single<br>
stage or in a plurality of stages. In order to minimize the dry density of the final<br>
product, it is preferable to deposit only as much shell polymer as is needed to<br>
fully encapsulate the core. When the hydrophilic core polymer is fully<br>
encapsulated, it does not titrate with alkali metal bases under normal analytical<br>
conditions of about 1 hour and at room temperature. The extent of encapsulation<br>
can be determined by removing samples during the course of the shell<br>
polymerization and titrating with sodium hydroxide.<br>
The multi-stage emulsion polymer is prepared by sequential emulsion<br>
polymerization, which, as discussed above, includes charging the monomers<br>
which form the shell. At, or near, the conclusion of charging the monomers<br>
which form the shell, the contents of the reactor include the multistage polymer,<br>
water and unreacted monomer. Under the conditions of an emulsion<br>
polymerization, there is also an appreciable free-radical content, or radical flux,<br>
which keeps the polymerization process going. Even if no additional monomer or<br>
initiator is added, there is an appreciable free-radical content in the system.<br>
When there is no appreciable free-radical content, in other words, when the<br>
radical flux is very low or approaches zero, then no substantial amount of<br>
polymerization will occur.<br>
We have discovered that this free-radical content interferes with the<br>
extent of swelling which can be achieved. Previously known processes typically<br>
achieve swelling by adding a suitable swelling agent in the latter stages of<br>
charging the monomers which form the shell or at the completion of charging the<br>
monomers which form the shell. It is believed that the presence of unreacted<br>
monomer facilitates the transport of the swelling agent to the core. However, in<br>
previously known processes, the swelling agent was added to the system while<br>
there was still an appreciable free-radical content in the system. Thus, under<br>
those conditions, a substantial amount of polymerization was still occurring.<br>
We have discovered that by providing an aqueous emulsion of the multistage<br>
emulsion polymer, monomer and swelling agent under conditions wherein<br>
there is no substantial polymerization of the monomer, we can enhance the<br>
extent of swelling of the multistage emulsion polymer.<br>
There are many means for providing that no substantial polymerization of<br>
monomer is occurring, including the addition of one or more polymerization<br>
inhibitors, the addition of one or more reducing agents, waiting for a sufficient<br>
period of time until there are no longer an appreciable number of free-radicals by<br>
virtue of them terminating, cooling the contents of the reactor to limit the<br>
reactivity of the free-radicals, and combinations thereof. A preferred means<br>
involves the addition of one or more polymerization inhibitors such as, for<br>
example, N, N-diethylhydroxylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 2,4-<br>
dinitrophenylhydrazine, p-phenylenediamine, phenathiazine, alloocimene,<br>
triethyl phosphite, 4-nitrosophenol, 2-nitrophenol, p-aminophenol, 4-hydroxy-<br>
TEMPO (also known as 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6, tetramethylpiperidinyloxy, free<br>
radical), hydroquinone, p-methoxyhydroquinone, tert-butyl-p-hydroquinone, 2,5-<br>
di-tert-butyl-p-hydroquinone, 1,4-naphthalenediol, 4-tert butyl catechol, copper<br>
sulfate, copper nitrate, cresol and phenol. When used, the polymerization<br>
inhibitors or reducing agents are added in effective amount to substantially stop<br>
any polymerization, generally from 25 to 5, 000 parts per million ("ppm"),<br>
preferably from 50 to 3,500 ppm based on polymer solids. Preferably, the<br>
polymerization inhibitor(s) or reducing agent(s) are added while the multistage<br>
polymer is at or below the temperature at which the shell was polymerized, most<br>
preferably within ten degrees Celsius below the temperature at which the shell<br>
was polymerized.<br>
Monomer which is present at, or after providing that no substantial<br>
polymerization of monomer is occurring can be (i) one or more of the monomers<br>
used to prepare any of the stages of the multistage polymer, (ii) one or more<br>
monomers other than those use to prepare any of the stages of the multistage<br>
polymer, or (iii) combinations thereof. Preferably, monomer present at such time<br>
is one or more of the monomers used to prepare the shell. Such monomer may be<br>
unreacted monomer from preparing the multi-stage emulsion polymer, it may be<br>
separately added, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the monomer is nonionic<br>
monomer. Nonionic monomer is preferred because acid-functional monomers<br>
will be neutralized by the swelling agent, and these neutralized monomers are<br>
difficult to remove by polymerization. Preferably the level of monomer present<br>
at, or after providing that no substantial polymerization of monomer is occurring<br>
is from 1 to 20 times as much as the standing monomer level during<br>
polymerization.<br>
It is also necessary to use one or more swelling agents. Suitable swelling<br>
agents include, are those which, in the presence of the multistage emulsion<br>
polymer and monomer, are capable of permeating the shell and swelling the core.<br>
Swelling agents may be aqueous or gaseous, volatile or fixed bases or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable swelling agents include volatile bases such as ammonia,<br>
ammonium hydroxide, and volatile lower aliphatic amines, such as morpholine,<br>
trimethylamine, and triethylamine, and the like; fixed or permanent bases such<br>
as potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, zinc ammonium complex, copper<br>
ammonium complex, silver ammonium complex, strontium hydroxide, barium<br>
hydroxide and the like. Solvents, such as, for example, ethanol, hexanol, octanol,<br>
Texanol® solvent and those described in U.S. Patent 4,594,363, may be added to<br>
aid in fixed or permanent base penetration. Ammonia and ammonium hydroxide<br>
are preferred.<br>
When trying to maximize the extent of swelling, it is preferable that the<br>
one or more swelling agents are added after providing that no substantial<br>
polymerization of monomer is occurring. The amount of swelling agent can be<br>
less than, equal to or greater than the amount needed to provide for complete<br>
neutralization of the core. Preferably, the amount of swelling agent is in the<br>
range of from 75 to 300 percent, more preferably in the range of from 90 to 250<br>
percent based on the equivalents of the functionality in the core capable of being<br>
neutralized. It is also preferable to add the one or more swelling agents to the<br>
multistage emulsion polymer while the multistage emulsion polymer is at an<br>
elevated temperature, preferably at a temperature within 10°C of the shell<br>
polymerization temperature. Swelling is generally very efficient under<br>
conditions of elevated temperature, in the presence of monomer and no<br>
substantial polymerization occurring. Under these conditions, swelling is<br>
generally complete within 30 minutes, preferably within 20 minutes, most<br>
preferably within 10 minutes of adding the one or more swelling agents.<br>
The core polymer of the multistage emulsion polymer swells when the core<br>
is subjected to a basic swelling agent that permeates the shell to at least<br>
partially neutralize the hydrophilic-functionality of the core, preferably to a pH<br>
of at least about 6 to at least about 10, and thereby result in swelling by<br>
hydration of the hydrophilic core polymer. The swelling, or expansion, of the<br>
core may involve partial merging of the outer periphery of the core into the pores<br>
of the inner periphery of the shell and also partial enlargement or bulging of the<br>
shell and the entire particle overall.<br>
When the swollen multistage emulsion polymer is dried, water and/or<br>
swelling agent are removed from the central region of the swollen multistage<br>
emulsion polymer, the core tends to shrink and a void develops, the extent of<br>
which depends upon the resistance of the shell to restoration to its previous size.<br>
This resistance of the shell restoring itself to its previous size is critical for<br>
minimizing the dry bulk density of the swollen multistage emulsion polymer.<br>
The expansion of the core results in expansion of the shell also. As the size of<br>
the shell is restored to its previous size, the dry bulk density increases. It is<br>
desirable, therefore, to minimize the extent to which the size of the shell is<br>
restored, thereby maximizing the dry bulk density of the swollen multistage<br>
emulsion polymer.<br>
This can be accomplished by reducing the monomer level. It is believed<br>
that the presence of monomer is helpful in facilitating the swelling of the<br>
multistage polymer, whether by plasticizing the shell, aiding in the transport<br>
through the shell or a combination thereof. However, the presence of monomer<br>
is detrimental when trying to maximize swelling and minimize the dry bulk<br>
density of the swollen multistage emulsion polymer. Accordingly, after swelling<br>
the multistage emulsion polymer in the presence of both monomer and swelling<br>
agent, it is desirable to reduce the level of monomer to less than 10,000 ppm,<br>
preferably to less than 5,000 ppm based on polymer solids. This can be<br>
accomplished by any suitable means. Preferably, the level of monomer is<br>
reduced by polymerizing the monomer. This can be accomplished by any<br>
suitable means, such as by adding one or more initiators such as those recited<br>
above. It is preferred to begin to reduce the level of monomer within 20 minutes,<br>
more preferably within 10 minutes, of adding the one or more swelling agents.<br>
The process of the present invention is capable of producing swollen multistage<br>
emulsion polymers having very low bulk density. Swollen emulsion multistage<br>
polymers having an a particle size below 275 nm can be prepared with a<br>
dry bulk density of from 0.30 to 0.77 g/cc, preferably from 0.35 to 0.76 g/cc, most<br>
preferably from 0.40 to 0.75 g/cc. Swollen emulsion multi-stage polymers having<br>
an a particle size in the range of from 275 to 500 nm can be prepared with a dry<br>
bulk density of from 0.30 to 0.74 g/cc, preferably from 0.35 to 0.73 g/cc, most<br>
preferably from 0.40 to 0.72 g/cc. Swollen emulsion multi-stage polymers having<br>
an a particle size in the range of from 501 to 750 nm can be prepared with a dry<br>
bulk density of from 0.30 to 0.59 g/cc, preferably from 0.35 to 0.58 g/cc, most<br>
preferably from 0.40 to 0.57 g/cc. Swollen emulsion multi-stage polymers having<br>
an a particle size in the range of from 751 to 1,300 nm can be prepared with a<br>
dry bulk density of from 0.30 to 0.46 g/cc, preferably from 0.35 to 0.45 g/cc, most<br>
preferably from 0.40 to 0.44 g/cc.<br>
When the swollen multistage emulsion polymers are at least partially<br>
dried to produce voided polymer particles, these voided polymer particles impart<br>
favorable properties, such as gloss, brightness and opacity to paper coating<br>
formulations to which they are added.<br>
The voided latex particles produced by the method of the present<br>
invention are useful in coating compositions, such as aqueous-based paint and<br>
paper coatings. The voided polymer particles produced by the method of this<br>
invention impart improved gloss, brightness and opacity to paper coating<br>
formulations to which they are added. Also, the voided polymer particles<br>
produced by the method of this invention impart opacity to aqueous coating<br>
compositions, such as paints, to which they are added.<br>

The dry bulk density, as used herein, and in the appended claims, was<br>
determined according to the following procedure. To a 50 milliliter ("ml")<br>
centrifuge tube was added 6.3 grams of polymer solids. Deionized water was<br>
added to the centrifuge tube to provide a total of 35 grams ("g") of material in the<br>
centrifuge tube which corresponds to 18 percent by weight of polymer solids. The<br>
tube was placed in a centrifuge spun at 18,000 revolutions per minute for 120<br>
minutes. The supernatant was decanted and weighed. The dry density was then<br>
determined by the following equations:<br>
Dry Density = %POLY x d<br>
% POLY = 1 - %H20<br>
%H20 = VH20 = (VT - S H20) x FR -VP<br>
V H20 + VP (VT - S H20) x FR<br>
VH20 = (VT -SH20) x FR - VP<br>
VP + V H20 = ( VT - SH20) x FR<br>
FR = Vp + V H20 = VP + V H20<br>
V p + V mo + IH20 Hard Pack<br>
Hard Pack = Vr-Smo = VP + V nzo<br>
FR<br>
where:<br>
WT = total weight in tube = 35.0 grams<br>
V mo = Volume of water inside the particles<br>
I H2O = Interstitial water volume<br>
d = polymer density = measured 1.084 g/cc<br>
V p = Polymer volume (6.3 g / 1.084 g/cc = 5.81 cc)<br>
VT = total volume in tube = 35 g - 6.3 g solids = 28.7g or cc water + 5.81 cc polymer =<br>
34.51 cc<br>
S mo = volume of supernate = weight of supernate<br>
%H2O = Percent water inside particles<br>
% POLY = Percent polymer in particles<br>
FR = Packing constant, which is a correction corresponding to the fraction of volume<br>
solids in the hard pack. The following packing constant values were used based on<br>
the particle size of the polymer sample:<br>
Particle Size Range (run) FR<br>
275 - 500 0.624<br>
501 - 750 0.638<br>
751 - 1300 0.645<br>
The values of the packing constants used were based on density<br>
determinations (as described above) for unswollen polymer particles such that V HZO<br>
is zero. The packing constant, FR is defined as:<br>
28<br>
FR = VP + V H20 = VP + V H20 = Vp<br>
V P + V H20 + I mo Hard Pack Hard Pack<br>
V p = Polymer volume (6.3 g / 1.084 g/cc = 5.81 cc)<br>
I HZO = Interstitial water volume = (Wt - Smo - 6.3 g) / 1.0 g/cc<br>
WT = total weight in tube = 35.0 grams<br>
S mo = weight of supernate<br>
Using the above expression the packing constants were determined for several<br>
polymer samples having average particle sizes in the range of from about 200 nm to<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
All particle sizes reported herein were measured using a Brookhaven BI-90<br>
Particle Sizer and are reported as an average particle size.<br>
