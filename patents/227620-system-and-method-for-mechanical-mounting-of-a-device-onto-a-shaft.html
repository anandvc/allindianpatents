This application claims priority to, and incorporates by reference herein in its<br>
entirely, pending United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No.<br>
60/490,863 (Attorney Docket No. 2003P09184US), filed 28 July 2003.<br>
Background<br>
A device, such as a fan, that is secured onto a shaft of a machine, such as a<br>
motor, must be secured in a manner that prevents axial or radial movement of<br>
the device. As shown in Fig. 1, certain conventional systems and methods for<br>
securing devices, such as a fan, onto a motor shaft, require setscrews and<br>
keyways. A keyway is machined directly onto the fan and is also machined onto<br>
the shaft. The fan is drilled and tapped to receive a setscrew. The fan is<br>
mounted onto the shaft and secured radially by a common key. The key is<br>
secured by a setscrew that traverses the keyway provided by the fan. This<br>
setscrew axially retains the fan. It can be appreciated that disadvantages caused<br>
by this conventional system and method for mounting a device to a motor shaft<br>
are that keyways and setscrews increase stress concentration, thereby effectively<br>
increasing the stress that the fan's structure is subjected to during operation.<br>
Excessive stress tends to result in decreased reliability, thereby increasing overall<br>
operating costs of the motor.<br>
It can be appreciated that conventional systems have attempted, but have failed<br>
to remedy the problem that a device such as a fan, which is secured to a motor,<br><br>
receives excessive and destructive stress during its operation. For example,<br>
certain conventional systems and methods apply less interference in the fit-up<br>
between a fan and a shaft; however this requires tighter machining tolerances.<br>
Other conventional systems include stronger material for mechanically mounting<br>
a fan. However, it will be appreciated that these conventional methods and<br>
systems are particularly costly and inefficient.<br>
DE 7242559 teaches us a shaft (6), a device (2a) and a mount (7) secured to the<br>
device, the shaft including an axial groove (10) and a radial groove (8), the<br>
mount being inserted into the grooves to prevent the movement of the device.<br>
The mount made of a single component includes two wedges and a medium<br>
positioned between the wedges. The wedges form a contact edge having a<br>
concave shape corresponding to the concave shape of the radial groove and<br>
there by making a fix secure fir between the mount and radial groove to prevent<br>
the shaft axial and radial movement. Corresponding method is also described.<br>
This document shows a connection element made of a wire formed into a snap<br>
ring or circlip 7a and a key part 7b parallel to the axis, which rests in a shaft<br>
keyway 10.<br>
A spacing apparatus for use in mounting an engine cooling fan of a racing<br>
vehicle to a drive structure, typically the water pump drive shaft, is made from a<br>
spacer body to which a fan hub quick-releasably attaches. The spacer body has a<br>
base with a shaft extending therefrom having a reduced perimeter section over<br><br>
which the fan hub mounts. When the fan hub is in place, engagement rods may<br>
be inserted in the fan hub to retain the fan hub on the shaft. The engagement<br>
rods may be easily and quickly removed without risk of burn to the mechanic to<br>
allow quick release of the fan hub on which the fan blades are mounted.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a need for an efficient, effective system and method for<br>
mechanically mounting a device, such as a fan, to a motor without subjecting<br>
the device to increase/stress during its operation.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention axially and radially secures a device, such as a fart, to a<br>
shaft of a motor without a need for setscrews or keyways. Elimination of a<br>
keyway and setscrew for securing a fan to a motor shaft minimizes stress that<br>
the fan is subjected to during its operation.<br>
It will be appreciated that this system and method allows for more efficient use<br>
of materials used to fabricate and machine the fan. It will further be<br>
appreciated that the present invention allows for machining the mechanical<br>
mount of a fan to a motor shaft with looser tolerances and use of less costly<br>
material. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present<br>
invention lowers fan stress, reduces fabrication cost of the fan with the use of<br>
less costly material, allows for greater interference (looser machining<br>
tolerances), decreases maintenance costs and provides for increased fan life.<br>
