				<td>NEW PYRIDAZIN-3(2H)-ONES<br>
This invention relates to new pyridazin-3(2H)-ones and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. These compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) and are thus useful in the treatment, prevention or suppression of pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be susceptible of being improved by inhibition of PDE4.<br>
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis and inactivation of the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Eleven different PDE families have been identified to date (PDE1 to PDE11) which differ in substrate preference, catalytic activity, sensitivity to endogenous activators and inhibitors, and encoding genes.<br>
The PDE4 isoenzyme family exhibits a high affinity for cyclic AMP but has weak affinity for cyclic GMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels caused by PDE4 inhibition are associated with the suppression of cell activation in a wide range of inflammatory and immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Moreover, PDE4 inhibition decreases the release of the cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor a (TNFa). The biology of PDE4 is described in several recent reviews, for example M. D. Houslay, Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001, 69, 249-315; J. E. Souness et al. Immunopharmacol. 2000 47, 127-162; or M. Conti and S. L. Jin, Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999, 63, 1-38.<br>
In view of these physiological effects, PDE4 inhibitors of varied chemical structures have been recentlty disclosed for the treatment or prevention of chronic and acute inflammatory diseases and of other pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be sceptible to amelioration by inhibition of PDE4. See, for example, US 5449686, US 10170, WO 98/45268, WO 99/06404, WO 01/57025, WO 01/57036, WO 01/46184, WO 5105, WO 96/40636, US 5786354, US 5773467, US 5753666, US 5728712, US 159, US 5679696, US 5596013, US 5541219, US 5508300, US 5502072 or H. J. nd J. G. Montana, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 1999, 8, 1301-1325.<br><br><br>
We have now found that a novel series of pyridazin-3(2H)-one analogues are potent and selective inhibitors of PDE4 and are therefore useful in the treatment or prevention of these pathological conditions, diseases and disorders, in particular asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or irritable bowel disease.<br>

PDE4 Assay Procedure<br>
Compounds to be tested were resuspended in DMSO at a stock concentration of 1 mM. The compounds were tested at different concentrations varying from 10 µM to 10 pM to calculate an IC50. These dilutions were done in 96-well plates. In some cases, plates containing diluted compounds were frozen before being assayed. In these cases, the plates were thawed at room temperature and stirred for 15 minutes.<br>
Ten microliters of the diluted compounds were poured into a "low binding" assay plate. Eighty microliters of reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 8.3 mM MgCI2, 1.7 mM EGTA, and 15 nM [3H]-cAMP were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by<br><br>
adding ten microliters of a solution containing PDE4. The plate was then incubated under stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. After incubation the reaction was stopped with 50 microlitres of SPA beads, and the reaction was allowed to incubate for another 20 minutes at room temperature before measuring radioactivity using standard instrumentation.<br>
The reaction mixture was prepared by adding 90 ml of H20 to 10 ml of 10X assay buffer (500 mM Tris pH 7.5, 83 mM MgCI2, 17 mM EGTA), and 40 microlitres 1 µCi/µL [3H]-cAMP. SPA beads solution was prepared by adding 500 mg to 28 ml H20 for a final concentration of 20 mg/ml beads and 18 mM zinc sulphate.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

Preferred pyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives of the invention possess an IC50 value for the inhibition of PDE4 (determined as defined above) of less than 100 nM, preferably less than 50 nM and most preferably less than 20 nM. The compounds are also capable of blocking the production of some pro-inflammatory cytokines such as, for example, TNFa.<br>
Thus, they can be used in the treatment of allergic, inflammatory and immunological diseases, as well as those diseases or conditions where the selective inhibition of PDE4 and the blockade of pro-inflammatory cytokines is known to be of benefit. These disease states include (see, for example, US 5449686, US 5710170, WO 98/45268, WO 99/06404, WO 01/57025, WO 01/57036, WO 01/46184, WO 97/05105, WO 96/40636, US 5786354, US 5773467, US 5753666, US 5728712, US 5693659, US 5679696, US 5596013, US 5541219, US 5508300, US 5502072 or H. J. Dyke and J. G. Montana, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 1999, 8, 1301-1325) asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, bone-formation disorders, glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, Graves ophtalmopathy, myasthenia gravis, diabetes insipidus, graft rejection, gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, septic shock, adult distress respiratory syndrome, and skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, acute dermatomyositis and psoriasis. They can also be used as improvers of cerebrovascular function as well as in the treatment of other CNS related diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and as nootropic agents.<br>
The PDE4 inhibitors of the invention are also of benefit when administered in combination with other drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin A, rapamycin or T-cell receptor blockers. In this case the administration of the compounds allows a reduction of the dosage of the other drugs, thus preventing the appearance of the undesired side effects associated with both steroids and immunosuppressants.<br>
Like other PDE4 inhibitors (see references above) the compounds of the invention can also be used for blocking the ulcerogenic effects induced by a variety of etiological agents, such as antiinflammatory drugs (steroidal or non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents), stress, ammonia, ethanol and concentrated acids. They can be used alone or in combination with antacids and/or antisecretory drugs in the preventive and/or curative treatment of gastrointestinal pathologies like drug-induced ulcers, peptic ulcers, H. Pylori-related ulcers, esophagitis and gastro-esophageal reflux disease.<br>
They can also be used in the treatment of pathological situations where damage to the cells or tissues is produced through conditions like anoxia or the production of an excess of free radicals. Examples of such beneficial effects are the protection of cardiac tissue after coronary artery occlusion or the prolongation of cell and tissue viability when the compounds of the invention are added to preserving solutions intended for storage of transplant organs or fluids such as blood or sperm. They are also of benefit on tissue repair and wound healing.<br>
Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention is a process for the preparation of a medicament, characterised in that one or more pyridazin-3(2/-/)-one derivatives of formula (I) are formulated as a medicament, wherein the medicament is for use in the treatment of pathological conditions or diseases susceptible to amelioration by inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Also described is a method for treating a subject afflicted with a pathological condition or disease susceptible to amelioration by inhibition of PDE4, which comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise, as an active ingredient, at least a pyridazin-3(2H)-one derivative of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient such as a carrier or diluent. The active ingredient may comprise 0.001% to 99% by weight, preferably 0.01% to 90% by weight, of the composition<br><br>
depending upon the nature of the formulation and whether further dilution is to be made prior to application. Preferably the compositions are made up in a form suitable for oral, topical, nasal, rectal, percutaneous or injectable administration.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are admixed with the active compound, or salts of such compound, to form the compositions of this invention are well-known per se and the actual excipients used depend inter alia on the intended method of administering the compositions.<br>
Compositions for oral administration may take the form of tablets, retard tablets, sublingual tablets, capsules, inhalation aerosols, inhalation solutions, dry powder inhalation, or liquid preparations, such as mixtures, elixirs, syrups or suspensions, all containing the compound of the invention; such preparations may be made by methods well-known in the art.<br>
The diluents which may be used in the preparation of the compositions include those liquid and solid diluents which are compatible with the active ingredient, together with colouring or flavouring agents, if desired. Tablets or capsules may conveniently contain between 2 and 500 mg of active ingredient or the equivalent amount of a salt thereof.<br>
The liquid composition adapted for oral use may be in the form of solutions or suspensions. The solutions may be aqueous solutions of a soluble salt or other derivative of the active compound in association with, for example, sucrose to form a syrup. The suspensions may comprise an insoluble active compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association with water, together with a suspending agent and a flavouring agent.<br>
Compositions for parenteral injection may be prepared from soluble salts, which may or may not be freeze-dried and which may be dissolved in pyrogen free aqueous media or other appropriate parenteral injection fluid.<br>
Compositions for topical administration may take the form of ointments, creams or lotions, all containing the compound of the invention; such preparations may be made by methods well-known in the art.<br><br>
Effective doses are normally in the range of 10-600 mg of active ingredient per day. Daily dosage may be administered in one or more treatments, preferably from 1 to 4 treatments, per day.<br>
The present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples. The examples are given by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as a limiting.<br>
