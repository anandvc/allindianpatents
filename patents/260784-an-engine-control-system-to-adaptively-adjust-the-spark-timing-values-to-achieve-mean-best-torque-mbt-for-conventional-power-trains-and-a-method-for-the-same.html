ADAPTIVE MBT SPARK ADVANCE FOR CONVENTIONAL POWERTRAINS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/898,419, filed on January 30, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to engine control systems,<br>
and more particularly to an adaptive mean best torque (MBT) spark advance<br>
control system for conventional powertrains.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] A typical vehicle engine relies on internal combustion within<br>
engine cylinders to provide torque. A spark generated by a sparkplug ignites<br>
a mixture of air and fuel within the cylinders to cause combustion. Spark<br>
timing and control of the air/fuel mixture determine the performance of the<br>
engine.<br>
[0005] Internal combustion engine control systems are typically<br>
steady-state, throttle-based control systems. In the steady-state control<br>
systems, the torque output of the engine is adjusted to match a load placed<br>
on the engine. The load on the engine can change. For example, the load<br>
can be changed by a driver adjusting a position of an accelerator pedal. The<br>
engine control system adjusts the operation of the engine to match the<br>
changing load placed on the engine.<br>
[0006] The engine control system selects a spark timing for the<br>
engine primarily as a function of the engine speed (RPM) and load.<br>
Compensation can be made for other factors (e.g., temperature, altitude, and<br>
other environmental conditions). The spark timing is selected from a set of<br>
tables accessed by the engine control system.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0007] The values of spark timing in the tables are typically set to<br>
achieve mean best torque for the associated operating conditions. Operating<br>
at the mean best torque results in the best brake-specific fuel consumption at<br>
stoichiometry. The spark timing in these tables is generated on an engine<br>
dynamometer on a few engines and then adjusted on the vehicle during<br>
development. These values of spark timing are programmed into the memory<br>
accessed by the engine control system and used on all engines for that<br>
application. The values of the spark timing that generate the best torque are<br>
usually borderline with detonation. To avoid premature detonation, a knock<br>
sensor in conjunction with a knock detection algorithm can retard the spark<br>
advance from the timing value provided by the table.<br>
[0008] Due to production differences during manufacturing and<br>
aging of the engine and associated components through its lifespan, the spark<br>
timing for mean best torque can differ from the programmed tabulated data<br>
utilized by the engine control system. Thus, the spark timing in the tabulated<br>
data can result in not achieving the mean best torque and, as a result, not<br>
achieving the best brake-specific fuel consumption at stoichiometry.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides an engine<br>
control system to adaptively adjust the spark timing values in the tables to<br>
achieve a mean best torque. The engine control system utilizes a spark<br>
timing module that stores spark timing values in a non-volatile memory as a<br>
function of one or more operating conditions of an engine. An ignition module<br>
can command spark timing based on the spark timing values stored in the<br>
spark timing module. The ignition module can adjust the spark timing during<br>
engine operation within a predetermined operating window. The spark timing<br>
values in the non-volatile memory of the spark timing module can be replaced<br>
based on a change in engine torque output as a result of the adjustment to<br>
the spark timing. The adjusting of the spark timing and replacing the spark<br>
timing values in the non-volatile memory of the spark timing module can allow<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
3<br>
the spark timing values in the non-volatile memory of the spark timing module<br>
to be optimized throughout the engine's useful life.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0011] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes<br>
only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any<br>
way.<br>
[0012] Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary engine<br>
control system according to the present disclosure; and<br>
[0013] Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by the<br>
engine control system according to the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software<br>
or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0015] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12. Engine 12 includes a throttle 14 and an intake manifold 16.<br>
Airflow through throttle 14 and into intake manifold 16 is based on a position<br>
of a throttle plate 18. Air flows into individual cylinders 20 of engine 12.<br>
Although only a single cylinder 20 is shown, it is appreciated that engine 12<br>
can include multiple cylinders 20. Cylinder 20 includes a piston (not shown)<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
that compresses an air/fuel mixture. More specifically, airflow into cylinder 20<br>
is mixed with fuel injected by a fuel injector 22. A sparkplug 24 ignites the<br>
compressed air/fuel mixture in a combustion process to produce engine<br>
torque.<br>
[0016] A controller 26 can contain one or more modules and<br>
controls engine 12 and its torque output. Controller 26 utilizes the adaptive<br>
mean best torque (MBT) spark advance control of the present disclosure to<br>
optimize the spark timing for operation of engine 12. Controller 26 adjusts<br>
the engine torque based on a requested or reference torque. For example,<br>
controller 26 can receive a requested torque command from a driver input<br>
device 27, such as an accelerator pedal, a hand-operated throttle control, or a<br>
computer-based input device. Input device 27 can provide controller 26 with a<br>
signal indicative of a desired torque output or a desired torque change.<br>
[0017] Controller 26 communicates with a mass airflow (MAF)<br>
sensor 28, a throttle position sensor (TPS) 30, a manifold absolute pressure<br>
(MAP) sensor 32, an engine speed sensor 34, and one or more knock<br>
sensor(s) 35. MAF sensor 28 generates a signal indicating the amount of<br>
airflow through throttle 14. TPS 30 generates a signal indicating the position<br>
of throttle plate 18. MAP sensor 32 generates a signal indicating the pressure<br>
within the intake manifold 16. Engine speed sensor 34 generates a signal<br>
indicating the engine speed (RPM). Knock sensor(s) 35 generates a signal<br>
that engine controller 26 can utilize to ascertain if knock is occurring during<br>
operation of engine 12. Controller 26 also communicates with fuel injector 22<br>
to control the fuel rate provided to cylinder 20 and an ignition system 36 to<br>
control timing of the ignition spark. Ambient pressure and temperature signals<br>
are generated by ambient pressure and temperature sensors 38, 40,<br>
respectively, and are communicated to controller 26. Controller 26 also<br>
communicates with a throttle actuator 42. Throttle actuator 42 can adjust the<br>
position of throttle plate 18 based on commands received from controller 26.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
[0018] Controller 26 can include multiple modules to control and<br>
operate engine 12 and vehicle system 10. Alternatively, controller 26 can be<br>
a single integral module. Controller 26 executes the adaptive MBT spark<br>
advance control of the present disclosure. Controller 26 can include an<br>
ignition module 44 that communicates with ignition system 36. Ignition<br>
module 44 can command ignition system 36 to fire sparkplug 24 with a<br>
desired timing.<br>
[0019] Controller 26 can include a spark timing module 46 that<br>
communicates with ignition module 44. Spark timing module 46 stores<br>
tabulated values for spark timing ST used by ignition module 44 in<br>
commanding ignition system 36 to fire sparkplug 24. The spark timing values<br>
ST in spark timing module 46 can be tabulated as a function of the engine<br>
speed (RPM) and the load. Optionally, the spark timing values ST can also be<br>
tabulated as a function of other environmental conditions, such as ambient<br>
temperature, pressure, and altitude. Spark timing module 46 stores the spark<br>
timing values ST in non-volatile memory.<br>
[0020] The initial spark timing values ST in spark timing module 46<br>
are the universal values generated for use with a family of engines 12. The<br>
adaptive MBT spark advance control of the present disclosure adaptively<br>
replaces the spark timing values ST in spark timing module 46 to optimize the<br>
operation of engine 12, as described below.<br>
[0021] Controller 26 can include an operating condition detection<br>
module 48 that communicates with ignition module 44. Operating condition<br>
detection module 48 can monitor the operating condition of engine 12 and<br>
system 10 and allow ignition module 44 to retrieve information related to the<br>
operating condition of engine 12 and/or vehicle system 10. Operating<br>
condition detection module 48 receives signals from MAF sensor 28, TPS 30,<br>
MAP 32, engine speed sensor 34, knock sensor 35, ambient pressure sensor<br>
38, and ambient temperature sensor 40. Operating condition detection<br>
module 48 utilizes these various inputs to ascertain the load on engine 12 and<br>
the engine speed, along with other operating conditions, so that ignition<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
module 44 can extract the appropriate spark timing value ST from spark timing<br>
module 46 and command ignition system 36 to fire sparkplug 24 with the<br>
appropriate timing.<br>
[0022] Ignition module 44 can overwrite or change the spark timing<br>
values ST in spark timing module 46 based on the adaptive MBT spark<br>
advance control of the present disclosure. The adaptive MBT spark advance<br>
control according to the present disclosure is implemented by ignition module<br>
44. Ignition module 44 monitors the operating conditions of engine 12,<br>
retrieves the appropriate spark timing value ST from spark timing module 46,<br>
and commands ignition system 36 to fire a sparkplug 24 with the retrieved<br>
spark timing value ST. When operation of engine 12 is within an optimizing<br>
operating window, ignition module 44 adjusts the spark timing and ascertains<br>
a resulting change in operation of engine 12. The optimizing operating<br>
window can vary or be different for differing operating conditions of engine 12.<br>
For example, an optimizing operating window can include a time period<br>
wherein engine 12 is in steady-state operation. One example of steady-state<br>
engine operation includes a constant load demand being applied to the<br>
engine.<br>
[0023] The change in engine performance as a result of adjusting<br>
the timing can be ascertained by determining a change in torque output of<br>
engine 12. A change in the torque output of engine 12 can be indicated by a<br>
change in engine speed (RPM) as reported by engine speed sensor 34 or by<br>
an actual torque sensor (not shown) that measures a torque value of engine<br>
12, among other ways.<br>
[0024] Along with changing the spark timing and monitoring a<br>
change in engine performance, the adaptive MBT spark advance control also<br>
ascertains if engine knock occurs. If a positive change in the performance of<br>
engine 12 is realized without causing knock, the spark timing value ST<br>
retrieved from spark timing module 46 is overwritten/replaced in the non-<br>
volatile memory to reflect the new spark timing that improved performance of<br>
engine 12.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
[0025] The spark timing can continue to be adjusted (advanced or<br>
retarded) and the change in engine performance ascertained as long as<br>
engine 12 is operating within an optimizing operating window. This procedure<br>
can continue to occur until a spark timing corresponding to mean best torque<br>
is realized and written into the non-volatile memory of spark timing module 46.<br>
[0026] During this process, the operating speed (RPM) of engine 12<br>
is maintained within a predetermined hysterisis band (e.g., initial engine<br>
speed ± 50 RPM). The band can be different for different operating<br>
conditions. The operating band can be chosen to provide a negligible or<br>
imperceptible change in engine operation to an operator of vehicle system 10.<br>
[0027] Thus, by executing the adaptive MBT spark advance control<br>
of the present disclosure, the spark timing values ST stored in spark timing<br>
module 46 can be adaptively replaced during operation of engine 12. The<br>
new spark timing values can provide a mean best torque without causing<br>
engine knock.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figure 2, the steps executed by the<br>
adaptive MBT spark advance control according to the present disclosure will<br>
be described in detail. During operation of engine 12, ignition module 44<br>
implements the adaptive MBT spark advance control of the present<br>
disclosure. Specifically, when engine 12 is running, control, in step 100, uses<br>
spark timing ST from the non-volatile memory of spark timing module 46 to<br>
operate engine 12. Ignition module 44 causes ignition system 36 to fire<br>
sparkplug 24 with the spark timing ST retrieved from spark timing module 46.<br>
In step 102, control determines if engine 12 is within an optimizing operating<br>
window. If engine 12 is not operating within an optimizing operating window,<br>
control returns to step 100 and continues to use spark timing ST from spark<br>
timing module 46 until engine 12 is within an optimizing operating window.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
[0029] When engine 12 is operating within an optimizing operating<br>
window, control moves to step 104. In step 104, control advances the spark<br>
timing ST by one increment to ST+1. For example, control can advance the<br>
spark timing by 1 degree. It should be appreciated that the increment by<br>
which the spark timing ST is advanced can differ from 1 degree increments.<br>
Ignition system 36 changes the timing of sparkplug 24 to spark timing ST+1.<br>
[0030] In step 106, control ascertains if a torque increase in the<br>
output of engine 12 has occurred. A change in torque can be ascertained by<br>
a change in the engine speed as reported by engine speed sensor 34 or by<br>
an actual torque measure by a torque-measuring sensor (not shown). An<br>
increase in torque due to the advancing of the spark timing by one increment<br>
indicates that the spark timing ST in spark timing module 46 is not set to<br>
produce the mean best torque. As a result, improvements in the values of the<br>
spark timing ST in spark timing module 46 can be made.<br>
[0031] If torque increases at step 106, control continues to decision<br>
block 108. The torque increase indicates that an improved spark timing may<br>
be utilized. As such, control, in step 108, ascertains if the operation of engine<br>
12 with the advanced spark timing ST+1 results in engine 12 knocking. If<br>
knocking is detected, then the spark timing for engine 12 is knock limited for<br>
the current operating conditions and control returns the spark timing to ST (the<br>
existing spark timing ST in spark timing module 46), as indicated in step 110.<br>
[0032] With the current spark timing for engine 12 being knock<br>
limited, control monitors the spark timing being utilized from spark timing<br>
module 46 to look for a new opportunity to optimize the spark timing values in<br>
spark timing module 46. A new opportunity occurs when ignition module 44<br>
commands a change in spark timing (a different spark timing from spark<br>
timing module 46 than the just evaluated spark timing). Specifically, control<br>
ascertains if a different spark timing from spark timing module 46 is being<br>
utilized by ignition module 44, as indicated in step 111. When a different<br>
spark timing is being used, a new opportunity to evaluate whether the different<br>
(new) spark timing provides a mean best torque for engine 12 is available and<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
9<br>
control returns to step 100 to seek improvements in the spark timing values in<br>
spark timing module 46. If a different spark timing is not yet being utilized, as<br>
determined in step 111, control continues to monitor the spark timing being<br>
commanded by ignition module 44 until a different spark timing is commanded<br>
and a new opportunity to optimize is presented, at which point control returns<br>
to step 100.<br>
[0033] If engine knocking is not detected in step 108, then an<br>
improved spark timing ST+1 has been discovered and control moves to step<br>
112. In step 112, control replaces the spark timing value in the non-volatile<br>
memory of spark timing module 46 by setting ST = ST+1. The replacing of the<br>
spark timing value by the new advanced spark timing value results in spark<br>
timing module 46 now having a spark timing ST that results in an improvement<br>
in engine torque and operation closer to or equal to MBT operation.<br>
[0034] In step 114, control determines if engine 12 is operating<br>
within a predetermined hysterisis band. The hysterisis band can be chosen to<br>
allow for some change in the engine speed (RPM) during implementation of<br>
the adaptive MBT spark advance control. For example, the hysterisis band<br>
can be 50 RPM from the engine speed prior to altering the spark timing in<br>
step 104. The width of the hysterisis band can vary. For example, the width<br>
can vary based on the operating speed of engine 12 prior to implementing the<br>
adaptive MBT spark advance control and/or the application within which<br>
engine 12 is operating.<br>
[0035] When engine 12 is operating outside the hysterisis band,<br>
control adjusts the position of throttle plate 18 in step 116. Specifically,<br>
control commands throttle actuator 42 to alter the position of throttle plate 18<br>
to bring the engine speed back within the hysterisis band. Control continues<br>
to implement steps 114 and 116 until the engine speed is within the hysterisis<br>
band.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
10<br>
[0036] When engine 12 is operating within the hysterisis band,<br>
control moves to step 118. In step 118, control ascertains if engine 12 is still<br>
operating within the optimizing operating window. If the operation of engine<br>
12 is no longer within the optimizing operating window, control returns to step<br>
100 and uses spark timing ST from spark timing module 46 to operate engine<br>
12. Control continues to monitor the operation of engine 12 to ascertain when<br>
another optimizing operating window presents itself, as indicated in step 102.<br>
[0037] If engine 12 is still operating within the optimizing operating<br>
window, as determined in step 118, control returns to step 104. Control<br>
continues to implement steps 104, 106, 108, and 112-118 so long as<br>
advancing the spark timing results in an increase in torque, does not cause<br>
engine 12 to knock, and the operation of engine 12 remains within the<br>
optimizing operating window. This process enables control to seek the best<br>
spark timing for the current operating conditions of engine 12 and replace the<br>
values in the non-volatile memory of spark timing module 46 to reflect the<br>
improved timing value.<br>
[0038] In some situations, the advancing of the spark timing value<br>
does not result in a torque increase and improvement in performance of<br>
engine 12. The non-increase in the engine torque as a result of advancing<br>
the spark timing ST by one increment can indicate that the current spark<br>
timing value in spark timing module 46 results in an over-sparked (too much<br>
advance) condition or that the current spark timing value in spark timing<br>
module 46 is the value that results in mean best torque. The adaptive MBT<br>
spark advance control of the present disclosure can then look to see if<br>
retarding the spark timing results in an improvement in the performance of<br>
engine 12, as described below. An improvement in performance (torque<br>
increase) of engine 12 is indicative of an over-sparked (too much advance)<br>
condition and retardation of the spark timing can move the spark timing<br>
toward a value corresponding to MBT operation of engine 12.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
11<br>
[0039] If the advancing of the spark timing ST in step 104 does not<br>
result in a torque increase, as ascertained in step 106, control moves to step<br>
120. In step 120, control returns the spark timing to ST (the value in spark<br>
timing module 46). In step 122, control retards spark timing ST by one<br>
increment to ST-1.<br>
[0040] In step 124, control ascertains if the retarding of the spark<br>
timing to ST-1 results in a torque increase. If a torque increase is not realized,<br>
improvement in engine performance by retarding the spark timing is not<br>
available and control moves to step 128. In step 128, control returns the<br>
spark timing to ST (the current value in spark timing module 46).<br>
[0041] After implementing step 128, control monitors the spark<br>
timing being utilized from spark timing module 46 to look for a new opportunity<br>
to optimize the spark timing values in spark timing module 46. A new<br>
opportunity occurs when ignition module 44 commands a change in spark<br>
timing (a different spark timing from spark timing module 46 than the just<br>
evaluated spark timing). Specifically, control ascertains if a different spark<br>
timing from spark timing module 46 is being utilized by ignition module 44, as<br>
indicated in step 130. When a different spark timing is being used, a new<br>
opportunity to evaluate whether the different (new) spark timing provides a<br>
mean best torque for engine 12 is available and control returns to step 100 to<br>
seek improvements in the spark timing values in spark timing module 46. If a<br>
different spark timing is not yet being utilized, as determined in step 130,<br>
control continues to monitor the spark timing being commanded by ignition<br>
module 44 until a different spark timing is commanded and a new opportunity<br>
to optimize is presented, at which point control returns to step 100.<br>
[0042] If the retardation in spark timing results in a torque increase,<br>
as ascertained in step 124, a possible improvement to the spark timing has<br>
been identified and control implements step 126. In step 126, control<br>
ascertains if the retarded spark timing ST-1 results in engine 12 knocking. If a<br>
knock condition is detected, then the possible improvement cannot be used<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
12<br>
and control moves to step 128 and returns the spark timing to ST (the current<br>
value in spark timing module 46).<br>
[0043] If a knock condition is not detected in step 126, control<br>
moves to step 132. In step 132, control replaces the spark timing value in the<br>
non-volatile memory of spark timing module 46 by setting ST = ST-1. As a<br>
result, the value of the spark timing ST stored in spark timing module 46 is<br>
now a value that results in an increase in the torque output of engine 12 over<br>
the previous spark timing value stored in spark timing module 46.<br>
[0044] In step 134, control ascertains if engine 12 is operating within<br>
the hysterisis band. If engine 12 is not operating within the hysterisis band,<br>
control adjusts the throttle, as indicated in step 136. Specifically, control<br>
commands throttle actuator 42 to adjust the position of throttle plate 18 to<br>
bring the speed of engine 12 back within the hysterisis band. Control<br>
continues to implement steps 134 and 136 until the speed of engine 12 is<br>
within the hysterisis band.<br>
[0045] When the speed of engine of 12 is within the hysterisis band,<br>
control implements step 138. In step 138, control ascertains if engine 12 is<br>
still operating within the optimizing operating window. If engine 12 is no<br>
longer operating within the optimizing operating window, control returns to<br>
step 100 and uses spark timing ST from spark timing module 46 and awaits<br>
another opportunity to seek for improvements in the spark timing values in<br>
spark timing module 46.<br>
[0046] If engine 12 is still operating within the optimizing operating<br>
window, as ascertained in step 138, control returns to step 122 and again<br>
retards the spark timing ST by one increment to ST-1 and evaluates the change<br>
in engine torque as a result of the new retarded spark timing ST-1. Control<br>
continues to implement steps 122, 124, 126, and 132-138 as long as the<br>
operation of engine 12 remains within the optimizing operating window, no<br>
knock is detected, and the retardation of the spark timing results in a torque<br>
increase. In this manner, the adaptive MBT spark advance control of the<br>
present disclosure allows control to continue to refine the spark timing values<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
13<br>
seeking the best spark timing for the current operating conditions of engine 12<br>
and replaces the values in the non-volatile memory of spark timing module 46<br>
to reflect the improved timing value.<br>
[0047] Thus, the adaptive MBT spark advance control of the<br>
present disclosure monitors the operating condition of engine 12 and,<br>
whenever an optimizing operating window occurs, implements the adaptive<br>
MBT spark control of the present disclosure. The adaptive MBT spark<br>
advance control incrementally advances the spark timing and ascertains the<br>
resulting change in the engine torque. Control continues to advance the<br>
spark timing as long as an increase in torque is realized (indicative of an<br>
under-sparked condition) and engine knock does not occur. If a torque<br>
increase does not occur, control will begin incrementally retarding the spark<br>
advance and ascertain if an increase in torque occurs, thereby indicating that<br>
the retardation moves the operation of engine 12 more toward the MBT spark<br>
advance value. Control incrementally retards the spark timing until a torque<br>
increase is not achieved and/or a knock condition occurs.<br>
[0048] Each time a torque increase is achieved without causing a<br>
knock, the spark timing value in the non-volatile memory of spark timing<br>
module 46 is overwritten/replaced to reflect the new spark timing value that<br>
improved the operation of engine 12. Once no more torque increase is<br>
achieved without causing knock, the optimized spark advance is then residing<br>
in spark timing module 46 for subsequent use in operation of engine 12. If the<br>
operation of engine 12 remains within the optimizing operation window for a<br>
sufficient duration and the spark timing is not knock limited, the corresponding<br>
spark timing value in spark timing module 46 will reflect the MBT spark<br>
advance for engine 12 for the particular operating parameters.<br><br>
GP-308814-PTE-CD<br>
14<br>
[0049] During the implementing of the MBT spark advance control,<br>
the engine speed is maintained within a predetermined band. Maintaining the<br>
engine speed within the predetermined band can provide for a pleasant<br>
experience of an operator of a vehicle employing vehicle system 10 during<br>
implementation of the MBT spark advance control and can provide a<br>
negligible or imperceptible change in engine operation.<br>
[0050] Thus, the MBT spark advance control of the present<br>
disclosure can continuously seek to optimize the spark timing values in spark<br>
timing module 46 whenever an appropriate optimizing window condition<br>
occurs. This capability allows for the spark timing values to be replaced to<br>
reflect changing performance of engine 12 over time and can also account for<br>
environmental changes, such as changes in altitude, ambient temperature,<br>
and air density.<br>
[0051] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. For example, while the adaptive MBT<br>
spark advance control is described as first implementing a spark advance<br>
and, if necessary, implementing a spark retardation while seeking to optimize<br>
the spark timing value, it should be appreciated that the spark timing can first<br>
be retarded and, if necessary, advanced when seeking the optimized spark<br>
timing value. Therefore, while this disclosure has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the disclosure<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification, and the<br>
