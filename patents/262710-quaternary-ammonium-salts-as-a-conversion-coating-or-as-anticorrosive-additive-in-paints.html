				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of quaternary ammonium salts containing non-halogen anions such as carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate and glycolate as active ingredients of conversion coatings and as additives for paints and coatings.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In processes where metal surfaces come in contact with water, whether as liquid water or humid air, there is always the danger of corrosion. This is particularly problematic when the metal itself is prone to corrosion and is not coated.<br>
Examples of metals prone to corrosion are found in stamped metal car parts made from ferrous alloys, abraded surfaces such as machined steel parts, and machine components made from cast iron.<br>
Conversion coatings are used to inhibit corrosion and to assure good adhesion of paint to a metal surface, in particular to steel. Bare steel does not form a good bond with organic coatings. To improve the metal/organic coating bond, chromate or phosphate conversion coatings are chemically reacted with the steel to form a rough surface structure with metal-phosphate platelets that provide both mechanical and chemical keying (adhesion) of the organic polymer to the metal surface. See, for example, Watson, J. "A refresher: Understanding pretreatment", Powder Coating 1996, 7(3) and Ferguson, D.; Monzyk, B., "Nonpolluting replacement for chromate conversion coating and zinc phosphate in powder coating applications", Powder Coating 2001,12(1). Here and hereinbelow, a conversion coating is to be understood to mean a protective barrier film or layer on the metal substrate surface simultaneously capable of both corrosion inhibition and paint adhesion and comprised of either (i) an organic film, (ii) an inorganic oxide resulting from a metal etching and redeposition process, (iii) an inorganic oxide resulting from a true deposition process, or (iv) any mixture of inorganic and organic materials from (i), (ii) and (iii). The most widely used conversion coatings are chromating, phosphochromating and zinc phosphatizing processes. It is believed that chromating gives better corrosion inhibition, while phosphochromating gives better paint adhesion. Prior to applying the conversion coating to the metal surface, the metal surface must be cleaned in order to remove any grease on the metal surface. The conversion coating can then be applied by either immersion or spraying. Chromate and phosphochromate conversion<br>
coatings are the most common chemical conversion coatings, but because of health, safety and environmental concerns other types of conversion coatings are needed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been discovered that quaternary ammonium salts containing non-halogen anions such bicarbonate, carbonate, phosphate and glycolate, more specifically, dialkyl dimethyl ammonium salts containing bicarbonate, carbonate, phosphate or glycolate as the anion, and various combinations thereof, have applicability as a conversion coating for metal surfaces and steel in particular. Additionally it has been discovered that said quaternaries are capable of effecting a desirable surface transformation such as the growth of desirable surface oxides (i.e. magnetite, Fe3O4) on steel substrates. This oxide formation results in distinct crystallite domains which adhere to the metal substrate and to which coatings such as paints are expected to exhibit improved adhesion. In addition, said quaternary ammonium salts can be added directly to paints to provide better adhesion of the paint to the metal surface and thereby improving corrosion resistance.<br>
The corrosion inhibition properties of quaternary ammonium carbonates and bicarbonates have been disclosed in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/810279 (US 2005/0003978 Al). Additionally it has now been discovered that under the inhibitor film, a protected steel surface grows desirable surface oxides (i.e., magnetite, Fe3O4). This oxide formation creates domains to which organic coatings such as paints are expected to exhibit<br>
improved adhesion.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that certain quaternary ammonium salts containing non-halogen anions, such as di-n-decyldimethylammonium carbonate, when applied to the surface of iron and iron alloys such as steel, have a propensity to effect a known, desirable transformation on the surface of iron and iron alloys such as steel under much milder conditions of temperature than previously known. While thermally induced transformations of steel surfaces at &gt;110 °C are known in the art, the high temperatures required to effect those transformations have heretofore limited their commercial exploitation. However the above mentioned quarter-nary ammonium salts appear capable of effecting a similar transformation of steel surfaces at temperatures as low as room temperature.<br>
Additionally, the unique nature of the above quaternary ammonium salts (either neat or in formulation) allows for a one step metal surface preparation process prior to final coating<br>
applications. It has been found that metal exposure to their solutions will simultaneously clean, corrosion inhibit, and primer coat metal surfaces in preparation for final coating applications. This represents a significant improvement over current processes which perform the following independent functions in a stepwise fashion and with significantly greater amounts of industrial effluents which must be disposed of:<br>
a)	the raw metal is passivated with oil to prevent flash rust.<br>
b)	the passivation oil is removed and disposed of<br>
c)	the metal surface is treated with conversion coating solutions (acidic, heavy metal containing<br>
chemicals) and cured before the final coating is applied.<br>
It has also been found that steel surfaces treated according to the present invention are resistant to flash rusting. Flash rusting occurs when a newly formed bare steel surface is exposed to water and reacts to form a red iron hydroxide rust layer.<br>
Coiled sheet steel treated with according to the present invention is resistant to the edge staining that occurs when moisture condenses on the edges of the coils. Presently steel sheet is sprayed with a light oil prior td storage or transportation. This oil must be removed prior to additional surface treatments or coatings.<br>
The oxide film formed in according to the present invention has the potential of being an under-paint conversion coating or primer for steel. Bare steel does not form a good bond with organic coatings. To improve the metal/organic coating bond, chromate or phosphate conversion coatings are chemically reacted with the steel to form a rough surface structure with metal-phosphate platelets that provide both mechanical and chemical keying (adhesion) of the organic polymer to the metal surface.<br>
It has also been found that the conversion coatings and anticorrosive paints of the present invention exhibit certain self-healing properties on scratching, which means that even the "bare" metal surface in a scratch shows some passivation that may be due to migration of the quaternary ammonium salt from the surrounding coating. In some cases, a permanent oxide transformation is also observed resulting in long term passivation of a scratched area. This is an effect that is similar to the self-healing observed on chromium coated metal surfaces.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a method for applying a conversion coating to the surface of a metal substrate, said method comprising the step of contacting the substrate with a composition comprising<br>
(a)	at least one quaternary ammonium salt containing a non-halogen anion and<br>
(b)	optionally, a solvent.<br>

Example 1<br>
A Conversion Coating Study (Reference: NB5751-001 through 018) was done with the<br>
objective to prepare steel panels (S-46, purchased from Q-Panel Lab Products, Cleveland,<br>
Ohio) with various aqueous treatments of either CarboShield® 1000 (di-n-decyldimethyl-ammonium bicarbonate/carbonate), "Phosphoquat" (di-n-decyldimethylammonium phosphates), and various related controls.<br>
A plastic tank being 27.9 cm (11") in diameter and 27.9 cm (11") in height was used to treat the panels. The plastic tank was filled with 9,600 grams of test solution.<br>
10.16 cm x 15.24 cm x l.59 mm (4"x 6"x 1/16") steel (S-46) panels with a hole of 6.35 mm (1/4") in<br>
diameter located 6.35 mm (14") from the top edge were treated by placing a plastic pipette<br>
through the hole in the panel. Up to three panels were skewed using the same pipette. This allowed for the panels to stand upright, with only the bottom of the panel touching the bottom of the tank. The tank was then placed in an oven which was at 70 °C for one hour. After one hour, the panels were removed from the tank, dried with a paper towel and then wrapped in a plastic wrap and labeled. The test solutions prepared can be found in the list below. All<br>
concentrations are given in percents by weight. The concentrations stated for CarboShield® and Phosphoquat are the true concentrations of the active compound(s):<br>

After the steel panels were treated with the test solutions, they were painted using three different painting processes. Two panels were painted for each painting process. In one of the painting processes, the steel panels were spray painted using Rust-Oleum®'s Professional High Performance Enamel (Hunter Green) spray paint. Four steel panels were laid flat end to end and spray painted with approximately 18 g of paint applied to the top surface of the steel panels and allowed to dry overnight. The bottom of the panels were treated in a similar manner the next<br>
day. A second set of panels were painted using Rust-Oleum®'s Painters Touch® (Hunter Green)<br><br>
latex paint. The paint was applied with a foam roller to the steel panels. A total of two coats of<br>
paint were applied to each side of the steel panels. A third set of panels were painted using a commercial painting process known as E-Coating (a polymer based coating). These samples were painted at Royal E-Coat (Costa Mesa, California), using a proprietary process. A fourth set of steel panels (untreated) were also painted using Rust-Oleum®'s Painters Touch® (Hunter<br>
Green) latex paint to which CarboShield® 1000 was added at either 0.1%, 0.5% or 1.0%. A fifth set of steel panels (untreated) were also painted using Rust-Oleum®'s Gloss Protective Spray Enamel (Hunter Green) paint to which CarboShield® 1000, phosphoquat, or glycoquat was added at indicated levels.<br>
All of the painted samples were sent to Assured Testing Services (224 River Rd., Ridge-way, PA 15853) for salt spray testing (ASTM Bl 17). One set of panels were scored with an "X" in the center of the panel. The amount of paint pull back for the scored X was measured (in mm) in 5 different locations. The measurements were then averaged. The lower the average value, the better was the performance of the treatment. The samples were measured at different time intervals during the course of the testing. The second set was edge coated with wax to prevent edge effects. The undisturbed panel surface was periodically evaluated for total visible rust and rated from 0 to 100%.<br>
Conversion Coating/Paint/Salt Spray Testing Results:<br>
The panels that were spray painted (enamel) exhibited the largest improvement in paint adhesion relative to the control samples. For most of the test samples evaluated, the latex paint samples did not show differences between test sample and the corresponding controls. The E-Coat samples exhibited the least amount of paint pull back after 144 hours. The relevant results where differences exist between the test sample and the control are compiled in Tables 1 and 2 below.<br>

In another test, the amount of visual rust (in %) was determined for undisturbed test panel surfaces painted with latex paint spiked with various amounts of CarboShield® 1000 (CS) after salt spray exposure for 24 to 456 h. The data is compiled in Table 5 below and depicted in Figure 6.<br>

In another test, the amount of visual rust (in %) was determined for undisturbed test panel surfaces painted with gloss protective spray enamel with various amounts of CarboShield® 1000 (CS), phosphoquat, and glycoquat after salt spray exposure for 24 to 168 h. The data is compiled in Table 6 below and depicted in Figure 7.<br>

The formulation of Example 2 was stable for several days, even better than that of Comparative Example 1, with less separation. The formulation was also "creamier" (more desirable) than the comparative formulation. This observation confirms that CarboShield® 1000 is compatible in latex systems.<br>
Hide, which is the ability of a coating to hide black marks, was 96.8% in the<br><br>
comparative example 97.2% in the example according to the invention. This indicates that<br>
CarboShield® 1000 works better than the surfactant Triton® X-100. Hide was measured by contrast ratio using a bird bar draw down (76.2 µm = 3 mil) on a standard Leneta (type 2C) card and are expressed as a ratio of black and white L-values (LAB color system).<br>
The scrub resistance of the paint film prepared from the formulation of Example 2 was 480 cycles to failure while that of the film prepared from the formulation of Comparative Example 1 was only 370 cycles to failure. This is a significant ca. 30% improvement. Scrub resistance was measured using standard ASTM D2486 methodology.<br>
Gloss measurements indicated no significant difference between the coatings prepared from both formulations.<br>
The Stormer viscosity of the Formulation of Example 2 was significantly higher than that of Comparative Example 1, 83 K.U vs. 73 K.U. This allows to reduce the amount of associative thickener added to the formulation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
