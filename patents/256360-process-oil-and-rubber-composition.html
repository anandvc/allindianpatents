DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS OIL AND RUBBER COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention is related to a process oil and a rubber composition formed<br>
by applying the process oil to a natural rubber and a synthetic rubber.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
A rubber used in various fields such as for mechanical and electric products<br>
typically contains a process oil to enhance mechanical property and processability. The<br>
process oil is used as constituents of a plasticizer for a thermoplastic resin and a printing<br>
ink and as a lubricant or solvent component used for a softener or the like for a recycled<br>
asphalt, as well as being added to a rubber material such as a natural rubber and a<br>
synthetic rubber.<br>
[0003]<br>
In recent years, there have been increasing demands for a rubber composition<br>
using an EPDM (Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer), an olefinic thermoplastic<br>
elastomer, a styrenic thermoplastic elastomer or the like, the rubber composition being<br>
used as automobile interior parts. Since the rubber composition is required to have thermal<br>
stability and sunlight stability to be used as the automobile interior parts, a white<br>
paraffinic process oil with high purity is usually employed. For instance, there has been<br>
known a process oil having the following properties: kinematic viscosity at 40 °C = 95 to<br>
300 mm2/s; distillation temperature at 5 vol% in distillation = 445 °C or higher; and color<br>
(Saybolt color) = +15 or higher (see, for instance, Patent Document 1).<br>
[0004]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A- 2000-302919<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br><br>
2<br>
However, the process oil disclosed in Document 1 does not have sufficient<br>
sunlight stability, so that in applications such as the automobile interior parts, which are<br>
exposed to the direct sunlight for a long time, the process oil might cause discoloration of<br>
a rubber material.<br>
[0006]<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process oil capable of<br>
exhibiting properties similar to conventional process oils as well as having excellent<br>
thermal stability and sunlight stability, and to provide a rubber composition using the<br>
process oil.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0007]<br>
A process oil according to an aspect of the present invention has properties of:<br>
(a)	flash point of 250 °C or higher;<br>
(b)	Saybolt color of+28 or higher; and<br>
(c)	ultraviolet absorptivity (198nm) of 1.7 or lower.<br>
[0008]<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the process oil has the<br>
flash point of 250 °C or higher and volatility is low, when being added to and kneaded<br>
with a rubber material, little oil vapor is generated, resulting in excellent workability.<br>
Further, since the process oil has the ultraviolet absorptivity (198nm) of 1.7 or lower, a<br>
rubber composition containing the process oil exhibits excellent sunlight stability.<br>
Meanwhile, the present invention was achieved as a result of discovery of which<br>
the sunlight stability of a white process oil depends on a trace concentration of an aromatic<br>
component contained in the oil. That is, it has been found out that the white process oil<br>
with significantly improved sunlight stability can be obtained by controlling the trace<br>
amount of the aromatic component to be substantially equal to or lower than a<br>
predetermined amount that is set using the ultraviolet absorptivity as an indication.<br>
[0009]<br>
A rubber composition according to another aspect of the present invention<br><br>
3<br>
contains the above-described process oil of the present invention.<br>
According to the aspect of the present invention, since the rubber composition<br>
employs the process oil having the properties as described above, the rubber composition<br>
shows excellent workability with little generation of the oil vapor when the process oil is<br>
added to and kneaded with the rubber material. Further, since the process oil has the<br>
Saybolt color of+28 or higher and the ultraviolet absorptivity (198nm) of 1.7 or lower, the<br>
rubber composition containing the process oil also has a sufficient sunlight stability.<br>
[0010]<br>
In the rubber composition according to the aspect of the present invention, the<br>
rubber material is preferably at least one component selected from the group consisting of<br>
an EPDM, an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer and a styrenic elastomer.<br>
With the arrangement, since the rubber composition is provided with enhanced<br>
sunlight stability while employing the widely-used rubber material such as the EPDM, the<br>
olefinic thermoplastic elastomer and the styrenic elastomer, a technical value especially in<br>
an automobile interior part field can further be enhanced.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]<br>
A process oil of the present invention has properties of (a) to (c) as shown below:<br>
(a)	flash point of 250 °C or higher;<br>
(b)	Saybolt color of+28 or higher; and<br>
(c)	ultraviolet absorptivity (198nm) of 1.7 or lower.<br>
[0012]<br>
(a) Flash Point<br>
The flash point of the process oil of the present invention should be 250 °C or<br>
higher, and preferably 260 °C or higher. When the process oil has the flash point of below<br>
250 °C, amount of evaporation during kneading with a rubber material becomes large,<br>
thus resulting in lowering workability.<br>
Incidentally, the flash point of the process oil may be measured in compliance<br>
with ASTM D 92.<br><br>
4<br>
[0013]<br>
(b) Saybolt Color<br>
The Saybolt color of the process oil of the present invention should be +28 or<br>
higher, and preferably +30 or higher. When the Saybolt color is below +28, concentration<br>
of aromatic component becomes large, which adversely affects the sunlight stability.<br>
Incidentally, the Saybolt color may be measured in compliance with ASTM D<br>
1500.<br>
[0014]<br>
(c) Ultraviolet Absorptivity (198nm)<br>
The ultraviolet absorptivity of the process oil of the present invention should be<br>
1.7 or lower, and preferably 1.6 or lower. The ultraviolet absorptivity exceeding 1.7<br>
indicates that there is contained large amount of the aromatic component that adversely<br>
affects the sunlight stability, thus degrading the sunlight stability.<br>
Note that the ultraviolet absorptivity may be measured in compliance with JIS K<br>
0115. Specifically, the ultraviolet absorptivity is measured as follows: 2.00 gram of a<br>
sample is diluted with a hexane to be 50 ml, which is then placed in 1 mm cell and<br>
irradiated with the wavelength of 198 nm for measurement. The hexane was provided as a<br>
blank in the measurement.<br>
[0015]<br>
An example of a procedure to manufacture the process oil of the present<br>
invention will be described below in detail.<br>
[Manufacturing of Vacuum Gas Oil (Manufacturing Step of Vacuum Gas Oil)]<br>
In a manufacturing step of a vacuum gas oil, vacuum distillation is performed on<br>
an atmospheric residue that is obtained by performing atmospheric distillation on a crude<br>
oil, in order to obtain a vacuum gas oil.<br>
Here, in order to perform the atmospheric distillation on the crude oil, a<br>
conventional atmospheric distillation device and a conventional distillation condition can<br>
be used. Specifically, for instance, the crude oil such as a paraffinic crude oil or a<br>
naphthenic crude oil, which is an object to be refined, is heated to about 350 °C in a<br><br>
5<br>
heating furnace or the like and sent out to an atmospheric distillation column, which is<br>
then turned into a petroleum vapor in the atmospheric distillation column. After cooling,<br>
the petroleum vapor is sequentially fractionated into fractions in the ascending order of<br>
boiling points.<br>
[0016]<br>
Next, further distillation (vacuum distillation) under reduced pressure is<br>
performed on the obtained atmospheric residue. The vacuum distillation may be<br>
performed using a conventional vacuum distillation device and a conventional operating<br>
condition, and the vacuum distillation fractionates the atmospheric residue into fractions<br>
such as a vacuum naphtha, a vacuum gas oil and a vacuum residue, from which the<br>
vacuum gas oil is obtained.<br>
[0017]<br>
[Manufacturing of Deasphalted Oil (Manufacturing Step of Deasphalted Oil)]<br>
The vacuum residue obtained in the above-described step is separated into an oil<br>
component (deasphalted oil) and an asphalt component using a solvent such as a liquefied<br>
propane (or a combined solvent of the liquefied propane and a butane). Deasphalting using<br>
the liquefied propane is performed by, for instance, adding the liquefied propane to the<br>
vacuum residue by an amount of 4.5 to 6 times as large as that of the vacuum residue and<br>
setting extraction temperature to 85-95 °C (column top) / 60-75 °C (column bottom ) to<br>
extract the deasphalted oil.<br>
[0018]<br>
[Hydrocracking Step]<br>
The vacuum gas oil, the deasphalted oil obtained in each step described above or<br>
a mixed oil thereof is hydrocracked under the following conditions.<br>
There may be preferably used a catalyst formed of one or more members selected<br>
from the group consisting of Ni, Mo, W and Co that is supported by an alumina or a silica<br>
as a carrier or a catalyst formed of a noble metal such as Pt and Pd that is supported by a<br>
zeolite.<br>
The hydrocracking temperature is preferably 300 to 450 °C, more preferably 350<br><br>
6<br>
to 400 °C. The hydrogen/raw oil ratio is preferably 500 to 10000 Nm3/KL, more<br>
preferably 800 to 2000 Nm3/KL. The LHSV is preferably 0.1 to 10 Hr"1, more preferably<br>
0.5 to 2.0 Hr"'. The hydrogen pressure is preferably 10 to 25 MPa, more preferably 15 to<br>
20 MPa.<br>
[0019]<br>
[Hydrofinishing Step]<br>
A hydrocracked oil obtained in the hydrocracking step described above is<br>
fractionated into two or more types of distillate oils, each having a specified viscosity, by<br>
the vacuum distillation. Then, the distillate oils are further refined under the following<br>
conditions to obtain a refined oil having a trace concentration of the aromatic component.<br>
There may be preferably used a catalyst formed of one or more members selected<br>
from the group consisting of Ni, Mo, W and Co that is supported by an alumina or a silica<br>
as a carrier or a catalyst formed of a noble metal such as Pt and Pd that is supported by a<br>
zeolite.<br>
[0020]<br>
The finishing temperature is preferably 200 to 350 °C, more preferably 220 to<br>
320 °C. The hydrogen/raw oil ratio is preferably 500 to 10000 Nm /KL, more preferably<br>
500 to 1000 Nm3/KL. The LHSV is preferably 0.1 to 10 Hr"1, more preferably 0.5 to 2.0<br>
Hr"1. The hydrogen pressure is preferably 10 to 25 MPa, more preferably 15 to 20 MPa.<br>
With such conditions for hydrofinishing, the Saybolt color and the ultraviolet absorptivity<br>
can be adjusted.<br>
[0021]<br>
Although the product obtained in the hydrofinishing step described above may be<br>
used in situ as a process oil, it is further subjected to vacuum distillation to remove a light<br>
component as needed, so that the flash point can be adjusted to be 250 °C or lower.<br>
[0022]<br>
Since the process oil of the present invention which is obtained as described<br>
above has the properties of (a) to (c) described above, the process oil with low volatility<br>
and excellent sunlight stability can be realized.<br><br>
7<br>
By adding the process oil to the rubber material which is at least one component<br>
selected from the group consisting of the EPDM, the olefinic thermoplastic elastomer and<br>
the styrenic elastomer, various rubber compositions can be properly provided. The<br>
obtained rubber compositions can be properly used especially as the automobile interior<br>
parts which require sunlight stability.<br>
[0023]<br>
When a rubber (rubber composition) is manufactured using the process oil of the<br>
present invention, the process oil may be added by, for instance, 10 to 50 parts by mass,<br>
preferably 20 to 40 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of a rubber material.<br>
Also, in order to manufacture the rubber composition, reinforcers such as a<br>
carbon black and a silica, a vulcanizing agent, a vulcanizing accelerator, a filler, an<br>
antidegradant such as waxes, a softener or a plasticizer, etc. other than the process oil of<br>
the present invention, which are generally used in the rubber industry, may appropriately<br>
be added, in addition to the process oil of the present invention and the rubber material.<br>
[0024]<br>
Incidentally, the embodiment described above is only an embodiment illustrating<br>
the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to the embodiment but<br>
includes modifications and improvements as long as the object and the advantages of the<br>
present invention can be achieved. Specific structure and shape of the components in the<br>
present invention may be designed in any manner as long as the object and the advantages<br>
of the present invention can be achieved.<br>
For instance, as long as the process oil has the properties of (a) to (c), the<br>
procedure to obtain the process oil may appropriately be adjusted.<br>
[Example]<br>
[0025]<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in more detail with examples and<br>
comparisons, the description of which by no means limits the present invention.<br>
[Example 1 and 2]<br>
(Vacuum Gas Oil Manufacturing Step)<br><br>
8<br>
By performing the atmospheric distillation on a middle-east crude oil to obtain a<br>
fuel oil such as a kerosene and a gas oil and further performing the vacuum distillation on<br>
an atmospheric residue from a distillation column bottom to obtain a vacuum gas oil.<br>
[0026]<br>
(Deasphalting Step)<br>
Deasphalting was performed, using a propane as a solvent, on a vacuum residue<br>
that was obtained after fractionating the vacuum gas oil in the above-described step to<br>
obtain a deasphalted oil.<br>
[0027]<br>
(Mixing Step)<br>
The vacuum gas oil and the deasphalted oil obtained in the above-described steps<br>
were mixed by a volume ratio of 60/40 to obtain a mixed oil.<br>
(Hydrocracking Step)<br>
Using a catalyst having Ni and W supported by an alumina, the hydrocracking<br>
was performed on the mixed oil under the following conditions: reaction pressure = 200<br>
Kg/cm ; reaction temperature = 384 °C; LHSV = 1.0 Hr" ; and mixing ratio of<br>
hydrogen/mixed oil = 1000 Nm3/KL. A product obtained by the hydrocracking was<br>
subjected to the vacuum distillation and fractionated into four types of viscosity fractions,<br>
from which heavy fractions having viscosity at 40°C of 94 mm /s and 430 mm /s were<br>
sent to a hydrofinishing step.<br>
[0028]<br>
(Hydrofinishing Step)<br>
The hydrofinishing was performed on the two types of fractions described above<br>
using the catalyst having Ni and W supported by the alumina under the following<br>
conditions: reaction temperature that causes the ultraviolet absorptivity of the product to<br>
be 1.7 or lower; reaction pressure = 20 MPa; LHSV = 0.5Hr_1; and mixing ratio of<br>
hydrogen/mixed oil = 1000 Nm /KL. Finally, a product having viscosity at 40°C of 92<br>
mm /s was obtained from the fraction having viscosity at 40°C of 94 mm Is, while a<br>
product having viscosity at 40°C of 380 mm2/s was obtained from the fraction having<br><br>
9<br>
viscosity at 40°C of 430 mm /s. The obtained products were respectively provided as<br>
process oils of Examples 1 and 2.<br>
[0029]<br>
[Comparison 1 and 2]<br>
Hydrofmishing was performed under the same conditions as the hydrofinishing<br>
step for the Examples 1 and 2, except that the reaction temperature was lowered by 10 °C.<br>
As a result, products respectively having the ultraviolet absorptivity of 1.8 and 2.0 were<br>
obtained. The obtained products were respectively provided as Comparisons 1 and 2.<br>
[0030]<br>
[Comparison 3]<br>
A fraction having viscosity at 40°C of 32 mm Is (a light fraction in the four types<br>
of viscosity fractions obtained in Example 1) that has been subjected to hydrofinishing so<br>
as to have the ultraviolet absorptivity of 1.2 was mixed with the product having higher<br>
viscosity (viscosity at 40°C of 380mm Is) that is obtained in the hydrofinishing step in<br>
Example 2, in order to obtain a product with viscosity at 40°C of 95 mm2/s. The obtained<br>
product was provided as a process oil of Comparison 3.<br>
[0031]<br>
[Comparison 4]<br>
The product having high viscosity (430 mm2/s) obtained in the hydrocracking<br>
step of Example 2 was subjected to sulfuric acid treatment and white clay treatment to be<br>
purified, by which a white product having the Saybolt color of +30 was obtained. The<br>
obtained product was provided as a process oil of Comparison 4.<br>
[0032]<br>
[Comparison 5]<br>
Hydrofinishing was performed under the same conditions as the hydrofinishing<br>
step for Example 1, except that the reaction temperature for the fraction having the<br>
viscosity at 40 °C of 94 mm Is was lowered by 5 °C. As a result, a product having the<br>
ultraviolet absorptivity of 1.79 was obtained. The obtained product was provided as a<br>
process oil of Comparison 5.<br><br>
10<br>
[0033]<br>
[Test Example 1]<br>
For the process oils of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparisons 1 to 4, the Saybolt<br>
colors after the resistance tests were measured. In addition, volatility of the process oils<br>
were also evaluated. Properties and the test results of the process oils are shown in Table 1.<br>
Note that the following test method and evaluation method were employed.<br>
[0034]<br>
(Sunlight Stability Test)<br>
The process oils were irradiated by a xenon lamp at 65 °C for 8 hours to measure<br>
coloring (Saybolt color) of the process oils. Note that the time corresponds to a condition<br>
in which the process oils are exposed outdoors for one month in summer. A process oil<br>
having excellent sunlight stability shows almost no coloring, while a process oil with poor<br>
sunlight stability shows significant coloring even after several hours.<br>
[0035]<br>
(Volatility)<br>
Measurement was conducted in compliance with JIS K 2540 "Petroleum<br>
products-Lubricating oils-Determination of thermal stability". Specifically, 10 gram of a<br>
sample process oil was placed in a predetermined container, heated at 200 °C for one hour.<br>
Mass loss at this time was evaluated in accordance with the following criteria.<br>
A: mass loss of 0.2 mass% or smaller<br>
B: mass loss of above 0.2 mass% to 0.3 mass%<br>
C: mass loss of above 0.3 mass%<br><br>

[0037]<br>
(Result)<br>
From Table 1, it was verified that the process oils of Examples 1 and 2 had high<br>
flash points and thus had excellent volatility. In addition, the process oils of Examples 1<br>
and 2 showed the ultraviolet absorptivities of 1.7 or lower, which indicated that the<br>
contents of the aromatic component having an adverse effect on the sunlight stability were<br>
small. Owing to this, the Saybolt colors after the sunlight stability tests showed no<br>
coloring, so that it was verified that the process oils of Examples 1 and 2 had excellent<br>
sunlight stability.<br>
On the other hand, all of the process oils of Comparisons 1, 2 and 4 showed the<br>
ultraviolet absorptivity of above 1.7, which indicated that they had poor sunlight stability,<br>
so that all of them showed coloring after the sunlight stability test. Especially, since the<br>
process oil of Comparison 4 showed the ultraviolet absorptivity of 10 or higher, which<br>
was quite high, the coloring was significant. Although the process oil of Comparison 3<br>
showed no coloring, the flash point was below 250 °C, which indicated that it had poor<br>
(high) volatility and would show poor operability when being kneaded with rubbers.<br>
Although the process oil of Comparison 5 showed the Saybolt color of +30, since the<br><br>
12<br>
ultraviolet absorptivity exceeded 1.7, coloring after the sunlight stability test was<br>
observed.<br>
[0038]<br>
[Test Example 2]<br>
Using the process oils obtained in Examples 1 and 2 and Comparisons 1 to 5<br>
described above, styrenic rubbers were manufactured as described below.<br>
100 parts by mass of a styrenic thermoplastic elastomer ("Kraton G 1652"<br>
manufactured by KRATON Polymers, Japan) and 70 parts by mass of the process oil were<br>
kneaded and milled by two rolls into a sheet, which was then molded with a die at 200 °C<br>
to obtain a rubber sheet with 2 mm thick.<br>
The sunlight stability tests with two different irradiation times (24 hours and 78<br>
hours) were conducted on the obtained rubber sheet under the same conditions as Test<br>
Example 1, and presence of discoloration (coloring) of the rubber was visually evaluated<br>
in accordance with the following criteria. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
A: Not colored<br>
B: Slightly colored<br>
C: Discolored to yellow<br>
D: Discolored to brown<br>

(Result)<br>
From Table 2, it was verified that the rubbers of Examples 1 and 2 showed almost<br>
no coloring even after the 78-hour sunlight stability test. On the other hand, all the rubbers<br><br>
13<br>
of Comparisons 1, 2 and 5 discolored into yellow after 78 hours. Especially, the rubber of<br>
Comparison 4 showed significant discoloration, the sunlight stability test was discontinued<br>
at 24 hours.<br>
