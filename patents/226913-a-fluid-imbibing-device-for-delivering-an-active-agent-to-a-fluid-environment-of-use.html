				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention is related to the sustained delivery of a biologically<br>
active agent. More particularly, the invention is directed to an implantable<br>
delivery system for the prolonged delivery of an active agent to a fluid<br>
environment in a natural or artificial body cavity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Treatment of disease by prolonged delivery of an active agent at a<br>
controlled rate has been a goal in the drug delivery field. Various approac<br>
have been taken toward delivering the active agents.<br>
One approach involves the use of implantable diffusional systems,<br>
example, subdermal implants for contraception are described by Philip D.<br>
Darney in Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1991, 3:470-476<br>
Norplant® requires the placement of 6 levonorgestrel-filled silastic capsule<br>
under the skin. Protection from conception for up to 5 years is achieved,<br>
implants operate by simple diffusion, that is, the active agent diffuses through<br>
the polymeric material at a rate that is controlled by the characteristics of the<br>
active agent formulation and the polymeric material. Darney further describe<br>
biodegradable implants, namely Capranor™ and norethindrone pellets.<br>
These systems are designed to deliver contraceptives for about one year and<br>
then dissolve. The' Capranor™ systems consist of poly(ε-caprolactone)<br>
capsules that are filled with levonorgestrel and the pellets are 10% pure<br>
cholesterol with 90% norethindrone.<br>
Implantable infusion pumps have also been described for delivering<br>
drugs by intravenous, intra-arterial, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intraspinal and<br>
epidural pathways. The pumps are usually surgically inserted into a<br><br>
subcutaneous pocket of tissue in the lower abdomen. Systems for pain<br>
management, chemotherapy and insulin delivery are described in the BBI<br>
Newsletter, Vol. 17, No. 12, pages 209-211, December 1994. These system<br>
provide for more accurately controlled delivery than simple diffusional<br>
systems.<br>
One particularly promising approach involves osmotically driven<br>
devices such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,987,790, 4,865,845,<br>
5,057,318, 5,059,423, 5,112,614, 5,137,727, 5,234,692 and 5,234,693<br>
which are incorporated by reference herein. These devices can be implantec<br>
into an animal to release the active agent in a controlled manner for a<br>
predetermined administration period. In general, these devices operate by<br>
imbibing fluid from the outside environment and releasing corresponding<br>
amounts of the active agent.<br>
The above-described devices have been useful for delivering active<br>
agents to a fluid environment of use. Although these devices have found<br>
application for human and veterinary purposes, there remains a need for<br>
devices that are capable of delivering active agents, particularly potent<br>
unstable agents, reliably to a human being at a controlled rate over a<br>
prolonged period of time.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Implantable osmotic systems for delivery of an active agent to an<br>
animal are well known. Adaptation of these systems for human use raises a<br>
number of difficult issues. The size of the device may need to be decreased<br>
for human implantation. The strength of the device must be sufficient to<br>
ensure a robust system. Accurate and reproducible delivery rates and<br>
durations must be ensured and the period from implantation to start-up of<br>
delivery must be minimized. The active agent must return its purity and<br>
extended periods of time at the elevated temperatures<br>
in the body cavity.<br><br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention is a fluid-imbibing device for<br>
delivering an active agent formulation to a fluid environment of use. The<br>
device comprises a water-swellable, semipermeable material that is received<br>
in sealing relationship with the interior surface at one end of an impermeable<br>
reservoir. The device further contains an active agent to be displaced from<br>
the device when the water-swellable material swells.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to an implantable device for<br>
delivering an active agent to a fluid environment of use. The device<br>
comprises a reservoir and a back diffusion regulating outlet in a mating<br>
relationship. The flow path of the active agent comprises a pathway formed<br>
between the mating surfaces of the back diffusion regulating outlet and the<br>
reservoir.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a device for<br>
storing an active agent in a fluid environment of use during a predetermined<br>
administration period, the device comprising a reservoir containing an active<br>
agent. The reservoir is impermeable and formed at least in part from a<br>
metallic material. The portion of the reservoir contacting the active agent is<br>
non-reactive with the active agent, and is formed of a material selected from<br>
the group consisting of titanium and its alloys.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention is an implantable fluid-imbibing active<br>
agent delivery system that comprises an impermeable reservoir. The<br>
reservoir contains a piston that divides the reservoir into an active agent<br>
containing chamber and a water-swellable agent containing chamber. The<br>
active agent containing chamber is provided with a back-diffusion regulating<br>
outlet. The water-swellable agent containing chamber is provided with a<br>
semipermeable plug. Either the plug or the outlet is releasable from the<br>
reservoir at an internal pressure that is lower than the maximum osmotic<br>
pressure generated by the water-swellable agent.<br>
The invention is further directed to a fluid-imbibing implantable active<br>
agent delivery system where the time to start-up of delivery is less than 10%<br>
of the predetermined administration period.<br><br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method for preparing a<br>
fluid-imbibing implantable active agent delivery system. The method<br>
comprises injection molding a semipermeable plug into the end of an<br>
impermeable reservoir such that the plug is protected by the reservoir.<br>
In still another aspect, the invention is directed to an impermeable<br>
active agent delivery system for delivering an active agent that is susceptible<br>
to degradation. The reservoir contains a piston that divides the reservoir into<br>
a water-swellable agent chamber and an active agent chamber. The open<br>
end of the water-swellable agent chamber contains a semipermeable<br>
membrane and the open end of the active agent chamber contains a back-<br>
diffusion regulating outlet. The system effectively seals the active agent<br>
chamber and isolates it from the environment of use.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention is directed to a back-diffusion<br>
regulating outlet useful in an active agent delivery system. The outlet defines<br>
a flow path wherein the length, interior cross-sectional shape and area<br>
provide for an average linear velocity of active agent that is higher than the<br>
linear inward flow of fluid in the environment of use.<br>
The invention is also directed to a semipermeable plug useful in an<br>
active agent delivery system. The plug is water-swellable and must expand<br>
linearly in the delivery system to commence pumping upon insertion of the<br>
system into the fluid environment of use.<br>
The invention is further directed to implantable delivery systems useful<br>
for delivering leuprolide.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a device for the delivery of an active<br>
agent to a fluid environment of use in which the active agent must be<br>
protected from the fluid environment until it is delivered. Prolonged and<br>
controlled delivery is achieved.<br>
Definitions<br>
The term "active agent" intends the active agent(s) optionally in<br>
combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and, optionally<br>
additional ingredients such as antioxidants, stabilizing agents, permeation<br>
enhancers, etc.<br>
By a "predetermined administration period" is intended a period of<br>
greater than 7 days, often between about 30 days and 2 years, preferably<br>
greater than about 1 month and usually between about 1 month and 12<br>
months.<br>
By the time to "start-up" of delivery is intended the time from insertion<br>
into the fluid environment of use until the active agent is actually delivered at<br>
a rate not less than approximately 70% of the intended steady-state rate.<br><br>
The term "impermeable" intends that the material is sufficiently<br>
impermeable to environmental fluids as well as ingredients contained within<br>
the dispensing device such that the migration of such materials into or out of<br>
the device through the impermeable device is so low as to have substantially<br>
no adverse impact on the function of the device during the delivery period.<br>
The term "semipermeable" intends that the material is permeable to<br>
external fluids but substantially impermeable to other ingredients contained<br>
within the dispensing device and the environment of use.<br>
As used herein, the terms "therapeutically effective amount" or<br>
"therapeutically effective rate" refer to the amount or rate of the active agent<br>
needed to effect the desired biologic or pharmacologic effect.<br>
The active agent delivery devices of the invention find use where the<br>
prolonged and controlled delivery of an active agent is desired. In many<br>
cases the active agent is susceptible to degradation if exposed to the<br>
environment of use prior to delivery and the delivery devices protect the agent<br>
from such exposure.<br>
Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of the device according to the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1 a fluid-imbibing system 10 is shown that comprises an impermeable<br>
reservoir 12. The reservoir 12 is divided into two chambers by a piston 16.<br>
The first chamber 18 is adapted to contain an active agent and the second<br>
chamber 20 is adapted to contain a fluid-imbibing agent. A back-diffusion<br>
regulating outlet 22 is inserted into the open end of the first compartment 18<br>
and a water-swellable semipermeable plug 24 is inserted into the open end of<br>
the second chamber 20. In Fig. 1, the back-diffusion regulating outlet 22 is<br>
shown as a male threaded member in a mating relationship with the smooth<br>
interior surface of the reservoir 12 thereby forming therebetween helical flow<br>
path 34. The pitch (x), the amplitude (y), and the cross-sectional area and<br>
shape of the helical path 34 formed between the mating surfaces of the back-<br>
diffusion regulating outlet 22 and the reservoir 12 as shown in Fig. 3 are<br>
factors that affect both the efficiency of path 34 preventing back-diffusion of<br>
external fluid into the formulation in chamber 18 and the back pressure in the<br><br>
device. The geometry of outlet 22 prevents water diffusion into the reservoir.<br>
In general, it is desired that these characteristics be selected so that the<br>
length of the helical flow path 34 and the velocity of flow of active agent<br>
therethrough is sufficient to prevent back-diffusion of external fluid through the<br>
flow path 34 without significantly increasing the back pressure, so that,<br>
following start-up, the release rate of the active agent is governed by the<br>
osmotic pumping rate.<br>
Fig. 2 is a second embodiment of the device of the invention with a<br>
reservoir 12, piston 16 and plug 26. In this embodiment, the flow path 36 is<br>
formed between a threaded back-diffusion regulating outlet 40 and threads 38<br>
formed on the interior surface of the reservoir 12. The amplitudes of the<br>
threaded portions of the back-diffusion regulating outlet 40 and reservoir 12<br>
are different so that a flow path 36 is formed between the reservoir 12 and the<br>
back-diffusion regulating outlet 40.<br>
The water-swellable semipermeable plugs 24 and 26 shown in Figs. 1<br>
and 2 respectively are inserted into the reservoir such that the reservoir wall<br>
concentrically surrounds and protects the plug. In Fig. 1, the top portion 50 of<br>
the plug 24 is exposed to the environment of use and may form a flanged end<br>
cap portion 56 overlaying the end of reservoir 12. The semipermeable plug<br>
24 is resiliently engaged with the interior surface of the reservoir 12 and in<br>
Fig. 1 is shown to have ridges 60 that serve to frictionally engage the<br>
semipermeable plug 24 with the interior of reservoir 12. In addition, the<br>
ridges 60 serve to produce redundant circumferential seals that function<br>
before the semipermeable plug 24 expands due to hydration. The clearance<br>
between ridges 60 and the interior surface of the reservoir 12 prevents<br>
hydration swelling from exerting stresses on the reservoir 12 that can result in<br>
tensile failure of the reservoir 12 or compression or shear failure of the plug<br>
24. Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the semipermeable plug 26 where<br>
the plug is injection molded into the top portion of the reservoir and where the<br>
top of the semipermeable plug 26 is flush with the top 62 of the reservoir 12.<br>
In this embodiment, the diameter of the plug is substantially less than the<br><br>
diameter of the reservoir 12. In both embodiments the plugs 24 and 26 will<br>
swell upon exposure to the fluid in body cavity forming an even tighter seal<br>
with the reservoir 12.<br>
The novel configurations of the components of the above-described<br>
embodiments provide for implantable devices that are uniquely suited for<br>
implantation into humans and can provide delivery devices which are capably<br>
of storing unstable formulations at body temperatures for extended periods of<br>
time, which devices have start-up times of less than 10% of the administration<br>
period and can be designed to be highly reliable and with predictable fail safety<br>
modes.<br>
Reservoir 12 must be sufficiently strong to ensure that it will not leak,<br>
crack, break or distort so as to expel its active agent contents under stresses<br>
it would be subjected to during use while being impermeable. In particular, it<br>
should be designed to withstand the maximum osmotic pressure that could be<br>
generated by the water-swellable material in chamber 20. Reservoir 12 must<br>
also be chemically inert and biocompatible, that is, it must be non-reactive<br>
with the active agent formulation as well as the body. Suitable materials<br>
generally comprise a non-reactive polymer or a biocompatible metal or alloy.<br>
The polymers include acrylonitrile polymers such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-<br>
styrene terpolymer, and the like; halogenated polymers such as<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, poiychlorotrifluoroethylene, copolymer<br>
tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene; polyimide; polysulfone;<br>
polycarbonate; polyethylene; polypropylene; polyvinylchloride-acrylic<br>
copolymer; polycarbonate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; polystyrene; and<br>
the like. The water vapor transmission rate through compositions useful for<br>
Forming the reservoir are reported in J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 29, pp. 1634-37<br>
(1970), Ind. Eng. Chem., Vol. 45, pp. 2296-2306 (1953); Materials<br>
Engineering, Vol. 5, pp. 38-45 (1972); Ann. Book of ASTM Stds., Vol. 8.02,<br>
Dp. 208-211 and pp. 584-587 (1984); and Ind. and Eng. Chem., Vol. 49, pp.<br>
1933-1936 (1957). The polymers are known in the Handbook of Common<br>
°olymers by Scott and Roff, CRC Press, Cleveland Rubber Co., Cleveland,<br><br>
OH. Metallic materials useful in the invention include siainless steel, titanium,<br>
platinum, tantalum, gold and their alloys as well as gold-plated ferrous alloys,<br>
platinum-plated ferrous alloys, cobalt-chromium alloys and titanium nitride<br>
coated stainless steel. A reservoir made from titanium or a titanium alloy<br>
having greater than 60%, often greater than 85% titanium is particularly<br>
preferred for the most size-critical applications, for high payload capability and<br>
for long duration applications and for those applications where the formulation<br>
is sensitive to body chemistry at the implantation site or where the body is<br>
sensitive to the formulation. Preferred systems maintain at least 70% active<br>
agent after 14 months at 37°C and have a shelf stability of at least about 9<br>
months, or more preferably at least about two years, at 2-8°C. Most<br>
preferably, systems may be stored at room temperature. In certain<br>
embodiments, and for applications other than the fluid-imbibing devices<br>
specifically described, where unstable formulations are in chamber 18,<br>
particularly protein and/or peptide formulations, the metallic components to<br>
which the formulation is exposed must be formed of titanium or its alloys as<br>
described above.<br>
The devices of this invention provide a sealed chamber 18 which<br>
effectively isolates the formulation from the fluid environment. The reservoir<br>
12 is made of a rigid, impermeable and strong material. The water-swellable<br>
semipermeable plug 24 is of a lower durometer material and will conform to<br>
the shape of the reservoir to produce a liquid-tight seal with the interior of<br>
reservoir 12 upon wetting. The flow path 34 isolates chamber 18 from back-<br>
diffusion of environmental fluid. Piston 16 isolates chamber 18 from the<br>
environmental fluids that are permitted to enter chamber 20 through<br>
semipermeable plugs 24 and 26 such that, in use at steady-state flow, active<br>
agent is expelled through outlet 22 at a rate corresponding to the rate at<br>
which water from the environment flows into the water-swellable material in<br>
chamber 20 through semipermeable plugs 24 and 26. As a result, the plug<br>
and the active agent formulation will be protected from damage and their<br>
functionality will not be compromised even if the reservoir is deformed. In<br><br>
addition, the use of sealants and adhesives will be avoided and the attendant<br>
issues of biocompatibility and ease of manufacture resolved.<br>
Materials from which the semipermeable plug are made are those that<br>
are semipermeable and that can conform to the shape of the reservoir upon<br>
wetting and adhere to the rigid surface of the reservoir. The semipermeable<br>
plug expands as it hydrates when placed in a fluid environment so that a seal<br>
is generated between the mating surfaces of the plug and the reservoir. The<br>
strength of the seals between the reservoir 12 and the outlet 22 and the<br>
reservoir 12 and the plugs 24 and 26 can be designed to withstand the<br>
maximum osmotic pressure generated by the device. In a preferred<br>
alternative, the plugs 24 and 26 may be designed to withstand at least 10X<br>
the osmotic agent compartment 20 operating pressure. In a further<br>
alternative the plugs 24 and 26 may be releasable from the reservoir at an<br>
internal pressure that is lower than the pressure needed to release the back<br>
diffusion regulating outlet. In this fail safe embodiment, the water-swellable<br>
agent chamber will be opened and depressurized, thus avoiding dispelling<br>
the diffusion regulating outlet and attendant release of a large quantity of the<br>
active agent. In other cases, where a fail-safe system requires the release of<br>
the active agent formulation rather than the water-swellable agent<br>
formulation, the semipermeable plug must be releasable at a pressure that is<br>
higher than the outlet.<br>
In either case, the semipermeable plug must be long enough to<br>
sealably engage the reservoir wall under the operating conditions, that is, it<br>
should have an aspect ratio of between 1:10 and 10:1 length to diameter,<br>
preferably at least about 1:2 length to diameter, and often between 7:10 and<br>
2:1. The plug must be able to imbibe between about 0.1% and 200% by<br>
weight of water. The diameter of the plug is such that it will sealingly fit inside<br>
the reservoir prior to hydration as a result of sealing contact at one or more<br>
circumferential zones and will expand in place upon wetting to form an even<br>
tighter seal with the reservoir. The polymeric materials from which the<br>
semipermeable plug may be made vary based on the pumping rates and<br><br>
device configuration requirements and include but are not limited to<br>
plasticized cellulosic materials, enhanced polymethylmethacrylate such as<br>
hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and elastomeric materials such as<br>
polyurethanes and polyamides, polyether-polyamide copolymers,<br>
thermoplastic copolyesters and the like.<br>
The piston 16 isolates the water-swellable agent in chamber 20 from<br>
the active agent in chamber 18 and must be capable of sealably moving<br>
under pressure within reservoir 12. The piston 16 is preferably made of a<br>
material that is of lower durometer than the reservoir 12 and that will deform<br>
to fit the lumen of the reservoir to provide a fluid-tight compression seal with<br>
the reservoir 12. The materials from which the piston are made are<br>
preferably elastomeric materials that are impermeable and include but are not<br>
limited to polypropylene, rubbers such as EPDM, silicone rubber, butyl<br>
rubber, and the like, and thermoplastic elastomers such as plasticized<br>
polyvinylchloride, polyurethanes, Santoprene®, C-Flex® TPE (Consolidated<br>
Polymer Technologies Inc.), and the like. The piston may be of a self-loading<br>
or compression-loaded design.<br>
The back-diffusion regulating outlet 22 forms the delivery pathway<br>
through which the active agent flows from the chamber 18 to the implantation<br>
site where absorption of the active agent takes place. The seal between the<br>
outlet 22 and the reservoir 12 can be designed to withstand the maximum<br>
osmotic pressure generated within the device or to fail-safe in the modes<br>
described above. In a preferred embodiment, the pressure required to<br>
release back-diffusion regulating outlet 22 is at least 10X the pressure<br>
required to move piston 16 and/or at least 10X the pressure in chamber 18.<br>
The exit flow path of the active agent is the pathway 34 formed<br>
between the mating surfaces of the back-diffusion regulating outlet 22 and the<br>
reservoir 12. The pathway length, interior cross-sectional shape and area of<br>
the outlet path 34 or 36 are chosen such that the average linear velocity of<br>
the exiting active agent is higher than that of the linear inward flux of materials<br>
in the environment of use due to diffusion or osmosis, thereby attenuating or<br><br>
moderating back-diffusion and its deleterious effects of contaminating the<br>
interior of the pump, destabilizing, diluting, or otherwise altering the<br>
formulation. The release rate of active agent can be modified by modifying<br>
the outlet pathway geometry, which relationship is shown below.<br>
The convective flow of active agent out of outlet 22 is set by the<br>
pumping rate of the system and the concentration of active agent in chamber<br>
20 and can be represented as follows:<br>
Qca = (Q)(Ca)	(1)<br>
where<br>
Qca is the convective transport of agent A in mg/day<br>
Q is the overall convective transport of the agent and its<br>
diluents in cm3/day<br>
Ca is the concentration of agent A in the formulation within<br>
chamber 20 in mg/cm3<br>
The diffusive flow of agent A through the material in the outlet 22 is a<br>
function of agent concentration, cross-sectional configuration of flow path 34<br>
or 36, agent diffusivity and length of flow path 34 or 36, and can be<br>
represented as follows:<br><br>
where<br>
Qda is the diffusive transport of agent A in mg/day<br>
D is the diffusivity through the material in path 34 or 36 in<br>
cm2/day<br>
r is the effective inner radius of the flow path in cm<br>
∆Ca is the difference between the concentration of agent A in<br>
the reservoir and in the body outside of the outlet 22 in<br>
mg/cm3<br>
L is the length of the flow path in cm<br><br>
In general, the concentration of agent in the reservoir is much greater<br>
than the concentration of agent in the body outside of the orifice such that the<br>
difference, ACa can be approximated by the concentration of agent within the<br>
reservoir, Ca.<br><br>
It is generally desirable to keep the diffusive flux of agent at less than<br>
10% of the convective flow. This is represented as follows:<br><br>
Equation 4 indicates that the relative diffusive flux decreases with<br>
increasing volumetric flow rate and path length and increases with increasing<br>
diffusivity and channel radius and is independent of drug concentration.<br>
Equation 4 is plotted in Figure 4 as a function of length (L) and diameter (d)<br>
for D = 2 x 10-6 cm2/sec and Q = 0.36 µl/day.<br>
The diffusive flux of water where the orifice opens into chamber 18<br>
can be approximated as:<br><br>
where<br>
Co is the concentration profile of water in mg/cm3<br>
Q is the mass flow rate in mg/day<br>
L is the length of the flow path in cm<br>
Dw is the diffusivity of water through the material in the flow path in<br>
cm2/day<br>
A is the cross-sectional area of the flow path in cm2<br><br>
The hydrodynamic pressure drop across the orifice can be calculated<br>
as follows:<br><br>
Simultaneously solving equations (4), (5) and (6) gives the values<br>
shown in Table 1 where:<br>
Q	=0.38 µl/day<br>
Ca	= 0.4 mg/µl<br>
L	= 5 cm<br>
Da	= 2.00 E-06 cm2/sec<br>
H	= 5.00 E + 02 cp<br>
Cw0 = 0 mg/µl<br>
Dw	= 6.00 E + 06 cm2/sec<br><br><br>
The calculations indicate that an orifice diameter of between about 3<br>
and 10 mil and a length of 2 to 7 cm is optimal for a device with the operating<br>
conditions described. In a preferred embodiment, the pressure drop across<br>
the orifice is less than 10% of the pressure required to release the back-<br>
diffusion regulating outlet 22.<br>
The back-diffusion regulating outlet 22 preferably forms a helical<br>
pathway 34 or 36 incorporating a long flow path with a means of mechanically<br>
attaching the outlet into the reservoir without using adhesives or other<br>
sealants. The back-diffusion regulating outlet is made of an inert and<br>
biocompatible material selected from but not limited to metals including but<br>
not limited to titanium, stainless steel, platinum and their alloys and cobalt-<br>
chromium alloys and the like, and polymers including but not limited to<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate and<br>
the like. The flow path is usually between about 0.5 and 20 cm long,<br>
preferably between about 1 and 10 cm long and between about 0.001 and<br>
0.020 inches in diameter, preferably between about 0.003 and 0.015 inches<br>
to allow for a flow of between about 0.02 and 50 µl/day, usually 0.2 to 10<br>
µl/day and often 0.2 to 2.0 µl/day. Additionally, a catheter or other system<br>
may be attached to the end of the back-diffusion regulating outlet to provide<br>
for delivery of the active agent formulation at a site removed from the implant.<br>
Such systems are known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 3,732,865 and 4,340,054 which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Further, the flow path design may be useful in systems other than<br>
the fluid-imbibing devices specifically described herein.<br>
The inventive device configurations described above also allow for a<br>
minimal period of delay from start-up to steady-state flow rate. This is<br>
accomplished in part as a result of the configuration of the semipermeable<br>
plug 24 or 26. As water is imbibed by the semipermeable plug, it swells.<br>
Radial expansion is limited by the rigid reservoir 12, thus the expansion must<br>
occur linearly, thereby pushing against the water-swellable agent in chamber<br>
18, which in turn pushes against the piston 16. This allows pumping to<br><br>
commence prior to the time that water reaches the water-swellable agent<br>
which otherwise would be required before pumping could commence. To<br>
facilitate reliable start-up, the flow path 34 can be precharged with the active<br>
agent in chamber 18. Further, the geometry of the outlet 22 allows for initial<br>
delivery that is influenced by the concentration gradient of drug along the<br>
length of the outlet. The start-up period is less than about 25% of the<br>
predetermined delivery period and is often less than about 10% and usually<br>
less than about 5% of the predetermined delivery period. In a preferred<br>
embodiment for a one year system, at least 70% of the steady-state flow rate<br>
is achieved by day 14.<br>
The water-swellable agent formulation in chamber 20 is preferably a<br>
tissue tolerable formulation whose high osmotic pressure and high solubility<br>
propels the active agent over a long period of time while remaining in<br>
saturated solution in the water admitted by the semipermeable membrane.<br>
The water-swellable agent is preferably selected for tolerability by<br>
subcutaneous tissue, at least at pumping rates and hypothetically resulting<br>
concentrations to allow inadvertent dispensing from implanted devices left in<br>
the patient for a longer than labeled period. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
water-swellable agent should not diffuse or permeate through the<br>
semipermeable plug 24 or 26 to any appreciable amount (e.g., less than 8%)<br>
under normal operating conditions. Osmotic agents, such as NaCI with<br>
appropriate tabletting agents (lubricants and binders) and viscosity modifying<br>
agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose or sodium polyacrylate are<br>
preferred water-swellable agents. Other osmotic agents useful as the water-<br>
swellable agent include osmopolymers and osmagents and are described, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,413,572 which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein. The water-swellable agent formulation can be a slurry, a tablet, a<br>
molded or extruded material or other form known in the art. A liquid or gel<br>
additive or filler may be added to chamber 20 to exclude air from spaces<br>
around the osmotic engine. Exclusion of air from the devices should mean<br><br>
that delivery rates will be less affected by nominal external pressure changes<br>
(e.g., ±7 p.s.i. (±5 a.t.m.)).<br>
The devices of the invention are useful to deliver a wide variety of<br>
active agents. These agents include but are not limited to pharmacologically<br>
active peptides and proteins, genes and gene products, other gene therapy<br>
agents, and other small molecules. The polypeptides may include but are nol<br>
limited to growth hormone, somatotropin analogues, somatomedin-C,<br>
Gonadotropic releasing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing<br>
hormone, LHRH, LHRH analogues such as leuprolide, nafarelin and<br>
goserelin, LHRH agonists and antagonists, growth hormone releasing factor,<br>
calcitonin, colchicine, gonadotropins such as chorionic gonadotropin,<br>
oxytocin, octreotide, somatotropin plus an amino acid, vasopressin,<br>
adrenocorticotrophic hormone, epidermal growth factor, prolactin,<br>
somatostatin, somatotropin plus a protein, cosyntropin, lypressin,<br>
polypeptides such as thyrotropin releasing hormone, thyroid stimulation<br>
hormone, secretin, pancreozymin, enkephalin, glucagon, endocrine agents<br>
secreted internally and distributed by way of the bloodstream, and the like.<br>
Further agents that may be delivered include α1antitrypsin, factor VIII, factor<br>
IX and other coagulation factors, insulin and other peptide hormones, adrenal<br>
cortical stimulating hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone and other pituitary<br>
hormones, interferon α, β, and δ, erythropoietin, growth factors such as<br>
GCSF, GMCSF, insulin-like growth factor 1, tissue plasminogen activator,<br>
CD4, dDAVP, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor,<br>
pancreatic enzymes, lactase, cytokines, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist,<br>
interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor receptor, tumor suppresser proteins,<br>
cytotoxic proteins, and recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments, and<br>
the like.<br>
The above agents are useful for the treatment of a variety of conditions<br>
including but not limited to hemophilia and other blood disorders, growth<br>
disorders, diabetes, leukemia, hepatitis, renal failure, HIV infection, hereditary<br>
diseases such as cerbrosidase deficiency and adenosine deaminase<br><br>
deficiency, hypertension, septic shock, autoimmune diseases such as<br>
multiple sclerosis, Graves disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, shock and wasting disorders, cystic fibrosis, lactose<br>
intolerance, Crohn's diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal<br>
and other cancers.<br>
The active agents may be anhydrous or aqueous solutions,<br>
suspensions or complexes with pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or<br>
carriers such that a flowable formulation is produced that may be stored for<br>
long periods on the shelf or under refrigeration, as well as stored in an<br>
implanted delivery system. The formulations may include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers and additional inert ingredients. The active agents may<br>
be in various forms, such as uncharged molecules, components of molecular<br>
complexes or pharmacologically acceptable salts. Also, simple derivatives of<br>
the agents (such as prodrugs, ethers, esters, amides, etc.) which are easily<br>
hydrolyzed by body pH, enzymes, etc., can be employed.<br>
It is to be understood that more than one active agent may be<br>
incorporated into the active agent formulation in a device of this invention and<br>
that the use of the term "agent" in no way excludes the use of two or more<br>
such agents. The dispensing devices of the invention find use, for example,<br>
in humans or other animals. The environment of use is a fluid environment<br>
and can comprise any subcutaneous position or body cavity, such as the<br>
peritoneum or uterus, and may or may not be equivalent to the point of<br>
ultimate delivery of the active agent formulation. A single dispensing device<br>
or several dispensing devices can be administered to a subject during a<br>
therapeutic program. The devices are designed to remain implanted during a<br>
predetermined administration period. If the devices are not removed following<br>
the administration, they may be designed to withstand the maximum osmotic<br>
pressure of the water-swellable agent or they may be designed with a bypass<br>
to release the pressure generated within the device.<br>
The devices of the present invention are preferably rendered sterile<br>
prior to use, especially when such use is implantation. This may be<br><br>
accomplished by separately sterilizing each component, e.g., by gamma<br>
radiation, steam sterilization or sterile filtration, then aseptically assembling<br>
the final system. Alternatively, the devices may be assembled, then<br>
terminally sterilized using any appropriate method.<br>
Preparation of the Devices of the Invention<br>
Reservoir 12 is prepared preferably by machining a metal rod or by<br>
extrusion or injection molding a polymer. The top portion of the reservoir may<br>
be open as shown in Fig. 1 or may contain a cavity as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Where the reservoir 12 is open as shown in Fig. 1, a water-swellable<br>
semipermeable plug 24 is inserted mechanically from the outside of the<br>
reservoir without using an adhesive before or after insertion of the piston and<br>
water-swellable agent formulation. Reservoir 12 may be provided with<br>
grooves or threads which engage ribs or threads on plug 24.<br>
Where the reservoir 12 contains a cavity as shown in Fig. 2, the cavity<br>
may be cylindrical in shape, as shown in Fig. 5, it may be stepped, as shown<br>
in Fig. 6, it may be helical, as shown in Fig. 7 or it may be in a spaced<br>
configuration, as shown in Fig. 8. The semipermeable plug 26 is then<br>
injected, inserted, or otherwise assembled into the cavity so that it forms a<br>
seal with the reservoir wall.<br>
Following insertion of the plug 26 either mechanically, by welding or by<br>
injection, the water-swellable agent is assembled into the reservoir followed<br>
by insertion of the piston, with appropriate steps taken to vent entrapped air.<br>
The active agent is filled into the device using a syringe or a precision<br>
dispensing pump. The diffusion moderator is inserted into the device, usually<br>
by a rotating or helical action, or by axial pressing.<br>
The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. They<br>
are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Variations and<br>
equivalents of these examples will be apparent to those of skill in the art in<br>
light of the present disclosure, the drawings and claims herein.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of a Device with an HDPE Reservoir<br>
A system containing leuprolide acetate for the treatment of prostate<br>
cancer was assembled from the following components:<br>
Reservoir (HDPE) (5 mm outside diameter, 3 mm inside diameter)<br>
Piston (Santoprene®)<br>
Lubricant (silicone medical fluid)<br>
Compressed osmotic engine (60% NaCI, 40% sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose)<br>
Membrane plug (Hytrel polyether-ester block copolymer, injection<br>
molded to desired shape)<br>
Back diffusion Regulating Outlet (polycarbonate)<br>
Active agent (0.78g of 60% propylene glycol and 40% leuprolide<br>
acetate)<br>
Assembly<br>
The piston and inner diameter of the reservoir were lightly lubricated<br>
with silicon medical fluid. The piston 16 was inserted into the open end of<br>
chamber 20. Two osmotic engine tablets (40 mg each) were then inserted on<br>
top of piston 16. After insertion, the osmotic engine was flush with the end of<br>
the reservoir. The membrane plug 24 was inserted by lining up the plug with<br>
the reservoir and pushing gently until the plug was fully engaged in the<br>
reservoir. Active agent was loaded into a syringe which was then used to fill<br>
chamber 18 from its open end by injecting the material into the open tube until<br>
the formulation was ~3 mm from the end. The filled reservoir was centrifuged<br>
(outlet end "up") to remove any air bubbles that have been trapped in the<br>
formulation during filling. The outlet 22 was screwed into the open end of the<br>
reservoir until completely engaged. As the outlet was screwed in, excess<br>
formulation exited out of the orifice ensuring a uniform fill.<br><br>
Example 2 - Insertion of the Device of Example 1<br>
Insertion of the device of Example 1 is done under aseptic conditions<br>
using a trocar similar to that used in the implantation of Norplant®<br>
contraceptive implants to position the device under the skin. The insertion<br>
area is typically in the inside of the upper arm, 8 to 10 cm above the elbow.<br>
The area is anesthetized and an incision is made through the skin.<br>
The incision is approximately 4 mm long. The trocar is inserted into the<br>
incision until the tip of the trocar is at a distance of 4 to 6 cm from the incision.<br>
The obturator is then removed from the trocar and the device of Example 1<br>
inserted into the trocar. The device is then advanced to the open end of the<br>
trocar using the obturator. The obturator is then held in position, thus<br>
immobilizing the device of Example 1 while the trocar is withdrawn over both<br>
the device and the obturator. The obturator is then removed, leaving the<br>
implant behind in a well-controlled position. The edges of the incision are<br>
then secured with a skin closure. The area is covered and kept dry for 2 to 3<br>
days.<br>
Example 3 - Removal of the Device of Example 1<br>
The device of Example 1 is removed as follows: The device is located<br>
by fingertip palpation of the upper arm area. The area at one end of the<br>
implant is then anesthetized and an approximately 4 mm, perpendicular<br>
incision is made through the skin and any fibrous capsule tissue surrounding<br>
the implant area. The end of the device opposite the incision is pushed so<br>
that the device end proximal to the incision is urged out of the incision. Any<br>
further fibrotic tissue is cut with a scalpel. Following removal, the procedure<br>
of Example 2 can be followed to insert a new device.<br><br>
Example 4 - Delivery Rate of the Device of Example 1<br>
Glass test tubes were filled with 35 ml distilled water and then placed<br>
in a 37°C water bath. A single device as described in Example 1 was placed<br>
in each test tube and the test tubes were changed periodically. The delivery<br>
rate profile from the system is shown in Fig. 9. The system does not have<br>
any start-up time because the system exhibits a period of initial high release<br>
followed by a lower steady state release for a period of 200 days.<br>
Example 5 - Delivery Rate Profiles<br>
Glass test tubes were filled with 35 ml distilled water which were then<br>
placed in a 37°C water bath. After the test tubes had come up to<br>
temperature, a single device as described in Example 1, but with membrane<br>
materials described below and containing 1% FD&amp;C blue dye in water as the<br>
drug formulation, was placed in each tube. Water from the test tube<br>
permeated through the membrane causing the system to pump formulation<br>
(blue dye) into the surrounding water in the test tube. At regular intervals,<br>
systems were switched to fresh test tubes. The amount of dye released was<br>
determined by measuring the concentration of blue dye in each test tube<br>
using a spectrophotometer. The pumping rate was calculated from the total<br>
dye released, the volume of water in the tube, the initial concentration of dye<br>
and the interval over which the system was in the test tube. Results for two<br>
different tests are shown in Figures 10 and 11. Figure 10 shows 3 different<br>
systems with different plug materials (Hytrel® 2, 3 and 12 month systems) and<br>
Figure 11 shows 4 systems with different plug materials. These materials are:<br>
Membrane	Material<br>
1	month	Pebax 25 (Polyamide)<br>
2	month	Pebax 22 (Polyamide)<br>
3	month	Polyurethane (HP60D)<br>
12 month Pebax 24 (Polyamide)<br><br>
The systems were capable of delivering for a period of from 2 to 12<br>
months, depending on the membrane used.<br>
Example 6 - Preparation of a Delivery Device with a Titanium Reservoir<br>
A system containing leuprolide acetate for the treatment of prostate<br>
cancer was assembled from the following components:<br>
Reservoir (Titanium, Ti6AI4V alloy ) (4 mm outside diameter, 3 mm<br>
inside diameter)<br>
Piston (C-Flex®)<br>
Lubricant (silicone medical fluid)<br>
Compressed osmotic engine (76.4% NaCI, 15.5% sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, 6% povidone, 0.5% Mg Stearate, 1.6%<br>
water)<br>
PEG 400 (8 mg added to osmotic engine to fill air spaces)<br>
Membrane plug (polyurethane polymer, injection molded to desired<br>
shape)<br>
Back diffusion Regulating Outlet (polyethylene)<br>
Drug formulation (0.150g of 60% water and 40% leuprolide acetate)<br>
Assembly<br>
The piston and inner diameter of the reservoir were lightly lubricated.<br>
The piston was inserted ~0.5 cm into the reservoir at the membrane end.<br>
PEG 400 was added into the reservoir. Two osmotic engine tablets (40 mg<br>
each) were then inserted into the reservoir from the membrane end. After<br>
insertion, the osmotic engine was flush with the end of the reservoir. The<br>
membrane plug was inserted by lining up the plug with the reservoir and<br>
pushing gently until the retaining features of the plug were fully engaged in<br>
the reservoir. Formulation was loaded into a syringe which was then used to<br>
fill the reservoir from the outlet end by injecting formulation into the open tube<br>
until the formulation was ~3 mm from the end. The filled reservoir was<br>
centrifuged (outlet end "up") to remove any air bubbles that have been<br><br>
trapped in the formulation during filling. The outlet was screwed into the open<br>
end of the reservoir until completely engaged. As the outlet was screwed in,<br>
excess formulation exited out of the orifice ensuring a uniform fill.<br>
Example 7 - Preparation of a Leuprolide Acetate Delivery Device with a<br>
Titanium Reservoir<br>
A system containing leuprolide acetate for the treatment of prostate<br>
cancer was assembled from the following components:<br>
Reservoir (Titanium Ti6AI4V alloy) (4 mm outside diameter, 3 mm<br>
inside diameter, 4.5 cm length)<br>
Piston (C-Flex® TPE elastomer, available from Consolidated Polymer<br>
Technologies, Inc.)<br>
Lubricant (silicone medical fluid 360)<br>
Compressed osmotic engine tablet (76.4% NaCI, 15.5% sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, 6% povidone, 0.5% Mg Stearate, 1.5%<br>
water, 50 mg total)<br>
PEG 400 (8 mg added to osmotic engine to fill air spaces)<br>
Membrane plug (polyurethane polymer 20% water uptake, injection<br>
molded to desired shape 3 mm diameter X 4 mm length)<br>
Back-diffusion Regulating Outlet (polyethylene, with 6 mil X 5 cm<br>
channel)<br>
Drug formulation (leuprolide acetate dissolved in DMSO to a measured<br>
content of 65 mg leuprolide)<br>
Assembly<br>
Systems were assembled as in Example 6, using aseptic procedures<br>
to assemble y-irradiated subassemblies and filled aseptically with sterile<br>
filtered leuprolide DMSO formulation.<br>
Release Rate<br>
These systems delivered about 0.35 µL/day leuprolide formulation<br>
containing on average 150 µg leuprolide in the amount delivered per day.<br><br>
They provide delivery of leuprolide at this rate for at least one year. The<br>
systems achieved approximately 70% steady-state delivery by day 14.<br>
Implantation and Removal<br>
Systems will be implanted under local anesthetic and by means of an<br>
incision and trocar as in Example 2 to patient suffering from advanced<br>
prostatic cancer.<br>
After one year, systems will be removed under local anesthetic as<br>
described in Example 3. New systems may be inserted at that time.<br>
Example 8 - Treatment of Prostatic Cancer<br>
Leuprolide acetate, an LHRH agonist, acts as a potent inhibitor of<br>
gonadotropin secretion when given continuously and in therapeutic doses.<br>
Animal and human studies indicate that following an initial stimulation, chronic<br>
administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of testicular<br>
steroidogenesis. This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug<br>
therapy. Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the<br>
growth of certain hormone-dependent tumors (prostatic tumors in Noble and<br>
Dunning male rats and DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female rats) as<br>
well as atrophy of the reproductive organs. In humans, administration of<br>
leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of<br>
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a<br>
transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and<br>
dihydrotestosterone in males). However, continuous administration of<br>
leuprolide acetate results in decreased level of LH and FSH. In males,<br>
testosterone is reduced to castrate levels. These decreases occur within two<br>
to six weeks after initiation of treatment, and castrate levels of testosterone in<br>
prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for multiyear periods.<br>
Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally.<br><br>
Systems will be prepared as in Example 7, then inserted as described.<br>
The continuous administration of leuprolide for one year using these systems<br>
will reduce testosterone to castrate levels.<br>
The above description has been given for ease of understanding only.<br>
No unnecessary limitations should be understood therefrom, as modifications<br>
will be obvious to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
