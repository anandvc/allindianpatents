				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of lithium chromium manganate (LiCrMnO4 ) useful as brttery cathode material for lithium ion cells. This invention relates to a novel wet grinding procedure for the preparation of lithium chromium manganate (LiCrMnO4) battery cathode material  for rocking chair or lithium ion cells. A novel method of preparing LiCrMnO4 was developed by uniform mixing of carbonates of   lithium and manganese with chromic acid   or nitrate of lithium and manganese with ammonium chromate of an   appropriate composition  and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of   glycerol and the paste was subjected to heating followed by annealing.<br>
The present invention, describes the method of synthesis of the cathode material viz. LiCrMnCU for a secondary battery, by heating a paste prepared by mixing fine particles of carbonates of lithium and manganese with chromic acid in glycerol to made into a paste. This paste was initially heated slowly in a furnace to evaporate off glycerol in order to get a dried mass at 250CC . This dried mass was then continuously heated in between 500- 800°C for 12 hrs. The product formed was slowly cooled to room temperature and was ground well and then examined for its particles size, colour and XRD exposure for purity and structure. It was found that the prepared sample was black in colour and was homogeneous. X- ray analysis confirmed the formation of LiCrMnO4 according to Fig 1.<br>
The compound, lithium chromium manganate (LiCrMnC4) is a spinel structured compound which has a property to intercalate small cations like lithium and hence this material when used as a cathode in an electrochemical energy device, it gives high voltage and can be charged &amp; discharged with lithium ions. Thus LiCrMnO4 cathode material behaves like a secondary cell with high energy density.<br>
Lithium chromium manganate as a cathode material for intercalation purposes on lithium ion batteries is of recent origin and a few methods are available to prepare this compound. This compound on intercalation as a cathode in conjection with a suitable cathode shows voltages as high as 4.6 and above. Such a cell of high voltage is expected to give high energy density batteries. Hence , the synthesis of this compound by a simple method will be useful to prepare cathode easily and cheaply.<br>
Reference may be made to prepare spinel LiCrMnO4 compound is known from the recent literature cited in 1995 as a battery cathode for high voltage lithium cells. This compound was prepared by mixing Li2Co3, Cr2O3 and MnCO3 together and was fired in air initially at 750°C for 24hrs and was subjected to two successive and identical grinding and annealing treatments. [C.Sigala, D.Guyomard and M. Tournoux, Solid State Ionics, 81(1995) 167].<br>
As available in literature LiCrxMn2-xO4 can be alternatively prepared by two methods. In the first method, Li2CO3, Cr2O3and P- Mno2   powders were ground well, and heated in flow of argon gas at 600°C for 3hrs and then heated at 1000°C for three days. In the second method , LiCrO2 and LiMnO2 were used as the starting materials and the        pelletized    samples    were    reacted    at    1000° [ I..I.Davidson. R.S.Mc Millan and J.J.Murray, J. Power Sources, 54 (1995) 205] In the above mentioned methods any one of the following disadvantages are observed. Phase purity Intermittent heating<br>
Long duration of heating &amp; annealing. Several steps etc.<br>
A novel method of preparing LiCrMnO2  was developed by uniform mixing of carbonates of lithium and manganese with chromic acid of an appropriate composition ratio and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of glycerol and the paste was subjected to heating &amp; finally annealing.<br>
The present invention, describes the method of synthesis of the cathode material for a secondary battery, by heating a paste prepared by mixing fine particles of carbonates of lithium and manganese with chromic acid in glycerol to made into a paste and this paste was initially heated slowly in a furnace to evaporate off glycerol in order to get a dried mass at 250°C and this dried mass was then continuously heated to 500-600°C for 8- 12 hrs and the product formed was slowly cooled to room temperature and was ground well and then it was examined for its particles size, colour and X-ray exposure for purity and structure. It was found that the prepared sample was black in<br>
colour   and was homogeneous. X- ray analysis confirmed the formation of LiCrMnO2 according to Fig 1.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a to a process for the preparation of lithium chromium manganate (LiCrMnO2  ) useful as battery cathode material for lithium ion cells which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare lithium chromium manganate by wet grinding method or paste procedure.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare lithium chromium manganate by mixing equimolar proportion of LiCOs ,CrO3 and MnCO3.<br>
One of the object is to prepare the product LiCrMnO4 by using LiNO3, ammonium chromate and manganese nitrate in equal ratio.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to prepare lithium chromium manganate by a single step procedure<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare lithium chromium manganate   with different fuels which have no influence on the product quality, particle size or performance. Still, yet another object of this invention is to prepare lithium chromium manganate with glycerol which has no influence on the quality, colour or nature of the product even if used in excess.<br>
A novel method of preparing LiCrMnO4  was developed by uniform mixing of carbonates of lithium and manganese with chromic acid of an appropriate composition ratio and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of glycerol and the paste was subjected to heating.<br>
Accordingly the present invention to a process for the preparation of lithium chromium manganate (LiCrMnO4 ) for battery cathode material for lithium ion cells which comprises : preparing a paste by mixing equimolar quantity of (1) lithium salt selected from lithium carbonate, lithium nitrate, (2) chromium source selected from ammonium chromate, chromic acid and (3) manganese salt selected from manganese nitrate and manganese carbonate along with the flux and binding agent followed by heating the above said paste material at a temperature in the range of 250 - 800 ° C for a period of 6 to 12 hrs. to give LiCrMnO4.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention Li2CO3, CrO3 and MnCO3 was used in equimolar proportion.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention glycerol was used as a binding agent for uniform reaction.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the flux used may be selected from urea glycine, citric acid and ammonium formate.<br>
In a feature of the invention the use of flux has no influence on the product quality, purity or colour.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention is a single step process, since chromic acid is used, the decomposition of salts like Li2CO3 and MnCO3 is easy and hence the purity of the product is high.<br>
Pure lithium carbonate, chromic acid and manganese carbonate were taken in equimolar proportions and were ground well in a pestle and mortor arrangement and to this ground mixture 3-5 mi of glyceroi and 5-10 gm of urea were added and the whole mass was made into a paste. This paste was transferred into a silica / porcelain crucible and then kept in a muffle furnace. The furnace was heated initially to 250°C for an hour to dry the paste and has subsequently heated to 600°C for 12 hours constantly. The product was cooled and ground well and the product was analysed by x-ray for identification.The product was black in colour.<br>
