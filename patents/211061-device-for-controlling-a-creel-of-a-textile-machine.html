				<td>Device for Controlling a Creel of a Textile Machine<br>
The invention relates to a device for controlling a creel of a textile machine,<br>
which is seated, pivotable to a limited degree, by means of a pivot shaft<br>
and can be loaded with a torque generator which, controlled by a drive<br>
mechanism, generates a defined torque.<br>
A device in accordance with the species for controlling a creel of a textile<br>
machine is described in DE 198 17 363 A1, for example.<br>
With this known device a bobbin held in a creel is driven by a roller by<br>
means of friction. It is intended here to provide an exactly predetermined<br>
bobbin contact pressure between the driving roller and the bobbin, which<br>
can be controlled in order to be able, for example, to set a defined slippage<br>
between the bobbin and the roller.<br>
Therefore the creel is seated, rotatable to a limited degree by means of a<br>
pivot shaft, wherein a connecting disk is connected, fixed against relative<br>
rotation, with the pivot shaft.<br>
Moreover, the connecting disk is connected by means of helical springs<br>
with a gear wheel in such a way that a rotation of the gear wheel by means<br>
of a drive motor, in particular a step motor, generates a torque acting on<br>
the connecting disk and therefore on the pivot shaft. In order to be able to<br>
introduce a sufficiently large torque into the pivot shaft, a total of six<br>
helical springs, which are arranged tangentially in respect to the pivot<br>
shaft, are provided between the gear wheel and the connecting disk.<br>
Based on the above mentioned prior art, the object of the invention is<br>
based on providing a device for the defined control of a creel, which is<br>
particularly effective and at the same time cost-effective and simple in<br>
construction,<br>
This object is attained in accordance with the invention in that the torque generator is<br>
connected with the creel by means of a reduction gear stage.<br>
This means that because of the employment of a eduction gear stage it is possible to<br>
design the torque generator relatively low-powered and simply. The high torque required for<br>
the defined control of the creel is nevertheless assuredly provided.<br>
As described hereinafter the torque generator advantageously has a flat spiral spring.<br>
By using a flat spiral spring it is possible to achieve a very simple, cost-effective<br>
construction of the entire device. For this purpose, one end of the flat spiral spring is fastened<br>
on a first element of the torque generator, which is displaced by the drive element. The other<br>
end of the flat spiral spring is connected with a second element, which is coupled with the<br>
gear. The flat spiral spring generates a defined force by the rotation of the first element in<br>
respect to the second element, which can be adjusted within wide margins since, because of<br>
its type of construction, the flat spiral spring can be rotated over a large angle, and this force<br>
is converted into torque.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the gear stage is embodied as a<br>
ribbon gear as desribed hereinafter. A generation of the torque free of play at the pivot shaft<br>
can be achieved with the aid ofa ribbon gear. This is advantageous in view of the exact<br>
control of the creel, and therefore in view of an exactly set bobbin contact pressure.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the torque generator can also be directly connected with<br>
a drive shaft of the drive element, which results in a direct control of the torque generator by<br>
means of the drive element. The numver of required components is reduced by this.<br>
As described hereinafter, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention that a further gear stage is arranged between the drive element and the torque<br>
generator. Thus, the torque generator is arranged between two gears, or between two gear<br>
stages, which results in an extremely flexible design of the device in accordance with the<br>
invention. For example, a low-powered and cost-effective step motor can be used as the drive<br>
motor.<br>
Further characteristic and advantages of the invention ensue from the subsequent<br>
description together with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Shown in the drawings are in:<br>
Fig. 1, a schematic representation of a lateral view of a device in accordance with the<br>
invention for controlling a creel in accordance with a first embodiment.<br>
Fig. 2, a schematic front view of the device in Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3, a lateral view of a ribbon drive in accordan :e with a second embodiment of the<br>
invention, and<br>
Fig. 4, a view from above on a ribbon drive in accordance with Fig. 3.<br>
A winding head housing 10 of a textile machine can be seen in the schematic<br>
representations in Figs. 1 and 2, on which a creel 12 is seated, rotatable in a limited manner,<br>
by means of a pivot shaft 14. A bobbin 16 is rotatably seated in the creel 12, which is driven<br>
by frictional force by a roller 18. In order to provided a predefined contact pressure of the<br>
bobbin 16 on nhe roller 18, the pivot shaft 14 of the creel 12 is charged with a defined,<br>
adjustable torque which, as a rule, acts by reducing the lo d on the creel 12.<br>
Such a predefined even contact pressure is very important in connection with<br>
producing cheeses, since otherwise not only the outer appearance of the bobbins, but also<br>
their unwinding behaviors, are negatively affected.<br>
However, in areas of pattern disruption, the introduction of a defined<br>
slippage between the bobbin 16 and the roller 18 is desirable, for which<br>
purpose the torque acting on the creel 12 is increased and the contact<br>
pressure of the bobbin 16 on the ribbon 18 is definitely reduced by this.<br>
As represented in the drawings, one end of the pivot shaft 14 is connected<br>
with the creel 12, and the other end with a gear wheel 20 of a reduction<br>
gear stage in a manner fixed against relative rotation. The gear wheel 20<br>
meshes with a pinion 22, which is connected, fixed against relative<br>
rotation, with a stop plate 24 and is rotatably seated on an axle stub 26.<br>
In turn, the axle stub 26 is fastened on the winding head housing 10 of<br>
the textile machine. A flat spiral spring 28 is fastened with one of its ends<br>
on the stop plate 24, and its other end is connected with an adjustment<br>
gear wheel 30, which meshes with a motor pinion 32 of an electric step<br>
motor 34.<br>
The flat spiral spring 28 is fastened on the adjustment gear wheel 30 with<br>
the aid of three fastening bolts 36, 38, 40, for example. One end of the flat<br>
spiral spring 28 is clamped between the bolts 36, 38, 40 for this purpose,<br>
and is fixed in this portion by its inherent prestress. The other end of the<br>
flat spiral spring 28 is fastened on the stop plate 24 with two bolts 42 and<br>
44.<br>
If the adjustment gear wheel 30 is rotated in respect to the stop plate 24,<br>
the flat spiral 28 is prestressed or relaxed, and because of this it generates<br>
a force acting on the stop plate 24, which is converted to a torque acting<br>
on the creel 12 via the pinion 22, the gear wheel 20 and the pivot shaft 14<br>
A relative rotation between the adjustment gear wheel 30 and the plate 24<br>
is limited by the bolt 40, so that two end positions of the stop plate 24 are<br>
defined. A first end position is defined by the striking of a first edge 46 of a<br>
first radially<br>
extending protrusion of the stop plate 24 against the bolt 40. A second end<br>
position is defined by the striking of a second edge 48 of a second<br>
protrusion of the stop plate, which starting at the axle stub 26, extends<br>
way in a direction opposite to the first protrusion, against the bolt 40. The<br>
force, which can be minimally or maximally generated by the flat spiral 28,<br>
and the minimal, or maximal, torque are fixed by these two end positions.<br>
For controlling the creel 12, and therefore the contact pressure of the<br>
bobbin 16 on the roller 18, the motor pinion 32 is displaced by the step<br>
motor 34 by a defined number of steps in a desired direction. This causes<br>
a rotation of the adjustment gear wheel 30, and therefore the prestressing<br>
or relaxation of the flat spiral spring 28. The force generated by the flat<br>
spiral spring 28 changes because of the prestressing or relaxation of the<br>
flat spiral spring 28 and is transmitted via the bolts 42, 44 to the stop<br>
plate 24 and the pinion 22 connected with the latter in a manner fixed<br>
against relative rotation. The force generated by the flat spiral spring 28 is<br>
converted into a torque by the pinion 22, which meshes with the larger<br>
gear wheel 20, which torque acts on the pivot shaft 14 and in this way<br>
decreases or increases the contact pressure of the bobbin 16 on the roller<br>
18.<br>
Because the pinion 22 and the gear wheel 20 constitute a reduction gear<br>
stage, a relatively weak force of the flat spiral spring 28 suffices for<br>
generating a relatively large torque at the pivot shaft 14. Therefore the flat<br>
spiral spring 28 can be designed to be comparatively weal and cost-<br>
effective.<br>
In an alternative embodiment (not represented) it is provided that the<br>
torque generator is arranged in the area of a second reduction gear stage<br>
consisting of the motor pinion 32 and the adjustment gear wheel 30. It is<br>
possible in this way to generate a large torque at the pivot shaft 14 even<br>
with a weak and<br>
cost-effective step motor 34. However, the required prestress of the flat<br>
spiral spring 28 can only be achieved by tolerating a relatively large<br>
displacement track in this case.<br>
For providing a clearer representation, the creel arm 12, the bobbin 16<br>
and the roller 18 are not represented in Fig. 2.<br>
As can be seen from the representation in Fig. 2, a torque generator is<br>
constituted in the embodiment represented by the adjustment gear wheel<br>
30 with the bolts 36, 38 and 40, the flat spiral spring 28 the wing plate 24<br>
with the bolts 42 and 44, as well as the pinion 22.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 schematically shown as ribbon drive employed in a further<br>
embodiment of the invention. Here, a pivot shaft 51 is only indicated by a<br>
dash-dotted line in Fig. 4.<br>
A transfer lever 52 is connected, fixed against relative rotation, with the<br>
pivot shaft 51 and has a cylinder section 54 which is centered in respect to<br>
the pivot shaft 51. A ribbon 60 or 62 is respectively fastened at the<br>
attachment points 56 and 58 of the cylinder section 54. The ribbons 60<br>
and 62, which are preferably made of steel, extend from the cylinder<br>
section 54 to a driveshaft 64, which is connected with a torque generator,<br>
wherein both ribbons 60 and 62 are spirally wound on the driveshaft 64.<br>
The attachment points 56 and 58 on the cylinder section 54 are located on<br>
opposite sides in relation to the driveshaft 64, on which the ribbon 60, or<br>
the ribbon 62, are fastened at the attachment point 66, or 68.<br>
This means that a rotation of the driveshaft 64 causes a winding and<br>
unwinding movement of the ribbons 60, 62 which is converted into a pivot<br>
movement of the transfer lever 52, and therefore of the creel.<br>
To the greatest extent the ribbon drive represented in Figs 3 and 4 without<br>
play and hysteresis.<br>
