				<td>SOL-GEL PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF MOULDS FOR<br>
PHOTOCATALYTIC PROCESSES<br>
This invention relates to a sol-gel process for the<br>
manufacture of moulds suitable for the formation of<br>
materials using photocatalysis processes.<br>
This invention also relates to a pultrusion process, an<br>
extrusion process and a moulding process in which a<br>
mould manufactured in accordance with the<br>
abovementioned method is provided.<br>
In particular the invention lies in the field of the<br>
processing of various materials, including composite<br>
materials and silicones, and pultrusion, extrusion and<br>
moulding processes are of particular interest in that<br>
sector.<br>
As is known, composite materials (or reinforced<br>
plastics) are obtained through the combination of a<br>
thermohardening resin, such as polyesters or epoxides,<br>
with a reinforcement based on glass fibre, carbon<br>
fibre, fabric or other material. This association<br>
imparts particular mechanical strength properties to<br>
the material which can be utilized in a wide range of<br>
industrial sectors.<br>
As far as silicones are concerned, these are<br>
organosilicon compounds comprising polymers based on a<br>
silicon-oxygen chain and organic functional groups<br>
linked to the silicon atoms; their special feature is<br>
that they are particularly resistant to temperature,<br>
chemical attack and oxidation, and are excellent<br>
electrical insulators. Silicones may be subdivided into<br>
various application classes, including liquids,<br><br>
emulsions, lubricants, resins, elastomers.	They<br>
obviously have very wide application extending	from<br>
adhesives to lubricants, insulating agents	and<br>
prostheses.<br>
It is known that in the main industrial processes, and<br>
in particular in the processes of pultrusion (for<br>
composite materials), extrusion and moulding, both<br>
composite materials and silicones undergo a cross-<br>
linking treatment known as polymerization which<br>
generally takes place through thermal means, in<br>
particular by placing the material in contact with a<br>
heated mould in which it undergoes polymerization and<br>
plastic deformation and in which it takes up the final<br>
or semi-final shape of the end product.<br>
In the known art moulds are generally made of metal,<br>
because they have to withstand high mechanical loads as<br>
a result of the plastic deformation stresses on the<br>
material being formed, and thermal loads due to the<br>
repeated thermal polymerization cycles which they<br>
perform.<br>
Moulds of this type are disadvantageously characterized<br>
by a particularly high mass; as a conseguence of this<br>
moulds made of metal create more than insignificant<br>
logistical difficulties.<br>
Furthermore, the manufacture of moulds from metal<br>
requires mechanical finishing machining of the rough<br>
piece downstream from the operation of casting or<br>
plastically deforming the piece in order to obtain a<br>
mould which is consistent with a desired shape.<br>
Mechanical machining of the mould takes place through<br>
the removal of swarf, generally by milling, or, in some<br>
cases, by turning or other machining, and is as a<br>
result very costly in that it requires complex<br>
equipment, particularly when moulds of large size are<br>
being machined.<br><br>
As a result the manufacture of metal moulds has the<br>
further disadvantage that it requires rather long<br>
machining times; this is another factor having an<br>
adverse effect on the costs of manufacture of such<br>
moulds, which also reflects the various disadvantages<br>
affecting moulds made of metal.<br>
As mentioned previously, there are various processes in<br>
industry in which the use of moulds is required;<br>
specifically the processes of pultrusion, extrusion and<br>
moulding will also be described below with reference to<br>
the equipment used. These processes, which are known,<br>
constitute the main but not the only methods of<br>
producing and forming composite and silicone materials<br>
in accordance with processes according to this<br>
invention.<br>
Pultrusion is an operation used to manufacture<br>
composite materials and is the production process<br>
normally used in the production of pipes, articles<br>
having a hollow cross section and various sections, in<br>
which continuous layers of reinforced fibre are<br>
impregnated with catalysed resin and then caused to<br>
pass through a heated metal mask using an appropriate<br>
machine which "draws" the composite material. A<br>
continuous line of product which can then be cut and<br>
dispatched for subsequent processing is obtained in<br>
this way.<br>
The extrusion process on the other hand consists of<br>
feeding the material which has to be shaped, for<br>
example a silicone, which is then thrust, for example<br>
by means of a piston or continuous thrust means<br>
comprising for example rotating screws, through a die<br>
having a shape which reproduces the cross section of<br>
the required section. Again in this case a continuous<br>
line of generally semi-finished product which is then<br>
sent to stations for subsequent processing is produced.<br><br>
Moulding on the other hand consists of placing the<br>
material which has to be moulded, for example a<br>
silicone, in a mould forcing it to fill it and adopt<br>
its shape. The material may for example be injected<br>
into the mould while it is in the liquid state. Heating<br>
of the mould takes place in parallel with<br>
polymerization of the material.<br>
In each of these processes polymerization takes place<br>
through a thermal effect and requires a very precise<br>
time, which can in some cases be excessive. This has an<br>
adverse effect in terms of low productivity and<br>
relatively high production costs.<br>
As an alternative to the processes of thermohardening<br>
plastics material described, photocatalytic processes<br>
for achieving polymerization and, if appropriate,<br>
cross-linking of the same, with acceptable results, are<br>
known, at least at laboratory level.<br>
Unfortunately these processes have not become<br>
industrially established because of intrinsic<br>
difficulties with the processes themselves. For<br>
example, in a photocatalytic process one appreciable<br>
difficulty is the nature of the mould, which must have<br>
appreciable optical transparency, and mechanical and<br>
thermomechanical strength properties. Not to mention a<br>
shape appropriate for the purpose, which might require<br>
appreciable sophistication.<br>
In this situation the technical task underlying this<br>
invention is to provide a process for the manufacture<br>
of moulds which are capable of overcoming the<br>
abovementioned disadvantages.<br>
In the context of this technical task it is an<br>
important object of the invention to provide a process<br>
for the manufacture of moulds which makes it possible<br><br>
to reduce process times and as a consequence to<br>
increase productivity, even substantially, in<br>
particular in processes of pultrusion, extrusion and<br>
moulding using such moulds, achieving the effect of<br>
reducing production costs.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process<br>
for the manufacture of moulds of smaller mass than<br>
conventional metal moulds, while maintaining good<br>
mechanical and thermal strength.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process<br>
for the manufacture of moulds which eliminates, or at<br>
least reduces as far as possible, the need to carry out<br>
mechanical machining on the moulds obtained and<br>
therefore which reduces the production costs for the<br>
moulds themselves.<br>
The technical task specified and the objects specified<br>
are substantially achieved through a sol-gel process<br>
for the manufacture of moulds having at least one<br>
portion transparent to UV rays according to one or more<br>

A description of a preferred embodiment of a sol-gel<br>

one portion transparent to UV rays is described below<br>

with the appended drawings in which:<br>

A preferred embodiment of a sol-gel process for the<br>
manufacture of moulds having at least one portion<br>
transparent to UV rays according to the invention<br>
comprises the following stages:<br>
a)	providing a container 1 having the negative shape<br>
with at least one transparent portion 2a of the<br>
mould 2 which is to be manufactured and internally<br>
defining a chamber 3,<br>
b)	filling chamber 3 with a colloidal suspension<br>
(sol),<br>
c)	effecting gelling of the sol, obtaining the so-<br>
called gel,<br><br>
d)	heating the gel and a corresponding solvent in an<br>
autoclave for a programmed period of time<br>
consequently reaching predetermined temperature<br>
and pressure values substantially higher than the<br>
critical values for the solvent, and extrusion of<br>
that solvent giving rise to drying of the gel,<br>
e)	densification and/or sintering of the dried gel by<br>
heating to a predetermined temperature, preferably<br>
higher than the temperature specified in stage d),<br>
with the consequent formation of a vitreous body<br>
transparent to at least UV rays.<br>
The colloidal suspension (sol) in stage b) is prepared<br>
in a preceding stage a') by mixing one or more<br>
precursors containing metal alkoxides with a solvent.<br>
This solvent may be water or a water/alcohol mixture,<br>
and gives rise to an aqueous or water/alcohol<br>
suspension respectively.<br>
Preferably, also, the metal in each precursor is an<br>
element belonging to groups 3, 4, 5 of the Periodic<br>
system. The metals generally used for the formation of<br>
a precursor are silicon and, sometimes, aluminium.<br>
In order to be able to carry out stage b) it is also<br>
necessary that hydrolysis of the suspension produced in<br>
stage a') be carried out in a further preceding stage<br>
a'), yielding the sol. This is generally achieved by<br>
the addition of an acid or basic catalyst to the<br>
suspension. This catalyst is preferably an aqueous<br>
solution of hydrochloric acid.<br>
It should also be added that once hydrolysis is<br>
complete, before starting gelling, it is possible to<br>
add a colloidal suspension of an oxide of a metal<br>
present in a precursor of the suspension in paragraph<br>
b) to the sol. For example, in the case where a<br>
precursor comprising or constituting a silicon alkoxide<br>
is used, a colloidal suspension prepared by mixing<br><br>
water, pyrolytic silica and an acid or a base may be<br>
added to the sol. This also makes it possible to adjust<br>
the pH value of the suspension; it is in fact known<br>
that pH is one of the factors having the greatest<br>
influence on the gelling stage, in particular the<br>
duration of that stage and the strength of the gel<br>
obtained. In fact it has been found experimentally that<br>
increasing the pH value brings about a reduction in the<br>
time required for gelling, achieving a period of the<br>
order of a few minutes, and in parallel with this<br>
imparts greater strength to the gel obtained, thus<br>
making it possible to manufacture products of larger<br>
dimensions. In detail the improved results in terms of<br>
strength of the gel are obtained from a sol having a pH<br>
value of between 3 and 6. In order to increase the pH<br>
of the suspension it may be brought into solution in a<br>
controlled gradual way with for example ammonium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
The sol so obtained can then be poured into container 1<br>
and proceed to the gelling stage. This stage takes<br>
place through maintaining the sol at a temperature<br>
below 40°C for a time varying from a few minutes to<br>
several hours. The gel so obtained has a gelatinous<br>
consistency and a porous structure and is immersed in<br>
the solvent, in particular water or a water/alcohol<br>
mixture as described previously.<br>
In order to be able to proceed to stage d) of drying of<br>
the gel it is necessary to provide for replacement of<br>
the solvent in that this drying preferably takes place<br>
at a temperature and pressure above the critical<br>
temperature and pressure for the solvent, and, when<br>
excessive water is present, achieving these pressures<br>
and temperatures would be extremely harmful to the<br>
integrity of the gel, given the agressivity of water<br>
towards the gel at high temperatures. In this respect,<br>
during a stage c') between the gelling stage c) and the<br>
subsequent stage d) of heating chamber 3 and drying the<br><br>
gel, the solvent present in chamber 3 and in the pores<br>
of the gel is replaced by an aprotic solvent, for<br>
example by washing the gel. This aprotic solvent is<br>
preferably selected from the group comprising acetone,<br>
dioxan and hydrofuran and is decidedly less aggressive<br>
towards the gel at high temperatures than water.<br>
The gel so prepared, with a level of solvent compatible<br>
with the specifications for the solvent extraction<br>
autoclave in question at supercritical conditions or<br>
"quasi-supercritical" conditions as described in the<br>
known art (Joseph G. Van Lierop et al. - US 4,806,328)<br>
is placed directly in the autoclave. The gel is then<br>
subjected to a further stage c') of passing through an<br>
inert gas, preferably nitrogen, at the pressure<br>
necessary to achieve a total pressure greater than the<br>
critical pressure for the aprotic solvent when the<br>
temperature exceeds the critical temperature for that<br>
aprotic solvent. Exceeding the critical conditions in<br>
this way has the advantage that a gel which better<br>
matches the desired dimensions is obtained in<br>
comparison with a gel which is obtained by drying at<br>
conditions below the critical conditions.<br>
As an alternative, during stage c') the inert gas is<br>
passed through at the pressure necessary to achieve<br>
total pressure and temperature values below the<br>
critical values for the aprotic solvent previously<br>
introduced, but compatible with the rules for<br>
extraction under subcritical conditions described in<br>
the known art (US 5,966,832; US 5,875,564; US<br>
5,473,826; US 5,343,633; PCT/EP 2003/014759).<br>
The gel is then heated; after this heating the aprotic<br>
solvent evaporates substantially completely and drying<br>
of the gel takes place.<br>
Subsequently in a stage d') the autoclave is<br>
depressurized with the consequent escape of vapours.<br><br>
These vapours may be recovered where this is considered<br>
to be convenient or necessary.<br>
In a subsequent stage d') an inert gas, preferably<br>
nitrogen, is caused to flow through the autoclave<br>
containing the gel in order to remove residual traces<br>
of vapours. In a subsequent stage d'') the dried gel<br>
is cooled and removed from the autoclave. In order to<br>
impart the desired transparency properties to the dried<br>
gel, a final sintering stage e) is provided in which<br>
the gel is heated to a predetermined temperature,<br>
preferably higher than the temperature at which drying<br>
stage d) takes place, in which vitrification of the gel<br>
occurs. Said stage e) is generally effected by placing<br>
the gel in a furnace, not illustrated, and increasing<br>
the temperature of the furnace above 100°C and up to<br>
even 900°C in an atmosphere which may also contain<br>
oxygen, used to calcine the gel. After this treatment,<br>
gases containing chlorine or its precursors may be<br>
introduced in order to eliminate any residual<br>
hydroxides in the gel, reaching a temperature of<br>
between 100°C and 1250°C. The temperature of the<br>
furnace is finally increased to between 900°C and<br>
1650°C in such a way as to bring about densification of<br>
the gel and therefore its vitrification, obtaining a<br>
mould having a vitreous consistency which is<br>
transparent to at least UV rays.<br>
Some of the characteristics of the device used to<br>
effect the abovementioned process will now be<br>
described.<br>
As mentioned previously, the performance of stage a)<br>
requires the provision of a container 1, illustrated in<br>
Figure 1, which defines within it a chamber 3. The sol<br>
is then poured into chamber 3.<br>
Advantageously chamber 3 is a negative of the final<br>
shape or a portion of the final shape of mould 2 which<br><br>
it is desired to obtain, with dimensions which are<br>
suitably enlarged to take into account the progressive<br>
shrinkage acting on the sol during the gelling stage<br>
and subsequent shrinkage associated with the stages of<br>
drying and densification and/or sintering. Mould 2 is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
In detail, chamber 3 has at least a first surface 3a<br>
which is substantially of a shape which is a negative<br>
of a corresponding outer surface 2b of at least one<br>
transparent portion 2a of mould 2 being manufactured,<br>
and at least one second surface 3b which is<br>
substantially a negative of at least one corresponding<br>
inner surface 2c of said at least one transparent<br>
portion 2a of mould 2 being manufactured. This inner<br>
surface 2c defines a cavity 4, preferably a through<br>
cavity, within the mould.<br>
In relation to Figure 2, in the working condition,<br>
outer surface 2b of the said at least one transparent<br>
portion 2a of mould 2 being manufactured faces the<br>
external environment and allows the passage of UV rays<br>
towards the interior, while inner surface 2c of the<br>
said at least one transparent portion 2a of mould 2 is<br>
in contact with the material which has to be formed and<br>
polymerized.<br>
In detail, means may be provided externally to mould 2<br>
to generate UV rays. These means for the generation of<br>
UV rays must face mould 2, in particular the outer<br>
surface 2b of transparent portion 2a. In this way, in<br>
the working condition, the UV rays will be directed<br>
towards mould 2, and by virtue of the transparency of<br>
mould 2 to UV rays will pass through it reaching<br>
internal cavity 4. The material which has to be shaped<br>
and polymerized, generally a composite material or a<br>
silicone, is suitably introduced into cavity 4 to<br>
undergo polymerization through the UV rays generated as<br>
just described. The material which has to be formed and<br><br>
polymerized is then exposed to the UV rays while it is<br>
within the mould. Advantageously polymerization takes<br>
place through exposing the material which has to be<br>
shaped and polymerized while it is in movement through<br>
cavity 4 of mould 2. It is however conceivable that the<br>
flow of material which has to be formed and polymerized<br>
may be temporarily stopped in order to permit<br>
completion of the polymerization process.<br>
In the non-working condition, cavity 4 is empty and is<br>
therefore not filled with any material which has to be<br>
formed.<br>
Coupling means, not illustrated, may also be provided<br>
to secure mould 2 to a device, for example a<br>
pultrusion, extrusion or moulding device.<br>
One of the most critical operations for manufacturing<br>
moulds according to the invention is the production of<br>
cavity 4, for reasons which will be clarified below.<br>
In order to make the said cavity 4 (see for example<br>
Figures 1-5) it may be necessary to use an insert 5<br>
which has to be attached to container 1, in particular<br>
within chamber 3. In general, in order to make cavity 4<br>
at least one insert 5 which has to be attached to the<br>
container to define the second surface 3b of chamber 3<br>
is required. In this respect stage a) also comprises a<br>
stage of positioning and attaching insert 5 within<br>
chamber 3.<br>
According to a first embodiment illustrated in Figures<br>
1 and 2, mould 2 is made as a single block. This mould<br>
2, produced using the sol-gel process described<br>
previously, is wholly transparent to UV rays and has an<br>
outer cylindrical surface 2b and an inner surface 2c<br>
which is also cylindrical. In order to make this mould<br>
2, first surface 3a and second surface 3b of chamber 3<br>
are cylindrical. Within chamber 3 there is also housed<br><br>
an insert 5 defining a second surface 3b which is<br>
substantially a negative of the inner surface 2c of<br>
mould 2 which has to be manufactured. Insert 5 is<br>
preferably incompressible so as to withstand the<br>
compression forces generated by the surrounding sol<br>
during the gelling stage.<br>
In general it is preferable to use cylindrical inserts<br>
5 to generate cylindrical cavities 4 within mould 2 and<br>
therefore passages of constant cross section for the<br>
material being polymerized which passes through it. As<br>
an alternative it is possible to use inserts 5 of a<br>
frustoconical shape, not illustrated, which can be more<br>
easily removed from the gel but which can only be used<br>
in circumstances where a cavity 4 having a variable<br>
cross section for passage of the material being<br>
polymerized is necessary.<br>
In a wholly similar way it is possible to obtain<br>
different embodiments of a wholly transparent mould 2<br>
as illustrated in Figures 3 to 5 and in any event in<br>
accordance with other embodiments not illustrated and<br>
corresponding combinations. For example, using a<br>
container 1 comprising a plurality of inserts 5 it is<br>
possible to obtain a mould 2 having a plurality of<br>
cavities 4. Figure 3 in particular illustrates a<br>
cylindrical mould 2 having three cylindrical cavities 4<br>
in line extending parallel to each other in as many<br>
directions. Figure 4 illustrates a mould 2 having a<br>
substantially square cross section with three cavities<br>
of rectangular cross section in line and extending in<br>
directions parallel to each other. Finally, Figure 5<br>
illustrates a mould 2 having a substantially square<br>
cross section with four parallel cylindrical cavities<br>
arranged alongside the corners of a square.<br>
When an insert 5 is present, gelling stage d) also<br>
provides for an operation of extracting insert 5 from<br>
the sol as it is gelling. The removal of inserts 5 has<br><br>
proved to be a quite complex operation in that, while<br>
it is forming from the sol, the gel has a "syneresis"<br>
stage, that is a stage during which the material of<br>
which it is formed "migrates" in the direction of the<br>
centre of mass thus reducing its volume. It is obvious<br>
that in this situation any inserts 5 present will.tend<br>
to be tightly gripped by the forming gel, which has a<br>
gelatinous and not very strong consistency. It is<br>
therefore necessary to remove these inserts 5 before<br>
they are excessively gripped by the gel, but in any<br>
event not before the gel has developed sufficient<br>
robustness to be able to support the presence of an<br>
internal cavity 4. It is therefore necessary to remove<br>
each insert 5 at a well-specified time in order to<br>
avoid irreversible damage to the gel which would<br>
compromise its integrity.<br>
For this purpose it is possible to cause container 1 to<br>
rotate, preferably about an axis of symmetry of insert<br>
5 which has to be removed, in order to assist removal<br>
of said insert 5 making use of the occurrence of<br>
centrifugal forces acting on the gelling sol, as<br>
illustrated in the known art (US 6,799,442).<br>
In a further version it may be convenient to prepare<br>
cylindrical mould 2 completely on the basis of the<br>
centrifugal force acting on the sol located in a<br>
suitable horizontal cylindrical container which is<br>
caused to rotate rapidly axially as described in the<br>
known art (US 4,680,045).<br>
In this arrangement the sol, whose volume occupies a<br>
predetermined fraction of the volume of the container,<br>
under the effect of the centrifugal force adopts the<br>
cylindrical shape of the container bounded externally<br>
by the inner surface of the container, and internally<br>
by the equipotential surface, which is also<br>
cylindrical, perpendicular to the centrifugal force<br>
field present during the gelling stage.<br><br>
The process and device described above make it possible<br>
to obtain moulds which are wholly transparent to UV<br>
rays. Figure 2 also indicates, diagrammatically in that<br>
it is known, a localized source of UV rays through the<br>
number 6. It is however advantageous to use one or more<br>
sources 6 of UV rays which are distributed over and<br>
face the entire periphery of mould 2 to generate<br>
uniform irradiation of all the material which has to be<br>
formed and polymerized.<br>
In another embodiment, illustrated in Figure 6, mould 2<br>
is made of two half-moulds 7 which are transparent to<br>
UV rays and identical to each other in such a way that<br>
they can be placed together accurately obtaining a<br>
wholly transparent mould 2. As may be seen from Figure<br>
7, in order to make the two half-moulds 7 two identical<br>
containers 1 are required, each of which has internally<br>
a chamber 3 defining a first hemicylindrical surface 8a<br>
which is substantially a negative of an outer<br>
hemicylindrical surface 7a of half-mould 7 being<br>
manufactured, a second hemicylindrical surface 8b which<br>
is substantially a negative of an inner hemicylindrical<br>
surface 7b of half-mould 7 and two flat closure<br>
surfaces 8b in the form of negatives of two flat<br>
contact surfaces 7c in each half-mould 7 to allow the<br>
two half-moulds 7 to be mated together. Advantageously<br>
in this case it is not necessary to attach inserts 5<br>
within chamber 3.<br>
It is however possible to use a single container to<br>
consecutively make the two half-moulds 7.<br>
In accordance with embodiments not illustrated here the<br>
process described can be extended to the manufacture of<br>
wholly transparent moulds 2 also comprising more than<br>
two transparent portions 2a joined together.<br><br>
As described in the following two embodiments it is<br>
also possible to manufacture a mould 2 comprising a<br>
portion 2a transparent to UV rays made using the sol-<br>
gel process described and a portion 9 which is not<br>
transparent to UV rays. This portion 9 which is not<br>
transparent to UV rays may be manufactured using<br>
conventional materials, for example metal, and may also<br>
be machined using machine tools. Advantageously,<br>
furthermore, a surface 9a of this non-transparent<br>
portion 9 facing the product which has to be shaped and<br>
polymerized may be coated with a reflecting material 10<br>
for reasons which will be specified below.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a particular embodiment comprising<br>
a half-mould transparent to UV rays (corresponding to<br>
previously mentioned transparent portion 2a) and a<br>
half-mould 9 which is not transparent to UV rays. The<br>
two half-moulds define cavity 4 for passage of the<br>
material being shaped and polymerized. In this<br>
configuration the UV rays originate from one or more<br>
sources 6 of UV rays facing the transparent half-mould<br>
and are directed towards the interior of mould 2, in<br>
particular towards cavity 4.<br>
In a further embodiment illustrated in Figure 9, an<br>
inner surface 9a of non-transparent half-mould 9 facing<br>
cavity 4 and therefore, in the working condition, the<br>
product being shaped and polymerized, is coated with a<br>
reflecting material 10, for example a film of aluminium<br>
10. This makes it possible to reflect any UV rays which<br>
are otherwise dispersed towards the product and<br>
therefore increase the polymerizing efficiency of mould<br>
2.<br>
It is also possible to use moulds 2 obtained as<br>
described above in accordance with the process of<br>
manufacture to carry out processes having industrial<br>
applications in which it is convenient to polymerize<br>
the working material through UV rays.<br><br>
introduced into mould 2 by exerting a pulling force in<br>
a direction of progress.<br>
In mould 2 the fibres converge and are coated by the<br>
coating layers if these are present, giving rise to a<br>
composite material. These may also be provided for<br>
subsequent compacting of the fibres. In addition to<br>
this means may also subsequently be used to shape or<br>
dimension the compacted composite material.<br>
A non-restrictive embodiment of an extrusion process<br>
comprises the following stages:<br>
-	preparing a material which has to be extruded,<br>
providing a mould 2 which is at least partly<br>
transparent to UV rays using the process previously<br>
described, having a through cavity 4 shaped to<br>
plastically deform the material being extruded,<br>
-	the provision of thrust means to force the material<br>
being extruded to pass through mould 2,<br>
-	application of a thrust in the direction of the mould<br>
to the material being extruded,<br>
-	forcing the material being extruded to pass through<br>
mould 2 imposing plastic deformation on the material<br>
being extruded during its passage through mould 2,<br>
polymerizing the material through UV rays as it<br>
passes through the mould.<br>
Similarly to the pultrusion process, in an extrusion<br>
process a mould 2 which is at least partly transparent<br>
to UV rays manufactured as described previously is<br>
provided.<br>
The material being extruded preferably belongs to the<br>
group comprising materials based on silicone and there<br>
is provision for the addition of a catalyst, for<br>
example a thermohardening catalyst, to polymerize the<br>
material being moulded when it is exposed to UV rays.<br>
The material which is to be extruded is also preferably<br><br>
present in a semi-liquid state or in any event has<br>
sufficient malleability to be plastically deformed.<br>
Thrust means to force the material being extruded to<br>
pass through mould 2 are also provided. In this respect<br>
the mould must have a through cavity 4 shaped to<br>
plastically deform the material being extruded.<br>
The thrust means may be provided by means of pistons or<br>
rotary screws.<br>
A thrust in the direction of mould 2 is therefore<br>
applied to the material being extruded by the thrust<br>
means, forcing it to pass through mould 2 and imposing<br>
plastic deformation upon it.<br>
While the material being extruded passes through mould<br>
2 it is exposed to UV rays which activate its<br>
polymerization.<br>
A non-restrictive embodiment of a moulding process<br>
comprises the following stages:<br>
preparing a material which is to be moulded,<br>
providing through the process previously described two<br>
half-moulds which can be joined together, of which at<br>
least one is transparent to UV rays, internally<br>
defining a cavity 4 which can be wholly exposed to UV<br>
rays,<br>
-	joining the two half-moulds,<br>
-	inserting the material which has to be moulded within<br>
cavity 4,<br>
-	polymerizing the material through UV rays while it is<br>
within cavity 4.<br>
Similarly to the pultrusion and extrusion processes, in<br>
a moulding process a mould which is at least partly<br>
transparent to UV rays manufactured in accordance with<br>
what has been described previously is provided. The<br>
mould is constructed as at least two portions which can<br><br>
be joined together, of which at least one is<br>
transparent to UV rays, and defines within it a cavity<br>
4 which can be wholly exposed to UV rays.<br>
The material which has to be moulded preferably belongs<br>
to the group of materials based on silicone and rubbers<br>
and provision is made for the addition of a catalyst,<br>
for example a thermohardening catalyst, to polymerize<br>
the material being moulded when exposed to UV rays. The<br>
material being moulded is also preferably present in a<br>
semi-liquid state or in any event has sufficient<br>
malleability to be forced to fill the cavity present<br>
within the mould.<br>
The process provides for insertion of the material to<br>
be moulded within cavity 4. This takes place preferably<br>
through at least one hole made in at least one portion<br>
of the mould through which it is injected under<br>
pressure within cavity 4. The material being moulded is<br>
then forced to match the shape of cavity 4.<br>
Once injection has taken place it is then possible to<br>
polymerize the material by exposing it to UV rays while<br>
it is still in cavity 4.<br>
Obviously the mould used may be used for the injection<br>
moulding of thermohardening materials.<br>
In addition to this the technology mentioned above also<br>
makes possible the compression moulding of<br>
thermohardening material.<br>
It should also be noted that inserts, for example	of<br>
metal, but advantageously also of quartz, may	be<br>
positioned within the mould in order to be able	to<br>
obtain hollow pieces.<br>
This invention provides major advantages.<br><br>
First of all the use of moulds which are transparent to<br>
UV rays makes it possible to polymerize the material<br>
being formed by UV rays while it still lies in the<br>
mould and this appreciably reduces processing times, in<br>
particular because of the possibility of using UV rays<br>
whose polymerizing action is appreciably faster than in<br>
the case where heated moulds are used. This has the<br>
advantageous effect of substantially increasing the<br>
productivity of production plants such as, as in the<br>
examples mentioned, pultrusion, extrusion and moulding<br>
plants.<br>
In addition to this, the material which has to be<br>
shaped and polymerized may be advantageously exposed to<br>
UV rays while it is in movement within the mould, thus<br>
bringing about the advantage of regularizing production<br>
and further increasing productivity.<br>
A further advantage is provided by reducing the<br>
production costs of the moulds, in that the sol-gel<br>
process for the manufacture of moulds transparent to UV<br>
provides as a result moulds having a surface which is<br>
defined with high accuracy and which does not require<br>
any further machining by machine tools. Economic<br>
advantage also lies in the fact that the substantial<br>
increase in productivity also has a positive effect in<br>
a tangible reduction in costs per unit product, in<br>
particular fixed costs, including the costs of making<br>
the moulds.<br>
These moulds are subject to shrinkage during the stages<br>
of gelling, drying and sintering, but the amount of<br>
such reduction in size is considered in advance by<br>
suitably increasing the initial dimensions of the chamber which contains the sol. The final effect is<br>
therefore that of obtaining moulds with high<br>
dimensional accuracy and high transparency and<br>
sharpness .<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
Title: Sol-gel process for the manufacture of a mould.<br>
Sol-gel process for the manufacture of a mould having at least one portion transparent to UV rays,<br>
comprising the following stages: providing a container which is a negative of the said at least one<br>
portion transparent to UV of the mould which is to be manufactured and internally defining a<br>
chamber, the said chamber having at least one first surface which is substantially the negative of a<br>
corresponding outer surface of the said at least one transparent portion of the mould being<br>
manufactured, and at least one second surface which is substantially a negative of at least one<br>
corresponding inner surface of the said at least one transparent portion of the mould being<br>
manufactured, wherein the container comprises at least one insert defining the said at least one<br>
second surface of the chamber, filling the chamber with a sol, gelling the sol, obtaining a gel,<br>
wherein the gelling step c) comprises a step of extracting the said at least one insert at a<br>
predetermined time during the gelling of the sol to prevent the formation of cracks in the gel that is<br>
forming, heating the gel and a corresponding solvent for a programmed period of time consequently<br>
achieving predetermined temperature and pressure values, and evaporating the said solvent, the said<br>
heating giving rise to drying of the gel, densifying or sintering the gel which is dry through heating<br>
to a predetermined temperature, with the consequent formation of the said transparent portion of the<br>
mould, with a vitreous consistency and transparent to at least UV rays, the said mould being<br>
suitable for the formation of pultrusion or extrusion products or the moulding of plastics materials<br>
through a process of photocatalytic synthesis.</td>
