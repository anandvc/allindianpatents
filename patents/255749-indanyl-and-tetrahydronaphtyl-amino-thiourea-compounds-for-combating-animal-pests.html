				<td>Indanyl- and Tetrahydronaphtyl-amino-thiourea compounds for combating animal pests<br>
The present invention relates to Indanyl- and Tetrahydronaphtyl-amino-thiourea com-<br>
pounds for combating animal pests.<br>
Animal pests and in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes destroy growing and<br>
harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, causing large<br>
economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal<br>
agents are known, due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said<br>
agents, there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating animal pests. In par-<br>
ticular, animal pests such as insects, arachnids and nematodes are difficult to be effec-<br>
tively controlled.<br>
Therefore, it was an object of the present invention to provide compounds having a<br>
good pesticidal activity and show a broad activity spectrum against a large number of<br>
different anmimal pests, especially against difficult to control insects, arachnids and<br>
nematodes.<br>
However, no Indanyl- and Tetrahydronaphtyl-amino-thiourea compounds have been<br>
described so far for combatting animal pests.<br>
Conventional art describes in US 3953506, US 3953606, US 4005140 and US<br>
4062856 ureidotetralin compounds and their use as herbicidal agents and/or animal<br>
growth regulators.<br>

The compound of the present invention can be e.g. prepared from the corresponding<br>
amines II by the synthetic route outlined in the following scheme:<br><br><br>
According to the method outlined in the scheme, an amine II (or its salt) is converted to<br>
the corresponding isothiocyanate IV by conventional means, e.g. by reacting II with<br>
thiophosgene (see e.g. Houben-Weyl, E4, "Methoden der Organischen Chemie", chap-<br>
ter lle, pp. 837-842, Georg Thieme Verlag 1983. The isothiocyanate IV is then reacted<br>
with an aminoethanol V, thereby obtaining the thiourea 1Mb.<br>
The reaction of the aminoethanol with isothiocyanate IV can be performed in accor-<br>
dance with standard methods of organic chemistry, see e.g. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem.<br>
56(7), 1062-65(1992).<br>
Compounds of the formula Ilia and 1Mb can be further converted into new compounds<br>
of the general formula III by modification of R2. In particular if R2 is hydrogen these<br>
compounds Illc can e.g. converted by esterification reactions e.g. with carboxylic acids<br>
or carboxylic acid chlorides or e.g. by electrophilic substitution by reaction with an elec-<br>
trophile, e.g. with an alkylating agent by methods familiar to an organic chemist and<br>
well known in the art, as outlined in the following scheme and described below.<br><br><br>
Due to their excellent activity, the compounds of the formula I may be used for control-<br>
ling animal pests, selected harmful insects, arachnids and nematodes. Accordingly, the<br>

Solvents/carriers, which are suitable, are e.g.:<br>
solvents such as water, aromatic solvents (for example Solvesso products, xy-<br>
lene and the like), paraffins (for example mineral fractions), alcohols (for example<br>
methanol, butanol, pentanol, benzyl alcohol), ketones (for example cyclohexanone,<br>
gamma-butyrolactone), pyrrolidones (N-metyhl-pyrrolidone (NMP),N-octylpyrrolidone<br>
NOP), acetates (glycol diacetate), alkyl lactates, lactones such as g-butyrolactone,<br>
glycols, fatty acid dimethylamides, fatty acids and fatty acid esters, triglycerides, oils of<br>
vegetable or animal origin and modified oils such as alkylated plant oils. In principle,<br>
solvent mixtures may also be used.<br>
carriers such as ground natural minerals and ground synthetic minerals, such<br>
as silica gels, finely divided silicic acid, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay, limestone, lime,<br>
chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate and magnesium<br>
sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, such as, for example,<br>
ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of<br>
vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal,<br>
cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers are nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (for example polyoxyethylene<br>
fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates).<br>
Examples of dispersants are lignin-sulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable surfactants are alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of ligno-<br>
sulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, phenolsulfonic acid, dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic<br>
acid, alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkylsulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, fatty ac-<br><br>
ids and sulfated fatty alcohol glycol ethers, furthermore condensates of sulfonated<br>
naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphtha-<br>
lene or of naphthalenesulfonic acid with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene<br>

lated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, ethoxylated polyoxypropylene, lauryl al-<br>
cohol polyglycol ether acetal, sorbitol esters,<br>
Also anti-freezing agents such as glycerin, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and bacte-<br>
ricides such as can be added to the formulation.<br>
Suitable antifoaming agents are for example antifoaming agents based on silicon or<br>
magnesium stearate.<br>
Suitable preservatives are for example dichlorophen und benzyl alcohol hemiformal<br>
Suitable thickeners are compounds, which confer a pseudoplastic flow behavior to the<br>
formulation, i.e. high viscosity at rest and low viscosity in the agitated stage. Mention<br>
may be made, in this context, for example, of commercial thickeners based on poly-<br>
saccharides, such as Xanthan Gum® (Kelzan® from Kelco), Rhodopol®23 (Rhone<br>
Poulenc) or Veegum® (from R.T. Vanderbilt), or organic phyllosilicates, such as Atta-<br>
clay® (from Engelhardt). Antifoam agents suitable for the dispersions according to the<br>
invention are, for example, silicone emulsions (such as, for example, Silikon® SRE,<br>
Wacker or Rhodorsil® from Rhodia), long-chain alcohols, fatty acids, organofluorine<br>
compounds and mixtures thereof. Biocides can be added to stabilize the compositions<br>
according to the invention against attack by microorganisms. Suitable biocides are, for<br>
example, based on isothiazolones such as the compounds marketed under the trade-<br>
marks Proxel® from Avecia (or Arch) or Acticide® RS from Thor Chemie and Kathon®<br>
MK from Rohm &amp; Haas. Suitable antifreeze agents are organic polyols, for example<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol. These are usually employed in amounts<br>
of not more than 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the active compound<br>
composition. If appropriate, the active compound compositions according to the inven-<br>
tion may comprise 1 to 5% by weight of buffer, based on the total amount of the formu-<br>
lation prepared, to regulate the pH, the amount and type of the buffer used depending<br>
on the chemical properties of the active compound or the active compounds. Examples<br>
of buffers are alkali metal salts of weak inorganic or organic acids, such as, for exam-<br>
ple, phosphoric acid, boronic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid,<br>
tartaric acid, oxalic acid and succinic acid.<br>
Substances which are suitable for the preparation of directly sprayable solutions, emul-<br>
sions, pastes or oil dispersions are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point,<br><br>
such as kerosene or diesei oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal<br>
origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene, xylene, paraf-<br>
fin, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes or their derivatives, methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, isophorone, strongly polar<br>
solvents, for example dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomi-<br>
tantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous<br>
granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Examples<br>
of solid carriers are mineral earths such as silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay,<br>
limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, such as,<br>
for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and<br>
products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nut-<br>
shell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active ingredient. The active ingredients are employed in a<br>
purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
For seed treatment purposes, respective formulations can be diluted 2-10 fold leading<br>
to concentrations in the ready to use preparations of 0,01 to 60% by weight active<br>
compound by weight, preferably 0,1 to 40% by weight.<br>
The compound of formula I can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or<br>
the use forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solu-<br>
tions, powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusta-<br>
ble products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended pur-<br>
poses; they are intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the<br>
active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Al-<br>
ternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wet-<br>
ter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such con-<br>
centrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br><br>
The active ingredient concentrations in the ready-to-use products can be varied within<br>
relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.01 to<br>
1 % per weight.<br>
The active ingredients may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br>
(ULV), it being possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of active<br>
ingredient, or even to apply the active ingredient without additives.<br>
The following are examples of formulations:<br>

5 parts by weight of the active compound are ground finely and mixed intimately with<br>
95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable product having 5%<br>
(w/w) of active compound.<br>
J) Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br><br>
0.5 part by weight of the active compound is ground finely and associated with 95.5<br>
parts by weight of carriers, whereby a formulation with 0.5% (w/w) of active compound<br>
is obtained. Current methods are extrusion, spray-drying or the fluidized bed. This<br>
gives granules to be applied undiluted for foliar use.<br>
K) ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compound is dissolved in 90 parts by weight of an or-<br>
ganic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product having 10% (w/w) of active<br>
compound, which is applied undiluted for foliar use.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or<br>
bactericides may be added to the active ingredients, if appropriate just immediately<br>
prior to use (tank mix). These agents usually are admixed with the agents according to<br>
the invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the present invention compounds I may be<br>
applied with other active ingredients, for example with other pesticides, insecticides,<br>
herbicides, fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate, urea, potash, and superphosphate,<br>
phytotoxicants and plant growth regulators, safeners and nematicides. These<br>
additional ingredients may be used sequentially or in combination with the above-<br>
described compositions, if appropriate also added only immediately prior to use (tank<br>
mix). For example, the plant(s) may be sprayed with a composition of this invention<br>
either before or after being treated with other active ingredients.<br>
These additional agents can be admixed with the agents used according to the<br>
invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1. Mixing the compounds I or the compositions<br>
comprising them in the use form as pesticides with other pesticides frequently results<br>
in a broader pesticidal spectrum of action.<br>

Applications<br>
The animal pest, i.e. the insects, arachnids and nematodes, the plant, soil or water in<br>
which the plant is growing can be contacted with the present compound(s) I or compo-<br>
sition(s) containing them by any application method known in the art. As such, "con-<br>
tacting" includes both direct contact (applying the compounds/compositions directly on<br>
the animal pest or plant - typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect<br>
contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the animal pest or<br>
plant).<br>
The compounds of formula I or the pesticidal compositions comprising them may be<br>
used to protect growing plants and crops from attack or infestation by animal pests,<br>
especially insects, acaridae or arachnids by contacting the plant/crop with a pesticidally<br>
effective amount of compounds of formula I. The term "crop" refers both to growing<br>
and harvested crops.<br>
Moreover, animal pests may be controlled by contacting the target pest, its food sup-<br>
ply, habitat, breeding ground or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of com-<br>
pounds of formula I. As such, the application may be carried out before or after the<br>
infection of the locus, growing crops, or harvested crops by the pest.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be applied preventively to places at which<br>
occurrence of the pests is expected.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I may be also used to protect growing plants from attack or<br>
infestation by pests by contacting the plant with a pesticidally effective amount of com-<br>
pounds of formula I. As such, "contacting" includes both direct contact (applying the<br>
compounds/compositions directly on the pest and/or plant - typically to the foliage,<br>
stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions<br>
to the locus of the pest and/or plant).<br>
"Locus" means a habitat, breeding ground, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environ-<br>
ment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow.<br>
In general, "pesticidally effective amount" means the amount of active ingredient<br>
needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis,<br>
death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the<br>
occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can<br>
vary for the various compounds/compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally ef-<br>
fective amount of the compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions<br>
such as desired pesticidal effect and duration, weather, target species, locus, mode of<br>
application, and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula I are effective through both contact (via soil, glass, wall,<br>
bed net, carpet, plant parts or animal parts), and ingestion (bait, or plant part).<br>
For use against ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitos, crickets, or cockroaches, com-<br>
pounds of formula I are preferably used in a bait composition.<br>
The bait can be a liquid, a solid or a semisolid preparation (e.g. a gel). Solid baits can<br>
be formed into various shapes and forms suitable to the respective application e.g.<br>
granules, blocks, sticks, disks. Liquid baits can be filled into various devices to ensure<br>
proper application, e.g. open containers, spray devices, droplet sources, or evapora-<br>
tion sources. Gels can be based on aqueous or oily matrices and can be formulated to<br>
particular necessities in terms of stickyness, moisture retention or aging characteris-<br>
tics.<br>
The bait employed in the composition is a product, which is sufficiently attractive to<br>
incite insects such as ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitos, crickets etc. or cock-<br>
roaches to eat it. The attractiveness can be manipulated by using feeding stimulants or<br>
sex pheromones. Food stimulants are chosen, for example, but not exclusively, from<br>
animal and/or plant proteins (meat-, fish- or blood meal, insect parts, egg yolk), from<br>
fats and oils of animal and/or plant origin, or mono-, oligo- or polyorganosaccharides,<br>
especially from sucrose, lactose, fructose, dextrose, glucose, starch, pectin or even<br>
molasses or honey. Fresh or decaying parts of fruits, crops, plants, animals, insects or<br><br>
specific parts thereof can also serve as a feeding stimulant. Sex pheromones are<br>
known to be more insect specific. Specific pheromones are described in the literature<br>
and are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Formulations of compounds of formula I as aerosols (e.g in spray cans), oil sprays or<br>
pump sprays are highly suitable for the non-professional user for controlling pests such<br>
as flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos or cockroaches. Aerosol recipes are preferably com-<br>
posed of the active compound, solvents such as lower alcohols (e.g. methanol, etha-<br>
nol, propanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone), paraffin hydrocar-<br>
bons (e.g. kerosenes) having boiling ranges of approximately 50 to 250°C, dimethyl-<br>
formamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulphoxide, aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
toluene, xylene, water, furthermore auxiliaries such as emulsifiers such as sorbitol<br>
monooleate, oleyl ethoxylate having 3-7 mol of ethylene oxide, fatty alcohol ethoxylate,<br>
perfume oils such as ethereal oils, esters of medium fatty acids with lower alcohols,<br>
aromatic carbonyl compounds, if appropriate stabilizers such as sodium benzoate,<br>
amphoteric surfactants, lower epoxides, triethyl orthoformate and, if required, propel-<br>
lants such as propane, butane, nitrogen, compressed air, dimethyl ether, carbon diox-<br>
ide, nitrous oxide, or mixtures of these gases.<br>
The oil spray formulations differ from the aerosol recipes in that no propellants are<br>
used.<br>
The compounds of formula I and its respective compositions can also be used in mos-<br>
quito and fumigating coils, smoke cartridges, vaporizer plates or long-term vaporizers<br>
and also in moth papers, moth pads or other heat-independent vaporizer systems.<br>
Methods to control infectious diseases transmitted by insects (e.g. malaria, dengue<br>
and yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and leishmaniasis) with compounds of formula I<br>
and its respective compositions also comprise treating surfaces of huts and houses, air<br>
spraying and impregnation of curtains, tents, clothing items, bed nets, tsetse-fly trap or<br>
the like. Insecticidal compositions for application to fibers, fabric, knitgoods, nonwov-<br>
ens, netting material or foils and tarpaulins preferably comprise a mixture including the<br>
insecticide, optionally a repellent and at least one binder. Suitable repellents for exam-<br>
ple are N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), N,N-diethylphenylacetamide (DEPA), 1-<br>
(3-cyclohexan-1-yl-carbonyl)-2-methylpiperine, (2-hydroxymethylcyclohexyl) acetic acid<br>
lactone, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexandiol, indalone, Methylneodecanamide (MNDA), a pyrethroid<br>
not used for insect control such as {(+/-)-3-allyl-2-methyl-4-oxocyclopent-2-(+)-enyl-(+)-<br>
trans-chrysantemate (Esbiothrin), a repellent derived from or identical with plant ex-<br>
tracts like limonene, eugenol, (+)-Eucamalol (1), (-)-i-epi-eucamalol or crude plant<br>
extracts from plants like Eucalyptus maculata, Vitex rotundifolia, Cymbopogan martinii,<br>
Cymbopogan citratus (lemon grass), Cymopogan nartdus (citronella). Suitable binders<br>
are selected for example from polymers and copolymers of vinyl esters of aliphatic<br><br>
acids (such as such as vinyl acetate and vinyl versatate), acrylic and methacrylic es-<br>
ters of alcohols, such as butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexylacrylate, and methyl acrylate,<br>
mono- and di-ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as styrene, and aliphatic<br>
diens, such as butadiene.<br>
The impregnation of curtains and bednets is done in general by dipping the textile ma-<br>
terial into emulsions or dispersions of the insecticide or spraying them onto the nets.<br>
The compounds of formula I and its compositions can be used for protecting wooden<br>
materials such as trees, board fences, sleepers, etc. and buildings such as houses,<br>
outhouses, factories, but also construction materials, furniture, leathers, fibers, vinyl<br>
articles, electric wires and cables etc. from ants and/or termites, and for controlling<br>
ants and termites from doing harm to crops or human being (e.g. when the pests in-<br>
vade into houses and public facilities). The compounds of formula I are applied not<br>
only to the surrounding soil surface or into the under-floor soil in order to protect<br>
wooden materials but it can also be applied to lumbered articles such as surfaces of<br>
the under-floor concrete, alcove posts, beams, plywoods, furniture, etc., wooden arti-<br>
cles such as particle boards, half boards, etc. and vinyl articles such as coated electric<br>
wires, vinyl sheets, heat insulating material such as styrene foams, etc. In case of ap-<br>
plication against ants doing harm to crops or human beings, the ant controller of the<br>
present invention is applied to the crops or the surrounding soil, or is directly applied to<br>
the nest of ants or the like.<br>
In the case of soil treatment or of application to the pests dwelling place or nest, the<br>
quantity of active ingredient ranges from 0.0001 to 500 g per 100 m2, preferably from<br>
0.001 to 20 g per 100 m2.<br>
Customary application rates in the protection of materials are, for example, from 0.01 g<br>
to 1000 g of active compound per m2 treated material, desirably from 0.1 g to 50 g per<br>
m2.<br>
Insecticidal compositions for use in the impregnation of materials typically contain from<br>
0.001 to 95 weight %, preferably from 0.1 to 45 weight %, and more preferably from 1<br>
to 25 weight % of at least one repellent and/or insecticide.<br>
For use in bait compositions, the typical content of active ingredient is from 0.001<br>
weight % to 15 weight %, desirably from 0.001 weight % to 5% weight % of active<br>
compound.<br><br>
For use in spray compositions, the content of active ingredient is from 0.001 to 80<br>
weights %, preferably from 0.01 to 50 weight % and most preferably from 0.01 to 15<br>
weight %.<br>
For use in treating crop plants, the rate of application of the active ingredients of this<br>
invention may be in the range of 0.1 g to 4000 g per hectare, desirably from 25 g to<br>
600 g per hectare, more desirably from 50 g to 500 g per hectare.<br>
Seed treatment<br>
The compounds of formula I are also suitable for the treatment of seeds in order to<br>
protect the seed from insect pest, in particular from soil-living insect pests and the re-<br>
sulting plant's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar insects.<br>
The compounds of formula I are particularly useful for the protection of the seed from<br>
soil pests and the resulting plant's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar in-<br>
sects. The protection of the resulting plant's roots and shoots is preferred. More pre-<br>
ferred is the protection of resulting plant's shoots from piercing and sucking insects,<br>
wherein the protection from aphids is most preferred.<br>
The present invention therefore comprises a method for the protection of seeds from<br>
insects, in particular from soil insects and of the seedlings' roots and shoots from in-<br>
sects, in particular from soil and foliar insects, said method comprising contacting the<br>
seeds before sowing and/or after pregermination with a compound of the general for-<br>
mula I or a salt thereof. Particularly preferred is a method, wherein the plant's roots<br>
and shoots are protected, more preferably a method, wherein the plants shoots are<br>
protected form piercing and sucking insects, most preferably aa method, wherein the<br>
plants shoots are protected from aphids.<br>
The term seed embraces seeds and plant propagules of all kinds including but not lim-<br>
ited to true seeds, seed pieces, suckers, corms, bulbs, fruit, tubers, grains, cuttings,<br>
cut shoots and the like and means in a preferred embodiment true seeds.<br>
The term seed treatment comprises all suitable seed treatment techniques known in<br>
the art, such as seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking and seed<br>
pelleting.<br>
The present invention also comprises seeds coated with or containing the active com-<br>
pound.<br>
The term "coated with and/or containing" generally signifies that the active ingredient is<br>
for the most part on the surface of the propagation product at the time of application,<br>
although a greater or lesser part of the ingredient may penetrate into the propagation<br><br>
product, depending on the method of application. When the said propagation product is<br>
(re)planted, it may absorb the active ingredient.<br>
Suitable seed is seed of cereals, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices, ornamentals,<br>
for example seed of durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize (fodder maize<br>
and sugar maize / sweet and field corn), soybeans, oil crops, crucifers, cotton, sun-<br>
flowers, bananas, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sugarbeet, fodder beet, eggplants,<br>
potatoes, grass, lawn, turf, fodder grass, tomatoes, leeks, pumpkin/squash, cabbage,<br>
iceberg lettuce, pepper, cucumbers, melons, Brassica species, melons, beans, peas,<br>
garlic, onions, carrots, tuberous plants such as potatoes, sugar cane, tobacco, grapes,<br>
petunias, geranium/pelargoniums, pansies and impatiens.<br>
In addition, the active compound may also be used for the treatment seeds from<br>
plants, which tolerate the action of herbicides or fungicides or insecticides owing to<br>
breeding, including genetic engineering methods.<br>
For example, the active compound can be employed in treatment of seeds from plants,<br>
which are resistant to herbicides from the group consisting of the sulfonylureas, imida-<br>
zolinones, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous<br>
active substances (see for example, EP-A-0242236, EP-A-242246) (WO 92/00377)<br>
(EP-A-0257993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659) or in transgenic crop plants, for example<br>
cotton, with the capability of producing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which<br>
make the plants resistant to certain pests (EP-A-0142924, EP-A-0193259),<br>
Furthermore, the active compound can be used also for the treatment of seeds from<br>
plants, which have modified characteristics in comparison with existing plants consist,<br>
which can be generated for example by traditional breeding methods and/or the gen-<br>
eration of mutants, or by recombinant procedures). For example, a number of cases<br>
have been described of recombinant modifications of crop plants for the purpose of<br>
modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (e.g. WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO<br>
91/19806) or of transgenic crop plants having a modified fatty acid composition (WO<br>
91/13972).<br>
The seed treatment application of the active compound is carried out by spraying or by<br>
dusting the seeds before sowing of the plants and before emergence of the plants.<br>
Compositions which are especially useful for seed treatment are e.g.:<br>
A	Soluble concentrates (SL, LS)<br>
D	Emulsions (EW, EO, ES)<br>
E	Suspensions (SC, OD, FS)<br>

Conventional seed treatment formulations include for example flowable concentrates<br>
FS, solutions LS, powders for dry treatment DS, water dispersible powders for slurry<br>
treatment WS, water-soluble powders SS and emulsion ES and EC and gel formulation<br>
GF. These formulations can be applied to the seed diluted or undiluted. Application to<br>
the seeds is carried out before sowing, either directly on the seeds or after having pre-<br>
germinated the latter<br>
In a preferred embodiment a FS formulation is used for seed treatment. Typcially, a FS<br>
formulation may comprise 1-800 g/l of active ingredient, 1-200 g/l Surfactant, 0 to 200<br>
g/l antifreezing agent, 0 to 400 g/l of binder, 0 to 200 g/l of a pigment and up to 1 liter<br>

Especially preferred FS formulations of compounds of formula I for seed treatment<br>
usually comprise from 0.1 to 80% by weight (1 to 800 g/l) of the active ingredient, from<br>
0.1 to 20 % by weight (1 to 200 g/l) of at least one surfactant, e.g. 0.05 to 5 % by<br>
weight of a wetter and from 0.5 to 15 % by weight of a dispersing agent, up to 20 % by<br>
weight, e.g. from 5 to 20 % of an anti-freeze agent, from 0 to 15 % by weight, e.g. 1 to<br>
15 % by weight of a pigment and/or a dye, from 0 to 40 % by weight, e.g. 1 to 40 % by<br>
weight of a binder (sticker /adhesion agent), optionally up to 5 % by weight, e.g. from<br>

and optionally a preservative such as a biocide, antioxidant or the like, e.g. in an<br>
amount from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and a filler/vehicle up to 100 % by weight.<br>
Seed Treatment formulations may additionally also comprise binders and optionally<br>
colorants.<br>

In the treatment of seed, the application rates of the compounds I are generally from<br>
0.1 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, more<br>
preferably from 1 g to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed and in particular from 1 g to 200 g per<br>
100 kg of seed.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to seed comprising a compound of the formula I, or<br>
an agriculturally useful salt of I, as defined herein. The amount of the compound I or<br>
the agriculturally useful salt thereof will in general vary from 0.1 g to 10 kg per 100 kg<br>
of seed, preferably from 1 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, in particular from 1 g to 1000 g<br>
per 100 kg of seed. For specific crops such as lettuce the rate can be higher.<br>
Animal health<br>
The compounds of formula I or the enantiomers or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof<br>
are in particular also suitable for being used for combating parasites in and on animals.<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore also to provide new methods to control<br>
parasites in and on animals. Another object of the invention is to provide safer pesti-<br>
cides for animals. Another object of the invention is further to provide pesticides for<br>
animals that may be used in lower doses than existing pesticides. And another object<br>
of the invention is to provide pesticides for animals, which provide a long residual con-<br>
trol of the parasites.<br>
The invention also relates to compositions containing a parasiticidally effective amount<br>
of compounds of formula I or the enantiomers or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof<br>
and an acceptable carrier, for combating parasites in and on animals.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for treating, controlling, preventing and<br>
protecting animals against infestation and infection by parasites, which comprises<br>
orally, topically or parenterally administering or applying to the animals a parasiticidally<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula I or the enantiomers or veterinarily<br>
acceptable salts thereof or a composition comprising it.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a composition for treating,<br>
controlling, preventing or protecting animals against infestation or infection by parasites<br><br>
which comprises a parasiticidally effective amount of a compound of formula I or the<br>
enantiomers or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof or a composition comprising it.<br>
Activity of compounds against agricultural pests does not suggest their suitability for<br>
control of endo- and ectoparasites in and on animals which requires, for example, low,<br>
non-emetic dosages in the case of oral application, metabolic compatibility with the<br>
animal, low toxicity, and a safe handling.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that compounds of formula I are suitable for com-<br>
bating endo- and ectoparasites in and on animals.<br>
Compounds of formula I or the enantiomers or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof and<br>
compositions comprising them are preferably used for controlling and preventing infes-<br>
tations and infections animals including warm-blooded animals (including humans) and<br>
fish. They are for example suitable for controlling and preventing infestations and infec-<br>
tions in mammals such as cattle, sheep, swine, camels, deer, horses, pigs, poultry,<br>
rabbits, goats, dogs and cats, water buffalo, donkeys, fallow deer and reindeer, and<br>
also in fur-bearing animals such as mink, chinchilla and raccoon, birds such as hens,<br>
geese, turkeys and ducks and fish such as fresh- and salt-water fish such as trout,<br>
carp and eels.<br>

toluene was added benzoic acid 2-isothiocyanato-ethyl ester (0.37 g) at RT and stirred<br>
overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the residue purified on<br>
silica gel to yield 0.32 g of the product (46%) as a colorless solid, m.p. 135-137 OC.<br>
P.3 Isonicotinic acid 2-(3-indan-1-yl-thioureido)-ethyl ester (compound example 13<br>
of table 1)<br><br>
To a solution of thiophosgene (4.14 g) in chloroform was added at RT a solution of<br>
13.25 g potassium carbonate in 70 ml of water. To this mixture was added a solution of<br>
indanyl-1-amine (4.00 g) in chloroform (100 ml) and the mixture stirred at RT overnight.<br>
The reaction mixture was washed with water (2 x) and the organic phase dried over<br>
sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent yielded the product (5.20 g, 99%) which was<br>
used for the following step without further purification.<br>
2.97 g of this crude isothiocyanate was dissolved in toluol (70 ml) and treated with<br>
2-aminoethanol for 2 h at 90 °C. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the resi-<br>
due titurated with light petrol ether. The solid product was separated by filtration and<br>
dried in vacuo (yield: 3.88 g, 97%) and used without further purification for the next<br>
step.<br>
A solution of 1-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-3-indan-1-yl-thiourea (0.47 g) and triethyl amine (0.44<br>
g) in THF (20 ml) was treated with a solution of isonicotinyl chloride hydrochloride (0.36<br>
g) in 6 ml THF and the mixture stirred for 4 h at 50 °C. After concentration in vacuo the<br>
mixture was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with water, the organic layer dried<br>
separated and dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was<br>
purified by column chromatography on silica gel yielding a colorless powder (0.27 g) of<br>
the product (39%), m.p. 126-128 °C.<br>

the procedure described for example 16) and triethyl amine (0.44 g) in THF (20 ml)<br>
was treated at RT with a solution of methoxy acetyl chloride (0.22 g) in THF (6 ml) and<br>
stirred for 10 h at 50 °C. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, dissolved in<br>
ethyl acetate, washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was<br>
evaporated and the residue purified over silica gel to yield the product (0.36 g) in 58 %<br>
yield.<br>
P.5 (S)-1-lndan-1-yl-3-[2-(thiazol-2-yloxy)-ethyl]-thiourea (compound example 20 of<br>
table 1)<br>
A solution of the S-isomerof 1-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-3-indan-1-yl-thiourea (0,50 g, pre-<br>
pared according to the procedure described for example 16, starting from enantiomeri-<br>
cally pure (S)-indanyl-1-amine) in dimethylformamide (30 ml) was treated with potas-<br>
sium carbonate (0.37 g) and 2-bromothiazole (0.43 g) and heated at 45 °C for 6 h. Af-<br>
ter additional stirring overnight at RT an additional amount of potassium carbonate<br>
(0.15 g) was added and the solution stirred at 55 °C for 5 h.<br><br>
Surplus of carbonate was removed by filtration, the filtrate concentrated and the re-<br>
