This Invention relates to an autonomous absolutely pollution free, Eco-friendly, virtually noiseless transportation system capable to run hanging vehicles in high speed without any fuel, like petrol, diesel, gas, kerosene, coal, wood etc. or electricity, sun energy, magnetic force, wind energy, hydraulic or mechanical support or energy created by a stream of water on a definite track,<br>
In the known system of transport vehicles are either running manually with the help of human beings or animals in very slow speed, with great labour and ample amount of consumption of time, or mechanically although in high speed, but with a lot of consumption of costly fuels like petrol, diesel, electricity etc.<br>
As we know, billions of rupees of our nation are spent on fuel like petrol, diesel, electricity for carrying goods and passengers alone. Our country requires huge amount of foreign exchange to tackle the problem of importing petrol, diesel etc. Even after such huge expenditure on existing system of transport, the journey through the existing system is not so convenient and fast for a common man. We find heavy rushes everywhere in public &amp; private buses of short or long routes, local trains, trains running for long journey and even in air traffic system. Even after the allocation of substantial amount in our union budgets every year the problem is not solved till today. In fact, the problem is increasing day by day.<br>
Even after expenditure of billions of rupees, our goods is carried from one place to another place very slowly, even after paying high cost and incurring huge damages during carriage.<br>
The existing system of transport is very costly and unaffordable by a large section of our people, who are by and large poor.<br>
The existing system of transport is creating the problem of air pollution and hence directly responsible for health problems to our citizens. We are finding no efficient way to solve the problem of pollution, till today.<br>
But in this "PENDULUM TRAIN" system both goods and passengers are to be carried safely, conveniently, speedily in very low running cost, without any problem of pollution.<br>
The system saves billions of rupees and ample amount of valuable foreign exchange of our country.<br>
Contd..p/3..<br><br>
- : 3 : -BASE OF INVENTION<br>
My invention is based on movement of "PENDULUM". I have taken advantage of movement of a series of similar pendulums to run vehicles regularly in definite directions.<br>
WHAT IS PENDULUM<br>
"PENDULUM" is a weight suspended so as to swing freely. It has capability to oscillate from one extreme position and coming back to that position.<br>
As Pendulum has capability to move to and fro between two points, without any outside energy, i have used this "movement of pendulum" between two points to run vehicles, without any outside support.<br>
Referring to fig1 suppose EF is the plane surface of earth. GA is the suspension point from which pendulum (HA) is so suspended, that it should not touch the plane surface of the earth (EF). I is the position in which pendulum (HA) is absolutely still. Now take pendulum (HA) to position A,. It started to move to and fro between A &amp; B.<br>
OBSTACLE:<br>
Practically, I observed that, due to friction, in anticlockwise movement, pendulum (HA) does not reaches from A to B, if actually reaches at D, a point very near to B in between circular path WB. Again, in opposite clockwise movement pendulum (HA) does not reach from B to A, it actually reaches at C, a point very near to A, in between circular path I-A.<br>
OBSERVATION:<br>
I have noticed following useful observations regarding pendulum.<br>
1. At the point I pendulum (HA) is inert.<br>
2. Only at the position I, where pendulum (HA) is absolutely still,<br>
makes right angle to the plane surface of the earth (EF)<br>
3. When pendulum (HA) taken away from the position I, it acquires<br>
the capacity to move without any outside support.<br>
4. As the distance between suspension point (GA) and pendulum<br>
(HA) always be the same in every stage of movement.<br>
Contd...p/4..<br><br>
-: 4 : -<br>
5. Pendulum (HA) always moves in a circular path.<br>
6. The distance covered by pendulum (HA) from ORIGIN (A) to still<br>
position (I) is just equal to the stiil position (I) to destination (B)<br>
and vice versa.<br>
7. The distance of earth (EF) from both ends (A&amp;B) of pendulum<br>
(HA) always be the same i.e. AE is equal to BF.<br>
8. When pendulum (HA) moves from A to I, it is moving towards<br>
gravitational force, but as it reaches to point I, it started to run<br>
against gravitational force until it reaches to B (or D).<br>
In other words, it can be said that due to the movement from A to I towards gravitational force pendulum (HA) acquires power to move toward point B (or D). On reaching at point B (or D) it acquires again the capacity to move towards A (or C).<br>
9.	The most important observation here noticed is that pendulum<br>
(HA) is not loosing the energy on reaching to its destination (B)<br>
from ORIGIN (A), but acquires almost the same energy, what it<br>
spent during the movement to reach the destination (B), but for<br>
opposite direction movement (i.e. to reach again at A from B).<br>
SPEED<br>
A Pendulum is having reasonably good speed. It takes around one second to reach from one end to another end.<br>
LONG DISTANCE TO AND FRO MOVEMENT OF SUSPENDED OR TIED SUBSTANCES THROUGH A SERIES OF SIMILAR PENDULUMS<br>
I have also made this observation that it is possible only to carry tied or suspended substances for long distance in certain backward or forward direction on regular basis, practically only by a series of Similar Pendulums in longitudinal position and not by a single one. Referring to Figure 2, Pendulums (HA) (HB) &amp; (HC) are suspending from suspension points (GA, GB &amp; GC) respectively are similar in a row. EF is the plane surface of the earth, white IA, IB, &amp; IC are the inert (or still) positions of Pendulum (HA" HB &amp; HC) respectively. Pendulum (HA) is moving between points AA &amp; AB while Pendulum (HB) is moving between AB &amp; AC and Pendulum (HC) is moving between AC &amp; AD. Now it is possible to carry a substance suspended or tied on Pendulum (HA) from position AA to position (AB) and only after disconnecting the<br>
Contd...p/5..<br><br>
-:5:-<br>
substance from pendulum (HA) on AB position and connecting that substance to Pendulum (HB) on position (AB) to carry it to position (AC) and from position (AC) to position (AD) on pendulum (HC) in this way, it is possible to carry that substance, through anticlockwise movement of pendulums for further positions until the series of such similar pendulums come to an end on that side. Similarly it is possible to carry that substance in opposite direction from position AD to AC and AC to AB and AB to AA and for further positions until the series of pendulums come to an end on that side, through clockwise movement of pendulum.<br>
USEFULNESS OF "MOVEMENT OF PENDULUM" IN RUNNING VEHICLES IN MY "TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM"<br>
I have used the findings of the "movement of Pendulum" to run vehicle without any fuel, like petrol, diesel, gas, kerosene, coal, wood etc. or electricity, sun energy, magnetic force, wind energy, hydraulic or mechanical support or energy created by a stream of water on a definite track.<br>

SUSPENSION BEAM:<br>
A suspension beam is made of four equidistant hard metal (or alloy of metal) in lateral position rods/strips connected serially. The upper end of suspension beam is suspended through suspension place by ball and socket joints, while a joining car is permanently attached to its middle side of lower end by adjusting cum suspending rod connected by ball and socket joints. As both outsides of lower ends are used to carry vehicles from one station to another station, Joining Cones are attached permanently to the inner side of both outside ends of beam. The suspension Beam is more clearly described with reference to figure 3 accompanying drawing of it.<br>
Referring to figure 3 suspension beam is suspended through suspension place (SP) by ball and socket joints (SE, SF, SG&amp;SH). It is mainly made of four equidistant hard metal (or alloy of metals) rods/strips (SI, SJ, SK&amp;SL) connected serially. The distance between SI &amp; SJ is X while distance between SJ &amp; SK is also X and X is also the distance of SK &amp; SL. Joining cones (SCA) more than one in number, are permanently attached with the inner side of the lower end of outside strip (SI), while joining cones(SCB),more than one in number, are permanently attached with the inner side of lower end of outside strip (SL). A series of stoppers, like TA &amp; TB situated on both side of station are used to stop suspension beam on station.<br>
Contd...p/7..<br><br>
-: 7: -JOINING CONE:<br>
it is a conical shaped solid made of hard metal/alloy, the base of which is attached permanently to the both lowest outside end of a suspension beam internally. Minimum two such cones are attached to one side. These are attached on both sides of suspension beams, so during connection/disconnection process, a joining cone could be fitted exactly into the conical hollow end of the joining hand, enabling vehicle to suspend accurately and safely during the movement. Referring to figure 3, Joining cones (SCA) are attached permanently to the lowest outside end of suspension strip (SI) internally, while Joining cones (SCB) are attached permanently to the lowest outside end of suspension strip (SL), internally.<br>
ADJUSTING CUM SUSPENDING ROD :<br>
It is a hard metal rod strong enough to suspend joining car. This rod is also used as an adjusting rod during connection disconnection process. Both the ends of the rods are attached in such a way with lowest ends of suspension strips/rods placed in middle of suspension beam enabling it to revolve at its both connecting bases.<br>
Referring to figure 3, the lowest ends of strips/rods (SJ &amp; SK) are joined by a strong rod of metal (AC). This rod (AC) is used to suspend joining car (JC) with the helps of rods (JSA, JSB &amp; JSC) permanently by ball and socket joints. This rod (AC) is also used as an adjusting rod during connection/disconnection process. The length of rod (AC) is X, and X is also the length of joining car (JC).<br>
JOINING CAR:<br>
It is cylindrical equipment made of material or materials having specific gravity of more than seven like steel iron, brass etc. comprising of two similar joining cylinders used to connect or disconnect vehicles with suspension beams with the help of joining hands.<br>
Contd...p/8..<br><br>
-:8:-JOINING CYLINDER:<br>
It is hollow cylinder, made of a sheet of metal, comprising of a joining hand just double to its length and just short of its diameter. An elongated hole is made to the lower side of it throughout its length. In this hollow cylinder, the permanent connection of a handle made of lighter materials is made to joining hand by a metallic chain passing through elongated hole enabling the joining hand to move freely both sides to connect/disconnect vehicles. Two hooks/locks are also attached to the outer side of cylinder at the both ends of the elongated hole to prevent movement of joining hand.<br>
JOINING HAND:<br>
It is made of hard metal/alloy solid cylindrical bar, both lateral sides of which one is conical shaped hollow, capable to fit JOINING CONE of suspension beam exactly during connection/disconnection process. To move it into joining cylinder during connection/disconnection process, a handle is attached to middle of it by chain through elongated hole.<br>
Referring to figure 4, a Joining car comprises of two similar Joining cylinders(JCC), comprising of Joining hand(JH). The length (X) of Joining hand (JH) is just double to the length (2X) of Joining cylinder (JCC). The diameter of Joining hand (JH) is just short of Joining Cylinder (JCC). An elongated hole (EL) is made on lower side to move Joining hand (JH) with the help of handle (HA) connected with it by a chain (CH). Both ends (HE-HF) are conical shaped hollows. HO &amp; HP are the hooks/locks to prevent the movement of Joining hands. Whenever required chain (CH) is locked either int hook/lock (HO) or in hook/lock (HP) to stop the movement of Joining hand in cylinder.<br>
VEHICLES:<br>
The body of vehicles are made of lighter materials like aluminum, wood, glass etc. used to carry passengers, animals or goods from one place to another place, while other parts are made of heavy metals or alloys of<br>
metals.<br>
Contd...p/9..<br><br>
-:9:-<br>
It is made of mainly five parts.<br>
1. JOINING APERTURES: The holes made of heavy metals or alloys of<br>
metals is the upper most part of the vehicle in which "Joining Hands" of<br>
"Joining Car" of "SUSPENSION BEAM", precisely &amp; easily enters<br>
enabling vehicle to connect or disconnect with suspension beam.<br>
2. SHOCK ABSORBERS: Shock Absorbers are a chamber made of<br>
lighter material or materials situated at upper side of vehicle just beneath<br>
the Joining Apertures just larger than a room in length and breadth but<br>
much shorter than room in height comprising of series of springs joined<br>
with upper side of vehicle vertically to absorb shock, particularly during<br>
the landing of vehicles.<br>
3. ROOM: It is an empty place made of lighter materials used to carry<br>
human beings, animals or goods from one station to another station.<br>
4. BALANCING SOLID: It is nothing but a solid piece of heavy metal<br>
having outer curved surface the inner surface of which one is connected<br>
to the lower end of vehicle to balance the vehicle during movement.<br>
5. WHEELS: Four wheels made of heavy materials round in shape,<br>
capable to revolve are joined to the four corner of outer bottom of<br>
vehicle.<br>
Referring to figure 5, Joining aperture (JA) is a cylindrical hollow tube in which Joining hands can easily enter. The length of this tube is some what shorter than the length of vehicle (X) RO is an empty place called Room while Balancing solid (BS) is nothing but a solid piece of metal to balance the vehicle. Shock absorbers (SA) is the places of largest length and breadth in the vehicle comprises of a bed of springs in vertical position to absorb shock, particularly during the landing of vehicle. The length of shock absorber is exactly x.<br>
Four wheels (WHI, WHJ, WHK &amp; WHL) are attached to the four corners of vehicle enabling it to stand erect and save it from any damage during landing.<br>
STATIONS:<br>
Stations are serially made equidistant spaces made on pillars of heavy materials, where the lower ends of suspension beams meet during oscillations and where suspension beams are regularly stopped with the help of stoppers attached on row of pulling chambers fixed on floor of stations as per requirement.<br>
Contd...p/10..<br><br>
- :10:-<br>
These are the places where vehicles are regularly connected/ disconnected with suspension beam with the help of Joining cars to move nearby stations. Each station also have ample space for goods, passengers, and workers and for any other required purpose. Stations are the places where, if required, the lower end of suspension beam taken in between Stopping Rod attached in the middle of station and last pulling chamber with the help of Wheel &amp; Axle, Load Puller and common human or animal weights with or without the help of lever.<br>
STOPPER: Stopper is a device made of two simple strips of heavy metals or alloys of metals connected by a rivet in such a manner so'that the outer strip could fold itself only to the backside, i.e. towards middle of station while another inner back side strip is attached permanently in fixed position to the pulling chamber.<br>
In front side of the two strips, small hooks are situated in a row on the outer side of strips i.e. the side opposite to the middle position of station. These hooks stretch springs in such a way, so if any pressure is exerted on outer strip it could fold itself to backside, i.e. towards middle of station and as soon as pressure is withdrawn it would again come to its ORIGNAL Straight position due to tension of springs. While inner back side strip would always be in same position.<br>
PULLING CHAMBER :<br>
A square chamber made of heavy metals or alloys of metals strips capable to move front and back side into a pillar where front side of chamber is permanently connected to the back side of stopper while the back side is connected to the pillar by a series of horizontal springs and where the row of round hooks in which each hook attached in alternate position of horizontal springs attached to the back side of pulling chamber and where each hook is also connected to string passing through hole on pillar and where the another end of string is attached permanently with a handle, a common rod of lighter materials.<br>
STOPPING ROD:<br>
Stopping Rod is a final stopper. It is just a hard metal bar fixed on two pillars in the middle position of the station capable to stop finally the suspension beams to go ahead and it is the place where disconnection/connection process takes place.<br>
Contd...p/11..<br><br>
- :11 :-<br>
Referring to figure 6, (TN) &amp; (TO) are two simple strips of metals connected by rivet (TN) in such a manner, so that strips could fold themselves only to backside.<br>
in front side of two strips (TN) &amp; (TO) small hooks (HI, HJ &amp; HK) are situated on the outside of fixed strip (TO) while small hooks (HL, HM &amp; HN) are situated on a movable folded strip (TN). Springs RS, RT &amp; RU are stretched respectively with hooks (HI &amp; HL), (HJ &amp; HM) &amp; (HK &amp; HN). Pulling chamber (TT) is a square chamber made of metal, capable to move front and backside into the hole (TX) of pillar (TP). White front side of the chamber is permanently connected to strip (TO), the backside is connected to pillar by a series of horizontal springs (TS). The row of round hooks (TY) situated on back portion of chamber are also attached to handle (TV) by a series of strings(TU) passing through a series of small holes (TW) made in pillar. In either side of a station these stoppers are fixed to puling chambers of pillars in a row to stop the suspension beam. At the end, a stopping rod is fixed as a final stopper.<br>
When the lower end of a suspension beam enters into the station the stopper stopped that one to go back again to the station where from its lower end has been arrived, until Pulling Chamber on pillar is pulled back by operator with the help of handle to allow it to return back. On leaving the handle, pulling chamber again return back to its original position due to the force of stretched springs up to the Pulling Chamber Stoppers (TQ &amp; TR). The exact stoppage of a suspension beam in a station is the place between stopping rod and the last row of general stoppers attached on pulling chamber. But due to friction, just like pendulum, the lower end of suspension beam, many a times, cannot reach to desired place on station. So a little effort is required to put suspension beam to its desired place i.e. in between Stopping Rod and last Pulling Chamber.<br>
Hence, a set of "WHEEL &amp; AXLE" are used on every station to put suspension beams to their desired place, the set of "WHEEL &amp; AXLE" are fixed on convenient place on each station.<br>
WHEELS AXLE:<br>
It is a simple type of machine. In this a rope is wound over a wheel or cylinder capable of rotating about a fixed axis. Another rope is wound in opposite turn on the axle or on a co-axial smaller wheel fixed with the<br>
axle. One end of each rope is connected either to the wheel or axle and<br>
their other ends are free.<br>
Contd..p/12..<br><br>
-: 12:-<br>
On applying force by pulling the first rope the axle begins to rotate and the second rope is wound up. As a result the load hanging from the free end of the second rope rises up.<br>
Referring to figure 7, (WL) is the wheel capable of rotating about a fixed axle (AX). On the wheel, rope (RQ) is wound over the larger wheel. Another rope (RP) is wound in opposite turn on smaller wheel (WM) fixed with axle. The load (LO) side is connected with adjusting cum suspending rod of suspension beam with help of a hook, whenever required so. While effort side (ET) is connected permanently with a load puller to pull rope, whenever required so.<br>
LOAD PULLER:<br>
It is a simple strong beam made of hard metal or alloy of metals, fixed on two pillars having number of holes in a row to suspend weights by hooks attached to the lower ends of each rope passing through holes of it, while the upper ends of these ropes are attached with end of ropes of effort side of Wheel &amp; Axle. Such load pullers in required numbers are placed in convenient place in a station.<br>
WEIGHT :<br>
Weight is an ordinary weight, preferably round in shape, attached with chain and hook required either to suspend it or to carry it conveniently from one place to another place by a human being.<br>
Referring to figure 8, on surface of station (SL) the beam (BL) of load puller fixed on two pillars (PL &amp; PQ) erected vertically. HL are the row of holes to pass ropes. The weights are as per requirement, are to be suspended from the hooks attached to the end of the ropes. Due to friction, when the lower end of the suspension beam cannot reaches to the exact stoppage (a place between stopping rod and the last row of general stoppers), WHEEL &amp; AXLE is used as an effective remedy for this obstacle. To put the lower end of Suspension beam into exact stoppage, the hook attached to its load side is temporarily attached with adjusting cum suspending rod. Now, weights are continuously suspended to hooks of ropes passing through load puller, until lower end of suspension beam is pulled and put into the exact stoppage. Due to mechanical advantage of wheel &amp; axle, the heavier weights, like Suspension Beam could be easily pulled by much lighter weights suspended into load puller. The human or animal weight may also be used for this purpose and a lever may also be used, if required so.<br>

In this way, a "PENDULUM TRAIN " is made on more than one similar pendulums in longitudinal position made on equidistant both side fixed vertical pillars of same height placed at equal distance where each pendulum comprises of a suspension beam, made on from equidistance strips connected serially in lateral position vertically with the help of an upper most horizontal strip connected and swinging on suspension place fixed on both side vertical pillars.<br>
Comprising a joining car, a hollow cylinder like body containing two hollow similar joining cylinders in horizontal position with elongated scars on lower side horizontal position comprising joining hand in each cylinder a solid cylinder like body twice the length of hollow cylinder connected with operating handle by chain attached with middle downward position swinging in the lower sides, suspending in the middle of suspension beam by an adjusting cum suspending rod revolving on horizontal position.<br>
And comprised of vehicles comprising shock absorbers, room, balancing solid, four revolving wheels and a joining aperture the length of which one is equal to the half of the joining hand while the diameter is twice the diameter of joining hand, capable to move from one station to another nearby station through movement of suspension beam, where in the station the suspension beam is stopped by stoppers attached on pulling chambers and after connection of vehicle into suspension beam in between stopping rod and the last pulling chamber nearest to the middle of station where stopping rod is situated with the help of joining hands of the joining cars with the joining cones attached permanently to the lowest outside end of suspension beam internally.<br>
DISCONNECTION/CONNECTION PROCESS:<br>
As the lower ends of both the suspension beams swinging with the vehicles from opposite near by station come close on a certain station the disconnection/connection process is performed after adjustment of suspension beams, if required, with the help of wheel and axle. To understand this process clearly the help of figures 9,10 &amp; 11 are taken.<br>
Referring to figure 9, as the diameter of Joining Cars (JCS &amp; JCZ) are Y and diameter of Joining Apertures (JAS &amp; JAZ) are double than the diameter of a Joining Car (2Y) each and as the lower ends of two Suspension Beams come close.

Both Joining Hands (JHS) and (JHT) of Joining Car (JCS) are fitted with Joining Cones (SCS &amp; SCT) respectively through Joining Aperture (JAS) of vehicle (VS) of Suspension Beam (SBS). Joining Hands(JHY &amp; JHZ) of Joining Car (JCZ) are fitted with Joining Cones (SCY &amp; SCZ) respectively of Suspension Beam (SBZ) through Joining Aperture (JAZ) of vehicle (VZ) while Joining Cones (SCW &amp; SCX) of Suspension Beam (SBS) and Joining Cones (SCU &amp; SCV) of Suspension Beam (SBZ) are free.<br>

Referring to figure 10, Joining Hands (JHS) of Joining Car (JCS) of diameter (Y) suspending from Suspension Beam (SBS) is disconnected from Joining Cone (SCS) of Suspension Beam (SBS) and its other end is connected with Joining Cone (SCW) of same Suspension Beam through Joining Aperture (JAZ) of diameter (2Y) of vehicle (VZ). Joining Hand (JHZ), of Joining Car (JCZ) of diameter (Y) suspending from Suspension Beam (SBZ) is also disconnected from Joining Cone (SCZ) and its other end is connected with Joining Cone (SCV) of same Suspension Beam through Joining Aperture (JAS) of diameter (2Y) of vehicle (VS) Joining Hand (JHT) connected with Joining Cone (SCT) of Suspension Beam (SBS) and Joining Hand (JHY) connected with Joining Cone (SCY) of Suspension Beam (SBZ) would remain in their previous position while Joining Cone (SCX) of Suspension Beam (SBS) and Joining Cone (SCU) of Suspension Beam (SBZ) are free.<br>

Now Vehicle (VS) previously joined with Suspension Beam (SBS) is joined with Suspension Beam (SBZ) through Joining Aperture (JAS) and Vehicle (VZ) previously joined with Suspension Beam (SBZ) is joined with Suspension Beam (SBS) through Joining Aperture (JAZ). In this way, DISCONNECTION/CONNECTION process is completed and vehicle are ready to move next station. To understand clearly the movement of vehicle the help of figures 12&amp; 13 are to be taken.<br>
MOVEMENT OF VEHICLES:<br>
Referring to figure 12 &amp; 13, suppose, EF is the plane surface of earth. Pillars are so erected vertically on ground in a series (PA, PB, PC, PD...) that the distance of each suspension place (SPA, SPB, SPC, SPD...) would be the same and they would be in a horizontal straight line to the plain surface of the earth. Suspension beam are also suspended in a series (SBA, SBB, SBC, SBD...) The distance between the two station would be equal and conveniently be 1.2 to 1.3 times of the "DISTANCE BETWEEN SUSPENSION POINT TO LOWEST POINT OF SUSPENSION BEAMS" (or to the height of pillar). To understand better and scientifically the height of pillar are counted above GM level, a level very near and horizontal to the plane surface of earth EF, where the lowest point of suspension beam is touching in its inert stage, and making right angle to the surface of the earth.<br>
Stations are situated serially (STA, STB, STC, STD, STE...) in middle portion of two inert suspension beams,<br>
VA, VC... are UP (-&gt;) vehicles, while VB, VD... are DOWN (
Contd...p/16..<br><br>
- :16:-<br>
So , on anticlockwise movement of suspension beam, vehicle VA attached to SBA would reach to STB &amp; vehicle VC attached to SBC would reach to STD both to upside of the track, while on clockwise movement VB attached to SBB would reach to STB &amp; vehicle VD attached to SBD would reach to STD, both to downside of the track. In the upside(~&gt;) of track SBA detached VA on STB and attached VB to it. SBC detached VC on STD and attached VD to it. In downside (
SPEED :<br>
As we know, a pendulum is taking around one second in reaching one end to another end . A minor difference in fraction of second is visible only on alteration of effective height of pendulum. Hence, the lower ends of suspension beams are also taking around one second in reaching one station to another station.<br>
The only obstacle against SPEED OF VEHICLE is the time consumed in a station for DISCONNECTION/CONNECTION PROCESS and which one is assumed five seconds as a sufficient time for the purpose.<br>
Hence, it is calculated that PENDULUM TRAIN is capable to give minimum speed of 15 K.M./hour assuming five seconds required in each station for DISCONNECTION/ CONNECTION PROCESS through FORTY similar pendulums in each KILOMETER of TWENTY meter height. The SPEED could be further increased to give minimum speed of 30 KM/hour by making double the height of pendulums, i.e. FORTY METER through TWENTY similar pendulums in each KILOMETER.<br>
For urban areas the SPEED is good enough but for semi-urban areas or for long distances the lower number of pendulums of more height in the same ratio are to be used to increase the further SPEED of vehicles.<br>
As the SPEED of vehicle is also depend upon the time consumed in the process of DISCONNECTION/CONNECTION of the vehicles in the stations, so efficiency of this process amounts to better SPEED of the vehicles.<br>

Before moving the vehicles from one station to another station a DISCONNECTION/CONNECTION process is to be taken in a station when the lower ends of both the suspension beams swinging with vehicles from opposite nearby station come close on a certain station in the place between last pulling chamber nearest to the stopping rod and stopping rod situated in middle of station with the help of wheel and axle, load puller and common, human or animal weight with or without the help of lever, if required so, to disconnect vehicle from the suspension beam of last incoming station and join it to the joining cones of suspension beams of forthcoming station with the help of joining hands comprised into joining cylinders of joining car into the suspension beam of forthcoming station passing through the joining aperture of the vehicle.<br>
In this system DO\SCONNECTION/CONNECTION process has to be carried properly and quickly in each and every station to run vehicles swiftly from one end to another end.<br>
For running vehicles at the minimum speed of 15 K.M./hour Forty similar pendulums of 20 meter heights in each Kilometer are sufficient enough assuming DISSCONNECTION/CONNECTION process takes around five seconds en each station and this speed is suitable for urban areas like cities, towns, district head quarters, etc.<br>
But for long distance ( more than 50 KM) 20 similar pendulums of 40 meters height in each kilometer are required to give minimum speed of 30 K.M./hour assuming disconnection/connection process takes five seconds in each station.<br>
To increase further speed lower number of pendulums of more heights are required or the process should be so developed in due course enabling to take lower timing in disconnection/connection process.<br><br></td>
