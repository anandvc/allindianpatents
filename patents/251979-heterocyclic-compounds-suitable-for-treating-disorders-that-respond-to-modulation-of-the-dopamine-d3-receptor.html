				<td>HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS SUITABLE FOR TREATING DISORDERS THAT RESPOND TO MODULATION OF THE DOPAMINE D3 RECEPTOR<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds. The compounds possess valuable therapeutic properties and are suitable, in particular, for treating diseases that respond to modulation of the dopamlne D3 receptor.<br>
Neurons obtain their information by way of G protein-coupled receptors, inter alia. A large number of substances exert their effect by way of these receptors. One of them is dopamine. Confirmed findings exist with regard to the presence of dopamine and its physiological function as a neurotransmitter. Disorders in the dopaminergic transmitter system result in diseases of the central nervous system which include, for example, schizophrenia, depression and Parkinson's disease. These diseases, and others, are treated with drugs which interact with the dopamine receptors.<br>
Up until 1990, two subtypes of dopamine receptor had been clearly defined pharmacologically, namely the D1 and D2 receptors. More recently, a third subtype was found, namely the D3 receptor which appears to mediate some effects of antipsychotics and antiparkinsonians (J.C. Schwartz et al., The Dopamine D3 Receptor as a Target for Antipsychotics, in Novel Antipsychotic Drugs, H.Y. Meltzer, Ed. Raven Press, New York 1992, pages 135-144; M. Dooley et al., Drugs and Aging 1998, 12, 495-514, J.N. Joyce, Pharmacology and Therapeutics 2001, 90, pp. 231-59 "The Dopamine D3 Receptor as a Therapeutic Target for Antipsychotic and Antiparkinsonian Drugs").<br>
Since then, the dopamine receptors have been divided into two families. On the one hand, there is the D2 group, consisting of D2 D3 and D4 receptors, and, on the other hand, the D1 group, consisting of D1and D5 receptors. Whereas D1 and D2 receptors are widely distributed, D3 receptors appear to be expressed regioselectively. Thus, these receptors are preferentially to be found in the limbic system and the projection regions of the mesolimbic dopamine system, especially in the nucleus accumbens, but also in other regions, such as the amygdala. Because of this comparatively regioselec-tive expression, D3 receptors are regarded as being a target having few side-effects and it is assumed that while a selective D3 ligand would have the properties of known antipsychotics, it would not have their dopamine D2 receptor-mediated neurological side-effects (P. Sokoloff et al., Localization and Function of the D3 Dopamine Receptor,<br>
Arzneim. Forsch./Drua Res. 42(1), 224 (1992); P. Sokoloff et al. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel Dopamine Receptor (D3) as a Target for Neuroleptics, Nature. 347. 146(1990)).<br>
Compounds having an affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor have been described in the prior art on various occasions, e.g. in WO 95/04713, WO 96/23760, WO 97/45503, WO98/27081 and WO 99/58499. Some of these compounds possess moderate affinities and or selectivities for the dopamine D3 receptor. They have therefore been proposed as being suitable for treating diseases of the central nervous system. Some of the compounds described in these publications possess a pyrrolidinylphenyi structure. Unfortunately their affinity and selectivity towards the D3 receptor or their pharmacological profile are not satisfactory. Consequently there is an ongoing need to provide new compounds, which either have an high affinity and an improved selectivity. The compounds should also have good pharmacological profile, e.g. a high brain plasma ratio, a high bioavailability, good metabolic stability, or a decreased inhibition of the mitochondria! respiration.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>

Compounds I of the present invention can be synthesized as outlined in the synthetic routes A, B and C below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
a precursor of R1.<br>
Route A<br>
In route A, the amino compound (11-1) is reacted with a suitable sulfonic acid derivative to give the sulfonamide (1-1) (E = NH). A suitable sulfonic acid derivative is e.g. the sulfonyl chloride Ar-SO2CI. The sulfonation reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, according to standard procedures in the art. in the reaction depicted in the above scheme 1, the sulfonation takes place under the reaction conditions which are customary for preparing arylsulfonamide compounds or arylsulfonic esters, respectively, and which are described, for example, in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985 page 444ff and the literature cited therein, European J. Org. Chem. 2002 (13), pp. 2094-2108, Tetrahedron 2001, 57 (27) pp. 5885-5895, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2000,10(8), pp. 835-838 and Synthesis 2000 (1), pp. 103-108. The reaction customarily takes place in an inert solvent, for example in an ether, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, a halohydrocarbon, such as dichloro-methane, an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, such as pentane, hexane or cyclohexane, or an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene, xylene, cumene and the like, or in a mixture of the abovementioned solvents. The reaction with CI-SO2-Ar is<br>
customarily carried out in the presence of an auxiliary base. Suitable bases are inorganic bases, such as sodium arbonate or potassium arbonate, or sodium ydrogencar-bonate or potassium ydrogencarbonate, and organic bases, for example trialkylamines, such as triethylamine, or pyridine compounds, such as pyridine, lutidine and the like. The latter compounds can at the same time serve as solvents. The auxiliary base is customarily employed in at least equimolar quantities, based on the amine compound<br>
Prior to the sulfonation reaction, the radical NH2 can be converted into a NR6' group, in which R5' has the meanings different from hydrogen which are specified for R5 (not shown in scheme 1).<br>
if in the resulting sulfonamide (l'-1) R' is not the desired radical R1 but a precursor thereof, the compound can be modified as outlined below to obtain the desired sub-stituent R1. A precursor is a radical which can be easily removed and replaced by the desired group R1 or which can be modified to give R1. The precursor can also be an N-protective group.<br>
If R1 is allyl, the ally! group can be cleaved to obtain a compound wherein R' is hydrogen. The cleavage of the allyl group is achieved, for example, by reacting compound (l'-1) [R1 = allyl] with an allyl trapping agent, such as mercaptobenzoic acid or 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid, in the presence of catalytic quantities of palladium (0) compounds or palladium compounds which are able to form a palladium(O) compound under reaction conditions, e.g. palladium dichloride, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(O) or tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0), advantageously in combination with phosphine ligands, e.g. triarylphosphlnes, such as triphenylphosphine, trial-kylphosphines, such as tributylphosphine, and cycloalkylphosphines, such as tricyclo-hexyiphosphine, and especially with phosphine chelate ligands, such as 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl or 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane, using methods known from the literature (with regard to eliminating N-allyl in the presence of mercaptobenzoic acid, see WO 94/24088; with regard to eliminating in the presence of 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid, see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001,123 (28), pp. 6801-6808 and J. Org. Chem 2002, 67(11) pp. 3718-3723). Alternatively, the cleavage of N-allyl can also be effected by reacting in the presence of rhodium compounds, such as tris(triphenylphosphine)chlororhodium(l), using methods known from the literature (see J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Transaction I: Organic and Bio-Organic Chemistry 1999 (21) pp. 3089-3104 and Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1997, 8(20), pp. 3387 - 3391).<br>
If R' is benzyl, this substituent may also be cleaved to obtain a compund (P-1) wherein R1 is H. The reaction conditions for the cleavage are known in the art. Typically, the benzyl group is removed by a hydrogenation reaction in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst, such as Pd on carbon or palladium ydroxide.<br>
R1 can also be a protective group. The protective group may be removed to yield a compund (l'-1) wherein R' is H. Suitable protective groups are known in the art and are, for example, selected from tert-butoxycarbonyl (boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), triphenylmethyl (Trt) and nitrobenzenesulfenyl (Nps). A preferred protective group is boc. The protective groups can be removed by known methods, such as treatment of the protected amine with an acid, e.g halogen acid, such as HCI or HBr, or trifluoroacetic acid, or by hydrogenation, optionally in the presence of a Pd catalyst.<br>
The resulting compound, wherein R1 is H, can then be reacted, in a known manner, in the sense of an alkylation, with a compound R1-X. In this compound, R1 is d-C4-alkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, CrC4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy-C1-C4-alkyl or C3-C6-cycloalkyl-CrC4-alkyl and X is a nucleophilically displaceable leaving group, e.g. halogen, trifluoroace-tate, alkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate, alkyl sulfate and the like. The reaction conditions which are required for the alkylation have been adequately disclosed, e.g. in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Lett. 2002,12(7), pp. 2443-2446 and also 2002, 12(5), pp. 1917-1919.<br>
The alkylation can also be achieved, in the sense of a reductive amination, by reacting the compound (l'-1), wherein R1 = H, with a suitable ketone or aldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent, e.g. in the presence of a borohydride such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. The skilled person is familiar with the reaction conditions which are required for a reductive amination, e.g. from Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Lett. 2002,12(5), pp. 795-798 and 12(7) pp. 1269-1273.<br>
In case R' is hydrogen, the resulting sufonamide (l'-1) can further be reacted with an acyl halide to obtain a compound of the formula I wherein R1 is d-C3-alkylcarbonyl. The carbonyl group in these compounds can be reduced with diborane to obtain compounds of the general formula I, wherein R1 is C2-C4-alkyl. The carbonyl group can also be reacted with a fluorinating agent to obtain a compound I wherein R1 is 1,1-<br><br>
difluoroalkyl. Acylation and reduction can be achieved by standard methods, which are discussed in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed. J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1985, p.370 and 373 (acylation) and p. 1099 f. and in the literature cited in this publication (with regard to acylation, see also Synth. Commun. 1986,16, p. 267, and with regard to reduction, see also J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1979,16, p. 1525).<br>
Route B<br>
In route B, the bromo substituted compound (II-2) is reacted with an appropriate sul-fonamide ArSO2NHR5 to give the sulfonamide (l'-1). The reaction is generally carried out under activating conditions, e.g. under microwave conditions. Pd, especially Pd(0), or Cu catalysts may also be used for coupling (see, e.g. Org. Lett. 2000, 2,1101; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 6043; Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 4373; Tetrahedron Lett. 2003, 44, 3385). Examples for suitable Pd (0) catalysts are tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(O) and Pd2(dba)3 (tris(dibenzylideneacetone) -dipalladium(O)), which are customarily used in the presence of a tri(substituted)phosphine, e.g. a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine, tritolylphosphine or xantphos, tri(cyclo)alkylphosphine such as tris-n-butylphosphine, tris(tert.-butyl)phosphine or tris(cyclohexylphosphine). This route is especially useful in cases where the corresponding sulfonyl chloride is not available.<br>
Alternatively, the bromo substituent may be replaced by an amino substituent, e.g. by reacting with a benzophenone imine or with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in the presence of a palladium(O) compound such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) in the presence of a tri(substituted)phosphine, e.g. a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine or tritolylphosphine, tri(cyclo)alkylphosphine such as tris-n-butylphosphine, tris(tert.-butyl)phosphine or tris(cyclohexylphosphine), preferably in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride according to the method described in (see, e.g. J. Org. Chem., 68 (2993) pp 8274-8276, J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 2612). The resulting amino compound may then be subjected to the sulfonation reaction of route A.<br>
Route C<br>
In route C, compound (II-3) is reacted with a mercapto compound HS-Ar in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride or sodium alkoxide or with an alkali metal salt thereof thereby yielding a thioether compound. The thioether moiety is then oxidized to a sulfone moiety, e.g. by oxone, to yield the sulfone (l'-2).<br>
The substituent Ar can be varied by either using different sulfonyl chlorides or by modifying the substituents of the cyclic group Ar after the formation of the sulfonamide (I'-1) by known methods. For example, a bromine substituent of the Ar group may be replaced by an N-bound pyrrolidinyl group according to the procedure described in Tetrahedron Asym. 1 999, 10,1 831 . A bromine substituent of the Ar group may be replaced by an isopropenyl group according to a Stille coupling where the bromo compound is reacted with an alkenyl tributyl stannate in the presence of an appropriate Pd coupling catalyst, e.g. tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium(O) (see, e.g. Tetrahedron, 2003, 59(34), 6545 and Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999, 7(5), 665). The isopropenyl group may then be converted into the isopropyl group by known hydrogenation methods.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) (11-1, II-2 and II-3) can be synthesized by as shown below. 1. Synthesis of compounds (11-1) Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In scheme 2, A, G, n and R' are as defined above.<br>
The conversion of the acid (III) into its methyl ester (IV) is performed by standard techniques, e.g. as described in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley, 3rd edition, page 348ff. For instance, the acid is transformed into the corresponding acid chloride, e.g by reacting it with SOCI2. The chloride is then converted into the ester by reaction with methanol.<br>
The reduction in step (ii) is suitably carried out under standard conditions for the conversion of carboxylic esters into alcohols. Appropriate reaction conditions and reducing agents are described, e.g. in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley, 3rd edition, page1093ff. Typical reducing agents are rnetal hydrides and complex hydrides. Examples of suitable metal hydrides include BH3, 9-BBN, AIH3 and AIH(i-Bu)2 (DIBAL-H), suitably in the presence of complexing solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and diethylether. Complex hydrides are e.g. NaBH4, LiAIH4 and LiAIH(OR)3, where R is Ci-C4-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, isobutyl or tert-butyl. A preferred reducing agent is LiAIH4. The reduction is suitably carried out in complexing solvents, such as open-chain and cyclic ethers, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether and methylbutyl ether. A preferred solvent is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In the mesylation step (Hi), the alcohol functionality is converted into a better leaving group. The mesylation is performed under standard conditions, e.g. by reacting the alcohol with methansulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base. Suitable bases are, among others, alkyl amines, such as diethyl amine, triethyl amine and ethyldiisopropyl amine. In this step, other functionalties representing good leaving groups, such as trifluoroacetate, other alkylsulfonates, arylsulfonates, e.g. tosylates, alkyl sulfates and the like tosylate, may be introduced instead of the methansulfonyl group.<br>
In the cyclisation step (iv), compound (VI) or a suitable derivative thereof is reacted with a primary amine NH2R'. In case the primary amine is a liquid, it may also be used as solvent, no further solvent being necessary. If the amine is visquous or a solid, the reaction is advantageously carried out in a suitable solvent.<br>
The reaction of step (v) takes place under the reaction conditions which are customary for a nitration reaction on an aromatic radical and which are described, for example, in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley, 3rd edition, page 468ff, Tetrahedron 1999, 55(33), pp. 10243-10252, J. Med. Chem.  1997, 40(22), pp. 3679-3686 and Synthetic Communications, 1993, 23(5), pp. 591-599. For example, compound (VII) is reacted with concentrated nitric acid or a nitrate, such as potassium or sodium nitrate, in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting product (VIII) may in the form of different regioisomers (e.g. ortho, meta or para, if A is phenyl or a 6-membered hetaryl. In the case of A being phenyl or a 6-membered hetaryl, the para-nitro compound generally predominates. However, some ortho product may also be obtained, whereas the meta product is not produced at all or only in neglectable<br>
amounts. By separating ortho and para products, compounds of formula I, wherein A is 1,4-bound aryl or hetaryl as well as compounds I, wherein A is 1,2-bound aryl or hetarly, are accessible via the reaction path shown in scheme 2.<br>
In step (vi), the nitro group in (VIII) is reduced to an NH2 group. Subsequently, the NH2 group can be converted into a -NR5' group, in which R5' has the meanings different from hydrogen which are specified for R5. The reaction conditions which are required for step (vi) correspond to the customary conditions for reducing aromatic nitro groups which have been described extensively in the literature (see, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New-York, 1985, p. 1183 and the literature cited in this reference). The reduction is achieved, for example, by reacting the nitro compound VII with a metal such as iron, zinc or tin under acidic reaction conditions, i.e. using nascent hydrogen, or using a complex hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride, preferably in the presence of transition metal compounds of nickel or cobalt such as NiCI2(P(phenyl)3)2, or CoCI2,(see Ono et al. Chem. Ind. (London), 1983 p.480), or using NaBH2S3 (see Lalancette et al. Can. J. Chem. 49,1971, p. 2990), with it being possible to carry out these reductions, depending on the given reagent, in substance or in a solvent or diluent. Alternatively, the reduction can be carried out with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, e.g. using hydrogen in the presence of catalysts based on platinum, palladium, nickel, ruthenium or rhodium. The catalysts can contain the transition metal in elemental form or in the form of a complex compound, of a salt or of an oxide of the transition metal, with it being possible, for the purpose of modifying the activity, to use customary coli-gands, e.g. organic phosphine compounds, such as triphenylphosphine, tricyclohexyl-phosphine or tri-n-butylphosphines or phosphites. The catalyst is customarily employed in quantities of from 0.001 to 1 mol per mol of nitro compound, calculated as catalyst metal. In a preferred variant, the reduction is effected using tin(ll) chloride in analogy with the methods described in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2002, 12(15), pp. 1917-1919 and J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(21), pp. 4679-4688. The reaction of VII with tin(ll) chloride is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, preferably an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or butanol.<br>
For compounds, wherein n is 1 and A is phenylene (i.e. (I) is N-(pyrrolidin-3-yl)-phenyl-sulfonamide), starting compound (III) is e.g. commercially available (S) or (R) phenyl-succinic acid or a racemic mixture thereof. By starting from enantiomerically pure (S)-or (R)-compound (III), pure (S)- or (R) may be obtained:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In step (i), commercially available (S)-phenylsuccinic acid (II-S) is converted into the the methyl ester (III); this is reduced to the alcohol (IV) which is reacted with methylsul-fonylchloride. Cyclisation with a primary amlne gives the phenyl pyrrolidine (VI). The phenyl group is first nitrated, then the nitro group is reduced to an amino function which is reacted with a sulfonyl chloride to give the desired sulfonyl amide (I'-S).<br>
a)      (R) isomer<br>
The (R)-isomer can be obtained in an analogous way starting from commercially available (R)-phenylsuccinic acid (III-R):<br><br>

c) Isomeric mixtures<br>
Isomeric mixtures of compound I'-S and I'-R can be obtained by starting from racemic III or from a mixture of III-S and lll-R.<br><br>
The skilled person will appreciate that the synthesis described in scheme 2 is also suitable for the preparation of compounds (II) and consequently for compounds (I), wherein R2, R3 and R4 are different from H, e.g. by starting from the correspondingly substituted compound (III). The same applies to the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (I) which can be synthesized by starting from the corresponding enantiomer (III).<br>
2.	Synthesis of compounds (11-2)<br>
Compounds of formula (11-2) can be synthesized by carrying out in step (v) of scheme 2 a halogenation instead of a nitration. Halogenation reactions of aryl and hetaryl groups are widespread standard methods and are, e.g., discussed in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley, 3rd edition page 476 ff.<br>
3.	Synthesis of compounds (11-3)<br>
The synthesis of these compounds also belongs to standard reaction methods and can be performed by monohalogenating the methyl group of a methyl-substituted aryl or hetaryl compound.<br>
4.	Specific syntheses<br>
4.1 Synthesis of compounds, wherein n is 5 (pyrrolidinyl sulfone derivatives)<br>
4.1.1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In scheme 3, A and R3 are as defined above.<br>
The pyrrolidine ring is also available by a [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition of a non-stabilized azomethine ylid to a 1-alkenylaryl or hetaryl derivative (IX) (e.g. a vinyl benzene, R3 = H). This procedure is generally described in J. Org. Chem 1987, 52, 235. The precursor of the ylid, the amine N(CH2Rb)(CH2SiMe3)(CH2OCH3) (X), is commercially available or can be synthesized from NH2(CH2Rb), Me3SICH2CI and HCHO in the presence of methanol.<br>
The 1-alkenyl-(hetero)aromatic compound (IX) can be synthesized e.g. by a Stille coupling of a halogeno benzene, e.g. a bromo benzene, with the corresponding alkenyl tributyl stannate, such as vinyl or isobutenyl tributyl stannate, in the presence of an appropriate Pd coupling catalyst, e.g. tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium(O) (see, e.g. Tetrahedron, 2003, 59(34), 6545 and Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999, 7(5), 665). By choosing a special Stille isomer (e.g. cis- or trans-isobutenyl tributyl stannate), the corresponding cis- or trans alkyl phenyl pyrrolidine can be prepared selectively.<br>
Alternatively, the 1-alkenyl-(hetero)aromatic compound (IX) can be synthesized by a Wittig reaction of aryl aldehyde with a Wittig reagent such as PPh3=CHR (R is H, or Cr C3-alkyl). Conditions for the Wittig reaction are well known in the art and are, e.g. discussed in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley, 3rd edition, page 845 ff.<br>
Advantageously, the 1-(hetero)alkenyl-aromatic compound (IX) further carries a nitro group or another halogeno substituent (X = NO2 or halogen). In this case, the subsequent reaction steps can be carried out as outlined In route A or B. If X = H, the A ring may be first nitrated as described in scheme 2, step (v) and then subjected to the reaction of scheme 2, step (vi) and scheme 1, route A; or ring A may be halogenated and then subjected to the procedure of route B.<br>
The group CH2Rb of the precursor amine advantageously corresponds either to the desired group R1 of the final compound I or is alternatively a cleavable group, such as benzyl, which can be removed to give the N-unsubstituted pyrrolidine. The latter can subsequently be functionalized as described above (see route A).<br>
The synthesis of hetarylpyrrolidines is e.g. described in Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1985, 33, 2762-66; J. Heterocyclic Chemistry, 1996,1995-2005; J. Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2001, 38, 1039-1044; Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 33, 44, 6607-10; Heterocycles, 1998, 48,<br>
12, 2535-2541 for A being pyridylene. The synthesis of vinyl-substituted thiophene and thiazol is e.g. described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999, 7(5), 665.<br>
4.1.2 Scheme (Figure Removed)<br><br>
Phenylpyrrolidines can also be prepared by a [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition of a non-stabilized azomethine ylid to a 1-alkynylbenzene (XII) (see, e.g., Tetrahedron 1996, 52, 59). The resulting pyrroline (XIII) or the final product (I') is then hydrogenated to the corresponding pyrrolidine (XI). If the hydrogenation is carried out under chiral conditions, e.g. by using chiral catalysts, the enantiomerically pure phenylpyrrolidine compounds can be obtained. Chiral hydrogenation catalysts are well known in the art. The subsequent conversion to the desired sulfonamide can be carried out as described in route A or B.<br>
4.1.3<br>
Alternatively, hetarylpyrrolidinyl compounds can be prepared from hetaryl halides which are subjected to a Pd-mediated cross coupling with an organozinc pyrrolidine compound. This process is described in further detail below in route F. In this alternative, too, the hetaryl halide advantageously carries a nitro group. In this case, the conversion to the desired sulfonamides can be carried out as described in route A. Alternatively, the hetaryl halide carries a halogen atom. In this case, the conversion to the desired sulfonamides can be achieved as described in route B.<br>
4.1.4<br>
Compounds I, wherein n is 1, G is CH2, A is 1,3-bound arylene or hetarlyene and E is NH, can be prepared in a similar way compared to the 1,4-bound compound from a 3-aminoaryl or hetaryl-pyrrolidine which is reacted with an appropriate sulfonyl chloride. Advantageously, the N-atom of the pyrrolidine ring is protected by a urathane-based<br>
protective group, like benzyloxycarbonyl (cbz) and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (boc). This group may be replaced by the desired substituent R1 by treating the compound with an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, thus removing the acid group, and then introducing the desired substituent as described in route A.<br>
The 3-aminoaryl or hetaryl-pyrrolidine may be prepared by way of a Heck reaction where a protected pyrroline is reacted with 1-iodo-3-nitrobenzene under typical Heck conditions. Catalytic hydrogenation of the pyrroline double bond and reduction of the nitro group according to the procedure described in scheme 2 yields the desired product.<br>
4.2 Synthesis of N-(azetidin-3-yl)-sulfonamides<br>
Compounds I, wherein n is 0 (azetidine compounds) can be synthesized as follows:<br>
Scheme 5:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In scheme 5, Ar and R1 are as defined above. X and Y are, independently of each other, CH or N.<br>
Starting from 1-benzhydryl-azetidin-3-ol, Pd-mediated deprotection of the amine (Tetrahedron 2002, 58, 9865-9870), carbamate formation and subsequent halogenation generate an intermediate that undergoes Zn Insertion (Tetrahedron 1987,43,2203-2212; J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 2390-2392). The thus obtained organozinc species can react with an appropriate 2-halo-nitro-ring (Synlett 1998, 4,379-380; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 12527-12530) to give the nitro-aryl-azetidine core. If one utilizes a 2-haio-halo-ring, there is also the possibility to realize the direct coupling between the aryl-azetidine halide and the appropriate sulfonamides (Org. Lett. 2000, 2,1101-1104; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002,124, 6043-6048; Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 4373-4376; Tetrahedron Lett. 2003,44, 3385-3386). The amine may be regenerated by cleavage of the carbamate (e.g. with trifluoroacetic acid in the case of a Boc carbamate) and subsequently converted into an amide by reaction with the appropriate acyl chloride. The nitro group can be reduced to the amine via tin chloride or catalytic hydrogenation (e.g. Pd-C) and then converted to the desired sulfonamide by reaction with the appropriate suifonyl chloride in the presence of a base such as pyridine. Ultimate reduction of the amide via hydroboration furnishes the final compounds.<br>
Of course, the reaction also applies to compounds wherein the (hetero)aromatic ring bound to thr azetidine group is a 5-membered heterocyclic radical, e.g. thienyl.<br>
4.3 Synthesis of N-(piperidin-3-yl)-sulfonamides<br>
Further to the above-described syntheses (routes A, B and C), compounds I, wherein n is 2 and E is NR5 (piperidin-3-yl sulfonamides) may be prepared by starting from commercially available 3-aryl or 3-hetaryl piperidines. These starting compounds may then be converted into the amino-substituted or halogenated derivative and then be subjected to the synthetic path of route A or B.<br>
A skilled person will readily appreciate that compopunds of the formula I can also be obtained from structurally similar compounds by functional group interconversion. In particular N-bound radicals Ra can be introduced into compounds of the formula I by reacting the corresponding halogen compound, i.e. a compound of the formula I, which instead of Ra carries a halogen atom, in particular a bromine or iodine atom, with a pri-<br><br>
mary or secondary amine in the presence of a base, preferably also in the presence of a palladium catalyst in terms of a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction.<br>
If not indicated otherwise, the above-described reactions are generally carried out in a solvent at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling temperature of the solvent employed. Alternatively, the activation energy which is required for the reaction can be introduced into the reaction mixture using microwaves, something which has proved to be of value, in particular, in the case of the reactions catalyzed by transition metals (with regard to reactions using microwaves, see Tetrahedron 2001, 57, p. 9199 ff. p. 9225 ff. and also, in a general manner, "Microwaves in Organic Synthesis", Andr6 Loupy (Ed.), Wiley-VCH 2002.<br>
The sulfonylchlorides CI-SO2-Ar are either commercially available or can be prepared according to standard synthetic methods. Sulfonylchlorides containing a fluorinated radical Ra may be prepared by different synthetic routes, e.g. by reacting suitable hydroxy or oxo precursor (e.g. a compound CI-SO2-Ar, carrying a hydroxy or oxo substituted radical) with fluorinating reagents like DAST (diethylaminosulfurtrifluoride), mor-pholine-DAST, deoxo-fluor (bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride), Ishikawa's reagent (N,N-diethyl-(1,1I2l3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl)amine; Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 1989, 43, 371-377). More conventionally, the hydroxy group of an aromatic compound which carries a hydroxy substituted radical but not a chlorosulfonyl group, is transformed into a leaving group which is then replace by a fluoride ion (J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 2898-22901; Tetrahedron Letters, 1998, 7305-6; J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63, 9587-9589, Synthesis, 1987, 920-21)). Subsequent direct chlorosulfonylation with chlo-rosulfonic acid (Heterocycles, 2001, 55, 9,1789-1803; J. Org. Chem., 2000, 65,1399-1406) or a two step process preparing first the sulfonic acid derivatives which are then transformed to the sulfonylchlorides with e.g. chlorosulfonic acid, phosphorous penta-chloride (Eur. J. Med. Chem., 2002, 36, 809-828) and the like, yields the desired sul-fonylchloride (Tetrahedron Letters, 1991, 33,507787-7788)) Sulfonylchlorides may also be prepared by diazotation of suitable amine precursor Ar-NH2 with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions and reaction with sulfur dioxide in acetic acid (scheme (iii); J. Org. Chem., 1960, 25,1824-26;); by oxidation of suitable heteroaryl-thiols HS-Ar or heteroaryl-benzyl-thioethers CeH5-CH2-S-Ar with chlorine (Synthesis, 1998, 36-38; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1950, 74, 4890-92;) directly to the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides. The further are known in the art or may be prepared by standard methods. E.g. mer-capto-pyrimidines or pyrimidinyl-benzylthioether precursors can e.g. be prepared according to literature (Chemische Berichte, 1960, 1208-11; Chemische Berichte, 1960,<br>
95, 230-235; Collection Czechoslow. Chem. Comm., 1959, 24, 1667-1671; Austr. J. Chem., 1966,19, 2321-30; Chemiker-Zeitung, 101, 6, 1977, 305-7; Tetrahedron, 2002, 58, 887-890; Synthesis, 1983, 641-645).<br>
In the following schemes 6 to 8 several routes are shown which are suitable to prepare benzenesulfonyl chlorides carrying a fluorinated propyl radical.<br>
Scheme 6:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
The4-(1,1-difluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonyl chloride intermediate can be prepared from the commercially available 2-phenylpropanoic acid. In the first step a) the 2-phenylpropanic acid is converted to the alkyl ester by esterification with an alcohol (e.g. methanol or ethanol) under acid catalysis (e.g. HCI, SO2CI2). The ester can be reduced to the corresponding 2-phenyl propanal by a reducing agent such as DIBAL (diisobutylaluminium hydride). The aldehyde is converted to the 1,1-difluoro-2-propyl derivative by reaction with a suitable fluorinating reagent like DAST (diethylaminosul-furtrifluoride), morpholine-DAST, deoxo-fluor (bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride), Ishikawa's reagent (N,N-diethyl-(1,1,2,3,3,3~hexafluoropropyl)amine; Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 1989, 43, 371-377) (step b). The thus obtained 1,1-difluoro-2-phenylpropane can be converted into 4-(1,1-difluoro-2-propyl)benzenesu!fonyl chloride by either direct chlorosulfonylation with chlorosulfonic acid (Heterocycles, 2001, 55, 9, 1789-1803; J. Org. Chem., 2000, 65,1399-1406) (step c) or by a two step process preparing first the sulfonic acid derivatives (step d) which are then transformed to the sulfonylchlorides (step e) by reaction with e.g. chlorosulfonic acid, phosphorous pentachloride (Eur. J. Med. Chem., 2002, 36, 809-828); through diazotisation of suitable amine precursors with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions and reaction with sulfur dioxide in acetic acid (J. Org. Chem., 1960, 25, 1824-26); oxidation of suitable<br>
heteroaryl-thiols or heteroaryl-benzyl-thioethers with chlorine (Synthesis, 1998, 36-38; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1950, 74, 4890-92) directly to the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
The synthesis shown in scheme 6 can also be performed using (R)-2-phenylpropanic acid and (S)-2-phenylpropanic acid respectively to give the corresponding chiral 4-(1,1-difluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1 -sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
Scheme 7:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
4-(1,1,1-Trifluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonyl chloride intermediate can be prepared from the commercially available 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-phenylethanone by a synthetic route shown in scheme 7. The ketone can be converted to the 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-phenylpropene by a Wittig reaction with a suitable ylide such as methylene-triphenylphosphane (prepared by reaction of methyltriphenylphosphonium halide and a suitable base such as lithium diisopropylamide or potassium tert-butoxide) or according to a Horner-Emmons reaction by reacting the ketone with a suitable phosphonate such as diethyl methylphosphonate and a suitable suitable base such as lithium diisopropylamide or potassium tert-butoxide. The thus obtained 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-phenylpropene can then be reduced to the saturated alkane by catalytic hydrogenation (eg Pd-C) followed by conversion to the sulfonyl chloride by the methods described in scheme 6.<br>
The synthesis of scheme 7 can also be performed using a chiral catalyst for the alkene hydrogenation to allow the preparation of the corresponding chiral 4-(1,1,1-triifluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1 -sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
Scheme 8: (Figure Removed)<br>
The 4-(1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-yl)benzene-1-sulfonyl chloride can be also prepared from the commercially available 1-phenyl-ethanone by a four step procedure as shown in scheme 8. The ketone can be converted to the trifluoromethyl hydroxyl intermediate by reaction with trimethyl-trifluoromethyl-silane (Journal of Organic Chemistry, 2000, 65, 8848-8856; Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, 2003, 122, 243-246) which can then be converted to the trifluoromethyl bromide (Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1987, 109, 2435-4). Dehalogenation by catalytic hydrogenation (eg Pd-C) can then be followed by conversion to the sulfonyl chloride by the methods discussed above.<br>
Examples of solvents which can be used are ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, aprotic polar solvent, such as dimethyl-formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethoxyethane, and acetonitrile, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene, ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, halohydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane and dichloroethane, esters, such as ethyl acetate and methyl butyrate, carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid or propionic acid, and alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, 2-butanol and tert.-butariol.<br>
If desired, it is possible for a base to be present in order to neutralize protons which are released in the reactions. Suitable bases include inorganic bases, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate, and, in addition, alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride, and also organometallic compounds, such as butyliithium compounds or alkylmagnesium compounds, or organic nitrogen bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The latter compounds can at the same time serve as solvents.<br>
The crude product is isolated in a customary manner, for example by filtering, distilling off the solvent or extracting from the reaction mixture, etc. The resulting compounds<br>
can be purified in a customary manner, for exampie by means of recrystallizing from a solvent, by means of chromatography or by means of converting into an acid addition salt.<br>
The acid addition salts are prepared in a customary manner by mixing the free base with a corresponding acid, where appropriate in solution in an organic solvent, for example a lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, an ether, such as methyl tert-butyl ether or diisopropyl ether, a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
The compounds according to the invention of the formula I are surprisingly highly selective dopamine D3 receptor ligands which, because of their low affinity for other receptors such as DT receptors, D4 receptors, a1-adrenergic and/or a2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinergic receptors, histamine receptors, opiate receptors and, in particular, dopamine D2 receptors, give rise to fewer side-effects than do the classic neuroleptics, which are D2 receptor antagonists. A compound of the invention can be a dopamine D3 receptor agonist, including partial agonistic activity, or a dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, including partial antagonistic activity.<br>
The high affinity of the compounds according to the invention for D3 receptors is reflected in very low in-vitro receptor binding constants (K|(D3) values) of as a rule less than 50 nM (nmol/l), preferably of less than 10 nM and, in particular of less than 5 nM. The displacement of [125l]-iodosulpride can, for example, be used in receptor binding studies for determining binding affinities for D3 receptors.<br>
The selectivity of the compounds according to the invention, i.e. the ratio Kj(D2)/Ki(D3} of the receptor binding constants, is as a rule at least 50, preferably at least 100, even better at least 150. The displacement of [3H]SCH23390, [125I] iodosulpride or [125I] spiperone can be used, for example, for carrying out receptor binding studies on D1f D2 and D4 receptors.<br>
Because of their binding profile, the compounds can be used for treating diseases which respond to dopamine D3 receptor ligands (or which are susceptible to treatment with a dopamine D3 receptor ligand, respectively), i.e. they are effective for treating those medical disorders or diseases in which exerting an influence on (modulating) the dopamine D3 receptors leads to an improvement in the clinical picture or to the disease<br>
being cured. Examples of these diseases are disorders or diseases of the central nervous system.<br>
Disorders or diseases of the central nervous system are understood as meaning disorders which affect the spinal chord and, in particular, the brain. Within the meaning of the invention, the term "disorder" denotes disturbances and/or anomalies which are as a rule regarded as being pathological conditions or functions and which can manifest themselves in the form of particular signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. While the treatment according to the invention can be directed toward individual disorders, i.e. anomalies or pathological conditions, it is also possible for several anomalies, which may be causatively linked to each other, to be combined into patterns, i.e. syndromes, which can be treated in accordance with the invention.<br>
The disorders which can be treated in accordance with the invention are, in particular, psychiatric and neurological disturbances. These disturbances include, In particular, organic disturbances, including symptomatic disturbances, such as psychoses of the acute exogenous reaction type or attendant psychoses of organic or exogenous cause, e.g., in association with metabolic disturbances, infections and endocrinopathogies; endogenous psychoses, such as schizophrenia and schizotype and delusional disturbances; affective disturbances, such as depressions, mania and/or manic-depressive conditions; and also mixed forms of the above-described disturbances; neurotic and somatoform disturbances and also disturbances in association with stress; dissociative disturbances, e.g. loss of consciousness, clouding of consciousness, double consciousness and personality disturbances; disturbances in attention and waking/sleeping behavior, such as behavioral disturbances and emotional disturbances whose onset lies in childhood and youth, e.g. hyperactivity in children, intellectual deficits, in particular attention disturbances (attention deficit disorders), memory disturbances and cognitive disturbances, e.g. impaired learning and memory (impaired cognitive function), dementia, narcolepsy and sleep disturbances, e.g. restiess legs syndrome; development disturbances; anxiety states, delirium; sexlife disturbances, e.g. impotence in men; eating disturbances, e.g. anorexia or bulimia; addiction; and other unspecified psychiatric disturbances.<br>
The disorders which can be treated in accordance with the invention also include Parkinson's disease and epilepsy and, in particular, the affective disturbances connected thereto.<br>
The addiction diseases include psychic disorders and behavioral disturbances which are caused by the abuse of psychotropic substances, such as Pharmaceuticals or narcotics, and also other addiction diseases, such as addiction to gaming (impulse control disorders not elsewhere classified). Examples of addictive substances are: opioids (e.g. morphine, heroin and codeine), cocaine; nicotine; alcohol; substances which interact with the GABA chloride channel complex, sedatives, hypnotics and tranquiiizers, for example benzodiazepines; LSD; cannabinoids; psychomotor stimulants, such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (ecstasy); amphetamine and amphetamine-like substances such as methylphenidate and other stimulants including caffeine. Addictive substances which come particularly into consideration are opioids, cocaine, amphetamine or amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol.<br>
With regard to the treatment of addiction diseases, particular preference is given to those compounds according to the invention of the formula I which themselves do not possess any psychotropic effect This can also be observed in a test using rats, which, after having been administered compounds which can be used in accordance with the invention, reduce their self administration of psychotropic substances, for example cocaine.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for treating disorders whose causes can at least partially be attributed to an anomalous activity of dopamine D3 receptors.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the treatment is directed, in particular, toward those disorders which can be influenced, within the sense of an expedient medicinal treatment, by the binding of preferably exogeneously administered binding partners (ligands) to dopamine D3 receptors.<br>
The diseases which can be treated with the compounds according to the invention are frequently characterized by progressive development, i.e. the above-described conditions change over the course of time; as a rule, the severity increases and conditions may possibly merge into each other or other conditions may appear in addition to those which already exist.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used to treat a large number of signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions which are connected with the disorders of the central nervous system and, in particular, the abovementioned conditions. These signs,<br><br>
symptoms and/or malfunctions include, for example, a disturbed relationship to reality, lack of insight and ability to meet customary social norms or the demands made by life, changes in temperament, changes in individual drives, such as hunger, sleep, thirst, etc., and in mood, disturbances in the ability to observe and combine, changes in personality, in particular emotional lability, hallucinations, ego-disturbances, distracted-ness, ambivalence, autism, depersonalization and false perceptions, delusional ideas, chanting speech, lack of synkinesia, short-step gait, flexed posture of trunk and iimbs, tremor, poverty of facial expression, monotonous speech, depressions, apathy, impeded spontaneity and decisiveness, impoverished association ability, anxiety, nervous agitation, stammering, social phobia, panic disturbances, withdrawal symptoms in association with dependency, maniform syndromes, states of excitation and confusion, dysphoria, dyskinetic syndromes and tic disorders, e.g. Huntington's chorea and Gilles-de-la-Tourette's syndrome, vertigo syndromes, e.g. peripheral positional, rotational and oscillatory vertigo, melancholia, hysteria, hypochondria and the like.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, a treatment also includes a preventive treatment (prophylaxis), in particular as relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis, as well as the treatment of acute or chronic signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. The treatment can be orientated symptomatically, for example as the suppression of symptoms. It can be effected over a short period, be orientated over the medium term or can be a long-term treatment, for example within the context of a maintenance therapy.<br>
Therefore the compounds according to the invention are preferentially suitable for treating diseases of the central nervous system, in particular for treating affective disorders; neurotic disturbances, stress disturbances and somatoform disturbances and psychoses, and, in particular, for treating schizophrenia and depression. Because of their high selectivity with regard to the Da receptor, the compounds I according to the invention are also suitable for treating disturbances of kidney function, in particular disturbances of kidney function which are caused by diabetes mellitus (see WO 00/67847) and, especially, diabetic nephropathy.<br>
Within the context of the treatment, the use according to the invention of the described compounds involves a method. In this method, an effective quantity of one or more compounds, as a rule formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical and veterinary practice, is administered to the individual to be treated, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Whether such a treatment is indicated, and in which form it is to take place, depends on the individual case<br>
and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) which takes into consideration signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions which are present, the risks of developing particular signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions, and other factors.<br>
As a rule, the treatment is effected by means of single or repeated daily administration, where appropriate together, or alternating, with other active compounds or active compound-containing preparations such that a daily dose of preferably from about 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg of bodyweight, in the case of oral administration, or of from about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of bodyweight, in the case of parenteral administration, is supplied to an individual to be treated.<br>
The invention also relates to the production of pharmaceutical compositions for treating an individual, preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Thus, the ligands are customarily administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient together with at least one compound according to the invention and, where appropriate, other active compounds. These compositions can, for example, be administered orally, rectally, transdermally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly or intranasally.<br>
Examples of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are solid medicinal forms, such as powders, granules, tablets, in particular film tablets, lozenges, sachets, cachets, sugar-coated tablets, capsules, such as hard gelatin capsules and soft gelatin capsules, suppositories or vaginal medicinal forms, semisolid medicinal forms, such as ointments, creams, hydrogels, pastes or plasters, and also liquid medicinal forms, such as solutions, emulsions, in particular oil-in-water emulsions, suspensions, for example lotions, injection preparations and infusion preparations, and eyedrops and eardrops. Implanted release devices can also be used for administering inhibitors according to the invention. In addition, it is also possible to use liposomes or microspheres.<br>
When producing the compositions, the compounds according to the invention are optionally mixed or diluted with one or more excipients. Excipients can be solid, semisolid or liquid materials which serve as vehicles, carriers or medium for the active compound.<br>
Suitable excipients are listed in the specialist medicinal monographs. In addition, the formulations can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or customary auxiliary substances, such as glidants; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; pre-<br>
servatives; antioxidants; antiirritants; chelating agents; coating auxiliaries; emulsion stabilizers; film formers; gel formers; odor masking agents; taste corrigents; resin; hy-drocofloids; solvents; solubilizers; neutralizing agents; diffusion accelerators; pigments; quaternary ammonium compounds; refatting and overfatting agents; raw materials for ointments, creams or oils; silicone derivatives; spreading auxiliaries; stabilizers; steri-lants; suppository bases; tablet auxiliaries, such as binders, fillers, glldants, disinte-grants or coatings; propellents; drying agents; opacifiers; thickeners; waxes; plasticiz-ers and white mineral oils. A formulation in this regard is based on specialist knowledge as described, for example, in Fiedler, HP., Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fQr Pharmazie, Kos-metik und angrenzende Gebiete [Encyclopedia of auxiliary substances for pharmacy, cosmetics and related fields], 4th edition, Aulendorf: ECV-Editio-Kantor-Verlag, 1996.<br>
The following examples serve to explain the invention without limiting it.<br>
The compounds were either characterized via proton-NMR in d6-dimethylsulfoxid or d-chloroform, if not stated otherwise, on a 400 MHz or 500 MHz NMR instrument (Bruker AVANCE), or by mass spectrometry, generally recorded via HPLC-MS in a fast gradient on CIS-material (electrospray-ionisation (ESI) mode), or melting point.<br>
