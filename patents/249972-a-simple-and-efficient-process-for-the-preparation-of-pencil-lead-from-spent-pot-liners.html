				<td>Field of the present Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a simple and efficient process for the preparation of pencil lead from the spent or waste pot liners of aluminium industries, said process comprising steps of crushing the liners into small sizes, adding chromic acid to the crushed liners, washing the reacted product with distilled water, thermally shock-treating the dried mass to obtain a fine flowing graphite powder, mixing the powder with binder(s), moistening the mixture with requisite amount of water to form a stiff dough, extruding the dough under pressure to obtain product in the form of a discs, heating the dried discs in an inert/reducing atmosphere in a furnace at temperature ranging between 400-1200째C for time duration ranging between 1 to 6 hours, and obtaining the pencil lead. Background of the present Invention<br>
Pencil leads are essentially baked ceramic rod of clay bonded graphite. The suitability of graphite for pencil industry is judged by the dark streak it leaves on the paper by scratching. Synthetic graphite though has less ash content and very fine particle size, produces very little smear and thus, is unsuitable for pencil manufacturers. Usually pencil manufacturers prefer amorphous graphite with about 90% purity and free from gritty particles. Amorphous graphite gives better smear than the flaky graphite. Indian Standard Institute (ISI) has thus set norm for graphite suitable for pencil industry as - amorphous graphite with size -300 BS mesh and ash less than 50%. Micronised amorphous graphite accordingly is the very much sought after raw material for the manufacture of high class lead for pencils. General procedure followed for making pencil lead for these micronised amorphous graphite involves, ball-milling or hammer-milling a water slurry containing clay and graphite, drying the slurry to required consistency and form a stiff dough in a mixer, followed by compacting it into a cylinder to form and extruding under pressure through a die. The wet strands are then dried, packed in saggers and kiln fired in a temperature range of 800-1100째C. The fired leads are then impregnated with waxes and fats or fatty-acids, or both. This latter step preclude glazing of the point of use. The quality of the lead depends on the quality of the ingredients used and the manufacturing process adopted. The degree of hardness depends on the ratio of clay<br><br><br>
to graphite. Clay percentage used varies from 20-60%. Pencils marked No.l (softest) lead contains about 20% clay while No.4 (hardest) has about 60% clay. Hardness is a product requirement and not a quality factor such as the uniformity, smoothness or strength of the sharpened point. Indelible leads, on the other hand, are mixtures of graphite, methyl violet and binders such as gum-tragacanth or methyl-cellulose, with or without mineral fillers and insoluble soaps. Although above account exemplifies traditional and time tested industrially proven receipt and process for the production of pencil leads, a great variety of ingredients and processes have been reported in recent times1"5.<br>

A simple process for removing contaminants from spent pot liners of aluminium<br>
industries disclosed whereby simultaneously graphite value of the spent pot liners are<br>
recovered and converted to an useful industrial product like pencil lead.   Various<br>
binders like bentonite clay, china clay, local plastic clay, etc., are used in various<br>
proportions to generate a wide range of transverse breaking strength and quality of<br>
these pencil leads.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of pencil lead from spent<br>
pot liners of aluminium industries.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for safe disposal of aluminium industry wastes (spent and contaminated pot liners) and extract its graphite value in micronised form to produce pencil leads using various types of binders. Accordingly, spent/waste cathode blocks (spent pot liners) were collected from NALCO, Angul (Orissa) aluminium extraction plant, and ground to various sizes from 1/2 inch to -125 micron size. The crushed material was then taken into a 500 ml flask provided with a stirrer and a thermometer. The assembly was placed inside a small fume cupboard, exhaust of which passes through a dilute sodium-hydroxide solution bubbler. Small amount of chromic acid was added to the said crushed sample dropwise and stirring while cold water was passed around the flask to keep it under 140째C. The chromic acid solution was freshly prepared by adding requisite amount of concentrated (98%) commercial grade sulfuric acid with sodium dichromate powder. The reaction of chromic acid with crushed sample was vigorous and reaction temperature needs to be controlled between 130-140째C. The reaction is over in about 20 minutes time after which sufficient distilled water was added to the sample, stirred and allowed to stand for settling. The supernatant liquid was filtered through a gouche funnel. The solid mass was again washed with distilled water and filtered. This process of washing was continued till the filtrate is neutral. The solid mass thus collected in the sintered funnel was then dried in an oven at 90-110째C for 1 hour. The dried powder was then thermally shock-treated in a pre-heated furnace kept at about 950째C for about 2 minutes.<br>
The said treatment generates a fine free flowing graphite powder with average crystallite size of about 20 micro-meter as determined by Malvern particle size analyzer. It was observed that the size of the said graphite crystallite remains the same irrespective of the size of the starting carbon material although the time of completion of acid reaction varies widely. The product has ash content of about 15%. Graphite powder (ash content about 15%) thus obtained was then mixed with various binders like bentonite clay, kaoline clay, local plastic clay (Chandikhol, Orissa, washed), local plastic clay with added phosphoric-acid, etc., in proportions of 20-60% and formed into a stiff dough by moistening with requisite water, and extruding at a pressure of 50-200 kg/cm2. The product in the form of discs were allowed to dry in a shade until moisture is below 10%. After shade drying it was fired under inert atmosphere in a furnace in the temperature range 1000-1200째C for 6 hours. After<br><br>
firing it was cooled slowly inside the furnace to room temperature in about 24 hours time. The product was then impregnated with wax to produce the said pencil leads. The pencil lead obtained by the aforementioned process can be used to prepare pencil leads of various shapes as per the requirement. It could be in the forms like rod shaped, broad shaped, etc.<br>
The following examples are cited by way of illustration and therefore, should not be constructed to limit scope of the present invention : Example-1(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example-2(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example-3(Table Removed)<br><br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1.	The process is simple and does not require any special apparatus to form the<br>
final product.   It essentially comprises two steps : the first being chemical<br>
cleaning of the spent pot liner to derive the micron size amorphous graphite<br>
powder, and then mixing the said graphite with a binder and firing in the<br>
temperature 400-1200째C to arrive at the final product.<br>
2.	The process while making an industrially important material, namely pencil<br>
lead,   provides   a  process   for   safe  disposal   and  utilization  of highly<br>
contaminated spent pot liners wastes of aluminium industries.<br>
3.	Ratio of the graphite powder and binder can be varied to produce a wide range<br>
of strength and blackness of various grade pencil leads.<br>
