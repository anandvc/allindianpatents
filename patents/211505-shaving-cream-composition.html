COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SHAVING COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The'following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
original<br>
139/mumnp/05<br><br>
The invention relates to shaving compositions delivered as aerosols exhibiting enhanced foaming qualities.<br>
Shaving is an inherently abrasive treatment of the skin. Cosmetic foams have been created to lubricate the cutting process.  Lubrication markedly reduces the trauma induced by a razor.<br>
Emollient ingredients of shaving creams are substantial contributors to reduction of irritation caused by the razor action.<br>
Emollients have long been incorporated into cleansing compositions.  For instance, U.S. Patent 5,002,680 (Schmidt et al.) discloses a mild skin-cleansing aerosol mousse. Nice skin feel after washing is imparted to the skin through a combination of mild surfactants, skinfeel polymers and high levels of moisturizing emollients.  Similar skin cleansing compositions have been reported in U.S. Patent 6,407,044 B2 (Dixon) wherein a hydrocarbon propellant system was used to generate a cleansing foam.<br>
A problem with use of high levels of emollients is that they depress foam formation often even collapsing the bubbles. Systems are needed which foam well despite the presence of high levels of emollient oils.<br><br>
In a first aspect, there is provided a shaving cream composition which includes:<br>
(i)   from about 1 % to about 20 % of a propellant<br>
comprising dimethyl ether and hydrocarbons in a relative weight ratio of about 5:1 to about 1:5; (ii)  from about 0.5 % to about 25 % of an anionic surfactant;<br>
(iii) from about 0.05 % to about 20 % of a C12-C24 fatty<br>
alcohol; (iv)  from about 5 % to about 40 % of a hydrophobic emollient; wherein a total weight ratio of all hydrophobic emollients to all anionic surfactants present in the composition ranges from about 50:1 to greater than about 1:1.<br>
Now it has been found that a combination of factors can influence generation of a rich, long lasting shaving foam despite the presence of very high emollient levels.  One factor is utilization of fatty alcohols which were found to interact with the surfactants to create small sustainable bubbles.  Another factor is the use of dimethyl ether as at least one component of the propellant system.  Fatty alcohol, dimethyl ether and the emollient all combine to provide a rich lasting foam that also delivers substantial emollient to the interface between skin and razor.<br>
Accordingly, a first element of the present invention is that of a propellant.  The propellant is present in amounts from about 1 % to about 2 0 %, preferably from about 3 % to<br><br>
about 15 %,. optimally from about 5 % to about 10 % by weight of the composition.  The propellant is a mixture of dimethyl<br>
ether and a C3-C6 hydrocarbon.  Suitable hydrocarbons<br>
include n-butane', isobutane, n-propane, isopropane, n-pentane,   isopentane and mixtures thereof.  Amounts of the dimethyl ether and total hydrocarbon are present in a relative weight ratio ranging from about 5:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 4:1 to about 1:4, optimally from about 2:1 to about 1:2, and most optimally from about 1:1 to about 1:1.5.<br>
Another component of the present invention is that of one or more anionic surfactants.  These will be present in amounts from about 0.5 % to about 25 %, preferably from about 1 % to about 15 %, more preferably from about 3 % to about 10 %, optimally from about 4 % to about 8 % by weight of the composition.<br>
Anionic surfactants useful herein include: acyl isethionates, acyl sarcosinates, alkylglycerylether sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, acyl lactylate, methylacyl taurates, paraffin sulfonates, linear alkyl benzene sulfonates, N-acyl glutamates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, alpha sulfo fatty acid esters, alkyl ether carboxylates, alkyl phosphate esters, ethoxylated alkyl phosphate esters, alpha olefin sulphates, the alkyl ether sulfates (with 1 to 12 ethoxy groups) and mixtures thereof, wherein said surfactants contain C8 to C22 alkyl chains and wherein the counterion is preferably selected from the group consisting<br><br>
of Na, K, NH4, N(CH2CH2,OH)3.  Most preferred are lauryl ether sulfates.<br>
Although soaps (i.e. salts of C10-C22 fatty acids) are often used in shaving formulations, these materials are relatively irritating to the skin.  For purposes of this invention, amounts of the soap advantageously is limited to no more than about 10 %, ordinarily no more than about 2 %, and preferably less than 1 % or especially less than 0.1 % by weight of the composition.  Similarly, unsaponified soaps<br>
which are known as C10-c24 fatty acids advantageously can<br>
also be avoided because of their acidity and foam inhibiting properties, particularly stearic acid.  Levels of fatty acid, particularly stearic acid, is best held to less than 1 %, preferably less than 0.8 %, optimally less than 0.1 % by weight of the composition.  Under some circumstances, an amine neutralized fatty acid such as triethanolammonium stearate can be employed, particularly at levels from about 0.2 % to about 1 % by weight.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants may be included in compositions of this invention.  Amounts may range from about 0.5 % to about 15 %, preferably from about 1 % to about 10 %, optimally from about 3 % to about 6 % by weight.  Illustrative of the amphoteric surfactant are cocoamidopropyl betaine, lauroamphoacetates and diacetates, alkyl dimethylamine oxides and combinations thereof.  Particularly preferred are combinations of anionic and amphoteric surfactants, especially present in relative weight ratios of total<br><br>
anionic to total amphoteric surfactant ranging from about 10:1 to about 1:1, preferably about 3:1 to about 1.5:1.<br>
The pH of the composition may range from about 4.5 to about 12.5.  However, the pH is preferably near neutral and may range from about 6.5 to about 9.5, preferably from about 6.7 to about 8.5, optimally from about 7 to about 7.5.<br>
Another component of compositions according to this present invention is a C12-C24 fatty alcohol.  This material may be present in an amount from about 0.05 % to about 20 %, preferably from about 0.2 % to about 8 %, more preferably from about 0.5 % to about 5 %, optimally from about 1 % to about 3 % by weight of the composition.<br>
Illustrative fatty alcohols include stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol and combinations thereof.<br>
Hydrophobic emollients are an important component of the present invention.  These materials may be present from about 5 % to about 40 %, preferably from about 8 % to about 3 0 %, more preferably from about 10 % to about 25 %, optimally from about 15 % to about 20 % total of hydrophobic emollient by weight of the composition.<br>

Examples<br>
The  following examples will more  fully illustrate  the embodiments  of  this  invention.     All  parts,   percentages  and proportions  referred to herein and  in the appended claims  are by weight  unless  otherwise  illustrated.<br>
Examples   1-8<br>
Shaving creams  according to the present  invention are detailed in the Table below.<br><br><br><br>
The shaving creams outlined in the Table are packaged in an aerosol metal can fitted with a conventional aerosol spray-head with nozzle.  Prior to use, instructions on the can request a user to thoroughly shake the combination before expressing the foam by pressing downward on the spray head. After the cream has been placed on a human face, underarm or legs, a razor is applied over the skin area to remove hair by cutting.  These formulations are particularly suitable for legs and underarm.<br>
Example 9<br>
This Example evaluates the effect of different propellant mixtures on the quality of the foam.  The formula detailed in the Table below was utilized for evaluations under this Example.<br><br>
The formula of shaving cream outlined above was packaged in aerosol metal canisters fitted with a conventional aerosol spray head with nozzle.  Each canister was also filled with a propellant in equal weight throughout.  Identity of the propellant is found in the Table below.  Samples were evaluated in a Compression (Squeeze) Test and measured for the Liquid Fraction of the foam.<br><br>
Measurement of Liquid Fraction of Foam<br>
Liquid volume fractions of foams were obtained by weighing a known volume of foam.  The weight of the foam essentially can all be attributed to its liquid fraction as the remaining volume of foam consists of air.  To measure the liquid fraction, foam was expelled from a sample canister into a plastic Petri dish having a volume of 5.2 ml.  The level of the foam was carefully adjusted to the height of the dish with a metal spatula so that the foam was contained within the volume of the dish.  The weight of the dish with the foam was recorded.  After subtracting the weight of the dish, the weight of the foam was used to calculate the liquid phase volume.  The weight of the foam is divided by the density of the formulation to obtain the volume of the liquid portion of the formula.  The liquid fraction is then the volume of the liquid divided by the total volume of foam (in these tests, 5.2 ml).  Samples were measured in triplicate.<br>
Rheology of Foams - Compression (Squeeze) Test<br>
The Compression Test measures the force required to compress the foam generated from a formulation expelled from a canister.  Measurements were performed using a Rheometric Scientific ARES controlled strain rheometer (SR-5, Rheometric Scientific, Piscataway, NJ) .  The rheometer was set up with parallel plates 50 mm in diameter with a gap of 2.0 mm between the plates.  Foams were loaded between the parallel plates and then tests were formed using programmed extension mode which subjects the foams to an axial<br><br>
deformation applied at a programmed rate.  The foam samples were compressed- at controlled rate of 0.25 mm/second, brought back to initial state at a rate of 0.33 mm/sec and then extended at a rate of 0.25 mm/sec.  Tests were performed at 25°C.  The output is the normal force (grams) associated with the compression and extension of the foams.<br>
Higher force values reflect a more rigid, better foam quality.  When product is expelled from a canister, some is in gaseous form and some extrudes as a liquid.  The greater the amount of liquid, the lower the foam quality.<br><br><br><br>
Sample A was- found, to deliver., a-dead non-springy foam.  This is evidenced by the relatively low compression test average of 210.3 g force.  Samples B to E were able to be worked during hand washing and did not break into undesirable smaller segments of foam.  The working ability is attributed to the relatively high level of liquid fraction.  By contrast, Sample F was extremely fluffy, containing too much air and did not wash-off well from the skin.  It is evident that such as in Samples B through E combinations of dimethyl ether and hydrocarbon are necessary to obtain a satisfactory shaving cream product.<br><br>
