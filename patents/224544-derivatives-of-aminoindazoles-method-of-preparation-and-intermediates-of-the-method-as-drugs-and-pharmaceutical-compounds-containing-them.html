865 mg of monoethyl fumarate are added to 1 g of 6-chloro-lH-indazole-3-amine in 50 cm' of dichloromethane. 1.4 g of l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride are then introduced and the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at about 20°C. The resulting mixture is washed with 50 cm of distilled water and then with 50 cm of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and then evaporated under reduced pressure (2 kPa; 40°C). 2 g of a brick-coloured gummy mass are obtained, and are purified by chromatography under an argon pressure of 50 kPa, on a column of silica gel (particle size 40-60 pm; diameter 4.5 cm), eluting with a cyclohexane/ethyl acetate mixture (90/10 by volume) and collecting 40 cm fractions.

Via route (a), the reaction is performed in the presence of a base, for instance pyridine, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine; the reaction can start at 0°C and, when the addition of the acid chloride is complete, the mixture is left stirring at room temperature (G. Daidone, Heterocycles, 43, (11), 2385-96, (1996)) or is heated, if necessary.<br>
Via route (b), the reaction may be performed at the reflux point of an inert solvent such as xylene or tetrahydrofuran (F. Albericio, Synth. Commun., 31, (2), 225-32, (2001)) or dichloromethane (G. Procter. Tetrahedron, 51, (47), 12837-842, (1995)) or in the anhydride itself<br>
Via route (c), the reaction is performed in the presence of an activating agent of the type such as carbodiimide alone (DCC, EDAC) (M. C. Desai. Tetrahedron Lett., 34, 7685, (1993)) or in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole and dimethylaminopyridine (J. P. Gamet. Tetrahedron, 40, 1995, (1984), K. Barlos, J. Org. Chem., 50, 696, (1985)) or according to the well-known coupling methods of peptide chemistry (M. Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis; Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, pages 9-58, (1984)) or the methods forming amide bonds.<br><br>
W'Tien, in (I), R3 comprises an acid on the terminal carbon, this acid may be obtained by condensation of a cyclic anhydride such as maleic. succinate or phthalic anhydride, or by condensation of an ester acid chloride followed by saponification of the ester, according to the following scheme:<br><br>
or the derivatives of formula (I) for which R=S, they are obtained by thionation of he corresponding oxo derivatives using Lawesson's reagent (R. Olsson. Tetrahedron -ett., 41,(41), 7947-50, (2000)) or by treatment with phosphorus pentasulphide in<br><br>
pyridine or toluene (J. Voss, Justus Liebig Ann. Chem., 716, 209, (1968); 0,Tsuge, Chem. Lett., 1369,(1980)).<br>
The derivatives of formula (I) for which R = NH may be obtained by reaction of the 3-amino IH-indazoles with a nitrile or with a Meerwein salt (S. Patai. The Chemistry of amidines and imidates, J. Wiley and Sons, (1975), page 283).<br><br>
For the compounds for which R4, R5, R6 and R7 are chosen, independently of each other, from the following radicals: hydrogen, halogen, CN, NO:, NH2, OH, COOH, C(0)0R8, -0-C(0)R8, NR8R9, NHC(0)R8, C(0)NR8R9, NHC(S)R8, C(S)NR8R9, SR8, S(0)R8, SO2R8, NHSO2R8, SO2NR8R9, -O-SO2R8, -SO2-O-R8, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, (l-6C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy, aryl, aryl(l-6C)alkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaryl(l-6C)alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, adamantyl; these radicals being optionally substituted with one or more substituents chosen from halogen, CN, NO2, NR2, OH, ORIO, COOH, C(O)OR10, -O-C(O)R10, NRlORll, NHC(O)R10, C(O)NR10Rll, NHC(S)R10, C(S)NR10R11, SRIO, S(O)R10, SO2RIO, NHSO2RIO, SO2NRIORII, -O-SO2RIO, -SO2-O-RIO, aryl, heteroaryl, formyl, trifluoromethyl and trifluoromethoxy; they may be obtained by reactions involving palladium chemistry: Suzuki, (A. Suzuki, Pure Appl. Chem. 63, 419-22, (1991), Stille (J.C. Stille, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 25, 508-24, (1986), Heck, (R.F. Heck, Org. React., 27, 345-90, (1982), Sonogashira, (K. Sonogashira, Synthesis 777,<br><br>
(1977), Buckwald (S.L. Buckwald, Ace. Chem. Res., 3i, 805, (1998), starting with the corresponding halo derivatives.<br>
For this, it is necessary to protect the reactive flinctions. Thus, the OH, SH, COOH and NH2 functions must be protected before performing the coupling. The protecting groups are introduced according to any method known to those skilled in the art and especially those described by T.W. Greene, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, J. Wiley-hiterscience Publication (1991). It is preferable to protect the nitrogen in position 1 with groups such as fert-butoxycarbonyl or silicon derivatives. A tert-butyldimethylsilyl or triisopropylsilyl group will preferably be chosen, and may be removed with fluoride anions or with acetic acid, and more particularly a trimethylsilylethoxymethyl group, which may be cleaved off with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in refluxing solvents such is tetrahydrofuran or dioxane (J. P. Whitten, J. Org. Chem., 51, 1891, (1986); B. H. Lipshutz. Tetrahedron Lett., 4095, (1986)).<br>
The derivatives protected in position 1 with trimethylsilylethoxymethyl are obtained by reacting the starting compounds with trimethylsilylethoxymethyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide at room temperature (J. P. WTiitten, J. Org. Chem., 51, 1891, (1986); M. P. Edwards. Tetrahedron, 42, 3723, (1986)).<br>
Similarly, the 1-NH nitrogen function of the indazole will be protected with groups such as tosyl, carbamate, benzyl or silyl derivatives. For example, when it is desired to perform a palladium coupling on a derivative halogenated in position 6, the nitrogen in position 1 will have to be protected, as shown below (X = CI, Br, I):<br><br><br>
The deprotection is performed according to the methods knovvii to those skilled in the art and described by T.W. Greene, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, J. Wiley-Interscience Publication (1991). For example, if the protecting group in position 1 is a trimethylsilylethoxymethyl, it may be deprotected by reaction with tetrabutylammonium fluoride as shown below:<br><br>
The benzyl group will then be removed, for example, by treatment with trimethylsilyl iodide in refluxing acetonitrile. The protection may also be performed with a trimethylsilylethoxymethyl group, which may be cleaved off with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in refluxing solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane<br><br><br>
For example, the nitration of the derivatives substituted in position 6 (as described above) may be performed by well-known methods such as nitric acid in acetic acid or nitronium tetrafluoroborate in solvents such as acetonitrile (J. L. Duffy, J. Org. Chem., 56, 3006-09, (1991)). Needless to say, the nitro function may be reduced with hydrogen in the presence of palladium (B. Baragatti, Eur. J. Med, 35,(10), 949-55, (2000)), or with stannous chloride in the presence of hydrochloric acid (R. P. Dixon, Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 32, (6), 573-77, (2000)), or with ferrous sulphate in the presence of aqueous ammonia (S. Castellano, J. Heterocycl. Chem., 32, (6), 1539-42, (2000)). The amine function thus freed may be acylated or may undergo a diazotization leading to Sandmeyer-Gatterman reactions (substitution with CI, Br, I, CN, RS or OH,) (H.H. Hodgson, Chem. Rev., 40, 251-77, (1947); T. Sugaya, Synthesis, 73-76, (1994); the diazonium derivatives (N. Suzuki, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Tr., 645, (1987)) or the halo derivatives obtained being able to give rise once again, as previously, to reactions involving palladium chemistry.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) are isolated and may be purified by the usual known methods, for example by crystallization, chromatography or extraction.<br>
The compoimds of formula (I) may optionally be converted into addition salts with a mineral or organic acid by the action of such an acid in an organic solvent such as an alcohol, a ketone, an ether or a chlorinated solvent. These salts also form part of the invention.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts that may be mentioned include the following salts: benzenesulphonate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, citrate, ethanesulphonate, fumarate, gluconate, iodate, maleate, isethionate, methanesulphonate, methylene-bis-P-oxynaphthoate, nitrate, oxalate, pamoate, phosphate, salicylate, succinate, sulphate, tartrate, theophyllinacetate and p-toluenesulphonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are kinase inhibitors and are thus useful for preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration. Pick's disease, strokes, cranial and spinal trauma and peripheral neuropathies, obesity, essential hypertension, itherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, polycystic ovarian s&gt;Tidrome, syndrome X, mmunodeficiency and cancer.<br>
rheir activities were determined by measuring the inhibition of the phosphorylation )f the tau protein in sections of adult rat cortex.<br>
The cortex sections are 300 pm thick and are prepared using 8-10-week-old male )FA rats (Iffa-Credo), sacrificed by decapitation. They are incubated in 5 ml of )MEM medium containing pyruvate and glucose 4.5 g/1 at 37°C for 40 minutes. The<br><br>
sections are then washed twice with the medium, distributed into microUibes (50/il in SOOfil of medium with or without test compounds) and incubated at 37°C with stirring. Two hours later, the experiment is stopped by centrifugation. The sections are lysed, sonicated and centrifuged at 18 300xg for 15 minutes at 4°C. The protein concentration of the supernatant is determined by means of a commercial assay (BCA Protein Assay, Pierce) based on the Lowry method.<br>
The samples, denatured beforehand for ten minutes at 70°C, are separated on 4-12% Bis-Tris vertical gel in the presence of MOPS-SDS buffer and electrotransferred on nitrocellulose membrane. The immunolabelling is performed with the AD2 monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes the Ser396/404 phosphorylated epitopes of the tau protein. The immunoreactive proteins are visualized by adding a second antibody directed against mouse IgGs and coupled to peroxidase and to a chemoluminescent substrate. The autoradiograms obtained are finally quantified using the 'GeneTools' software from Syngene (GeneGnome, Ozyme) to determine an IC50.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) show very advantageous activity, and in particular certain compounds have an IC50 of less than 100 pM.<br>
