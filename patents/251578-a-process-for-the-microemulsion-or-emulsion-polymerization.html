				<td>1 Method for radical emulsion polymerization using hydrosoluble alkoxyamines<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a process for the emulsion, microemulsion or miniemulsion polymerization of at least one monomer which can be polymerized by the radical route employing a water-soluble alkoxyamine.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
EP 970 973 discloses a process for the emulsion polymerization of at least one monomer which can be polymerized by the radical route in the presence of a stable free radical, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, sold generally under the name TEMPO, or one of its derivatives, and of an emulsifying agent, the polymerization being initiated by a polymerization initiating agent, preferably a water-soluble one, chosen from organic peroxides and hydroperoxides, azo derivatives, metal and ammoniacal salts of persulfate, or redox pairs.<br>
Marestin C., Noel C., Guyot A. and Claverie J., Macromolecules, 1998, 31(12), 4041-4044, describe a process for the controlled radical emulsion polymerization of styrene in the presence of an amino-TEMPO derivative represented by the formula (A) below,<br>
of a water-soluble initiator of persulfate type and of surfactants of SDS or SDBS type. This process results in stable latexes being obtained which exhibit levels of solids of the order of 10% and which exhibit a bimodal distribution in the particle size However, even at 130°C, it is found that the polymerization kinetics are very slow and the conversion of the styrene only just reaches 70% after polymerizing for 55 hours!<br>
Cao J., He J., Li C. and Yang Y., Polym. J, 2001, 33, 75, describe another example of controlled radical emulsion polymerization of styrene with several TEMPO derivatives which makes it possible to obtain stable latexes at 120°C, the distribution in the particle sizes of which is monomodal.<br>
Nevertheless, it is found that the use of TEMPO derivatives is limited to the<br><br>
 control of styrene monomers.<br>
The literature, in addition to controlled radical polymerization processes, the initiation of which, carried out in the aqueous phase, involves two-component initiating systems, the control agent of which is TEMPO or one of its derivatives, also describes controlled radical polymerization processes, the initiation of which involves an N-(tert-butyl)-1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl nitroxide (SG1) derivative, the polymerization initiator being a water-soluble initiator of persulfate, diazo or peroxide type:<br>
N-(tert-butvl)-1-diethvlphosphono-2.2-dimethvlpropyl nitroxide (SG1)<br>
WO 00/49027 discloses a process for the solvent medium, bulk or miniemulsion radical polymerization of styrene and acrylate monomers in the presence of organosoluble alkoxyamines derived from SG1 corresponding to the formula (B) below.<br>
Alkoxyamines (B)<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process for the miniemulsion, microemulsion or emulsion polymerization of at least one monomer which can be polymerized by the radical route according to the invention is carried out in the presence of at least one water-soluble alkoxyamine, preferably:<br>
a monoalkoxyamine of formula (I)<br>
in which<br>
*	R1 and R3, which are identical or different, represent a linear or branched<br>
alkyl radical having a number of carbon atoms ranging from 1 to 3,<br>
*	R2 represents an alkali metal, such as Li, Na or K, or an ammonium ion,<br>
such as NH4+, NBu4+ or NHBus+(Bu being the abbreviation for butyl),<br>
or a mono- or a polyalkoxyamine of formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where m is an integer of greater than or equal to 1 , preferably of greater than or equal to 2, and R1, Ra and Ra have the same meaning as in the formula (I).<br>
The polymerization medium comprises a liquid organic phase and a liquid aqueous phase, said liquid organic phase preferably comprising more than 50% by weight of monomer(s) to be polymerized and said aqueous phase preferably comprising at least 50% by weight of water.<br>
The process of the present invention makes possible access to latexes formed of (co)polymers possessing controlled macromolecular architectures.<br>
Without the Applicant Company being committed to any one explanation, it believes that the water-soluble alkoxyamines of formula (I) and/or (II) act both as initiating agent and as emulsifying agent in the process according to the invention; thus, the surfactant properties of the water-soluble alkoxyamines of formula (I) and/or (II) make it possible to reduce, indeed even avoid, the use of other surfactants in said emulsion, miniemulsion or microemulsion process.<br>
The term "water-soluble alkoxyamine", within the meaning of the present invention, is understood as indicating any alkoxyamine of formula (I) or (II) having a solubility in the aqueous phase of at least 1 g/l at 25°C.<br>
The  alkoxyamine  can  be  introduced  into  the  polymerization  medium  in  a<br>
proportion of 0.01% to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 5%, by weight, with respect to the weight of monomer(s).<br>
The term "monomer" is understood to mean any monomer which can be polymerized or copolymerized by the radical route. The term "monomer" covers, of course, mixtures of several monomers.<br>
The monomer can be chosen from monomers exhibiting a carbon-carbon double bond capable of polymerizing by the radical route, such as vinyl, vinylidene, diene and olefinic, allyl, acrylic or methacrylic monomers, and the like.<br>
The monomers under consideration can in particular be chosen from vinylaromatic monomers, such as styrene or substituted styrenes, in particular a-methyl-styrene and sodium styrenesulfonate, dienes, such as butadiene or isoprene, acrylic monomers, such as acrylic acid or its salts, alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl acrylates, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, ethylhexyl or phenyl acrylate, hydroxyalkyl acrylates, such as 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, ether alkyl acrylates, such as 2-methoxyethyl acrylate, alkoxy- or aryloxypolyalkylene glycol acrylates, such as methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylates, ethoxypolyethylene glycol acrylates, methoxypolypropylene glycol acrylates, methoxypolyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol acrylates or their mixtures, aminoalkyl acrylates, such as 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate (ADAME), acrylates of amine salts, such as [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride or sulfate or [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethylbenzylammonium chloride or sulfate, fluoroacrylates, silylated acrylates or phosphorus-comprising acrylates, such as alkylene glycol acrylate phosphates, methacrylic monomers, such as methacrylic acid or its salts, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or aryl methacrylates, such as methyl, lauryl, cyclohexyl, allyl or phenyl methacrylate, hydroxyalkyl methacrylates, such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, ether alkyl methacrylates, such as 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate, alkoxy- or aryloxypolyalkylene glycol methacrylates, such as methoxypolyethylene glycol methacrylates, ethoxypolyethylene glycol methacrylates, methoxypolypropylene glycol methacrylates, methoxypolyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol methacrylates or their mixtures, aminoalkyl methacrylates, such as 2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl methacrylate (MADAME), methacrylates of amine salts, such as [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride or sulfate or [2-(methacryloyloxy)-<br>
ethyljdimethylbenzylammonium chloride or sulfate, fluoromethacrylates, such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate, silylated methacrylates, such as 3-methacryloyl-oxypropyltrimethylsilane, phosphorus-comprising methacrylates, such as alkylene glycol methacrylate phosphates, hydroxyethylimidazolidone methacrylate, hydroxyethyl-imidazolidinone methacrylate or 2-(2-oxo-1-imidazolidinyl)ethyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, acrylamide or substituted acrylamides, 4-acryloylmorpholine, N-methylol-acrylamide, acrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride (APTAC), acrylamidomethyl-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) or its salts, methacrylamide or substituted methacrylamides, N-methylolmethacrylamide, methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC), itaconic acid, maleic acid or its salts, maleic anhydride, alkyl or alkoxy- or aryloxypolyalkylene glycol maleates or hemimaleates, vinylpyridine, vinylpyrrolidinone, (alkoxy)poly(alkylene glycol) vinyl ethers or divinyl ethers, such as methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) vinyl ether or poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether, olefinic monomers, among which may be mentioned ethylene, butene, hexene and 1-octene, as well as fluoroolefinic monomers and vinylidene monomers, among which may be mentioned vinylidene fluoride, alone or as a mixture of at least two abovementioned monomers.<br>
It is possible to add, to the polymerization medium, at least one emulsifying agent, that is to say a surfactant which makes it possible to stabilize the emulsion, it being understood that said emulsifying agent is not an alkoxyamine within the meaning of the present invention. Any emulsifying agent standard for this type of emulsion can be used.<br>
The emulsifying agent can be anionic, cationic or nonionic. The emulsifying agent can be an amphoteric or quaternary or fluorinated surfactant. It can be chosen from alkyl or aryl sulfates, alkyl- or arylsulfonates, fatty acid salts, poly(vinyl alcohol)s or polyethoxylated fatty alcohols. By way of example, the emulsifying agent can be chosen from the following list:<br>
-	sodium lauryl sulfate,<br>
-	sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate,<br>
-	sodium stearate,<br>
6polyethoxylated nonylphenol,<br>
-	dihexyl sodium sulfosuccinate,<br>
-	dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate,<br>
-	lauryldimethylammonium bromide,<br>
-	lauryl amido betaine,<br>
-	potassium perfluorooctylacetate.<br>
The emulsifying agent can also be a block or random or grafted amphilphilic copolymer, such as sodium styrenesulfonate copolymers and in particular polystyrene-b-poly(sodium styrenesulfonate), or any amphiphilic copolymer prepared by any other polymerization technique.<br>
The emulsifying agent can be introduced into the polymerization medium in a proportion of 0.1% to 10% by weight, with respect to the weight of monomer(s).<br>
The term "miniemulsion" is understood to mean an emulsion in which the organic phase forms droplets with a diameter of less than 2 urn, generally ranging from 100 to 1000 nm.<br>
The miniemulsion state is generally obtained by virtue of sufficient shearing of the medium and by virtue of the presence, in the miniemulsion, of a hydrophobic polymer and of a cosolvent.<br>
The hydrophobic polymer has to be soluble in the organic phase, preferably exhibits a solubility in water at 25°C of less than 1 x 10~6 g/liter and exhibits a weight-average molecular weight at least equal to 100 000, for example ranging from 100 000 to 400 000. By way of examples, the hydrophobic polymer can be polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(butyl acrylate).<br>
The hydrophobic polymer can be introduced into the emulsion in a proportion of 0.5 to 2% by weight, with respect to the monomer to be polymerized.<br>
The cosolvent exhibits a solubility in water at 25°C of less than 1 x 10~6 g/liter and is liquid at the polymerization temperature and, for example, exhibits a hydrocarbon sequence of at least six carbon atoms.<br>
If the cosolvent does not comprise fluorine atoms, the hydrocarbon sequence preferably comprises at least 12 carbon atoms.<br><br>
By way of examples, the cosolvent can be: -hexadecane,<br>
-	stearyl methacrylate,<br>
-	dodecyl methacrylate,<br>
-	perfluorooctyl methacrylate.<br>
The shearing sufficient to produce the miniemulsion state can be produced by vigorous stirring, for example obtained with ultrasound. Once the miniemulsion state has been obtained, it is generally possible to reduce the shearing by bringing it back to that standard for emulsions in general while retaining the miniemulsion state.<br>
The term "microemulsion" is understood to mean an emulsion as defined, for example, in the publications by Candau, F., Microemulsion Polymerization. NATO ASI Series, Series E: Applied Sciences (1997), 335 (Polymeric Dispersions: Principles and Applications), 127-140; by Morgan, John D., Microemulsion Polymerization. Recent Research Developments in Macromolecules Research (1998), 3 (Pt. 2), 551-592; by Capek, Advances in Colloid and Interface Science, 82 (1999) 253-273 and 92 (2001) 195-233.<br>
The emulsion, the miniemulsion or the microemulsion can be produced by mixing with stirring, with more or less high shearing, an aqueous phase comprising:<br>
-	water,<br>
-	at least one water-soluble alkoxyamine of type (I) and/or (II) as defined above,<br>
-	optionally an emulsifying agent,<br>
and an organic phase comprising:<br>
-	the monomer(s),<br>
-	an optional organic solvent,<br>
-	an optional cosolvent, in particular in the case of a miniemulsion.<br>
The polymerization temperatures depend on the monomers present in the medium. Thus, in order to initiate the polymerization of methacrylate starting from the alkoxyamines (I) and/or (II), a polymerization temperature of between 10 and 80°C is preferred; for the other monomers, a temperature generally of between 50°C and 130°C is chosen. The process according to the invention is carried out at a pressure sufficient to prevent the phases of the emulsion from boiling and sufficient for its various<br>
constituents to remain essentially in the emulsion (minimization of the passage into the vapor phase of the various constituents).<br>
The polymerization process according to the invention leads to a polymer latex. Within this latex, the combination of the polymer particles exhibits a mean diameter of less than 2 urn, generally of between 0.01 urn and 1 urn.<br>
The polymers obtained are living polymers carrying alkoxyamine functional groups. They can be themselves reengaged one or more times in a radical polymerization process with the abovementioned monomers to result in block copolymers.<br>
The process according to the invention thus makes possible the preparation of block polymers. This is because the polymerization of a first monomer by the process according to the invention results in a living polymer block. It is then possible to connect, to this first block, a block of another polymer by placing the first living polymer block in a medium for the polymerization of a second monomer. It is thus possible to produce block copolymers, for example copolymers comprising one or more polystyrene blocks and one or more polybutadiene blocks, or copolymers comprising one or more polystyrene blocks and one or more blocks of the methacrylate type and one or more blocks of the acrylate type.<br>
In practice, the blocks can be prepared one after the other in the same equipment. When the first monomer is consumed so as to produce the first block, it is sufficient to introduce the second monomer intended for the preparation of the second block, without halting the stirring and without cooling or other interruption. Of course, depending on the nature of the monomers, the conditions for forming each of the blocks, such as the temperature of the emulsion, can be adjusted.<br>
Of course, it is possible to attach as many blocks as desired to the living polymer by placing the latter in a medium for the polymerization of a monomer from which it is desired to form a block.<br>
Thus, the invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a block polymer comprising at least one stage according to the invention resulting in a first living block, said living block subsequently being placed in the presence of at least one other monomer from which it is desired to form a block attached to the first block, so as to<br>
form a living diblock, and so on, depending on the number of blocks which it is desired to produce.<br>
Thus, the present application also relates to a process for the preparation of a diblock polymer comprising a stage of polymerization of a first monomer in accordance with the invention, so as to obtain a first living block, followed by a stage during which the first living block is placed in the presence of a second monomer which is polymerized, so as to form a second block attached to the first block.<br>
The present application thus also relates to a process for the preparation of a multiblock polymer comprising one or more stages of polymerization of other monomers in the presence of the diblock polymers prepared in accordance with what has just been stated, so as to form a third block attached to the diblock polymer. This process of block reuse can be repeated the number of times necessary to achieve the desired number of blocks.<br>
By way of examples, the following block polymers can be produced: polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene-b-polystyrenesulfonate, polystyrene-b-polyacrylamide, polystyrene-b-polymethacrylamide, poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(ethyl acrylate), polystyrene-b-poly(butyl acrylate), polybutadiene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), polyisoprene-b-poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile), polybutadiene-b-poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile), poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene-b-poly(vinyl acetate), polystyrene-b-poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate), polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate-co-hydroxyethyl acrylate), polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), polybutadiene-b-polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene-b-poly(butyl acrylate)-b-polystyrene,<br>
polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-polystyrene,<br>
polystyrene-b-polyisoprene-b-polystyrene,<br>
poly(perfluorooctyl acrylate)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(perfluorooctyl acrylate)-b-polystyrene,<br>
poly(perfluorooctyl acrylate)-b-poly(behenyl acrylate),<br>
poly(perfluorooctyl acrylate)-b-poly(stearyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(n-octyl acrylate)-b-poly(ethyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(butyl acrylate)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(methoxyethyl acrylate)-b-poly(methyl acrylate),<br>
poly((meth)acrylic acid)-b-poly(butyl acrylate)-b-poly((meth)acrylic acid).<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "polymer" or "polymer block" is to be taken in its general sense, so that it covers homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers and polymer blends. The term "polymerization" is to be taken in a sense which is also general.<br>
The pH of the aqueous phase may be fixed, depending on the type of monomer(s) (co)polymerized. In the case of polymerization conditions with a pH&gt;8, it is preferable to use the alkoxyamines (I) and/or (II) for which R2 is an alkali metal atom. The alkoxyamine is then introduced into the reaction medium via an aqueous solution with a concentration of 10~1 molT1 of pH=9. In the case of polymerization conditions with a pH5.<br>
The present invention also claims the possibility of converting the residual monomers from one of the stages described above using an additional supply of free radical initiator(s) of organic and/or inorganic peroxide type and/or of azo type. The essential difference from the polymerization process described above is that, instead of carrying out all the conversion (polymerization) of the monomers by controlled radical polymerization, the polymerization is begun under controlled radical polymerization<br>
conditions and is completed under conventional radical polymerization conditions (i.e., with peroxides, persulfates, azo compounds and/or their equivalents). The monomers which are polymerized under conventional radical polymerization conditions may be already present during the controlled radical polymerization and may not have been converted or else they are added to the aqueous solution comprising the portion of the dispersant already prepared by controlled radical polymerization or else again according to a combination of these alternatives. In order to carry out this conventional radical polymerization, conventional radical generators well known to a person skilled in the art and frequently used during conventional radical polymerization reactions in aqueous medium are added to the aqueous solution comprising the portion of the dispersant already prepared by controlled radical polymerization. Mention may nonexclusively be made, among these radical generators, of metal and ammoniacal salts of persulfate, such as sodium persulfate, potassium persulfate and ammonium persulfate, water-soluble azo initiators, such as 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride and metal and ammoniacal salts of 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid), redox pairs, such as the (sodium, potassium or ammonium) persulfate/vitamin C pair or the sodium or potassium metabisulfite/persulfate pair or the aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution/ferrous ion salts pair or the tert-butyl hydroperoxide/sodium sulfoxylate pair, and any other possible oxidizing agent(s)/reducing agent(s) combination. When the amount of residual monomers to be converted after the controlled radical polymerization reaction is considerable, the use of conventional radical polymerization initiators will result in aqueous solutions or dispersions of a blend of copolymers of different origins, those obtained by conventional radical polymerization and those obtained by controlled radical polymerization. For this conventional radical polymerization stage, the use is not ruled out of chain-transfer agents, such as those used conventionally in conventional radical polymerization in an aqueous medium, even if, advantageously, they are not used. Mention may nonexclusively be made, among transfer agents used in conventional radical polymerizations, of isopropanol, water-soluble mercaptans, such as thioglycolic acid or mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoethanol.<br>
In the examples which follow, the following characterization techniques were<br>
used:<br>
-	conversion of monomer to polymer: by measuring the solids content, with<br>
respect to the weight of monomer charged,<br>
-	mean diameter of the particles: by light scattering (Malvern Zeta Sizer 4 device),<br>
-	molecular weights and  polydispersity of the polymers:  by steric exclusion<br>
chromatography after washing the polymer with water to free it from water-soluble<br>
entities. Use was made of a "Waters" chromatograph, tetrahydrofuran (THF) acting as<br>
eluent.   The   chromatograph  was  equipped   with  four  PL  Gel®   10   urn   columns<br>
(poly(styrene)divinylbenzene) of 100, 500, 1000 and 10 000 A and with double detection<br>
(refractometer and UV at 254 nm). Calibration was carried out with standard polystyrene<br>
samples. The polymers were injected at 10 mg/ml for a flow rate of 1 ml/min.<br>

Example 1 B - Preparation of a dialkoxyamine from the monoalkoxyamine obtained in 1 A<br>
The following are introduced into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask purged with nitrogen:<br>
-	2 g of alkoxyamine prepared under 1 A (2 equivalents)<br>
-	0.52 g of 1,4-butanediol diacrylate with a purity of &gt;98 % (1 equivalent)<br>
-	6.7 ml of ethanol.<br>
The mixture is heated at reflux (temperature 78°C) for 20 h and then the ethanol is evaporated under vacuum. 2.5 g of a very viscous yellow oil are obtained.<br>
The 31P NMR analysis shows the complete disappearance of the 2-methyl-2-[N-(tert-butyl)-N-(diethoxyphosphoryl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)aminoxy]propionic acid (27.4 ppm) and the appearance of the dialkoxyamine (multiplet at 24.7-25.1 ppm).<br>
The analysis by mass spectrometry of electrospray type shows the mass 961 (M+).<br>
Example 2 - Measurement of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the alkoxvamine (I) prepared in 1 A<br>
From the viewpoint of better characterizing the surfactant behavior of the alkoxyamine (I) where Ra = Na, the kinetics of lowering the interfacial tension of this alkoxyamine dissolved in water were observed as a function of its concentration. The value of its critical micelle concentration (CMC), of the degree of coverage and of the area per molecule of alkoxyamine adsorbed at the interface were thus evaluated.<br>
The interface against which it was chosen to operate is air. The measurements carried out in air for the alkoxyamine (I) where Ra = Na are compared with the values obtained for conventional surfactants of SDS (sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate) type.<br>
A drop tensiometer sold by ITC Concept was used to measure the interfacial tensions. The principle is as follows. A drop is automatically formed at the end of the needle of a syringe in a vessel filled with another liquid. The drop is illuminated by a uniform light source. The image of the outline of the drop is projected by a telecentric lens onto a CCD camera and then digitized. It is subsequently processed by Windrop 1.1 software in order to determine the interfacial tension, the surface area and the volume of the drop via the Laplace-Young equation. It is thus possible to monitor, as a function of the time, the variations in the interfacial tension y30 mm during, for example, the adsorption of a surfactant at the interface of two liquids (kinetics of lowering the interfacial tension) and thus to determine several of its characteristics, such as the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the degree of coverage (G), the area per molecule of surfactant at the interface (a), and the like.<br>

This measurement clearly demonstrates that the alkoxyamine can participate in the stabilization of the emulsion since it has a pronounced surfactant nature.<br>

On the one hand, an organic solution is prepared by mixing:<br>
-	85 g (i.e., 0.7 mol) of butyl acrylate,<br>

The emulsion is subsequently introduced into a 500 ml jacketed reactor and degassed with nitrogen for 10 min. The reaction medium is then brought to 112°C and this temperature is maintained by thermal regulation for 8 hours. Samples are withdrawn throughout the reaction in order:<br>

solids contents),<br>
