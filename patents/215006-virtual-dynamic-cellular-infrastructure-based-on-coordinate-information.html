BASED ON COORDINATE INFORMATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to a two-way wireless communication<br>
system and, more specifically, to a two-way wireless communication system capable<br>
of direct terminal-to-terminal communication, and indirect terminal-to-terminal<br>
communication through a terminal.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a common wireless communication system in which a user using a wireless<br>
terminal device is able to communicate with another user or is able to access a service<br>
provider such as e-mail or Internet provider, communication is established through a<br>
fixed base station. For example, in a cellular telephone system, if a first user wishes<br>
to reach a second user, the first user dials a telephone number on his cellular<br>
telephone identifying the second user"s device, then his cellular telephone transmits a<br>
message to a nearby base station (first base station), where the first user"s phone is<br>
currently registered, requesting to establish a call to the second user"s device. The<br>
first base station then directs the call from the first user"s terminal device to the<br>
second user"s device. If the second user"s device is another cellular telephone or<br>
another wireless device, then the first base station directs the call to a second base<br>
station where the second user"s device is currently registered. If the second user was<br>
registered in the same cell as the first user, the first base station may function as a<br>
router and establish a call between the first and second users. However, this routing<br>
of the call through a base station is a requirement regardless of relative positions of<br>
the first and second users. Even if the first and second users are only one block apart<br>
and the nearest base station is ten miles away, the call still must be routed though the<br>
base station before reaching the user.<br>
Another common wireless communication system is a paging system. In a<br>
one-way paging system, a caller typically enters an identification number of a specific<br>
pager by telephone or by internet web page, either directly or through a provider"s<br>
service center, and enters the number or message to be sent to the pager. The call<br>
reaches the provider"s paging system identifying the pager to be paged and the<br>
message to be sent. The provider"s system then activates some or all of its paging<br>
base stations, and transmits the message to the pager. However, the person receiving<br>
the message on the pager still needs another communication system such as a<br>
telephone in order to return a reply message. To overcome this shortcoming, a two-<br>
way paging system, where a pager itself can originate a message and can transmit it to<br>
another pager, has been proposed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,246.<br>
However, the above mentioned systems are based on an infrastructure, such as<br>
base stations and telephone lines that are fixed in location and are provided by service<br>
providers, and do not allow establishing direct terminal-to-terminal communication.<br>
A terminal device used in a system, such as cellular telephone or paging system, is<br>
capable of transmitting and receiving signals but it is unable to function as a router. If<br>
there were no base station available within the range of the users, the users are unable<br>
to communicate with each other even if they are only separated by a short distance.<br>
Another shortcoming associated with the above-mentioned systems is a lack of<br>
relative and/or absolute location information of the parties or terminal devices.<br>
Normally, the first party, who originates a call or page, does not know the location of<br>
the second party.<br>
A direct portable-to-portable communication capability of a two-way radio<br>
such as a walkie-talkie is also limited that no location information is available and the<br>
range of communication is limited to the range of one walkie-talkie. It does not offer<br>
benefit derived from having an infrastructure.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to be able to provide an infrastructure<br>
capable of establishing direct communication between terminal devices without<br>
requiring a fixed base station. Such infrastructure would be capable of providing a<br>
user"s or terminal device"s location, and capable of using a terminal device as a router<br>
based on its position relative to other terminal devices so that the router aids in<br>
establishing communication between terminal devices that: are separated beyond<br>
direct connection distance. The router would also be able to establish communication<br>
between a terminal and other service access point providing services such as e-mail<br>
and Internet, which may be located beyond direct connection distance.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a system and a method for a wireless<br>
communication system capable of establishing direct terminal-to-terminal<br>
communication and indirect terminal-to-terminal communication through a terminal.<br>
The present invention can be operated as an independent system or can be operated to<br>
compliment existing systems such as cellular telephone system and paging system.<br>
A block diagram representation of a wireless communication system in<br>
accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in<br>
FIG. 1. A wireless communication system (100) comprises first (102), second (104)<br>
and third (106) portable communication devices operating in synchronization. Each<br>
portable communication device has a transceiver for communication at a particular<br>
frequency band that is compatible with each other and is used for both transmitting<br>
and receiving signals. The first portable communication device (102) is capable of<br>
establishing direct portable-to-portable communication with the second portable<br>
communication device (104), and is also capable of establishing indirect<br>
communication to the second portable device (104), which is beyond the direct<br>
communication range, by configuring the third portable communication device (106)<br>
as a router to extend the communication range. To establish direct communication<br>
with the second portable communication device (104), the first portable<br>
communication device (102) transmits (108) a first message to the second portable<br>
communication device (104). If the second portable communication device (104)<br>
successfully receives the first message, the communication is established and the<br>
second portable communication device (104) transmits (110) an acknowledgement to<br>
the first portable communication device (102). However, if the second portable<br>
communication (104) device does not successfully receive the first message, it does<br>
not send the acknowledgement. The first portable communication device (102) then<br>
acquires the third portable communication device (106), transmits (112) a second<br>
message to the third portable communication device (106), and instructs the third<br>
portable communication device (106) to re-transmit (114) the second message to the<br>
second portable communication device (104). If the second portable communication<br>
device (104) successfully receives the second message, the communication is<br>
established and the second portable communication device (104) transmits an<br>
acknowledgement (116) to the third portable communication device (106), and<br>
instructs the third portable communication device (106) to re-transmit (118) the<br>
acknowledgement to the first portable communication device (102).<br>
However, if the third portable communication device (106) fails to receive an<br>
acknowledgement (116) from the second portable communication device (104), then<br>
the third portable communication device (106) may acquire a fourth portable<br>
communication device (202) having a transceiver for communication at a particular<br>
frequency band that is compatible with the first, second, and third portable<br>
communication device (102,104, and 106, respectively) as illustrated in FIG. 2. The<br>
third portable communication device (106), functioning as a first router, re-transmits<br>
(204) the second message to the fourth portable communication device (202),<br>
functioning as a second router, and instructs the fourth portable communication<br>
device (202) to transmit (206) the second message to the second portable<br>
communication device (104). If the second portable communication device (104)<br>
successfully receives the second message, communication is established and the<br>
second portable communication device (104) transmits an acknowledgement (208) to<br>
the fourth portable communication device (202) which instructs the fourth portable<br>
communication device (202) to re-transmit (210) the acknowledgement to the third<br>
portable communication device (106) which instructs the third portable<br>
communication device (106) to re-transmit (212) the acknowledgement to the first<br>
portable communication device (102). If the second portable communication device<br>
(202) still fails to transmit an acknowledgement, then the process, having the last<br>
router acquire another portable communication device and instruct it to re-transmit the<br>
message, repeats until the second portable communication device (202) transmits an<br>
acknowledgement, or repeats until a predetermined number of routers has been<br>
reached in order to avoid an unending re-transmission.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, while functioning as a router, the third portable<br>
communication device (106) is still capable of establishing a separate direct portable-<br>
to-portable communication (302, 304) with a fourth portable communication device<br>
(306) having a transceiver for communication at a particular frequency band that is<br>
compatible with the first, second, and third portable communication device (102, 104,<br>
and 106, respectively). By employing a multiple-slot modulation scheme such as a<br>
frequency hopping spread spectrum (PHSS), the third portable communication device<br>
(106) is able to function as arouter (112,114, and 116,118) for the first and second<br>
communication devices (102 and 104, respectively) using one slot, and still be able to<br>
establish the separate direct communication (302,304) with the fourth portable<br>
communication device (306) using another slot.<br>
Each of the preferred embodiments of the wireless communication system<br>
according to the present invention so far described has been an independent system<br>
without a fixed base station or a wired infrastructure. However, another aspect of the<br>
wireless communication system according to the present invention is an enhancement<br>
to an existing infrastructure. FIG. 4 illustrates a fourth preferred embodiment of the<br>
wireless communication system (400) according to the present invention<br>
complementing an existing infrastructure. Each of a plurality of portable<br>
communication devices in the wireless communication system (400) functions as a<br>
portable unit of the existing infrastructure. First, second, and third portable<br>
communication devices (402,404, and 406, respectively) of the plurality of portable<br>
communication devices are shown in FIG. 4. A base station (408), being a<br>
component of the existing infrastructure such as a cellular phone system or a paging<br>
system, is connected to a wire communication system such as a landline based<br>
telephone system (410). The base station (408) is capable of communicating with any<br>
of the plurality of portable communication devices that are within the communication<br>
range (412) of the base station (408). As a function of the existing infrastructure, a<br>
caller, by using the telephone system (410), is able to establish communication (414,<br>
416) with the third portable communication device (406) through the base station<br>
(408). An enhancement to the existing infrastructure is provide by enabling the caller<br>
using the telephone system (410) to establish communication (414,416) with the third<br>
portable communication device (406) through the base station (408) while the third<br>
portable communication device (406) is functioning as a router (418,420, and 422,<br>
424) for the first and the second portable communication devices (402 and 404,<br>
respectively). The communication (416) from the base station (408) to the third<br>
portable communication device (406) is accomplished employing the communication<br>
protocol utilized in the existing infrastructure. Depending on the infrastructure, such<br>
as paging or cellular telephone infrastructure, in which the wireless communication<br>
system according to the present invention is deployed, the protocol used in the<br>
existing infrastructure may be paging, time-division-multiple-access (TDMA), code-<br>
division-multiple-access (CDMA), or global-system for mobile (GSM) protocol.<br>
Whereas each portable communication device employs a multiple-slot modulation<br>
scheme such as a frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), to communicate to<br>
each other.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a fifth preferred embodiment of the wireless communication<br>
system (500) according to the present invention, further enhancing the system<br>
described in the fourth preferred embodiment, by providing a transceiver that is<br>
compatible with the transceivers of the portable communication devices with the base<br>
station (502). The base station (502) is connected to a service provider (504) such as<br>
an Internet provider, and is capable of exchanging information with the service<br>
provider (504) by way of an existing network (506) such as a telephone network. A<br>
first portable communication device (508) of a plurality of portable communication<br>
devices in the wireless communication system (500) is capable of establishing<br>
communication with the service provider (504) through the base station (502). In<br>
addition, because each of the plurality of portable communication devices is capable<br>
of functioning as a router as previously described, a second portable communication<br>
device (510) is also able to access the service provider (504) by establishing<br>
communication (512,514) with the first portable communication device (508), and<br>
using the first portable communication device (508) as a router communicating (516,<br>
518) with the base station (502). While functioning as a router, the first portable<br>
communication device (508) is capable of establishing a separate independent<br>
communication (520,522) with a third portable communication device (524).<br>
An exemplary block diagram representation of a wireless communication<br>
system (600) in accordance with a sixth preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is illustrated in FIG. 6. The wireless communication system (600)<br>
comprises a positioning system (602) such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and a<br>
plurality of portable communication devices scattered over some area. Each of the<br>
plurality of portable communication devices has a transceiver for communication at a<br>
particular frequency band that is compatible with each other such as a frequency<br>
hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) transceiver, and a positioning system receiver such<br>
as a GPS receiver. Geographical area where the wireless communication system (600)<br>
is deployed is partitioned into multiple cells with each cell defined by its cell<br>
boundary line, and with one cell defined as a reference cell whose coordinate is used<br>
by all other cells as a reference (four cells, 604 having cell boundary line 605, 606<br>
having cell boundary line 607, 608 having boundary cell line 609, and 610 having cell<br>
boundary line 611 are shown in FIG. 6). Each cell has a specific coordinate defining<br>
its geographical area and its position relative to the reference cell. In FIG. 6, cell 604<br>
is shown as the reference cell having a cell coordinate of C(0, 0). Cell 606, having a<br>
cell coordinate C(l, 1), is located relative to the reference cell one cell away in the<br>
positive x-axis direction and one cell away in the positive y axis direction. Similarly,<br>
Cell 608 has a cell coordinate C(0, -1) and Cell 610 has a cell coordinate C(1, -1),<br>
each describing its location relative to the reference cell 604. Each cell has a<br>
predetermined set of communication parameters assigned to it to be used within the<br>
cell by a potable communication device. First, second, third, and fourth portable<br>
communication devices (612, 614, 616, and 618, respectively) of the plurality of<br>
portable communication devices are shown in FIG. 6 within a first cell (604). The<br>
wireless communication system (600) may be a part of an existing wireless network<br>
(628) such as a paging system or cellular telephone network with each of the plurality<br>
of portable communication devices also being capable of operating in the existing<br>
wireless network (628).<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary division of each cell into three regions, each<br>
region having a specific set of parameters to be used by the portable communication<br>
devices further defining their functions in the region. Each portable communication<br>
device updates its location information via GPS periodically as it may move from one<br>
cell to another, or from one region to another within the same cell, and the role of the<br>
portable communication device in the wireless communication system (600) is<br>
determined based on its location. The GPS may help establish synchronization for<br>
portable communication devices to work properly in the wireless communication<br>
system (600).<br>
A central region (702) is defined by a first boundary line (704), and portable<br>
communication devices that are located within the central region (one shown 616) are<br>
classified as center boundary units (CBUs). The CBUs are responsible for relaying<br>
messages across the cell when a direct communication between two portable<br>
communication devices within the same cell is not established. CBUs are also<br>
capable of generating and receiving their own messages as previously described<br>
portable communication devices in the system. When a portable communication<br>
device enters into the central region (702) and receives GPS information, the portable<br>
communication device identifies itself as a CBU and based on its current GPS<br>
information registers itself to the wireless communication system (600) as a CBU, and<br>
periodically transmits its location, identification, and duration as a CBU. To avoid<br>
depleting a cell of CBUs, a first portable communication device functioning as a CBU<br>
must be replaced by a second portable communication device which has been<br>
registered as a CBU before the first portable communication devices stops functioning<br>
as a CBU unless the first portable unit leaves the center boundary. For example, in<br>
FIG. 7, if the first portable communication device (616) leaves the central region<br>
(702), it may stop functioning as a CBU. However, the first portable communication<br>
device may not stop functioning as a CBU due to the amount of time it has been a<br>
CBU or power requirements unless a replacement has been registered. When a CBU<br>
is connected to a battery, it identifies itself and registers to the wireless<br>
communication system (600) as a reliable static center boundary unit (RSCBU), and<br>
may function as a CBU for a longer period of time.<br>
A second region (706) is defined by the first boundary line (704) and a second<br>
boundary line (708), and portable communication devices that are located within the<br>
second region (one shown 618) are classified as regular portable units (RPUs). A<br>
portable communication device determines its classification based on its location<br>
through GPS. RPUs are capable of generating and receiving their own messages as<br>
previously described portable communication devices in the system but unlike CBUs,<br>
RPUs are not responsible for relaying messages.<br>
An outer region (710) is defined by the second boundary line (708) and the<br>
cell boundary line (605), and portable communication devices that are located within<br>
the outer region (two shown 612 and 614) are classified as outer boundary units<br>
(OBUs). The cell (604) is further divided into six sectors, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6<br>
(712,714,716,718,720, and 722, respectively), and a portable communication unit<br>
in the outer region determines its classification and its sector location based on its<br>
location through GPS. Each sector is located adjacent to another sector of an adjacent<br>
cell (sector 716 of cell 604 and sector 724 of cell 610 are shown). OBUs are capable<br>
of generating and receiving their own messages as previously described portable<br>
communication devices in the system. The OBUs are responsible for relaying<br>
messages to the adjacent cell. When a portable communication device enters into the<br>
outer region (710) and receives GPS information, the portable communication device<br>
identify itself as an OBU based on its current GPS information registers itself to the<br>
wireless communication system (600) as an OBU, and periodically transmits its<br>
location and identification an OBU.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary flowchart (800) describing how the first<br>
portable communication device (612) may register itself to the wireless<br>
communication system (600) and identify its function appropriately.<br>
In step 802, the first portable communication device (612) is turned on, and<br>
then in step 804, it obtains the time and frequency synchronization information from<br>
the positioning system (602). In step 806, the first portable communication device<br>
(612) also identifies the cell in which it is currently located based on the information<br>
received from the positioning system (602). In step 808, the first portable<br>
communication device (612) further obtains the communication parameters that are<br>
predetermined and are specific to the cell in which it is currently located. In step 810,<br>
the first portable communication device (612) determines whether to function as an<br>
RPU based on which region of the cell in which it is currently located. If the first<br>
portable communication device (612) determines to function as an RPU, then it<br>
collects information from CBUs and OBUs that are located in the same cell as itself<br>
(812) as shown in step 812, and then proceeds to function normally as shown in step<br>
814.<br>
However, if the first portable communication device (612) determines not to<br>
function as an RPU, then it, as in step 816, determines whether to function as a CBU<br>
based on which region of the cell it is currently located. If the first portable<br>
communication device (612) determines to function as a CBU, then it broadcasts and<br>
identifies itself as a CBU in step 818, collects information from OBUs that are located<br>
in the same cell as itself in step 820. In step 822, the first portable communication<br>
device (612) periodically transmits its location based information and collects OBU<br>
information, and then proceeds to function normally in step 814.<br>
However, if the first portable communication device (612) determines not to<br>
function as a CBU, then it functions as an OBU, broadcasts and identifies itself as an<br>
OBU in step 824. The first portable communication device (612) then collects<br>
information from CBUs that are located in the same cell as itself and from CBUs that<br>
are located in the adjacent cells in step 826. The first portable communication device<br>
(612) periodically transmits its location based information and collects CBU<br>
information in step 828, and then proceeds to function normally in step 814.<br>
FIGs. 9 and 10 illustrate exemplary flowcharts (900 and 1000) describing how<br>
the first portable communication device (612) in the first cell (604) attempts to<br>
establish communication with the second portable communication device (614) within<br>
the same cell (604).<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates how the attempt is differentiated based on the knowledge of<br>
the location of the second portable communication device (614) within the same cell<br>
(604), and illustrates an exemplary method when the location of the second portable<br>
communication device (614) within the same cell (604) is known. In step 902, when<br>
the first portable communication device (612) is turned on, the first portable<br>
communication device (612) goes through the registration process in step 904 as<br>
described in FIG. 8. When the user of the first portable communication device (612)<br>
enters a message and identifies the second portable communication device (614) as a<br>
recipient, the first portable communication devices (612) determines in step 906<br>
whether the location of the second portable communication device (614) is known to<br>
be outside of the first cell (604). If the first portable communication devices (612) so<br>
determines, then it begins the out-of-cell broadcast process in step 908. Otherwise,<br>
the first portable communication device (612) determines whether the location of the<br>
second portable communication device (614) within the first cell is known in step<br>
910. If the location of the second portable communication device (614) within the<br>
first cell (604) is not known, the first portable communication device (612) begins the<br>
indefinite location broadcast process in 912. If the location of the second portable<br>
communication device (614) within the first cell (604) is known, then the first<br>
portable communication device (612) transmits the message using the most<br>
appropriate path in step 914. The most appropriate path may be a direct path or a<br>
previously used path that successfully established communication with the second<br>
portable. For example, if the last time the first portable communication device (612)<br>
successfully established communication with the second portable communication<br>
device (614) was by way of devices 612 to 616 to 614, then first portable<br>
communication device transmits the message using this path. In step 916, the first<br>
portable communication device (612) then waits to receive an acknowledgement<br>
(ACK) from the second portable device of the message reception for predetermined<br>
time to avoid waiting for the ACK indefinitely. An ACK may include, in addition to<br>
an actual acknowledgement of the message reception, the time of reception, the<br>
location of the second portable device, the message path, and other desired<br>
information. If the first portable communication device (612) receives an ACK<br>
within the predetermined time, then in step 918, it indicates that the message was<br>
successfully received, and resumes its normal operation in step 920. The user of the<br>
first portable communication device (612) may start preparing a new message, and<br>
repeat the process from step 906. If the first portable communication device (612)<br>
does not receives an ACK within the predetermined time, then in step 922, it checks<br>
whether the message has been transmitted a predetermined number (N1) of times. If<br>
N1 has not been exceeded, then the first portable communication device in step 914<br>
re-transmits the message using the most appropriate path. If N1 has been reached,<br>
then the second portable communication device is treated as out-of-reach in step 924<br>
and the first portable communication device resumes its normal operation in step 920.<br>
The user may start preparing a new message, and repeat the process from step 906.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary method when the location of the second<br>
portable communication device (614) within the first cell (604) is not known, and the<br>
first portable communication device (612) begins the indefinite location broadcast<br>
process in step 912. In step 1002, the user of the first portable communication device<br>
(612) chooses a message status between broadcasting the message only within the<br>
first cell (604) or broadcasting to other cells if the second portable communication<br>
device (614) is not reached within the first cell (604), and the message is<br>
appropriately marked to indicate the user"s choice. In step 1004, the first portable<br>
communication device (612) transmits the message directly targeting the second<br>
portable communication device (614), then in step 1006, waits to receive an ACK<br>
from the second portable communication device (614) of the message reception for a<br>
predetermined time. If the first portable communication device (612) receives an<br>
ACK within the predetermined time, then in step 918, it indicates that the message<br>
was successfully received, and resumes its normal operation in step 920. The user<br>
may start preparing a new message, and repeat the process from step 906.<br>
If the first portable communication device (612) does not receive an ACK<br>
within the predetermined time, then it, in step 1008, determines whether it is<br>
functioning as a CBU. If the first portable communication device (612) determines<br>
that it is functioning as a CBU then in step 1010, it checks whether the message has<br>
been transmitted a predetermined number (N2) of times. If N2 has not been<br>
exceeded, then in step 1004, the first portable communication device re-transmits the<br>
message directly targeting the second portable communication device (614). If N2<br>
has been reached, then in step 1012, the first portable communication device (612)<br>
checks the message status. If the message status shows that the broadcasting is<br>
limited within the first cell (604), then the second portable communication device is<br>
treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the first portable communication device<br>
resumes its normal operation in step 920. The user may start preparing a new<br>
message, and repeat the process from step 906. If the message status shows that the<br>
broadcasting is to continue to other cells if the second portable communication device<br>
(614) is not reached within the first cell (604), then it begins the out-of-cell broadcast<br>
process in step 908.<br>
If the first portable communication device (612) determines that it is not<br>
functioning as a CBU, then it searches for a first CBU to be used as a router in step<br>
1014. If no CBU is available to be used as a router, in step 1010, the first portable<br>
communication device (612) determines whether the message has been transmitted a<br>
predetermined number (N2) of times. If N2 has not been exceeded, then in step 1004,<br>
the first portable communication device re-transmits the message directly targeting<br>
the second portable communication device (614). If N2 has been reached, then the<br>
first portable communication device (612) checks the message status in step 1012. If<br>
the message status shows that the broadcasting is limited within the first cell (604),<br>
then the second portable communication device is treated as out-of-reach in step 924<br>
and the first portable communication device resumes its normal operation in step 920.<br>
The user may start preparing a new message, and repeat the process from step 906. If<br>
the message status shows that the broadcasting is to continue to other cells if the<br>
second portable communication device (614) is not reached within the first cell (604),<br>
then it begins the out-of-cell broadcast process in step 908.<br>
If a first CBU (616) is available to be used as a router, then the first portable<br>
communication device (612) transmits the message to the first CBU (616) in step<br>
1016, and instructs the first CBU (616) to re-transmit the message to the second<br>
portable communication device (614) in step 1018. Then, in step 1020, the first<br>
portable communication device (612) waits to receive an ACK from the second<br>
portable communication device (614) of the message reception through the first CBU<br>
(616) for a predetermined time. If the first portable communication device (612)<br>
receives an ACK within the predetermined time, then it indicates that the message<br>
was successfully received in step 918, and resumes its normal operation in 920. The<br>
user may start preparing a new message, and repeat the process from step 906. If the<br>
first portable communication device (612) does not receive an ACK within the<br>
predetermined time, then, in step 1010, it checks whether the message has been<br>
transmitted a predetermined number (N2) of times. If N2 has not been exceeded, then<br>
the first portable communication device re-transmits the message directly targeting<br>
the second portable communication device (614) in step 1004. If N2 has been<br>
reached, then the first portable communication device (612) checks the message status<br>
in step 1012. If the message status shows that the broadcasting is limited within the<br>
first cell (604), then the second portable communication device is treated as out-of-<br>
reach (924) and the first portable communication device resumes its normal operation<br>
in step 920. The user may start preparing a new message, and repeat the process from<br>
step 906. If the message status shows that the broadcasting is to continue to other<br>
cells if the second portable communication device (614) is not reached within the first<br>
cell (604), then it begins the out-of-cell broadcast process in step 908.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary block diagram representation of a wireless<br>
communication system (1100) according to a seventh preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention of a setup for an out-of-cell broadcast in step 908. A first portable<br>
communication device (1102) of a plurality of portable communication devices<br>
located in a first cell (1104) attempts to establish communication with a second<br>
portable communication device (1106) of the plurality of portable communication<br>
devices located in a second cell (1108). As previously illustrated, the wireless<br>
communication system (1100) comprises a positioning system (1110) such as Global<br>
Positioning System (GPS) and the plurality of portable communication devices<br>
scattered over some area. Each of the plurality of portable communication devices<br>
has a transceiver for communication at a particular frequency band that is compatible<br>
with each other such as a frequency hopping spread spectrum (EHSS) transceiver, and<br>
a positioning system receiver such as a GPS receiver. Geographical area where the<br>
wireless communication system (1100) is deployed is partitioned into multiples cells<br>
(two cells, 1104 and 1108 are shown in FIG. 11). Each cell has a central region<br>
(1112,1114) around acenter, a second region (1116,1118) surrounding the central<br>
region (1112,1114) and an outer region surrounding the second region within the<br>
boundary (1120,1122), and the outer region is divided into six sectors, each of which<br>
is adjacent to a different cell. Each portable communication device is classified as a<br>
center boundary unit (CBU), a reliable static center boundary unit (RSCBU), a regular<br>
portable unit (RPU), or an outer boundary unit (OBU) depending on its current<br>
location, and may register itself as such in an existing wireless network.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart describing an exemplary process of the out-of-cell<br>
broadcast of step 908. Once the first portable communication device (1102)<br>
determines that the out-of-cell broadcast is desired, it first determines if the location<br>
of the second portable communication device (1106) is known in step 1202. If it is<br>
known, then in step 1204, the first portable communication device (1102) transmits<br>
the message using the most appropriate path which may be a direct path or a<br>
previously used path that successfully established communication with the second<br>
portable (1106). Then, in step 1206, the first portable communication device (1102)<br>
waits to receive an acknowledgement (ACK) from the second portable device (1106)<br>
of the message reception for predetermined time to avoid waiting for the ACK<br>
indefinitely. An ACK may include, in addition to an actual acknowledgement of the<br>
message reception, the time of reception, the location of the second portable device,<br>
the message path, and other desired information. If the first portable communication<br>
device (1102) receives an ACK within the predetermined time, then it indicates that<br>
the message was successfully received in step 918, and resumes its normal operation<br>
in step 920. The user of the first portable communication device (1102) may start<br>
preparing a new message, and repeat the process from step 906. If the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) does not receive an ACK within the predetermined<br>
time, then it checks whether the message has been transmitted a predetermined<br>
number (N3) of times in step 1208. If N3 has not been exceeded, then the first<br>
portable communication device (1102) re-transmits the message using the most<br>
appropriate path in step 1204. If N3 has been reached, then the second portable<br>
communication device (1106) is treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the first<br>
portable communication device (1102) resumes its normal operation in step 920. The<br>
user may start preparing a new message, and repeat the process from step 906.<br>
Alternatively, the user may choose to treat the location of the second portable<br>
communication device (1106) as unknown.<br>
If the location of the second portable communication device (1106) is not<br>
known, then the first portable communication device (1102) checks the length of the<br>
message against a predetermined length in step 1210. If the message length is less<br>
than the predetermined length, or the message has less than a predetermined number<br>
of characters, then, in step 1212, the first portable communication device transmits the<br>
message by general broadcast. FIG. 13 illustrates an exemplary flowchart of the<br>
general broadcast in step 1212.<br>
When the first portable communication device (1102) begins the general<br>
broadcast in step 1212, it first determines if it is functioning as a CBU in step 1302. If<br>
the first portable communication device (1102) so determines, then it searches for<br>
available OBUs in step 1304.<br>
If the first portable communication device (1102) determines that it is not<br>
functioning as a CBU in step 1302, it then searches for an available CBU in step<br>
1306. If it finds no available CBU, then the first portable communication device<br>
(1102) searches for available OBUs in step 1304. If the first portable communication<br>
device (1102) finds a CBU, it acquires the CBU in step 1308. The first portable<br>
communication device (1102) transmits the message to the CBU and instructs the<br>
CBU to search for available OBUs in step 1310. The CBU then searches for available<br>
OBUs in step 1304.<br>
If there are no available OBUs, then the second portable communication<br>
device (1106) is treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) resumes its normal operation in 920.<br>
If there is at least one OBU available, then the sector coverage is determined<br>
in step 1312. If there is an OBU available and is acquired in each sector, the message<br>
is transmitted to all acquired OBUs with an instruction for the OBUs to re-transmit<br>
the message out of the cell using a predetermined non-repeating out-of-cell<br>
propagation pattern in step 1314. If only some, but not all, of the sectors are covered<br>
by acquired OBUs, then the message is transmitted to all acquired OBUs with an<br>
instructions for the OBUs to re-transmit the message out of the cell in step 1316. The<br>
instruction may additionally instruct the OBUs to modify their predetermined out-of-<br>
cell propagation patterns to cover some of the sectors which have no available OBUs.<br>
The first portable communication device (1102) is notified that the message is<br>
transmitted beyond the cell boundary in step 1318.<br>
Successful delivery of the message to all the acquired OBUs is determined by<br>
receiving acknowledgements (ACK) from the OBUs in step 1320. If ACKs from all<br>
the acquired OBUs are received, the OBUs transmit the message to the adjacent<br>
CBUs, and the message is propagated using an appropriate pattern in step 1322. The<br>
first portable communication device (1102) then waits for an ACK from the second<br>
portable communication device (1106) in step 1324. If the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) receives an ACK within the predetermined time, then it<br>
indicates that the message was successfully received in step 918, and resumes its<br>
normal operation in step 920. If the first portable communication device (1102) does<br>
not receive an ACK from the second portable communication device (1106) within<br>
the predetermined time, then the second portable communication device (1106) is<br>
treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the first portable communication device (1102)<br>
resumes its normal operation in step 920. Alternatively, the first portable<br>
communication device may acquire a different set of OBUs or may acquire a different<br>
CBU and instruct it to acquire a different set of OBUs, and repeat the general<br>
broadcast process.<br>
If only a subset of the acquired OBUs return an ACK, then the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) determines whether the message has been transmitted a<br>
predetermined number (N4) of times in step 1326. If N4 has not been exceeded, then<br>
the first portable communication device (1102) may partially repeat the general<br>
broadcast process. If N4 has been reached, then the message is re-transmitted only by<br>
the OBUs that have returned an ACK in step 1322. The first portable communication<br>
device (1102) then waits for an ACK from the second portable communication device<br>
(1106) in step 1324. If the first portable communication device (1102) receives an<br>
ACK within the predetermined time, then it indicates that the message was<br>
successfully received in step 918, and resumes its normal operation in step 920. If the<br>
first portable communication device (1102) does not receive an ACK from the second<br>
portable communication device (1106) within the predetermined time, then the second<br>
portable communication device (1106) is treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the<br>
first portable communication device (1102) resumes its normal operation in step 920.<br>
Alternatively, the first portable communication device may acquire a different set of<br>
OBUs or may acquire a different CBU and instruct it to acquire a different set of<br>
OBUs, and repeat the general broadcast process.<br>
If the message length exceeds the predetermined length, then the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) generates a locator message specifically for locating the<br>
second portable communication device (1106) in step 1214. The locator message is<br>
sent using the same method as the general broadcast of step 1212 to locate the second<br>
portable communication device (1106) in step 1216. Instead of receiving an ACK for<br>
a successful message delivery, if the locator message reaches the second portable<br>
communication device (1106), the first portable communication device (1102)<br>
receives a successful path that the message took to reach the second portable<br>
communication device (1106) which the first portable communication device (1102)<br>
will use to transmit the message. If the locator message does not reach the second<br>
portable communication device (1106), then the second portable communication<br>
device (1106) is treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) resumes its normal operation in step 920.<br>
If the locator message reaches the second portable communication device<br>
(1106), then, in step 1204, the first portable communication device (1102) transmits<br>
the message using the most appropriate path based on the additional knowledge of the<br>
location of the second portable communication device (1106). The first portable<br>
communication device (1102) then waits to receive an ACK from the second portable<br>
device of the message reception for a predetermined time to avoid waiting for the<br>
ACK indefinitely in step 1206. If the first portable communication device (1102)<br>
receives an ACK within the predetermined time, then it indicates that the message<br>
was successfully received in step 918, and resumes its normal operation in step 920.<br>
If the first portable communication device (1102) does not receive an ACK within the<br>
predetermined time, then it determines whether the message has been transmitted a<br>
predetermined number (N3) of times in step 1208. If N3 has not been exceeded, then<br>
the first portable communication device re-transmits the message using the most<br>
appropriate path in step 1204. If N3 has been reached, then the second portable<br>
communication device is treated as out-of-reach in step 924 and the first portable<br>
communication device resumes its normal operation in step 920.<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of communications among<br>
portable communication devices of FIG. 11 for an out-of-cell general broadcasting<br>
communication.<br>
The first portable communication device (1102) determines that it is not<br>
functioning as a CBU in step 1302, searches for an available CBU in step 1306, and<br>
acquires the CBU (1124) from the plurality of portable communication devices<br>
located within the first central region (1112) of the first cell (1104) to be used as a<br>
router in step 1308. In step 1310, the first portable communication device (1102) then<br>
transmits to the CBU (1124) the message and instruction to search for available OBUs<br>
located in the first outer region (1120) of the first cell (1104) as indicated by an arrow<br>
1402. As shown in FIG. 14, there is an OBU available and is acquired in each sector<br>
as in step 1312, and the CBU (1124) transmits the message to all acquired OBUs<br>
(1126,1128,1130,1138,1140, and 1142) with an instruction for the OBUs to re-<br>
transmit the message out of the cell using a predetermined non-repeating out-of-cell<br>
propagation pattern as in step 1314. The OBUs return, as in step 1320, ACKs to the<br>
CBU (1124). The communications between the CBU (1124) and OBUs are illustrated<br>
by arrows 1404,1406, 1408,1410,1412, and 1414. The transmissions of the message<br>
by the OBUs out of the cell are illustrated by arrows 1416,1418,1420,1422,1424,<br>
and 1426. The first portable communication device (1102) is notified that the<br>
message is transmitted (1318) beyond the cell boundary, and waits for an ACK from<br>
the second portable communication device (1106) as in step 1324.<br>
Acquiring of OBUs may be shared between the CBU (1124) and the first<br>
portable communication device (1102) as illustrated in FIG. 15.<br>
The first portable communication device (1102) first acquires a CBU (1124)<br>
from the plurality of portable communication devices located within a first central<br>
region (1112) of the first cell (1104) to be used as a router, then instructs the CBU<br>
(1124) to acquire a first set of up to three OBUs (1126,1128, and 1130) from the<br>
plurality of portable communication devices located in the first outer region (1120) of<br>
the first cell (1104). The communication between the CBU (1124) and the first<br>
portable communication device (1102) is shown as an arrow, 1502, and the<br>
communications between the CBU (1124) and the first set of OBUs (1126,1128, and<br>
1130) are shown as arrows, 1504,1506, and 1508. Each of the first set of OBU is<br>
located in a different sector (1132,1134, and 1136, respectively) of the first outer<br>
region (1120) of the first cell (1104).<br>
The first portable communication device (1102) also acquires a second set of<br>
up to three OBUs (1138,1140, and 1142) from the plurality of portable<br>
communication devices located in the first outer region (1120) of the first cell (1104).<br>
The communications between the first portable communication device (1102) and the<br>
second set of OBUs (1138,1140, and 1142) are shown as arrows, 1510,1512, and<br>
1514. Each of the second set of OBUs is located in a different sector of the first outer<br>
region (1120) of the first cell (1104) from each other and from the first set (1144,<br>
1146, and 1148, respectively).<br>
The first portable communication device (1102) then transmits a message<br>
targeted for the second portable device (1106) along with an out-of-cell broadcast<br>
request to the CBU (1124) and to the second set of up to three OBUs (1138,1140, and<br>
1142).<br>
Upon receiving the message, the CBU (1124) is then instructed to re-transmit<br>
the first message along with an out-of-cell broadcast request to the first set of up to<br>
three OBUs (1126,1128, and 1130). The first and second sets of OBUs (1126,1128,<br>
1130,1138,1140, and 1142), upon receiving the message along with an out-of-cell<br>
broadcast request, are instructed to transmit the first message to cells adjacent to each<br>
of the first and second sets of OBUs (1126,1128, 1130,1138,1140, and 1142). The<br>
transmissions of the message by the OBUs are shown by arrows 1516,1518, 1520,<br>
1522,1524, and 1526.<br>
Then the first portable communication device (1102) waits to receive an ACK<br>
from the second portable communication device (1106) of the message reception<br>
through one of the first and second sets of OBUs (1126,1128,1130,1138,1140, and<br>
1142), and determines whether the second portable communication device has<br>
successfully received the first message. An ACK may include, in addition to an<br>
actual acknowledgement of the message reception, the time of reception, the location<br>
of the second portable device, the message path, and other desired information. If the<br>
first portable communication device (1102) receives an ACK within a predetermined<br>
time, then it indicates that the message was successfully received, and resume the<br>
normal operation. The user of the first portable communication device (1102) may<br>
start preparing a new message, and repeat the process. If the first portable<br>
communication device (1102) does not receive an ACK within the predetermined<br>
time, then the above described steps may be repeated for a predetermined number of<br>
times to avoid an infinite loop. This process loop may require to search for a different<br>
CBU from the CBU previously used and different sets of OBUs from the previous<br>
sets of OBUs already used.<br>
For establishing communication between two portable communication devices<br>
located in different cells, each OBU functions as a message originating portable<br>
communication device upon receiving an out-of-cell broadcast request. However, to<br>
avoid transmitting the same message to any one cell more than once, a predetermined,<br>
non-repeating pattern of message propagation is preferably used. FIG. 16 illustrates<br>
an example of such non-repeating pattern (1600). A transmission from a CBU to an<br>
OBU within a cell is shown with a solid-line arrow, and a transmission from an OBU<br>
to a CBU in an adjacent cell is shown with a dashed-line arrow. The message<br>
originating portable communication device is located in the reference cell designated<br>
C(0,0).<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates another example of a non-repeating pattern of propagation<br>
based upon cell locations. If the message originates from a first portable<br>
communication device (1702) in the reference cell (1704), then the message<br>
propagates along the first path (1706) reaching all the cells. If the message originates<br>
from a second portable communication device (1708) from a cell (1710) that is not the<br>
reference cell (1704), the message propagate along a second path (1712) which is the<br>
same path in the same direction as the first path for the cells ahead of the originating<br>
cell (1710) and a third path (1714) which the same path but: in the opposite direction<br>
as the first path for the cells behind the originating cell (1710). However, if the<br>
destination cell is known (1718), then the message may propagate from the<br>
originating cell (1716) using the most direct path (1720).<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 18, if the location of the second portable communication<br>
device (1802) is known, then the first portable communication device (1804) which<br>
originates a message, need not use the predetermined non-repeating pattern as<br>
previously illustrated. Instead, the first portable communication device (1804) may<br>
use an appropriate path (1806 shown with solid-line arrows) which may be more<br>
direct compared to the path specified (1808 shown as dashed-line arrows) by the<br>
predetermined non-repeating pattern. However, if a CBU or an OBU is unavailable in<br>
a cell that helps form the most direct path, then an appropriate path may not be the<br>
most direct path. An example of an appropriate path that is not most direct (1810 as<br>
double-line arrows) is also illustrated in FIG. 18.<br>
FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary application of the present invention. The<br>
communication system (1900) in this example comprises two zones (1902 and 1904)<br>
that are physically separated from each other: the first zone, Zone 1 (1902), may cover<br>
the EPCOT center region of Walt Disney World, and the second zone, Zone 2 (1904),<br>
may cover the Magic Kingdom region. Each zone comprises local cells (12 cells<br>
shown in each zone) and a zone translator (first and second zone translators, 1906 and<br>
1908, respectively). The zone translators (1906 and 1908) function as reliable static<br>
center boundary units (RSCBUs), but are fixed in place (1906 in cell 1910 and 1908<br>
in cell 1912), and compared to a normal portable device, have more power to cover<br>
the distance between zones and have more processing capability to handle multiple<br>
communication requirement between zones. This example describes how a first user<br>
with a first portable communication device (1914) located in a first cell (1916) of the<br>
first zone (1902) may establish communication with a second user with a second<br>
portable communication device (1918) in a second cell (1920) of the second zone<br>
(1904). As described in the registration process illustrated in FIG. 8, all portable<br>
communication devices involved in the communication system (1900) have all<br>
relevant information associated with cells and locations.<br>
The first user identifies and selects the desired destination for his message<br>
which is the second portable communication device (1918) in the Magic Kingdom<br>
(1904). A portable communication device used in this system may provide the<br>
desired destination designation as a part of its menu. Instead of displaying "Zone 2,"<br>
it would display "Magic Kingdom" and automatically associate "Magic Kingdom"<br>
with a system area designation of Zone 2 (1904), thereby making it easier for the user<br>
to identify and differentiate designated areas. It may also provide a user definable<br>
identification for portable communication devices such that user names can be used to<br>
identify portable communication devices.<br>
The first user then enters a message into the first portable communication<br>
device (1914) and transmits the message to the second portable communication<br>
device (1918) by selecting, for example, the "SEND" command. The first portable<br>
communication device attaches header information to the message to control the<br>
propagation of the message comprising; the identifications of the origination and<br>
destination zones, allowed propagation zones, portable communication devices, and<br>
cells; acknowledgement (ACK) request; time stamp; and termination requirement by<br>
time or number of hops to prevent an infinite propagation. As the message propagates<br>
through different portables functioning as CBUs or OBUs in different cells, each of<br>
these portables may attach additional header information to the message such as its<br>
identification, the message propagation path up to that point, elapsed time, and<br>
number hops so far.<br>
In this example, because the user has chosen the Magic Kingdom as the<br>
message destination which is the Zone 2 (1904), the message is sent along an<br>
appropriate path directed to the first zone translator (1906) to be transmitted to the<br>
second zone translator (1908) in the Zone 2 (1904). If the destination of the message<br>
is unknown, the message follows a predetermined non-repeating propagation pattern<br>
such as the pattern previously describe in FIG. 12. To prevent multiple portable<br>
communication devices in the Zone 1 (1902) from attempting to communicate to<br>
other portable that are outside of the Zone 1 (1902) such as those in the Zone 2<br>
(1904), the forwarding of the message is terminated in the Zone 1 (1902) except for<br>
the message reaching the first Zone translator (1906). The first zone translator (1906)<br>
then transmits the message to other zone translators in the system. If the header<br>
indicates that the message is only allowed to be sent within a single zone, for<br>
example, the destination zone is the same as the origination zone, the zone translator<br>
will not transmit the message to another zone translator.<br>
When the second zone translator (1912) receives the message, it extracts the<br>
header information, and updates the allowed propagation zone to the Zone 2 (1904).<br>
Only zone translators are allowed to change the allowed propagation zone header.<br>
Then the second zone translator (1912) initiates transmission of the message<br>
following a predetermined non-repeating propagation pattern such as the pattern<br>
previously describe in FIG. 12. If portable communication devices in Zone 2 (1904)<br>
receive the message from the first zone translator (1906), they will not transmit the<br>
message because the header information reveals that the allowed propagation zone for<br>
this message is the Zone 1 (1902) and not the Zone 2 (1904).<br>
If the message does not reach the second portable communication device<br>
(1918), then the message, having the allowed propagation zone to be the Zone 2<br>
(1904), terminates within the Zone 2 (1904), and will not be further transmitted. If<br>
the second portable communication device (1918) receives the message, then it<br>
transmits an ACK to the first portable communication device (1914) through an<br>
appropriate path which may be a reverse of the path taken by the message to reach the<br>
second portable communication device (1918).<br>
FIGs. 20,21 and 22 illustrate an exemplary flowchart describing how the<br>
message may be propagated out of the message originating cell utilizing a dynamic<br>
cell coordinate based propagation pattern referenced to the message originating cell.<br>
These steps may be considered to be components of the step 1212 in FIG. 12 for short<br>
message broadcast and of the step 1214 in FIG. 12 for generating locator message,<br>
having acquired all information previously described. In this example, the cell, in<br>
which the first portable communication device initiating the message is located, is<br>
considered to be the message reference cell having the cell coordinate of C(0,0).<br>
Other cells have corresponding cell coordinates referenced to the message reference<br>
cell as shown in FIG. 16. As a result of the first portable communication device<br>
failing to receive an ACK from the second portable communication device after<br>
transmitting the message within the cell C(0,0), the first portable communication<br>
device begins the general broadcast procedure. This procedure is initiated by the a<br>
message being delivered to an OBU in all sectors of cell C(0,0) with an out of cell<br>
propagation request. These OBUs propagate the message to the CBUs with adjacent<br>
sectors. For example, the OBUs in sector 1,2,3,4,5,6 propagate the message to the<br>
CBUs in the adjacent propagating cells with the adjacent sectors 4,5,6,1,2,3<br>
respectively. The CBUs of the adjacent propagating cells will try to find the second<br>
portable communication device unit within its cell before performing any further out<br>
of cell propagations. If the second unit can not be located then further out of cell<br>
propagation is performed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20, in step 2004, the coordinate values, relative to the<br>
message reference cell, of the propagating cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of<br>
coordinates where X being zero and Y being a positive odd number. If the<br>
propagating cell has the coordinates of Cprop(0, +odd), then, in step 2006, the CBU in<br>
this cell sends a message to an OBU in S1 of the cell and the OBU sends a message<br>
to a CBU in cell C(0, Y+1) location, If the propagation cell coordinates do not match<br>
this set of coordinates, then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2008, the coordinate values of the propagation cell, relative to the<br>
message reference cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being<br>
zero and Y being a negative odd number. If the propagation cell has the coordinates<br>
of Cprop(0, -odd), then, in step 2010, the CBU in C(0, -odd) sends a message to an<br>
OBU in S4 of the cell and the OBU sends a message to a CBU in a cell C(0, Y-l)<br>
location. If the propagation cell coordinate does not match this set of coordinates,<br>
then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2012, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being a negative<br>
odd number and Y being a positive even number or a negative odd number. If the<br>
propagation cell has the coordinates of Cprop(-odd, +even or -odd), then, in step 2014,<br>
the CBU in Cprop(-odd, +even or -odd), sends a message to an OBU in S6 of the cell<br>
CProp(-odd, +even or -odd), and the OBU sends a message to a CBU in a cell which<br>
has S3 adjacent to S6 of the cell Cprop(-odd, +even or -odd). If the propagation cell<br>
coordinates do not match this set of coordinates, then the next set of coordinates is<br>
used.<br>
In step 2016, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being a positive<br>
odd number and Y being a positive even number or a negative odd number. If the<br>
propagation cell has the coordinates of Cptop(+odd, +even or -odd), then, in step 2018,<br>
the CBU in Cprop(+odd, +even or -odd), sends a message to an OBU in S2 of the cell<br>
Cprop(+odd, +even or -odd), and the OBU sends a message to a CBU in a cell which<br>
has S5 adjacent to S2 of the cell Cprop(+odd, +even or -odd).If the propagation cell<br>
coordinates do not match this set of coordinates, then the next set of coordinates is<br>
used.<br>
In step 2020, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where 1) X being a non-<br>
zero even number and Y being an odd number, or 2) X being an odd number and Y<br>
being a positive odd number or a negative even number. If the propagation cell has<br>
the coordinates of Cprop(even ? 0, odd) or Cprop(odd, odd or -even), then, in step 2022,<br>
the CBU in Cprop(even # 0, odd) or Cprop(odd, odd or-even), transmits the message<br>
only within the cell Cprop(even ? 0, odd) or Cprop(odd, odd or -even).If the propagation<br>
cell coordinates do not match this set of coordinates, then the next set of coordinates<br>
is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 21, in step 2102, the coordinate values of the propagation<br>
cell relative to the message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where<br>
X being zero and Y being a non-zero positive even number. If the propagation cell<br>
has the coordinates of Cprop(0, +feven ? 0), then, in step 2104, the CBU in Cprop(0,<br>
+even ? 0), sends a message to OBUs in S1, S2, S3, S5 and S6 of the cell Cprop(0,<br>
+even ? 0), and the OBUs send a message to the CBUs in cells having S4, S5, S6,<br>
S2, and S3 adjacent to S1, S2, S3, S5 and S6 of the cell Cprop(0, +even ? 0),<br>
respectively. If the propagation cell coordinates do not match this set of coordinates,<br>
then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2106, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being zero and<br>
Y being a non-zero negative even number. If the propagation cell has the coordinates<br>
of Cprop(0, -even + 0), then, in step 2108, the CBU in Cprop(0, -even ? 0), sends a<br>
message to OBUs in S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 of the cell Cprop(0, -even ? 0), and the<br>
OBUs page CBUs in cells having S5, S6, S1, S2, and S3 adjacent to S2, S3, S4, S5<br>
and S6 of the cell Cprop(0, -even ? 0), respectively. If the propagation cell coordinates<br>
do not match this set of coordinates, then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2110, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being a positive<br>
even number and Y being zero. If the propagation cell has the coordinates of<br>
Cprop(+even, 0), then, in step 2112, the CBU in Cprop(+even, 0), sends a message to<br>
OBUs in S1, S2, S3, and S4 of the cell Cprop(+even, 0), and. the OBUs sends a<br>
message to CBUs in cells having S4, S5, S6, and S1 adjacent to S1, S2, S3, and S4 of<br>
the cell Cprop(+even, 0), respectively. If the propagation cell coordinate does not<br>
match this set of coordinates, then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2114, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being a negative<br>
even number and Y being zero. If the propagation cell has the coordinates of Cprop(-<br>
even, 0), then, in step 2116, the CBU in Cprop(-even, 0), sends a message to OBUs in<br>
SI, S4, S5, and S6 of the cell Cprop(-even, 0), and the OBUs page CBUs in cells<br>
having SI, S4, S5, and S6 adjacent to S1, S4, S5, and S6 of the cell Cprop(-even, 0),<br>
respectively. If the propagation cell coordinates do not match this set of coordinates,<br>
then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2118, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being a positive<br>
even number greater than zero and Y being a positive even number greater than zero.<br>
If the propagation cell has the coordinates of Cprop(+even &gt; 0, +even &gt; 0), then, in step<br>
2120, the CBU in Cprop(+even &gt; 0, +even &gt; 0), sends a message to OBUs in S1, S2,<br>
and S3 of the cell Cprop(+even &gt; 0, +even &gt; 0), and the OBUs page CBUs in cells<br>
having S4, S5, and S6 adjacent to S1, S2, and S3 of the cell Cprop(+even &gt; 0, +even &gt;<br>
0), respectively. If the propagation cell coordinate does not match this set of<br>
coordinates, then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
In step 2122, the coordinate values of the propagation cell relative to the<br>
message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where X being a positive<br>
even number greater than zero and Y being a negative even number. If the<br>
propagation cell has the coordinates of Cprop(+even &gt; 0, -even), then, in step 2124, the<br>
CBU in Cprop(+even &gt; 0, -even), sends a message to OBUs in S2, S3, and S4 of the<br>
cell Cprop(+even &gt; 0, -even), and the OBUs sends a message to CBUs in cells having<br>
S5, S6, and S1 adjacent to S2, S3, and S4 of the cell Cprop(+even &gt; 0, -even),<br>
respectively. If the propagation cell coordinates do not match this set of coordinates,<br>
then the next set of coordinates is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 22, in step 2202, the coordinate values of the propagation<br>
cell relative to the message cell, X and Y, are compared to a set of coordinates where<br>
X being a negative even number and Y being a positive even number. If the<br>
propagation cell has the coordinates of Cprop(-even, +even), then, in step 2204, the<br>
CBU in Cprop(-even, +even), sends a message to OBUs in S1, S5, and S6 of the cell<br>
Cprop(-even, +even), and the OBUs send a message to CBUs in cells having S4, S2,<br>
and S3 adjacent to S1, S5, and S6 of the cell Cprop(-even, +even), respectively. If the<br>
propagation cell does not have the coordinates of Cprop(-even, +even), then, in step<br>
2206, the CBU in Cprop(-even, +even), sends a message to OBUs in S4, S5, and S6 of<br>
the cell Cprop(-even, +even), and the OBUs send a message to CBUs in cells having<br>
S1, S2, and S3 adjacent to S4, S5, and S6 of the cell Cprop(-even, +even), respectively.<br>
After completing step 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022, 2104, 2108, 2112, 2116,<br>
2120,2124,2204, or 2206, the role of the CBU is checked in step 2208. If the CBU<br>
is not a zone translator, the process is completed in step 2210. If the CBU is a zone<br>
translator, then the status of the current zone is checked in step 2212. If the current<br>
zone is the intended zone, the process is completed in step 2210. If the current zone is<br>
not the intended zone, the message is forwarded to the intended zone translator in step<br>
2214, and the process is completed in step 2210.<br>
In the above examples, the information regarding the restricted, where the<br>
message is not to be forwarded, and the allowed sectors, where the message may be<br>
forwarded, may be included in the header part of the message. The information may<br>
be in a form of directional flags indicating the status of each of the sectors.<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention<br>
as defined by the appended claims.<br>
