				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for measuring convergence of the roof in a mine, quickly and accurately. This invention particularly relates to a device for measuring convergence of the roof in a mine, which is economical, easy to assemble and dismantle, maintains verticality, provides accurate measuring and easy reading and is capable of indicating the convergence quickly and accurately.<br>
In underground mines, such as in coal mines, during coal extraction process it is necessary to have a formation of underground tunnels for pathways such as roadways, railways. In such a set-up there is every possibility and tendency of the mine roof to converge. The magnitude of convergence may be detrimental for mining operation in general and safety in particular. This is particularly so in bord &amp; pillar mining. The rate of convergence of strata is an important parameter in predicting roof failure and subsequent accident occurring in mines. Also, this convergence rate is helpful in deciding the type of support system to be installed.<br>
An existing telescopic type convergence indicator is depicted in figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. In case of such existing telescopic type convergence indicator, to measure convergence rate at a particular point, one has to decide and make arrangement for two-reference points, one on the roof and another on the floor, in between which reading is to be taken. For this purpose two rods having central punch mark are grouted into roof and floor exactly vertical / perpendicular to each other. That means for every measuring point one has to drill in the roof and the floor. At the same time verticality / perpendicularity between the reference points after having drilled has to be maintained, without which errorless reading is not possible.<br>
Reference may also be made to US patent no. 4,514,905, titled: Convergence extensometer for measuring mine roof subsidence, wherein is disclosed an extensometer for measuring changes in the vertical distance between the roof and floor of a mine opening which comprises; a pair of rigid telescoping<br><br>
members, a tension spring securing said members to each other in a telescoping relationship, a hook for attaching a non-extensible cable to each of said members, and an indicator for determining telescopic movement of said members. The extensometer of this invention is utilized by securing one of said telescoping members to the roof of the mine and the other telescoping member to the floor of the mine with the axis of said members being disposed along the vertical. The telescoping members are secured, under tension, to the mine roof and floor by means of a non-extendible cable such as a steel cable. The indicator for determining the telescopic movement of the members may be a pair of lugs or flanges or other indicating marks, each member of which pair is affixed to a separate telescoping member.<br>
There are varies type of instruments available, in the hitherto known prior art, such as telescopic type convergence indicator, remote convergence indicator to measure the daily convergence of a given strata in an underground mine. Although remote convergence indicators are used widely, these are costly and generally left in goaf to collect cumulative data for longer period of time. For their installation, one has to create notches in the pillar, which is a cumbersome task. At the same time if the wire connected with it are faulty or damaged by any means, it is impossible to take reading out of it.<br>
Some other US patents are available for devices to measure the height of various items, not particularly the height between the floor and the roof of a mine. These are either optical or electronics based and are very costly and not easy in handling and to operate particularly in Indian mining conditions.<br>
From the hitherto known prior art it is seen that there is a definite need to provide a device for measuring convergence of the roof in a mine, which is economical, easy to assemble and dismantle, maintains verticality, provides accurate measuring and easy reading process and is capable of indicating the convergence fast and accurately.<br><br>
