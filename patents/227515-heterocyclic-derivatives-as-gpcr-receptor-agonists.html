The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATED AS GPCR RECEPTOR AGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. In particular, the present invention is directed to agonists of GPR116 that are useful as regulators of satiety, e.g. for the treatment of obesity, and for the treatment of diabetes.<br>
Obesity is characterized by an excessive adipose tissue mass relative to body size. Clinically, body fat mass is estimated by the body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/ height (m)2), or waist circumference. Individuals are considered obese when the BMI is greater than 30 and there are established medical consequences of being overweight. It has been an accepted medical view for some time that an increased body weight, especially as a result of abdominal body fat, is associated with an increased risk for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and numerous other health complications, such as arthritis, stroke, gallbladder disease, muscular and respiratory problems, back pain and even certain cancers.<br>
Pharmacological approaches to the treatment of obesity have been mainly concerned with reducing fat mass by altering the balance between energy intake and expenditure. Many studies have clearly established the link between adiposity and the brain circuitry involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Direct and indirect evidence suggest that serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, endocannabinoid, opioid, and histaminergic pathways in addition to many neuropeptide pathways (e.g. neuropeptide Y and melanocortins) are implicated in the central control of energy intake and expenditure. Hypothalamic centres are also able to sense peripheral hormones involved in the maintenance of body weight and degree of adiposity, such as insulin and leptin, and fat tissue derived peptides.<br>
Drugs aimed at the pathophysiology associated with insulin dependent Type I diabetes and non-insulin dependent Type II diabetes have many potential side effects and do not adequately address the dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia in a high proportion of patients. Treatment is often focused at individual patient needs using diet, exercise, hypoglycaemic agents and insulin, but there is a continuing need for novel antidiabetic agents, particularly ones that may be better tolerated with fewer adverse effects.<br>
Similarly, metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) which is characterized by hypertension and its associated pathologies including atherosclerosis, lipidemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia have been associated with decreased insulin sensitivity which can lead to abnormal blood sugar levels when challenged. Myocardial ischemia and microvascular disease is an established morbidity associated with untreated or poorly controlled metabolic syndrome. There is a continuing need for novel antiobesity and antidiabetic agents, particularly ones that are well tolerated with few adverse effects.<br>
GPR116 is a GPCR identified as SNORF25 in WO00/50562 which discloses both the human and rat receptors, US 6,468,756 also discloses the mouse receptor (accession numbers: AAN95194 (human), AAN95195 (rat) and ANN95196 (mouse)).ln humans, GPR116 is expressed in the pancreas, small intestine, colon and adipose tissue. The expression profile of the human GPR116 receptor indicates its potential utility as a target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.<br>
Williams J.P., Combinatorial Chemistry &amp; High Throughput Screening, 2000,3,43-50 discloses the compounds 4-(5-piperidin-4-yl-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-3-yl)pyridine and 4-(3-pyridin-4-yl-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-5-yl)piperidine-1-carboxylic acid 'butyl ester, synthesised as part of a compound library designed to identify dopamine D4 ligands.<br>

No pharmaceutical utility has been suggested for these compounds. The present invention relates to agonists of GPR116 which are useful as peripheral regulators of satiety, e.g. for the treatment of obesity, and for the treatment of diabetes.<br>

Further, mixtures of stereoisomers as well as isolated specific stereoisomers are also included. During the course of the synthetic procedures used to prepare such compounds, or in using racemization or epimerization procedures known to those skilled in the art, the products of such procedures can be a mixture of stereoisomers.<br>
When a tautomer of the compound of formula (I) exists, the present invention includes any possible tautomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof, except where specifically drawn or stated otherwise. When the compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof exist in the form of solvates or polymorphic forms, the present invention includes any possible solvates and polymorphic forms. A type of a solvent that forms the solvate is not particularly limited so long as the solvent is pharmacologically acceptable. For example, water, ethanol, propanol, acetone or the like can be used.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids. When the compound of the present invention is acidic, its corresponding salt can be conveniently prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases, including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from such inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper (ic and ous), ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like salts.

Since the compounds of formula (I) are intended for pharmaceutical use they are preferably provided in substantially pure<br>
form, for example at least 60% pure, more suitably at least 75% pure, especially at least 98% pure (% are on a weight for<br>
weight basis).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared as described below, in which, for illustrative purposes, -V- is shown as a<br>
group of the formula:<br>
and R1, R2, R3, R4, A, B, W, X and Y are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), in which X = N, Y = 0 and W = N, may be prepared according to the method illustrated in<br>
Scheme 1. The nitriles of formula 2 are either commercially available or can be synthesised using known techniques.<br>
Compounds of formula 2 are treated with hydroxylamine in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol-water, at elevated<br>
temperature, to afford amidoximes of formula 3 (synthesis of amidoximes is further described by A. R. Martin et al, J. Med.<br>
Chem., 2001, 44, 1560). Compounds of formula 3 are subsequently condensed with acids of formula 4, which are<br>
themselves either commercially available or can be readily synthesised using known techniques. The condensation firstly<br>
entails activation of compounds of formula 4 by, for example, formation of the mixed anhydride, in which the acid is treated<br>
with a chloroformate, such as isobutylchioroformate, in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, in a suitable<br>
solvent, such as THF or toluene, followed by addition of compounds of formula 3. Alternatively, compounds of formula 4 may<br>
be activated by conversion to the acid halide, generated by treatment of the acid with, for example, oxalyl chloride in a<br>
suitable solvent, such as CH2CI2-DMF. The intermediates arising from the condensation of amidoximes of formula 3 and<br>
acids of formula 4 are dissolved in an appropriate solvent, such as toluene or xylene, and heated under reflux, with<br>
concomitant removal of water by Dean-Stark apparatus or by molecular sieves, to form oxadiazoles of formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, amidoximes of formula 3 can firstly be treated with a suitable base, for example sodium hydride, in an<br>
appropriate solvent, such as THF, and subsequently esters of formula 5. Heating of this mixture also generates oxadiazoles<br>
of formula (I) (this process is further illustrated by R. H. Mach et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2001,9,3113).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) in which X = O, Y = N and W = N may be prepared according to the method outlined in Scheme 2. The nitrites of formula 6 are either commercially available or can be synthesised using known techniques. These are converted to the corresponding amidoximes of formula 7, as described above, and subsequently condensed with acids of formula 8, which are commercially available or can readily be synthesised by those skilled in the art. This condensation is performed in a fashion analogous to that described in Scheme 1, to afford the corresponding oxadiazoles of formula (I).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) in which X = N, Y = N and W = 0 can be synthesised as outlined in Scheme 3. The acyl chlorides<br>
of formula 9 are either commercially available or may be synthesised using known methods. The acid hydrazides of formula<br>
10 can be readily obtained by, for example, treating an ethanoiic solution of the corresponding ester with hydrazine (for<br>
further details see K. M. Kahn et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2003,11,1381). Treating the acyl chlorides of formula 9 with the<br>
acid hydrazides of formula 10 in a suitable solvent, such as pyridine, affords compounds of formula 11 (further illustrated by<br>
V. N. Kerr et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1960, 82, 186), which are then converted by POCIs at elevated temperature to<br>
compounds of formula (I) (this process is further described by S-A. Chen et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2001, 123, 2296).<br>
Similarly, compounds of formula (I) where X = Y = W = N can be prepared via the condensation of the amidrazone analogue<br>
of 10 with the appropriate activated carboxylic acid derivative, such as 9. The reactive groups in this reaction may be<br>
exchanged, i.e., an amidrazone of formula R1-A-C(=NH)NHNH2 can form a compound of formula (I) by condensation with<br>
an activated carboxylic acid derivative LG-C(=0)-B-R2 where LG is halogen or oxycarbonyl (P. H. Olesen et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem., 2003,46,3333-3341).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where X = N, Y = N, and W = S can also be prepared from compounds of formula 11 by heating<br>
with Lawesson's reagent in a suitable solvent, such as toluene or acetonitrile (D. Alter et al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32,<br>
2381-2388).	Compounds of formula (I) where X = S, Y = N and W = N can be formed from compounds of formula 12<br>
(Scheme 4) which are commercially available, or can be readily synthesised from the corresponding carbonyl compound<br>
and Lawesson's reagent under standard conditions. Treating a compound of formula 12 with a compound of formula 13 in a<br>
suitable solvent such as dichloromethane at about 20°C gives compounds of formula 14. Compounds of formula 13 can be<br>
obtained by treating the corresponding dimethylamide with Meerwein's reagent (for details see M. Brown US 3,092,637).<br>
Compounds of formula 14 are then cyclised using hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid in the presence of a base, such as<br>
pyridine, in a suitable solvent such as methanol (for further details, see A. MacLeod et al, J. Med. Chem., 1990,33,2052).<br>

The regioisomeric derivatives of formula (I), where X = N, Y = S and W = N, can be formed in a similar manner by reversing the functionality of the reactants so the R1 fragment contains the acetal moiety and the R2 fragment contains the thiocarbonyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) where W = 0, X = N and Y = CH can be formed from compounds of formula 15 (Scheme 5). Compounds of formula 15 are commercially available or synthesised using known techniques. Chlorides of formula 16 are commercially available, or can readily be formed by chlorinating the corresponding ketone using standard conditions, for example, bubbling chlorine gas through a methanol solution of the ketone (for further details see R. Gallucci &amp; R. Going, J. Org. Chem., 1981,46, 2532). Mixing a compound of formula 15 with a chloride of formula 16 in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, with heating, for instance at about 100°C gives compounds of formula (I) (for further information, see A. Hassner et al, Tetrahedron, 1989, 45, 6249). Compounds of formula (I) where W = 0, X = CH and Y = N can be formed is a similar fashion by reversing the functionality of the reactants so the R1 fragment contains the haloketone moiety and the R2 fragment contains the C(0)NH2.<br>

Alternatively, compounds of formula (I) where X = S, W = N and Y = CH can also be formed from compounds of formula 16. Heating an compound of formula 15 with phosphorus pentasulfide, followed by the addition of a compound of formula 16 followed by further heating gives compounds of formula (I) (for further details, see R. Kurkjy &amp; E. Brown, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1952, 74, 5778). The regioisomeric compounds where X = CH, W = N and Y = S can be formed is a similar fashion by reversing the functionality of the reactants, so the R1 fragment contains the haloketone moiety and the R2 fragment contains the C(0)NH2.<br>
Compounds of formula I where W = N, X = 0 and Y = CH can be formed from compounds of formula 15 and formula 17 (Scheme 6) under similar conditions to those outlined for Scheme 5. Compounds of formula I where W = S, X = N and Y = CH can also be formed from compounds of formula 15 and formula 17 using the conditions involving phosphorus pentasulfide described above.<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where X = 0, Y = N and W = CH, and where X = N, Y = 0 and W = CH and can be formed from compounds of formula 20 (Scheme 7). Acylation of compounds of formula 18 with a compound of formula 19, where Q is alkoxide or chloride, can occur under standard conditions, for example, deprotonation of ketone 18 with a suitable base, such as lithium disopropylamide or potassium ethoxide, in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, generally at low temperature. Treatment of compounds of formula 20 with hydroxylamine, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, at elevated temperature, for example 75°C, yields compounds of formula (I) as a mixture of both regioisomers of the isoxazoie. Using standard separation techniques, such as chromatography on silica gel, the individual isomers can be isolated (for further details, see M. Rowley et al, J. Med. Chem., 1997,40,2374).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where X = S, Y = N and W = CH can be formed by hydrogenation of a compound of formula (I) where X = 0, Y = N and W = CH, with platinum oxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, followed by heating with phosphorus pentasulfide to give compounds of formula (I) where X = S, Y = N and W = CH (for further details, see G. Wiegand et al, J. Med. Chem., 1971,14,1015). For details of the synthesis of the regioisomers where X = N, Y = S and W = CH also see G. Wiegand ibid).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) where X = N, Y = N and W = CH can be formed from compounds of formula 20. Treatment of compounds of formula 20 with hydrazine in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, would give rise to compounds of formula (I) where X = N, Y = N and W = CH (this process is further illustrated by R. Baker et al, J. Med. Chem., 1997,40,2374). Compounds of formula (I) in which X = CH, Y = N and W = N can be synthesised as described in Scheme 8. Bromides of formula 23 are either commercially available or may be synthesised from the corresponding ketone by, for example, treating an aqueous solution of the ketone with Br2 and HBr (as described by J. Y. Becker et al, Tetrahedron Lott., 2001,42,1571). The amidines of formula 22 may be synthesised by known methods, for example by treatment of the corresponding alkyl imidates of formula 21 with ammonia in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol (as detailed by D. A. Pearson et al, J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 1372). The imidates of formula 21 may in turn be generated by, for example, treatment of the corresponding nitrile with HCI in a suitable solvent, such as methanol (for further details see J. P. Lokensgard et al, J. Org. Chem., 1985,50,5609). Reaction of amidines of formula 22 with bromides of formula 23 in a suitable solvent, such as DMF, affords compounds of formula (I) (illustrated by N. J. Liverton et al, J. Med. Chem., 1999,42,2180).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) in which X = CH, Y = CH and W = N can be synthesised as illustrated in Scheme 9. Diketones of formula 25 are readily accessible by, for example, the condensation of ketones of formula 24, which are commercially available or are readily synthesised using known techniques, with bromides of formula 23 in a suitable solvent, such as benzene using an appropriate catalyst. Illustrative examples are described by 0. G. Kulinkovich et a), Synthesis, 2000, 9, 1259. Using a Paal-Knorr reaction, diketones of formula 25 may be treated with, for example, ammonium carbonate in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol at elevated temperature (for further details see R. A. Jones et al, Tetrahedron, 1996, 52, 8707) to afford compounds of formula (I).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) in which R2 contains either a carbamate or a sulfonamide group may be synthesised as described in Scheme 10. Compounds of formula 26, in which P represents a suitable protecting group, for example tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), may be synthesised as outlined in Schemes 1-9 above. The protecting group is firstly removed under suitable conditions to afford compounds of formula 27. In the case of the Boc group this can be achieved by treatment of compounds of formula 26 with a suitable acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, in an appropriate solvent, such as CH2CI2. Treatment of compounds of formula 27 with chloroformates of formula 28, which are generally commercially available or can be readily synthesised, in a suitable solvent, such as CH2CI2, in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, affords compounds of formula (I). Similarly, compounds of formula 27 may be reacted with sulfonyl chlorides of formula 29, which are generally commercially available or can readily be synthesised, in a suitable solvent, such as CH2CI2, in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, to afford compounds of formula (I). Compounds of formula (I) in which R2 contains a urea moiety may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 13 with an isocyanate of formula OC=N-R4. Furthermore, compounds of formula (I) in which R2 is 4-7-membered heterocyclyl substituted with a heteroaryl group may be prepared by reacting the amine 27 with the appropriate heteroaryl chloride or bromide under Pd(0) catalysis in the presence of a suitable ligand and base (Urgaonkar, S.; Hu, J.-H.; Verkade, J. G. J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68,8416-8423).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) in which R2 contains an amide group may be synthesised from compounds of formula 27 and a suitable acid (R3COOH), or activated derivative thereof, in an amide bond forming reaction.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) where R2 contains an ester moiety may be synthesised as illustrated in Scheme 11. Compounds of formula 30 in which R is an alkyl group, for example a methyl group, may be synthesised using procedures described in Schemes 1-9. The alkyl group is firstly removed under appropriate conditions to afford compounds of formula 31. For example, when R = Me compounds of formula 30 may be hydrolysed in the presence of a suitable alkali, for example LiOH, in a suitable solvent, such as water-methanol. The acids of formula 31 are then condensed with alcohols of formula 32, which are commercially available or can be synthesised using known techniques. The condensation may be achieved by, for<br>
14<br><br>
example, treating compounds of formula 31 with alcohols of formula 32 in the presence of thionyl chloride, giving rise to compounds of formula (I).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where R3 contains an ether group may also be synthesised from compounds of formula 30 as<br>
illustrated in Scheme 12. Compounds of formula 30 may be converted to the corresponding alcohol 33 by the action of a<br>
suitable reducing agent, for example diisobutylaiuminium hydride, in a suitable solvent, such as CH2CI2, and can then be<br>
treated firstly with a suitable base, such as sodium hydride, in a suitable solvent, such as THF, followed by an appropriate<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where B contains a NR5 group where R5 is hydrogen can be further transformed into compounds of formula (I) where R5 is C(0)R7, S(0)2R8, or an optionally substituted C3-7alkyl group using standard techniques known to those with skill in the art for acylation, sulfonylation and reductive amination, respectively.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) where R1 is pyridyl optionally substituted with CN can be prepared from the corresponding unsubstituted pyridine by the Reissert reaction (Fife, W. K. J. Org. Chem. 1983, 48,1375-1377). Similar reactions can be used to prepare the compounds where R' is pyridyl optionally substituted with halogen (Walters, M. A.; Shay, J. J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 7575-7578). The compounds where R1 is pyridyl optionally substituted with halogen can be transformed into the corresponding compounds where R1 is pyridyl optionally substituted with C3-7alkyl by transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions (Furstner, A., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002,124,13856-13863). Other compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by methods analogous to those described above or by methods known perse. Further details for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) are found in the examples. The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000, compounds and more preferably 10 to 100 compounds of formula (I). Compound libraries may be prepared by a combinatorial "split and mix" approach or by multiple parallel synthesis using either solution or solid phase chemistry, using procedures known to those skilled in the art.<br>
During the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), labile functional groups in the intermediate compounds, e.g. hydroxy, carboxy and amino groups, may be protected. The protecting groups may be removed at any stage in the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I) or may be present on the final compound of formula (I). A comprehensive discussion of the ways in which various labile functional groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given in, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, (1991) Wiley-lnterscience, New York, 2nd edition.<br>

Any novel intermediates as defined above are also included within the scope of the invention. As indicated above the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are useful as GPR116 agonists, e.g. for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity and diabetes.<br>
For such use the compounds of formula (I) will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The invention also provides a compound of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos c) to e), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, for use as a pharmaceutical.	The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos c) to e), in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably the composition is comprised of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a non-toxic therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos c) to e), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Moreover, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of disease by modulating GPR116, as a regulators of satiety, e.g. resulting in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of obesity, or for the treatment of diabetes, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a non-toxic therapeutically effective amount of compound of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos a) to e), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions may optionally comprise other therapeutic ingredients or adjuvants. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous) administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the particular host, and nature and severity of the conditions for which the active ingredient is being administered. The pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. In practice, the compounds of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos a) to e), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g. oral or parenteral (including intravenous).<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions can be presented as discrete units suitable for oral administration such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further, the compositions can be presented as a powder, as granules, as a solution, as a suspension in an aqueous liquid, as a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water emulsion, or as a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compound of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos a) to e), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices. The compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), including the compounds of provisos a) to e), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds.<br>
The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be, for example, a solid, liquid, or gas. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are sugar syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, and water. Examples of gaseous carriers include carbon dioxide and nitrogen. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any convenient pharmaceutical media may be employed. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like may be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; while carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like may be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules are the<br>
16<br><br>
preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Optionally, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
A tablet containing the composition of this invention may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or adjuvants. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Each tablet preferably contains from about 0.05mg to about 5g of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule preferably containing from about 0.05mg to about 5g of the active ingredient. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5mg to about 5g of active agent, compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about 1mg to about 2g of the active ingredient, typically 25mg, 50mg, 100mg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 500mg, 600mg, 800mg, or 1000mg.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Further, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage; thus, preferably should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, dusting powder, or the like. Further, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared, using a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by admixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5wt% to about 10wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid. It is preferable that the mixture forms unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories may be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in molds. In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including antioxidants) and the like. Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Compositions containing a compound of formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form.<br>
Generally, dosage levels on the order of 0.01mg/kg to about 150mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 7g per patient per day. For example, obesity may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 3.5g per patient per day.<br>
17<br><br>
It is understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>

The biological activity of the compounds of the invention may be tested in the following assay systems:<br>
Yeast Reporter Assay<br>
The yeast cell-based reporter assays have previously been described in the literature (e.g. see Miret J. J. et al, 2002, J. Biol. Chem., 277:6881-6887; Campbell R.M. et al, 1999, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 9:2413-2418; King K. et al, 1990, Science, 250:121-123); WO 99/14344; WO 00/12704; and US 6,100,042). Briefly, yeast cells have been engineered such that the endogenous yeast G-alpha (GPA1) has been deleted and replaced with G-protein chimeras constructed using multiple techniques. Additionally, the endogenous yeast alpha-cell GPCR, Ste3 has been deleted to allow for a homologous expression of a mammalian GPCR of choice. In the yeast, elements of the pheromone signaling transduction pathway, which are conserved in eukaryotic cells (for example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway), drive the expression of Fus1. By placing D-galactosidase (LacZ) under the control of the Fus1 promoter (Fuslp), a system has been developed whereby receptor activation leads to an enzymatic read-out.<br>
8<br>
Yeast cells were transformed by an adaptation of the lithium acetate method described by Agatep et al, (Agatep, R. et al, 1998, Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol (LiAc/ss-DNA/PEG) protocol. Technical Tips Online, Trends Journals, Elsevier). Briefly, yeast cells were grown overnight on yeast tryptone plates (YT). Carrier single-stranded DN A (1 Oug), 2ug of each of two Fus1 p-LacZ reporter plasmids (one with URA selection marker and one with TRP), 2ug of GPR116 (human or mouse receptor) in yeast expression vector (2ug origin of replication) and a lithium acetate/ polyethylene glycol/ TE buffer was pipetted into an Eppendorf tube. The yeast expression plasmid containing the receptor/ no receptor control has a LEU marker. Yeast cells were inoculated into this mixture and the reaction proceeds at 30°C for 60min. The yeast cells were then heat-shocked at 42°C for 15min. The cells were then washed and spread on selection plates. The selection plates are synthetic defined yeast media minus LEU, URA and TRP (SD-LUT). After incubating at 30°C for 2-3 days, colonies that grow on the selection plates were then tested in the LacZ assay.<br>
In order to perform fluorimetric enzyme assays for D-galactosidase, yeast cells carrying the human or mouse GPR116 receptor were grown overnight in liquid SD-LUT medium to an unsaturated concentration (i.e. the cells were still dividing and had not yet reached stationary phase). They were diluted in fresh medium to an optimal assay concentration and 90ul of yeast cells are added to 96-well black polystyrene plates (Costar). Compounds, dissolved in DMSO and diluted in a 10% DMSO solution to 10X concentration, were added to the plates and the plates placed at 30°C for 4h. After 4h, the substrate for the D-galactosidase was added to each well. In these experiments, Fluorescein di (D-D-galactopyranoside) was used (FDG), a substrate for the enzyme that releases fluorescein, allowing a fluorimetric read-out. 20u,l per well of 500u.M FDG/2.5% Triton X100 was added (the detergent was necessary to render the cells permeable). After incubation of the cells with the substrate for 60min, 203-71 per well of 1M sodium carbonate was added to terminate the reaction and enhance the fluorescent signal. The plates were then read in a fluorimeter at 485/535nm.<br>
The compounds of the invention give an increase in fluorescent signal of at least - 1.5-fold that of the background signal (i.e. the signal obtained in the presence of 1% DMSO without compound).<br>
cAMP Assay<br>
A stable cell line expressing recombinant human GPR116 was established and this cell line was used to investigate the effect of compounds of the invention on intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cells monolayers were washed with phosphate buffered saline and stimulated at 37°C for 30min with various concentrations of compound in stimulation buffer plus 1% DMSO. Cells were then lysed and cAMP content determined using the Perkin Elmer AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay) cAMP kit.  Buffers and assay conditions were as described in the<br>

manufacturer's protocol. Compounds of the invention showed a concentration-dependant increase in intracellular cAMP level and generally had an EC3-7of 
In vivo feeding study<br>
The effect of compounds of the invention on body weight and food and water intake was examined in freely-feeding male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on reverse-phase lighting. Test compounds and reference compounds were dosed by appropriate routes of administration (e.g. intraperitoneally or orally) and measurements made over the following 24 h. Rats were individually housed in polypropylene cages with metal grid floors at a temperature of 21±4°C and 55±20% humidity. Polypropylene trays with cage pads were placed beneath each cage to detect any food spillage. Animals were maintained on a reverse phase light-dark cycle (lights off for 8 h from 09.30-17.30 h) during which time the room was illuminated by red light. Animals had free access to a standard powdered rat diet and tap water during a two week acclimatization period. The diet was contained in glass feeding jars with aluminum lids. Each lid had a 3-4C3-7hole in it to allow access to the food. Animals, feeding jars and water bottles were weighed (to the nearest 0.1 g) at the onset of the dark period. The feeding jars and water bottles were subsequently measured 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h after animals were dosed with a compound of the invention and any significant differences between the treatment groups at baseline compared to vehicle-treated controls.<br>
