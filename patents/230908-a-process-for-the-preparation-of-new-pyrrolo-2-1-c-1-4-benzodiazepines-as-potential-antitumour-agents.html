				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines useful as potential antitumour agents. More particularly, it provides a process for the preparation of 8-methoxy-7-{3-[7-methoxy-5-oxo-(llaS)- 2. 3, 4,lla-tetrahydro-lH-pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine-8-yloxyalkyloxy}-(l laR)-2,3,5, 10,11.1 la-hexahydro-lH-pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine-5,ll-dione. with aliphatic chain length<br>
variations for the compounds and their 2-hydroxy, 2-acetyloxy derivatives.<br>
In the last few years, a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs). These antibiotics react covalently with DNA to form an N2-guanine adduct that lies within in the minor groove of duplex DNA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position. (Ref. Kunimoto, S. Masuda, T. Kanbayashi, N. Hamada. M. Naganawa, H. Miyamoto, M. Takeuchi, T. and Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K.W. and Speous, C.L. J. Mol. Bioi, 1970, 57, 551.; Hurley, L.H. Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D.J. and Hurley, L.H. Biochmestry, 1981, 20, 7572.). The molecules have a right-handed twist which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DNA spanning three base pairs. A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units through their C-8 positions to give bisfunctional alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DNA (Ref: Thurston, D. E. Bose, D. S. Thomson, A. S. Howard, P. W. Leoni, A. Croker, S. J. Jenkins, T. C. Neidle, S. and Hurley, L. H. J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 8141-8147).<br>
Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines belong to a group of antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species. Recently, there is much impetus for the PBD systems as they can recognise and bind to specific sequence of DNA. Examples<br><br>
of   naturally   occurring   PBD's   include   anthramycin,   tomaymycin.   sibiromycin   and neothramycin.<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the last decade a number of PBD's have been designed and synthesized to explore them as DNA-sequence selective agents particularly C-8 linked PBD dimers. (Ref: Bose, D. S. Thomson, A. S. Ching, J. A. Hartley, J. A. Berardini, M. D. Jenkins, T. C. Neidle, S. Hurley, L. H. Thurston, D. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 4939). The main object of present invention is to provide a new class of C-8 linked PBD dimers. wherein one PBD has an imine functionality while the other has an amide group. It has been envisaged that such a mixed dimer could offer more insight not only for the covalent binding but also the role played by non-covalent interactions with DNA-bases.<br>
Pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine-5,ll-diones are a class of compounds that bind to DNA by non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobic, Vander walls interactions and hydrogen bonding between ring substituents and DNA, are also responsible for the influence on the sequence selectivity. Further, some dilactams such as (7-methoxy-2-methylcarbonyloxy-5,1 l-dioxo-(2S)-2,3,5,10,l 1,1 la-hexahydro-lH-pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]-<br><br>
benzodiazepine-5,ll-dione-8-yl acetate has been reported to possess significant in vivo antitumour activity in the P388 rat model. (Ref: Kaneko, T. Wong, H. Doyle. T. W. Rose, W. C. Bradner. W. T. J. Med. Chem. 1985, 25, 388).<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines of formula VI useful as antitumour agents. A<br>

Interestingly, the data presented in Table 1 shows that as the size of the linker spacer<br>
increases from 3 to 5 the DNA stabilization is also enhances. In this assay for a 1 :5 molar ratio of (PBD):DNA), one of this mixed imine-amide PBD dimer VI, where n is 5, elevates the helix melting temperature of CT DNA remarkably to 17.0°C after incubation for 18h at 37°C. In similar conditions, the dimer having two imino functionalities i.e., DSB-120 provides a ΔTm of 15.4°C. On the other hand, the naturally occurring DC-81 having only one imino group exhibits a ΔTm of 0.7°C. This demonstrates that the compound VI, where n is 5 containing a single imino functionality shows a very significant DNA binding affinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first synthetic non-cross-linking molecule which has exhibited a remarkable DNA binding effect that is similar to the naturally occurring sibiromycin (ΔTm= 16.3°C at 18h). This data indicates<br><br>
that non-covalent interactions play an important role for the enhancement of DNA binding affinity. The preliminary anti-cancer assay carried out in the three human cell lines: lung (NCI-H460), breast (MCF7) and CNS (SF-268) exhibit significant anticancer activity for these compounds as illustrated in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
