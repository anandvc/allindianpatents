				<td>FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hydrocracking catalyst and a process for the preparation thereof, more particularly, to a catalyst for treating petroleum hydrocarbon materials to produce middle distillates and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently, since the refineries in the world have to face the problems that feedstocks become heavier and heavier and qualities of them worse and worse, the hydrocracking process has yet become an important means for lightening heavy oils. The hydrocracking catalyst is a dual-function catalyst possessing the properties of both hydrogenation and cracking. In general, a hydrocracking catalyst containing non-noble metals comprises Groups VIB and VIII metal components as the hydrogenation components, and a crystalline zeolite and/or amorphous silica-alumina as acidic components. Although an amorphous hydrocracking catalyst containing solely amorphous silica-alumina as an acidic component has a relatively high selectivity, its activity is low and operational flexibility limited. However, the application of zeolites in the preparation of hydrocracking catalyst has brought about a qualitative advancement of the hydrocracking technique, contributing to overcoming the defects of low activity and short running cycle in the hydrocracking catalysts containing amorphous silica-alumina as an active component and reducing significantly the reaction temperature of the catalyst. In particular, in order to increase the operational flexibility of the catalyst to meet the requirement for treating the steadily worse-quality feedstocks from the market, the mid-distillate type hydrocracking catalysts commonly used at present in the industry comprise amorphous silica-alumina in combination with zeolite component so as to fulfil the dual requirements of the catalyst for activity and mid-distillate selectivity.<br><br>
With respect to the mid-distillate type hydrocracking catalyst, in addition to the activity of the catalyst, the mid-distillate selectivity should be especially taken into consideration. The stronger acid sites of zeolite in relation to the acidic silica-alumina can enhance the cracking activity of the catalyst, but its strong cracking activity may result in noticeable decrease in the mid-distillate selectivity. Therefore, it needs to seek a better balance between the activity and the mid-distillate selectivity of the catalyst. In order to solve the contradiction between the reaction activity and the mid-distillate selectivity and according to the requirements for balanced matching of the acidic cracking function and the hydrogenation function of the mid-distillate type hydrocracking catalyst, it needs to develop new-type zeolites and amorphous silica-alumina materials and, through adjusting the ratio of the amorphous silica-alumina to zeolite component in the carrier, to achieve the final object of attaining an optimal level of both the desirable activity and selectivity in the course of reaction.<br>
US Patent No. 4,894,142 discloses a hydrocracking catalyst having an improved mid-distillate selectivity, comprising an amorphous silica-alumina and a low acidity zeolite-Y, wherein said zeolite-Y is characterized in that it has a TPD acidity of less than 2.0mmol/g, preferably 1.5mmol/g. In order to reduce the acidity, the main features of the process for the preparation of said zeolite lie in that the starting material zeolite is treated at a high temperature, including hydrothermally treated at 676~788°C, or dry-treated preferably at 704°C by introducing an inert gas. Since the zeolite has exceedingly low acidity, when a catalyst comprising said zeolite as component is used for treating the feedstock oils, the reaction temperature is over 410°C at the conversion of 85%. Such a high temperature inhibits the hydrogenation reaction while the thermal cracking performance of the zeolite increases, with the result that the mid-distillate selectivity of the catalyst is not obviously improved; specifically, the mid-distillate selectivity is less than 70%, indicating that a better balance has not been obtained for solving the contradiction between the activity and the mid-distillate selectivity as mentioned above.<br><br>
us Patent No. 4,517,074 discloses a hydrocracking catalyst for producing 300-700°F (149-371°C) middle distillates, wherein the feedstocks are preferably pretreated by hydro-denitrogenation and/or hydro-desulfurization. Said catalyst is characterized in that it comprises, in addition to a zeolite component, a dispersion system of SiO2-Al2O3 in a gamma alumina matrix containing 20-65% SiO2, in which, although the amorphous silica-alumina has a certain level of cracking activity, it has to be dispersed into an alumina matrix, such as large-pore Y -AI2O3 used as a component of the carrier, so as to obtain sufficient pore volume and specific surface area for supporting a large amount of metal components for hydrogenation. Although the catalyst has a relatively high mid-distillate selectivity of more than 80%, its activity is relatively low, thus, in order to achieve a conversion of 60vol%, the reaction temperature must generally be higher than 400°C. An example of the patent showed that by the use of a catalyst comprising silica-alumina of as high as 75% silica content dispersed in Y-AI2O3 in combination with a zeolite, such as zeolite LZ-10, the reaction temperature still need to be at 389°C.<br>
Therefore, there is still a need in the art to develop a hydrocracking catalyst having both good activity and high mid-distillate selectivity, and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
After extensive studies and experiments, the inventors have discovered a hydrocracking catalyst comprising hydrogenation metal components, a modified zeolite-Y and a specific amorphous silica-alumina, which exhibits the desired properties, and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
THE OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a hydrocracking catalyst, comprising hydrogenation metal components, a modified zeolite-Y and a specific amorphous silica-alumina, which has both good activity and high mid-distillate selectivity and is useful in treating heavy hydrocarbon materials to produce middle distillates.<br><br>

The amorphous silica-alumina according to the invention can be prepared by the following steps:<br>
(a)	adding an acidic aluminum salt solution and a basic precipitant simultaneously to a reaction vessel containing a smali amount of deionized water and carrying out the neutralization reaction at a pH value of 6.0-10.0 and a temperature of 50-80° C for 0.5-2 hours to form a sol;<br>
(b)	stabilizing the resulting sol from step (a) at pH 6-9 for 0-60 minutes;<br>
(c)	adding a silicon compound within 5-10 minutes to the resulting sol from step<br>
(b);<br>
(d)	aging the mixture from step (c) at pH 7.5-9.5 and a temperature of 50-70°C for 10-60 minutes;<br>
(e)	filtering and washing the resultant from step (d); and<br>
(f)	dr/ing the material from step (e) at 90-120°C and crushing it to obtain the final product amorphous silica-alumina.<br>
The acidic aluminum salt used in step (a) is one or more salts selected from the group consisting of aluminum sulfate, aluminum chloride and aluminum nitrate, and the basic precipitant is one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of sodium alumlnate, aqueous ammonia and sodium hydroxide.<br>
The silicon compound used in step (c) can be waterglass or a silica sol or other silicon compounds of industrial grade.<br>
The amorphous silica-alumina containing phosphorus can be obtained by slurrying the resultant from step (e), adding a proper amount of phosphorus compound such as phosphoric acid or other compounds containing phosphorus so that the product contains l-5w% P2O5 based on the total weight of the amorphous silicaalumina product, then filtering, drying and crashing to give the product containing phosphorus.<br>
The hydrocracking catalyst according to the prwent Invention Is characterized In that it comprises a modified zeolite-Y and a specific amorphous silica-alumina. The modified zeoiite-Y used in the catalyst according to the invention has an increased molar ratio of SiOi/AlzOa and a further decreased amount of solid acid. After deeply dealuminized, said modified zeolite-Y has a decreased number of acid sites, and a decreased IR acidity of 0.2-0.6 mmol/g, preferably 0.3-0.5 mmol/g. Compared with the zeollte-Y prepared by the prior art, the zeolite used in the catalyst according to the present Invention has a larger specific surface area, and an added number of weak and moderate acid sites being formed with most of them being weak, and moderate acid sites desorbed at a temperature ranging from 160 to 450C and the strong<br><br>
acid sites desorbed at &gt;450°C being less than 25% (that is, after modified, the acid sites of the zcolite-Y have been decreased very much, but tiie strong acid sites have not been vanished compietety) , thus ensuring that no over cracldng wiil occur, while a certain amount of strong add sites can also ensure adequate cracldng activity of the catalyst. The properties of pores, including the larger specific surface area and more secondary pores, shown in the modified zeolite used In the catalyst according to the invention enhance efficiently the hydrogenatlon activity which Is advantageous to the Increase in the activity of the ring-opening reaction of multi-ring aromatlcs or heterocyclics containing nitrogen, and provide more efficient reaction space to meet the requirements of the mid-distillate type hydrocracking catalyst for moderate cracking activity and high hydrogenatlon activity for cracking heavy hydrocarbon materials.<br>
The amorphous silica-alumina of the prior art has relatively small specific surface area and pore volume with the specific surface area being not more than 300mV0/ so when used as the carrier of the catalyst, It needs generally to be used in combination with Y -AI2O3 to support a large amount of metal components. The preparation process of the amorphous silicaaiumina used in the catalyst according to the present invention is characterized In that the formation of undesirable pore structure under the tendency of crystallization is avoided, thus ensuring the effective interaction of silicon and aluminum atoms to provide acid sites as well as a large specific surface area and large pore volume. The amorphous silica-alumina can have a pore volume of 0.8-1.5ml/g, and can still have a large specific surface area and large pore volume even in a very wide range of high SIO2 content. For example, when the SIO2 content Is 45% , the specific surface area can stiil be within the range of this invention. A large specific surface area makes the amorphous silica-alumina capable of supporting a large amount of metal components for hydrogenation, while the ackl sites can provide it with the cracking activity. The large pore volume is beneficial for easy movement of the reactants and products in and out of the cavities of the catalyst, and thus minimizing the opportunity of secondary<br><br>
cracking reaction, while less carbon deposition wilt prolong the service life of the catalyst.<br>
The ultra-hydrophobic zeolite-Y mentioned above Is used as a main acidic component of the hydrocracWng catalyst of the Invention. The addle property of the zeolite will provide the catalyst with relatively moderate cracking activity; the large specific surface area and secondary pore structure will improve the dispersion of hydrogenation metals to give full play to the hydrogenation activity, and improve the pore distribution in the catalyst, thus being of benefit to cracking oil distillates. In addition, the amorphous silica-alumina according to the invention is used as a supplement acidic component and a main carrier component of the catalyst, so It has a dual-function, for supplementing the acidic cracking function and serving as a main carrier component for supporting the hydrogenation metals. Said amorphous slllca-aiumina has appropriate acidity and acid strength ard can provide relatively moderate cracking activity when matched with the zeolite.<br>
Therefore, compared with the mid-distillate type hydrocracking catalyst prepared by the prior art, the mid-distillate type hydrocracking catalyst according to the present invention has the features of higher activity and obviously higher mid distillate selectivity. Compared with the reference catalysts, the catalyst of the present Invention exhibits better activity and mid-dlstlllate selectivity In treating the same vacuum gas oils (VGO) under the same conditions.<br>
The preparation process of the catalyst according to the present invention is simple and convenient, easy to operate and suitable for industrial production. The catalyst according to the present invention is designed for use in hydrocracldng process to produce middle distillates. In particular, the catalyst according to the invention is suitable for treating<br><br>
heavy hydrocarbon materials having a distillation range of 250-600®C, generally 300-550C, for example, gas oils, vacuum gas oil distillates, deasphaited oils, cycle oils of FCC, shale oil, coal tars and the tike. The hydrocracking reaction according to the invention is generally carried out at a temperature of S"W) -420°C in the presence of hydrogen under a pressure of 5-30MPa, with the H/oil ratio being 100-5000 and the space velocity being O.l-5.0h-l. When the catalyst of the Invention (s used for treating conventional VGO, the hydrocracking reaction Is generally carried out at a temperature of 370-410**C in the presence of hydrogen under a pressure of preferably 10-20MPa with the H/oil ratio being 500-2000 and the space velocity being 0.5-1.5h-^<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is further illustrated in detail with reference to the following examples which are provided for purposes of illustration and shall not be construed as limiting the present invention.<br>
