				<td>The invention disclosed is an oral pharmaceutical composition for extended release of active ingredient  at least one p-lactam antibiotic specifically intended for the release of drugs possessing a site-specific absorption upon administration, useful for maintaining the desired therapeutic concentration of active ingredient in blood for an extended time periods thus meeting the requirements for effective management of certain infectious diseases minimizing the dosing frequency and patient intervention. The invention also includes a process for preparation of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is a polymeric matrix containing at least one p-lactam antibiotic along with other excipients and additives, either in the form of a tablet or a capsule or a dry syrup for reconstitution at the time of administration.<br>
The discovery of pencillins in the year 1929, by Alexander Flemming, has brought many changes in the concepts and the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and other microorganisms. Today a large number of antibiotic compounds have been developed for the treatment of infections caused by different microorganisms. Among the various types, P-lactams occupy a recognizable place. These P-lactams are active against wide variety of infections, with ideal therapeutic index, but suffers from very short biological half-life, requiring frequent administration to elicit desired therapeutic response. Further their site-specific gastrointestinal absorption may limit the therapeutic applications. Furthermore, it is well established that the contact of various p-lactams causes damage to the intestinal flora (Ref.: (a) Nord and Edlund., J. Chemother. 2,218,1990. (b) Pien FD., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemother.;24,856,1983. (c) Fleisher et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemother., 24,679,1983.). The poor bioavailability and adverse effects can be over come by using prodrug of the respective compounds. However prodrug approach also not yielded complete bioavailability.<br>
A recent study (Drusano and Craig, J. Chemother., 9,38,1998) revealed that the antibiotic activity of p-lactams is solely dependent on the time of exposure to microorganisms, above its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) rather than the peak plasma/serum concentration.<br><br>
This may be obtained by continuous infusion, which may requires hospitalization and continuous monitoring.<br>
Hence the selection of suitable alternate mode of drug administration is of primary goal since the efficacy of the drug greatly depends on the time duration above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The selection should be based upon the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters.<br>
In case of antibiotics the relationship between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters depends on three elements: the pathogen, the host and specific antimicrobial agent. The Post-antibiotic effect of the drug is another pharmacodynamic parameter that has to be considered in determining the optimal dosage regimen.<br>
Based on the above an oral extended release preparation for P-lactam antibiotics that would maintain low but effective concentrations for a prolonged period would be the suitable mode of administration for prolonged therapy.<br>
Arancibia et al. [Int.J.Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. Toxicol., 25, 97, (1987)] studied the bioavailability of amoxicillin after oral administration of controlled-release tablets, and observed that in any case, no drug was detectable after 8 hours and therefore concluded this formulation had no advantage over conventional formulation.<br>
Uchida et. al. [Chem. Pharm. Bull., 37, 3416, (1989)] described a method for the preparation of amoxicillin microcapsules using ethyl cellulose. These microcapsules exhibited a controlled release pattern when administered to beagle dogs. However, such effect could be foreseen, since the gastric pH of the dogs which were tested is considerably higher than human gastric pH (pH of about 6 in beagle dogs, compared to pH of about 2 in humans). The preliminary studies on amoxicillin reveals that it is much less soluble at pH 6 than at pH 2 [Tsuji et.al., J. Pharm. Sci., 67, 1059 (1978)] One would expect to obtain a very quick release of the drug from the same microcapsules if administered to humans. Hence these may not be considered to relate with the human studies.<br>
Martin et al. (US Patent No. 5,851,550) studied the influence of co-administration of clavunic acid with amoxicillin and found that the bioavailability and subsequently therapeutic response<br><br>
was improved compared to conventional dosage form upon oral administration. However, the manufacture of products containing clavunic acid required controlled environmental conditions which may increase  the manufacturing costs.<br>
Hilton and Deasy [Int. J. Pharm., 86, 79, (1992)] described a floating tablet of amoxicillin trihydrate. This tablet remained buoyant for 6 hours and had satisfactory in vitro sustained release but lack of bioavailability compared to that of conventional capsule at a dose of 500mg.<br>
Hilton and Deasy [J. Pharm. Sci., 82, 737, (1993)] also described about controlled release tablet of amoxicillin containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate as a matrix carrier. This polymer retarded the release of amoxicillin in gastric pH but could not enhance its release in the duodenum, proximal parts of Jejumum of small intestine where maximum absorption is likely to take place. Further, single dose in vivo studies in fasting subjects showed that the tablets had a relative bioavailability of only 64.4%, probably because the poorer absorption of drug from the distal jejunum and ileum than from the duodenum and proximal jejunum.<br>
Katzhendler (PCT application No. W098/122091) disclosed a pharmaceutical composition for the controlled release of (3-lactam antibiotics employing various types of cellulose and acrylic polymer derivatives. According to this invention, an initial release of 50.0 % drug in 3-4 hours after administration of dosage form and the drug release continued up to 8 hours. Further the author stated that the free drug is not in contact with the intestinal flora as it is embedded in a matrix and hence the drug is not degraded before it is being absorbed. These statements are contradicting with each other. As there is no carrier mediated mechanism for the absorption of P-lactams beyond the distal part of jejunum, the drug may not be absorbed completely, which may lead to reduced bioavailability and damage of gastrointestinal flora due to continuous presence of free drug in intestinal tract.<br>
In view of the above we aimed to develop an extended-release preparations of different drugs belonging to p-lactam antibiotics group such as pencillins and cephalosporins to optimize therapeutic response of these drugs. A promising approach for achieving this would be optimization of the drug release such that total dose from the dosage form is released within the time of transit through absorption window. The advantages of such preparations are<br><br>
(a) improving patient compliance by minimizing the frequency of drug administration to once or twice a day, and (b) avoiding the damage to the gastrointestinal flora.<br>
The present invention is based on our finding that invitro dissolution profile of an antibiotic from an extended release composition containing an antibiotic or its prodrugs, coated with release modulating polymer which maintains the integrity of the dosage form in varying pH conditions of gastrointestinal tract, compressed into tablets or filled into gelatin capsules or as a dry syrup for reconstitution, when administered orally to humans for the treatment of infectious diseases provides a therapeutic concentration over an extended period of time with better patient compliance. This provides preprogrammed, unattended delivery of drug at a rate and for a time period meeting to therapeutic need. Such drug delivery system minimizes patients intervention and maximizes compliance with the prescribed dose regimen.<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition in the form of an extended release drug delivery system comprising an active ingredient such as p-lactam antibiotic agent having a specific absorption site in gastrointestinal tract in combination with a polymeric material forming a matrix along with other pharmaceutically acceptable additives, wherein at least 25% of active antibiotic agent is released from said matrix within 0.5 to 1.0 hour after administration and a substantial amount of remaining active ingredient over an extended period, but within 2 to 5 hours after administration. This facilitates the complete absorption of the active ingredient before it crosses the "absorption window" where an active carrier mediated transport takes place across the g.i.t. membrane. The concept of present invention can be effectively applied to any pharmaceutical agent which has an "absorption window".<br>
The drug granules may consist of at least one P-lactam antibiotic along with other pharmaceutically acceptable additives, a release modulating polymer with plasticizer and anti-adherent. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be in the form of (a) tablet containing drug granules, diluents or fillers, lubricants (b) capsule containing drug granules, fillers, lubricants or (c) dry syrup containing granules admixed with additives such as sweetners, flavours etc, suitable for oral administration upon reconstitution.<br><br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel extended release pharmaceutical composition containing antibacterial substance particularly from p-lactam antibiotics which are useful for the treatment of infectious diseases.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel extended release pharmaceutical composition containing an antibiotic which is effective for a longer period of time when compared to the conventional immediate release pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition which is therapeutically effective over an extended period of at least 10-14 hours, providing initial dose of active substance for absorption immediately i.e. within 0.5 to 1.0 hour and to release substantial amount of the remaining active substance at a rate sufficient to maintain the drug concentration in therapeutically effective range for a desired period of time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel oral extended release pharmaceutical composition containing an antibiotic, useful for the treatment of infectious diseases comprising the drug in the form of a tablet or capsule or dry syrup for reconstitution made from the granules of drug coated with release modulating polymer composition. The formulation also contain necessary pharmaceutical additives.<br>
