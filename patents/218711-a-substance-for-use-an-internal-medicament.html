				<td>METHOD OF PROVIDING COSMETIC/MEDICAL THERAPY<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to providing cosmetic/medical therapy and more particularly to a<br>
method of preparing and using an electrically activated substance obtaining advantageous qualities for use in such<br>
therapy.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The use of transcutaneous electrotherapy to treat medicinal conditions is known. Transcutaneous<br>
electrotherapy involves the passage of an electrical current from one electrode to another, such that the therapeutic<br>
current is caused to pass through a target tissue of the patient. Some exemplary devices used in the performance of<br>
transcutaneous electrotherapy are provided in United States Patent Nos. 397,474; 3,794,022; 4,180,079; 4,446,870;<br>
5,058,605; in French Patent 2621-827-A; and European Patent Application EP-377-057-A.<br>
Although the use of transcutaneous electrotherapy has been around for a while, in many ways there are<br>
undesirable aspects. For example, transcutaneous electrotherapy causes electrical current to pass through the target<br>
tissue of the patient. Many patients may find this unsettling, painful or otherwise undesirable. Additionally, too much<br>
current, usually over about 1 milli-amp, can also become uncomfortable, painful, and harmful to the patient. Current<br>
also tends to concentrate near the electrodes or along current paths, which is often not desirable when trying to<br>
control the current density in tissue. In addition, the highly variable impedance nature of tissue makes it difficult to try<br>
to determine and repeat the proper treatment duration and settings.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide an effective alternative to transcutaneous electrotherapy<br>
techniques wherein electric current is not required to flow through the tissue of the patient, which is also easier and<br>
simple to apply, can more evenly distribute its benefits, provide more accurate results, and is more effective.<br>
Other existing medical procedures, including such procedures as surgical cut and lift, laser resurfacing, and<br>
chemical peels damage the outer layers of skin, which must then be renewed. This takes time, and there is risk of<br>
burning and scaring. Angioplasty for treatment of coronary circulation impairments is expensive, localized, and<br>
requires surgical techniques. Also, this procedure is expensive, requires skilled professional administration, and carries<br>
a certain degree of risk, as well as inconvenience, and generally requires a healing period.<br>
Various existing inhalants are available for relief of symptoms of pulmonary conditions, but they often do not<br>
correct them, as so consequently require continual usage.<br>
Other existing medical drug therapy techniques have limitations which may be undesirable. Drugs work by<br>
altering, interfering with, supplementing or reacting in chemical means in the body. As such, they may exhibit potent<br>
results, but will generally require a variety of different compounds to provide a useful range of therapies. There may<br>
also be side effects. Thus it is desirable to provide a substance with drug like action, for use in a medicinal way, that<br>
is relatively simple to make, simple in structure, is easy to make and apply, has a wide range of uses, more permanent<br>
results, can provide more effective results than existing medications for many conditions, and does not cause electrical<br>
current to directly flow through the tissue of the recipient, whether a human or an animal. This invention provides<br>
such a means.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for preparing a substance or solution which has unique properties.<br>
Furthermore, the substance or solution is uniquely adapted for simple, effective use. The unique physical properties<br>
are particularly useful when used in the manners described, and exhibit uniquely useful results. More specifically,<br>
molecules of the substance are thought to be forced to take on a random or unformed structure through the use of<br>
disclosed electrical energy. A technique for initiating this randomizing is disclosed. The spin, valence, structure,<br>
magnetic coupling, or bonding of the atoms is likely affected. Also disclosed is a technique for allowing very high<br>
current and energy level concentrations to occur in a solution without instigating electrolysis of the solution. Also<br>
disclosed are process time parameters, and a technique for use of the solution.<br>
The solution herein is generally termed "electrically active".<br>
One advantageous use of the electrically activated substance herein is in the treatment of various diseases<br>
and biological conditions. The electrically activated substance per this disclosure is able to cause or trigger a<br>
molecular or chemical action. The electrically activated substance disclosed tends to exhibit catalyst type properties<br>
when injected in biological tissue. That is to say, it tends to trigger pre-existing response mechanisms in the tissue,<br>
rather than reacting with the tissue in a direct manner in the way a conventional drug would.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the electrically activated substance herein largely<br>
comprises ordinary tap water, or possibly distilled water. Although water has many unusual properties, this invention<br>
is not necessarily limited to using water as a base or component of the solution. Various other compatible substances,<br>
particularly liquids, may potentially be used for an activation solution. This might include various classes of alcohols or<br>
other chemicals.<br>
Additional materials may be included or added to the substance. In particular, placental, amniotic, serum,<br>
and stem cell types of structures may be added, either before, during, or especially after the application of the<br>
electrical signal. However, the addition of these or any biological or living or post-living cells are not an important or<br>
essential requirement for the practice of this invention. Also vitamins, analgesics, and other additives may be used.<br>
In addition, other materials may be used or added to the water or substance without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention. For example, a thickening agent, such as PEG-150 Oistearate or auramidopropyl beatine<br>
may be added to provide thickening into a paste or gel or semi-solid consistency for easier application, especially when<br>
using the substance topically.<br>
One step of electrically activating the substance comprises applying an electrical signal to the substance.<br>
The type of signals used are important to obtaining useful results.<br>
The use of an alternating or at least heavily pulsating direct (DC) current is an important part of the<br>
invention. An alternating current, and more particularly, a high frequency alternating current (HFAC or just AC) has<br>
been found to be a beneficial part in the process of re-structuring or randomizing the molecules or activating the<br>
solution. This is enhanced by the flow of electrons in both directions through the solution.<br>
For example, on the nortion of the waveform, one electrode is positive (+) and one electrode is negative (•),<br>
Current will flow through the solution and, if electrically activating water, hydrogen gas will evolve at one electrode,<br>
with oxygen at the ether. By reversing the polarity of the current flow (using an AC waveform) on a periodic basis, the<br>
current flow will be reversed, and the gasses evolved at each electrode will also reverse. A direct current (DC) signal<br>
current does not initiate the activation process.<br>
In fact a DC component in the signal will cause electrolysis to occur, which is not a desired feature of this<br>
invention. This invention does not rely on conventional electrolysis of the solution to create its activation qualities.<br>
With a DC component in the signal, there would be rapid production of hydrogen and oxygen gas, and the substance<br>
will vaporize away in a matter of minutes, • before sufficient activation occurs. There will also be undesired changes<br>
in the PH level of the solution, which is not necessary when practicing this invention.<br>
When practicing the invention optimally, the PH balance of the medium will not change substantially during<br>
the activation process. This may be observed with a hand-held type digital PH meter. A typical reading is 7.2 at the<br>
start of the activation cycle, and a value of 7.1 • 7.3 at the end. (The electrical energy should be removed when<br>
making a measurement.) Of course, if the PH level should shift, as would occur with a non-symmetrical AC waveform,<br>
the shift does not necessarily mean that the solution can not be used.<br>
The method of generating the electrical signals is known and consists generally of a power source, a signal<br>
generator and a high power amplifier.<br>
Biological currents (electron transport functions) operate at very small currents in mammals, on the order of<br>
nanoamps and less, and so are easily overloaded at currents as small as about 1 milliamp. This limits the amount of<br>
excitation energy that is useable with existing transcutaneous devices. However, if a large amount of power is used<br>
on a bio-compatible material, new beneficiafproperties are obtained.<br>
In order to overcome the power limitation, a medium, functioning as an intermediate transfer solution, - is<br>
employed. Electrical signals are applied to the medium, which is then applied to the patient after removal of current<br>
therethrough. In this way more power may be used than would normally be comfortable or safe for the patient if<br>
current were to flow through the patient.<br>
In order to excite the solution adequately enough to become activated, it is necessary to use a relatively large<br>
amount of power. The minimum power density required is about 10 milliwatts per milliliter. Thus, if a 100 milliliter<br>
(about 4 oz.) batch is prepared, at least 1 watt and preferably 100 watts of power should be used.<br>
If a simple 60 hertz AC line waveform were used, it is not possible to activate the solution. This is because<br>
at the high power levels required, the solution exhibits strong electrolysis action at low frequencies and the solution<br>
vaporizes away before the solution can become sufficiently active.<br>
In order to allow the solution to absorb high power levels and yet prevent premature electrolysis of the<br>
solution, a specific novel technique is employed. This comprises using an electrical signal that preferably comprises an<br>
alternating current signal operating in the frequency range of between approximately 10 KHz and approximately 1<br>
MHz, with between approximately 25 KHz and approximately 100 KHz being optimum. When operating at the<br>
specified frequency, the gassing away of the solution is reduced by about 100 to 1000 times that of a lower<br>
frequency or DC signal. There are also substantially more phase reversals of the current flow per unit of time, and<br>
orders of magnitude more current and power may be used. The electron agitation is also increased over lower<br>
frequencies.<br>
By switching the polarity of the current on a sufficiently quick periodic basis, the atoms may be partially<br>
electrolyzed (separated), yet recombined back together again before any gas escapes. This partial electrolysis, current<br>
phase reversal, then recombining and then re-separating again may be what contribute to the substance becoming<br>
electrically activated. At this frequency, the current reverses direction faster than molecules can be atomized, broken<br>
up, and escape, and little gassing is released. The new properties that the solution takes on at the specified frequency<br>
and power levels then allow it to absorb significantly more energy than at lower frequencies. In fact, the solution can<br>
now absorb enough energy to cause electrical conduction heating of the solution. This is the ideal condition for<br>
creating the activated substance. The temperature rise of the substance during activation will be approximately at<br>
least 3, 4, or 5 degrees and up to approximately 100 degrees Fahrenheit above ambient, depending on the actual<br>
power level used.<br>
The frequency used is critical to the success of the device. The substance will not become properly<br>
electrically activated if the correct frequency is not used. The frequency range called for is the one that allows the<br>
most bio-compatible activation. For example, if a frequency of 60 hertz is used, the substance will electrolyze away in<br>
only a few minutes at the power levels called for in this invention. Additionally, the substance will just not generate<br>
the biological response that frequencies in the range specified will. At frequencies above about 1 MHz, the present<br>
medium will not take on the biological activation qualities, although there may be other mediums which will respond at<br>
that frequency. For example, applying microwave frequency energy to water will not result in biologically active<br>
activation of the substance. Thus the frequencies specified are found to work best<br>
It is thought the current and frequency range of this invention causes the molecules or atoms to become<br>
more fully dissociated and unformed. This means groups of atoms or molecules that normally gather together are<br>
broken apart into the smallest possible units. They may also take on a random spin, where electrons are not shared<br>
between atoms of a molecule in a familiar and stabilized manner. The bonding levels may also be affected. When<br>
partially separated molecules are reformed, the atomic structure may take on slightly different formations in the<br>
presence of the applied power. It is thought this random state reforming is what makes the substance active.<br>
Preferably, the alternating current has approximately minimal direct current bias to prevent PH shift and<br>
gassing. In order to mitigate direct current bias, the electrical signal is preferably applied to the substance via a<br>
capacitor-resistor network. Alternatively, the electrical signal is applied to the substance via an isolation transformer.<br>
The electrical signal preferably has a voltage of between approximately 50 volts rms and approximately 150<br>
volts rms.<br>
The electrical signal is applied to the substance to be electrically activated via at least one pair of electrodes.<br>
A plurality of pairs of electrodes may be utilized, if desired. For optimum results, the electrodes are comprised of an<br>
electrically and biologicaly inert, non-reactive metal or a non-metallic material having a low atomic number and low<br>
resistance. For example, gold, carbon, and graphite-carbon material are suitable. It has been found that lead,<br>
aluminum, copper, and other metals are not recommended for the practice of this invention, as they can cause lead<br>
ions, for example, to leach into the solution, potentially poisoning the patient. Silver provides possible antibiotic,<br>
antiseptic properties to the substance, and may optionally be used or added to the substance when this is desirable.<br>
Additionally, multiple pairs of electrodes may be used with various different phase relationships. In this case,<br>
it may not be necessary for there to be minimal DC bias at all, as if one pair of electrodes has a positive DC bias, and<br>
another pair has a negative OC bias, the net charge bias into the solution may be near zero, thereby effectively<br>
eliminating the undesired electrolysis effect.<br>
When distilled water is to be electrically activated, then a substance must often be added to the water to<br>
introduce impurities therein, so as to facilitate current flow therethrough. According to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, sodium chloride (salt) or minerals are added to form an electrolyte from distilled water.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the additive substance, e.g., sodium<br>
chloride, is added to the distilled water while monitoring current flow therethrough, until the desired current is<br>
obtained. This process makes it easier for the operator, and provides more consistent results.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, approximately 1 amp rms of current is caused<br>
to flow through the substance to be electrically activated. Typically, a voltage of approximately 100 volts rms is<br>
required to effect a current of 1 amp rms. It has been found that currents as low as 1 miiliamp may be used, if<br>
desired. Preferably, at least 10 milliwatts of power per milliliter of substance are utilized. When a large amount of<br>
power is used in the activation process, new beneficial properties are obtained.<br>
Those skilled in the electrical art-will appreciate that the voltage required to effect the desired current is<br>
dependent upon the conductivity of the substance being electrically activated.<br>
Topical application of the electrically activated substance of the present invention has been found to be<br>
effective in mitigating wrinkles on human skin.<br>
Additionally, the substance may be taken orally to obtain additional benefits. When taken orally,<br>
approximately 2 ml of the electrically activated substance is preferably ingested per day for approximately 6 weeks.<br>
Furthermore, the substance has also been found to provide useful qualities for the treatment of internal<br>
conditions if applied correctly.<br>
These, as well as other advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following<br>
description and drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as description<br>
of the presently preferred embodiment of the invention and is not intended to represent the only form in which the<br>
present invention may be constructed. The description sets forth the functions and the sequence of steps for<br>
constructing and operating the invention in connection with the illustrated embodiment It is to be understood,<br>
however, that the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by different embodiments that are<br>
also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
The electrically activated substance and method for making the same of the present invention are illustrated<br>
in Figures 1-13 of the drawings which depict presently preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, a variable frequency current source 10 is electrically connected, via wires 12, to<br>
probes or electrodes 14 which are at least partially immersed within the substance 18 to be electrically activated,<br>
which is contained within a beaker 16. Alternatively, a fixed frequency current source may be used.<br>
The variable frequency current source 10 preferably generates an output with a frequency within the range<br>
of from approximately 10 KHz to approximately 1 MHz, and a voltage output from approximately 50 volts rms to 150<br>
volts rms, and having a maximum current output in excess of 1 amp rms, and provides preferably a generally<br>
symmetrical alternating current waveform.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the variable frequency current source 10<br>
also provides an alternating current output having minimal direct current bias, as illustrated in Figure 5 of the<br>
drawings.<br>
In order to restructure the molecules in the solution within the beater 16. a high frequency alternating<br>
current (AC) signal, preferably having a generally symmetric waveform, is utilized. Thus, for example, referring to<br>
Figure 5, a sinusoidal waveform is suitable, as would be a square AC waveform, a triangular AC waveform, or any odd-<br>
shaped AC waveform with preferably equal energy in each polarity. A square wave generally provides the highest<br>
power and best result. Those skilled in the electrical art will appreciate that various other waveforms, both<br>
symmetrical and non-symmetrical, would likewise provide alternating flow of current. Additionally, various other<br>
combinations of waveforms may likewise be suitable if they provide a beat or resonance or modulation signal within<br>
the 10 Khz to 1 MHz band.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the frequency output of the variable<br>
frequency current source 10 is capable of being swept or automatically varied between a minimum and maximum<br>
frequency. Alternatively, the variable frequency current source 10 is capable of being manually swept in frequency.<br>
The wires 12 preferably comprise copper wires having a current rating sufficient to carry the* required<br>
current, e.g., 1 amp rms, without excessive heating.<br>
Typical dimensions for the electrodes 14 are 3 mm thick, 20 mm wide, and 10 cm long. However, as those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate, various different dimensions and cross-sectional configurations, e.g., round, oval,<br>
square, triangular, etc.. may likewise be suitable.<br>
Preferably, the electrical resistance of the finished electrodes is less than 500 ohms/cm2, preferably less than<br>
50 ohms/cm2.<br>
Further, according to the preferred embodiment qf the present invention, the two electrodes are positioned<br>
several centimeters apart in a 250 ml container, e.g., the beaker 16. The beaker 16 is preferably formed of a non-<br>
conductive material, such as glass or plastic Thus, as described herein, the method for electrically activating the<br>
substance 18 is preferably practiced utilizing approximately 200 ml of the substance at a time. The actual quantity of<br>
substance electrically activated may be varied widely by varying the dimensions of the container, electrodes, and by<br>
varying the strength of the electrical signal appropriately.<br>
in one embodiment, current flow through the substance 18 being electrically activated is monitored as an<br>
electrolytic substance is added thereto so as to form an electrolyte. For example, when water is being electrically<br>
activated, then sodium chloride is added to the water, so as to form an electrolyte. As the sodium chloride is added to<br>
the water, current flow through the water may be monitored until the desired current flow is achieved, thereby<br>
indicating that sufficient sodium chloride has been added to the water.<br>
According to the preferred embedment of the present invention, approximately 1 amp rms of current is<br>
caused to flow through the substance 18 being electrically activated while a voltage of approximately 100 volts rms is<br>
applied thereto. Various other voltage and amperage levels are likewise suitable.<br>
Typically, current is allowed to flow through the substance being electrically activated for approximately 4-8<br>
hours. At this point there will usually be small gas bubbles formed upon the electrodes. At this point, the substance<br>
has been fully electrically activated and is ready to use.<br>
The degree to which the substance 18 is electrically activated, and thus the effectiveness thereof, is directly<br>
related to the voltage applied to the electrodes 14, the spacing of the electrodes, the current caused to flow between<br>
the electrodes, and, to some extent, the length of time that the current is applied. As indicated in Figure 4, current<br>
must flow between the electrodes for a minimum of at least 10 minutes before any usable results are typically<br>
obtained. It is thought that the application of current for a time period in excess of 8 hours produces little additional<br>
effectiveness of the electrically activated substance. The recommended period of time is 4-12 hours.<br>
The electrically activated substance is typically active for only a limited amount of time after current flow<br>
therethrough has ceased. The electrically activated substance is thought to be most effective if utilized within<br>
approximately 4 hours after its production. The electrically activated substance is thought to be somewhat effective<br>
for up to 4 days after its production, and almost totally diminished after 7 days. It is believed that the decay in the<br>
effectiveness of the electrically activated substance is logarithmic in nature, with more than half of the effectiveness<br>
thereof lost within approximately 24 hours. Thus it is important to use the substance promptly to derive the benefits<br>
described herein.<br>
The specified values for the applied voltage, duration, and conductivity of the medium may be varied<br>
somewhat. Indeed, a reduction in the effectiveness of the electrically activated substance may be compensated for by<br>
varying one or the other of the production parameters.<br>
For example, a lower voltage may be utilized if additional sodium chloride is added to the solution. However,<br>
if too much sodium chloride is added, then the solution may become less bio-compatible. Conversely, if less sodium<br>
chloride is utilized, then a higher voltage is necessary to obtain sufficient current flow through the substance.<br>
Inadequate current flow through the substance results in substantially reduced effectiveness of the electrically<br>
activated substance.<br>
It is thought that the electrically activated substance of the present invention, when applied to biological<br>
tissue, initiates a weak electrical (or ionic) signal in the tissue, similar to the alert signal that occurs when a<br>
mechanical strain to the tissue has occurred. This is possibly caused by the spin, valence, or magnetic coupling or<br>
polarizing activity of the activated substance. The activated substance may possibly work by loosening weak<br>
molecular bonds in the tissue, thereby causing a regeneration response as the bonds or tissues recover. The activity of<br>
the substance triggers accelerated metabolic activity in the treatment area. Blood flow accelerates while cellular<br>
metabolic activity and interactions increase. As is best shown in Figures 9 and 10, capillaries and/or blood vessels 50<br>
dilate following the treatment and there is increased cellular activity. Toxins, free radicals, metabolic waste and<br>
remnant material may be re-formed or flushed away.<br>
The electrically activated substance of the present invention need not be applied to fresh injury sites. It may<br>
interfere with the timing and development of the natural current of injury, thereby inhibiting the healing process.<br>
However, once the injury has stabilized, the electrically activated substance of the present invention may be applied<br>
thereto so as to enhance or re-stimulate the healing process.<br>
One use of the electrically activated substance of the present invention is the treatment of skin sagging.<br>
Preferably, the water is activated with a frequency of between approximately 50 KHz and 100 KHz. When injected for<br>
this purpose, there is a uniform reduction of sagging throughout the body.<br>
After each application, the recovery phase typically has a duration of approximately 1 to 7 days. After about<br>
4 days, most of such recovery has occurred. At the end of the recovery phase, another treatment may be applied. It<br>
has been found that the recovery phase must be complete before a subsequent treatment, so as to avoid overwhelming<br>
the response mechanism.<br>
It has been found that approximately three to six such treatment sessions are typically required for maximum<br>
results. One session every one to two weeks. The more degenerated the tissue, the more dramatic the results are.<br>
The substance also exhibits strong anti-viral properties. The general result is renewed appearance, without surgery,<br>
grafting, patchwork, dermabrasion, laser vaporization, or other invasive or mechanical techniques. Additionally,<br>
electric current is never caused to pass through living tissue or cells directly.<br>
In addition to being used to treat wrinkles, the substance may also be advantageously used to treat<br>
pulmonary conditions. This is shown in Figure 6. The electrically activated substance 18 is inhaled as a mist, or<br>
droplet form. This is preferably accomplished with the use of a conventional nebulizer 74 to convert the liquid to a<br>
vaporous material 72.<br>
Such nebulizers are commercially available through various health care providers. Some models use<br>
compressed air or mechanical vibrations to convert a liquid or fluid to a fine mist. One such device is sold under the<br>
trademark "Micro Air" by Omron Industries. This device brakes the liquid into small particles from approximately 1<br>
micron to 10 microns in size. These particles are clumps of molecules. When the substance is converted to a vaporous<br>
mist 72 in this manner, the electrically activated properties of the substance are found to remain. When the<br>
electrically activated substance 72 is inhaled, additional advantages and benefits to the recipient are realized. For<br>
example, when inhaled as a mist, the substance may be used to beneficially treat lung and pulmonary tract problems<br>
and disorders.<br>
That is, pulmonary fibrosis, some types of emphysema, and other conditions may be treated in this manner.<br>
Interstitial fibrosis occurs when lung tissue becomes scarred and loses its flexibility and elasticity. This can happen<br>
after an infection, for example, or contact with an irritant and can make breathing difficult and even painful. There<br>
may also be a loss of capillary and blood-gas (air) exchange function. This condition can be improved when the<br>
vaporous mist 72 is inhaled.<br>
Figure 12a shows a cutaway patch of pulmonary fibrosis tissue 90. The tissue 90 is largely composed of<br>
fibrous strands 91. There are a lack of Mood vessels, and the tissue is stiff. Figure 12b shows the same portion of<br>
tissue 90 after coming into contact with the vaporous mist 72 of Figure 6. The mist 72 helps to soften and diminish<br>
the fibrous tissue 91 and generate new blood vessels 92, thereby helping to restore normal capillary action and lung<br>
function.<br>
Emphysema occurs when air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs burst. This is the result of weakened connective<br>
tissue. It is often initiated by air pollutants. The active-energy properties of the substance of this invention acts to<br>
improve the condition of the connective tissue and dislodge and remove contaminants. In this way further destruction<br>
is minimized and even some function restored.<br>
Arterial plaque is another condition which is desirous to treat. This is a commonly occurring condition. It is<br>
partly influenced by diet. The plaque is largely composed of fats and lipids which have not been metabolized. These<br>
iatty deposits become attached to artery watts and surfaces and can build up over a period of time. These same fatty<br>
deposits may also build up in other tissues throughout the body. If the buildup continues, the plaque can reduce the<br>
size of arterial passageways, thereby inhibiting blood flow and impairing chemical function and activity. The fatty<br>
deposits may also accumulate in the body in general.<br>
This is shown in figure 11a. The cross sectional view of an artery 122 has a build up 121 on the interior<br>
lining 123 which constricts its size, reducing the flow of blood therethrough.<br>
The activated substance of the invention, when prepared as described herein, has been found to possess<br>
unique capabilities resulting in an effective and useful technique of treating such a plaque condition when the<br>
substance is injected into the blood stream. A syringe, catheter, or other such type of device may be used to effect<br>
the internal injection. This is shown in Figure 7. A hypodermic needle 71 is attached to a syringe 73 or a container<br>
containing the electrically activated substance 18. The needle 71 is inserted through the epidermal layers of skin in<br>
order to inject the substance 18. In Figure 8. an I.V. feed may also be used. A hypodermic needle 71 is attached to a<br>
tube 75 and a container 77 containing the electrically activated substance 18. The needle 71 is inserted through the<br>
epidermal layers of skin in order to inject the liquid 18.<br>
. Figure 11b shows the artery 122 of Figure 11a with the activated substance 18 contacting the blood 124<br>
and the plaque 121. Figure 11c shows the same artery 122 with the plaque 121 diminished in size after the<br>
treatment.<br>
Figure 13 shows a hypodermic needle 81 connected to a syringe 82 that carries the activated substance to<br>
be injected through the skin of an animaL<br>
Graduation marks on the syringe 73 or the IV container 77 measure the amount of activated liquid 18 to be<br>
applied in a dose. When injected, the typical dose rate is one to two cc"s per 100 pounds of body weight.<br>
When injected in this way, blood flow and metabolic activity accelerates and increases beginning about 15<br>
minutes after the injection. There will begin a flushing action in the tissue. The heart will beat stronger. There may<br>
be a very slight fever. There is a slight tingling sensation, but no pain. This will last 1-2 days. After this period of<br>
accelerated blood flow, the body enters a recovery phase wherein the cellular structure thereof is rebuilt.<br>
When taken internally as an injection or IV into the blood stream, the molecular action of the electrically<br>
activated substance then becomes useful to-dissolve, solubolize, loosen and remove fatty deposits and plaque buildup<br>
from the artery wails. This increases capilary and general blood flow and action. When the fatty deposits which<br>
commonly occur in the blood vessels and throughout the body and blood flow system are cleaned away and soluboiized<br>
as described herein, the chemical and metabolic efficiency and effectiveness of the body thereafter increases greatly,<br>
causing significant and substantial improvements in the functioning, operation, and regeneration ability of most all<br>
body systems and processes. This will then allow the strengthening of arterial walls and improve the production of<br>
collagen and ligament type support structures. Thus, the method provides a new, useful and effective treatment for<br>
plaque build up conditions and positive additional benefits. The process thus also serves to provide pain relief to the<br>
recipient.<br>
There are minimal other outward signs during treatment, however the skin may become temporarily wrinkled.<br>
The wrinkling is caused by the skin drawing together on the inside of the body, resulting in bunching up on the outside.<br>
This fades away after a while. After the first treatment, and particularly after 3-6 treatments 1 week apart, facial<br>
characteristics are smoothed and sagging features become lifted.<br>
Other typical uses for the substance when injected are for the treatment of internal organs in general, as well<br>
as the blood and circulation system, and other textbook medical/cosmetic conditions, and is applicable to both humans<br>
and animals.<br>
When used as an internal injection or IV. the substance is often best administered several times over a period<br>
of weeks or months. The first few treatments may be at a lower dosage rate to avoid an excessively strong reaction<br>
the first time the product is used.<br>
Although an exemplary technique has been disclosed, there are other acceptable means of injecting the<br>
electrically activated substance into the body. It may also be applied with somewhat effectiveness as a douche or<br>
applied through the use of various tubes and with other devices without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
The substance may also be inhaled or injected along with other materials, nutrients, and drugs, without<br>
departing from the scope of this invention.<br>
Because the electrically activated substance of the present invention functions as a transfer agent or<br>
medium, there is no current flow from the current source through biological tissue. Thus, there is no chance of bums,<br>
thereby enhancing the safety of such treatment Further, there is no muscle contraction or nerve impulse firing as a<br>
result of using the electrically activated substance of the present invention, as is common during contemporary<br>
transcutaneous electrotherapy. Furthermore, there is substantially no removal of tissue, unlike dermabrasion and other<br>
techniques, and no acid/base effects on the body from PH shifts.<br>
Although several uses have been described, there are of course many other medical conditions in both<br>
humans and animals which may respond favorably in this manner. For example, the substance has been found to have<br>
strong anti-viral properties, and may be used by itself or with other drugs, as well as for generally treating pain. The<br>
substance is also useful in treating and repairing conditions associated with damaged and cross-linked protein<br>
structures.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, if the variable frequency current source 10 does not provide approximately<br>
0 direct current bias, then the output thereof can be processed so as to mitigate direct current bias.<br>
With particular reference to Figure 2, a resistor-capacitor network 22 may be used to filter the output of the<br>
variable frequency current source 10, so as to mitigate direct current bias. Such a resistor-capacitor network<br>
comprises at least one capacitor 26 in series with the substance 18 being electrically activated and at least one<br>
resistor 28 in parallel therewith. The resistor-capacitor network 22 functions according to known principles to<br>
mitigate the presence of DC bias in the substance being electrically charged. Those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that various other types of filters may be utilized. For example, a capacitor inductor network may be utilized.<br>
With particular reference to Figure 3, an isolation transformer 24 isolates the substance 18 to be electrically<br>
charged from direct current bias present in the output of the variable frequency current source 10.<br>
In any instance, when the variable frequency current source 10 does not include a means for monitoring<br>
current flow through the substance 18 being electrically activated, then such means is preferably included in the<br>
electrical path of the electrodes 14. For example, an amp meter 20 may be inserted in line or applied inductively to one<br>
of the wires 12 which provide an electrical pathway for the current which travels between the electrodes 14.<br>
Alternatively, an oscilloscope may be utilized to monitor current flow and voltage between the electrodes 14.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, the method for forming the electrically activated substance 18 of the present<br>
invention generally comprises the step 30 of providing distilled water, the step 32 of adding sodium chloride to the<br>
distilled water while monitoring current flow between the electrodes 14, the step 34 of applying alternating current to<br>
the electrodes 14 and the step 36 of administering the electrically activated substance, preferably within four hours<br>
after the electrical activation thereof.<br>
The electrically activated substance is only administered after first discontinuing the application of current<br>
thereto. In this manner, the electric current can be applied to an intermediate material (i.e.. the electrically activated<br>
substance), rather than directly to a person. Thus, a substantial amount of power may be applied to the electrically<br>
activated substance, without undesirable interference with biological processes which would occur if an electrical<br>
signal of strong energy were applied directly to a recipient. Indeed, according to the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, much more power (for example 100 watts), can be applied to the electrically activated substance<br>
than could comfortably be tolerated by human tissues.<br>
The minimum amount of power applied to the substance during electrical activation thereof must be<br>
sufficient to overcome the activation decay rate of the substance. A small activation energy will disperse as quickly<br>
as it is generating, prohibiting adequate activation of the substance. It has been found that the application of at least<br>
approximately 10 milliwatts of electrical power, and preferably 100-400 milliwatts, per milliliter of substance results<br>
in an acceptable decay rate.<br>
Non-distilled or tap water or other bio-compatible compounds, including tissue products, may be utilized<br>
instead of distilled water. It has been feund that tap water is frequently suitable for use in the practice of the present<br>
invention. However, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, the types and amounts of impurities found in tap water<br>
vary considerably from one location to another. Thus, if an accurate analysis of the tap water to be utilized is not<br>
available, then the effectiveness and current flow therethrough may be determined by trial and error.<br>
Various other electrolyte-forming substances, other than sodium chloride, are likewise suitable including but<br>
not limited to potassium, salts and minerals.<br>
The application of alternating current during step 34 to the substance to be electrically activated preferably<br>
takes place for a duration of approximately 4 to 8 hours. After this amount of time, there may be small gas bubbles on<br>
the electrodes.<br>
The electrically activated substance is created using the power levels, frequencies, current densities, and<br>
dosage quantities described herein. When the substance is produced in this manner, it takes on unique properties.<br>
The electrically activated substance is created using the power levels, frequencies, current densities, and<br>
dosage quantities described herein, or parameters comparable to those described herein. When the substance is<br>
produced in this manner, it takes on unique properties (possibly on an atomic level), which make it particularly well<br>
suited for the practice of the present invention.<br>
It is understood that the exemplary methods described herein and shown in the drawings represent only a<br>
presently preferred embodiment of the invention. Indeed, various modifications and additions may be made to such<br>
embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, various different sizes, shapes<br>
and configurations of the container, the electrodes, and the source and type of alternating current are contemplated.<br>
Further, the use of water as the electrically activated substance is by way of example only, not by way of limitation.<br>
Indeed, it is also anticipated that gases, as well as liquids and conductive solids may be electrically activated according<br>
to the techniques of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a new and useful therapy.<br>
These and other modifications may be adapted to the present invention in keeping with the original spirit and<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
