				<td>GLYCODENDRIMERS HAVING BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
The present invention relates to new glycodendrimers having new biological activity,<br>
processes for preparing them and their use in medicine including veterinary medicine.<br>
Dendrimers are a class of polymeric compounds that can be distinguished from<br>
conventional linear polymers by their highly branched, but circular and symmetrical<br>
architecture (Figure la and Figure Ib). They have a molecular structure that can be much<br>
more precisely defined than is possible for linear polymers (Tomalia DA, Naylor AM,<br>
Goddard HI WA. (1990) Starburst dendrimers: molecular level control of size, shape,<br>
surface chemistry, topology and flexibility from atoms to macroscopic matter. Angewandte<br>
Chemie-International Edition in English 29, 138-175). STARBURST ™ polymers (a trade<br>
mark of Dendritech Inc. Midland, Michigan) are dense star polymers. They are a particular<br>
type of dendrimer which is formed by the generational addition of branched layers from a<br>
core. Typically, they are available in generations 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, and 9.5. Generation<br>
is a term which relates to the way the molecules are synthesised and to their molecular<br>
weight. They have from 16 (gen 1.5) up to 4,096 (gen 9.5) terminal carboxylic acid groups.<br>
WO 95/24221 [Dow Chemical Company] discloses dendritic polymer conjugates<br>
'comprising dense star polymers complexed or conjugated with biological response<br>
modifiers.<br>
The reactive end groups of dendrimers are present at the periphery of the molecule and<br>
these groups can be cationic or anionic (Newkome GR, Nayak A, Behera RK, Moorefield<br>
CN, Baker GR &amp; Johnson AL. (1992) Chemistry of micelles series .22. cascade polymers -<br>
synthesis and characterization of 4-directional spherical dendritic macromolecules based on<br>
adamantane. Journal of Organic Chemistry 57, 358-362). End group modification is usually<br>
employed in dendrimers that have been prepared by the divergent approach:- i.e.<br>
poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM dendrimers) and poly(propyleneimine)<br>
dendrimers (DAB dendrimers). Such modification of the functional groups on the outer<br>
surface of the dendrimer can significantly alter the biological properties of these molecules<br>
as a consequence of co-operative effects (Jansen JFGA, de Brabander-van de Berg EMM &amp;<br>
Meijer EW. (1994) Encapsulation of guest molecules into a dendritic box. Science 266,<br>
1226-1229). Compounds able to produce co-operative effects are very important in<br>
modulating biological control mechanisms in the immune system.<br>
Previously it has not proved possible to covalently couple biological molecules to anionic<br>
dendrimers in order to make new compounds with novel and unique biological activity.<br>
The present invention now provides a process to covalently link a molecule, for example, a<br>
biologically active molecule to an anionic dendrimer wherein the dendrimer is reacted with<br>
the biologically active molecule in the presence of a coupling agent, for example, a<br>
carbodiimide coupling agent, for example, l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)<br>
carbodiimide hydrochloride (Figure 2). The reaction is preferably carried out in an aqueous<br>
solvent. The molecule to be linked to the dendrimer, for example, a biologically active<br>
agents, includes drugs, nucleic acids (hi particular DNA), proteins, peptides, carbohydrates<br>
and antibodies of natural or synthetic origin.<br>
The process of the present invention has the advantages of comprising single step, water<br>
based chemistry, which can be performed at room temperature (i.e. typically below 40°C).<br>
The process of the present invention has the further advantage that it avoids the need for<br>
organic solvents that are often toxic in vivo. Furthermore, organic solvents require<br>
additional, complicated and expensive purification of the product from the organic solvent.<br>
Conjugation, that is to say, covalent linkage of the components, in an aqueous environment<br>
facilitates the purification of the final product. This is important from an industrial,<br>
manufacturing perspective for the new drugs. A particular advantage of the process of the<br>
present invention is that conjugation can be carried out at ambient room temperature and<br>
does not require the application of an external energy source.<br>
The process of the present invention is particularly useful for the preparation of anionic<br>
glycodendrimers.<br>
In 1996, Roy defined glycodendrimers as "a new class of low molecular weight<br>
multiantennary carbohydrate containing biopolymers" (Page D &amp; Roy R. (1997) Synthesis<br>
and biological properties of mannosylated Starburst poly(amidoamine) dendrimers.<br>
Bioconjugate Chemistry 8, 714-723). They were synthesised by convergent approaches<br>
with incorporation of various carbohydrate structures at the last step.<br>
Glycodendrimers have been described by the manner in which saccharide residues are<br>
incorporated as complexes or conjugates into them as one of two types (Ashton PR, Boyd<br>
SE, Brown CL, Nepogodiev SA, Meijer EW, Peerlings HWI &amp; Stoddart JF. (1997)<br>
Synthesis of glycodendrimers by modification of poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers.<br>
Chemistry a European Journal 3 (6), 974-98420):<br>
(i) carbohydrate coated dendrimers characterised by the presence of saccharide<br>
residues attached to the end groups of the dendrimer.<br>
(ii) folly carbohydrate dendrimers where the saccharides are used as multifunctional<br>
building blocks giving rise to dendrimers that are totally carbohydrate.<br>
Although it is known that neoglycoconjugates can be prepared by Unking saccharides to<br>
carriers, only those pre-formed dendrimers bearing primary amino groups on thenperiphery<br>
have been investigated as a macromolecular support for the attachment of<br>
carbohydrates (Ashton PR, Boyd SE, Brown CL, Nepogodiev SA, Meijer EW, Peerlings<br>
HWI &amp; Stoddart JF. (1997) Synthesis of glycodendrimers by modification of<br>
poiy(propyleneimine) dendrimers. Chemistry a European Journal 3 (6), 974-984). In these<br>
cases, the primary amine terminated dendrimers can be modified with relative ease with a<br>
variety of reagents. In contrast, it had not been possible to modify the carboxylic acid<br>
groups on the surface of carboxylic terminated, anionic dendrimers in order to give the<br>
dendrimer different functional activity. The biological problem that this has led to is that<br>
aminic terminated dendrimers are considerably more toxic than the carboxylic terminated<br>
dendrimers in vivo (Malik N, Wiwattanapatapee R, Klopsch R, Ixsrenz K, Frey H, Weener<br>
JW, Meijer EW, Paulus W &amp; Duncan R. (2000) Dendrimers: Relationship between<br>
structure and biocompatibility in vitro, and preliminary studies on the biodistribution of<br>
125I-labelled polyamidoamine dendrimers in vivo. Journal of Controlled Release 65, 133-<br>
148). Therefore it was important to develop new glycodendrimers that were based upon<br>
carboxylic terminated dendrimers as the starting material.<br>
hi a further aspect, the present invention now provides new anionic glycodendrimers<br>
comprising covalently linked carboxylic terminated dendrimers. A glycodendrimer of the<br>
present invention comprises a carbohydrate moiety covalently linked to an anionic<br>
dendrimer, in particular a earboxylic terminated dendrimer. The term 'a glycodendrimer' is<br>
used herein to include glycodendrimers that comprise more than one species of<br>
carbohydrate moiety covalently linked to one species of carboxylic terminated dendrimer,<br>
glycodendrimers that comprise one species of carbohydrate covalently linked to a mixture<br>
of species of carboxylic terminated dendrimer dendrimers, and glycodendrimers that<br>
comprise more than one species of carbohydrate moiety covalently linked to a mixture of<br>
species of carboxylic terminated dendrimers.<br>
A carboxylic terminated dendrimer is, for example, a carboxylic terminated dendrimer from<br>
any of generations 1.5 to 9.5, for example, generation (gen) 2.5 or gen 3.5. A mixture of<br>
species of carboxylic terminated dendrimer is, for example, a mixture of carboxylic<br>
terminated dendrimers of different generations, for example, from gen (generation ) 1.5 to<br>
gen 9.5. For example, a gen 2.5 or gen 3.5 dendrimer may be used alone or in combination<br>
with any one or more other generation denrimers.<br>
The carboxylic terminated dendrimer may be, for example, a carboxy terminated<br>
poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer. For example, one or more PAMAM dendrimers<br>
from gen 1.5 to gen 9.5 may be used, for example, a mixture generations of PAMAM<br>
dendrimers from generation 1.5 to generation 9.5 may be used. For example, a dendrimer<br>
may be or may comprises a PAMAM dendrimer gen 2.5 or 3.5.<br>
Preferably the dendrimers are PAMAM dendrimers; particularly preferred PAMAM<br>
dendrimers are generation 3.5, which have up to 64 terminal carboxylic acid groups.<br>
A carbohydrate moiety is covalently linked to the carboxylic terminated dendrimer. The<br>
carbohydrate group may be, for example, a monosaccharide, disaccharide, trisaccharide,<br>
oligosaccharide or polysaccharide, or a combination of one or more thereof. The<br>
carbohydrate group generally comprises one or more amine groups.<br>
The carbohydrate moiety is preferably an amino sugar or a sulphated amino sugar, which<br>
amino sugar or sulphated amino sugar may be modified, for example, acylated, for<br>
example, N-acylated. The carbohydrate group may be derived, for example, from glucose,<br>
mannose or galactose. The carbohydrate group is, for example, glucosamine, a<br>
glucosamine sulphate, N-acetyl glueosamine or an N-aeetyl glucosamine sulphate group. A<br>
glucosamine sulphate may have one ore more sulphate groups, for example, at any one or<br>
more of positions 3, 4 and 6. A glucosamine suplate is, for example, glucosamine 6-<br>
sulphate, glucosamine 3,6-disulphate or glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulphate. A glusosamine<br>
sulphate may be acetylated, for example, N-acetylated. An N-acetyl giucosamine sulphate<br>
is, for example, N-acetyl glucosamine 6-sulphate, N-acetyl glucosamine 3,6-disulphate or<br>
N-acetyl glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulphate.<br>
Mannosamine and galactosamine and derivatives thereof, for example, sulphated and/or<br>
acylated derivatives corresponding to the above glucosamine derivatives, for example,<br>
glucosamine sulphates and N-acylated glucosamine and N-acylated glucosamine sulphates<br>
may be used.<br>
A glycodendrimer of the present invention is, for example, dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine<br>
or dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulphate or dendrimer gen. 3.5-N-acetylglucosamine<br>
or dendrimer gen. 3.5-N-acetylglucosamine sulphate or dendrimer gen. 3.5-mannosamine<br>
or dendrimer gen. 3.5-mannosamine sulphate or dendrimer gen. 3.5-N-acetylmannosamine<br>
or dendrimer gen. 3.5-N-acetylmannosamine sulphate or any combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, the dendrimers are covalently linked to compounds containing aminic groups,<br>
for example, amine groups, for example, primary amine groups, such as aminic sugars and<br>
sulphated sugars. Preferred sugars are glucosamine or suphated glucosamine.<br>
The one-step reaction of the present invention may be used for the covalent conjugation of<br>
PAMAM anionic dendrimers gen 2.5 to sugars containing aminic groups and to sulfated<br>
sugars containing aminic groups.<br>
Linear molecules, that is molecules without a ring structure, can also be attached to the<br>
anionic PAMAM dendrimers using the same chemistry. This has been successfully<br>
achieved for 3-amino-l-propanesuifonic acid for example.<br>
Typically the covalent linker bond is stable over a period of at least 90 days.<br>
Subsequent purification of the products has also been made simple and straightforward.<br>
Until now, it has only been possible to covalently link molecules to cationic PAMAM<br>
dendrimers using multistep organic chemistry followed by a large number of purification<br>
steps.<br>
Carboxylic acid terminated anionic PAMAM dendrimers have a remarkable lack of toxicity<br>
both in vitro and in vivo compared to cationic PAMAM dendrimers (Tsutsumiuchi K, Aoi<br>
K, &amp; Okada M. (1999) Globular carbohydrate macromolecule "Sugar Balls" IV. Synthesis<br>
of dendritic nanocapsules with molecular recognition sites on periphery. Polymer Journal<br>
31, 935-941). Cationic dendrimers cause red cell haemolysis at a concentration of 10 fig/ml<br>
whilst anionic dendrimers have no such effect even at 2,000 p,g/ml. Anionic dendrimers<br>
have a longer circulation time in the systemic vascular circulation than cationic dendrimers,<br>
and this is associated with a lower degree of accumulation of the molecule in the liver. This<br>
inherent toxicity of higher generation cationic dendrimers means that they are unlikely to be<br>
suitable or safe for either high dose intravenous administration or for repeated intravenous<br>
administration (Malik N, Wiwattanapatapee R, Klopsch R, Lorenz K, Frey H, Weener JW,<br>
Meijer EW, Paulus W &amp; Duncan R. (2000) Dendrimers: Relationship between structure<br>
and biocompatibility in vitro, and preliminary studies on the biodistribution of 125I-labelled<br>
polyarnidoamine dendrimers in vivo. Journal of Controlled Release 65, 133-148).<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention the attachment of molecules, for example,<br>
non-biologically active molecules, to anionic PAMAM dendrimers allows the effective<br>
manipulation of chemokmes and, in turn cytokines, as well as new blood vessel formation<br>
even though dendrimers, and molecules such as glucosamine and glucosamine 6-sulphate,<br>
have no proven intrinsic anti-inflammatory or antiangiogenic activity.<br>
Glucosamine is a sugar moiety that can be conjugated to the dendrimer core via the ability<br>
of the amine group to react with the carboxylate groups present on the surface of anionic<br>
dendrimers. This leads to the formation of a stable amide bond. Glucosamine containing<br>
various combinations of sulfate moieties at the 3', 4' and 6' positions of the glucan moiety<br>
were also suitable for attachment using the same chemistry. This resulted in the formation<br>
of a new anti-angiogenic glycodendrimer with immunomodulatory properties and<br>
antiangiogenic properties.<br>
The number of molecules of sugar or sulfated sugar covalently bound to the surface of the<br>
dendrimer increases in proportion to the number of carboxylic groups that are present on<br>
the surface of the dendrimer. The amount of glucosamine linked to the dendrimers,<br>
expressed as a percentage of converted carboxylic groups may range, for example, from 1.5<br><br>
to 10.1 %. la the case of the sulfated dendrimers, the sulphur content increased in the<br>
following order: monosulfated sugar (2.79 % m:m S); disulfated sugar (5.78 % m:m S);<br>
trisulfated sugar (7.93 % m:m S). The amount of sulfate present in the conjugate was 6 %<br>
for glucosamine 6-sulfate, 11 % for glucosamine 3,6-disulfate, and 15 % for glucosamine<br>
3,4,6-trisulfate.<br>
The present invention also provides a glycodendrimer of the present invention for use as a<br>
medicament, and further provides methods of treatment of various diseases and conditions<br>
comprising administering an effective amount of a glycodendrimer of the invention to a<br>
subject, generally a human, in need of such treatment. For use as a medicament or in<br>
medical treatment, a glycodendrimer of the present invention is preferably produced<br>
according to the process of the present invention using an aqueous solvent. The term<br>
'treatment' is used herein to mean treatment and/or prevention, as appropriate. The<br>
invention includes the use of the glycodendrimers of the invention in veterinary medicine.<br>
These new anionic glycodendrimers downregulate the immune system by acting first and<br>
foremost on the release of chemokines, most notably macrophage inflammatory protein<br>
(MP) ip, MEP-lct and interleukin 8 (IOL-8. The compounds inhibit the release of proinflammatory<br>
chemokines which, in turn, inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines<br>
most notably tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-cc, EL-lp and IL-6. The compounds of the<br>
invention also have antiangiogenic properties.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a glycodenrimer of the present invention<br>
for use as a medicament for the treatment of a disease in which chemokines and cytokines<br>
are increased, and also provides a method of such treatment, and the use of a<br>
glycodendrimer of the present invention for the manufacture of a medicament for such<br>
treatment.<br>
The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in the treatment of, for example,<br>
sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, the systemic inflammatory response associated with<br>
sepsis, rheumatological disease, eczema, psoriasis, contraction of tissues during wound<br>
healing, excessive scar formation during wound healing, transplant rejection, graft versus<br>
host disease and various conditions associated with angiogenesis in animals and man. <br>
glycodendrimer of the iinvention may be used therapeutically or prophylactically.<br>
Rheumatological and inflammatory conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile<br>
chronic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis occuring after an infection, active<br>
ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet's<br>
disease including Behcet's disease with panuveitis and/or retinal vasculitis, psoriasis,<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis).<br>
Further conditions include allogeneic organ and tissue transplantation, graft versus host<br>
disease. A transplant may be a corneal, kidney, heart, lung, heart-lung, skin, liver, gut or<br>
bone marrow transplant. Diseases and conditions involving angiogenesis include diseases<br>
associated with metastatic tumour cell growth, which includes many cancers, and diabetic<br>
retinopathy. In the case of transplantion, a glycodendrimer of the invention may be<br>
adminsitered to the recipient before the transplantation is carried out. Alternatively or in<br>
addition, a tissue or organ for transplantaion may be treated with a glycodendrimer of the<br>
invention in vitro before transplantation, for example, in the case of a corneal transplant, a<br>
glycodendrimer of the invention may be added to the solution in which the cornea is stored<br>
before transplantation.<br>
The term 'sepsis syndrome' refers to sepsis plus impaired organ perfusion. The spectrum of<br>
clinical syndromes ranging from bacteremia to sepsis to severe sepsis to septic shock to<br>
refractory septic shock and to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome represents a<br>
continuum in which localised inflammation is at one end with a severe generalised<br>
inflammatory response leading to multi-organ failure being at the other end of the<br>
spectrum. In severe cases, death can occur within a few hours.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the compounds have activity against the<br>
systemic inflammatory response syndrome that is associated with bacterial or fungal<br>
infections. A glycodendrimer of the present invention may be used to treat sepsis caused<br>
by the lipopolysaccharide from grani negative bacteria, or a superantigen toxin from a gram<br>
positive bacterium, for example the severe sepsis, the septic shock or the systemic<br>
inflammatory response associated with sepsis caused by the lipopolysaccharide from gram<br>
negative bacteria, or a superantigen toxin from a gram positive bacterium.<br><br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising<br>
a glycodendrimers of the invention and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds and formulations of the invention are suitable for administration<br>
intravenously, orally, intraperitoneally, topically (skin), buccal, rectally, to the surface of<br>
the skin, transdermal (slow release preparation), subcutaneously, intramuscularly,<br>
intranasally, by aerosol , by pulmonary adminsitration, and directly to the eye.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds according to the invention are dendrimer gen. 3.5-<br>
glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulphate which have been proven to be<br>
useful.<br>
For example in human cell lines, the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine showed ICso toxicity<br>
values that ranged from 1,825 to 3,000 ng/ml, and the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine <br>
sulfate showed ICso toxicity values that ranged from 246 - 307 jig/ml. In freshly isolated,<br>
human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells and in freshly isolated human<br>
monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDM), the ICso toxicity value for dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine was 340-360 jig/ml. In freshly isolated, human peripheral blood mononuclear<br>
cells and in freshly isolated human monocyte-derived macrophages, the ICso toxicity value<br>
for dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate, the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-<br>
disulfate, and the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate was 230-260<br>
Single donor MDMs were cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine up to a<br>
concentration of 150 ug/ml for 72 h. No reduction in cell viability was seen. Single donor<br>
HUVECs were cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine up to a concentration of 100<br>
ug/ml for 72 h. No reduction in cell viability was seen. The dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
was not toxic to Wistar rats when injected intravenously at a concentration of up to 30<br>
mg/kg.<br>
Neither dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine nor dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate<br>
affected the release of chemokines or cytokines from immune cells that were in their<br>
normal resting state. Activity of these two compounds was only seen when these<br>
compounds were cultured with cells that had been immunologically stimulated by an<br>
antigen in some way. Therefore, these two compounds do not interfere with the normal<br>
homeostatic control under which primary, human cells operate on a day-to-day basis. As<br>
such, they differ from all other sulphated polysaccharides.<br>
When single donor PBMN cells are cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine at 100<br>
Hg/ml the release of macrophage iiiflaminatory protein-la (MlP-la; chemokine),<br>
macrophage inflammatory protein-ip (MIP-lp; chemokine), Interleukin-8 (IL-8;<br>
chemokine), Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a; cytokine), Interleukin-lp (TL-1P;<br>
cytokine) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6; cytokine) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 5 ng/ml is<br>
significantly reduced. When single donor PBMN cells are cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine at 200 ug/ml the release of MlP-la, MIP-lp, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-lp and IL-6 by<br>
LPS at 5 ng/ml is significantly reduced. When single donor PBMN cells are cultured with<br>
LPS at 5 ng/ml for 30 min, or 1 hour, or 2 hours, or 3 hours, or 4 hours before the addition of<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine at 100 ug/ml, the release of MlP-la, MIP-lp, IL-8, TNFa,<br>
EL-lp and IL-6 is significantly reduced. It has been shown that the dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine is not mediating its activity by binding to the LPS used in these experiments.<br>
It is believed that the dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine<br>
6-sulphate mediate their effects by acting as polyvalent binding inhibitors of the<br>
immunoregulatory functions of dendritic cells and of lymphocytes. This action is mediated<br>
through toll like receptors, chernokines and cytokines.<br>
When single donor PBMN cells are cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine at 300<br>
Hg/ml whose loading with glucosamine is only 3% (rather than the 7% used in all other<br>
experiments), the release of Mff-la, MIP-lp, DL-8, TNF-a, IL-lp and IL-6 by LPS at 5<br>
ng/ml is significantly reduced. When single donor PBMN cells from 2 or 3 individuals are<br>
mixed together and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine is added at 50 jig/ml, there is a<br>
significant reduction in the release of MIP-lp and TNF-a. When single donor PBMN cells<br>
from 2 or 3 individuals are mixed together and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine is added at<br>
100 ug/ml, followed by LPS at 5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml, there is a significant reduction in the<br>
release of MEP-1 p.<br>
None of the compounds described (ie: dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine, dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 6-sulfate, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate, or dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate) has any anticoagulant activity as determined using the<br>
11<br>
following in vitro assays:- kaolin partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin<br>
time and a Factor Xa assay. No anticoagulant activity was seen at the maximum<br>
concentration of 200 /^g/ml that was analysed for all of the compounds tested. For<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine, this was also confirmed at a concentration of 300 /tg/ml.<br>
The compounds of the present invention constitute the first group of sulphated<br>
polysaccharides that have been synthesised that have no anticoagulant activity. They are<br>
therefore particularly suitable for intravenous administration in animal and in man.<br>
New vessel formation is inhibited by a direct effect of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-<br>
sulfate on normal endothelial cells. Its effect is to prevent endothelial cells coming together<br>
to form new endothelial vessels and to form new blood vessels. In contrast to all other<br>
sulphated polysaccharides that have been developed as anti-angiogenic compounds, the<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate synthesised has no anticoagulant activity. The<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate does not affect cell viability or the growth<br>
characteristics of PBMN cells or MDMs when present at a concentration of up to 150<br>
fig/ml in cultures of these cells mat are maintained for up to 5 days.<br>
The dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate construct is not toxic to HUVECs when<br>
added to cultures of these cells up to a concentration of 100 ng/ml for up to 72 hours.<br>
When single donor PBMN cells are cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate<br>
at 150 ug/ml or at 200 ug/ml, the release of Mff-lp and TNF-cc by LPS at 5 ng/ml is<br>
significantly reduced.<br>
When single donor MDMs from 4 individuals are mixed and dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine or dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate is added at 25 ug/ml, there is a<br>
significant reduction in the release of MIP-lp.<br>
Using the human umbilical vein endothelial cell Matrigel assay as an in vitro model of<br>
angiogenesis, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate inhibits new vessel formation and<br>
prevents new blood vessel formation; ie: angiogenesis.<br>
Using an in vitro angiogenesis assay based on the outgrowth of new blood vessels from<br>
human placentas, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate causes a reduction in the<br>
12<br>
number of new vessels that are formed when it is present at 25 (xg/ml. The effect is<br>
significantly greater at 50 |ig/ml.<br>
The compounds of the invention are suitable for reducing the severity of the sepsis<br>
syndrome in animals and in man. They can be administered intravenously, orally or<br>
intraperitoneally at a concentration ranging from 2.5 to 2,500 jj,g/ml. The preferred<br>
concentration is 25 |ig/ml to 250 \ig/ml.<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis the compounds of the invention slow, abort or even prevent the<br>
acute-on-chronic tissue damage that is seen in this disease. The administration of the<br>
compounds in rheumatoid arthritis (especially early on in the course of the disease) would<br>
significantly reduce the release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines (MlP-la, MIP-lp and<br>
IL-8) which, in turn, would reduce or abolish the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines<br>
(TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6).<br>
The simultaneous administration of mixtures of two or more compounds of the invention to<br>
inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and, in turn, inhibit the release of proinflammatory<br>
cytokines, and to concurrently inhibit angiogenesis is able to result in<br>
considerable synergy of action with minimal toxicity. For example the simultaneous<br>
administration of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-<br>
sulfate provides considerable synergy of action with lower doses and less frequent<br>
administration being possible.<br>
The application of topical (ie: skin) preparations of the compounds of the invention to the<br>
active plaque lesions of psoriasis or eczema or excessive scar formation or the contraction<br>
of tissues during wound healing (especially early on in the course of the disease) results in<br>
the healing of these lesions by reducing or preventing endothelial cell proliferation and the<br>
angiogenic response.<br>
The application of compounds of the invention to reduce or prevent new endothelial cell<br>
formation into vessels during its earliest stages is beneficial for the treatment of the skin<br>
lesions of psoriasis or eczema or excessive scar formation or the contraction of tissues that<br>
can occur during wound healing, hi particular the administration of compounds such as<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine is suitable to reduce the release of the pro-inflammatory<br>
chemoldnes (MlP-la, MDM|3 and IL-8) and, in turn, the release of the pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6)<br>
The simultaneous administration of mixtures such as dendrimer glucosamine and dendrimer<br>
glucosamine 6-sulfate to inhibit angiogenesis and to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory<br>
chemoldnes and, in turn, the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines results in<br>
considerable synergy of action with minimal toxicity in psoriasis. In particular, this<br>
provides a therapeutic benefit to the treatment of dermatological and rheumatological<br>
conditions.<br>
The compounds of the invention are suitable for administration intravenously, orally,<br>
buccal, intraperitoneally, into the joint space, rectally, to the surface of the skin,<br>
transdermal (slow release preparation), subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, to the<br>
eyes as eye drops, by intravitreal (i.e. into the eye) injection, or by aerosol (eg. topically to<br>
the lungs) at a concentration ranging from 2.5 to 2,500 tig/ml. The preferred concentration<br>
is 25 fig/ml to 250 ng/mL<br>
Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are the major forms of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
The oral or intravenous administration of compounds such as dendrimer gen. 3.5-<br>
glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate are especially suitable early on<br>
in the course of the disease. The drug would accumulate in the tissues associated with the<br>
small bowel and the large bowel.<br>
Intervention with a compound of the invention which reduces or prevents new endothelial<br>
cell formation into vessels (i.e.: neo-angiogenesis) during its earliest stages is beneficial for<br>
the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
Intervention with a compound of the invention which reduces or prevents new endothelial<br>
cell formation into vessels (i.e.: neo-angiogenesis) during its earliest stages could be<br>
beneficial for the prevention of the destructive arthritis that can develop in the clinical<br>
course of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
The administration of compounds of the present invention could significantly reduce the<br>
release of the pro-inflammatory chemoldnes (MlP-la, MEP-1P and IL-8) and, in turn, the<br>
release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNP-a, IL-1 and EL-6) in inflammatory bowel<br>
disease.<br>
The simultaneous administration of compounds such as dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate to concurrently inhibit angiogenesis and to<br>
inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and, in turn, the release of proinflammatory<br>
cytokines provides for considerable synergy of action with minimal toxicity.<br>
The compounds will accumulate in the inflamed tissues that are central to the<br>
pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The<br>
endothelial cells associated with areas of inflammation and the increased vascularity caused<br>
by the development of angiogenesis will facilitate the accumulation of the compounds into<br>
the areas of inflammation.<br>
Particularly advantageous features of the present invention include: the inhibition of the<br>
release of chemokines and, in turn, cytokines that results in the rejection of autologous,<br>
allogeneic, syngeneic or xenogenic organ transplants, the inhibition of the release of<br>
chemokines and, in turn, cytokines, and the angiogenesis that results in the rejection of<br>
autologous, allogenic, syngeneic or xenogenic organ transplants, effective maintenance of<br>
the counter inflammatory environment that is required to prevent the rejection of the<br>
transplanted organ, and effective maintenance of the counter inflammatory environment<br>
that is required to prevent the development of graft versus host disease.<br>
hi a preferred aspect, the present invention also provides the use of dendrimer gen. 3.5-<br>
glucosamine and/or dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine sulfate in any form of organ or tissue<br>
transplant. This includes comeal, kidney, heart, lung, liver, gut, skin and bone marrow<br>
transplantation.<br>
Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate has a direct effect on normal endothelial cells<br>
which leads to the inhibition of new vessel formation. The administration of dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate to patients provides a way of preventing the angiogenesis that is<br>
necessary for the establishment and the subsequent growth and development of a metastatic<br>
deposit of malignant cells into a tumour especially if administered early on in the course of<br>
the disease.<br>
A drug like dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate or a combination of dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate which reduces or prevents<br>
the proliferation of endothelial cells and prevents neo-angiogenesis during the earliest<br>
stages of the growth of the metastatic lesion provides a way to abort or even prevent the<br>
development of the metastatic lesion.<br>
A particularly preferred formulation for use in patients is dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
(7%) and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate (7%) which is being used at 100 to 200<br>
j4.g/ml.<br>
Particularly preferred polymers have glucosamine or sulfated glucosamine covalently<br>
linked to the anionic dendrimer. The dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate were found to downregulate the release of the chemokines<br>
macrophage inflammatory protein-la, macrophage inflammatory protein-lp, and<br>
interleukin-8, and, in turn, downregulates the release of the cytokines tumour necrosis<br>
factor-a, interleukin-lp and interleukin-6 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.<br>
Compounds of the present invention such as dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine can also be<br>
used in combination with existing and accepted therapeutic approaches as adjuvant therapy.<br>
For example, in the sepsis syndrome they could be used with antibacterial drugs or<br>
antifungal drugs. In rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions, Behcet's disease,<br>
inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, they could be used with steroids and disease<br>
modifying drugs such as methotrexate or disease modifying therapeutic antibodies. In the<br>
treatment of cancer metastases, they could be used with anti-mitotic drugs. In the treatment<br>
of organ transplant rejection, and in graft versus host disease, they could be used with<br>
steroids and/or cyclosporin and/or FK506 and/or azathioprine and/or tacrolimus and/or<br>
sirolimus and/or basiliximab and/or daclizumab.<br>
The dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate has anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic<br>
properties. It is therefore useful as sole or as adjuvant therapy in rheumatoid arthritis and<br>
related conditions, Behcet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, in the treatment<br>
of cancer metastases, rejection of organ transplants, and graft versus host disease.<br>
Alternatively, the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
6-sulfate could be used in combination for the treatment of each of these disorders. The<br>
simultaneous administrations of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 6-sulfate offers considerable synergy of action with lower doses and less<br>
frequent administration being required and thereby reduce drug toxicity.<br>
A further advantage of the glycodendrimers of the present invention is that they are large<br>
molecules. Tissue based sites of inflammation are more permeable to circularing molecules<br>
and cells than is healthy tissue, irrespective of what triggers the inflammatory response.<br>
Large molecules accumulate in areas of inflammation more rapidly that they do in normal<br>
tissue. The glycodendrimers of the present invention will therefore tend to accumulate at<br>
sites of inflammation.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the following examples.<br>
A) CHEMISTRY AND TOXICITY ;<br>
Examples A1) Chemical synthesis:<br>
Starburst PAMAM anionic dendrimers generation 2.5 and 3.5 (Figure la &amp; b) synthesised<br>
by the divergent approach were used (Available from Dendritech Inc, Midland, MI, USA or<br>
Sigma /Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, England, UK). D-glucosamine hydrochloride, Dglucosamine<br>
6-sulfate hydrochloride, D-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate and D-glucosamine<br>
3,4,6-trisulfate were used as the sodium salt. A known amount of the dendrimers (gen 1.5<br>
or gen 2.5 or gen 3.5) stored as the sodium salt in methanol solution were evaporated under<br>
a nitrogen stream in order to obtain 1 mmol of dendrimer sodium salt. The dendrimers were<br>
then solubilised in double deionised water and the pH reduced with hydrochloric acid (HC1)<br>
in order to transform the surface groups from the non-reactive sodium carboxylated (COO"<br>
Na*) to the reactive carboxylic acid (COOH). A known amount of glucosamine<br>
hydrochloride, glucosamine 6-sulfate, glucosamine 3,6-disulfate, or glucosamine 3,4,6-<br>
trisulfate was solubilised in double deionised water and the pH increased with triethylamine<br>
in order to obtain the reactive free base (NH2). In the preparation of the dendrimerglucosamine<br>
conjugates, the reaction was spiked with a known amount of 14C-glucosamine<br>
solution in double deionised water in order to follow the reaction and determine the amount<br>
of glucosaraine attached to the dendrimers. The glucosamine and 14C-glucosamine aqueous<br>
solution or sulfated glucosamine solutions were then added to the dendrimer solution and<br>
an acid pH maintained with HC1. Subsequently, an excess of the condensing agent 1-ethyl-<br>
3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride was solubilised in water and added<br>
to the reaction solution (Figure 2). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature.<br>
Notably, the reaction can take place at ambient room temperature (i.e. 
require the application of an external energy source.<br>
Having prepared the dendrimer-glucosamine conjugates, some of the reaction mixture was<br>
passed through a PD-10 column and the fractions collected read on a fi-counter to establish<br>
the presence of a high molecular weight conjugated compound. The reaction mixture was<br>
then purified in order to eliminate the unreacted glucosamine, the excess l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, and the urea formed during the<br>
reaction. In the case of dendrimers gen 3.5, the reaction mixture was dialysed against water<br>
and subsequently freeze-dried. In the case of the lower molecular weight generation<br>
dendrimers, the reaction mixture was freeze-dried, re-solubilised in deionised water and<br>
then passed through a Sephadex G15 column. The fractions at higher molecular weight<br>
containing the purified conjugate were collected, pooled together and freeze-dried.<br>
After purification, a portion of the dendrimer-glucosamine conjugate was passed through a<br>
PD-10 column and the fractions collected read on a 8-counter to monitor for the presence of<br>
unbound glucosamine. The total amount of glucosamine bound to the surface of the<br>
dendrimers was also determined using a fi-counter. Characterisation and reproducibility of<br>
synthesis data for the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine is shown in Table 1. In the case of the<br>
dendrimer-glucosamine sulfate conjugates, the amount of sulfated sugar attached to the<br>
polymer was determined by sulphur analysis: a known weight of the sample was combusted<br>
in an atmosphere of oxygen in a Schoniger oxygen flask. The products of combustion were<br>
washed into a 50 ml flask with double deionised water and made up to volume. This<br>
solution was analysed for sulphate content by ion chromatography using Dionex 100 ion<br>
chromatography. All of the prepared conjugates were also analysed by infrared<br>
spectroscopy. Characterisation and reproducibility of the synthesis data for the dendrimer<br>
gen 3.5-sulfated glucosamine constructs is shown in Table 2.<br>
All of the conjugates were treated with activated carbon to remove endotoxin (i.e.: LPS)<br>
prior to their biological evaluation. Endotoxin could also be removed from the compounds<br>
synthesised using a column packed with polymixin B. The freeze-dried, purified,<br>
hygroscopic product was stored under airtight conditions. Endotoxin levels were<br>
18<br>
determined using the Hmulus amebocyte lysate assay. All biological data was derived with<br>
oatches of compounds whose endotoxin level was 
Examples A 2 : Chemical characterisation of dendrimer-gtucosamine and dendrimersulfated<br>
glucosamine conjugates;<br>
When glucosamine was conjugated to the dendrimers, the fractions collected by gel<br>
filtration (PD-10 column) of the reaction mixture and subsequently analysed at the ficounter<br>
showed a peak in fractions 7, 8,9 &amp; 10 collected (Figure 3). This peak denotes the<br>
presence of a high molecular weight structure containing 14C-glucosamine confirming the<br>
formation of a dendrimer-glucosamine conjugate. FT-IR spectra peaks at 1640 cm"1 and<br>
1560 cm"1, in conjugation with the peak at 3260 cm"1 indicate the formation of the amide<br>
bond (Figure 4 and Figure 5). In the case of dendrimer-sulfated glucosamine conjugates,<br>
the further peak at 1210 cm"1 (Figure 6 for the dendrimer-glucosamine 6-sulfate conjugate)<br>
indicates the presence of sulfated glucosamine with prevention of loss of sulfuric acid<br>
during the conjugation.<br>
The amount of glucosamine linked to the dendrimers, expressed as a percentage of<br>
converted carboxylic groups, ranged from 1.5 to 10.1 %. hi the case of the sulfated<br>
dendrimers, the sulphur content increased in the following order: monosulfated sugar (2.79<br>
% m:m S); disulfated sugar (5.78 % rn:m S); trisulfated sugar (7.93 % m:m S). From the<br>
sulphur content, it was possible to calculate the amount of sulfate present in the conjugate<br>
as being 6 % in the case of glucosamine 6-sulfate, 11 % in the case of glucosamine 3,6-<br>
disulfate and 15 % in the case of the glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate conjugate.<br>
The one-step reaction was also investigated as a feasible method for the conjugation of:-<br>
a) PAMAM anionic dendrimers gen 2.5 to molecules containing aminic groups as well as<br>
to glucosamine 6-sulfate. The presence of characteristic peaks for the amide bond (3270<br>
cm"1, 1640 and 1550 cm"1) indicated the formation of a conjugate between dendrimers and<br>
glucosamine or sulfated glucosamine as was seen with the generation 3.5 dendrimers.<br>
Molecules described above, can be attached to the anionic PAMAM dendrimers using the<br>
same chemistry. This has been successfully achieved for 3-amino-l-propanesulfonic acid,<br>
2-amino ethanesulfonic acid and aminomethane sulfonic acid as examples.<br>
19<br>
It is known that guest molecules can become trapped in the core of the dendrimer (Kempen<br>
HIM, Hoes C, van Boom JM, Spanjer HH, de Lange J, Langendoen A &amp; van Berkel TJC.<br>
(1984) A water-soluble cholesteryl-containing trisgalactoside - synthesis, properties, and<br>
use in directing lipid-containing particles to the liver. Journal Medicinal Chemistry 27,<br>
1306-1312). Therefore it was important to determine the amount of unbound glucosamine<br>
inside the dendritic structure. This was undertaken by keeping a known amount of the<br>
conjugate in solution over a period of time and then determining the amount of unbound<br>
glucosamine present by gel filtration. Figure 7 (i) shows the gel filtration profiles of the<br>
conjugate stored in aqueous solution compared to free glucosamine; the amount of unbound<br>
glucosamine increased only slightly over time from 3.1 wt % at day 0 to 7.5 wt % after 90<br>
days of storage at 4°C. Therefore, it was concluded that the covalent amide bond is stable<br>
and that there was no significant entrapment of free glucosamine within the dendrimer.<br>
Similar results were obtained from the dendrimer-glucosamine gen 2.5 after 30 days of<br>
storage under similar conditions (Figure 7(ii)).<br>
These observations allow a calculation of the number of molecules of glucosamine or<br>
sulfated glucosamine that have been linked to 1 molecule of dendrimer because all of the<br>
glucosamine or glucosamine sulfate molecules are linked to the outer surface of the<br>
dendrimer. The number of molecules of sulfated sugar linked to 1 molecule of dendrimer<br>
did not change with increasing numbers of sulfated groups attached to the glucosamine<br>
moiety, showing that the one-step reaction can be used as a standard method for<br>
conjugating sulfated glucosamine derivatives to dendrimers. The number of molecules of<br>
glucosamine or sulfated glucosamine linked to 1 molecule of dendrimer generation 2.5 is<br>
lower when compared to generation 3.5 because there are 32 carboxylic terminal groups in<br>
the former and 64 carboxylic acid groups in the latter. Therefore, due to the higher loading<br>
and the minimal toxicity of the generation 3.5 dendrimers, these conjugates were chosen as<br>
candidates for further biological investigation.<br>
Examples A 3 ; Conjugation of glucosamine to dendrimer gen 3.5 with DMSO as the<br>
reaction solvent;<br>
A test tube was charged with PAMAM dendrimer gen 3.5 methanol solution and the<br>
solvent removed under a fast stream of nitrogen. The clear solid residue obtained was<br>
further dried in a vacuum oven for approximately 3 hours. The isolated solid was then<br>
dissolved in de-ionised water and the resulting solution acidified to approximately pH 3<br>
using 0.1 N HC1. The solution was then purified/de-salted by dialysing against de-ionised<br>
water for 2 days (Visking dialysis tubing, Medicell Intemational Ltd, MWCO 3500).<br>
Freeze-drying of the dialysed solution afforded the protonated dendrimer as a clear glassy<br>
solid.<br>
The protonated dendrimer (150 mg), N-hydroxysuccinimide (9.6 mg), glucosamine<br>
hydrochloride (12.6 mg) and a magnetic stir bar were added to a 1.5 mL vial and the vial<br>
sealed with a septum-centred screw cap lid. A nitrogen atmosphere was then introduced<br>
into the vial, followed by anhydrous DMSO (0.7 mL) using a syringe. The resulting<br>
mixture was allowed to stir until a homogeneous solution had formed. Separately, 1,3-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (17.1 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO (0.3 mL) under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere in a 1.5 mL vial. A homogeneous solution was allowed to form which<br>
was then added by syringe to the stirred dendrimer reaction solution. The 1,3-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide vial was washed with fresh DMSO (0.1 mL) and this solution<br>
was also added to the dendrimer vial. After 15 min, triethylamine (12 pL) was added to the<br>
dendrimer solution by syringe and the resulting solution allowed to stir overnight at room<br>
temperature. To the reaction mixture was then added 1 N sodium hydroxide (800 pL). The<br>
resulting mixture was transferred to a larger vial, diluted with approximately 3 mL of deionised<br>
water and then filtered through a glass pipette with a piece of cotton-wool to act as<br>
a filter. The homogeneous supernatant was diluted to approximately 100 mL with deionised<br>
water and then dialysed against de-ionised water for 3 d (Visking dialysis tubing,<br>
Medicell International Ltd, MWCO 3500) followed by freeze-drying to afford a solid<br>
product.<br>
In an alternative procedure, glucosamine hydrochloride (18.0 mg) was added with<br>
triethylamine (23 fiL) in DMSO (0.2 mL) to a stirred dendrimer (150 mg) and Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
(9.6 mg) solution in DMSO (0.7 mL) that had been activated with 1,3-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (17.1 mg) for 1 h. This alternative procedure also afforded a<br>
solid product after dialysis and freeze-drying. Glucosamine conjugation to the dendrimer<br>
gen. 3.5 was confirmed and quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry<br>
in deuterium oxide. The mol% glucosamine conjugation was calculated to be 3.8 ± 0.4.<br>
Examples A 4: Toxicitv of compounds in human cell lines;<br>
The compounds synthesised were evaluated for their toxicity in the following cell lines:-<br>
the human T-cell line (Sup-Tl), a human T-cell line transformed with HTLV-1 (C8166),<br>
the human monocytic cell line (U937), the brain cell line transfected with human CD4 and<br>
the human chemokine receptor CCR5 (U87-CD4-CCR5), and the murine melanoma cell<br>
Une (B16F10).<br>
Dendrimers, glucosamine, glucosamine 6-sulfate and dendrimer conjugates were incubated<br>
with each cell line. Sup-Tl, C8166, U937, U87-CD4-CCR5 and B16F10 cells were seeded<br>
at a density of 2 x 10s cell/ml and B16F10 cells were seeded at 1 x 105 cell/ml in 96 well<br>
microtiter plates in medium containing RPMI 1640, 20 mM L-glutamine, penicillin [250<br>
HJ/ml], streptomycin [250 fig/ml] and 10 % fetal calf serum. The conjugates or controls<br>
were incubated for 67 h with the cells at concentrations ranging from 0 - 5,000 ng/ml. An<br>
MTT assay was then used to determine cell viability and the results were expressed as a<br>
percentage of that for cells grown in me absence of any compound.<br>
Dextran and poly(L-lysine) were used as negative and positive controls respectively.<br>
Glucosamine and glucosamine 6-sulfate showed no toxicity at concentrations up to 1,000<br>
|ag/ml. Higher concentrations of these compounds could not be evaluated because<br>
glucosamine interferes with the MTT assay above his concentration. Dendrimers gen 3.5<br>
and dendrimers gen 2.5 showed no toxicity up to concentrations of 5,000 fig/ml. The<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate showed ICso values ranging from 1,825 to 3,000<br>
(ig/ml in the different cell lines The deudrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate conjugate had<br>
IC5o values ranging from 246 -307 fig/ml (Table 3).<br>
Examples A 5: Toxicitv of compounds against primary human cells in vitro;<br>
The dendrimers and the dendrimer conjugates were incubated with freshly isolated, human<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells and with freshly isolated human monocytederived-<br>
rnacrophages (MDM).<br>
Human PBMN cells and human MDMs were separated from buffy coat residues within 24<br>
h of collection by density gradient centrifugation. The cells were then washed with<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), re-suspended in lymphocyte growth medium (RPMI<br>
22<br>
1640, 20 mM L-glutamine, penicillin [250 lU/ml], streptomycin [250 ng/ml] and 15 %<br>
foetal calf serum) containing human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2, 20 lU/ml) for 3 days<br>
and then plated in a 96 well plate at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml. To separate MDMs, the<br>
remaining cells were re-suspended in macrophage-growth medium (RPMI1640,20 mM Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin [250 ILJ/ml], streptomycin [250 |xg/ml] and 10 % human serum) and<br>
plated hi a plastic dish for 2 h. MDMs were then scraped, washed and plated in a 96 well<br>
plate at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml. The monocytes were allowed to differentiate to<br>
MDMs by a further 3 days of adherence. The compounds were then added to PBMN cells<br>
or to MDMs (1 x 106 eells/ml) and incubated for 67 h. Cell viability was assessed using the<br>
MTT assay at 72 h.<br>
Dendrimer gen 3.5 and glucosamine 6-sulfate were not toxic to PBMN cells or to MDMs<br>
up to the maximum concentration of 1,000 ng/ml that was evaluated. The ICso value for<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was 340-360 ng/ml in primary cells as determined using an<br>
MTT assay. The ICso value for the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate construct, the<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate construct, and the dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate conjugate was 230-260 u.g/ml in primary cells as determined<br>
using an MTT assay.<br>
Examples A 6; The effect of the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and the dendrimer<br>
gen 3.5 sulfated glucosamine conjugates on the release of MIP-1P from single donor,<br>
human PBMN cells. MDMs and peritoneal macrophages:<br>
Recent studies have shown that macrophage inflammatory protein-ip (MlP-lfi) is the<br>
earliest pro-inflammatory chemokine that is released by cells of macrophage origin after<br>
they have been exposed to an inflammatory stimulus (Wang Z-M, Liu C &amp; Dziarski R.<br>
Chemokines are the main pro-inflammatory mediators in human monocytes activated by<br>
Staphylococcus aureus, peptidoglycan, and endotoxin. (2000) J. Biological Chemistry 275;<br>
20260-20267). All the polymers that have been studied to date, irrespective of whether they<br>
have been derived from a natural source or have been synthetically made have shown a<br>
significant ability to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines<br>
from immune cells. We therefore exposed single donor human PBMN cells, single donor<br>
human MDMs, and single donor human peritoneal macrophages to the compounds<br>
synthesised in order to determine whether they induced any pro-inflammatory responses<br>
from these cells.<br>
Cells were isolated as previously described within 4 hours of collection and then plated at<br>
IxlO6 cells/ml. Dendrimer gen 3.5, dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine, dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 6-sulfate, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate, and dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate were then added to the cells at a concentration of 50 to 200<br>
l. Cell free culture supernatants were harvested 36 h later and assayed for MIP-lp.<br>
No release of MIP-lp above that seen in the control wells occurred with:<br>
a) PBMN cells and dendrimer gen 3.5, dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine, or dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate at 50 p.g/ml (Figure 8(i)).<br>
b) MDMs and dendrimer gen 3.5, dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine, or dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 6-sulfate at 50 jig/ml (Figure 8(ii) and Figure 8(iii)).<br>
c) MDMs and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate, and dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate at 50 |ag/ml (Figure 9).<br>
d) Peritoneal macrophages after 36 h (Figure 10(i) and Figure 10(ii)) and after 72 h (Figure<br>
10(iii)) of culture with dendrimer gen 3.5, dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine, or dendrimer<br>
gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate with each molecule at 25 ng/ml.<br>
e) Peritoneal macrophages after 36 h of culture with dendrimer gen 3.5, dendrimer gen 3.5<br>
glucosamine or dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate with each molecule at 50<br>
fig/ml (Figure 1 l(i) and Figure 1 l(ii) respectively).<br>
f) Peritoneal macrophages after 36 h of culture with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-<br>
disulfate or dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate with each molecule at 50<br>
|j.g/ml (Figure 12(i) and Figure 12(ii) respectively).<br>
g) Peritoneal macrophages after 36 h of culture with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-<br>
disulfate or dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate with each molecule at 100<br>
ug/ml (Figure 13(i) and Figure 13(ii)) and at 200 |j,g/ml (Figure 13(iii) and Figure<br>
Therefore, in conclusion, it is important to note that dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine,<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate, and<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate did not affect the release of chemokines or<br>
cytokines from immune cells (ie: primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,<br>
human monocyte derived macrophages or human peritoneal macrophages) that were in their<br>
normal resting state. This is the first time that a glycodendrimer has been shown not to affect<br>
human primary cells in their normal resting state. Therefore when administered as a<br>
medicine, these molecules will only have a drug mediated effect on diseased human cells.<br>
These two compounds will not interfere with the routine homeostatic control under which<br>
normal human cells operate on a day-to-day basis.<br>
EXAMPLES B ; EXPERIMENTS WITH LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS):<br>
The effect of the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate on the release of<br>
chemokines and, in turn, cvtokines by LPS from single donor human PBMN cells;<br>
PBMN cells were isolated from fresh blood from single donors by density gradient<br>
centrifugation. The cells were re-suspended in growth medium (RPMI 1640, 20 mM Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin [250 IU/ml], streptomycin [250 ^ml] and 10 % endotoxin free<br>
human serum) and the cell density adjusted to 2 x 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of the cell<br>
suspension were transferred to a 12-well tissue culture plate and incubated for 15 min at<br>
37°C. To these PBMN cells, LPS was added (usually at 5 ng/ml) either before or after the<br>
addition of the endotoxin free dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine. In the first set of<br>
experiments, the LPS (Salmonella minnesota, Sigma. Catalogue number L9764) was added<br>
30 min to 24 h after the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate. In the second set of<br>
experiments, the LPS was added 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h or 4 h before the dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine. The concentration of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine added was 150 - 200<br>
Hg/ml. The cells were then maintained at 37°C with 5% COi. Cell free supernatants were<br>
collected at regular time points up to a maximum of 96 h later and assayed for macrophage<br>
inflammatory protein-la (MlP-la), macrophage inflammatory protein-lp (MIP-lp),<br>
hiterleukin-8 (IL-8), Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a), Interleukin-lp (IL-lp) and<br>
Interleukin-6 (IL-6).<br>
Experiment B 1: Single donor MDMs were prepared as described and cultured with<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine up to a concentration of 150 ng/ml for 72 h. No reduction in<br>
cell viability was seen when compared to MDMs cultured in media alone over a period of 72<br>
h (Figure 14(i)).<br>
Single donor, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were also prepared as<br>
follows. Umbilical cords were obtained from placentas from the maternity wards of<br>
Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals within 4 h of delivery. Excess blood was<br><br>
removed from the cord by massaging the outside. The cord was then sprayed with 70%<br>
alcohol and wiped. The ends were cut with sharp scissors and the umbilical vein identified.<br>
14 gauge cannulas with luer lock ends were inserted into each end of the umbilical vein and<br>
tied in place. The vein was then flushed through with HBSS (Sigma, Poole, Dorset) using a<br>
20 ml syringe attached to a cannula. Endothelial cells were dislodged from the vein using a<br>
solution of 20 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma) in HBSS (20 ml) and filter sterilised using a 20<br>
urn membrane. Using a second 20 ml syringe, this solution was introduced into the umbilical<br>
vein and carefully agitated by gently applying pressure to each syringe in turn. The cord was<br>
then incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 20 min with a second agitation for 10 min. The<br>
collagenase A solution was removed from the cord and added to 20 ml of media containing<br>
20% PCS to quench the enzyme and a further 20 ml of media flushed through the vein to<br>
remove any remaining endothelial cells. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (400g/5 min),<br>
resuspended in 5 ml growth media [MEM alpha (Sigma)] containing 20% PCS, L-glutamine<br>
(2 mM), 200 RJ/ml penicillin, 200 ug/ml streptomycin and 50 ug/ml clinical grade heparin<br>
(Leo Laboratories, Bucks). They were then transferred to collagen coated 25 cm2 tissue<br>
culture flasks and incubated at 37°C with 5% CC^. After 48 h incubation, 5 ug/ml<br>
endothelial cell growth supplement (EGGS - Sigma) was added.<br>
Cultures were examined daily using an inverted microscope. When confluent, growth<br>
medium was aspirated and replaced with an equal volume of HBSS at 37°C. Cells were then<br>
removed by trypsinisation. The HBSS was aspirated and replaced with 2 ml trypsin (0.5<br>
mg/ml)/EDTA (0.2 mg/ml) solution in HBSS (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and incubated<br>
at 37°C for 5-10 min until all cells had been removed from the bottom of the flask. Cells were<br>
then split to a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 with fresh growth media containing EGGS (5 ug/ml) and<br>
transferred to the appropriate flask or tissue culture plate depending upon the assay being<br>
performed.<br>
The HUVECs were cultured with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine up to a concentration of<br>
100 ng/ml for 72 h. No reduction in cell viability was seen when compared to HUVECs<br>
cultured in media alone over a period of 72 h (Figure 14(ii)).<br>
Experiment B 2: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were men plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and then cultured for 15 min<br>
at 37°C in 5% CO2. LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free culture supernatants were<br>
harvested at regular intervals for up to 21 h and assayed for MIP-lp as shown in Figure 15.<br>
Experiment B 3: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated from one individual, resuspended<br>
in RPMI, L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x<br>
106 cells/ml. The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for<br>
15 min at 37°C in 5% C02. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 100 ug/ml.<br>
The cells were cultured for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml.<br>
Cell free culture supernatants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for MIP-lp as shown<br>
in Figure 16(i). A significant reduction in MIP-lp release was seen when dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>
It has been confirmed that dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine 6-sulfate are not mediating their activity by binding to the endotoxin used in<br>
these experiments.<br>
Experiment B 4: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% CO2. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 100 u.g/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% CO2 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free<br>
culture supernatants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for MIP-lp as shown in Figure<br>
16(ii). A significant reduction in MIP-lp release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine was present.<br>
Experiment B 5: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% CO2. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 100 ng/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free<br>
culture supernatants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for MIP-lp as shown in Figure<br>
16(iii). A significant reduction in MIP-lp release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine was present.<br><br>
Experiment B 6: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5%'COa. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 100 ug/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for periods ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 and IPS<br>
was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free culture supematants were harvested 21 h later and<br>
assayed for MIP-lp as shown in Figure 16(iv). A significant reduction in MIP-lp release<br>
was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present at all time points studied.<br>
Experiment B 7: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and then cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% COa. LPS was rnen added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free culture supematants were<br>
harvested at regular intervals for up to 21 h and assayed for TNF-a as shown in Figure 17.<br>
Experiment B 8: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were men plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% CO2. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 100 ug/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free<br>
culture supematants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for MlP-la as shown in Figure<br>
18(i), MIP-lp as shown in Figure 18(ii), IL-8 as shown in Figure 18(iii), TNF-a as shown<br>
in Figure 18(iv), IL-10 as shown in Figure 18(v), and IL-6 as shown in Figure 18(vi). For<br>
all of the chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines studied, a significant reduction in<br>
their release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>
Experiment B 9: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% C02. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 200 jig/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for 30 min at 37°C in 5% C02 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free<br>
culture supematants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for MlP-la as shown in Figure Remove<br><br><br>
19(i), MIP-lp as shown in Figure 19(ii), IL-8 as shown in Figure 19(iii), TNF-a as shown<br>
in Figure 19(iv), IL-lp as shown in Figure 19(v), and IL-6 as shown in Figure 19(vi). For<br>
all of the chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines studied, a significant reduction in<br>
their release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>
Also tested was a dendrimer gen 3.5 construct that had been made in aqueous solution by<br>
reacting the dendrimer gen 3.5 with the EDC linker but then omitting the addition of<br>
glucosamhie or glucosamine sulphate. This dendrimer gen 3.5-EDC construct did not<br>
reduce the release of chemokines (MIP-lp) or TNF-a from peripheral blood mononuclear<br>
cells when they were challenged with lipopolysaccharide at 5 ng/ml. This means that the<br>
reduction in chemokine and cytokine release that was seen with the dendrimer-glucosamine<br>
construct was not due to side reactions of the dendrimer itself with the EDC linker group.<br>
In further experiments, me dendrimer gen 3.5 that was conjugated to glucosamine using<br>
DMSO as the reaction solvent was also evaluated. This dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
construct did not reduce me release of chemokines (MIP-lp) or cytokines (TNF-a) from<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells when they were challenged with lipopolysaccharide at 5<br>
ng/ml. Therefore, the synthesis of the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine in an aqueous<br>
solution was an important component of the process for making biologically active<br>
molecules.<br>
Experiment B 10: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture pjates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% CO2. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 200 ng/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% C02 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell free<br>
culture supernatants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for MIP-lp as shown in Figure<br>
20(i) and TNF-a as shown in Figure 20(ii). For all of the chemokines and pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokines studied, a significant reduction in their release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine was present.<br>
Experiment B 11: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% CO2. LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml and the cells were cultured for 30 min, or 1<br>
hour, or 2 hours, or 3 hours, or 4 hours at 37°C in 5% COa before adding dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine at 100 ug/ml. Cell free culture supernatants were harvested 21 h after the<br>
addition of the LPS and assayed for MlP-la as shown in Figure 21(i), MIP-lp as shown in<br>
Figure 21(ii), IL-8 as shown in Figure 21(iii), TNF-a as shown in Figure 21(iv), IL-lp as<br>
shown in Figure 21(v), and IL-6 as shown in Figure 21(vi). For all of the chemoldnes and<br>
pro-inflammatory cytokines studied, a significant reduction in their release was seen when<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>
Experiment B 12: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% COa. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine in which the loading of glucosamine on<br>
the generation 3.5 dendrimer was 3 % (rather than the 7 % loading used hi all the other<br>
experiments described) was then added at a concentration of 150 ng/ml or 300 fig/ml. The<br>
cells were cultured for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 and LPS was then added at 5 ng/ml. Cell<br>
free culture supernatants were harvested 22 h later and assayed for MIP-lp as shown in<br>
Figure 22(i), or for TNF-a as shown in Figure 22(ii). For all of the chemokines and proinflammatory<br>
cytokines studied, a significant reduction in their release was seen when<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>
EXAMPLES C - EXPERIMENTS WITH THE MIXING OF HUMAN CELLS<br>
FROM DIFFERENT DONORS;<br>
The effect of the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate on the release of<br>
chemokines and, in turn, cytokines after the mixing of human PBMN cells from<br>
several donors;<br>
Experiment C 13: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated from 3 individuals and the cell<br>
density adjusted to 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cells from all 3 donors were then mixed together for<br>
72 h in a 12-well tissue culture plate. The dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at<br>
50 |ig/ml. Cell free culture supernatants were harvested 1 day, 3 days and 4 days later and<br>
assayed for MIP-lp and TNF-a. A significant reduction in MIP-lp and TNF-a release into<br>
he culture supernatant was seen at all 3 time points assayed as shown in Figure 23(i) and<br>
Z3 (ii) respectively.<br>
Experiment C 14: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated from 2 individuals and the cell<br>
density adjusted to 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cells were cultured separately for 24 h and then mixed<br>
together for 72 h in a 12-well tissue culture plate. The dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was<br>
then added at 50 ng/ml. Cell free culture supematants were harvested 1 day, 3 days and 4<br>
days later and assayed for MIP-lp. A significant reduction in MIP-1(} release into the<br>
culture supernatant was seen at all 3 time points assayed as shown in Figure 23(iii).<br>
Experiment C 15: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated from 2 individuals and the cell<br>
density adjusted to 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cells were mixed together and dendrinier gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine added at 100 ng/ml. LPS was added immediately afterwards at 10 ng/ml and<br>
cell free culture supematants harvested at regular intervals for up to 48 h. A significant<br>
reduction in MIP-lp release into the culture supernatant was seen from 24 h onwards as<br>
shown in Figure 24(i).<br>
Experiment C 16: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated from 2 individuals and the cell<br>
density adjusted to 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cells were mixed together and dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine added at 100 ng/ml. LPS was added 24 hours later at a concentration of 5<br>
ng/ml. Cell free culture supernatants were harvested at regular intervals for up to 96 h. A<br>
significant reduction in MIP-lp release into the culture supernatant was seen from 24 h<br>
onwards as shown in Figure 24(ii).<br>
EXAMPLES D ; CYTOKINE AND CHEMOKINE ASSAYS ;<br>
Ouantitation of MIP-1B and other chemokines and cvtokines in tissue culture<br>
supernatants;<br>
Levels of MIP-16 were measured in cell free culture supernatants using a commercially<br>
available enzyme immune-assay (EIA; Quantikine, R&amp;D Systems). Dendrimers gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine conjugates were first confirmed not to interfere with the assay by mixing rhMIP-<br>
16 at a final concentration of 125 pg/ml with the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate at<br>
a final concentration of 200 ug/ml hi growth medium. The solutions were incubated for 4 h at<br>
37°C and then run as samples in the EIA. There was no interference of the dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine with the MDP-lp assay (Table 4a).<br>
Ihere was no interference of the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine with the MlP-la, DL-8,<br>
[L-lfi and EL-6 assays (Table 4a). In the case of TNF-ct a low level interference was seen<br>
and this has been corrected for in the results shown in the figures (Table 4b).<br>
EXAMPLES E ; OTHER BIOLOGICAL DATA;<br>
Examples El; Preliminary animal toxicology:<br>
Anionic dendrimers gen. 3.5 are not toxic to mice at 90 mg/kg. Four Wistar rats were injected<br>
intravenously with dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine at a concentration of 30 mg/kg. This is<br>
equivalent to 6 mg/200g rat. All animals were healthy at 24 h. They were then killed and<br>
examined. No gross pathology was seen in any of the organs.<br>
Examples E 2; Anticoagulant activity;<br>
The anticoagulant activity of each compound (ie: dendrimer gen 3.5, dendrimer gen 3.5<br>
glucosamine, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate, dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
3,6-disulfate, and dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate) was determined using the<br>
following in vitro assays:- kaolin partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin<br>
time and a Factor Xa assay. No anticoagulant activity was seen at the maximum<br>
concentration of 200 /ig/ml that was analysed for all of the compounds tested. For<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine, this was also confirmed at a concentration of 300 fig/ml.<br>

been made which has biological activity but no anticoagulant activity.<br>

vhen present at a concentration of up to 150 u,g/ml in cultures maintained for up to 5 days.<br>
Dell viability was determined by Trypan blue exclusion and an MTT assay. Furthermore,<br>

Examples F 2; The effect of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate on the release of<br>
chemokines and cytokines by LPS from single donor human PBMN cells;<br>
Single donor PBMN cells were isolated, resuspended in RPMI, L-glutamine, penicillin,<br>
streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cells were then<br>
plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at 37°C in 5% COj.<br>
Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate was then added at 150 ug/ml or at 200 ug/ml. The<br>
cells were cultured for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 and LPS (5 ng/ml) added. Cell free culture<br>
supernatants were harvested 24 h later and assayed for MIP-lp as shown in Figure 28(i). A<br>
significant reduction in MIP-lj} release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-<br>
sulfate was present.<br>
Cell free culture supernatants were also harvested and assayed for TNF-a as shown in<br>

Examples F 3; The effect of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate on the release of<br>
chemokines and cvtokines after the mixing of human MDMs from four donors;<br>
Single donor PBMC cells were isolated from 4 individuals by density gradient<br>
centrifugation and then mixed together for 24 h. The cells were re-suspended in growth<br>
medium (RPMI 1640, 20 mM L-glutamine, penicillin [250 lU/ml], streptomycin [250<br>
Ug/ml] and 10 % human serum) and the cell density adjusted to 2 x 106 cells/ml. To separate<br>
MDMs, the cells were plated in a plastic dish for 2 h and the MDMs then scraped, washed,<br>
and resuspended in growth medium. They were then re-plated at a density of IxlO6 cells/ml<br>
and left in culture for 72 hours before adding either dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine or<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate at a concentration of 25 fig/ml. Cell free culture<br>

Examples F 4; Endothelial microtubule formation assay to determine the antiangiogenic<br>
activity of compounds;<br>
Kubota et al. reported that human umbilical vein endothelial cells undergo morphological<br>
differentiation with tube formation when cultured on a reconstituted gel composed of<br>
basement membrane proteins (Matrigel; Beckton-Dickinson) (Kubota, Y., H.K. Kleinman,<br>
G.R. Martin, and T.J. Lawley. 1988. Role of laminin and basement membrane in the<br>
morphological differentiation of human endothelial cells into capillary-like structures. J.<br>
Cell. Biol. 107: 1589-1598). This has parallels with the in vivo situation where endothelial<br>
cells line the lumen of blood vessels and are in contact with the extracellular matrix of<br>
basement membranes that are composed of collagen IV, heparan sulphate proteoglycan and<br>
the glycoproteins laminin and nidogen/entactin.<br>
Due to the ability of basement membranes to stimulate differentiation, cells plated onto the<br>
gel attach rapidly. Within one to two hours, elongated processes are observed. After eight<br>
hours, the endothelial cell cultures show abundant networks of branching and anastomosing<br>
of cords of cells. By eighteen hours, the endothelial cells have formed an interconnected<br>
network of anastomosing cells which, by low power light microscopy, have a honeycomb<br>
appearance. The tube like structures formed by endothelial cells on Matrigel persist for<br>
several days. The formation of the tube structures is not dependent on extracellular growth<br>
factors or the presence of heparin in the culture media. Tube formation also seems to be<br>
relatively specific for endothelial cells because neither human dermal fibroblasts nor human<br>
smooth muscle cells form tubes when cultured on Matrigel.<br>
Ultrastructural EM studies have confirmed that the anastomosing cytoplasmic extensions of<br>
the morphologically differentiated endothelial cells contain a lumen that is completely<br>
encircled by one or two endothelial cells in cross section. The lumen contains various<br>
amounts of degenerated cytoplasm, suggesting that very rapid remodelling of the cell takes<br>
place during tube formation. Viability studies of endothelial cells cultured on Matrigel do<br>
not indicate that cell death plays an important role in tube formation. Moreover, these<br>
differentiated cells retain the characteristic Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells.<br><br>
The endothelial microtubule formation assay was performed by isolating human umbilical<br>
vein endothelial cells from umbilical cords within 6 h of delivery by caesarean section. The<br>
umbilical vein was cannulated and 0.1% collagenase in phosphate buffered saline was<br>
introduced and incubated for 20 minutes. The endothelial cells liberated by the coUagenase<br>
were obtained by washing the umbilical vein with Medium 199. The cells were washed<br>
three tunes with Medium 199 and then cultured in tissue culture flasks coated with<br>
fibronectin. Growth media consisted of Medium 199 with 20% foetal bovine serum, 30<br>
|ig/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 10 lU/ml heparin, 100 lU/ml penicillin, 100<br>
jig/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were<br>
passaged at confluence after treatment with trypsin-EDTA. All cells were used at passages<br>
3 to 6.<br>
Aliquots of Matrigel were dispensed into 35 mm diameter tissue culture dishes on ice and<br>
then incubated at 37°C for 10 min to allow the gel to set. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine<br>
6-sulfate was prepared in HUVEC growth medium and added to the dishes at several<br>
different concentrations. HUVEC's at passage 3 to 6 were harvested using trypsin and<br>
suspended in growth medium at a density of 2 - 3 xlO5 cells/ml. One ml aliquots of the cell<br>
suspension were added to the plates containing the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-<br>
sulfate and incubated at 37°C, 5% COi. At various time points from 8-24 hours, the plates<br>
were examined and scored using a published scheme from 0-4, where 0 = all adherent<br>
cells remain single, and 4 = all adherent cells involved in tubular structures. New vessel<br>
formation was quantified blind by three different observers at 18 h. The within-observer<br>
and between-observer variability was 
photographs of the assay in Figures 30 to 32. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate<br>
significantly reduced the level of tube formation at 12 jig/ml and abolished it completely at<br>
75 |ig/ml to 100 jig/ml.<br>
The in vitro model of migration and microvessel formation used for testing dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate fulfilled the two hallmarks of angiogenesis; ie: endothelial cell<br>
proliferation and capillary sprouting. Our in vitro observations show that dendrimer gen<br>
3.5-glueosamine 6-sulfate inhibits new vessel formation by normal endothelial cells and<br>
that this prevents new blood vessel formation; ie: angiogenesis.<br>
35<br>
Examples F 5: In vitro angioeenesis assay;<br>
Blood vessels (approximately 1-2 mm diameter) were excised from the apical surface of<br>
human placentas within 6 h of an elective Caesarian birth. The use of the placentas was<br>
approved by the Ethics Committee of Hammersmith Hospitals Trust, London. The blood<br>
vessels were placed in Hank's balanced salt solution and cut into 1-2 mm fragments using<br>
fine dissecting forceps and iridectomy scissors. Residual clots were removed and the blood<br>
vessels then soaked in Hank's balanced salt solution.<br>
The effect of each compound on new blood vessel formation was determined by culturing<br>
the blood vessels within a fibrin clot in 24-well tissue culture plates. Thirty |jJ of bovine<br>
thrombin (50 NIH U/ml in 0.15 M sodium chloride) was added to each well followed by 1<br>
ml/well of 3 mg/ml bovine fibrinogen in Medium 199. The thrombin and fibrinogen were<br>
rapidly mixed and a blood vessel fragment placed in the centre of the well. Fibrin gel<br>
formation occurred rapidly and left the vessel suspended within the gel. One ml/well of<br>
Medium 199 supplemented with 20% foetal calf serum, 250 lU/ml penicillin and 250 U/ml<br>
streptomycin was then added to each well, e-amino-n-caproic acid was also added (300<br>
Hg/ml) for the first 4 days and twice weekly thereafter (50 ng/ml) in order to prevent<br>
dissolution of the fibrin clot. The vessels were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator<br>
for 25 days with the media being changed twice weekly.<br>
The degree of new vessel formation was quantified blind twice a week by three different<br>
observers using a visual analogue scale in which 0 = no growth, 1 = very little new vessel<br>
formation, 2 = significant new vessel formation and 3 = dense new vessel formation. An<br>
angiogenesis score was derived from the counts undertaken for each well by dividing the<br>
total score by the maximum score possible and then expressing the result as a percentage.<br>
On 2 separate occasions, each compound was tested in quadruplicate replicate wells.<br>
Experiments in which blood vessels were cultured in MCDB 131 (i.e.: serum free media)<br>
showed that serum factors were not necessary for new blood vessel formation. Some of the<br>
fibrin clots were fixed overnight hi 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned for<br>
histology and then stained for the endothelial cell markers Factor VTfl and CD31.<br>
Over the 28 day course of the assay, a complex arcade of microvessels emerged from the<br>
cut section of the blood vessel embedded within a fibrin clot. Very little growth of new<br>
vessels was seen from those areas of the vessel which had not been sectioned. The first<br><br>
blood vessels appeared by day 4 and were usually blunt-ended. Over the next 18 days, they<br>
went on to branch and give rise to complex arcades of vessels. Growth was rapid for the<br>
first 2 weeks and then slowed considerably. These new vessels were lined by endothelial<br>
cells as shown by positive immunohistochemistry for Factor VIE and CD31.<br>
In six experiments performed, there was a reduction hi the number of new vessels that were<br>
formed when dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate was present at 25 ng/ml Figure Remove <br>
The inhibition of new vessel formation was more marked and significant (p
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate was present at 50 jig/ml. This effect was first seen<br>
at day 18 with the difference persisting and becoming greater until day 28. The experiment<br>
was terminated on day 32.<br>
EXAMPLE G; MODEL SYSTEM FOR A MIXED LYMPHOCYTE REACTION;<br>
The present invention also provides a model system for the mixed lymphocyte reaction that<br>
can be used to evaluate compounds that inhibit the complex process of allograft organ<br>
rejection. The results from these experiments are shown in Figure 23 (i), Figure 23 (ii),<br>
Figure 23 (iii), Figure 24 (i), and Figure 24 (ii). Using our experimental model system, we<br>
have evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine and by<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate. Our results show that the mixed lymphocyte<br>
reaction can be successfully inhibited by dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine as well as by<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate, and that they could therefore be of therapeutic<br>
use in preventing the inflammatory response seen when rejection of a syngeneic,<br>
autologous, allogeneic or or xenogenic organ transplant occurs. It may also be effective hi<br>
maintaining the counter inflammatory environment that is required to prevent the rejection<br>
of the transplanted organ, as well as the development of graft-versus-host disease.<br>
The mixed lymphocyte reaction can be used to test the responsiveness of recipient<br>
lymphocytes to antigens expressed on donor cells. Low recipient anti-donor mixed<br>
lymphocyte reaction responses are associated with excellent transplant survival. The test is<br>
especially important in bone marrow transplantation, because it also assesses whether the<br>
donor bone marrow cells can respond to recipient antigens and cause graft-versus-host<br>
disease.<br>
EXAMPLE H; THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF DENDRIMER GEN 3.5<br>
GLUCQSAMINE ON CELLS OF DENDRITIC CELL ORIGIN ;<br>
Immature monocyte derived dendritic cells were prepared as follows. Freshly isolated<br>
PBMN cells from a single donor were obtained and the monocytes isolated by adhesion to<br>
gelatin coated flasks for 1 hour. The isolated monocytes were cultured for 5 days in RPMI<br>
containing penicillin and streptomycin and L-glutamine and 10% autologous heat<br>
inactivated human serum with rnterleukin-4 (1,000 lU/ml) and GM-CSF (150 lU/ml).<br>
These cells were confirmed to be immature monocyte derived dendritic cells because of the<br>
following phenotype on FACS analysis: CD3-, CD4-, CD14-, CD16-, CD25-, CD80-,<br>
CD83- and HLA-DR+. Tissue derived, human peritoneal dendritic cells were isolated using<br>
the Milteny Biotech CDlc isolation kit. These cells were confirmed to be immature tissue<br>
derived dendritic cells because of the following phenotype on FACS analysis: CD3-, CD4-,<br>
CD14-, CD16-, CD25-, CD80-, CD83- and HLA-DR+. The blood- or tissue- derived<br>
human dendritic cells (i.e stimulator cells) were then irradiated to prevent their proliferation<br>
by exposing them to 30 Gy y irradiation.<br>
For the mixed lymphocyte reaction, responder cells were prepared from single donor<br>
PBMN cells by first allowing them to adhere to plastic for 1.5 hours. The non-adherent<br>
fraction from these PBMN cells is rich in T cells and they were used as the responder cells.<br>
The cells were cultured in RPMI and penicillin and streptomycin and L-glutamine and 10%<br>
heat inactivated human serum. The irradiated stimulator cells were mixed with the<br>
responder lymphocytes. The allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction was incubated at 37°C<br>
for 5 days and it was then pulsed with [3H] thymidine (1 uCu/well) and incubated at 37°C<br>
for another 18 hours. The cells were then harvested and the [3H] thymidine incorporated<br>
measured.<br>
Experiment HI:<br>
Lipopolysaccharide leads to the immunological stimulation of immature dendritic cells.<br>
Monocyte derived dendritic cells were prepared as described and plated at 1 x 105 /well.<br>
Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine (200 ng/ml) was added for 1 hour followed by LPS (5<br>
ng/ml). Cell free culture supematants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for Mff-lp as<br>
shown in Figure 35(i) and for TNF-ct as shown in Figure 35(ii). For the ehemokine and the<br>
cytokine studied, a significant reduction in their release was seen when dendrimer gen 3.5-<br>
glucosamine was present.<br>
38<br>
Experiment H2:<br>
Lipopolysaccharide leads to the maturation of immature dendritic cells as demonstrated by<br>
their increased expression of cell surface CD25, CD80, CD83 and CD86. The ability of<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine to interfere with this LPS induced maturation of dendritic<br>
cells was determined. Immature monocyte derived dendritic cells were prepared as<br>
described and plated at 1 x 106 /well. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine (200 ng/ml) was<br>
added for 1 hour followed by LPS (5 ng/ml). The cells were cultured for 21 hours and then<br>
harvested for FACS analysis. As shown in Figure 36, dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine<br>
significantly reduced LPS induced upregulation of CD25 on the dendritic cells.<br>
Experiment H3:<br>
Co-culture of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes leads to a mixed lymphocyte reaction as<br>
measured by [3H] thymidine uptake. Additional proliferation occurs if lipopolysaccharide<br>
(LPS) is also added. Gamma irradiated purified monocyte derived dendritic cells were<br>
incubated in round-bottomed 96 well culture plates in triplicate in aliquots ranging from<br>
64,000 to 32 dendritic cells/well in RPMI1640 supplemented with 330 pig/ml L-glutamine,<br>
200 RJ/ml penicillin, 200 /xg/ml streptomycin and 10% heat inactivated human serum with<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine (200 fig/ml) for 1 hour at 37°C with 5% CO2. The control<br>
wells contained media only. Allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes (100,000/well) were<br>
then added. Other control wells contained only the peripheral blood lymphocytes. The total<br>
volume per well was 250 u.1. The plates were incubated for 5 days at 37°C with 5% COj.<br>
In addition, prior to adding the peripheral blood lymphocytes, the plates (with and without<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine) were incubated with lipopolysaccharide at a<br>
concentration of 5 ng/ml for 21 hours. The cells were then washed three times. Dendrimer<br>
gen. 3.5 glucosamine was then added back at a concentration of 200 ug/ml. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes were added at 100,000 cells/well and the plates incubated for 5 days at<br>
37°C with 5% CO2. To these cultures, [3H]-Thymidine (1 ^Ci/well) was then added for a<br>
further 18 hours and the cells cultured. After this tune, the cells were harvested and<br>
proliferation measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The counts per minute (cpm) for<br>
the peripheral blood lymphocyte control well were subtracted from the actual cpm of each<br>
experiment in order to determine the mean cpm of [3H]-Thymidine incorporation. Figure 37<br>
shows the results from three experiments. In each case, the proliferation caused by the<br>
mixed lymphocyte reaction as well as the proliferation, caused by LPS at 5 ng/ml was<br>
significantly inhibited.<br>
Experiment H4:<br>

penicillin, 200 jug/ml streptomycin and 10% heat inactivated human serum with dendrimer<br>
gen. 3.5 glucosamine (200 jig/ml) for 1 hour at 37°C with 5% COj. The control wells<br>
contained media only. Allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes (100,000/well) were then<br>
added. Other control wells contained only peripheral blood lymphocytes. The total volume<br>
per well was 250 pi. The plates were incubated for 5 days at 37°C with 5% CQz. In<br>
addition, prior to adding the peripheral blood lymphocytes, the plates (with and without<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine) were incubated with lipopolysaccharide at a<br>
concentration of 20 ng/ml for 21 hours. The cells were then washed three times. Dendrimer<br>
gen. 3.5 glucosamine was then added back at a concentration of 200 pg/ml. Peripheral<br>
blood lymphocytes were added at 100,000 cells/well and the plates incubated for 5 days at<br>
37°C with 5% COa. To these cultures, [3H]-Thymidine (1 p€i/well) was then added for a<br>
further 18 hours and the cells cultured. After this time, the cells were harvested and<br>
proliferation measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The counts per minute (cpm) for<br>

added. Other control wells contained only the peripheral blood lymphocytes. The total<br>

Experiment H7 :<br>
hi this experiment, the effect of dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine on the release of IL-2 and<br>
y-interferon during the mixed lymphocyte reaction in the presence of lipopolysaccharide<br>
was determined. Gamma irradiated purified monocyte derived dendritic cells or gamma<br>
irradiated isolated, purified peritoneal dendritic cells were incubated in round bottomed 96-<br>
well culture plates in duplicate in aliquots ranging from 32,000 to 2,000 dendritic cells/well<br>
in RPMI1640 supplemented with 330 /ig/ml L-glutamine, 200 RJ/ml penicillin, 200 /ig/ml<br>
streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated human serum. Dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine<br>
(200 |j.g/ml) was added for 1 hour at 37°C and 5% CO2. Lipopolysaccharide (20 ng/ml) was<br>
then added for 21 hours. The cells were then washed three times with media and the<br>
dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine (200 jag/ml) replaced. Allogeneic lymphocytes<br>
(100,000/well) were then added and this was defined as day 0. The plates were incubated at<br>
37°C and 5% CO2 and cell free culture superaatants were collected at day 3 and day 5 for<br>
the measurement of interleukin-2 and 'y-interferon (EIA; R&amp;D Systems).<br>
Figure 41(i) shows the results for gamma irradiated purified monocyte derived dendritic<br>
cells, and Figure 41(ii) shows the results for gamma irradiated isolated, purified peritoneal<br>
dendritic cells. With each cell type, the dendrimer gen. 3.5 glucosamine caused a significant<br>
reduction in the release of interleukin-2 and of 7-interferon.<br>
EXAMPLE J; EXPERIMENTS WITH SUPERANTIGEN TOXINS ;<br>
Bacterial superantigens are amongst the most lethal of toxins. Superantigens produced by<br>
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes trigger an excessive cellular immune<br>
response that can lead to lethal toxic shock. The family of superantigens includes<br>
staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA-SEE (among which SEE is most prominent), toxic shock<br>
syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins and SPEA and<br>
SPEC, hi the case of SEB, it can activate 30-40% of T cells to divide and produce<br>
cytokines. Toxicity results from the massive induction of ohemokines and cytokines from<br>
cells of the immune system. The aim of the experiments that are described was to try and<br>
block these lethal effect of the superantigen toxin with dendrimer gen. 3.5-glucosamine at<br>
the beginning of this cascade; i.e. before activation of T cells can take place. The clinical<br>
rationale for doing this is that patients who produce higher levels of inflammatory<br>
cytokines hi response to streptococcal superantigen toxins develop significantly more<br>
severe clinical manifestations of the disease than do patients who produce lower levels of<br>

Experiment Jl: Single donor PBMN cells were isolated and resuspended in RPMI, Lglutamine,<br>
penicillin, streptomycin and 10% human serum at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml<br>
The cells were then plated (1 ml) in 12 well tissue culture plates and cultured for 15 min at<br>
37°C in 5% CO2. Dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was then added at 200 ug/ml. The cells<br>
were cultured for 30 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 and the superantigen SEB was then added at 100<br>
ng/ml. Prior to using the SEB, it was confirmed that the SEB did not contain any LPS using<br>
the limulus assay. Cell free culture supernatants were harvested 21 h later and assayed for<br>
MIP-lp as shown in Figure 42(i) and for TNF-a as shown in Figure 42(ii). For both the<br>
chemokine and the cytokine a significant reduction in their release was seen when<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>

SBB added at 100 ng/ml. Cell free culture supernatants were harvested 21 h later and<br>
assayed for MDMP as shown in Figure 42(i) and for TNF-a as shown in Figure 42(ii). For<br>
both the chemokine and the eytokine a significant reduction in then- release was seen when<br>
dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine was present.<br>
Table 1:<br>
This table shows the reproducibility of the synthesis of the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate with a 7 % loading of glucosamine that<br>
was used for most of the experiments described. Results are also shown for the dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugate with a 3 % loading of<br>
glucosamine that was used for Experiment B 12, Figure 22.<br>
The total amount of glucosamine bound to the dendrimers was determined using a ^-counter (data shown as mean ± SD of 3 replicates). The<br>
unbound glucosamine content was determined using a p-counter followed by gel filtration (PD-10 column) of the purified conjugate.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The amount of sulfated sugar bound to the dendrimer gen 3.5 was determined by sulphur analysis.<br>
'3.5-G6S' stands for dendrimers gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate,<br>
'3.5-G3.6S' stands for dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,6-disulfate,<br>
'3-5-G3,4,6S' stands for dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine 3,4,6-trisulfate.<br>
Toxicity of dendrimers gen 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimers gen 3.5-glucosamine 6-sulfate conjugates in several human cell lines and in a<br>
murine melanoma cell line.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
There was no interference of the dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine with the MEP-la, MIP-lp, IL-lp, IL-6 or IL-8 assays.<br>
Table 4b: Interaction of TNF-a with dendrimers gen 3.5-glucosamine conjugates:<br>
In the case of TNF-a assay, a significant degree of interference by dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine was seen as illustrated below.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
A correction factor has therefore been applied to all of the TNF-a data shown as it relates to dendrimer gen 3.5 glucosamine.<br>
Table 5: Anticoagulant activity of dendrimer gen 3.5-glucosamine and dendrimer gen 3.5-sulfated glucosamioe conjugates:<br>
The compounds were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and tested, or dissolved in RPMI + 15% PCS and tested, or mixed<br>
50 : 50 with human plasma/veronal buffer and tested. The anti-Xa activity was expressed as units of heparin/ml (HEP (Xa) (V/ml)).<br>
