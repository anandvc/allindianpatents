Process  for treating textile materials<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preventing the redeppsition of migrating dyes In wash liquors comprising a peroxide and a manganese catalyst, to manganese catalysts suitable for the process, and to detergent formulations comprising these catalysts.<br>
It is already known that some manganese complexes of the salen type are suitable catalysts for oxidations with peroxygen compounds, especially as part of a washing process. The salen complexes involved are exclusively symmetrical. It has also been described before that certain other manganese complexes possess a pronounced bleaching effect on dirt and dyes in wash liquors.<br>
It has now been found that certain asymmetric manganese complexes of the salen type exhibit a much greater specific action as catalysts for preventing the redisposition of migrating dyes in wash liquors without notably damaging either dye or fibre. Complexes are termed asymmetric when they come about through the reaction of 2 mol of two differently modified salicylaldehydes or o-hydroxyphenyl ketones with 1 mol of ethylenediamine or another modified diamine building block and so possess two differently substituted aromatic radicals.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a process for preventing the redeposition of migrating dyes in a wash liquor, which comprises adding to the wash liquor, which comprises a peroxide-containing detergent, from 0.5 to 150 mg, preferably from 1.5 to 75 mg and, in particular, from 7.5 to 40 mg per litre of wash liquor of one or more compounds of the formula<br><br><br>

The preferred deffnitions indicated above below the manganese compiexes of formula (1) for n, m, Y, A, R. R1. R2 and R3 are also preferred for the compounds of formula (1a).<br>
The compounds of the formula (1) and (1a) are prepared, for example, in a conventional manner from the corresponding ligands and a manganese compound. Preparation processes of this kind are described, for example, in the US Patents 5,281,578 and 4,066,459. All of the manganese complexes mentioned therein, however, have symmetrically substituted ligands. Surprisingly, the manganese complexes of the invention, having asymmetric ligands, feature an enhanced specific action as catalysts for oxidations with peroxides.<br>
The ligands of the formula<br><br>
in which R. R1, R2, R3, Y, n and m are as defined under the formula (la) are likewise novel. They are prepared in a conventional manner by, for example, reacting a diamine of the formula H2N-Y-NH2 first with an aldehyde or ketone of the formula<br><br><br>
In the formulae (3) and (4) R. R1. R2, R3, n and m are as defined under the formula (1). with the proviso that R and Ri do not have the same definition if n and m are identical.<br><br>
It is also possible to employ the compounds of the formula (1) together with con^esponding analogous symmetrical manganese complexes, i.e. with compounds of the formula (1) in which (R)n and (R1)m are identical. Such mixtures are obtained, for example, by reacting a diamine of the formula H2N-Y-NH2 with a mixture of two different compounds of the formula (3) in the above synthesis of the (igands of the formula (2) and converting the resultant mixture comprising one asymmetric and two symmetrical ligands of the formula (2) into the corresponding Mn complexes.<br>
The present invention additionally provides a detergent comprising<br>
I)	5 - 90%. preferably 5 - 70% A) of an anionic surfactant and/or B) of a nonionic surfactant,<br>
II)	5 - 70%. preferably 5 • 50% and. in particular. 5 - 40% C) of a builder substance,<br>
III)	0.1 - 30%, preferably 1-12% D) of a peroxide, and<br><br>
IV) 0.005 - 2%, preferably 0.02 -1% and, in particular, 0.1 - 0.5% E) of a compound of the above-defined formula (1), where the percentages are in each case by weight based on the overall weight of the detergent.<br>
The detergent can be in solid or liquid form as, for example, a nonaqueous liquid detergent comprising not more than 5 and preferably from 0 to 1% by weight of water and as its base may have a suspension of a builder substance in a nonionic surfactant, as described, for example, in GB-A-2,158,454.<br>
Preferably, however, the detergent is in powder or granule form.<br>
This detergent can be prepared, for example, by first preparing an initial powder by spray-drying an aqueous slurry comprising all of the above-mentioned components with the exception of D) and E) and then adding the dry components D) and E) and mixing all of the components with one another.<br>
Alternatively, component E) can be added to an aqueous slurry comprising components A),<br>
B)	and C) which is then spray-dried, after which component D) can be mixed with the dry<br>
mass.<br>
Yet another option is to start from an aqueous slurry which comprises components A) and<br>
C)	but not, or not all of, component B). The slurry is spray-dried, then component E) is<br>
mixed with component B) and added, and, subsequently, component D) is admixed in dry<br>
form.<br>
The anionic surfactant A) can be, for example, a sulfate, sulfonate or carboxylate surfactant or a mixture thereof.<br>
Preferred sulfates are those with 12 - 22 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, alone or in combination with alkyl ethoxy-sulfates whose alkyl radical has 10 - 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred sulfonates are, for example, alkylbenzenesulfonates with 9-15 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical.<br><br>
The cation in the anionic surfactants is preferably an alkali metal cation, especially lodlum.<br>
Prefen-ed carboxylates are alkali metal sarcosinates of the formula R-CO-N(R V CH2C00M\ in which R is alkyl or alkenyl with 8 -18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkenyl radical, R^ is Ci-C4alkyl and M^ is an alkali metal.<br>
The nonionic surfactant B) can be. for example, a condensation product of 3-8 mol of ethylene oxide with 1 mol of primary alcohol having 9-15 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of suitable builder substances C) are alkali metal phosphates, espepially tripolyphosphates. carbonates or bicarbonates. especially their sodium salts, silicates, aluminium silicates, polycarboxylates, polycarboxylic acids, organic phosphonates, aminoalkylenepoly(alkylenephosphonates). or mixtures of these compounds.<br>
Particularly suitable silicates are sodium salts of crystalline phyllosilicates of the formula NaHSitO2t4i.pHO or Na2SitO2t+i.pH2O, in which t is a number between 1.9 and 4 and p is a number between 0 and 20,<br>
Of the aluminium silicates, preference is given to those obtainable commercially under the names zeolite A. B. X and HS and to mixtures comprising two or more of these components.<br>
Among the polycarboxylates, preference is given to the polyhydroxycarboxylates, especially citrates, and acrylates and also their copolymers with maleic anhydride.<br>
Prefen'ed polycarboxylic acids are nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and ethylenediaminedisuccinate, both in racemic form and in the enantiomerically pure S,S form.<br>
Particularly suitable phosphonates or aminoalkylenepoly(alkylenephosphonates) are alkali metal salts of 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid, nitrilotris(methylenephosphonic acid), ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid and diethylenetriamlne-, pentamethylenephosphonic acid.<br><br>
Suitable peroxide components D) are, for example, the literature-referenced and commercially available organic and inorganic peroxides which bleach textile materials at<br>
customary washing temperatures: for example, at from 10 to 95oC.<br>
r<br>
The organic peroxides are, for example, mono- or polyperoxides, especially organic peracids or their salts, such as phthalimidoperoxycaproic acid, peroxybenzoic acid, diperoxydodecanedioic acid, diperoxynonanedioic acid, diperoxydecanedioc acid, diperoxyphthalic acid, or salts thereof.<br>
It is preferred, however, to use inorganic peroxides, examples being persulfates, perborates, percarbonates and persilicates. It is of course also possible to use mixtures of inorganic and/or organic peroxides. The peroxides can be present in different crystal forms and with varying water content and may also be employed together with other organic or inorganic compounds in order to enhance their stability on storage.<br>
Addition of the peroxides to the detergent takes place preferably by mixing the components with the aid, for example, of a screw metering system and/or a fluidized-bed mixer.<br>
In addition to the combination of the invention the detergents may comprise one or more fluorescent whitening agents from the classes, for example, of bistriazinyiaminostilbene-disulfonic acid, bistnazolyistiibenedisulfonic acid, bisstyrylbiphenyl or bisbenzofurylbiphenyl, or a bisbenzoxallyl derivative, bisbenzimidazolyl derivative, coumarin derivative or pyrazoline derivative.<br>
In addition, the detergents may comprise soil antiredeposition agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, pH regulators, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal silicates, foam regulators, such as soap, salts for regulating spray drying and granulating properties, such as sodium sulfate, fragrances and, if desired, antistats and fabric softeners, enzymes, such as amylase, bleaches, pigments and/or shading agents. These constituents must of course be stable to the bleach that is employed.<br>
Further preferred additions to the detergents of the invention are polymers which prevent stains due, when washing textiles, to dyes in the wash liquor that have become detached<br><br>
from the textiles under washing conditions. These are preferably polyvinylpynrrolidones, unmodified or modified by incorporation of anionic or cationic substituents, and especially those having a molecular weight in the range from 5000 to 60,000, in particular from 10,000 to 50,000. These polymers are employed preferably in an amount from 0.05 to 5% by weight, in particular from 0.2 to 1.7% by weight, based on the overall weight of the detergent.<br>
In addition, the detergents of the invention may also include what are known as perborate activators, such as TAED or TAGU, for example. Preference is given to TAED. which is employed preferably in an amount from 0.05 to 5% by weight, in particular from 0.2 to 1.7% by weight, based on the overall weight of the detergent.<br>
The examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention without restricting it to them. Parts and percentages are by weight unless specified otherwise.<br><br>

Example 33: To investigate the effectiveness of the catalysts, the DTI efficacy is measured. The DTI (Dye transfer Inhibition) efficacy a is defined as the following percentage:<br>
a - (tY(E) - Y(A)] / [Y(W) - Y{A)]) ♦ 100<br>
where Y(W). Y(A) and Y(E) are the CIE lightnesses of the white material, of the material treated without added catalyst and of the material treated with added catalyst, in that order. a=0 characterizes a completely useless product whose addition to the washing liquor gives free rein to dye transfer. a=00%, on the other hand, corresponds to a perfect catalyst which completely suppresses the staining of the white material.<br>
The test data are determined using the following test system: 7.5 g of white cotton fabric are treated In 80 ml of washing liquor. This liquor contains the standard detergent ECE phosphate-free (456 lEC) EMPA, Switzerland, In a concentration of 7.5 g/l, 8.6 mmol /1H2O2 and a solution of the test dye. The washing process takes place in a cup In a LINITEST apparatus at 40*C for 30 minutes. In this test the catalysts are employed as per standard in the stated concentrations.<br>
The following commercially obtainable dyes are employed as test dyes:<br>
Dye 1	(F1)	Direct Brown 172<br>
Dye 4	(F4)	Reactive Blue 238<br>
Dye 6	(F6)	Reactive Black 5<br>
Dye 8	(F8)	Direct Blue 71<br>
Dye 9	(F9)	Direct Black 22<br>
Dye 10	(F10)	Anionic Blue 113<br><br>
Dye 13	F(13)	Disperse Violet 1<br>
Dye 14	(F14)	Reactive Blue 19<br>
The reflection spectra of the samples were measured with a SPECTRAFLASH 2000 and converted into lightnesses (D65/10) by a standard procedure in accordance with CIE.<br>
The following table shows the results with the catalyst obtained according to Example 24 (Mn complex). It shows the DTI effects (a) as a function of catalyst concentration under service conditions as described above.<br><br>
The following table shows that the catalyst obtained in accordance with Example 24 very effectively prevents the redeposition of dyes of various classes. The values indicated here relate to a catalyst concentration of 50 pmol/l and experimental conditions as described above.<br><br><br><br>
The catalyst has the further feature that even at a service temperature of only 20°C  the great majority of the protective effect observed at 40°C is retained.<br><br>
The catalyst features an acceptable balance of damage relative to coloured laundry. In terms of dye damage, even when using dyes known to be highly sensitive, the degradation is only of the same order of magnitude as observed with the TAED-activated bleaching system. In the sector of oxygen bleaches, the latter Is considered prior art with an acceptable damage/benefit balance. When used as described above, the following percentage dye loss is found after fivefold treatment.<br>
1<br><br><br>
In terms of fibre damage on dyed materials, the catalyst exhibits a better balance than the<br>
&gt;<br>
quoted TAED system. When used as described above, the following relative DP lowering Is found after fivefold treatment.<br><br>
Conducting DTI screening with the following isolated ligands, which were converted Into the manganese complexes immediately before the screening by the an in situ process, gives the results shown In Table 6.<br><br><br>
Table 7 shows the results obtained when DTI screening is conducted with the isolated Mn complexes.<br><br><br>
The asymmetric salen complexes described exhibit an excellent action even at reduced peroxide concentration. If the concentration of peroxide is reduced from 8.6 mM to 0.17 mM, then the DTI effect is fully retained. Table 8 below shows the effect of the metal complex from Example 20 with a reduced amount of peroxide.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
