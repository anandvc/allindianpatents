PYRIDO(2,1-A)ISOQUINOLINE  DERIVATIVES  AS  DPP-IV  INHIBITORS<br>
Novel Pyrido[2J-a1isoquinQline Derivatives<br>
The present invention is concerned with novel pyrido [2,l-a] isoquinoline derivatives, their manufacture and their use as medicaments. In particular, the invention relates to compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
R’   is lower alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or lower alkyl substituted by cycloalkyl, by’ aryl or by heteroaryl;<br>
R’, R’ and R’     are each independently hydrogen,, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyi, lower alkoxy)  or lower alkenyl, wherein lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and lower alkenyl may optionally be substituted by lower alkoxycarbonyl, aryl or heterocyclyl;<br>
R    is hydrogen, fluorine, lower alkyl, or aryl;<br>
R    is hydrogen, lower alkyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl, or<br>
R’ and R’   together with the carbon atoms to which they.are attached form a five or six membered saturated carbocyclic ring;<br>

The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC.3.4.14.5, abbreviated in the following as DPP-IV) is involved in the regulation of the activities of several hormones. In particular DPP-IV is degrading efficiently and rapidly glucagons like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is one of the most potent stimulator of insulin production and secretion. Inhibiting DPP-IV would potentiate the effect of endogenous GLP-l, and lead to higher plasma insulin concentrations. In patients suffering from impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, higher plasma insulin concentration would moderate the dangerous hyperglycaemia and accordingly reduce the risk of tissue damage. Consequently, DPP-IV inhibitors have been suggested as drug candidates for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes emeritus (e.g. Villagers, W098/1999S). Without disclosing any medical use, Buzas et al., Lab. Chime. Org. V, Fac. Sci., Orleans, Fr. Chim. Ther. (1992), 7(5), 404-7 describe synthesis of the compounds of Examples 41 and 42 below.<br>
We have found novel DPP-IV inhibitors that very efficiently lower plasma glucose levels. Consequently, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and/or impaired glucose tolerance, as well as other conditions wherein the ampUfication of action of a peptide normally inactivated by DPP-IV gives a therapeutic benefit. Surprisingly, the compounds of the present invention can also be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of Bowl disease. Colitis Ulcerous, Morbus Crown, obesity and/or metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be used as diuretic agents and for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of hypertension. Unexpectedly, the compounds of the present invention exhibit improved therapeutic and T’harmacological ‘properties compared to other DPP-IV inhibitors known in the art, such as e.g. in context with pharmacokinetic and bioavailability.<br>

The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols’ polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and<br><br>
cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially about 1 to 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br><br>
