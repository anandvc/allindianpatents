				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the extraction of betacyanm dye from the flowers of Celosia argentea var cnstata.<br>
Celosm a herb, grows widely or cultivated is distributed throughout the tropical and temperate regions of India, Africa and America. Four species are recorded in India. One of the species of Celosm variety cnstata locally known as lalmurghka, a showy<br>
plant often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as an escape in the<br>
plains and upto a height of 5000 ft. on the Himalayas. The plant is often eaten as a<br>
pot herb. The plant yields betacyanm a nitrogen containing anthocyanin. The flowers are astringent and are used in diarrhoea. The seeds are demulcent and useful in painful micturition cough and dysentery.<br>
Color is an important constituent of food and phauuaceuticals as every food is associated with a certain type of color. Color preferences vary with populations and are influenced by geographical , sociological and cultural aspects. Since color is seen by the eye much before the flavour and texture of food are felt our initial response on acceptance or rejection of food is influenced by how the food looks like rather thpm how it tastes like. Color is necessary to give food attracting and appetising appearance. Colors are used to replace the inherent natural color destroyed during processing to ensure batch to batch unifomiity and for decorative purposes. Red violet pigments called betacyanins (foimely known as nitrogenous anthocyapnis occur in many plants of the order centrospermea).like betanidin, the aglycone of red<br>
violet pigment betanin isolated originally from Beta vulgans. A violet red dye, which is an extiact of the flowers of Celosia cnstata, can be used in food stuffs like other betacyanins, as this plant is eaten as pot herb. Betacyamn is the major component in Celosia cnstata flowers responsible for violet red colour.<br>
The known process for the extraction of dye related compounds for academic purposes are.:<br>
L.Minalf et al isolated and identified celosianin and isocelosianin (both are C-15<br>
diastereomers), and by alkaline hydrolysis of the celosianin isocelosianin mixture<br>
give a deacylated product which was identified as a mixture of amanmtm and isoamarantin ( L.Minalf, M.Piattelli, De stefano and R.A.Nicolaus. Phytochemistry 1996,(5) 1037-1052).<br>
In another method Mario Piattelli and L.Minale used the fresh plant material ground 4-6 vol. of cold water in a waring blender. The homogenate was heated at 70° C for 5 mm. and filtered through several layers of cheese - cloth The extraction was repeated until no more colour was obtained. The combined extiacts were adjusted to pH-3 by the addition of N- HC1 and centrifuged and seperated by column Dowex-<br>
50W-X2 f M. Piattelli and L.Minale. Phvtochemistry. 1964. (3}. 547-557 1.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
process for the extraction of betacyanin dye from the Celosia cnstata flowers.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a quick, efficient and economical process better than previously reported methods for the extraction of betacyanm dye.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the extraction of betacyanm dye from the flowers of Celosia argentea var cristata belonging to the family Amaranthacea, which comprises extracting the shade<br>
dried and choppec flow.ers with wgter   or  with a mixture of water and<br>
polar solvent in a ratio ranging from 1.1 to 1:3 at least two times, followed<br>
by mixing both the filtrates, removing the solvent under vacuum at a temperature ranging between 60 - 70°C and at a pressure ranging between 60 - 70 cm of Hg to obtain betacyanin dye with the total dry mass of the dye being in the range of 1 5 - 22% on dry weight basis.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the polar solvent;- used may be selected from methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol.<br>
In  another embodiment of the  present  invention  the  stability of the betacyanin dye obtained may be for a period of atleast one year.<br>
The invention is further illustrated with the help of following examples and should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention<br>
Example - 1 (Comparative Example)<br>
100g of Celosia cristata shade dried flowers were chopped into small pieces and extracted with water twice 500 ml and 400 mi for 12 and 8 hours respectively , filtered through a cheese cloth and both the filterates were mixed and concentrated<br>
in a rotavapour under vacuum (60-70 cm of Hg j at a temperature 70-80° C till the solvent was recovered. The weight of solvent free extract (betacyanin dye ) was 18g ( yield 18% on dry weight basis ) but the color of the extract (dye) diminished.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
lOOg of Celosm cnstata flowers were shade dried, chopped into small pieces and<br>
extracted twice with polar solvents 600 and 500 ml selected among mixture of water<br>
and alcohol in a ratio 1:1 ( ethyl alcohol 	to give 1 litre of<br>
extract. The extiact is filtered and then concentrated in a rotavapour under vacuum (70-80 cm of Hg) at a temperature (60-70° C) till the extract was made free of solvent having weight 22 g (22% on dry weight basis ). The dye (extract) thus obtained was stored and the color was stable for a period of 1 year after checking it with color index.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
lOOg of Celosia cnstata shade dried flowers were chopped into small pieces and extracted twice with a mixture of methanol and water ( in a ratio of 7.3) 600 ml and 500 ml for 12 and 8 hrs respectively. The extract was filtered and concentrated in a rotavapour under vacuum (60-70 cm. of Hg) at a temp. 60-70°C The weight of extract (betacyanin dye ) was 19g ( 19% on dry weight basis) after completely removing the traces of solvent . The dye thus obtained was stable for a period of one year<br>
Example 4<br>
100g of Celosia cnstata shade dried flowers were chopped into small pieces and extracted with water twice 500 and 400 ml for 12 and 8 hours respectively, filtlered. Both filterates were mixed and concentrated in a rotavapour under vacuum (60 - 70 cm of Hg) at a temperature 60-70°C . The solvent free extract (betacyanm dye ) was 18.5g (18.5% on dry weight basis). The dye thus obtained was stable for a period of one year ADVANTAGES<br>
The improved process of the present invention has following aadvantages over reported procedures;<br>
1	In the previously reported methods the extraction was done with cold<br>
water then made acidic with strong acid. We use non acidic media during<br>
extraction in which we get original shade of color which is changed in the<br>
acidic medium.<br>
2.        We have reduced the numbers of extraction    The full extraction of   dye<br>
from the flowers comes out in two extraction 3         A bright and stable colour at room temperature was achieved without<br>
using costly and toxic solvents.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the use of non toxic solvents such as water and methyl/ ethyl alcohol for the extraction of dye. The procedure is simple and cheaper than reported methods and provides bright and stable colour at room temperature.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An improved process for the extraction of betacyanin dye from the flowers of Celosie argentea var. cristata belonging to the family Amaranthacea, which comprises extracting the shade dried and chopped; flowers with<br>
water     or with a mixture of water and polar solvent in a<br>
ratio ranging from 1:1 to 1:3 at least two times, followed by mixing both the filtrates, removing thesolvent under vacuum at a temperature ranging between 00 - 70°C and at a pressure ranging between 60 - 70 cm of Hg to obtain betacyanin dye with the total dry mass of the dye being in the range of 15 - 22% on dry weight basis.<br>
2.       An improved process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the polar solvent used is selected from ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol.<br>
4. An improved process for the extraction of betacyanin dye from flowers of Celosia argentea var. cristata substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
