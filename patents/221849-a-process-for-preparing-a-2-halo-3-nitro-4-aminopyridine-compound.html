As shown in Scheme I, the preparation of N6-substituted adenosine derivatives of formula (I), begins with the reaction of the 2,4-dihalo-3-nitropyridine compound (11) with an amine of formula HjN-X-(Y),-Z (III) provides the 2-halo-3-nitro-4-aminopyridiTie compound (IV). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a tertiary amine or aromatic amine base such as triethylamine, diisopropyiethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine. 4-methylmorpholine, and the like or an inorganic carbonate base such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and the like. Preferred bases are 4-methylmorpholine, triethylamine and diisopropyiethylamine.  The reaction is carried out in a polar aprotic solvent such as l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or dimethylformamide, an aromatic solvent such as benzene or toluene, a higher-boiling ethereal solvent such as diglyme or a hindered alcohol such as isopropanol or 2-butanoi at a temperature of from about ambient temperatxire to the reflux temperature of the solvent.. A preferred solvent is I -methyl-2-pyrroiidone, in which the reaction is carried out at about 35 °C.<br>
The 2-halo-3-nitro-4-aminopyridine compound (IV) is then reacted with the protected dihydroxyaminocyctopentane compound (V) using the reaction conditions described above to prepare the 2,4-diamino-3-nitropyridine compound (VI).<br>
Reduction of the 2,4-diamino-3-nitropyridine compound (VI) to the 2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (Vll) is accomplished using methods well known in the art for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds. Preferred methods for the reduction employ metals such as zinc, iron or tin in the presence of an acidic proton source such as ammonium acetate. Solvents are generally alcohols, preferably methanol or mixtures of alcohols and aromatic solvents such as toluene or benzene. The reduction is preferably accomplished at about ambient temperature. The nitro group is also reduced by catalytic hydrogenation, with platinum catalysts such as PtO, being preferred.<br>
The groups R7 and R, are then removed using methods well known in the art to fonn the 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (Vlll). In a preferred aspect of this process, R7 and<br><br>
R, together form a dimethylacetonide, in which case the acetonide is hydrolyzed with acid using any solvent which is stable to the acid. A preferred method of acetonide hydrolysis uses HCI and methanol at about ambient temperature. The 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIII) may be isolated as the acid addition salt, for example as the dihydrochloride salt, or the acid addition salt may be neutralized with base to form the free amine. In a preferred aspect, the 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIH) is isolated as its crystalline acid addition salt. In many instances, the properties of the 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine acid addition salt, including ease of crystallization, are controlled by the particular acid counterion. The counterion in the isolated acid addition salt is selected by treating the free amine with the desired acid, or preferably, by employing an acid having the desired counterion in the acid hydrolysis described above.<br>
The 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIII) is then cyclized to the N6-substi-tuted adenosine derivative (I) by reaction with formamidine acetate, formic acid or the ortho esters of formic acid as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,364,862 and 5,561,134 and Intern. Pat. App. No. PCTAJS97/21439, incorporated herein by reference. Polar aprotic solvents, higher boiling alcohols and esters and aromatic solvents such as toluene have been employed for these types of cyclizations. Esters such as n-propyl and n-butyl acetate or a combination of one of these esters with ethyl acetate are especially preferred. The N6-substituted adenosine derivative (I) is preferably purified by recrystallization from a suitable organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents. Ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl acetate and propionate are preferred solvents.<br><br><br><br>
