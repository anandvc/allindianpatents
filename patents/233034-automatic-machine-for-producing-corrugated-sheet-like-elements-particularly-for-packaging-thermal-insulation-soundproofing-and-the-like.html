				<td>AUTOMATIC MACHINE FOR PRODUCING CORRUGATED SHEET-<br>
LIKE ELEMENTS, PARTICULARLY FOR PACKAGING, THERMAL<br>
INSULATION, SOUNDPROOFING, AND THE LIKE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an automatic machine for producing<br>
corrugated sheet-like elements, particularly for packaging, thermal<br>
insulation, soundproofing and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Patent GB 1110287 discloses a sheet made of thermoplastic resin,<br>
which is extruded with a corrugated profile and on which corrugations are<br>
provided in a direction that is substantially parallel to the extrusion<br>
direction.<br>
A substantially flat sheet is connected to the resulting corrugated<br>
sheet, for example by lamination; such flat sheet can be made of the most<br>
disparate materials and can be obtained for example by means of expanded<br>
plastic material.<br>
This embodiment has the drawback of producing a manufactured<br>
article that is difficult to store, since the coupled sheet that is provided<br>
cannot be rolled up because the corrugations lie substantially parallel to the<br>
longitudinal extension of the ribbon.<br>
Because of this problem, the article in this embodiment has not<br>
achieved an acceptable diffusion among users, since it was not practically<br>
possible to perform industrial-level production.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the invention is to solve the problem described above, by<br>
providing an automatic machine that allows to provide corrugated sheet-like<br>
elements automatically, providing a continuous and industrially valid<br>
production.<br>
Within this aim, an object of the invention is to provide an automatic<br>
machine that allows to continuously connect a corrugated sheet-like element<br>
to at least one flat sheet-like element, leading directly to a finished<br>
manufactured article that can be stored in relatively limited spaces.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic<br>
machine that thanks to its particular constructive characteristics is capable<br>
of giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in use.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic<br>
machine that can be easily obtained starting from commonly commercially<br>
available elements and materials and is also competitive from a merely<br>
economical standpoint.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by an automatic machine for producing corrugated<br>
sheet-like elements, particularly for packaging, thermal insulation,<br>
soundproofing and the like, according to the invention, characterized in that<br>
it comprises means for continuously corrugating a first ribbon that moves<br>
longitudinally, means for feeding a second flat ribbon in step with said first<br>
ribbon, and means for joining one another said first and second ribbons in<br>
discrete regions.<br>

Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, the automatic machine for producing<br>
corrugated sheet-like elements, particularly for packaging, thermal<br>
insulation, soundproofing and the like, comprises a supporting framework,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 1, which supports means,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 2, for continuously<br>
corrugating a first ribbon.<br>
Said means for continuously corrugating a first ribbon are constituted<br>
by a reel 5 for dispensing the first ribbon 3, which is supported so that it can<br>
rotate on the supporting framework 1 and feeds a ribbon preferably made of<br>
expanded plastic material.<br>
It is also possible to feed a first ribbon and at least one first adjacent<br>
ribbon, so as to have a longitudinal separation line on the ribbons 3 that will<br>
be corrugated.<br>
The corrugating means 2 are constituted by an upper conveyor,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 10, and by a lower conveyor<br>
11.<br>
The upper conveyor is constituted by an upper chain 12, which<br>
continuously winds around gears 13 that are arranged at the ends and are<br>
connected to motor means that determine the type of movement and the<br>
speed of the ribbon.<br>
The upper conveyor 10 has a plurality of upper rods or bars 14, which<br>
are connected to lateral arms 15 that protrude from coupling blocks 16,<br>
which in practice are associated with the links of the chain 12, so as to<br>
always lie substantially at right angles to the orientation of the chain.<br>
The upper rods 14 engage the upper face of the first ribbon 3 and<br>
move in a longitudinal direction in step with the lower conveyor 11, which<br>
has a lower chain 20 that winds around lower gears 21, which are motorized<br>
so as to produce synchronous motion between the lower chain 20 and the<br>
upper chain 12.<br>
Means for actuating lower rods 24 are connected to the chain 20 and<br>
are constituted for example by a plurality of lower cylinders 23, which are<br>
arranged at right angles to the extension of the chain 20 and support a<br>
plurality of lower rods 24, which are moved along directions that are<br>
substantially parallel to the direction of the upper rods 14, so as to be<br>
intercalated between said rods.<br>
In greater detail, the lower branch of the upper conveyor 10 in<br>
practice intersects the upper branch of the lower conveyor 11, so that the<br>
upper rods 14 and the lower rods 24 are mutually alternated and engage<br>
mutually opposite sides of the first ribbon 3, which accordingly assumes an<br>
undulated shape, for example a sinusoidal shape.<br>
The lower rods 24 have a movement that is perpendicular to the<br>
direction of motion of the ribbon for the reasons that will become better<br>
apparent hereinafter and in order to be able to disengage from the first<br>
ribbon when required.<br>
The machine further comprises an auxiliary chain 25, which moves<br>
synchronously with respect to the chain 20 and is arranged on the side of the<br>
upper conveyor that lies opposite the side where the cylinders 23 are<br>
provided.<br>
The auxiliary chain supports a plurality of guiding elements 26,<br>
which are in step with the cylinders 23, in order to support the free end of<br>
the lower rods 24 in the extracted position.<br>
The automatic machine further comprises means for feeding 29 a<br>
second flat ribbon in step with the first ribbon.<br>
Said feeding means are constituted by a reel 29 for dispensing a<br>
second ribbon 30, which, is supported by the framework 1 and feeds the<br>
ribbon 30 on a coupling roller 31 that is positioned below the upper rods,<br>
proximate to the upper branch of the first conveyor.<br>
With this arrangement, the second ribbon 30 is arranged laterally<br>
adjacent to the lower face of the first ribbon 3, which has assumed an<br>
undulated configuration, so that a series of lower rods 24 remains inserted in<br>
the cavities formed between the first ribbon 3 and the second ribbon 30. .<br>
Furthermore the machine has joining means that provide the mutual<br>
coupling in discrete regions between the first ribbon 3 and the second<br>
ribbon 30.<br>
Said joining means, in a preferred embodiment, are constituted by a<br>
hot air blower 40, which, in practice produces a localized melting of the<br>
plastic material that constitutes the first and second ribbons, achieving<br>
coupling by contact at the roller 31 over which the second ribbon is passed<br>
upon contact with the lower bend of the first ribbon.<br>
In this coupling step, the upper rods 14 in practice press the first<br>
ribbon onto the second ribbon, thus facilitating the coupling to the second<br>
ribbon, which is flat.<br>
Proximate to the end of the upper branch of the lower conveyor 11,<br>
the lower rods must be extracted from the cavities and therefore disengage<br>
from the two coupled ribbons, which as shown in the drawings, assume a<br>
configuration that forms a plurality of cavities.<br>
The rods 24 remain retracted within the corresponding cylinders 23<br>
until they arrive proximate to the end of the lower branch of the lower<br>
conveyor, in which the rods are extracted from the cylinders and arrange<br>
themselves so that they can lie below the first ribbon and above the second<br>
ribbon.<br>
With the arrangement described above, therefore, a machine can be<br>
obtained that is capable of continuously and automatically joining one<br>
another two ribbons of" expanded plastic material, one of which is<br>
corrugated so as to obtain, between the first and second ribbons, a plurality<br>
of side-by-side cavities, which allow to reduce the weight of the resulting<br>
article and to provide in practice a plurality of chambers that form a valid<br>
barrier both for soundproofing and for thermal insulation.<br>
According to what is shown in Figure 6, another embodiment of the<br>
machine is provided which, together with the same components described<br>
earlier for coupling the first and second ribbons, has a station 60 for<br>
coupling an additional flat ribbon 61, obviously on the opposite side with<br>
respect to the side provided with the second ribbon 30.<br>
For this purpose, a second hot air blower 62 is provided, which<br>
produces a localized melting of the additional ribbon 61 in order to achieve<br>
coupling to the corrugated ribbon 3 at a coupling ribbon 63 that lies above<br>
the article being produced and is arranged along the extension of the upper<br>
conveyor 10.<br>
Advantageously, over a certain extent, the rods 24 are left within the<br>
bends so as to facilitate dimensional stability during coupling and are then<br>
extracted in order to allow separation by extracting the rods at the upper end<br>
branch of the lower conveyor, which in this case is extended with respect to<br>
the upper conveyor.<br>
Advantageously, as shown more clearly in Figures 7 to 8, different<br>
means are provided for the actuation of the rods 24, such means being<br>
constituted by carriages 70 that can move in a direction that is substantially<br>
parallel to the advancement of the rods and are supported by two guiding<br>
bars 71, which move in step with the lower conveyor so as to allow the<br>
insertion and extraction of the rods in the intended manner.<br>
In order to move the rods 24, above the carriages 70, which are<br>
provided with engagement pins 75, there are actuation conveyors 80, which<br>
are provided with flaps 81 that are uniformly spaced, move in the direction<br>
of motion of the rods 24, and engage in succession the pins 75 so as to<br>
provide, in the intended spaces, the translational motion of the rods 24,<br>
which are made to enter and exit the bends formed by the ribbon being<br>
corrugated.<br>
The provided arrangement allows to achieve rapid movement with<br>
very simple means.<br>
Advantageously, said actuation means or conveyors 80 are provided<br>
at the end portion of the upper branch of the lower conveyor, where<br>
extraction is performed, and at the lower portion of the lower branch of the<br>
lower conveyor, where insertion is performed.<br>
The machine also allows to vary at will the breadth of the bends of<br>
the ribbon being corrugated, and for this purpose distance variation means<br>
90 are provided that allow to modify at will the mutual distance between the<br>
lower conveyor 11 and the upper conveyor 10.<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 10, it is also possible to change at will the<br>
mutual spacing between the rods, so as to be able to vary, according to the<br>
manufacturing requirements, both the dimensions and the spacing of the<br>
bends provided on the corrugated ribbon 10.<br>
It should be noted, and it is a very important aspect, that the machine<br>
described above allows to continuously provide a ribbon in which the<br>
corrugated layer is obtained by continuously undulating a flat sheet, with<br>
bends that lie substantially at right angles to the direction of extension of the<br>
ribbon; moreover, the bends are connected in discrete regions to at least one<br>
other flat sheet.<br>
Furthermore, the possibility to couple a plurality of ribbons in<br>
successive steps allows to obtain a very wide range of products that are<br>
always differentiated.<br>
From what has been described above, it is therefore evident that the<br>
invention achieves the intended aim and objects, and in particular the fact is<br>
stressed that the machine described above allows to provide automatically<br>
and continuously the coupling of two or more ribbons of expanded plastic<br>
material, thus obtaining a manufactured article that is particularly practical<br>
and valid from a functional and commercial standpoint.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous<br>
modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
Several possible embodiments of the corrugated sheet-like element<br>
are illustrated with reference to Figures 11 to 19; said element is produced<br>
by using an apparatus of the type described above, which can have<br>
additional processing stations or in which a sheet-like element that has<br>
already been processed is inserted instead of one of the ribbons.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a corrugated sheet-like element, designated by<br>
the reference numeral 50, in which an additional corrugated layer is inserted<br>
and is coupled to the flat ribbon, on one side of which a corrugated ribbon<br>
had already been provided.<br>
Figure 12 is a view of a corrugated sheet-like element 51 in which, on<br>
the opposite sides of the flat ribbon, there are corrugated ribbons having<br>
different corrugation pitches.<br>
In Figure 13, the sheet-like element 52 has corrugated elements<br>
connected to the sides of the flat ribbon; one of said corrugated elements has<br>
an alternating pitch, i.e., a bend is formed between spaces in which, instead<br>
of the bend, contact is provided between the flat ribbon and the corrugated<br>
ribbon and covers an extent that corresponds to a spacing pitch, i.e., a region<br>
in which a corrugation could be provided.<br>
In Figure 14, the sheet-like element 53 is provided by means of two<br>
flat ribbons, between which a corrugated ribbon is arranged.<br>
Figure 15 is a view of a sheet-like element 54 in which there is an<br>
alternation of corrugated ribbons and flat ribbons; the sheet-like element 55<br>
of Figure 16 also has an alternation of corrugated ribbons and flat ribbons,<br>
with corrugated ribbons that have different spacing pitches and widths.<br>
In Figure 17, the sheet-like element 56 is provided by coupling to the<br>
flat ribbon a corrugated ribbon with alternating pitch; Figure 18 instead<br>
illustrates a sheet-like element 57 in which a corrugated ribbon with<br>
alternating pitch is provided between two flat ribbons.<br>
Figure 19 is a view of the sheet-like element 58, in which there are<br>
flat ribbons between which different types of corrugated ribbon, such as for<br>
example a corrugated ribbon with uniform pitch and a corrugated ribbon<br>
with alternating pitch, are alternated.<br>
The articles described above can be produced by providing additional<br>
stations on the machine described above, or it is possible to use the same<br>
type of machine, in which a manufactured article is fed which is constituted<br>
by the coupling of a plurality of previously provided ribbons, so as to obtain<br>
the chosen combination.<br>
All the details may further be replaced with other technically<br>
equivalent elements, and. individual characteristics given in relation to<br>
specific examples may actually be interchanged with other different<br>
characteristics that exist in other examples of embodiments.<br>
In practice, the materials used, so long as they are compatible with the<br>
specific use, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions, may be any<br>
according to requirements.<br>
