BODY FOR A CATHETER OR SHEATH<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present application claims the benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/675,973 ("the '973 application"), which was filed on 28 April 2005.<br>
This application is also related to international patent application no. PCT/US2006/xxxxxx<br>
(docket no. 0B-046803 WO), being filed concurrently herewith (the 'xxx application). The<br>
"973 application and the Axxx application are both hereby incorporated by reference as<br>
though fully set forth herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to bodies for catheters and sheaths and methods<br>
of manufacturing and using such bodies. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
splittable and radiopaque bodies and methods of manufacturing and using such bodies.<br>
[0003] Catheters and sheaths are commonly manufactured with splittable (i.e.,<br>
peelable or peel-away) type bodies that allow the catheter or sheath to be removed from<br>
about an implanted medical device (e.g., pacemaker leads) without disturbing the device.<br>
Prior art bodies are formed with peeling grooves that extend longitudinally along the inner<br>
or outer circumferential surfaces of their walls in order to make the bodies splittable.<br>
Providing such peeling grooves is a difficult and expensive manufacturing process.<br>
[0004] Other catheters and sheaths are commonly manufactured with tubular bodies<br>
having radiopaque distal tips. Such catheters and sheaths are used in cardiovascular<br>
procedures and other medical procedures. The radiopaque distal tip may be viewed within<br>
a patient's body via an X-ray fluoroscope or other imaging system, thereby allowing a<br>
physician to position the tubular body as required during a procedure.<br>
[0005] Prior art tubular bodies with radiopaque distal tips often use precious heavy<br>
metals (e.g., gold, platinum, tantalum) to achieve sufficient tip radiopacity. For example, a<br>
thin band of a precious heavy metal is imbedded in the distal tip of each such prior art<br>
tubular body. As a result, such prior art tubular bodies end up being quite expensive<br>
because of the high cost of the precious heavy metals and the labor intensive<br>
manufacturing processes used to manufacture such tubular bodies.<br>
[0006] Tubular bodies are made from polymeric materials that may not be chemically<br>
compatible with the precious metal used to form the radiopaque distal band. As such, the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720<br>
 <br>
2<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
distal band may not adhere to the material matrix of the tubular body, causing potential<br>
material separation and a discontinuity in mechanical strength.<br>
[0007] Where a tubular body with a radiopaque distal tip also needs to be splittable to<br>
allow its removal from a patient without disturbing an implanted medical device, the thin<br>
band of precious heavy metal must be provided with a peeling groove that coincides with<br>
the peeling groove in the tubular body's wall. This adds further difficulty and expense to<br>
an already difficult and expensive manufacturing process.<br>
[0008] There is a need in the art for a splittable and/or radiopaque tubular body that<br>
utilizes less costly materials, is less labor intensive to manufacture, and is less likely to fail<br>
during a medical procedure due to material separation. There is also a need for methods of<br>
manufacturing and using such a tubular body.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present invention is a body for a catheter or sheath. The body comprises a<br>
lumen defined by a wall formed with longitudinal strips. The first strip has a radiopacity<br>
that is higher than the second strip, providing the body with required visibility within a<br>
patient's body via an x-ray fluoroscope. The body can have a tubular cross section as<br>
described in detail herein, or may have any other desirable cross section, e.g., generally<br>
triangular or square.<br>
[0010] The present invention is a body for a catheter or sheath. The body includes a<br>
proximal end, a distal end, a first longitudinal strip, and a second longitudinal strip. The<br>
first and second strips extend between the proximal and distal ends. The first strip can<br>
have a radiopacity that is higher than the second strip. The first strip can be made of<br>
radiopaque polymeric compounds, including tungsten-filled polymer compounds. The first<br>
and second strips may be helical along the body.<br>
[0011 ] The first longitudinal strip may comprise between 2-50% of the circumference<br>
of the body. The first longitudinal strip may comprise between 10-25% of the<br>
circumference of the body. The first longitudinal strip may comprise between 1-5% of the<br>
circumference of the body.<br>
[0012] The tubular body can include a proximal end, a distal end, a first longitudinal<br>
strip, and a second longitudinal strip. The first and second longitudinal strips can be<br>
formed at the distal end of the tubular body only, and then bonded together to form the<br>
tubular body using various polymeric joining technologies.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
3<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
[0013] The tubular body can have a cylindrical wall. A wall cross-section of the<br>
cylindrical wall (as taken generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the cylindrical<br>
wall) includes a first wall segment and a second wall segment. These two segments may<br>
form at least an integral portion of the wall cross-section, which may be circumferentially<br>
continuous and integral. The first segment can have a radiopacity that is higher than the<br>
second segment.<br>
[0014] The present invention, includes a method of forming a tubular body for a<br>
catheter or sheath. The tubular body includes a first longitudinal strip and a second<br>
longitudinal strip. The method comprises providing a machine and relevant specialty tool,<br>
displacing a first material with the machine to create a first material stream, displacing a<br>
second material with the machine to create a second material stream, and bringing the first<br>
material stream into contact with the second material stream such that the first material<br>
stream forms the first longitudinal strip and the second material stream forms the second<br>
longitudinal strip. The first and second strips may form at least a portion of a wall<br>
cross-section of the tubular body, wherein the wall cross-section is circumferentially<br>
continuous and integral. The first material can have a radiopacity that exceeds the<br>
radiopacity of the second material.<br>
[0015] The machine can be, for example, a co-extrusion machine, a co-injection<br>
molding machine, or a co-compression molding machine.<br>
[0016] The tubular body can comprise a peel line formed by a longitudinally<br>
extending region of interfacial bonding between first and second longitudinally extending<br>
strips of polymer material.<br>
[0017] The polymer materials of the first and second strips can differ in that the<br>
polymer material of the first strip is loaded with a greater amount of inorganic filler than<br>
the polymer material of the second strip. The polymer material of the first strip can have a<br>
greater amount of radiopaque material than the polymer material of the second strip. The<br>
radiopaque material can include a pure metal or metallic compound with at least one<br>
element with an atomic number from about 22 to about 83.<br>
[0018] The polymer material of the first longitudinally extending strip can be<br>
functionally miscible with the polymer material of the second longitudinally extending<br>
strip. The polymer material of the first longitudinally extending strip maybe comprised of<br>
at least one different polymer than the polymer material of the second longitudinally<br>
extending strip.<br>

 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
[0019] Each strip can form at least a portion of an outer circumferential surface of the<br>
tubular body. A region of stress concentration extends along the region of interfacial<br>
bonding. The stress concentration facilitates the splitting of the splittable tubular body<br>
along the peel line.<br>
[0020] The polymer material of the first strip can be dissimilar from, but chemically<br>
compatible with, the polymer material of the second strip. The polymer material of the<br>
first strip may have a molecular orientation that is different from a molecular orientation of<br>
the polymer of the second strip. For example, the polymer material of the first strip can<br>
have a flow-induced axial molecular orientation.<br>
[0021] The polymer material of the first strip can be chemically in-compatible with the<br>
polymer material of the second strip. If so, a polymer compatibilizer is introduced into at<br>
least one of the polymer materials to improve melt adhesion between the first and second<br>
strips of polymer material.<br>
[0022] The splittable tubular body can include a first peel mechanism longitudinally<br>
extending along the body. The first peel mechanism is formed by a longitudinally<br>
extending region of interfacial bonding between first and second longitudinally extending<br>
strips of polymer material.<br>
[0023] While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the<br>
present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following<br>
detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention.<br>
As will be realized, the invention is capable of modifications in various aspects, all without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings<br>
and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0047] FIG. 1 is an elevational view of the present invention according to a first<br>
embodiment including a splittable (i.e., peel-away type) body 2 for a catheter or sheath.<br>
The body 2 includes a distal end 4 and a proximal end 6. As shown in FIG. 1, the body 2<br>
is formed of at least two integral longitudinal strips 8,10 of different materials. As<br>
indicated in FIG. 1, each strip 8,10 may extend the full length of the tubular body 2 in a<br>
generally straight manner. As shown in FIG. 2a, the body can have a tubular cross section.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, the body can have a triangular 210 or square 220<br>
cross-section.<br>
[0048] The strips 8,10 will be referred to herein as the first strip 8 and the second strip<br>
10. The material of the first strip 8 will be sufficiently different from the material of the<br>
second strip 10 so as to form a stress concentration along the interfacial zones (i.e.,<br>
borders) 11 between the two strips 8,10. The stress concentration forms a peel line 11 that<br>
acts like a built-in peel groove. As a result, the tubular body 2 is readily splittable although<br>
it lacks an actual peel groove.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720	PCT/US2006/016373<br>
7<br>
[0049J The dissimilarity between the materials used to form the strips 8,10 need only<br>
be sufficient enough to create a stress concentration that acts as a built-in peel groove.<br>
This may be accomplished in different ways, including the following ways.<br>
[0050] The materials used for the strips 8,10 may be generally the same, but can also<br>
differ. For example, the first strip 8 may be constructed from a first polymer and the<br>
second strip 10 may be constructed from a second polymer. The polymer used for the first<br>
strip 8 may have a different molecular orientation than the polymer used for the second<br>
strip 10. In one embodiment, the material used for the first strip 8 is a polymer with<br>
flow-induced axial molecular orientation, and the material used for the second strip 10 is a<br>
polymer having little or no flow-induced axial molecular orientation. In such an<br>
embodiment, the tear strength along the flow-induced orientation direction for the<br>
polymeric material used for the first strip 8 will decrease due to the mechanical anisotropy<br>
induced by the molecular chain alignment. Conversely, due to its low level of mechanical<br>
anisotropy, the polymeric material used for the second strip 10 will have any one or all of<br>
the following attributes: high tear strength; high mechanical strength, high torquability;<br>
and high kink resistance. Examples of materials that can be used for the first strip 8 and<br>
are easily molecularly oriented along the flow direction during polymer processing include,<br>
among other materials, crystal polymers like Ticona Vectra™, LKX 1107, and LKX 1113.<br>
[0051] The base polymer materials used for the first and second strips 8,10 can be<br>
chemically the same or similar, except, the material used for the first strip 8 can be loaded<br>
with semi-compatible or incompatible inorganic fillers. Such fillers can include<br>
radiopaque fillers or other general-purpose fillers like silica, clay, graphite, mica, and<br>
calcium carbonate. The tear strengths and the elongations at yield and break for the<br>
material used for the first strip 8 will decrease with the increase of the filler loading.<br>
[0052] The base polymeric materials used for the first and second strips 8,10 can be<br>
chemically in-compatible. If so, a polymer compatibilizer is introduced to at least one of<br>
the polymer materials used for the first and second strips 8,10 to improve the melt<br>
adhesion between the first and second strips 8,10.<br>
[0053] After the tubular body 2 is manufactured, the material used for the first strips 8<br>
can be different from the material used for the second strip 10 with respect to molecular<br>
orientation and/or anisotropy in mechanical properties. This will especially be the case<br>
with respect to tear strength and elongation at yield and break. Furthermore, the materials<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720<br>
 <br>
8<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
used for the first and second strips 8, 10 will be at least partially compatible such that<br>
self-adhesion inter facial zones 11 are reliably formable between the strips 8,10.<br>
[0054] The materials used for the strips 8,10 can be functionally miscible. To be<br>
functionally miscible, the two materials used for the strips 8,10, must have sufficient<br>
adhesion to function for the intended use of the instrument, but must have sufficient stress<br>
concentrations formed at the interfacial zones 11 between the strips 8,10 to readily act as a<br>
built-in peel groove when the instrument has completed its intended function. In another<br>
embodiment, the materials used for the strips 8,10 are chemically miscible or partially<br>
miscible in order to impose the self-adhesion of the strips 8,10 and create reliable<br>
interfacial regions 11 between said strips 8,10. In one embodiment, the materials used for<br>
the strips 8,10 include melt-processable thermoplastics (e.g., polyethylene, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride, fluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymer, Polyethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene,<br>
plypropylene, polyamide-6, polyamide-6.6, polyamide-11, polyamide-12, polyethylene<br>
terephathlate, polybutylenes terephathlate, polycarbonates, polystyrene, etc.) and<br>
thermoplastic elastomers ("TPEs") (e.g., polyamide-based TPEs, olefinic TPEs, ionic<br>
TPEs, polyester-based TPEs, thermoplastic polyurethanes, etc.).<br>
[0055] The material used for the first strip 8 can be a material highly loaded with a<br>
radiopaque material. In such an embodiment, the first strip 8 is referred to as the high<br>
radiopacity strip(s) 8. In the same embodiment, the material used for the second strip 10 is<br>
a material that is not loaded or a material that is lightly loaded with a radiopaque material.<br>
In such an embodiment, the second strip 10 is referred to as the low radiopacity strip(s) 10.<br>
[0056] As will described in greater detail later in this Detailed Description, the tubular<br>
body 2 is inserted into the body of a patient via a surgical site (e.g., entering the chest<br>
cavity below the xiphoid process) and directed to a point of treatment (e.g., the pericardial<br>
space of a heart). Alternatively, the tubular body 2 is inserted into the body of a patient via<br>
a body lumen of a patient (e.g., a blood vessel) and manipulated so it travels along the<br>
body lumen to a point of treatment (e.g., a chamber in the heart). A medical device is<br>
implanted at the point of treatment via the tubular body 2. To allow the removal of the<br>
tubular body 2 without disturbing the implanted medical device (e.g., pacemaker leads),<br>
the tubular body 2 is longitudinally split along the interfaces 11 between the strips 8,10 by<br>
simply forcing the sides of the tubular body 2 apart via a fingernail, tool or other<br>
implement. The stress concentrations 11 formed at the interfaces 11 between the strips 8,<br>

10 act as a built-in peel groove. The split tubular body 2 is then removed from about the<br>
implanted medical device.<br>
[0057] Where the tubular body 2 includes a first strip 8 formed from a material that is<br>
highly-loaded with a radiopaque material (i.e., the first strip 8 is a high radiopacity strip 8),<br>
the travel and positioning of the tubular body 2 within the patient may be monitored via<br>
X-ray fluoroscopy.<br>
[0058] As will become evident from this Detailed Description, the splittable tubular<br>
body 2 in its various embodiments provides the following advantages. First, the tubular<br>
body 2 is readily splittable between the two types of strips 8,10 without the presence of a<br>
peeling groove, score or skive. Second, the tubular body 2 is less expensive to<br>
manufacture than prior art splittable tubular bodies because a peel groove does not need to<br>
be formed on the tubular body 2, and the tubular body 2 can be made in a single simple<br>
process, such as co-extrusion, co-injection molding, or co-compression molding.<br>
[0059] In embodiments of the tubular body 2 that have first strips 8 made of materials<br>
that are highly-loaded with radiopaque materials (i.e., tubular bodies 2 with high<br>
radiopacity strips 8), such tubular bodies 2 will also have the following advantages. First,<br>
because the tubular body 2 is visible in the human body along its entire length via an X-ray<br>
fluoroscope, a physician does not need to estimate the position of the extreme end of the<br>
distal tip 4 as is required with prior art tubular bodies that have radiopaque rings implanted<br>
in their distal ends. Second, because the tubular body 2 is made from compatible polymers<br>
or polymeric compounds without the use of pure metals or metallic compounds, the tubular<br>
body 2 has better material compatibility and mechanical integrity than prior art tubular<br>
bodies. Third, by having a tubular body 2 with both high radiopacity strips 8 and low<br>
radiopacity strips 10, the tubular body is highly flexible, yet highly kink resistant. Other<br>
advantageous aspects of the tubular body 2 will become apparent throughout this Detailed<br>
Description.<br>
[0060] For a better understanding of the first embodiment of the tubular body 2 and its<br>
strips 8,10, reference is now made to FIGS. 2A and 2B. FIG. 2A is a cross-sectional view<br>
of the first embodiment of the tubular body 2 taken through section line A-A in FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 2B is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the first embodiment of the tubular body<br>
2 taken through section line A'-A' in FIG. 2A. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the first<br>
embodiment of the tubular body 2 includes a wall 12 that has an outer circumferential<br>
surface 14 and an inner circumferential surface 16. The outer circumferential surface 14<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720<br>
 <br>
10<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
forms the outer surface of the tubular body 2 and the inner circumferential surface 16<br>
defines a lumen 18 through the tubular body 2 that runs the full length of the tubular body<br>
2.<br>
[0061] As illustrated in FIG. 2A, each strip 8,10 forms an integral segment of the wall<br>
12. As shown in FIG. 2A, the tubular body 2, in one embodiment, may have four first<br>
strips 8 and four second strips 10 that are formed together (e.g. under a co-extrusion<br>
process) to create a wall 12 that is circumferentially continuous and integral along its entire<br>
length. In other embodiments, there will be as few as one first strip 8 and one second strip<br>
10. In yet other embodiments, there will be any number of each type of strip 8,10,<br>
including more than four first strips 8 and four second strips 10. Also, in some<br>
embodiments, one type of strip 8,10 will outnumber the other type of strip 8,10.<br>
[0062] In one embodiment with two first strips 8 and two second strips 10, each strip<br>
8,10 will have a width that comprises approximately 25% of the circumference of the<br>
tubular body wall 12. In other embodiments where the strips 8,10 each account for<br>
generally equal percentages of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12, the width of<br>
the strips 8,10, depending on the total number of strips, will range between approximately<br>
2% and approximately 50% of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12.<br>
[0063] In one embodiment, one type of strip 8,10 may constitute a greater percentage<br>
of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12. In other words, the first strips 8 may<br>
have greater widths than the second strips 10, or vice versa. For example, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2A, each of the four first strips 8 account for approximately 17% of the circumference<br>
of the tubular body wall 12, while each of the second strips 10 each account for<br>
approximately 8% of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12. Similarly, in another<br>
embodiment with two first strips 8 and two second strips 10, each of the two second strips<br>
10 accounts for approximately 33% of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12,<br>
while each of the two first strips 8 accounts for approximately 17% of the circumference of<br>
the tubular body wall 12. Again, depending on the number of strips 8,10, in other<br>
embodiments, the width of the strips 8,10 may range between approximately 2% and<br>
approximately 50% of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12. In other<br>
embodiments, the width of one or more of the strips 8,10 will be between approximately<br>
0.1% and approximately 5% to form a micro strip 8,10.<br>
[0064] In one embodiment, one or more of the strips 8,10 may have a unique<br>
percentage of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12. For example, in an<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720<br>
 <br>
11<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
embodiment of the tubular body 2 having multiple first strips 8, at least one (if not all) of<br>
the first strips 8 has a unique width. Thus, in one embodiment, the widths 8 of the first<br>
strips are not all equal. In other embodiments, a similar configuration could exist for at<br>
least one (if not all) of the second strips 10 or at least one (if not all) of the strips 8,10.<br>
[0065] In one embodiment, the lumen 18 will have a diameter of between<br>
approximately 4 French ("F") and approximately 22 F. In one embodiment, the tubular<br>
body 2 will have an outer diameter of between approximately 5 F and approximately 24 F.<br>
In one embodiment, the tubular body 2 will have a wall with a thickness of between<br>
approximately .006" and approximately 0.026".<br>
[0066] For a discussion of a second embodiment of the invention, reference is now<br>
made to FIGS. 3, 4A and 4B. FIG. 3 is an elevational view of a second embodiment of the<br>
radiopaque tubular body 2 having a distal end 4 and a proximal end 6 and being formed of<br>
at least two integral longitudinal strips 8,10. These strips 8,10 can have different<br>
radiopacities. FIG. 4A is a latitudinal cross-sectional view of the second embodiment of<br>
the tubular body 2 taken through section line B-B in FIG. 3. FIG. 4B is a longitudinal<br>
cross-sectional view of the second embodiment of the tubular body 2 taken through section<br>
lineB'-B'inFIG.4A.<br>
[0067] As can be understood from FIG. 3 and as is more readily seen in FIGS. 4A and<br>
4B, the second embodiment of the tubular body 2 and its strips 8,10 are configured<br>
similarly to those in the first embodiment of the tubular body 2 as depicted in FIGS. 1, 2A<br>
and 2B, except the first strips 8 of the second embodiment are subjacent to layers of second<br>
strip material 10', 10" that form the outer and inner circumferential surfaces 14, 16 of the<br>
tubular body wall 12. In other words, as illustrated in FIGS. 3,4A and 4B, the first strips 8<br>
of the second embodiment of the tubular body 2 are sandwiched between an outer layer 10'<br>
and an inner layer 10" of second strip material 10.<br>
[0068] In other variations of the second embodiment, the first strips 8 of the second<br>
embodiment of the tubular body 2 are subjacent to a single layer of second strip material<br>
10. For example, in a first variation of the second embodiment of the tubular body 2, as<br>
depicted in FIGS. 4C and 4D, which are, respectively, a latitudinal cross-sectional view of<br>
the tubular body 2 taken through section line B-B in FIG. 3 and a longitudinal cross-<br>
sectional view of the tubular body 2 taken through section line B"-B" in FIG. 4C, the first<br>
strips 8 are subjacent to a single layer of second strip material 10, which is an outer layer<br>
10'. Thus, as depicted in FIGS. 4C and 4D, the second strip outer layer 10' forms the outer<br>

12<br>
circumferential surfaces 14 of the tubular body wall 12 and the first strips 8 form segments<br>
of the inner circumferential surface 16 of the tubular body wall 12.<br>
[0069] Similarly, in a second variation of the second embodiment of the tubular body<br>
2, as depicted in FIGS. 4E and 4F, which are, respectively, a latitudinal cross-sectional<br>
view of the tubular body 2 taken through section line B-B in FIG. 3 and a longitudinal<br>
cross-sectional view of the tubular body 2 taken through section line B'"-B'" in FIG. 4E,<br>
the first strips 8 are subjacent to a single layer of second strip material 10, which is an<br>
inner layer 10". Thus, as depicted in FIGS. 4E and 4F, the second strip inner layer 10"<br>
forms the inner circumferential surfaces 16 of the tubular body wall 12 and the first strips 8<br>
form segments of the outer circumferential surface 14 of the tubular body wall 12.<br>
[0070] For a discussion of a third embodiment of the invention, reference is now made<br>
to FIGS. 5, 6A and 6B. FIG. 5 is an elevational view of a third embodiment of the tubular<br>
body 2 having a distal end 4 and a proximal end 6 and being formed of at least two integral<br>
longitudinal helical strips 8,10. these strips 8,10 can have different radiopacities. FIG.<br>
6 A is a latitudinal cross-sectional view of the third embodiment of the tubular body 2 taken<br>
through section line C-C in FIG. 5. FIG. 6B is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the<br>
third embodiment of the tubular body 2 taken through section line C'-C in FIG. 6A.<br>
[0071] As shown in FIGS. 5, 6A and 6B, in the third embodiment of the tubular body<br>
2, its strips 8,10 are configured similarly to those in the first embodiment of the tubular<br>
body 2 as depicted in FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B, except the strips 8,10 of the second<br>
embodiment extend spirally or helically along the length of the third embodiment of the<br>
tubular body 2.<br>
[0072] For a discussion of a fourth embodiment of the invention, reference is now<br>
made to FIGS. 7,8 A and 8B. FIG. 7 is an elevational view of a fourth embodiment of the<br>
tubular body 2 having a distal end 4 and a proximal end 6 and being formed of at least two<br>
integral longitudinal helical strips 8,10. These strips 8,10 can have different radiopacities.<br>
FIG. 8 is a latitudinal cross-sectional view of the fourth embodiment of the tubular body 2<br>
taken through section line D-D in FIG. 7. FIG. 8B is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of<br>
the fourth embodiment of the tubular body 2 taken through section line D'-D' in FIG. 8A.<br>
[0073] As can be understood from FIG. 7 and as is more readily seen in FIGS. 8A and<br>
8B, the fourth embodiment of the tubular body 2 and its helical strips 8,10 are configured<br>
similarly to those in the third embodiment of the tubular body 2 as depicted in FIGS. 5, 6A<br>
and 6B, except the helical first strips 8 of the fourth embodiment are subjacent to layers of<br>

 <br>
second strip material 10', 10" that form the outer and inner circumferential surfaces of the<br>
tubular body wall 12. In other words, as illustrated in FIGS. 7, 8A and 8B, the helical first<br>
strips 8 of the fourth embodiment of the tubular body 2 are sandwiched between an outer<br>
layer 10' and inner layer 10" of second strip material 10.<br>
[0074] In other variations of the fourth embodiment, the first strips 8 of the fourth<br>
embodiment of the tubular body 2 are subjacent to a single layer of second strip material<br>
10. For example, in a first variation of the fourth embodiment of the tubular body 2, as<br>
depicted in FIGS. 8C and 8D, which are, respectively, a latitudinal cross-sectional view of<br>
the tubular body 2 taken through section line D-D in FIG. 7 and a longitudinal<br>
cross-sectional view of the tubular body 2 taken through section line D"-D" in FIG. 8C, the<br>
first strips 8 are subjacent to a single layer of second strip material 10, which is an inner<br>
layer 10". Thus, as depicted in FIGS. 8C and 8D, the second strip inner layer 10" forms<br>
the inner circumferential surface 16 of the tubular body wall 12 and the first strips 8 form<br>
segments of the outer circumferential surface 14 of the tubular body wall 12.<br>
[0075] Similarly, in a second variation of the fourth embodiment of the tubular body<br>
2, as depicted in FIGS. 8E and 8F, which are, respectively, a latitudinal cross-sectional<br>
view of the tubular body 2 taken through section line D-D in FIG. 7 and a longitudinal<br>
cross-sectional view of the tubular body 2 taken through section line D'"-D'" in FIG. 8E,<br>
the first strips 8 are subjacent to a single layer of second strip material 10, which is an<br>
outer layer 10'. Thus, as depicted in FIGS. 8E and 8F, the second strip outer layer 10'<br>
forms the outer circumferential surface 14 of the tubular body wall 12 and the first strips 8<br>
form segments of the inner circumferential surface 16 of the tubular body wall 12.<br>
[0076] The first strips 8 and the second strips 10 can be formed from two compatible<br>
polymers or polymeric compounds into an integral tubular body 2 via co-extrusion, co-<br>
injection molding, or co-compression molding processes. Candidate polymeric materials<br>
include thermoplastic and thermosetting polymer systems.<br>
[0077] The first strips 8 may be formed of material that is heavily filled with a<br>
biocompatible filler of heavy metal or a biocompatible metallic compound that gives rise<br>
to high radiopacity under X-ray radiation. The functional width and wall thickness (i.e.,<br>
percentage of the circumference of the tubular body wall 12) necessary for visibility via<br>
X-ray fluoroscopy will vary depending on the degree of radiopacity for a first strip 8 (i.e.,<br>
high radiopacity strip 8). For example, where a first strip 8 has a high degree of<br>
radiopacity (due to the radiopaque nature of the filler of metal or metallic compound<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720<br>
 <br>
14<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
impregnated in the polymer and/or due to the percentage of the metal or metallic<br>
compound in the polymer), narrower and thinner first strips 8 will suffice. On the other<br>
hand, where a first strip 8 has a lower degree of radiopacity, wider and thicker first strips 8<br>
will be required to achieve the necessary visibility via X-ray fluoroscopy.<br>
[0078] The first strips 8 (i.e., high radiopacity strips 8), if they are made from<br>
elastomeric polymer materials loaded with radiopaque fillers, provide kink resistance for<br>
the tubular body 2 in addition to providing the ability to be visualized within a patient's<br>
body via X-ray fluoroscopy. In a preferred embodiment, the first strips 8 will be a<br>
tungsten-impregnated thermoplastic elastomer, including thermoplastic polyurethane,<br>
polyether block amide, and etc. The amount of tungsten used will depend on the degree of<br>
radiopacity required and the thermoplastic elastomer. For example, when the strips are<br>
formed of PEBAX, the first strip can be loaded with 60-95% by weight tungsten, and<br>
preferably 80-85% by weight tungsten.<br>
[0079] The second strips 10 (i.e., low radiopacity strips 10) are either not loaded with<br>
radiopaque fillers or are lightly loaded. Thus, the second strips 10 have a low radiopacity<br>
under X-ray radiation and provide mechanical strength and durability for the tubular body<br>
2.<br>
[0080] For melt processing purposes, the selection of the pairs of polymers used for<br>
the strips 8,10 is primarily based on the level of chemical compatibility, balance of<br>
mechanical properties, and melt processability between the pairs of polymers. Different<br>
grades of polymers having the same constituent chemical species (e.g., various<br>
thermoplastic elastomers, including polyether block amides, polyurethanes, olefmics,<br>
styrenics, polyesters, polyethers, and etc.) may be used for the pairs. Pairs of<br>
thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers can also be used (e.g., polyamides with<br>
polyether block amides, polyesters with polyether-co-esters). Other polymer pairs are<br>
possible with use of polymer compatibilization technologies.<br>
[0081] For radiopaque tubular bodies 2, one base polymer from a polymer pair must<br>
be filled with heavy metals or metallic compounds using blending and compounding<br>
technologies via either melt or solvent processes. The heavy metals and compounds shall<br>
be biocompatible (e.g., barium, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, gold, bismuth, zirconium,<br>
niobium, titanium, bismuth oxychloride, barium sulfate, bismuth trioxide, iodine, iodide,<br>
etc. and their compounds). In one embodiment, the biocompatible radiopaque filler will<br>
contain at least one element with an atomic number of from about 22 to about 83.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/116720<br>
 <br>
15<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/016373<br>
 <br>
[0082] Filler of a heavy metal or a metallic compound may not be compatible with a<br>
selected base polymer, and may cause a drastic decrease in mechanical properties in the<br>
heavily loaded polymer compound. To increase the loading level of radiopaque filler and<br>
to improve the compatibility of the filler with the base polymer, a compatibilizer or<br>
coupling agent can be used for the polymer compound.<br>
[0083] As previously noted, the tubular bodies 2 are peelable (i.e., splittable) at one or<br>
more border(s) (i.e., interface(s)) between the two types of strips 8,10. To longitudinally<br>
split the tubular body 2, opposite sides of the interior circumferential surface 16 are simply<br>
forced apart via a fingernail, tool or other implement. The change in material at the<br>
borders between the strips 8,10 creates a stress concentration point that acts as a built in<br>
peel groove along which the tubular body 2 splits when peeled. Thus, no integral peeling<br>
groove is needed. However, in some embodiments, as indicated in FIG 9, an integral peel<br>
groove, skive or score 20 is provided to supplement the peelability of the tubular body 2.<br>
This can be readily implemented in the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 1-4. Ideally, this<br>
peel groove, skive or score 20 is aligned longitudinally with a boarder between a pair of<br>
strips 8,10. However, the peel groove, skive or score 20 can be located in one of the strips<br>
8,10 as indicated in FIG. 9. A tubular body 2 can have one or more peel grooves, skives<br>
or scores. The peel groove, score or skive 20 can be located in the inner and/or outer<br>
circumferential surface of the tubular body 2.<br>
[0084] Many of the aforementioned embodiments employ at least one strip 8,10<br>
formed of a material loaded with a radiopaque material. However, the strips 8,10 can be<br>
formed of polymers that are not loaded with a radiopaque or other materials. For example,<br>
the first strips 8 can be formed from a polymer that is dissimilar from the polymer forming<br>
the second strips 10. The dissimilarity between the two polymers forming the two strips 8,<br>
10 results in a stress concentration along the interfacial boundary between the two strips 8,<br>
10. The stress concentration serves as a split/peel feature in the tubular body 2 for<br>
splitting/peeling the body 2.<br>
[0085] The polymers of the strips 8,10 can be the same polymer, but dissimilar<br>
because they have dissimilar molecular orientations. The polymers of the strips 8,10 can<br>
be the same polymer, but dissimilar because they have different toughness, hardness,<br>
rigidity, and/or etc. For example, the first or splitting strip 8 can be formed of PEBAX<br>
having a durometer value of approximately 70D, and the second or non-splitting strip 10 is<br>
formed of PEBAX having a durometer value of approximately 30-40D.<br>

[0086] In use, a puncture is made with a thin walled needle through the skin and into a<br>
blood vessel. A guidewire is then placed through the needle into the blood vessel and the<br>
needle is withdrawn. An intravascular introducer is advanced over the guidewire into the<br>
lumen of the blood vessel. The tubular body 2 is inserted into the introducer and<br>
manipulated so it travels along the blood vessel to the point of treatment (e.g., a chamber in<br>
the heart). The travel and positioning of the tubular body 2 within the patient is monitored<br>
via X-ray fluoroscopy.<br>
[0087] In use, the tubular body 2 is inserted into the body of a patient via a surgical<br>
site (e.g., entering the chest cavity below the xiphoid process). A guidewire is used to<br>
direct the tubular body 2 to a point of treatment (e.g., the pericardial space of a heart). The<br>
travel and positioning of the tubular body 2 within the patient is monitored via X-ray<br>
fluoroscopy.<br>
[0088] Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred<br>
embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form<br>
and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
