[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains] The present invention relates to a power unit mounted on a vehicle and transmitting the power of an internal combustion engine to a driving shaft through a clutch, a speed change gear and a speed reduction device, and more particularly to a layout structure of the internal combustion engine, the clutch, the speed change gear and the speed reduction device constituting the power unit. [0002]-<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Hithterto, as a device of this type, there has been known the driving device of a four-wheel motor vehicle disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Open No. Hei 4-28116. The driving device comprises an engine with a crank shaft disposed longitudinally with respect to the vehicle body, a first input shaft operated in conjunction with the crank shaft through a speed reduction gear and a clutch, a transmission comprising a speed change mechanism, a second input shaft to the speed change mechanism and an output shaft from the speed change mechanism, and a pair of gears for operating the first input shaft and the second input shaft in conjunction with each other.  The second input shaft, the speed change mechanism and the<br><br><br>
output shaft constituting the transmission are disposed in a gear case, and the output shaft and a rear wheel driving shaft are operated in conjunction with each other through a bevel gear constituting a final speed reduction device.<br>
[Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
According to the prior art as above, the speed change mechanism connected to the second input shaft extending rearward from the engine disposed on the front side of the rear wheel driving shaft is disposed on the rear side of the rear wheel driving shaft, so that the masses of the driving device including the engine are not concentrated in the longitudinal direction, and there is room for improvement in drivability.  In addition, the gear case is inevitably enlarged, and the driving device constituted of the engine and the transmission is â€¢ inevitably enlarged, so that the degree of freedom in layout of the members disposed in the periphery of the driving device is restricted, and the vehicle body is enlarged in size in the longitudinal direction.  Besides, since the output shaft is coaxial with the input shaft of the final speed reduction device, the speed change mechanism having a relatively large diameter is disposed<br><br><br>
in the vicinity of the rear wheel driving shaft in the upper-lower direction, so that there is the drawback that the minimum height from the ground of the vehicle is lowered.<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-mentioned situations, and, accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to contrive mass concentration and compact design in a power unit mounted on a vehicle and to prevent the minimum height from the ground of the vehicle from being lowered.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem and Effects of the Invention]<br>
The invention as set forth in claim 1 of the present application resides in a power unit mounted on a vehicle comprising an internal combustion engine, a speed change gear comprising a speed change portion to which power of a crank shaft of the internal combustion engine is transmitted and an output portion for outputting the power speed-changed by the speed change portion, a final speed reduction device to which the power of the output portion is transmitted through an intermediate speed reduction device, and a transmission case containing the<br><br>
speed change gear, the power from the final speed reduction device being transmitted to a driving shaft, wherein the intermediate speed reduction device and the final speed reduction device are contained in the transmission case, the speed change portion is disposed on the side of the internal combustion engine whereas the output portion is disposed on the side opposite to the internal combustion engine with respect to the driving shaft, and the speed change gear is disposed on the upper side of the intermediate speed reduction device disposed on the upper side of the final speed reduction device.<br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 1, the speed change portion of the speed change gear is disposed on the side of the internal combustion engine with respect to the driving shaft, so that the speed change portion occupying a large weight in the speed change gear is disposed relatively close to the internal combustion engine large in weight, and concentration of masses in the power unit mounted on the vehicle is accomplished.  In addition, since the intermediate speed reduction device and the final speed reduction device are in an upper-and-lower positional relationship, both the speed reduction devices are disposed side by side in the<br><br>
longitudinal direction, and, since the speed change portion is disposed on the side of the internal combustion engine while the output portion is disposed on the side opposite to the internal combustion engine with respect to the driving shaft, the distance between the output portion and the driving shaft can be reduced, so that the transmission case containing the speed change gear, the intermediate speed reduction device and the final speed reduction device can be made compact. Furthermore, in the power unit, the speed change gear is disposed on the upper side of the intermediate speed reduction device located on the upper side of the final speed reduction device, so that the speed change gear is located relatively away from the driving shaft in the vertical direction, and, therefore, the minimum height from the ground of the vehicle is prevented from being lowered due to the speed change gear.<br>
As a result, in the power unit, mass concentration is achieved, and drivability of the vehicle is enhanced. In addition, since the transmission case can be made compact, the power unit is made compact, and the degree of freedom in laying out the members disposed in the periphery of the power unit is increased.  Furthermore,<br><br>
the minimum height from the ground of the vehicle is prevented from being lowered due to the layout of the speed change gear of the power unit.<br>
The invention as set forth in claim 2 resides in a power unit mounted on a vehicle as set forth in claim 1, wherein the speed change gear comprises a speed change gear shaft for transmitting power to the speed change portion by being drive - connected to the crank shaft through a clutch having a clutch shaft disposed on the upper side of the crank shaft, the clutch shaft is coaxial with the speed change gear shaft, and the clutch is disposed side by side with the crank shaft in the l'ongitudinal direction. <br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 2, in addition to the effects of the invention as set forth in claim 1, the clutch shaft and the speed change gear shaft are coaxial with each other, so that the crank shaft is located nearer to the driving shaft than the clutch and the speed change gear and, therefore, the center of gravity of the vehicle can be lowered.  In addition, since the clutch shaft and the speed change gear shaft are coaxial with each other and the clutch<br><br>
having the clutch shaft is disposed side by side with the crank shaft in the longitudinal direction, the speed change gear can be located near to the internal combustion engine in the longitudinal direction, which also ensures that concentration of masses in the longitudinal direction can be achieved in the power unit, and the power unit is made compact in the longitudinal direction. <br>
As a result, of the effects of the invention as set forth in claim 1, the concentration of masses and compact design in the power unit can be further promoted, and the center of gravity of the vehicle can be lowered, whereby running stability is enhanced.<br>
The invention as set forth in claim 3 resides in a power unit mounted on a vehicle as set forth in claim 2, wherein the crank shaft is disposed directed in the longitudinal direction, a cylinder of the internal combustion engine having a substantially horizontal center axis is disposed on one lateral side in the right-left direction with respect to the crank shaft, and the clutch, the speed change gear and the intermediate speed reduction device having rotational axes parallel to the<br><br>
rotational axis of the crank shaft are disposed on the other lateral side in the right-left direction with respect to the crank shaft.<br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 3, in addition to the effects of the invention as set forth in claim 2, since the clutch, the speed change gear and the intermediate speed reduction device having rotational axes parallel to the rotational axis of the crank shaft are disposed on the side opposite to the side where the cylinder occupying a large space is disposed with respect to the crank shaft, the component elements of the power unit can be laid out in a compact configuration in the periphery of the rotational axis of the crank shaft, and accessory parts (for example, an air cleaner) of the internal combustion engine and parts to be fitted to the vehicle body can be disposed in a space formed at the direct rear of the cylinder on the side where the cylinder is disposed.  In addition, since the center axis of the cylinder is substantially horizontal, the center of gravity of the internal combustion engine can be lowered, and, hence, the center of gravity of the vehicle can be lowered. <br><br>
As a result, of the effects of the invention as set forth in claim 2, the lowering of the center of gravity of the vehicle can be further promoted, the component elements of the power unit can be laid out in a compact configuration in the periphery of the rotational axis of the crank shaft, the power unit can be made compact with the rotational axis of the crank shaft as a center, and parts can be laid out by utilizing the space formed at the direct rear of the cylinder, whereby the vehicle body can be made compact.<br>

The non-stage transmission 70 is provided with an input rotating speed sensor and an output rotating speed sensor which are not shown; based on rotating speeds detected by the sensors, the rotation of the electric motor 80 is controlled by an<br><br><br>
electronic control device so as to obtain a speed change ratio set according to throttle valve opening and rotating speed which show the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine E, whereby the cone holder 76 is moved in the direction of the rotational axis L4 .<br>
The output gear 82 located on the rear side of the rear axle 13 is meshed with a first intermediate input gear 86 provided at a front portion of an intermediate shaft 85 disposed on the lower side of the transmission shaft 71 and rotatably supported on the transmission case C through a pair of ball bearings 83, 84.  A first intermediate output gear 87 is provided at a rear portion of the intermediate shaft 85, and the first intermediate output gear 87 is meshed with a second intermediate input gear 88 which is integrally rotatably connected to a rear portion of a pinion shaft 89 provided with a pinion gear 90 constituting the final speed reduction device R2 together with a ring gear 91 (See Fig. 4) and which is constituted of a gear larger in diameter than the first intermediate output gear 87.  A front portion of the pinion shaft 89 is rotatably supported on a speed reduction case portion 92 provided as a portion of the transmission case C through a ball bearing 93, and a rear<br><br><br>
portion of the pinion shaft 89 is rotatably supported on the transmission case C through a ball bearing 94. Therefore, the first intermediate input gear 86, the first intermediate output gear 87 and the second intermediate input gear 88  constitute the intermediate speed reduction device R1 which transmits the power from the output portion 70b of the non-stage transmission 70 to the pinion shaft 89 by reducing the rotating speed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the pinion gear 90 is meshed with the ring gear 91 spline-connected to a differential case 95 contained in the speed reduction case portion 92, and final speed reduction of the rotating speed of the crank shaft 20 is conducted.  A left axle pipe 96L containing a left rear axle 13L therein and a right axle pipe 96R containing a right rear axle 13R therein are respectively connected by bolts to a left opening portion and a right opening portion of the speed reduction case portion 92. <br>
A differential device D comprises the differential case 95, a pinion shaft 97 fixed by penetrating through the inside of   the differential   case 95,   a pair of pinion gears 98, 99 fixed to both ends of the pinion shaft 97,<br><br><br>
and a right-left pair of side gears 100, 101 meshed with the pinion gears 98, 99. The left rear axle 13L and the right rear axle 13R are spline - connected to the left and right side gears 100, 101, respectively.<br>
By such constitution of the transmission device M, the power of the crank shaft 20 is transmitted to the clutch 60 through the driven gear 62 meshed with the driving gear 53, and the power of the clutch shaft 61 of the clutch 60 is transmitted to the speed change portion 70a through the transmission shaft 71 of the non-stage transmission 70.  Speed change is carried out in the speed change portion 70a so as to obtain a speed change ratio set according to the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine E, and the power thus speed-changed is transmitted from the output gear 82 to the final speed reduction device R2 through the intermediate speed reduction device Rl, and then through the differential device D to the left and right rear axles 13, whereby the rear wheels Wr are driven.<br>
Here, referring to Fig. 2, the layout of the crank shaft 20, the clutch shaft 61, the transmission shaft 71, the intermediate shaft 85 and the pinion shaft 89 for<br><br><br>
transmitting the power of the crank shaft 20 to the rear axles 13 will be described. The rotational axis L5 of the intermediate shaft 85 parallel to the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 is located on a slightly slantly left upper side of the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft L1 and is located lower than the rotational axis L4 of the transmission shaft 71 and closer to the rotational axis L1.  The rotational axis L6 of the pinion shaft 89 parallel to the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 is located on a slightly slantly left lower side of the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 and is located lower than the rotational axis L5 of the intermediate shaft 85 and closer to the rotational axis L1.  Therefore, the transmission shaft 71, the intermediate shaft 85 and the pinion shaft 89 are located more closer to the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 in this order. By this layout, masses can be concentrated in the right-left direction in the power unit P, and the transmission case C can be made compact.<br>
Next, the effects of the embodiment constituted as described above will be described.<br>
Since the speed change portion 70a of the non-stage transmission 70 is disposed on the side of the internal<br><br><br>
combustion engine E with respect to the rear axles 13, the speed change portion 70a occupying a large weight in the non-stage transmission 70 is located comparatively close to the internal combustion engine E having a large weight, so that mass concentration is achieved in the power unit P mounted on the motor tricycle V which is a vehicle.  In addition, since the intermediate speed reduction device Rl and the final speed reduction device R2 are in an upper-lower positional relationship, both the speed reduction devices Rl, R2 are disposed side by side in the longitudinal direction.  Further, since the speed change portion 70a is disposed on the side of the internal combustion engine E while the output portion 70b is disposed on the opposite side of the internal combustion engine E with respect to the rear axles 13, the distance between the output gear 82 and the rear axles 13 in the longitudinal direction can be reduced, so that the transmission case C containing the non-stage transmission 70, the intermediate speed reduction device Rl and the final speed reduction device R2 can be made compact in the longitudinal direction.  Furthermore, since the non-stage transmission 70 is disposed on the upper side of the intermediate speed reduction device Rl located on the upper side of the final speed reduction<br><br>
device R2 in the power unit P, the non-stage transmission 70 is located comparatively away from the rear axles 13 in the vertical direction, so that the minimum height from the ground of the vehicle can be prevented from being lowered due to the transmission.<br>
As a result, mass concentration is achieved in the power unit P, and the drivability of the motor tricycle V is enhanced.  In addition, since the transmission case C can be made compact in the longitudinal direction, the power unit P is made compact in the longitudinal direction, and the degree of freedom in layout of the members disposed in the periphery of the power unit P is increased.  Further, the minimum height from the ground of the motor tricycle V is prevented from being lowered due to the layout of the non-stage transmission 70 of the power unit P.<br>
Since the crank shaft 20 is located nearer to the rear axles 13 than the clutch 60 and the non-stage transmission 70 having the clutch shaft 61 and the transmission shaft 71 coaxial with each other, the center of gravity of the motor tricycle V can be lowered.  In addition, since the clutch shaft 61 and the transmission<br><br><br>
shaft 71 are coaxial with each other and the clutch 60 having the clutch shaft 61 is disposed side by side with the crank shaft 20 in the longitudinal direction, the non-stage transmission 70 can be disposed close to the internal combustion engine E in the longitudinal direction, and, in this point, also, masses can be concentrated in the longitudinal direction in the power unit P, which is made compact in the longitudinal direction.  As a result, the mass concentration and compact designing of the power unit P can be further promoted, and the center of gravity of the motor tricycle V can be lowered, which ensures enhanced running stability.<br>
Since the cylinder 22 occupying a large space is disposed on the right side of the crank shaft 20 while the clutch 60, the non-stage transmission 70, the intermediate shaft 85 and the pinion shaft 89 respectively having the rotational axes L3, L4, L5 and L6 parallel to the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 are disposed on the right side of the crank shaft 20, these component elements of the power unit P can be disposed in a compact configuration in the periphery of the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20, and<br><br><br>
accessory parts (for example, air cleaner) of the internal combustion engine E and parts to be fitted to the vehicle body can be disposed in the space formed at the direct rear of the cylinder 22 on the side where the cylinder 22 is disposed. Besides, since the center axis L2 of the cylinder 22 is substantially horizontal, the center of gravity of the internal combustion engine E can be lowered, and, hence, the center of gravity of the motor tricycle V can be lowered.<br>
As a result, the lowering of the center of gravity of the motor tricycle V can be promoted, and the clutch 60, the non-stage transmission 70, the intermediate shaft 85 and the pinion shaft 89 which are component elements of the power unit P are disposed in a compact configuration in the periphery of the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20, so that the power unit P can be made compact with the rotational axis L1 as a center, and parts can be disposed utilizing the space formed at the direct rear of the cylinder 22, whereby the vehicle body can be made compact.<br>
Further, since the transmission shaft 71, the intermediate shaft 85 and the pinion shaft 89 having the<br><br><br>
rotational axes L4 , L5 and L6 parallel to the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 occupy positions closer to the rotational axis L1 of the crank shaft 20 in this order, mass concentration in the right-left direction can be achieved in the power unit P, and the transmission case C can be made small in size.  As a result, the drivability of the motor tricycle V is enhanced, and the power unit P is made compact in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Now, as to embodiments obtained by modifying part of the constitution of the above-described embodiment, the modified constitution will be described.<br>
While the non-stage transmission 70 is of the cone type in the above embodiment, a swash-type non-stage transmission and other single-shaft type transmission may be used.  Besides, while the vehicle is a motor tricycle in the above embodiment, the vehicle may be a motorcycle or a four-wheel motor vehicle.<br><br>
