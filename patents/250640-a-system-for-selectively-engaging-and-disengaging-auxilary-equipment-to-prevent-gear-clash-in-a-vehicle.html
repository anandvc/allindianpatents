GEAR CLASH LOGIC<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to systems and methods for preventing gear<br>
clash in vehicles having a transfer case that couples a transmission output shaft to<br>
auxiliary equipment.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]		Commercial vehicles such as fire truck pumpers, sewer cleaners, and oil<br>
field pumpers include an auxiliary gearbox or transfer case that is connected to the output<br>
shaft of the vehicle's transmission. In auxiliary equipment mode, the transfer case drives<br>
auxiliary equipment, and the transmission controller provides a secondary mode of<br>
operation. A secondary mode of operation could be a single forward range or all ranges<br>
with a shift schedule specific to the auxiliary equipment.<br>
[0003]	The process of transfer case engagement and disengagement with<br>
auxiliary equipment takes place with the transmission output shaft locked by applying<br>
locking clutches. The locking clutch application is referred to as Neutral Very Low<br>
(NVL) range. In NVL, auxiliary equipment engagement and disengagement is difficult<br>
to achieve when gear teeth do not line up properly such that a "gear-clash" condition<br>
exists. "Gear-clash" in the transfer case cannot be overcome with a transfer case<br>
actuator. Operators will attempt to eliminate "gear-clash" by selecting drive or reverse.<br>
A high failure rate of transfer case actuators is attributed to "gear-clash".<br>
[0004]		Thus, there is a need for a system and method to preventing "gear-clash".<br>
The system and method for preventing "gear-clash" should operate during engagement<br>
and disengaging of the auxiliary equipment.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]		In an aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for selectively<br>
engaging and disengaging auxiliary equipment to avoid gear clash in a vehicle. The<br>
system includes a transmission, a transfer case, and a transmission controller. The<br>
transmission has a plurality of gears for establishing a plurality of gear ratios. The<br>
1<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
transfer case is coupled to the transmission by an output shaft. The transmission<br>
controller is in communication with a plurality of control devices for controlling the<br>
operation of the transmission. The controller includes control logic for controlling the<br>
engagement and disengagement of the auxiliary equipment. The control logic has a first<br>
control logic for determining whether an operator has actuated a selector switch, a second<br>
control logic for actuating a torque transmitting device to engage or disengage the<br>
auxiliary equipment and avoid gear clash, a third logic for monitoring the engagement or<br>
disengagement of the auxiliary equipment, and a fourth control logic determining<br>
whether the auxiliary equipment has been engaged or disengaged.<br>
[0006]		In another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes determining whether a transmission output speed is greater than a predefined<br>
output speed threshold.<br>
[0007]		In yet another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes engaging a torque transmitting device to lock the transmission output shaft.<br>
[0008]		In yet another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes incrementing a first timer after the transmission output shaft is locked.<br>
[0009]		In still another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes comparing a first recorded time recorded by the first timer to a first time<br>
threshold.<br>
[0010]		In still another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes disengaging the torque transmitting device to allow the transmission output shaft<br>
to rotate.<br>
[0011]		In still another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes incrementing a second timer after the torque transmitting device has been<br>
disengaged to allow the transmission output shaft to rotate.<br>
[0012]		In still another aspect of the present invention, the second control logic<br>
includes comparing a second recorded time recorded by the second timer to a second time<br>
threshold.<br>
[0013]		In still another aspect of the present invention, a method for selectively<br>
engaging and disengaging auxiliary equipment to avoid gear clash in a transfer case of a<br>
vehicle is provided. The method includes determining whether an operator has actuated a<br>
2<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
selector switch, actuating a torque transmitting device to engage or disengage the<br>
auxiliary equipment and avoid gear clash, monitoring the engagement or disengagement<br>
of the auxiliary equipment, and determining whether the auxiliary equipment has been<br>
engaged or disengaged.<br>
[0014]		The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020]		Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, in Figure 1 a system 10 for selectively powering a first set of equipment 12<br>
and a second set or auxiliary set of equipment 14 to avoid gear clash is schematically<br>
illustrated. The present invention contemplates that the teachings described herein may<br>
be most useful in vehicles having auxiliary power equipment that require a power transfer<br>
from the transmission. For example, commercial vehicles such as fire trucks, sewer<br>
3<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
cleaners and oil field pumpers all have auxiliary equipment that require a power transfer<br>
from the transmission to operate. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that the teachings of the present invention can be applied not only to these<br>
types of vehicles but to other vehicles and systems as well.<br>
[0021]		In an embodiment of the present invention, system 10 includes a<br>
transmission 16, a transfer case 18, a transmission controller 20 and control logic<br>
embodied in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software within<br>
controller 20. The transmission 16 is a conventional vehicle transmission and, generally,<br>
has a plurality of gears for establishing a plurality of gear ratios. For example,<br>
transmission 16 is the transmission shown and described in US Patent No. 4,070,927,<br>
hereby incorporated by reference. Transmission 16 may have six forward gear speeds or<br>
gear ratios and two reverse gear speeds or gear ratios. Of course, the present invention<br>
contemplates is operable with transmissions having other gear speeds. Transmission 16<br>
typically has a plurality torque transmitting devices (not shown) for selectively<br>
transferring power between the plurality of gears and ultimately to a transmission output<br>
shaft 22. Moreover, at least one of torque transmitting devices is configured to<br>
selectively prevent rotation of the transmission output shaft 22. The torque transmitting<br>
devices are clutches or brakes as well known in the field of transmissions.<br>
[0022]		The transfer case 18 includes a plurality of gears to transfer torque or<br>
power from the transmission to auxiliary equipment 14. The transmission output shaft 22<br>
couples the transfer case 18 to transmission 16. The transmission controller 20,<br>
generally, includes a processor (not shown) in communication with electronic memory<br>
storage devices (not shown). Further, control logic is also provided in controller 20 and<br>
may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.<br>
For example, a control logic may be in the form of program code that is stored on the<br>
electronic memory storage and executable by the processor. Generally, controller 20<br>
receives transmission speed signals from transmission speed sensors 23 mounted to<br>
transmission 16. Additionally, transmission controller 20 receives other inputs from<br>
other vehicle input devices 24 such as an auxiliary mode selection switch. The auxiliary<br>
mode selection switch provides an output to controller 20 indicative of an operator<br>
requesting auxiliary power mode or the engagement of the auxiliary equipment 14.<br>
4<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
Further, a positive engagement switch or sensor 26 is in communication with the<br>
auxiliary equipment 14 and the transmission controller. The positive engagement switch<br>
26 provides an output to controller 20 indicative of engagement or disengagement of the<br>
auxiliary equipment 14. The controller 20 receives these inputs and selectively activates<br>
a plurality control devices such as the torque transmitting devices to control the operation<br>
of the transmission and the rotation of the transmission output shaft 22.<br>
[0023]		For example, a control logic implemented in software program code that is<br>
executable by the processor of controller 20 includes a first control logic for determining<br>
whether an operator has actuated a selector switch, a second control logic for determining<br>
whether a transmission output speed is greater than a output speed threshold, a third<br>
control logic for engaging a torque transmitting device to lock the transmission output<br>
shaft, a fourth control logic for incrementing a first timer after the transmission output<br>
shaft is locked, a fifth control logic for comparing a first recorded time recorded by the<br>
first timer to a first time threshold, a sixth control logic for disengaging the torque<br>
transmitting device to allow the transmission output shaft to rotate, a seventh control<br>
logic for incrementing a second timer after the torque transmitting device has been<br>
disengaged to allow the transmission output shaft to rotate and an eighth control logic for<br>
comparing a second recorded time recorded by the second timer to a second time<br>
threshold.<br>
[0024]		Referring now to Figure 2, a flowchart of a method 30 for controlling the<br>
engagement of the second set or auxiliary set of equipment is illustrated, in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The method is initiated at block 32 with<br>
the vehicle having the auxiliary equipment originally being in a normal mode of<br>
operation with the auxiliary equipment disengaged. At block 34, the method determines<br>
whether an auxiliary equipment mode has been selected by a vehicle operator indicative<br>
of a desire to engage the auxiliary equipment. If the method has determined that an<br>
auxiliary equipment mode has been requested, then method enters an engage gear clash<br>
logic routine, as represented by block 36, to prevent gear clash in the transfer case and<br>
engage the auxiliary equipment, as will be described in further detail hereinafter.<br>
However, if the method of the present invention determines that auxiliary equipment<br>
mode has not been requested then the method returns to block 32. At block 38, the<br>
5<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
method determines whether the auxiliary equipment is engaged by monitoring an<br>
auxiliary equipment engagement sensor. If the method determines that the auxiliary<br>
equipment is engaged at block 38, then the method terminates in auxiliary equipment<br>
mode, as represented by block 40. However, if the method of the present invention<br>
determines that the auxiliary equipment has not been engaged then the method returns to<br>
block 36 and re-enters the engage gear clash logic routine.<br>
[0025]		Referring now to Figure 3, a flowchart of a method 50 for controlling the<br>
disengagement of the second set or auxiliary set of equipment is illustrated, in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. Method 50 is initiated at block 52 with the<br>
vehicle having the auxiliary equipment being in an auxiliary equipment mode of<br>
operation with the auxiliary equipment engaged. At block 54, the method determines<br>
whether normal operation mode has been selected by a vehicle operator indicative of a<br>
desire to disengage the auxiliary equipment. If the method has determined that a normal<br>
operation mode has been requested, then method enters a disengage gear clash logic<br>
routine, as represented by block 56, to prevent gear clash in the transfer case and<br>
disengage the auxiliary equipment, as will be described in further detail hereinafter.<br>
However, if the method of the present invention determines that normal operation mode<br>
has not been requested then the method returns to block 52. At block 58, the method<br>
determines whether the auxiliary equipment is disengaged by monitoring an auxiliary<br>
equipment engagement sensor. If the method determines that the auxiliary equipment is<br>
disengaged at block 58, then the method terminates in normal operation mode, as<br>
represented by block 60. However, if the method of the present invention determines that<br>
the auxiliary equipment has not been disengaged then the method returns to block 56 and<br>
re-enters the disengage gear clash logic routine.<br>
[0026]		Referring now to Figure 4, a flowchart of method 70 for engaging the<br>
auxiliary set of equipment and preventing "gear clash" is illustrated, in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Method 70 is initiated at block 72 with the<br>
vehicle operator requesting engagement of the auxiliary equipment. At block 74, the<br>
method determines whether the transmission has been placed in neutral and compares the<br>
transmission output speed with a predefined speed threshold (Enter_NVL_Thresh). If the<br>
method has determined that transmission has been placed in neutral and that the<br>
6<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
transmission output speed is less than the predefined speed threshold then, the torque<br>
transmitting devices are engaged to lock the transmission output shaft and prevent further<br>
rotation, as represented by block 76. However, if method 70 of the present invention<br>
determines that the transmission has not been placed in neutral or that the transmission<br>
output speed is greater than the predefined speed threshold (Enter_NVL_Thresh), then<br>
the method returns to block 72. At block 78, a first timer (NVL_Timer) is incremented<br>
and recorded. The time recorded by the NVL_Timer is compared to a predefined time<br>
threshold (Time_in_NVL_Thresh), as represented by block 80. If at block 80 the method<br>
70 determines that the time recorded by NVL_Timer is greater than<br>
Time_in_NVL_Thresh then, the torque transmitting device (Clutch C4) is disengaged to<br>
allow the transmission shaft to rotate, as represented by block 82. However, if the<br>
method of the present invention determines that the time recorded by NVL_Timer is not<br>
greater than Time_in_NVL_Thresh then the method returns to block 76 and re-enters the<br>
disengage gear clash logic routine. At block 84, a second timer NC5_Timer is<br>
incremented and the time is recorded. The time recorded by the NC5_Timer is compared<br>
to a predefined time threshold (Time_in_NC5_Thresh) and the transmission output speed<br>
is compared to a speed threshold (Irnrned_NVL_Thresh), as represented by block 86. If<br>
at block 86 the method 70 determines that the time recorded by NC5_Timer is greater<br>
than Time_in_NC5_Thresh or if the transmission output speed is greater than<br>
Immed_NVL_Thresh then, the method returns to block 76. However, if method 70 of the<br>
present invention determines that the time recorded by NC5_Timer is not greater than<br>
Time_in_NC5_Thresh or if the transmission output speed is not greater than<br>
Immed_NVL_Thresh then, the method returns to block 82.<br>
[0027]		Referring now to Figure 5, a flowchart of method 90 for disengaging the<br>
auxiliary set of equipment and preventing "gear clash" is illustrated, in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Method 90 is initiated at block 92 with the<br>
vehicle operator requesting normal operation mode or disengagement of the auxiliary<br>
equipment. At block 94, the method determines whether the transmission has been<br>
placed in neutral and compares the transmission output speed with a predefined speed<br>
threshold (Exit_NVL_Thresh). If method 90 has determined that transmission has been<br>
placed in neutral and that the transmission output speed is less than Exit_NVL_Thresh<br>
7<br><br>
GP309169/PTA/DLT<br>
then, the torque transmitting devices (i.e. clutches) are engaged to lock the transmission<br>
output shaft and prevent further rotation, as represented by block 96. However, if method<br>
90 of the present invention determines that the transmission has not been placed in<br>
neutral or that the transmission output speed is greater than the predefined speed<br>
threshold (Exit_NVL_Thresh), then the method returns to block 92. At block 98, a first<br>
timer (NVL_Timer) is incremented and recorded. The time recorded by the NVL_Timer<br>
is compared to a predefined time threshold (Time_in_NVL_Thresh), as represented by<br>
block 100. If at block 100 the method 90 determines that the time recorded by<br>
NVL_Timer is greater than Time_in_NVL_Thresh then, the torque transmitting device<br>
(Clutch C4) is disengaged to allow the transmission shaft to rotate, as represented by<br>
block 102. However, if the method of the present invention determines that the time<br>
recorded by NVL_Timer is not greater than Time_in_NVL_Thresh, then the method<br>
returns to block 96 and the engaged clutches continue to lock the transmission shaft. At<br>
block 104, a second timer NC5_Timer is incremented and the time is recorded. The time<br>
recorded by the NC5_Timer is compared to a predefined time threshold<br>
(Time_in_NC5_Thresh) and the transmission output speed is compared to a speed<br>
threshold (Immed_NVL_Thresh), as represented by block 106. If at block 106 the<br>
method 90 determines that the time recorded by NC5_Timer is greater than<br>
Time_in_NC5_Thresh or if the transmission output speed is greater than<br>
Immed_NVL_Thresh then, the method returns to block 96. However, if method 90 of the<br>
present invention determines that the time recorded by NC5_Timer is not greater than<br>
Time_in_NC5_Thresh or if the transmission output speed is not greater than<br>
Immed_NVL_Thresh then, the method returns to block 102 and clutch C4 remains<br>
disengaged to allow the transmission output shaft to rotate.<br>

A system and method for selectively engaging and disengaging auxiliary<br>
equipment to avoid gear clash in a vehicle is disclosed. The system includes a<br>
transmission, a transfer case, and a transmission controller. The transmission has a<br>
plurality of gears for establishing a plurality of gear ratios. The transfer case is coupled<br>
to the transmission by an output shaft. The transmission controller is in communication<br>
with a plurality of control devices for controlling the operation of the transmission. The<br>
controller includes control logic for controlling the engagement and disengagement of the<br>
auxiliary equipment. The control logic has a first control logic for determining whether<br>
an operator has actuated a selector switch, a second control logic for actuating a torque<br>
transmitting device to engage or disengage the auxiliary equipment and avoid gear clash,<br>
a third logic for monitoring the engagement or disengagement of the auxiliary equipment,<br>
and a fourth control logic determining whether the auxiliary equipment has been engaged<br>
or disengaged.<br></td>
